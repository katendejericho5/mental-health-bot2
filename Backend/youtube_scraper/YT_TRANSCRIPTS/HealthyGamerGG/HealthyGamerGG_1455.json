    "transcript": "so on our thanks so much for coming on\nstream today so can you help us\nunderstand a little bit about who you\nare and and what you stream sure um hi\nguys i'm ana i stream variety for the\nmost part i used to stream a lot of\noverwatch but I felt like that game made\nme really sad made me really angry it\nwas difficult to have fun so I kind of\ntransitioned into variety streaming for\nHalloween i streamed a few horror games\nwhich i think other people enjoy a lot\nmore than I do but it's fun to get clips\nof me screaming and being weird and\nwacky but it's just really a really fun\nfun time okay and how how is it that you\ngot into streaming um well I guess\nconsidering the topic today that's\nthat's kind of why I started streaming\nI've never disclaimer\nI've never technically been like\ndiagnosed with anxiety or anything but\nwhen I was younger I was really bad at\nsocializing with people and I thought\nthat streaming would be a really good\nway to learn how to talk to people and\nkind of get out of my shell a little bit\nand and sort of put myself in an\nuncomfortable position so that I could\nsort of grow as a program I guess so you\nstarted streaming specifically to like\nhelp overcome your concerns about like\nsort of being socially with people and\nfeeling uncomfortable yeah that's kind\nof like a like diving in headfirst sort\nof yeah I mean at the start it was it\nwas very nerve-wracking I mean it still\nis sometimes like um for the first year\nor so that I was streaming I was also\ngoing to school so being overwhelmed\nwith schoolwork and one nod and and\ntrying to have a social life outside of\nthat and stream it was it was really\ndifficult sometimes knowing how\nnerve-wracking it would be to hit the\nthe go-live button to actually gather up\nthe courage to do that right I mean it\nwas um it was worth it in the end and I\nreally enjoyed doing it but there were\ndefinitely days where I would just not\nstream because I was afraid afraid of\nwhat well I mean again since I was\nstruggling so much for the social aspect\nof streaming a lot the idea of being a\nsmall streamer and growing slowly was\nkind of nerve-wracking because a lot of\npeople who go into streaming they just\nwant to see themselves grow immediately\nand become a big famous streamer\nwhich wasn't the goal necessarily but it\nwas you know an appealing idea so to be\nsitting there smaller numbers of viewers\nor whatnot\nand knowing that not hitting go live\nwould affect that but then knowing that\nI might be streaming for three or four\nhours talking to nobody was kind of it's\nscary to try and talk to yourself I\nguess for hours and hours on end and\nstill be entertaining yet so what's\nscary about that I guess I worry a lot\nabout what I talk about what I say how\npeople perceive me I worry that people\njudge me and maybe it doesn't matter but\nit's still something that I typically\nworry about in a social setting is you\nknow for example if I'm out in public\nnow I have weird pink hair so if someone\nstares at me typically I worry that\nthere's something wrong with my\nappearance or or they're judging me in\nsome way negatively rarely do I think of\nsomething positive it's typically a\nnegative assumption that I have so\nstreaming is kind of that exact same\nthing someone comes into my stream I\ndon't know what they think of me I don't\nknow how they feel watching my stream so\nat least for the first year or so up\nstreaming that was something that was\nalways on my mind was I hope that you\nknow they didn't hate me they didn't\nthink I was weird didn't think I was\nannoying so it sounds like you were\nconcerned about being judged on stream\nby the internet and twitch chat yep and\nthen you're also you were also concerned\nabout being judged by you know real\npeople in the real world and if someone\nis looking at you you know you're it\nsounds like the first place your mind\ngoes is it maybe because it's my hair as\nPinker I look weird and it's not this\nperson recognizes because it recognizes\nand recognizes me because I'm internet\nfamous\nI mean maybe that'll be the case one day\nbut for now it's just an assumption that\nsomething's wrong yeah and and how long\nhave you been having those kinds of\nthoughts about something being wrong\nlike how long has your mind been jumping\nto that place I'd say mostly my whole\nlife I mean at least I'd say as long as\nI can remember in school I was never\nreally the popular kid or anything like\nthat in elementary school I had\nsort of one or two friends here and\nthere we were kind of the the weird kids\nI guess\nin high school I was made fun of a lot\nfor I mean what I love to do which is\ngaming I I liked a lot of Korean pop\nmusic growing up as well and it's it's\npopular now but when I was a kid I was a\ncomplete loser for liking kpop so I got\nteased a lot and I also got teased a lot\nfor my appearance so that's something\nthat I've always been really\nself-conscious about was how I look to\nother people I had sort of a group of\npeople on my school bus who would\nfrequently insult me and belittle me and\nit made me very self-conscious and very\naware of what other people might be\nthinking that they might not be saying\nand is that what you call anxiety well I\nthink it's more of a confidence that she\nthan an anxiety issue what's the dance I\nthink that's not entirely sure\nbianna so we're here to talk about\nanxiety right so what is what do you\nmean by anxiety well I guess the the the\nworry I have the fears that might not be\njustified but they're just kind of in my\nhead thinking that someone is judging me\nwhen there's probably nothing there to\nworry about and it's just my mind\nforming these these thoughts that that\nare unjustified so now this is kind of\ninteresting because it sounds like\nyou're recognizing that those thoughts\nare unjustified so would you say that\nthe thoughts are illogical to some\ndegree I mean when I go out for example\nI obviously don't look at someone and\nimmediately judge everything that's\nwrong with them but for some odd reason\nI think that everyone's doing that to me\nwhich I mean seems a little yeah so are\nyou saying that that that's a confidence\nissue or that's is that what we're\ncalling anxiety I guess a mix of both\nyeah I think so so I think that you're\nwhat maybe what you're thinking is that\nif you were more confident in yourself\nyou wouldn't have those thoughts yeah I\nthink that might ok case so I think that\nwhat you're experiencing is the classic\ndefinition of anxiety right so you're\nconcerned about how people are judging\nyou and that's pretty classic anxiety it\nalso sounds like most of what you're\nexperiencing is around other people's\nperceptions of you I'm not hearing you\nsay that like are you are you worried\nabout other stuff I mean I guess like\nlife in general is kind of unnerving\nbeing 27 years old and kind of confused\nabout life I guess not knowing really\nwhere I'm gonna go there's there's the\ngeneral anxiety of that I guess I've\nalso actually for about five years now\nmy my doctor I've never gone in-depth\ndiscussing with a doctor or anything my\nfamily doctor about anxiety issues I\nhave but um about five years ago I broke\nup with my last boyfriend and he kind of\nwe had this this sort of thing going for\nfour months he owed me money he didn't\nsend me the money he kept kind of saying\nthat he was gonna send it to me and\ndidn't and then it was a song for months\nof him leading me on with that I guess\nand it I think that that created\nsomething that my doctor said was just\nanxiety but since then I've had issues\nwith breathing anything like it feels\nlike kind of yeah with breathing this is\nwhat my doctor told me it was just\nanxiety and it would go away what I mean\nby issues with breathing well sometimes\nI feel like I don't get a full breath of\nair like my lungs don't feel like they\nget filled up especially when I would\nI'm struggling with with something that\nmakes me nervous or anxious it's like I\nI don't feel like I'm breathing properly\nI'm not getting a full full broken I\nguess so it would you like to understand\nhow that works and how to fix it yes\nokay well so I mean fix it is maybe a\nlittle bit ambitious because once again\nI can't dispense medical advice nor can\nI fix anything about your life over the\nInternet but let's start with this\nwhat's the relationship between your\nmind and your breath I guess when I get\nto these points I'm very conscious of\nhow I'm breathing and the fact that I'm\nlacking the air whereas normally if I'm\nnot thinking about how I breathe that's\nit's just natural right it just happens\nbut when I'm in these nervous situations\nI'm a lot more aware of just every\nlittle rumor that I do\nso maybe the the break the breathing is\nrelated so I'm noticing so I'm gonna\nkind of boil down what you said that as\nyou become aware of\nbreath your breath begins to change\nright so I want you guys everyone who's\nwatching I want you to become aware of\nyour breath sorry guys\nright so what so so anarthas you become\naware of your breath what do you start\nnoticing about it well the for me for\nexample right now I'm having the issue\nwith the breathing the the full breath\nthat I can't quite you know get hold of\nso your experience and I feel like I've\nbecome going right but I feel like I've\nbecome very self-conscious of myself\nwhen I'm doing that too because for the\nfor a year or so it was consistent\npretty much every day every moment and I\nif I was with my sister or friends or\nsomething they would always they would\nalways think something was wrong with me\nbecause I'd sound like I'm taking big\ngasps and sighing a lot and they would\nthink is everything okay and and I would\nalways just say no it's just my issue\nwith breathing everything's for the most\npart normal like it's not going away so\njust just don't assume I'm struggling\nwith something necessarily this is just\nhow I am now I guess I kind of accepted\nit after a while that I was struggling\nwith it and what impact when other\npeople noticed that you were gasping and\nsighing all the time what did that do to\nyou\nI feel like I would try to breathe a\nlittle more quietly which might make it\nmore difficult to actually yeah\nabsolutely so it's almost like a vicious\ncycle because when they notice you're\nbreathing like a weirdo and like I don't\nmean to be judgmental but I can imagine\nthat's the thought that was in your head\nright like these people are noticing\nthat I'm reading like a weirdo and I\nfeel like a weirdo because people are\npaying attention to my breathing and\nthen the more that that thought arises\nin your head the worse your breathing\ngets and then you try to do the worst\nthing that people can do with anxiety is\nyou try to control it you try to push it\ndown and how does that work mmm-hmm\npoorly absolutely right so that's the\nfirst thing to understand about anxiety\nis that like people try to like people\npeople are in a war with anxiety does\nthat make sense to you what does that\nmean\nvery much I mean you're you're kind of\ncaught constantly thinking about it\nespecially when it arises and you're\ntrying to I mean as you said you're at\nwar you're trying to battle it push it\naway try and be normal and then it just\nit gets worse because you're so\nconscious of it and again like with me\nwith the breathing\nwhen I become conscious of it it's it's\nmore difficult to control so the thing\nwould be I guess it would be better to\nfind a way to distract myself from it\nand go back to the normal breathing or\nsomething like that but if I become\naware it's just yet a struggle so for\npeople who are like is it I'm gonna ask\nlike I'm not gonna actually look at\ntwitch at it's twitch chats answers\nright now but as you become aware of\nbreathing I want you to notice that you\nautomatically begin to control it it's\nvery hard to just observe your breathing\nwithout changing your breathing does\nthat make sense an RM hmm okay yes so\nnow I'm gonna ask you again so we're\ngonna take a step back we're gonna\nbounce a little bit between anxiety and\nunderstanding let's start by\nunderstanding the relationship between\nthe mind and the breath so what what\nrelationship does your mental state have\non your breathing well as I said I think\nwhat my doctors said as well I guess\nvery briefly in our discussion about\nthis was that oh goodness\nwhen let's forget what your doctor said\nsee it's it's the only thing I ever\ntalked to her about regarding my anxiety\nso I think that maybe she wasn't fully\nunderstanding my side of things as well\nno no so let's forget let's forget\nneuroscience let's forget experts let's\nforget anything I've ever said on stream\nI'm asking you a narf and is it honor\nAnna or uh narf Anna and Anna what is\nthe relationship between what is going\nin your going on in your mind and your\nbreathing first of all are they\nconnected I guess to some degree even\nlike subconsciously when I start having\nanxiety if I start you know breathing\nmore quickly or something like that or I\nfeel more sometimes that are so I want\nyou to now we're gonna play a fun game\nokay and you have to you have to pay\nattention to twitch chat because I can't\nbecause I'm focused on you I want you to\nguess what's happening in my mind based\non how I breathe are you ready to play\nthe game okay okay we'll try our best\nwhat's that's a nervousness something's\nworking you up maybe you just rise I\nwouldn't say nervousness what is what is\nokay yeah so right so people yes and you\nguys so just think about this for a\n[ __ ] second you can listen to the\nsound of my breathing and you can tell\nme what is going on in my mind you are\nreading my mind based on listening to my\nbreath your doctor didn't tell you this\nyou didn't read this in a book human\nbeings know this like just think about\nthat and appreciate that for a second\nright and when people are anxious what\ndo we tell them to do in right way and\nwhat does that mean try and relax or\nanything keep it normal which is\ndifficult when you're sort of thinking\nabout more I guess so we tell people to\ntake deep breaths right and does that\nhelp no I mean especially for me right I\nstruggle to breathe deeply when I'm\nhaving these anxious issues so they like\nbreathe deeply and I just I'm more and\nmore aware of the fact that I can't we\njust get stressed so I think that for a\nlot of people deep breathing does help I\nthink in your case it doesn't we'll kind\nof tunnel down into why that is but the\nfirst thing that I want people to\nunderstand is that you know there are\npatterns of breathing so I'll do another\none now what am I feeling right so let's\nstart like fear panic anxiety so now\nwhat do you guys notice about how I'm\nchanging my breathing in what ways what\nare the properties of breath like what's\ndifferent between this\nin this what's different\nI mean panic is a lot fast okay so speed\nis one thing what else is different\nabout the breath we're reading chat\ndepth and speed of breath a tempo speed\nand tempo are the same thing the\nshallowness there we go so let's start\nwith two things right and now I'm gonna\nbreathe another way it's deep and\ncalming\nso what is the emotion in relaxed calm I\nmean even even just watching you do that\nmakes me feel more relaxed yeah right so\nwe'll get to that so calm but now what\nwater are what are the two axes of\nbreath one is depth in one is speed\nright so what is so we can map out what\nkind of emotions lead to what kind of\nbreathing right so calm breathing is\nfast or slow okay where and calm\nbreathing is deep or shallow okay\nexcellent right so then let's talk about\nangry breathing angry breathing is fast\nor slow seems seem slow right I'll do it\nagain\nI mean it's slower but if you think\nyou're pushing out quick good\nso now you've stumbled up upon another\naxis of breath with it which is\ninhalation and exhalation we'll get to\nthat for a second so I would say that\nangry breathing versus anxious breathing\nboth of them are actually fast but\nanxious breathing is deep and fast and\nangry breathing is slow and fast would\nyou guys agree does that make sense\nright yeah and so if we think about calm\nbreathing\nright that's slow and deep and this also\nthere are even deeper layers of this so\na breath in which I am trying to calm\nmyself has a rapid inhalation in a slow\nexhalation listen that's me trying to\ncalm myself and me actually being calm\nis you guy see the difference so there\nare a lot of subtleties in breath that\nwe never study and the next thing to\nunderstand so the first thing is that\nthe pattern of your breathing relates to\nthe pattern of your mind and now I'm\ngonna ask you a question Anna do you\nthink that it's a one-way street or a\ntwo-way street\nand what sense do you mean so we know\nthat our mind determines our pattern of\nbreathing like when you get anxious you\ncan't take a full breath right and so\nlet's just pause and go on a quick\ntangent so when you can't take a full\nbreath are we talking about speed or\ndepth absolutely that you notice that\nvery well good so we'll come back to\nthat yeah so you're telling me that what\nis going on in your mind controls the\nway that you breathe agree or disagree\nokay\nagree so now I'm gonna ask you is that a\none-way street does your mind control\nyour breathing or is it a two-way street\nand as you're breathing also control\nyour mind I guess right so what does\ntwitchchat think so well they say six or\na street so let's just think about this\nso I'm gonna tell you guys about a\nfascinating study okay so there was a\nthere was a researcher who was trying to\nexamine facial expressions and was\ntrying to figure out how much like what\npercentage of a facial expression\ndo I need to demonstrate for someone\nelse to read what I'm feeling right so\nlike if I if I like this an ARF\nwhat do you think I feeling yeah\nhappiness or instead insane see that's\nbeautiful right so like let's just pause\nbecause you're able to detect something\nin my facial expression that's a\nlittle bit crazy so what this researcher\nwas trying to figure out is like what\npercentage of crazy do I need to show in\nmy face for you to be able to pick it up\ndoes that make sense\nso if I like did this Yeah right like\nwhat is that like you're able to detect\nsomething so what he did and do people\nknow what that expression was how did\nthat feel how did you feel when I made\nthat facial expression I mean you kind\nof it doesn't take much it doesn't take\nmuch at all so what this researcher did\nwas he tried to figure out like what\npercentage of a facial expression do I\nneed to show in like what I showed was\nlike a tiny like a tiny tiny amount of\nflirtation right it's just a tiny you I\npicked it up like that and I could see\nit made you a little bit uncomfortable\nand and so the researcher tried to\nfigure out what percentage of a facial\nexpression do I need to show in order\nfor people to pick up what I'm trying to\nsend and he took his research assistants\nand he had them practice facial\nexpressions so then what he did is he\ntrained as his research assistants to\nkind of display 50 percent of anger 25\npercent of anger a hundred percent of\nanger and then he had his research\nassistants like glare at people right\nor like flirt with people or smile at\npeople and by doing that he was like\ntesting like okay and he told his\nresearch assistant I want you to display\n25 percent of anger and see if people\ncan pick it up you get with me so far\nso bizarre things started happening his\nresearch assistants started fighting\namongst each other\nin the research assistant who is trained\nto like with anger started getting\npissed off the research assistant who is\ntrained to feel like shame started\nfeeling ashamed and that through the\nresearch assistant who is trained to\nfeel like to demonstrate happiness\nstarted feeling better and so the\nresearchers stumbled upon a really\nfascinating thing which is that your\nfacial expression actually controls the\nway that you feel - and I want you to\npay attention like an ARFF like right\nnow you're feeling curious right so like\nyeah now now how do you feel\nI mean look at me here it's really I had\na little distracted I guess look at me\nwhat are you feeling intrigued I I mean\nthis is an interesting story I think um\nwhen when we were at twitchcon\nSahil kanga my sister and I we went to\nthis um this improv thing where they did\nsomething similar where they were having\npeople go up on stage and perform sort\nof emotions just like what this guy was\nhaving people do he just no words there\nanything just facial expressions body\nand whatnot I kind of remembered that\nfrom this conversation but um they\ndidn't go in depth with you know how\nthey felt afterwards kind of thing but I\nmean maybe it affected ya there as well\nso like like I think Tom sort of said it\nthat like if I smile it's someone like\nyou guys should try this right so it's\nhard if you have social anxiety but like\ngenuinely smile at someone on the street\nlike if you just smile at someone I do\nthat quite regularly actually yeah cuz I\ndefinitely had people I'm walking by\nthem on the street they smile at me and\nme yeah this is kind of good just like\nIceman and what happens when someone\nsmiles at you is yeah and you can\ncontrol it and when you smile you start\nto feel a little bit better so breath\nand facial expressions like everything\nyour body has a feedback loop this is\nthe principle of homeostasis and it's\nlike how our body functions when our\nheart rate goes too high\nour heart says oh god we're beating too\nfast let's slow it down\neverything has a feedback loop this is\nlike when you go to the doctor and they\ntest your reflexes they're testing your\nnerves ability to create a feedback loop\nso everything in your body has like a\npoint and a counter point like when you\nwhen you get super excited over time\nlike just think about this for a second\nyou don't say excited forever what\nhappens to your excitement over time\nexactly I found and when you feel shitty\nabout yourself what happens hopefully\nover time your body has a very simple\nmechanism where like both sides like\neverything is a two-way street and this\nis homeostasis so when it comes to your\nbreathing I want people to really\nunderstand this what I'm telling you is\nthat you can literally control your mood\nwith your breath right like I can\ncontrol the happiness that an hour feels\nbye\nsee you can't you can't stop it's that\nsimple so all we have to do is\nunderstand what what's the patter of our\nbreathing right so like think of\nthinking about like if I start to\nbreathe in an angry way like I'm gonna\nget angry like even if you guys just\nlike look at me and I'm like and I can't\nstop but smiling which is why you're\nsmiling and you're detecting that\nunderneath the fake anger is the genuine\nsmile so you're empathic circuitry and\nas spot on because you're able to read\nmy facial expressions you're able to\nfeel what I'm feeling and so now what I\nwant you guys to understand is if you're\nfeeling a particular way if you\nliterally change the practice of your\nbreathing you can change your mind and\nbefore we started our stream today like\nI was talking to a couple of people that\nhave been doing so the meditation I've\ntaught and they feel like super calm and\nthere are a lot of reasons why\nmeditation helps us but I think one of\nthe simplest ways is that if you control\nyour breathing you're going to control\nyour mind and this is the science of\nbrawn I am so now a narf I'm curious how\nshallow are your breaths right now can\nyou feel like you can get a good breath\nI do yeah there's there's moments here\nin there where it feels a little more of\na struggle but for the most part yeah\nit's it was it was definitely a little\nmore of a struggle at the start of the\nstream and I feel a little more now we\nhave to dig into this what on earth\nhappened\nbecause when you try to control it it\ndoesn't work when you try to take a full\nbreath you don't feel it so what did we\njust do over the last 10 minutes to like\ndisable your anxiety well something that\nI found find works in general as well as\nwhen something's engaging and\ninteresting to me I'm not paying as much\nattention to the breathing or I'm\nfocused on something else so I'm not\naware of how difficult it is to breathe\nso my body just goes back to doing its\nregular thing which is breathing just\nyou know staying alive so I mean the the\ndiscussion you had there with the facial\nexpressions was intriguing to me so I\nwas I was more focused on my sleep so I\nthink there are two things involved\nthere one is we have to be careful about\ndistraction so one thing that people do\nto combat anxiety is to distract\nthemselves\nbut like when you distract yourself I\nwould argue that what we did is not\nactually distraction does that make\nsense to you or not so much we are\ntrying to teach me a way to deal with it\nwithout it right like so distraction is\nan active effort so let's kind of define\nterms is an active effort in your mind\nto suppress the anxiety and look at\nsomething else\nit's like distraction is like going like\nthis I'm not listening I'm not listening\nI'm not listening I'm not listening\nwhich is not actually calming anyone\ndown does that make sense like that's\nwhat distraction is you know like you're\nnot here like it it's it's like a very\ntense it's like one of the tools in the\nwar against anxiety does that make sense\nwhat we actually did is engagement does\nthat make sense like that there's a\ndifference between distraction and\nengagement I think a lot of times your\nhope is that by distracting you'll\nactually engage in something but what I\nthink we were able to do for you an ARFF\nis engage you in the present moment for\nyou to be like fully present and paying\nattention to what I'm doing you didn't\ntry to distract yourself from your\nanxiety right like you didn't actually\ntry that distraction like and if we\nthink about even the verb so if I use\nthe word distraction like who is the\nsubject of that sentence absolutely\nright so you say I tried to distract\nmyself\nwhereas what happened here is like you\ndidn't try to do anything it just\nhappened\nand so in apologies if this sounds kind\nof abstract but like engagement is\ndifferent from distraction and what we\ndid was engagement which is to genuinely\nlike take your mind and have you\nappreciate and enjoy and be in the\npresent whereas distraction is actually\nlike pushing something away engagement\nis about naturally moving towards\nsomething and distraction is about\npushing away so in a weird way like do\nyou feel like we actually even though\nthe effect is that we affected your\nanxiety did you feel like we were trying\nto do anything with anxiety\nabsolutely and that's that's the key\nbecause when you try to do something to\nyour anxiety what happens absolutely\nright so the way to overcome anxiety is\nto actually not try to fight it because\nwhat happens when you when you fight\nanxieties it creates tension in your\nmind there's a war in tension yeah fee\nis the fuel for anxiety does that make\nsense\nso anything that you combat in your mind\nwhen it comes to anxiety is just making\nit stronger and I would guess a nerf\nthat in your experience the more you\nfight the anxiety sometimes you win but\nit seems like the more you fight it the\nstronger it grows yeah right like you're\nbuilding up this wall and the more you\nbuild the wall like the higher the\nanxiety climbs and it's this really like\ncrazy unnerving it can make you feel\npowerless because you're trying so hard\nand it's like not working at all and and\nyou become desperate and you're like I\nneed to push a little bit harder I need\nto push a little bit harder I need to\nkeep it at bay and then it just gets\nworse and worse and worse and it's\nspiraling yeah so I want you guys to\nunderstand that anxiety is like cancer\nof the mind like so what cancer does is\nit takes the nutrients that your body\nhas and it grows with them and the more\nthat you fight against anxiety it's\ngonna grow based on your attention the\nmore you try to fight it the worse it's\ngonna get Anissa what do you think we\nshould do on our if how can we make you\nanxious again I wanna make you anxious\nII I don't know if I want to hmm\nI mean I'll be honest right now I'm\nfeeling yeah buddy calm I'm not sure how\nto go about making me anxious again yeah\nso so I apologize for fixing it I think\nI think this is an important\nrelationship for us to understand okay\nso like I just wanted to try to like\nreactivate it so that we could like in a\nin a more definitive and mindful way\nlike see how you can come back but it\nseems like your calmness much like your\nanxiety is like not wanting to go\nanywhere right now which I guess\nwell that's that's how it is with the\nthe breathing as well as that something\ncomes up and it gets really difficult\nand I think because I either try to\ndistract myself or fight it it sticks\naround for a lot longer because I mean I\ndidn't know that if I just calm down\nthings like find something that brings\nme back to the normal happy mood that\nit'll just go away on its own naturally\nthrough through getting rid of the\nanxiety one of the things that I want\nyou guys to stop doing is fighting your\nanxiety so like understand that your\nanxiety has a place in a role and that\nyou're gonna feel certain feelings and\nthen let just let it happen so the thing\nis like I think I think fine of fighting\nanxiety is a little bit like holding\nwater like the harder you hold the more\nthe water slips out of your finger so if\nyou want to keep like or keep uh if you\nwant to keep water in your hands an ARFF\nlike how do you do that\ncut them keep them together don't put\ntoo much chatter and then also like like\ngently right like the harder you try\nlike it's not about trying twice as hard\nit's just about sort of like creating\nand like it's sort of like being like\ngentle with it does that make sense yeah\nand so that is that's the same thing you\nneed to do with your anxieties when your\nanxiety arises like I want you to kind\nof tell yourself that okay like this is\nhappening again it's gonna happen my\nbody is used to doing this my mind is\nused to doing this we can get into why\nyour body and mind do those things but\njust sort of acknowledge that it's gonna\nhappen and also recognize that like you\nknow the more that you try to keep the\ntide at bay like the more it builds up\nbut if you let the tide roll in\neventually it's gonna do what go past\nright so like the tide comes in and it\ncomes out and remember that like just\nlike any other feeling that you have\neven if you feel anxious you can't stay\nhappy forever you can't stay sad forever\nyou can't stay anxious forever and if\nyou oddly enough like the more like you\nopen the doggy door like dog is gonna go\nin and out like and so you just let it\nin and then you let it out if you want\nto you can try to breathe a little bit\nthrough it but don't try to breathe to\ncontrol it like if you feel yourself\nbreathing fast let yourself breathe fast\nfor a little while and then let yourself\nkind of\nslow-like see even now you're doing it\nyou're practicing yeah you're practicing\nexcellent do you guys see that gel catch\nthat I've been trying actually I have\nwatched the stream a couple of times\nwhen you do the meditations and stuff\nand I've been trying that when I have\nthe sort of moments where I struggle to\nbreathe I try to go through the\nmeditations and calm myself and that's\ntypically quite well though I could be a\nlittle more consistent on how long I do\nit that's okay\notherwise so I think really the\nadvantage there is that it's not that\nyou're trying to control your breathing\nor dispel the anxiety what you're really\ndoing is engaging your mind in the\npresent like that's the advantage of\nmeditation because when you do like the\nalternate nostril breathing practice\nit's just like weird and awkward and not\nsimple enough to where your mind really\nhas to pay attention otherwise you're\ngonna get lost does that make sense and\nthat value yeah because it forces your\nmind into the present through its\ndifficulty if you guys want another just\nbrilliant exercise to bring your mind\nfully to the present and conquer all\nanxiety are you right-handed or\nleft-handed you ready for it brush your\nteeth with your left hand I'll try that\ntonight but it's very difficult but the\nmain thing that I want you to pay\nattention to is do it when you're\nanxious and then your mind is not gonna\nhave the RAM to be anxious if you brush\nyour teeth with your non-dominant hand\nbecause it's just gonna be so hard that\nlike you can't think about anything else\nI'll give it a go tonight when I feel\nanxious hopefully I feel like just\ntonight it somehow we really come full\ncircle because I never thought on\nstreamwriter I'd hear you say hopefully\nI'll be anxious tonight that's that's\nletting the tide in and letting it come\nout right\nso when you say bizarrely enough\nhopefully I'll be anxious tonight you're\nnot fighting a war with anxiety anymore\nI mean if it gives me some other way to\ndeal with it too\nthat's that's beneficial in the long run\nso if I can try it and learn from it\nthat'll help and if it doesn't work I\ncan come to you tell you didn't work and\nyou absolutely so I think that actually\nillustrates a fantastic principle in it\nwhich is that this is about like it's\nnot about right\nanswers from me and this is why I think\nyou should ignore what doctors tell you\nand when I tell I mean not like ignore\nmedical advice but you know like don't\nset your compass to what your doctors\ntell your even I tell you like this is\nabout what works for you and you have to\ntest it for yourself right you have to\nsee like what works for you there are\nthings that I'm gonna be right about and\nthere are things that I'm gonna be wrong\nabout I'm not like I'm I'm Nishant so I\nthink it's awesome that you're thinking\nabout really like trying this stuff for\nyourself and you're meditating from time\nto time and you're figuring out what\nworks and what doesn't so now so that\nwas kind of a quick primer on breath\nanxiety and sort of how to think about\nanxiety the other sort of dimension of\nanxiety that I want to talk a little bit\nabout is that in my experience anxieties\nactually learned behavior so I think\nwhat happened in your case is that like\nwhen you were like made fun of in school\nyour brain actually did something very\nimportant which is that it recognized\nthat when people are looking at me I'm\nin danger does that make sense yeah and\nthen what happened is like it learned\nthat lesson and it's still like it\nlearned that lesson so now it's part of\nyour programming so anytime people look\nat you you feel like you're in danger\nit's really oddly enough it's that\nsimple so one of the crazy things about\nanxiety is I think like sure it's an\nillness and it causes suffering but I\nthink it's important to remember that\nyour brain is not broken your brain is\njust doing what it knows how to do and\nunfortunately sometimes it does things\nthat are maladaptive like your brain is\njust trying to protect you from danger\nbecause some part of you like it when\nwhen you feel judged by random people on\nthe street it's because your brain\nremembered that you used to get judged\nby other people and that getting judged\nis dangerous and bad so let's go home\nwhere no one can see you so what is your\nbrain actually doing there I guess as\nyou said it's trying to protect me and\nprepare me for whatever the outcome may\nbe so oddly enough I want you to rethink\nyour anxiety and this helps you to form\na truce with it is understand that your\nanxiety is like it's like a pit bull\nthat doesn't know what's dangerous\nand what isn't it's like a blind pitbull\nso like it can't see anyone but like it\nknows someone's in the room and it's\ndefault mode is to like attack and what\nyou really need to do is like calm down\nthe pitbull and like understand that the\npitbull is there for reason it's not\ntrying to screw you over it's really\njust trying to protect you because when\nyou when you retreat from the outside\nworld and you go home like how do you\nfeel Kong's come yeah right so that's\nyour brain like trying to help you out\nand it just doesn't understand that it's\ndoing a bad job because it's like it's\nlike a reflex\nso tell me any any questions from you\nwell I'm wondering so so so when you get\ninto these situations is there something\nyou can sort of I mean I guess this\nmight be a little situational for me\nspecifically or other people but is\nthere something you can tell the pitbull\nsomething you can do to actively like\nshould I say just don't worry about it\nthey're probably not thinking that you\nknow something that negative so if you\nsay don't worry about it they're\nprobably not thinking something negative\nis that making a truce with or fighting\na war with your anxiety I guess kind of\na planning work because see like for\nmyself typically I I put myself into\ntheir shoes again and I say to myself\nyou know normally I'm not looking at\nsomeone and immediately judging\neverything about them I don't know them\nit's not my problems so I try to think\nthat that's that's the other person -\nthey looked at me maybe they just\nglanced my way they they think nothing\nof it so I try to keep that as my\nmentality when I start feeling hurried\nabout social I think you're you're using\nlogic right you're using rational\nthinking to combat your feeling of fear\nthat reacts sometimes so like but that\nis I think fundamentally creating\ntension in fighting a war so I think\noddly enough if you want it like how do\nyou calm down a blind pit bull that's\nupset that someone is in the room give\nit a give it a treat so I think that's\nmaybe like distraction or playing a\nvideo game what else can you do\nyeah introduce it sure's and maybe do\nyou have dogs\nmy sister has two so how do you calm\ndown dogs that are upset like does she\nactually just pull out a treat every\ntime they freak out\nnow I mean one of them is very energetic\nso we just kind of pull them to the\ncorner and hold on to him and try to you\nknow go okay okay hold on you're\nglossing over the the juicy part how do\nyou try to calm him down\noh yeah we pull him somewhere else we\nbring him somewhere else and sort of\ntake his mind off of whatever case\nthat's like going home so we're gonna\nsteer clear of that solution for a\nminute well again we typically just the\nbest way of doing it is kind of like\nyanking on her and hold on so you're\ndoing it you're glossing over the good\npart how do you comfort her we talk to\nher come there we go right so that's\nwhat you need to do to your anxiety you\nneed to say hey buddy I know you're\nfreaking out right now and I know that\nyou're like like I know that you're\nscared and I know that you think that\nwe're in danger but actually this is the\nmailman he comes every day and and you\nknow like I understand that you're\nfeeling the way that you're feeling but\nlike hey why don't we just calm down a\nlittle bit it's not that you're wrong\nit's just that like this is not actually\nthe situation that you instinctively\nthink it is and let's remember that when\nwe're walking around and we look at\nsomeone we have to look somewhere and if\nwe're walking down the street we're\ngonna generally be looking at people\nahead of us and we're gonna have to see\npeople yeah right but like I think it's\nimportant to be like compassionate\ntowards yourself and like be\nunderstanding and try to calm that calm\nthat anxiety down by like petting it you\nknow and sort of like being kind to it\nand sort of acknowledging that hey like\nthis is the tide rolling in you're like\nyou're allowed to like you know ruin our\nsandcastle but at some point you're\ngonna you're gonna kind of go back out\nand so let the anxiety rise within you\ntry to be calm towards it don't try to\ncalm yourself down this is very\ndifferent like these are two very\ndifferent things don't force it down\nwhich is what calming yourself down is\nbe calm towards your anxiety and\nacknowledge that oh like this is you\nfreaking out like I understand that this\nis like a protective mechanism that's\narising within me but I also know that\nthis mechanism isn't entirely\nappropriate or is my anxiety action\nlike is it picking up on something so\nyou can sort of be like okay like what\nare you concerned about and think\nthrough it for a minute like is this\nperson like is there someone who's like\nwalking behind me who's like kind of\ncreepy you know like because because\nremember that anxiety and as someone\nyou're very empathic so you pick up a\nlot like even when I fake a facial\nexpression you're able to tell what's\nunderneath the facial expression so I\nthink the odd thing about your anxiety\nis you may be picking up stuff that\nother people don't pick up and you may\nactually be right so I think the other\nreally scary thing is that if there's\nit's possibility that people are judging\nyou great how does that make you feel\nwell I mean if I'm right it might be\neasier to sort of I guess kind of\nunderstand where they're coming from if\nI felt the same thing at times so if my\ngoal is to understand and calm my\nanxiety rather than myself then it might\nbe easier to just push aside their their\ntheir opinions or whatever into yeah\nabsolutely right so the other cool thing\nabout anxiety is like what you're doing\nis you're trying to tell it that it's\nwrong but the other thing that you can\ntell it is not that it's wrong but that\nit's not as important as you think it is\nlike you're right but it just happens to\nbe that I'm never going to see this\nperson again so even if they are judging\nme like okay who cares right and as you\nstart to grow in confidence and things\nlike that that's gonna get easier\nthat make sense yeah other questions\ncan't think of any right off the top of\nmy head now okay okay so you said that\nis it okay if we kind of switch gears\nfor a little bit or we s we've been\ntalking for about 45 minutes but are you\nopen to talking for maybe about 15-20\nminutes longer yeah sure so the other\nthing that I want to kind of dive into\nis sort of the roots of anxiety and\nremember how I was saying that like\nanxiety is a learned behavior so for a\nlot of people disarming their anxiety\ngoes to sort of the root of where their\nanxiety formed and kind of like\nprocessing that\nso you say that you've always been\nconcerned about how other people are\njudging you or you'll always sort of\nremember being anxious for the most part\nyeah and you help me understand like\nwere there things that that happened\nwhen you were younger like so it sounds\nlike bullying was a big part of it we're\ngetting picked on were there other\nthings that sort of happened that you\nthink sort of taught you that the world\nis a dangerous place and that judgment\nis bad I grew up with a very religious\nand somewhat closed-minded grandmother\nso that may have affected things she was\nI don't wanna say she's a very positive\nperson growing up she was a little more\nnegative so I think she was somewhat\njudgmental of others and very concerned\nwith with people we spent time with\ngrowing up my sister and I were raised\nby our grandmother because my my parents\ndivorced when I was very young so we\nwere raised by her in a very religious\nhousehold people we were friends with\nshe was very particular about pretty\nmuch anything we did who we spent time\nwith in that kind of thing so I think I\ngrew up in an atmosphere where judgment\nwas quite normal and she was British and\nI think showing emotion and stuff is not\nreally common in a British household I\nthink so that that may have been\ndifficult as well when I didn't know how\nto bring up what I was feeling or\nsomething for fear that she might\nmisunderstand or or it just seemed\nuncomfortable I guess what was\nuncomfortable about it it was just not\nsomething that we discussed often I\nguess the personal feeling someone oh it\nwasn't a huge topic of discussion in my\nhousehold and so can you give me an\nexample of like how your mom was I mean\nyour grandmother was sort of you\nmentioned like kind of close-minded\njudgmental like very concerned about who\nyou hung out with like can you I'm sure\ndo you mind sharing an example about\nthat well my best friend is a lesbian am\ni grown there was very against that\nmentality that that that that you know\nthat type of person she's I never\nmentioned it to my grandmother for that\nreason is because I'm worried of how\nshe'll she'll react if she'll be upset\nbecause she's not my best friend since I\nmean I've known my best friend for about\n20 years so my grandmother knew her when\nwe were we were we little kids at school\nso it was sort of a secret yeah so what\nare you afraid of\nso it sounds like you're not you haven't\nshared this with your grandmother what\nare you afraid of what are you afraid of\nI guess disapproval I obviously very\nmuch care about my grandmother and her\nopinions and how she feels about things\nand obviously my best friend is one of\nthe most important people in my life so\nI don't want there to be a rift or if my\nbest friend for example sometimes I'll\ninvite her to Christmas dinners\nThanksgiving dinners and if my grandma\nfound out about this there's a chance\nmaybe she would just say no not allow\nher to come out anymore so I'd prefer to\nkind of keep things from being hostile\nso it sounds like you're I'm gonna need\na second sure you're very good at hiding\nyep I'm pretty good at keeping all the\nthings about myself that I want to keep\nprivate I keep them private well I think\nmaybe a defense mechanism I'm not sure\nbut my goodness that sounds very Rodian\nyeah so yeah that's what II do you so\nyou also hide a fair amount on stream\nright I'd say so yeah there's you know I\nI want my stream environment to be\nsomething that's that's happy and\npositive as well so when I stream I want\nother people to feel good not upset so\nif I if I have any issues in my life the\nstream is a place I can go to not\nnecessarily ignore them but be happy and\nkind of forget it a little bit till I go\nback to reality I guess off stream so\nit's it's like a happy place to go what\ndo you think about that I think it's\nnice sometimes if you're overwhelmed by\nsomething to have somewhere you can go\nlike it's maybe not the best thing to\njust kind of push things aside but I\nmean if I'm feeling overwhelmed it's\nnice to have people to talk to laugh\nwith kind of focus on them if they have\nissues instead of just on myself and if\nI can help\nmaybe it'll give me ideas for how I\ncould help myself if they have similar\nyou know similar issues in their life so\nI think what we're running across is\nthat streaming is actually like a coping\nmechanism for you does something I think\nthe challenge you know the problem with\ncoping mechanisms is if you use one you\nknow you know what you have to do the\nnext day work on the issues you that's\nthe problem right is working on your\nissues is different from coping so like\ncoping implies that like you're like\ncovering up or like you know\ndecompressing like something but then\nyou're still hiding so what I'm what I'm\nconcerned about for you and RF is\nactually that like I don't know I think\na lot of you mentioned early on that you\nhave some anxiety about life I think the\nanxiety is rooted in some kind of\ninauthenticity it's possible yeah what\nare you what are you hiding like what\nare you what are you hiding about\nyourself from yourself\nthat's that's kind of a tough one to\nunderstand I feel like it's a really\nlarge thing I guess to some degree I'm\nnot I don't like I'm not satisfied with\nmyself entirely which i think is a lot\nof where the confidence issue comes as\nwell as that I have a family that's\nfairly accomplished as people and I'm I\nmean I'm still young but I feel like I\ncould have gotten more out of life thus\nfar I feel like I do a lot of things\nthat I really enjoy but I still feel\nlike there's a lot more I could do so\nmaybe I expect too much of myself or I\nput too much pressure on myself so I\nwant you to notice what you're doing\nthere that's you're fighting a little\nwar in your own head you see that yeah\nthat's not good\nbecause I think what's happened is\nyou've gotten so it's become so in\nsiding has become so instinctive for you\nthat you do it all the time and then you\nkind of like try to justify you're\ntrying to justify me you're trying to\nlike you're trying to be like\nencouraging like a friend like you're\ntrying to reassure yourself that oh like\neven though you feel like a failure\nyou're not really a failure right you\nyou like reassure yourself and you say\nthat you're and by the way you can tell\nme to go [ __ ] myself at any point and\nalso we can stop at any point but I'm\nconcerned that what what's actually\ngoing on is like you try to you try to\nlike pep yourself up and you you you\nfeel some degree of like you're not\nmaybe you haven't lived up to the\nexpectations that you set for yourself\nyou haven't lived up to the perceived\nexpectations of your family and at the\nsame time you kind of tell yourself oh\nlike I am having lots of fun though but\nthat feels kind of fake to me\nmm-hmm does it feel fake to you I mean\nthe fun part it's ya know it does it's\nhard to really understand how I even\nfeel about these things honestly I've\nnever fully tried to so you guys know\nwhat's with it know it's hard for you to\nunderstand because you're so good at\nhiding that might be it yeah\nso you're trying to detect yourself but\nyour self levels like a hundred so like\nand so if you really want to understand\nyourself you have to start by like\nrecognizing that like there's a part of\nyou there's a part of your mind that's\njust really good at stealth mm-hmm and\nyour my guess is that part of your\ndirectionless 'no siz because you're\nkind of trying to move forward but like\nyou're not quite sure where to start and\ni think that you you have lots of good\nideas but the problem is like you're not\nsure if the i-i think i imagine you have\na lot of good ideas cuz it's clear to me\nthat you're very smart but i think the\nchallenge here is that you don't know if\nthe idea is gonna move you in the\ndirection that you want to move like i\nthink you're good at figuring out right\nyeah this will get me from point A to\npoint B this will get me from point A to\npoint C but the challenge is you don't\nknow if you want to go to point B or you\ndon't want to go if you want to go to\npoint C so yeah that's a challenge is\nnot one of capability it's one of\ndirection so you know where Direction\ncomes from from your somewhere right\nlike so the question is like what do you\nwant to do see I I don't know that's the\nthat's that's where the confusion comes\nfrom is that I feel like that's a\nsomething that maybe doesn't weigh on\neverybody my age but it's the future is\nyou know that's that's a long time to\nthink about that's I don't want to I\ndon't want to go in a direction that's\nbad for me I don't know necessarily what\ndirection will make me happier or I mean\nthe hiding thing probably I try to just\navoid thinking about it and kind of\ngoing from you know one thing together\nas you said in just something that seems\nlike accessible arn or if I want to\ncommend you for streaming because I\nthink the challenge here is that I think\nat times in your life you've known what\nyou wanted to do but you haven't let\nyourself want to do it well to be honest\nstreaming was one of those things a long\ntime ago that I wanted to do a lot more\nof and got sort of afraid of it and at\none point or another I just sort of\nhunkered down and said okay just click\nthe go live button start doing this\nconsistently and yeah\nwhere he goes and I think it has that's\nwhat I mean so I think streaming is a\ngood idea but I wonder like I'm\nimagining living in a house with your\ngrandmother and you being like 15 or 16\nyears old and you actually knowing at\nsome point when other people are\nfiguring things out like you're like hey\nI think I want to do this but then you\nreflexively recognize that that's not an\nacceptable answer and so you go back\ninto self and you've been you've been\nstealth for so long that you don't even\nknow how to find yourself a what yeah\nthat's right though I I don't think I've\never really had a specific path that I\nwas really interested in I grew up I\nwanted to be a chef for a long time\nI love I love cooking I like the idea of\nlike learning about food and alcohol -\nover the last few years I've had some\nexperiences going through really nice\nbars experiencing the creative side of\nthese things has always been really\nintriguing to me I don't love the idea\nof working in a kitchen which was one of\nthe things that really deterred me from\nprogressing for the I took a very brief\nI took a culinary arts program once very\nbriefly and I I discovered that the\nkitchen atmosphere itself was not\nappealing to me and then so I think my\nlife has been split in two interests\nthat are really that are kind of very\ndistant from each other in a sense I\nreally love gaming I love eSports I love\nthe idea of streaming and whatnot and\nI've always kind of thought that that\nwould be better as a as a hobby\nsomething as you said as well as like\nmaybe a coping mechanism outside of real\nlife I get something that kind of just\nis a distraction I guess and then my\ninterest in food and the culinary arts I\nguess is something else that's always\nreally interested me but I don't know\nhow to like which one I'm more\ninterested in which one is more pursuing\nthe gaming would be better as a hobby\nwhere did you learn that I don't really\nthink it's something that I've learned\nso much as it's it's always been that\nthing that has been the hobby for me so\nI'm a little afraid of creating a job\nout of it and getting tired of it and\nnot having something that I would want\nto fall back on to like something that's\nthere is a yeah so let's let's be clear\nthere's a difference between a good idea\nand what you want\nmm-hmm so I think you're probably so you\nsmiled when I said that so I think you\nunderstood something that I'm trying to\ntell you and what am I trying to tell\nyou yeah right and a lot of people are\nvery passionate about it my friends who\nare involved in gaming any sports and I\nguess for the most part the ones that I\ndo know haven't really gotten sick of\ngaming because they work in the industry\nbut I guess that's always a fear of mine\nis that if I worked in the industry or I\ndid things that related to gaming I\nmight get so yes so remember what was so\nbut enough what's your problem is it\nthat is it success or direction\ndirection\nwhat is your reason to not go into the\ngaming industry is it success or\ndirections honestly for one it's well\ndirection I'd say mostly I mean maybe\nsuccess but I think is what I'm hearing\nwhat I'm hearing is that you're afraid\nit may not work or what I'm not hearing\nis like as what you're telling me is I\nlike gaming I'm interested in gaming\nI've always liked gaming I've always\nbeen a nerd and what I'm well yeah but\nit's for me it's one it's it's the fear\nof back in I guess about four years five\nfive years ago or so I got hired at riot\nand then I was denied the visa to work\nthere I'm Canadian and it's it's not\neasy to get into gaming necessarily\nwhere I live or or have the option for a\nvisa or something like that where I live\nso I kind of I accepted that I guess and\njust wanted to focus on something else\nand the other passion I had was cooking\ndrinks whatever so I thought maybe I\ncould lead towards that or something but\nI think it always has been a confusion\nI've been very yes and I think I\nunderstand why you're confused because I\nthink what you're doing is you're\nconfusing in your own mind what you want\nwith what you think you can achieve and\nthat leads to a hell of a lot of\nconfusion so this is really important to\nunderstand there's a lot of peace and\nstrength and confidence in knowing that\nyou want something and also\naccepting that you can't have it but\nyou're not doing that what you're doing\nis you're saying because this is hard\nI'm not gonna let myself want it and so\nyou're stuck in limbo because you're not\nallowed to fail because you're not\nallowed to try because you made you're\nafraid that you won't be successful and\nso you're kind of like you're in limbo\nlike I don't think you're I think you\ncall it confuse but really what I'm\ndetecting from you is like limbo you're\njust like floating without any like\nyou're not confused you're just like\nstuck outside of some gravitational\norbit and just floating in space and not\ngoing anywhere\nso I think the first thing that you've\ngot to do is like understand what it is\nthat you want in divorce in your mind\nwhether it's a good idea or a bad idea\nthere are things that you want to do\nlike there's something that I want to do\nwhich i think is a terrible idea so I\nwant to hold another retreat for video\ngamers and I just want to do it like I\nwant to rent a house for 10 days or like\na farm so I was talking to someone about\nthis and they're like yeah get a farm\nand like don't get a house get a farm\nand I want to tell the Internet that if\nyou're struggling in life in your game\nor just show up and we'll figure it out\nand like I don't know if no one's gonna\nshow up or 20 people are gonna show up\nor 50 people are gonna show up I don't\nknow if someone's gonna show up with\nlice like that's a problem like there\nare all kinds of reasons why this is a\nbad idea but the fact that it's a bad\nidea has nothing to do with whether I\nwant to do it or I don't want to do it\ndoes that make sense and I think what\nyou're doing like I want you to really\nthink about this and let me know I mean\nit can be hard but I would encourage you\nto actually go back and watch this\nbecause I think what you're doing is\nyou're confusing what you want with what\nyou think is a good idea and those are\ncompletely different\nI honestly I'm not entirely sure if I\nknow what I want yeah honestly like it's\nlike you do because I think anytime you\nget a vet like anytime you have a little\nsprout of a want what happens is you're\njudgmental you're highly accomplished\nfamily your set of values and what is\nworth it or not worth it steps in and\nsquashes it okay sounds great so then\nlike of course you don't know what you\nwant because you haven't let it grow\nright like you judge it based on its its\nlikelihood of success and then you\nthat's the that's the beginning and end\nof the discussion so it's like either\neither you you know Culinary Academy or\nlike like is it like what is it like\nmedical school engineering like what are\nthe things like you just want to be a\nlawyer as a kid but I didn't think so so\nthis is where you've got to be careful\nbecause you've been conditioned by your\nfamily too and you're not you're not\nallowing yourself to like want the\nthings that you want and so the little\nvestiges of what you want you know like\nthe ones that didn't scale up stealth at\nlevel one got squashed and so the only\nones that have been allowed to grow are\nthe ones that skilled up stealth and\nthen every time they level up if they\nget caught they get destroyed by your\njudgmental mind so they have to like\nlevel up stealth and then we end up with\nstealth stealth 100 and then you're\nscratching yourself and you're like I\ndon't know what I want I mean that\nsounds pretty accurate to me okay well\nunfortunately I don't have as simple of\na fix for you as your anxiety when it\ncomes to this you know I think you know\nI would really think about reflecting or\nwriting or seeing a therapist there are\na lot of different things that you can\ndo I mean do you have a sense of like\nhow you can get started and\nunderstanding what you want maybe what\nare you thinking I guess like the thing\nthat I I feel like I kind of want two\ndifferent things I and I feel like one\nis a little less accessible so I'm sort\nof leaning towards the other thing and\nit's it's something that I'm working\ntowards it's just\nI guess I still have some doubt in my\nmind but I guess I need to work on one\nof these I forget which eSports team I\nthink Philly fusion they've got a\nprofessional chef right yeah no but most\nof the teams do have confessional chefs\nbut again there is for me with gaming\nit's always been a big concern of visas\nor something like that I don't know how\naccessible they are living in Canada\nmight make things more difficult if\nthey've got someone in the US who's\nreally easy to get ahold of then why\nwould they take someone from Canada why\nwould they spend the money on the visa\nthat kind of thing so I think it's it's\ndoubt that I've let kind of overwhelm me\nand sort of deter me from pursuing\nsomething like that yeah that makes\nsense I think I think doubt is a big\nproblem right so it's the chance of\nsuccess that's preventing the low chance\nof success that you perceive that's\npreventing you from trying which is a\nreally really paralyzing way to live\nlife right so like you're falling into\nsomething called the planning fallacy\nwhich is that you're making a plan and\nthen you're choosing to act based on the\nsuccess of that plan you know what the\nproblem with that is when do we make\nplans before the and so yeah so how good\nis your plan at the beginning versus at\nthe end I mean my the majority of my\nfamily works for the government that\nkind of thing so there their mentality\nis even if you don't love your job at\nleast it's stable at least it's you know\nsensible yes and then do things that you\nwant to do on this so I think that's\nfine but then at least you have to be\nhonest remember what I was saying\nearlier that like you have to be honest\nwith what you want it's it's one thing\nto be honest about what you want and to\ngive it up it's another thing to not let\nyourself want it because you don't think\nit's viable right so like does that make\nsense to you and so I think what you're\nthe problem is that you're sort of\nforming a plan but like when you try\nsomething you're gonna learn all kinds\nof things along the way that you didn't\nexpect like well as I said right now I\nam I'm working towards some sort of\ndiscuss it on streem because I'm kind of\ndon't there's no people who live in my\ncity who make me uncomfortable but I'm\ntaking a class for something that\nis one of the things that is really\ninterested we don't want for a long time\nso I figure I kind of just figured screw\nit if it'll work for me I'm working I\njust started a job yesterday that has to\ndo with this thing so I'm I'm\nprogressing towards something that I've\nput off for a long time and sort of had\ninterest in and just didn't want to do\nit for here of it so you're doing it all\nright so like I think the most important\nwords that you just said out of\neverything that you just said is the two\nwords\nscrew it I'm just gonna do it that's\nthat's what you want to do right and if\nwe think about like gamers like what\nkeeps them stuck it's their inability to\nsay screw it like if you're you know if\nyou there's someone that you have a\ncrush on and you're like afraid they're\ngonna reject you like in order to move\nforward you've got to say screw it and\nyou've got a truck yeah you've got to\nopen yourself up for failure and that's\nlike that's the problem is that people\nare not willing to say I mean like this\nwhole stream started because one day I\nsaid people told me like if you if you\ngo online and you start talking to\npeople about their feelings like you\ncould get sued and so I've disclaimers\nand stuff but like yeah I could get\nscooped suit they're like all kinds of\nreasons why this is a bad idea like it's\na bad idea to do this and I think it's\nthe right thing to do so I'm saying\nscrew it and I'm doing this and I love\nit\nlike this is fun for me and I think it's\ngreat that you're saying screw it and I\nthink the more that you say that I think\nthe better off you'll be but you know\ndon't go overboard obviously like but\nyeah I mean I think that's not the\nconcern I think your your pragma your\nyour you know your personality spectrum\nis so far in the pragmatic side that you\ncan let leak like you can let loose and\nyou're still not going to cross like the\n50 percent you know you're still you're\nstill gonna be pragmatic in the way that\nyou do things and I'm sure that you've\ndone a lot even though you've said screw\nit I would bet money that you've done a\nlot of calculation about what you're\ndoing and you've optimized your chances\nof success I mean that's why I'm taking\na course for it and what not to learn it\nbefore I kind of dive into the deep end\nof it so okay so thanks a lot Anna I\nthink we'll turn things I don't know\nsometimes people may have questions for\nyou so let's kind of actually turn to\nquestions if that's okay do you have\nactually do you have questions before we\nkind of switch switch gears\num any less I think I think I'm good I\nthink I'll get on the questo case for\nnow I think of anything I'll hit you up\nso we're gonna see I'm gonna ask twitch\nchat if people have thoughts or\nquestions for either you or me and then\nif not if no one has questions for you\nthen we'll sort of end the call if\nthat's okay so if people are asking\nfirst like what's your scream schedule\nwell right now I'm taking school classes\nso most of the time I'll stream Sunday\nnights Tuesday nights Monday nights\nmostly nighttime when I'm done classes\nso most days of the week I'm gonna be\nworking Friday and Saturday nights so\nfor the foreseeable future at this sort\nof new job that I started so I'm not\ngonna be streaming then but every other\nnight of the week I try my best to get a\nstream in here and there so that I can\nsort of you know have something positive\nin my life that makes me feel great so\nit sounds like most weeknights so that's\nawesome and then so domination time asks\nregarding coping versus dealing with\nissues when should when should we do\ncoping coping must have some good\npositive functions right absolutely so\nremember that like coping is a band-aid\nso when you're feeling like you can't\nsolve the root of your problem like all\nthe time so as a human being your mind\nlike you need some way to function so\nlike it's fine for us to talk about you\nknow Anna's like how she doesn't know\nwhat she wants in life and how her\ndesires have like a high stealth to hide\nfrom her grandmother and all that good\nstuff and at the end of the day like on\na day-to-day basis like she can't she\ncan't tackle that problem so she has to\nthe feelings that that bring up in terms\nof anxiety or confusion like in order\nfor her to apply to whatever school\nthinks she's got or apply for a job or\ngo to work or stream she's got a like\ntable that existential dread you know\ncan I just say as well actually the last\nbit of this conversation has been\nsomething that I wanted to avoid\nbringing up because it makes me kind of\nscared so the fact that you got it out\nof me I normally I probably would just\ntry to veer off and talk about something\nelse or cut the conversation short but\nI mean I figured it'd be better for\nmyself my mental state the stream as\nwell maybe to discuss it and kind of\nlearn to deal with it I guess and so\nfrom what I'm gonna translate that anta\nso what you're saying is that you\nunclick the Stealth button and you're\nvisible for a few moments it's dangerous\nright because now you can be targeted oh\nmy goodness you're out in the open yes\nso much danger but I mean that's it's\nwhy I started streaming it's kind of why\nI came on here it's why I've started\ndoing what I've been doing lately I'm\njust kind of trying to get out of here I\nguess I really commend you for that I\nthink it's like the opening ourself up\nto like like stepping out of our\nprotective safe zone I think is really\nthe first step to changing your life and\nso I really commend you for doing that\nand yeah it looks like so I'm going to\njust go back to Tom's questions so you\nknow so like I was saying like so you\nhave to cope in the moment so like if\nyou you know let's say that you lose a\nloved one in your grieving and you have\nto go to work the next day like I think\nit's completely reasonable to use coping\nmechanisms to sort of shove those\nfeelings down or like decompress those\nfeelings a little bit but at the end of\nthe day I think the problem is that\ncoping makes you feel better but it\nnever solves the problem and so people\nwithout being very thoughtful about it\nstart to rely on coping more and more\nand more and more and more because\nthat's what helps them feel better like\nin the moment and then over time like\nyour problems never get solved because\nyou think that coping is like because\ncoping does help but it doesn't fix it\nit's just like a band-aid so and\nsometimes like let's remember that like\nband-aids have their place in society\nright like band-aids are good for us\nlike we need band-aids sometimes but\ndon't confuse a band-aid with actually\nlike the healing that goes on underneath\nand both of those have their role so let\nme see were there so are you following\nto a chat and I also do you think that\nthere are other I mean other questions\n[Music]\nI'm not seeing any necessarily saying\nthat\nhe's gonna use a heroin to continue to\ncope maybe I'll give it a go don't use\nheroin boys and girls I'm kidding I\nwould a bad drug okay so I'm not seeing\na whole lot of questions so I'm gonna go\nahead and hop off the call on RF and\nthen we'll go ahead and transition and\nif people want to like populate with\nquestions we'll kind of come back to\nthose in a second okay okay thanks a lot\nfor coming on in thank you for having me"
