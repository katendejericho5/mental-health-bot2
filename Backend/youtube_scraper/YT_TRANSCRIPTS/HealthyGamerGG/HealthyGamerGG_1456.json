    "transcript": "there we go there he is yeah okay\nnow that in combination over here now we\ngot to get you on this I have a very\nspecial\nwhere I put it\nand if you're getting reverb I have my\ngaming headset that I can put on no way\nawesome\nshould I just plug that in last time\nthere was reverbs it might be again if\nit's the same setup\nI think we've improved every we're\nlearning more Devon\noh god don't tell me about it how have\nyou I installed this thing called VST\nhost okay and then I have a I have like\na Yamaha mixer oh [ __ ] and so we're like\nupgrading and I'm learning how to do\nthis thing called streaming what's it\nlike to have like 10,000 IQ dude like it\ntook me like two years to figure out oh\nso definitely let's be clear when we say\nwhen I say we're doing this stuff\nsomeone who knows how to do this stuff\nis doing it for me got it okay window\ncapture\nso like literally I watched a YouTube\ntutorial and and set up this set up this\nstuff in then Tama nation time do you\nknow domination time they came by the\nchat and I think I was like in the\nmiddle of a talk so I didn't see them so\ntom has been incredibly helpful but also\nalso was I've educated myself about\ntrolls and I I think I'm vastly\nunderestimated what trolls are capable\nof yeah we had that conversation for the\nbefore did we yeah I mean I still want\nto talk to trolls on your channel and or\ntrolls on mine like I were thinking\nabout actually creating like a separate\nlike if you're a troll and you you know\nlike creating a separate email address\nthat trolls could email to come on\nstream and talk about why they troll\nthings\nI mean I'm sure you could get like a\nself-conscious one at some point the but\nlike true trolls just want to watch the\nworld burn that's the problem with them\nthere's no there's no compromising with\nthem yeah so I mean I think if you give\nthem a microphone they won't like it\nbecause that's not how they operate\nright they like they like to throw fruit\nand vegetables from the audience on the\nstage leadership man I don't know I\nthink all they want is a microphone\ninteresting thing is about attention\nthat that's like it like the only way\nthat I've found to stop them is by\nactually just ignoring them right here\nyes so we'll we'll see what we end up\ndoing well this problem it's you I mean\nI I would like to talk to trolls though\nyeah I'm curious because I think you're\nright like they want to watch the world\nburn so the question is why do they want\nto watch the world burn like what's\nwhat's important about that to them\num do you know a do you know a dude\nnamed Jordan Peterson yeah he probably\nhas the best view on this because he's\nprobably encountered the most amount of\ntrolls and his theory is that it's it's\na\nexpression of an inner hatred of the\nworld as a result of like a really nice\nview on things so it's like you hate\nyour own existence and lack of purpose\nso much that you despise anybody that\nhas yeah so I mean didn't we talk about\nthat last time we talked about trolls\nlike why are people trolling you know we\ndidn't cover that I thought we did I\nthought we said I thought I mentioned\nthat I think the reason you're getting\ntrolled is because you're doing\nsomething with your life and that\noffends them and that they say that\npeople come to your stream in order to\nmake substantial positive changes in\ntheir life and that's what I think\nthat's consistent with what Jordan\nPeterson says because you guys are in\nthe search for meaning and they they've\nhad trouble finding meaning so anyone\nwho is building what they have looked\nfor and not found it really hurts them\nit affects their ego yeah you said you\ntell them the truth you don't want to\nhear since your message is one of\nempowerment of agency over your life\nwhat invites the most hatred is meeting\nthe person that you want to be that's\ngood\nyeah that's pretty cool that's that's a\nthat's pretty neat so you've been you've\nbeen like moving forward with the whole\nstreaming thing in the week that we've\nor two weeks or whatever that we've been\nnot yeah so I think we've been streaming\nwe've had a couple people on and it's\nbeen fun I enjoy talking to people I had\nmy first like kind of challenging\ninterview because I think someone came\non stream and like didn't really know\nwhy they wanted to come on stream or\ndidn't really know what was wrong\nand so it was kind of like they were\nbeing super vague and so it was really\nchallenging because I think that they\nlike sense that something was missing\nfurther from their life but they didn't\nknow what it was or how to articulate it\ndoes not usually take a really long time\nin therapy to like build that up because\nyou have to understand that first you\nhave to understand why they're there or\nthey yes they are there so I mean we did\nit in half an hour\n[Music]\nbut but it was challenging I mean I\ndidn't know if we would you know if we'd\nget there because it was it was tricky\nbut it's it's been fun to you know talk\nto a lot of people and and see how\nthings are going good man and reaching\nout to people hopefully helping some\npeople so as the majority of what you're\ndoing\nstill direct one-on-one type of therapy\nbasically and then using that as an\nexample for how other people can follow\nit or are you doing more yes oh I think\nI think so first of all to be clear it's\nnot therapy and I can't dispense medical\nadvice over the internet but so I think\nwhat I do is just talk to people and so\nusually my stream like I stream for like\ntwo hours at a time and I may have like\na little intro where all I kind of talk\na little bit about what we've talked\nabout or if I just have thoughts that\nI'd like to share with the universe and\nthen we usually do like an interview\nthat the last 45 minutes to an hour and\nit'll be on different kinds of topics\nand so it's just that that's based on\nlike what people you know want to talk\nabout so last last week we had someone\nfrom rise above the disease or\ndisheartened disorder sorry\ncrystal Navarro yeah I know crystal so\ncrystals Jason crystal versus Jason dr.\nJason that was the guy that I want to\nconnect you with last week oh yeah yeah\nyes there's him doc yeah so so it's\nfunny actually someone at the conference\nthat I was at I was at a conference this\nmorning and yeah a conference about like\ntechnology in in in healthcare and\nsomeone there also wanted me to connect\nto me it wanted to connect me with with\nJason as well I could totally do I'm on\nthe board of rice gets this order\noh really yeah so it's a small work\nworld yeah or just a small group of\npeople that are interested in solving a\nreally big problem yeah\nperfect yeah anyway so I so she was on\nfor about half an hour we talked about\nthat a little bit and then since she had\nto go\nwe actually like switched gears and\nsomeone came on and talked about he so\nhis question is why do I date people\nthat are like my parents oh that was fun\nwe talked about that for a little while\nand then and then this other guy came on\nso usually I'll like talk a little bit\nwe'll do like an interview for about 45\nminutes and then we'll sort of do Q and\na afterward based on like stuff that\ncomes up in the interview so like do\nother people feel like they you know\nthey date like do they find themselves\ndating like the same kind of person over\nand over and over again like why is that\nand then yeah I mean so so that's\nusually the format got it okay and so\nyou and I are doing something kind of a\nlittle bit more\n[Music]\nI think since we're also like sort of\nstarting to commit to like more regular\ntalks which I am loved I love that idea\nyeah that is amazing you're very good at\nasking questions by the way oh really\nthank you really yeah you are I have a\nbig reason for that I think as I prep a\nlot like I spend a lot of time and also\nanother big reason for it is like I read\nso many books and I've listened to so\nmany podcasts and I've like done so much\nwork on trying to understand\nself-improvement that said now that I\nfinally have someone in front of me that\nit can answer all those questions it's\nlike a genie that I could just like\ncontinuously ask questions just pop\nanswers out of a freaking magic lantern\nand I'm like this is amazing like this\nis everything I've always wanted you\nknow so it's like really easy to do yeah\nI think that's good questions you asked\nquestions that capture the nuance or\nessence of things which is hard thank\nyou thank you so much that means a lot\nit's really cool I think one of the\nthings that we could do is sort of build\na over over the course of time build a\nfoundation of understanding of some of\nthese like topics and the thing that I\nwant to nail you on most of all is some\nkind of and we have to get into that\nright now because I have a couple of\nlike interest stuff but like some kind\nof\nobjective template for because here's\nwhat I was thinking about between the\nlast time we talked and now and actually\nbefore we well say that and then we\nshould probably reintroduce you the\npeople that are watching for the first\ntime they'll be a lot of those people so\nthere are going to be people who don't\nabsorb the full percentage of what you\nsay or even they're gonna give you like\na certain amount of time of day that's\nlike relevant to their attention span\nand how unjust they are in the subject\nso as much as possible we have to work\nto try to distill into a template like\nobjectively if you were going to infer\nself-improvement what are some of the\nthings that people can do and why and I\nthink once we sort of like build the\nfoundation of that understanding and and\nlike at a high level and a granular\nlevel\nit'll be really clear yeah I mean I\nthink that's that's you know that's a\nbig task so I think somewhere along the\nway like whenever I teach about\nmeditation and stuff like that people\nask me like oh this is really helpful is\nthere a book we can read and then the\nreally disappointing thing is I say no\nso there are a lot of books on a\nmeditation out there but I think the\nreal problem with a lot of dissemination\nof information is that especially in the\nmeditative world is you have teachers\nwho learn from their teachers who learn\nfrom their teachers who learned from a\nmaster and so they start following a\nscript and then they start to lose how\nthat script was made right so it's like\nit's like you're instead of\nunderstanding like equals mc-squared\nyou're just like copying and pasting\nlike iterations of that formula instead\nof understanding the basic elements that\nallow you to develop a meditative\ntradition and I don't what's so weird\nabout that is that I feel like\nmeditation is ace introspective practice\nthat I guess if you just do it will bear\nfruit but you're saying it doesn't\nunless it's technique based like if\nsomeone just starts medicine like so\nhappens is people emphasize the\ntechnique right so if you go to a\nmeditation like a particular tradition\nof meditation they're gonna say like for\nexample if you go to a Zen meditation\nthey're gonna say this is the way to\nmeditate yeah and they don't really\nacknowledge that they're like thousands\nof ways to meditate say they say this is\nour way but like the person who\ndeveloped a Zen is the one who truly\nunderstood it yeah and so what's\nhappening is like everyone else is just\nfollowing a playbook but like in order\nto really understand the stuff in order\nto do what you're talking about you have\nto be\nable to make the playbook you have to be\nable to create your own place because\nthat's when you truly understand the\npieces involved did you ever read\nSiddhartha by Hermann Hesse yeah many\nyears ago yeah there's a there's a scene\nin it where so in Sidharth this world\nBuddha already exists so Siddhartha is\ngoing through the world and meets the\nBuddha as a separate person who's\nalready become enlightened yeah and he\nsays exactly that to the Buddha he says\nthis is assuredly the absolute best path\nto reach enlightenment that can be\ntaught the problem is that because I'm\nlacking that self element I can't follow\nit you have to go find that answer for\nmyself yeah sorry I think that that's\nthe challenge right is like creating\nyou're asking - you're saying like how\ndo we distill what we're talking about\nto be like a road that people can follow\nand honestly like I think if you wanted\nso I'm working on that it's funny I sat\ndown and I actually result of the\nstreaming a lot of stuff is colas for me\nand I wrote like three pages about\nanxiety and like it's sort of like\neverything you need to understand about\nanxiety just pulled out and boil down to\nthree pages and it's like where does\nanxiety come from why do we have anxiety\nwhat are the collective physiologic\nanxiety versus cognitive anxiety how do\nhow does anxiety affect your mind in the\nmoment and where the roots of anxiety so\nif you're thinking about tackling\nanxiety you have to tackle the roots of\nit and you have to tackle the actual\nactivity like in your thought process in\nthe moment and that division is very\nfundamental and so I think you know\nthat's my goal - the other wild and\ncrazy thought that I had was that so\nI've been thinking about distilling\nstuff - and I was thinking about like\nyou know we do a lot on Twitch and we\nlike you know I think twitch chat\nappreciates what we do and that's why we\ndo it right so that people can watch and\nlearn but ultimately there's a part of\nme that says that you know you're never\ngonna learn like what you want us to do\nDevin is not gonna be possible through\ntwitch that's why we're syndicating it\nto YouTube every every talk that we do\ngoes yeah you're right well and actually\nthis is a fundamental problem with this\nplatform that I've talked about to\ntwitch a lot right and I don't know how\nyou solve it is like how do you\nhow do you convey meaningful information\nthat sticks with people and live\nsomewhere in a wide format very hard\nyeah so I had a crazy idea which is a\nlittle bit tangential to what you're\nsaying I was think so we held our first\nretreat like our healthy gaming retreat\nin August and it was a lot of fun we\nwent out to Yosemite National Park\ngamers from all over the country showed\nup and and it was it was fun and it was\nlike we I think it was like Wednesday to\nSunday and I had this idea that I'm kind\nof tempted to just like just tell the\ninternet and this is probably a terrible\nidea but just tell people that I'm gonna\nbe somewhere for ten days and if you\nguys want to learn stuff like\nlegitimately learn like show just show\nup and whoever wants to show up can show\nup and we're just gonna like work\nthrough this stuff we're gonna teach you\nhow to meditate we're gonna teach you\nabout anxiety we're gonna teach you\nabout whatever you want to learn about\nand let's like workshop like make a\nretreat where people can just show up\nand then we're gonna get through\nwhatever we want to get through and we\nsort of good go ahead\nsay there's a really interesting idea\nand that is that what if you use your\ntwitch as a lead generation in to those\nkind of events that do have that impact\nwhat is a lead generation what does that\nmean it's a marketing term that means\nthere's a if you imagine a funnel okay\nand at the top is a big circle and at\nthe bottom is a very small bigot right\nat the at the top everything sort of\nfalls into it and it gets shot out the\nthe so the top of the funnel would be\nthe way that you put ingredients in so\nif you're gonna pour water into the\nfunnel imagine water as people that need\nhelp for example yeah right all kind of\ngo down in the funnel and they end up in\nthe place you want them to be so in this\ncase the the the lead generation of mean\nbringing new people into the funnel from\none source so they can come out into\nanother source so they come in from the\nthey come in from twitch for example and\nthey come out the other end onto a\nseminar or a retreat or something that\nyou want them yeah I mean I think that's\nbecause I'm just recognizing the\nshortcomings of like just not being able\nto help everyone right so I think a lot\nof people learn from interviews and like\noh like what we're gonna talk about\ntoday and stuff but ultimately I think\nthe most transformative experiences of\nmy life have been kind of like in person\nwhere you're kind of working with\nsomeone intensely and and if people want\nto you know I don't think I think\nthey're issues of like scalability and\nstuff so I think the upside of something\nlike twitch is that you can reach way\nmore people like you know you can reach\nhundreds of people or thousands of\npeople or tens of thousands of people at\na time which you really can't do in a\nretreat but I mean I think this is a\ncrazy idea for a couple of reasons cuz\nlike it's not it's not gonna be planned\nand like I don't know who's gonna show\nup I don't know if someone's like you\nknow if they're gonna be hygiene issues\nor like if people are gonna be\nrespectful of each other and and things\nlike that like that's all problems like\nI was just thinking the other day so we\nhad a bedbug scare in our house where\nthere was like concerned that we had\nbedbugs and I have younger kids and they\npick up bedbugs from all kinds of places\nand so like I was just thinking like\nwhat if one dude like one [ __ ]\nInternet role shows up with bedbugs but\nlike lice and then like our we're gonna\nhave to like quarantine and everyone is\ngonna leave on day two because we're in\nwith disease like there's like there's\ngaming conventions of like a hundred\nthousand people that go to like PAX West\nor whatever and and have it had some\nkind of epic pandemic beyond you know\nthe flu or whatever which is miraculous\nit is yeah it makes you really think\nabout the sort of the sort of divine\nwave that there must be to to make that\nkind of stuff happen I can't believe\nsomething hasn't happened to yeah some\nmutated virus hasn't come out of a\ngaming event and killed us all yeah yeah\nin terms of in terms of twitch there's\nan interesting thing about scale is that\nyou you always have to continuously do\nthings that get you the greatest\nawareness possible because of the way\nthe scale works if you can make one\nperson's life or ten people's life fifty\npercent better you can make a thousand\npeople's lives one percent better right\nthe the right answer I think is to do\nboth but twitch is one of those\nplatforms that you can really uniquely\ndo that because there's gonna be so many\npeople that don't even you don't even\never meet by the way right because the\nvast majority of people that are in your\nchat we're not talking listening and and\nthose people will walk away with impact\nthat you may never hear about or months\nlater you'll get an email from somebody\nthat's like hey this small catalyst was\nenough for me to change X well yeah\nthat's the reason you stay on twitch\nright now\nyeah it's funny I did a reddit AMA like\na year ago and I still get messages from\npeople from it so one reason for that\nthough is because reddit lives right so\nthat that AMA still exists yes somewhere\nit actually found it I think when I was\nlooking for stuff for yeah yeah so like\nthe one problem with twitch is like once\nthat vaad goes there there isn't a no\ndies yeah right yeah\nso that's one of the reasons why I I\nthink it's really important to sort of\ndocument your whole twitch journey by\nediting every video and putting it\nsomewhere I think it's absolutely\nimperative yeah I think so far we're\ndoing that so good all of the interviews\nif you guys want it yeah so if you want\nto see I think the first meme of our\nchannel was born on today's Friday on\nWednesday and it was with us guy who was\nunclear whether he was like I think he\nwas you know I think he's just not from\nthe US so his pattern of speaking was a\nlittle bit different but there was some\nconcern that he was a troll I think it's\njust he was just speaking differently I\ndo wonder a little bit if honestly I\nwonder if he was high but you know but I\nthink it's just it's a probably just a\nforeign accent and maybe a dick thought\nfor me to have but yeah so I think where\nwe're trying to chop up videos and so\npeople can watch if there's like issues\nthat are relevant to them so we've\ntalked about self judgment we've talked\nabout we talked some about borderline\npersonality disorder we talked some\nabout you know how like what kind of\npatterns we get into when we date people\nwe talked about feelings of inadequacy\nand and kind of how to move forward so\nall that stuff is sort of being collated\nso I'm behind what you're saying man\nexcellent yeah I stayed here I got there\nYouTube pulled up I'll link it in chat\nto you guys should subscribe to this\nthere's a lot of so what are we talking\nabout today Devon well let's start off\nwith like\nso people are know from your from the\ntitle that your psychiatrist but can you\ngive like a short overview of who you\nare so for people that are new sure so\num like 60 seconds Oh\nhowever long you want yeah so ill\nconveys the message sure so my name is\nolive Kanodia I'm a psychiatrist I\npractice in Boston Massachusetts my\npractice is kind of has like two pieces\nto it I spent several years studying to\nbecome a monk before going to medical\nschool and that was actually I get\nthings I guess things start with me\nalmost failing out of college due to\nbeing addicted to video games and just\nplaying too many video games all the\ntime which oddly enough is not something\nI regret I actually had a lot of fun\nthose years and play just a bunch of\nvideo games almost failed out and then\ndecided something needed to change so I\nended up going to India the summer after\nmy sophomore year and decided then to\nbecome a monk and spent about seven\nyears coming back and forth between\nIndia in the u.s. studying yoga and\nmeditation ended up meeting my wife and\nso then that made the monk and celibacy\nthing a little bit tricky and so also\nshe wanted to be married to a doctor so\nI decided to go to medical school and\ndid did a few years of neuroscience\nresearch studied medicine and then\nultimately became a psychiatrist trained\nup here in Boston and now I'm I still\nhave a staff position at McLean Hospital\nand I'm instructor in psychiatry at\nHarvard Medical School which is where I\ntrained and most of what I do now in my\npractice is actually like holistic\npsychiatry so I incorporate meditation\nEastern medicine nutrition different\nkinds of psychotherapy and I do a lot of\nlike performance enhancement sort of\npsychotherapy so optimizing your\nperformance I work with a lot of\ninvestment bankers entrepreneurs CEOs\nNFL athletes and more recently eSports\nathletes so that's that's been a lot of\nfunds and then on the other side I've\nstarted working with gamers so half of\nmy time is spent just working with\npeople who are\nI want to say to start off with like\naddicted to video games but I think a\nlot of times there are other issues at\nplay like issues of confidence or issues\nof shame not understanding like what\nemotions are going on like not\nunderstanding their behaviors why is it\nthat they can't do anything besides play\nvideo games in the central question that\nI work with gamers on and this I think\nis the biggest problem for gamers is\nthey're very analytically intelligent\nand so they know what the right answer\nis they just can't seem to do it\nso what I really help gamers do is\nbridge the gap between like being able\nlike is that the funny thing is most\npeople don't know what to do but gamers\nknow what to do they just can't bring\nthemselves to do it and that's a lot of\nthe work that I do now and that's\nbecause at the end of the day you know\nas much as I like I enjoy working with\nmy clients and like investment banking\nand stuff I find that work engaging but\nI actually don't care about Investment\nBanking as a feel like I don't you know\nI care about gamers and I like I'm a\ngamer and I like gamers and I feel good\nwith gamers so that's who I am that's\nwhat I do\num so for for me the idea of breaching\nthat gap what we started to talk about\nlast week um intense versus manifesting\naction is the most interesting thing\nbecause it is absolutely my biggest\nproblem for sure so I have a personal\nconnection to that I get I guess where\nwe could start is how much do we\nunderstand right now about the brain and\nthe control we have over it because I\nthink when you look at neuroscience as a\nfield there's a lot of pop science I\nthink is what it's called\nwe're like people write these sort of\nbooks about it and it's like a 200-page\nthing that's like distilled from a\ncouple of studies and it ends up being a\nNew York Times bestseller that everyone\nthinks that that's the way that you\nthink about things right yeah and then\nthere's other people that are trying to\nget a little bit deeper into it like\nDaniel Kaufman or Thinking Fast and Slow\nbut like I've I don't feel like\nthe I don't feel like people really\nunderstand and I don't understand what\nwe actually know about how we can\ncontrol this thing\nbut because after a little bit of that\nthat's our mind because after a little\nbit of like exportation of it I've just\nrealized how little I seem to have power\noh yeah so I think if you want to\nunderstand your mind you have to take a\nstep back and in a weird way I think\nyou're looking for answers in the wrong\nplace okay\nso let's remember that medicine is about\npopulations right so the field of\nneuroscience tries to understand like\ndifferent parts of the brain and tries\nto figure out okay the amygdala governs\nour fear and survival response our\nfrontal lobes are the things that give\nus impulse control and allow us to plan\nand execute actions but what medicine is\nfocused on is not the individual it's\nfocused on like the common elements of\nhumans and I think the biggest challenge\nthat people face is if you're looking\nfor neuroscience to give you an answer\ninto like how you can be a more\nproductive human being I think you're\nlooking in the wrong place because\nneuroscience is about averages medicine\nis about averages so let me just give\nyou an example so do you know how we\ncame up with the 2,000 calories a day\nFDA recommendation No\nso in 1960 or 1950 there was something\ncalled the Ann Haynes study where\nbasically like the Food and Drug\nAdministration or Department of Public\nHealth I don't know I think it was the\nFDA sent out a survey to Americans and\nsaid are you healthy and what do you eat\nover the course of a week and then what\nthey did is they took all the people\nthat are healthy and they averaged what\nthey ate and they broke it down into\nlike calories carbs fat and protein and\nthey said okay this is our\nrecommendation in its 2,000 calories a\nday\nand so that's not based on any science\nand it's not based on any individuality\nit's just based on the average of what\npeople eat and so Natick all the people\nthat are healthy what does that mean so\nlike people who said I have no diseases\nthey took their answers and they\naveraged them all together and that's\nhow they came up with it huh\nsubjectively yes okay\nthey just said like are you healthy like\nyou do you take any medication do you\nhave any diseases and people who said no\nfor both of those are the ones that they\ntook their answers and they average them\naltogether and then we have a 2,000\ncalorie and a recommendation 50 years\nlater has there been silence since then\non that that people must have gone back\nand looked at it and seen if there was\nno or people just assume that that's the\nanswer that that's what we hear like\nit's crazy\nokay so like we know a lot so I can\nstudy like in this is what you have to\nunderstand is that medicine is about\naverages so when they say that like the\namygdala governs a fear response the way\nthat they do that because this is the\nway that medicine works right so they\ntake a they take 50 people and they scan\ntheir brains and they say okay we're\ngonna show 50 people like pictures of\nzombies and we're gonna see how much\npart of the brain lights up and for each\nperson their response to a zombie is\ngonna be different but then what happens\nis we drop we average all of their brain\nscans and we say okay this is the part\nthat governs fear but what you have to\nremember is that like each person is\nlike that's gonna apply poorly to any\nindividual person so any conclusion from\nmedicine is going to apply so from\nscientific research is gonna apply to\nvery few people you get that no because\nit seems to me that if you make a\nconclusion based on the average response\nto something then it would follow that\nthe average person would respond in that\nway absolute not every single person is\nbut but but the highest count that we\ncan get beautiful Devin so let me ask\nyou something if you want to develop a\nstrategy so that your intentions become\nmanifestations do you want to develop\nthat strategy based on the average\nperson or based on you\nultimately it has to be on you but you\nhave to have some kind of observational\nhypothesis first to be able to even have\nan idea of how to do it absolutely I\ncompletely agree with you so then the\nquestion becomes where does your\nobservational hypothesis come from so\nyou can I would assume studies averages\nthings like that yeah so yeah\nwhat would a yogi say\nthey would probably say to just go do it\nyourself and figure it out right yep\nyeah I think that's gonna be better all\nright so I think you can use a lot of\nneuroscience for sure I think you should\nI mean like I'm I I've studied I mean\nI'm a neuroscience researcher or not\nanymore but I used to be and so I'm a\nbig fan of neuroscience I got really\nexcited about neuroscience I think it's\nhuge but I think if you're talking about\nindividual transformation you can read\nas many studies as you want to on\nneuroscience and like all of those\nstudies are gonna be about the average\nperson they're not going to be about you\nso ultimately you can use that as a\nstarting point so like I'm not saying\nyou shouldn't use that information but\nI'm saying if you're really thinking\nabout how to transform your life like\nit's been my experience that you know\nthere's neuroscience\nthere's applied neuroscience there's\npsychology and then there's like\npsychotherapy like do you see that that\nspectrum that we're moving from like\ngeneral knowledge to individual change\nI do see that especially with the advent\nof I think more Eastern practice in the\nWest the the problem with the totally\npersonal quest is that there is no\nsounding board for it so what I mean by\nthat is there's no way for me\nindividually to tell how much control I\nhave over myself especially if I don't\nyet have control over myself so the only\nway for me to do that is to go to\nstudies or go to our understanding of\nscience to help buff at that does that\nmake sense no not at all\nso okay let me challenge that so when\nyou say that there's no sounding board\nlike so what like so let's say that you\nhave an assumption that you have 50%\ncontrol over over yourself uh-huh and\nthen you go and you read a neuroscience\nstudy about motivation like how is that\ngonna help you figure out how much\ncontrol you have over yourself like how\nis that an effective sounding board\nbecause it's the only signing board\nbecause I have no idea what my potential\nis right so if I set if I set out to\ncomplete ten things and then I complete\ntwo things and then the next day I\ncomplete four things the next day I\ncomplete know things right I have no\nidea what the hell is going on but if\nthere's a study that says on average\nhuman beings do five things at there at\nthis level once they do these practices\nI can use that as a sounding board to\nself-improve right\nI understand where your logic is I just\ndisagree with you because I think that\nthe problem here is that you're judging\nyourself based on the average person and\nlike that's not a good way to judge\nyourself but my argument would be there\nis no other way to judge yourself\noh sure there is you can just judge\nyourself purely subjectively right so\nit's not so like do you stop at five\nbecause that's the average do you stop\nat six because that's the average you're\nabove average\nyou would you would stop when you got to\nyour point but mmm okay here this might\nbe a better way to say it okay um let's\ntake something that's like more that\nthat's like less subjective like mine\nstuff let's take something like physical\nokay so we know that after like a\ncertain a certain amount of\ncardiovascular training a human being\ncan run a mile and a certain number of\nminutes right\nokay helps to know that because if you\nare doing something like an army PT test\nwhere you where you need to create an\naverage of people to perform at a\nfitness level that you know to\naccomplish certain tasks right then what\nyou do is you set up a series of studies\nthat determine what that level of\nfitness is and then you apply that\nacross an average population so maybe\nthe best example to use when we're\ntalking about averages is the army right\nwe're yeah\nso come I completely agree but let's so\nnow you're talking about a different\nthing because you're talking about a\nstandard for a population and I think is\nwhat medicine is yeah so I think if you\nwant to use a populace oh if I like\nlet's talk about like how you become\nlicensed to be a doctor so I have my own\nindividual barometer of like my\nunderstanding of medicine okay and I\ndon't think it matters how much more or\nless I know about medicine than the\naverage person like the important thing\nto me is whether I'm satisfied with my\nknowledge and whether my knowledge is\nsufficient to help the people that I\nwant to help\noh now that's a personal journey now if\nI want to be a practicing physician I\nsure as well sure as hell want to know\nwhat I need to get on the licensing\nexams to get a license Yeah right so I\nagree with you there that if you're\ntalking about but in that moment I'm not\nlike an individual I'm someone who's\ntrying to be to hit a certain benchmark\nto become part of a population does that\nmake sense it makes it makes sense so\nbut my question would be can you imagine\na world where science actually goes into\nthe mind enough that it disproves a\nconcept like willpower for example\nI mean I think if science disproves\nwillpower that's fine I think that the\nchallenge is that that doesn't help the\nindividual so well understand do you\nthink that understanding our limits\nhelps well understand our limits our\nunderstanding what are what are and are\nnot our limits would help an individual\non their personal quest as to what would\ntowards what we're talking about so our\nunderstanding are limits on a personal\nlevel or on a scientific level on a\nscientific level\nI mean I think it helps so I think this\nthis is where it kind of comes back to\nwhat you're saying about kind of\nhypothesis generation so I think science\nis useful in terms of helping us sort of\nlike start the process of self\nexploration okay right so I think sign\nup so like it's useful to know for\nexample from science I think this is but\nultimately it comes down to the\nindividual I think it's useful to know\nfor example that our frontal lobes and\nour amygdala have a reciprocal\ninhibition so that mean\nso the frontal lobe is the part of our\nbrain that allows us to do the things\nthat we should do it allows things like\nimpulse control it allows things like\ndelaying gratification okay and then we\nalso know that that the frontal lobe\ndoes a good job of shutting off our\namygdala which is in our limbic system\nwhich is kind of our centers of negative\nemotion we also know that our amygdala\nand limbic system our centers of emotion\nshut down the frontal lobe so I think\nit's a useful mechanism to understand\nthat like when I get emotional my\nability to delay gratification and\ncontrol my impulses goes down mm-hmm and\nit's also important to know that if i\nstrengthen my frontal lobe the better I\nget at delaying gratification the less\npower emotions will have over me\nthere's a reciprocal inhibition so both\nof them sure each one has the ability to\nshut off the other but I think in a\nsimple way like you can study science to\narrive at that conclusion and then I can\njust ask you the simple question Devin\nwhen you're pissed off do you make good\ndecisions or bad decisions yeah\ntypically bad right and like ultimately\nlike we needed a thousand studies to\nteach us that lesson\nwell you might have needed a thousand\nsomeone probably needed a thousand hours\nof meditation to ask that question\nabsolutely right so I think that that in\nmy experience so what I find is actually\none of the biggest things that and maybe\nI have a bias because of the people that\nI work with I work with people who are\nhighly motivated and highly successful\nand one of the biggest problems that\nthey have in terms of finding peace or\nhappiness and this is true of gamers too\nis that they enter a comparative mindset\nyeah and the big problem that I have\nwith the spirit of what you're saying\nlike I don't think we should abandon\nneuroscience like I use it a lot I use\nit every day\nthe problem is that when you set your\nstandard when you assume a standard that\nis external or comparative because if if\nyou set a standard and you say most\npeople are able to achieve five tasks a\nday and you're able to achieve - like\nhow does that help you today all it\ntells you is that you're doing a shitty\njob like that doesn't actually like\nthat's all it tells me but if it tells\nyou that you can do that then it could\ngive you the impetus to improve I agree\nbut I think that in a weird way I'm not\nsure that you can do that right because\nin this moment I don't know that it's\nactually possible for you to do five\ntasks right like I think you have to\nfocus on doing two tasks tomorrow so I\nthink that the problem with setting an\nexternal standard for yourself is that I\nmean let's just think about it this way\nso you know I look around and I see that\nall my friends are I'm just thinking\nabout myself like back in high school I\nlook around at all my friends and and\nsee that like they have girlfriends and\nI don't and so I know it's theoretically\npossible for me to have a girlfriend and\nI can try to work at it but in a weird\nway like the way that I ended up getting\nactually getting a girlfriend is has\nnothing to do with striving to get a\ngirlfriend which doesn't mean that there\nisn't positive stuff that can come out\nof like striving to get a girlfriend but\nI would argue that it's actually like\ndamaging to strive for that and most of\nthe people that I work with I'd say that\nif you want a girlfriend actually don't\ntry to get a girlfriend just focus on\nyourself and become a better person and\nyou'll become like more attractive to\nother people and oftentimes as they make\na comparison to other\nthey're looking for something that\nsomeone else has which in turn blinds\nthem to what they actually would benefit\nfrom so it's damaging to strive for it\nbecause you're going after the wrong\nreasons for pursuing it versus it's an X\nwhenever you go after something what\nyou're saying is when you go after\nsomething that is externally driven\nyou're not gonna get a response that's\nauthentic to yourself absolutely if\nwe're talking if your main question is\nhow does intention how can if I want to\ndo something and I want to make that a\nreality I think the more that you focus\non yourself and the less you use an\nexternal standard the better you're\ngonna be at being able to do that\nso we talk about jobs we talk about\ncareers but we don't talk about callings\nand I think that's a big problem\nyou tell me\ntalk about jobs and we talk about\ncareers but we don't talk about calling\nI would say that maybe a calling in the\nway that you're describing it is Devin\nwhy do you stream it why do I stream\nyeah to make the greatest amount of\npositive impact on people is that a job\nI'm a weird case cuz I don't need to do\nit cuz I do another job but most people\nprobably stream to make money or like as\na job yeah I don't do that as a job okay\nso so yeah so case in point right so\nlike that's something like do you do you\nwhen you stream how do you feel about\nyourself usually pretty bad okay\nstreaming is extremely difficult it's\nreally negative most of the time and it\nrequires like really long hours and\nthere's just a lot of negativity on the\ninternet that gets to me okay\nyeah so I sort of actually broadcast in\nspite of that and and I know like the\nmaybe the typical answer is supposed to\nbe like oh like I feel so great I feel\nlike I'm achieving my calling and stuff\nit's more like an obligation of\nsomething that I feel like I should do\nbecause I'm providing value which is\njust like I have to sit so beautiful\nit's not the wrong answer Devin it's the\nright answer it's the best answer so now\nthis is very very important to\nunderstand most human beings when they\nhave an intention what gets in the way\nis the negative feelings or negative\noutcomes you get that yeah and somehow\nyou are able to do something in spite of\nthose negative feelings or negative\noutcomes you have somehow stumbled upon\nthe silver bullet which is to do\nsomething even though it hurts\nyeah but I feel like that this creates\nover a perpetually sucks that we need to\nwork on yeah so we can work on that so\nthat's it sounds like that's what we're\ntalking about today but but I just want\nyou to like legit spas and think about\nthis for a second you're able to like\nenter this shitstorm of streaming on a\ndaily basis\nand there's a part of you that hates\ndoing it and yet if we think about what\nare the things that get in the way from\nintention to manifestation isn't it the\nbad stuff like if becoming a millionaire\nwas like involved eating burritos every\nday like people could do it like you\ncould give gaming and like eating sushi\nand traveling the world was what was\nnecessary to become a millionaire\neveryone could do it\nthe reason that becoming a millionaire\nis hard is because you have to do things\nthat you don't like to do in what I hear\nfrom you is that you're able to do\nthings that are actually painful and\ndifficult for you but somehow you find\nthe strength to get up every day and do\nit yeah eventually never one time but\nyeah that's that's fine yeah right so\nlet's just think about this for a second\nif we have a life where we're no longer\nrestricted by pain suffering and\nnegative emotions and negative feedback\nand we can do things in spite of that\nlike imagine how much control you have\nover your life\nI doesn't make sense to me if we live\nthe life without negative new notions we\nhave a lot of control so sorry\nno no not without if we lived a life\nwhere negative negative experiences did\nnot prevent us from doing the things\nthat we want to do did not prevent us\nfrom doing them yeah how much freedom do\nyou have in life I would assume a lot\nassuming that's the assuming that's the\nactual barrier but I'm not sure it is\nokay I think many people it's it's one\nbig one right because generally speaking\npeople don't do things because they're\nhard they do things that are easy like\nwhy do people play video games because\nit's [ __ ] easy\nyeah but don't you think there's do you\nthink that there's also sort of a\nsocietal or cultural aspect of this\nwhere we have sort of pushed the tasks\nso like once you get into doing things\nlike pay-per-click advertising for\nexample and you're like it's not like\nreally technical work and it's actually\npretty fun it's almost like a game in of\nitself to figure out like these\ndemographics in like these audiences\nit's actually really similar to gaming\nit's kind of weird how that it's a\nparallel but we've sort of as a society\npush these topics over here and said\nthese are not fun and now everyone sort\nof grown up knowing that how much of it\ndo you think like in terms of\ndistribution of these tasks is actually\nstuff that human beings don't want to do\nor just think they think they don't want\nI don't understand your question it's\nimportant because\nwhat's these the millionaire burrito\nexample that you had so so you said if\nbeing a millionaire was easy and\neveryone just had to eat burritos to do\nit they would do it but but what if\nsociety as a whole\njust like believed that burrito eating\nwas really difficult not fun and\ndisgusting okay like what I'm saying is\nthis is a really hard concept as much\nfor me to get this right but\nthe tasks that move people to the top of\nhierarchies they be cut they are\ndifficult and uncommon\nby virtue of a sort of cultural\nsignificance around that thing right\nlike like there's people say building a\nbusiness is difficult but we don't know\nthat building a business is actually\nthat difficult but there's been a lot of\nlike societal stigma around it and now\nthe perception is the difficult so many\npeople don't even try yeah so let me see\nif I understand you so how much of how\nmuch of our perception see your so my\nokay let's just track back exactly how\nmuch of a section is social barriers\npsychologically I am making a claim that\nif you are no longer controlled by your\nnegative experiences you have freedom in\nlife and what you intend will become\nreal that is the claim you're making and\nyou are saying but how much of so that\ninvolves like freedom from negative\nexperience but your responses how much\nof our definition of negative experience\nis determined by society and may be\nfalse right which matters because even\nif you get rid of the negative\nexperience you still have that barrier\nafter that if that's true I yeah so now\nwe come back to what I was saying\nearlier which is this is why you should\nnot look externally for a comparison bar\nall right so then let's go back to that\nquestion should say let's assume that\nwhat let's assume that's right and that\nwe can't look externally\nwhere do we look and I know the answer\nisn't obviously into the self because\nthat doesn't mean anything\nno no I know so so I think I think we\nlook at so what we're what we're\nhighlighting now is the difference\nbetween a job in a calling okay\nlike a job is what society tells you to\ndo in order to be successful insecure a\ncalling is something that like you you\nfeel like is a duty or a responsibility\nlast time we talked about Dharma you\nremember that and you said that like\nyou're the reason that you stream is\nbecause you feel like it's an obligation\nyeah\ndo to your responsibility yeah so you do\nthis because you see that something is\nwrong in the world and that you feel\nlike you have the capacity to try to fix\nit exactly and that's where you get the\nstrength to deal with trolls the\nnegative emotions that whatever makes it\ndifficult for you to stream yes and you\nalso say that the you know some people\nmake premises like Oh starting a\nbusiness is hard whereas what you're\ntelling me is that you actually really\nenjoy doing things that other people\nfind to be boring or difficult and you\nthrive off of that absolutely and so I\nthink what you're doing is exactly what\nI'm advocating which is stop looking at\nwhat other people are doing and start to\nthink a little bit about what is it that\nyou enjoy what is it that you want to do\nwhat is the change that you want to see\nin the world and then like take a stab\nat it I mean this is a fancy way of\nsaying look in the self but I think\nlooking in the self is very difficult\nand it's like kind of directionless\nsomething that yoga hip you say like oh\nso let's be scientists about it so what\ndoes that actually mean it means like\nthinking about what are the things so\nthis is I think if you want a concrete\ntask so here's one what are the things\nthat you can do despite them being\ndifficult that you like oddly enough\nother people are bitching and moaning\nabout but you're actually completely\nfine doing\nmeditating going to exercise like yoga\nor things like that reading books these\nare things that come pretty easy to me\npersonally that are often like difficult\nthings for other people yeah so I think\nwhen when for your for your listeners\nand my listeners and all of the\nlisteners and everyone who's watching\nvods you know I think that's a question\nthat they should ask themselves so\nlooking into yourself is a systematic\nprocess that involves a lot of different\ndimensions and one is like what are the\nthings that are hard objectively right\nthat the standard people say are\ndifficult but that I actually enjoy\ndoing so what are things that come easy\nto me that seem hard for other people\nyeah yeah and I think if you capitalize\non that if you understand that if you\ntry to build a life based on that then\nyou're not going to be like even though\nthings are objectively hard they're not\ngoing to be like you're gonna be able to\ndo it you're going to be able to succeed\nand would that did an amazing thing he\nrecognized that look look means\nsuffering is different from pain he said\nthere are two layers of human-like\nexperience there's emotions which is\nlike happiness sadness pain grief shame\nand then there's this other layer which\nis peace or suffering so like for\nexample eight years ago my dad passed\naway and it was really like awesome\nexperience for me in a weird way because\nI felt a lot of negative emotion and I\nwas a piece it's a really bizarre thing\nbecause we tend to associate negative\nemotion with a lack of peace but you can\nactually attain a state where there's a\npart of me that sort of recognized and I\nthink people who have lost especially\nparents you know will get to this point\nhopefully at one point where you sort of\naccept it like yeah you missed them but\nyou're also at peace with it and you can\nlike you can sleep easy at night because\nthey lived a happy life and they\nprovided for you and you guys had like a\nvaluable relationship and it meant a lot\nto you but now they're gone and that's\nokay right that's peace and you can have\ngrief and peace at the same time\nthe the Buddha described dukkha I\nbelieve as a sort of sense of\nuncomfortableness right a sort of a sort\nof sense of just like things lot of\npeople mistranslated as suffering right\nbut it's actually just a sense of\nnot being comfortable with the state of\nthings\nit's that way we think of suffering is\nlike okay you're really cold or or your\nor you're starving but it's not that\nit's it's right it's the sense of\nunfulfilled meant yeah so I think that's\none source of new care but I think\nyou're so I think suffering I think is\nactually a pretty good translation I\nmean this is why I think ultimately we\nhave to use sunscreen because but but\nwhat would that would say I think the\nreason that we get you say it's quote\nunquote mistranslated is because people\nequate suffering to physical or\nemotional pain that's what I mean yeah\nbut it's that's the whole point I'm\nsaying is that suffering in the way that\nwould that talks about it is independent\nof those things yeah okay\nso my first clinical experience teaching\nmeditation was teaching meditation to\ncancer patients and cancer patients have\nreally bad pain and we were doing a\nstudy where we wanted to teach cancer\npatients pain and we wanted to say okay\nthis like this is gonna improve their\npain so we give them a questionnaire and\nwe say like okay how bad is your pain\ntoday and they scale up from one to ten\nand so most people will say like nine\nbecause our studies criteria was people\nwho are very sick and then they take\nthat survey every day for a week and\nthey say it's basically nine every day\nthen we teach a meditation for a month\nor two months and then we ask him okay\nnow let's ask you what your pain is and\nguess what their number is\nuh I actually the resume is lower isn't\nit it's like 20% lower it's 9 it's still\n9 it's still mine so then I scratch our\nheads we start scratching our heads and\nwe're like hmm so like did we not do\nthis right and we start talking to\npeople maybe our study didn't succeed\nand then when I talk to people like\nthere was one woman who like blew my\nmind she said no I think I loved it I'm\nglad you guys taught me this I find it\nincredibly helpful and that I'm kind of\nscratching my head I'm like but if it's\nyou're saying it's incredibly helpful\nbut you're still in a lot of pain like\nhow does that work\nand she says what after learning how to\nmeditate I can put a window between me\nand the pain so the pin is still there\nactual pain it reduces your response to\nit absolutely yeah so she's more at\npeace she feels more content now this is\nthe interesting thing\nher pain score is still a 9 what do you\nthink happens to the amount of pain\nmedication she uses does it lower\nabsolutely really to the tune of 363\ndollars a day oh my god what because her\nability to change her response to that\npain is that significant absolutely do\nany of the mental factors around stress\nor anything to increase as a result of\nthat well I don't understand the\nquestion ok so if you're if you're\nassuming that you have less pain\nmedication and more pain\nwouldwould any kind of like stress\nincrease or bad mental states increase\nas a result of that not having pain\nmedication yeah cuz she's renewing her\npain medication yes on the contrary so\nit's it's because her stress level is\nbetter that she can tolerate higher\nlevels of pain in her overall mental\nstate is actually way better because\nshe's not like hopped up on pain meds so\nshe's not like slipping in and out of\nconsciousness because she's like got a\nbunch of narcotics I don't know why\nsomeone's buzzing hold on yeah sure\nwhat's up here\n[Music]\ngive me just one second\nthat's a good chance to the bathroom\nquick hopefully he'll figure that\nyou\n[Music]\nall righty\n[Music]\nhey Tom how are you\n[Music]\nyeah you scared me straight man it's\nreally frightening actually what trolls\ncan do it's like crazy I didn't realize\nthat they would go that far\n[Music]\nso just a while where while we have a\nlittle bit of a break do you guys have a\nsense of what what do you guys is there\nsomething in particular that you want to\ntalk about today\n[Music]\nyou\n[Music]\nhello Kate\n[Music]\nokay so say your wife yeah hello it's\nnice to meet you yes it is hello yeah\ntalking right now okay so we continuing\nwith just yes yeah okay let's do it so\nwe we last left off with your study yeah\nyeah\nokay so you've given these you've given\nthese patients a meditation practice\ntheir pain is still the same their\nresponse to the pain is lesson and also\ntheir stress levels of losses yeah and\nyou equate that reduction of stress\n- the reason why their response to pain\nis better um so I mean I don't like the\nword stress because I don't know exactly\nwhat you mean by that\nbut huh so if we look at it so what it\nis is their ability to tolerate so let\nme put it this way their ability to\ntolerate higher levels of pain improves\nso their discomfort from the pain is\nbetter\nokay\nthis come from the paper okay so so so\nthis goes back to what we were talking\nabout which is the separation of\nphysical and emotional pain from what\nsuffering actually is yeah alright and\nthat's important because when we go\npursue this self-improvement in\nourselves that's a critical thing we\nneed to know well I mean I think it's\njust important to understand that like\nso a lot of people live like the puppet\nin their life is their negative\nexperience I'm sorry the puppet master\nin their life like their puppets and\nthey're controlled by their negative\nexperiences right so like a sensitivity\nto find like when you say negative\nexperience do you mean past do you mean\nso I'll give you it so like let's say\nthat I'm I'm in class and I have\nsomething that I think would be a\nvaluable point to make but I'm afraid of\nhow I'm gonna sound because I'm like\nself-conscious about my voice so I'm\nembarrassed by it and so then I don't\nspeak\nright so if we keep a so in that way\nit's controlled your action yeah so like\nanxiety controls people's lives\nand so if you want to overcome anxiety\nlike there are a lot of different ways\nto do it but if we're talking about like\nyou know what like what I want to do\nsomething in life like what gets in the\nway so I think anxiety is a great\nexample of some kind of emotion or some\nkind of internal experience or some kind\nof like suffering that prevents me from\ndoing the thing that I want to do if I\nreally like a girl and I want to ask her\nout but I'm afraid she's gonna say no\nand I never end up asking her and then I\nregret it for years like what is the\nthing that kept me from doing the thing\nthat I like I really wanted to do it's a\nfear of rejection\nright it's the lack of self-confidence\nand so why does the sorry yeah go for it\nwhy does that just makes no sense to me\nwhy does the brain do this where it'll\nit'll offer you like an initial fear of\nrejection and let's put on a scale of 1\nto 100 that's like a 1 in a negative\nexperience but the [ __ ] experience of\n40 years of regret of not asking that\ngirl out is like so much infinitely\nworse what why does the brain preload\nyou why do we preload ourselves better\nquestion to that narrative well yes\nwhereas the cost versus benefit in that\nlike so I think there are a lot of\nthings that the brain does that seem\nlike their mistakes to us but we have to\nunderstand that the brain is not stupid\nthe brain is just operating under a\ndifferent set of like values so the\nbrains priorities which is different\nfrom what we want them to be\nokay right so like this is where so so\nfor example this is something that I was\nexplaining to people earlier anxiety is\nnot real I mean it's an illness but when\nI really stop and think about it what I\nrealized one day is that anxiety is a\nlearned behavior\nso like anxiety is not like sure it\ncauses people a lot of suffering but\nanxiety is generally speaking something\nthat people learn at some point that's a\nprotective mechanism so if you have a\nkid who gets bullied in school they\nlearn early on that like if I like when\ntheir so when you have like a six year\nold who's getting bullied there's a part\nof their brain so I want you to just\nenvision this scenario so there's a\nthere's a kid on the playground he's six\nyears old and he's being made fun of by\nlike half a dozen kids and the kids are\nsort of in a semicircle or even like\nfull circle and he's been being\nsurrounded yeah and they're making fun\nof him right so that's something that I\ndefinitely experienced when I was a kid\nI think a lot of gamers go through\nsomething like that what do you think is\nhappening what is what is that person's\nbrain teaching them in that moment\nthat any kind of self expressions he'll\nlead to this kind of scenario is bad\nsure yeah and then let's say 15 minutes\nthe bullies get bored and they move on\nand then how does the how does the kid\nfeel\nhorrible right like I never wanted to do\nthat again I never want to do that again\nbut they also feel relief\noh now that it's over now that it's over\nright and so the brain teaches them\nsomething very simple which is that when\nthey're there a bunch of people looking\nat me I'm in danger\ndo you see that\nyeah the one of the one of the ways I\nheard this said was in reference to\nagoraphobia so the example was like\nsomebody has like a a bad feeling or\nsomething bad happens in like a public\nplace like a mall and now the mall then\nbecomes the associate and then they go\nhome and they feel better\nso the mall becomes that place of like\nnegativity they never go back there the\nhome is the place that's secure right\nthat's another thing same yeah okay so\ndo you want to just tell people what a\nagoraphobia is the fear of like public\nplaces are like social events or things\nlike absolutely mmm-hmm so what happens\nis like then so the brain from a very\nprimitive point like like early on in\ndevelopment right when like all the\nplay-doh is still soft before it starts\nto like harden and we like so a lot of\nstuff that happens very early on is very\nimpactful for our programming for the\nrest of life like things like learning\nhow to walk in the capacity to learn\nlanguage so our brain is really laying\ndown very very important foundation when\nwe're young and so in this kid is very\nyoung he learns a very simple thing\nwhich is that when I'm being looked at\nI'm in danger and as long as no one sees\nme I'm fine and so the next day he goes\nto school and I mean if this is this is\nwhat happened to me is like I was smart\nright so like I knew the right answer\nand the teacher would call on me\neveryone's looking at me and I'd give\nthe right answer what do you think would\nhappen at recess after I gave the right\nanswer what people I should make funny\noh yeah because the stupid kids who were\nlarger than I was didn't know the right\nanswer so they'd call me smartypants or\nteachers Pat or whatever and and so then\nlike then my my brain is learning even\nmore it's like okay if I open my mouth\neven in a relatively safe place like I'm\ngonna pay for it later yeah so then what\nhappens is I end up with something\ncalled social anxiety which is that like\nI can be out at a restaurant with people\nthat I don't know and even though no one\nno one has bullied me for years\nthat programming has gotten laid down\nthat like when everyone is looking for\nme like I'm in danger and if you ask\nsomeone about social anxiety they'll\ntell you they're like I know these\nthoughts are crazy but when I'm at a\ndinner table with six people that I've\nnever met and I opened my mouth my heart\nstarts racing\nthat's a danger response that's a\nphysiologic response they can't help\nthemselves that's their brain\nquote-unquote doing that to them and\nthis is where we kind of say like why\ndoes the brain do stupid [ __ ] to us and\nit's because that's just what the brain\nknows how to do like it just it doesn't\nunderstand it's trying to protect you so\nthis is something go ahead well I have a\nreally important distinction that's\ngonna be a thick a super hard answer but\nwhen you say this leads back to the\nbrain's priorities are different from\nwhat we want them to be\nwho's we\nbecause if the if this is all made up\ninto the brain\nwere some outside force that's opposing\nthis obviously since we have the\nconsciousness to do so right like\nthere's one part of you the saying I\ndon't want to be socially anxious\nthere's another part that is it seems\nalmost coded in it's absolutely coded so\nso so I guess like the example of like\nan actual ice person maybe they might\nactually have that response of a dinner\ntable but then the awareness comes in\nthey say okay here's this response I'm\ngoing anyway right what is creating that\nopposition yeah so this is where okay so\nlike it's a good question so yeah yeah\nI'm gonna I'm gonna there's like a more\nscientific answer and there's a less\nscientific answer so the more scientific\nanswer is something that people call the\nobserving self so there's a part of you\nthat is able to in a detached way like\nnotice things about yourself and like\nobserve things kind of objectively so\nthis is the part of you that allows you\nto reflect on your thought process so\nthe observer and the observed are two\ndifferent things\nand if we think about it like sometimes\nyou're caught up in your thoughts like\nthis may sound weird but sometimes\nyou're caught up in your thoughts in\nyour thinking and you're kind of not\nreally aware of what you're thinking\nyou're just lost in the thinking yes\nright now and then there are other times\nwhere you can actually notice your\nthought so there's something outside of\nyour thinking mind that is noticing what\nthe thoughts are and you may have that\nthat may cause thoughts to arise but\nthere's some amount of like self\nreflective capacity okay so this is in\nin in psychology or neuroscience or\nwhatever people sort of talk about this\nthing called the observing self now on a\nfar deeper level like so people have\njust made the observation that oh I have\nthe capacity to like understand\nsomething about what I do what I do yeah\nor what I find with the Yogi's actually\nthey went someone put so they went one\nstep further and they actually tunneled\ndown and explored the depth of the mind\nand what they realized is there is some\npart of us that they call the othman\nwhich is more loosely translated as soul\nself yeah or consciousness\nand the consciousness is separate from\nthe mind the mind is a thinking machine\nbut that consciousness is separate and\nthat the purest form of consciousness is\nlike something that's divine and when\nyou when we like become pure\nconsciousness then we're enlightened\nwhen your comment kind of completely\nfree from the mind and there's so this\nmay be kind of a weird thing that people\nhave trouble understanding so we can go\nthrough a quick exercise where I can\nkind of lay it out for you sure yeah so\npeople tend to think first of all that\nconsciousness and mind are the same\nthing so let's understand the different\nstates of mind and being that we all\nexperience and see how consciousness and\nmind are acts actually separate mm-hmm\nso the first thing is what are we do it\nlike so right now Devon is your\nconsciousness active yes or no\nyes yes it is your mind active yes okay\nso the other way to put this is are you\naware\nyes or no I am these are really\ndifficult words because they could mean\na water no just just answer the question\nsimply are you aware that Devon I think\nso yeah the answer is yes don't worry we\ngot a step away from [ __ ] philosophy\nokay like that's a weird [ __ ] yeah all\nof that stuff so Yogi's didn't care\nabout like all like are we in the matrix\nand they're not in the mail like just\nforget just like are you aware right now\nlike yeah you're aware yeah I'm aware of\nus and are you having thoughts I am okay\nso now let's think about what is the\nstate of mind where we don't have\nconsciousness and we have no thoughts\nwhat does the state of mind where we do\nwhat we do have consciousness so so\nfirst actually we take a step back so\nyour state of mind right now we're gonna\ncall wakefulness okay okay this is\nwakefulness so what state of mind has no\nconsciousness and no thoughts sleep\nabsolutely easy right no consciousness\nno thoughts now what is the State of\nMind of dreaming what\nare they fine huh do we know that yes do\nyou have thoughts yes or no in dreaming\nthis is really hard man like notes is a\ndream considered a thought what do you\nthink I don't think so\nso do you have thoughts when you dream\nyou can think Walter I mean yes so the\nmind is active in area right yeah are\nyou conscious in a dream\nsometimes but not always not usually\nyeah not usually right so now we have\nand then we also have something called a\ndaydream why do we call it a daydream\nwhat is their playing are you aware in a\nday train awake\nnot usually absolutely yeah do you have\nthoughts in a daydream yes absolutely\nright so now we have when when caught in\nconsciousness consciousness plus\nthinking is wakefulness no consciousness\nno thinking is sleep and then we [ __ ]\nhuman beings we understand this stuff so\nwell that we came up with a word that\ndescribes the other and then we are\ndreaming which is no consciousness with\nthoughts and then we have daydreaming\nwhich is no consciousness with thoughts\nso do you see that like even between\nsleep and wake we have found a common\nstate of mind and we use the same word\nto describe it daydream versus dream yes\nbecause human beings intuitively\nunderstand that I'm lost in my thoughts\nand I'm kind of not aware of what's\ngoing on yes they do in Sedona so now so\nnow we're filling out a two-by-two table\nright you got that up yeah I do\nand so then now the question becomes\nwhat is consciousness without thought\nit's meditation absolutely yeah their\nnests yeah so when people ask me what is\nmeditation that's it that is meditation\nsuper cool okay I totally get that\nmeditations consciousness without\nthought yep now you've heard that phrase\na thousand times before\nbut like not in context but we don't\nunderstand like we don't like we don't\nexplain what that means and it's\nactually like it's mind-blowing ly\nsimple yeah it is you can teach this\nstuff you can ask a six-year-old these\nquestions and they'll give you the right\nanswers the six-year-old will give me\nmore confident answers than you will\nbecause you [ __ ] read too many books\nthat's sure that's the whole Zen\npractice of yes and you know what\nhappens with so now Devin we're gonna\ncome full circle so what's what's the\ndifference between a six-year-old\nanswering these questions and you I've\nread too many books yeah so what is that\nthat's relying on an external standard\nwait way run that by me again how do you\nmean so you remember how we were talking\nabout like using science as a Berlocq is\na comparison like using an objective\nstandard you've read so many books that\nyou have all these objective standards\nthat are actually interfering with what\nyou actually know\nI have objective standards that are\ninterfering with what I actually know\nyeah right because you've you've spent\nso much time studying science and\nstudying things outside of yourself that\nthey're now interfering with your\nability to even tell what's going on\nwithin you\nI am losing you at your connection now\nlosing like you're losing it no no\ninternet yeah like physically yeah give\nit just a sec okay no yeah I think we\ndecided so can you repeat what USA yeah\nso like the difference between the\nsix-year-old and you is like remember\nhow you were saying how do you know what\nto what standard to set yourself against\nunless you look at something objective\nand external right you were saying like\nhow do you know like how what you should\nstrive for unless you look outside so\nthe difference between you and the\nsix-year-old is you've read a bunch of\nbooks yeah so you have a lot of external\nstandards in your mind that are actually\nyou have to like dismantle to get to\nyour actual experience like when I asked\nyou are you aware a six-year-old is\ngonna say yeah whereas you're like well\nwhat is awareness like yeah are we and\nyou guys I'm saying I basically [ __ ]\nup my whole life because I read some of\nit herself in from in books and now I\nhave to work through all that [ __ ]\nbecause I like to get back to where I\nstarted\nyes right and tonight so so Devin Devin\nnow you understand now so now you're\nready to understand what Leonardo da\nVinci said if it took my entire life to\npaint like a child\nit took me my entire life to paint like\na child now you get it\nthat's what he was saying\nand I you cut out with us who's saying\nLeonardo da Vinci\nthat's what he said yeah\nso\nokay okay but all those presupposes that\nyou have all the answers inside you like\nwhere does that where do we where do we\ncome to with that that that seems like a\nweird like me me like yogi thing right\nlike um so are you saying that there\nliterally is no value in external no no\nI think there's there's a max value in\nexternal stuff there's some ends value\nit's just that what's the dicot I don't\nunderstand like what's the dichotomy cuz\nlike it's like on one hand I have to\nforget every Tony Robbins speech I've\never heard to become enlightened right\nlike but on the other hand I have to\nlike like there's some value in it so\nI'm gonna share a story with you okay so\nlike this is where like I can we can I\ncan try to explain it a couple ways I'm\njust gonna share a story to see if this\nresonates so if you ever heard of the\nstory of how would that became\nenlightened oh yeah\nwhat's your understanding of the story\nwell it's a really long so okay okay I\nunderstand sorry let me just tell my\nversion okay okay she was doing a lot of\nstrict asceticism so he had started with\na lot of teachers and he was like doing\nthe really hardcore meditation stuff\nbecause he wanted to be enlightened he's\nlike I'm gonna starve myself so he did a\nlot of intense fasting he was a schemata\nlike he would live in the forest with\nthe one so he was like he was he was\nlike gray and on the brink of death and\nhad like it thought like okay like it's\nnot enough I'm not enlightened yet so\nI'm gonna go further I'm gonna go\nfurther I'm hardcore this is what all\nthe texts and all the external people\nsay that I should do and I know that\neven like people haven't gotten\nenlightened this way so I'm gonna do it\nhe's doing it he's doing it he's on the\nbrink of death he's emaciated he's like\nall skin and bones and this young girl\nwalks by I kind of envisioned her as a 9\nyear old girl and she's got a pail of\nrice pudding and she sees this dude\nwho's clearly like an ascetic and she\nkind of says she's like she also sees\nthat he's like he was not like really\nlooking great like he looks sick he's\npaying he's thin and she's like hey man\ndo you want some rice pudding and then\nrice pudding is like you know it's it's\nit's dense it's delicious its creamy its\nsweet it's a dessert and like hear\nBuddha is like he's not even eating like\ncrusts of bread he's like depriving\nhimself of water he like looks at her\nand he's like you know what yes I do and\nthen he eats the rice pudding and he's\nlike you know what this [ __ ] is [ __ ]\ndelicious and then he's like why the\nhell if I've been doing this this whole\ntime he's like how can something so\nsimple and so pure that I enjoy so much\nlike how can the road to enlightenment\nlike mean avoiding this or giving this\nup and then in that moment he says [ __ ]\nit this is all stupid\nall of this strict asceticism everything\nthat I've done it just doesn't work it's\nstupid there's just no way to become\nenlightened it's all false and then he's\nlike it's I'm just gonna like that's it\nI'm done and then he goes in you again\nyou know I'll [ __ ] I'm hitting the\nclimax can you hear me I've totally lost\nhim now oh I see you Oh God\nI think my zone that money gone out\ntwice\nthere\nokay Oh God let me try to change this\nserver of the call cuz like my internet\nseems to be okay I don't know why yours\nis yeah is mice let me see if my stream\nis my stream is fine it's probably\ndiscord hold on hold on hold on tom is\nsaying hit a ctrl shift escape\npeople are saying this Court does this a\nlot it does yeah yeah my CPUs like at\n20% I don't think it's my CPU\nI'll leave it open we'll just click an\neye on it can you chat can you change\nthe can you change the server of a\ndiscord call was that actually pause I\ndon't know when people are saying such\nspiritual conversation that the\nbandwidth can't handle its share yeah\ntop right okay oh you can this is why ya\nhang up he's gotta toss ourselves on to\na better server thank you but if the\nconversations going into another\ndimension so alright okay better well\nthis should hopefully be better and if\nit's not what changed alright okay so\nthe buddha has rice pudding and he goes\nwhy hell have I ever why was I yeah this\nis stupid like like I've deprived myself\nof all the stuff this is such a pure and\nsimple joy like all these people are\nidiots I've tried it it doesn't work he\nsays [ __ ] it and then he goes in sits\nunder a people tree and gets enlightened\nforty days later yeah right like huh no\nhe goes assistant or poetry and it takes\nfrom 40 days I don't know well I thought\nhe I thought he didn't eat also during\nthat I don't know okay okay so the point\nbeing that there is actually an answer\nto why he didn't have the rice pudding\nright it's that that separation from\nthat desire was what was supposed to\nspark that enlightenment in the first\nplace\nI'm sorry can you say that again yeah\nthis is so the whole reason he's set out\nto do all the stuff that Ramana does\nwhich is like basically try to destroy\nthemselves is to get away from desire to\nget away from that attachment so that\nyou reach a point where you're not\ndependent on those things and you're\nfree from them that was the whole point\nof going through all that suffering that\nwas the whole point and then though he's\nreal oh [ __ ] I'm cutting out now and\nwhat he realizes is that I wonder if I\nshould just bump up my internet\nconnection\nwe're on Central rose again - yeah we'll\ntry to track you're on the west coast I\nam yeah\nbut add you on East and that was working\nout okay\nwe'll try that that might be better for\nyou yeah okay thank you yeah so I think\nthat yes so that that's the the crazy\nthing about enlightenment is that like\nyou know you conquer all of the desires\nexcept for the desire of enlightenment\nand it's the desire for enlightenment\nthat causes you to get rid of everything\nelse but ultimately that's a desire that\nhas to be given up to\nI say mmm and that's what he's holding\nbud the back was that he's still desired\nto become enlightened yeah\nso when he says [ __ ] it I'm done that's\nwhen it happens but that's because he\nalready did all the other work hasn't it\ntechnically if you really look at sand\ntraditions no so remember that\nenlightenment enlightenment is binary\nit's not yeah it's on our honor ophea\nright so what you did before that moment\nit's not like he got 50% of the way\nthere so that yeah that's why like when\nyou look at Zen masters like you know\nwhat they do when they become\nenlightened what they laugh because they\nrealize the futility of everything\nthey've been doing\nI see\nyeah Alan Watts has a really good\nsegment on this where he talks about\nexactly this that like you there's a way\nthat zine masters trick their students\nright they have a they have a sort of in\nthe beginning like you go in and you say\nI really want to learn how to become\nenlightened you can teach me\nand then the Zen master says no I can't\nteach you I have nothing to teach you\nand the student says no I know that you\nhave something to teach me because there\nare all these people hanging around and\nthey are trying to learn from you and\nthe master goes no I didn't ask them to\nbe here they're just hanging out and I\ncan't get him to leave and and and like\nthe master kind of convinces you that\nthere really is nothing to teach you\nthat is the answer but that doesn't\nbecome self apparent until you spend\nyears in the ashram because you haven't\nactually internalized that you finally\nreach the end of it and you get there\nand you're like oh my god that old\nbastard was right there really was\nnothing for me to know yeah and so now\nDevan we come back to you my friend yeah\nwhat's the value of 700 books\nI have to feel like it had some value\nbut maybe that's maybe that's my ego\ntrying to defend the amount of\ninvestment of time that I had no no it\ndoes have some value you have to spend a\nlot of time reading those books to\nrecognize how useless they are\nOh\nthat's that I totally understand that\nokay here we go yeah I completely\nunderstand that um chat we're having\nthem at worst I'm still having a massive\ndifficulty with you cutting out I think\none way we could do this is um do you\nwant I can send you a zoom meeting okay\nand then you literally just click that\nand then we switch over that because\ndiscord right now seems to be well now\nit's better but it seems to be going in\nand out we'll do that next call no\nmatter what okay um I'll just get you\nset up on that it's way better okay okay\nso I need it seems to be good now so I\nneed to read the books to understand\nthat I don't\nneed to know what's in the books yeah\n[Music]\nright so this is this is that this is\ntranscendence like you have to move\nabove and beyond the phenomena of like\nreading and all that good stuff so like\nthis is where we when we kind of go back\nto neuroscience here you are you're\ntelling me like isn't neuroscience\nimportant is that neuroscience important\nand I'm saying well oh [ __ ] one second\nguys\nyeah we'll get up on zoom' meeting this\nnext time chat so that that will work\nlike 1% that's how we do D and D never\ninterrupt and we have like six people\nright\nit's discord because you like we know\nbecause when we switch services changes\nthat's why\nso so Devin does that\nso I think like oh yeah let's have value\nand neuroscience has value and\nultimately I think one of the biggest\nproblems that I see practically is that\npeople go looking for answers in books\nand I think you can learn a lot from\nbooks but I've never mmm actually I was\nabout to say so I think I I was about to\nsay I've never heard of a book changing\nsomeone's life but that's not true it\ndefinitely can yeah and I mean I was\njust thinking about my own life they're\nbooks that have changed my life so but\nchanging your life is such a broad term\nright yeah I mean I think I think what\nyou meant by change your life when you\ninitially said that was different like\nchained your wife like an internal\nrealization like a moment of Satori\nyeah Japanese yeah mm-hmm so I was um\nthis is a really good segue into\nsomething that I definitely want to talk\nto you about I was on a podcast I'm on\nI'm on the there's the number one\npodcast on twitch is this podcast called\nthe scuf podcast and I guess I've\nsomehow finagle my way into being\nco-producer of this podcast and we bring\non different personalities usually\nprovocative personalities and there was\none particular person the show goes out\nto tens of thousands of people's\nsignificant right one particular person\ncame out and said the absolutely 100%\nvideo game addiction does not exist\nand the the way that they justified that\nwas they said there are no hard Studies\non video game addiction existing and\nthat it's basically this sort of\nfabrication of mainstream media and and\nand people to promote this idea of video\ngames being like this toxic influence on\npeople's lives now I countered with the\nfact that I knew anecdotally and by\nobservation including of myself of a lot\nof people that had video game addiction\nand furthermore that by dismissing it in\nthe same way that you would dismiss like\ndepression or something will actually do\ndamage to all these people who really do\nhave these addictions and and\nessentially like anything can be\naddiction addiction but I because I\ndidn't have the science there I couldn't\nmount a good argument and okay and more\nor less III don't feel good about how it\nended up and I'd like to be better\nequipped to handle that because of the\ninfluence it can have was the person\nresearcher know they're a journalist\neven worse okay yeah so you're you're\nasking like what's the argument to make\nthat video game addiction exists I I\nthink it's a no I think I'm I'm starting\na conversation with you about video game\naddiction and your take on it and then\nfrom there maybe extrapolating onto like\nwhere we can go uh if we have that\nconversation with people okay wait wait\nwhat's the what's the what's the thought\nprocess you have around this well so I'm\ntempted to kind of respond to that\nperson's point so like yeah is it okay\nif I start there so the first thing is\nDevin does the depression exist\n[Music]\n100% how do we know\nwell we know through a combination of\nobservation but also a lot of very\nconcrete studies that show beautiful\nchemical differences in the brain yeah\nas we keep serotonin lost and dopamine\nyeah nope nope that's not what the\nstudies show it's not what the studies\nshow well with it were they let they\nshow so now we have to understand a\nlittle bit about how psychiatric\ndiagnoses are made okay so\na millennia ago not really millennia ago\nthere was a group that came up with this\nbook called the DSM which is the\nDiagnostic and statistics manual yeah so\nwhat people were doing so a bunch of\nPsychiatry researchers sat down they\nscratch their head and they said we want\nto study depression but like how do we\nknow who has depression and who doesn't\nand specifically these people were very\ninterested in pharmacologic trials so\nsomeone says like okay if I want to\nstudy a drug to treat depression how can\ni how can I decide like who qualifies\nfor depression and who doesn't like\nwhere is the dividing line between\ndepression and not depression make\nsounds so they came up with something\ncalled the DSM which is like a checklist\nof features so for example for major\ndepressive disorder there are nine\npossible things and you have to check\nfive out of the nine boxes and if you\nsubject what you're checked huh because\nI Freddie yeah we have this for\neverything schizophrenia absolutely\nabsolutely absolutely so if you check\nfive out of the nine boxes you qualify\nas depression and the whole reason they\ncame with the DS came up with the DSM is\nbecause researchers were trying to\nfigure out if I'm studying a drug how\nare we gonna know that the people that\nI'm testing are the same people that\nyou're testing yeah so we have to come\nup with a consensus for research to make\nsure we're talking about generally\nspeaking the same thing okay this is\nwhere the criteria for depression came\nfrom and this is where the studies on\ndepression came from when we proved that\ndepression existed\nwe used a checklist that a group of\npeople came up with and we just sort of\nby Fiat got together and decided this\nmeans depression\nthere's no real scientific foundation\nfor our diagnosis of depression\nthere's no real be huh that can't be\nbecause we can notice a chemical\ndifference in the brain and people that\nare depressed I know we can do that okay\nso but let's remember like order of\noperations right when did we classify\ndepression as an illness and and as\nneuroscience has come a really far away\nbut they're actually even now disputes\nabout whether people with depression\nhave lower serotonin levels than people\nwho don't have depression really yes all\nwe know is that serotonin boosting\nagents seem to improve depression and we\nhave some really generous studies which\nsuggest that some neurotransmitters are\nkind of messed up but if you actually\ntalk to neuro translating this research\nit's so far from clinical application\nbecause we just don't understand how the\nbrain works it's not like your serotonin\ndoes all kinds of things it governs like\nit governs like peristalsis in the gut\nit governs like all kinds of chemical\nsignaling it governs like how your eyes\nare able to see it governs all sorts of\nstuff what yeah so let's think about\nthis think do you know how many\nneurotransmitters there are no like a\ndozen okay so there's like dopamine\nthere's serotonin\nthere's like there endogenous opioids\nthere like there's like there aren't\nthat many neurotransmitters because\nremember that a neurotransmitter is a\nsignal mm-hmm it's something that like\nand gets dumped into it something called\na synaptic cleft and then travels to a\nneuron and then hits a receptor I mean\nthe kind of receptor that\nhow can i is it the kind of receptor it\nactivates triggers a completely\ndifferent thing\nso we only have like a dozen\nneurotransmitters and like even though\nwe have a dozen neurotransmitters our\nbrain is capable of doing all kinds of\nthings from creating music to holding in\nour urine to falling in love and that's\njust governed by a dozen\nneurotransmitters okay but when we\nremove dopamine from mice they don't eat\nyep they lose motivation do anything\nright so so what we can we can\nindividually control some of these\nneurotransmitters to affect behavior yes\nfrom that do you not think that we can\nmake some kind of conclusion as to what\nthese things are influencing yes\nabsolutely but let's be clear that's\njust that's just some kind of conclusion\nright so that's the money statement so\nlike our sense of Science in psychiatry\nin addiction and stuff like that is very\ndifferent like so when when someone gets\npneumonia like that's pneumonia we can\nsee the bug we can give it an antibiotic\nwe can kill the bug and the person gets\nbetter mental health is not like that so\nI absolutely believe that depression\nexists but if you really look at the\ndata the gap between basic science and\nclinical application in psychiatry is\nhuge compared to any other system of\nmedicine you're saying there is no way\nwe can see depression in the brain\nreliably no we have to observe it in the\nbehavior of the individual and their\nself-report actually let me rephrase so\nI'm not saying there's no way that we\ncan see it but what I can tell you is\nthat in the diagnosed so when I'm making\na diagnosis of depression an MRI is not\npart of the diagnostic workup well\nobviously no yeah well why is that\nobvious because aren't we talking about\nobjectively because it's very hard from\na medical standpoint to like extract all\nthe chemicals to do a brain reading of\nall the chemicals absolutely that's why\nwe do it so it's not because yeah the\nfirst thing to understand is that for\nthis person to say there are no hard\nstudies that diagnose video game\naddiction is a stupid statement because\nthere are nose into hard studies to\ndiagnose depression because depression\nis a clinical diagnosis it's not a\nbiopsy like you can't buy up some biopsy\nsomeone brain scan someone blood test\nsomeone for depression you\njust it's a clinical diagnosis in\naddictions our clinical diagnosis and so\nyou can come up with criteria you can\nmake a clinical assessment with the idea\nthat there's some kind of silver bullet\nlike there is for a blood culture like\nHIV is it sure I mean even then\npractically you make it a clinical\ndiagnosis but there's a test that you\ncan prove whether someone has HIV or\ndoesn't have HIV this is also the case\nof things like like herpes simplex virus\nright we're like you can you can sort of\nsee that there are certain antibodies in\nthe bloodstream but there is absolutely\nno way to see the actual virus like\nthings like there's all kind of stuff\nlike that right well yeah but I mean so\nbut that's just because seeing the\nantibodies is easier but you can see the\nactual like you can you can actually see\nthe virus because you can do something\ncalled a viral load so that's like what\nyou do is you take some like I think\nsample of I don't know if they test the\nRNA but you can you can do like a load\nwhich shows like what amount of HIV so\nthe antibody just tells you whether\nyou've been infected in the past or not\nbut there's another test called a viral\nload which shows you like what's the\nburden of virus in this person's body so\nwhy don't we do that why don't we do\nthat for what like when we're doing\nblood tests for people with viruses and\nstuff to figure out how we do for HIV so\nlike for example so for HIV let's say\nthat like cuz you're gonna you know that\nwith HIV we have a lot of like resistant\nstrains so when I when I give you a\nmedicine I don't know if your HIV is\ngonna be resistant to it or not so even\nthough you can have a positive antibody\na positive antibody just means that your\nimmune system has seen it before it\ndoesn't mean that you're actively\ninfected or not actively infected but\nusually it means that you basically been\nexposed which means there's a decent\nchance you're infected but in order to\ndetermine whether the medication is\nworking we do viral loads so you can do\nthat okay\ninteresting but there's nothing like\nthis no matter how granular you get with\nmental health not yet\nright because our understanding our\nunderstanding of the brain in the mind\nis in its infancy compared to like the\nphysiology of the heart or like our\nunderstanding of like the gut\nokay so then how do we evaluate that\nsomeone actually has a real problem\nit's it's it's the DSM and observational\nyeah so so one so now the destroy the\nDSM I'm not done yet\nso remember them actually it's not a\nclinical manual so the DSM was it's not\nit's just it's a research manual so it's\na group of researchers saying how can we\nagree that we're all talking about the\nsame thing okay so the the DSM was\ndeveloped for inclusion criteria for\nstudies so when you go and sign up for a\nstudy they ask you are you depressed\nso like if I if I'm doing a study and\nI'm gonna say like I'm gonna do I'm\ndeveloping the Devin Nash treatment for\ndepression and then people say like okay\nhow are you gonna like find depressed\npeople I'm gonna ask him hey man are you\ndepressed and they're like yeah and I'm\nlike okay come on you're gonna spend an\nhour with Devin Nash and then the end of\nthe hour I'm gonna ask you hey man are\nyou depressed and he says no and I'm\nlike boom done cured right so\nresearchers sat down and they were like\nwell we have to we have to figure out\nlike how are we gonna know whether\npeople get better how are we gonna know\nlike who to include how are we gonna\ndraw the line for where depression is\nand that's when they came up with their\nfive out of nine criteria okay\nthen what happened is insurance\ncompanies we're trying to figure out\nokay this person says they're depressed\nhow do we know whether like we can't\nblood test them so how do we know\nwhether we want to pay for their\ntreatment we're gonna see if they meet\nDSM criteria because someone has a\ncriteria somewhere and we're an\ninsurance company and we want to see if\nwe pay for treatment whether it's gonna\nget better or not get better in the\nstudies on antidepressants after all our\nusing these criteria so we're gonna use\nbilling reimbursement and things like\nthat based on the DSM and when the\nmeasures companies started doing it\nalways subjective huh the criteria\nitself is totally get back to the the\nwhole the thing you said at the very\nfirst part of this talk is the 2000\ncalorie limit absolute a bunch of people\ncame to consensus and said it was a\nthing so it is a thing absolutely right\nit's the same way that the dollar has\nvalue because we all got together and\nagreed so like the the thing to remember\nabout medicine which I think a lot of\npeople don't realize there's a lot of\nmedicine is\nvery scientific right so medicine is\nlike a clinical discipline so at the end\nof the day you know like even after all\nof this testing if you really look at\nstudies 90% of clinical diagnosis\ndoesn't matter what field of medicine\nyou're in like 90% of diagnosis is made\nclinically a doctor comes in like a\ncancer is like for the most part\ndiagnosed clinically no [ __ ] yeah\nabsolutely\nhow do you think that the person ends up\ngetting a biopsy in the first place like\nwhy don't you like Devin are you getting\na biopsy tomorrow hopefully not yeah I\ndon't feel bad yeah and furthermore the\nlast time you saw your doctor did he\nsend you in for a cancer biopsy he did\nnot but I did do a full round of blood\ntests the month ago and everything and\nnothing came up weird so we do so and\nthat's the scientific thing right so\nlike we looked at all the levels of\ndifferent things in my body\ntriglycerides hba1c right and everything\nappeared within normal ranges whatever\nthat is so we made a determination that\nI don't need a biopsy or anything else\nyeah so but but even then so it sounds\nlike you did some routine testing I mean\nwe won't go into details about that but\nlike the whole reason that someone\norders is like when a doctor says okay I\nwant to get a biopsy or I want to get a\nscan it's because their clinical\nsuspicion no like you've been having\nweight loss and you've got a lump\ngrowing on your shoulder let's biopsy\nthat like it's all clinical right so\nit's not actually so tests and medicine\nare used to confirm diagnosis not to\nfind diagnosis so the first thing that\nthis person doesn't understand is like\nvideo game addiction has the same\nstandard meets the same standard as like\ndepression there's no blood tests for\nschizophrenia\nyeah there's no brain scan for\nschizophrenia\nfirst of psychosis or anything like that\nwe literally\nwait wait okay hold on okay cuz this is\ninsane yep\nif you take the brain of a psychotic\npatient who you who is like saying\nthere's a pink elephant right there that\nis yelling at me then you take the brain\nof a normal person there's no difference\nyou can't there's no reading or test we\ncan do that tell the difference we knows\ntwo people nope okay\nin Alzheimer's people if you I know for\na fact if you take the the brain scans\nthey do look different eventually see\nthe matter of the brain is reduced yes\nso Alzheimer's is something we can\ndiagnose scientifically actually\ntechnically Alzheimer's can only be\ndiagnosed through autopsy in biopsy but\nthat's besides so so this is what we see\nthe the brain matter is reduced yep I\nmean well the reason that you can't\ndiagnose Alzheimer's through that is\nbecause there are a lot of reasons why\nbrain matter can be reduced like what\nelse could produce brain matter so any\nother of the dementing diseases are we\nlose brain matter just over the course\nof life if you have things like vascular\ndisease your brain matter can be smaller\nlike there are all kinds of reasons your\nbrain mass can be reduced so Alzheimer's\ncan really only be diagnosed by a biopsy\ntechnically so it's a clinical diagnosis\nokay but psych Coast you could take a\npsychotic patient who is literally\nscreaming at a wall that there are bugs\ncoming out of it and then you can take\nanother person right next to them who's\nlike hey man how's it going and they\nlook exactly the same one on any kind of\ntechnology we have to tell they don't\nlook exactly the same but there isn't\nenough information from either scan to\ndifferentiate like if I showed a\nradiologist a picture of a psychotic\nperson in a picture of you\nthe radiologist would not be able to\ntell you which one is which which\ndoesn't even have a say mission huh\nwould even have a suspicion that one is\nthe other probably North literally 55th\nprobably not although I do think that if\nyou take on average people who have\npsychotic disease over time there are\nsome findings in the brain on average\nbut those are like research findings\nthat are not like they're not enough of\na smoking gun to be clinically useful\nyet does that make sense kind of but is\nthat a technicality because isn't it\nisn't the correlation to actually become\nclinically you still like incredibly\nhigh like we need we have a really high\nstandard for something to become\nclinically correlated yes\nand so is there a fair argument in\nsaying that at some point you would have\nto dispense with that really high\nstandard to make any kind of progress\nwhatsoever\nbecause like for example in nutrition\nright there I could point you to this\nsomething I know a lot about so you\nteach this um you can't you this is the\nsame problem you can't really point I\ncan't really tell you that vegetables\nare better for you because like when you\nreally look down into the data it\ndoesn't objectively show that but I can\n[ __ ] tell you that vegetables are\nbetter for you yeah you see what I mean\nyeah\nso and I think that's just like there's\na shortcoming of science so like we're\nnot willing to dispense so I mean\npractically there are some cases where\nif I have a psychotic patient I will\norder an MRI but that's because if this\nclinical diagonals story doesn't fit\nwith psychosis then sometimes so for\nexample if you like it's just like let's\nsay like you walked into the IDI and you\nhave no history of psychosis you're a\nhigh functioning dude you're socially\ncapable and you're like hallucinating\nI'm gonna order a blood test or you're\nin rest yes\nfor what for like cocaine in marijuana\nand LSD so yeah so like there are tests\nand tests have value but usually tests\nfor psychosis or to rule out because\npsychosis can be caused by more than\nschizophrenia\nright they can because psychosis can be\ncaused by drugs so the experience of\nhallucinations can be caused by drugs\nthey can be caused by some illnesses hmm\nso like if you have a brain tumor you\ncan become psychotic yeah that's nice\nyeah so like like there is value in\nordering brain scans on people who have\nmental illness to rule out organic\ncauses or like primary like their mount\nmental illness is secondary to something\nelse that's going on in their body right\nso for a good one is like some people\nwho are depressed that's because their\nthyroid hormone is very low and if you\nlike because they're like thyroids shot\nso if you give them thyroid hormone\ntheir depression goes away so like\ntesting has a role in psychiatry but\nit's just you know if this if someone\nsays oh like there haven't been good\nstudies proving video game addiction\nexists well yeah but that's because like\n[ __ ] Mario was developed in 1980 and\nwe've had depression like rolling\nthrough our population for the last\n5,000 plus years like it's depression\nwell there isn't there that meme that\nlike people got started to get depressed\nlike when the industrial era came about\nlike is that is that true is it do we\nhave depression like going back like\nthere's Romans have read up a brochure\nyeah absolutely yeah but I do think that\nwe got more depressed one once the\nindustrial area came along and we're\ngetting even more depressed now\nthe suicide rate amongst adolescents has\ngone up by 50% in the last seven years\nin the last seven years global you're in\nthe United States I think us oh my god\nwhatsit adolescent adolescent that's\nsomeone under the age of eight swing\nlike 12 and 18 12 to 18 so the rate of\nsuicide for adolescents has gone up 50%\nin seven years people think 1218 I think\nit's adolescence and not everyone but I\ncould be wrong there and it's also true\nthat middle-aged white men are the most\ncommon suicidal or people to commit\nsuicide\nyes so men commit if you take a hundred\npeople who commit suicide 80 of them are\ngonna be men\nI think it's a four to one ratio oh my\ngod white male priviledge baby Jesus\nokay so okay so the whole hard studies\nno heart states to diagnose depression\nthis almost ties back into your point\nthat we can't really trust external Jets\nof reality they're like bit like\nremember we were going back to like wow\nthat's that's a broad connection but\nbecause because um your whole point I\nthink that's like that's trying to like\nsometimes I try to like find like a\ntheme of a talk yeah yeah I hear ya yeah\nand I feel like the theme of today was\nlike we really can't trust our outside\nexperience so so and the only way that\nyou as a clinician are evoking this idea\nof someone being depressed is by\nreceiving listening to their internal\nexperience and then interpreted it for\nthem yeah right I mean I guess just\ntheir subjective internal experience\nright so I'll use like how they look\nwhat their face displays how they sound\nso I mean I need sensory data\nokay so it then I am I am more lost than\nI've ever been before\nokay now we can get started it's because\nlike if you have if you have nothing all\nright\nlet's say Devin what's your question\njust just what's your question man\nwhat's your question I have tons of\nquestions okay\nlike just ask the one that's in your\nhead\nwell that's it done I think it's done\nbut here we go um if you're floating in\na tank and you need something to hold on\nto but by definition there are no walls\nbecause everything is external all you\nhave is yourself what do you do see that\nso that's why I have to think about my\nquestions before I ask them because I\ndon't make sense\nso I mean because I think that that's\nwhat the Yogi's discover right at the\nend of the day\nso the way to understand what your\nconsciousness is is to check into it in\nall kinds of different moments so like\nwhen I meditated I found this part of me\nthat seemed to be like calm and peaceful\nand empty horribly empty terrifyingly\nempty and at the same time wonderfully\ncomforting but just like it's kind of\nlike looking at the Grand Canyon it's\nlike it's crazy but it's also\nmagnificent it's like terrifying and\nawe-inspiring and and that's what you\nsort of feel on the inside when you have\nsome spiritual experiences of meditation\nand then I went through my life and I\ngot pretty good at tapping into that so\nI could basically tap into it whenever I\nwanted mm-hmm and then I went through\nvarious experiences in my life where I\nwas wondering whether\num like I was wondering whether I could\nhave an experience what that would take\nthat away so as I got more and more\ngrounded in it then like I remembered\nlike the you know my dad passed away and\nlike I was like at his funeral and and\nlike despite the fact that I was\ngrieving I still found that sort of calm\npeaceful emptiness within Muniz like oh\nthat's kind of interesting that's still\nthere\nand if I tapped into it I sort of felt\nokay like even though I was feeling\ngrief and sadness there was something\ninside me that felt tranquil and then a\nfew weeks later I got married and so\nthat's presumably you know a very happy\nday of my life and even during that\nhappiness like I felt that same amount\nof like emptiness and void within me and\nI was like oh like that's that's the one\nthing in my life that is completely\nconstant\nso can I let me ask you like\n[Music]\ndo you\nyou've done this like incredible amount\nof self introspection and study and\nmeditation but when you appear to me as\na person who still struggles with\nall the problems of being human right\nyou still getting depressed I assume and\nyou still get like anxious sometimes and\nthings like that\nsure like so I don't know I'll give on\nyour off time like when you get off the\ncall like you're like fighting Dormammu\nor something with the powers that you've\ngained from like Tibetan meditation or\nwhatever but like like what it seems to\nme is like if do you feel like you've\ngone somewhere like what is the point of\nall this if you're still just going to\nexperience suffering and an anxiety and\ndepression and you have all these things\nlike where did you end up like where are\nyou today that makes any difference in\nthe path that you've taken why should we\ndo it well is it because I think I\nsuffer less than many other people you\ndo yeah\nwhy do you think that because I found\nthat thing within like that's my whole\npoint right like remember we're talking\nabout what Luca and so I did get better\nfor you yeah well so the emotional paint\nso my cancer pain remains still in nine\nit just doesn't know me as much alright\nthat's the reason you do that's worth do\nyou think that's worth it you know\nabsolutely because that's the only thing\nthat's worth it\nthat's the only thing that's worth it\nyeah because like so now when I like\nwhen when stuff goes well for me or\ndoesn't go well for me like I tend to be\nlike okay with either one\nokay with what either one either one so\nso Devin like the whole reason so when\nwe think about like when I think about\nmy the change in my life right from\nbeing like failing out of college and\ngraduating with a 2.6 like you would\nthink that after applying to medical\nschool for two years in a row and\ngetting over a hundred and forty\nrejections I would be bummed out yeah\nand like you would think that I would\nstop\nbut like the whole point is that sure I\nfelt disappointment but I also felt\ntranquility and so I just kept doing it\nand and like that's the value right so\nwhat's happened is that I'm no longer I\nmean I am but for the most part I think\nlike cuz I'm not a different person this\nis like this has to be understood like\npeople think that I made some amazing\ntransformational change like 2.6 GPA\ninstructor in psychiatry at Harvard\nMedical School like that's a big gap and\npeople think that you have to like\nchange a lot like the whole point that I\ntry to tell people is I'm actually not\nthat smart like I'm not I'm just not\nthat like I'm smart like I know I'm\nsmart but I'm not like that smart that's\nprobably not true so so let's say if you\nlooked at you if you looked at the if\nyou did IQ test you probably like 130\n140 150 like you have to realize you\nprobably have an insane amount of I\nthink about this a lot with like what a\nsoftware engineers and people like that\nlike they just come in with such a high\nIQ and the ability to cognate of these\nthings so look it's such a huge let me\nrephrase yeah so when I look at other\npeople and I think about my trajectory\nin life in their trajectory in life I\ndon't think that IQ is the thing that's\nresponsible for my success I think it is\nbeing able to not let my negative\nexperiences impact my intentions\nbecause I'm telling you like I'm not\nthat like you look at like people who\nare addicted to video games like a lot\nof them are [ __ ] brilliant\nyeah like this is what I'm telling you\nbecause when I when I when I play with\nmy friends so like I have a group of\npeople that I used to play dota with and\nI think I'm I'm objectively far more\nsuccessful than than they are but I'm\npretty sure I'm not much smarter or\nsmarter at all yeah a degree I serious I\nwrite like well there's a ton of people\nthat play video games they're believably\nsmart so yeah it's that's what I'm\nsaying I'm not like I'm I'm definitely\nsmarter than like the average person\nwalking down the street probably\nsubstantially smarter than the average\nperson walking down the street but I\nthink if you look at video games video\ngames select for people who have very\nhigh IQs why\nyeah so very simple so let me ask you\nsomething so I'll tell you a story that\na video of someone gamer I was working\nwith so video gamer is in second grade\nthey go into math class and teacher says\nhere's your math worksheet for the day\nthe kid looks at it fills it out in\nabout 10 minutes\nwalks up to the teacher and says here's\nthe worksheet can I have the next one\nwhat do you think the teacher says\nteacher says that's what we're doing\ntoday you'll get the next one tomorrow\nokay please sit down and quietly sit at\nyour desk and the kid goes back so then\nwhat happens is like school moves at the\npace of the slowest kid yeah right so\nthat happens as this kid goes home and\nthen he beats level one of ninja gayden\nand do you know what's waiting for him\nwell - absolutely yeah so if you're a\nsmart kid why the [ __ ] would you want to\ninvest in a classroom that is just 50\nminutes of boring in 10 minutes of\ninteresting versus\na intellectual challenge that is\nliterally paced exactly to you because\nyou know what if he's not ready for\nlevel two you know what he has trouble\ndoing\nyou can't beat chess how about level 1\nabsolutely\nyeah yeah so video games for smart kids\nvideo games give them the intellectual\nchallenge that they don't find in the\nrest of their life\nmm yeah it's not complicated it's not\nlike some deep scientist it's just like\nit says yeah hmm so like one of the\nreasons that video games are addictive\nis because they're perfectly paced to\nyou know job is perfectly paced to you\nknow class is perfectly paced to you\nright like no wonder people like playing\nvideo games yeah they're gonna there\nit's like video games are like a\nspiritual like an enlightened spiritual\nguru who meets you exactly where you are\nand knows the next step you need to take\naccept in a weird way you're not getting\nany benefit from playing them you're not\ngetting any benefit why is that well you\nknow so why is it well what I'm saying\nit's like if you accomplish a hard task\nin real life it has like a reverberation\nto it that like results in like positive\noutcomes for you but if you do that in a\nvideo game it's ephemeral it's not quite\nthere why is that well I think that's\nbecause generally speaking we think\nabout hard tasks is having real-world\nvalue so our society tends to value\nthings that are harder to do ie back to\nour burrito for you know eating burritos\nfor a million dollars we tend to pay\npeople more based on the difficulty of\nwhat they do not the difficulty of what\nthey do but how rare it is for someone\nto be able to do it yeah yeah\nbut but uh what I'm saying is on the\nsame token so what say that you complete\nlike a really hard like Ninja Gaiden\nit's actually funny bringing up that's a\nvery hard game yeah especially the\noriginal ones are some of the hardest\ngames like out there so let's say you\nactually do beat Ninja Gaiden and you go\nall the way through that sense of\naccomplishment that you get as a result\nof completing that is ephemeral it just\nkind of floats away but in real life\nwhen you do something that is really\ndifficult like you build a house or you\nor you know what that is probably a big\nstream thing some equivalent thing of\nvalue like you create something or\nsomething it seems to have more staying\npower do you know what I mean yeah I\ndon't have a good way to describe this\nlike what I'm trying to ask is like why\nis it that the accomplishments that come\nfrom video games just sort of float away\nfrom us they escape us it's like they're\nnot even real to begin with I know they\naren't but there's a lot of\naccomplishments in real life that we can\ndo like get a girlfriend for example\nwell because like no I understand your\nquestion so it's like it's like I'm\ngonna I'm gonna read into your question\na little bit the first premise that I\nthink you're making is that for a few\nmoments the accomplishment that you get\nin the video game feels the same as a\nreal life exactly but it lasts right so\nlike that's the first thing to recognize\nand this is where once again your brain\ndoesn't know the difference like your\nbrain is actually and in some way\nrelatively smart and also incredibly\nstupid your brain doesn't understand the\nall the brain understand so you have\nthis thing that there's a actually xx I\nhave a youtube video all about this\nabout something that I call the triumph\ncircuit and the brain doesn't understand\nso you get like a dopamine reward upon\ncompleting a task that is proportional\nto the difficulty of the task okay and\nif you think about it like if you use\nlike a god mode cheat code in a video\ngame does the video game become more or\nless fun oh it sucks yeah yeah so our\nbrain is wired to get more of a dopamine\nresponse when there's difficulty\ninvolved and so like why do people love\ndark souls because it's hard absolutely\nyeah and you really really have to\nfigure out the exact\nand how does it feel when you when you\ndo well in Dark Souls right yeah so this\nis where someone made a fascinating\ndiscovery back in 2014 that videogames\nare addictive not because of the reward\nbut because of the denial of the Lord\nthat separates them from all other like\ndrug addictions when when I shoot up\nheroin there's no chance that I'm not\ngonna get high like that's the whole\nthing right\nevery time I smoke pot it's gonna be\ngood every time i snort coke it's gonna\nbe good\nevery time I get smashed it's gonna be\ngood I mean there are problems but\nbiologically like I'm gonna get the\nreward from the alcohol\nwhat makes videogames so damn addictive\nis that you get the rewards sometimes\nlike why do you think so many people\nplay law in Fortnight it's because you\ndon't win very often and this also goes\nback to the loot box problem right I'm\nlike why do people continuously invest\ntens of thousands of dollars in blue\nplus cuz you're not sure you're going to\nget the epic skin that you want and and\nthey're there at a governmental level\nlike the UK is looking at this like holy\n[ __ ] like this is so addictive that we\nmight have to ban this across our\ncountry because this is so bad because\nthose are the those that's the way that\nit interacts with us yeah yeah that\nmakes perfect sense so now going back to\nyour original question why is it\nephemeral it's because the video games\ntickle one part of your mind but don't\ntickle other parts of your mind so when\nwe think about triumph in the real world\nthere are other things that go with it\nso when I for example when I graduated\nwith a medical degree that was a hard\nroad and I actually felt neutral when I\ngraduated\nit's a side result of meditation but\nthere's also a lot of other things that\nare tied into that right so like that\nmeans that like when I meet someone\nthey're going to greet me in a\nparticular way which reinforces that hi\nthat means that when I you know when I\nget pulled over like like I have a\ndisaster pass so a couple years ago\nthere was a hurricane and like I get to\ngo places that other people don't get to\ngo because I have an MD after my name\nthat's awesome yeah I never even thought\nof that but that actually makes perfect\nsense like people would send you into a\nrelief zone because I go it's a [ __ ]\ndoctor so like it like like if there's\nlike if there's a hurricane and there's\nlike a barrier with cop cars I Drive up\nto the cop car I show my badge and they\nwaved me through that's it's saying\nright\nso like there are other things in\nsociety that reinforced that\naccomplishment whereas like when you\nplay with and play ninja gayden like\nwhat happens after yeah you beat it and\nthen like you can make a forum post on\nreddit about it so that's very important\nso if you make the forum post and it\ngets uploaded what happens to your hai\nfrom beating the game right continues\nabsolutely right yeah and then you end\nup is a streamer and now suddenly and\nnow suddenly you have subs and you have\npeople and people watch you and now\nyou're not so different from an MD with\na disaster pass right because you're\ngoing to twitchcon\nand then then muricans I don't think so\nyeah but they didn't get into all the\nstress and all that crap well but this\nthis [ __ ] stress of being a doctor I\nmean you like like for sure so it\nbecomes this you're saying it becomes\nthe same as some level like because yeah\nI'm sure like Shroud is the best FPS\nplayer in existence right I mean he's a\nliteral god of FPS and he definitely has\nthe societal clout to back that up and\nin tons of opportunities at the same\ntime there's a lot of stress I mean for\nyou um did you do practicing like did\nyou you've um you've been in a hot I'm\nsorry I don't know what about this but\nyou've like been in a hospital and\npeople come to you and be like doctor\nI've got this problem yeah right okay so\nyou actually and that's long hours and\nlike really hard and stuff so like\nthere's a lot of stress like the stress\nof being a doctor's like some of the\nhighest stress there is right so I don't\nthink that that's stressful so it's hard\nwork but I don't think it's stressful I\nso like for example the you know once\nagain this is kind of weird I enjoyed\nbeing on call so like I actually found\nrather than going to the office from\n9:00 to 5:00 I love the feeling of being\nlike I sort of got a lot of\ngratification out of like being the guy\nbeing the guy yeah so like you know when\nwhen something so when I take call it or\nwhen I used to take call at Mass General\nthere are two psychiatrists who are\nworking overnight one of them is a\nsenior and one of them is a junior and\nthe junior works are exclusively in the\nemergency room and the senior works in\nthe emergency room and covers anything\nelse that happens in the 960 beds in the\nhospital okay and so like if someone has\na psychiatric problem overnight like I\nget paged and I go there and like I\nreally enjoyed that like I sort of like\nworking intensely for long periods of\ntime and then like relaxing for long\nperiods of time like the 9 to 5 grind\njust hasn't worked for me because of my\nautomatic dough shot which we can talk\nabout one day but well what does that\nmean that as a practice of it's a really\nold practice of medicine yeah so it's\ntraditional Indian medicine and the big\nthing that I read that says that Western\nmedicine doesn't say is that people are\nfundamentally different so there are\ndifferent kinds of cognitive\nfingerprints so just as an example\nI have a particular kind of memory where\nI seem very intelligent because I learn\nthings very quickly and I'm very dynamic\nbut I also lose things very quickly like\nI wanted to go I had a medical student\nrotating with me and I forgot the five\nout of nine criteria for depression and\nit's just because I don't you like I'm\ngonna lose it like it so my memory I\npick things up fast and I lose things\nfast and she said I have the same way I\nnever thought about myself that way\nthough yeah yes and so a lot of people\nlike think that they're not as smart or\nbut but it's just their minds are\ndifferent and you have to understand\nlike what your mind is good at and what\nyour mind is bad at and it's not just\nraw IQ there are different kinds of\nmemory there are different kinds of like\nso I'm someone who so my mind is very\ndynamic so I get bored very easily but I\ncan work intensely for short periods of\ntime and other people are like slow and\nsteady wins the race like some people\nare like you know for example I try to\nwrite from time to time and people are\nlike the way that you write is you have\nto just do like you have to sit down you\ntoday what one page a day and I'm not\nlike that what I'll do is write the\nHorta Cole and they need to take yeah\nyeah so I woke up yesterday morning and\nI was like I figured out anxiety I know\neverything about anxiety and it just\ncame to me like a flash of brilliance i\nsat down put a lot of it out and it was\ndone it's not done yet but like I got\nlike 70% of yeah yeah yeah I'm exactly\nthe same as actually create and so the\ncrazy thing is that people don't\nrecognize that your personality and your\ncognitive fingerprint is not optimized\nto certain jobs or careers and if you\nwant to be successful you have to figure\nout okay what kind of memory do I have\nwhat kind of when people have started to\nunderstand this in terms of like\nintroversion and extraversion like some\npeople recognize oh I'm just not a\npeople person\nso if I want to do really well like I\nneed time to be alone and like not have\nother people bother their me to be\nproductive and so the more you\nunderstand these kinds of things you\nknow the more productive you're going to\nbe the more successful we're gonna be in\nan aria vedic tradition has there's\nthere's there's types of bodies right\nand they're related to elements fire yes\nwater yes I don't one of them is a peat\nPitta yeah you have you have some yet\nyou're like bit devatta yeah yeah yeah I\nthink so yeah\nthat's-that's-that's soap it PETA is\nfire yep and Vaughn says water vatta's\nair and ether each one has two elements\nokay so I'm so the one way to think\nabout bath has a little like the wind so\nthe wind blows really hard in one\ndirection and then stops and then blows\nreally hard in the other direction and\nthen stops and you used another word\ncalled dosha what is that\nso Vata Pitta and kapha dosha that's\nlike the class that's the class of thing\nokay yeah so so so because of your yeah\nI'm totally on page okay because I know\nI know a little bit about this yeah yeah\nso I think like a lot of people don't\nrecognize that if you're so I'm like the\nwind so part of the reason that and I\nthink you are too so you do more than\none thing because you just get really\nbored if you just had a job or you just\ndid twitch streaming you have to be\ndoing a lot of different things so one\nof the best pieces of advice that I got\nwas from an Ayurvedic doctor who has\nstudying with and he said in order for\nyou to be successful you have to juggle\nas many balls as you can without\ndropping a single one\nin order for you to be successful yet to\ndrop as you have to juggle what they\nmean by that so that I should handle\nlike so part of my problem he was\nbasically telling me I should do as many\ndifferent things as I can and still do\nthem well I shouldn't focus on just one\nthing because he knew that if you\nfocused on one thing you become bored\nand you would yes yeah mm-hmm so now\nlike I mean I'd this a whole healthy\ngamer stuff I have a private practice I\nwas at a conference today talking about\ntechnology and health I like you know I\nplay video games I work with eSports\nprofessionals yeah\nI run retreats like if I'm just doing\nthe same thing every week I'm just gonna\nget bored and I'm gonna suck at all of\nit yeah I totally understand I'm exactly\nthe same way that's right but just by\ncuriosity do you have a similar read out\nin terms of are you betta called OSHA do\nyou have the same tendency that you\nsense to me I think yours is either more\napplying more Vata and you're more bitte\nyou also have some gafas more than I do\nI'm very extreme in terms of vaca and\nhave a fair amount of pizza whereas I\nthink you have some Vata I'd say a fair\namount of pizza do you get angry easily\nI used to okay and then now I almost I\ndon't I used to have a huge problem with\nyeah so I think your your bit the\npredominant with some amount of vodka\nand Gotha as well like also your your\nhair pattern is consistent with a bit\nthough yeah mmm okay it's very cool wow\nthat's super interesting\nokay um real quick sorry Jade just\nhosted us I don't know of any way of you\nsaw it Jade thank you very much that for\neverybody's just joining I was like 900\npeople so this real quick it's um\nwe are meeting with dr. I actually\nproduce your I actually got your name\nhere so that I could produce because I\nrealized I've been pronounced as you\nintroduced yourself before allo Canoga\nno it's all Lok I look Devon it's easy\nbuddy\nit's not all maple it's all oak all oak\nperfect just like the original Sun\nscript kenosha yeah yes a report though\nyeah okay\nall oak is a Harvard psychiatrist and\nhe's talking to us today about gaming\nand in concerns to mental health and\nwe're going into some really deep\nsubjects ultimately to try to we're kind\nof like building a profile and\nfoundation of how to be what would you\nsay be better mentally through through\nunder but through itself understand kind\nof like integrating gaming in a way\nthat's like healthy and and yeah I mean\nI I think yeah Devon so what I tried to\ndo like so you know we have classes for\nthings right we have classes for like\nmathematics in history yeah and we're\nformerly taught how these things work\nlike you go to school and you learn\ncomputer science and then you like learn\nhow to program we're never taught how we\nwork\nthink about that for subtly yeah no IIIi\nhave like the same way that we're not\nwe're not taught how to do a lot of\nthings that really used to like bounce a\ncheckbook or things like that like so we\ndon't know we're never taught where do\nour desires come from how does my memory\nwork what are the things that I'm good\nat what are the things that I'm bad at\nright we're not taught how we function\nas human beings and so at the end of the\nday like you can learn as much as you\nwant to about medicine or screaming or\nwhatever but unless you understand\nyourself you may still do a good job but\nyou're gonna suffer doing it right so\nlike at some point Devin you and I need\nto talk about why streaming is so\npainful for you like I get the truth you\nhave the strength to do it\nbut because it's gonna get into impostor\nsyndrome which is like a huge aspect of\nmy life yes so we're talking about\nimpostor syndrome oh yeah of course\nokay yes you know the first thing that\nyou we messaged about I thought we were\ngonna talk about impostor syndrome on\nday one and now we've gone two days\nwithout talking about it sure but I have\nyou know I have some thousand people\nhere right that I think could benefit\nmore from these conversations we're\nhaving so far and setting this like\nfoundation of like how we can help\npeople over the average even though I\nknow you don't like averages that much\nlike and and through that I think we can\ndo greater good than talk about my\nindividual issues and I don't think most\npeople here have that issue of imposters\nand they're probably but some people\nprobably you would be surprised you\nthink so and I think you have to be a\nlittle bit careful because I wonder how\nmuch your mind is hiding behind the\ngreater good as a reason to not confront\nyour imposter syndrome a lot yeah yeah\nyeah but what I'm saying it's like I've\nin an effort to not make it more of a I\nalways try to make shows less personal\nif I think that they're going to be for\nthe greater good but if it's if I think\nthat my personal application can\nactually you want to good then I will\ntalk about it it's good if you could get\nwell I think that you're smarter than me\nso we'll talk about that I thought we\ntalked about like you why do you mm-hmm\nwe talked about IQ I'm not smarter than\nyou\nmore aware of this subject matter sure\nI'll take more experienced any day of\nthe week sure because I think because I\nthink if we really delve deep what\npeople are most interested in is this\nthing you said I think it is not letting\nmy negative experiences impact my\nintention I feel like if there is one\nproblem that gamers have and you\nidentify this as well and this is what\nif we're if we're gonna go in next week\nand really delve deep into something it\ncan be the imposters everything if you\nwant I'm up for that but I think like\nreally trying to understand\nhow to bridge the chasm between God I\nwant this thing I want to do this so bad\nI want to be successful I want to\nactualize this in my life and then day\nafter day goes by and you can't do that\nthat's also a problem that's personal to\nme by the way to this day every day I\nhave that problem I like one of the\nthings that yeah dear listen to me if\nyou're saying that you have this problem\nin your personal life and you're saying\nthat what I want to show people on my\nstream is how their negative experiences\ndon't interfere with their intentions so\nthat they can accomplish what they want\nto you know saying you struggle with\nthat problem you're saying they struggle\nwith that problem\nwhat is the way in which you struggle\nwith that problem well I think that's\nwhat we're supposed to talk about next\nright absolutely and you don't think\nthat's going to be helpful to them\nokay so you're saying you view the\nimposter system thing as a negative\nexperience of mine so that we get if we\nunderstand that negative experience and\nhow it impacts my intention then we can\nfull circle maybe to apply to other\npeople as well yeah okay you see that's\nhis escape code says that yeah okay yeah\nDevin is hiding behind his nobility it's\none of the most it's the one of the the\nmost difficult it's one of the easiest\nplaces to hide he is behind a noble\ncause yeah it's really good I'm super\ngood at doing this yep yeah I can tell I\nprobably do like ten more of these and\nwe would never even talk about it no no\nit would be fine yeah but Devin I'm not\ngonna let you my friend I mean I forget\nabout it next week and then yeah that's\nusually how I get people yeah are you\nfeeling uncomfortable\num no I'm good obviously like like it I\nI really when I when it comes to like I\nreally am an open book\nI'm so good about anything yeah and well\nI won't regret it\num I don't think that all the stuff that\npeople actually like make fun of me over\non the Internet is not the stuff that\nactually gets to me because the number\none criticism of me is like lol you're\nyou're just to pretend you're not really\nsuccessful\nI actually know I'm successful so that\ndoesn't do anything to me so like not\nworried about that um yeah I like I'm\ntotally fine and going forward in this\nconversation or yeah so I mean I think\nwe should do that next time do you have\nother kind of thoughts or questions or\nanything before we kind of I got to\nprobably get going soon okay um yes so\nso I think one of the really important\nthings to establish base them just like\nthe subject matter of the talk that\nwe've had was\nuh sort of what I like to have is like a\nkind of like\nobjective take away so what we discussed\ntoday had a lot to do with how relying\non these sort of external markers of\nwhat mental health is or what comparison\nright like like this person is so much\nhealthier than me or this person could\naccomplish so much more than me or these\nstudies say I can do this or I can't do\nthis\nthat is really an unreliable barometer\nand that a more reliable methodology is\nlooking to yourself for answers so for\neveryone listening to this how can what\nwhat is something we can do between this\nweek and next week where we can start to\nlook into ourselves for those answers\nand stop at what what practice can we\nutilize to stop paying attention to\nthose external barometers and start\nfocusing internally more what could we\ndo what's it what's it what's an\nobjective take away we could do\nabsolutely so let me just rephrase for a\nsecond so I think that external stuff is\ngood for hypothesis generation right\nit's not good on stuff is good okay so\nlike like I think it's important to like\nlearn about neuro neuroscience and then\nuse that is is like a guide for to for\nyou to explore your own experience\nselect to use like theories of cognitive\nbehavioral theory or neuroscience or\nreading about spirituality but then test\nit yourself because to the fact that it\nworked for anyone else doesn't mean it's\nit's gonna work for you so you have to\ntest it for yourself what so you're\nsaying what is that yeah right like what\nis that will you say you have to test it\nfor yourself what I'm saying is I what\nlet's say that we just perfectly\naccomplished today\nand and the takeaway now that hopefully\na lot of people have is like man I\nshould really think more about my own\ninternal experience of things\nwhat are they what's that you've just\ngiven them a clay mold and now I'm\nasking you to help them turn it into\nsomething what over the next week can we\ndo two actually\ncauterize this process okay so well I\ndon't know about external stuff because\nI think that's even a little bit I feel\nlike that's step two so I think step one\nis think about something that you want\nto do\nand then like right down\nwhat's getting in the way of you doing\nit\nand more specifically what I'm looking\nfor yeah more specifically if you need a\nlittle bit more guidance on that so I\nthink you should write down and then\nthere's a second part to the exercise\nchances are your first answer will be\ncognitive it'll be something like I\ndon't have enough time or someone does\nthis or some someone does that when you\nactually think about doing it do you\nfeel any emotions or even physical\nsensations that come up as you bring\nyourself to do it so try to get as close\nas you can to doing it and as you do it\nor as you prepare to do it like what\ncomes up for you physically or\nemotionally either one is fine so just\nas an example like let's say that you\nneed to get a job so when you think\nabout getting a job like like I want you\nto actually go and apply for something\nanything and as you think about going\nand applying for something what are the\nkinds of like resistances that keep you\nin place\ndoes that make sense the last part I'm a\nlittle bit lost\nso like something is gonna get in the\nway like if I say like okay I need a job\nand then let's say that like I tell\nmyself that I needed a job but and if I\nsay like okay so like what is a job I\ncan apply for I can apply for a job at\nMcDonald's and I think about like I'm\nnot actually gonna apply for a job at\nMcDonald's like that's ridiculous like a\njob at McDonald's is like like I'm\nbetter than that and so as you think\nabout applying for a job at McDonald's\nwhat do you actually feel comes up right\nlike why do you resist doing the thing\nthat you want to do\nwhy do you\nokay yeah this makes sense and that\nresistance has to be in the form of a\nphysical or emotional response no so I'd\nstart by being open-ended so you can\nwrite down while you're not doing it\nyeah chances are though that's gonna be\na cognitive answer so I want people to\ndig a little bit deeper so give that a\nshot like open source you can try\nwhatever you write down whatever you\nwant to the second thing so after you do\nthat then tunnel down into like what are\nthe emotions that I'm feeling or what\nare the physical sensations that I feel\nyeah like oh I want to tell this girl\nthan I like her as you like pick up the\nphone and you dial her number like what\nhappens inside your body like what do\nyou feel in your chest what do you feel\nin your stomach and just write that down\nand then we have to and then that said\nall you all you need to do is be aware\nof that for now for now hmm all right\nokay yeah good yeah that's right okay\nwell Devin thanks a lot man this has\nbeen fun do you want it will you so\nshould we like do this next Friday - you\nwanna just I would absolutely yeah so\nlet's look as I think if we're doing\nexercises we have to follow up on them\nyeah sure okay\nand you're still streaming right hi oh\nof course yeah I would I'll stream the\nwhole thing and no no I mean like you're\nstreaming now can i raid you uh yeah\nsure of course if you want yeah Red\nDevil all right man thank you very much\nit's it's been a blast I mean thank\nthank you so much I think I I cannot\nunderstand how much people are getting\nout of this like the our our first talk\nI got so many messages dude like and\nlike I did crazy stuff on this channel\nall the time but like it wasn't like\nthis this is this is like this mate this\nmatters so Devin thank you so much I'm\nglad people are finding this helpful I'm\nglad that you're sort of facilitating\nthat help and be careful because the\nmore that that thought grows in your\nmind the easier it's gonna be for you to\nhide behind your own [ __ ] okay right as\nif you're doing really great work for\nthe masses we never need to talk about\nyou because like oh my god like it was\nso impactful for them like you see how\nyour minds doing that it's taking a\nwonderful thing and you know it\nturns on it so you gotta be cared for\ngetting what do we do thank you guys\nvery much I'll see you next time thank\nyou"
