    "transcript": "so now I'm seeing a couple of questions\nabout mental health so let's let's talk\nabout this the first question I'll get\ninto borderline personality disorder in\nabusive behavior in a second but first\nquestion is what's the difference\nbetween bipolar and borderline\npersonality disorder great question and\npeople get really confused because\nsometimes both of them are abbreviated\nwith BPD so bipolar disorder is a mood\ndisorder so it's something that happens\nto you so I think about mood disorders\nas being somewhat like independent of\nwho you are so if we think about\nsomething like the flu like the flu\nhappens to you you're not you know\nyou're not the flu you're a person who\ngets the flu and when I think about\ndepression and bipolar disorder I think\nabout people who get depressed or become\nbipolar but it doesn't change kind of\nwho they are as a person and\n[Music]\nso bipolar disorder is characterized by\nmood swings that last for weeks to\nmonths at a time so this isn't like I\nhave a really volatile mood swing in\nterms of I'm super happy at like 12 noon\nand then at 2 p.m. I'm super pissed off\nand at 4 p.m. I'm crying that's not\nbipolar disorder bipolar disorder is\ncharacterized by persistent moods\nthat are either elevated or depressed\nfor like weeks at a time so people in\nbipolar disorder sometimes experience\ndepression so they'll feel like\ndepressed for weeks to months at a time\npretty much like most days for most of\nthe day they'll feel like sad or they'll\nfeel like they have something called low\nself attitude which means that they\nthink that they're like bad people they\nthink their burdens to other people they\nkind of have these thoughts like other\npeople would be better off without me\nthey kind of have like these these kind\nof persistent negative thoughts they can\nalso have low energy levels so that it's\nlike hard for them to get up and get out\nof bed some people describe it to me is\nlike walking through molasses like\nnormal normally when we walk we're just\nlike walking through air and there's\nlike no resistance to walk but when I've\nworked with depressed people they'll say\nlike even walking becomes really really\nhard and so that's kind of the\ndepressive side and then the manic or\nhypomanic side is kind of the opposite\nof depression so people who are\nhypomanic will need less sleep they have\ntons of energy they have really great\nideas they kind of like think that\nthey're they they're able to perform\nactually at a very high level\ninteresting side note is that at Harvard\nCollege which is the undergrad the\nincidence of of people who are hypomanic\nand bipolar is like three times the\naverage population so sometimes bipolar\ndisorder people are actually like way\nmore productive than the average human\nbeing which is kind of bizarre but\nso they can have periods of time of like\nkind of hyperactivity as well as\ndepression and then then you get up into\ntrue mania which is like when you're so\nhigh that like you don't think straight\nso people who are manic\nwe'll sort of like think that they can\ndo things that other people can't do\nthey'll feel superhuman they'll have all\nthese amazing ideas they'll wake up one\nday and say I know how to solve like\nglobal climate change like I have the\nidea and I know how to do it I can fix I\ncan transcend time they'll say like all\nkinds of like really bizarre things a\nbig a characteristic of hypomania and\nmania is also reduced amounts of sleep\nso people who are hypomanic can usually\nrun in a pretty high like a libera in\nterms of efficacy with like four hours\nof sleep a night whereas people who are\ntruly manic will be able to go days with\nsleeping very little to no sleep like\none to two hours this isn't like I've\nonly got two hours of sleep and\novernight because I was tossing and\nturning a lot of people have something\ncalled sleep misperception syndrome\nwhere you didn't actually sleep two\nhours you probably slept like six to\neight and it was interrupted and it felt\nlike two but people are truly manic will\ngo like will only sleep like two hours a\nnight or even less so that's bipolar\ndisorder so with people with bipolar\ndisorder unless they're depressed or\nmanic they are like completely normal so\nlike I could have bipolar disorder and\nI'm completely fine today and tomorrow\nI'll be depressed I'll be depressed for\na couple months\nI'll come out of it and I'll be\ncompletely\nsome people are asking yeah is it so\npeople are asking about timeframes so\nyes so bipolar disorder so in order to\nbe diagnosed with like depression and\nbipolar disorder you need like two week\nyou need like a two week block where\nyou're pretty much depressed most days\nin for mania it's like lasts it's like\none week and can you self-identify as\nhaving bipolar disorder I mean you can\nso I do think that I think a lot of\ntimes physicians like underestimate how\nmeant how much like non medically\ntrained people can like know about\nmedicine and psychiatry so for example I\nmean I've learned so much about cancer\nchemotherapy from family members of\npatients do you think that an oncologist\nknows everything about chemotherapy but\nit's amazing how much a dedicated person\nwith like no official training can learn\nabout a scientific skill so you could\nself-identify or self diagnosed yourself\nwith bipolar but I really wouldn't\nrecommend it because there are a lot of\nnuances that kind of go into the\ndiagnosis and there also a lot of things\nthat can interfere with it for example\nif you're using marijuana or any other\nsubstances you may not have bipolar\ndisorder because all that [ __ ] is going\nto be messing with your brain\nnow to kind of go to BPD which is\nborderline personality disorder so in\npsychiatry we talk about two different\nclasses of illnesses we talk about sort\nof like things that happen to you like I\nwas saying earlier are things that you\nare so if we think about someone who's\nlike a narcissist you don't wake up one\nday and for two weeks like exist exhibit\na narcissistic behavior and then the\nnarcissism goes away like an arson\nnarcissism is sort of like part of your\npersonality structure doesn't mean it\ncan't change doesn't mean it can't get\nbetter but it's sort of like part of the\nway that your psychological makeup is in\nborderline personality disorder is like\nthat so it's part of someone's like\npsychological makeup and so every day\nwhen they wake up they have some\nexperiences that are different from\nother people and in my opinion sort of\nthe foundation of borderline personality\ndisorder is not understanding like who\nyou are on the inside\nso if I'm walking down the street I gave\nthis example recently on stream and\nsomeone like you know calls me an idiot\nthen I have a sense of self and I know\nI'm not an idiot so I'm just gonna\nignore what they say right so like when\nwhen other people give me feedback about\nWho I am as a person that's going to\nconflict with like my sense of self and\nso if a lot of people call me an idiot\nthen my sense of self will start to\nchange right if everyone calls me an\n[ __ ] I'm gonna start to feel like bad\nand then over time I can come to learn\nand believe that I'm an [ __ ] for\npeople with BPD the the thing that's on\nthe inside is like really really really\nweak or even they don't really think\nit's there at all so they don't have\nlike a persistent sell sense of who they\nare as a person and so what that means\nis that the way they feel is determined\nby how other people reflect them so if\npeople treat me well I feel like a good\nperson and if people treat me poorly I\nfeel like a piece of [ __ ] and this is\ntrue of all people like everyone's gonna\nfeel a little bit bad but with BPD the\nswings are huge so if for example I send\na text to the person that I'm dating and\nthey don't respond I start to think that\nlike oh my god this person like doesn't\ncare about me at all they're gonna break\nup with me they don't care about me even\nthough it's just like they just didn't\nrespond to a text right away not that\nbig of a deal but for the person with\nBPD they over interpret that because if\nyou think about like if I send a text\nand then no one responds and like why\ndon't I get freaked out about it it's\nbecause I have a sense of basic\nconfidence that Who I am as a person\nmatters and that this other person cares\nabout me like I'm sort of settled in\nthat belief people in BPD don't have\nthat foundation so when they send a text\nin no one responds to them they start\nfreaking the [ __ ] out and they feel like\noh my god like this person doesn't like\nme they're kind of not really like doing\nthey don't care about me or anything\nlike that and so when people with BPD\nwhat starts to happen is they get like\nreally erratic in their behavior because\nthey'll do in order for them to feel\ngood people have to treat them with hair\nand they'll sort of start to learn that\nlike okay these are the things that I\ncan do to get people to like exhibit\nbrand gestures of care so a lot of\npeople with BPD for example will have\nlike pair of suicidal gestures they'll\nexperience suicidality and they'll\nthreaten to kill themselves or they'll\ncut and the reason for that is because\nwhen I threatened to kill myself\neveryone drops what they're doing and\nsweeps in and says oh my god like are\nyou okay like tell me like how can I\nhelp you\noh my god you're such an amazing person\nand so over time what happens is like\nthey get they reinforce behaviors that\nkind of encourage people to like\ndrastically come to their aid and then\nthey run into problems because people\nget tired of that [ __ ] after a while\nlike when when you get called by a\nfriend of yours and they say oh my god\nyou have to come over right now or I'm\ngonna kill myself you're gonna drop\neverything that you do you go there and\nyou're like oh my god please don't do\nthat you care about them so much you you\nwork them through it the next morning\nafter you've been talking to them for 12\nhours you leave and you feel good you\nfeel good about yourself you're like man\nthat was really exhausting and tough but\nlike I was really there for them you\nfeel like a good friend they feel better\neveryone feels great two days later they\ncall you again and then you show up and\nyou talk them through the night and then\ntwo days later they call you again and\nat some point you get burnt out and\nyou're like I can't deal with the [ __ ]\nin and then what happens is you you say\nlook I can't help you anymore I'm done\nand then the person with BPD feels like\n[ __ ] because instead of like saving them\nyou're abandoning that and then that\nlike makes the cycle like way worse and\nthen what they need to do is like\nescalate even further so if they tell\nyou like if you say hey I can't come\nover I'm busy right now\nthen they're gonna even escalate they're\ngonna say like they're gonna send you a\npicture with like them in a bottle of\npills and they'll do whatever they need\nto to get you to comment like comfort\nbecause if you exhibit comfort towards\nthem they feel like warm and fuzzy on\nthe inside and without you they feel\nempty\nthat's BPD\nI'm gonna just take a second to look at\nso BPD it's not that it's not curable\nit's just that it doesn't have standard\nI mean it has standard treatment but\nit's not like medication isn't gonna fix\nit\nBPD is something that that is like it\nhas to do with your personality\nstructure so your personality can change\nover time right like you can be an\n[ __ ] feeder in a game and like you\ncan learn how to like not do that and\nresolve your own toxicity and even over\ntime your personality can change people\ncan become less narcissistic they can\nbecome more confident in it selves they\ncan become like less borderline it can\ndefinitely happen it just takes a lot of\ntime and it seems like the best there\nare some evidence-based treatments but\nit seems like just having someone kind\nof like really be stable and comforting\nfor you but not respond to your ups and\ndowns in a differential way is the best\nway to sort of help people come out of\nbeep\nand someone just be really low in\nself-esteem in this dude apparently\nbeing afraid of their partner leaving\nabsolutely man that's exactly what I\nmean\nnot everyone who has that has BPD but\nthat's the essence of BPD so low\nself-esteem\nthat's just like think through this for\na second okay so this is the question\ncan someone just be really low in sulfa\nsteam and thus do the paranoid behavior\nof being afraid of their partner leaving\nabsolutely so let's just think through\nwhat what happens in that person's head\nso if I don't feel like I'm a valuable\nperson like if I feel on the inside that\nlike I'm just not a good person then I\nthink that if someone recognizes me for\nwhat I am that they're more likely to\nleave right like people with low\nself-esteem\nbasically sometimes feel like they've\ntricked their partners into being with\nthem and that if their partner really\nunderstood how much of a piece of [ __ ]\nthey were they would leave because\nthere's something better down the street\nand so that that's like logical like you\nguys it's really important to understand\nthis most of what people think of as\nmental illness is that someone's not\nthinking right but the crazy thing is\nthat in my experience most of mental\nillness is thinking logically it's just\nlike a perversion of logic like when we\ngo back to Henry remember how he's\nsaying like oh if I quit Clash of Kings\nagain it's not gonna go well like that's\nnot logical I think he's right because\nhe's tried it right and he was like\nwound up depressed and in the hospital\nand being like involuntary hospitalized\nwith a bunch of shrinks so the person\nwho feels like they have low self-esteem\ntheir logical conclusions that follow or\naccurate and then what happens is like\nthey they really do think that if this\nperson figures out who I really am\nthey're gonna leave and then they start\nexhibiting paranoid behavior right\nbecause they try to control for that and\nso they try to go like really out of\ntheir way to like control what their\npartner does and what their partner sees\nand how their partner responds and they\nkind of think like oh if I'm not a good\nperson if my partner goes out and meets\nother people they're going to realize\nthat I am NOT a good person\nand that they can do better than me and\nso then they start to exhibit like\nparanoid controlling behavior right\nbecause they're like oh my god I don't\nwant you to spend time with like other\npeople because then you're gonna realize\nthat I'm not good enough and that's\nwhere the paranoid and controlling\nbehavior kicks in so it's actually\nincredibly logical and that's exactly\nright a call 101 or 1001 that someone\nwho has low self-esteem is going to\nexhibit paranoid and controlling\nbehavior out of a fear of abandonment in\nthe really crazy thing is that the more\nparanoid behavior they exhibit the\nfurther they drive their partner away\nand if they succeed in driving their\npartner away that just serves to\nreinforce them that they were right all\nalong\nlike that's the crazy thing when their\npartner breaks up with them they're like\noh all of my thoughts cuz somewhere\nalong the way someone told them actually\nyou're a wonderful person and you're not\na piece of [ __ ] but when they drive\ntheir partner way through paranoid\nbehavior they realize like oh I was\nright all along\nI actually am a piece of [ __ ] because if\nI wasn't a piece of [ __ ] they wouldn't\nhave left you enter the second\nrelationship and that feeling is even\nstronger the paranoid behavior is even\nstronger and then you drive them away\neven harder and then the cycle repeats\nitself and this is why people who have\nlike these kind of psychological\nconstructs like gamers included this is\nwhy everyone feels [ __ ] stuck because\nyour mind works in a way where like it\ntells you that what you believe is\ncorrect even though it's not\nlet me just think\nuh-huh okay so domination time asks how\ndo you break that cycle of the person\nthreatening suicide and increasing what\nthey do for attention\nyou separate the stimulus from the\nresponse so we have to talk about\nPavlov's dogs for a second okay like\nbehavioral reinforcement so when like\nremember there's this guy named like\nPavlov who basically like every time he\nfed dogs he would ring a bell before he\nfeeds the dogs so he'd like ringing a\nbell and then he'd give them dog food\nand the dogs would like smell the dog\nfood they'd start to salivate and then\nto eat the food over time what he\nrealized is that all he had to do is\nring the bell and he doesn't even give\nthem food and they start salivating so\nwe have this tendency to like connect\nactions and responses so when we think\nabout someone who threatens suicide and\nwhen their suicidal behavior gets\nreinforced by someone dropping\neverything in expressing care and love\nfor them what they're looking for is the\ncare in love and if I exhibit suicidal\nbehavior and that leads to care and love\nthat's going to reinforce the behavior\nof suicidal like threatening by the way\nyou guys like if you guys are dealing\nwith something like this you should\nactually seek a medical professional\nlike you shouldn't try to do this at all\njust to be very clear about that and now\nlet's use like a simpler example so when\nmy kids throw a temper tantrum giving in\nto the temper tantrum is gonna teach\nthem that Oh a temper tantrum is the way\nto get what I want so instead what we do\nis we retrain\nhow they get what they want so instead\nof my kid is like throwing a temper\ntantrum and is like throwing things I'll\nstop and I'll just be patient I won't\nrespond to the temper tantrum I'll say\ndo you want this cupcake and the kid\nwill be like that and I'm like do you\nwant the cupcake and then uh then I'll\nsay like how do we ask for cupcakes and\nthen the kid will kind of calm down and\nthey'll say can I have the cupcake\nplease and then you go\nhere you go and then that reinforces\nasking so the first time we did that it\ntook me like five minutes to get them to\nask for the cupcake the second time it\ntook four minutes the third time it took\nthree minutes now they throw a temper\ntantrum thirty seconds later I'm like\nhow do we ask for things and they're\nlike can I have this please and that\nthat's how you reinforce the behavior so\nin the case of someone a BPD like in my\npatients with BPD\nyou know when they call me and they're\nin a crisis if I spend if I drop what\nI'm doing and spend like two hours with\nthem on the phone like calming them down\nthey're gonna call me again the next day\nso the question that I ask practically\nand this is like medical stuff so you\nguys really should not be dealing with\nbut you know what I'll say is like hey\ncan this like I can see you tomorrow\nmorning at 10 a.m. do you think you can\nmake it through the night and let's like\nmeet tomorrow at 10:00 and then they\ncome in at 10:00 and then we talk\nthrough things and they feel better when\nthey leave and so then what happens is\nthey they'll like so now what happens is\nI get a text and it'll be like hey do\nyou have any time over the next I know\nwe were supposed to meet on Friday but\ndo you have any time on like Monday or\nTuesday to me and then I'll say yes I do\nand then I'll make the time for them so\nyou provide the care and support that\nthey need because that's just like a\ngood human thing to do but you provide\nit independent of their behavior so if\nyou have someone who's like really\nstruggling and they kind of like reach\nout to you you just set aside time for\nthem like on a regular basis you say\nlike hey men like I know this is a tough\ntime for you and that sometimes you call\nme when you're like blackout drunk and\nyou're like you're you're pissed off\nthat that this chick broke up with you\nwhy don't we just have brunch every\nSunday and just like check in and see\nhow you're doing because BPD is like\nit's sort of it's a disorder but every\nhuman being has that kind of like\nthat has that structure within them\nright we all respond well to certain\nkinds of things behavioral change can be\nmodified like in all of us so it's all\nkind of I mean everyone has that I think\nit's just really important to think\nabout what is the behavior that you want\nto reinforce and not be a dick about it\nI mean sometimes you have to but really\nto try to be compassionate and sort of\nlike okay what do I want to like what do\nI want to reward my child for doing when\nthey come to me and they say hey Dad can\nI please play with this like the last\nlike hey can I please watch TV\nand if they ask super nicely then I'll\nbe like okay fine and I'll relent even\nthough they're not supposed to but if\nthey ask super nice I'll relent because\nI want them to like ask for things\nnicely and then sometimes if they ask\nnicely and I say no and then they\nhissy-fit then there's no way but if\nthey ask nicely and I say no and they\nstay calm about it then I'll be like\nthank you for for understanding that we\ncan't watch right now since you did such\na good job like why don't we read an\nextra story tonight and so you still\nwant to reinforce the behavior without\nsort of giving into it all right sorry\nyou want to provide like you want to\nreinforce the behavior that you want to\nlike you want to see more of\n[Music]\nso let me just go do you know the best\nyeah so Monte like that's what I'm\nsaying right so so there's a great book\ncalled walking with it walking on\neggshells I think which is about working\nwith people with BPD but I think the\nmost important thing to remember is that\nlike you should be relatively neutral\nand caring so you kind of let people\nknow that you have boundaries and limits\nand that when you don't compromise your\nboundaries it doesn't mean that you\ndon't care so if you get a frantic text\nfrom someone like kind of like know what\nI was saying earlier like the way that I\ndeal with patients say I understand\nyou're in crisis right now\ndo you think you can make it through the\nnight and if they say no then I'll say\nlike okay well I'm with my children\nright now and it's not that I don't care\nabout you but I have a responsibility my\nkids too if you really can't make it\nthrough the night you should go to the\nemergency room and that's not what\nthey're looking for right like so if\nthey really are in danger they will go\nto the emergency room talk to them about\nhey\num and the other thing is to to sort of\nrecognize that like they're going to\ninterpret benign stuff that has nothing\nto do with them is a personal insult you\ndidn't respond to my text that means you\ndon't give a [ __ ] about me no man like\nI'm just I was taking a [ __ ] like I\ncan't be on I can't be texting you\nconstantly and so what you've got to do\nis just be like really stable and then\ntry to explain to them that I really do\ncare about you but sometimes I just have\nother things going on and it can't be\navailable to all this do you feel like\nyou need someone 24/7 to help you and\nthen kind of have a conversation sort of\nabout that and what you can what you can\ndo and what what you can't do\num\nso aww underscore L asks while I\nunderstand there's some crossover is\nthat to suggest that those with the\ndepression are resistant to compliments\nand those with BPD are somewhat\ndependent actually that's a great\ncharacterization so yeah so people with\nwith depression have a cognitive bias\nand we'll see this on stream like I'm\nsure we'll see it on stream I'll try to\npoint it out to you the next time you\nwear some people who have low attitudes\nand like low feelings of self-worth like\nif you try to tell them that you think\nthat are made an amazing person they'll\nsay like they'll just think you're wrong\nso have they have this idea that they're\nreally just not valuable and that if\nother people are telling them that they\njust can't accept it it's just not it's\njust not true like in their mind it's\njust not true\nthey have a really powerful cognitive\nbias whereas in BPD what happens is the\nway they feel about themselves is the\nway that other people treat them\nand so if other people people treat them\nreally well like then that's great and\nthat's kind of like I mean you can think\nabout celebrities like that's also true\nI think a lot of celebrities have some\nkind of like borderline like structure\nit doesn't mean that they have BPD\nbut as our psychology gets bombarded and\nstreamers have this - as our psychology\ngets bombarded with other people's\nopinions of us we start to like our\npsychology just can't keep up with it\nand it starts to like appreciate those\nthings more and more yes sir a\ncorrelation between narcissistic\nbehavior in gaming I have a [ __ ]\nlutely man so in so many ways man like\nthis is a whole different topic I think\nwe could spend an entire stream on it\nlet me just lay it out like very simply\nso the first thing is this thing called\nthe dunning-kruger effect and this is\nthis idea that like the more ignorant\nyou are on something the more you\nrecognize the less likely you are to\nrecognize that you're ignorant so this\nis like when you're a noob who plays a\ngame like you think you understand why\nyou guys lost the game but because\nyou're a [ __ ] noob you really have no\nidea why you lost the game but trying to\nconvince someone who's bad at a game\nthat their analysis of a game is\nincorrect because they're bad like just\ndoesn't work like it just doesn't work\nright so that's kind of a narcissistic\nthing and dunning-kruger basically says\nthat the worse you are the game the less\nlikely you are to understand how bad you\nand then as you get better at something\nyou begin to see the gaps in your\nknowledge and your more accurately be\nable to judge your own skill and at the\ntop end of the spectrum you're very good\nat judging how good you are because you\nunderstand the game really well so if\nyou think about like if I'm a noob at\nchess my ability to gauge whether\nsomeone else is good or bad at chess is\nnot very good if I'm a grandmaster at\nchess I can play like five moves or\nthree moves against someone and I can\nsort of accurately rate how good they\nare so the ability to judge skill starts\nwith skill but in games what people\ndon't understand people are making\njudgments all the time about like other\nplayers and why people lose games but\nthey suck and so they lack the the skill\nto like recognize why people are good\nand why people are bad that in and of\nitself is a narcissistic behavior the\nother thing that happens in games and\nthis is kind of a completely different\ndimension is that a lot of gamers have a\nlack of confidence which in turn means\nthat they're egotistical because\nremember that confidence and ego like we\nkind of think about them sometimes in\nthe same realm but they're inversely\nproportional so the higher the more\nconfident I am them the less egotistical\nand if we think about what's the\nbetween confidence and ego confidence it\nkind of goes back to BPD so ego is\nsomeone who requires other people to\nvalidate who they think they are and\nconfidence doesn't require people so the\nself-worth of an egotistical person\ncomes from outside and the self-worth of\na confident person comes from the inside\nand so what happens in gaming is that if\npeople are not like if people are not\nconfident and who they are because a lot\nof times gamers aren't like Henry is\nlike a decent guy for example but you\nknow a lot of gamers like aren't doing\ngreat in life so they don't like jump\naround and think that they're amazing\npeople and so it conversely like their\nego is pretty high and then that that\nmanifests is like narcissistic stuff in\ngame where people get super bent out of\nshape they call other people [ __ ] if\nsomeone calls you a [ __ ] you get bent\nout of shape whereas like if you're\nconfident in who you're all like when I\nget when people rage at me in a game\nlike I don't really care it's like these\nguys are just they're just raging in a\ngame like they have no idea who I am\nlike they don't understand anything\nabout me and if they're raging at me in\na game like that's all coming from them\nit has nothing to do with me but if\nyou're affected by like other people's\nrage then that's like kind of a\nnarcissistic structure that you have\num\nso there's another question from Ziya\nwhich is you talked about mood swings\nearlier and how with people with bipolar\nit's usually for like weeks and months\nbut when people do have it like you said\nfrom 12 p.m. to p.m. like 6 p.m. when\npeople have mood swings from like hours\nwhat is that is that something called\nemotional lability and I think a lot of\nthat actually has to do with gaming so\nwhen we like when we play video games\nit's sort of suppresses our emotional\ncircuitry and those emotions are kind of\nlike floating right beneath the surface\nso what happens is like when you have\nstuff that's right beneath the surface\nit can explode and it can also calm down\nit can explode and it can calm down but\nI think the reason that people have\nthose kinds of mood swings is because\nthey never truly process their emotions\nright like if you get if you get into a\nfight with your mom because like you\ndidn't take out the trash and you like\nrage and you guys get into this huge\nfight about a little thing and then two\nhours later like both y'all are like\ncivil with each other like where did\nthat emotion go and then like the next\nday you guys like get into another\nstupid fight it's because it's the same\namount of that emotion that just keeps\nresurfacing it's just bobbing to the\nsurface and so a lot of mood swings are\nabout like not processing emotions but\njust burying emotions and then like\nthey're like a geyser like the pressure\nbuilds up and they burst and then they\ncalm down and then they burst and so\nwhat you really got to do if you want to\nstop a geyser from exploding like you\nhave to vent it out right you have to\nget all the pressure out and that's\naccomplished in things like therapy\nthrough meditation and things like that\nChinn time was saying yeah just curious\nI had a situation back in freshman year\nin college where a friend was suicidally\ndepressed I ended up falling into the\ncycle of always being there for him and\nmaking the situation worse as he\nescalated yeah man that's tough like\nthat's exactly what that's the situation\nright that you become this person's\npressure valve and then as they vent\ntheir pressure into you you start\ngetting exhausted you can't be their\npressure valve anymore and then they\nescalate\nand the more they escalate then you like\ndig deep and even though you've been\ntalking them through the night every\nnight for three days in a row when they\nsay like yeah this is the time man this\nis the time I really need you if you\ncan't come over I'm really gonna do it\nthen you go over there and you're just\nreinforcing that behavior\nand so\nsomeone at Scot Marx asked to any help\non any tips on helping a friend with\nparanoid delusions look guys I really\ncan't give you medical advice over the\ninternet so I'd say if your friend\nactually has paranoid delusions or if\nyou know people who are suicidal like\nyou should not try to fix this like it's\none thing to be a friend and it's one\nthing to understand behavioral\nreinforcement but if you have really\nhave people who are suicidal that you're\ntalking to you should really encourage\nthem to get professional help and same\nwith paranoid delusions like I think\nthat you know twitch chat is brilliant\nand can accomplish all kinds of things\nbut we're really talking about like\ntried-and-true suicidality and paranoid\ndelusions and even BPD for that matter\nlike they need professional help and so\nthat's what you guys should really be\ndoing and encourage them to do that\nbecause they're much more likely to\nlisten to you than they are to like\nactually listen to a clinician so many\nof the people that actually end up in my\noffice or because someone they care\nabout and someone that cares about them\nand someone that they trust told them\nthey're like hey I really think you\nshould see a psychiatrist and then they\nlike wind up in my office and thank God\nthat that person existed because without\nthat friend like that person would have\nnever sought help so I think the most\nimportant thing that you can do is\ninstead of trying to tackle it all on\nyour own because you may be able to you\nmay not be able to you may be doing your\nfriend a disservice it may be bigger\nthan you realize there may be issues\nthat you don't even know to think about\nlike is this person being abused are\nthey using drugs like you may not know\nthat stuff and all that stuff factors in\nsend them to a professional and\nencourage them to do that or send them\nto the stream and show them that\nhopefully professionals are scary\nso then a call 1001 asks however how can\nyou control for external factors I'm\nassuming in this factions in that\nsituation for example if someone is\ngetting into the cycle if the targeted\nperson doesn't give them the positive\nreinforcement then the instigator just\ngoes off for someone else who does give\nthem that you can't control for that\nright like so first of all you can't\ncontrol what someone else does and so\nwhen dealing with BPD like I think it's\nI mean so what I do I don't try to\ncontrol the person's family what I\nreally try to do is show the person\nthemselves the pattern and once you show\nthe person the pattern if you can get\nthem to recognize that then real change\nstarts to happen like BPD doesn't work\ngreat I mean there is a lot of value in\nterms of like helping caregivers and\nfamily members like sort of get on the\nsame page there's a lot of value in that\nbut ultimately remember that like what\nyou need to change are the person who\nneeds to do any kind of changing is the\nperson who's suffering that's the person\nwho needs to change it's not like you\nhave to line up everyone else to make\nthem change you've got a you know\nthey've got to be the ones that do the\nchange\num and that's actually so if you look at\nsort of like look up the criteria for\nfor BPD you'll see that one of them is a\nhistory of intense and unstable\nrelationships and it's exactly for the\nreason that a call 1001 said because\nwhat happens is like one person doesn't\ngive them the positive reinforcement so\nthey like ghost that person and latch on\nto someone else and they get like really\nintense with someone they're like\ntelling people that oh I love you like\nI've been dating with you like you've\nbeen dating a week and they fall over\nhead-over-heels they're like moving in\none month later and then things just\nlike implode and then they move out and\nthen they find someone else and it's\nreally sad but that's like what happens\nso people with BPD have a history of\nunstable and intense relationships\nbecause people just can't handle them\nfor like an extended period of time"
