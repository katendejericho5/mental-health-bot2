oh\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Applause]\nd\nall righty chat let's get started so\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream just a reminder that oh this\nfeels so tight oh my God top button\nundone chat welcome to another healthy\ngamer GG stream my name is allo kenoa\njust a reminder that although I a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if youall have a medical concern or\nquestion please please go see a licensed\nprofessional um so we are talking to the\none the only Destiny today uh Destiny\nand I have had a couple of conversations\nI'm really looking forward to this one\num the last time we kind of interacted\nit was like\ncrossreacting which while I love in some\nways is also like a really terrible way\nto interact with someone you know like\nover the internet where it's like I say\nmy piece they say their piece and you\ndon't actually get like a whole lot of\nback and forth so we may um you know\nrevisit some of those issues so I know\nthat uh some people um you know don't\nlike Destiny which I think is fair\nenough right so you're entitled to like\nwhat you like and don't like what you\ndon't like one thing I just want to\npoint out though is that like you know\nwe talk to people of all beliefs shapes\nsizes ethnicities and and the whole\npoint of what we do on this channel is\nto have conversations with people to\nbetter understand their perspective we\ndon't agree or disagree with the\nmajority of people that we have on and I\njust kind of wanted to remind everyone\nof that right so we're here to have\nconversations with people to better\nunderstand what they believe and why\nthey believe it um hopefully create\nsomething that's useful for everyone\nwho's who's watching and I know that\nsometimes people will you know be\nconcerned that we're platforming someone\nor or something like that I I I don't\nhold to those concerns in the same way I\nthink like our attitude is like dialogue\nis almost always good um so we're\ngrateful for all for being here today\nwe're grateful to Destiny for coming on\nand uh let's hop in let me see if he's\nready let's go\nDad\num let's see if this\nworks hey what's up\ndude dude give me a second I can't see\nyour\ncamera well that that would explain it\nhold on people can't hear you\neither okay well that's your hey hey\nwhat's up dude hey not much how's it\ngoing good I am so happy to be talking\nto you today cool I'm happy to be\ntalking to you I was telling uh I was\njust offering a quick disclaimer in chat\nand was also giving them some history\nthat for the first time I think we like\ncrossreacted uhhuh right so like you\nreacted to something that I said and\nthen I reacted to your reaction without\nlike actually engaging you in dialogue\nand I think we both recognize the\nshortcomings of that method but it it's\nstill useful yeah I mean that's the\nstreamer way yeah that is the streamer\nway um so let me just can you count to\n10 for me I just want to make sure that\nyeah what's up my name is Stephen uh I'm\nhere today to be as non-controversial\nand friendly as are we good yeah yeah\nwe're good are you actually here to be\nas non-controversial as friendly as\npossible no I just know that sometimes\nyour audience is a little uh is a little\nPrime to be hostile against me so yes so\nwe actually addressed that as well and\nso I was explaining that you know what\nwe do here is\nI I think a lot of people will get upset\nwhen you have a conversation with\nsomeone because it implies that your\nplatform not that implies it's that\nyou're platforming their beliefs so\nyou're giving them a space to talk about\nthings and our approach is always to try\nto engage in dialogue and that becomes\nespecially important for people that we\ndon't necessarily agree with sure um\njust one thing I'm trying to sort out so\nyou're a little bit offc Center for me\nshould I move the the camera or are you\num you know it's hold on yeah there we\ngo perfect thank you\nso\noh what what do you want to talk about\ntoday anything in\nparticular um no I guess what have you\nguys been doing lately um I've been\ntraveling a\nlot um I've been uh going on like\npodcasts and stuff so I I think we've\nbeen getting more invitations for me to\ngo to places which I'm sure you're\nfamiliar with because I've seen you've\nbeen all over the place mhm um and I\nthink we're also trying to figure out\nlike so talking to people and creating\nlike passive content is like a great way\nto actually help people we have some\nindicators that uh even watching like\nour YouTube channel for a couple of\nmonths has some small but noticeable\nimpact on people's mental health in a\npositive way um but what we're what I'm\nreally like working on now like in my\nown head is how can we actually\nsupport behavioral change and making\nlike more of an impact on people's lives\nas opposed to just focusing on like\ngrowth and having more people watch you\nit's like okay for the people that are\nwatching us what can we do that helps\nthem actually like make substantial\nchange in their lives over some amount\nof time okay that's what I'm thinking\nabout so some of that in stuff involves\nlike uh we're doing more and more like\nclinician education so thinking about\nokay so for for some of the problems\nthat we have like one of the the biggest\nchallenges that we see with things like\ntechnology addiction or pornography\naddiction is that most clinicians are\nnot trained in this stuff sure so also\nsome of these other like non-clinical\nentities like impostor syndrome burnout\nso there isn't like formal training in\nthis and the default is like okay if you\nhave a problem with imposter syndrome go\nsee a therapist but nowhere in you know\nthe certification of a therapist and The\nLure of a therapist and the curriculum\nof a therapist are they required to\nlearn about burnout so we're seeing like\nall kinds of challenges in our school\nsystems in our uh mental health\nprofessionals um and so we're trying to\naddress those\ngaps gotcha what do you think um I know\nyou brought up um I think you said porn\ngaming and imposter syndrome are these\nlike the most common people that you see\nthrough your I don't know through your\nchats through the um coaching and\neverything you do is there like a common\nset of problems where you see people\nhave like these things yeah I'd say that\nlike relationship sh with technology are\nprobably number one so whether that's\nvideo games whether that's pornography\nwhether that's social media so I I think\nthat in all cases these so the the fact\nthat there's a digital\nintervention yeah anyone who uses a\ndigital intervention is using certain\nmethodologies to increase the engagement\nof that digital intervention okay and so\nthat increase in engagement\nmeans less uh more more utilization of\nthe thing which then moves us closer to\naddiction which then costs people time\nin other dimensions of their life so I'd\nsay Tech addiction is number one okay\ncan I tell you something that's very\nvery very annoying to me yeah um so I'm\nsure you see on the internet there's a\nlot of feelings about um you've got like\ncapitalism communism uh in terms of like\natomization of society and how\ncapitalism alienates us you've got\npeople that complain about loss of\nreligion you've got people that talk\nabout red pill and femin ISM and all of\nthese people have all these ideas about\nwhat's going on with society and I feel\nlike it's not very sexy or fun to talk\nabout but I honest to God feel like 90%\nof the changes that like young people\nare going through have to do with cell\nphones and the internet and it blows my\nmind that nobody talks about that I feel\nlike if you look at the vast majority of\nwell let me qualify I'm sorry when I say\nnobody talks about that I mean when\npeople are talking about diagnosing\nsocial ills it's always uh it's got like\nsuch a heavy like political or like uh\nyou know you know some sort of like\ncritical analysis of society but it\nfeels like people don't talk enough\nabout how much cell phones in the\ninternet have fundamentally altered\nevery single aspect of our lives in like\nan unrecognizable\nway uh yeah I mean I agree I don't get\nquite as frustrated I think but what\nwhat's frustrating about that to\nyou um I I feel like the substitution of\nreal life interactions and the the like\nthe I guess The Disappearance of more\nand more places where um I've got a\nfriend that calls them warm places where\nbasically it's places where you go and\num when humans are around other humans\nopportunities for relationships for\nfriendships for collaboration like these\nthings just kind of organically Sprout\nand those places are slowly disappearing\nand they're being replaced by more and\nmore online spaces which have some major\nbenefits and some major downsides and I\nfeel like that's like fundamentally\naltering the fabric of how we all relate\nto other like for like a more tangible\nPoint um I keep seeing these like charts\ngoing around where you can see like oh\nhow do you meet a girlfriend or\nboyfriend and it's like the vast\nmajority meet through friends some meet\nthrough like school or work and then\nlike as of 10 years ago you see like\nonline stuff go from 0% to like 65% in\nterms of like how we meet our\nsignificant others now and it's just\ncrazy to me that there isn't um like I I\ncan't imagine I'm sure I think I think\nyou're a tad older than me right I'm 35\num I can't imagine like living in school\nwith social media like just imagining\nthe pressure of I have to go home and\nnow I'm still 100% connected to every\nsingle person that is unbelievable to me\nand I feel like people don't talk about\nit as much as it as much as I would\nimagine it would warrant yeah yeah so\nso you know it's interesting because I I\nthink people do talk about it I I think\nit's it's so funny because it's almost\nlike exactly what you're describing is\nlike what you're running into which is\nthat so you're saying okay like people\nblame capitalism people BL blame\ncommunism and you're saying people\nthe problem is that people don't talk\nabout the the loss of third spaces or\ncell phones or the internet there are a\nlot of people talking about that sure it\nmight it might be also that I select for\nthese obvious I think that's what's\ngoing on right I'm falling victim to my\nown ex exactly right so now based on\nyour social media algorithm you were\nseeing like oh everyone is like\nmisdiagnosing the problem or you are now\nattributing so for someone else oh\neverything that's wrong in the world is\ncapitalism and now for you kind of I'm\nI'm oversimplifying here and I don't\nactually think you think this but you\nknow everything wrong with the world is\nthat people don't talk about the\nfundamentals I I think a lot of people\nare talking about the fundamentals okay\nthat's good the challenge is that I\ncompletely agree with you that the the\nproblem is that the question of cell\nphone and internet use is being talked\nabout in\nplaces that are separated from cell\nphone and internet\nuse right so like wait can you repeat\nthat the places where people are talking\nabout it are largely that's not\nprecisely true we I'll give a couple\nexamples to it the problem is the places\nthat these discussions are happening are\nnot to the audience that needs to oh so\nit's like Educators talking to\npsychologists or like therapists talking\nto instead of talking children if you go\nto like the American Psychiatric\nAssociation conference which is actually\nhappening right now like the the amount\nof time they spend on digital stuff and\nthe impact of the internet has\nskyrocketed yeah okay gotcha gotta and\nbut you do have some popular media\npeople like I think um you know there's\nthis guy named Jonathan height I've\nnever met the dude but he's like wrote a\nbook and is advocating for like\nbasically no cell phone use under the\nage of 16 I I kind of agree yeah geez\nand and so so there are people talking\nabout it I think he's getting like\nmainstream traction and stuff like that\nso I think and and you know I'm also\nlike part of\nthis you know this task force that is\ndefining like some of the the nature of\npeer support for addictions and things\nlike that so like these conversations\nare happening but I I think the\nchallenge is that the people who are\nfalling victim to this are usually on\nthe internet and that kind of content is\nhard to disseminate on the internet\nbecause as you pointed out it's not sexy\nand what most people resonate with is\nlike emotional activation that's what\npushes\ncontent yeah yeah 100% agree yeah they\num yeah\nyeah I I think um to kind of Riff Off of\nthat a little bit so I I think one of\nthe biggest challenges that I see in our\nsociety is that we've uh we don't hone\nour perception so this is kind of like\nhas been my shtick for the last 18\nmonths where if you look at like what we\nwork on so we'll work on things like\nemotions we work on things like logic\nbut human beings generally speaking do\nnot question their perception their\nperception is very um very like\natrophied or underdeveloped can you be a\nlittle bit more when you say perception\ndo you mean like how we introspect on\nourselves um how we\npeople literally how we perceive so so\nthere's a great yogic con called\nglish means coloring so if you look at\nthe way that you interact with the world\nthe world is like objective but then\nyour mind adds some color to what you\nsee or what you perceive so if I if I\ntext you and you don't text me back\nwithin 10 minutes the fact of the matter\nis that you haven't texted me back in 10\nminutes but then what happens is my mind\nattaches a significance to that yeah and\nwhat happens on the Internet is that\nwe're reacting to all of this stuff like\ntweets or whatever um and then like we\ndon't look at what our mind so we judge\nsomething when we say this person is bad\nbecause I see their tweet what we don't\npay attention to is what is all the\nambiguity that my mind fills in which is\nactually a lot especially on places like\nTwitter because the shorter form content\nis the more your mind has to fill in\nyeah it's like when you remember old\nvideo games is looking way better than\nthey actually were and then you go back\nand you look at you're like wait a\nsecond yeah absolutely right so our mind\nadds quite a bit to the equation and I\nthink the whole problem is we we don't\nrealize that and furthermore the less we\nrealize it the more what our mind adds\nto the equation goes out of our control\nmhm so literally in the process of\npsychotherapy what we do is you have an\ninteraction with someone like let's say\nlike someone has has a history of trauma\nand then they go through the world and\nthen their brain interprets these\nstimuli with through the lens of trauma\nso literally in Psychotherapy for trauma\nwhat we do is go through the process of\nremoving what your mind is adding to the\nequation the implication we do the same\nthing in social anxiety oh this person\nlike you know didn't do XYZ and\ntherefore this means this so we know\nthat this process has a lot of clinical\nbenefit and so in the yogic system what\nwe try to do is Aisha which is remove\nall the colorings of our mind and then\nyou have a direct perception of the\nworld as it is interesting okay the um\none thing that's very frustrating is I\ndon't like that therapy has such a heavy\nconnotation about treating an illness\nwhen I feel like there are things that\nwe talk about relating to therapy so\nyou're talking about getting a more\naccurate perception of the world that\neverybody should practice you know um\nthe not not necessarily accusing you of\ndoing or anything but like like it's\nfunny because there have been times\nwhere I've sat in on friends like doing\ntherapy because they wanted to help like\nreinforcing stuff outside of therapy and\nI learned things inside of their therapy\nsession that is like incredibly helpful\nfor me um which I I think is interesting\num one thing that you when you talk\nabout the perception it's so funny\nbecause I think that when you navigate\nthe world in any other discipline at\nleast from my personal experience uh you\ntypically you learn not to ever trust\nyourself because you know that your mind\nis an imperfect Record Keeper you know\nthat it's impossible you to keep track\nof yourself while you're performing\nyourself and when you practice things\nyou're always like recording and\nwatching later so for instance if you're\npracticing music uh if a teacher walks\nby and they catch you practicing without\na metronome he's going to he's going to\nkill you like like what are you're\nwasting your time you don't know if\nyou're on time or not you have to have a\nmetronome going um or if you are you\nknow if you're doing a practice for a\nspeech you're recording yourself or\nyou're uh recording yourself on a\nrecorder you're playing it back um yeah\nthe the idea of like taking videos and\nthen watching later when you can just\nfocus on 100% perceiving what you're\ndoing instead of trying to remember\nremember what you're doing and doing it\nall at the same time is so common in\nother things but when it comes to yeah\nhow we interact with loved ones or\nfriends or when we have social\ninteractions or whatever we don't like\nhave that same habit of going back to I\nguess like kind of review it but then we\nhave very strong impressions of exactly\nwhat happened and I've caught myself\nsometimes going back and reading\nconversations somebody's like oh you\nthought I was so mad at you and I wasn't\nand I'm like no you were so and I'll go\nback and I'll read it I'll be like I'm\nI'm I'm out of control here wait what's\nhappening yeah and it's yeah it's funny\nI feel like being able to go back and\nreview prior interactions is actually\nreally insightful and hopefully makes\nyou a little bit more humble in terms of\nhow well you understand your own\nbehavior or gives you yeah more insight\ninto it uhhuh yeah I mean I I would I\nwould agree that that would be\nincredibly helpful um so so we certainly\nsee that in like Psychotherapy training\nwe do that when we're uh like it's part\nof our coaching curriculum is like you\nknow things like roleplay and offering\nfeedback I I wouldn't say that I don't\nthink the majority of people do that\nthough I would actually say that like in\nin my experience the majority of\nprofessional work does not not have\nreview of your work is a formal process\nso if you look at someone who's like\nworking at some you know office that\ndoes tax prep like I don't think like\nyou know I don't think they're going\nback in like re auditing the taxes that\nthey've done for their clients to see\nwhat could have been improved I think\nlike dedicated performance Improvement\nis absolutely there for the examples you\nmentioned which is like performers sure\nright so you watch game tape you do\nreplay analysis but the majority of\npeople just assume like so for medical\ndoctors is like a really good example\nwhere we actually don't do this much at\nall so there are some situations where\nwe'll do this like so so we have um uh\nlike a conference called Eminem usually\nlike this is an academic medical centers\nwhich is not where most people are so\nEminem is morbidity and mortality and\nbasically every month someone selects a\ncase that didn't go ideally and then we\ndig into it and we try to understand\nwhat could what could have been done\nbetter um it's usually presented by the\nperson who is the subject of the case so\nhere's a patient I had here's what ended\nup happening here's what I understood\nabout it and then people will kind of\ndiscuss it but that kind of like replay\nanalysis is largely absent for most of\nlife oh interesting I would have\nimagined that would have carried over\nbecause every field that I've been\ninvolved in like uh if you go to the gym\npeople will say record your lifts in\ncase you're Ming something up if yeah if\nyou're doing music you've got to be\nrecording what percentage of people\nrecord their lifts and watch them at the\ngym um well I mean at the very least\nit's like a known expected thing I guess\nI wonder how many musicians record the\nthemselves playing and listen back to\ntheir audition tapes yeah I don't know I\nguess I don't know that maybe I just got\nlucky I was in good\nschools I I think that like when you\nhave formal education sure but like so\nthere's studies that show that within\nfive years so there's this\nassumption that experience leads to\nImprovement so there are studies that\nshow within the first two to five years\nof finishing your medical training you\nbasically like determine what your rank\nas a doctor is and then you stay\nrelatively static and the difference\nbetween the people who are in the top\nrank and the bottom rank are their is\ntheir method of\nlearning and so there's an assumption\nthat if you've been practicing medicine\nfor 30 years you will be better at it\nthan someone who knows less there's a\nreally great set of studies out of this\nplace called the martini Clinic which is\na clinic in Germany that focuses\nentirely I think on GI surgery so\nthey're super super specialized people\nfrom all over the world come there and\npart of the reason that their outcomes\nare really really good is because they\nhad I think the chief of their like GI\nsurgery program had to go through\nremedial training because he did not\nmeet the metrics that people below him\nlike he did not meet the the metrics so\nhe had to go through it too so this this\nprocess of systematic Improvement is\nactually like I think in the minority\nlike most people just show up do their\nthing and rely on\nrelatively systemic issues of process\nimpr right performance reviews at work\nand they like collect something and it's\njust like kind of a stock sort of thing\nyou're probably right I think I think I\nactually probably agree with that it's\ndepressing but yeah it's like that's I'm\nsure I've said this to you before or\nyou've said it to me like the idea that\num in high school you learn that\npractice makes perfect and then when you\nget to College they tell you that's\nabsolutely not true perfect practice\nmakes perfect and the way that you\npractice and the way that you train is\nfar more important than the hours that\nyou spend just grinding away at\nsomething yeah yeah I mean I've been\nI've been stuck at basically the same\nrank in Dota for the last five or six\nyears and I started working with a coach\nand like you know I've gained about 60%\nyeah I've moved up by like 60 like\npercent of MMR within like two months\ngeez so what are you now like 1700 I'm\njust kidding I'm so sorry you made fun\nof my league R before I take person I\nwas 1700 when I started I'm like\n2,800 now so fair enough well listen I\ngrinded league for four years and I\ncouldn't make it to Diamond four again\nso you know what we all have our faults\nyeah it's fair\nenough I kind I kind of wish I was back\nat the 17 unds cuz then I could dumpster\nall those noobs finally that I\nknow the um or no sorry God yeah yeah\nwell so so you asked me what I've been\nup to what have you been up\nto um uh all sorts of stuff yeah running\naround arguing with people doing\neverything online um finally got my\nlittle podcast stuff started so got a\nstudio downstairs and I'm running those\nshows and yeah climbing and growing and\nall that good stuff yeah yeah what what\nso you know Destiny I I've been you\nprefer Destiny or Steven Steven's good\nyeah okay so Stephen I you know I like\nI've been watching your stuff for God\nyears and years and years and I think we\nhad our first like interaction like four\nyears ago or something um and I've\nnoticed that there's been like despite\nthe fact that you got like you know\nremoved from certain platforms it seems\nlike your attraction has grown immensely\nhow do you understand that\nchange um like as in like why do I think\nI'm growing or yeah like what's changed\nbecause I don't I don't see in some ways\ntoo much different in some subtle ways I\nsee a big difference um but but I I\nthink that you know you've been like\nyou've been basically making content for\nyears and years and years and I've seen\nuh what I would perceive or assume to\nbe a different yield on a similar\neffort oh sure I think that um uh\nwithout s self aggrandizing um coming\noff of what we just talked about I I put\na lot of work into introspection and\ninto like iterating on things that I've\ndone uh so for to ground that out say\nwe're doing like debates or whatever I\nspent a lot of time thinking about uh\nwhat are the facts that I need for a\ndebate and then how do I want to present\nthose facts and then how do I want to\ncome off afterwards and then how do I\nwant to respond to responses like these\nare things that I spent a great deal of\ntime like sometimes I'll be on stream\nwriting out notes for like okay well in\nthis conversation I think I want to be\nmore aggressive and I really want to\nfocus on this thing and I'm not going to\nlet this person get away with this point\nand I put a lot of work into reviewing\nlooking at reactions and responses to\nthings and then adjusting my behavior\nbased on that and I think over I've been\nstreaming for like 15 years now and then\ndoing politics maybe for eight years\nlike I've kind of seen what works I've\nseen what doesn't work um I've got a lot\nof experience so I can see kind of like\nI can pull back and see kind of like the\nups and downs and stuff I can see the\nmistakes that other people make and then\nyeah I think it's just been kind of like\nslowly reiterating um through that\nprocess over and over again and that's\nkind of where I'm at now okay that\nthat's interesting when did you start\nthis process of like let's say call it\nreplay\nanalysis um probably I don't know 20\nlike 2011 uh because my background is I\nplayed uh Starcraft 2 professionally\nsemi-professionally whatever and in\nStarcraft uh the way that you play is\nyou grind and grind and grind and as\nyou're playing uh let's say that you uh\nyou play a certain race you run into\ncertain build and you lose to it okay\nwell uh I'm going to try making my\nHatchery one Supply sooner or I'm going\nto try uh scouting this Overlord 30\nseconds sooner or I'm GNA and you like\nkind of slowly tweak things until you\ncan defeat it and that kind of iterative\nlearning process got super hammered into\nmy brain um one through music I went to\ncollege for music and then two through\nStarcraft and then I mean I think you're\ncan apply the same skill set probably to\nalmost anything in life and then debates\nand everything were the next thing yeah\ninteresting so so you I you haven't se\nnoticed uh uh or you would not so so\nthere hasn't been much\nchange um I mean I mean things it kind\nof feels like sometimes in life um it\nfeels like you you work at stuff and\nthen you kind of like whoop and then you\nkind of work at stuff and then it's like\nwhoop and then you kind of work at stuff\nso like it probably there like a feeling\nthat I kind of like plateaued for a bit\nand then something happens and then it\nfeels like I've got a big bump and then\nit kind of like that um so no I don't\nthink I don't think over the past the\nbiggest change is is seven months ago or\nsix months ago is probably um ADHD uh\nmedication but aside from that I think\neverything's just kind of been like\nsmall tweaks and then once you've made\nthe small tweaks and you've prepared\nyourself you're waiting for kind of the\nopportunities and then you know luck is\npreparation means opportunity then an\nopportunity happens and then you jump on\nit and then you kind of like continue to\nmove from there I would say yeah\ninteresting so so and I'm kind of\ncurious if this is okay to talk like is\nthis interesting to you or would you\nrather talk about yeah for sure whatever\nyou want to talk about yeah um so I'm\ncurious what your like personal\nexperience of the fluctuations and how\nthe world receives you is so do you do\nyou feel like before this stuff happened\nlike how did you feel about it how do\nyou feel about yourself now so it's\nclear to me that I'm kind of curious\nabout your subjective experience of this\nas opposed to the objective process of\nimprovement and growth yeah I don't know\nif it's because I grew up um if I've got\nthat uh dismissive avoidant uh archetype\nor whatever I'm not whatever it is um I\ngrew up very um uh I think I'm very\nemotionally uh independent of other\npeople's evaluations of me so I think\nit's pretty normal that people if you're\nin a room and there's 10 people uh\nsaying you're uh you know a big meanie\nyou start to feel like a big meaning I\nthink it's a really normal human\nresponse is that we kind of reflect uh\nwhat other people say about us into\nourselves um and I don't seem to do that\nas much so it gives me a lot of\nresilience in terms of dealing with\npeople publicly obviously I have\nconversations and obviously there's a\nlot of people have very strong opinions\nabout me that I feel are not true but it\ndoesn't like negatively affect me\nemotionally but for whatever reason also\nI think also I hope I have like the\nintellectual humility to understand that\nlike well have a whole bunch of people\ndisagree with a certain thing I need to\nbe very careful because I'm essentially\nwaiting into an arena where I'm saying\nwell I'm right and these 150,000 people\nare wrong and 99.99% of the time human\ndoes that you're wrong so um I guess\nit's trying to balance out um it's\ntrying to balance out to make sure I'm\nnot being emotionally affected but also\nto make sure that I'm not being too um\ntoo resistant to any sort of external\ncriticism um and balancing that out is\ndefinitely very challenging because even\nwhen there's like a even when there's a\nroom full of people saying like\nsomething horrible about you usually\nthere's some underlying fact of the\nmatter that they're hinting at and it's\ngood to understand at least why people\nthink that way um rather than to turn a\nblind eye to it say like oh we'll screw\nyou you know I don't you guys are all\nyou just haters I don't care and then\njust kind of like walk away from it so\nthat's interesting so I'm kind of\ncurious what um what do you uh how do\nyou think about\nyourself um I have uh I like to think\nthat I have like really strong\nfoundations that I've kind of like built\nmyself off of so I have some internal uh\nlike understanding of what I believe to\nbe good and moral and then I think that\nthat um that kind of like stems out into\num how I treat other people how I\napproach my work and then the impact I\nthink I should have on the world um and\nthen I kind of like try to build all of\nthat out from there um and then I hope\nthat at the end of the road for all of\nthese I'm also receptive enough to make\nslight changes in like my applied\npositions if I feel like other people\nhave shown me that they're not congruent\nwith my internal positions um that's\nlike very broad if we get more specific\nI can be more specific or yeah so i'\nI've got a pretty specific question for\nyou sure do you think of yourself I'm\nnot asking if you are or aren't in your\nmind if I was like watching your\nthoughts over the course of the day do\nyou think of yourself as successful\nuh yeah of course yeah for\nsure so you have thoughts about your\nsuccess throughout the day um yeah I\nthink about uh well I don't if I say\nsuccess but like I yeah I definitely\nlike I try to ground myself a lot in\nterms of like where have I been where am\nI at now um like where can I be in the\nfuture like am I orienting myself\ncorrectly like am I squandering or\nwasting like an opportunity um yeah I\nyeah I I try to keep track of all these\nthings yeah do you feel\nproud um\nyeah yeah I would say so yeah okay I\nthink so yeah yeah it's there's always\nlike the it's everything is like a\neverything has to be a moderation like\nif I I don't want to like imposter\nSynder myself and like oh no I should be\ndoing everything so much better but I\nalso don't want to be like you know\nresting on my Laurels and be like ah\nI've done so well like I can basically\njust Coast from here on out so yeah it's\nthere's like a there's like an idealized\nversion of myself that I'm kind of\naiming for I'm really happy with where\nI'm at I understand I could be doing\nbetter um so I keep kind of like\nstriving for that higher thing I I guess\nyeah yeah it's so interesting because as\nI hear you talking about stuff I I\nactually think about like this idea of\nperception that I mentioned earlier and\nand it seems like you don't have much G\nso like as I hear about your thoughts I\nI don't\nhear I hear a lot of like receiving what\nsignals are there and also being very\ncareful about what you cultivate within\nyour mind so like cultivating really\nintentionally cultivating a balance\nbetween pride and humility I don't hear\nyou running away from either one\nyeah I don't know we might end up\nagreeing with the did you pronounce it\nglisha Kisha k l i s HT okay klish we\nyeah we might agree the wording that you\nuse though is um a long time ago I would\nsay like probably five or six years ago\nI kind of like set out to rid myself of\nall biases and misperceptions but I\nthink over the past like four or five\nyears um I kind of have a different\napproach where I think what I say\ninstead is that like I think that\neverybody probably has some built-in\nbiases so I just try my best to find\nthem rather than to to trick myself or\nDel myself to think I don't have them\none really tangible example might be um\nlet's say that I want to watch a video\nand I'm researching on a on topic X and\nI'm listening to commentators A and B\ntalk about it I might know that I really\ndon't like commentator a I hate this guy\nand I'm so primed to disagree with\nanything he says I might write a\nphysical note at the top of my document\nsaying that so that when I'm watching\nthe show and they're talking about the\ntopic maybe a says something he's like\nwell I think that uh 2 plus 2 equals 4\nand I might immediately go I don't even\nknow if that's true here and then I have\nto stop and remember okay I really don't\nlike this guy to 2 plus 2 is probably\nfour I need to I need to be aware and\nkeep track of like these negative\nthoughts I have about this person\nbecause they might actually influence uh\nother other things I'm thinking about\nand it's and that would be not good so I\ndon't know if that maps on to your\nconcept or it's like a little bit of a\ndifferent direction I I think it's I I\nthink it maps on beautifully so so the\nreally interesting thing is that a lot\nof people will ask me questions about\nhow do I fix this thing what do I do so\none of the big challenges that I have is\nif you look at some of this yogic\nliterature on Kisha so ridding yourself\nof bias\nis not how you rid yourself of biases\nokay so the yogis actually say that the\nway to rid yourself of bias biases is\nnot to actually remove it but just to\nnotice it okay that noticing and\nawareness is sufficient for digestion\nmetabolism or removal and this is what's\nso confusing is that a lot of people\nlike on the internet have difficulty\nwith that concept because our society is\nso oriented towards doing instead of\nnoticing or increasing awareness that\nyou know basically the people who\nwill will buy into that are people who\nhave enough trust in what I say but the\nconcept of like noticing is sufficient\nto fix a problem is very alien to a lot\nof people because their experience of it\nis that it requires a struggle to\nfix they they'll struggle with something\nright and then on Willpower you overcome\nit one day and then you lose the next\nday so you naturally default to thinking\nokay I need to boost my willpower so I\nwin every day they don't recognize that\nyou can melt away the source of the want\nor the desire or the conflict through\nawareness okay that kind it kind of\nremind I'm I'm using a lot of music\nexamples here sorry but it kind of\nreminds me of um when you're uh when you\ngo to college for music and you're\nstudying like formally how to analyze a\npiece and you're writing down like what\nam I listening to what am I hearing and\nyou're trying to analyze it sometimes in\nthe course of your analysis because\nevery chord you analyze comes after the\nlast one uh at some point you're writing\nvery very very weird stuff and it\ndoesn't really make sense anymore and if\nyou got a good teacher usually uh\ninstead of like looking at the paper and\nmaking sure every single thing is\ncorrect and what's going the teacher\nwill tell well hold on put your pen down\nor pencil down it should be a pencil\ntake a step back close your eyes and\nlisten to it and what do you actually\nhear and when you take a step back and\nyou listen to it you're like oh this is\nlike a you know this is an authentic\nCadence oh this was a there was a uh a\nmodulation like three measures ago\nobviously and when you actually take a\nstep back and you're just like just take\na minute to listen to it instead of like\nover trying to analyze like every little\nthing you're like oh I totally perceive\nthis thing now it's so obvious when I\njust put the pencil down and think for a\nmoment and listen and perceive instead\nof just trying to constantly write\neverything up yeah yeah it's so\ninteresting cuz I I think that that too\nis like very common where where you know\npeople will think so what I'm hearing is\nthat listening and perceiving gives you\nanswers even more so than like\nlogical approaches or analysis in some\nsituations we're not saying and a\nlittleit yeah or the the really\nimportant thing I was going to say there\nis that like at the end of the day\nwhatever logical process you're involved\nin you have to remember that you're not\na machine not nothing in the human body\nworks your brain doesn't your me nothing\nworks like a machine and everything has\nto be translatable to your human\nexperiences at the end of the day so you\nhave the most beautifully written piece\nof music but if it sounds bad it sounds\nbad um and sometimes people get lost I\nthink in like the analysis and the\nwriting and the logic and the rational\nlike what does this sound like or feel\nlike at the end of the day because\nreally that's the most important thing\nin my opinion yeah that's that's I'm\nlearning a lot because I I think this is\nalso something that I struggle to help\npeople understand right so sometimes\nwhen you're working with someone they\nfocus a lot like for example like people\nwho are super like into red pill or or\ntake whatever whatever thing people\nbelieve right this is religion\neconomy tacos or burritos like whatever\nand and they'll they'll think that you\nknow they'll use a lot of logic in their\nmind but I think a lot of people don't\nrecognize that logic can be hijacked by\nother parts of your brain yeah\nespecially your emotions and especially\neven more so than emotions your ego so\nwhen your ego becomes\nthe the problem isn't that you're\nillogical the problem is that you're\nselectively logical yeah absolutely yeah\nso you left what something coming to\nmind there's just do you ever do you\nhave any poker history background or\nwhatever no I mean I I know how to play\nthe game but sure if you if you if you\nknow a lot of math for poker there's\nlike you could do like implied you can\nyou can make really stupid decisions but\nyou could find ways to mathematically\njustify it like ordinarily this would be\na really bad call but if I hit my hand\nthe impli odds and the fact that I know\nthis guy's going to go BL you can start\nto just crazy things and logically it\nkind of makes sense on paper but if you\ntake a step back like okay hold on how\noften is this actually going to happen\nwhat are you doing right now like yeah\nyou can find yourself justifying\ninsanely stupid things and logically it\nkind of makes sense but I 100%\nunderstand what you're saying yeah I I I\nsee that a lot in addictions where if\nyou look at the brain of someone who's\nlike addicted I I don't know my brain\nisn't really fair but um if you look at\nthe thinking of someone who is\naddictive I I I kind of use this term\naddicted brain so like your addicted\nbrain will like convince you it'll use\nsome weird permutations of logic to just\nget what it needs like it wants that\nsubstance for substances especially I\nfind this to be more potent for\nsubstances than behavioral addictions or\neven Tech addiction but it'll like you\nknow justify all kinds of like thinking\nin order to get What It Wants yeah one\nthing that I found is um this happens\nwith eating and it happens with gym uh\nwhere if you oh my God you can wake up\nand there can be so many good reasons to\neat poorly to not work out there are you\ncan there are a billion reasons and\nsometimes um what I used to do that I\nfound kind of helpful was like after I\nwould do a thing I would like write a\nnote in my phone um am I allowed to\nswear here I think so yeah the note\nwould say something along the lines of\nlike you just finished working out you\ndidn't want to do it do it right now you\n[ __ ] [ __ ] okay and every now be like\nokay well it's 11:30 I got to stream at\n1 like I've only got like I kind and and\nsometimes I like open I was like okay\nwell how did I feel the last time I did\nthis like I you've never it's it's like\nthe age-old saying of like there has\nnever been a time in all of human\nhistory where a person went to the gym\nwhen they weren't really feeling like it\nand then they came home thinking like\nwow I really shouldn't have went to the\ngym you always feel better doing it same\nthing with eating healthy any other\nthing but if you The Logical processes\nprior to doing a thing yeah you can find\nso many reasons not to do a particular\nthing yeah yeah so that's so interesting\nbecause I I I just filmed a a lecture\nabout this but like um there's this\nsuper cool concept from Neuroscience\ncalled intentional binding\nso I I don't know if you you're familiar\nwith some of the I've been looking a lot\ninto like biological determinism\nrecently okay kind of scary yeah huh it\nwas a little scary but yeah go ahead\nwhat's scary about that I'm confused by\nyour reaction oh sorry um\nphilosophically uh biological\ndeterminism sounds like you have a lot\nof scary crossovers with other things\nthat people don't like to talk about\nwith the idea that um your bi your\nbiology heavily predisposes you towards\nlike pre-ordained paths through um\nthrough time and space that are scary\nand a lot of people yeah that's yeah I\ndon't know if you're familiar with like\nRobert spolsky's work but yes I've\nwatched a whole yes very very cool so a\nlot of prominent neuroscientists are are\nbig into biological reductionism anyway\nso I was looking into biological\nreductionism and trying to understand it\num so I I dug into a lot of Neuroscience\nand I was looking at some of these uh\nyou know experiments that they actually\ntalk about um where like you can sort of\nlook at blood flow in the brain and you\ncan predict with greater than random\nchance which uh uh like if there's a\nbutton and I can press it with my right\nhand or my left hand and I ask someone\nyou know tell us when you decide which\nhand you're going to use so before you\npress the button you have to say okay\nI've decided I'm going to press it with\nmy right hand or I've decided I'm going\nto press it with my left hand and what\ntheyve found is that they can actually\npredict based on blood flow of the brain\nin the brain which hand you're going to\nuse before you're even aware of it m so\npeople will use these kinds of studies\nas Arguments for the support of of\nbiolog IAL determinism the really\ninteresting thing is as I looked into it\nI like stumbled upon some really like\nrevolutionary research about something\ncalled intentional binding which is what\nresults in the repeat of an action and\nthe crazy thing about this is that we\nwe'll say like okay like we think that\nwe our actions are determined by the\noutcomes so the reward that we get from\nour action is very deterministic as to\nwhether we do it or not right so like if\nI do something and I get reward I'll do\nit again if I don't do something and I\ndon't get a reward I won't do it that's\nthe common understanding really\ninteresting thing is if you look at the\nsence of intentional binding there are a\nfew things that will increase the\nlikelihood of repeating your action even\nif the action doesn't work out the\nreally interesting thing is that this\nwill increase the likelihood that you\nrepeat the action irrespective of the\nreward so people have done rewards where\nstudies where there's zero reward or\nthere's no difference in the reward\ndepending on how you act\nand one of them is literally reflecting\nafter you complete the\naction so even if you went to the gym\nand you say to yourself This was awful I\nnever want to do it again your\nlikelihood to go to the gym will\nactually\nincrease simply the act of reflection\nafterward improves the likelihood of\nbehavior okay yeah that that's to go\nback to the poker thing there are times\nwhen you have to kind of um you have to\nyou while in poke you have to completely\nDivorce Yourself truly this is true of\nall of you should technically always\ndivorce yourself from the results of a\ngiven thing because what you really want\nto say is every analysis that you do of\nany particular thing is always\nperspective we can never retrospectively\nanalyze the decision we have to make in\nthe future and sometimes you'll make a\nbad decision uh but you'll get rewarded\nfor it and that will increase the\nlikelihood of making that bad decision\nin the future really common example of\nthis is DUI or not DUI should well yeah\njust not getting caught but just driving\ndrunk people will do it and you don't\nget in an accident so you kind of think\nin the future like oh okay yeah you know\nI think we can do this\num and because they didn't get the\nnegative outcome uh from from the\ndriving drunk once and the result was\ngood they got home they didn't have to\npay for C they're like oh okay I'll do\nthis again um and the same thing happens\nin poker where you might play hand\nreally stupidly but you get saved\nbecause of the last card that falls in\nthe river you're like okay yeah you know\nwhat actually I think I I will do this\nthis is good or you make a really good\ndecision but then they get really lucky\nlike oh I'm never going to do this again\nI'll never play Aces you know people say\nthings like that yeah you have to\ndivorce the results which feels very\ninhuman it's not what we normally do\nusually we're very results oriented but\nyou really have to completely divorce\nthe the results when you're trying to\nfigure out if you made a good or bad\ndecision that could be really really\ndifficult for people to do so so that's\na that's a big aspect of certain\nspiritual beliefs from like Eastern spir\nwhen I say Eastern I mean primarily\nHindu and Buddhist traditions and then\nthat's also something that we work\nreally hard to train out of ourselves in\nmedicine so if oh right because like\nlike you can give someone the right\ntreatment and they can die but you don't\nwant to so there are lots of studies\nthat show that overcorrecting for\nmistakes in the practice of Medicine can\nresult in bad outcomes over time mm\nthere's a very important bias where you\nknow if you do something and like\nsomeone has a heart attack like that\ndoesn't mean that you made a mistake\nyeah but the in the brain of a physician\nwe will wait that thing as more negative\nthan it really deserves to be which is\npart of what we do in this Eminem\nconference which is like you know you\nsit down and you talk through things and\nthis thing happened bad but it doesn't\nmean just because something bad happened\ndoesn't mean that you made a mistake\nyeah we also see that in gaming I mean\nthat's why was you know a th000 m for so\nlong yeah I L so many games and it\nwasn't my mistake it was the mistakes of\nmy teammates every single time I see\nthis a lot especially with like win more\nstrategies mhm so like there's like in\nDota there's this there's like a greedy\nbuild that you can do where you you make\nan item I don't know if there's\nsomething equivalent in law where you\nyou make an item that gives you more\nmoney so you're you're spending you're\ninvesting a lot and you basically dump\nall this money to like make more money\nwhich is fine if you're like a an ADC or\nsomething um but and sometimes greedy\nsupports will build it and then like\nwhat happens is in the few games that\nthat pays off like in some games you\njust get rolled because instead of\nhaving like a useful item you have this\nlike economy dump but in the few games\nwhere the game runs long and the item\npays off it feels so good it's like oh\nmy God if I hadn't built this item I\nwould have nothing right now but it like\nhelps you make a comeback and there's a\nlot of biases in like how people play\nvideo games yeah yeah any game that has\nsome kind of resources um usually has\nthis is true of probably every single\nRTS and true of every single uh MOA\nwhere you can opt for strategies that\nlet you build kind of like for longer\nterm but you could get destroyed in the\nbeginning or you could opt for things\nthat are really strong at the beginning\nand if you don't win early it's like oh\nGod this is going to be a miserable 45\nminute game you know yeah so uh Stephen\nI have three different threads that I'm\nkind of uh interested in in like I'm\ncurious if one resonates with you okay\none is you mentioned dismissive avoidant\nattachment I was curious what you meant\nby that okay um second thing is\nyou know we were talking about you were\nsort of talking about plateaus and and\nperformance like you'll kind of like\ngrind for a while and there's a spike\nand it just reminded me of this concept\nuh that I first learned I mean I think\nthat's generally true scientifically but\nthat I learned um when I was learning\nTantra Tantra and I was given my Mantra\nwhich is that my Guru told me\nthat so like doing a mantra so there's\nthis idea that like when you chant a\nmantra you're manifesting the powers of\nthe univers ierse and and whatnot all\nthat good stuff and that the way that he\ndescribed it to me is like kind of like\nirrigating a field where you start at\nthe field and let's say there's water\nand so you exert some effort like if you\nonce I let's say the the river is 100 ft\naway from the\nfield and then I dig my first foot and\nthen there's no there's no water in my\nfield dig the second foot the third foot\nthe fourth foot the fifth foot I can dig\n98t of this ditch and irrigate 0% and\nthen once I dig that final foot then\nsuddenly one foot is worth complete\nirrigation so this idea of like you know\ngrinding grinding grinding and then\nthere's a spike mhm um so that that\nconcept I was like super it just that\npopped into my head um and then the\nthird thing was I was really curious\nabout uh I got excited about your your\nlike the philosophical implications of\nbiological determinism because it sounds\nlike you've looked into that just\ncurious what you think do any of these\nand if you've got other stuff you want\nto talk about I'm I'm more than happy to\nthose are just the three things that I\ngot curious about as we've been talking\num yeah I mean we can run down any of\nthese three all three whatever you want\nto do yeah what do you want to\ndo\num yeah we can uh I like talking you so\nI like talk I would talk about all three\nof them we can go uh we can go backwards\nto forwards because I think that would\nprobably be uh shortest topics to\nlongest topics maybe um okay the uh yeah\nthe the biological determinism is a\nuncomfortable subject um mainly because\nof the it's people call it race realism\nbut essentially there are very\ncontroversial ideas in the um\nnon-academic world and in the academic\nworld um that basically questions how\nmuch uh mean IQ differences between\ngroups is related to these kind of like\ninherent uh genetically determined uh\nheritable traits related to G or\nintelligent and yeah I think that\nthere's a lot of a lot of people are\nscared to venture into that world to ask\nquestions which means that a lot of the\npeople that do Venture into that world\nto ask questions have very strong\nthoughts about them that aren't always\nlike scientifically based but more\npolitically or personally motivated\nwhich is a little bit disappointing um\nbut I think there's a lot of um yeah I\nmean on a personal level and on a\nsocietal level it can be scary to to\nthink of how much your upshot might be\nlimited by some kind of like biological\ncontainer like is it is it possible that\nI could never do a particular thing\nbecause I'm limited so much uh\npersonally I fall a lot more on the\nenvironmental side I think almost\nanybody can achieve really high in in a\nlot of areas um given given like\nadequate training and everything but\nyeah that was just kind of when you\nbrought that up that was my my thoughts\non that is that's a very very very\ncontroversial area yeah that that's so\ninteresting because I I I I hadn't\ntracked onto those concerns so this is\nalso because of you know my background\nand what circles I run in but um when\nyou say so I don't think biological\ndeterminism is genetic so I think this\nis like really an important distinction\nso when we talk about when you say it's\nmore environment I think that's\nabsolutely the case so here's my\nunderstanding of of you know some things\nand these may be wrong the first is\nthat mean\nIQ\nis much more variable within a\npopulation than it is between\npopulations so you can take any\nethnicity like the reason that everyone\nin the united think States thinks that\nAsians are smart is not because Asians\nare smarter and I remember my first day\nmy intern orientation at residency at\nMassachusetts General Hospital like 30%\nof the room was like South asan and I\nwas like stunned like I walked in and I\nwas like what is this like there's so\nmany brown people here um and what what\nit is is some it's a selection bias so\nthere's like a billion people in India\nand the ones that ended up immigrating\nto the United States are people who have\na certain like not I not even IQ but\nthey have a certain like professional\ncapability there's a huge selection bias\nI think we have tons of studies that\nshow that one race is not smarter than\nanother race or one ethnicity is not\nsmarter than the inter ethnic variation\nfar outweighs the the sorry the\nintraethnic variation far outweighs the\ninter ethnic variation MH second thing\nis that biological determinism I don't\nthink is talking about primarily\ngenetics I think what their point is is\nthat if you look at human\nbehavior human behavior can be tracked\nback to neuronal activity\nand neuronal acity oh never mind I just\nokay hold on I just completely\nunderstood when you're talking about\nbiological determinism you're you're\nalmost like wrestling with this kind of\nlike dualist thought of of or like how\ndo we Trace where human behavior comes\nfrom does it originate in some other\nplace like a soul or an abstract\nconscious whatever or is oh okay now\nwhen you said when I think determinism I\nthink of like path so like are you a\nhard determinist are you a soft\ndeterminist I'm thinking like\nphilosophically on that path and when\nyou say biological determinism I'm\nthinking like a deterministic path from\nbirth based on biological\ncharacteristics\nof you can make that argument sort of\nbut but I I think that like what we're\ntalking about here is that like so let's\nsay like you look at someone who commits\na crime MH so there are philosophical\nimplications because like if you look at\nthat moment where they commit the crime\ntheir neurons are activating in a\ncertain way do they really have the\nexercise of choice right so this is\nwhere like does Choice exist and if you\nsay that choice what what is the\nmanifestation of choice is there some\nConsciousness or is Choice simply\nanother part of your brain where neurons\nare undergoing Action potentials because\nthose neurons undergoing Action\npotentials are also somewhat\ndeterministic there's some Randomness to\nit but it's not like the person controls\nthe randomness basically you have a\nbunch of um like sodium and potassium\nliterally sodium and potassium ions that\nare floating around between two cells\nand if enough sodium ions touch and not\nenough potassium ions and there's a\nbalance between the two if there's the\nbalance tips a certain way the neuron\nwill activate if the neuron activates\nthen it'll Cascade down to these things\nand so does a human being really have\ncontrol over their actions or is the\ncontrol of their actions an illusion mhm\nthat is actually still and then this is\nwhere environment shapes all of those\nbiological things absolutely yeah um so\nit's okay it sounds like it\nwas a lot of what I what you reacted to\nwas a different understanding of the\nterm which I think could be fair because\nmaybe I'm using the wrong one I I don't\nknow no it's fine I understand what\nyou're saying yeah the uh yeah um okay\nsecond thing was uh plateaus and\nbreaking through plateaus\nyeah um yeah my experience uh the music\nthing comes up again and then I think in\nStarcraft it was the same is it feels\nlike as a human when you're practicing\nor training at something you tend not to\nmake you make like kind of super a\nlittle bit of progress and then you'll\nhave these little spurts of of growth\nwhere maybe you've been practicing uh\nyou know chromatic scales or playing\nsevens or whatever and you you're kind\nof like improving a little bit and then\nfor whatever reason like one day just\nlike really clicks and you're just like\nkilling it and you could you you bump\nyour metronome up you know eight or nine\npoints and you're you're you're just\nyeah you're just so much more in the\nzone that's it feels like a lot of human\nImprovement is that way I don't know why\nbut yeah okay um and then third thing\nwas dismissive avoidant yeah I'm hugely\ndismissive avoid in person what does\nthat mean um I feel like I have a very\naggressive um of a very aggressive like\npublic obviously public facing Persona\nso for debates for Twitter for\neverything else I feel like personally\nuh I have a very very hard time uh\nasking for things making criticisms\nhaving confrontations with people like\nmy MO is usually to just like I'll just\navoid this person until they go away or\nlike fig or figure out a particular\nthing myself and not like make any asks\nor requests of some other person I have\na really hard time doing that with\npeople I don't know why it's very\nannoying is that something you want to\ntalk about uh if you want to sure yeah\nwhat do you want talk about so I've\noffered three topics I mean we can talk\nabout that yeah sure it's that's\nprobably like the biggest area of my\nlife that I need to um hold on you've\nasked me like three times do I want to\ntalk about I keep saying we can talk\nabout that yeah I would like to talk\nabout that\nyeah can I think for a second\nyeah so is is this interaction right\nhere a man of what you're talking about\nyeah a little bit instead of me giving a\ndirect like hey I would like to talk\nabout this I'm letting you take the\nwheel and I'm like cool to go along with\nwhatever yes so you were you indicating\ncuz I I feel actually like\nuh so yeah so so much I mean so I think\nlet's talk about it but but if I can\nshare just my experience of this so\nfirst thing is you said like let's talk\nabout these in reverse order because you\nknow\nlike the earlier one will take longer I\nwas confused by that because I was\nactually\nassuming the opposite that dismissive\navoidant would be a quick conversation\nlike oh like and then we would like get\ninto this deep philosophical discussion\nabout biological determinism that would\nlast an hour oh well yeah the other two\nare easier one this is a huge personal\nproblem I have in my life that I think\nI've had probably for my entire life so\nit's the thing that impacts me the most\nright now yeah yeah and then and then\nthe second thing was I I wasn't quite\nsure like I I was a little bit confused\nabout the direction but now I think I I\nunderstand because I I was feeling like\nI have to give you options of things\ntalking about and felt very strange\nbecause usually our conversation doesn't\ngo into like this kind of stuff so um\nyeah so so so it sounds like you and and\nwhy why do you think this is dismissive\navoid an\nattachment oh I don't know I've read\nthrough some of the attachment Styles\nand I just kind of like uh meme on that\none I don't actually know which one it\nwould map on to if it would be insecure\njust or whatever I don't know so it\nsounds like you have difficulty with um\nconfrontation in real life asking for\nhelp\nyeah those two things yeah well not the\nthe confrontation is more specific like\nI have no problems like fighting with\npeople I just have problems asking for\nthings or um giving expectations on\nthings it's very difficult for me yeah\nwhat do you mean by\nexpectations um like if I feel like\nsomebody is like failing to uh do a\ncertain thing or if I feel like\nsomebody's like treating me kind of\npoorly I have a really hard time like\nmaking a request like hey chill uh like\nestablishing boundaries like stuff like\nthat what\nmakes that hard for\nyou um man I don't know\num the I've thought I've thought about\nit a lot it feels like it comes from a\nplace of insecurity um because that\nwould be my default assumption as like\nokay well you don't want to ask a person\nthat's because you think they'll say no\nU but it doesn't really make sense I\ndon't I don't necessarily think it does\nI don't feel insecure about the friends\nthat I have um so then I was thinking\nmaybe it comes from a place of\nIndependence and that like well I feel\nlike I'd rather just do this myself\nbut you can't do everything yourself so\nthat's not very like reasonable um then\nI wondered if maybe it comes from a\nplace of um like unreliability like I\nfeel like if I do ask somebody for\nanother thing that it's not uh that I'm\nnot sure yeah I don't know I don't I\nactually I truly don't know I bounced\nbetween a lot of these things sometimes\nand I'm not I don't know 100% why it\nbecause it seems like a really easy\nstupid thing to figure out\nyeah yeah so I I I I I I want to say\nthat there is potentially an easy easy\nthing that we can learn about how the\nmind functions that maybe would actually\nhelp you quite a bit but let me let me I\nI have an idea um or I I guess I can say\nit now so I I I think that I see this a\nlot with people who are actually highly\nintelligent and have like done a lot of\nself-development work where you're\nlooking for a answer but I think it's an\nissue of State not trait so like here's\nhere's what I'm envisioning right so\nyou're like looking at yourself oh like\nso if I have difficulty asking for help\nor like setting boundaries like that\nmany people that involves insec right\nand so then you look in yourself and\nyou're like am I insecure and you're\nlike no I'm not insecure right so then\nit's confusing like that's not the\nanswer and then you're like okay maybe\nit's about independence like do I and I\nI'm not quite sure what you meant but\nlet's just assume for a moment that you\ndon't want to be dependent on anyone\nelse so you don't ask them for help and\nyou want to cultivate your own\nindependence but you're relatively\nindependent so it's like am I a\ndependent human being no so then it's\nlike kind of confusing right because\nyou'll come up with hypothesis\nyou'll do a logical analysis and then\nyou find that that hypothesis doesn't\nreally track would you say that that is\na faithful representation of your\nexploration of this yeah to some extent\nI mean obviously I try to think of it\nlike multiactor like well maybe it's\ndifferent for some people or maybe um\nyeah maybe there's like a combination of\nthings but I really yeah I really it\ndoesn't get me any closer it's it's more\nthe same thing you were saying but I\nmight think of like two things at a time\nor maybe it's a combination of things\nbut I still don't no but see the point\nthere is that you're thinking that\nthere's a static answer instead of\nfluctuations within the mind so\ninsecurity when when you describe it it\nsounds like a static quantity okay like\nyou play D and D right yeah so it's like\nyou have an insecurity stat it's like\nit's a static number that does not\nfluctuate so in my experience of like\nreally understanding the mind a lot of\nwhat confuses people is that they are\nnot they don't occupy the same mind the\nwhole time the Mind itself changes mhm\nand then an insecurity will be dormant\nand then will arrive and then we'll go\ndormant again so you can look at your\naverage security and you can say oh like\nthis person is very secure with\nthemselves and it kind of makes sense\nright you can take someone who's very\nvery confident and stuff like that and\nyou can stick them in the one situation\nwhere like they're insecurities is\nexposed and then like they feel super\ninsecure okay that makes a lot of sense\num I I'm actually I'm aware of this in\nother areas when people talk to me about\nlike uh um you know do you think I\nshould be a streamer or a YouTuber\nwhatever usually my go-to is make sure\nthat when you evaluate this particular\nthing you keep in mind that when you're\nevaluating it usually evaluate it from a\nvery happy state but you need to think\nof like if you're miserable or depressed\nor upset you also have to be ready to\nfunction in that state too so I guess\nyeah I'm aware conceptualist but I I\nguess I don't really apply to myself as\nmuch so yeah that's a good point yeah so\nlet's um you want to Tunnel down further\nyeah sure okay so let's talk about our\ninteraction so when we when I asked you\nyou know what do you want to talk about\nyou kind of keep saying whatever I want\nto talk about do you have a sense of\nwhat's going on in you internally when\nyou say\nthat\num yeah I don't know why I feel like I'm\nI I I think I feel like I have\na a sense of like wasting your time I\nguess which seems kind of stupid that's\nso like going from shortest topic to\nlongest topic means that we can cover\nthe most ground basically so we can get\nthrough at least this and that if you\nwant to yeah I guess maybe that's like\nthe internal sense or whatever yeah so\nwasting my time so how do you feel about\nme uh like in general or specific to\nthat or yeah like what comes up when I\nask you that question what do I uh the\nfirst thing I I think you're one of the\nbest conversationalists I've ever seen I\nthink I've told you that privately and\nI've said that a lot publicly I think\nyou're really good um at the sneo\nconversation was really really well done\nyou're yeah probably the best yeah you\nit was it was an amazing conversation to\nsee you take somebody who's so hostile\nand like two minutes you're like just so\non their side and I don't even think\nthey realize yeah just very very very\ngood at that\nyeah okay I was think you're very I\nthink you're very genuine I haven't I've\nnever heard or seen or witnessed\nanything different um so I think um\nthere's another issue that I have is\nthat rationally uh if I'm exploring a\ntopic um maybe it's a lack of trust if I\nask you to talk about something that you\ndon't want to talk about or that you\nfeel like would be a waste of time um I\nthink you would say it rationally I know\nthat but I guess emotionally I don't\nfeel that way maybe I have an issue with\nfeeling like other people might just be\nhumoring me um yeah does that make sense\nis this um is this a common experience\nso this is a common experience you have\nwith other people\nright um yeah I think I'm a big I think\nI'm usually like socially I think I'm a\nbig people pleaser like I'm very good at\nlike kind of orienting things in\ndirections that make other people happy\nor that people enjoy so conversationally\nor socially yeah I'm very good at that I\nhave hard time stearing in my direction\nyeah or I just don't I do this with\ncaution\nso I noticed that you talking to you\nfelt different\ntoday okay like I I didn't feel like\nuntil now we were actually like had a\ngood flow it felt like the the questions\nwe covered a lot of topics we were like\nboom boom boom boom boom boom boom it's\nlike let's have it like let's talk about\nthis let's talk about this let's talk\nabout this let's talk about this so it\nit felt to me like there was some kind\nof other layer as opposed to like in the\npast we'll just like kind of vibe and I\nhadn't felt that and I I please don't\ntake that as a criticism but I think\nthis is maybe what we were kind of Ling\ninto um cuz cuz I I I do and maybe it\nwas the same in the past but I felt like\nuh I felt like I was dealing with some\nkind of internal objective in your mind\nin our\nconversation that I couldn't tease apart\num and and and so what's your\nunderstanding of of why you're a people\npleaser\num I yeah I don't know it's uh it's I\nmean it's incredibly beneficial uh\nhopefully in a non-manipulative way like\nI think people that spend a lot of time\ntalking to me personally I think I do\nreally really well in almost all social\ninteractions um I have since like a\npretty early age at least from high\nschool and onwards where I've really\nthought about social interactions so uh\nit seems to have like a well I guess\nit's all Mal adaptive Behavior do in\nsome regards it has a lot of benefits to\nit and that I yeah I feel like I can\ntalk to a really huge variety of people\nand leave a very positive impression in\nmost people's\nminds when did you learn that that's\nimportant\nuh around R high school for sure can you\ntell me about high\nschool um I I don't know uh it's hard to\nimagine um but I I I feel like the way\nthat I process interactions and emotions\nis like kind of is a little bit off um\nor sometimes nonexistent it's hard to\ntell but um I noticed in probably early\nhigh school that the way that I talk to\npeople or the way that I prefer to be\ncommunicated with is not the way that\nother people prefer to be communicated\nwith so there would be um like uh how to\nhave warm conversations how to pay\nattention to somebody how to use\nsomebody's name in a conversation how to\nremember certain details and like bring\nthem up and like um you know the for\ncaring about people and all these these\nare like a lot of things that I had to\nfocus and think about and and learn\nbecause for me they meant absolutely\nnothing and usually they were irritating\nor I didn't like them um but for other\npeople they were really important so I\nthink I started to track a lot of that\nmore um in early high school and then\nonwards for social interaction that\nsounds really sociopathic I hope that\nmade sense sorry I think it made a lot\nof sense okay got that didn't sound so\nsociopathic to me at all okay that's\ngood all right I had I tried to talk to\na high school teacher about this and\nthat's what he told me and I like okay\nnever mind yeah your a high school\nteacher told you that that's sociopathic\nor yeah he yeah he felt that um it was\nsomething that I would grow out of and\nit just seemed very yeah very weird um\nlike I remember one of my biggest\ncomplaints growing up was like for my\nlike the idea of like my I live with my\ngrandma when I was um 16 and onwards and\nthe idea of like her staying up and\nwaiting for me was the literally the\nmost irritating thing in the entire\nworld um and I tried to explain that\nthat like the idea of having somebody\nwaiting for me to come back like just go\nto sleep whether I'm dead or not it's\nnot going to make a difference if you\nstay up or not and the fact that you're\njust waiting on me is driving me crazy\nand I think I explained that concept and\nhe was like oh well that seems like a\nlike a very insensitive thing to say and\nmost people would appreciate that and\nyou know blah I was like\nokay tough to imagine but easy to\nremember um tough to imag oh I asked you\nabout high school and you said that\nsounds it's tough to imagine but I mean\nthat's so interesting like I I what uh\nwhat do you remember what irritated you\nabout your grandmother staying up for\nyou um what irritated me\nman I think I just I think I'm just a\nvery very very very very independent\nperson like I just want to be it's funny\nI guess because it's kind of manifested\nin my streamer life to where um when I\nstarted to become popular as a streamer\nuh social events and cons and stuff were\nvery stressful because I'd be getting\nmessages like oh everybody's waiting for\nyou and blah blah blah and it's like\nholy [ __ ] like I don't want I guess it's\nmanifest in relationships as well where\nI don't want to feel like a SLE source\nof entertainment or whatever for a\nperson so um yeah for cons I would start\ntelling people like listen if I show up\nokay it's a it'll just be a happy\naccident and we'll all have fun but\ndon't rely on me I'm not going to be\nanywhere I'm not making plans who knows\nif I'll show up or not um and then yeah\nfor yeah I guess for Grandma stuff just\nI just kind of want to be out there\ndoing my own thing and the idea there's\nlike somebody waiting for me that's like\ngetting stressed because I'm not in the\nright place at the right time for in my\nmind was like very very very stressful\nmaybe it's because earlier for my\nparents they didn't keep track of me at\nall so maybe I just kind of grew up with\nthat feeling very independent but\nyeah you don't want people to care for\nyou um I don't know I don't think so\nyeah I don't know it's weird yeah I'm\nnot sure sounds so\nlike maybe may maybe it's because I\nthink it stems from a place of um not\nbeing genuine Maybe So like um growing\nup I started to choose things to do\nbecause I really like doing them and I\ndidn't need my parents to like sign off\non things so for instance for band so\nmusic was a big part of my life in high\nschool and I think my my I think it was\njust my dad I think was left might have\nshowed up at one concert and I was\nirritated when he showed up because I\nwas like why are you even here I don't\nthink you even care about this like I\ndon't need you to be here to like come\nand like clap for me or whatever like\nI'm doing this because I like to do it\nand I don't need you here to like be\nhere one time to show that you're just\nlike yeah like that like just the idea\nof that yeah just Dr be crazy but I I\ndon't know why I don't know if that's\nvery rational or not or if that's just\nlike kind of part of my how often would\nyour dad come and clap for you um very\nrarely but they they were yeah my\nparents worked and there was a lot of\nyeah stuff going on there so how do you\nunderstand what is the\nadvantage damn it Destiny damn\nit nothing we're getting in um what's\nthe advantage\nto what do you think the child gains\nby not needing their parent to clap for\nthem uh um you you want just the pros\nyou want the pros and the cons I want\nthe pros the pros are uh an incredibly\nhigh sense assuming that you go in the\nright direction um the pros would be an\nincredibly high sense of internal drive\nuh probably a high degree of resilience\nwith lack of uh public support uh\nhopefully a lot of um like\nself-confidence or self-esteem because\nyou don't need the the external\nvalidation I guess to push through\nthings um probably ability to pursue\nprojects like on your own or with more\nresponsibility yourself these are are I\nhope yeah I think yeah okay so I'm going\nto add one more to the list Bo the\nanswer that I was looking for which is\nthat if you don't need him to clap for\nyou that if you don't need him to clap\nfor you that one day that also means it\ndoesn't hurt when he doesn't show up the\nother nine yeah right so like all this\ninternal drive and becoming a better\nperson and independent like I think\nthat's actually down like that's like\nfurther down the that's distal to what\nsecond third order yeah sure yeah mhm\nright so I think those are I I can see\nhow those adaptations like that that\nthat strive for Independence but\nbasically it's like if I don't feel good\nwhen you say yay I don't feel bad when\nyou say nay right correct yeah and and\nso I I think it's like protecting\nyourself from hurt by not caring about\nother people because if you care about\nother people like then they can hurt\nyou um yeah possibly yeah although it\nseems like at this point I feel like\nkind of insulated from that ever being\ncase but maybe because I maybe there's\nnot when you're asking for help in your\nrelationships setting boundaries and\nthat that's what I think is confusing\nabout it right so oh sure okay yeah\nright so so this is this is the whole\nthing is like you've grown into a grown\nSteven who is confident independent and\ncapable and within you there's a\n15-year-old Steven who's not and the the\nanalogy that I used with one of my\npatients is so so one of my patients was\nuh very successful in the field of\nFinance\nand they were at one of the top firms\nand and they were doing very well by all\nobjective standards but every once in a\nwhile they would like really struggle to\nlike feel confident we were trying to\nfigure out where that comes from and the\nanalogy that we came up with is that\nthere's a bumbling idiot that's in the\nbasement this is like a dumbass that you\nkeep trapped down there like you don't\nlet him out and every once in a while\nlike he'll sneak out of the basement and\nhe's like in your house and he's\nbumbling around and he's an idiot and\nthat's kind of what would happen in his\nmind\nis that this old thing would come up and\nlike control the way that he perceives\nthe world control the way that he feels\nand he hated this person so much so he\ntried to keep him locked in the basement\nas much as possible okay does that\nresonate with you at\nall\num no but I feel like I guess I the\nbiggest worry I have is that if you have\nsomebody locked in the basement maybe\nyou don't know it maybe you you drowned\nthe sound out um I spent a great deal of\ntime or try to like going through um the\nways that I relate to people or the ways\nthat I associate with people and it's\nreally hard to pick out sometimes like\nis this a maladapted behavior that I\nneed to change or is this a behavior\nthat is just like serving me so well in\nlife that I shouldn't change it or um\nyeah I think we might have even had a\nconversation almost related to this like\na few years ago where like I've kind of\ntried to change something and I kind no\nI don't think so um yeah it's hard yeah\nit's hard to figure out what should\nchange or shouldn't yeah so I I think\nthat's not how this is going so this is\nI think this is a great conversation\nbecause that's how a lot of people\napproach the problems right is like is\nthis good or is this bad on balance I\ndon't think that's the\nright angle okay so I don't think it\nshould change or shouldn't change I\nthink it will change if you work on it\nit'll disappear is that a good thing for\nyour life or a bad thing for your life I\nthink on balance it will lead to more\npeace and I would say also if you look\nat like an RCT of 10,000 people it'll\nlead to a performance Improvement in\nmost of them in your case I'm not sure\nbecause this often times in very\nsuccessful people they have these kinds\nof psychological drivers that are\ninternally painful but lead to external\nsuccess\nyeah and but I I don't I I have I don't\nthink I've ever worked with someone who\nhas regretted improving this even though\nit costs them some amount of\nDrive um and what I actually find is\nthat the drive is doesn't really deplete\nit just comes from a different place and\nis almost always healthy like I said I\ncan't think of a single case of someone\nwho is like I wish I still had this\nwhatever it is so I would use the\nSanskrit term samcar okay which is like\na ball of undigested emotional energy\nthat lies like dormant in your\nmind um\nso yeah what any\nthoughts um no not yet I\nheard yeah yeah I've heard similar\nbefore you might have even told me this\nbefore in the past that like this is\nsomething that's worth um yeah figuring\nout I think it kind of is just some\nextent I guess it also depends exactly\non what we're talking about too like I\num my issue uh on the on the applied on\nthe most abstract level was or the least\nabstract level I guess is being able to\nmake requests of people which seems very\nhard for me um and you're saying that\nyou believe that this stems from uh an\nover Reliance of s or not trust in other\npeople or not wanting to be let down\nfrom other people I summarizing that\ncorrectly or tell me yeah sort of so so\nI think there's more to tease apart but\nlike basically like so so here's how we\nhere's what the signs are right so let's\nforget about you for a second sure but\nlike I asked you about high school and\nwhat came out this very Vivid story\nabout your\ngrandmother yeah yeah right and it's\nlike so that implies to us like let's\ntake a step back from helping you with\nanything and just understand like what\nhow can we understand the mind like when\nI ask you about high school and some\nmemory pops out that's significant okay\nright that speaks to the size of\nwhatever is down\nthere\nyeah and so there's one angle of that\nbut there's there's two two or three\nangles here one is that like you don't\nwant people to care for you you find it\nirritating and why would you be\nirritated my guess is\nthat right so so you can absor yourself\nof the whole thing like I don't want you\nto care about me because then it doesn't\nhurt when you stop caring mhm and I'd\nrather trade feeling good when you care\nabout me like I I'm happy to give that\nup as long as I can get rid of the hurt\ntoo and and if you sort of think about\nit right so like what's and you can\nprobably I'm sure you did make some\nlogical argument that and you even\nshared it with us like whether I'm dead\nor alive like it does it doesn't have to\ncost you sleep sure yeah which is like\nobjectively logically it's very true\nit's also\nabsurd right so my next question is Yeah\nwell yeah it's stupid because obviously\npeople don't stay awake thinking they're\ngoing to intervene when something\nhappens to you it's because they're\nworried and they will sleep easier\nknowing that you come home safe yeah and\nis it okay like so so and then I'm sure\nin some part of your mind you're\nlike worrying less is better than\nworrying\nmore um I mean not necessarily I guess\nit depends on what we're talking about\nwhat's what's wrong with your\ngrandmother worrying about you if you're\nout uh technically nothing I guess other\nthan it but makes me feel weird I guess\nyeah there's not really anything wrong\nwith it okay feel well of course there\nis how does it what feels weird about\nit um well it's irritating to me that\nnow instead of just keeping track of\nmyself now I also have to keep track of\nsomebody else's uh feelings about where\nI'm at so now I'm like managing multiple\npeople's stuff when I'm trying to yeah I\nguess like live my life yeah okay so\nthere's that's a whole other thing right\nso so so what I hear there is a lot of\nresponsibility for other people's\nfeelings yeah I usually don't not a yeah\nI don't want to be\nyeah do you find yourself being\nresponsible even though you don't want\nto be\num there like I can do it pretty well\nbut when it's not related to me if that\nmakes sense oh absolutely lot yeah yeah\nso one of the in my prior relationship\nshe might have be spoked about this I\nmight have spoke about this like a big\nissue that I would have is like if\nyou've got a problem or you've got an\nissue with something that's really\nbothering you I can help you literally\nanything but if your issue is with me I\nI have a really hard time dealing with\nthat cuz it's a different type of thing\nyeah somebody wants to complain like\nyeah goe go ahead yeah so what's\ndifferent about\nit um what's different about it um I\nguess usually it like it it's I guess\nit's demanding from me a behavioral\nchange that I feel like isn't worth it I\nguess so in the grandma example it would\nbe like do I need to start coming home 2\nhours earlier and then sacrifice\nanything that I want to do tonight\nbecause it assuages your worry that\nfeels like a behavioral change that I\nhave to make that's being dictated to me\nby somebody else's what I would feel\nlike are irrational feelings I guess\nsounds really cold or\ndumb where does that self Judgment of\nyour of your stuff come from I'm I'm so\nwhat do you mean by self judgment like\nso so you do this thing where it's it's\nyou don't do this often by the way uhhuh\nso when talk about other things you'll\noften times add caveats but they're not\npersonally\ndirected right so you'll say like oh\nlike I have this belief but it's very\npossible that like other people don't\nhave this belief so you're very good at\ncaveat but the caveat isn't about you in\nthis case you you you frequently judge\nthe way that you see your thoughts as\ncold or dumb yeah I guess the issue is\nthat I feel like the my internal drivers\nwhen I'm talking about my relationships\nwith other people my relation to other\npeople the behaviors and everything um I\nmake statements from my perspective but\nI think I've spent so much time in my\nlife kind of trying to um pull those\nback or realize that like I think this\nthing but this is not normal so I have\nto be aware of that so I'm just trying\nto like Peg that so when I say it it's\nprobably that I think that's just what's\ncoming out so that's there this is\nsubtle okay so so that that's why I I\nrecognize your useful ability to second\nguess your thoughts yeah right really a\nreally a really big manifestation of\nthat would be um I have a really hard\nproblem with um uh um compliments uh for\nfor somebody I've been with for a long\ntime so if my partner compliments me uh\nmy immediate thought in my mind is like\nlike my partner myself like oh I think\nyou look very handsome and I'm thinking\nlike yeah no [ __ ] we're dating of course\nyou think I'm handsome why I know I\ndon't need you to say that but I know\nthat's a stupid thought it's not really\na stupid thought but I know that in the\nother person's mind um you want to hear\nlike compliments and stuff from your\npartner because it makes you feel good\nbecause it reminds them of how they feel\nabout you like but so I'll have a\nthought but I know that it's a very like\nnot ordinary thought I say it's stupid I\nmaybe I should just say it's not\nordinary other people don't think like\nthis so I can't I can't project that is\nI think what I'm doing I think when I'm\nwhen I'm caveat or when I'm hedging or\nwhen I'm self judging I'm just saying\nI'm not pro I'm trying not to project it\nyeah go ahead yeah okay so I'm GNA ask\nyou a couple of questions okay this is\nsorry because I love you bro this is\ngoing to make you sound stupid but I'm\ngoing to ask you okay so I recognize\nokay so first thing is M when\nsomeone um sorry I'm getting emotional\nuh so when someone has difficulty with\ncompliments in some circumstances when\nsomeone calls what they think and what\nthey feel dumb or cold\nmhm do you think that tracks on to\ninsecurity like is that consistent with\nsomeone who is insecure in some\nDimension um if somebody says that\nthey're uncomfortable receiving\ncompliments you're asking me if it\ntracks with insecurity and if they call\nif they judge their thoughts is dumb or\ncold when they feel or act or think a\nparticular way and they judge those\nthoughts in that way do you think that\ntracks with insecurity those are the\nthree things I think I think it could I\nwould have to see what the self judgment\nlooks like um when I say that to\nreiterate what I said before when I say\nthat something is dumb or I shouldn't\nsay this I shouldn't think this I'm not\nI'm not I'm not thinking that like God\nI'm so stupid for having this feeling\nwhen I say that what I'm thinking is\nthat like I understand that I think\nabout these things in this way but it's\nvery abnormal and I have to be aware of\nthat because if I start projecting that\nonto other people people are going to\nhave really bad really bad impressions\nof me yeah or have a very bad um I'm not\ngoing to be communicating accurately\nwhat I feel about somebody if I uh act\nthe way that I would have somebody act\ntowards me does that make sense yeah\nyeah it makes sense so this is where\nlike we also get into a weird space\nbecause respectfully I disagree okay I\nthink that what I feel from you is a\nthat is what you said is absolutely\ncorrect I think that that is what has\nbuilt on top of a kernel of something\nelse okay so I think this has been\nabsolutely adaptive for you but like\nit's weird to hear you say this and\nmaybe this is my perception that's\nthat's messed up right maybe I'm making\na mountain out of a molehill but like\nit's so weird to hear you say that's\ndumb that's dumb that's dumb because you\ndon't usually talk like that you're not\nusually so black and white you're quite\nnuanced right so you'll talk about the\nshortcomings in your thought process\nquite\nfrequently sure yeah but yeah like I\nsaid I think it's part of what we said\nbefore I try to be like very aware of\nlike where my thought process sits in\nthe world and I try to like caveat or\nhedge yeah what I would encourage you to\ndo is take a step back from that and\nlisten to the music okay right so like\nlike take a step back from like\nanalyzing your thought process and like\nnow I'll ask you so now we'll pick a new\ntopic right so like try to listen to the\nmusic okay\num what is it like to be responsible for\nthe feelings of others\nwhat is it like to be someone who can\ncreate worry or take it away to create\nhappiness or\nsadness um what is it like to have\ntrying think more the the first thing\nthat pops into my head is just stressful\nusually so stressful is an umbrella term\nthat is commonly used when people are\nsomewhat alexic which means color blind\nto their internal emotional state like I\nget that it's stressful of course it's\nstressful but what is the nature stress\num when you get a text that a bunch of\npeople are waiting for you at a con how\ndo you\nfeel um I I think that the stressful\npart of that is usually the idea that\nthere's like a thing that people want me\nto do that I don't really think I want\nto do it because I just I don't think it\nwould be very enjoyable very much fun\nfor me but I know that if I don't show\nup a bunch of people are going to be\nlike very upset or very unhappy um so\nthen the stressful part is that there's\nlike there's a there's a branching path\nwhere I can make a decision that would\nbe fun for me or would make me happy but\nif I make that one a bunch of people are\ngoing to be upset or disappointed or\nwhatever or I can make the other\ndecision which is going to be irritating\nto me but it would make all the other\npeople happy so think that that\ndichotomy is something that is what\nresults in the stressful feeling is that\nnot deep enough or is that too abstract\nstill or yeah it's okay don't don't\ndon't worry\nabout no no it's good it's good it's\ngood sorry I'm I'm I could be doing this\nbetter for sure no you're fine\nso oh look at you protecting my feelings\nno shut up you don't need to protect\nyour [ __ ] feeling [ __ ] off you're not\nfine okay I feel very upset now\nokay\nokay look look at you when I when I call\nattention to the fact that you're doing\nsomething kind for me laughing it off\nand tell you know making a I can't ever\naccept compliments yeah horrible stupid\nyeah really bad really stupid yeah it's\nmakes me very uncomfortable I don't know\nwhy this a really dumb thing as well\nyeah you did it\nagain yeah cuz I should be able to\naccept the compliment I don't know why I\ncan't should be able to yeah I should be\nable to yeah without it feeling\nweird what makes it\nhard uh I truly have no idea okay it's\nlike it's a super like that's like a\nthat's like a that's like hitting my\nknee and asking me why I just kied you\nit's like a very reflexive thing I don't\nknow yet are are you is this\nconversation okay yeah are you sure yeah\nokay you would be able to tell me if it\nwasn't right m yeah I think so okay I'm\ntrusting you there okay I can't I can't\nread your mind no I understand yeah I\ndon't think I've ever had a conversation\nthat I'm not okay with so it's hard for\nme to imagine if you were bring\nsomething I was okay but I think I would\njust say like yeah we should talk about\nthis offline I think I trust you that if\nI wanted to talk about something offline\nI think you would tell me yes and so I I\nknow we've had that channel of\ncommunication in the past so just okay\nso I I I feel good okay so let's go back\nto so when when a bunch of so now you\nhave a choice between their unhappiness\nand your unhappiness yeah and which one\ndo you\noh probably theirs you just it feels\nlike you describe so much my life yeah\nwho's unhappiness are way choosing\nbetween what a horrible predicament yeah\nyeah dude it's rough isn't it yeah tell\nme about\nthat\num I it's I mean obviously yeah that\nsucks you're either uh letting down\npeople that I guess ostensively are\nrelying on you for something Sten tell\nyou a story like I want the story that\nlike when you're like oh my God I'm\nchoosing between my unhappiness and\nsomeone else's unhappiness tell me that\nstory what comes to\nmind\num I don't know it feels like almost\nevery I I mean like the really obvious\none would be any particular story\nrelating to um people that want to hang\nout at a particular convention um uh me\ngiving I do way too much like implicit\nacceptance or denial so I don't really\nokay I okay why can't Jesus um yeah I\nguess like a couple weeks ago or maybe a\nweek ago um a few friends I think wanted\nto go out uh I think kayaking and they\nwere staying over here and they messaged\nme in the morning and I was flying back\nfrom another thing and I was like okay\nI'm just going to not respond and then\nwhen I Flo in they were like oh like are\nyou coming out I'm like oh well I don't\nknow I might need to stream but I didn't\nactually like say no and then I kind of\njust like push it forward or kick it\ndown the road and like oh well it's too\nlate to go out now well I guess I just\nhave to do this now I'm going to go work\nthat there's probably a lot of\ninteractions that end up like that yeah\nthat happened when I was in Austin um I\nthink with another few people that\nwanted to hang out um I think it\nhappened a few days yeah yeah these\nhappen yeah these interactions happen a\nlot what is the consequence of other\npeople's\nunhappiness\nuh H I guess it's a reward I guess\nbecause usually then they just like go\naway I just like get to keep working and\ndo my own thing I guess maybe that's why\nit reinforces the behavior so much yeah\nbut I guess usually if other people are\nunhappy um then ideally I guess they\nrely on you less and less for kind of\nlike any sort of like stuff for that\nthere and then I just yeah continue to\nnavigate okay so I'm I'm going to go a\nlittle bit back I mean I get that so I\nget the fact that I mean I call it a\nfact but like I can see how you don't\nwater the plants like you're not going\nto you're not going to you're not going\nto uproot a plant you're not going to\nkill it you're just going to let it\ndie yeah maybe yeah depending on yeah\nyeah so so what I'm kind of curious\nabout is is sometimes when people do\nthis they have some kind of\nconsequence from unhappiness which is\nnot letting things die this is your\nadaptation so what we're trying to\nunderstand is when did you learn that\nnot doing this was a\nmistake when did I learn that not doing\nthis was a mistake when did you learn\nthat evoking unhappiness explicitly\nright so because what you're doing is\nyou're not you're not explicitly\ndisappointing people you're just\nafking until they figure out you're not\ngoing to show up which by the way is\nlike such a common experience for people\ntoday like I'm just going to like\nghosting right like it's like so many of\nus just AFK until the [ __ ] disappears\nmhm and so usually when we see this kind\nof behavior what happens is like there's\na time in your life when you were not\nlike that you were definitive it\nresulted in someone else's unhappiness\nand then you learned no no no no no no\nno no this is a terrible idea\nIDE cuz if you want to change the\nbehavior and we haven't even decided\nthat you do yet but I think you\ndo um we have to\nunderstand how you learned this lesson\nin the first place it's about unlearning\nnot learning sure so are there times in\nyour life where you've made people\nunhappy and you've been really punished\nfor\nit um\nH I can't I can't when did you learn to\nfear people's\nunhappiness when did I learn to fear\npeople's\n[Music]\num probably I guess it probably came\nthrough my first two relationships I\nthink as I was like doing school and\nwork too much my Partners wanted to see\nmore of me but I like was either\nsleeping or working or in school and I\njust didn't really have enough time and\nthen yeah so it probably would have been\nthrough my first two relationships yeah\nokay and what what happened then when\nyou weren't able to make them\nhappy\num just got really bad usually I think\nyeah um yeah lots of yeah very intensely\nphysically abusive uh lots of cop calls\nand stuff um but I would say that um\nyeah I think the yeah it was kind of DB\num it's all good we're we're cool now\nbut I think the pattern that would I\nwould basically fall into is that like I\nwould become more and more disconnected\nthe other person would um try to evoke a\nreaction out of me and then eventually\nthat would escalate into them kind of\nattacking me until I would respond\nbecause obviously I had to at that point\nyeah\nokay I'm going to need a second to\nprocess that go\nfor do you feel bad that I need some\ntime to process\nthat um no actually\nuh I feel like when you I hope most\npeople get this impression when you say\nyou need time to think uh that's\nactually something that feels really\ngood because it feels like I'm saying\nthings you're actually taking a moment\nto genuinely consider them and then\nthink of a response rather than just\nlike going down so I that's flattering\nto me\nyeah so you don't want to be dependent\non\num you don't want people to depend on\nyou I think theoretically I do but only\nif our interests are like super super\nsuper\naligned so like if I have like a you\ncall it a writer diet I don't know if\nyou've got somebody who's like our\ninterests are like a billion percent\naligned or not a billion it doesn't have\nto be completely but if they're lying on\nsomething then yeah then in that point\nlike being relied upon is really fun for\nme because now I feel like I have a\nthing where it's like I feel strongly\nabout this this is a person whose like\nuh feelings or livelihood I want to\nprotect and I feel like it's like an\narena or realm that I excel in and like\nthese are thing that we're like mutually\nworking towards like yeah in those cases\nI think it's really fun I don't think I\nwould avoid it in all cases just usually\nI feel like my I'm not as aligned I\nguess with the people around me\nsometimes or people been in my life so I\nI'm kind of confused I think that makes\na lot of sense like when you describe it\nit makes a lot of sense there's some\nthings that I'm confused about because\nwhen when I hear\nabout a lot of your impactful\nrelationships I would think that those\nare the ones that should be right or die\nso so the\ntraditionally your most potent or\nimportant relationships romantic\nrelationships parental relationships do\nyou have\nsiblings uh yeah I'm not very close to\nany of my family but I've got like\nthat's what's kind of weird to me right\nis that like when you say like okay like\nride or die so who are the people that\nnormally in like in in a normal life and\nsorry for being judgmental and saying\nyour life I don't think your life is\nabnormal I'm just saying is very\nabnormal you're fine it's okay you know\nlike we think like okay who's ride or\ndie like your parents ride or die right\nlike they're the ones that are behind\nyou 100% your spouse your siblings your\nboyfriend girlfriend like these are the\nrelationships that should be ride or die\nbut for some\nreason th ride or die and those don't\noverlap like it feels to me like those\nare like there's no V diagram there I\nmean like my parents and my little\nsister which is probably like my\nimmediate family I would say because my\nall my older siblings are from other\nmarriages so they like have siblings\nlike I think my parents would do\nanything for me um regardless mistakes\nthey've made growing up like my parent\nand I've done hopefully I've tried to do\nquite a bit for them over the past\ncouple years U and I think my little\nsister's similar we just are we're so\ndifferent we're just so different that\nthe um yeah I think if I think if like\nmy life utterly fell apart and I was\nhomeless and I like called Mom and Dad\nlike Mom Dad I need to live with you I'm\nlike my life they would like my mom\nwould be super happy she'd like yeah St\nme come back yeah my parents super love\nme I know um and then even my little\nsister I'm sure would do yeah what she H\nhow are you so different from them\num like how did I become different or\nhow am I different like in\ncharacteristic trait quality uh I was\nthinking more of the latter but either\none\num I don't know I feel like\num do you know like color temperatures\non\nlights sort of I don't know like I'm\nlike a 6,000 degree I'm like a very cold\nsterile like when you talk to me like\nI'm very like dry witty sarcastic uh\nlike uh intelligent like biting like\nthat's kind of like my character like\nmaybe like a porcupine or a hedgehog\nlike that's how I feel and I would say\nthat my family is very much like the\nlike the conservative religious loving\nlike mom is always like baking cookies\nand you know like they try to go to\nchurch and uh you know like those yeah\njust very very very different in almost\nevery regard like if you saw me with my\nfamily I think most people that have\nseen me with my family think I'm like\nadopted yeah insanely different types of\nso so it sounds like you're just you\nknow and and and it's it's nice to hear\nthat your your parents sounds like\nthere's a lot of actually love both\nsides yeah I think they're loving people\nfor sure yeah like the the one of the\nbiggest distillations in difference of\nbehavior would be like when I go to\nclean up like I'll take a trash bag and\nI'll go through my apartment if I\nhaven't used it in two months I just\nthrow it away I think my mom has every\nsingle thing any of her children have\never written on since birth like that's\nyeah just in terms of differences yeah\nwe're just very very very different\npeople different people but sounds like\nthere's a lot of love that you can count\non them that there's a lot of good stuff\nthere yeah for sure so kind of going\nback to like these social interactions\nand stuff are you you you don't want to\nbe dependent on so you're okay being\ndependent on in ride or die\nrelationships but how does it feel\notherwise\num if it's something that I excel at\nthat I can do quickly it's okay but if\nit requires like a significant thing\notherwise I just yeah it just feels very\nburdensome I\nguess what's so burdensome about\nit\num about it\nI don't know it just feels like a lot of\njust feels like a lot of time emotional\nenergy um\nfor not much in return I don't really\nhave I don't really have very many\nfriends though\nso yeah I think that's what makes it\nhard to evaluate too as I'm as I'm\ntalking about these things a lot of\nthese are like people that I would say\nlike I'm friendly with but I don't have\nvery many like friend friends but I feel\nlike if it was a friend friend making a\nburdensome request uh I don't think I\nwould have a problem with that like I I\nlive close to a guy there's a guy called\nlike\nand I think if I had like a random\nperson and they were like I really need\na ride tomorrow to the hospital and I\nlive like 40 minutes away like could you\njust like pick me up like please I would\nprobably say bro I'll just shoot you\nmoney for an Uber like like why why\nwould I waste my time with this but I\nthink if Dan asked be like yeah sure of\ncourse I can do that so I maybe maybe\nit's more um maybe also sorry if I'm\ngoing too far off maybe the analysis I'm\ngiving you of how I relate to people\nisn't necessarily like I treat everybody\nlike this but more so that like I have\nthere are very very very few people I\nconsider close enough to to like make\nthese types of I a sacrifices for or\nmake these types of arrangements with\nbut I think for people that are close to\nme I think I would yeah I think I\nwouldn't have a problem doing that yeah\nare so I know there's a meme about you\nbeing a sociopath like do you think\nyou're a sociopath I have I don't know\nI'm trying to think about it I mean so\nI'm not you know I'm not diagnosing you\nthat but I don't think you're a\nsociopath like I don't get sociopathy\nfrom you that's good I I get uh uh I'm a\ndiagnosed nons sociopath I'm just\nkidding I know yeah I don't know that\nthat that was funny um but but I I mean\nwhat I really get the sense of is that\nlike you feel first of all I don't know\nwhy but you feel so responsible for like\nrandos like you don't want to\ninconvenience people you don't want to\nbur burden people you don't want to like\nbe the result of someone's\nunhappiness and and maybe that's\nsomething deeper than I mean I think\nit's like having a physically abusive\nrelationship where someone where they\nmade you responsible for their happiness\nand it's not so much about the abuse as\nit is like I think sometimes people this\nis like one of the I've learned as a\nclinician is\nlike you know when I when I work with\npeople often times it's all the stuff\nleading up to the abuse where the real\ndamage is done right so when when things\nget abusive it's like things are\nuntenable but it's like all the ways\nthat you get shaped up to that point\ndoes that make sense it's like all the\nlittle compromises that you make all the\nlittle\nlike like cuz it's not [ __ ] at that\npoint it's like trying to make things\nwork and you give of yourself and you\ngive of yourself and you give of\nyourself and you start to like shape\nyourself into what they want you to be\nbut since they're so demanding It's\nnever enough and then things escalate\nand then you're like this is crazy I'm\ndone with this but that that shaping\nhappens like even before that yeah 100%\nI definitely yeah I can definitely\nsympathize or empathize with that point\nlike if I was outside a bar and I got\ninto a fight with some dude and you know\nhe you ends up kicking my ass or\nsomething like at the end I'd be like\nirritated but it's not going to have the\nsame emotional gravity as like a fight\nwith a sign other where at the end it's\nlike Jesus Christ like how what brought\nus to this point that like I'm calling\nthe cops like this is like insane yeah\nuh and that's probably a lot more\nemotionally loaded with a whole bunch of\nother things leading up to that point\nwhat I'm even saying is before the fight\nwith the cops with your your significant\nother what I'm talking about is three\nmonths before that fight there was\nsomething about you ordered pizza and\nthey got pissed at you sure something\ninsignificant that is actually quite\nemotionally shaping does that what was\nthe path before things got abusive yeah\nyeah yeah yeah I understand what you're\nsaying yeah and and what I'm kind of\ncurious about is like so what what\nwhat's wrong with and don't say nothing\ndon't say this is stupid what's wrong\nwith telling people hey I'm flying in\ntoday and they're like hey do you want\nto go kayaking you're like I'm going to\nbe flying in I'm pretty tired so I think\nI'll\npass yeah there's nothing wrong with it\nthat should be what I do\nyeah remember you can't say nothing's\nwrong with it what's wrong with it they\nshould oh I can't even oh wait a have to\nlike what's wrong with it is it like\nwhat it feels wrong to me or yeah like\nwhy like you don't do that right so we\nhave to reverse engineer we can't say\nwhat should be we have to accept what is\nwhat is there nothing's wrong there's\nsomething wrong with it otherwise you\nwould do\nit oh yeah I feel like I'm I guess I\nfeel like I'm letting the other person\ndown what's wrong with letting the other\nperson\ndown um the person views me I guess as\nsome sort of uh person that they want to\nspend time with or hang out with or have\nfun with and I'm completely failing to I\nguess live up to that expectation what's\nwrong with\nthat feels like I fostered uh some kind\nof expectation of the other person that\nthey can have that expectation of me and\nI'm failing to live up with that to that\nmaybe let me ask in a different way okay\nwho's someone that you had an\nexpectation with that let you\ndown um\nwho's someone that you wanted to hang\nout with\nmore I don't know I never ask I just\nnever make requests for people it's a\nit's a bad it's a bad character trait of\nmine did I ask you to come on my I asked\nyou to come on my podcast right no did\nyou did I bring that up in our last\nconversation I might have brought it up\nlike if you're in Miami you should come\nby yeah I think you mention something\nlike that oh okay yeah if I did that\ntook a lot of building up to do because\nnormally I just don't make requests\nof people ever yeah but if I did that\nwas something I had to think about a lot\nbefore okay I'm going to ask him this\nthing because I always feel like I'm\nimposing on other people which is I'm\nwhich is stupid I know I'm not I just\ndid the thing sorry yeah so good\nawareness right you don't have to fix it\njust aware aware right so notice that\nself-judgment it's not it's not\ndispassionate Stephen do you see that\nit's not dispassionate it's like the\nJudgment it's not a logical analysis\nit's it's a\njudgment um\nis it I don't know if it is it\nis I mean like rational is not true I\nknow I'm not imposing I know you can say\nno like it's stupid to feel\nlike if it's not rational then what is\nit emotional\nyes and judgments are emotional not\nrational or this this version there's\nother versions that you can you can\narrive at a logical judgment but that's\nnot what's going on here like that's the\npoint right it's like it's so simple\nthat it's like so sort of weird that\nlike obviously you know that rationally\nit's not okay but the crazy thing is\nthat this is rational at its core it's\nrational because emotions are it to\nconceive of yourself as a your words no\nhuman being is a computer mhm so a\nrational analysis of yourself must\ninclude emotion yeah of course yeah I\nagree with that right your words and so\nthis this reaction that you have is very\nreflexive this is a Vasa it's a mental\nhabit it is something that in CBT would\nbe called an automatic thought okay\num so let's kind of go back to this\nbecause I mean I think this is like to\nme there's a couple of really important\nthings here so so and I don't think\nyou're sociopathic once again I'm not\nI'm not clinically evaluating for\nantisocial personality disorder but what\nI see is a lot of your coldness is\nactually like kind of compassion like\nthere's another weird angle to this\nwhich is that why are you so sensitive\nto not making other people unhappy\nbecause you know what it's like to being\non the receiving end of that behavior\nsure but I feel like the I I I I don't I\ndon't think I agree with the\ncharacterization though because I feel\nlike I feel like if it was compassionate\nI would just make the other decision and\nmake myself less comfortable I feel like\nat the end it just about being selfishly\nmotivated like oh I feel bad gone so far\ndown the end you've circumnavigated\nsociopathy and ended up in compassion I\nI don't know if I agree that but I know\nyou don't so let me let me toss\nsomething out okay I'm not saying I'm\nright by the way this\nis so\nlike did you want your dad to come to\nyour music\nperformances I I feel like the deeper\nquestion isn't like did I want them to\ncome maybe it would be like did I did I\ndid I want them to want them to come\ndoes that make sense yes because I think\ngenuinely at the end I don't really\nthink I did I didn't really care much\nabout it and then I would get annoyed if\nthey'd show up because I feel like\nthey're just there um actually no I have\nbeen down this stre before I think the\nthought was that like I want somebody to\ncome or I want somebody to do something\nbut only if there's like a genuine\ninterest in the thing um recycling when\nwe talk about compliments and I don't\ngenely like compliments um I don't like\ncompliments because I feel like a lot of\nthem are given um in in lie of something\nelse or to express something else so for\ninstance let's say that I have a partner\nand we wake up and like oh you look\nreally handsome it's like yeah okay this\nlike how I always look like that'd be\nwhatever but like let's say that we\ndressed up to go out somewhere nice and\nlike oh wow you look really handsome in\nthat outfit that would feel better cuz\nit's like oh I feel like it's a gen\nthing that you're actually saying and\nit's not just like an out of hand\nexpression of some random emotional\nstate you have of me that like means\nnothing to me so like if if a parent\nshowed up um to a concert and they were\nlike wow you played so well I'd be like\nokay thanks mom your dad yeah obviously\nbut if they came up and they said\nsomething along the lines of like um wow\nlike I've heard you struggle with this\npiece for like two weeks and you nailed\nthis solo on this piece here good job\nthat would feel a lot more fulfilling\nit's like oh you are genuinely noticing\nwhat I'm doing you're genuinely having\nan interest and the compl is reflecting\nthat genuine interest in that thing yeah\nthat might maybe that's everybody with\ncompl no that's not everybody though\nbecause random [ __ ] all the time but I\nthink that's how I would yeah yeah so\nsee there there you did the the second\nguessing or the the self analysis but\nwithout judgment right so there was no\nI'm dumb for thinking that yeah so next\nthing to consider so it sounds like the\nthe compliments have to be filtered\nthrough your own\nperception for me to like them yeah but\nthat's probably normal right\nI mean I don't I\ndon't they have to you yeah cuz if like\nif I were to walk up to a bunch of\nrandom girls like wow your boobs are so\nnice like most like I don't appreciate\nthat like well that's cuz you're\nfiltering through your perception it\nwould just be\nnot my point is that like so no no I I I\nI don't think that's normal so it's\ncommon sure but I want you like so the\nwhole point of a compliment is like this\nis what I think about you it doesn't\nhave to be temp temped or filtered\nthrough what you think about\nyourself now I think it's very\ncommon can I wait can I can I hit on\nthat for a second okay because I haven't\nconsidered this before maybe um or this\nthought popped in my head so I haven't\nlike um maybe I feel like when um when\nsomebody compliments me and it's not a\ngenuine compliment it almost feels like\nsomebody's making a deposit that they're\ntrying to withdraw on later I guess so\nif somebody gives me that compliment\nabout like the music thing um or like\nthey like a genuine noticing of\nsomething and they've said like oh blah\nblah like that feels like oh wow you\nnotice something that's really if\nsomebody's just like giving me like a\nrandom whatever feels like a social\nnicity or some transaction or some\ndeposit that I'm going to have like okay\nwell you said this so I guess like like\nsomebody got me a gift for Christmas and\nI have to get you a gift back maybe I\nthink like maybe that's the feeling it\nfeels like a little bit more\ntransactional or less genuine feels like\na debt yeah it's a burden yeah so that I\nthink is definitely tracks right cuz\nlike burdens you don't want you don't\nwant to be depend you don't want other\npeople depending on you you don't want\nto owe people things you want to be\nindependent yes you don't want to be\nconnected yeah so I think that is there\nI think there's another way to think\nabout it the and these things aren't\nmutually exclusive by the way which is\nlike I know it's kind of weird but like\nlet's say I have I'll use an extreme\nexample body\ndysmorphia and you look at me and you\nsee someone who is\na 10 out of 10 now you say that to me\nand since I have body\ndysmorphia I dismiss what you\nsay right so this is like filtering a\ncompliment through my own perception now\nis this common I I don't know what you\nmean by the word normal is it common\nquite but I don't think that I I think\nthat generally speaking and now we get\nto this thing again that is also common\nin people who have an insecurity so when\nyou feel insecure about something you\nhave difficulty accepting compliments\nabout it because you're filtering it\nthrough your own\ninsecurity okay can I ask a question on\nthis when I'm complimenting people or\nwhen I'm like I think about this a lot\nof debate for persuasion for instance U\nbut even in like uh in in warm\nrelationships when I'm complimenting\nsomebody I'm almost always thinking of\nit from I try to think of it from their\nframe of reference or from their\nperspective so if somebody is um let's\nsay somebody worked on an art project\nand where I'm at in my life right now\nthe things that I value the most are can\nI get a 24 to 4 48 hour turnaround in an\nemail and how reliable are you these are\nlike the two most important things for\nan employe to be so let's say somebody\nfinishes an art project and they got it\ndone like really quickly um if I looked\nat that art project and I know that\nthat's to them not what they're thinking\nabout that's not what they value the\nmost they value like the uh the artistic\nmerits of what they've done if I was\ngoing to give a compliment to that\nperson I wouldn't compliment them on the\nthing that I appreciate I would\ncompliment them on the thing that I\nthink they appreciate so I wouldn't say\nlike wow I can't believe you got back to\nme in a day thanks I would say something\nlike wow this looks like really good uh\ncongratulations or like this is like a\nreally cool art P because I think that\nthey would value that comment more do\nyou think that's like an ordinary way of\nlike how people compliment each other or\na thing to consider or is that bad or\ngood or what are your thoughts on that I\nguess yeah beautiful okay so I think it\nis it is an ordinary way to compliment\npeople and there's a beautiful way for\nus to get past a slice of whatever the\n[ __ ] is going on which is I think you\nshould stop doing\nthat so I'll tell you a story okay so I\nwas once working with a Pro Gamer and\nthis Pro Gamer was up and coming and um\nthey would sometimes travel to a\ndifferent region of the world to boot\ncamp where there were lots of\ntournaments and we were talking\nabout when this person would play with\nthe top tier pros this person is\narguably like a tier two pro at the time\nthey would talk to the the top tier they\nwould pub with the top tier pros and\nthen if they ever made a mistake in the\npub they would feel so bad about\nthemselves because these are the best\nplayers in the world that are seeing\nthis mistake and they must think I'm\nlike [ __ ] right like CU I'm making these\n[ __ ] mistakes they thought I'm [ __ ] I'm\n[ __ ] I'm [ __ ] they're seeing me for\n[ __ ] not surprisingly this person was\nalso quite toxic in pubs in their home\nregion when they're streaming MH and so\none really interesting thing is that the\nway that and you're kind of you've\nalready sort of figured this out but we\nwe let's just state it which is like see\nthe way that you interpret other\npeople's compliments has to do with the\nway that you give compliments this is\n101 like human behavior 101 if I give\nyou so some people value let's talk\nabout gift giving so some people like\nthe the monetary value of the gift is\nwhat's important for other people it's\nthe thought that counts right so I will\ngive gifts based on my internal Compass\nof gift giving so in it's both ways when\nI receive a gift I interpret it this way\nand when I give a gift I'm using the\nsame rubric does that make sense yeah so\none thing that I would encourage you to\ndo is start complimenting people for\nwhat you\nvalue not what they value you can do\nboth but at least do\none because what what you're doing is\nlike if you complement people quote\nunquote deceptively and I don't think\ndeceptive is really the fair term but\nI'm using it as kind of a\nhyperbole then when you when other\npeople compliment you it is more likely\nto be interpreted as deceptive because\nthat's the rubric in your mind you give\ncompliments to people based on what they\nwill like when I yeah and you can keep\ngoing um I'm I'm writing some of this\ndown now um but I I have a really big\nquestion you can keep going if you want\nto take a pit stop here about that\ndeceptive thing that's something that I\nhave a really hard time dealing with but\nwe can put a pin on that and come back\nput a on so so so I think it's the same\nthing well I'm leaving so so what I've\ncome to realize is like\nauthenticity goes a long way that's the\nmost important thing and sometimes\nyou'll be amazed at how much it can\nchange people because\nsee right now we're talking about their\nself-perception you're feeding into that\nself-perception we're all playing the\ngame on their perception we're filtering\nthings through their insecurity we're\nall thinking about what's in their head\nthe beautiful thing about an authentic\ncompliment is that you are pulling them\noutside of their head and into your head\nwhen someone values their artistic Merit\nthey may have never thought of\nthemselves is professional reliable or\ntimely they're not in a stem field right\nthose are the things that stem people\nvalue or people in\nfinance what you value about another\nhuman being if you authentically share\nwith them it's maybe not what they're\nlooking for but you will be amazed at\nhow it can be worth twice as\nmuch when someone thinks they're ugly\nand thinks they're smart they get a lot\nmore out of being told they're beautiful\nthan they do from getting told that\nthey're\nsmart they may be confused by the beauty\nand that's why the authenticity matters\nand in the same way that you sort of\ntalk about if someone says something\nwith a lot of like flavor to it right\nhey I really appreciate and and you you\ndid this when you to like kind of talk\nabout this conversation with sneo or\nwhatever like you authentically share\nwhat I appreciate about it I you\nknow the value comes not from what I\nthink I mean maybe you were doing it\nwith me but you know I don't get the\nperception that you were telling me that\nbecause like I value that I think that\nwas genuine appreciation for something\nthat's what I received that's what I\nheard a little bit yeah it was that's\nlike a golden Zone complement where it\nwas something that I valued but I hope\nit's something that you value so it goes\nback to that when I was saying like when\nthe interests align like everything yeah\nso golden zone is great right so when\nyou can scratch both ites fair enough\nbut I I would encourage you to start\ngiving people compliments that are more\nabout where you come from so I I learned\nthis lesson one day when I saw one of my\nmentors compliment an old lady about\ntheir\nappearance and this is a psychiatrist\nand it was just eye opening to me cuz\nlike like I see these old ladies that\nare out right and old ladies are usually\ndressed up if you don't pay attention\nyou won't notice this I never paid\nattention to this before I worked at a\ncasino and yeah the yeah the old ladies\nthat would come in they'd always have\nlike these cute dresses on and they're\nso careful about their appearance mhm\nthey put so much time and energy and\nwhat we see is their\nage right we see see someone who and so\nwe don't compliment like we as men often\ntimes will just compliment People based\non our genitals sure or what we think is\nhot or whatever there's all that mating\nmating and compliments get tied up so\nmuch for us it's a mess MH it's such a\nmess and to take a moment and and\nappreciate that wow this person got\ntogether to woke up today looked in the\nmirror they're like 70 years old they\npicked this particular hair clip with\nthis particular earrings and this\nparticular lipstick this is an on emble\nof\nintention and to recognize and\nappreciate that and to even look at that\nright and this this Falls a little bit\nmore potentially into what you're saying\nwhich is telling people what they want\nto hear but the this person genuinely\nappreciated the effort that went into\nthis and it was like really opened my\neyes and I think whatever you receive\nfrom other people is your brain kind of\nworks the same way and so if you change\nwhat you give your brain will\nautomatically change what you receive\nH so you think so the hypothesis here\nbeing that if I were to genuinely\ncompliment people on the things that I\nappreciate you think that I would\nreceive their comp if I if I compliment\npeople from my appreciation from my\nframe of reference I would start\nreceiving their compliments better even\nfrom their frame of reference is that\nessentially what you're saying\nabsolutely right now it's no longer\nfiltered through your\ninsecurity huh okay right and and then\nhopefully over time you'll be able to\ndiscern when people are bullshitting you\nbecause you can still tell the\nauthenticity right so you're familiar\nwith the golden Zone you know what it\nlooks like and so when people are bsing\nyou I think it'll help a lot because\nthen the Beautiful the other cool thing\nthat will happen is when you start\ncomplimenting out of\nauthenticity are you expecting anything\nin\nreturn uh no I'm not right so once you\nstart giving without expectation you can\nreceive without expectation it's both\nways right so right now when you\ncompliment someone and I think this is\nwhy people will elude that you're so I\ndon't think you're sociopathic but third\ntime uh but you know I I think it's like\ncuz you're kind of playing this game and\nyou had to learn how to play that game I\nthink early on right so like the other\nhumans you didn't know how they worked\nbecause you were a 6,000 Hue whatever in\nin a porcupine and they're like otter\nthat are snuggling with each other right\nso you you had to like learn this way of\ninteracting with the humans because you\nwere a different kind of\nkid and so I think that a lot of of you\nknow it's crazy but like these old\nspiritual Traditions always like talk\nabout the benefits of things like\ncompassion and stuff like that and then\nthey also say something weird we think\ncompassion is about making the world a\nbetter place it's not just about making\nthe world a better place it's about\nmaking you a better person to practice\ncompassion and forgiveness changes the\nway that you receive what the world\ngives\nyou and everyone is so caught up\ncircling back to what we originally\ntalked out about everything that's wrong\non the internet that we stop looking at\nourselves we stop looking at like let me\njust be genuine with another human being\nlet me offer what I have without\nexpectation and then you can receive\nwhat other people have without\nexpectation it becomes joyous because\nright now think about what you're doing\nto your life Stephen when someone does\nsomething nice for you instead of\nenjoying it you feel burdened and\nindebted like what the [ __ ] like\nkindness from another human being\nincreases your burden no wonder you\ndon't have many friends\nand now there are certain beautiful\nthings that you've been able to\naccomplish there's certain relationships\nthat you can create that bypass this\nmechanism ride or die my parents love me\nno matter what my mom would be thrilled\nin fresh baked cookies right so you're\nnot busted you're not screwed up you're\nnot ill or anything like that this is\nnormal mhm all human beings are like\nthis everyone their mind gets shaped\nwithout their knowledge or\nconsent yours has been too mine husband\nto so I'd say try to change a little bit\nabout what you put out into the world\nand it'll change the way that you\nreceive what the world will give you and\nthe Beautiful Thing is you'll be able to\nwhen someone compliments you for\nsomething even if you don't believe it\nabout yourself you'll be able to receive\nit and it can improve your\nday last thing okay is that there's a\nlot of stuff about this whole like\ninsecurity\nlike being responsible for other\npeople's happiness I don't think that\nthat is directly related to this I think\nthat's a different thing but I do think\nthere's something about you know like\nand I think it's hard to admit\nespecially so this is harder to admit if\nyou have a good relationship with your\nparents easier to admit if they're\nabusive so when you love your parents\nit's much harder to say it really hurt\nme that you didn't show up all the\ntime right yeah that that's it's so\nweird like this is another thing that I\nlearned clinically just I had one\npatient who just was just I've learned\nso\nmuch and when we love our parents it's\nhard to find fault with them and if we\ncan't find fault with our parents we\ncan't admit how we've been hurt and if\nwe can't admit how we've been hurt and\nwe suppress it and we don't acknowledge\nit then it leads exactly to the picture\nthat we see with you which is [ __ ]\nconfusing and makes no sense I'm not\ninsecure but I feel insecure I have all\nthe features of insecurity but I'm not\ninsecure mhm and then the last thing is\nthat this can be States so it's not that\nare or aren't it is that there is a\ndormant part of your mind that arises in\nsome cases in certain circumstances\nthese things come up and you're so\nbeautiful at at at talking about them\nright so it's like when your grandmother\nis like where are you when these people\nare like you're flying back and they\nwant to go kaying these moments where\nthis complex\narises and the rest of the time you're\nfine we know you're secure cuz you can\ntake on some of the biggest wigs in the\nindustry and hold your own you have\nconfidence you have faith in what you're\ndoing in the world you have a foundation\nof what it means to be good how you want\nto see the world change and we can see\nall the confidence it comes people\ndetect it that's why they can't push you\naround right doesn't matter who how rich\nthey are or how much money they are how\nmany more followers than they have and\nyou are centered the only problem is\nthat when this thing arises you become\nuncentered Can You Feel the difference\nyeah of course yeah right so it's not\neither or it's both is dormant it's an\nissue of State not trait it's not stats\nit's like tank stance or DPS stance or\nhealing\nstance you had that\nquestion\num no I don't think it's as relevant\nanymore I was going to ask before um in\nterms of like complimenting people or\nsaying things to the people that I know\npeople want to hear what what like how\nmuch of this is deceptive versus if I'm\ntrying to communicate a genuine interest\nto somebody I might say a particular\nthing that I care about but I don't\nthink they care about it so then instead\nI might say something that I know that\nthey care about something that count as\ndeceptive but you're just saying to just\nlike compliment on things that I would\ncare about regardless and not try to get\ninto other people's frame of reference\nso much I guess so so there there's a\nthere's a c there's a Nuance there so\nI'm not saying that you should do\nentirely one what I'm saying is that you\nshould start piloting the other and see\nwhat happens yeah I understand okay and\nthen the right answer is then focus on\nyour perception because right now when\nwe're talking about compliment we're all\ntalking about you should you do it this\nway should you do it this way but at\nsome point what you want to then do is\nsee how they receive the compliment yeah\nthat makes sense okay yeah and then once\nyou operate from perception then you you\nby all means can fit yourself to who\nthey are and I don't think that that's\ndeceptive it's just as long as you're\nnot Li as long as you're not deceptive\nit's not deceptive yeah okay so here's a\nquestion what is like the limiting\nprinciple on this how far um let's say\nuh so I'm gonna I'll hyperbolize really\nhard in the other direction somebody\nsees me every single time they see me\nthey're like I really like uh I really\nlike those raw Floren sweatpants they're\nthe coolest thing ever and they just\nreally like complimenting these things\nbut I really just don't care about this\nor I really just don't enjoy this or I\ndon't like this particular compliment at\ndo you um I guess from a personal\ndevelopment level would you try to\nalways receive every single compliment\num as well as you can and always be\nappreciative of them or do you start\nputting up some line somewhere like\nassuming it's not like an insulting or a\nhorrible thing but like how do you\nmoderate that I guess does that make\nsense what I'm asking yeah I I think I\nunderstand what you're asking and I\nthink\nit's a\nrelatively unimportant problem to solve\nso let let me share with you what I mean\nby that okay so so like I'm I'm with you\nthat now you're asking about the extreme\nso that's where like I I think my focus\nis not on the top of the mountain it's\nlike on this next step or even like I\nI'm using an extreme to test the\nprinciple I guess I'm just thinking in\nterms of like logical whatever [ __ ]\num but like so for instance I guess to\nground it out more realistically so in\nmy life um I this is an issue I having a\nlot of relationships I for every partner\nI've dated my partners are beautiful I\nlike them all the time regardless of how\nthey look um I don't care at all about\nlike compliments about my phys it means\nabsolutely nothing to me but that seems\nto be a big sticking point for a lot of\npeople people like to be told that\nthey're beautiful people like to say\nthat their partner is pretty or handsome\nor whatever um would this be a thing\nwhere like I should like Hey listen just\ndon't say this about me or do you just\nlike would would you say that like oh\nwell you should learn to just take those\ncompliments be happy that that would be\nlike a more grounded example I guess\nbeautiful question right so what I would\nsay is is a couple things one is that\nyou could ask this person you\nknow can you help me understand why you\nkeep on commenting on my appearance\nright I feel secure in the way that I\nlook like I don't need to hear that kind\nof thing like I'm you know I'm with you\nI think you're beautiful um the way that\nyou act towards me makes me feel like\nphysically attractive yeah you know so I\nI don't need to hear that does it can\nyou help me understand what makes you\nsay it so I I would start by\nunderstanding because anytime we're\ntalking about so there's a couple layers\nhere the first is what we're doing in\nyour mind so this is this intervention\nis not about your relationships it's\nabout you it's about changing the way\nthat you interact with other people and\nchanging the way that you receive others\ninteractions MH once we add another\nperson to the equation then we enter the\nrealm of perception then we enter the\nrealm of compromise so I think it's\ntotally find to start to investigate\nsome but then practically and we'll get\nto your extreme example by the way sure\nwhich is not actually I mean it's\nextreme but I don't think it's useful\nbut it there is a real answer there\nthat's important on some level yeah I\ndon't really care that much about the\nI'm just curious like how you limit like\nyeah yeah so so I I don't and then the\nnext thing is that you just acknowledge\nthat okay like in this person's life it\nis important for them and this is the\nkey thing right so where we're going to\nwork on you and once you yourself are\nsettled you can receive what the rest of\nthe world sends your way mhm so it is\nimportant for my partner to compliment\nme physically this is the way that they\nexpress their approval for me this is\nthe way that they strive to make me feel\nbetter about myself and you can just\naccept that as it is and so you were\nasking a question the extreme example\nright so I recognize where you don't\nreally need that but if someone was\ncomplimenting me every day bro that's\nhas nothing to do with me that has\neverything to do with them does that\nmake sense on a simple level like if\nevery time I saw you Destiny I was like\noh my God Destiny is so great bro oh my\nGod you're beard and this and that and\nyou're so like that has nothing to\n[ __ ] do with you right that is a\nprojection from the other person okay so\nthe whole point is that and this is\nwhere things end up right so if you want\nto know what the final optimal Omega\nform of this is this is where we get\nclose to mocha or Enlightenment it is to\nbe completely centered within yourself\nand not have\nthis be affected by what is out\nthere I can say yes to kaying I can say\nno to kaying I can say whatever I don't\nneed to play some game and if they're\nunhappy it's to separate ourselves from\nthe outside world right so their\nunhappiness is over there I'm centered\nover here I'm going to act in a way that\nI think is is\npositive the beautiful thing that when\nyou do that you become very perceptive\nbecause now you're not clouding things\nyou're not shaping their compliments\nwhen you give a compliment you can't\nauthentically say something because once\nagain klish your mind attaches all of\nthese things and when someone says\nDestiny you're so great what the [ __ ] a\ncompliment becomes a burden why because\nof glisha your mind attaches all of\nthese things to that compliment but\nthat's not in the compliment there may\nbe a reality to transactional\nrelationships I'm not saying that what\nI'm saying is that your mind should be\nable to tell the difference and you will\nbe able to so as you become centered in\nyourself you disentangle the self from\nthe outside world then you can perceive\nthe outside world for what it is and you\nwill know instantly whether someone is\nbullshitting you or not you will be able\nto see people you will become the best\nlie detector M because now your own mind\nthink about what what lets people get\naway with lies it's not that they're\nskilled Liars the best liar is someone\nwho Lin up their lies with the\nvulnerability of the other person yeah\nso as you become centered then it will\nbecome very clear you can operate\nwith freedom without burden you can act\nspontaneously you can perceive what's\ngoing on and perceive it as it is MHM\nand so then in what to do should I\ncompliment or not compliment your mind\nwill say okay this person you know I can\nsay this authentically and it makes them\nfeel a certain way so I I can offer this\nperson this compliment on a regular\nbasis it doesn't do me any harm I'm not\ntrying to cultivate some niess and I'm\nnot trying to cultivate I'm not trying\nto take advantage of them or groom or\nanything I can what what does it hurt me\nto offer if an old lady needs help\ncrossing the street every time she\ncrosses the street what does it hurt me\nto help them cross the street if someone\nelse needs to hear that they're\nbeautiful on a daily basis what does it\nhurt me to tell them that they're\nbeautiful and then as you perceive\nyou'll also be able to see this is\nharmful now this person is becoming\ndependent now if I don't compliment them\nI will ruin their day right you'll be\nable to see all of those things it'll\nbecome very clear and then you'll know\nwhat to do it'll become\neasy\nokay um okay let me summarize some\nadvice and then spit it back at you and\nthen you can tell me if I'm roughly\nunderstanding this that\num uh I'm spending too much time in my\nhead uh trying to\nintellectualize uh like these social\ninteractions and thinking about it from\nother people's perspectives and I I\nguess I'm missing the forest for the\ntrees for to some extent and that as I'm\ntalking to people um instead of trying\nto think so hard about like well what do\nthey want to hear or what would be a way\nto optimize this interaction or whatever\num I should just think of things that I\nappreciate compliment people\nauthentically for those things um as I\ndo that uh I'm probably going to Foster\nfriendships that are more aligned with\nwhat I would want anyway because they're\nappreciating those compliments those\npeople will be pulled a little bit more\ninto my head space um they'll appreciate\nthose compliments and it'll help me see\nthe way that other people compliment me\num I won't be fil in it as hardcore as I\ndo through my mind um like I'm expecting\neverybody else to um yeah and that\nthrough I guess fostering those types of\nengagements with people those\ninteractions uh not only will it make my\ninteractions with them better it'll help\nme more clearly understand their\ninteractions with me I guess kind of is\nthat yeah am I close I think you're\nclose Okay but I I think once again I'm\nseeing a lot of trees but not the forest\nfrom your answer yeah I'm a very\ndiscreet trees person sorry no that's\nokay so\nthat's okay right so I I think that this\nI there is no doubt in my mind that this\nwill help you in some way okay I think\none thing that I would strongly\nencourage you to do so this is at the\npeak is pay attention Stephen to the\nboundary between you and another human\nbeing mhm and I think that you do you\nknow how to do this I think this is why\nlike I said I I I'm serious when I say I\nthink you can hold your own with a lot\nof heavy weights and that can't happen\nunless you're centered in here sure can\nyou um can you expand on that a little\nbit when you say be aware of the\nboundary between you and other community\nwhat do you mean when you say boundary\nthere so you're okay pissing people off\non the internet right yeah because\nyou're over here and they're out\nthere do SES I mean I can do it in a\nlive debate too but we there's a\nseparation like in terms of relationship\ngroup your feelings are not dependent\nupon another PE person's feelings this\nis fundamental yeah you can say things\nthat upset someone because you are\ncentered and if they to get upset they\ncan get upset now let's take the case of\nyour\ngrandmother why are you worrying I get\nirritated your feelings are tied to her\nfeelings you want her feelings to change\nso that your feelings will\nchange your partner is unhappy this\nmakes you unhappy your her happiness is\ndependent on your behavior there's a\ntangling up of you and\nanother this must change in one you know\nhow to do this there must be separation\nbetween you than the other person the\nother person has their own feelings if\nthey want to worry let them worry what\nis it to you if you care about them by\nall means intervene in some way but your\nfeelings should not be tangled up in\nthese it shouldn't be a okay wait I'm\nsorry let me summarize okay hold on okay\nmaybe this clicks a little bit more yes\nright weting so um okay so before I'm\nthinking um what are the things that I\ncan say to evoke in them things that\nmake me feel better but rather you're\nsaying that I should take a more honest\napproach and how I communicate with\nother people and let them feel what they\nfeel without making my feelings ring on\ntheir feelings I'd even say forget the\nfirst half I mean I'm not saying it's\nwrong but this is the key thing what I\nthe first half was the wrong part yeah\nit's like this is what I was saying\nbefore but you're saying I should just\ndo this particular thing yeah so what I\nwant you to really pay attention to and\nthis is all you need you don't need to\ndo anything remember awareness is enough\nnotice the communication between your\nfeelings and someone else's feelings\nbecause all of the things that you\nstruggle with are Tangled Up Oh They'll\nfeel offended if I don't go kaying\nnow you are your feelings I feel offend\nI feel I don't want to do this but I\ndon't want to disappoint them so your\ninternal environment is tied to their\nresponse this will never never work\nMH and the beautiful thing is you have\nthis figured out because you've already\ndone this 90% of Destiny is good at this\nSteven sometimes\nstruggles so just notice the\nindependence of you from the outside\nworld and then the beautiful thing is\nyou can circum navigate this globe and\nwhen you when you become more and more\nindependent in turn what will finally\nhappen in the final stage is you will\nactually be joined with the other people\nokay yeah so then that so then my other\nquestion relating to this is like it's\nlike a limiting principles question but\nmaybe you just kind of got there in a\nroundabout way is I'm sure there's a way\nthat you could practice this in a way\nthat would be toxic\num yes is that just intuitive like if my\npartner was like yeah like my mom died I\nreally need a conversation I'm like I\ndon't really feel like talking to you\nabout that you deal with your own\nemotions that would probably not be a\ngood thing so this is a li so the path\nof spirituality is a license for\nassholery yeah so this happens all the\ntime and it comes from a logical\napplication to it as opposed to a what I\nwould call spiritual or authentic\napplication to it MH so if I say like\nI'll just give you an example let's say\nlike living in the present or let's use\nthis example so right to be not have\nyour feelings tangled up with another\nperson's feeling\nnow this what some people will interpret\nthat is if you're feeling hurt [ __ ] you\nyou're hurt I'm good this is totally\nfine leads to asshol I'm not saying\ndon't care about another person's\nfeelings so it's it's in what we leave\nout what is absolutely not good is to\nhave a seesaw between your emotions and\nsomeone else's emotions okay I don't\nknow if you've ever heard of this before\nbut this sounds very similar to some guy\nit's a three minute YouTube video or\nwhatever but it has to differ between\nlike compassion and empathy that it's\nreally good to feel compassion for\npeople because it means that you're\naware of their feelings and you take\nthem into account with your actions but\nempathy where you just feel what they\nfeel or have a reaction to their\nfeelings emotionally is a very bad thing\nand it doesn't really help as much yeah\nyeah so it can be bad so if you look at\nmedical doctors and psychiatrists we are\ngenerally speaking more sociopathic than\nthe average population and psychiatrists\nI think are more sociopathic than the\naverage doctor this is not because we're\nall evil this is because if we get if we\nhave the torrent of empathy that runs\nthrough our brains we will get torn\napart people wonder how can you deal\nwith suicidal people every day and not\nbe depressed the only way you can do it\nis by being centered it doesn't mean\nthat you can't be compassionate in fact\nit offers you you then become a stable\nground for people who are drowning mhm\nso you're right that if misapplied if\nincompletely applied this results in\nproblems absolutely the beautiful thing\nis that if you understand the essence of\nit and you live out the principle it\nwill become\nclear okay\nokay\ncool thank you so much for this\nconversation I feel like we're at a good\nstopping point not to you want to do you\nwant do you um wait scratch that um I\nwould like to talk about or I think it\nwould be interesting if you've got like\nfive or 10 minutes my community bother\nme so much I watch some of the videos um\nwould you like to have like a quick like\n5 to 10 minute back and forth on the\nconversation you had with Dr Mike\nsure\nokay um I don't know 5 to 10 minutes\nwill be enough I do have to go in about\n20 minutes at the top end but I'm more\nthan happy to talk about what you want\nto talk about yeah so I've noticed that\num uh people obviously come at you a lot\nfor uh distinctions relating to oh also\nbefore you do that uh thank you for the\nlast conversation I appreciate that I\ndon't know that we were originally going\nto talk about that but yeah thank you\nI've got a lot of not got a lot yeah\nthanks\num for the uh Eastern medicine versus\nWestern medicine or\niath AIC AIC uh versus um what's the\nname for Western medicine my allopathic\nthat was it yeah uh medicine yeah that\nobviously you catch a lot of heat I'm\nsure you've seen comment sections you\nlike a lot of people go back and forth\num so I hear things that you say and I\nfeel like I'm understanding it but then\nobviously a lot of other people have\ndifferent feelings um so I guess asking\nyou\nI guess like Point Blank for how you\nwould lay this out what do you think is\nthe um what do you think is like the\nrole that either Eastern medicine or an\nunderstanding in eastern medicine could\nor should be playing when it comes to uh\nintegrating it into Western medicine or\nlike contemporary mental health treat\nlike yeah what do you think is like the\nmost appropriate role there I guess yeah\nso I think it's so the first thing is I\nwas taken aback by the Dr Mike\nconversation I was not expecting and it\ntook me a while to figure out what was\ngoing on and to recognize that his heat\nis coming from other people talking\nabout ayurva yes so and that that was it\nwas really weird because I was like I'm\nI'm confused why you are framing things\nthe way that you are when you ask me\nabout them because that's not actually\nthe way that I think about them so first\nof all here's kind of what my journey\nwith Eastern medicine was so I was quite\nskeptical and then saw some things in\nIndia that I considered to be medical\nimpossibilities and even to this day or\nconsidered medical\nimpossibilities okay so but once you see\nthat then you have to wonder like what's\ngoing on and by the way this this sounds\nvery grandiose but this is actually true\nof meditation so let's remember that\nlike 60 years ago the idea that\nmeditation could have a positive impact\non your mental health was considered a\nmedical\nimpossibility so what I've come to\nunderstand now is that in eastern\ntraditions of medicine they developed\nthey used a completely different set of\ncompass they used a completely different\nCompass to develop a practice like they\nthey like used a different realm of data\nlet's say we think that our realm of\ndata is very good but our realm of data\nhas some critical shortcomings the\nsimplest of which is something called\nexternal validity which we all know in\nmedicine we don't even realize that you\ncan design a system of medicine that\ndoesn't have an external validity\nproblem so I'll give you an example of\nwhat this means so also wait real quick\ncan you define when you say external\nvalidity I'm okay so we have something\ncalled a randomized control trial which\nis a large populationbased study MH in\nwhich we take a thousand people 500 we\ngive Placebo 500 we give an intervention\nthen we measure the average\nImprovement now at the end of this trial\nlet's say that there's a 30% Improvement\nin something like depression when I give\nthis patient this medication what is the\nexpect Ed benefit in their depression do\nyou\nknow um the expected benefit I guess you\nwould expect three out of 10 patients\nyou give the treatment to to have a\nstatistically significant improved\noutcome Rel to 30% right so Nuance right\nbut what is the actual benefit we don't\nknow sure so our system wait wait when\nyou say actual benefit are you referring\nto like the underlying physiological\nstuff are you just saying like how it\nappears in their life or what look like\nso the average benefit for 500 people\nmay be 30% but whether this person will\nget 0% benefit 50% benefit 90% benefit\nwe don't know oh sure okay okay right\nand and and people think well of course\nyou can't know because you can't see the\nfuture but this is a wrong way of\nthinking because our system of medicine\nthis is so hard to understand until you\nsee it done the other way this is kind\nof like saying like Okay like you\nknow gravity goes one way like you don't\nthat's a bad analogy so I'll give you an\nanalogy for my personal life so we don't\nrealize that our conscious\noperate locate has a localization in\nspace until you have an outof body\nexperience once you have an experience\nof your Consciousness being in a\ndifferent place outside of your body\nevery moment of our existence our\nConsciousness exists within our body\nbecause that's where it is all the time\nuntil you have an outof Body Experience\nokay there's biological correlates to\nthis you can electrically stimulate this\npart of the brain called The temporo\nparial Junction and you can trigger an\noutof body experience in someone okay so\nin rcts what we do is we look at\npopulations of people and we our system\nof medicine is designed to look at the\naverage benefit for the average person\nit's not trying to figure out what works\nfor a individual does that make sense\nbecause we're looking at our systems of\nour systems of science are population\nbased so you're going to get a\npopulation based answer Yeah by\ndefinition you're if you're doing a big\nRCT versus like a case study you're\nlooking at literally the yeah average so\nso the Eastern systems of medicine don't\nlook at populations they look at\nindividuals so the sample their system\nof medicine is based on Sample sizes of\none M okay this is also why like and\nthere are a couple of like benefits to\nthis so a lot of the stuff that I taught\nyou today Vasa and glisha MH these are\nnot these are not Concepts that were\ndiscovered through rcts or research\nthese Concepts have been discovered\nthrough rcts and research you have\npeople like Aaron Beck who came up with\nthe concept of automatic thought we know\nthat there's cognitive bias but we can\narrive at the truth from two different\nangles mhm the big difference is that if\nyou get a PhD in Psychology you won't\ntransform your life if you spend the\nsame amount of time doing yoga I truly\nbelieve you will be a more different\nhuman being so when you're dealing with\nsample size of one if you look at like\nlet's say meditation versus\nPsychotherapy Psychotherapy in the\npractice of medicine is about on average\nchanging People mhm but I don't know if\nthis makes sense you can read a study of\nabout dopamine detox and Tech addiction\nit's not going to result in you reducing\nyour Tech usage right information\ndoesn't create behavioral change so if\nwe look at the yogic system and the\nEastern system they operate from a\nsubjective place they don't operate from\nan objective place now that has all\nkinds of problems but the beauty is\nthey're operating subjectively so they\nknow what works from the inside to make\na change in your life that's what yoga\nis about it's about the pursuit of\nhappiness not about\nand we can do like scientific studies\nabout okay you have to make 100K a year\nif you don't want to get divorced have a\ncommute that's less than 45 minutes we\nhave all these kinds of all this data\nbut if you're someone who makes $30,000\na year you can't apply that information\nthis is the problem of external validity\nthe problem of external validity is for\na scientific study how easy is it to\napply this conclusion to people outside\nof the\nstudy so it's totally fine to say a\ngreat example of this is there's a\nmedication called um can't believe I'm\nblanking olanzapine okay and olanzapine\nis an amazing medication if you look at\na clinical trial it reduces symptoms of\nbipolar disorder reduces symptoms of\nschizophrenia improves anxiety helps\npeople sleep awesome medication when you\ngive it to patients it doesn't work well\ndo you know\nwhy uh confounding variable that's like\nhampering the ability of the medication\ncauses them to gain 80 lbs which when\nyou were in a clinical trial and you\nwere being paid to take the medication\nday in and day out and they are\nmeasuring the blood blood levels you\nwill take it even if you gain 80 pounds\nso this is just a shortcoming that\ndemonstrates the problem of external\nvalidity when you how would you deal\nwith um because I'm sure there are some\npeople um where and real quick you said\nyour heart out is like in 13 minutes\nyeah yeah okay so people would argue\nwith you and say sure talking about\nreasonable limitations but these\nwouldn't be limitations of external\nvalidity um these would be uh these\nwould be expect or these would be\nrestrictions or further things that you\nwould apply to a study to make it like\nyou would look at like the drop off rate\nfor instance in a particular trial or\nyou would look or you would try to\ncontrol for other variables or whatever\nin order so so we have trials that do\nthat so I love something called\nnaturalistic studies so there's a\nbeautiful trial called Step BD which is\nan awesome trial of bipolar disorder\nthat is a naturalistic study so it\nwasn't a randomized controlled trial so\nwe this is the other problem with\nWestern medicine is we think of rcts as\nthe the highest level of evidence\nthere's good reasons why we have that\nbut there's advantages and\ndisadvantages a naturalistic study is\none where you give the medication to\npeople and if they want to take it they\ntake it if they don't want to take it\nthey don't have to take it kind of thing\nso there's naturalistic studies that I\npersonally like prefer so when I see a\nnaturalistic study on a particular\ncondition and what works for it like\nI'll lean into that more sure yeah I had\na huge debate with a friend recently\nover the efficacy of a medicine and we\nhad a big disagreement because they said\nthat the medicine was really um was I\ndon't remember we I don't know if it was\nonam or off stream but they were arguing\nthat a treatment was incredibly\neffective and I said that it wasn't\nreally that effective because the most\npeople just won't do it uh you get like\nthese huge drop off rates and it's like\nthe medicine really only matters if it's\nboth effective at treating the thing and\nif patients are likely to stick the to\nthe particular regimen um which was yeah\nlike a yeah so so yeah so so I I I think\neven when you say best like what are you\nmeasuring what are you including right\nso when you really understand research\nyou begin just realize that like there's\nall kinds of flaws in all kinds of\nresearch now going back to like where\ndoes alternative medicine fit in so my\narea of expertise before this whole\ntwitch thing happened was actually\nevidence-based complimentary and\nalternative medicine the whole reason I\ngot accepted into residency at MGH in\nHarvard was because like I was like I'm\ninterested in evidence-based\ncomplimentary and alternative medicine I\ndid my I was in my first research lab\ndoing EEG readings of meditators because\nI was like what the [ __ ] is this this is\nbizarre in 2003\nand and so I'm a big believer in using\nscientific validity\nto understand what is good and bad about\nalternative medicine there are a couple\nof problems with that though okay the\nfirst is\nthat so the first thing here's why I\nthink it's important right so like it's\nso interesting because like on the\ninternet and in the alpath world I'm\nkind of viewed as like radical but like\nwhen I in the Eastern medicine world I'm\nviewed as alpath so I think that there's\nlike advantages and disadvantages to\nboth the first problem with Eastern\nmedicine is that they have not\nrigorously tested\nanything so we don't\nknow out of the Thousand treatments that\nayurva has we don't know which ones are\nmore effective or less effective and a\nhuge problem is that if you ask\nayurvedic Physicians they'll they all\nhave this tacit belief in the same way\nthat alpath have tacit beliefs that\nthey're not aware of that they're all\neffective this idea that one is more\neffective than another is absurd it's\njust about the patient right because\nthey have a sample size of one so they\ndon't think that the medication is\nineffective they think that it is\nineffective because of this particular\npatient okay so this is like a big bias\nso I think we should absolutely test\nthem 100% that's what I'm interested in\nnow there are a couple of other\nchallenges with that the first is that\nI'm a clinician and what I've learned\nfrom meditation is that like I feel a\npersonal drive and an acknowledgement\nthat we can't wait for rcts in some\ncases okay so like when I have a patient\nwho comes to me and says I want to learn\nmeditation the process that I go through\nwith them is that here's what the data\nshows here's a set of specific practices\nso there was just a huge I think trial\nthat came out that showed that\nmindfulness training for adolescence\ndoes actually can potentially harm\nmental health interesting really\nfascinating huge trial so do I think\nthat mindfulness can harm uh adolescent\npotentially it can but I don't think\nthat mindfulness is bad I think that\nthis is where there's so many flaws in\nthe mindfulness research what is the\nquality of the people who are teaching\nmindfulness for this trial that has\n8,000 students this is not a zen master\nso if we're measuring like what\nmeditation is truly capable of we have\nthis 8-week course that you take to get\ncertified you maybe meditate a grand\ntotal of potentially 8 hours cuz no one\nchecks whether you do anything at home\nwe have a thousand people teaching\nmeditation how qualified are they who\nthe [ __ ] knows there's no way to measure\nit there's no test there's no\ncertification what used to happen is you\nspent 30 years training with a zen\nmaster at the end of 30 years you don't\neven get your master ship it's not even\nguaranteed so the whole system of of\nEastern medicine is developed in a\nparticular way we don't know what's\nright or what's wrong in my experience\nthere is a lot of utility to this the\nproblem is that the amount of time it\nwill take to verify for example the\nmanifestation of a tantri mantra I don't\neven know if we're ever going to be able\nto scientifically verify that I can\ndesign for you a trial that would do it\nby the way but I don't think we're\ncapable of running that trial so now the\nquestion becomes when you're sitting\nwith a human being this is what the\nquestion that I deal with is what do I\ndo for this person do I wait until\nscience can figure it out that is not\nalways the right answer and the whole\nreason that we have any research on\nmeditation is because people decided to\nnot wait right people decided to start\nintervening start studying it the belief\nof the efficacy came\nfirst and so because the big counter to\nthat idea then would be that uh like\nlike um somebody would make the\ncriticism of well what is it right for a\ntherapist or a clinician to essentially\nexperiment on a patient like what if\nthey're suggesting a treatment there is\nno data for it to work and not only does\nit not work it ends up like putting them\nin a worst spot yeah no no so so so so\nlet's let's be clear yeah that's a very\nthat's why I didn't finish so I go\nthrough a process of something called\ninformed consent okay right so what I do\nwhen I'm teach meditation to people is I\nsay here is the research on mindfulness\nwhat I teach you absolutely qualifies as\nmindfulness here are the expected\noutcomes that you can you can get based\non the research at the same time I've\nbeen to India and I've learned all kinds\nof weird esoteric [ __ ] all this stuff\nqualifies as mindfulness for sure but I\nbelieve that this particular branch of\nmindfulness will give you a potentially\ngreater clinical benefit than this other\nbranch of mindfulness that minimum\nexpectation is based on the RCT now I\ngive the patient a choice are you\nwilling to try this or not what do you\nwant to do and 99% of the time it's sort\nof a mood issue because the reason\nthey're in my office in the first place\nis because they're coming to me to learn\nthis stuff MH so informed consent like\nyou can do alternative medicine under\nyour license of of a medical doctor it\njust falls under your license and if\nthere's a problem then there's a problem\nso one thing that I I never do is give\nthem expectations for things that are\nlike in my opinion not scientifically\nverified this is why I don't use ivetic\nmedicine I use principles of it mhm so\nI'll make dietary changes based on ayur\nveic things but I explain to them this\nis not aortic medicine I don't do\nrasashastra which is like purifying you\nknow balls of arsenic in ghee by melting\nit for letting it boil for eight hours\nand then making it into a concoction and\nthen giving it to people I don't do\npunchak Karma which is things like enema\nand all these other kinds of practices\nthat people do I don't do anything like\nacupuncture or acupressure I focus on\nyoga\nmeditation taiichi and some amount of\nlike dietary change and the reason for\nthat is because those are the things\nthat have some evidence support behind\nit so what I kind of do is look at the\nven diagram of okay ayurva says eat\nfewer potatoes and eat more sweet\npotatoes but as a medical doctor I feel\ntotally fine saying hey eat more sweet\npotatoes we know here's what the science\nshows us about this kind of diet if\nyou're eating more vegetables eating\nmore this and the diet isn't like you\nknow eat fried chicken so they're all\ngoing to be in the positive direction\nanyway that's kind of how I practically\ndo it now the last question I think you\nhad is like this approach to Eastern\nmedicine so now I think the last thing\nis that you know I think that some of\nthe foundations of Eastern medicine can\nbe clinically very useful and when we\npull a treatment out of Eastern medicine\nand put it into Western medicine we lose\nsomething for sure this is also\nsomething that's hard to understand but\nyou can't understand this until you\nrealize that there's a way to practice\nmedicine that exists outside of the\ndisease model and this is what confuses\na lot of people because in in Western\nmedicine we treat diseases we don't\ntreat people and people like a lot of\nlike [ __ ] cam people will say this\nkind of [ __ ] but I it's very precise\nlike your diagnosis is not your Steven\nyour diagnosis is bipolar disorder and\nthe treatments that we have are for\nbipolar disorder so we remove the\nindividual from the equation when we're\ndeveloping diagnoses and treatment\nthere's nothing individual there does\nthat make sense that's the purpose of an\nRCT now practically clinicians have to\noverc this because we know as clinicians\nthis is why you can't get an AI yet to\npractice medicine because we know that\nyou as Stephen your bipolar disorder\nwhen bipolar disorder manifests within\nyou it will be completely unique and\neven though this medication works on\naverage for the average person is\nbipolar disorder I know from the second\nI step into the office as a clinician\nthat your mileage may vary so in the in\nin the practice of clinical medicine we\nintroduce\nindividuality I think the last thing to\nconsider is that I think scientific\nverification of Cam stuff is fantastic\nreal quick can you say that ter Twi cam\nstuff yeah complimentary alternative\nmedicine okay gotcha okay uh so\nscientific verification of that is like\nsomething I'm completely in favor of\nI've worked in Labs like I was in an uh\na taii lab in medical school worked at\nthis place called the Benson Henry\nInstitute at MGH they do a lot of like\nyou know scientific research and stuff\nlike that I'm all for research like I\ndon't I don't think we should be you\nknow completely not scientific about it\nokay but I I think that if we look at\nmedicine and I think meditation is kind\nof the the best example of this so I'm\nkind of curious I don't know how\nfamiliar you are with research but if I\ndid\nanalysis if I did if I tried to figure\nout what makes a sandwich so let's say\nI'm a scientist and I'm trying to\ndiscover what makes a\nsandwich do you know what I would likely\ndiscover about what's important what are\nthe what what is the minimum I need for\na\nsandwich um is it going to be like an\ningredient or a human being assembling\nthe sandwich or say say I'm a scientist\nand I'm trying to understand what a\nsandwich is okay so like I go out and I\nlike take a bunch of sandwiches and I\nmeasure them and I put my findings on\nsomething called a scatter plot if you\nknow what that is sure this may be like\na stupid question because I'm asking you\nto read my mind do you have a sense of\nwhat I would\ndiscover um do I have a sense of what\nyou would discover uh I don't know that\nyou include more conditions or things\nlike shapes or ingredients or whatever\nthat you would hone in closer and closer\nsome so practically what what what would\nhappen right so and this is like this is\na thought experiment that I'm creating\nin my own head there are lots of\narguments against it but this is kind of\njust my take and I'm trying to explain\nmy reasoning I'm not saying this example\nis 100% so here's what's going on on in\nthe research on meditation so this is\njust to illustrate what what I consider\nto be one of the weaknesses\nof and it's not that this weakness this\nis good but it is a temporary\nshortcoming over time it'll fix itself\nthe question is can human beings bother\nto wait sure um so if I take a a\nsandwich and I'm a scientist and let's\nsay in the same way that I'm a scientist\nstudying meditation I don't actually\nknow what this is I'm not a zen master\nyeah so what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to take a bunch of people who\nmeditate and I'm going to try to\nunderstand okay like what what is it to\nmeditate so I'm looking for the common\nvariables sorting out the noise right\nbecause in this spiritual tradition they\nworship this God and this spiritual\ntradition they bow to this Guru so what\ndoes it mean to truly meditate I look at\na thousand different traditions and I\ntrack what the elements of meditation\nare so if I were to do this for\nsandwiches I have a PB&J I have a ham\nand cheese sandwich I have a Subway\nsandwich I have a hogy I have a PoBoy I\nhave all these kinds of things and I\ntake each of these things and I plot the\ningredients on a scatter plot what I\nwill conclude is what do you think on\nout of all the sandwiches I I named what\nhas the highest correlation what's going\nto be at the\ntop my guess would be like two pieces of\nbread and some butter or something\nabsolutely two pieces of bread and then\nthe scientists will conclude that all of\nthe other ingredients are literally\nnoise and what makes a sandwich is two\npieces of bread then a scientist will go\nI discovered what a sandwich is I've\nheard that people really like sandwiches\nI'm going to open up a restaurant based\non my scientific understanding and I'm\ngoing to serve sandwiches enter my first\ncompany customer here's two pieces of\nbread enjoy your sandwich enter the next\ncustomer here's two pieces of bread\nenjoy your sandwich the next customer\nhere's two pieces of bread enjoy your\nsandwich this is what we do when we pull\nEastern medicine out of Eastern medicine\nand study it in a western way because\nwe're we're trying to focus on the\nthings that we know how to detect not\nwhat it's actually based on and you can\nargue that two pieces of bread is\nanything but a sandwich the sandwich is\nthis other thing it's the stuff inside\nthat makes it a sandwich but in a\nscientific study you won't detect that\nat the beginning\nthen over time then what you'll discover\nis that this doesn't seem to work out\nand then someone will discover oh it is\ntwo pieces of bread plus something in\nthe middle so we're doing that with\nmeditation but in terms of what is the\nadvantage of adopting the Eastern\nperspective because if you go if you're\na single scientist and you go and learn\nhow to make a sandwich then the trial\nthat you design is going to be so much\nbetter because you know what it is which\nis why case studies and everything are\nso important even for psychology and\nstuff because you can see individual\nstuff but well case studies have a whole\ndifferent G to comment on that because\nit's it's a whole different thing but in\nterms of Cam like I I think it's it's\nfine that I get a lot of heat on ayurva\nbecause I I think that that's like I\nmean even internally right so we had a\nstream a couple years ago so we we had a\nstream on ayurva someone posted a lot of\nstuff I made some claims that I didn't\nunderstand the research very well\nsomeone posted on a subreddit I'm really\ngrateful that person to this day and I\nlike thank them and they were like hey I\nthink that you're like over sighting the\nevidence like this is not as strong as\nyou say it is and then the subsequent\nstreams we've said hey like we even\npointed that out and then now like when\nI talk about ayurva I'm much more\ncareful I've been much more critical of\nthe research there's all kinds of other\nproblems that people don't realize\nthe simplest of which is like most\npeople don't recognize that India has\nits own set of like scientific indices\nthey have a whole research operation\nwhich if you Google Scholar you will\nnever find there's literally hundreds of\nthousands of research articles that are\npublished in China and in the United\nStates studying Cam that you cannot find\nunless you know what it is and it's\nactually crazy I'm tempted to screen\nshare with you sure well we can do it\nlater because you're two minutes P your\nheart out I'm\nyour time like I mean the the the the\nthe page looks like it's like from geoc\ncities if you remember that I'm I'm kind\nof familiar with this I've done a lot of\nlike Israel palese research and\nsometimes for some stuff you're looking\nfor if you don't know how to type in\nHebrew or Arabic you're never going to\nfind and so then when people say like\nthis is not scientific like we need to\nunderstand that between the Europe and\nthe United between Europe and the United\nStates and predominantly the\nEnglish-speaking world when we index all\nof our research there are two countries\nthat have the same number of people is\nthe US and Europe put together yeah and\nthey have their own research indices\nwhich like people don't realize yeah I\nthink there's a lot of difficulty in in\nin like fathoming like other epistemic\nFrameworks and I think there's a lot of\ninteresting conversation we have there\nbut um yeah [ __ ] maybe a at a different\npoint it'd be fun to chat about but um\nyeah you're at 343\nEST yeah so so did did that answer the\nquestion to your\nsatisfaction um no not really I should\nwe should wait until we have a longer\nokay what are the remaining\nwell I I I feel like I have a decent I\nguess my main question is um it feels\nlike when I watch you answer answer for\naurvedic medicine it feels like when\npeople uh ask me about questions where\nit's like I don't necessarily believe in\nthis as much as you think I do but you\nwant to take the opposite side so I'll\ngive the best faith representation and\nthen people think that you're uh my\nimpression is more extreme than you\nactually are or maybe you are that\nextreme I can't tell but so like even in\nmy own Community like I've had people\nsay like oh no like uh Dr K thinks we\nshould prescribe ayurvedic treatment\ninstead of ssris or Dr K believes this\nor that and then every single time it\nhappens I'll look at the clip and it's\nlike I don't think it's actually what\nhe's saying but it would be interesting\nto dive through some of those things\nbecause looking at your conversation\nwith Dr Mike Dr Mike um obviously knows\ninfinitely more about medicine uh and\nanything relating to being a physician\nthat I do but he didn't have a good\ngrasp of like the philosophy um in terms\nof like the differences of what was\ngoing on so it would be interested to\ndive into that at some point but yeah we\ndo that in the future I think I think\nthere's there's functional utility so\nthere's there's all kinds I mean this is\nsuch a not Nuance but there's so much\nfascinating stuff about like like ayurve\ndoas are not real they're never going to\nbe real they're all heuristics but just\nbecause it's a heuristic doesn't mean\nthat it doesn't have functional utility\nyeah because people have a problem\nontologically with understanding that\nlike humans aren't real yes they're not\nright but there's an underlying fact of\nthe matter that it's mapping onto which\nis why the different epistemic framework\nis inter because it might be that\nthere's a Dosha or something that you\nwould never understand from a western\nframework but from an Eastern framework\nyou'd find it and even though a Dosha is\nnot real it's actually mapping on to\nsomething that might give you a unique\nability to diagnose and prescribe\nsomething that you would have yeah\nthat's\nso the concept that things can be\nheuristic but not functionally useful is\nnot something that I most of the\nPhysicians that I've interacted with\nconsider on a daily basis they\nabsolutely understand the concept\nbecause we have some heuristics in\nmedicine and everyone's kind of familiar\nwith that yeah but like I think that\nthat's really confusing for a lot of\npeople and a lot of people who are\nanti-am which I think it's fair to be\nget caught up because there's no\nbiological proof of chi sure right which\nis fine like I think I don't think you\nneed biological proof I know that sounds\nreally weird I'd love to have it I'd\nlove to investigate it but this also\ngets to things like Consciousness and\nand non-material Realms and all kinds of\nweird [ __ ] left field stuff but very\npractically what we do know is that and\nthis is kind of what we know is the\npeople who investigated in these ways\ndeveloped practices like yoga meditation\nand taichi and we absolutely see that\nyoga and taiichi are clinically Superior\nto Simply moving your body mhm and the\nmore that we study the the Neuroscience\nof it we see that there are mechanisms\nat play that regular exercise doesn't\nattain so it doesn't mean that the chi\nis real it just means when they\ninvestigated Chi they stumbled upon some\nbiological mechanisms which seem to be\nfunctional without ever doing a biopsy\nor an x-ray sure so I think that's kind\nof like where I am I'm happy to talk\nabout it more at a later date but um\nokay but I I I I love talking about this\nstuff I think it's like so cool and I\nlove teaching about it and it's cool\nlike I I don't think it's like\nI I mean I get there's all kinds of\nflaws in what I'm saying too like so I\ncan point out the arguments and and\ncounterarguments and stuff because I've\nthought through all this stuff a lot\nwhich is like yeah I wish that people\nwere just a little bit better at um\nthere like at the end of the day if we\nhad a huge talk I don't know if I would\nagree much with Easter medicine at all\nmaybe maybe not but um I think there's a\nlot of value in being able to step into\nsomebody else's like epistemic framework\nand see what value you can draw from\nthat or maybe they've got a way of look\nat a particular problem that you just\nnever would think of looking at on your\nown and I think that I think that\nthrowing aside all of that and then also\nyou brought up a really good point about\nhow it's it's the classic materialist\nproblem to where oh well I'm I'm a\nmaterialist and was like really well\nwhat if I showed you a thing that wasn't\nmaterial I go well if I can measure it\nit is material so everything is\nmaterialism so you like you've defeated\nall forms of non-materialistic stuff\nbecause if you can perceive it in any\nsense you call it material in the same\nway that like for Eastern medicine if\nthere's stuff that's discovered that's\nworking that's not Eastern medicine\nanymore now it's Western medicine it's\nlike okay it's a little unfortunate you\ncan incorporate every single thing that\nI found that works into your system and\nnow I'm like yeah that that's something\nthat we also see which is that generally\nspeaking things are no longer considered\ncomplimentary and alternative medicine\nonce we have scientific verification of\nthem and so then what happens is let's\nsay we've got Al apathic medicine and\nwe've got cam this thing works in Cam\nand then once we study it it becomes a\npart of this medicine this is what\npeople will often times say there's a\nhuge problem with that argument because\nwhat that means is that you're defining\nthis by that which doesn't work yeah and\nso you will never believe in this\nbecause you're taking this and you're\nputting it over here which is what we've\ndone with mindfulness like no one even\nconsider I don't know if people would\nconsider mindfulness complimentary\nalternative medicine anymore yeah right\nso there's a lot of historical\nperspectives and stuff like that too\nlove to talk about it so we can do\nfollowup but cool well thanks a lot I\nreally appreciate the conversation the\npersonal and the impersonal so yeah yeah\ntake care man yeah have a good time\nadios um I'm gonna do this okay let me\nmake sure that I gotta go holy crap I'm\ngoing to get crushed okay um thank\nyouall very much for coming today yeah\nand if you guys want to talk more about\nlike Cam and ayva like I I'd love to\nhave another conversation I I was\nalready thinking about my followup with\nDr Mike because I think like I wasn't\nprepared to speak about those things so\nI hadn't like articulated things well um\nbut I I think it's like it's all like a\nvery very important conversation to have\nand I I think for those of youall that\nhave been around for a little while um\nyou know we talked about a lot of stuff\nand I strongly encourage yall to think\nabout those same concepts of like\ninsecurity filtering compliments through\nyour own perception right and there\nthere's like one last thing that I'll\nkind of leave yall with so here's the\nproblem with that so often times if\nsomeone compliments me and I'm unhappy\nlike I said like there's no way they can\nthink this so the basic problem with\nthat is that how can your mind ever be\nchanged right because you're getting\ninformation from the outside world but\ninstead of using that information to\nchange your belief you are using your\nbelief to change the\ninformation never going to work\nright so thank you all very much for\ncoming today we've got a lot of cool\nstuff planned in May oh wow this hair is\nreally has just decided to be like this\nokay um and uh we've got an awesome\nCommunity event which is make it we've\ngot our make it challenge which every\nweek we're setting aside stuff for y'all\nto uh a framework to help y'all plan and\nexecute actions that was week one I\nthink week two is um relationships\nso understanding and like actually\nexecuting changes in relationships and\nbuilding social skills and stuff like\nthat I forget what week three is and\nweek four is maybe making an impact in\nthe outside world so how can you like\nmake a positive impact in the people\naround you so like I mentioned at the\nbeginning of of my conversation with\nStephen we're working on making things\nmore applicable for yall so it's not\njust like listen to Dr K talk it's like\nactually we're going to give you a\nframework for y'all to do particular\nthings\nand when you do those things you'll\naccumulate points if we as a community\ngenerate enough points we will do things\nlike a Dr K dating advice or Dr K react\nstream to like dating coaches or\nsomething pickup artists oh yeah it's\nPick Up Artist react stream and then um\nthings like\nthat so definitely check that out chat\num thank you all very much for coming\ntoday we'll see yall tomorrow actually\nwe've got a stream on complex PTSD so\nit's a deep dive"
