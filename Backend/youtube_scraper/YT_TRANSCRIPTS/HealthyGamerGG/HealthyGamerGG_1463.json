    "transcript": "okay so welcome everyone this is we're\ntalking with feral cat is that right yes\nand so feral helped me understand a\nlittle bit about so first of all thank\nyou so much for coming on stream today\nand I'd love to hear a little bit about\nwhat you thought about our last stream\nand sort of what motivated you to come\non stream today yeah it really impressed\nme like I really liked what you had to\nsay about especially the part about just\ngamers and kind of their mindset and\nstuff like that and I think I've\nexperienced something similar for sure\nlike back in the spring pretty sure I\nwas like I guess addicted to gaming like\nI could stop but um-hmm the things that\nyou were saying really you were really\nrelatable so okay and when you say the\nthings that I was saying what do you\nthink was applicable to your situation\nback in in the spring um\nI think you said like one thing that\nreally resonated and it was more like\nyou know what you need to do but you\ndon't do it and so I think that for sure\nlike I would kind of just like play\ngames all day or like try to improve\nforce training stuff like that but I\nwasn't focused on like my personal goals\nas well\nand so I definitely like interference re\nmy cat's gonna make it appearance so\nyeah so so and but it sounds like you\nwere saying that that that in march or\nearlier that was an issue so that\nimplies that things have gotten better\nyes so I like kind of put a limit on\nmyself now a hug days where I don't have\nclass or something like that and I'll\ngive myself a certain amount of free\ntime or like a certain amount of gains\nor something and then just kind of go\nfrom there and not play anymore and I\nstill give myself a little bit too much\nfree time sometimes but it's I don't\nthink I that's me I'm like I don't know\nif they're like happy the right word um\nbut it's a different kind of reward I\nguess it's more like a pretty time sort\nof yeah sure so Farrell if I can push\nyou a little bit on that like so why\ndidn't you do that in the spring like\nwhat's\num well during that time like I was\nactually on a medication that was giving\nme like really bad anxiety and probably\nlike depression now that I think back on\nit but I just wasn't realizing it then\nand and I think that I guess like\nplaying games was more like just to kind\nof not think about it for sure because\nlike it was hard for me to know the\nclass or like just get everything done\nstuff like that so now I've like cleared\nup those sort of issues and I think\nclearing up like the physical issues and\nalso like some I mean not completely\nlike the mental issues with it but that\ndefinitely helped a lot so I got a toss\nout a disclaimer at this point so you\nknow I'm a psychiatrist but I can i\nexpense medical advice over the internet\nyeah\nand so I'm glad that you know if you so\nthis is a common problem I do see is\nthat people a lot of gamers get started\non medication because they sort of fit a\nbucket right so when you go and see a\npsychiatrist or a therapist a lot of\ntimes like they haven't I mean no one\nreally gets trained in video game\naddiction right now because we don't\nreally understand it so you'll get a lot\nof people a lot of times people will get\nstarted on things like medications and\nthose will have side effects it's\nactually a really common problem that I\nsee I'm sorry you had to go through that\nyeah that's okay um the medication I was\non wasn't like related to like anxiety\ndepression okay the side effects came\nfrom it yeah okay yeah so so it now it\nsounds like things are going better for\nyou right yeah they're going better\num on in that aspect I guess if that\nmakes sense like I'm able to kind of\npull myself out of those situations\nbetter that makes sense so yeah so what\nsituation are you pulling yourself out\nof um I think just getting like I kind\nof get into a cycle of letting myself be\nlazy innocence or like letting myself\nyou know just kind of put actual\nresponsibility aside and just like play\ngames or like even stream I already say\nI like stream too much because like\nstreaming is very exhausting I guess\nlike you have to put a lot of energy out\nfor that so I think if you're gonna sit\nback up a game than not stream it's a\nbit more addicting in that sense um but\nnow I I know like when I'm I guess going\ntoo far I guess now I'm like okay\nlike we need to do some responsibilities\nlike be productive now instead of just\num what about streaming is exhausting um\nI think as a streamer or like you kind\nof just have to be on at all times so be\nlike keep your viewers or like entertain\nyour audience stuff like that so mm-hmm\nbacking definitely it really tiring\nespecially whenever inside you really\njust kind of one sit there if you like\noh I just want to like kind of lay back\nfor a minute and just like chill out but\nit's if you do that you know you I think\nI don't know if that's a common problem\nwith streamers but you married yeah you\nmight lose your viewers or you know\nsomething I get bored like what if\nsomebody came in at that minute like\nthere are even videos on YouTube that\ntell you like you you know you never\nknow whenever someone is going to stop\ninto your stream and whenever they do\nyou want to be on and like be\nentertaining so they stay which is like\nI guess a good tip but kind of not good\nfor your mentality yes so what happens\nif someone comes on to your stream and\nyou're not firing on all cylinders um I\nmean I think I can kind of give this\nfrom my experience just going into other\npeople's dreams too and of course I like\ndon't do this on purpose have I already\nestablished a relationship with someone\nor something like that I would say but\nyou're going to someone's new stream and\nthey're just sitting there like not\ntalking I guess it could definitely not\nbe as entertaining first of all you have\nto walk into so what's wrong with that\nyeah um I think it makes it really hard\non the streamer it makes it very\nmentally exhausting and like I don't\nknow how else to describe it but yeah so\nI guess I'm asking us like my question\nwas a little bit vague so I understand\nthat it's mentally exhausting what I'm\nsaying is what's wrong with you being on\nstream and someone coming and not being\nentertained I guess a streamer either\nself or like me personally I would not\nfeel like I'm doing something wrong in a\nsense but I guess kind of that's how I\nwould feel yeah yeah yeah right so so\nlet's think about that for a second what\nare you doing wrong technically nothing\nbut absolutely but that's not how it\nfeels right so what what what do you\nwhat do you feel like you're doing wrong\nI think in that moment I would it would\nbe like not growing my stream it would\nyou know yeah there you go\nright so why is it important to grow\nyour stream I think both feeling\nsuccessful with it and knowing you've\nput so much time into it that it like if\nyou're doing it for nothing\nwhy are you doing it and I think that\ngets kind of hard because a lot of\npeople start for fun and say like I know\nI started for fun and I didn't care\nabout views and stuff like that and to\nan extent I have to kind of push myself\naway from caring about that at the same\ntime I think a lot of people put you\nknow themselves for Twitch's goals for\nlike partnership or something like that\nlike certain viewership and it makes it\nhard to not focus on the numbers because\nhow else do you track your success I\nguess yeah so what so you said you\nstarted out streaming for fun\nand then why do you stream now um it\nyeah I actually took a break over the\nsummer because I think I kind of lost\nsight of why I did stream and other\nissues as well but um I try not to\nstream if I'm having if I know that I'm\nabout to stream for the wrong reasons\nthat makes sense like if I'm like oh I'm\nonly gonna stream because it's going to\nplease everyone\nor because I'm not keeping to my\nschedule or whatever so now I kind of\ntry to spin you know whenever I'm in a\ngood mindset and I know that I'm doing\nit I want to have fun and like connect\nwith everyone and yeah so okay mm-hmm\nthat sounds like a big point of personal\ngrowth for you right definitely I think\nI needed I took like a two-month break\nfrom it and if I wouldn't have I don't\nknow if I'd still be storming it so yeah\nso so let's just think a little bit\nabout like so it sounds like you started\nout streaming for fun and then something\nchanged and then you kind of like dove\nin a little bit too deep you started\nstreaming for quote-unquote all of the\nwrong reasons\nyeah and then you took a break and now\nyou're kind of back into it with like\nyou know sort of enjoyment and fun\nyou're kind of streaming for the\noriginal reasons\nright so what was it that changed there\nin the middle how did streaming become\nnot very fun for you um I remember there\nwas a time back in December where I\nguess my starting started picking up a\nlot and I got pretty close to like\ngetting partnered except um I wasn't\nstreaming enough days I guess and so\nwhat I've liked realize now is that I\ndidn't know why I was like avoid\nstreaming at that point but I think I\nthought I wasn't going to get it anyway\nso if I just kind of like didn't stream\nup days I could like blame it on that\nreason if that makes sense\nyeah that's beautiful can we talk about\nthat because I think that's something\nthat so I want to introduce this concept\nto you guys of ego right so like our ego\nis a very very fragile thing and the\nmore confident we become actually the\nsmaller our ego becomes and so I know\nthat like when I was so part of the\nreason that I skipped class is because\nif I went to class and then got a bad\ngrade on the test then I was stupid\nright but if I skipped class then the\nreason that I got a bad grade is like I\nhave this out for my ego right like it's\nlike okay so if I'm if I'm half-assing\nit that's the reason I didn't get the\npartnership it's not because I actually\ntried my hardest and I'm not good enough\nright no that's exactly why I skipped\nclass too sometimes so yeah yeah so\nFarrell where do you get the idea that\nyou may not be good enough um you know\nI've talked about this a little bit\nbefore so I think I have a better idea\nnow but um I think it definitely has to\ndo with just past like relationships\nlike romantic and with my parents and\nstuff so yeah yeah so so as we can see\non screen so you're becoming a little\nbit more uncomfortable yeah I guess\nthough yeah yeah so something about your\nfacial expression in your tone and stuff\nchange it's okay we're just gonna steer\nclear to a different topic so you can\nrelax the other thing that tends to\nhappen is sometimes when you point out\nthat people are becoming um\nwill they become even more uncomfortable\nokay and but so I think that that's well\nI'm gonna kind of steer a little bit\nbecause I'm new to doing this over the\ninternet like I have a relationship with\nKangas oh I don't mind diving in with\nhim but I feel a little bit more\nprotective I don't mind being\nuncomfortable okay okay I mean do you\nwanna so Farrell we're at a fork in the\nroad right so we can talk a little bit\nmore about streaming or we can talk a\nlittle bit more about you what would you\nprefer yeah I'm glad you are so you know\na couple of other ground rules so like\nif there's anything that you don't want\nto talk about just say that and you know\nthe viewers can go screw themselves\nso it's you know remember that we're\nAltima Twiggy R for you and and this\nisn't a show I mean the goal of this is\nto help people not actually entertain\npeople so right that's true\nwell I think I haven't really ever\ntalked about streaming with the\ntherapists or anything so I think that\nwould also be helpful for me too yeah so\nso why does so when when we said when\nyou start to stream I guess that you\nknow what it sounds like what started to\nhappen is you had certain reasons which\nwere yours but then something changed\nand you started to feel judged or more\ninsidiously valued mm-hmm based on the\ncontent of your stream right so I think\nit was a combination of like people kind\nof pushing me I guess are like also\nexpecting more like definitely like chat\nhas a way of like some things if they\nsay that I think kind of like eat a lot\nof streamers is it whenever anyone\ncomments on like viewcount like low or\nhigh like even if some was like oh my\ngod like you have like a thousand\nviewers or something or oh you only have\ntwo viewers you know something like that\nlike either way I don't like those\ncomments because I turn my viewer count\noff because I don't like yeah I don't\nknow it'll it'll mess with me you know\nso I try not to look at it and that\nhelps me just kind of like have a more\npleasant stream in general and also I\nthink people will just be like oh wow\nwhat are you gonna apply for partner\nwhen are you gonna do this like you know\nso many viewers or even the comments\nlike oh wow you should have more\nwhy do you only have this mini I think\nthat's a mint is a compliment but it's\nkind of like low-key not a compliment\nit's like yeah it's like nagging right\nright yeah it's like what are you doing\nwrong yeah like why don't you yeah yeah\nso so what I think it's a really\ninsightful point on your part to\nrecognize that viewership has this kind\nof impact on you so let's dig down a\nlittle bit further like why do you turn\noff viewers what is it what are all\nthese comments do to you so I can't\nremember when exactly I started turning\noff viewers it was definitely probably\nlike nine to ten months ago I used to\nleave it on because I wanted to like see\nwhat games did better or like what\nviewers but like wow that's a really\nunhealthy way to look at it what's\nunhealthy about that I think like if\nyou're putting yourself through playing\nsomething you don't really like just to\nget more viewers that's just like it\nanything like you're not gonna be happy\nand you're I don't know it'll just put\nyou in a negative mood like that's what\nI yeah I think that's definitely true so\nso if it's okay with you Fredo will dig\nwhy why I think whenever you're doing\nsomething only for other people's like I\nguess it's kind of a roundabout way like\nit's for their entertainment yet it\ncoming back for your views so that's\nkind of how you justify it but at the\nend of the day it's like you're not\nhappy with what you're doing I think\nthat's where you start streaming for the\nwrong reasons\nyeah so I'm gonna toss out a word hmm\nauthentic versus inauthentic yeah right\nyeah I think that's I think authenticity\nwould be whenever you'd assume whatever\ngain you want yeah we were for sure so I\nwork with a lot of people who suffer a\nlot and I think that the biggest thing\nthat I found is that when a human being\nis living a life that they feel\nauthentic that it feels good to them\nright and if we kind of circle if we\ncircle back to like you know why you\nstarted out streaming that felt\nauthentic to me yeah and then after you\ntook your break you actually sort of\nrediscovered your authenticity right\nand the funny thing about streaming is\nthat like as you stream you start to\nadopt like a value system which is like\nquantifiable which actually our brains\nare wired to do right we think about\nthese things like let's say popularity\nin high school which is like such a\nvague thing but now we have a way to\nactually quantify and this may sound\njudgmental so I apologize but we have a\nway to quantify your value as a human\nbeing yeah it's the number of viewers\nyou get it's the number of partnerships\nyou get it's a way for you to rank\nyourself in terms of value compared to\nother people did you find yourself like\nwhen you were in the dark place of\nstreaming did you find yourself\ncomparing yourself to other people yeah\nfor sure like I would oh my gosh yeah I\ndon't know if anyone else does this I'm\nsure they do but I would find myself\nlike I guess comparing myself to other\npeople who had like similar number of\nfollowers and being like well okay if we\nhave like a similar number of followers\nwhy are they getting this videos I'm\ngetting this many of you do something\nlike that like it was crazy like that if\nI did that now I would drive itself\ninsane\nso yeah I don't know I would do that and\nthen I think one thing that I would\ndefinitely do is like not even play\ngames because a lot of girls will get\nmore viewers in like the just chatting\nsection where I mean I guess that's what\ny'all are streaming in now but you can\njust kind of talk about whatever and\npeople who would lose interest if you\nwould start playing games and so I just\nwouldn't yeah\nlike and that was not very enjoyable\nlike I started streaming to play games\nlike and make friends you know so yeah\nyeah so what was it with it so there's\nso like let's just think a little bit\nabout this for a second there was\nsomething inside you that was driving\nyou to do things that you did not enjoy\nand made you suffer right yeah what the\nhell was that I like I guess the shallow\nanswer that would be to like oh just\ngrit your teeth through this so you can\nget partner okay so why is that a\nshallow answer um I'm sure there are\ndeeper issues to that\nbut I'm not exactly sure what they are I\nguess so\nso Farrell you you do something\nsometimes rarely which is that you make\nself judgmental or self-critical\nstatements you devalue yourself do you\nsee that like this is a shout like why\nis that a shallow answer I guess it's\nnot yeah I mean I would encourage you to\nthink a little bit about you know it's I\nmean I think that that is a deep answer\nright that that like I think that\nthere's a part of you that it it looks\nlike you have a lot of really positive\nqualities which I think are getting\nhijacked by the streaming which is that\nit sounds like you're oriented towards\nsuccess like you're calculating you\nyou're like optimizing I'd be very\ncurious if you're comfortable sharing so\nI just realized you know before we\nstarted stream that I asked you where\nyou're from and I guess maybe I\nshouldn't do those kinds of things on\nstream it's like a natural thing but\nokay anyway I was from Houston so\nanytime I see another Texan I get did\nyou watch any do you watch college\nfootball there was a there was a couple\nof good games yesterday but oh I guess\nnot the right platform right for twitch\nbut so just to kind of think back a\nlittle bit about like you know you're\nsaying about this stuff is shallow but I\ndon't think so\nright because you don't strike me as a\nvery and forgive me a maybe this is the\njudgmental statement you don't strike me\nas a very shallow person do you feel\nlike a shallow person nope okay so what\nwas it that caused you to kind of what\nwhat mattered to like so you value\nviewership partnership what is it within\nyou that values that right because\nwhatever that thing is is causing you to\nengage in behaviors that cause you a lot\nof like suffering right so what is that\nthing definitely like the feeling of\nsuccess I guess I think that's the best\nanswer for that absolutely\notherwise what I would keep doing it\nyeah and what is that feeling what does\nthat mean I'm feeling I mean because\ngood so\nI think putting yourself through those\nbad feelings do you feel the good\nsuccess does that sound good to you\nno not entirely but yeah so I'm gonna\nalso ask you to think a little bit about\nwhether so we have this blanket idea\nthat success is better than failure\nmm-hmm right what do you think about\nthat I think it's something I tell\nmyself a lot is not true but I don't\nthink I completely internalized that\nyeah but what do you tell yourself let's\nlet's go well I think I don't know so\nmuch of worth streaming well I have an\nexample with streaming too but\ndefinitely with school like that's\nsomething I'm trying to kind of flip\naround so that that's what I've been\ntelling myself this semester is it's\nbetter to go even if I do bad though we\nshall learn from it um whereas I used to\njust not go because you know like you\nsaid earlier you wouldn't even have a\nchance to be bad so yeah um with\nstreaming I think whenever I came back\nto it early August I pretty much had to\ntell myself like okay like even if I\nlost pretty much everyone and all I have\nyou know one beer that comes back like\nit's I'm gonna do it for the original\nreasons and I just want to be fun again\nso okay so Farrell I'd like to change\ngears for a second and offer a couple of\ngeneral principles which I think may\napply to our viewership but so I want\nyou to notice so there's something that\nI think about which is an action\norientation versus an outcome\norientation so sometimes people focus on\nthe actions and sometimes people focus\non the outcomes and generally speaking I\nthink that gamers because games sort of\ntrain our brain to do this they care\nabout the outcome right like a lot of\ntimes if you think about a game it's not\nabout whether you played a good game\nit's about whether you won or lost right\nright so they're like goals and their\nobjectives and things like that and and\nwould you say that you tend to focus on\noutcomes or do you focus on actions I\nthink I focus on okay what do you think\nabout that I think that makes\nin between from start to finish\nless enjoyable I guess he's like I guess\nin a game if you're doing really bad and\nyou still win it's like well that kind\nof sucks but at least you got the win or\nlike you know the rank up or whatever\nand then I guess in classes I kind of\nsee myself doing that too like oh if it\nsays on the syllabus oh well your final\nreplaces your lowest grade or something\nlike that\nlike I just won't care about one exam\nand then leave it to the final and\nwhenever I get there I'm always like wow\nI really shouldn't have done that so\nyeah so so I want to ask you so we were\ntalking a little bit about you know you\nwere saying that nowadays you decided\nrecently that you're gonna go to school\nanyway because at least even if you\ndon't do well you'll learn something is\nthat is that focusing on an action or\nfocusing on an outcome I think in\ndelaying and it doesn't matter what the\noutcome is yeah so how does that make\nyou feel better better yeah so let me\nask you when you started streaming where\nyou focused on actions or where you\nfocused on outcomes oh my god I'm so\nexcited to go live you know not oh my\ngod like what absolutely and then when\nyou started when streaming started to be\ncrappy for you where you focused on\nactions or outcomes outcomes for sure\nbecause I would make myself go live and\nbe like even if this light was not fun\nfor me at least I'll get that extra day\nwith the viewership towards the\npartnership or whatever absolutely and\nnow that you've recharged right are you\nfocusing on actions or outcomes and\nstreaming definitely actions like I may\ngo a week without streaming just because\nI have to put school first and it\ndoesn't bother me like it does a little\nbit but not near to the extent it used\nto like I'll be like people will still\nbe there if they're not and they're not\nunderstanding like I don't really want\nthem there anyway so yeah I'm more doing\nit for fun I actually do not care about\npartnership at all now like if I don't\nget partnered it does not a big deal to\nme what what is partnership by the way\ncan you explain that\nthat's kind of like whatever like I see\ny'all are\nout to the affiliates on here so\nbasically you can start getting subs and\nthen you start making money from subs\nand then partnership is kind of where a\ncompany will start taking you more\nseriously and I guess people will start\nseeing you more it's a serious streamer\nyeah it's like getting verified on\nsomething oh my god so ok yeah I think\nthat's one of the main goals for a lot\nof yeah so I just want to kind of tunnel\ndown for this or just restate this so I\nmean if we listen to Farrell's story\nright we see a pretty classic thing\nwhere you start out like being yourself\nright and you're like doing things for\nthe sake of fun and all that good stuff\nand then instead of like doing streaming\nfor the sake of streaming you start\nstreaming for the sake of something else\nright you're not doing the thing for the\nsake of the thing and I think a lot\nabout this so I work with a lot of\ngamers around you know Fitness is\nanother issue and a lot of people will\nlike come into my office and we'll say\nlike oh you know I wanna I wanna get in\nshape right and they focus on this\ntarget of getting in shape so Farrell\nlet me ask you can you get in shape yeah\nwell yeah so I would argue that actually\nyou it's impossible to get in shape\nbecause what does that even mean like\nyeah that's like some arbitrary and yeah\nabsolutely\nright not only is it arbitrary it's also\nlike not quantifiable at least with\npartnership you've got a grade but\nsomething like getting in shape so\npeople like or like oh I want to get in\nshape and then the problem with focusing\non an outcome is that if you have a\nsetback you feel like a failure yeah and\nthe cool thing about what you've managed\nto do is you've started to focus on your\nactions which is like I'm not gonna\nworry about whether I get in shape or\nnot is like I don't care about what I\ncare about is doing ten push-ups a day\nlike I'm gonna do ten push-ups a day and\nI think what's what's cool is like you\nknow you're starting to say like okay\nI'm gonna stream for the sake I'm just\ngonna start streaming I'm gonna like\nthat's the equivalent of just doing ten\npush-ups a day and if I get partnership\nfantastic if I don't get partnership\nthat's fine too I'm gonna go to class do\nyou mind if I ask what you're studying\nbiomedical science\nand what do you want to do with that do\nyou know uh well I'm kind of going back\nto I wanted to do like pre PA okay\nawesome I think that also having like a\ngoal in mind it's very hard for me to do\nsomething without having a goal so\nwhatever I was just studying and not\nhaving like a goal like that because I\nused to be like pre-med pre PA but I\nkind of steered away from that and now\nI'm good for you yeah that's what I want\nto do yeah good I had a very similar so\nI was pre-med when I entered college but\nI was pre-med because I was brown and\nyou know my parents were doctors and\nthings like that and like that's what\nthe brown kids did at the University of\nTexas at Austin as they were all pre-med\nright and then decided not to become a\ndoctor and then years later decided that\nI needed to become a doctor right and I\nthink there's a lot of value in sort of\narbitrarily doing something because you\nkind of put a target to it and then sort\nof really doing some soul-searching like\nso now it sounds like you're circling\nback to it and it's something that\nyou're serious about yeah so my parents\nare the same like they expected me to be\nan engineer or a doctor like something\nlike that um and I was super super\nmotivated like freshman year sophomore\nyear and then I wasn't doing it for me\nso that is can't stick I think you\nhelped though yeah um yeah so then once\nI I don't I've been thinking about it\nfor the past like month or so and I\nnoticed that I do this like I kind of\nsearch for like approval things so like\nI'll tell people things before I even\nknow what I think of it and so I told\nmyself like I am NOT going to do that at\nthis time like I'm not going to mention\nit to anyone and so I've been thinking\nabout it for about a month now again not\nmen to me to anyone and not losing\ninterest because sometimes it'll just\nkind of come back and I'll be like maybe\nand then kind of never think about it\nagain but yeah I didn't lose interest\nand then I started to kind of be like\nokay now I can ask people just to get\nkind of like help I guess because I'm I\nfeel very behind now but it's okay I\nwilling to work through it so um so I'm\na little bit curious about this thing\nthat you said where are you kind of like\nyou didn't even realize that you wanted\ndo something but you ask other people\nabout it first mm-hmm\ncan you can you help me understand that\na little bit so I think like the second\nsomething pops into my mind like oh this\nsounds interesting to me I'll like tell\nsomeone and I think not because I'm\nexcited about it maybe that's part of it\nbut more maybe I want to see what they\nthink about it if that makes sense\nyeah why do you do that honestly\nprobably to searching for like approval\nto make me feel good about it that's\nfantastic\nyeah that's the right answer so the next\nquestion is what is it that makes you\nfeel like you need other peoples I've\nasked you this before he said that has\nsomething to do with prior romantic\nrelationships right yeah and my parents\nyeah so and yeah and that's common by\nthe way so if you guys have Tiger yeah\nlike you have Tiger parents no no my mom\nyeah\nis it is it okay if I ask some questions\nabout your relationship with them tell\nus about your mom now we are doing the\npsychiatry not really like puts the\ngoals on me but um I'm into this before\nI think I don't remember if it was in\nthis interview but she really only cares\nabout my appearance and how our\nappearances to other people if N says\nbut I think very common in Texas yeah I\ncould I mean I say I could care less and\nthere's definitely a little part of me\nthat just like cares because that's kind\nof how I was like brought up but in\ngeneral I tried to not care about that\nbecause it just makes me not happy but\num yeah and she puts goals on me and\nlike then doesn't really offer any\nemotional help if that makes sense like\nshe tries to offer you know like\nfinancial or like physical help or\nanything like that but whenever it comes\nto like like I could probably do that on\nmy own you know like for example if I\nmove into a new place she will try to\ncome over every week to like organize\nthings for me I'm like I can organize\nthings like I don't need your help\nlike something like that just very\noverbearing but my dad um I'm sorry go\nahead what do you need her help with\nwell I think now I kind of just like try\nto like go away because there's no sense\nof boundaries there so I just don't want\nto like put myself through the stress of\nit um but I think I'm more wish that\nthere was more emotional like nurturing\nwhen I was younger that make sense I\nthink that would have helped with yeah\nwhat when you say there you wish there\nwas more emotional nurturing what do you\nmean by that what do you wish she did I\nthink that's the long answer um I'm\ntrying to give example would like small\nthings I guess like like I mentioned now\nshe would help with anything like\nfinancially or physically but whenever I\nguess it came to me making my own\ndecisions or having my own opinions\nabout things or even just like speaking\nabout things like I wasn't allowed to\nyeah I would allow that like think on my\nown like it wasn't what she thought it\nwasn't right yeah yeah so it sounds like\nshe doesn't believe in opinions it's\njust it's all fact right right yeah and\nso feral that's that's great that yeah I\nthink it's really awesome that you're\nyou know you've started to really\nunderstand this because you know that\nhappens a lot when like when you have\nsomeone who doesn't allow you to express\nyour opinions mm-hmm then you end up\nsort of needing approval because you\ndon't learn how to express your opinions\nyou don't learn how to be confident in\nwhat you believe in yeah and it sounds\nlike she also had a lot of expectations\nI'm just wondering is there any chance\nwe're like shooting you in the foot\nbecause this is like being streamed on\nthe internet and you know okay but she's\nvery disapproving of streaming so yeah\nwhy this well I think literally the only\nreason is\nbecause of how it would look to other\npeople because whenever I first told her\nabout it she was like okay that's cool\nand then I think she told some about it\nand they maybe had a bad reaction and\nthen after that it's just been like you\nneed to quit like this is stupid\nstop doing it everyone like everyone\nhates it like you're so sad for keep\nkeeping on doing it so who's everyone\nin everyone hates it like my family or\nshe'll like she'll bring my dad's\nopinions into it about oh he hates it so\nmuch like it's so sad that you're doing\nit regardless of what he thinks or\nwhatever but so I don't I've talked to\nhim one-on-one like he's like you know I\njust want you to be safe like he's just\nscared about the you know sort of what's\nthat even called the swatting or stuff\nlike that yeah so yeah that that's\nactually a real concern so right again\nwe're being saying like I yeah I totally\nunderstand that but no that's not what\nshe really I mean I'm sure she concerned\nabout that too but you can tell me a\nlittle bit about your dad yeah so um he\nwe have conflicting opinions sometimes\nbut we both respect those so you guys\ndisagree right right so we can talk\nabout things and him be like oh no I\ndon't think that and I'll be like well I\ndon't think that remember he's like okay\nlaughs end of the day we're still gonna\nget along it's not gonna cause an\nargument so yeah what do you think\nCarole who said yeah I think so I guess\nI guess sahil had a question that that\ndomination time asked his cat's mother\nprojecting her opinions on others what\ndo you think yeah for sure like it's to\nthe extent where my grandparents weren't\nallowed to talk to me because she didn't\nwant them to because they were allowing\nme to have my own opinions like that's\nalso crazy saying it now that's why I'm\nlaughing but it's just like yeah that\nway so it sounds like your mom is very\ncontrolling oh yeah for sure so I think\nI think I so when your mom comes to you\nand says everyone will think less\nyou if you stream mm-hmm do you think\nthat that's her opinion or is that is\nshe projecting her opinion on other\npeople ooh that's hard it's hard for me\nto get into what she thinks I guess like\nI she react so differently to so many\nsituations I can't tell you probably\nlike I have no idea yeah so um my so\nwhen I work with I'm not gonna ask you\nwhere you're from but I think I may know\njust based on the cultures of different\ncities in Texas\nso you know there's one city in Texas in\nparticular that people are very very\nimage conscious there's a lot of old\nmoney there and one of the things that I\nnoticed about you know a lot of people\nwho have kind of opinions about what\nother people think is it's not so much\nthat\nso is she projecting her opinions on\nother people that's possible the other\nthe other possibility is that actually\nher opinion of herself is based upon the\nreflection of others that's I think so\nI'd say in a funny way it's the opposite\nthat it's not that she's projecting her\nopinion it's that if other people have\nthis opinion she's gonna own it because\nthat's real right right so so the funny\nthing about we you know we started this\ntalk by talking about authenticity\nmm-hmm how authentic is your mother\n0% exactly ya know so now Farrell let me\nask you another question\num how can you guys hear the air\nconditioner by the way that does it\nsound okay okay I came feral um how much\nhow happy is your mom ooh\nwell to other people she's very happy\nbut in reality I don't think I don't\nthink so yeah right yeah I mean she\ncan't be like I don't think happy person\nto act like that so yeah yeah and so I\nthink the really scary thing is that you\nknow you have a little bit of your\nmother inside you right yeah yeah and\nunfortunately huh yeah where do you see\nit come out\nor do you notice it luckily I don't\nnotice it like a lot but definitely\nwhenever I'm worried about like\nappearance and what other people think\nfor sure yeah I'm slightly yeah sorry\nand that's the kind of thing that's\nactually like unfortunately that to a\ncertain degree Ferrell is baked into you\nnow yeah sure and I think that you know\nit's funny because the struggle that you\nhave with streaming is probably the\nstruggle she has every day in her life\nmm-hmm\nright where where it's it's far more\nnebulous but like she's concerned about\nhow it's going to make you look mm-hmm\nif you're someone who streams and like I\ndon't understand what her impression of\nthat is is she shared with you what that\nis or is it like a it's like a boogie\nmonster that's unformed and well I can\nnever get a straight answer out of her\nlike if I ask anything there's never a\nstraight answer it's always I'm right\nbecause of this like there's no actual\nanswer there's no talking about feelings\nit's like my opinions right because I'm\nright like and when you ask her for a\nstraight answer what's an example of a\nquestion um well I think left side\nactually went over my parents house and\nI was just like mentioning that I kind\nof wanted to pursue like piei again and\nyou think that's something would make\nsomeone happy right but it turned into\nan argument because I wasn't going to go\nabout it the exact way that she wanted\nme to so I went down to something as\nsimple as like oh I'm gonna email this\nperson today\nyou know oh don't evoke them till Monday\nit's rude to email on the weekend I'm\nlike what okay\nI well that's what I said I was like I'm\ngoing to pay them money I don't think\nthey care when I email like but she was\nlike oh no like it's not right I turned\ninto this huge argument like I don't\nknow why that should ever turn into an\nargument but I'm pretty stubborn too so\nI just kind of like stood like a peasant\nI should probably just kind of like walk\naway from the situation but I don't know\nif I would advocate for that but yeah so\nI mean it just sounds incredibly\nfrustrating to try to like have a\nrelationship with your mom for sure\nbecause my dad's like oh that's great\nlike anything we can do to help you know\nI'm like awesome like I think she I\ndon't know if it's a common age and her\nthinking I'm not capable of actually\ndoing\nmyself and also she thinks it's not able\nto be done in a way of it's not what she\nwants it to be done what is that like\nfor you very frustrating like I know\nthat I'm capable of doing it like\nwithout her help even like it's nice and\nI ain't like the help but she also like\nkind of uses the fact that she helps me\nas a means of I shouldn't ever be mad\nanything she does so yeah so it sounds\nlike she uses her support is ammunition\nmm-hmm yeah that's tonight sometimes\nit's almost like a nice doing it to get\nback at me when you're here\nyeah right so she she uses the fact that\nshe helps you to invalidate other things\nthat you want to do how does that feel\num frustrating as well but also just\nlike disappointing I don't know what's\ndisappointing about it I think it's just\nthat I the other people's mom support\nthem like no never like I guess until I\nfeel like I would no matter what for\nsure yeah your your support sounds very\nconditional right\nyeah that that sounds can I cuss on\nstream okay so that sounds [ __ ] awful\nI mean I felt like awful just doesn't do\nit justice yeah yeah I'm so sorry yeah I\nknow it's a it's okay but I kind of\nthought so it's not really okay yeah\ngood yeah so that that's great so so you\nknow that you know what you did just\nthat right there like that's actually\nbeautiful did you notice what you did\nyeah so so I think that the part of\nthere's a part of you that's your mom\nthat would tell everyone it's okay right\nright to keep up appearances because\nlike demonstrating any kind of\ndifficulty or pain or suffering or that\nthings are not perfect is completely\nunacceptable\nand and I think you just you just grew a\nlittle bit there you grew a little bit\nlike you sort of freed yourself a little\nbit from her shadow by sort of saying\nactually it's not okay yeah and\nsometimes things in life are just\nthey're just bad yeah you know and it\nsounds like your mom in a lot of ways is\nactually like a wonderful and supportive\nperson like I mean I feel like it's kind\nof turning into a bashing session but\nbut I mean it does sound like she\nfinancially supports you and she tries\nto you know be there for you in her own\nway and I have no doubt that in some\npart of her mind she thinks that she's\nreally looking out for you yeah I think\nso because she grew up with like her mom\nwas like that too but like a lot worse I\nthink according to like my dad at least\nyou know I wasn't there witnesses so I\ndon't know but um yeah and so I think\nthat may be the only way she knows how\nto support so like not justifying it but\nat the same time if she's ever taught\nbetter like or tried to know better how\nwould you really know yeah so you're\nit's good that you're not justifying it\nwhat are you doing do you know um I\nthink I'm just trying to make it like\nbearable yeah so I think in the way that\nyou're doing that is by trying to\nunderstand it mm-hmm oh yeah for sure\nlike if I don't try to understand I'll\njust get pissed off like yeah yeah so I\nthink you know federal we've kind of\ncovered a lot of ground today it's\ngotten all over the place yeah I'm just\nkind of wondering you know let's just\npause for a second and think a little\nbit about how we want to spend time like\ndo you want to see if people have\nquestions or I mean I can keep going if\nyou want to keep going or we can sort of\ncall it and kind of talk about things or\nthe things that we haven't gotten to\nwhat do you think honestly it's up to\nyou okay um I guess I'll I'll start\nasking people you know if they have\nquestions oh I see H man's 13 was saying\nthat we should talk about positives yeah\nwe did that I think I don't know if that\nwas right around the time but so you\nknow if people have questions feel free\nto ask them and I guess I'll keep on and\nthen we'll\ncheck-in in about two or three minutes\nokay sure so I think go for it kanga\nokay great so Farrell um how do you\nthink about like what do you think about\nso it's September right so you're in\nundergrad I'm assuming yes okay and so\nwhat are you what are you thinking about\nthis next year a lot the past few days\njust kind of what I need to do to get\nmyself back on track to kind of go to PA\nschool so it's gonna be a long road but\nI'm willing to fix the mistakes that I\nmade so yeah we're trying and what\nmistakes have you made definitely my D\npayslip and how kept up how far has it\nslipped I mean in my eyes it's really\nbad because I know I could have done\nbetter but I'm not like a 2.8 2.9 right\nnow which is bad in the medical field\nyeah absolutely yeah yeah so about to\nretake some classes and luckily I've\nkept up with like shadowing and I work\nin a physician's office so I get a lot\nof the hands-on contact with patients\nyeah so that's good I I'd say you know\nkeep keep plugging away at it you know\nif I can offer a little bit of advice\njust keep keep at it\nso I it took me so I graduated with a\n2.5 or 2.6 GPA that are just colossal II\nfailing for two years and it took me\nthree years of applying and not getting\ninto medical school to finally get in\nbut you know I stuck with it and I\nencourage you to do so I think you're so\nago I would have just quit as soon as it\ngot hard but now it's like okay well\nit's gonna be hard but that's okay so\nwhat's what's changed I think in knowing\nwhy I want to do it and that I've tried\nother things and I keep coming back to\nit and that's what I want to do and like\nI'm trying to move my stubbornness\naround in a good way\nyeah so where I'll keep being stubborn\nabout not\nquitting versus being stubborn about\ntrying again I guess that's what I was\nkind of like oh well I already gave up\non it so there's no point in trying\nagain you know yeah that's great so you\nknow you call it stubborn I'm gonna give\ntoss out another word resilient yeah\nthat sounds like a really resilient sir\nyeah yeah you know it's funny because we\nyou know we use words like stubborn like\nso what's the difference between\nstubborn and perseverant do you know\nabsolutely so what I learned a couple\nyears ago is when I was applying and\nfailing to get into medical school year\nafter year people would tell me that I\nwas stubborn and that I should do\nsomething else after I actually got in\nthey called me perseverant right so I\nthink stubborn is what people call you\nwhile you're failing and persevering is\nwhat they call you after you've\nsucceeded but it's basically the same\nthing so I'd say stick with it I think\nwe have a one question that I saw that\nwhoop Allah asked and you know\ncompletely fine if this feels off-limits\nto you Farrell so he's asking about your\nrelationships since we've been talking\nabout your mom and dad already I'm\nassuming he means romantic relationships\nright so he's actually my boyfriend oh\nso okay how are how are your\nrelationships okay so I think he's\nsaying it as a joke but we can\ndefinitely ask questions if you want\nyeah so you mentioned something about\nyou know sort of a lack of confidence\nthat had to do with your upbringing in\nyour relationships what what impact have\nyour relationships had on your\nconfidence currently a good one I've\nonly had two relationships so the first\none not good at all I think he was very\nvery very similar to my mom with like\nwhat he would tell me I guess kind of\nlike make me feel less than yeah so that\nI think I was also a fourteen to like\ntwenty whenever I dated him so that's\njust I feel like a time of like a lot of\ndevelopment and here not all through\nthat been difficult for sure yeah sounds\nrough though yeah I think one of the\nscariest things you know you know a lot\nof times when\nwe're developing we're just you know\nwe're more you know you think about like\nif you're putting together I can't even\nthink of a good analogy but like just\nwhile we're developing we're kind of\nreally malleable and a lot of the things\nthat were exposed to yeah\nreally stick with us way longer than\nthey would have F afterward kind of\nreformed right you know now I feel like\nI was told to you know thing now I just\nfeel like like what's wrong with you\nlike leave me alone you know yeah\nthen it was like I didn't even know it\nwas wrong I guess so what do you think\nit was that that caused you to stay in\nthe relationship for so long\num I think definitely I was like\nmanipulated into I think you know you\ncan be told that you're not good enough\nbut until they break you down to the\npoint where you believe it\nthat's when you start saying I think\nthat was very easy to give me that point\nbecause our so young so yeah was he\nolder no a mage but he had older\nsiblings that kind of like well only one\nof them um that kind of taught him I\nguess like not directly but he saw it\nthere other people yeah I mean it's so\nis it fair old I'm a little bit confused\nyou're smiling like why are you like\nthis is awful\nyeah I think I just talked about it so\nmuch at this point that it's almost like\nhumorous to me that I wouldn't even let\nmyself go through that yeah yeah why do\nyou think it's humorous\nI would just never let myself do that\nnow you know yeah I think it's almost\nlike crazy that I did then but I don't\nwant to blame myself for it like I\ndidn't know any better\nyeah so yeah sounds like you have you've\ndone a lot of growing yes yeah\ndefinitely yeah I think you know\nsometimes the the only thing that we can\ndo is laugh yeah when things get really\nreally awful I was thinking a little bit\nabout I don't know if you guys have seen\nand maybe I'm opening a Pandora's box\nhere but Dave Chappelle recently had a\nNetflix special that is very offensive\nto many people the funny thing is that\nover the last 10 days I'd say like 20 to\n25\nnone of my patients have brought up his\nlike comedies like special or whatever\nreason yeah and I think one of the\ninteresting things so one thing that one\nperson said who's been through a lot of\nabuse is that he was kind of saying that\nyou know if you look at it like all of\nthe traditionally best comedians like if\nyou look at like in the kind of heyday\nof comedy they were all like minorities\nwho were oppressed and abused and it's\nall like Jewish people and black people\nlike early on like we're talking like\nRichard Pryor Eddie Murphy you know I\nmean this is like before even my time\nbut and I think we were talking a lot\nabout how sometimes like humor is just\nwhat we have right when things are good\nbecause it's like your choice between\nlaughing and crying yeah that's great\nokay so I think you know unless you have\nother any questions for me Farrell I\ndon't know um we've talked a lot so I\ndon't think I do have any guys in Bakula\nyeah what was your impression of like\nthis past um I guess we've been talking\nabout for about 45 minutes like had it\nhad that feel for you good like I may\nhave felt a little bit nervous at first\nbut I definitely don't feel nervous at\nall now yeah and it was really like\nhelps helpful for sure definitely\nhelpful helpful know how I think I\ndidn't like get into my own emotions and\ndon't really realize what's causing them\nand so whenever I'm steered in the right\ndirection of figuring them out it's\nhelpful to me it just understand yeah i\ni'm i'm glad that you that was your\nimpression because so first of all i\nthink you're great at this whatever this\nis because i think you know I think\nyou've done a lot of like like thinking\nthrough things and and working through\nthings kind of on your own which shows\nyeah I also think you have a couple of\nreally important you've made a couple of\nimportant transformations which I don't\nthink you kind of realized and I think a\nlot of people need to make and I think\nyou're on a good path you know if\nthere's any way that I can support you\nhave my contact info or whatever so yeah\nno I mean I work with a bazillion it\nsounds like you know people in the\nmedical field\nyes but you know if you ever have\nquestions or you know want me to review\na personal statement or anything like\nthat just know let me super helpful um I\nI work with a lot of uh I think what are\nyou know it's funny I don't know their\ntwitch names but I work with a lot of\ngamers who are interested in going into\nmedicine okay it which is just I guess\nthe people who are interested in going\ninto medicine are the ones that are try\nhard enough to to reach out to me but\nyou know so I I think I think you're on\na good path and if I can support you in\nsome way let me know\num and then I think we'll maybe take any\nany closing thoughts from your chat\neither one thank you thank you\nyeah yeah and you know if you wanna like\nI'd love to check in with you again down\nthe road whenever you feel comfortable\nor if you know if something if some of\nthese thoughts or feelings arise again\nlike if you get start to get wrapped up\nin streaming or find yourself like you\nknow starting to be concerned about how\nyou're judged is that to by the way that\nwhole streaming conversation that's your\nmom like you got that right Yeah right\nso it's all about and that's what\nhappens is like we now have a system\nwhere your mom is like operating based\non like facial expressions and tone but\nnow we can actually stick a number on\nyour value in society right and so it\ncan be really hard if you sort of if\nyou've been taught that and a lot of\nwhat we're taught is based on what we\nsee growing up like you just think about\nthis I don't know if I mean I have kids\nso I think I'm older than most of people\non Twitch but like the crazy thing is if\nyou just like look at kids like kids\njust like they just learn language they\ndon't have to be taught language right\nright they just learn how to talk yeah\nso we learned so much about who we are\nlike how we operate based on how like\nbehavior is modeled like my kid was was\ntelling one of her teddy bears this\nmorning that she was getting irritated\nwith it and was about to lose her temper\nright and like where did she learn how\nto say that it was because my mom I mean\nwowthat's Freudian my wife my wife was\nlike like saying the same thing at her\nbecause she wasn't like eating her\noatmeal like she had asked for oatmeal\nand was like so you know we pick up a\nlot from our parents and I think that a\nlot of what you've picked up I think you\npicked it up from your mom and at the\nsame time you know that can have value\nbecause one of the things that we forget\nis that just because something causes\nyou suffering doesn't mean that it isn't\na positive trait in society so your\nmom's like social awareness is probably\nreally important for her status and the\nkinds of relationships she builds and\nonce again I'm making an assumption\nabout where you're from in Texas but I\nknow that there's a certain amount of\nyou know social intelligence that is\nreally important in running in certain\ncircles um so you know thank you for\nsharing all that stuff I think you're on\nan awesome part of your journey and I\nthink it's awesome that you've adopted a\nmore action orientation where you're\njust kind of saying like [ __ ] it like\nI'm gonna do what I'm gonna do and I'm\ngonna do the best that I can and I'm a\nkind of screw-up it may not be perfect\nbut hopefully that's okay and you'll\nsurvive I mean and thanks a lot alright\nthank you\ntake care\n[Music]\nyou"
