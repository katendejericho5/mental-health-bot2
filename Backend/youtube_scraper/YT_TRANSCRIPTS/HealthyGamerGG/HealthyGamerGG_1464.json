    "transcript": "so now we're going to get started so\nwe'll just start with the list so\nkangaroo we were talking a little bit so\nI guess let's just start with this or\nyou dating someone right now no not\ncurrently\nokay and is that how do you feel about\nthat kind of sucks okay yeah that's a\nvery honest answer what sucks about it\nI think it's that\n[Music]\nmy days I'm spending either working\nlearning something studying\nit's kind of like always doing something\nalone huh even when I'm you even I'm\nworking it's usually things like I'm\nfollowing a doctor around or I'm seeing\na patient but it's still just me hmm on\nmy own doing all that come home and I\nstudy every room alone you know get\nonline I'm still alone in the room even\nif I talk to friends or something like\nthat still mean on my own okay so and\nI've never had that experience of like\nhaving a real girlfriend but I always\nseeing people you know really seem to\nenjoy it\nthere's kind of that I do not feel like\nI'm missing something out but not and\nand so it I mean it sounds like most of\nwhat you feel is lonely yeah yeah and so\nwhat do you think it is that's gotten in\nthe way of you finding kind of what you\nsee other people have\nI always thought it was just kind of\nwhere I was hmm\nat Rice back when I'm in college that\nwas definitely gaming but to my way to\nminigames and aqua did not meet anyone\nhmm\nafter that it was just mostly just felt\nlike work you know once I got into the\nmaster's program into med school it's\nlike I didn't have time even consider\nanything we're all so I fell out of\nclasses just oh it was tough yeah yeah I\nmean I think um you know that's really\ntrue at school is pretty intensive do\npeople date in med school they do yeah\nokay how does that work and no idea yeah\nit's kind of interesting right I mean\nyou're saying that here you are in med\nschool and it's like it's hard right\nthey can learn a lot and the pace is\nreally intense and so if we kind of\nthink a little bit about what is it that\nprevents you from dating your answer as\nwell I work too much but then there's a\npart of me that kind of pauses and\nthinks about that because you know a lot\nof people work a lot right and they find\nrelationships I think the way I see it\nusually is that\nin med school you either come in with a\nrelationship that you continue or you\nfind one within your own class listens\nwith other doctors or maybe we meet on\nthe job mmm\nI just didn't think I found anyone like\nthat okay so you haven't found the right\nperson yeah\nso when you're thinking about having a\nrelationship your idea is that basically\nsomeone is going to come along and then\nit's gonna click not exactly not what\nkind of I guess I think it's the idea\nthat\nI have to meet multiple people but there\nwill be someone there will be some\npeople have mesh with a lot more than\nother people I said meant a lot of those\ntypes eeeh\nokay so you just haven't been able to\nmeet someone that you mesh with yes okay\nwhy do you think that is\nwhat goes into meeting people at measure\nnew things that the way that other\npeople will be doing at the same time\nokay you do that I started to like what\nconventions which con coming up anime\nconventions gaming conventions also\nputting a lot more Medical conventions\nagain travel for fourth year and meeting\ndifferent people interpret hospitals has\nbeen and other medical students outside\nof my own class hmm I think that's been\nactually helping a lot when was the last\ntime you asked someone out actually how\ncan you tell us a little bit about that\nwell interesting laughs it wasn't I\ndidn't expect to ask them out on a date\nuh-huh it just felt like after the night\nwas over we did end up going out okay\nyeah wheel 2 movie went to dinner hang\nout for a bit and after than I was over\nI looked back I was like telling a\nfriend of mine okay I'm at school person\noh so you went on a date and it kind of\nwent oh yeah I went on a date did you\nask her out\nI asked her to go hang out but I didn't\nask her as like as specifically as a\ndate okay I just didn't think of that\ndink oh no I was like hey you want to go\nhang out for a bit what makes you think\nthat was a day um I think it was\nmaybe just how much I enjoyed it how\nmuch and like how seem like we both\nenjoyed it we wanted to hang out again\nis dear so I could but so you're gonna\nsee her again\nI don't know if she's in San Antonio\nokay it'll be depending on how the next\ncouple weeks ago so I'm curious um you\nknow just just twitch that chat think\nthat that qualifies as a date or not\nlet's see so let's kind of come back to\nso you I mean but you're saying that you\nkind of didn't really ask her out right\nwell I'll just you just asked to hang\nout yeah so unclear whether it was a\ndate or not a date so sometimes when it\ncomes to finding a romantic partner like\nit can be sometimes I think a big piece\nof it is not understanding exactly what\nyour relationship is with other people\nlike in terms of his dating or not they\nagree as friends photonic are you\ngetting friend-zoned that is hard to fry\nit's hard for me to hear I've never been\nable to get that distinction unless I'm\nvery explicit about it okay and usually\nthat's never turned out positively for\nme\nlook if I have someone hey do you want\nto go on a date they're gonna pause in\nresponse for that uh-huh\nhow many times have you asked but okay\nand so you know I would think that if\nsomeone has been we're just talking\nabout negative emotion yeah if you put\nyourself out there and you've gotten\nburned five times that it would make it\nvery hard for you to ask a sixth girl\nout on it it definitely should be looked\nat yeah I think the more that I start\nrealizing I don't I want a relationship\nand I'd only care if someone says no\nbecause I can try it again it's the more\nI'm starting to do it more ask more\npeople out like I think it was high\nschool asked up two people two girls\ndidn't go well at all\nI didn't ask anyone until my master's\nprogram because it's five years later\nokay\nthat didn't wind up working out and then\nthe next time I did it was my first year\nof medical school\nafter that I think about a big one\nhow did you feel about the one in\nthat one harshly worked out we semi\ndated for a bit and I got cheated on so\nthat didn't work out very well so ya\nknow the reason I asked that question\nand so this is great that this is on\ncamera I wish we could rewind on twitch\nchat and your facial expression was\nsubtly very very different okay for the\none in that school so like the system so\nI I think you know I wonder if there's\nvalue in sort of going back and\nrewinding and even cutting but I want\nyou to watch it okay there's just a tiny\ntiny flicker of something that suggested\nthat that one was more emotionally\npainful\nmmm-hmm so if you got cheated on I guess\nthat make sense it was not good yeah so\nand and so okay so you've asked out a\ncouple of girls so I think one of the\nthings that could be kind of I mean I\nI'm kind of curious about is we think\nabout you know what happened in high\nschool you asked about two girls like\nwhat do you think it was that kept you\nfrom asking out girls in college\ngirls ecologist I just seemed oh I'd\nmeet any I was playing video games\nold-time friends yeah so I think that's\na typical answer that is probably a\nlittle bit incorrect that my members do\nright so what I'm imagining is like so\nlet's assume I mean maybe you didn't go\nout and meet idea I'm sure you gained a\nlot when I was gaming a lot in college\ndo I still ask out girls and got her job\ndid a fair amount I mean they're\neverywhere\nright like you're going to class and\nthey're a girl writer and you could have\nasked them out\nyeah if I guess I waited I don't I don't\nbuy that over four years of college you\ndid not encounter and have interactions\nwith girls that you did not find\nattractive\nI did but I remember there were three\ngirls callers I found attractive all my\nboyfriend's couldn't really ask them out\nokay so just to kind of think through\nthis a little bit like so in medicine\nyou know we talked about differential\ndiagnosis right so it's if there's a\nparticular symptom what are all the\nthings that could be causing the symptom\nso in this case I'm just thinking a\nlittle bit about the symptom of not\nasking anyone out in college so so far\nwe've gotten two answers right because\nthe first one I push back on and now\nSimon tells us oh it wasn't so the first\nhis first answer was oh I didn't have\ntime to ask any when I was playing too\nmany videos and when I press you your\nanswer changes sure do you guys see that\nlike you see that how that happened so\nand his answer is oh I I wanted to ask\nthem out but they had boyfriends so I\ndid now that's like a very different\nanswer it's not that I wasn't attracted\nto people oh yeah it's that they weren't\navailable but the what you tell us and\nprobably seduce them to be what you tell\nyourself is that it's because they it's\nbecause I was playing - in video games\nand so the interesting thing is that you\nknow I see this a lot with gamers when I\nsort of we start to dig in and kind of\nreally think a little bit about dating\nand why you ask girls out why or you\nknow the case it sounds like it's\nsclusively girls um but when you're sort\nof interested in someone and like we\ncome up with answers but I would imagine\nI can just like put myself in in my own\nshoes and just thinking a little bit\nabout you know if I asked two girls out\nin high school like high school is a\npretty pretty psychologically fragile\ntime and you know if I'm asking two\ngirls out and they say no I think it's\ngonna be very difficult from a\nconfidence perspective to be able to ask\ngirls out in college like it's gonna\ntake time or energy or effort or\nsomething is really gonna have to change\nfor me to overcome that huh\nand the really tricky thing about that\nis that I'm not getting that sense for\nme like I'm not getting any I mean\nwhether it was true or not true in your\ncase we're not really sure but what I'm\ndefinitely not getting is any awareness\nof that fact right that that what it was\nis maybe a lack of confidence like there\nwere three girls you were trying\ndo you know it's you know not to say\nthat you should try to interfere with\nsomeone's relationship but sometimes\npeople ask out people who are in\nrelationships yeah right and I'm not I'm\nnot trying to put a value judgment on\nwhether that's a good idea or a bad idea\num but maybe it's disrespectful but so\nit's kind of interesting and then the\nother thing that I kind of want to\nfast-forward to is you said something\npretty interesting which is that like\nrecently you stopped caring and you\nshould share a little bit about that I\nthink it's it goes to the competence\nidea um I feel like I'm at a point where\nI guess I'm a good catch is why well I'm\nin my mind I'm pretty decent catching up\npretty good pretty good guy overall\ndecent education decent background good\nreally nice family\nvery nice oh sorry definitely so I just\nI don't feel like\nI don't feel like anyone would be\nmissing anything\ndating me yes\nyou guys notice how he didn't comment on\nhis physical appearance\nso so what we can imply from that is\nthat you may be he may have some\nconcerns about his physical and it's\nright because when when kangaroo is\ntalking about why he's a catch he\ndoesn't say anything about its physical\nappearance\nhow did you sit thing down a lot really\nbut I didn't have a great self-image\nI think it's been improving that's\nprobably not where I want you to be good\nso the other thing is would you feel\ncomfortable talking about that or is\nthat yeah what do you think about how\nyou look\nhonestly I think I'm a little overweight\nfrom playing around in the face little\npushier that I'd like to be then I used\nto be\nI think that's the main main idea okay\nand\nwhat do you say used to be so view is\nthere been some since there's been a\nchange do you feel like that's come with\na change in your confidence too\nI'm actually not sure\n[Music]\nmost of the change happen second to\nthird year college so I'm not I think I\nalready had some poppin issues that then\nthat weren't related to the way it\nlooked and they may be evolved into or\nmaybe\nthe lock was pulled into that eventually\nyeah so you know that's a really\ninteresting idea\nbecause you're almost suggesting that\nlack of confidence is the origin and it\nkind of it's almost like a monster that\nlike gobbled some concerns around your\nappearance and so it's not necessarily\nthat your appearance leads to a lack of\nconfidence it's that your lack of\nconfidence is almost like this\npsychological entity within you that\nlatches on to your appearance and that's\nactually a really common way that the\nmind works is that we tend to have\nfeelings and then what happens is our\nfeelings will come up for justifications\nto make them feel more real so for\nexample you know there's some people\nthat I work with that are quite\nattractive but feel like they're not\nattractive at all and what happens is\nthey'll zero in on the tiniest most\nirrational thing about their appearance\nbecause and it doesn't matter how much\nyou argue with them and you can say like\noh yeah your nose looks fine it's not\ntoo big it's not too small as fine yeah\nand that doesn't that doesn't enter into\nthem if it doesn't like coat so kind of\nsink into their head in any way in my\nyou know a lot actually I get that a lot\nfrom my sister what do you get from that\nshe's like oh well I hate taking\npictures of myself I hate being in\npictures I don't like having things\ntaken to me and it's usually because\nlike you know I don't think I look good\nin pictures yeah like I don't think I\nlook like on video sometimes and I gain\nfrom I say she's like no you're you're\ndecent looking guy before how do you\nkeep worrying about that so you know you\nlook fine stop it yeah no I promise they\ntell me that like I understand out like\na rational level but I don't get it\nyou just it doesn't take in yes so on\nwhat level do you not get it's emotional\nright\ncase in point yeah so this is where the\ntricky thing is that you know we've\ntalked a little bit about like rational\nversus emotional so now I think we're\ngoing a little bit off topic but\nhopefully this is okay so now the\nquestion becomes okay so like you don't\nfeel so speaking of what let me just tie\nthings together so I do believe that\npart of the reason that you have not\nasked out girls is because you're\nconcerned about your appearance right\nand I think that like the more we talk\nabout it the more clear it seems to me\nyeah that you're concerned about your\nappearance and the funny thing is you've\nmade lots of like rationalizing\nstatements like you've said like oh yeah\nyou know I listen used to look better\nbut I would guess that even if I had\ntalked to you when you cornered what\nlooked better that you probably felt the\nsame way that you do now that material\nyeah so the interesting thing is that if\nwe really pause and look at that even\nthough there was an objective difference\nin the way that you look you're feeling\nabout the way you look is exactly the\nsame okay\nso now we come to another problem that a\nlot of gamers add which is that you know\nyou think that there's a problem which\nis that you don't look good enough and\nso you try to improve your appearance\nand there's definitely value to working\nout and taking care of yourself as a\nconfidence booster but I would argue\nthat the root of the problem actually\nhas nothing to do with the way you look\nbut has more to do with the way you feel\nyou look\nyeah\nand so then the question becomes okay so\nlike if we can see that what do we do\nabout\nI've been pretty much telling myself\nit's not true over and over again how's\nthat working for you it's hopping a\nlittle bit okay hopping that's why I've\nbeen able to ask more people at\nessentially the more times I'm like up\nstopping you're being dumb like every\ntime that thought entered my head\nI think it's weird because sometimes\nit's like yeah that is like you know I'm\na lot flatter than easy but yeah that is\ntrue but doesn't really matter okay so\nnow there's a subtle difference in that\nstate right there's a subtle difference\nbetween arguing with yourself in terms\nof invalidating the way that you feel so\nif we think about this like let me just\ntunnel down and try to make this into\nlike a math equation from a\npsychological perspective so one is that\nI feel unattractive and then I can argue\nwith myself right I can say like oh but\nI've worked out and I like I got this\nnew shirt and I like about this like\nhundred dollar haircut you can argue\nwith yourself and that can help a little\nbit but it doesn't seem to help very\nmuch and I would argue that most people\nwho are watching sometimes have negative\nthoughts about themselves and that\nthey're actually pretty good at arguing\nagainst them but despite arguing against\nthem that they still struggle with those\nthose thoughts the interesting thing\nthough that I think the reason it's\nbecome easier for you is because\nsomewhere along the way you didn't start\nyou didn't convince yourself that you're\nwrong you stopped caring yeah right so\nif we really let tunnel down into what's\nidle I mean a kangaroo said he said I\nstopped caring or it doesn't matter it\ndoesn't matter yeah and so there's a\npart of you that's actually if you\nreally think about it like you know so\nyou didn't mention appearance when\nyou're talking about your positive\nqualities but I think somewhere along\nthe way and I'd be curious kind of how\nyou came to this conclusion and we can\nsort of see that he's come to this\nconclusion because he's started to\nrealize that like okay even if I'm not\nthe most attractive guy which he kind of\naccepts it doesn't mean that I can't\nfind a relationship that I still have a\nlot of things to offer someone I can be\nfunny I can be engaging I'm intelligent\nI'm a catch I'm doctor know so like that\napparently is supposed to attract a lot\nof women\nnot everything that's cracked up to be\ncommon as if you guys are in med school\nyou'll learn that lesson the hard way\nit's allowed to be a decent human being\nyeah and what do you think about that\nwhat do I think about what do you think\nabout like\nactually what's changed in you is not\nyour perception of how you look but that\nyou stop you sort of accepted that you\nmay not be the most attractive guy and\nit actually doesn't necessarily affect\nhow we are going to find relationship or\nwhether you're going\nI think it's been nice like it's kind of\nfreeing way just not just like its\nweight sitting on my mind anymore mm-hmm\nI mean it's still there just because I\ndo see like my best friend just got\nmarried like don't want a girlfriend\nwell thanks going on but I think it's\njust have so many things I'm doing right\nnow that are going positively I'm like\nthat I feel like it will come it will\nhappen\nokay do you think that um\nso when your girlfriend I mean when your\nyour best friend gets married and you\nkind of think to yourself I still don't\nhave a girlfriend do you also have the\nthought that maybe it's because I'm not\nattractive enough\nno not in that case room okay all right\nit's not I don't know if that would be\nis in the past not anymore\nwhat do you think it is that kinda keeps\nyou from having a girlfriend man\nI think it's just the amount of\ntraveling about to do over the last year\nand then once same city from more than\nmaybe month or two mm-hmm though if I\nmeet someone it's like yeah hey well\nhang out for a bit and then unconscious\nanother to another state sure by then I\nkeep talking them acute accent but it's\njust it doesn't feel a thing\nas you know it's an actual relationship\nyeah I mean I think that that that is\nreally hard if we really think about\nrelationships you know a lot of times\nthey have to start you can do\nlong-distance but you know usually\nthere's a pretty solid foundation before\nyou kind of transition\nI think I've just been moving around so\nmuch that even if I place I found\nsomeone Santoni I was only there for\nfour weeks and I met them the last week\nI was there at that point I was like all\nright hi nice to see you hopefully we'll\nkeep talking he's still texting with ya\nhow's that coming oh well we're both\ndoing a lot though she's on third-year\nrotations so she's always running around\nand so you know do I get texts much but\nwe do text when was it that you started\nor I guess I should say kind of stopped\ncaring as much about her\nor maybe a better way to put us when did\nit that start to impact you less in\nterms of you recognizing your value for\na relation\nprobably over the last six months\nI guess mostly after step two is over\nokay those are the real big event yes\ncan you explain a little bit about what\nstep two so step two is our second\nlicensing exam for a medical school and\nget your degree without it and one of\nthe biggest exams with my life so I\nthink yeah so I had a lot a lot of just\na tough time with that exam overall hmm\nlong I was studying you know again\nloneliness it again because in a room by\nmyself for 16 hours a day\nnot my favorite time favorite six weeks\nyeah and so it sounds like the feelings\nof loneliness were pretty Abbey burn\nduring that time step one as well but\nfirst license Museum same thing\nI think a lot of it got a little better\nduring med school because I started\nstudying with people before that I did\nlike a master's program and again I have\nthat same issue only I was studying by\nmyself\ndidn't really enjoy that\ndo you think I mean do you remember\nfeeling lonely in college\nI don't know not in college I don't know\nthat was because I was just I was like\nalways had core framework around me like\nyou know always had at least one or two\npeople around at some point or the other\nplaying video games or just hanging out\nreading or something no I don't think I\ncalled you I was probably\nso interesting right because now if we\nchild down into college a little bit\nmore it sounds like you were hanging out\nwith people yeah\nand yet I guess never encountered a girl\nit was usually the same group of people\nokay\nI didn't go a lot like club activities\nvery much I didn't do a lot of sports in\ncollege\nI went to classes most of the time\nsample since I went four of us well I\ndidn't look I didn't go to parties I\ndidn't really was a big drinker I didn't\nlike those big big parties\nyou think that not being a big drinker\nhis impact of your ability to find\nI never really considered how important\nin any way I enjoy may become lots of\nred wine so I don't really if someone's\nnot okay if someone has problem with not\ndrinking I feel like that's already\nsomeone I'm not going to be yeah with\ngeneral sure so what was it that changed\nafter step two that sort of started to\nstop I mean you felt like you had no\nvalue like you got a confidence\nI think it was that like I had career\nbath I had a goal and I have stuff I'm\nworking towards and there's nothing\nthat's gating me from that anymore\nI'm not kid anymore I don't think that\nwas the biggest things like I will have\na good decent career you know I can make\nmy own success from here on and I'm not\nworried I'm worried about\nto support basic sporty muscle okay so\nit sounds like you got some degree of\nIndependence yes Barroso and with\nindependence comes some degree of like\nconfidence in who you are as a person\num yeah so I mean I think that makes a\nlot of sense so let's kind of like track\nthrough and try to see what we can learn\nfrom kangaroos kind of perspective and\nexperience so the first is that you know\nkangaroo has had some feelings of\nloneliness and hasn't been able to\nreally have a serious relationship if we\nreally think it have yeah so if we if we\nthink oh man I just want to rewind I\nwish there's like no because I was\nfrustratingly it was during the odd one\na polygon midterm exams - huh it was\nright after spring break or during\nspring break we were fine until spring\nbreak she went abroad found some guy\nthere I didn't hear about this for four\nweeks afterwards like cake she came back\nignored me for my three weeks I was like\nwhat the heck's going on like I don't\nhave no idea what just happened and I'm\nhere for week sent from her friend that\nshe has a boyfriend that Spring Break\nand like you know it wasn't the problem\nof her getting the boyfriend I go fine\nyou know he found someone sure didn't\nwant me it was that I didn't hear for\nfour weeks she didn't have the decency\nto tell me for that long how do you feel\nabout that I think that that would that\ninfuriated me really bad infuriate yeah\nin anger anger anger right that's the\nyeah yeah and so the you know the\ninteresting thing if we're just thinking\nabout this is like right like I\npurposely have been waiting for kangaroo\nto tell me more about that relationship\nnot a ski right so like this is where\nyou know for a lot of a lot of gamers\nlike their emotions that are pent up but\nlike you know it just takes some on the\none hand it takes some amount of like\nopening up to get getting kind of a\nspace to talk about it but the other\nthing is that I actually don't have to\nask you yeah that's true it just wants\nyou know it just it just wants to come\nout and the funny thing is if we if we\ntrack back to the beginning of the\nconversation we asked and grew like why\ndon't you have a girlfriend is like oh\nI'm too busy but the truth of the matter\nis like that kind of stuff sits with you\nright like that affects like there's no\nway I mean and I hopefully the people on\nstream caught this there's like there's\nno way that that is that still yeah it\ndoes it's still e right and people can\nsee it and the crazy thing is when it\ncomes to dating\nlike you don't even you're not even\naware that that's there mm-hmm but\nthere's so much there it's like we pop\ndoes it the anger just comes right out\nand it's like it's you know this is what\nhappened in like you remember the\ndetails right she's gone for this many\nweeks three weeks she was ghosting me I\nheard from her friend that he had a boy\nlike you know you remember all the\ndetails and it's like seared in your\nmachina and that kind of stuff is gonna\naffect right it's it's gonna weigh on\nthings like your confidence yeah\nwhich then once your your feeling of\nlike lack of confidence like is there\nthen it's gonna sort of latch on to\nother things and what kind of talk a\nlittle bit more than that about you know\nhow that works in terms of your\npsychology but before I get to questions\nso let's just kind of recap you know so\nI think a couple of things for people\nwho are watching streams so the first\nthing is Kangoo thank you for for you\nknow opening yourself up in a vulnerable\nway you know if there are people who are\nwho are watching stream and want to\nshare something about their own lives\nlike we'd love to have you on you know\nit can be anonymous or whatever we can\ndo it over voice chat and if you guys\nare in the Boston area and want to come\nto my office you're welcome to do that\nso thank you very much for sharing that\nI think a couple of things that we can\njust think a little bit bit about in\nterms of what's relevant for gamers the\nfirst thing is that if we think about\nhow kangaroos mind works you know he he\ncomes up with the most sterile reason\nfirst in terms of why he doesn't have a\ngirlfriend and it's because I don't have\ntime and then you know as things kind of\nevolved we begin to see that they're\nlike different reasons why he doesn't\nhave a girlfriend there's like more to\nit right there's a sense that he's\nactually like not a catch which is\nchanging now and we'll dig a little bit\nmore into like where confidence comes\nfrom and how you get confident right\nbecause the big thing is that when you\nwere in college and like you know when\nyou were asking people out and stuff\nlike that like you weren't confident\nsomething has changed within you and the\nfunny thing is it's it's not that you\ncombated and overcame your idea that\nyou're not like you're an unattractive\ndude which is what most people think\nneeds to be done right if you think to\nyourself oh like I'm not confident\nbecause I'm unattractive the gamers\nsolution is that I need to go to the gym\nand guess who and once I'm\nlet then the women will like yeah or a\nlot of what also happens is is like\ngamers that go to play so I saw this in\nmed school where people think one time a\ndoctor once I make a ton of money like\nthe women are gonna lend it not how it\nworks not oversell and and so if we\nreally dig down into it we begin to see\nthat there's there's some degree of like\na lack of confidence and also that you\nknow there's there's some hurt right\nlike there's there's even like you can\nalmost think about it like trauma in\nterms of you know you ask someone out\nand put you put yourself out there and\nyou get burned and then if you kind of\nthink about like a behavioral\nperspective as you get burned that's\ngoing to change your behavior and you're\nnot going to ask someone out again right\nbecause you just don't want to get\nexposed to that hurt\nand the other thing that we can kind of\nthink a little bit about is he had this\nexperience where you know after all of\nlike you know lack of confidence and not\nhaving direction in life and all that\ngood stuff\nyou still managed to find someone and\nthen what's it like when you manage to\nfind someone and then they betrayed yeah\nand so that too is gonna also like I\nmean what impact do you think it has\nwhen when someone gets cheated on your\nrelationship we're sure you feel anger\nbut what do you think it does to your\nconfidence oh it takes it Thanks right\nand so the cool thing is that that\nkangaroo is sort of starting to come out\nof it in terms of starting to recognize\nthat even if he does have feelings that\nare negative towards his self-image the\nreally cool thing I think here is that\nhe somehow managed to figure out it's\nnot that he's realized that those are\nwrong it's that he's he's he's starting\nto wait those less so in the variable'\nof the equation of am i a good boyfriend\nor in my boyfriend material\nsomething has happened where kangaroo\nphysical appearance is started to become\nlike weighted less let's be kind of\nbecome a fraction of what it was\nI think it's I've seen interest in me\neven if it's people I'm not I'm not\ninterested in\nI've seen people are you know start\napproaching me more Orton or respond\nlike if I'm talking to more something\nand I think I guess it's a poem they\nactually do want to talk to me more okay\nbabe well maybe this is not so bad yeah\nI think that's so we can dig into more\nunclear whether we're doing this again\nbut we may have someone else but if\nkangaroo comes back maybe we can dig in\na little bit further into you know how\nI think the funny thing is that if you\njust look statistically people that have\nbeen expressing interest in you since\nhigh school that's just true but most\nhuman beings don't go seven or eight\nyears without no-one expressing interest\nI think what happens with a lot of\ngamers is that they're so wrapped up in\ntheir own head that they're unable to\nsee it and so I think what could be\ngoing on with you is it you know it's\nsort of like it's a little bit of like a\nchicken or the egg thing where someone\nexpresses interested in you you gain a\nlittle bit of confidence you get less\nconcerned about your appearance and then\nsince you're you know your head is less\nup your ass you're able to see that more\npeople are expressing instant"
