    "transcript": "and we had another question from Lula is\nyour experience in your experience what\nare common problems that eSports\nathletes tend to have okay so you know\non stream I work a fair amount with\nthese sports athletes and there are a\nton of them to be short I think the one\nthat I've been thinking about the most\nrecently is actually so I think a lot of\nso one huge problem is that eSports\ndoesn't have a physical limitation so\nwhat happens is like if you look at like\na professional athlete lately and say\nlike an NFL player or like a base of\nbaseball player or soccer player or\nsomething you know you can't you can't\npractice football for like more than six\nhours a day so I've also worked with\nlike NFL athletes and things like that\nand their training regimen is like you\nknow somewhere between four and eight\nhours a day because there's just\nphysical limitations of the human body\nwith eSports athletes there isn't that\nlimitation so another thing is I think\nthat eighteen year olds are just not\nlike cognitively prepared for this\ndegree of stress so a lot of times so\nthat's another big thing that that they\nface is that you know you think about it\nlike you're in high school right and\nyou're streaming a lot or you're playing\na lot of overwatch and like that's\nworking great but then suddenly you're\nin this like incident one of the things\nthat happens is when you're streaming\nand before you get a pro contract you're\nlike one of the best alright so you're\nkind of the best of the best and that's\nwhat gets you the pro contract and then\nonce you enter the actual league then\nsuddenly your average or even below\naverage and so a lot of these it's a\nhuge psychological blow to be someone\nwho is the best and then suddenly be\nlumped into people who are in like the\naverage or below average\nand that psychological blow is really\nhard to get over the funny thing is I\nhad a buddy who went to Harvard Law\nSchool and I asked him after his first\nyear like how's law school going and he\nsaid it's like it's actually kind of\nsucks I asked him like well why does it\nsuck and he says one of the cruelest\nthings you can do is to take a bunch of\npeople who think that they're\nexceptional and make them average and\nwhen you do that to people they become\nnasty and so I think eSports it's hard\nto be you know it's cool like you think\nabout like Oh being an eSports athlete\nlike it's awesome and in a lot of ways\nit is but it's really hard\npsychologically the other thing that\nhappens is that there's a lot of stress\naround job security because no one\nreally knows like you know um so I do\npeople know about you know okay so\nkangaroo had the I had the option to go\npro after college and League of Legends\nand at the same time I also had an offer\nfor better than school so I turned on\nthe contract to go pro and went to\nmedical school instead yeah so I think a\nlot of people are concerned about job\nsecurity right so this is especially\ntrue for the pro players that I work\nwith that are a little bit older like\nonce you hit 20 to 23 you know like\nafter you like if you get kicked from\nyour team then like what do you do can\nyou find a job like how does that work\nso it you know it's an emerging field\nthere's a lot of stress there's a lot of\nuncertainty about job security which can\nbe pretty stressful\nwhat about self-imposed burnout who\npossess him it seems that a lot of times\nnot just the teams that said the\nschedule but the players themselves seem\nto burn themselves out yes that was\nactually a great question because I was\nabout to segue into that I think this is\nalso something that I see with streamers\nright yeah this is not necesary pro\nplayers but the other thing that's\nhappening is like people push themselves\nand if you become a streamer there are\nall kinds of like psychological weights\nthat get put on you because when you\nwhen you become a streamer or even if\nyou become like a pro eSports\nathlete you kind of start to become\nsomeone that you're not and maintaining\nbeing someone that you normally aren't\nbecause before you go pro you really\nloved to play the game and that's the\nreason that you were playing the game\nbut let's say a year after you go pro\nyou know you're playing overwatch now\nyou've been playing overwatch for like\ntwo and a half years and maybe you want\nto stop playing over because if you\nthink about most gamers like what do you\nguys do when you want to stop playing\nthe game you stop playing a game but in\nthis case you kind of can't your tracked\nyou're stuck and when I work with\nstreamers like that's also a big problem\nis that they have invested so much and\nbuilding their stream that they feel\nlike they have to be this personality\nand they can't actually be themselves\nbecause if you start changing the\ncontent of your stream your viewers may\nleave yeah and you start to build up an\nidentity that you feel like you have to\nmaintain and that identity becomes like\na house of cards and then people just\nthey just burn out they just can't\nhandle it"
