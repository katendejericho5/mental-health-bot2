    "transcript": "my name is Alec connage and I'm a\npsychiatrist who practices in Boston\nMassachusetts in my day job I'm an\naddiction psychiatrist at a place called\nMcLean Hospital and I'm also faculty at\nHarvard Medical School where I'm an\ninstructor in psychiatry I'd like to\nshare with you guys a little bit about\nhow I got into the helping people with\nvideo game addiction and it actually\nstarts with me and when I was pretty\nyoung I grew up playing video games\nplayed a lot of video games when I was\nin Middle School in high school and\nalmost failed out of college for playing\ntoo many video games my first year of\ncollege I had less than a 2.0 GPA second\nyear wasn't a whole lot better and I I\ndid things like slept through my fan\nSpanish final because I was played\nplaying too many video games the night\nbefore and finally ended up graduating\nwith about a 2.5 or 2.6 GPA and really\nstarted to try to figure out like what\nwas going on in my life and like what\nwhat was the deal with playing all these\ngames and took me a couple of years but\nI ended up going to medical school and\nended up training to become a\npsychiatrist here in Boston at a place\ncalled Massachusetts General Hospital\nand McLean Hospital both of which are\nHarvard Medical School teaching\naffiliates and so really had some an\namazing had an amazing opportunity to\nbecome a psychiatrist had some brilliant\nteachers and I'm grateful that I was\nable to train there because they really\ntaught me a lot about psychiatry and\nhuman beings and how to help people and\nwhile I was training I I kind of went to\nthese people who were kind of the\nbrightest minds in psychiatry and like\nexperts in the field and I asked them\nyou know can you tell me a little bit\nabout video game addiction or can you\ntell me how to help people who have\nproblems with video games and none of\nthem really seem to know and the more\npeople that I ask the more I realized\nlike oh the leaders in the field of\nPsychiatry are all in their 50s 60s and\n70s and so they've actually never played\na video game you know the people that\nteach us psychiatry the people who are\nexperts in depression and anxiety and\naddictions are all sort of at the end of\ntheir career or middle of their career\nand they've actually never really played\na video game so they don't really know\nwhat it's like and so then I I was\ntrying to figure out you know how can I\nlearn about this because my teachers you\nknow they don't really know too much\nabout it and so I started just talking\nto gamers I started working with gamers\nI started talking to gamers from all\nover the world through the internet and\npeople from the Middle East and South\nKorea and North America and I just\nstarted working with them and trying to\nfigure out you know trying to understand\nwhy do you play video games and the more\nthat I understood about you know talking\nto them the more I learned about video\ngame addiction and the more that I got\nyou know the more I learned about being\na psychiatrist and how to help people I\nrealized like maybe I actually can help\nthese people because a lot of them had\nseen psychiatrists or therapists but\nwhat happens is they get diagnosed with\nsomething like depression or anxiety and\nthey get started on an antidepressant\nand they go home and they take their\npill and they keep playing video games\nbecause their problem while they are\ndepressed the problem really isn't that\nthey are depressed their problem is that\nthey play too many video games and so I\nstarted to work with these people and\ntried to help them and as the years went\nby and I worked with more and more\ngamers I started to get better at it and\nso now I feel like I know a little bit\nabout what I'm talking about but I have\nto admit that you know the disease is\nrelatively new we don't really know a\nwhole lot about it there hasn't been\nyears or decades of research the way\nthat there has been on cancer treatment\nor treatment for depression but at this\npoint I do feel confident that I can\nhelp you some or at least that's my hope\nmy hope is that I can take those years\nof experience helping gamers and helping\nparents of gamers and helping spouses of\ngamers and my years of training is a\npsychiatrist and to be able to put those\ntwo together and to help you in some way\nand I really hope that I can"
