    "transcript": "how do I know if I have a problem so or\nin parents cases like how do I know if I\ncan has a problem and the short answer\nthat I have is that if it causes a\nproblem it is a problem so if it's\naffecting me with summary then I think\nit's a problem if it's affecting your\nacademics if it's affecting your\nprofessional success if it's affecting\nyour relationships if it's affecting\nyour physical health if it's affecting\nyour mental health then it is a problem\nand in the field of Psychiatry we don't\nhave like diagnostic tests we don't do\nblood tests we don't have X have used\nsometimes to memorize and stuff but for\nthe most part like you know how do we\nknow if someone is depressed or they're\njust sad like how did you draw that line\nand the short answer is if it causes a\nproblem it is a problem if you're sad\nthat's kind of okay but if you're so sad\nthat you can't go to work if you're so\nsad that you can't you know be the\nperson that you need to be for your\nspouse or your kids then we call that\ndepression and I think the same line\nexists for videogames so I think in\nshort if you guys are seeing impacts in\nterms of your child's performance at\nschool if you're seeing impacts in terms\nof life who they are at home and this is\na common complaint that I sort of get\nfrom parents and I sometimes ask them\nwhen your child plays a video game do\nthey become someone else like do they\nget really irritable do they get super\nmoody do they become completely\ndisrespectful in a big conversation that\nI have a lot of parents is like asking\nyou know they kind of come up with\nquestion of like where did my child go\nlike that's not the kid that they were\nlike two years ago they're not your\nchild and according to come somewhere\nelse they get so engrossed in the video\ngame that they don't even seem like\nthemselves and if that's what you guys\nare facing that I definitely think it's\nproblem"
