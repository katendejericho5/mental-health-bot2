    "video_title": "What is the Gender Breakdown of Video Game Addiction? | Episode 5",
    "transcript": "the gender breakdown is more men than\nwomen but there the research is kind of\nmixed so I'd say that like if you look\nat let's say the population under 18 you\nknow I'd say that 8.4 percent of people\nunder the age of 18 maybe about 11 to 12\npercent of boys maybe like 6 to 7\npercent of women although if you look at\nother kinds of Internet related\naddictions like social media addiction\nthat is more predominant women there are\nalso breakdowns in terms of what kinds\nof games people are addicted to so women\nare more likely to spend way more time\nplaying mobile games than men are so a\nlot of this research is kind of emerging\nbut it does seem like there is kind of a\ngender gap at least in terms of men\nversus women"
