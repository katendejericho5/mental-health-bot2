    "transcript": "but if you look at society human beings\nthroughout history have valued things\nthat are difficult so like you know if\nyou meet the mayor of a city versus the\nPresident of the United States there's\npeople in general but generally speaking\nwe value people who accomplish our\nthings right and so there's something in\nour brain that gets a lot of\ngratification from completing a hard\ntask and this is what we want to do for\nour kids right we want to encourage them\nto like feel proud of getting an A and\nthey do feel proud of anything we've got\nwe encourage them to valued overcoming\ndifficulty and succeeding so what a\nvideogame does so the interesting thing\nabout the videogame ever had a\nfascinating paper which talked about the\nreason that video games are addictive is\nnot because of the reward but because\nit's a denial so if you think about a\nvideo game you know they're not easy\nright if they're easy they're no fun so\nif you really talk to people about what\nthey enjoy about playing the video game\nespecially something like fortnight so\nif a fortnight is a game where like a\nhundred people fight against each other\nin arena and there's only one winner\nthere's only so 99% of the time\nstatistically you're gonna lose it for\nme and that's why isn't it because\nthat's 1% when you are king of the hill\nyou're brainy doesn't differentiate\nbetween graduating from medical school\nand winning the game before"
