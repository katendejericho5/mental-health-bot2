    "transcript": "but one of the biggest problems that\nparents want into is they say like okay\nno baby parameter and then read this\nbook and what I don't think anyone in\nthat relationship understands that even\nI don't really understand it because I\nwas just theoretical is that they don't\nhave the capacity to actually enjoy that\nnot in the way that we do right so as a\nparent you have to understand that when\nyou give them like some kind of\nalternative like they're not going to\nhave the capacity to enjoyment to enjoy\nit and what you really have to do is\nsort of like pull them away from games\nin a pretty significant manner to get\nthem to sort of have like a normal\nhealthy kind of dopamine kind of brain\nnow the good news is that it's not like\nyou have to get them to stop all gaming\nI think it's enough to engage them in a\nway that they find enjoyable like\nthere's you can do something right so\nyou can you know some people I'll tell\nthem to do things like go whitewater\nrafting or like a vacation so whitewater\nrafting is a really like tired rather\nthan kind of thing it's a little bit\ndangerous to that be careful but it's\nlike I've never met a game or a strong\nwhitewater rafting and didn't absolutely\nlike it's really engaging it's also\nhelped me it's something that you can do\nas a family so there are things that you\ncan do to sort of help yourself along\nand then when it comes to reading books\nlike you know I think books can be\nbought and you just have to give them\ntime and space and let their brain sort\nof like get used to that again and then\nyou can kind of think about alternative\nactivities but I think the dopamine\ncircuit is like just one of them and\nthen there are all these other circuits\nlike there's this sort of sense of\nidentity there's the sense of there's\nsomething a lot that I call the triumph\ncircuit which is not real circuits but\nit's like just this basic capacity that\nhuman beings like triumph and taya is\nrequires adversity so when you're\nthinking about like you know how that\nhelp your kid do something you have to\ngive them a task that is hard but\nengaging"
