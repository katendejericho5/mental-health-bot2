    "transcript": "I don't actually recommend them in our\nlimit because I think each kid is\ndifferent I think each family is\ndifferent there's a huge abuse in 12\nyear old and 15 year old so what I say\nis first of all talk to your kids right\nand like the first thing that you've got\nto do is disarm because when you talk to\nthem about video games the first thing\nthat pops into the mind is you're gonna\ntake my capsule so anything that you\nanything that they tell you is gonna be\nme plus the game against so I think the\nfirst thing that you've got to do is\nlike try to get on their team right try\nto really explain to them that I want to\ntalk to you I'm not saying we're gonna\nmake any United this is abhorrent to\ny'all I'm not saying we're making any\nchanges first just help me understand\nthem and then I think you should set\nreasonable expectations so like here's\nit was like dialogue that I would say\nI'd say like you know I I know that you\nreally love playing for tonight because\nyou feel amazing and I want you to feel\nthat way too\nI'm just wondering if there are other\nalternatives besides there in addition\nto for tonight that could help you feel\nthat way also I know that you really\nlove for night but I think that your\ngrades are kind of unacceptable\nI know you're capable of getting more\ndisease and and so you know if your\ngrades don't improve then we're gonna\nhave to stop them for me"
