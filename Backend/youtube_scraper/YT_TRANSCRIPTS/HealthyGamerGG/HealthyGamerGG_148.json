    "transcript": "see the biggest mistake that a lot of\npeople make in their life is they think\nthat oh my God I have such big problems\nand they think that big problems require\nbig Solutions most huge problems are\nactually solved through mild\ninterventions that are combined so\nremember that when I look at let's say\none piece of string the string cannot\nsupport a lot of weight but when I weave\ntogether multiple pieces of string into\na rope the tensile strength of the Rope\nis greater than the individual tensile\nstrengths of the individual strands put\ntogether right so there is a synergistic\neffect of multiple things done in a\nsmall amount for example in in\nPsychotherapy and medication where the\nbest outcomes are when we tend to\ncombine the two interventions it doesn't\nmean that everyone needs medication or\neveryone need psychotherapy but we tend\nto find that in life generally speaking\nlike if you're super super behind you\ndon't need to transform you just need to\ndo a handful of things a small amount\nconsistently over time and that will\nlead to transformation"
