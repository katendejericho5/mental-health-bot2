    "transcript": "now we're gonna dig into a little bit of\nhow to find that competing interest so\none of the problems that a lot of gamers\nfeel is when I talk to them they feel\npowerless like they feel like they can't\nget control over their lives they feel\nlike they have things that they want to\ndo in life and they're just not able to\ndo them but the deeper thing that\naffects a lot of gamers is that a lot of\ny'all actually feel not just powerless\nbut directionless you feel like you're\nnot moving anywhere in life it's not\njust about not being able to move it's\nabout not even knowing where you want to\ngo and feeling directionless is one of\nthe worst feelings that a gamer can\npossibly have and one of the problems\nwith gaming is that gaming gives you the\nsense of false direction if you think\nabout a video game there's a sense of\nprogress right you go to this world and\nthen you do this level and then you go\nto this other world and you do this\nlevel you level your character up you go\nto the later stages of the game so\nthere's this there's the sense of\nprogress and as human beings we are\nwired to want to progress in some way\nthe problem is that that sense of\nprogress that you get through the game\nwhile it sort of scratches the itch of\nprogressing in a temporary way when you\ngo to sleep at night you feel like you\nhaven't really done anything and I mean\nthat can be one of the most terrifying\nfeelings in the world and that's why\ngamers play to the point of exhaustion\nbefore they go to bed so how is it that\nyou can start to develop a direction in\nlife I think the first thing that you\nhave to do is understand the difference\nbetween doing something with meaning and\ndoing something that is a desire so what\nI mean by that is if I ask a game or\nlike where do you want to be ten years\nfrom now most of the answers that they\ncome up with are actually desires\nthey're not actually true interests\nthey're not things that they value so\nI'll give you an example so if I ask\nsomeone you know where do you want to be\nin ten years they'll say like oh you\nknow I'd like to be a millionaire like\nI'd like to have my own house you know\nI'd like to be married I'd like to you\nknow travel internationally and go to\nvideo game tournaments they'll say like\nall this kind of stuff and that's just\nthose are just kind of desires they're\njust like\nit's just like stuff you want right you\ncan go down the street and you can ask\nanyone like what do you want and they'll\nbe able to tell you all kinds of stuff\nbut desires don't actually really Drive\nyour behavior they don't motivate you\nand you may think that they motivate you\nbut they really don't because if they\ndid motivate you then you'd be moving\ntowards those goals right so by\ndefinition that random stuff that's kind\nof ephemeral and and\nout in the ether that stuff that you\nwant those kinds of desires are the\nkinds of things that it would be nice if\nI had that that's really what that\nthought is it's not really a true desire\nstuff that motivates you some stuff that\nactually gets you out of your out of the\nchair and gets your ass moving in a\ndirection is what I call a competing\ninterest and those competing interests\ndepend on values and so what is a value\nvalues are something that when you move\nin that direction you feel fulfilled so\nthe first question that I would ask\ngamers is what makes you feel fulfilled\nwhat is it that actually gives you a\nsense of like wow I really did something\ngood today what is it that makes you\nfeel like you've got the biggest dick on\nthe planet what is that thing that\nreally makes you feel like man I am\nawesome and the funny thing is that a\nlot of gamers that I talk to what they\nactually value is performance in the\ngame and that may not be what you want\nto value but let's just be clear let's\nbe honest with ourselves about what you\ncare about a lot of the gamers that I\nwork with are actually competitive\ngamers and they want to be like on the\ntop 100 of the ladder and they want to\nlike compete and they want to be the\nbest in the game and that's actually\nwhat they care about that's what they\nvalue which is why they practice so hard\nday after day after day you can see how\nwhen you really understand that the\nvalue is to be the best person in the\ngame it drives behavior on its own and\nyou may say well then I'm because\nlike if I value playing video games then\nhow can I move forward in life doesn't\nthat just mean I'm gonna play a bunch of\nvideo games yes that's kind of true but\nthe good news is that gamers have a lot\nof people actually have a lot of values\nthat they're not even aware of and this\nis where introspection comes into play\nthis is where as a\nor what you can actually sit down and do\nis a series of exercises to figure out\nand clarify what your values are and\nwhen you start to recognize your values\nwhen you start to say like oh actually\nthis is something that I care about I\nwant to do this this is something that's\nreally important to me the motivation\nwill follow that clarification of values\nthe motivation actually kind of comes\nautomatically for example let's say that\nhere in this this Hall you know like\nsomeone walks in with a gun and then\nstarts like shooting at people like\nthat's awful and that's been happening\nin a lot of schools which is absolutely\ncrazy if you look at what those people\ndo they actually value their lives right\nlike like the students in schools that\nget shot up value their lives which is\nwhy they try to preserve them it's\nsomething that's really important to\nthem it sounds kind of silly and stupid\nbut if you think about it what motivates\nthat person what motivates someone to\nescape death is just a value for life\nand that's a really powerful motivator\nand it's one of the most powerful\nmotivators you can have the neat thing\nis that if you can figure out values\noutside of just a preservation of life\nwhich most biological beings have you\ncan also find motivation that'll make\nyou move forward in life so the way that\nI'd say so let's talk a little bit\npractically how do you figure out what\nyour values are so I'd start by you know\ngrab a piece of paper and write down\nlike in one-page like write 500 words\nabout a time where you felt fulfilled\nactually sit down and do the exercise\nand this is really important because\ngamers tend to think a lot but they\nactually don't aren't good at reflecting\nor criticizing their own thought process\nand if you think about this this is a\nlittle bit tangential but when you play\na game a gamer comes up with an idea of\nwhat's gonna work and then they go into\nthe game and then they get told based on\nthe game whether the idea works or not\nright like let's say I have a strategy\nto take down a boss and when I go in\nwith in with that strategy the reason I\nknow the strategy works or doesn't work\nis because the game actually tells me I\ndon't have to reflect on my thought\nprocess or my strategy myself because\nthe game is gonna provide me with the\nfeedback\nand since gamers spend so much time\ncoming up with strategies but have an\nexternal source of feedback on what they\ncome up with they don't develop the\ncapacity to reflect and objectively look\nat their strategies even though you guys\nthink you're able to do that you're\nactually not very good at that so what\nyou need to do is use that get some\nexternal source of feedback by putting\nit on a piece of paper so write down in\n500 words on one piece of paper what\nmakes you feel fulfilled and when you do\nthat then you'll have the ability it'll\nbe on a piece of paper it'll be external\nand then you can look at it you can read\nit and then you can reflect on it and\nwhen you do that try to figure out okay\nwhat is what is it that I really care\nabout that I've written here why did I\nfeel fulfilled what is it about me that\nbig why does this make me feel fulfilled\nand then you'll start to get a\nclarification of what your values are\nand once you start clarifying what your\nvalues are the neat thing is that the\nmotivation will come kind of on its own\nand we've talked a little bit about\nmotivation and how motivation is not\nwillpower right like when I when I\nreally need to take a I'm motivated\nto find a bathroom that has nothing to\ndo with willpower it's not like I'm\nforcing myself to use the bathroom in\nfact you need willpower to restrain\nmotivation because to not in my\npants right now I actually need to use\nmy willpower to like you know keep my\nanus puckered tight and not myself\nand so that requires energy but the\nmotivation to find a bathroom is\nautomatic and is gonna drive my behavior\nso when you find your values when you\nclarify what your values are you guys\nwill be amazed the motivation is gonna\ncome on its own and then your life will\nstart to change but don't fall into the\ntrap that most gamers fall into which is\nthat I don't need to do this exercise I\ncan just think through it in my head I'm\ntelling you guys you can't do that you\nactually need to externalize upon a\npiece of paper because of the way that\ngames shape your brain because games are\nthe ones that give you external sources\nof feedback on your thought process so\nyou really have to actually sit down and\nwrite it out on a piece of paper you'll\nbe surprised at what actually comes out\nbecause the first five sentences you can\nthink of in your head\nbut the rest of the stuff I guarantee\nyou is gonna be something that you have\nnot thought about before so just to kind\nof recap the way that you really get\ncontrol of your gaming is through\ndeveloping a competing interest and the\nway that you really figure out what a\ncompeting interest is is to clarify your\nvalues and you have to understand that\nyour values are very different from your\ndesires stuff that you just want like\nyeah I like I want to be President to\nthe United States or I want to own 50%\nof Amazon or 50% of Google like yeah\nsure you want that but that's not that's\nnot actually gonna cause you to change\nyour behavior whereas understanding what\nyour values are is gonna evoke emotion I\nmean a motivation and that motivation is\ngoing to come automatically and your\nbehavior will start to change on its own\nbut you've got to clarify your values\nfirst we're gonna take a short break but\nwhen we come back I'm gonna tell you\nguys a little bit about something from\nkind of the eastern side and we'll talk\na little bit about this word called\nDharma which means duty"
