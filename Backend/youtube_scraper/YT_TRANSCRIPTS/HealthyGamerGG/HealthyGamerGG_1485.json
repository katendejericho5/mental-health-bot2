    "transcript": "so we're gonna talk a little bit about\nDharma and Dharma is the Sun script word\nwhich means duty so just to tell you\nguys to track back a little bit when I\nwas 21 I was kind of failing out of\ncollege and ended up spending some time\nat an ashram in India and an ashram is\nkind of like a monastery it's a place\nwhere people go and do like yoga and\nmeditation and it's kind of where monks\nlive and where they kind of do their\nthing and it was a really transformative\nexperience for me and I realized that a\nlot of the values and ways that we look\nat life which are based on Western\nphilosophy leave something to be desired\nand I'll explain a little bit about what\nI'm talking about\nso in psychiatry we tend to try to move\npeople away from suffering so if there's\nsomeone who's depressed or has anxiety\nas a psychiatrist it's my job to make\nthem undepressed and not feel anxiety in\nthe West we have this general idea which\nmakes perfect sense that what you want\nto do if you're in a bad spot that you\nshould move out of the bad spot and move\ninto a good spot right like we make\npeople better and we want to move away\nfrom suffering and move towards pleasure\nand move away from pain in the East they\nsay something a little bit different so\nBuddha Buddha said that all human beings\nare entitled to two things the first is\nsuffering in the second is death and\nthat's all you're entitled to which is\nkind of like a grandma outlook but it\nturns out to be true and what would have\nfound is that it's not enough to just\nrun away from suffering and not actually\na lot of times is you try to run away\nfrom suffering you actually create more\nsuffering for yourself and if we think a\nlittle bit about gaming how many of you\nguys would say that by running away from\nyour suffering through gaming you're\nactually creating more suffering for\nyourselves right like everyone agrees\nwith that like it's common sense but\nit's crazy to actually think about that\nthe way that you cope with a problem\nactually makes the problem worse but\nit's absolutely true of most gamers so\nhow do we get around that what we do is\nwe go back to Buddha right because he's\na smart guy\nhe knows\nthe he's talking about right like\nhe's what though so what he says is that\nthe way to live life is actually not to\navoid suffering but to live your Dharma\nwhich means to live your duty or your\nresponsibility and what would the\ndiscovered which is which actually is\nkind of common sense once we kind of\ntalk about it is that if you are living\nin service to your duty if you're trying\nto do something for a higher cause or\nyou're if you're living up to your\nresponsibilities that there's an immense\namount of strength and tolerance that\nyou'll get access to if you think about\nparents so like most parents can\nsacrifice immense amounts of you know\npersonal comfort or satisfaction for the\nsake of their children and they do it in\na heartbeat\nlike if a parent could trade their life\nto save their child from cancer they do\nit in a heartbeat interestingly enough\ngamers are very good at actually\nsacrificing for other people and if you\nthink about it where does that strength\ncome from where is it that how is it\nthat you can sacrifice so much for the\nsake of someone else and when you\nsacrifice oh you're the one that suffers\nright I mean that's how it works that's\nwhat sacrifice means is that you give\nsomething else you give up something and\nyou're the one who's worse off and so\nwhat this all comes back to is Dharma if\nyou as a gamer can figure out what your\nDharma is if you can be sort of rooted\nin your Dharma and grounded in it if you\ncan say that this is my duty this is my\nresponsibility in life this is who I\ncommit myself to be you'll be amazed at\nhow much strength you get out of that\nyou'll be amazed at how much you can\nwithstand and how much how much of an\nenergy reserve you'll have to move\nforward in the way that you want to and\nwhen I work with my patients I actually\ndon't try to help them I don't try to\nalleviate their suffering all right\nsometimes I'll start out that way but\nover time what I find is the best\ntreatment for depression is to actually\nhave people living in accordance with\ntheir duty and that sort of taps into\nthis weird like higher power\nwhich like I don't quite understand but\nsometimes human beings when they serve a\ncause that's greater than themselves\nthey're\nable to accomplish things that are\nsuperhuman and if you look at history\nyou'll see this all of the people who\nhave accomplished really amazing things\nlike you look at people like Mahatma\nGandhi you look at people like MLK on\nthe other end of the spectrum you even\nlook at people like Adolf Hitler why was\nHitler able to change Europe so much and\nturn Germany which had been a\nafter World War 1 into this ultimate\npowerhouse that threatened an entire\ncontinent it's because he was living in\nservice to this greater idea and when\nyou tap into that as a gamer if you can\nfigure out what that is for yourself\nyou'll have an immense amount of energy\nso how do you find your Dharma how do\nyou actually do that how do you tap into\nthat this actually kind of goes back to\nwhat I was talking about earlier I mean\nyou have to reflect you really have to\nexternalize it and I'd say that stick\nwith the same exercise I told you about\nearlier which is write something on a\npiece of paper so put down on a piece of\npaper what are your actual\nresponsibilities what are what is your\nduty as a human being on this earth what\nis your actual Duty like what is the\nmeaning of your existence here and a lot\nof you guys may say like when you\nactually sit down and try to put it down\non a piece of paper it's gonna be hard\nbecause what is your duty I mean what\nthe are you doing like what's the\nmeaning of your life you sit there and\nyou play video games all day like what\nis their meaning in that and that's\nexactly the problem right\nbecause you guys don't have meaning in\nyour life and so you have to figure out\nwhat your meaning is in the second you\nfigure out what your meaning is you're\ngoing to start to get more motivation\nyou're gonna start to get that fuel\nyou'll start to get energy and then\nyou'll be able to overcome that video\ngame addiction you'll be able to\novercome your game gaming and get some\ncontrol in your life yeah\nso there are a couple of ways the first\nis so like I said you can sit down with\na piece of paper and I'd start by\nactually writing down on that piece of\npaper what is your duty who are you\nresponsible to as a human being whose\nlife depends on you doing something and\nyou may find that actually there's no\none in your life that depends on you\nthat's actually the case for most young\npeople so then what I'd say is take one\nstep forward and ask yourself actually\ndon't ask yourself well let me just so\nthe way the other way you find meaning\nis by actually engaging in experience so\nsitting at home you're not going to\nactually learn what your\nresponsibilities are because you\nactually don't have responsibilities so\nwhat I encourage you to do is just get\nsome experience human beings are\ndesigned to crave and want experiences\nand we learn a lot through experience so\nI'd say get out of the house and just do\nsomething it doesn't matter what it is\njust go somewhere and do something\nvolunteer or find a job or to go to an\nart museum it doesn't matter what you do\ngo somewhere but in the back of your\nmind whenever you do that thing go for a\nhike go meet friends for drinks it\ndoesn't matter what you do in the back\nof your mind have this thought and look\nat this room like let's say you're\nsitting at a table and you're you're\nmeeting people for drinks you know just\nlike pause and look at the people that\nyou're with and ask yourself do I have a\nduty here do I have a responsibility and\nyou may find yes and you may find no and\nwhen you go for a hike do the same thing\nand ask yourself like what am I doing\nhere like is there is there any kind of\nduty or responsibility that arises here\nwhat is it that I want to do what is it\nthat I need to do what is it that I was\nput on this earth to do and the more\nplaces you go and you may say and this\nis where gamers are gonna be like well I\nmean how the am I gonna know what\nI'm supposed to do if I go for a hike\nhow is there any duty or responsibility\nthere and you're right and that's a\nrational explanation\nthat's an analytical answer to your\nquestion you know sure there's no duty\nthat you're going to find by going for a\nhike but the\nwith gamers is that you the only thing\nthat you use to learn is your analytical\nmind and there are parts of yourself in\nparts of your mind and parts of your\nbrain that are more intuitive that are\nmore emotional and you have to give them\nspace for them to actually have thoughts\nthat come up and so it's bizarre but\nlike why do people go for retreats out\nin the wilderness like people go for\nretreats out in the wilderness right\nlike it happens all the time like how\nthe does that help how do you like\ntrees and leaves and streams help you\nget perspective in life honestly I have\nno idea how that works but the\ntruth is it does work that's how people\nfind meaning in life is they go and they\nlike sit under a tree for a while and\nthey like breathe fresh air and they\nhike for a while and their muscles are\nsore and they go to sleep at night and\nthey wake up in the morning and somehow\nthey've found meaning I have no\nidea how it works but I do know that it\ndoes work so I think what you've got to\ndo is get your ass off of the chair and\ngo do something it doesn't matter what\nit is and in the back of your mind try\nto ask yourself like what am I supposed\nto do what's my responsibility here do I\nhave any responsibility and the more\nthat you create space away from your\nanalytical mind which comes up with\nlogical answers with your limited set of\ndata which you guys get from playing\nvideo games which is like all the data\nthat you all have and so you come up\nwith these logical conclusions but those\nlogical conclusions while they may sound\nlike they make sense don't actually\nimprove your life in any way so you've\ngot to get your ass out of the chair and\ngo do something else and you will be\namazed at what your brain is capable of\nwhen you give it a diversity of\nexperience your brain is gonna take in\nthat fresh air and it's gonna listen to\nthe stream and it's gonna look at the\npiece of art and it's going to listen to\nthe music and and listen to your friends\nand somehow something is gonna happen in\nyour unconscious mind and you're gonna\ncome out the other end the sausage is\ngonna be made and you're gonna have\nmeaning and it's just I know how the\n works but that's how it works"
