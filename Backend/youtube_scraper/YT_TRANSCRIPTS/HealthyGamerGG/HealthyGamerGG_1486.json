    "transcript": "so we talked a little bit about\nopen-ended problem solving and\nclosed-ended problem solving and how\ngamers actually how games shape them at\nbeing very good at analytical thinking\nwith a defined solution so they're very\ngood at things like puzzles where you\nsort of have a particular\num sandbox to work in and a gamer's\nreally good at figuring out how to get\nfrom point a to point z if you show them\nwhere point a is and if you show them\nwhere point z is\nthey struggle with open-ended problem\nsolving which is a problem that you kind\nof don't know\nwhere the end point is\nfor example finding a job like how do\nyou know if the job that you found is\ngood enough could you find a job that\npaid you a little bit more could you\nfind a job that had a better boss like\nhow do you know when that ends how do\nyou beat the game of finding a job\nbecause you don't really know what the\nend point is\na lot of gamers think that the reason\nthey struggle with open-ended problems\nlike finding a job or finding a\ngirlfriend is because\nyou guys think you're lazy and if you\nweren't lazy then everything would be\neasier in life and you're just someone\nwho drew the short straw and you're lazy\nthat's actually not the case in my\nexperience\nthere are some kinds of people other\ngroups of people that struggle with\nopen-ended problem solving and there's a\nparticular group that is very smart and\nnot lazy at all but still struggles with\nopen-ended problem solving and that\ngroup actually happens to be doctors\ncrazy i know but in order to understand\nhow a doctor and why a doctor struggles\nwith open-ended problem solving we have\nto track back to the mind of like the 15\nyear old kid who decides that they want\nto be a doctor\nso you've got this 15 year old kid who's\nat a christmas party that they're at at\ntheir you know their friends their\nfamily friends have a christmas party\nand they're going there and they see\nsomeone that they haven't seen in a year\nand that adult asks them what do you\nwant to be when you grow up and then\nthat kid says i want to be a surgeon and\nthen everyone's like so impressed\nthey're like oh my god like you're going\nto be a surgeon that's amazing like\nyou're so smart and they they sort of\nthe kid you know just by saying telling\npeople that you want to be a surgeon\nsomehow that makes the kid more\nrespected so the kid decides you know\ni'm going to be a surgeon because\neveryone thinks that that's awesome and\ni'm a good person and i'm going to make\na lot of money and i'm going to perform\nsurgery on people and i'm going to save\nlives\nand so what does that kid actually do\nthey go to their school counselor and\nthey say\nyou know i want to i want to be a doctor\none day and so the school counselor is\nlike okay so you have to like take a\nbunch of ap classes you have to do\nreally well on your sat\nhere's like the princeton review or the\nkaplan course that you should take and\nso the kid sort of gets this script\nto\nto how to be successful and how to get\ninto a good college so they study really\nhard they take the ap classes they study\nfor the sat\nthey work really hard and they kind of\ndo everything that they're supposed to\nand they end up with a good gpa a good\nsat score and then they go and they talk\nto their school counselor and the school\ncounselor says you should apply to ivy\nleague universities you should apply to\nharvard and yale and stanford and ucla\nand uc berkeley and you should apply to\nall these wonderful institutions like\ncornell and columbia\nand so the kid\ngoes to those websites and downloads all\nthose applications and fills out a bunch\nof applications and then writes a bunch\nof essays and then\nwrites exactly i mean the school tells\nyou what to write they say write 500\nwords about a challenge that you faced\nin your life and it's all scripted so\nthey don't actually have to think about\nwhat they're doing because everything is\nlaid out for them\nso they get into college and then when\nthey're getting oriented as a freshman\nthey meet their academic advisor and\nthey tell their academic advisor i want\nto you know become a doctor and so the\nacademic advisor\ntells them what to do and they say okay\nyou've got to take pre-med courses\nyou've got to take biology you've got to\ntake physics you've got to take\nchemistry\nin your third year of of college you\nhave to take the medical college\nadmissions test which is like the s.a.t\nfor medical school\nand then you also need to do some kind\nof volunteering you need to do some kind\nof leadership experience you need to do\nsome kind of research so they once again\nget a script of like a b c d e f and g\nof boxes they need to check and they\nstart plodding along and they work\nreally hard and they do all of those\ndifferent things and then they apply to\nmedical school\nand the medical school invites them for\nan interview and so the medical school\ntells the kid okay now that you've sent\nus all this paperwork this application\nand these essays and things like that\nabout why you want to be a doctor come\nto our medical school on this day and\nmake sure you wear a suit and then we're\ngoing to ask you why you want to be a\ndoctor and then based on that and your\nmcat scores and your gpa will either\naccept you into our medical school or we\nwon't so the kid gets accepted to\nmedical school\nthey go to medical school and then once\nagain it's like you don't sign up for\nparticular classes in med school you\nsort of have to learn everything so you\ngo to class every day and you study\nreally hard and you take a bunch of\ntests and then you kind of do what\nyou're told\nand then third year medical school rolls\naround and that's when you start doing\nthese things called rotations so the\nfirst two years of medical school you're\nkind of a student you're sitting in a\nchair just like in college or in high\nschool but the last two years of medical\nschool you're actually working in a\nhospital and so you're following doctors\naround and you're doing things like\nlearning how to tie sutures and learning\nhow to give injections and you're kind\nof in\nin the hospital actually doing the work\nof a doctor\nso they do that for a little while and\nthen after that you do this thing called\napply to residency so after medical\nschool is when you really learn how to\nbe a doctor and that's during residency\nso you do different kinds of residency\nthere's a surgery residency there's a\npsychiatry residency that's the one that\ni did\ni'm a psychiatrist\nand so when you go\nbut once again it's like it's just like\ncollege applications or medical school\napplications you fill out an application\ni write an essay about why i want to be\na psychiatrist or why i think that the\nfield of psychiatry is exciting\nand i didn't write about video game\naddiction back then\nbecause it wasn't really a thing and\npeople didn't really know what that was\nand it's even still sort of just\nbecoming a thing\nat least within the academic community\nand so you end up sort of applying the\nresidency and then you interview and\nthen you get matched there's a computer\nprogram that tells you where you end up\ngoing for residency so you go to your\nresidency and you train there for four\nyears and during residency they tell you\nthey're like okay so on day one you need\nto show up at this hospital at this time\nand work on this unit and then on day 31\nyou're going to be on call overnight in\nthe hospital so you have to show up here\nand do this kind of work so every step\nof the way they tell you exactly what to\ndo\nand then\nyou finish residency and most people\nfinish residency somewhere between the\nages of 30\n30 and 35 depending on what you do\nand or 29 and 35\nand that's when just pause and think\nabout this for a second that's the first\ntime that this person applies for a job\nso like you have a 34 year old guy who's\nlike a neurosurgeon who has never\napplied for a job never applied for a\njob he's just been he boarded the train\nand the train has its tracks and he just\ngoes along the track goes along the\ntrack goes along the track and then he\ngets off the track and the guy has never\napplied for a job so a lot of doctors\nactually struggle with like job\nnegotiations and a lot of doctors the\nfirst couple of years after they finish\nmedical school get chronically underpaid\nbecause they actually don't know what\nthey're worth they feel embarrassed\nasking for more money so they go to\ntheir chief and their chief says well\nwhy don't you work here why don't you\nwork here and they apply for different\njobs but they actually don't know like\nthey've never worked anywhere all\nthey've ever done\nis fill out applications\ntake tests go to class and do exactly\nwhat they've been told to do\nso doctors actually struggle a lot with\nlike basic life skills like paying taxes\nand stuff like that because they haven't\ndone that i mean you've got a 34 year\nold guy who's i mean they have paid\ntaxes but\nyou know their taxes are really simple\nthey've never they've never found a job\nthey've never thought about you know\nwhere they want to live or buying a\nhouse or anything like that they're like\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in debt\nthey've never had a paycheck and that's\na doctor and if you ask a doctor you\nknow\nhow do you find a job it's really hard\nfor them they really struggle with like\nnegotiating and struggling with like\nfinding benefits and like you know\nasking for paid parking and all these\nlike tiny things come up that cause\ndoctors all kinds of grief\nand it's not that they're smart i mean\nit's not that they're stupid and it's\nnot that they're lazy it's that\nfinding a job is a skill that you\nactually have to learn how to do\nand if you don't do it until you're 34\nyou're not going to be good at it it has\nnothing to do with being lazy or being\nstupid it's just it's a skill it's a\npart of your brain that you've never had\nto use\nso gamers are kind of the same way\nbecause if you look at a game a game\nbreaks down all of your problems for you\nit gives you a script of this is level\none and this is level two and this is\nlevel three and in order to unlock level\nfour you have to beat levels one two and\nthree\nbut it's kind of like a very close-ended\nsystem\nin medical school and people who become\ndoctors are kind of the same way they\njust go from a to b to c to d you know\nyou do high school and then college and\nthen medical school and then residency\nit's like level one two three and four\nand each one has an application and each\none has an essay\nand most of them have interviews\nand so how is that different\nfrom a gamer it's actually kind of the\nsame thing in both of these situations\nyou have\nproblems which are very close-ended and\nyou're told what to do so both of these\npopulations actually struggle with kind\nof open-ended or abstract thinking a lot\nof doctors also struggle with finding\nrelationships by the way but that's kind\nof a separate issue\nso now let's compare that a little bit\nwith\nsomeone else who's let's say doesn't go\nto medical school and let's look at how\nthey get better at open-ended problem\nsolving so let's once again start with\nour 15 year old kid but this kid doesn't\nhave aspirations to be a surgeon so when\nthey turn 16 you know they're not quite\nsure what they want to do they apply for\ntheir first job and so how does a 16\nyear old find a job\nthey probably like start working\nsomewhere where they know someone who's\nworking so they have a friend who works\nat a car wash and so they fill out an\napplication and they end up getting a\njob at the car wash or they have an\nuncle who has like a i don't know like a\npaper supply company and so they they\nwork at the paper supply company\nanswering phones\nbasically the solution space for where\nthey can find a job is basically kind of\nlike what's already in front of them if\nthey know someone they'll kind of apply\nfor a job or they'll be driving down the\nroad and they see like a hiring sign at\na restaurant so they'll start to become\na waiter or they'll like fill out an\napplication at a place like mcdonald's\nwhatever they sort of start to find a\njob in kind of a pretty narrow area\nand then what happens is they apply to\ncollege and so in college there's also\nkind of a particular solution space\nbecause you know do you want to go to\ncollege but\nthis solution space grows a little bit\nbigger than finding your first job so do\nyou want to go to college in state or\nout of state do you want to go to\ncollege\nyou know do you want to go to a state\nschool or a private school do you need\nto apply for scholarships you need to go\nsomeplace where do you need to kind of\nstay close to home because you can't\nafford an apartment so you can stay at\nhome so now they're a lot more going to\ncollege becomes sort of this abstract\nproblem that has a bunch of different\nvariables\nand people start to learn how to\nnavigate those variables\nand so that person goes to college as\nwell\nand now they have to think about well\nwhat do i want to major in they haven't\ndecided to become a doctor already at\nthe age of 15. so they talk to their\nadvisors and they're like okay i'm going\nto be like an undeclared major or\nunspecified major or something like that\nand they have to figure out okay do i\nwant to be an engineer do i want to\nstudy finance or do i want to study\nphilosophy or biology and so they have\nto think about like what they want to be\nwhen they grow up and that's kind of an\nabstract problem and so they they try it\na little bit and they decide to pick\nsomething and then they when they finish\ncollege they start looking for a job and\nso\nthat too becomes kind of like a\nnow the net is even wider so do you want\nto work in the same town that um you\nwent to college because now you have\nmore options because you're actually\ngoing to be getting a paycheck so you\ndon't have to live close to home so now\nthe number of things that you can do\nactually increases and you have to think\ndo i want to work in the country or out\nof the country do i want to live in\ncalifornia or live in new york or stay\nin texas do i want to be close to family\nwhere do i want to live what kind of job\ndo i want to find and so they start the\njob hunting process\nand then they end up getting a job and\nlet's say they went to the university of\ntexas at austin and they decided they\nwant to move out west to california and\nso they go to california\nand then after a couple of years later\nlet's say they ended up working in\nfinance they decide that they want to go\nback to school and they want to get\ntheir mba and so once again they're kind\nof faced with this question of when do i\nwant to get my mba do i want to get it\nafter two years or three years or four\nyears\nand do they want to get do they want to\ntake the promotion or do they want to go\nto business school so these problems\nbecome more and more abstract and let's\nsay that they go to business school then\nafter they leave business school do they\nwant to go back to the old company or do\nthey want to move to a new company do\nthey want to move out of finance into\nlet's say investment banking or private\nequity or marketing or do they want to\nwork in the startup world so these are\nall really abstract problems\nbut in the case of this this last person\nthat we're talking about you can kind of\nsee it each step of the way the number\nof variables they have to deal with grow\n16 year old finding a job has like 10\noptions applying to college has like 20\noptions choosing what to major in also\nhas like 10 options\nwhere you first find a job has like 50\noptions when you decide to go to\ngraduate school has like 100 options and\nso each step of the way this person\ntheir brain is actually learning this\nskill of taking an abstract problem and\nbreaking it down into individual pieces\nand so this person when a gamer looks at\nthe person who's successful and 30 in\ntheir age and says wow that person is\nlike motivated because they now are a\nmanager at an investment bank they look\nat that and they say that guy's got to\nbe smart and he's not lazy but it's more\nsubtle than that it's not that they're\nthey're lazy or not lazy it's that they\nhave learned how to manage this broader\nand broader set of abstract problems and\nhave gotten better at open-ended problem\nsolving\nwhereas the guy who's a gamer instead of\ngetting a job at 16 he plays video games\nfor six hours a day\nwhen he goes to college he doesn't spend\na whole lot of time going to different\nclub activities and and figuring out\nwhat to major in he just picks computer\nscience or like graphic design because\nhe wants to be a video game programmer\nhe spends a lot of his free time just\nplaying video games when he finishes\ncollege he applies for a narrower set of\njobs and spends most of his time just\nplaying video games when he he may not\neven go to grad school because at that\npoint he's sort of like his abstract\nthinking stops it stops growing and so\nthen he ends up being 30 years old and\ncomparing himself to the\nhis buddy who's a who's a manager in an\ninvestment bank and he says wow that guy\nis like that guy's really hard working\nand i'm lazy and that's the reason i am\nwhere i am\nthe fascinating thing is that's just not\ntrue\nit just isn't true it's not about\nlaziness it's not about intelligence\nit's about developing a particular\ncognitive skill\nof taking an open-ended abstract problem\nand being able to chunk it up\nand what i found when i work with gamers\nwhen i work with you guys is that if we\ncan sit down and actually do this\nconsciously take a problem that you have\nand operationalize it break it down into\nits component parts and figure out what\nyou need to do at each step of the way\nthen the gamer suddenly starts moving\nforward in life they suddenly start\ngetting better they start becoming more\nfinancially independent they find better\njobs they even find girlfriends because\nwe talk a little bit about getting into\nshape and upgrading your wardrobe and\nfiguring out what to like getting rid of\nthe fedora and then like shaving that\nneck beard that you've got and like\ngamers start to like do better in life\nif we chunk down why they can't find a\ngirlfriend it's because of the\nway you dress and it's because of the\nway that you smell\nand it's because you're so\nsocially awkward because you spend the\nwhole day in front of a computer screen\nso before you do that you got to go and\ntake an improv class and once they take\nan improv class they feel more\ncomfortable socially and they feel more\ncomfortable around women and then women\ndon't think that they're creepy because\nthey know how to interact with women\nand so even something like finding a\ngirlfriend is like an abstract problem\nbut that can be chunked down into like\nfashion and hygiene and social skills\nand getting physically into shape and\nnot living in your mom's\nbasement like that counts for a lot when\nyou're trying to find a girlfriend so\nyou can break that down into pieces and\nonce you start working on the pieces\nit's amazing how much better your life\nis going to get but in order to do that\nyou have to learn how to actually break\ndown that problem\nbecause your brain right now\nhasn't needed to do that it hasn't\nneeded to do it because you spend so\nmany hours playing video games where\nthat's been done for you\nso one of the things that i i invite you\nguys to think a little bit about is do\nyou actually know how to achieve the\ngoal that you say you want if you want\nto be financially independent do you\nknow the steps around doing that and if\nyou sit down and you start writing those\nsteps on a piece of paper i'm almost\ncertain that you're going to come up\nwith like six or seven which are going\nto be pretty abstract in and of\nthemselves\nand that's when you're going to stop and\nthat's when you're going to have trouble\nand so what we need to do if you want to\nstart moving forward in life is teach\nyour brain how to take that abstract\nproblem and turn it into a concrete one\nbecause the neat thing about gamers is\nif i give you a concrete problem and i\ngive you a concrete set of tools you'll\nfigure it out on your own so the first\nstep is taking an open-ended problem and\nturning it into a closed-ended problem\nand we'll talk a little bit more about\nhow to do that\nany thoughts or questions"
