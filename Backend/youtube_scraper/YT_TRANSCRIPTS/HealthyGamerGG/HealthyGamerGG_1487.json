    "transcript": "we talked a little bit about how\nrelationships that are formed through\nthe internet are actually really\nauthentic and I think that that's an a\nreally amazing thing but it also shapes\nwhat gamers become comfortable with\nsince they're used to being kind of seen\nfor themselves and not judged based on\ntheir appearance or how much money they\nhave or the color of their skin when\nthey do move out into the real world\nthey start to get exposed based on those\nqualities and they can feel like they\nget judged very easily and that can\nbecome really problematic so a lot of\ntimes when people you know when people\ndon't have a lot of friends online they\nget used to kind of moving into a into a\npublic area and being kind of\nscrutinized by other people and you kind\nof get used to that scrutinize ation and\nthat judgment I think what happens with\ngamers is since they spend so much time\nonline that scrutiny starts to become\nreally uncomfortable for them and they\nstart to lose confidence in who they are\nas a person and I know that I mean we've\ntalked a little bit earlier but I know\nthat a lot of you guys have trouble\nmoving with confidence in the real world\nwhereas you feel so much more\ncomfortable and so much more confident\nwhen you're behind a computer screen and\nso the more time you spend behind a\ncomputer screen the less confident you\nbecome in the real world and that can\nreally cause problems for relationships\nespecially romantic relationships and\none of the biggest problems that gamers\nhave with romantic relationships is that\nthey're they're gamers tend to give in\norder to get and I'll explain what I\nmean by that\nso let's say that you're you're a gamer\nand you know you spend a lot of time\nonline and then you're also a college\nstudent and you meet a girl and you\nthink she's cute and you like her but\nsince you kind of don't have confidence\nyou sort of feel like oh you know you're\nnot as attractive as some of the other\ndudes in the college or you don't have\nquite as much money or you don't dress\nas nice and so you kind of see these\ndeficiencies in yourself and you're\nattracted to this girl so what do you do\nas a gamer you end up trying to level\nthat playing field in your mind when\nyou're dealing with the girl you tend to\nthink\noh I I mean she's not gonna if I ask her\nout she's gonna say no so what I need to\ndo is I need to get her to like me more\nso that when I ask her out she's gonna\nsay yes so then what happens is a gamer\nusually starts out sort of being\nfriendly right he doesn't ask her out at\nthe beginning but you start hanging out\nwith her and then you start doing stuff\nfor her like if she needs a ride because\nit's raining or something like that you\ngive her a ride when she has trouble\nlike studying for things you tutor her\nyou buy her meals you start to be like\nher this really nice guy and you start\nto do things because you don't feel\nconfident enough to ask her out you\nstart to do things for her and all the\nwhile in your mind this is towards this\ngoal of getting her to like you and so\nyou're investing all of this stuff into\nthis relationship with the hope that\nyou're gonna get something out of it and\nso the help that you give her the kind\nof kindness that you show her has this\nulterior motive and if you guys are\nreally honest with yourselves you'll see\nthat that's the case of getting\nsomething back and what happens then she\nends up dating someone else and then you\nresent that guy right and then she calls\nyou up one night and she's like oh like\nthe guy that I'm dating he's such an\nand then you listen to her talk about\nher boyfriend problems and then this\nthought pops up in your mind well all of\nthose things that are wrong with him are\nright with me I wouldn't treat you like\nthat I treat you like gold I'd respect\nyou and you start to think that how can\nshe not see that I'm the perfect person\nbecause I do all of this stuff for her\nand her boyfriend doesn't and so\nthen what happens is at some point all\nof this stuff that you've invested in\nthe relationship and everything that\nthat you kind of put into this\nrelationship all of the sacrifices\nyou've made for her we're kind of\nbuilding up building up building up and\nthen you want something in return and\nthen what happens is is you ask her out\nright you finally like you reach this\npoint where you can't take it anymore\nand you ask her out and then what does\nshe do she says no I think of you like a\nfriend right that's the line I think of\nyou like a friend and this pisses gamers\noff to no end it pisses the out of\nyou right because like you've been\nfriends\nand you guys hate that and why is that\nso resentful it's because you never\nwanted to be friends owned and you\ninvested so much into this relationship\nbecause you would you were afraid that\nshe was gonna turn you down at the\nbeginning and then you invest all of\nthis time in this effort in this money\ninto getting her to like you and then\nshe rejects you and that rejection is so\nmuch more painful because you've\ninvested so much you spent the last year\nof your life taking care of this girl\nand then she turns you down and then\nthat makes you really really angry hurts\nyour self-confidence causes a lot of\ngamers to be really resentful towards\nwomen and causes a lot of the toxicity\nthat we see online in that toxicity that\nhatred of women comes from a sense of\nbetrayal and a sense of regret in a\nsense of like an investment that you've\nlost and so that's really really toxic\nand really dangerous and the worst thing\nabout that is after this happens to you\none time you feel less confident in\nyourself and it becomes harder to ask\nout the next girl so then what happens\nis you repeat the whole pattern because\nwhereas before you know she had a 20%\nchance of saying yes if you asked her\nout now the next girl has a 10% chance\nbecause you've already been rejected\nonce and not only were you rejected you\nwere rejected after you did so much for\nthat girl so the second time around\nyou're like okay now I have to do even\nmore to get her to like me and so the\nsecond time around gamers invest even\nmore and what you guys do is then you\nknow you buy her flowers for Valentine's\nDay as a friend and when she gets dumped\nby her boyfriend and stood up you're\nthere you're the knight in shining armor\nand you do everything for her and so you\ninvest and invest and invest in this\nrelationship but you're investing in it\nwith sort of the idea of her being your\ngirlfriend but you never make that clear\nto her and so she kind of thinks of you\nas a friend because you actually don't\nask her out at the beginning right\nyou're just like this nice guy and you\nwant her to see your value and so that's\nreally dangerous because you have to be\ncareful about whether you're someone who\ngives to get and if you're giving to get\nsomething in return\nchances are that's gonna end poorly and\nyou're gonna resent that person for it\nbecause in a sense they don't know\nwhat you're doing right they just think\nthat you're a nice guy and that doesn't\nentitle you to anything but it makes you\nfeel entitled because in your mind it's\nan investment and you're looking at for\na return if you're doing something out\nof the kindness of your heart that's\nfine but if you're really doing\nsomething out of kind the kindness of\nyour heart you shouldn't be expecting\nsomething in return so one of the most\ndangerous patterns that gamers can fall\ninto is this pattern of giving to get\nand take a look at your interactions\nwith women and see if that's actually\nwhat you do why are you so nice to them\nto begin with why do you buy them dinner\nand buy them gifts and spend so much\ntime like finding this perfect piece of\njewelry for a female friend of yours\nit's because you've got feelings for her\nif you've got feelings for her why don't\nyou ask her out it's because you're\nterrified she's gonna say no and since\nyou're terrified you invest all this\nstuff but that just leads to regret and\nit turns into hatred and over time the\nmore that this happens and I've seen\nthis happen with a lot of you guys\nseveral times each time it happens it\ngets a little bit worse and a little bit\nworse and a little bit worse and then\nit's just really catastrophic so one of\nthe things that you guys have to\nunderstand about relationships is be\nhonest with yourself about with a way\nthat you feel towards another person and\nbe honest with them and do it from the\nget-go if they're gonna reject you they\nmay reject you and that's okay but the\nchances that you know you invest\nsomething and then magically they're\ngonna wake up one day and love you are\nactually really small and I know it's\npainful to think about but see if you\nfall into this pattern are you someone\nwho gives to get and if you are does\nthat have to do with confidence and if\nit does have to do with confidence the\nsolution is not to give more the\nsolution is to work on your confidence\nand a little bit later we'll talk about\nhow to do that"
