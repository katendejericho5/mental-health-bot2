    "transcript": "for our next neuroscience topic I want\nto tell you guys about something called\nthe triumph circuit now the triumph\ncircuit isn't quite like the dopamine\ncircuit or some of the emotional\ncircuits we talk about in the sense that\nthose circuits are very easily mapped\nonto the brain like there's a part of\nyour brain called the nucleus accumbens\naccumbens that secretes dopamine and\ngives you a sense of pleasure there's a\npart of your brain called the amygdala\nthat anytime you feel fear or negative\nemotion is active the triumph circuit is\na little bit different it's something\nthat doesn't localize to one part of the\nbrain but it's just a general pattern of\nkind of psychology and cognition that is\nimportant to human beings\nin short the triumph circuit is the part\nof our brain that makes us feel good\nwhen we overcome a challenge and to\nstart to understand the triumph circuit\nwe have to track back to why human\nbeings have this in the first place\nand if you stop and think about what\nmakes a game so addictive there's a\nsense of a challenge followed by an\nachievement like if you're playing a\ngame like Dark Souls and you've died six\ntimes on a boss and then you beat that\nboss afterward you feel amazing it gives\nyou this rush so where does that rush\ncome from why do human beings relish\nsomething that is a challenge followed\nby a success where does that feeling of\ntriumph come from and what we need to do\nis actually track back and look at kind\nof evolutionary biology to understand\nwhere the triumph circuit comes from so\nlike millions of years ago when human\nbeings were hunter-gatherers there would\nbe like a range that they would sort of\nhunt and forage in and you would sort of\nhave a like a territory and people would\ngo out and they'd kind of like look for\nberries or look for animals and\nsometimes you know that area was kind of\nit was safe it was a little bit\nconservative people knew where the\nPredators were they knew where like the\nberry bushes were and so it was kind of\nlike a safe place to be and then what\nhappened is some human beings\nhad the desire to kind of go beyond that\nsafe place and to venture a little bit\ninto dangerous parts of the jungle and\nfor the ones who ventured into the\ndangerous parts there's a greater chance\nthat they would find food because it\nhasn't been picked clean because it's\nnot the safe part and so the ones that\nventured out past the safe zone and\nexpose themselves to more predators had\na greater chance of finding more food\nand so when they ventured into the\ndangerous territory everyone was kind of\nscared right they're like oh my god\ndon't go into the forbidden area of the\njungle because you may be eaten by a\ntiger but when they came back with more\nfood they were awarded because they went\ninto the dangerous territory and\nsucceeded in bringing something back so\nif you look at evolutionary biology\nthere's a strong story about venturing\ninto the unknown and finding something\novercoming some kind of challenge and\nthen bringing it back to society and if\nyou look at how that's shaped social\npsychology we as human beings value\npeople who overcome odds why is it that\nsociety cares that someone survived\ncancer like why is that a thing like why\ndo we value that it's because cancer\nsurvivors speak to that triumph circuit\nthere's something about the danger of\ncancer and the the capability that\ncancer is absolutely going to destroy\nyou that when you survive it it becomes\nsomething that is universally esteemed\nif you get if you face any kind of\nchallenge like let's say that you know\nyou're you're in a war zone and you have\nto like travel through a war zone and\nthen you make it out alive you're gonna\nfeel a great sense of exhilaration and\nyou're gonna feel a sense of triumph so\nhuman beings have a very fundamental\ncircuit in their brain that correlates\nthe amount of challenge they face with\nthe amount of triumph that they feel and\nif you think about video games video\ngames have done a very good job at\nstriking that balance let's think a\nlittle bit about games that are too easy\nwhy aren't they fun it's because they're\ntoo easy and other games that aren't fun\nor games that are too\nhard right like if you just think about\nit like if there's a game and you turn\non god mode and then you run through the\ngame it's not nearly as fun as if you\nplay it normally so there's something\nabout games that they game designers\nwork really hard to strike this balance\nof making it challenging enough to feel\nlike you accomplished something when you\novercome that challenge but in order to\nget that feeling of accomplishment you\nhave to have a feeling of a challenge\nand what that's doing is accessing the\ntriumph circuit of our brain the really\ndangerous thing about the triumph\ncircuit and video games is that the\ntriumph circuit was originally designed\nto help human beings achieve something\nin life so if you think about who do we\nrespect we respect people like doctors\nand lawyers because the path that\nthey've walked tends to be viewed as\nharder like studying really hard for\nseven years to becoming a neurosurgeon\nis something that we respect because\nit's hard to do we respect people who do\nhard things and that's been kind of a\ngood thing from an evolutionary\nperspective because when we face a\nchallenge and we overcome it that yields\ngood rewards I mean that's correlated\nwith actual improvement in your personal\nlife if we think about you know jobs and\nadversity society compensates doctors\nhigher and neurosurgeons at a high rate\nbecause what they do is very difficult\nso we fundamentally respect people who\ncan overcome challenges what happens in\na video game is that they sort of\nartificially hijack that triumph circuit\nand so they give gamers the feeling of\nachieving something are being triumphant\nby activating that circuitry in your\nbrain the problem is that that\nachievement doesn't actually come with a\nreal-world reward and so what happens is\nthat that triumph circuit for nor most\npeople causes them to strive to achieve\nsomething and improve their lives but\nwhen that that same part of your brain\nwhen the triumph circuit gets activated\nby the game then suddenly you get the\nsame neurological benefit but without\nany of the real-world consequences and\nthat's what makes it so incredibly\ndangerous and so one of the things you\nhave to understand is again\nis when you achieve something in the\ngame the degree of achievement that you\nfeel from a neurologic perspective can\nbe really similar to what you feel when\nyou achieve something in the real world\nbecause the game is just accessing that\ncircuitry and so you have to be careful\nbecause when you look at yourself and\nyou look at you know why do I play the\ngame and what do I like about playing\nthis game how does the game make me feel\nrecognize that part of that is a feeling\nof triumph and once you understand that\nthat feeling of triumph is there you\nwill start to be a little bit better at\nnavigating some of the challenges that\nyou face in the real world but at the\nend of the day I think the main point of\nexplaining the triumph circuit is just\nto equip you guys with knowledge take a\nlook at yourself and ask yourself why do\nI play this game when is it that I feel\nthe best in the game what's so exciting\nabout downing a raid boss in World of\nWarcraft or ff14 like why does that feel\nso good to us it's because it's\nhijacking this thing called the triumph\ncircuit and you feel like you've really\naccomplished something\ngamers feel like they've really done\nsomething worthwhile when they down this\nraid boss but the really dangerous thing\nabout that is that that raid boss was\ndesigned to be defeated games are\ndesigned to be beaten and what game\ndesigners do is they want to make it\nhard and make it feel like an\nachievement but if you really stop and\nlook at it all games are designed to be\nbeaten by most people otherwise they\nwouldn't sell and so it's all this\nartificial hijacking of this circuitry\nwhich can be really dangerous because\nthat's the same circuitry that causes us\nto actually work really hard in life and\nif we're activating it without working\nhard then it becomes really hard to\nactivate it by working hard because why\nwould your brain want to work hard and\nactivate it when you can just get the\nshortcut and activate it through a game\nand so understand that when you play the\ngame it's actually tampering with your\nbrain in a way that is especially\nchallenging to deal with the reason that\nyou can't stop gaming is not because\nyou're lazy or not because you don't\nhave willpower it's because there are\nfundamental parts of your brain that\ndrive behavior that are driving your\ngaming because the triumph circuit\ndrives your behavior and so you have\nthis fundamental piece of yourself that\nis forcing you to gain and you have to\nunderstand that about yourself you\nreally have to understand that piece of\nyourself if you want to have any chance\nof getting control of your gaming"
