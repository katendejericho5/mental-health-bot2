    "transcript": "over the past few years I've had the\nchance to work with dozens of gamers and\nthe more I work with gamers the more I\nstarted to wonder like what's actually\ngoing on in these people's brains in my\nDave job I'm an addiction psychiatrist\nso I tend to work with people who have\nproblems with alcohol or opiates or\nmarijuana and one of the things that I\nhave always found really helpful is to\nunderstand how do these substances\nactually affect the chemistry in\nsomeone's brain and so the more I work\nwith gamers the more I realized that\ngaming certainly has effects in people's\nbrains but those effects tend to be a\nlittle bit more subtle than what happens\nwith biological addictions like alcohol\nalcohol for example directly stimulates\ncertain receptors in your brain that\ngive you feelings of euphoria and\ndisinhibition and kind of slowed you\ndown a little bit\nwhereas gaming affects your brain in in\nslower ways it's not like we're it's not\nan actual chemical or physical substance\nthat's entering your bloodstream and\ndirectly activating parts of your brain\nthe way that games affect your brain\ntend to be in smaller ways and they tend\nto affect different parts of your brain\nat the same time so the first kind of\ncircuitry that I wanted to talk about\ntoday is your reward circuitry or your\ndopamine circuitry and dopamine is the\nprimary neurotransmitter that regulates\npleasure in the brain so in there's this\npart of the brain called the nucleus\naccumbens and when dopamine activity\nhappens there it's one of the ways in\nwhich we feel pleasure it's like the\npleasure center of our brain if we look\nat a lot of drugs of abuse like cocaine\nand amphetamines and things like that\nthose stimulant medication are those\nstimulant drugs tend to directly\nincrease dopamine in our brain which\nmakes us feel good and euphoric\nvideogames usually start out that way so\nif you stop and think about why is a\nvideo game fun like what makes it fun\nit's because there's something going on\nwith your with the way that you're\ninteracting with the game and there's\nsome degree of engagement that causes\nthis dopamine release to happen\nin your brain and so that's what makes a\ngame fun the interesting thing is the\nmore I work with gamers and you guys may\nfeel like this is this happened to you\ntoo there are three discrete phases that\na gamer goes through when they play a\ngame\nthe first phase tends to be when the\ngame is actively fun like the more you\nplay you're actually enjoying yourself\nit's a lot of fun you want to keep\nplaying it and then over time we're\ntalking more like months or years not\ndays as you continue to game regularly\nyour brain starts to adapt to that\nsteady degree of dopamine release and\nour brain has a very normal mechanism\ncalled homeostasis where it tries to\nmaintain kind of a balanced state so one\nof the ways that homeostasis manifests\nis a biological principle we call\ntolerance so if you think about someone\nwho drinks for the first time the\nalcohol really like they can get drunk\nreally quick but if you start to drink\non a regular basis your body develops\ntolerance to the alcohol it takes more\nand more alcohol to make you feel like\nyou're drunk because what's happening is\nyour body is starting to make itself\nless sensitive to the effects of alcohol\nand gaming is actually no different so\nin the first phase of gaming our body\nreally hasn't acclimatized to that\ndopamine release so it starts to feel\nreally really fun in the second phase we\nstart to develop tolerance to that\nconstant stream of dopamine and so what\nhappens is the game starts to be less\nfun when you're playing the game you're\nnot having as much fun as when you used\nto in the second phase it doesn't really\ngive us a high but it can still remove a\nlow so some people when they game when\nthey start to first when they first\nstart gaming they feel like they're\nhaving fun they feel like it's kind of\nlike a high and then in the second phase\neven though you don't feel the high if\nyou're feeling bad and you start to game\nyou can make those negative feelings go\naway so if you're feeling stressed out\nif you're feeling frustrated if you're\nfeeling pissed off then there's a chance\nthat when you play the game those\nfeelings will kind of go into the\nbackground and we'll talk a little bit\nmore about emotions so in the first\nphase it's kind of giving you a positive\nmotion in the second phase it's getting\nrid of a negative emotion if people\ncontinue to game what actually happens\nis they enter this third phase which is\nwhich is also true biological addictions\nwhere it doesn't even take away the\nnegative emotions and some of you guys\nfeel like you're kind of trapped in your\ngaming it's not even fun for you anymore\nbut you somehow don't know how to stop\ndoing it you don't even have fun with it\nbut it's like you can't you just can't\ndo anything else and it's not like you\nactually enjoy your gaming it's just you\ncan't stop\nand if you've reached that point where\nthe game doesn't even if you play a game\nfor 12 hours a day and you actually stop\nand think you're not even having fun\nduring those 12 hours that's really when\nyou've started to develop a biological\naddiction and so what does that actually\nmean what's going on in your brain so it\nstarts off with when you're playing a\ngame it releases dopamine in this area\ncalled the nucleus accumbens and as the\nbrain gets used to that dopamine release\nit actually starts to decrease its\nsensitivity to receive that dopamine\nsignal so it's kind of like turning the\nvolume down on you know like a radio\nwhere the strength of the signal of the\nradio is the same no matter whether the\nvolume is up or the volume is down but\nyou can change the way that that signal\nis manifested by adjusting the volume so\nit's like your brain is actually turning\ndown the volume on your dopamine\ncircuitry because it's getting so much\ndopamine all the time overtime this\nleads to this state called dopamine\nexhaustion where your body is so\nchronically used to having that high\nlevel of dopamine from the game that the\nvolume is turned way down and that\ncauses huge problems for gamers because\nother things that you would normally\nfind fun start to become less fun\nbecause your dopamine tolerance is so\nhigh and you've hit this point of\ndopamine exhaustion when I work with\ngamers and you guys let me know if you\nfeel the same way a lot of what they\ntell me is that the game actually isn't\nas fun as it used to be but if they try\nto do other things they don't find those\nother things as fun as well it's like\nthings that like going out to front with\nfor dinner is like kind of fun or they\nused to do other things like they used\nto maybe play like pickup football or\nthey used to watch more movies or\nsomething like that but that even other\nactivities outside of gaming become less\nfun and that's really really dangerous\nbecause when gamers when you try to stop\ngaming what you have to do is you have\nto do something else instead so you're\ngetting out of the house more but the\nproblem is that when you get out of the\nhouse and you try to do something that\nother people consider fun you may find\nthat you actually don't feel like that\nactivity is fun and at that point the\ngamer concludes oh I don't like X Y or Z\nI don't like going to an art museum\nbecause it isn't as fun as the game I\ndon't like going for a hike or I don't\nlike hanging out with these other people\nbecause it's just not as fun what you\nneed to realize as a gamer is that when\nyou feel like it's not as fun there's\nactually a change in your neuro\nchemistry that's going to make it so\nthat any activity that you do that you\nwould normally find enjoyable is gonna\nbe dulled because of the way that games\nhave exhausted your dopamine circuitry\nand so what you really have to do and\nthis is why it's so hard to quit gaming\nis give yourself time away from the game\nand then your body will reset its\nhomeostasis to have kind of a normal\ndopamine level and once that reset\nhappens and that can take somewhere\nbetween probably three weeks and two\nmonths to be completely honest you\nshould start to get some change within\none week but like by three weeks you\nshould have a decent change and by two\nmonths you should have it kind of be\ncompletely back to normal during that\nperiod of time you just have to\nrecognize that anything else that you do\nmay be less fun because of the way that\nyour dopamine neurocircuitry has been\nchanged and so when you're thinking\nabout gaming first ask yourself did you\ngo through these phases did I first find\nthat games were a lot of fun did I then\nfind that games weren't as fun but if I\nwas having a bad day they still kind of\nmade me feel better and then the third\nphase is if you've hit the point where\nyou're playing games and you don't even\nknow why you're playing them anymore you\ndon't even find them fun but you can't\nstop\nthen chances are you've got this\ndopamine circuitry exhaustion problem\nand then understand that when you try to\ngo out into the real world and find\nalternatives to gaming because of the\nway that your dopamine circuits have\nbeen exhausted you're not going to find\nthat stuff as fun and if you actually\ngive yourself a couple of weeks or a\ncouple of months you'll start to enjoy\nactivities in a different way that has\nnothing to do with your preferences or\nyour likes or your dislikes it all has\nit has everything to do with what your\nbrain is actually capable of in terms of\nfeeling enjoyment"
