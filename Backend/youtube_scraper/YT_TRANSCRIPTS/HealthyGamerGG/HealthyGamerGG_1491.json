    "transcript": "one of the things that it's really\nimportant to understand is that\neverything that we do in life shapes us\nin some way our experiences get planted\nin our brain and then our brain learns\nfrom them and changes the way that we\ninteract with the world so one of the\nthings that it's really important for\ngamers to understand is how does playing\ngames shape the person that you are what\nis playing games teach your brain and\nthen how does your brain use that\ninformation or that knowledge from\nplaying games and approach the real\nworld so one of the things that I think\nit's really important for gamers to\nunderstand is that they're very good\nclosed-ended problem solvers and I think\nthis is a big problem for a lot of\ngamers is that they're good at a certain\nkind of problem solving but playing a\nlot of games actually puts them in the\ndirection or makes them better at a\ncertain kind of problem solving and\nactually makes them worse at a different\nkind of problem solving which I call\nopen-ended problem solving so I guess\nthe first question is what do I mean by\nclosed-ended problem solving an\nopen-ended problem solving so let's\nthink a little bit about what happens\nwithin a game in a game we have a\nparticular objective and we're given a\nset of tools or assets like you have a\ncharacter a character has certain kinds\nof abilities or if you're playing\nsomething like an RPG you have a team of\ncharacters if you're playing like a\nsport a game like NHL or a football game\nor something like that you've got a team\nof different assets and you have to\nfigure out how to use that team of\npeople or that group of assets to\naccomplish a certain objective if you\nthink about a game there's a particular\ngoal and you're sort of given a\nparticular set of rules and you have to\nuse that set of rules to achieve that\ngoal if you're playing Mario for example\nyou can't open a lemonade stand it's\njust not something that you can do in\nthe game if you're playing World of\nWarcraft you can't build a spaceship\nthere are certain limits that the game\nprovides us with and gamers are really\ngood at coming up with an optimal\nsolution\nif they're given a particular sandbox to\nwork in so I'll give you guys a prime\nexample about a year ago I was taking\nthis class at Harvard Business School\ncalled value-based healthcare this was a\nclass that was for a bunch of physicians\nwho were sort of trying to learn the\nbusiness side of medicine and in this\nclass we did these cases so with what\nhappens in the classes they give you\nlike this twenty or thirty page case in\nthis case was about optimizing flow\nthrough our urology office so when a\npatient goes to you see a urologist they\nget checked in by the receptionist they\nhave to fill in some paperwork they get\ntaken to a room they see a nurse for a\nlittle while and then the doctor comes\nin the doctor does a procedure and then\nthe patient like kind of goes to a\ndifferent room where do they get\nmonitored for a little while and then\nthey get checked out by the receptionist\nthey pay their bill and they leave so\nthere's a certain flow through the\noffice in this case was all about how\ncan we optimize the flow through the\noffice to sort of create the most value\nand how can we sort of make it so that\nwe're getting the most bang out of our\nbuck and so one of the things that I was\nkind of surprised about is I was working\nwith a couple of gamers at the time and\nI actually sort of told them about the\ncase and I said so here's the scenario\nwe've got this urologist office we have\nthree urologists we've got five nurses\nwe've got two receptionists how can you\noptimize this the flow through the\noffice so that the most patients get\nseen in the shortest amount of time and\nin my gamer friends that I was kind of\ntalking about this with came up with a\ncouple of solutions and then I went into\nclass the next day and when people were\nasking about you know how you go about\ndoing things I offered those solutions\nand it turned out that those were some\nof the best solutions in the class I was\na little bit surprised by this because\nhere's a group of people and this this\nclass was offered for only it was at\nHarvard Business School and offered to\nHarvard physician trainees so arguably\nsome of the brightest people in the\ncountry and how is it that a group of\ngamers who know nothing about neurology\nand nothing about medicine were able to\ncome up with optimal solutions when they\nreally don't know anything about the\nscenario and it's\ncuz games teach gamers how to do this\nkind of closed ended problem solving\nthis problem solving where you have a\nparticular goal and a particular set of\ntools and gamers are really good at\noptimizing from A to Z and that's\nsomething that they're good at\nin other situations too for example some\nof the gamers that I talk to are really\ngood at things like consulting or\nthey're the people in their offices that\npeople that-that their bosses go to when\nthere's a problem because they're\nrecognized for their problem-solving\ncapability the problem though for a lot\nof you guys is that a lot of the\nproblems a lot of those challenges that\ngamers suffer from are not closed-ended\nproblems they're what I call open-ended\nproblems open-ended problems or problems\nthat don't really have a particular\nsandbox so an example of an open-ended\nproblem is like gaining financial\nindependence what does that really mean\nlike how do you get financial\nindependence well it may involve certain\npieces like finding a job or moving out\nof your parents place or things like\nthat but gamers really struggle with any\nkind of problem that doesn't have a\nparticular set of tools or a particular\nend goal they struggle with things that\nare really abstract and that's if you\nthink about it a lot of the things that\nyou're able to do in life if someone can\ngive you a particular goal and give you\na set of tools you're actually probably\nyou're going to be able to get from\npoint A to point Z when gamers run into\ndifficulty it's because they don't\nreally know where point Z is they have\ntrouble with sort of this abstract idea\nof financial independence because those\nkind of abstractions don't exist within\ngames and when our brain spends a lot of\ntime playing a game it starts to\noptimize working within that kind of\nframework within a closed-ended\nframework so a lot of the problems that\ngamers have tend to be things like\ngaining financial independence finding a\ngirlfriend getting in shape these are\nall sort of broad abstract things that\ngamers have a lot of trouble actually\nexecuting\nthe funny thing about this is that you\nmay think that that's because gamers are\nnot motivated or they'll say things like\nI'm lazy or I'm not motivated but the\nmore that I've worked with gamers the\nmore that I realized that open-ended\nproblem-solving is actually a skill set\nthat can be learned and that can be\ntaught and that because gamers spend so\nmuch time playing video games they\nactually lose out on the opportunities\nto learn this kind of problem solving\nI'll give you guys an example so if I\ntell a four-year-old to clean their room\nthat's kind of like an abstract goal you\nwe can all it's simple for us because we\nknow what a clean room looks like but a\nfour-year-old has a lot of trouble\ntaking that abstract concept of a clean\nroom which even though they understand\nwhat a clean room looks like they have\ntrouble actually figuring out how to get\nfrom point A to point Z they can tell\nthe difference between a clean room in a\ndirty room they just don't know how to\nmove from one to the other so what you\nhave to do with a four-year-old is you\nhave to tell them okay let's clean the\nroom together so let's take all of your\nbooks and put them together and put them\non the bookshelf let's take two all your\nstuffed animals and put them in the\nstuffed animal box and let's take all\nyour crayons and your papers and put\nthem in your desk drawer you have to\nactually walk them through the steps of\ncreating a clean room they can't do that\nkind of they can't take the abstract\nproblem and break it down into pieces\nand that breaking down into pieces is\nwhat what I call operationalizing so\nit's the the process of taking an\nabstract problem and creating an\noperation of moving from point A to Z so\nfor example if we wanted to\noperationalize like let's say financial\nindependence we start to break that\nprocess down so financial independence\ninvolves having a bank account where you\ncan pay rent and having a place to live\nand so what we can do is break that down\ninto two pieces and then those two can\nbe further operationalized so finding a\nplace to live involves looking it for\nplaces to live first and then making\ndecisions like do I want a roommate do I\nnot want a room\ndo I want to live downtown or do I want\nto live in the suburbs there are a lot\nof different pieces to each of those\nthings and as we break down financial\nindependence into lots of different\npieces that's the process of\noperationalizing when we're talking\nabout the four year old when we help\nthem what we actually do is\noperationalize the problem for them and\nthe reason that gamers have trouble the\nreason that you guys have problems is\nbecause if you think about it video\ngames actually do all of the\noperationalizing for you they've figured\nout what all of the pieces are and so\ngamers are really good at putting the\npieces together but they're they really\nstruggle with figuring out what the\npieces are so a lot of the problems that\ngamers have are you know they think that\nit lazy and that's the reason that they\ndon't get a job but the more that I've\nworked with you guys the more that I\nrealized your brain actually has not\nbeen able to operationalize that problem\nfor you and since you can't\noperationalize it you kind of don't know\nwhere to start so I could ask you like\nhow do you find a job and you could tell\nme a couple of things but even though\nyou're able to rationally understand\nthat there's a part of your brain called\nyour frontal lobes which does your\nplanning which is the part of your brain\nthat lets you plan and execute actions\nwhich actually gamers have frontal lobes\nthat are sort of underdeveloped and the\nreason that they have frontal lobes that\nare underdeveloped is because the game\ndoes that work for you it does the\nprocess of figuring out level 1 level 2\nlevel 3 level 4 level 5 with level 6 you\ndon't have to figure out which order to\ndo the levels it's already sort of\nchunked up for you and so this is why\ngamers sort of struggle a lot with\nabstract problem solving or open-ended\nproblems because those are the things\nthat usually people require to move\nforward in life in a little bit we'll\ndig into another example of how like\nanother group of people which has\nactually doctors who also struggle with\nopen-ended problem-solving and I'll show\nyou guys that open-ended problem-solving\nis actually has nothing to do with\nintelligence has nothing to do with with\nlaziness but it's actually all a learned\nskill so in the same way that we can\nthe four-year-old how to break down the\nabstract problem into pieces we can\nactually teach you guys how to break\ndown an abstract problem of financial\nindependence or finding a girlfriend\ninto pieces and if we can transform an\nopen-ended problem into a closed-ended\nproblem then your analytical mind will\ntake over and you guys will have no\nproblem whatsoever\nany questions"
