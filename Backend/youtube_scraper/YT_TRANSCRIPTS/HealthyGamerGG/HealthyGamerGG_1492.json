    "transcript": "one of the biggest problems\nthat gamers have is moving into the real\nworld and doing things outside of the\ngame I mean if you guys could do\nwhatever you wanted to outside of the\nvideo game you wouldn't be here you\nwouldn't be listening to me and that's a\nperfectly reasonable problem to have as\ncrazy as that sounds and what I'd like\nto do is start by digging into where\ndoes that come from why is it that you\nguys may have things that you want to do\nbut have trouble actually doing you have\nhopes you have desires you have dreams\nyou even know what you shouldn't be\ndoing but you have trouble doing it and\nso in my view the way to actually get\ncontrol of that the way to control your\nbehavior and start doing the things that\nyou want to be doing that you know you\nshould be doing is to understand where\nthat problem comes from in order to\nunderstand how to fix something we have\nto understand what's actually wrong and\nI think a lot of the paralysis that\ngamers have in doing things outside of a\nvideo game actually comes from the way\nthat they're treated when they're very\nyoung\na lot of gamers are smart data actually\nshows that the average gamer is actually\nsmarter than the rest of the average\npopulation that you guys have higher IQs\nthan the rest of the average person and\nso what I found working with gamers is\nthat a lot of gamers when they grow up\nthey're told that they're smart and so\nkids when they're told they're smart\nsomething very interesting happens they\nstart to develop this identity that I'm\na smart kid and when they start to\ndevelop an identity that they're a smart\nkid they start to do things that\nreinforce that identity and stay away\nfrom things that contrast with that\nidentity so for example if I'm a smart\nkid I want to do things that other\npeople are gonna perceive is smart but\nif there's something I'm not very good\nat if there's something that I try and\nis gonna make me look stupid a kid is\nactually not going to do that and so\nover time what starts to happen is the\nsmart kid only does things that make him\nappear to be smart which means that\nthings that are generally speaking\neasier and stays away from things that\nare\nhard for them and so this works out fine\nuntil they're like in third grade fourth\ngrade fifth grade because is a smart kid\nyou don't have to spend a whole lot of\ntime studying you can just do the things\nthat you want to and everyone like your\nyour parents or your teachers or your\nfamily or family friends are all gonna\nsay oh look at that kid he's so bright\nbut over time what happens is those\nkinds of kids start to avoid challenging\nthings because whenever they do\nsomething that's challenging they feel\nstupid and that's not who you are right\nbecause you're a smart guy and I know\nall of you guys think you're smart you\nthink you're super geniuses and the\nfunny thing is that's true but as I'm\nsure you guys know being smart isn't\nenough so let's kind of go back a little\nbit to this idea of a smart kid doing\nonly things that they feel is smart and\nso when they do that what happens is\nthey start to avoid difficult things and\nas the kid gets older that avoidance\nbecomes kind of baked in it becomes a\npart of who they are in how they move\naround in the world and so this\navoidance actually starts at a very\nyoung age and if you stop and think\nabout it the hardest things for gamers\nto do the hardest thing for you to do is\nsomething where you're being observed by\nother people and you feel incompetent\nand why is it that that bothers you so\nmuch even if those are people that you\ndon't care about even if you're never\ngonna see them again it's really hard\nfor you to do anything where other\npeople see how incompetent you are and\nso what happens is gamers they run away\nfrom any sort of experience that that\nmakes them feel less than smart or where\nthey feel kind of silly or incompetent\nand that actually paralyzes you in life\nbecause most of the things that you do\nin life you're gonna suck at at the very\nbeginning and so if that's the case if\nthat resonates with you the next natural\nquestion is if this problem starts\nbecause you have a kid who has built up\nthis ego of them being smart in order to\npreserve that ego they actually avoid\ndoing anything that that they have to\nlearn how to do they only do the simple\nthings then you end up where where are\nyou guys\nare now which is that you know you\nshould do a lot of things but it's\nreally hard for you to do them because\nof the way that you feel judged so how\ndo you get around that the first way you\nget around that is by reframing a little\nbit so in the world we tend to value\nintelligence and we say like oh so for\nexample I'm I'm a faculty member at\nHarvard Medical School and so when I\nwhen people learn that they're the first\nthing that they say is you must be so\nsmart and it's true like I'm a pretty\nsmart guy but I'm actually probably not\na whole lot smarter than you guys are\nthe what the world actually values in\nrewards is experience incompetence\nbecause if you think about it\na lot of people are really smart but\nthey actually don't amount to much and\nthat's probably the way that you feel\nright now you feel that despite being so\nsmart you're not able to accomplish a\nwhole lot in life in 95 percent of\ngamers when I talk to them about that\nthey say that it's because I'm lazy and\nwill dig into lazy but for now I want to\nfocus a little bit on reframing from\nsmart or stupid to experience an\ninexperience so the more that in your\nmind you can realize that actually your\nsuccess has nothing to do with your\nintelligence it has to do with your\nexperience or inexperience and the\ndegree of competence you have the better\noff you're gonna be so I encourage all\nof you guys to think about what you want\nto do and try to tell yourself try to\nreframe in your mind that it's not that\nI'm smart or I'm stupid but that I'm\nexperienced or inexperienced and the\nmore that you can start to approach\nsituations like that like let's say\napplying for a job you can say oh I suck\nat interviews but interviews require\npractice and the more you practice at\ninterviewing the better off you're gonna\nbe and so I encourage all of you guys if\nyou're feeling paralyzed in life if\nyou're feeling like you can't move out\ninto the world and do the things that\nyou want or should do - first look at\nyourself and ask yourself is the\nroadblock to me moving forward because I\nfeel judged because I feel stupid\nand if\nthe answer to that question which I\nguess is yes then the first solution\nthat you have to do is a change in your\nmindset don't think of yourself as\nstupid think of yourself as\ninexperienced in the neat thing about\nthat is that the more you think of\nyourself is inexperienced the more you\nnaturally realize that the solution to\ninexperience is to try things and the\nfunny thing is that when you try things\nand you accept that you're inexperienced\nyou're actually okay failing and if you\nreally look at yourselves I would bet\nmoney that the problem that you have is\nthat you can't tolerate the idea of\nfailing but if you can reframe to\ninexperience\nthen failure is kind of a normal part of\nit right you've got to learn you've got\nto stumble a couple of times before you\nlearn how to walk and if you guys can\nmake that shift I think that's gonna be\nthe first step to you being able to move\nforward in the world and kind of\novercome that obstacle of feeling like\nyou're stupid or feeling like you're\njudged"
