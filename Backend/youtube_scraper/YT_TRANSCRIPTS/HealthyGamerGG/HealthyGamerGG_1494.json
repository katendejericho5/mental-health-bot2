    "transcript": "so the first question that\ngamer's ask me is do I have a problem am\nI actually addicted to video games and\nthat's actually the best question to\nstart off with how do you know whether\nyour gaming is just a normal part of\nyour life it's a way of having fun it's\na form of recreation or is it a problem\nis it actually an addiction and it kind\nof makes sense I mean it's a tricky\nquestion because gaming actually offers\nus a lot of positive things in life if\nwe think about it gaming serves as a\nform of recreation it's something that\nyou do with your friends it serves as a\nway to de-stress and actually cope with\nproblems it serves as a way to connect\nwith other human beings and form\nrelationships and so it's a completely\nreasonable question to ask you know is\nthe gaming that I do like when I play\nlet's say a whole weekend of World of\nWarcraft after a week of finals is that\na problem when I game for 12 hours a day\non Saturday and Sunday after studying my\nass off for the semester is that a\nproblem and it's it's a great question\nand I think at the end of the day the\nanswer is relatively simple if it's\ncausing a problem it is a problem in\npsychiatry we we have one very simple\nline that if you cross that line we say\nthat you've got an illness and that line\nis simply does it impair your function\ndoes it actually get in the way of\nsomething that you want to do so if we\ntake a look at for example distressing\nwe see that you know if I have a long\nday and I go home and I play video games\nthat's kind of a healthy coping\nmechanism but let's say that I have a\njob that's super stressful and then I go\nhome and I play games for hours to kind\nof decompress from that job and the next\nday I go to the job and it's super\nstressful and I come home and I\ndecompress and that goes on for days and\nweeks and months that's a problem if\nyou're not changing your life in any way\nif the gaming is getting in the way of\nyou talking to your boss about why your\njob is a problem if your gaming is\nin the way of you trying to find another\njob that's not so stressful then I'd say\nit is a problem if you're gaming it's\nfine to use gaming is a coping mechanism\nin a way to de-stress from your day but\nif you're not actually dealing with the\nsources of your stress if you're not\nactually improving things and you're\nkind of ignoring a problem or letting a\nproblem fester then I think gaming is a\nproblem so just to sum up you know if\nyou guys are asking yourself the\nquestion am i addicted to video games I\nwould ask you is your gaming getting in\nthe way of things that you want to do is\nyour gaming getting in the way of your\nacademic performance are you not doing\nas well in school as you should be\nbecause you're playing video games is it\ngetting in the way of your professional\nsuccess are you not getting promoted or\nare you not looking for a better job\nare you not switching fields are you not\ngrowing in a professional capacity\nbecause you spend so much time gaming is\ngaming interfering with your physical\nhealth are you gaining too much weight\nshould you be losing weight is gaming\ngetting in the way of your sleep or do\nyou are you not able to run a mile\ncomfortably if gaming is impairing if\nyou're spending so much time gaming that\nyou're not actually taking care of\nyourself physically that's a problem\ndoes gaming create problems in your\nrelationships are you not able to find a\nromantic partner like a girlfriend or\nsomething like that because you spend so\nmuch time gaming is gaming stressing\ncreating stress between let's say you\nand your parents they think you spend\ntoo much time gaming you think you spend\njust the right amount of time Gaming is\nthere some problem that's happening in\nyour relationship because of your gaming\nif the answer to any of those questions\nis yes then I think your gaming is a\nproblem the most subtle problem that a\nlot of gamers actually end up with is\nactually that gaming prevents their\ncreative pursuits so I've met a lot of\ngamers who are really smart and I'm sure\nyou guys all all of you have either a\ngreat idea for a video game or a great\nidea for a startup or you have some sort\nof great idea for a novel that you want\nright or you have this sci-fi TV show\nthat you think would be absolutely\nawesome but you never actually worked\ntowards it you never actually sit down\nand start to write the opening scene of\nyour TV show because you spend so much\ntime gaming and I think that that's\nactually the most dangerous and\ninsidious part of a video game addiction\nis that it actually prevents you from\nbecoming the person that you actually\nwant to be in this world sure the game\nis fun and you enjoy playing it but five\nyears down the road are you gonna be\nhappy with where you are or would you\nhave rather spent some of that time\ndoing something else and if the answer\nto that question is yes I would rather\nhave spent my time doing something else\nthen you've got a problem and that's\nwhat I'm here to help you with"
