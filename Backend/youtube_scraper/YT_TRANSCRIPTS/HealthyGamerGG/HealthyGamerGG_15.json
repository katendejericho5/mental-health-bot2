    "transcript": "see when someone is abused there's a\nreally tricky tight RPP because on the\none hand it's not your fault right\nclearly like no one deserves to be the\nvictim of abuse I don't buy that and at\nthe same time there's a really tricky\nbalance between that and agency so do\nyou have power in the relationship or\nnot so the moment that you give up power\nand there may be a power Dynamic\nabsolutely but the moment that you give\nup all of your power then you're in big\ntrouble so literally what happens if you\nlook at the psychology of abusers what\nthey will try to do is cut away people's\nIndependence and their sense of power\nthey will try to trick people into\nthinking that they are powerless best\nway to trick someone is to add kernels\nof truth right so if you look at\nsomething like a magic trick like 90% of\nwhat a magician shows you in a magic\ntrick is exactly what you see it's the\n10% that's left that is completely false\nand that's where all the money is and\nthat's how it is in an abusive\nrelationship too"
