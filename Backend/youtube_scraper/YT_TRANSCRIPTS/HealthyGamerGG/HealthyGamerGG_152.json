    "transcript": "I know this sounds really bizarre but\nthe strategy that I tend to use with my\npatience is to pick your battles so\ninstead of just randomly resisting the\ncraving and then ultimately giving into\nit which will intensify the craving the\nnext time you step into the ring what we\nreally want to do is almost schedule our\npornography use so one of the things\nthat I'll do with my patients is sort of\npick two times throughout the day where\nthey are allowed to watch pornography\nthis has a very interesting effect the\nfirst is that during outside of those\nwindows it becomes easier to resist but\neven then they're resisting a little bit\nit becomes easier to win the Battle of\npushing the pornography until 11:00 a.m.\nand 6:00 p.m. let's say at 8 or 9: in\nthe morning you get this little impulse\nand you kind of push it till 11:00 a.m.\nso you're actually strengthening and\ntraining your frontal lobe and then when\n11:00 a.m. rolls around you can sort of\nengage in it the pattern that I tend to\nsee in behavioral addictions is that\nmoderation is more accessible it's more\ndoable with pornography addicts I'm able\nto see more success in this way"
