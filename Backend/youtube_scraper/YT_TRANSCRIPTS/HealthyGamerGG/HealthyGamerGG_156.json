    "transcript": "if you resist a craving and end up\ngiving in your brain learns this is the\nsignal that I send to this person in\norder to get what I need so your brain\nstarts paradoxically amplifying the\nCravings because it knows that I need to\ngo straight to a high level so that we\ncan skip all these first steps because\nthis is what gets me what I need and\nthis isn't just your brain doing this in\nthe case of of addictions we even do\nthis normally for example if you have a\nfamily member who's deaf right you start\nby calling their name you're like hey\nbuddy and they don't hear you and then\nyou raise the volume you say hey bud\nthey don't hear you and then if they're\ndeaf you start yelling and that's when\nthey hear you if you do that a couple\ntimes your brain will stop talking to\nthem in a normal voice it'll realize\nwhat signal it needs to create to get\nthe response that it wants so our brain\nis designed to get needs met and\nparadoxically if you try to resist\ncravings and fail your brain will\nintensify the Cravings to get what it\nneeds"
