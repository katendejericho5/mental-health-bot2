    "transcript": "the more empathic you are we see that it\nwill burn you out if you are in a caring\nprofession if you are in a caring\nrelationship if you have friends\nPartners spouses you try to support them\nmore and more it will worsen your mental\nand lead to burnout and in severe\npotential cases even lead to Vicarious\ntrauma so a lot of people nowadays are\ntalking about how empathy is fantastic\nwe should have more empathy we should\nhave empathy for our friends empathy for\nour work colleagues empathy for our\nrelationships empathy for the whole\nworld and the more impa EIC we are the\nmore emotionally available we are the\nbetter it will be there will be articles\non this everywhere I look so articles in\nHarvard Business review and you'll even\nhave people like this like psychiatrists\non the internet who will talk about how\nbeing more empathic will benefit you and\nisn't even about helping other people\nbut it turns out that having empathy is\nincredibly dangerous having high levels\nof empathy is correlated with higher\nlevels of burnout leads to worsening\nmental health actually allows people to\nobjectively take advantage of you and\nmost bizarrely of all can negatively\nimpact your relationships especially\nromantic relationships we're going to\nstart with this concept of emotional\ncontagion so this is really fascinating\nbut as people have gotten more\ninterested in empathy over time we've\nbasically discovered that there are\nmultiple kinds of empathy so one is\nsomething called cognitive empathy which\nis the ability to understand what\nsomeone else thinks or believes so it's\nsort of understanding what's in\nsomeone's head and there's a second kind\nof empathy called affective empathy and\nthis is more in line with what people\nusually think of when we think of\nempathy it's the ability to feel what\nsomeone else feels but as researchers\nhave looked into affective empathy\nespecially they've started to realize\nthat there is a huge problem with this\nfacet is that it leads to something\ncalled emotional contagion so what\nhappens when you are very empathic with\nanother person when you have affective\nempathy is they are feeling negative in\nsome way they're feeling sad they're\nfeeling depressed they're feeling\nhopeless and due to the empathic\ncircuits of your brain in order to form\na connection with this person you absorb\nsome of their negativity and literally\nin the scientific literature this is\ncalled emotional contagion and so what\nends up happening when you are empathic\nwith someone is you absorb some of their\nnegativity and it actually negatively\naffects you and this emotional contagion\ncan lead to an incredible amount of\nburnout because just because you're\nfeeling what they're feeling it doesn't\nnecessarily help them feel better much\nlike another kind of contagion like an\ninfection when you get infected by\nsomeone else it doesn't reduce the\namount of infection that someone else\nfeels and a lot of research on empathy\nshows that when once this contagion\nhappens you basically suffer and it\ndoesn't necessarily lead to a benefit in\nother people so if we look at\nprofessions that involve a lot of\nempathy as part of their job like people\nlike social workers who are working with\npeople who are struggling in their life\nwhat we tend to find is that between 50\nand 75% of social workers are actually\nburnt out and one of the reasons that\nthey're burnt out is because of all of\nthe emotions that they're constantly\ndealing with we see a lot of this in\nalso something called caregiver burnout\nthese are not just professionals but\nwhen you have someone who is taking care\nof someone else so you have a family\nmember or friend who is struggling a lot\nand caregiver burnout was originally\nstudied in things like cancer so when\nyou have a spouse who has cancer you\ntake care of them a lot you're you know\ntaking care of all the responsibilities\nand that sort of leads to burnout but\nwe're seeing caregiver burnout also in\nmental health related issues with people\nlike friends or romantic Partners or\neven parents or children this emotional\ncontagion also has pretty specific\nmanifestations and a great example of\nthis is something called vicarious\ntrauma so we have studies that show that\nwhen you is a an empath or someone who\nis supporting someone else continuously\ngets exposed to their trauma you can\nexhibit symptoms of experiencing that\ntrauma yourself this is why we call it\nvicarious trauma it's as if you were\ntraumatized through simply having an\nempathic connection with someone who is\ntraumatized now this is an evolutionary\nthing that probably it helps us in some\nways so we know that for example parents\nexperience this with children who are\nsick or injured in some way and in those\nkinds of situations it's probably pretty\nhelpful but we know that vicarious\ntrauma can also affect people like\ntherapists if they're not careful they\ncan actually suffer from the trauma of\ntheir patients the really scary thing is\nthat we are seeing this principle play\nout in an entirely new way because of\nthe internet so the internet has become\na place where we really advocate for\nhaving a safe space to share and speak\nmy truth and share the traumatic things\nthat I've done we'll see this a lot on\nmental in mental health communities and\ndiscussions and on social media where\npeople are sharing their trauma and\nwhat's happened is really interesting\neven though we want the internet to be a\nplace where you can share your trauma\nand we want to accept you and help you\nheal and all that good stuff on the flip\nside we have people getting triggered by\ntrauma dumping and it's like bruh you're\ntrauma dumping I can't handle this right\nnow and I think what we've sort of\nfigured out is in creating some of these\nsafe spaces we've gotten people who will\nessentially vomit their trauma and then\nthat negatively affects the audience the\nperson who's listening and there's\nresearch to back this up and I'm even\nseeing this in a very very like new way\nwhich is almost trauma through repeated\nsocial media exposure so it's almost\nlike vicarious trauma that is\nexperienced through social media so if\nyou look at social media what you'll see\nis that there's a lot of like really\nterrible stuff that we get exposed to\nand the better of a person you are the\nmore likely you are to expose yourself\nto traumatic things right because you\ncare about these people people these\nrefugees these people who are starving\nthese people who have been taken\nadvantage of victims of different kinds\nof violence and oppression and we want\nto like spread awareness and we want to\nhelp people understand and we want to\nshare what's going on these tragedies\nbecause we as a world should do\nsomething about this and so the Kinder\nyou are the more empathic you are the\nmore that you expose yourself to this I\nam seeing something very scary which is\nvicarious trauma through social media\nand we're seeing evidence of this the US\nSurgeon General recently put out a kind\nof a a beautiful oped where he was\nadvocating for putting a warning on\nsocial media platforms for the dangers\nto mental health so as you're empathic\nit can actually lead to a social media\ninduced vicarious trauma that damages\nyou and will worsen your mental health\nthis is all a roundabout way of saying\nthat the more empathic you are we see\nthat it will burn you out if you are in\na caring profession if you are in a\ncaring relationship if you have friends\nPartners spouses you try to support them\nmore and more it will worsen your mental\nand lead to burnout and in severe\npotential cases even lead to Vicarious\ntrauma so that's the first danger but it\ngets better so it's not just about\nabsorbing the emotional contagion of\nother people it turns out that the more\nempathic you are the more likely you are\nto be taken advantage of and if you're\nsomeone who's a highly sensitive person\nif you're someone who's very empathic\nyou've already figured this out that\npeople take advantage of your kindness\nthey create these double standards where\nyou understand the pain that they're\ngoing through when they get dumped and\nso you're there for them you're\nsupporting them but when the situation\nis reversed and you need support they're\nso callous that they don't actually\nbother to help you they're like I don't\nhave time for this they set limits with\nyou but are upset when you set limits\nwith them and if this is kind of the\nexperience of a lot of people what a lot\nof people will say is oh it's your fault\nright this is all in your head you need\nto get better at setting boundaries\nthings are way more even this is the\ncallous person that you're friends with\nwill say no no no this is actually 50/50\nyou just don't realize it so it turns\nout that there are studies fascinating\nstudies that actually demonstrate very\nclearly that the more empathic you are\nthe more likely you are to be screwed in\nlife so I'm going to share one of these\nwith you okay super cool study so in\nthis study it requires a couple of\ndifferent things so we have two people\nokay and we have let's say $100 and in\nthis experiment what we do is we give\nthe $100 to one person and we say to\nperson number one you have to divide\nthis $100 into two groups and then you\nhave to offer one of these amounts to\nthe other person if the second person\naccepts the way that you split the money\nboth of you get to keep the money the\nway that you split it so if I give if I\ngive you $100 and you decide okay like\nlet's say it's me and you okay so let's\nsay I have the $100 okay and I'm going\nto split it with you so I say okay I'm\ngoing to take $50 and you take $50 do\nyou accept if you accept you actually\nget the $50 and I get the $50 if you do\nnot accept neither of us gets money\nthat's the way that the experiment is\ndesigned okay so what we discover is\nthat most people if you have a\nrelatively normal amount of empathy will\nsplit things 50/50 because that's fair\nright I get 50 free bucks you get 50\nfree bucks it's all good the second that\nyou add a little bit of sociopathy into\nthe mix things start to change because\nhere I am I'm a sociopath right and so\nI'm thinking to myself well this is like\nfree money either way so what I can do\nis I can say how about 6040 I get 60 and\nyou get 40 if this person rejects it\nthey get nothing and if they accept it\nthey at least get 40 free bucks and I\nget 60 free bucks even though it's not\neven you are still benefiting and I'm\nwilling to give you an unfair trade\nknowing that if you turn down my un fair\ntrade we both get screwed so I'm going\nto take advantage of this fact by\nsplitting up the money in an unfair way\nand what we find is that people will\neven split things if you're a real\n[ __ ] you'll split things 90 10 okay\nDr K here's 100 bucks I'm going to keep\n90 and you take 10 if you want to turn\nit down go ahead and turn it down none\nof us gets anything you're going to lose\nout on $10 and if you turn down the\ntrade I may lose out on 90 but you're\ngoing to lose out on 10 it's just free\nmoney just take the trade I'll keep 90\nyou take 10 right it's a win-win for\nboth of us so the more an antisocial you\nare the more likely you are to split\nthings unfairly hey all if you're\ninterested in applying some of the\nprinciples that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday now here's the crazy thing the\nperson's capacity to accept\nan unfair trade depends on their level\nof empathy so the Kinder you are the\nmore likely you are to accept an unfair\ntrade in this scenario so if I'm\nsplitting things 50/50 everyone's going\nto basically accept unless you're a real\n[ __ ] and then you say no I'm not\ngoing to accept unless you give me 90\nand you take 10 right you can kind of\nflip it around but that's not the way\nthe experiment is organized so basically\nwhat happens is most people will sort of\ndefault to 50/50 and in order to accept\nan unfair trade your empathy has to be\nhigh right and so what that basically\nmeans is that the more empathic you are\nthe more likely you are to take an\nuneven or unfair trade now here's the\nreally crazy thing okay so we know that\nthe neurotransmitter serotonin is\nassociated with empathy the higher your\nserotonin is the higher you are to be\nthe more likely you are to be empathic\nas you are content and happy you are\nmore likely to be kind to other people\nso they took this experiment and then\nwhat they did is they gave people ssris\nthese are anti-depressant or\nanti-anxiety medications that boost\nserotone and transmission so this is not\njust a a general personality thing they\nactually administered medication to\nthese people and what they found is when\nyou give someone a serotonin boosting\nmedication they are more likely to\naccept unfair trades the more empathic\nyou are the more likely you are to get\nscrewed by other people this is wild and\nif you're someone who's a highly\nsensitive person or incredibly empathic\nyou know exactly what I'm talking about\nthat your empathy allows other people to\ntake advantage of you but it gets even\nweirder so the other really weird thing\nis if we look at histories of people who\ngrew up abused okay they are more likely\nto be abusive so if I was growing up if\nI was a child growing up in a household\nwhere I was emotionally abused when I\ngrow up I'm more likely to abuse use\nother people and so we may think okay\nthis is just a consequence of trauma but\nit turns out that it's not just the\ntrauma itself it turns out that the more\nempathic you are the more you understand\nyour abuser so as you put yourself in\nyour abuser shoes and then you sort of\nunderstand their perspective there are\ntwo separate things that happen the\nfirst is that you are likely to be\nforgiving of their abusive Behavior okay\nso this is like literally what I've seen\nwhen I work as a psychiatrist and I work\nwith people who are like in unfair or\nunhealthy or abusive relationships what\nthey always do is empathize with their\nabuser so if someone is let's say I'm in\na romantic relationship where someone is\nphysically abusive to me what I'll do is\nI'll say like oh well like I understand\nthey're under so much stress right now\nyou know they've been drinking a lot and\nthat's their unhealthy coping mechanism\nit's something that we're working on you\nknow I understand that their life is\nhard I understand why they would be like\nshort-tempered I understand why they\nwould get angry I understand that they\ngrew up in a household where people were\nphysically abusive to them the more\nempathic I am with them the more likely\nI am to be forgiving for their bad\nbehavior tolerant of their bad behavior\nI empathize with my abuser in the most\nsevere cases of this we see something\ncalled Stockholm syndrome which is\npretty famous but this is when someone\ngets kidnapped and is controlled they\nstart to have positive feelings towards\ntheir abuser and it appears that this is\nall mediated by empathy now it gets even\nweirder than that it turns out that the\nmore empathic you are if you associate\nwith people who are sociopaths the more\nsociopathic you will become there's a\nstudy that looks at this very\nspecifically so they took a group of\npeople Gamers and they had them play a\nvideo game and in one video game they\nplay a character like Superman and in\nanother video game they play a character\nlike the Joker so they play like\nliterally there's a you can play as a\ngood character or you can play as an\nevil character so you play the game for\na while and it's whatever but then they\ndid something really interesting after\nsomeone finished playing the game they\ntested their capacity for empathy and\nthey found that whichever character you\nplay actually shapes the way that you\nthen interact with the world so they\ndiscovered a couple of things the first\nis that if you played as the Joker you\nwere more likely to endorse violent\nsolutions to problems so when you play\nSuperman and someone's like is it okay\nto you know hit someone in the face if\nthey're [ __ ] annoying you and people\nwho play Superman are like no that's not\nokay but if you play The Joker people\nare more likely to say yeah it's okay to\nlike use violence violence is more\njustifiable and more likely to be a\ncourse of action that is acceptable but\nit gets even weirder than that it's even\nat the very very minute level so what\nthey did is they took the people who\nplayed Superman they took the people who\nplayed jok The Joker and they asked them\nto look at neutral facial expressions so\nit's just a facial expr that's neutral\nand people who played Superman would\nlook at this facial expression and say\nthis person is neither angry or happy\nthey're not upset they're not thrilled\nthey're just chilling they're vibing\nthey're neutral but people who played as\nthe Joker are more likely to end\ninterpret neutral facial expressions as\nbeing hostile or negative in some way so\nwhen we sort of act out or empathize\nwith some kind of abusive or negative\nfigure it changes the way that we\nperceive the world and it changes the\nway that we believe things are Justified\nor not justified absolutely wild right\nand this is not just one study I'm\ntelling you guys about this is like one\nstudy that has also been backed up by a\nlot of other studies and then the third\nthing that they measured was how kind\nthese people are after playing this\nvideo game and what they sort of\ndiscovered is they would ask people like\nhow much money would you donate to a\ngood cause and people who play Superman\nare more likely to donate to a good\ncause whereas people play Joker The\nJoker are less likely to donate or would\ndonate a smaller amount so it appears\nthat being empathic towards an evil\nfigure of some in some way actually\nliterally changes the way that we\nperceive the world changes what we think\nis justifiable or acceptable and\nliterally Alters our own kindness\nBehavior the last thing that we're going\nto talk about is super wild because a\nlot of people think that empathy is a\nnet positive for a relationship\nship including this guy but it turns out\nthat empathy can actually be damaging\nfor a relationship and once I explain\nthis to you I hope it makes sense\nbecause once I understood it it clicked\nfor me so beautifully so let's say\nyou're early on in a relationship you're\nnot really committed to each other yet\nyouall have been talking a little bit\nyou've gone on maybe two dates now let's\nsay you're highly empathic okay and so\nearly on in a relationship y'all are not\ndeeply in love y'all are kind of like I\ndon't know if I like this I don't know\nif I don't like this like this person is\ngood in this ways these are a couple of\ngreen flags these are a couple of red\nflags and so the more empathic you are\nthe more sensitive and accurate you are\nat judging your partner's unhappiness\nand let's think about what that would do\nif I've gone on two dates with you and I\nrecognize that you are unhappy with\nthese qualities you don't like me for\nthese reasons maybe you find someone\nelse attractive and there's studies that\nshow that people who are highly empathic\nare early on in relationships accurately\njudge when their partner is attracted to\nsomeone else okay so you someone's like\nhey like hey do you think that hey do\nyou think that that that girl is pretty\ndo you think she's pretty and I'm like\nno no I don't think she's pretty but if\nyou're highly empathic you know that I'm\nbullshitting you can read you can read\nwhat I'm sort of really experiencing you\nfeel that empathy because your empathy\ncircuits are strong you're a mind reader\nand you actually recognize that I do\nthink that that chick is attractive so\nwhat impact do you think this has on Rel\nrelationships studies actually show that\na high level of empathy early on in\nrelationships can actually sabotage the\nrelationship and prevent it from\nprogressing because you are accurately\nable to detect someone else's\nunhappiness and remember because of the\nprinciple of emot emotional contagion\nwhen you detect that unhappiness you\nalso feel that unhappiness so what that\nmeans is that if your partner is unhappy\nyou are able to accurately read that and\nyou become unhappy so let's take two\nscenarios one where one partner is\nslightly unhappy and you're actually\nhaving a great time the second person's\nlike totally chilling totally vibing\nwe're enjoying this it's two dates in\nlet's see where it goes if they are not\nempathic and there's a term called Mind\nblindness if they are more mind blind\nthey are oblivious to their partner's\ndissatisfaction which means that their\npartner can kind of like work themselves\nthrough it right just because I'm\nattracted to someone or just because I'm\nunhappy with something doesn't mean I'm\ngoing to break up with someone I may\nneed to work through it myself I may\nneed to let go of my ex I may need go to\ntherapy myself or work on my confidence\nor whatever so in one situation you have\none unhappy person and one happy person\nand it turns out that if you have one\nhappy person and one unhappy person in a\nrelationship that relationship is more\nlikely to succeed than if you have one\nunhappy person emotional contagion and\nthen a second unhappy person which\nrelationship do you think is more likely\nto succeed one with an unhappy and one\nhappy person where they can maybe work\nthrough things or a relationship where\nboth people are unhappy so it turns out\nthat we have studies that show that\nhaving a high level of empathy actually\nsabotages your early relationships and I\nsee this so much in my clinical practice\nwhen I work with people who are very\ncaring very empathic and even are kind\nof like this nice guy picture there's\nother stuff that involves nice guys but\nlet's say an empathic emotionally\navailable dude so it turns out that\nempathic emotionally available dudes\nwill be like oh my God God nice guys\nfinish last they have this consistent\nexperience of getting into relationships\nbeing incredibly caring and for some\nreason they end up alone and then they\nsay like I don't understand I'm such a\nnice person I'm emotionally available\nI'm empathic I'm caring I've gone to\ntherapy and yet I'm alone and then what\ndoes the internet do the internet victim\nblames right no you're a nice guy you're\none of these toxic nice people who's\nlooking for sex and you're not actually\nkind and this and you're this and you're\nthis there's no victim blaming unless\nyou're a nice man on the internet right\nand that's the one situation where it's\nokay to victim blame so we sort of have\nthese scenarios and I've seen this not\njust in men but women as well who are\nincredibly empathic and supportive and\nwind up alone and it turns out that\nthere are a couple of good reasons for\nthat the first is that as they are\nempathic they experience emotional\ncontagion and their partner's\nunhappiness becomes their unhappiness\ninstead of being stable in resilient and\nhelping your partner move from\nunhappiness to happiness you get\ncontaminated by it and it sabotages the\nrelationship but there are also other\nfactors as well people who are empathic\nas we mentioned are more likely to be\ntaken advantage of people are going to\ntake advantage of your kindness if you\nare a nice guy you know what I'm talking\nabout because people will take advantage\nof your kindness there is this whole\ncomplex of sometimes people are men are\ndeceptive right where they are expecting\nsex but they're offering kindness and\nthat's kind of like an act but the\nopposite is also true where people are\ngenuinely kind and get genuinely taken\nadvantage of and there's data to support\nthat as well and so it turns out that\nrecognizing threats early on in a\nrelationship is a double-edged sword\nbecause the more that you see problems\nin the relationship the more likely you\nare to mentally check out whereas\nrecognizing threats later in the\nrelationship seems to correlate with\npositive you know relationship lifespan\nand satisfaction so and and this may\nsound kind of confusing right because\nthere are people on the internet who\nwill talk about how you should be more\nempathic and you may be wondering okay\nwell some people say you should be more\nempathic and some people you say you\nshould be less empathic which one is it\nand it turns out that empathy just like\nany other human function whether we look\nat confidence ego narcissism fear\nanxiety happiness love all of these\nthings are neither good nor bad it is\nwho is in control of them does the love\ncontrol you oh love is such a wonderful\nthing except when you fall in love with\nthe wrong person oh my God anxiety is\nsuch a terrible thing except when\nanxiety warns you of danger and actually\nhelps you survive and protect yourself\nnow the question kind of becomes all\nright Dr K you've said that we should be\nless empathic but like what do I do\nabout this how do I be less empathic\nshould I just be more of an [ __ ] and\nit turns out that there are a variety of\ndifferent things that correlate with\nsort of protecting yourself from too\nmuch empathy and as we learn these\nskills we will will have a healthier\nrelationship with our empathy the first\nthing that we need to do is be more\ncompassionate instead of empathic when\nwe help someone there are two different\nmodes of operation and it turns out that\ncompassion is like\nneuroscientifically somewhat discreet\nfrom empathy so remember affective\nempathy is the ability to feel what\nsomeone else is feeling whereas\ncompassion is the ability to have\nkindness towards someone else and often\nthose two things come hand in hand right\nI feel your pain therefore I am kind but\nyou don't have to feel someone's pain to\nbe kind to them so when you know like if\nyou have a little kid let's say like a\nsix-year-old kid who loses their\nfavorite stuffed animal or their blanket\ngets you know ruined in the wash even\nthough I don't really understand that\npain unless it happened to me I can\nstill be compassionate and kind towards\nthem what we sort of discover especially\nif you're a psychiatrist or therapist is\nthat you can have compassion towards\nyour patients without being caught up in\ntheir emotions and this is where I think\na key thing to understand is recognize\nthat you don't have to feel what you\nfeel in order to be kind you let them\nstay over there and you can exhibit\nkindness towards them without becoming\none with them the problem with empathy\nis that it causes two of us to fuse so\nvery practically I I think the best way\nto sort of implement this for people\nthat you want to help be responsible for\nhelp helping them don't be responsible\nfor their problems so when you make\ntheir problems your problems when you\nget overly invested let's find you a\ngirlfriend let's find you a boyfriend\nlet's find you love I'm going to work\nnight and day to find you love that's a\nrecipe for disaster because you can't\nfind them love you can't control their\nbehavior but you're trying to achieve a\nparticular thing in their life it\nactually has a paradoxical effect where\nthe more invested you become the more it\ndamages you and the more lazy they\nbecome\nas you take responsibility for the\noutcome they stop taking responsibility\nfor the outcome and a pattern that I've\nseen in my practice over and over and\nover again is that the more empathic\nthat you are the more people rely on you\nand become like basically [ __ ] lazy\nright and I see this a lot even with\nlike parents that I work with who have\nchildren who are addicted to video games\nas mom does more and more and more to\nhelp their child does their laundry\ncooks for them let me help you with your\nresume let me help you with this college\napplication did you do your college\napplication the child becomes more and\nmore incompetent and what you will find\nespecially if you see all these like I\nsee a lot of posts about things like\nweaponized incompetence is what you will\nsee is for anyone to have weaponized\nincompetence and if you're an empathic\nperson who deals with weaponized\nincompetence there is someone who\nfacilitates or enables that weaponized\nincompetence that human being has to be\nable to be that incompetent for a reason\notherwise they would be more capable\nright someone had to do everything for\nthem so separate compassion from empathy\nthe second thing that we need to\nunderstand is that the more\nself-critical you are the more\nvulnerable you are to high levels of\nempathy so there are studies that show\nthat you can be empathic but if you have\nconfidence in yourself that sort of\nmaintains a certain amount of stability\nin your identity so if I'm confident and\nI'm empathic that kind of works out okay\nbut if I'm self-critical if I blame\nmyself and I'm empathic that is like a\nterrible cocktail that will wreck your\nmental so let's like think through this\nfor a second so we understand right so\nlet's say I feel your pain and then I'm\nself-critical so now that I feel bad\nwhen my emotional circuits activate it\nalso triggers my self-critical sort of\nlike rumination and and this kind of\nstuff right after you go through a\nbreakup or when you get exposed to\nsomething sad these self-critical\nthoughts will start flooding your mind\nand it turns out that if you get that\nempathic signal from the outside it\nstill triggers this self-critical\nreaction so if your friend is going\nthrough a breakup and they're really\nstruggling and they're really sad you\ncan even blame yourself I should be a\nbetter friend or they're asking for your\nhelp and you feel burnt out and then you\nfeel guilty we'll get to that one in a\nsecond because that's a whole different\nthing but it turns out that the more\nself-critical you are the more\nvulnerable to empathy you will be so the\nsolution there is to focus on your own\nconfidence it isn't even about setting\nlimits with other people or cutting\nyourself off which is often times the\ncoping mechanism that we end up using as\nyou reduce your own self-critical\nthinking and develop confidence you will\nbe able to handle empathy better now\nlet's get to the third thing so this is\none super cool so it turns out that the\nother thing that makes people vulnerable\nto high levels of empathy is internal\nconflict so if you're someone who's\nhighly empathic hopefully this makes\nsense too that you feel for someone's\npain and then you want to help them but\nyou recognize that there's emotional\ncontagion you recognize that you have\nyour own stuff to deal with you don't\nhave the bandwidth to help them right\nnow and so then you're conflicted\nbecause if you set boundaries with them\nyou feel guilty and if you don't set\nboundaries with them you're sacrificing\nyour own stuff so highly empathic people\noften times are put into lose lose\nsituations by themselves you feel like\nit's someone else putting you in in that\nsituation but is actually your internal\nconflict that worsens the negative\nimpacts of empathy and so what we want\nto do there is recognize anytime you are\nkind to someone else or you're trying to\nbe empathic towards someone else right\nanytime you're trying to be supportive\nnotice if there is an internal conflict\nand recognize that the worse that\ninternal conflict is the more of a lose\nlose situation you're going to be in so\nhow do you resolve that and this is like\nliterally what we do in therapy right so\nI have you know I had a patient once who\ntheir parents wanted them to come home\nfor the holidays lots of patients not\njust one the patient doesn't like to\ncome home from the holidays because mom\nand dad are divorced they live in the\nsame city and no matter whether you go\nhome for the holidays or don't go home\nfor the holidays mom or dad is not going\nto be happy it's a very ugly divorce mom\nis unhappy that you're only spending\nChristmas morning with her dad is\nunhappy that Mom gets Christmas morning\nand they get Christmas afternoon and so\nthese two people got divorced for a\nreason right they're really unhappy and\nthey're somewhat self-absorbed and\nthere's no way that my patient can win\nthey hate going back because no matter\nwhat they do they cannot make both of\ntheir parents happy because what both of\ntheir parents want is a full Christmas\nwith the child that they love and even\nif my patient says okay this year we're\ngoing to do you what that means is that\nthe other parent gets no child for this\nyear of Christmas so there's no they\nnever hear the end of it so they would\ntry to set limits and they would feel\nincredibly guilty and then they would\nnot set limits and they would feel torn\napart so literally in psychotherapy what\nwe do with this person is work through\nthat internal conflict right stop taking\nresponsibility for your parents'\nhappiness I know this sounds crazy but\nthey signed up for only half of a\nChristmas the moment they got divorced\ndo you get that like this is something\nof their making they're the [ __ ] ones\nwho decide decided to get divorced and\nsomehow this is your problem to solve\nnow you're supposed to duplicate\nyourself and be in two places at once\nyou're supposed to make up for the\ndecision that your parents divorce\nthemselves this is what we do in\nPsychotherapy it is about resolving that\ninternal conflict and when we realize\nthat when we have that breakthrough and\nhe's like oh whoa whoa hold on a second\nthis is not my problem I no longer have\nto feel guilty I'm going to show up at\nat Christmas morning with my mom show up\nat Christmas morning with my dad and\nthen I I'm also going to have a\nconversation with them and be like hey\nboth of y'all let's hop on a conference\ncall both y'all want me to be there for\nChristmas if y'all wanted me to be there\nfor Christmas the whole time and both of\nyou wanted me 100% the thing that y'all\nshould have done is never gotten\ndivorced now y'all are in two places I\ncannot be in two places at once y'all\ntell me what you want to do y'all figure\nit out stop putting me in the middle it\nis the resolution of that internal\nconflict the Absolution of that guilt\nthat then protects you from that empathy\nand stops getting you screwed it's such\na simple solution it's such a simple\nrealization that you as a child don't\ncontrol this this is their problem and\nyet the more empathic we are the more we\nadopt their point of view because their\nparents are mad at each other so I'm\ngoing to accept their framing of the\nproblem so this is something that youall\nhave to be incredibly careful about that\neveryone is talking about the benefits\nof empathy and how we should be more\nempathic and all I'm looking for is\nsomeone who like is very empathic and\nsupports me and loves me and and you\nknow if they can't handle me at my worst\nthey don't deserve me at my best and\nsince they're I'm entitled to them\nhandling me at my worst I'm going to\njust be my worst all the time right\nbecause that's their [ __ ] problem now\nand there you are accepting it you're\nlike yeah I want to be a good boyfriend\nI want to be a good girlfriend I should\nbe emotionally available I should be\nempathic I should be supportive because\nif I'm not I feel guilty and then that\ntears me up inside and I don't want to\nfeel guilty because that makes me a bad\nperson so I'm going to help them and I'm\nI'm not going to set boundaries with\nthem and I'm going to let them walk all\nover me doesn't work so be very careful\nabout empathy recognize that it can\ndamage everything from your\nrelationships to your self-esteem to\nhaving having you even experience\nvicarious trauma and learn to set some\nof these limits otherwise you will go\nabsolutely insane and then everyone\naround you who cares about you can go\ninsane with you\nhe"
