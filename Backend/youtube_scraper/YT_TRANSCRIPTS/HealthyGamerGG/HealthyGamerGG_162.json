    "transcript": "hey y'all today we're going to talk\nabout core EQ or emotional quotient\nskills that men need to improve their\nlife so men are struggling a lot right\nnow the suicide rates are at an all-time\nhigh we've got a loneliness epidemic we\nhave a large number of men that for the\nfirst time in history are neats not in\nemployment education or training so men\nare really struggling and when people\ntalk about this problem they'll talk\nabout societal kinds of things like we\nneed to raise awareness there are papers\nabout things like the loss of third\nspaces right so these are P places that\nwe used to hang out and get to know each\nother but as these things are\ndisappearing we're still left with a\nfundamental problem which is like yeah\nlike this stuff is a problem but who's\ngoing to fix it who is taking the\nresponsibility for actually improving\nthe lives of men and that's right\nbecause as men it's up to us right we\nare independent we're self-sufficient\nwomen and children get access to the\nlifeboats but we as men need to solve\nproblems on our own and this is\nsomething that we see a lot even on the\ninternet the men's lonelyness epidemic\nis not going to be solved by women so\nthis is a post that interestingly enough\nI don't even disagree with right so\nright now one of the biggest problems\nthat men struggle with is that their\nprimary source of emotional support is\nusually their female romantic Partners\nin heteronormative relationships and\nthere's even research about this so\nlet's kind of take a quick look at a\npaper so I tried to call up my ex-wife\nnow day after discharge which she\nwouldn't answer the phone I sent her a\nmessage saying can you please call me\nbecause we need to talk about things\nthat can't be said in a text message so\nshe called me and I told her about what\nhad happened the night before about how\nI'd been to the hospital and she said\nI'm going to hang up now and I said no\nno no I have to tell you what happened\nand she said I'm going to hang up now\nI'm going to get you somebody who can\nhelp you this is from a paper called\nmasculinity and mental illness in and\nafter men's intimate partner\nrelationships so this paper very well\nhighlights a huge problem that men have\nwhich is that we rely on women for\nemotional support and even after they\nbreak up with us or we break up with\nthem or after they're our exes these are\nthe only places that we know how to go\nand I think understandably women are fed\nup with it so today we're going to talk\nabout core skills\nthat you can use and if you got pissed\noff by this that's okay we're going to\naddress that too core skills and things\nthat you can do to actually improve your\nrelationships and skills that you can\ndevelop to better handle the problems\nthat you face as a man hey y' I want to\ntake a second to talk about star Forge\nPCS so I am in love with these gaming\nmachines because I love gaming the\nproblem is that I started building PCS\nwhen I was 12 and I just don't have the\ntime for it anymore and if you really\nthink about it like sure you can keep up\nwith all the trends and stuff but but\nchances are especially if you're a\nhealthy gamer you may have better things\nto do with your time so if you're like a\ncollege student I love that they have\nthe horizon line which is like more\neconomical really solid gaming PC and\ninstead of like spending 15 hours\nfollowing trends like you know study\nyour for your final and like get a\nbetter grade and then get a better GPA\nthen get a better job and then go live\nyour life so if you're like me and\nyou're like a professional and you want\nto really solid gaming PC because you're\na gamer but you also don't want to waste\nthe time to figure out what's good and\nwhat's not I highly recommend star Forge\nall of their PCS are built in Austin by\nGamers who really know what they're\ndoing and if you're like me like you\nbuild a PC once every 3 years and you\nscrew up the gel on the heat sink if you\nknow what I'm talking about you know\nwhat I'm talking about all this kind of\ncrap you don't have to worry about\nthey're going to do everything for you\nit'll be a solid PC it'll run your games\nand this is the crazy thing every single\none of their PCS I've ever used also run\nZoom at top specs so check out star\nForge I absolutely love\nthem so the first thing that we need to\ntalk about is compartmentalization so\nmen tend to compartmentalize our\nrelationships so we tend to have this\ngroup of buddies that I game with these\nare my outdoor friends this is my family\nthose aren't my friends these are\ndifferent kinds of people so as men we\ntend to compartmentalize very very\nheavily and one of the compartments that\nwe make is that women are the people\nthat are our primary source of emotional\nsupport and they're also the people that\nwe want to get romantically involved\nwith we tend to tie the two things\nthings together now this creates all\nkinds of problems when we\ncompartmentalized relationships like\nthis we get stuck into these dynamics of\ngirlfriend Zone and friend zone so we as\nmen are socialized to express only emot\nemotional vulnerability with usually the\nwomen in our lives so these are usually\npeople like mothers sisters or\ngirlfriends and when we express this\nemotional vulnerability with other men\nwe tend to get made fun of or they don't\nknow how to deal with it let's look at\nsome more research so this is from a\ndifferent paper which we'll talk about\nbut I needed to get lots of Courage\ntogether to tell a friend of mine and I\nkind of said uh I think I'm depressed\nand he's like Ah that's a shame laughs\nand it didn't really go anywhere you\nknow it felt like I invested put myself\nout there on a limb and built up and had\nto sort of build myself up to a struggle\nto get the words out even to say the\nactual words it was a struggle to say\nthe actual words and it came out real\nsort of land and it probably didn't\nsound like much but it didn't go really\ngo anywhere I guess because Beyond just\nsaying I'm depressed you kind of need to\ntalk about it more than that right right\nso if you're a dude listening to this\nyou know exactly what this person is\ngoing through let's take a look at\nanother example I could tell because we\nknow each other so well that he was\npassing a sort of judgment on me and it\nwas a passive thing for him but it was\njust like that's how it is man and then\nhe was sort of like yeah yeah he sort of\nunderstood like you could just see that\nit was difficult for him to be like okay\nand how does that work and I'd be like I\ndon't know so in that sense I haven't\nconfided in many other people this is\nfrom a paper called masculinity social\nconnectedness and men's and mental\nhealth men's diverse patterns of\npractice if we look at this situation\nwhat do we see we see that we as men do\nnot know how to engage with other men\nand this creates huge problems this\ncreates all kinds of problems for women\nbecause women are left with the burden\nof our emotional support outside of\nromance and this is why if you look at\nmen who go through a breakup there is a\nfourfold increase in suicidal risk post\nbreakup why is that that's because when\nwe lose a girlfriend or wife we also\nlose our best friend who emotionally\nsupports us so it's kind of like\neverything falls apart all at once\nbecause we do not have social connection\nESS systems outside of the women that we\ndate and we absolutely need to build\nthose and I'm going to teach you how to\ndo that here and now so the first thing\nto understand is we need to learn a\ndifferent kind of language so as we saw\nin these examples we as men don't know\nand this isn't our fault we don't know\nhow to communicate our emotional needs\nto other people so as men we also know\nthat when you go to a dude with a\nproblem the dude will go into caveman\nproblem solving mode right so if you go\nto a friend and you say hey bro I'm\ndepressed your friend will say like ah\nme no depressed go to gym build\nconfidence get sexier this will help or\nmen have beer so when we go to other men\nto discuss our problems what ends up\nhappening is that they offer something\ncalled instrumental support So when men\ntry to support other men we don't just\ntalk about our problems because there's\nno point in that right we offer\nSolutions so what we're going to teach\nyou\nis how to use the language of\ninstrumental support but to gain\nemotional support and not need to rely\non the women or girlfriends in our life\nokay so I'll give youall a couple of\nsample things that you can say so the\nfirst is hey man I need help thinking\nthrough some stuff hey man I need help\nsorting through my emotions hey man I\nneed help clearing my head and so when a\nman hears this this is when they will\nunderstand and provide the support that\nyou need ah man know sometimes head have\nlots of thoughts sometimes in head is\nconfusing can help to get things out of\nhead empty head is good head so in these\nmoments what you are actually doing is\nasking for instrumental support hey bro\nhelp me sort through these emotions I'm\nnot looking to go to the gym I'm not\nlooking to get introduced to your\ngirlfriend's BFF I'm not looking for any\nof that stuff I need help with what is\non the inside in the best way to do do\nthat is to say hey I need help with dot\ndot dot and then some kind of emotional\nstatement because if you say something\nlike I'm depressed you're going to get\nthis kind of answer because men don't\nknow how to respond to that and so this\nis the second thing that we're going to\nteach you is how to deal with that\nawkwardness it's not just that we need\nto say these kinds of things to get the\nright kind of support it's that we also\nneed to learn how to deal with the\nawkwardness we don't know what to say we\ndon't know what to do so this is where\nwe're like hey bro I'm depressed and\nsomeone else is like yeah man it do be\nlike that sometimes and then y'all both\nshrug yall fist bump and then you ceue\nup for the next game so we need a way to\ndeal with that awkwardness and actually\nfeel safer in it and dive in so the next\ntime that you feel awkward and this is\ngoing to be the compass don't pay\nattention to what people are saying or\nanything like that doesn't matter what\nthey say thing to pay attention to is do\nyou feel awkward do you not know what to\nsay in this conversation because that's\nsomething that you can absolutely in ah\nman confused man not know what to do\nfriend is depressed here man have beer\nbeer will help let us go play video game\ndo you want to play with my dog men play\nwith dog men feel better so when you\ndon't know what to do we're going to\nteach you a couple of things to say it's\ngoing to be so easy number one help me\nunderstand that anytime a man comes to\nyou and says something that makes you\nfeel awkward or you think they're trying\nto say something you can just say help\nme understand that second thing you can\nsay is can you tell me more that's it\nthat's all we need to do it's actually\nnot that hard it's hard until you know\nhow to do it and we're not taught these\nthings it doesn't make us stupid and\nit's frustrating for women because we're\nnot taught this stuff right so we just\nknow one place to go for emotional\nsupport that's not their fault they're\ngetting overwhelmed by it so we need to\nlearn how to do this ourselves because\nwe are men and we have to solve our own\nproblems right we can't rely on other\npeople for help so if you're feeling\nawkward just ask people hey can you tell\nme a little bit more about that can you\nhelp me understand can you tell me more\nsay more bro preach brother you know you\ncan do some of that stuff but I don't\nknow if that's going to move in the\nright direction so this is the first\nimportant thing that we need to learn as\nmen stop compartmentalizing our\nrelationships now the second thing that\nwe need to learn is how to turn anger\ninto accountability so a lot of what\nholds Ben back is that when we have\nproblems in life we get pissed about it\nand if you look at toxic masculine\nspaces on the internet which I don't\nagree that they're entirely toxic what I\nmean is the space is that other people\nlabel as toxic what you will see is a\nlot of anger now anger can be good in a\nlot of ways it's not our fault that we\nactually feel very angry because we as\nmen are socialized to experience only\none emotion there's only one thing we're\nallowed to do which is be angry right\nand this is where people say no no no\nit's like it's okay to cry like people\nwill say that but then if you actually\ncry in front of other people you will\nget punished and let's not forget all of\nthe other emotions because now we have a\ncouple of movies out there where they're\nreally manly men who are crying right\nbut they're such Heroes that it makes it\nso beautiful oh my God he's crying oh my\nGod I love him so much but what about\nanxiety oh I don't know what to do\nyou're a bundle of nerves you're having\na panic attack you're worried about your\nfuture do people tolerate that not at\nall and what about shame oh yeah I'm a\npiece of I'm pathetic I'm this I'm\nthat like I don't know if I'm ever going\nto amount to anything in life do people\nbe like oh my God that must be so hard\nfor you and like you like no they're\nusually like no man can do go gym have\nbeer this will fix problem men know this\nis difficult right so it's not just\nwomen it's we don't know how to deal\nwith this stuff and the number one\nproblem with anger is that it absolves\nus of accountability see anytime you\nlook at Angry Men there is usually not\nany accountability that goes with it\nonce again let us look at the scientific\nliterature I was angry like I was\ndevastated that I lost her the partner\nbut it's because she broke up the family\nunit like a lot of guys get angry\nobviously and I was angry just because\nshe broke up the family unit you know I\ncouldn't get to see my daughter as much\nas I wanted to so this is a very common\nexperience for men where we will sort of\nget really upset at the women in our\nlives or other people for doing us wrong\nright how dare she take her daughter\naway from me or my daughter away from me\noh my God we get so angry and then if\nyou go to an online form people will say\nyeah like oh man like all women are\n and they'll say things like that\nright and and I think it's\nunderstandable to be angry but there are\na couple of problems with this in this\ncase so here in Mick downplayed the loss\nof his partner in assigning her blame\nfor his changed Family Access mi's lack\nof introspection for his culpability in\nthe shift hinted at male entitlement and\npatriarchy where in grievances for\nlosing control of his family Drew anger\nrather than accountability now this is\nwhere I don't want to get triggered by\nthe whole patriarchy thing but one thing\nthat I will say from a science\nperspective generally speaking when we\nget angry at things we do not take\naccountability so this is forget about\nthe patriarchy triggering words let's\njust understand this right when someone\ngets angry at you for something do they\naccept the blame that they had now let's\nthink very dispassionately generally\nspeaking when some when two people break\nup is it usually one person's fault\nusually it takes two to tango it takes\ntwo to break up the problem with anger\nfrom a neuroscience perspective is that\nanger makes our thinking black and white\nright so anytime we feel angry what\nliterally happens is all of our physical\nperipheral vision collapses down to 30°\nand the same thing happens to us\ncognitively we can only see this one\nthing and if you look at the real world\nvery few things in the real world are\nblack or white very few things are 100%\nthis person's fault the challenge is\nit's not that the woman in some way is\nnot to blame because it takes two to\nmake a relationship the problem is that\nwhen you are angry it is very difficult\nfor you to take accountability for your\nactions so literally when pissed off men\ncome into my office to do Psychotherapy\nwe will start by decompressing the anger\nonce we decompress the anger then we can\nappropriately assign blame we can say\nthis is what she did wrong what did you\ndo wrong and this is the beautiful thing\nabout doing that see if we blame the\nother person 100% of the for the problem\nthen we can't actually control things\nright because this isn't in our hands\nthere's nothing that I did wrong what\nthis means is that I am a victim to\nwhatever person I have a relationship\nwith they have all the power because\nthey're fully accountable and so\nliterally what I've seen in patterns of\nmen is that the more angry they get the\nless accountability they take the less\naccountability they take the less they\nchange the less they change the more\nthey repeat the pattern if you play a\nvideo game and you blame your teammates\nand you say oh my God all my teammates\nsuck you will literally stay stuck at\nthat MMR because you're not actually\nimproving at life and anger disables our\nability to improve so take a step back\ndon't let anger absolve you of\naccountability do you have a a right to\nbe angry absolutely did your partner do\nsomething wrong 100% but if you assume\nthat they did everything wrong and you\ndid everything right there is a 0%\nchance of improvement for you so you\nneed to take more accountability and it\nwill be easier to do that once you\ndecompress Ang anger we have a lot of\nother videos on the channel we have\ndifferent kinds of meditation techniques\nand stuff like that through Dr K's guide\nwhere we talk about anger and meditation\nthere's all kinds of stuff you can do to\ndecompress your anger but recognize that\nas long as you're seeing black and white\nand it's 100% the other person's fault\nyour life will never improve unless you\nget lucky Now we move on to the third\nthing which is that we need to stop\ntransforming and start accepting so if\nyou look at the way that men deal with\nproblems we all have this dream to\ntransform into a different Man For Whom\nthe problems are easier right so if I\nget bullied in the classroom I'm going\nto Get Swole and then I can beat them up\nso I need to change into someone else to\nmake this work better if I feel ashamed\nof myself because I'm not making enough\nmoney I need to transform right this is\nlike Voltron or whatever where it's like\nPower Rangers or whatever transform\nPokémon crap you want to pick anime\nwhatever it's why we all love that stuff\nright it's all these different\nTransformations from Bruce Wayne into\nBatman all speak to the subconscious\ndream of the man which is that I can\nmagically turn into whatever the world\nneeds for me in my day life I am a mild\nmannered Clark Kent but when the world\nneeds me I will transform into the\nSuperman and all these superheroes have\nalter egos that are like completely\nnormal people this is what we all want\nand the world wants this of us too and\nthis absolutely Ely needs to stop\nbecause when someone creates a problem\nfor you if you have to transform in\norder to fix that problem who is it that\ncontrols what you become you lose all\ncontrol over your life because once this\nproblem arises I need to turn into this\nand once this problem arises I need to\nturn into this and once this problem\narises oh now my girlfriend is unhappy\nthat I don't make enough money now I\nneed to work extra shift oh this person\nI feel this person makes fun of me when\nI go to the beach this means that I\ncan't go to the beach anymore until I\nwork out and I get a six-pack which\nmeans that you're denying yourself the\nbeach for the rest of your life right\ncuz you don't have a six-pack yet you\nthink you're just going to get one now\nbecause this person made fun of you\ndoesn't work like that so one of the\ncraziest things this is such a hard\nskill to learn from men is stop trying\nto transform and start accepting now\nthis may seem very very contrary to what\nyou want to do because the whole point\nis that oh but I I want to have a\nsix-pack doctor okay like okay fine I\nget that but as long as you letting\nother people dictate the person that you\nwant to become you will never find the\nsustained motivation to actually do it\nunless you have a a ton of resentment in\nwhich case you can sometimes do it but\ngenerally speaking it's not very good\ninstead what we really want to do is\nlearn to accept right this person is an\n so be it am I going to let this\nperson dictate my life am I going to\nstop going to the beach this person is\njust going to make fun of me that's\ngoing to happen sometimes it do be like\nthat sometimes right so the moment that\nyou accept and that's why that phrase is\nso powerful now these external\ncircumstances stop controlling you and\neven though you may not be able to\ntransform and I know it it feels really\nbad because we want to become all those\nbeautiful things right we want to be\nSuperman we want to be Batman we want to\nbe Voltron we want all that crap but in\nwanting to be all that crap how much\nhave you actually moved forward because\nthe stupid thing is that the\nneuroscience and psychology of it is\nthat wanting to be something else out of\na dream does not create sustained\nmotivation it is strength it is\nconfidence it is groundedness these are\nthe things that lead to positive change\nover time it is discipline and that\nstarts with not letting other people\ndictate your actions so be it if this\nperson wants to bully me so be it I'm\nstill going to go to the gym and I'm\ngoing to work on myself when you start\ntaking control of your life instead of\nletting your life take control of you\nthat is what will actually get you to\nthe gym right I'm going to go to the\nbeach I'm not going to let this person\ncontrol now I'm in control and when I'm\nin control I'm I say I'm going to go to\nthe gym which means I'm going to go to\nthe gym so if you look at it from a\nevidence-based perspective we know that\nthere's a new kind of therapy called\nacceptance and commitment therapy and\nacceptance and commitment therapy is all\nbased around the idea that we can't\nchange the world outside of us all we\ncan do is accept it and this is a\nevidence-based therapy that helps people\ndo things like overcome addictions\nbecause when you accept right and we see\nthis in in Alcoholics Anonymous hi my\nname is all and I'm an alcoholic there\nis an immense psychological and\nNeuroscience ific value to accepting\ninstead of transforming and the\nbeautiful thing is when we give up\ntransformation at least in the short\nterm we stop letting our circumstances\ndictate who we become so I know it\nsounds crazy men are getting screwed and\nas usual we are responsible because\nain't no one going to help us with this\ncrap so we are going to come together\nand we are going to help each other\nright you're not in this alone I'm here\nthe HG Community is here there's a lot\nof other people who are here to help you\nthankfully there are also a lot of women\nout there who are there to help us we\nhave those women in our community and at\nthe same time there are a couple of\nthings that we are never taught how to\ndo we end up compartmentalizing\nrelationships we don't know how to form\nconnections we end up channeling anger\ninstead of accountability which keeps us\nstuck in the same cycle over and\nover and over again and we all have\nthese dreams to transform into the\nperfect man and those dreams are\ntriggered by our circumstances and when\nwe fall Vic victim to them we open\nourselves up to other people dictating\nwho we become we lose control over our\nlives so start accepting start taking\naccountability and start talking to\nother men\n[Music]"
