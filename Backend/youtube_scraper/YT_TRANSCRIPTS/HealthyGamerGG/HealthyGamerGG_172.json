streams like this right which is\nlots of fun because we get to talk to\ny'all um and we get to hear what y'all\nsay how do we join in there's a Discord\nlink um and I think people in chat yeah\nI sometimes read chat but now that we're\ndual streaming I can't read all of the\nchat all the time Link in chat yeah let\nme give you all Link in chat so here is\nthe\nevent let me see if I\ncan okay there's the the link in\nchat all right um\nso\nyeah yeah so we've got a couple\ndifferent things right so we we make oh\nso a couple things is that there's also\nthere are going to be some winners right\nso we're all going to together everybody\ngets prizes but I think the top five\npeople will get um full access to all of\nDr K's guides to mental health it's\nguide to depression guide to anxiety\nguide to meditation guide to ADHD and\ndoing stuff and our new trauma module\nwhich will be coming out soon super\nexcited about the trauma module which is\nbrand new I think it's something that\nhas been many years in the making it's\nliterally taken us about 18 to 18 months\nto two years um but in my mind it's been\nmany years in the making so we're super\nexcited about that and y'all will get\naccess to all of the guides including\nthe new one if you're one of the top\nfive winners and then everybody else\ngets all of the goals that we share with\neverybody um we recognize that some of\ny'all are not in the best financial\nplace because Dr K's guy does cost money\nit's generally speaking quite cheap and\ngenerally\nspeaking we consistently hear that it\nhas offers some of the best value that\nyou can get out there um and so we still\nrecognize that there are are many people\nwho are either from developing countries\nor have access to currency that doesn't\nconvert well to the dollar or y'all are\njust on The Struggle Bus in life which\nis fair enough that's why we do a lot of\nfree streams and educational content and\nupload things and lectures and stuff\nlike that and resource packs are a big\npart of that so resource packs is\nsomething that we launched about a year\nago and these are more sequential\napproaches to a topic and we're starting\none on male mental health so it collects\na lot of resources that we have offers\nsome EX exes some Reflections things\nlike that so some application stuff\nfocused on male mental\nhealth um okay let's see what else is\ngoing on did I get to\neverything um okay so let me just show\nyall in more detail what a resource pack\nlooks\nlike so real quack real\nquack is this working now okay\ncool all right so let's see so this is\nlike so these are um curated\nvideos about a lot of things that relate\nto male mental health and then there\nwill also be like insights and\nReflections so if we look at the way\nthat you learn things right so if we\nlook at the science of learning so a lot\nof people wonder like okay I watch stuff\non YouTube all day does that actually\nhelp so it helps some um we have some\nevidence that it helps some and some\npeople will say like oh you know this\nvideo like really changed things for me\neverything clicked when I watched this\nso that's absolutely there but we also\ntry to use a lot of evidence-based\ntechniques in terms of enhancing\nunderstanding and what we know is that\nreinforcement and manipulation of\ninformation lead to more retention and\nmore behavioral change so we have 45\ninsights to summarize key learnings and\nthen there are reflections that you can\ngo\nthrough\num that will help you like manipulate\nthe\ninformation right so I don't know if\nthis kind of makes sense but like if we\nlook at just the science of\nlearning so if I ask someone you know\nwhat is 2 plus two you can memorize the\nanswer but that's not what leads to\nlearning learning is manipulation of\ninformation so we invite youall to\nreflect on things play around with the\nconcepts that we teach and the science\nsuggests we haven't studied this like\nwith an IRB approved trial or anything\nlike that internally in the community we\nprobably will at some point but what we\nknow is that when you do when you add\nthese additional layers it enhances your\nunderstanding so for people who enjoy\nwatching the YouTube videos what we've\ntried to do is offer maybe just a 10%\nbump in effort right so there's like a\nlet's say a two-hour it looks like the\nfirst one is on male suicide so we're\ngoing to talk about that and then there\nare a couple of exercises and key\nlearnings that we can use for\nreinforcement and manipulation of\ninformation um\nokay someone is saying that you can't is\nnot for India we cannot buy it that's\nweird news to\nme\num is there a women's mental health\nresource pack as well yet or is it\nperhaps coming later it is undoubtedly\ncoming later so one of the challenges\nthat we have about making content for\nwomen which we're working on is just\nthat I don't have the benefit of lived\nexperience so what that means is that\nevery video that I make for a woman\nleans a lot on my clinical experience so\nin my clinical practice I've worked with\nabout 5050 men women I've worked with\nhundreds of women uh so so I do feel\nqualified to talk about those things but\nit there's an additional layer of how\ncan I say this um I feel like the bar is\nhigher right so we have to be extra\ncareful in just because I don't have the\nlived experience of a woman so that\nmeans that often times there's an\nadditional layer of research there's an\nadditional layer of verification\nwhich is fine it's not we don't mind\ndoing it it's great but we we want to\njust make sure that our content is like\nhigh quality and is like quite\nrepresentative of the experiences of\nwomen and so there's just an additional\nlayer that comes with that which is\ntotally cool like that's part of what we\ndo um that's part of the reason that we\nalso have a women's only space on\nDiscord and then we've got a couple of\nother things in the works for the the\nwomen in our\ncommunity\num all right so and by the way most of\nwhat we make like I'd say like 90% of\nwhat we make is not gender specific so\ntoday for example while we're like\ntalking about male insecurity there's\nactually the only lecture that I\nprepared today is about insecurity for\nall people so how do we overcome\ninsecurity understanding the nuts and\nbolts of the concept and so even you\nknow a\ncouple let me think nine years ago was\nthe first time that someone called me\nwoke and I didn't know what the term\nmeant so one of my supervisors like was\nlike wow you're like quite woke and I\nwas like I don't know what that\nmeans and they were like then they\nexplained it to me and I was like I and\nthe reason they called me woke is\nbecause I was working with a patient who\nhad some problems with their gender\nidentity it's not that they were trans\nor something like that they had a\ncertain perception of masculinity or\nfemininity that they weren't living up\nto and then I was trying to explain to\nthem that like oh you know if you look\nat the meditative tradition like at the\nend of it we're all just human so we're\nall like a spark of the Divine and that\neven this construct of gender is like a\npart of our ego and ego is not truly\nwhat we are there is a true self that\ntranscends ethnicity and gender and any\nkind of identity tall short whatever and\nso like at at our true Oneness right\nthere's like there's actually no gender\nand if you look at experiences in\nmeditation if we look at experiences of\nsamadi or Transcendent meditation\nusually there's no gender identity\nassociated with that right so you're\njust like one with\nexistence um and so even your whole\nindividual gender goes with it but the\nwhole identity all of your all the parts\nof your identity disappear in\nTranscendent states of meditation and so\napparently that was considered\nwoke right so I'm not saying I'm woke\nI'm not saying I'm not\nwoke anyway so what we what we try to\nteach is towards that right that there\nare certain fundamental things that make\nus human\nand leaning into like those aspects of\nour psychology and those aspects of our\nbrain of our mind of our bodies like\nwhat makes us fundamentally human is\nwhat we lean into the flip side of that\nis that people have unique gendered\nexperiences and so we try to honor those\nas\nwell and\ntoday speaking of it we are going to\ntalk\nabout male specific insecurities okay\num but our lecture will apply to\neveryone because the stream Is Not Just\nFor Men\nokay shall we get started chat should we\ndo\nthis\nokay\num all right let's get started chat\nLords chat Lords and chat\nladies okay\na short word about\nbalding nope why does it go over here\nokay my observations as a 28-year-old\nman increasingly over the past year\nposts on this sub have been addressed\nthe interaction between going bald and\nattitudes towards mental health a lot of\npeople on this sub are really suffering\nfrom varying degrees of depression body\ndysmorphia and anxiety both General and\nsocial okay this post is what I've\nobserved since going bald after having\nlong hair for most of my life and I hope\nthat some people can derive some value\nfrom it the process of watching myself\nlose my hair was awful I felt like I was\nrobbed of my visual identity and I\nbecame stuck with this appearance that\nwasn't considered attractive by most\npeople as well as feeling as well as the\nfeeling of not looking like myself I\nalso had to contend with my perception\nthat women found me less attractive\nthere's definitely a feeling of\nisolation that comes with balding it\nhappens to enough people mostly men and\nthere really isn't any sympathy that\ncomes with losing your hair it isn't a\nseriouser debilitating illness on its\nown and there people with rare genetic\nillnesses and disabilities who have it a\nlot worse than people losing their hair\nwe all know that sometimes I feel guilty\nor shallow for obsessing over this one\naspect of my life at the same time\nbalding happens to people infrequently\nenough where it's still a notable\ncharacteristic it's considered funny and\nfair game to ridicule people for being\nbald despite it fundamentally being body\nshaming balding is often unfairly\naligned with being unhealthy unhygienic\nor less verile there's also a huge\nemphasis on physical appearance in\ntoday's media and Society in general for\npeople who are already who already\nconsider themselves somewhat attractive\nbalding is for the most part a loss of\ntheir potential Beauty think about how\nyou could have looked if you still had\nhair\nis something I find myself saying almost\nevery morning for people who never found\nthemselves attractive balding is just\nanother nail in the coffin and another\nway in which poor luck has lessened\ntheir social standing and the ability to\nattract others to\nthem some posts on here read like they\nbelong on incel forums particularly\nbecause balding is mostly male is a\nmostly male Centric problem and a lot of\nmen worry about their chances attracting\nwomen or talk about ways in which they\nhave been shamed or rejected for this\naspect of their appearance that is\nlargely out of their control it puts men\nin a tough spot you can't blame women\nfor not being attracted to you but it's\na constant and often fruitless struggle\nif you want to change the way that you\nlook it can be frustrating at the very\nleast all of this the social same shame\nlack of sympathetic support the feeling\nof being unattractive the jealousy of\npeople with hair uncertainty that you\nwill find a romantic or sexual partner\nthe dissonance between how you feel you\nshould look and what you see in the the\nmirror no wonder people battle with\nmental illness I'm in a better place\nmentally now than when I first cut my\nhair off I spent more time getting used\nto my own appearance and I worked on\nmyself in the gym and I'm very lucky to\nhave a supportive\npartner it still hurts whenever people\nmention my hair I find it difficult to\nlook at old photos of myself with hair I\ndon't feel as confident in my appearance\nI catch people glancing at my hairline\nin conversation and jokes or comments\nabout my hair is enough to ruin an\nafternoon\nI'm pretty insecure and no amount of\njust get over it from online forums has\nchanged that I'm still here on this sub\nand still on treatments for hair loss if\nthere's a chance I can get back some of\nwhat I've lost I I'm taking it we should\nfeel responsible on this\nsubreddit to ensure that people are\ndoing right by themselves mental health\nshould absolutely be a part of the\ntreatment of baldness and something that\nwe can't shy away from on this\nforum so I think this is a\nbeautiful descrip\nof what it's like to go\nbald and I know that we're talking about\nmen today because this a very common\nexperience of men but there's plenty of\nevidence that shows that baldness in\nwomen is even more debilitating than it\nis in in men and women go bald too by\nthe\nway so let's take a quick listen before\nwe kind of dive\nin let's take a quick listen to one of\nthe most wise people on the internet\nThor pirate software let me explain\nsomething everybody loves when you have\nhair everybody loves when you're bald\nthey just don't like when you're balding\nit's that middle ground that uncanny\nvalley of the head that causes a problem\ntheard sexy as 100% Bal right\ndoesn't matter David Bowie hair awesome\nsexy as it's just balding that's\nthe issue no one wants balding they want\nbald or they want hair go either\ndirection just don't sit in the middle\nit's not good okay\nso let's talk about\nbalding so today if you are struggling\nwith balding we're going to help you\nwe're going to help you by showing you a\nroad forward so the first thing that I'm\nI'm going to say is that I have been\nworking on this for about 3 years so for\nthree years every six months or so I\nwill sit down and I will look at all of\nthe scientific literature about balding\nI'll look for some kind of silver lining\nin the in the cloud\ncuz we know that balding is bad right so\nwe know that men who go bald have it\nworse so they they're considered less\nphysically attractive another big thing\nabout balding is since it is a\nrelatively uniform experience it's so\ncommon right it's not so rare that\npeople deserve sympathy it's one of the\nfew aspects of physical appearance that\nyou are allowed to make fun of people\nfor right so you can just make fun of\npeople for you can crack jokes about\npeople being bald there's no sympathy\nyou're the butt of jokes in the realm of\nbody positivity like balding doesn't\nhave a space right B body positivity is\nabout weight it's about curviness it's\nabout thigh gaps it's about beards or no\nbeards but it's not about balding no\none's like it's okay like we should love\nbald people no one says\nthat so balding comes with a huge mental\nhealth impact it comes with a huge\nsocietal impact imp because it's one of\nthese things that we don't\naccept so I've been trying to figure out\nlike what can I do to help people who\nare bald so I've had patients who have\ngone bald like we you know sometimes\nI'll I'll prescribe things like um uh\npropa which is a a an androgen\nconverting blocker an aromatase blocker\nright so different things that we can\ntry to do to help people not go bald but\nsome people go bald a lot of people go\nbald and what do we do to help them so\nfor 3 years I've been looking at\nliterature and I've been trying to\nfigure out like what can we do and the\nscience is very very like disappointing\nthere's like studies that study after\nstudy shows that if you're bald\nbasically there's going to be mental\nhealth impacts there's this concept of\npretty privilege which is very real\nright so if you're considered physically\nattractive it it comes with all kinds of\nother\nadvantages and so then there's this kind\nof idea that like as a bald man you're\ngoing to be inse like the world is\nobjectively going to treat you worse the\nworld is not going to give you sympathy\nfor treating you worse right they're\ngoing to say this sucks for you and\nsorry about that actually they're not\ngoing to say sorry they're going to say\nha haa right because you're a bald dude\nthere's like no sympathy in fact there's\nwe're going to treat you like crap\nthere's all kinds of self-esteem issues\nthat come with that because you perceive\nyourself in a particular way right so\nwhen you look in the mirror you see you\nbut as you start to go bald you're not\nyou're kind of becoming a new you but\nit's not like we're embracing a new you\nwe're actually just losing a better\nversion of yourself you're just like\nlosing a part of yourself that makes you\nmore attractive it's like just a net\nloss there's no\ngame so this is why I haven't made much\ncontent about being bald because I\nhaven't found an answer I haven't found\na way to help people Beyond yeah it\nsucks I'm sorry it do be like that\nsometimes so that doesn't that doesn't\nwork right like I I can't just make a\nvideo that says y'all are screwed I'm\nsorry about that and then there's this\nflip side that's kind of like and this\nis true so we're going to talk a little\nbit about this so the the real challenge\nwith being bald is not\njust that other people treat you\ndifferently the real challenge with\nbeing bald is that you treat yourself\ndifferently you lose confidence you feel\nthat a part of your life is lost and\nthen this becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy because now you have low self-\nSteam and you're bald right which is\nlike either of those is enough to screw\nover your chances at life now if you're\nlooking at me and you're kind of\nthinking to yourself here's Dr K talking\nabout how we're all screwed why the is\nhe smiling it's because For the First\nTime in three years I have found\nsomething that blew my mind and that\ngives me hope let us look at\nscience\nokay all right so before we get to this\nthere's one thing that I kind of\nnoticed is that not everyone who is bald\nis screwed right so there's a lot of\nevidence that shows that on average it\nnegatively impacts people's lives but I\nhave friends who are bald when I go to\nthe playground with my kids like 30% of\nthe dudes that are bald but they appear\nto be just as happily married as I am I\nknow people who shave their head and are\nactually in healthy relationships become\nsuccessful right I I've even seen like\nyou know everyone's like oh women don't\nlike bald\ndudes\nbut there is\napparently this\nguy and and apparently a lot of women\nlike this guy\nright and and so there's this guy\napparently is is beloved by women so\nclearly some people some people manage\nit\nright\nso let's take a look so so how is this\nright so if we look oh no I lost my\nhighlights damn it okay we'll fix it\nwe'll find this\nokay so but in reality we see that there\nare people there are these mythical\ncreatures out there these bald men that\nseem to have confidence that seem to\nhave\nrelationships and\nso how how is this possible and that's\nwhen I stumbled upon this paper and\nlet's look at this okay\nSo today we're going to talk about bald\nand bad experimental evidence for a dual\nprocess account of baldness stereotyping\nwhat the hell does that mean we'll\nexplain it to you okay so let's take a\nlook at some of the science on\nbaldness\num this is ex uh\nso one might ask whether balding men are\nnot only perceived as less good-looking\nbut also less warm and friendly this is\nexactly the physical attractiveness\nstereo type are Pas so the first thing\nthat we're acknowledging is that if\nyou're physically\nattractive then chances are that people\nwill think you are more competent in\nother ways this is called pretty\nprivilege and there's a lot of like good\ndata to support this\nokay um so despite a wealth of empirical\nsupport for Pas that's pretty privilege\nexperimental evidence is quite mixed for\nthe domain of male pattern baldness now\nthat's really\ninteresting although most relevant\nstudies agree that bald or balding men\nare perceived as less physically\nattractive right here's a bunch of\nstudies only some show analogous effects\nof the evaluation of social\nattractiveness so this is where pretty\nprivilege doesn't seem to translate for\nbald men so like you there's the the\nphysical attractiveness people are rated\nas less physical attractive but\nsomething as weird as going on when we\nactually apply to is this personable\nlikeable is this person likable is this\nperson friendly do I want to hang out\nwith this person so physical\nattractiveness and how much I like this\nperson don't seem to translate for all\nstudies on\nbaldness While others show no such\neffects so no pretty privilege or no no\ndiscrimination against bald men in other\nways um if they're because they're\nbald okay now one of the reasons for\nthis is that these are all variably uh\nvery considerably in their experimental\ndesign okay so let's just pause for a\nsecond just explain what the hell I just\ntalked about so here's what I mean so\nthis is what the study says we all know\nthat people who are attractive get other\nbenefits when we look at the studies of\nmale pattern baldness some studies show\nthat bald dudes get all these other\nbenefits they get or they they suffer\nfrom the lack of benefits but many\nstudies actually show that there is no\nnegative consequence to being bald\noutside of a simple rating of physical\nattractiveness okay so they don't seem\nto lose out on pretty privilege because\nthey're\nbald now the question is like what on\nEarth like how is that possible right\nbut we have some evidence of this why do\nwe have some evidence of this because we\nsee that some bald men are able to be\nsuccessful happy have self-esteem and\nare in relationships right it's not like\nbald men are unable to live life that's\nhow it feels but some people figure this\nweird secret out so the question is\nwhat's going on there let's take a look\nokay does this uh inconsistent pattern\nof results question the validity of the\nuh pretty privilege right physical\nattractiveness scale in the domain of\nmale pattern B baldness based on the\nfundamental distinction between\nstereotype activation and stereotype\napplication we argue that the activation\nof the Pas does not necessarily imply\nits application at the behavioral level\nnow unless you study science formally\nchances are you have no effing idea what\nthis means so we're going to explain it\nbut this is crucial this is\nmindblowing so we have stereotypes of\npeople The Stereotype exists in people's\nmind bald dudes are less attractive\nthey're less likable maybe they're funny\nthey're less capable they're less\nprofessionally successful they're less\nconfident we have all these\nstereotypes this is the activation of a\nstereotype okay so when someone sees\nthat you're bald all of these thoughts\nabout baldness activate fair\nenough now there is a discrepancy\nbetween whether that stereotype actually\ngets applied to you or not so even\nthough people have a\nstereotype for bald people it appears\nthat some bald men are able to dodge\nthat stereotype they do something to\nwhere all of the negatives of being bald\ndo not apply to them so let's look\nfurther at this paper which is really\ninteresting now we get to the money okay\nso this is what these people did this is\ncrazy so they showed people pictures\nnon-bal version bald version and you\nlook at this and like these people don't\nlook nearly as good as these people\nright like hair is clearly a win in this\nsituation but they did something really\ncool so non-bal Target and bald Target\nso in this case we look at physical\nattractiveness not bald you get\nbasically a three once we make you bald\nit's like a minus one you're losing 20%\nright you're between a one and two fair\nenough and if we look at socializing so\neven if we ask this person would you\nlike this person would you want to hang\nout with this person we also see almost\na onepoint hit maybe a half Point hit so\nthis is consistent with our\nunderstanding so bald being bald makes\nyou less physically attractive and makes\npeople like you less think you're less\ncompetent this is what everyone talks\nabout right people no respect for the\nBaldi now let's look at this now this is\nwhat's really weird so when you lose\nhair fair enough you're less physically\nattractive but what the f people like\nbald people more what on Earth this is\nwith hair this is without hair and the\nsocial likableness the friendliness the\ndesire to hang out with people can\nactually go\nup hold on a second and what does this\ndepend on this depends on something\ncalled individuating\ninformation\nso here's what this paper shows\nus cuz we\nknow that there are some people who are\nbald who end up being successful\nhappy married with kids get laid call\nwhatever measurement you want question\nis how and now we have\nresearch so what happens so this is\nwhat's super\ncool some bald men defy the expectations\nof being bald and when you defy the\nexpectations of being bald it is a net\ngain it is not back to average it is\nactually a net gain and I want youall to\nthink about this for a second see when I\nhave low expectations and someone defies\nthem they're not back to average right\nso if I have high expectations of\nsomething and it is what I expect I'm\nactually disappointed so everyone's like\noh my God this movie is fantastic\nfantastic I go watch it it's pretty good\nbut I'm disappointed whereas if someone\ntells me oh this movie is awful this\nmovie is awful or if I've never heard\nabout it and I go watch it if I it\ndefies my expectations there is a\ncognitive compensatory response that\nmakes me rate it even higher everyone\nsaid this place sucked but it turns out\nthat this is actually\nawesome so this is a psychological\naspect of all human beings and it turns\nout that my bald Brothers have access to\nthis whereas those of us with hair\nactually don't because there are no\nexpectations to\ndefy right so when we when we have a\nnegative stereotype if you defy that\nstereotype you actually end up with a\nnet positive this is what this study\nshows\nus so now we get to the real problem of\nbaldness and now we also understand what\nto do if you're bald defy expectations\nnow you may say but Dr K this is so hard\nbecause because everyone has such strong\nexpectations of bald people right\neveryone misjudges bald people everyone\nthinks not only are we physically\nunattractive but we're\npathetic the stronger the expectations\nare the easier it is for you to defy\nthem the more that people dislike bald\npeople the more ground you can actually\nmake up does that make sense so the very\nthing that you think is holding you back\nis absolutely holding you back those\nexpectations exist people think less of\nbald people you are considered less\nphysically attractive but for every mile\nyou lose or kilometer that you lose in\nthat direction you can actually make it\nup if you defy the expectations of being\nbald so what does that mean that means\neverything else so you can't defy the\nexpectations around your hair\nright but you can do everything else so\nif you get physically in shape if you\nbecome professionally successful if you\nwork on your confidence and your\ninsecurity you will actually pick up\nground because what's going to happen is\nthat same stereotype that is working\nagainst you when you were bald is now\nsomething that you're\ndefying right it's kind of like back in\nthe days when everyone was super racist\nI mean I guess people are still racist\nnow I I don't know but like back in the\nday right when like when we didn't have\nlike you know like in the days of\nslavery and stuff like that like it was\nlike crazy that a black person could\ngraduate from medical school\nwhen racism was so systemic and so overt\nnot saying it's gone and so the weird\nthing and like even I experience this as\nan Indian person right so there are\ncertain stereotypes that I've dealt with\nand then when I end up defying those\nstereotypes I get a net positive being\nbecoming doctor is not one of them right\nbecause that's a stereotype that's to be\nexpected so this is the crazy\nthing is that when we look at being\nbald we say that Society Mis like you\nknow treats us unfairly that's actually\nobjectively correct we're not saying it\ndoesn't but if you are bald there are\nsome things you can control and there\nare some things that you cannot control\nso you can't control whether you have\nhair or not you can't control someone's\noriginal Judgment of you right the\nimpression that they form with you of\nyou within the first five seconds of\nseeing your face you cannot control that\nbut what you can control is everything\nafterward how much do I how much does my\nidentity have to do with being bald\nright so when one person makes a comment\non your baldness does it ruin your\nentire day those are things that you can\ncontrol how much do you take care of the\nrest of your body that is something that\nyou can control and the problem with\nbeing bald is that we tend to throw in\nthe towel right we tend to think that\nsince all of this judgment is true there\nis no point in working on this or we\nthink to ourselves even if I work really\nhard on this even if I put in a 10 out\nof 10 effort the best I'm going to get\nis an8 out of 10 yield because I am bald\nbecause I can never escape this kind of\nthing this is defeatist thinking this is\nthe big thing that successful bald men\nhave figured\nout right they figured out that I can\ncontrol everything else and that's what\nI'm going to put myself into so if you\nlook at the research on baldness we see\nall these self-esteem problems negative\nmental health problems all that stuff is\nfair enough I'm not saying that those\nthose things are not deserved but what\nwe also know is that there is a path\nforward that even though this one thing\nyou won't be able to change it actually\ndoes not determine your destiny and this\npaper blows my mind because it actually\nsuggests the opposite that there is net\nground to gain in terms of social\nlikeability that your physical\nattractiveness does not determine your\nactual Destiny and that explains why\nbald people can be successful and have\nhealthy relationships\nso what do we do about this don't worry\nabout the baldness work on everything\nelse and pay attention because as you\ntry to work on everything else what will\nhappen is the baldness will take over\nbecause the baldness makes you pathetic\nthe baldness makes you a loser it\nbecomes a part of your identity you see\nit every time you look in the mirror oh\nI am a shadow of what I have been and\nwhat actually determines your destiny is\nnot whether you're bald or not\nis whether you believe you are a shadow\nof what you have been this is\ndeterministic so if we look at things\nlike the placebo effect in the no sibo\neffect if you believe something will\nhappen this will have a clinical\nbiological effect if you believe\nsomething won't work that too will have\na clinical biological effect and this\nisn't weird social stuff this is like a\npill that\ninhibits cell division that we give in\ncancer right like this is like like\nthere's no like there's no Society\nthere's no other human being this is\njust the power of your\nmind and so the biggest problem that\nbald people have is not that they're\ngoing\nbald but the conclusions that they form\nabout themselves which they think this\nis true because the world treat me\ntreats me this way and it's not that\nyou're wrong it's just that the way that\nyou connect the dots that's not fair do\npeople mistreat you 100% is there\nsympathy for bald people absolutely not\nare people going to judge you as\nphysically less attractive\n100% are you going to have less success\non dating apps maybe all of that stuff\nis true but if you're not careful what\nyou will do your mind will take all of\nthose things and it'll jump this means\nI'm screwed this means I'll always be\nalone this means I can't do anything\nthis means it's futile that's\nincorrect do you all see the difference\nthis is very very important to\nunderstand the problems that we face in\nour mind the mistakes that we make what\nreally determines our future is not the\nreality of the world what determines our\nfuture is the way that we interpret the\nreality of the world and the way that we\nchoose to live in this world it is the\nway that it shapes our choices and\ncauses us to give up and forget all of\nthose other\nthings if we can turn that around if we\ncan say I'm going to focus on what I can\nfocus on I can't control that I'm bald\nit turns out that we actually gain\nground\nit turns out that since people expect so\nlittle of us it is easy to defy\nexpectations it is easy to impress\npeople do you all get that impressing is\nnot about meeting expectations it's\nabout exceeding expectations so what\nthis study shows us is that is easy for\na bald easier for a bald person to\nimpress someone than someone with hair\ncrazy crazy crazy crazy crazy\ncrazy\nokay questions\nsee people are saying okay confidence so\nwe can't overcome First Impressions this\nis my point so the key thing to\nunderstand confidence can overcome First\nImpressions but let's understand this\nthe key thing that we need to understand\nif we're\nbald is that first impressions are not\ndeterministic that's the key mistake\nthat we make is that we think that this\ndetermines our future it doesn't the\nfirst impression is there that deck is\nstacked against you it's a bad way to\nstart op it's a bad way you're starting\nhand right as I'm playing my deck\nbuilding game sucks but it doesn't mean\nthat you're screwed that's the key thing\nand remember that in in a deck building\ngame if you're starting hand sucks what\ndoes that mean about your future cards\nthat means good cards are coming you\ndidn't get your good cards now they can\ncome down the road and so you can defy\nthose expectations and end up net\npositive\nokay does this mean that in general\nbeing less privileged can actually be an\nadvantage yes and no so this is where we\nneed to be super careful about making\ncomparisons less privileged can be an\nadvantage yes and no right so I'll give\nyou all just a simple example so let's\nlook at\nacgme um\nadmission St MCAT statistics so\nsomeone's asking can being less\nprivileged\nuh trying to find\nwhere is the I'm trying to find\nthis give me a second\nchat ah where is\nthis give me a second give me a second\ngive me second a second\nchat I wish there was I can't find this\none\ntable there's a great\ntable that looks at MCAT score and GPA\nby ethnicity\nmaybe they don't stop publishing that's\nso interesting oh here it\nis okay so here's here's the thing so\nsomeone's\nasking can being less privileged\nactually be an advantage so let's take a\nlook at some\ndata right so if we look at the total\nMCAT score the mean this is total mean\nscore okay so if we look at like let's\nsay Dr\nright so I'm Asian this means that the\naverage score that I need to get on an\nMCAT is a\n9.1 and the average GPA I need is a 3.8\nor sorry\n3.62 right so if I want to if I if Dr K\nwants to get in med school this is what\nhe has to\nget now if we look at some some like\nsome of these other ethnicities like if\nI'm an Alaskan native then I need a 3.4\nGPA instead of a 3.7 and I need a 496\nMCAT instead of a 509 right so if I'm\nblack or African-American I need a 497\nor a\n3.39 as opposed to a 3.7 or 509 now I'm\nnot saying that this is a good or a bad\npolicy this is very important because\npeople will be like affirmative action\noh my God like is he anti-ir no no no no\nI'm not I'm not making a claim about\nwhether this is good or\nbad what I'm pointing out is someone\nasked me a question is being less\nprivileged an advantage\nand we generally speaking if we look at\npeople like Alaskan natives they tend to\nhave some of the hardest lives on the\nplanet maybe not on the planet in the\nUnited\nStates American Indians tend to have\nsome of the the worst mental health\noutcomes worst\nlike like Financial outcomes very poor\nsocioeconomic status High rates of\naddiction High rates of myocardial\ninfarction like they're just really poor\npoor poor outcomes and so there are some\ncases in which life seems to be a little\nbit easier for them right so there's\ndata to support that I'm not making a\nvalue based Claim about whether this is\ngood or bad Society should be like this\nor not be like this I'm not talking\nabout that that's not my area of\nexpertise let smarter people who know\nabout that decide or you decide for\nyourself but here's what I'm\nsaying see in life there are some things\nthat we can't control and some things\nthat we can control and the biggest\nproblem that we run into is when we let\nthe things that we cannot control\ncontrol the things that we can\ncontrol this is when we truly lose at\nlife we get so caught up about I'm a\ndisadvantage and I felt this way back\nwhen I was applying to med school I\nlooked at this and it pissed me off\nbecause I looked at this and I said if I\nwas a different ethnicity I would have\ngotten into med school years\nago but since I'm Asian the deck is\nstacked against me but there's a flip\nside to that argument which is since I'm\nAsian my parents could pay for MCAT\nclasses my parents could pay for school\nI could pay for five years of school I\ncould spend time studying for the MCAT\nand not worry about how you know like\nhow I was going to pay for rent and feed\nmyself and stuff like that so Indian\ncomes with some advantages I don't know\nif things balance out or not but\nwhatever the world is the way it\nis the right thing to do is not cry\nabout it the wrong thing to do is cry\nabout it because in this life there are\na lot of things that you can't control\nwhich are going to be stacked against\nyou that's\nlife what I've seen consistently is that\nwhen you let those things dictate\neverything else you're bald fair enough\nsucks for you I mean that I'm not just\nsaying that\nfactiously because it's the one\ncondition that people are allowed to\nmake fun of\nyou right what the question is what else\nare you doing in your life how much do\nyou let this dictate other parts of your\nlife and this is where things get super\ntricky they you say okay like I can't\nmake friends because I'm bald because\npeople mistreat me because I'm bald that\nI don't accept I could be wrong in not\naccepting that maybe I don't understand\nhow hard your life is but as someone\nwho's worked with lots of bald dudes who\nare depressed and have anxiety and stuff\nlike that like there is a way\nforward so will First Impressions\nagainst you be bad 100%\nno question the deck is stacked against\nyou but that doesn't mean that you have\nto\nlose and you lose when you throw in the\ntowel so if you're a bald dude I don't\nknow what to say about online dating\napps because that's where physical\nappearance is such a big part of it but\neven then I'm not convinced that I\nhaven't just seen convincing data that\njust because your ball doesn't mean you\nget zero matches there's lots of dudes\nwho get zero matches you can absolutely\nwork on your profile you can work on\nlook maxing you can work on your body\ncan work on all kinds of stuff and like\njust like Thor says you can be bald and\nsexy right so what we tend to see is\nthat it's the people who are balding and\nhold on to their former self those are\nthe people that are the least attractive\nit's the people who embrace it the\npeople who say I'm going bald I'm just\ngoing to shave my head that you got to\ngo that direction you just got to\nembrace it right I'm going to hit the\ngym I'm going to focus on work I'm going\nto turn myself into something that is\nrespectable I'm not going to let this\ndetermine the rest of my life and then\nyour mind will say but but but this is\nharder and this is harder and this is\nharder and this is unfair and this is\nunfair and this is\nunfair all that stuff is true so\nwhat so you've got two choices you can\nwait for the world to become a fair\nplace and then you're golden you're\nGucci baby or you can take your life\ninto your own hands and fix what you\ncan it's up to\nyou\nright people are talking about Finn\ndiesel right I I like it's hard being a\nbald dude but the whole problem is that\nwe let it dictate we let baldness take\naway our power in all the other\ndimensions of our life that's the\nmistake\nyeah everyone's talking about the Rock\nand this person and things like that\nwho's vacuuming yeah someone's doing\nsomething\noutside\nokay yeah so someone's saying most women\ndon't care about\nbaldness so there's also a really\ninteresting study I read recently that\nmen's perceptions of what women care\nabout tend to be pretty\noff so the problem is that when when I\nhear a lot of men talk about what women\nwant their data points are usually\nsocial\nmedia their dating points are usually I\nme their data points are usually things\nlike dating apps which like kind of\nmakes sense right and I'm sure that when\nI say this there's going to be an army\nof people but I have a friend in real\nlife I listened to this one conversation\nand they said they want this this and\nthis I mean Fair enough I'm not saying\nthat it's always the case but generally\nspeaking what I'm noticing is men and\nwomen both do this they are forming\ntheir impressions of what the other\ngender dating preferences are on the\ninternet and the internet is not real\npeople it's a slice of real people it's\na place where the most polarizing\nopinions flight to rise to the top there\nis a silent of majority of relatively\nchill people on the internet everyone\nuses the internet not every one is a\ncrazy on the internet if you go on the\ninternet all you will see are\ncrazies do you all understand\nthat but this psychological concept is\nhard for us to accept in the dating\nrealm\nwhy makes people angry when I say that\nwhy because it's so\nunempathic you have had such a brutal\nexperience and when I say something like\nthat it's basically like saying it's not\nlike that bro it's not like that girl\nand then you're like yeah it is\nI'm not saying that you haven't been\nbrutalized by online dating everybody\ngets brutalized by online dating that's\nabsolutely correct but online dating is\nonline dating it's not men and women it\nis a slice of men and\nwomen right it's a place where the deck\nis so messed up that we can't judge\nnormal people based on\nit so take a step back take a deep\nbreath I know it is see it's very it's\nvery easy to stay attached to our\npain it's very easy to stay attached to\nour sense of unfairness or\nInjustice it's very easy to say the\nworld is an unjust place I want it to\nchange I shouldn't have to\nchange I agree with you you shouldn't\nhave to the question is how do you want\nyour life to\nbe so you can and that's where like\nhonest like I'm I'm asking that question\ngenuinely like I have an answer for\nmyself and for the people that I work\nwith and an answer that I advocate for\nwhich is that control what you can let\ncan't you come on guys can we\ncount on the World to become a better\nplace on its own or do we have to live a\nlife where we have to live in this\nshitty world and do the best that we can\nyou tell me the world is\nhopeless which doesn't mean that your\nlife has to\nbe so let go of that anger let I'm not\ndisputing the unjustness of it it's\nunfair it's injust it sucks I agree but\nit doesn't have to be\ndeterministic\nokay so bald can be sexy it's\njust you\nknow you need to have the other stuff\nright like let's be\nhonest and so work on the other stuff\nand then turns out that you'll defy\nexpectations and people will be\nsurprised by oh my\nGod I didn't expect him to be so\nconfident oh my\nGod he's actually kind of cute oh my\nGod I'm not really into bald guys like I\ndon't date them but like\nyou like that's what we're shooting for\nchat y'all can do it I believe in you\ny'all can do\nit all\nright it's like someone saying getting\nrised\nup okay so someone else is saying yeah\nbut how would I feel cute being bald\nwe're going to talk about that so we'll\ntalk it let let's talk about being short\nfirst we're not done yet chat okay\nactually let me ask you all a\nquestion so I've prepared a lecture\nabout insecurity and how to overcome\ninsecurity fundamentally do you all want\nthat lecture now or do you all want it\nafter we look at other posts about\nexpressing emotions being short like\nwhat do yall\nwant okay can we do a\npoll so y'all yall decide because it's\nlike on the one hand like we can look at\nall the posts and then we can have like\nthe climax which is like the\nlecture or we can have the lecture which\nwill frame the\nposts let's keep edging you\ndegenerates oh my God\noh man so some sometimes people ask me\ndo I like my\njob and hold on let me see this\nthis okay no yeah so I'm going to do a\npost I'm going to do a\npoll lecture now or posts lecture\nposts\nshort\nvulnerable oh PO is already active\nlooks like\nmods rocking it okay people are saying\nnow all right fair\nenough okay chat we do it now lecture\nnow or\nafter let's see here okay people want\nnow it's pretty close we're going to get\nto it\nall\num how do I\nsee okay wow it's so\neven\nokay so what we're g to\ndo oh\nnope what what I screw it up I screwed\nit up Dr K's\nlagging Dr K's lagging in his\nrain\nokay\nso we are going to talk about how to fix\nnot fixed the wrong word So today we're\ngoing to talk about how to overcome\ninsecurity now a lot of people may\nWonder Dr K when you say overcome\ninsecurity do you which insecurity are\nwe talking about are we talking about\nfeeling bald are we talking about\nfeeling ugly are we talking\nabout having a wart on our nose like\nwhat are we talking about bra and I'm\ntalking about all of them I'm talking\nabout the fundamental way in which an\ninsecurity forms in your mind and how to\novercome\nit now a lot of people misunderstand\nthis because they think that fixing an\ninsecurity is the way to overcome it but\nfixing an insecurity is not overc it\nthat is actually feeding into it so\nlet's\nunderstand so a lot of people think oh\nmy God I'm bald I'm insecure about my\nappearance so let me go get hair plugs\nlet me start medication let me get a a\nwig let me do all these things to fix\nthe problem and then I will no longer be\ninsecure now in one way that is correct\nbecause you won't be insecure but you\nwon't have overcome your\ninsecurity so if I think to myself oh I\nyou know I don't know how to dance let\nme go take a dance class and then I'll\ndevelop confidence and then I will be\nsecure in my dancing I've overcome the\ninsecurity no you haven't you fixed the\nproblem but you haven't fixed overcome\nthe insecurity so let's understand what\nwe mean by this so let's take the\nexample of someone who is insecure about\ntheir\nbaldness and they say in order to fix\nthis problem I'm going to get a wig or\nI'm going to get hair plugs and then the\nproblem goes away so they start wearing\na wig they feel super confident now what\nhappens when the wig blows away in the\nwind the insecurity\nreturns so the weirdest thing about\novercoming insecurities is that fixing\ninsecurities is not overcoming them in\nfact it just reinforces it it just makes\nit go\ndormant so this is the difference\nbetween fearlessness and courage very\ndifferent\nthings to be courageous is to overcome\nyour fear to have the fear and to\novercome it to be Fe Fearless is to\nremove the fear and then if it returns\nyou won't have courage right so I can do\nsomething like get drunk to overcome my\nfear get some good old social courage I\nmean liquid courage and social lubricant\nbefore I go ask someone out on a\ndate that doesn't getting drunk doesn't\novercome my insecurity it just makes it\ntemporarily\ndisappear yall understand this so let's\nunderstand how to overcome an insecurity\nand how actually fixing our problems\nsometimes reinforces our\ninsecurity okay so here's\nyou and you have a\nproblem let's just call it baldness or\nactually let's do something\nuh let's do something that's a little\nbit more uniform let's say out of\nshape I'm unhappy with with my\nbody now a lot of people think if I'm\ninsecure about my body what you should\ndo is go to the gym right makes\nsense\nJY now I am in shape and now I'm\nconfident insecurity fixed so I'm not\nsaying that going to the gym doesn't\nlead to confidence it's not that this is\nnot a solution it's just that it doesn't\novercome the\ninsecurity and now you may say but Dr K\nhow does that work like what are you\nsaying like this doesn't make any sense\nlet's just take example of a\ncelebrity right so a celebrity is\nsomeone who's often times very beautiful\nand they may have started out a little\nbit out of shape but then they go and\nthey do things like gym they do things\nlike cosmetic\nsurgery right they do things like work\nwith a dietitian they do all these\nthings to fix their\nappearance does that make them secure\nshockingly not so much right despite\nthat they are despite the fact that they\nare objectively improving the situation\nit doesn't necessarily fix their\ninsecurity so for some people it does\nright so the gym can help we're not\nsaying don't go to the gym but we must\nunderstand what an insecurity is so\nfixing the problem is making the problem\ngo away it's not overcoming the\ninsecurity that comes with the problem\ndo you all understand that difference so\nlet's understand what an insecurity\ntruly is so there's a problem over here\nwhich has a solution over here but an\ninsecurity is not in the real world so\nthis is the real\nworld and this is your mind and\ninsecurity exists within the mind this\nis the first thing to understand an in\nthe insecurity is an aspect of our ego\nor a\nhamara which is why if you look at\npeople like celebrities or you look at\npeople like um\nuh like people with like body dysmorphia\nno amount of fixing the problem actually\ncures the insecurity it's because the\nexternal world this thing is over here\nand the insecurity actually acts\ncompletely independently of the external\nworld so overcoming an insecurity has\nits own thing right so I can help\nsomeone who has body dysmorphia who is\noverweight overcome their body\ndysmorphia without losing weight or I\ncan even help someone overcome their\nbody is this morphia if they're anorexic\nby gaining weight like the actual weight\nand the insecurity are not necessarily\ntied we think they are but it turns out\nthat doing this stuff sometimes helps\nwith this stuff helps things on a mental\nlevel so let's understand what an\ninsecurity truly is so that we\nunderstand how to overcome\nit so fixing the problem just makes it\ngo dorment then if the problem returns\nthen the insecurity will return that's\nnot actually conquering anything so the\nfirst thing to understand about an\ninsecurity is it is most of the\ntime based on how you are\nperceived right so when I'm insecure\nabout my\nappearance what I'm really concerned\nabout is what will other people think\nwhen they see me so when I go to the\nbeach and I leave my shirt on because\nI'm afraid of what I'm going to look\nlike with my shirt off what I'm actually\nconcerned about is the opinions of\nothers so there's a subtle difference\nhere there are some things that involve\na lack of confidence that I have in\nmyself and I genuinely don't care about\nwhat other people think but I would say\nthat most people 75 plus percent of\npeople who have insecurities if you\nreally track it back what it really\ncomes down to is how other people\nperceive them so it is the opinions of\nothers that matters so the way to\novercome that insecurity is to over over\ncome needing the opinions of others very\nsimple we'll talk about how so the\nsecond aspect about opinions of others\nis insecurities are relative and\nAbstract they are actually constructions\nof the mind they are not\nrealities so I'll give you all an\nexample let's say that you know a lot of\npeople that we're going to be talking\nabout\ntoday right so here's quick\nexample I'm short AF and I hate it right\nwe're\nshort now this is going to say I'm going\nto say something that's not going to\nmake any sense but it's\ntrue short is not a real\nthing tall is not a real thing now\npeople are saying what on Earth Dr K are\nyou crazy I'm 52 that's a real thing I\nagree being 52 is a real thing being 64\nis a real thing being short and tall is\nnot a real thing short and tall are\nabstractions of the mind they are not\nphysical attributes height is a\nmeasurable attribute short or tall is an\nabstraction or\njudgment that the Mind makes about a\nphysical\nattribute this is very important to\nunderstand because we do not think like\nthis this is why we get caught in\ninsecurities and everyone's saying it is\nthough no it isn't it is a judgment so I\ncannot measure tall how tall is tall\nwhat is tall 6 foot for a giraffe no for\na giraffe it's different wait hold on a\nsecond what is tall show me the\ndefinition of tall show me the\ndefinition of short height is a\nmeasurable\nquantity tall and short or\nrelative do you understand this oh she\nis tall for a girl he's short for a\nguy man this guy is so short he's 6'6\nwhat are you talking about short he's\nsix 6'6 well he plays in the NBA it's\nshort for the NBA it's all relative in\nan abstraction you cannot biopsy tall\nyou cannot x-ray tall you cannot measure\ntall you can measure height that is\nreal so the first thing to understand is\nthat the ego is about abstraction it is\nabout features of ourselves and\njudgments that we make now a lot of\npeople will say but people all agree\nwith this we get to that in a\nsecond but remember the whole point of\novercoming your insecurity is that the\nnature of an insecurity is caring about\nwhat other people think right so we're\ngoing to try to get rid of that that's\nthe whole point we'll get there first\nthing to understand is our mind there's\nreality and then there's the\nconstruction that our mind\nmakes okay so tall and short aren't real\nthings they're you you useful Concepts\ndon't get me wrong but they are not\nactually reality\nso now the question becomes if I feel\ntall or if I feel short how do I\novercome that so these are attributes of\nthe\nego so the ego is a construction of\ndifferent abstractions about myself so\neven something like I'm a\ndoctor right so you can say I'm a doctor\nI would even argue that that's an\nabstraction you can't x-ray me and find\na doctor you can't biopsy find a doctor\nI have a diploma on my wall I have a\npiece of paper someone else could buy\nbuy a piece of paper and they could\nstick it on their wall does that make\nthem a doctor no well I've been through\nmedical school well there are some\npeople who have been through medical\nschool who aren't practicing Physicians\ndoes that make them doctors well kind of\nI mean technically they're a doctor\nthere's someone who gots a PhD like they\nhave Dr in front of their name does that\nmake them a doctor well yeah it makes\nthem a doctor of\nphilosophy you see what I mean like it's\nall abstractions we create these\nConcepts it's not a physical attribute\nof reality I'm not saying that it\ndoesn't have utility in the\nworld but this is very important to\nunderstand because if you want to\nunderstand insecurity you have to\nunderstand the nature of\nego so our ego is a\ncollection of all of the abstractions we\nthink about ourselves I am a\ndoctor I am a good person I am a bad\nperson I'm a winner I'm a loser you\ncan't biopsy loser you can't biopsy\nwinner I'm tall I'm short I'm pathetic\nI'm awesome these are all abstractions\nthings that we attached to the mind I'm\na Noob I'm an\nexpert I am dot dot dot there will be an\nabstraction that comes\nafterward so how do we overcome\nthis so ego is born of\ncomparison and the more that we\naccept what we are the less comparison\nwill go away and the less ego will\nactivate cuz tall can't exist without\nshort a comparison is necessary for an\ninsecurity I'm so ugly that means other\npeople are beautiful I'm so lazy that\nmeans other people are hardworking so\nanytime you make a comparison anytime\nthe mind has someone else over here and\nyou relative to that other person there\nwill be an insecurity so now let's\nunderstand how going to the gym fixes\nthe\ninsecurity so there are ways that it can\nactually overcome the insecurity and\nlet's understand what the process is so\nI've worked with people who do this\nright so they go to the gym they think\nthey're pathetic they look at all of\nthese other people who are so much more\nin shape than them and they are out of\nshape and we make a comparison look at\nthat person is so great at this and I'm\nso bad at this and then something\nmagical happens cognitively in the\nbrains and minds of these people at some\npoint you know someone gives them a fist\nbump someone who's in way better shape\nthan you are they help you out a little\nbit they spot you they ask you to spot\nthem something weird happens where\nthere's no comparison\nand then you start to see this person in\na different light we're both people who\nare just going to the gym and working on\nour goals your mindset\nshifts and if your mindset shifts you\novercome the insecurity it's not the\nactual getting into shape that can come\nwith confidence and stuff like that but\neven then if you look at the confidence\nwhat is confidence confidence is\nacceptance of\nyourself it is not you relative to\nsomeone else\narrogance is a little bit actually\narrogance isn't the right term but if we\nlook at like ego ego is in comparison so\nsmartest smartest requires someone else\nto be the stupidest but confidence is\nacceptance of who you\nare so the real way to fix an insecurity\nis to accept yourself as you are and not\nattach a label that doesn't mean\ninaction right so it doesn't mean that\nI'm not going to go to the gym what that\nmeans is I accept that my body is not\nideal and I'm going to do something to\ntry to fix it it is an attitude it is\nplaying a single player game so the\nmoment that you\nconvert the multiplayer game into a\nsingle player game the moment you go\ninto offline mode unplug the internet\nand focus on yourself stop thinking\nabout other people the insecurity will\ndissolve this is the way to overcome any\ninsecurity if you look at any insecurity\nit is going to be a comparison to\nsomeone else and as long as it is\nrelative the target will keep moving\nbecause it's relative this is how people\nwith body dysmorphia look at themselves\nin the mirror and they get one cosmetic\nsurgery another cosmetic surgery another\ncosmetic surgery this is the way that\nthe most beautiful people on the planet\nwho are celebrities look at themselves\nin the mirror and they think they're the\nugliest piece of on the planet how\non Earth is this possible it's because\nit's divorced from reality insecurity is\nwithin the mind mind if you disable the\nego the insecurity will\ndissolve we can even understand this in\na moment to moment I'm talking about a\npermanent change but let's understand\nthis when are you\ninsecure you're insecure about your\nappearance when you look in the mirror\nwhen other people see you when other\npeople see you without a shirt so\nthere's a fluctuation in the activity of\nyour\ninsecurity and if you're like me you're\nalso one of these insecure people who\ntries to fix your insecurity by\npracticing in secret I'm going to start\nworking out for 2 or 3 weeks before I\neven go to the gym so that I don't look\npathetic I'm going to start dancing in\nsecret I'm going to start watching\nYouTube videos before I even go to a\ndance class or before I go to the I want\nthis growth to be in secret because I\ndon't want to show people how pathetic I\nam and once I get good in secret then\nI'm going to show up in the world I'm\ngoing to be like look at me I'm so great\noh yeah I just picked it up it wasn't\nactually that hard like I'm God you\nthink I'm talented oh I just I just\nstarted this it's so easy it's like\nthese people like yeah I don't study I\ndon't study you Noob you\nstudy you're so\ndumb we want to be\nbrilliant effortlessly brilliant we\ndon't want to show anyone our sweat our\nblood or our tears this is ego it is\ncomparison it is thinking about other\npeople and you will notice that your\ninsecurity Rises or Falls depending on\nwhether other people are involved\nso remove other people from your mind\nstart to play a single player game\nliterally notice the thoughts that you\nhave that involve a\ncomparison and literally what we want to\ndo is accept what we\nare I'm not in shape or out of I'm at\nthe level of shape that I am it is\nneither good nor bad it is what\nis what are you going to do about\nit so insecurity comes from where you\nwant to be and where you are this Gap is\nthe insecurity this is where I am this\nis where I want to be in this Gap the\nbigger this Gap is oh this person is a\n10 out of 10 I'm a one out of 10 this\nperson is 6'2 I'm 5 foot2 this is the\ngap of the insecurity the bigger the Gap\nthe bigger the insecurity right but what\nthat means is that we require two points\nin order for this to be a\nreality so how do we fix this we take\naway one of the points then the\ninsecurity disappears I am what I\nam am I out of shape\nabsolutely am I going to work out today\nabsolutely am I better than I was\nyesterday absolutely when these three\nthings happen the insecurity will be\nconquered because now it's about I I\nstart here and now I've moved here this\nis progress now this Gap becomes\nprogress this Gap becomes something to\nbe proud of instead of something to be\nashamed of you will flip it on its head\ninsecurities is of the mind it is of\ncomparison it is of the\nego it cannot exist without these three\nthings which is why we feel so secure\nwhen we're by ourselves because no one\nis\nlooking but you're still just as out of\nshape whether someone is looking you\nwith your shirt or without your shirt\nwhat the\nright doesn't make\nsense the insecurities is from the\nexternal observation so if you want to\nconquer all it doesn't matter what\ninsecurity it is you can be short you\ncan be ugly you can be this you can be\nthat you can be pathetic you can be\nsmart you can be stupid doesn't matter\nthe moment that you start focusing on\nyourself and you ignore what other\npeople do or how they treat you the\nbetter off you're going to be now a lot\nof people may say but Dr K other people\nwill mistreat me\nthey do judge me for being short or they\ndo judge me for being overweight or they\ndo make fun of me that's\ntrue I'm not saying that that isn't true\nnow let's understand\nsomething I get made fun of quite a bit\neven today I used to get made fun of\nquite a bit and people made fun of me a\nlot so there are people who can make fun\nof you and what determines whether that\nhurts or doesn't that depends on your\nsecurity or your insecurity\nthe fact that other people make fun of\nyou is the outside\nworld whether you let it sink in is the\ninside World whether you accept yourself\nif someone says all you're not the most\nhandsome man on the planet I'd be like\nyeah you're right bro you're not the\nsmartest man on the planet fair enough\nyou're not the best\nstreamer yeah you're correct I'm okay\nwith that I'm not the best dad I'm not\nthe best gamer I'm not the best streamer\nI'm not the best doctor I'm not none of\nthose\nthings okay I am who I am I accept\nmyself for who I am I'm proud of where\nI've come if you're unhappy with it\nthat's your\nproblem right why do I want to get\ncaught up in someone else's\ndisappointment like what the that's\ndumb I have enough of my own\ndisappointments to deal with I don't\nneed to take on yours it's\nsilly it's the stupidest thing on the\nplanet and I say this as someone not\njudgmental I'm not saying y'all are dumb\nI did this for like 15 years 20\nyears I was taking all of my own\ndisappointments and I was swallowing\neverybody\nelse's right I have enough of my own to\ndeal with and I'm going to focus on\nthose and the more that you focus on\nthose the more that you focus with the\nthings that you are unhappy with\nyourself about stop worrying about other\npeople's judgments because other\npeople's judgments will actually keep\nyou from fixing the problem other\npeople's judgments are rarely as good\nmotivators as you wanting something for\nyourself because anytime you do\nsomething to satisfy someone else that\ndepends on whether they're looking or\nnot so the behavior will increase when\nthey're paying attention and will\ndecrease when they're not paying\nattention this is very frustrating for\npeople who are in relationships you go\nto your partner and you say hey I think\nwe need to start eating healthy and\nthey're like okay fine yeah we need to\neat healthy and they eat healthy when\nyou're around and then they don't eat\nhealthy when you're not around and then\nyou get frustrated or on the flip side\nyou're like your partner is like hey we\nshould eat healthy and they're going to\nthe gym so you're like all right\nwhatever when they're not looking like\nget some nuggies baby let's\ngo see what I mean so insecurity is in\nyour mind it is born of the ego it is\nborn of comparison as long as your mind\nis making comparisons the insecurity\nwill be there so be focused on yourself\nbe focused on accepting where you are\nand take one step forward and then the\ninsecurity will appear if someone wants\nto criticize you fair\nenough they're not\nwrong but your value as a human being\ndoes not depend on that attribute your\nvalue in the workplace may depend on\nthat\nattribute and this is what I've seen\nwith the hundreds of people I've worked\nwith so I became a doctor in 2014 it's\ncrazy to think that I've been a doctor\nfor 10 years saw my first patient four\nyears before that as a first year\nmedical student I've been doing this in\nsome capacity for 14 years that's a lot\nof time to see\npatients blew my mind as I thought about\nit so the objective world may judge you\nharshly but here's the crazy thing when\nI help people let go of their\ninsecurities the objective World loves\nthem for it because as you start\nactually making progress as you hold\nyourself to your own standard as you\nstop living up to someone else's that\ncuts out all the deception it cuts out\noh my God only when this person is is\nwatching that's when I'm going to work\nhard and the moment they stop watching\nI'm going to be lazy when my boss is at\nwork I'm going to work and when my boss\nisn't at work I'm not going to work and\nthen over time what do you think that\ndoes to your value in the marketplace\nnot\nmuch so the beautiful thing is as you\nstop caring about other people you will\nget better and people will respect you\nmore it's crazy\nso overcoming insecurity don't make the\nmistake of fixing your problems I'm not\nsaying don't fix your problems by all\nmeans fix your problems but don't expect\nfixing your problems to fix the\ninsecurity and on the flip side for\nthose of you who are faced with\nunsolvable problems like going\nbald you can't go to the gym and work\nyourself into a full head of\nhair good news you don't need to to\novercome that insecurity you don't\nactually need to fix the\nproblem so stop being bound by the\nproblems of your life by all means fix\nthem by all means make progress but\novercoming insecurity is in the mind is\nin the ego and is born of comparison and\nother people's opinions the more you\nshed each of those things the more free\nyou'll be and the more free of other\npeople's expectations you are the more\nmotivated you will actually be to act\nyou'll tap into this beautiful thing\ncalled inspiration and giving a\ninstead of being motivated by Terror and\nliving up to expectations and trying to\navoid disappointment when you're living\na life of trying to avoid disappointment\nthe best you can ever feel is relief you\ncan never feel\naccomplishment when it comes from you\nthen you can feel pride and\naccomplishment make\nsense questions\nit's like 50% of asmin Gold Stream\ncontent how how\nso what is asmin Gold Stream content\nhave to do with\nthis oh about going\nbalt yeah so\neverything do you think happiness is a\nchoice kind of\nhonestly honestly kind\nof so there there are certain\nNeuroscience mechanisms which correlate\nwith happiness and some of those are\nunder your control that's what I would\nsay so someone's asking what do I do if\nI have a crippling\ninsecurity so this is\nwhere see understand the mechanism of\ninsecurity when you say you have a\ncrippling insecurity what is that\nprecisely how does it manifest in the\nmind when does it activate when does it\ngo dormant what is the source of it what\nmakes it better what makes it\nworse you have to understand the nature\nof\ninsecurity and from a very practical\npersp\nperspective one of the things that you\ncan do is like when you meditate do you\nfeel insecure when you\nmeditate\nokay\num\nokay there's a lot of great\nquestions okay okay so one person is\nsaying if a classical pianist is\ninsecure about performing a piece on\nstage I think the solution is large\namounts of solitary practice not what\nyou just said yes and\nno so remember that what I'm saying is\nthat solving an external problem in the\nworld is solving an external problem in\nthe\nworld so if you don't know how to play a\npiece you should learn how to play the\npiece and lots of solitary practice is\nvery good but I've literally worked with\nclassical penis who go up on stage and\nare insecure despite the fact that they\npractice sufficiently their insecurity\nis categorized as an illness because the\nreal world says you should not be\ninsecure you are a famous classical\npianist who can play this in your sleep\nand yet they remain\ninsecure so this is what I mean about\nthe\nconfidence so you can solve your problem\nI'm not saying don't go to the gym what\nI'm saying is that solving the problem\nsometimes does not solve the insecurity\nbecause the mechanism of the insecurity\nis\ndifferent and there even it's even\nreached the point where I've worked with\npianists who will go and participate at\nthings where they've never practiced and\nthey still have\nconfidence right so there was someone\nwho I was did an event at a bar where\nthey had never played any of these\npieces so they've never practiced and\nthey're still okay with it because it's\nfun because of their attitude so I'm not\nsaying that solitary practice is not\npart of the solution going to the gym is\nalso part of the solution but we must be\nwe must be precise about what the\nproblem is where it comes\nfrom if I'm insecure about romantic\nrelationships which involve other people\nhow do I leave other people out of it\nand work on myself this is a great\nquestion I think we have a lot of stuff\non relationships coming up on Friday by\nthe\nway\nso this great okay actually before we\nget to that I'm going to get to this one\nwhat if I feel selfish only focusing on\nmyself a great question okay what's the\ndownside of being\nselfish is it that people will perceive\nyou as\nselfish so even this could be like one\nof these like meta kind of infinite Loop\nthings what is the problem with being\nselfish I don't feel like a good person\nwhere does that come from do people\njudge you for not being a good person\nright yall get\nthat it's kind of\ncrazy because someone may say no no no\nno they they don't it's not because of\nthey judgment I believe that and I saw\nsomeone else asking chat how can you\ntell if something is like internal or\nexternal is this something you want or\nsomething the external World wants over\non the membership side in miday we have\na deep dive into\nself-discovery so this is going to be\nlike a deep dive it's going to be a 2\nand a half hour lecture and Q&A all\nabout self-discovery and the mechanism\nof self-discovery it's going to be a\nlittle bit more detailed requires some\nstudy ahead of time so that's why we're\nnot just like streaming it as a topic so\ngenerally speaking on the membership\nside we cover things that require\nhomework and preparation and for those\nof youall that want to come and go here\nwe\nare okay so let's understand selfishness\nlike so is it the perception of being\nselfish or or is it like think about it\nokay because you can say like no but I\nwant to do good by others but that's\nsort of like I you know I I haven't met\nmany people most of the selfless people\nthat I've met usually take care of\nthemselves and are totally okay with\nit like here is the time that I devote\nto taking care of myself and here is the\ntime that I devote to taking care of\nother\npeople and the people who sacrifice\ntheir own time for the benefit of others\nare often times not mentally in a good\nplace this is a consequence not quite a\nmental illness but they have a\nvulnerability to their guilt for example\nso if we look at emotions right our\nemotions are sources of information and\nmotivation they're part of our\ndecision-making process they're not the\ndictators but for some people they are\nthe\ndictators I do not control my anger my\nanger controls me I don't control my\nsadness my sadness controls me I don't\ncontrol my guilt my guilt controls me so\nthis is a problem this is something that\nneeds to be\nfixed it doesn't classify as a diagnosis\nbut I would say that as\nunhealthy and so some people are\nselfless out of the avoidance of\nguilt that is your guilt controlling you\nit's not true\nselflessness it is avoidance of guilt\nand then the crazy thing is that if\nsomeone can make you feel guilty they\ncan control your behavior so often times\nwhat happens with people who are\nserially\nselfless chain\ngivers is that they have people in their\nlives who induce guilt and the only way\nthat you can deal with your guilt is by\ngiving someone what they want and\nsacrificing of yourself so sacrifice\nbecomes an antidote of\nguilt and what that means is that you go\non sacrificing you go on sacrificing you\ngo on sacrificing and the guilt comes\nthe guilt comes people make you feel\nguilty people make you feel guilty and\nthen your life becomes empty you become\na husk of yourself you've given away\neverything that you have to give and\nmore this is not\nhealthy\nokay how can I fix the feeling of\ncosting my parents too much I heard that\nas a kid it's ingrained in me so the\nfirst thing to\nunderstand this is a beautiful question\nit's in ingrained it's not true there's\na big\ndifference so the simplest way to\novercome anything that is ingrained with\nyou I'm not saying it's easy but it\nworks is noticing it saying\nah this is an echo from the past it's\nnot a statement of Truth now or it's\neven their perception fair enough\nthey're entitled to their opinion it\ndoesn't make it\ntrue so if you go to psychotherapy will\nhelp people with things like cognitively\nreframing where we don't assume that a\nthought that you have is truth there's a\nbig gap between thought and truth right\nyou can think all kinds of things on\nyour in your head doesn't make them\nreality that's the\nproblem so you recognize that this has\nbeen ingrained so on the yogic side we\nhave this concept of vasana vasana is a\nmental habit that's all it is it doesn't\nmake it true so you'll notice certain\nhabitual patterns of thinking and just\nnotice that this is the Habit this is\nthe Habit this is the Habit The Habit\nreally controls us when we don't believe\nit's a habit when we look at this and we\nthink this my mind is\ncorrect that's the problem is that we\nbelieve our mind not that the mind has\nthe thought so disbelieving your mind is\na very important skill in Sanskrit Vic\ndiscrim\ndiscrimination when I work with people\nlike incels the goal is to help them\ndisbelieve their\nconclusions\nokay\nokay let's look at let's talk about\nshort\nokay hello my name is Rick and I'm a 158\nCM Mexican incel 52 approximately and I\nreally hate it that's been a problem\nsince elementary school I was bullied by\nall the kids there girls included that\ngave me a huge complex with my height\neven\nnow this defect bothers me all the time\nmany girls say that it is prefer to\npreferable to do it with a dog than with\nme in all the posts\non the internet I'm curious how old this\nperson is confirming it and saying that\nI'm the worst that anyone could have\nonly make it worse and that really\npisses me off I'm 20 years old now and\nI've never kissed a girl and obviously\nI've had I've had some obviously I've\nhad some kind of I've had some kind of\nsexual experience or romance in general\nhaven't had I'm assuming this person is\nsaying and that really depresses me I\nfeel very very bad I don't know what to\ndo sometimes I see beautiful girls out\nthere and I want to talk to them but I'm\ntoo afraid to do so especially the tall\nones who ironically are my favorite type\nof girl I'm sure that it will be an\nabsolute failure and that they will send\nme to hell with no other option as has\nhappened to me so many\ntimes now I just want to regain some\nhope and see if there is something I can\ndo or is it just better to it's not\nbetter to self-mutilate I'm just joking\nbut there was a moment when I actually\nthought about it seriously and that\nscares me I don't want to end up like\nthat so what can I\ndo\nokay so I'm 54\nI hate being short people mistake me for\nbeing 12 it's ruined my chances women\navoid me I'm always at a disadvantage I\ncouldn't defend myself they dehumanized\nme they won prize they always won\ndespite being the aggressors I hate how\nI can never change that I'm now that I'm\n20 leg lengthening surgery not a great\nidea y'all we'll talk about that in a\nsecond I hate that I have to spend more\ntime in this useless body that all\nalways loses right so being a short guy\nis killing me this happens again and\nagain and\nagain so this summarizes it\nright so let's talk about being\nshort this is going to be hard\nso see if you're a short\nperson and you grow up in the world\ntoday this is going to be your\nexperience people will make fun of you\npeople will take advantage of you right\nit's an okay thing to make fun of when\nwe're talking about body positivity\nusually it's about weight it's not about\nheight\nright and there are all these like\nthings on social media about like you\nknow people discriminating against dudes\nagainst their height and then the dude\nslaps back and how much do you weigh and\nthen the girl gets pissed off and then\nwe all feel good and we feel\nself-righteous and everyone feels great\nbecause someone else hurt me and I want\nto see them get hurt the cycle of trauma\ncontinues so if you're\nshort the experience of many people is\nthat your life is over that you have no\nchance there's so much\nhatred but the one thing that you should\nreally pay attention to as we look at\nall of these posts is the definitiveness\nof it the concreteness of it the lack of\nflexibility there's no doubt in this\nperson's mind that anything can ever\nchange this is\ndetermined this is not\ntrue now if I say to people this is not\ntrue what will\nhappen people will say Dr K you were\nwrong here is all of the\nevidence and there in lies the problem\nsee if someone says things can be\ndifferent and your immediate responses\nknow they\ncan't what are you doing to your\npossible\nsolutions you're knocking them out\nbefore you even\nExplore the basic problem here is\nclose-mindedness now I know this sounds\nvery very\nunempathic right because here we are\nthese people are struggling I'm not\nsaying that some their life hasn't been\nlike this but it doesn't determine your\nfuture your past doesn't dictate your\nfuture I don't really believe that we\nhave a lot of evidence to the contrary\nright the future is undetermined and we\ncan take actions to influence it but I\nwhat I want youall to do is if I say\nyour life can be better and your\ninstinctive reaction is no it\ncan't think for a moment about what you\ndid when possible solutions came\nalong no it doesn't work for me there's\nno way that that could work everyone on\nthe internet this is a uniform\nexperience so here's the crazy thing see\nif we look at the\ninternet this is what we\nsee what we don't see is the people who\nhave successfully managed relationships\nwhile being short they're not the ones\nthat we\npost so there's a huge selection bias on\nthe interet internet and then people\nwill once again if I say that what\nhappens in the mind of someone who's\nshort but it's been my experience I'm\nnot talking about the internet this is\nhow I literally get treated every single\nday once again I say that there is an\nopportunity the Mind rejects it this is\nthe core\nproblem the most damaging thought that\nyou can have is that this doesn't work\nfor me or when a solution is presented\nif you immediately discount it so I've\nseen this as a\npsychiatrist where I'll say to someone\nhey like I think this medication could\nhelp you they immediately say there's no\nway it's going to help me I've tried 10\nmedications nothing ever\nworks now we must\nunderstand how is it why is it that I'm\nsaying that this is potentially a\ndamaging thing because you're sitting\nthere and you're thinking this is my\nreality Dr K you don't know my\nreality and you're right I don't right\nyou have lots of good arguments as to\nwhy I'm wrong and it so happens that I'm\nnot\nso this is where things get kind of\nshady so if we look at studies of\ncognitive\nbias okay what we see is a lot of very\ninteresting things memory is not\nobjective by any means and furthermore\nthe worse you feel mentally the less\nsubjective memory\nbecomes and it's not just about the way\nthat memories are laid down your brain\nliterally will rewrite memories of the\npast based on current\nexperiences so what we know for for\nexample on studies of trauma is that if\nsomeone gets traumatized let's say\nsomeone gets sexually assaulted their\nbrain will go rewrite all of their\nprevious neutral experiences to be\nnegative this has been\nstudied we also know that there studies\nso Aaron Beck was one of the first\npeople that sort of noticed this that we\nhave a cognitive bias in things like\ndepression and anxiety so what happens\nis that when someone who has a negative\nattitude their mind has a negative cast\nwhen there are positive things they get\ngeneralized and fuzzed out it's not that\nthey become negative so the actual\ntechnical bias in depression is an\novergeneralization of the positive so\nthe negative events are very lifelike we\neven know the mechanism of it or not the\nmechanism what it literally looks like\nthe negative event gets seared in your\nmind all of the positive events become\nfuzzy they get glossed over it's not\nthat you forget them there's literally\nan overgeneralization so if you ask\nsomeone who is depressed about details\nabout positive experiences they can't\nremember any details you ask them\ndetails about negative experiences they\nremember them\n100% so there is a huge perception bias\nand we know that the perception bias the\nstrength of the perception bias\ncorrelates with the negative state of\nthe Mind more depressed you are more\nanxious you are more traumatized you are\nthe more that your perception changes\nthe more that your memory\nchanges so I'm not disputing that this\nis your\nexperience this is the crazy thing that\nthese scientific studies show us your\nexperience is not\nreality and I know that this is so\nunempathic to\nsay right because what are we supposed\nto say we're supposed to say yeah your\nlife is hard and I do believe that by\nthe way there's objective evidence that\npeople who are short struggle they get\njudged harshly people don't give them a\nchance women don't look at them don't\nconsider them some women\ndon't so there are absolutely elements\nof truth but if we look at cognitive\nbias what we see is that most of Life\n25% of it is good 25% of it is bad 50%\nof it is in the middle but the nature of\ncognitive bias makes the 25% become\nneutral the 50% to become negative and\nin in the cases of people who have\nlegitimate reasons to be upset which I\nthink all these people do it's probably\nnot\n[Music]\n25\nokay so this is the fact of\nit and this is where if you're short I'm\nnot saying that you're at a disadvantage\nI mean you aren't at a disadvantage you\nabsolutely are a disadvantage women will\nespecially if you're a dude women will\nlike you know they'll discount you many\nof them will discount you right away\nthat's absolutely correct but it doesn't\ndetermine your\nfuture it is not deterministic is it a\ndisadvantage yes is it final\nno right because they're short people\nwho procreate all the time happens so\nthe question is\nhow and this is where the real challenge\nof being short is that there are two\nthings here right one is what you can\ncontrol and what is what you can't\ncontrol so what I want yall to think\nabout right and we've got women in the\naudience\nso let's ask the women in our\naudience would you want to date this\nperson and if you wouldn't want to date\nthem\nwhy right so even if we can ask the men\nin the\naudience like would you want to be in a\nromantic relationship with this person\npresuming you're gay or they're of the\ngender that you're attracted to or sorry\nyou're gay or whatever right what is it\nthat how do you feel about this\nperson you know and and this is where\nlike now now we have to be super careful\nbecause the rubber is hitting the road\nwhen you look at this what are people\nsaying right and what people are saying\nis not because they're short right so we\nhave women in our audience right now who\nare responding to this live\nright and some people are saying how big\nis their banana right so we're getting a\nfull range of responses responses but\nthe overwhelming response is this person\nis too negative and too\ninsecure some people are even getting\nexcited they're saying I can fix them\ngreat no purely because of how they hate\nthemselves and think so lowly of\nthemselves\nso this is both the joy and the terror\nof the healthy gamer\nCommunity where\n70%\nmen 29% women 1%\nnon-binary something like that so we\nhave women in our community and this is\nwhat's so frustrating about being a man\nwho hates how tall they are and hates\nwomen for not giving them a chance is\nthat sometimes women will give you a\nchance\nwomen are saying it's the negativity\nthat's the biggest turnoff and that's\nwhat I would agree with as well and if\nyou're a short person in the world today\nyou can't fix your height and I know\nthat people have leg lengthening surgery\nand stuff like that this is anecdotal\nokay so I'm not talking about randomized\ncontrol trials and stuff like that but\nanecdotally I have never met a person\nwho has had leg lengthening surgery who\nis not like up by it bluntly and\nthe SLE size is small this is we're\ntalking like less than 10 people okay so\nmaybe it's gotten a lot\nbetter but what we're talking about so\nleg lengthening surgery is usually the\nthe the method that I'm familiar with is\nthey fracture the shin\nbone and then they insert metal rods\nbetween the two halves of The Shins and\nthey give you a couple of\ninches but often times these people have\ndebilitating pain have difficulty\nwalking it doesn't really seem worth it\njust for the few like you can't like\nlive your life normally after\nthat maybe I'm just seeing bad outcomes\nlike some of these people have gone\ninternationally to have the surgery done\nI don't think I've work maybe one person\nhas had it done in the United States so\nI'm not saying that it's like an overall\nbad procedure I'm just sharing my\nanecdotal experience of like it comes\nwith a lot of costs that people don't\nrealize when they go and get it done\nwhich is like you can't go hiking\nanymore because you're in like\nrelatively constant\npain maybe the surgical method have\nimproved and maybe outcomes are better\nmaybe it's fine now who knows I mean\neverything gets better in medicine so it\nprobably won't be like that\nforever and so the crazy thing here is\nthat like I hate to say it because it's\nan answer that you don't like right no\none likes this\nanswer which is that you got to work on\nyourself you can't fix your height but\nyou can work on the other\nthings can you get in shape can you\nbecome better at\nflirting can you get better at\nsocialization can you become more\nprofessionally successful can you do all\nbecause these are all of these things\nare under your\ncontrol now a lot of people will say I\ncan't get better at socialization\nbecause people don't even talk to me\nthey won't even interact with me so\nthere it is again we come to the most\ndamaging thought which is the immediate\nrejection of\nhelp and if we really look at someone I\nwant yall to think about this two\npeople one person immediately Rejects\nhelp one person does not which one do\nyou think is going to do better in\nlife now a lot of people will say but I\nhave a reason for rejecting help I agree\nI'm not saying that you don't have a\nreason I'm not saying that you haven't\ntried and it's still\ntrue that if you immediately reject help\nif you don't try to do things then\nthere's almost zero chance of\nimprovement and then some people will\nsay I have\ntried to which I will say I hate to\nbreak it to you but try better try\nharder try again that's the only\nway right and this is where we have to\nTunnel down into a lot of details that's\nwhat we do here why do we stream over\nand over and over\nagain because when I say try better I\nknow that that's a dumb answer you're\nlike how that's why we have everything\nelse that's why we teach you about ego\nthat's why we teach you about ADHD\nthat's what how we teach you about\nbenefits of narcissism\nsociopathy that's how we teach you about\nhow to build your\nconfidence that's how we why we teach\nyou about depression and anxiety and\nborderline personality disorder and how\nto\nmeditate that's why we teach you about\nthings like ADHD and\nobesity and how adipocytes are not inert\nfat storage cells but are hormonally\nactive\nthat's why we teach you all of these\nthings but we can teach you all this\nstuff it's not going to make a flip of a\ndifference unless you\ntry cognitive flexibility number one\nthing these people need this is what I\nwork on especially with incels all these\nfixed beliefs it's the fixedness of the\nmind because once your mind becomes\nfixed you reject information that is\ncontrary to it which only solidifies\nyour\nopinion so if you talk to an incel\nyou'll see this where people will say\nthis could be different and the incel\nwill say no it\nisn't that's the\nproblem so do you\nuse your understanding to shape the\nevidence or do you use the evidence to\nshape your\nunderstanding right goes back to this\npaper this is such a great paper man\nsee if I can find it again oh hold on\nchat I find\nit right so if y'all were here earlier\nwe talked about how baldness can be an\nadvantage which is crazy because we\ndon't think about baldness as an\nadvantage baldness is a disadvantage but\nhere it is\nchat when you add individuating\ninformation to someone who is bald they\nbecome more socially like\nokay so let's talk about individuating\ninformation so if you're a dude or a\nwoman who has a stereotype that is\nagainst you so we're talking about being\nbald being short being fat pick whatever\nit\nis The Stereotype is real The Stereotype\nwill result in an instant Judgment of\npeople against you but you can actually\nmake make up that ground and more by\nadding individual individuating\ninformation what does that\nmean so when we have a stereotype we\ndon't judge you for you we have that\njudgment to begin with right and this is\nthe big problem with people who are\nshort is they don't get it no one gives\nthem a fair\nchance so what it turns out is that it's\nnot that people do give I don't know if\nthey give you a fair chance they\nprejudge you that's absolutely correct\nbut the beautiful thing is the more\nindividuating information you add to the\nequation the more their esteem of you\nwill go up and will even rise above what\nthey would give someone who is taller or\nhas hair or whatever you can surpass the\nphysical\nattractiveness by adding individuating\ninformation now what does that mean\nadding individuating information that is\nexpressing parts of yourself that do not\nconform to The\nStereotype so if we look at the women in\nchat today we asked them would you date\nthis person why do you think these\npeople don't date short people it's not\nbecause they're short it's because\nthey're\nnegative and then you will counter that\nyou'll say but this person made fun of\nme because I was short these girls made\nfun of me like if you're in high school\ngirls will make fun of you for any\nreason it's not because of the reason\nit's because other people are making fun\nof you that's what happens in\nschool is everyone dog piles whatever I\nmean like I got made fun of for being\nHindu right it's not like being Hindu is\nan objective disadvantage in life I mean\nmaybe it is I haven't seen research on\nit but everyone dog piles on to\nsomething because that's what kids do\nbecause kids are\n because kids are\ndoesn't mean you're a pathetic person I\nwouldn't trust them that's been them\nright that's the age that you grew up in\nyou're 20 things will be different you\nfind decent human beings and they'll\ntreat you decently it's not about your\nheight it's about the decency of the\npeople that you interact with and what\nyou bring to the\ntable so if you are if people sort of\nlook at short people as negative which\nis fair enough right because we see that\na lot and if you happen to be the one\npositive short person you will gain\nground and this is what I have seen in\nthe short Kings who are in healthy\nrelationships did they have to work\nharder than their tall comrades 100% was\nit fair to them absolutely not but they\ncan get\nthere and if y'all are asking me what do\nI do about this I'm saying you can get\nthere is it unfair no I mean yes is it\nfair absolutely not are you going to\nhave to work harder absolutely can it be\ndone absolutely will it be worth it\nabsolutely so add individual\nindividuating information separate\nyourself from the crowd of the other\nshort people from the other bald people\nfrom the other overweight people from\nthe other unemployed people doesn't\nmatter what it is any stereotype add\ncolor to your personality show them that\nyou are not just this stereotype and\nwhen you do that you will pick up ground\nit's not just going to compensate for\nthe Discrimination you will actually\noverachieve that's what this one study\nshows now this is not a study that is\nscientifically definitive this is an\nexploratory study that found one signal\nI'm cherry-picking this out of a swath\nof data not not that the majority of the\ndata says the opposite but very few\nstudies will look at this\nPrecision is a very well-designed\nexperiment it's a signal of hope it's\nnot scientific proof it's evidence of\nsomething not a definitive conclusion so\nI'll be the first to admit\nthat but I've seen it so it gives me\nhope and it can give you hope too\nall\nright so someone saying genuinely\ncurious how much this concept has\naffected me in life now it's affected\neveryone so\nmuch see this is what's\ncrazy when people look at their lives\nthey think their lives have been\ndetermined by external\ncircumstances like I'm short or I'm bald\nor I'm overweight or I'm poor or\nwhatever we're not saying that those\nthings don't affect him they can affect\nthem a\nlot but in my overwhelming experience as\na psychiatrist and as a meditation\nteacher I've been seeing patients for 14\nyears I've been a doctor for 10 years\nI've been teaching meditation for 20\nyears what's crazy is yeah your\ncircumstances determine a lot about your\nlife but it it's what goes on in here\nthat shapes your life every moment of\nevery day\nthis has so much more power over your\nlife than the external circumstances and\nI know it's hard to\nbelieve and you say Dr K every moment of\nevery day what about when you're\nsleeping this shit's working even when\nyou're sleeping we have dreams we have\nnightmares we have emotional processing\ngoing on while you\nsleep so I I worked with a couple of\norts\nteams and I'm not as good at the video\ngames as they are so what was my job to\nshape this because when you shape this\nit shapes the performance in the outside\nworld and Esports is a great example of\nthis right so like shaping this doesn't\naffect how good your opponents\nare it doesn't affect whe what the game\ndevelopers decide to patch in terms of\nbalance\nchanges This only affects your behavior\nit affects your expectation it affects\nthe way that you respond to things so\nthis is the crazy\nthing in life your life is not\ndetermined by what happens it it's\ndetermined by how you respond to what\nhappens you all understand\nthis my girlfriend broke up with me am I\ngoing to go into a three-year long\ndepression where I staying hung up on\nher stock her social media and drink\nevery\nday\nor am I going to say to myself that\nsucks it really hurts I feel depressed\nfor a while but I have more experience\nat relationships I will be a better\nboyfriend in the\nfuture and there are serious problems\nthat I brought to this relationship that\nI can\nfix you all get this and Carol DW has a\nton of research on mindset\nit is what goes on in here that\ncorrelates with outcomes growth mindset\nor performance mindset this shapes your\nlife every moment of every\nday the circumstances happen just once\nin a while you say oh this girl rejected\nme how many girls reject you a\nday how much does this control you a\nday now you may say but Dr K I can do\neverything that I can up here and I\nstill can't shape the world I\nagree right you can't shape the world\nyou can't make someone like\nyou I mean I should know\nthat here I am talking about the\nproblems of the\ninternet and how much of a difference\ncan I make\nnone I can't shape your thoughts I can't\nfix your problems I can't give you\nadditional height there's no secret\nMantra that will make you 2 Ines\nI mean maybe there is who knows there\nactually is a sidhi that is described in\npatanjali's yoga sutras siddi means\naccomplishment or Perfection that allows\nyou to change your size shrink down to\nthe size of an atom or grow to the size\nof a planet or universe or something\nlike that that's what it said apparently\nit's in there who knows I don't know how\nto do it and I certainly can't teach\nyill so what difference can I\nmake I can look at this oh my God look\nat all this negativity on the internet\nit's like trying to empty the ocean with\na\nspoon and so then the question becomes\njust because I will have no effect and\ncan't fix the problem well let me\nrephrase just because I can't fix the\nproblem does that mean I'm going to stop\ntrying\nno and look at where we are interesting\nno is my mind better than your mind am I\nmore capable than you are no\nthat's the crazy thing right I have a\nmind just like yours I have a brain just\nlike\nyours everything is about the same my\nkarma is different fair enough my\ncircumstances are\ndifferent you'll see the absurdity of\nwhat we're doing here like this is crazy\nwhat can one human being do very little\nor is it a lot oh interesting well hold\non a\nsecond hm is it a lot or is it a little\nyou tell me you pick I'll take your\nanswer you're the smart one\nhere someone saying some of us might\nhave brain damage we took some hits yeah\nwhat makes you think I\ndidn't I had some pretty\ndegenerate years in there\nbro see this is what I mean I 's like no\nI'm Different I mean yeah you are right\nlike no two human beings are the same\nbut y'all are making a lot of\nassumptions of I mean I don't know if\nyouall know this I was in a fraternity\nin college\nokay like that's\nnuts right someone else is saying yeah\nI've played League yeah I've also played\na lot of\nmobas like you don't you don't think\nthere's trauma there I don't know what's\ngoing onong with my hair but\nwhatever um\nall right I got some good stuff you know\nI got to say the meditation works good\nchat the yoga\nhelps just because you done some damage\nto your\nbrain like the big difference is not the\ndamage I've done it's what I've done\nafter the\ndamage right it's what you do after it's\nwhat happens up\nhere are we doing meditation today sure\nlet's do meditation\ntoday what kind of meditation do you\nwant I stared at a wall and went with a\ngirl what does that even\nmean what's a fraternity for non- us\nfolks so there are social organizations\nwhen you attend a university\nthat usually involve a lot of\npartying so sometimes they make\novertures at being professional and\nstuff actually the one that I was a part\nof was like pretty good in that way so\nit wasn't just about partying but it's\nalso like a bunch of dudes living\ntogether partying a\nlot um\nokay let's let's become an Adam all\nright so I've never done this before but\nlet's give it a\nshot so let's meditate and see what we\ncan figure out I'll work on this a\nlittle bit but let's see if we can\nfigure out something about becoming an\natom who\nknows right because there we can here's\nthis thing that Dr K is talking about\nit's all up here it's like oh I don't\nknow how to become an atam oh\nI don't know how to become an atam I\ndon't know how to become an Adam are we\ngoing to let it stop us from figuring it\nout let's figure it out together chat so\nwe're going to sit\nin a position where our back is straight\nour neck is straight our head is\nstraight so for those of you all that\nhave been here for a while we're also\ngoing to teach you one little trick to\nincrease the straightness of your\nspine so tip number one is try to keep\nyour knees below your hips\nif your knees are below your hips it\nwill be easier to straighten your spine\nthe second thing to understand is that\nthe spine has a natural curvature okay\nso we have something called the lumbar\nregion of our our spine we have\nsomething called lumbar lordosis which\nis that the bottom of our spine kind of\nlike bows out I guess you can't let me\ndo this here we go let's talk\nabout oh let's just look at a picture of\ngive me a second\nchat okay this is\nbeautiful okay let's look at the left\nlateral view of the spine from neets I\nwas debating should I just pull out the\nbook I think this is probably better so\nif we look at this we have the lumbar\ncurvature so this is the front of the\nthis is the person is facing this way\nokay this this is the left lateral view\nso we have a cervical\ncurvature and we have a thoracic\ncurvature and we have a lumbar curvature\nand we have a sacral curvature so what\nthis means this is your lower back this\nis your lumbar region so our belly is\nkind of sticking out our thorasic\ncurvature of the spine means that our\nspine is a little bit bent\ninwards around the area of our heart so\nthat we have space for all our organs\nlike lungs and stuff and then we have a\ncurvature of the spine like this\nokay so one thing that you can actually\ndo is tilt your head slightly\nback and while that may feel like it's\nincreasing the cervical curvature if you\nlook at some of these yogic texts and\nstuff it may straighten out your\nthoracic spine some by actually tilting\nback a little bit okay so if we want to\nkeep a super straight spine what we want\nto do\nis have our legs or have our knees lower\nthan our\nhips and we can add a slight curvature\nyou're kind you'll sort of kind of Fe\nyou don't want to go too far back but\nyou can tip your chin up just a little\nbit\nokay and now what we're going to do is\ngo ahead and round out your shoulders\ntip your head back a little bit let your\nspine be straight your neck be straight\nhead be\nstraight and take a a few moments to\njust notice your\nbreathing I want you to settle down into\nthe\nposition and now what I want you to do\nis observe the space outside of you\nand this may seem kind of weird but what\nI want you all to do is notice that you\ncan feel the\nemptiness so feel yourself surrounded by\nThe Emptiness there's an experience of\nspace and notice that\nand now what I want yall to do is pull\nback a little\nbit now I want you to notice that right\nat the edge of your\nskin there's almost a cushion of warmth\nthat extends immediately past the\nphysical boundary of your body\nso it can almost feel like a\nmist or a\ncushion or\nair it can feel a little bit warm a\nlittle bit\ntingly so notice that that there's the\nspace outside\nand then there's this cushion of warmth\nright around the edge of your\nbody and now I want you to notice the\nboundary of your physical\nform notice all the places that you're\nsitting and you have\ncontact and so your body is sending you\nsignals and now we're going to go\nwithin so I want you to focus on the\ninside of your shoulders your arms\nand notice a warmth\nthere you can feel the presence of\nyourself in the middle of your arms and\nyour\nshoulders once again a warmth almost\nfeels the same as the stuff on the\noutside\nand now we're going to pay attention to\nnot warmth but\ncoolness the coolness in our nose a\ncolumn of cold in the middle of our\nthroat that ex extends down into our\ntorso and Poss possibly\nabdomen so follow that\nchannel almost like flowing water\nnow if you can feel the warmth and you\ncan feel the coldness what you'll notice\nis that there's a point or a layer where\nthe two\ntouch because the sensation of cold\ndoesn't suffuse your entire body usually\nif it does that's cool\ntoo but notice that the warmth is in one\nplace and the coolness is in another\nplace\nand now comes the hard\npart so once you find the\nbarrier notice that the warmth must\noriginate from somewhere because we know\nwhere the coolness comes\nfrom and now track the warmth back to a\npoint\nand settle on that on your Atomic\nnature the point of\norigin of your warmth\nand now comes the final part of the\nmeditation which is that we're going to\ncome back we're going to open our eyes\nbut our attention will\nremain on that singular point of warmth\nthe\norigin and we're going to try to hold\nour attention there even as we return to\nthe world and as we make that transition\nwe're going to remember it where it\nis now come back\nand now you can let go of it and see if\nyou can find it again bounce away and\ncome\nback okay now\nso okay now let's talk about\nmeditation so the first thing is why\ndon't youall why don't you tell us\nwhether you could feel\nanything so let's let's do a poll\n[Music]\nokay what feel nothing no clue\nbrauh um\npoint so\nNaval\nheart\nCrown\nother so let's start this okay so let's\nsee what people\nfelt um and then let's see if we can do\nthat on the\nYouTube side give me a second chat then\nwe're going to learn a lot of weird\nstuff now okay a lot of weird stuff so\nget ready\nchat how do\nI oh boy okay let's see if uh I don't\nhave access to the YouTube stuff so\nhopefully we have YouTube\nmods\nokay all right\nso 20% of people didn't feel anything\n38% of people felt something at the\nheart 28% of people felt something\nsomewhere\nelse so let's talk about this so the\nfirst is that not all kinds of\nmeditation will resonate with all kinds\nof people the second is that depending\non your practice at meditation and how\naware you are of subtle Sensations you\nwill be able to detect or not detect\nokay so it's okay not all meditations\nfor all people you don't necessarily\nneed to go searching for it if you're\nnot experienced in meditation I would\nsay practice meditation for about 90\ndays meditating at least once a day no\ndays off by the way and then come back\nand do this\nmeditation okay second thing is people\nfeel things in weird places so let's\nstart with the weirdest thing that we\nfeel so\ntype one in chat if you felt something\noutside of\nyourself to if you did not feel anything\noutside of\nyourself\nokay all right so I'm kind of getting a\nlot of\n50/50s but a lot of people are feeling\nthings out outside of themselves so this\nis the first really weird\nthing okay I felt surrounded is that a\none yeah that's a one if you feel\nsurrounded and you have no parts of your\nbody there that's a\none okay so this is\nweird because we have no sensory we have\nno nerves there we have no nerves\noutside of\nourselves right so how do we feel things\nout outside of ourselves so let's\nunderstand the science of it the first\nis we have this thing called a smata\nsensory\ncortex and sometimes the smata sensory\ncortex which interprets our\nproprioception which is our ability to\nfeel where we exist in space so if I\nhold my hand up like this even if I'm\nnot looking I can feel that my hand is\nup so the first thing is that this could\nbe an illusion of the somata sensory\ncortex which we know happen\nso if we look at things like Phantom\nlimb syndrome we can remove a part of\nyour body and your smata sensory cortex\nis like ow it\nhurts so we actually have scientific\nevidence of sensory\nexperiences where we have no physical\nsubstance so if we're taking a hard\nbiological reductionist route we say\nthis is just an illusion of the mind\neven then I'll take it because it feels\ngood even if we take a hard biolog iCal\nreductionist approach we know that for\nsome reason chilling in that space\nactivates our hypothalamus to reduce our\nsecretion of\nact which then reduces our secretion of\nCR which then reduces our cortisol\nsecretion great still a win even if it's\nall in our mind a phantom in the brain\nfantastic book by the\nway the alternate thing is is that we\nhave a perception of that doesn't\nexist and this is what's super cool see\nin science we don't know how to explore\nthat we don't think it's worth exploring\nbecause it's a sensation that has no\nphysical whatever but through the\npractice of meditation we can explore\nthe realm of the\nnon-physical so we can feel a vastness\nwe can feel a cushion we can feel\nsomething kind of warm just feel it\nthat's all and you will go later it'll\ngo so if you go in that direction we\nwill feel ourselves connected with the\nuniverse now what does that mean\nconnected with the universe that means\nyou will have a subjective sensory\nexperience of existence around\nyou you all understand that could be a\nphantom in the\nbrain but right now you feel this\nand if you practice this you will feel\nthat now this is kind of interesting\nbecause this\nhas\nbenefits this we know scientifically\nthis is what's fun about this half of\nthis is complete BS from a scientific\nperspective but half of it is like\npretty\nlegit so if you look at let me see if I\ncan find this\npaper um\nlet's see if I can oh not\nimages okay hold on let me see if\nthis okay so this is not the paper I'm\nlooking for but we can show it anyway\nso this is a paper called from the\nNeuroscience of Consciousness called\nself Unbound ego dissolution and\npsychedelic\nexperience\nso\num this is not the paper that I'm\nlooking for but it's it's still a cool\none it seems like I think I've read it\nbefore there's another\none uh let's try this\nhere we\ngo ah this is\nit oh looks like there's a couple\nokay so\num so depression and anxiety are often\ncorrelated to self- rumination in a\nheightened sense of self and making\nsufferers unable to withdraw from NE\nrepetitive negative self-referenced\nthought patterns okay so when our mind\nis constantly thinking about ourselves\nin a negative way it correlates with\ndepression and anxiety some researchers\nhypothesize that the therapeutic effects\nof psychedelics come from their acute\nsubjective effects specifically ego\ndissolution by reviewing five studies\nthat examine this correlation this\nreview found that the majority of\nstudies could present a moderate\ncorrelation this suggests a negative\ncorrelation between the degree of ego\ndissolution and therapeutic improvements\nin disorders with a heightened sense of\nself so what this\nmeans is that we now have some studies\nthat show that psychedelics can\npotentially be helpful I still do not\nrecommend for you yall to go and use\nthem there's also cases of psychedelic\ninduced PTSD and anxiety disorders but\nnow what's pretty cool is we're studying\nthis stuff and as we study it we're\ntrying to figure out hold on a second\ntotally fine psychedelics induce\nimprovements in in depression or anxiety\nbut\nhow what is going on like how is this\npossible and what we discover is that in\nthe Psychedelic uh uh experiences where\npeople are just like hallucinating and\nstuff there's very poor clinical\noutcomes\nthe good outcomes come when there's ego\ndeath so once you have a connected\nexperience to the universe around you\nthis becomes less\nimportant there's also other kinds of\nthings that come from this because when\nyou have a connected experience to the\nworld around you what you also discover\nis the world is\nchilling so do this practice for 40 days\nin the morning and in the evening do a\nmandala\nand just feel what the rest of the\nuniverse is\nlike and it's straight chilling\nsomething cool happens once you realize\nthat the Universe At Its base is\nstraight chilling insecurity will get\nbetter because the opinions of others\nare all localized to this\nperson this person is not everything\nelse universe is just chilling I can\njust chill too\nright and so what we know also the\nmechanism insecurity remember insecurity\nis about ego is about the sense of self\nis about the barrier of you and now we\nhave a mechanism we have an experience\nwe don't need psychedelics meditation is\ngood\nenough we can abandon the ego abandon\nthose ruminating thoughts about myself\nwhether I'm short whether I'm pathetic\nwhether I'm bald all the same thing all\nsame crap this what's cool about the\nyogis the yogis were like let's not fix\na particular problem in the mind let's\njust bypass mind\nentirely who cares about how see this\nreally confus me when I was studying\nmeditation and Eastern medicine and\nstuff like that I was like where's all\nthe Psychiatry where's all the\ndepression do this anxiety do this anger\ndo this they don't have any of that I\nwas like how do I what's different\nbetween depression that's because the\nyogis like transcend mind entirely all\nof those things are bound within the\nmind you just move past the Mind you'll\nmove past all of it and this is why\nmeditation is an evidence-based\nclinically effective treatment for any\nmental illness narcissism bipolar\ndisorder depression\nschizophrenia transcend mind and it'll\nget you'll everything will get better so\nthat's experience number one and how we\ncan understand it connect with the\noutside\nworld experience number two if you felt\ncoldness suffuse the warmth and warmth\nsuffuse the coldness if you felt a\nblending of that we didn't walk you\nthrough that study this and you will\ndiscover yin and\nyang so for those of you I said find the\nlayer between warmth and\ncoldness if it was like this study that\nand you will discover Yin and\nyank if you don't know what that means\ndon't worry about\nit for the rest of us if you didn't feel\nanything just try again in 90 days for\nthe rest of us who felt what we\ndescribed and you felt a point of\nsomething focus on that point focus on\nthat origin of warmth Focus on that\nnidus of\nself and really see where does this go\nwhere does the warmth suffuse does it go\nall the way outside me explore explore\nexplore this is real\nmeditation it's not mindlessly doing\nsomething or even mindfulness I don't\nthink this is like that so the kind of\nmeditation that I like and often times\nteach is this weird esoteric stuff and\nthis isn't even super esoteric this\nisn't like Thun and stuff there's all\nthese weird things that people talk\nabout in meditation like I'm one with\nthe universe oh my God like we are all\none with the universe let's all circle\njerk come on let's go I'm one with the\nuniverse this is not an intellectual\nconcept this is an experiential concept\nOneness with the universe is not\nsomething to be found in song lyrics\nalthough in in song lyrics and poetry we\nget closer to it than in pros and in\nscience this is an experience\nI can feel something outside of me I can\nfeel the\nuniverse now if we ask Dr ramachandran\nauthor of phantoms in the brain Dr\nramachandran may say this is the somata\nsensory cortex creating an illusion of\nexperience now this becomes kind of\ninteresting so if we have activity of\nthe somata sensory cortex how do we know\nthat activity of the somata sensory\ncortex is an elusory acity as opposed to\ninterpreting a signal from something\nlegitimate out there we don't really\nknow that there are some studies that\nsuggest that we may know that and we can\ntell the difference between apples and\noranges but just think about it right so\nthe smat sensory cortex receives nervous\ninput via the thalamus fair enough but\nsomething is causing it to activate it\ncould be detecting something we just\ncan't detect what it is detecting so we\nassume that it doesn't exist we just\nlike a\nreasonable reasonable view I\nthink so focus on either the outside\nworld or the atomic nature of\nyourself now will this give you the the\nsidhi that Yogi pangali talks about who\nthe knows certainly not\nme could\nit yall tell me do this practice for a\nwhile see what happens maybe you can\ngrow a foot taller report back chat\ndo kyans get close to this sure in some\nways but in other ways no you can\nachieve this through Kiran but they\ndon't go the same route geans are like\nthey have it easy geans you go where the\ngearan takes you this is where we decide\nwhere to\ngo all\nright I'm going to be 9 ft tall hey\nreport back\nchat see have all the impossibility of\nthe things that I tell you all to do if\nyou're bald if you're\nshort I think we can fix that can you\ngrow foot I don't know\nchat I don't know I wish I could say I\nbelieve but I don't\nknow but that's for you to figure out\nright you you figure it out you i' I've\ngiven y'all enough answers the rest of\nit is you\nall right chat we go a we got a I gotta\nrun I got something in a little while so\nit's been awesome being here today thank\nyou all so much for coming today this is\nour 1 this is May 1st we're launching\nmental health
