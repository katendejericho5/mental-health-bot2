    "transcript": "I think men especially we are not taught\nhow to manage our emotions so we become\nvulnerable to our emotions and our\nemotions shape our behavior and then\nwhat happens this is how we lose agency\nand control of our life because other\npeople figure out that if I can induce\nguilt in you I can control you if I can\ninduce shame in you I can control you if\nyou are not willing to help me move I'm\ngoing to make you feel guilty and then\nyour ass will get in line I will punish\nyou for not making the sacrifice that I\nasked you to make they will induce some\nlevel of guilt so one of the core things\nthat we need to do is understand that\nthere is a torrent of negative emotion\nthat will come when you will shed an\nexpectation this is totally fine"
