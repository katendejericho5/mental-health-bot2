    "transcript": "the problem with gifted kids is that\nthey don't want to change they want to\nlive up to a falsity they don't want to\nabandon the idea of being a gifted kid\nin fact they try really really hard to\npreserve this idea of being a gifted kid\nthey want to live up to their potential\nthey want to become something they are\nnot but this is very very difficult\nbecause once again you're entering this\nrealm where the most that you can do is\nlive up to expectations and even a\npartial success becomes a failure it is\na game that you cannot win and so the\nwhole point is that even if you're\ntreated like a loser if you're bullied\nif you have low self-esteem you want to\nstrive to change but the problem with\nthe gifted kid is that they strive to\nbecome what other people want them to be\nand this is really problematic because\nthe strength in life comes from who you\nare not a false idea of who you want to\nbe"
