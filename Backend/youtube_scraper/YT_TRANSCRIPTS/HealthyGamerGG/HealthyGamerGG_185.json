    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about what\nseparates the top 10% of performers from\nthe bottom\n75% so I know when we look at a lot of\nsuccessful people we'll be like oh my\nGod like all these like successful CEOs\nand stuff like these people who are in\nfinance they're like they're a little\nbit sociopathic they're a little bit\nnarcissistic they're self-centered right\nwell actually yeah they are and that is\na huge part of their success so as a\npsychiatrist I've worked with all kinds\nof people so I was in Boston for about\n10 years where I worked with people who\nwere from like the MIT and Harvard\nincubators so these are startups that\nhave CEOs that have these very very\nbright ideas and are building these\nhundred million 300 million dollar\nbillion dollar companies I've also\nworked with a lot of high performers\nfrom the fields of medicine so people\nlike surgeons as well as people from\nFinance like golden Sachs and stuff like\nthat and then I've also worked with a\nlot of degenerate Gamers I've worked\nwith homeless people I've worked with\npeople from jail I've worked with people\nwho are addicts right so people who are\nlike 32 years old addicted to heroin and\nhave nothing to show for it hey just a\nquick note a lot of people will ask us\nwhat do I do next and that's why we\nbuilt Dr K's guide It's a comprehensive\nresource that distills over 20 years of\nmy experience both as a monk and as a\npsychiatrist and it's designed in a way\nthat's tailored to fit your needs so if\nyou're interested in better\nunderstanding your mind and taking\ncontrol of your life check out the link\nbelow and what I'd love to share with\nyou all today is what separates these\ntwo groups of people and I'm going to do\nit in a very specific way so the problem\nis that most of the time when we look at\nsuccessful people we'll say things like\noh this person is disciplined or this\nperson is good at resource management\nbut the problem is that when we look at\nsomeone who's successful we don't know\nexactly how to do that right I can tell\nthat I suck at managing managing my\nresources and I can tell that they are\ngood at managing their resources but I\ndon't know how to actually get better so\na good analogy of this is like if you\nlook at a gardener who has a really\ngreat Garden you're like that person has\na green\nthumb noting that that person has a\ngreen thumb doesn't actually make you\nany better at gardening when we use the\nwhen we use these terms like discipline\nor green thumb or we say wow that dancer\nIs So Graceful looking at someone and\nsaying that they're graceful doesn't\nteach you how to be graceful you don't\nknow what they're actually doing that\nlooks like Grace when they move right\nthere's a specific set of actions that\nthey take that look very impressive oh\nthis is a green thumb but you don't know\nactually what the gardener is doing\ntoday that's what I'm going to teach\nyouall I'm going to teach youall three\nspecific cognitive things that I see in\nthe majority of the high performers that\nI work with and as it turns out these\nactually have to do with narcissism\nsociopathy and neuroticism so we tend to\nthink about these three things as bad\nright but let's remember that sociopathy\nnarcissism and neuroticism are features\nof the human race we all have these to\nsome extent when we look at something\nlike narcissistic personality disorder\nor um antisocial personality disorder\nwhich is what we call sociopathy these\nare when these features of us are so\nextreme that they start to become\nproblematic but y'all may have observed\nthat people who are quite successful are\na little bit more of an than you\nare and there's a good reason for that\nand we're going to actually teach you\nhow to be that in a good and positive\nway so the first thing that we're going\nto start with is sociopathy so one of\nthe really interesting things is if you\nlook at psychiatrists and surgeons we\ntest higher on the sociopathy scale than\nthe average population so let's\nunderstand a little bit about what\nsociopathy means it doesn't mean that\nwe're evil right so it has a lot of\nfeatures to it what sociopathy means is\nthat we have the ability to restrain our\nempathy we don't get bogged down so when\nI'm a psychiatrist and have\ndepressed people walking into my office\nevery single day and I spend eight hours\na day listening to their problems I must\nput up some kind of empathic\nshielding in order to not get bogged\ndown by this and this manifests in\npeople who are very successful in a very\nspecific way they are very good at not\ngetting suckered into short-term\ncompassion and instead leaning into\nlong-term compassion so I'll give you\nall an example of two people in my\npractice so two of them had a very\nsimilar situation when they turned\naround 17 or 18 something happened in\ntheir family one parent basically left\nthe household they had two younger\nsiblings each it's crazy how similar\nthese two cases are one person leaned\ninto short-term compassion made the\nsacrifice for their family and was like\nyou know what the right thing to do is\nto not go to college and help raise my\ntwo siblings because my remaining parent\ncan't do it all by themselves the the\nonly choice that I have is to do the\nright thing so this person didn't go to\ncollege got kind of stuck in a menial\nlabor job and then 10 years later like\neven their siblings were not doing great\nbecause now you have this culture in the\nhousehold of like not achievement but\nsurvival and all this kind of stuff a\nlot of struggles later on in the\nalternate case we have someone who\ndecided that you know like yeah it sucks\nthat this is happening but what I really\nneed to do is like if I really want to\nprovide for my family I need to leave\nthem behind I need to go to college they\nworked incredibly hard in college got an\namazing job so this person grew up\nincredibly poor and then you know got an\nawesome job and and is now making\nliterally millions of dollars a year\nabout 10 years later and the other super\ncool thing is that this person now\nserves as a positive role model for\ntheir younger siblings so their younger\nsiblings are now crushing it because 6\nyears after they went to college they're\nmaking\n$250,000 a year which helps their family\nway more than making $35,000 a year\nworking a IIA labor job for a couple of\nyears so was it hard on their family for\nthose few years that they were at\nCollege absolutely but the key thing\nthat I see about people who are very\nsuccessful is that they do not sandbag\nthemselves through compassion and so\npractically what I want you to do is\nlook at your life right so what what is\nthe price of short-term compassion what\nare the sacrifices that you make in your\nlife in order to be kind and generous\nand supportive to the people around you\nbecause what I find in a lot of people\nwho are in the bottom half of success in\nperformance in an objective sense I'm\nnot saying that they're bad people I\ndon't think anyone's a bad person I mean\nthere are some people but not the\nmajority what I tend to see is some\npeople get suckered into short-term\ncompassion get guilt tripped into crap\nand then end up shooting themselves in\nthe foot they sacrifice so much and then\na year later they don't have anything to\nshow for it but the people in their\nlives benefit from their sacrifice so\nyou need to be a little bit more\nsociopathic be a little bit more focused\non yourself don't sort of get suckered\ninto that short-term compassion the\nsecond thing that we're going to talk\nabout is narcissism and this manifests\nin their mind in a very specific way\nit's not just be a bigger and\njust care more about yourself no no no\nno so what I sort of see as a feature of\nnarcissism is the people that I work\nwith that are incredibly successful are\nvery skilled at saying no now now pay\nattention to my words skilled at saying\nno doesn't mean that they say no more or\nthat they say no less what that means is\nthat their\nproficiency with the concept of no is\nvery high so what they know is when to\nsay no and when not to say no so what\nthis looks like practically is that you\nknow they're able to say no to their\nfriends and even their boss or their\ncolleagues when you need a little bit of\nhelp with this a little bit of help with\nthis a little bit of help with this if\nyou have difficulty saying no people\naround you will figure that out and as\nthey figure that out they will lean on\nyou for a lot of help and support and\nthings like that and especially if you\nhave low self-esteem this can be\nincredibly crippling because if you have\nlow self-esteem where does your\nself-esteem come from it comes from\nother people being so grateful that\nyou're helping them out and then you\nkind of puff up your self-esteem because\nnow you've loaned this person another\n$100 right because makes you a good\nperson makes you a good friend oh my God\nlike this person I'm paying their rent\nmakes me such a good person\nand then over time what ends up\nhappening you're sandbagging yourself\nbecause you're not investing in yourself\nso you have to get better at saying no\nand here's what I've noticed a simple\nTrend right so we're going to try to\nmake this applicable no green thumbs\nhere we're going to Tunnel\ndown if there are opportunities which\nwill benefit you in the future say yes\nif you are saying yes to\nmaintain what you have here today be\nsuper careful about that so what I found\nwith my patients who are very high\nperformers is that they are more likely\nto help someone new than help someone in\ntheir life for the fourth or fifth time\nif this person asks for my help four\ntimes five times two or three times sure\nbut if they keep on asking for my help\nI'm going to say no and I'm going to\ngive my help to someone else what this\nmeans is very practically my boss needs\nme to work an extra weekend I'm going to\nsay no but there's someone else at a\ndifferent company or or someone one of\nmy friends who's starting this project\nand there's some kind of Consulting gig\nI will say yes so it's not that you\nshouldn't work hard at your job or\nanything like that I'm not saying bosses\nare evil and there are many people who\nwill learn how to say yes for their\nbosses because their bosses invested in\nthem they're the nice people you're\ngoing to learn something you're going to\ngrow as a result but they're really\nskilled at saying no and the biggest\ndifference that I see is that more\nsuccessful people say yes to newer and\nnewer opportunities and newer and newer\npeople as opposed to these same people\nover and over and over again right\nonward and upward and be helpful all\nalong the way the third thing that we're\ngoing to talk about is neuroticism so\nthis is where if I look at the the\npeople who are quite successful they use\nsort of this B tier coping mechanism\ntechnique so if you look at the\npsychology or the Psychiatry of coping\nmechanisms and outcomes from coping\nmechanisms they're basically three tiers\nof coping mechanisms you have the top\ntier of coping mechanisms like cognitive\nreframing you have the second tier of\ncoping mechanisms which are action\noriented I know it's kind of weird that\naction oriented is a middle tier we'll\nexplain why and then at the bottom you\nhave something called emotion focused\ncoping so when I work with people who\nare high performers what I notice is\nthat they utilize that middle tier and\nI'll explain what that is so when they\nare unhappy when they have some kind of\nnegative experience inside them the way\nthat they fix that experience is by\nfixing the environment okay so for\nexample if my boss is unhappy with me\nwhat I'm going to do is work incredibly\nhard to make my boss happy with me if I\nget a bad performance review I'm going\nto work as hard as I need to to get a\ngood performance review if my boyfriend\nor girlfriend is unhappy with me I'm\ngoing to work extra hard to make them\nhappy if my parents are unhappy with me\nI'm going to work extra hard to make\nthem happy so what they literally do is\nthey look at even we'll use a different\nkind of example let's say I look at\nmyself in the mirror and I am ashamed of\nmyself the way to fix that shame is to\ngo to the gym this sounds very\nreasonable right why is this the middle\ntier what the like I want to be\nable to do that we'll get to that in\nsecond so what these people end up doing\nis trading suffering for Success because\nwhen you start to use this kind of\ncoping me mechanism there's no internal\ncontentment see this is very important\nto understand this means that in order\nto fix my internal feelings I need to\nshape the outside environment so if my\nboss doesn't like my work I need to work\nextra hard now this is a little bit\ntricky because what if your B boss is a\nnarcissistic what if your boss\nis is overly demanding what if your boss\nlacks compassion that means that your\nboss will never be happy with you no\nmatter how hard you work and so what\nthis creates is a really interesting\nsituation because really pay attention\nto this on the one hand it means your\nboss is never happy and you're always\nsuffering but what it also means is that\nyou're working your ass off constantly\nwhich helps you rise over time so this\nis what we kind of call toxic Fuel and\nif we look at people like studies on\nmedical students what we find is that\nmedical students have some of the\nhighest neuroticism which means\nneuroticism is a tendency for internal\nworry medical students have no chill and\nwhat that does is that that have no\nchill that Panic makes them study on a\nFriday night in the library instead of\ngoing out to party because everyone else\nnormal people are like I studied all\nweek now I can have fun the\nmedical student is like it's never\nenough I could fail oh my God what if I\nfailed then I won't get into med school\nand I won't do this and I won't do this\nand I won't do this and all of my life\nwill fall apart so there's it's very\ninteresting and and this is what's kind\nof weird is it's very adaptive in the\nshort term so when these people work\nwith me I try to help them get out of\nthat tier because as long as you are\nshaping your external environment to\nmake you feel better that also opens you\nup to other kinds of things so for\nexample it's very healthy to look at\nyourself in the mirror and say you know\nwhat I'm unhappy with the way that I\nlook let me go to the gym but some\npeople when they look in the mirror and\nthey've gone to the gym they're still\nnot happy with the way that they look so\nthey need to do something more oh let me\nget some fillers let me get a little\nchin tuck let me get some Botox let me\nget a little bit of plastic surgery let\nme get some lip filler right because\nthat feeling no matter how much you try\nto fix it on the other on the outside no\nmatter how much I try to make my\ngirlfriend love me more make my boss\nhappier with who I am make myself\nconfident with who I am in the Mirror by\nshaping my body that can get out of\ncontrol very very quickly so while it\nresults in success it costs\nsuffering at the end of the day though\nthis is what I see in the top 10% of\npeople that I work with they are a\nlittle bit more sociopathic they are a\nlittle bit more narcissistic and they\nare a little bit more\nneurotic and if you're someone who's in\nthat bottom 50% or you're not happy with\nwhat you're doing in your life I would\nencourage you to do these three things\nask yourself am I a victim to shortterm\ncompassion do I actually sabotage not\nonly my own life but the capacity to\nhelp help other\npeople by sort of sacrificing in the\npresent day and if the answer to that\nquestion is yes you need to cut back on\nthat right really be a little bit more\ncalculated and speaking of being\ncalculated be a little bit better at\nsaying no when is the right time to say\nno and when is the the wrong time to say\nno if I say yes to this person will I\nneed to say yes tomorrow will I need to\nsay yes the day after that and the week\nafter that because if so this person is\ngoing to be a sandbag for you it's not\nthat I'm saying don't help those kinds\nof people but just recognize what that\nwill do to your life it'll move you out\nof the top 10% to the 20% 30% 40% and\nthe more of those people you have in\nyour life the more you're going to sink\nand the last thing is if you want to\nstart to use some of that toxic fuel\nright so if you have some negative\nemotions and this is something I should\nhave kept in mind so the bottom 50% of\npeople use something called emotion\nfocused coping and so what that means is\nwhen I feel bad in here I'm just going\nto fix the emotion I'm not going to do\nanything in my outside life what I'm\ngoing to do is numb it usually video\ngames substances things like that or\neven things like venting so what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm going to go to my\nfriends and I'm going to about my\nproblems and I'm going to feel better\nbut my life will actually not be better\ntomorrow so don't use emotion focused\ncoping it's better to use\naction-oriented coping and then one day\nwe'll talk about cognitive reframing\nwhich is a topic for a different day\nbecause what we're focus on right now is\nhow you get your ass from the bottom 75\nto the top\n10\n[Music]\nB"
