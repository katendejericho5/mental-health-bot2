another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is allo kenoa just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if youall have a medical cons or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional I've got something on my\nokay so be it GG chat if youall have a\nmedical concern or question please go\nsee a licensed professional so today\ny'all we're going to be doing another\nviewer interview I know we haven't done\nthem in a little while but super psyched\nwe're back to talking to people in our\ncommunity\num part of this change has been because\nwe are uh how can I say this so since\nwe've started making like Standalone\nvideos um it makes it easier for us to\nlike do different things on stream and\nso a lot of times for Standalone videos\nlike they're great uh they're great when\nwe do like lectures and stuff on stream\nwe'll still continue to do that but like\nI I basically like film on the weekend\nand stuff too now instead of just\nstreaming\neverything and that helps us sort of\nmake a tighter cleaner kind of lecture\num sometimes like I need to do it live\nbecause I need y'all to interact and\nwe've got questions and stuff like that\nit just depends but since we're still\nmaking like a lot of different stuff\nthat gets uploaded directly um we're\nstreaming kind of separately and it it\nit's all cool so we've got a viewer\ninterview today awesome dude will see\nwhat's going on in his life but I\nimagine it may be in some way similar to\nwhat's going on in yall's lives uh\nbefore we hop into to that interview um\nwe are are we started doing memberships\nrecently that's been going awesome so\nfor those of y'all that are not aware\nyou know we started doing memberships\nfor people in the community who wanted\nto um get more in-depth on particular\ntopics that we cover on stream and stuff\nlike that part of the reason we did that\ninstead of just doing it generally on\nstream is because the audience on stream\nlike comes and goes so the deeper that\nwe go the more people feel like left out\nor left behind or like they don't know\nwhat we're talking about so we cover it\nseems like mostly it's\nbeen spirituality stuff so uh we covered\nlike uh sort of advanced topics on Karma\nwe're doing our part two of advanced\nattachment and then the other cool thing\nis that the topics get decided by y'all\nso what happens is we do voting a month\nin advance y'all decide what to what\ny'all want and then I will do resarch\nand prepare lectures that depend on what\nyall want so for me it's been a really\nfun experience because like basically\nwe'll do like a couple of lectures and\nthen people will say like okay this part\nof the lecture we really really liked\ncan you please do like an entire segment\non this particular topic so we're kind\nof going deeper into stuff it's also fun\nfor me because um you know I get to go\nlike I get to share more of what I've\nexplored and stuff like that so it's\nit's a lot of fun if youall want to join\nus we're more than welcome to have you\num\nand a couple of other things so like you\nknow some people have expressed concerns\naround pricing and stuff like that um so\nyou know all everything is on there for\nvods so if you join now you get to watch\neverything in the past and that's okay\nright so we're really doing this to try\nto help people and at the same time\nmaking more content costs more money so\nsometimes we charge for stuff so um yeah\nso we'll be uh sourcing and voting on\ntopics over this weekend you can join\nat any point and then just join in on\nvoting if there's something that yall\nwant me to cover we can absolutely do\nthat so it's been a lot of fun we've\nbeen sort of like learning together\ngrowing together and it's it's been a\ncouple months and it's been a blast so\nstrongly recommend y'all check it out\nokay so we are going to talk today let\nme just hop into this\ncall and I got to fix a couple of\nthings hello give me a second no no one\ncan see you yet okay and I just realized\nI need to do\nthis uh can you count to 10 for me one\ntwo okay great and then I just need to\nchange your name because I forgot to do\nthis nope not that\none this\none okay so you're what do you go\nby um You can call me Jacob\nJacob okay so did I get the spacing on\nthat okay that looks off center scuffed\ngive me a second Jacob one\ntwo does that work maybe that works did\nwe do it okay all right Jacob do you\nmind shifting over just to\ntouch like this one\nyes pro pro and and count to 10 for me\nno no right way count to 10 for me okay\none two 3 three four five okay six\nbeautiful welcome\nJacob thank you how you doing\nman very on edge I'm very nervous okay\nas we discussed earlier you know if it\nif you feel nervous or you want to stop\nwe can stop at any point bro it's\ntotally fine don't feel you know it's\ntotally fine usually people as we get\ninto it like the nervousness kind of\nmelts away but if it doesn't for you and\nyou're you know not comfortable that\njust bow out and just take the L and\nmove on I'm sure it will okay um and so\nwhat do you want to talk about today\nJacob yes I have so much stuff in my\nmind to be honest great it's difficult\nto know where to start yeah just what's\non your\nmind\nah okay um\nrecently recently I've been having uh\nproblems with uh relationships with\nfriends okay and and like maybe romantic\nrelationships but that's always been\nkind of like an issue with me\nokay sounds rough man yeah um I feel\nlike I I've tried my best to maintain\nrelationships or like get better at\nmaintaining them and like reaching\nWithin Myself\nto get to other people like friends um\nmake sure they're doing okay cuz I feel\nlike I used to be terrible at that I\nwould just kind of like not think about\npeople or I would think about them but\nnot worry about how they're doing and I\nfeel like to be a good friend you should\ncare about the people around you but um\nI feel like it doesn't get\nreturned\nokay\nyeah so I really struggle with\num wondering like am I the problem but\nthen I I have to think about it and I'm\nlike I really can't I don't think I can\nbe maybe I am sometimes\nbut yeah so J Jacob you said you should\ncare about the people around you do you\ncare about the people around you feel\nlike sometimes I don't\nlike like I just don't and it makes me\nfeel like a bad person okay because you\nkind of said reaching within yourself so\nlike I kind of got this idea of like you\ngot to dig deep to be a good\nfriend\nyeah yeah yeah and and sorry to you know\ncall call attention to that I I you know\nI think just we're just being honest and\npaying attention right and and we'll\nwe'll get to the Judgment later okay but\nfirst let's just map things out and try\nto understand where this is coming from\nand and so um can you tell me a little\nbit about your relationships like\nfriendships um what do they look\nlike I've had I've had\na few I'm I mean not totally a popular\nguy honestly like school was tough um I\nwas bullied in Middle School um for\nbeing gay even though I'm not gay okay\num yeah very confusing Time of My Life\num but I still had some friends who like\nstuck with me I had one that didn't um\nso that really sucked now I think about\nit kind of like I try not to think about\nit too often cuz I feel like that's\nreally something that like hurts when I\nthink about losing a friend because\nyou're just not cool enough or whatever\num but I've had one friend since the\nthird grade Although our\nrelationship isn't exactly on the best\nfooting and then I've had a friend since\nI was like five but we don't really talk\nanymore even though he lives nearby he's\nprobably like my my closest friend\nprobably has cared about me the most\nalthough I think he struggles with\nshowing it\ntoo and\num another friend that I met in high\nschool when I\nmoved and we still we still talk often\nbut he got a new job so he's been busy\nso I've just kind of been like alone\nlike I haven't really had any close\nfriendships where I can just talk with\npeople hang out play games or whatever\nso I'm noticing that a lot of these\nfriends seem kind of like historic so\nwe're talking about friends you've had a\nlong time for a long time yeah what\nwhat's been hard what's what's been\nchallenging about making connections\nwith new\npeople just have so much doubt and fear\nthinking about trying to reach out to\nsomeone and like just hang out with them\nand have a good time because I just like\nI feel like I'm not so sure about\nmyself\nokay I guess I guess that's the way I\nwould explain it and what are you unsure\nabout\nyourself well I kind I guess it kind of\ngoes back to being the good friend thing\nor like if I'm just like a good person\neven though like I feel like you know\nI'm not a terrible person I don't go\naround like shooting people and like\nstealing and whatever drunk driving or\nanything like that but like then I think\nabout like\nI was thinking about like if I'm not\ngood enough because I feel like a lot of\npeople treat me like I'm not and so I\nfeel like that gives me a lot of doubt\nin like trying to make new\nrelationships when you say a lot of\npeople don't treat you like you're good\nenough what does that\nmean like\num I feel like so like I have a lot of\npeople at work that I talk to and like\njoke around with we have fun\nand I would consider like one of them to\nhonestly kind of just be a like a work\nfriend I guess like someone you only see\nat work but they're like they're just\nyour friend basically\num and it's really they treat me pretty\nwell for the most part but then I feel\nlike I'm still not just just not good\nenough\nlike it I don't know I just don't\nmaybe I'm asking for too much I'm not\nsure yeah so I I want let's notice\nsomething right so when when you so I I\nwant us to pay attention to something\nwhich is when you run into a\nproblem what is the reason for the\nproblem right so like we just talked\nabout this work situation and then you\nended up\nsaying maybe I'm just expecting too much\nor something like that I don't remember\nexactly yeah what said I think that's\nexactly what I said right so so like\nonce again like it kind of comes back to\nyou yeah like am I am I am I silly for\nexpecting so much so let's just pay\nattention to that pattern and let's see\nsure what which other statements you\nmake that kind of like end back on you\nyeah yeah um but so I'm still a little\nbit a little bit confused so so you said\na lot of people don't treat me like I'm\ngood enough can you tell me what can you\npaint me a picture of that\nfeel like\nI used to not care so much about people\nand I used to not like I was failing in\nschool and I didn't put all this effort\ninto things and So eventually you know I\ngot older and like I'm you know getting\nclose to 30 I'm like I'm 27\nso I feel like the more effort I put\ninto things the more disappointing\nthings have become and one of those\nthings is relationships where I used to\nnot care because it was kind of like my\nsafe space where I could just avoid\neverything and then I moved into\ntrying and then I still I don't get what\nI've been trying for for so long and so\nit makes me feel like there's something\nwrong with me yeah I mean that sounds\nthat sounds like let me just make sure I\nunderstand you dude so on the so you've\ngot a couple op option right we can\navoid in which case nothing happens and\nwe're not trying which is okay nothing\nspent nothing gained right and then on\nthe flip side we have trying and\ndisappointment which means still nothing\nhappens but now a lot spent nothing\ngained and and I'm also guessing that\nyou're looking around and you see like\nother people and like other people try\nto make friends but they get\nsomething it seems so\nand and so I'm almost envisioning like\nthere's like a variable right so there's\nlike effort equals friendship but effort\nplus whatever Jacob is equals not\nfriendship or no result so there must be\nsome individual\nFactor yeah is that how you see it does\nthat make sense to you or resonate with\nyou or yeah okay can you tell me what\ntrying looks\nlike well I'm not so good at trying with\nthe whole like hey do you want to hang\nout thing\nor like whatever I'm not very good at\nthat at all but I try to make more\neffort into like asking people how\nthey're doing like that's been a\nstruggle for me because I just never\nreally cared yeah I just didn't care\nwhich I feel like makes makes me a bad\nperson but\nlike I I don't know I\num I do care about people like I want\npeople to be happy but I'm terrible at\nshowing\nit and um how do you know you want\npeople to be happy\nbecause I don't want people to suffer I\ndon't want people to be upset I don't\nwant them I don't want bad things to\nhappen to them I want them to have good\nthings in life let me ask a better\nquestion where do you care about people\nwhere within you does the not wanting\nbad things for other people come\nfrom I don't know it's just kind of like\nthis\ninner fluctuation of\nlike I just want generally\nthe world to be happy I want I want the\npeople around me to be happy because I\nfeel like happy people make for a better\nlife like that's just how it is um and I\ncare about like my mom or like my\nbrother like I want them to be happy\nbecause that makes me happy okay so I'm\nnoticing almost like a a difference in\nquality between the caring that you have\nfor your mom and your brother and like\nthe rest of us\nI mean that kind of makes sense because\nthat's your family absolutely right yeah\nwe're not saying anything's wrong we're\njust pointing let's understand where do\nyou play games Jacob um I've played so\nmany video games from my life that used\nto be like my whole thing is like I\ndon't know if I was addicted when I was\nyounger but I definitely played a lot of\nvideo games what are some of your\nfavorites I used to love Counterstrike\nbut now there's just cheaters in it you\ncan't even play the game rough the whole\nlike it used to be bad back then but now\nit's like every game's a cheater so oh\nmy God you can't even play it anymore\nbut I have like over 2,000 hours in that\nand then\namateur I feel like 2,000 hours is a lot\nunless you're like you know the guy with\n10,000 hours I I feel like it is too but\nliterally yesterday I was playing a game\nof Dota 2 with one of my friends and I\nyou know you're you're somewhat of a\nvalve enjoyer and so they were telling\nme that my account looks like a smart\nbecause I only have 357 wins and they're\nlike anyone under 500 wins looks like a\nSmurf but I'm like dude I've been\nplaying this game for 14 years and I\nhave like a 40% win rate and like I'm\nnot a Smurf and he's like yeah I know\nbut it looks like it's a fake\naccount so nice yeah all right so CS go\nwhat\nelse um I've played a lot of um Call of\nDuty okay um like mod Warfare 2 Cod Noob\nyeah I've played a lot of battle 2\neveryone was talking like back then like\nBattlefield was the better game cuz it\nwas the one you could fly vehicles or\nwhatever which I kind of agree but also\nCall of Duty has its own place okay so\nif we if we look at FP you want to tell\nme more other games or is that oh yeah\nI've played so many I've played so many\ngames like Terraria played the crap out\nof that I've played strategy games Okay\num play I play rocket League I have like\na thousand hours in that okay okay so\nlet's focus on FPS for just a second\nsure so for phase one is like there's a\nmap right so like I sometimes rarely\nmake the mistake of playing an FPS game\nand I just get dumpstered like dumpster\ndumpster dumpster because like you have\nto know the maps right yeah for\nCounterstrike that's really important or\nlike Call of Duty for me it feels like I\ndon't know like people just show up like\nI'm I'm going to like walk down this way\nand then like I just get shot from\nbehind I'm like where' that guy come\nfrom and I'm like I'm going sneak around\nthese [ __ ] and then I try to\nsneak around and Pop I get popped as I\nwalk around a corner and I just don't\nknow the maps right so OverWatch is\nprobably the FPS that I've played the\nmost recently which is like years ago um\nso so for phase one what we're going to\ndo is we're just going to like learn the\nmap we're not going to judge we're not\ngoing to said something's good something\nis bad we're just going to like try to\nunderstand what does the map look like\nokay all right so you care more about\nyour brother and your\nmom\nobviously yeah\nwhy I know I feel like I already said it\nthey're like they're family they're\nclose to you like what makes someone\nclose to you\ntime spent um knowledge within the\nrelationship like just knowing each\nother okay like um just closeness I feel\nlike just always being there okay okay\nso presence knowing each other time\nspent MH what about these people at\nwork I mean I spend time with them but\nnot outside of work so I know I know my\none cooworker quite well but yeah she's\nnot you know only known for what a year\nand a half maybe is that a long time or\na little time I feel like a year and a\nhalf is not a super long time but it's\nlong enough to get to know someone\npretty well I feel like do you know them\nwell I don't know everything about her\nbut I know quite a bit does she know you\nwell I feel like she knows me but not\nquite as well as I know\nher cuz I don't I talk a lot about\nmyself when it comes to certain things\nI'm kind of closed off as a\nperson\nokay\nwhy I feel like that's a lot\num just trying to think of\nlike where to start with the\nthat one reason may be\nbecause I don't like opening to people\nand then end up hurt or\ndisappointed okay um I also feel\nlike I just lost it there's another\nreason in there but it's gone now\ninteresting yeah so then let's just\nfocus on the one that you came up with\nsure\nsure so so uh tell us about hurt and\ndisappointment when you open\nup um I feel\nlike I try\nto talk to people about things and I\nfeel like I'm I just get told that I'm\nwrong all the time like people just\ndoubt\nme can you give me\nexample not\nnecessarily\nlike maybe it's just that I can't accept\nit because I feel like at work sometimes\nI make a mistake or just do something a\ndifferent way but then like it's the\nwrong way or something maybe it's not\neven the wrong way it's just not the way\nthat somebody wanted me to do it or it's\njust a silly way to go about\nit\num but this this idea of of opening up\nand being hurt and disappointed must\nhave happened before work\nyeah yeah definitely I feel like I can't\nreally go in depth with like where that\ncomes from because I just don't even\nknow how long have you felt that\nway a long\ntime a long time when you were a kid\num if you want me to be honest I feel\nlike\nthat probably comes from like my family\nwhen I was a kid yeah\nlike I remember\nuh just not being able to talk to my mom\nabout stuff and I still really\ndon't\nand one thing was like she went through\nmy stuff one time and found this like\nnotebook that I wrote In where it was\nlike just like depressing stuff because\nI was just\nsad\nand that kind of that really betrayed my\ntrust and I feel like I just can't trust\npeople with things like\nthat so I guess that's kind of\nlike yeah I just feel like I just can't\ntrust people ever since I was a\nkid so how old were you when this um\nwhen you were writing in this notebook\nI was probably\nlike 10 maybe 12 wow it's a real\nviolation of\nprivacy\nyeah and what and you know you don't\nhave to I know you didn't want to tell\nyour mom and here we are noting a\nviolation of your privacy but do you\nwant to do you feel comfortable telling\nus a little bit about like what you were\ngoing through at the time or what was so\ndepressing about your\nlife you can say\nno and we can just work around yeah yeah\nI'm trying to remember to be honest\num remember this is like ridiculous\nthinking about it like honestly it's\nkind of sad um I was like fighting with\nmy mom I think not like fighting\nfighting but probably like yelling a\nlittle bit with my mom\nand she told me that I have no life\nas a kid I was like 10 or 12 or whatever\nwhen I was writing in that\nbook that stung I feel like as a\nkid and and when you when she said you\nhave no life like isn't like your\nloser like what do you mean by no life\nokay yeah and it's\nlike man how could a kid be a loser like\nand then I write in that book and then\nshe\nlike she found it and showed it to me or\nwhatever and it's just\nlike really like that's supposed to be\nfor me trying\nto get away from telling that being told\nthat I have no life as a\nkid so I'm I'm a bit confused so you you\nguys had the argument she tells you\nyou've got no life and then you write in\nyour diary or whatever and then she\nfinds it and and what does she do when\nshe shows it to\nyou she did ask me if I genuinely like\nfelt that way because I was\nlike writing about how I was\njust I wrote that I wanted to kill\nmyself I feel\nlike that would have been a little\ndramatic like a little over over the top\nback then like I was just sad and\ndepressed because of probably like a few\nother things too like maybe some other\nthings built up I can't remember though\nbut I just remembered that moment where\nshe told me that I have no life and then\nI wrote In the book about how I was sad\nand like I was like maybe I should kill\nmyself and then she asked me if I really\nmeant\nthat and what did you\nsay\num I thought about it for a second and I\ntold her like I was just venting which I\nfeel like is mostly\ntrue I know it's I know it's weird I\ndon't know how to describe it though I\nthink you're doing a great job oh thank\nyou I'm not just saying that I think\nit's it's actually like I think we all\nknow because I mean you said it's mostly\ntrue yeah what about the other\npart I have struggled with\num Suicidal Thoughts um and depression\nfor some periods of my life it comes and\ngoes what's your understanding of why a\n10-year-old would write something like\nthat that what are they what are they\nlooking for in suicide do you\nknow now that I like really think about\nit that's honestly\nlike kind of messed up that I would\nwrite something like that is like 10 or\n12\num\nI think that I\nwould either\nbe I don't know that's kind of\nlike maybe cu cathartic writing about it\nand getting it out to find some place to\nget it out\nmaybe I was looking for some form of\nattention because I just felt like I\nwasn't being heard or\nseen um although I feel like that might\nnot be true because I wrote it in a book\nand then hid\nit I mean it wasn't even really yeah it\nwasn't really hidden it was out in the\nopen in a bookcase it's like it just\nlooked like a\nbook um\nyeah\nI no go ahead I I wasn't sure what I was\ngoing to say no I mean I I think like\nlet's just like take a step back and\njust think about like let's not when you\nsay kind of messed\nup what does that mean like I agree it's\nkind of messed up but like what in what\ndirection of things messed up like I'm\nconfused like what do you think is\nmessed up about that\nsituation the fact that I would be as\nlike 10 or 12 brought to that point\nwhere I would be writing in a book about\nbeing sad and depressed and my mom\nsaying I have no life and then talking\nabout killing myself I think that's\nmessed up because like a kid should not\nbe doing that I mean not that I\nshouldn't have been doing that but that\nlike they shouldn't be brought to that\npoint they shouldn't be brought to that\npoint so I want you to once again pay\nattention to your language okay right so\nyou did it again where you said I\nshouldn't be doing that and then you\nsaid a kid shouldn't be doing\nthat right or a shouldn't be brought to\nthat point yeah I was just trying to\nlike clarify cuz I feel like saying I\nshouldn't be doing that would be like\nsaying I shouldn't be doing that but I\nfeel like overall it's okay for a kid to\ndo that but the\nwhole thing the whole situation was kind\nof not good it's not a good situation\nit's not a good it's [ __ ] up yeah\nwhat's [ __ ] up about\nit being sad and depressed or being\npushed by other people or like kind of\nbrought to that point like that's what I\nwas saying is kind\nof a kid having nowhere else to go to\nthe point where they writing a book\nabout wanting to kill themselves yeah I\nmean I I I think that makes a lot of\nsense like in this I agree with your\nassessment of [ __ ] up so like what I\nsee when I see very young children who\nare express some amount of suicidal\nideation or dialogue or whatever um you\nknow if we kind of look at it clinically\nI think very few of them are are and\nwe're not talking about you here cuz we\ndon't really know but you know if we\nlook at it clinically very few of them\nare actually have like an intent to end\ntheir life so usually like if you look\nat a 10-year-old a\n10-year-old wants their current\nsituation to\nend yeah right they want they want they\nwant the situation to be over yeah and\nso often times when we're looking at\nlike really young people what we see is\nthat like they don't know how to make it\nend\nyeah right so like if life is this like\nI don't have the ability to change my\nlife and so if I don't have the ability\nto change my life like if the life if I\njust went to sleep one day and I never\nwoke up the next day then like I would\nbe free of this yeah so often times when\nwe look at it clinically it's really an\nexpression of\ndistress is is how I think about it\nright it's like it's like I don't know\nhow to get out of this\nand I don't like it\nand and yeah and is that does that track\nfor\nyou yeah I feel like that's probably a\nbetter way to put it than what I was\ntrying to say I was kind of trying to\nget to that point but I didn't really\nknow how to say\nit what makes you think you didn't say\nthat I mean I realize I use different\nwords but yeah I feel like you put in a\nmore like clear and concise way yeah\nwell I mean sure but I think I knew what\nto say because of what you said I I\nthought you painted us a pretty vivid\npicture of like Mom calls you a loser\nyeah right you like write in your diary\nbecause you can't like talk to her about\nit and then we haven't really scratched\nthis yet but we're just going to say it\nright and then my mom finds it and then\ninstead of like saying\nyes you kind of treated me like [ __ ] and\nyou really hurt my feelings you said I\nwas venting and it sounds like you\nabsolved her of all\nresponsibility yeah I feel like as a kid\nI shouldn't have done that but I didn't\nknow any better of course like yeah\nright so so I but like I think it's like\nwhat I'm sort of noticing is like\nthere's a lot of\nisolation\nyeah yeah like I like sometimes I feel\nlike I'm isolated and sometimes I\nself-isolate well yeah I mean because\nit's like if when you don't isolate this\nis what happens yeah why the [ __ ] would\nyou not isolate right makes sense right\nyeah so so we were I asked you this\nbecause I was asking about like examples\nof when you were hurt or disappointed\nfor trying to maybe connect with other\npeople beautiful example by the way any\nothers come to your mind I mean sad but\nvery sad yeah I still think about it of\ncourse like that much is clear tops of\nmy head just only but only when you\ndon't avoid thinking about it\nright sometimes you avoid thinking about\nit yeah I mean like I'll think about it\nfor a second then just kind of like move\non avoiding it yeah\num I feel\nlike now okay so another example I could\nbring up\nis um being bullied in high school\nwasn't terrible Middle School is worse\ncuz like I said I was called Gay even\nthough I wasn't gay and I got made fun\nof it fun of for it and um in high\nschool it kind of transitioned over a\nlittle bit but so there's that one\nfriend that I was talking about where he\nkind of went off to do his own thing\nwith his friends that he found um I\ntried hanging out with them in\ngym but they obviously didn't like me\neven though I kind of like I just wanted\nto be with my friend you know I didn't\nreally care about the other ones\num\nand they weren't terribly to me but I\nremember one day\num this day [ __ ] sucked cuz I got I\nwas just chilling like just goofing off\naround um you know like the mats you\never like have wrestling mats in a gym\nthat you just lay them down yeah so I\nwas just like messing around in that and\nthen for some reason they just decided\nto spray me with Axe deodorant like\nspray the crap out of me and pissed me\noff so like I was ready to like fight\nsomeone and so I pushed the M\naway and it fell over and then the\n[ __ ] teacher yells at me and I'm\ntrying to explain to the teacher I'm\nlike they're spraying the [ __ ] out of me\nwith ax spray and I'm like go pick it up\nI'm like they [ __ ] they can pick it up\nand I just got like even bullied by my\nteacher and then that day I think I was\njust so [ __ ] sad cuz like it just\nfelt like nobody was on my side\nand then just more\nisolation that's rough man yeah it's\nterrible because it you know schools\nthey don't care about who's guilty no\nthey don't they just kind of really do\narbitrarily punish either the thing that\nyou see that's going wrong they don't\nthey really don't pay attention to the\ninciting\nBehavior yeah right there's no like\ninvestigation they're not they're not\nthe bandwidth for it I feel like it's\nhard to you can't keep track of every\nsingle situation that happens yeah it's\nit's challenging and and yet you still\nget yelled at for being the victim of\nbullying which is like a story by the\nway that I hear way too much of like you\nknow someone getting pushed and pushed\nand pushed and you try to talk to people\nyou try to do something about it and and\nwhat about your friend though when all\nthis was going\non wasn't my friend\nanymore he found it\nfunny either that or I just maybe I\nwasn't paying attention maybe he just\ndidn't care so much because either he\nlaughed or he just like walked away just\ndidn't care yeah sounds I will say\nthough\num um that bowling that happened in\nmiddle school I\ndid end up excuse myself to go to the\nbathroom CU I just needed to cry so I\nwent to the bathroom to\ncry um and I was in there for like 5 10\nminutes just crying and then someone\ncame in and found me and I was kind of\nlike done crying but they could tell\nanyway cuz you know like you get R and\neverything\nso they like I come back to the\nclassroom the teacher asked me what was\ngoing on and then send me to the\nprincipal to talk about it and I I did\nend up getting like apologies and the\nbullying did stop so I will say there\nwas like a good thing that happened\nthere where they they force those people\nto stop and some of those people like\none of the one of those people persons\none of those persons I guess became kind\nof like a little school friend like we\ndidn't hang out outside of school but we\ndid eventually like\nbecome friendly with each other so\nthat's pretty cool yeah there's hope in\nthe world yeah last time we experienced\nHope was Middle School\nyeah yeah no I'm I I I I I can see that\nso it sounds like the bullying was more\nsevere in middle school but also that\nyeah the resolution of it like gave you\nsome hope yeah which is an interesting\nprinciple it's not something that I've\nkind of thought about like um can I just\nthink for a second yeah\nso it kind of reminds me of of this\nreally fascinating study where so you're\nsaying that the bullying in middle\nschool is worse right you got made fun\nof for being gay even though you're not\ngay yeah um and\nthen and then it kind of ended up well\nso there's a really fascinating study so\neven though it was like more severe it\nseems like there's more resolution for\nyou than and whereas like you you're\ndropping F bombs when you're talking\nabout this one incident in high school\nyeah and and so it's there's a really\nfascinating experiment\nabout so that they had people put their\nhand in cold water okay so like very\nlike uncomfortably cold water so okay\nlike freezing water or even like well\nbelow freezing or something like that\nbasically like not damaging you're not\ngoing to get hypothermia and so in one\nsetting maybe it's like -10° I don't\nknow Celsius Fahrenheit or whatever who\nknows so in one it's like let's say it's\njust -10 and then it's A-10 for like 30\nseconds and in another\nscenario it starts off at -20 and ends\nup at\n-5 so even though it gets better over\ntime it is still objectively worse than\nthe first scenario but there's\nImprovement and what people basically\nuniformly do is they prefer the latter\nto the former so even if things are\nobjectively worse but if they got better\nthan when they started people consider\nthat to be less suffering than just\nstatic crappiness does that kind of make\nsense to you yeah very interesting yeah\nso it's interesting because I think\nabout that experiment when I hear\nexperiences like this because you're\nsaying like Middle School you just tell\nus like kind of calmly right Middle\nSchool was way worse yeah and and you\ntalk about it with less emotions so\nthere's like more I I I mean I get the\nsense there was more resolution whereas\nlike this High School thing is like this\nbetrayal bro yeah I mean I think I think\num they even wrote me like apology\nletters and even though it seems kind of\nlame I feel like it really helped like\ngetting genuine\napologies and then like yeah High School\njust nothing happened I was just bullied\nI would prefer I think I would prefer\nthat resolution over yeah just being\nbullied and having nothing happen most\nhumans do yeah and what I'm kind of\nnoticing is that not only was like the\nthe I mean the the other piece of the\npuzzle was that it sounds like these\nwere friends of your friend and your\nfriend didn't step in to stop it maybe\neven laughed along yeah so like I'm I'm\nnoticing a pattern of\nbetrayal from people posting yeah I mean\nthat's honestly that's got to hurt\nalmost as much as just being bullied for\nlike in the middle school bully cuz like\nbetrayal I mean this guy was my friend\nlike he's been to my house like we play\nvideo games messed\naround you know told like told each\nother things\nlike whatever friends do and then just\nnot having that friend anymore and him\njust stepping into be part of the\nproblem yeah so sorry I had this stupid\ncomment in my head which is why I'm\ngrinning and I'm trying to get it out of\nmy head what is it well you said like\nmessed around I was like but not gay way\nI thought about that\ntoo I know I saw I was like probably\nshouldn't have said it like that we are\nall thinking it yeah but not in a gway\nall right well mind meld bro okay\ngetting back to the issue at hand okay\nit's so inappropriate right like here we\nare talking about betrayal and and you\nknow [ __ ] feelings and um no it's\nfine it's funny uh okay so so yeah I\nmean so it sounds like there's a couple\nof really important relationships in\nyour life where you did feel hurt and\ndisappointed yeah so I mean I know this\nsounds kind of weird but like I mean is\nit natural to like not open up to people\nthen right and I'm not saying you're\nsaying it isn't unnatural but yeah so I\nmean that sounds really tough\nlike you know when you think about\nopening up to someone what do you think\nis going to\nhappen\nbetrayal betrayal of\ntrust yeah that's the biggest thing I\nmean I'm sure there's a few others but\nthat's like what I think about every\ntime I think about opening up to people\nbecause I can't trust\nthem yeah I mean that's not what are we\ngoing to do about\nthat uh honestly I really don't know\nbecause\nlike that's the thing is like I think\nabout how like I could be the problem\nsometimes but then like really I'm just\nthe culmination of the things that have\nhappened in in the past and these things\nhave pushed me to this point it's like\nit might be a problem for me to deal\nwith in life but not necessarily that\nI'm the\nproblem and I just I don't know how to\ndeal with getting away from that\nself-doubt while also moving towards\nlike healthier like relationship\npractices where I can actually trust\npeople so I'm confused about the\nself-doubt okay so so what do you doubt\nabout\nyourself well it's kind of back to like\nthe whole relationship thing like trying\nto be uh more caring like a better\nperson or something because I feel like\nI felt like I wasn't good enough like I\nwas doubting myself that I wasn't\nextending out enough well why don't why\ndo you think you don't care about other\npeople\nH not really sure to to be honest what\nhappens when you care about other\npeople they betray\nme right so I mean kind of seems like\nlogical to me it's like\ncare it just almost sucks and get [ __ ]\nbro yeah like or and I mean you said at\nthe very beginning it's like either\nyou're avoidant or you try and you get\nburned\nyeah so like it seems like it's a it's a\nlike a solid protective strategy to like\nnot care like it's not that you're\nbroken it's that like that's\ndumb yeah right does that what do you\nthink about\nthat feel like it's tough\ncuz it's like I kind of have to find a\nway to move past it without thinking\nabout how like I might be broken or\nsomething and I have to just\nfind I don't know\njust being okay with myself while\nalso trying\nto I don't know it's tough I really\ndon't know to be honest I'm trying to\nyeah I mean it sounds\nimpossible yeah I'm not saying it is\nimpossible I'm saying it sounds\nimpossible right like I I don't I mean\nit seems like the crazy thing about this\nis that I I I don't think it's like\nyou're thinking about it wrong I mean I\nthink I think it makes a lot of sense\nlike Mom called you a loser read your\n[ __ ] diary was like is this true do\nyou really feel this way do you remember\nwhat her like tone was when she asked\nyou about it yeah I feel like that's\nimportant too\num she seemed she seemed sad which is a\nnice thing cuz she should be sad like\nyeah so I think she genuinely cared if I\nfelt that way sounds like it\nyeah right and you said you're pretty\nclose to her now like it sounds like you\nlove her a\nlot I do I just feel\nlike I just don't know how to show it\nneither does she I think her from what\nI've heard her parents like my\ngrandparents\num we pretty messed\nup um do you feel comfortable sharing\nsome of that just give us a quick yeah I\ncan I can talk about that um drinking a\nlot of drinking\num they kind of it seemed like they\ndidn't really care what happened to my\nmom this is just all from my mom and I\nkind\nof I don't really see it in my grandpa\nbut I see it in my grandma she seemed\nlike to be honest like I haven't talked\nto my grandma for a long time it's been\nyears which I feel like is weird like\nmost people talk to their grandma or at\nleast their Grandma reaches out\nright my grandma doesn't Reach Out so I\nsee it I understand like my mom talking\nabout\nlike just being mistreated in general I\ndon't have specific stories but she I\nmean it's fine if you don't to share do\nyou know specific\nstories I really don't um I think the\nmost specific I can get is like my mom\njust going out and her not caring yeah\nMom just yeah so\nokay sorry I didn't mean to cut you off\nbut I it's fine so it sounds like your\nyour grandmother was like kind of\nmentally checked\nout I guess right so doesn't care her\nbeautiful grandson Jacob is turning 27\nlet's call this this sweet boy on his\nbirthday nothing like that it seems like\nthat's kind of like my whole family like\nmy grandpa doesn't really reach out\neither don't I don't I've met my dad\nbefore but I don't know him do you know\nhow to care\nabout other the thing is I feel like\nI've had to figure it out by\nmyself and that's got to be extremely\ndifficult like you should be taught that\nyou should be taught that when like\nyou're a kid right like your your\nparents would show you how to care\nbecause they care for you but when they\nwhen they don't then you don't learn\nthat you say that's got to be tough like\nyou're speaking like a\nhypothetical it is tough\nit is it's almost like I can't\ncomprehend myself being in that\nsituation but I am in that\nsituation\nweird right yeah it's almost like I'm in\nthe third person\nyeah how do you understand that I don't\nI don't okay in the third person I\nreally don't understand\nthat we're going to help you all right\ncan I think for a\nsecond of course use your Jedi Mind\nTricks on Me oh we'll need none of those\nyou're you're doing all the heavy\nlifting yourself bro I figured I\nwould okay so let's see if we can kind\nof just make sure we're on the same\npage here's Jacob\nyeah Jacob wants to be a good human\nbeing Jacob strives to be a good human\nbeing Jacob has been is inhabiting this\nbody on this planet Earth existing in\n2024 and is trying to interact with the\nother\nhumans and and you find yourself like\nlike like it's hard to care right\nlike like you sort of recognize that\nlike you should care and it's not like\nyou're a bad person you you kind of you\nknow you wish well on people like you\nwant people to be happy like you want\nthe humans to be happy but you have\ndifficulty connecting with them there's\nsome trust stuff where like you know\nlike you've been close to people before\nand even if things are like okay now\nlike that comes with a lot of\npain and it comes with a lot of\nuncertainty and like when you kind of\nit's it's interesting to really say like\nto hear you say like I would rather go\nthrough the middle school thing again\nand that makes perfect sense I mean it\nkind of makes sense right because you\ndon't want to get through you don't want\nto you never want to go through this\nwhole thing of like okay I've got a\nfriend and my friend [ __ ] left me on\nthe ground covered in ax body spray and\nlike they could have said like they\ncould have even said like you know fine\nif they laughed or whatever but when the\nteacher's like hey Jacob your fault he\ncould have said actually\nteacher you know these guys did it or I\ndid it or like Jacob like you know\nthere's a thousand things but you you\nknow kind of got betrayed there and so\nnow like first of all it sounds like you\ndon't you're scared to trust\npeople second thing is that it sounds\nlike you don't know how to care about\npeople like in in some fundamental way\nhence why you think maybe you're broken\nin some way and then there's this whole\nother thing of like today we're going to\ntalk about Jacob in the third\nperson Jacob will talk about himself in\nthe third person today right so so where\nyou sort of see your life and you use\nall these like I think pretty accurate\nphrases about your life but you kind of\ntalk about them like they're\nhypotheticals right this this would be\nvery difficult to deal with I mean you\ndidn't say that but I forgot exactly\nwhat you said but it's kind of\ninteresting so it's almost like you're\nkind of\nunplugged and then if you're unplugged\nlike I can imagine it would be hard to\nlike connect with other\npeople yeah right because you got to be\nplugged into yourself first yeah\nso and then like the last thing is then\nlike now you're faced with\nthis and it's like what where do we even\ngo how do we even start going about\nfixing this like am I busted do I need\nto fix myself do I need to like learn\nhow to talk to people like do I need to\njust go to a bunch of therapy and will\nthat fix the problem\nlike you know what do you think\nI really don't know like um I'm just\ncompletely lost\nbecause it's almost\nlike this\nsituations I try it's like I try not to\nmake them matter but they do matter and\nthen it's something that's affected me\nthroughout life even though I tried to\nlower the hurt like yeah the pain to\npush it\naway or even though I acknowledge it\nit's almost like I kind of like think of\nthem not really happening to me because\nor like not being important to me\nbecause I have all all these other\nthings that happen in life and then it\njust leads me to this point where I just\nfeel\nlike I'm the problem and I don't know\nhow to fix it I don't really know where\nto go yeah what else do you do to push\nthings away\nvideo games okay anything else lots of\nvideo games music I've made music for\nlike eight years now to push things\naway yeah how does that\nwork well when you're sitting there\nmessing around like I use FL studi so I\njust load it up I start making music and\nthen I just sit there and I don't have\nto think about the things in the outside\nworld I just sit there and all that's\nall I got is this music program and I'm\njust making beeps and boops and kick\ndrum snare drum and everything else is\npushed\naway okay that's pretty\ncool\nokay it's a distraction one than\nanything I feel\nlike do you think that some of your life\nexperience comes out in your\nmusicly I mean I have like a lot of\nstuff that I've made I mean I've been\ndoing it for eight years so hundreds of\nprojects some finished hundreds finished\nand probably thousands not finished\nthousands deleted and there's all sorts\nof stuff there's sad stuff there's angry\nstuff there's chill stuff so I feel like\nall those life experiences do kind of\ncome together in those and then they\njust get put out and I feel like that's\nkind of cathartic right like making\nsomething putting that emotion into it\nand then that emotion's kind of that\nthing it's not that it's gone but you've\nkind of put it into a thing you've built\nsomething with\nthat that sounds pretty cool\nyeah why did you start music eight years\nago wanted to I thought making beats\nwould be cool so I started doing that\nand\nthen I kind of wanted to make money with\nit and I've made like a little bit but\nnot a lot I spent way more money on it\nthan I've made but that's fine because I\nstill enjoy doing it and\num I feel like I wanted\nto one of the reasons was I wanted to be\nsomething I wanted to become\nsomething and through music I've kind of\nsucceeded in that\nbut I'm not famous or anything you\nknow so so you said you thought making\nmusic would be cool do did you think it\nwould make you cool making\nbeats I feel like it does in some sort\nof way like people people like it\nthey're like oh that's cool like you\nmake music like and sometimes people\nwant to listen to it and they say that\nlike I make good stuff and sometimes\npeople just think it's cool that I make\nmusic I don't really go any\nfurther how does that make you\nfeel feels good it's nice that\nespecially like recently like I haven't\nreally gotten a lot of support from my\nfamily\nmy brother did Listen to Like A lot of\nmy stuff but he doesn't really care\nabout it but one of the days he did\nasked me he's like how's it going like\ndo you and I was surprised I was like\nholy\n[ __ ] like someone's like asking me about\nthis I feel like that shouldn't be\nsurprising but it was and he's like I\ndon't want you to stop like you've been\ndoing it for so long and I feel like\nyou're really good and that felt really\ngood to\nhear I think we can see how good it\nfeels yeah probably like your face\ncompletely transforms when you like talk\nabout this you know ray of sunshine yeah\ndo we get to listen to your\nmusic if if somebody wants to listen to\nmy music I will gladly share if people\non the stream want to or if you want to\nyeah so at the end let's do this why\ndon't you send me\nsomething you can send me something via\nDiscord right don't don't send me a\nvirus\nbro what about a Spotify link a Spotify\nlink is great perfect okay send me a\nSpotify link and then we'll just like\nplay it at the end sure and then we have\nto we have to decide I know it's I can\nsee you're\nembarrassed um but uh I mean I have to\nbe honest I make some very goofy songs\nsometimes not goofy asn't bad but my\nsong on Spotify is about dating a it's a\nWAP song about dating a f booy nice bro\nlet's go son Let's Go\nso it's a joke song and so is the other\none on Spotify it is it though yes I'm\nnot a rap song about dating a fanboy\nokay yes there's also one about [ __ ]\nan alien so okay well there's definitely\nsomething in\nthere for maybe your therapist mhm\num but we're gon to you know we're going\nto just respect terms of service\nviolations and steer clear of that I can\nI anyway we maybe\nwe'll anyway so we we'll still listen to\nsomething I mean I guess we signed up\nfor it now so in for a penny in for a\npound or I just I just throw it a beat\nin there we could just listen to a beat\nor something you know maybe you don't\nhave to listen to it I mean I think I\nthink now we have\nto all right well we're doing it I guess\num so but but let's let's go back to you\nknow the rest of it sure yeah yeah the\nthe safe territory of talking about your\nfeelings and how everything's [ __ ]\nup yeah yeah um\nokay all right\nso I have a any questions for\nme I don't know do you always do this\nlike at the halfway point you're like is\nthis our little break thing\nsort of yeah no just I've seen plenty of\nyour streams so like I kind\nof I mean I I I I think we have enough\nto teach a couple of things like if\nthere's like and sometimes people will\nhave questions so it's it's not so much\nthat I mean it's just like now we're\nkind of going back into it right so I\nfeel like we just had an intermission\nwhere we're talking about rap songs\nabout dating p boys and so so now we're\nlike going back into it so like before\nwe resume right so let's just give you a\nsecond like if you have questions cuz\nsometimes people have questions and here\nI am asking all of them and you get to\nask them too if you have them there may\nbe more later but if you just have\nanything you know it's just giving you\nspace feel like I'm terrible asking\nquestions I feel like I'm like really\nbad at that yeah um because there's like\nthings just don't pop in my mind I feel\nlike I feel like I you should like are\nyou terrible at asking questions in this\nsituation or in general\nin general yeah I I think that it's not\nI mean it's a problem but I I think it's\nconsistent right so yeah\num so we we'll talk about that so okay\nso if if questions come up just you know\nask\nthem all right let me let me think for a\nsecond okay\nso I need to just take some notes of\nokay all\nright did you go to birthday parties\ngrowing\nup\nyeah did you have your own birthday\nparties yeah what were they\nlike the one that I that first comes to\nmind is\num we had our like we had our basement\nin our in our house and then it was\nwasn't completely finished but it was\ntouched up had drywall and stuff and\num I think it was like three of my\nclosest\nfriends I think my cousin was there and\nthen another friend was there so quite a\nbit of people were just chilling in the\nbasement my mom made food like we had\nfood we had video games it was a pretty\ngood time you had one birthday party no\nthat wasn't the only one but um that's\nthe one that I remember the most okay\nbecause it was just it was just a great\nbirthday party but you would get like\ninvited to birthday parties and stuff\nlike that would go\nand feel like not from like well yeah\nso I usually just went\nto my one friend's because I feel like\nmy other friend didn't really get\nbirthday parties his\nparents not not the best people okay\num and and how do you feel about this\nconversation I don't know it's\ninteresting just like thinking about it\nand exploring\nlike I probably didn't go to too many\nbirthday parties so it's kind of\ninteresting thinking about that yeah so\nI mean like as a whole like I I know you\nfelt a little bit usually people feel a\nlittle bit nervous kind of going into it\nlike do you feel like it's we've been\nokay so far I mean you know I know we've\ntalked about\nsome a a lot of stuff that's like kind\nof personal yeah um and I would say I've\nbeen completely nervous and anxious this\nentire time but I'm just I'm going\nthrough it so I I find this um yeah I\nfind this just interesting and fun yeah\nso I think it's okay to have both of\nthose feelings I don't feel nervous at\nall I feel like this is fantastic so so\nI I know you feel nervous and and\nthere's a power dynamic in the situation\nand stuff like that but I I think it's I\nI think you're it's been an absolute\npleasure to talk to you so I I think\nyou're quite eloquent actually so so\nthere's a big difference between thing\ndescribing confusing things\naccurately and speaking in a confused\nmanner so what so why do you why do you\nfind it f fantastic just\nbecause I'm so good at explaining things\nor like detailing it\nwhen I said I found it fantastic what\nwas your\nreaction well it's nice it feels good\nbecause it I feel like it means I'm\ndoing a good job and I just want to do a\ngood\njob right right so so you just want I\nthink you're doing a great job so I'll\ntell you why so I I think you're very\ngood at articulating so I think life is\nconfusing yeah and the problem is that a\nlot of people when they articulate the\nconfusing nature of Life they feel like\nidiots\nmhm but there's a big difference between\nbeing an idiot and having a life that\nmakes no [ __ ] sense and articulating\nit properly so I think you've actually\npainted a beautiful picture of what is\nvery common for a lot of people which is\nlike I'm stuck in this\nsituation I kind of recognize that I\ndon't know how to do it properly but I\nalso recognize that it's not really like\nmy fault right it's not like I you know\nmade some catastrophic decision many\nyears ago or continue to make I'm sure\nthere's some amount of guilt or whatever\nbut like you know I think it's it's a\nvery challenging situation to be in to\nhave a life that was in some ways given\nto you that life to be insufficient and\nnot have the tools to turn it into what\nyou want and then you're stuck with this\nbasic thing of like okay if I can't put\ntogether my life and you can acknowledge\nthat like some of this stuff was not\nlucky for you but then it gets really\nconfusing about what am I responsible\nfor because if I was dealt a bad hand\nlike in my life is [ __ ] like isn't that\njust what happens how much more can I do\nwhat should I be doing I've tried to do\nstuff and I get\nburned and so it can be like\nincredibly I I don't want to say\nparalyzing because I get the I don't get\nthe sense you're paralyzed I get the\nsense that if you had an idea of what to\ndo you would do it but the basic problem\nis you don't know like what direction to\ngo like should you make friends like how\ndo you start caring about people like I\ndon't\nknow want you want to know what I\nthought of yeah talking about that\nliterally yesterday like my one\ncooworker I was talking about that we're\nkind of friends um I was going to ask\nher if she wanted to like hang out not\nlike dating she's gay she has a\ngirlfriend she's going to like propose\nto her um but like just friends and I\nwas\nlike like nothing really happened before\nthis other than we were just kind of\nlike\nmessing around like all of us like\nco-workers just talking shooting the\n[ __ ] or whatever but like I walked up to\nher and I was like I said her name and I\nwas\nlike just going to ask her but then she\nturned and looked at me and what yes\nJacob or like something like that like\nin a frustrated tone and I was\nlike guess I was just being annoying or\nsomething that that [ __ ] hurt like\njust\nyesterday like I feel like she doesn't\nnormally do that stuff I feel like maybe\nshe was just overwhelmed\nmaybe cuz she doesn't really act like\nthat but then I felt like man I was\nbeing annoying and that's\nlike that's like that kind of like punch\nin the gut where you're really trying\nto come out and do the thing that you\nthought was the right thing to do to\nkind of move forward and\nprogress um but then it was just yeah\njust\ninstant I feel like I I could have like\ncontinued but it hurt and I just turned\naway and just went to go do my\njob\nokay I'm going to be Sil it's not I'm\nnot leaving you hanging here I'm just\nwriting a lot because I think it's very\nsignificant do you understand how other\npeople\nfeel [ __ ] no okay I've struggled with\nthat for so long in my life where like I\nthought I was like yeah I thought I\npretty much just had I don't know what\nis um what is autism like the category\nfor autism like it's a like autism\nspectrum disorder neurode yeah but it's\nalso yeah so like I'm like thinking like\nI don't know how to communicate with\npeople because I'm just there's\nsomething wrong with me like I was born\nwrong but to say not to say autistic\npeople are wrong but you know what I\nmean um just born different and I've had\nto take my entire life and and try to\nfigure out people and try to figure out\ntheir emotions and like facial\nexpressions body language tone and just\nkind of like put all that together to\ntry to figure out how people are feeling\nin the moment and really\nlike understand it I had to put it\ntogether like an alien like yep and I\nimagine we haven't even gotten to\nromantic relationships but I\nimagine romantic relationship is like\ntrying to have sex with an\nalien\nyeah sure sure\nyeah do you know anyone who makes music\nabout that by the way I I think it would\nbe really interesting to you know if\nsomeone made music about their\nexperience of you know like like\nlegitimate like musicians or just\ntrolling\ncuz no cuz I\ndo are you a legitimate\nmusician yeah definitely am wow look at\nthe balls on this guy I mean I work hard\nfor my music I've I've struggled for\neight years and I feel like I feel like\nsome of it sounds really\ngood are we GNA get listen to the good\nstuff\nor F honestly fboy friend is a banger\nI'm I'm not going to lie okay let okay\nI'm invested dude let's go all right\nFanboy what what's the name Fanboy\nfriend Fanboy like fan booy and\nboyfriend but fan booyfriend oh damn\nson that's\ngood yeah yeah okay give me a second\nlike a minute\nmhm okay\nokay if you need to use the bathroom or\nanything go for it because I'm going to\nneed a couple minutes okay that's for\nstream can go y'all can go take a\nbathroom break because I'm just trying\nto put everything together okay Jesus\nokay all right um yeah I'll be right\nback got to start\nover\nfor for\nI need like probably 90 more seconds\nokay no problem\nokay\nokay so let me ask you a couple a couple\nother questions so you said that yes uh\nyesterday you talked to your\nfriend and she seemed annoyed by you and\nyou said maybe she's\noverwhelmed yeah what should you do if a\nfriend of yours is\noverwhelmed\num I haven't really been good at like\ndoing that kind of stuff like\njust trying\nto I don't know reassure someone or like\ncalm them down like help them calm down\num tell them it's going to be okay like\nthose are kind of like the ideas that\ncome to my head and I really haven't\nbeen like good at that I feel like I'm\nstill not good at that but sometimes I\ndo\ntry how do you\ntry\num sometimes I just ask like do you need\nhelp like can I help you sometime um and\nwhat do people usually\nsay I don't know CU I feel like I don't\nask enough okay I don't really um get in\nlike into asking people if they need\nhelp I also don't ask for help a lot\nokay do you know how to ask for\nhelp I mean it's just really it's as\nsimple as just be like hey can you help\nme but like it's hard\nto take I don't know if it's like Pride\nor that whole like betrayal of trust\nthing where like I just don't ask people\nfor help because I just want to do it\nmyself I feel like I could do either I'm\njust I'll do a better job doing it\nmyself really I feel like that's kind of\nlike also the trust thing or\nlike I just don't really want people to\nget in the way or something I don't know\nso I'm going to go ahead and say\nno\nyeah I guess so yeah right simple answer\nno right so so like let's understand\nthis okay so so see when we talk about\nasking for help you're right the words\nare the easy part the hard part about\nasking for help is not in the words\nalthough even that can be difficult for\nsome people if we're not taught it's all\nthe crap that goes with asking for help\nhow do we think about ourselves what is\nthis person going to do am I burdening\nthem is it silly for me to ask for help\nit'd be better if I just did it myself\nright this is what makes asking for help\nhard it's not the you know can you\nplease help me with this it's all the\ncrap internally that goes with it that\nwe're often times not\ntaught right like people will say like\noh like if you need help you should ask\nfor it but what do I do when I ask for\nhelp and then all the kids in my class\nmake fun of me because I'm such an idiot\nlike no one tells you how to deal with\nthat right so so asking for help is\nactually one of the most deficient\nskills in our society it's\ncrazy okay so we're going to try\nsomething um I'm going\nto I have to do\nsome I'm going to pull out the iPad\ndoes that work for you okay I'm not sure\nwhat that means but you're sure yeah\nokay all right\nwell okay so I'm going to do a couple of\ndifferent things so I'm going to screen\nshare with\nyou so you can see\nthis can you see\nthat yes okay and then we have to do\nthis\nokay\nso let's talk about Jacob so I'm going\nto offer a lot of different ideas we're\ngoing to go through a lot of different\nprinciples I've been talking to you for\nabout an hour a little over an hour so\nwe have no idea if any of this stuff is\ncorrect does that make sense\nJacob um like like these are not answers\nthese are hypothesis these are things to\nthink about these are things for\npotentially you to continue to work on\nright so I understand you're doing some\npersonal work nowadays so these are just\nangles for you to consider but I think\nthere's a lot of General stuff about\nyour situation which I've seen a lot\nwhich there's a lot of data about so\nwe're going to kind of illustrate some\nof those principles does that make sense\nyeah so here's\nyou and you are\nconfused what are you confused by am I\n[Music]\nbroken I don't\nknow\nexactly how to\ncare\nbut I\ndon't not care\nright I'm kind of like\ncapable of some\nrelationships so I can do\nit but I don't\nknow how to create\nthem so it's in there right so and and\nthen\nlike I want to\nconnect but it's a bad\nidea make sense does this feel pretty\naccurate so far\nyeah and then going back to the Mi I\nbroken like I\nacknowledge bad [ __ ]\nhappened but it isn't\nreally my\nfault but I\nstill have to deal with\nit we good\nmhm would you say that these kind of\nlike resonate with you\nsome yes okay so H how how is this\npicture the picture is like pretty\naccurate not very accurate like in the\nMiddle where are we I feel like you're\npretty much on the spot okay so first\nthing is like no wonder you're confused\nbecause these things seem genuinely\nconfusing right M okay\nso now let's understand a couple of\ndifferent things going on so number one\nbetrayal of\ntrust at times in your life you've had\nrelationships and these relationships\nwere people that mattered to you and it\nand like when you're close to someone\nright like we saw your face like\nabsolutely light up when you just like\nwhen your brother was like hey how's\nyour music going spontaneous\nright they didn't have to you don't have\nto ask him You' be like hey like hey\nI've been working on music and hint hint\nnudge nudge wink wink ask me about it it\nblew my mind yeah right so blew your\nmind and like that's crazy bro because\nlike that should not be a once- in\na-lifetime occurrence no right and and\nit's sad\nso you've had a couple of things right\nwe talked about your mom and it sounds\nlike your mom is actually like a\nfantastic mom I I know where we've\ntalked about some of her negative\nexperiences but I'm not getting the\nsense that she's like a bad woman or\nanything in fact quite the opposite is\nthat fair yeah yeah yeah so I I think\nsometimes we just when we share an\nisolated example we can make people\nsound bad but like it sounds like she\nreally does care about you and and does\nwhat she knows how to do yes and then\nyou had this high school friend this\n[ __ ] let's call it the axe\nincident sure axe incident that makes it\nsound even worse right and then you\ndiscover it's the body spray and then\nyou realize it's even worse than a real\naxe oh my God realax as we can deal with\nthe [ __ ] body spray oh my God this\nstream sponsored by Axe Body Spray that\nlike I was in World War I but it's like\nmustard\ngas all\nright I'm sure there's a fanboy joke\nsomewhere in there but I can't quite\nconnect the dots Fanboys don't wear Axe\nBody Spray that's what it is I knew it\nwas there somewhere thanks a l fan boys\nare not sponsored by a yeah okay um\nokay\nso all right so so there's a betrayal of\ntrust right and then what happens is\nlike there's almost a\nresponsive\ncallus that forms right so uh\nmaybe I don't know if I spelled that\nright but when we kind of think about so\nso it's a kind of like you try to avoid\nthinking about things you try to avoid\ncaring right right because you have to\navoid caring because you don't want to\nget hurt and when you trust people like\nsometimes you get\nhurt and so since you avoid caring it\nkind of gets hard to care and we talked\na lot about like you don't know how to\ncare right like you care about some\npeople but it's like hard for you to\nreally like understand and care and and\nstuff like that I I mean I'm making it\nsound make it sound like you're just so\nso awful at this Stu it's true it just\nit no that's what I done my like my\nwhole life is like avoid caring yeah\navoid caring right because caring hurts\nso like we're just going to stop doing\nthat so then of course like you're going\nto have difficulty with\nrelationships so let's talk a little bit\nmore about avoidance of caring so not\nonly is this going on where you like\navoid caring right you actively avoid it\nbut or actually let's call\nthis difficulty of caring\nokay and you kind of say that you should\ncare but you're not quite sure how and\nthen like then we get to a couple of\ninteresting\nthings\nso a weird question for you Jacob how\ndoes one learn how to\ncare feel like that's shown to you\nthat's provided in examples when you're\ngrowing up\nand were you shown that\nno no nope right so you have difficulty\ncaring so one piece is you're avoiding\nit second piece is you just weren't\ntaught right so it sounds like your\ngrandmother was like completely AFK with\nyour\nmom and then your mom like learned a lot\nand has kind of done the best that she\ncan but also like you can't fix that I I\ndon't know if your mom we were not going\nto talk about whether your mom has been\nin therapy and stuff but you usually if\nyou want to fix that in one generation\nit takes like a fair amount of therapy\nto like really do that mhm um and so\nthis actually practically translates\ninto a lack of\nskills like emotional skills\ncommunication skills communication and\nemotional skills so we'll get to both of\nthose but so so one thing that we talked\nabout is like don't know how to ask for\nhelp yes\nbut let's understand this this example\nyou gave about yesterday is perfect\nright\nso how did you feel when your friend was\nSnappy with\nyou I felt hurt but a little bit\nunderstanding cuz I feel like maybe it\nwas just the wrong time to ask very good\nokay so when you say it's the wrong time\nto ask why would you think that because\nshe seemed frustrated or overwhelmed she\nseemed\noverwhelmed and when a friend of yours\nis\noverwhelmed what should you\ndo help him\nout do you know how to do that no right\nso this is exact this is a lack of\ncaring right so it's not that you don't\ncare it's that you don't know how to\ncare so this is a case a prime example\nof like your friend is having a tough\nday you recognize she's having a tough\nday\ncould you be autistic maybe who the hell\nknows but you're you're aware enough and\nempathic enough to have a probably\npretty good hypothesis that this is out\nof character for her there must be\nsomething kind of going on with\nher and you you sort of recognize but\nyou just don't know what to\ndo right so don't\nknow how to\ncare and when we talk about like you\nknow your your friendship so so it\nsounds like you sometimes put in effort\nto make friends and that doesn't really\nwork out very well we sort of talked\nabout that at the very beginning do you\nremember\nthat yeah yeah so can you tell me a\nlittle bit about like what like any\nexamples come to\nmind sorry my my mind is a little um it\nthinks a lot of different things what\nwas\ndon't worry about it it's actually not\nthat important you following\nalong yeah yeah okay if you're not you\nknow let me know you can ask for\nclarifications because just because\nyou're following not following along\ndoesn't mean that it's a problem on your\nend maybe what I'm writing makes no\n[ __ ]\nsense I feel like it does my brain just\nkind of goes a lot of different\ndirections sometimes okay so next thing\nthat we're going to talk a little bit\nabout is this weird Jacob\ntalks about\nhimself in the third person that's the\nmost confusing one bro that's\nso I even know right you don't actually\ntalk about yourself in the third person\nbut you describe your experiences as\nhypotheticals as like externalized\nthings right so this has just a little\njust a little whiff you got a touch of\nthe dissociation bro I'm not diagnosing\nyou with anything but this is very\ncommon for people who have difficulty\nconnecting with themselves right so if\nwe if we look at lot of difficulty with\nthat a lot of difficulty with what\nconnecting with\nmyself yeah right so what is that when\nyou say you have difficulty connecting\nwith yourself what is your experience of\nthat which I recognize the IR question\nunderstanding not understanding what I'm\nfeeling or like how I'm feeling okay\nlike trying to like reach in and just\nkind of like like I'm just blind like\nI'm just grasping for something\nsomething okay let me see if I can turn\nup your volume somehow am I am I quiet\ncuz I can turn myself up yeah turn\nyourself up bro it wasn't quite before\nthat better oh my God silky smooth baby\ntoo much better okay all right no no no\nthat's great okay all right yeah it's\nlike it's like reaching in and trying to\nlike find something but I just can't\nyeah so so so this is this is like\nreally common\nso so connection with the self okay so\nyou know I I I know you have access to\ntreatment and whatnot so this is like a\nbetter conversation for you to have more\nprivately or like there's there's a\nversion of this that's important to have\nprivately we're not going to assess\ntoday whether you're dissociating or\ndepersonalizing or anything like that\nthe main thing to understand is that\nthere's a spectrum so on the Spectrum we\nhave at one end of the spectrum clinical\ndissociation and at the other end of the\nspectrum a connection like a very very\nlike positive authentic connection with\nthe self where you know who you are and\nall this kind of\nstuff so if we understand like why does\nthis happen there are a couple of\nreasons the biggest thing is avoidance\nof\nemotion so if we look at how our\nidentity forms okay our identity comes\nfrom a series of let me actually do this\nso I'm going to stop screen sharing this\nwith you just so I can see your\nface we going go back to\nthis and then we're going to\ndo can you see my face I mean we can\nleave this on\nbut okay I see okay\nso here's how our sense of identity for\nhere's how we know who we are so our\nsense of self develops from the\nintegration of emotional experiences so\nif we like look at like we know who you\nare like do you get this like I know\nit's kind of crazy we know you at this\npoint we we know you that's why we like\nyou yeah because we figured you out H\nhow do we know who you\nare what because I exist and we talk\nabout my experiences and you see them\nobjectively from the outside no no no\nit's not we see them objectively from\nthe outside it's the opposite we see\nthem subjectively from the inside that's\nhow we know who you are we got to know\nyou because you had this experience with\nyour mom because like this like the Axe\nBody Spray and then the fan boyfriend\nmoments that teach us who you are it's\nthe moments where it doesn't matter\nwhether it's good or it's bad like you\nknow like even the stuff about like\ntelling us that you play you know rocket\nLeague or whatever right and like the\nthe problems like it's not the fact that\nyou play CS:GO it's I don't play [ __ ]\nCSO anymore because [ __ ] full of\ncheaters that's when we get to know you\nright and right now you're smiling it's\nwhen you smile like these are these are\nthe moments of your your life so if you\nif I if you were to ask me who is Jacob\nI'd say Jacob is a guy who like was not\ndealt the best hand in life he's doing\nthe best that he can and he struggles\nwith a lot of things but he's a really\nsolid dude he loves making music he like\nhas a lot to give the poor guy has all\nthis stuff to give but it can't cross\nthe bridge between in here and out there\nand he really wants to be like more\nconnected with people he doesn't want to\nbe like isolated and stuff like that but\nthis poor guy doesn't know\nand so he comes up with these [ __ ]\nsongs because that's the only way and he\nmakes this music and when he makes this\nmusic he connects with someone else he\ndoesn't he doesn't receive it but he\ncertainly sends it out there and and\nsomeone's listening to that music and\nthey're really getting it like they're\nlike yeah like this is a person that\nbrings value to the world like I love\nthis right the music doesn't even have\nto be the best and this is who Jacob is\nhow does that sound\nsounds pretty\ngood does it when you say sounds pretty\ngood I mean like I agree it sounds good\nwhat what do you think you know is that\naccurate is that who you\nare I'd say yeah that's I mean obviously\nthere's going to be more to it like we\ndon't have eight hours to get into my\nentire life but I'd say from what you've\nheard I would say yeah that wraps it up\nright so how do you feel about that\nperson I feel\nconflicted tell\nme like all I ever\ndo is try but then it doesn't feel like\nenough so I just try harder and it's not\nenough and I try harder and it's not\nenough and it just burns and\nhurts and then I want I don't want to be\nstuck in my room sitting\nhere making songs about fboys all the\ntime as fun as that is I want to also be\nout there with people and connect with\nthem and enjoy people and not just be\nlonely but I\ncan't right so so and and that that's\nbeautiful too like that's part of who\nyou are you're someone who struggles\nyeah you don't you don't want to be like\nthis anymore like you're okay with a\npiece of it but like not this much right\nyou want more of a full life right and I\nthink we all see that like that's gen we\nI see someone who's striving and\nresilient and just got [ __ ] burnt too\nmuch and now doesn't know what to do so\nyou're kind of exhausted right\nso if if we kind of like look at this\nhow do we understand who you are it is\nthrough a string of emotional\nexperiences so when we integrate\nemotional experiences into our sense of\nself that's where our sense of self\ncomes from so if you really look at one\nof the consequences of traumatic events\nokay so this is we're talking about just\nthe general literature on on trauma so\npeople who go through trauma lose their\nsense of identity and the literal\nneuroscientific mechanism of that is\nemotional avoidance numbing out of our\nemotional brain and then what happens is\nour life becomes lifeless it loses all\nof its color and then you just start\nkind of like existing dayto day like you\nhave challenges like if I have a\nlifeless kind of colorless comic of\nsomeone's life I can portray that this\nperson has difficulties and we can all\nobjectively say like oh yeah like this\nperson has\ndifficulties this person is having a\ndifficulty today a difficulty today\ndifficulty tomorrow but there's no color\nto it so literally what we know about\nsort of helping people through trauma\ntreatment and and developing a\ndevelopment of an identity is it\nrequires emotional integration of\nexperiences so now we run into a couple\nof other problems okay so we're going to\ngo back to this for a\nsecond screen share with you okay does\nthat make\nsense\num yeah for the most part yeah okay I'm\nstruggling a little bit with it but what\nare you I got\nthe uh just like the last part you said\nit kind of it didn't really connect in\nmy mind about the the development of\nidentity yeah okay so so when I tell a\nstory about my\nidentity my identity is not developed by\nwhat I ate for breakfast today and what\nI ate for breakfast 10 years ago and\nwhat I ate for breakfast 20 years ago\ndoes that make sense yeah that's not who\nI am so when when we're synthesizing a\nsense of our identity so like are there\nany like do you watch anime or like\nmovies or like is there any character\nthat you\nlike um I know it's kind of a [ __ ]\nrandom question do you want to know I\nfeel like this is kind of edgy it's like\num it's almost kind of edgy but not\nreally maybe that\nway do you know you know the show Burn\nNotice no oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it\nwas on like\nright yeah yeah I I love Michael Wesson\nhe's just a badass bro he just [ __ ]\nkicks ass and [ __ ] shoots people and\ntakes down multiple government\nconspiracies and I feel like we could\nall strive to be that okay so so it's\nnot edgy it's cringe it's a little yeah\nit's a little cringe I feel like okay\nbut but it's a pretty good show so so\nbut when we think about like who is that\nperson what are the moments that define\nMichael Weston for you\nwell the reason why I was like thinking\nabout it like how it was like edgy but\nwe came to the conclusion that it wasn't\num that was cringe just because he's\nvery disconnected and cut off uh\nemotionally and I feel like I really\nrelate to that okay right so so even\nthen so I know it sounds kind of crazy\nso it's fine that you relate to him but\nthere are going to be mo emotionally\nimpactful moments in the show where he\nis\ndisconnected yeah does that make sense\nso that's actually a really emotional\nmoment in the the show it's like oh this\npoor guy is so disconnected so if we\nlook at our lives literally our sense of\nidentity is made up of emotional\nMilestones that first time like so your\nyour life is made up by emotional\nMilestones right it's like this time\nwhen your mom read your diary or your\nmom read your journal or whatever found\nthis book this moment where with the Axe\nBody Spray and it's so vivid there's so\nmuch emotional energy these are the\nmoments that define us this moment where\nyour brother reached out to you and was\nlike hey you should keep making me these\nare emotionally charged moments those\nthat's how we get to know you so anytime\nwe avoid our emotion we stop developing\nour identity we become trapped where we\nare because all you have is those\nemotional experiences does that make\nsense yeah and so if we think about like\nyou know your emotional moments going\nforward like that's what you want right\nlike you want more of these like\nemotional moments and I think you're\nactually okay with the highs and lows\nlike even even being bullied for being\ngay like that's okay as long as there's\nemotional resolution at the end so\nthat's what's really interesting about\nlife is that as long as we're kind of\nlike we get our emotions taken care of\nin some way we're actually okay with\nnegative things happening to us yeah\nokay so the avoidance of emotion leads\nto oh\ncrap leads to disconnection of the self\nokay\nMH\nand this is where that weird\nhypothetical stuff comes from but let's\nnot worry about so much about\nthat the last thing that this actually\ndoes is this makes empathy very\ndifficult okay and now like now we're\ngoing to get to something that's kind of\nweird okay so just bear with me so\nhere's\nyou and when you're dealing with the\naliens those are antennas\nokay yes and like when you don't so\nempathy what's your what's your\nunderstanding of what empathy\nis um being able\nto well there sympathy and empathy and I\nkind of confuse the to I think empathy\nis where I think empathy is the one\nwhere you\nare able to feel the emotions\nbecause that's just some something\nsomebody's going through and you can\ntell that they're going through\nsomething what is sympathy sympathy is\nwhere you sympathize because you feel\nthe same thing like you felt the same\nthing right okay so uh uh yes and no so\nso let's understand this so empathy is\nbeing able to connect your emotions to\nsomeone else's emotions you'll actually\nfeel the same thing I'm an empath an\nempath means that we are connected\nthere's an umbilical chord so if someone\nelse is feeling sad I'm feeling sad I\nthink you're actually better at sympathy\nthan you are at empathy cuz I asked you\nlike do you know what like you know I\nasked you some question you like [ __ ] no\nI have no idea what someone else is\nactually like feeling like you know so\nthe alien is is capable of sympathy the\nalien is like when we look at like a\n[ __ ] rhino in a zoo We can look at\nthis rhino and we can say man this is so\nsad like poor Rhino but we have no idea\nlike if the Rhino is happy or sad we\nhave no [ __ ] idea what the Rhino is\nfeeling like we can't tell so we can\nhave sympathy for animals in a zoo but\nwe can have empathy for like I have\nempathy for you because I know what it's\nlike to be bullied in high school for or\nmiddle school for being gay like big\npart of my experience you went through\nthe same thing I don't know if I went\nthrough the same thing but I certainly\nwas bullied a lot and generally speaking\none of the mechanisms of bullying was an\nattribution towards homosexuality when I\nwas growing up yeah I've witness it for\nother people too so I mean it's like\nvery common right it's it's like one of\nthe most devastating insults and there's\nall kinds of problem in our society\nbecause of that so so so this is where\nand and now we get to a big big big big\nbig problem so if your friend is feeling\nsad or frustrated you can intellectually\ncuz you're a smart guy you can\nunderstand that and you can actually\nfeel\nsympathy\nbut this is what's kind of weird so so\nright now in empathy what happens is\nthere's sadness over here and the\nsadness comes into you in some way and\nso we're both feeling sad together\nnumber one this is how bonds\nform shared emotional experiences is how\nbonds form right so when I'm playing a\ngame of like let's say CSG go and my\nteam is down and it's like 2v5 and we\nboth have knives left and that's all\nwe've got and we somehow win and we make\na comeback this is the person you add to\nyour friends list because y'all did it\nyou had a shared emotional experience\nthat's what binds people together this\nis why falling in love is such a\nbeautiful thing provided both people are\ndoing it right because now we have this\nshared emotional experience of this is\nwhat Romeo and Juliet is about both of\nthem are like I'm in love with you and\nthis is a terrible [ __ ] idea so they\nshare that together and that's how a\nbond forms now when people struggle with\nempathy so because of this disconnection\nthis avoidance of emotion you have\ndifficulty connecting with other people\nnow this creates a huge\nproblem so when you don't have EMP aathy\nthis results in self blame so when you\nhave nothing over here like you're not\ncapable of kind of like telling what is\ngoing on inside another person then this\nbecomes a vacuum and then all of the\nblame ends up over here does that kind\nof make sense it's like when I'm\nempathic I know what's over there and\nwhat's over here because I can feel\nwhat's over there mhm and I can feel\nwhat's over here so if you look at\npeople who are like highly sensitive\npersons or empaths or people who have\nemotional umbilical cords their problem\nis that they're so empty over here that\nwhatever is over\nhere like goes in here and fills this up\nit's like a oneway street okay do you\nunderstand that sounds sounds terrible\nit's terrible yours is equally bad don't\nworry bro so in your case what's going\non is you have nothing over here you\ncan't detect everything so all of the\nnegativity which on sub subconscious\nlevel your brain is still detecting all\nfills this up so when your friend is\nhaving a bad day whose fault is\nit who do you blame for your\ninteraction I mean it would have to be\nme because I wouldn't understand right\nright but do you see not it wouldn't\nhave do you remember when you said oh\nmaybe I said something wrong and maybe I\nscrewed up and maybe I'll try again\nlater like this is where remember we\nwere talking about the self- referential\nstuff at the very beginning of our talk\ntogether\nyeah so when your friend is having a bad\nday you're like maybe I said I did I\nsaid something wrong MH even though on\nan intellectual level you understand\nthat you didn't say anything wrong\nyou're like maybe I [ __ ] up so I'm not\ngoing to say anything else and now this\nis the problem is like so so when you we\nwhen we have empathy we kind of like we\nhold ourselves\nresponsible for everyone else around us\nand it and we we will also be very\nhypervigilant to like any sign of\nnegativity because we can't I don't know\nif this kind of makes any sense you\ncan't put any of the negativity over\nthere because you can't feel the\nnegativity over there so the only place\nfor the negativity to go is in\nyou does that make sense at all I feel\nlike it's it's it's a it's a little\nconfusing but I'm kind of I'm getting it\nare you you're saying I'm sympathetic or\nempathetic I think you're sympathetic so\nI think you can intellectually\nunderstand like like like the or Rhino\nis in in a zoo like you can understand\nthat your friend is like having a bad\nday yeah but I I don't think you you can\nfeel the negativity over like I mean you\ndetect it in some way but you don't\nattribute it to her you're not like this\nis a problem on her end that she is\nhaving a bad day I remember you talking\nabout something kind of like this where\nlike you use your thoughts to feel\nrather than like your actual emotions I\ndon't remember what video it was but\nabsolutely absolutely right so so this\nis where you're spot on so let me just\ngo back to this okay MH so so I I don't\nknow if this kind of makes sense but\nlike if we kind of look at what the\nsituation is like when she is having a\nbad day and you try to talk to her your\ninterpretation is I should shut the hell\nup you don't think about asking further\nyou don't think about other kind of\nstuff because you're not able to detect\nthat that like problem is over there and\ninstead it turns into self-blame does\nthat kind of make sense so yeah so but\nthe only reason they're self blame is\nbecause you're not aware of like that\nother person out there I don't know if\nthat that makes sense but you can't feel\nthat other person it's so hard to\ndescribe because maybe I'm just doing a\nbad job of it but I mean I get it I\nunderstand yeah okay so this is\nwhere so this is where one of the all\nthis stuff I think I I first of all I\nthink you can you can get basically what\nlike everything that you want Jacob\nfirst thing okay okay I I think you can\nmake friends I think you can find love I\nthink it's like all fixable I think it's\nall doable and I think there's like a a\nseries of things that need to happen the\nfirst is that you need to connect with\nyourself so what that means is no longer\navoiding your emotions so I know that\nthat's difficult and I know you're\nworking on that and you've been working\non it for a little while so that's great\num so that has to happen and once you\nare because as long as you're numbing\nyourself other people aren't going to be\nable to connect with you either like\nwhen we hear that's kind of like the\nwhole that's kind of like the whole\npoint is like kind of pushing people\naway because of like betrayal of trust\nor whatever you know like just not\nwanting to get hurt well well yeah so I\nthink that's a separate thing so the\nfear that someone will betray you is\nseparate from them not being able to\nconnect with you so I would venture that\nyou know if we think about making music\nlike that's cool like and you're a cool\nguy who makes music but if you didn't\nmake music what would you\nbe what would people say about\nyou if I was just the same damn guy\nwithout the music I feel\nlike I\nmean I I'm learning German too so that's\nkind of like another thing I guess do\nyou want to take that away too if I'm\nthe guy that doesn't learn German\nabsolutely\nsmart\nyeah right so so so so this is that's\nthe thing is like you what you're doing\nis you're putting like medals on your\nchest to like show people that you're\nsomeone I think there's a lot of\ngenuiness to the the music I'm not\nsaying there isn't but what I'm saying\nis that there's like a fundamental uness\nthat I don't know that people\nsee right like like people like he's\njust kind of there because I don't show\nit yeah I don't yeah right yeah it's\nit's not even about betrayal we're not\neven telling you that you need to trust\nanyone what I'm saying is that like the\nperson that you are you're so avoidant\nfor your own emotions that you they\ndon't come out you're feel like people\nalmost don't really deserve it ah now we\nget something good\nI feel like they don't Des [ __ ] deserve\nit you're right tell me about that bro\nnow we get to the\nanger just [ __ ] them bro like why do\nthey deserve\nit they didn't earn\nit tell me\nmore I don't even know how to explain\nit it's like\nput I don't know why they don't deserve\nit they just don't like I don't want to\ngive people that I I want it for myself\nso that I can be happier like some for\nsome reason I think that it makes me\nhappier that I get to keep my piece of\nmyself and that other people can't take\nit yeah so now we get to this is\nsomething and it hurts it hurts a lot\nyeah [ __ ]\nhim yeah\nI don't want to cry on stream I don't\nwant to cry on stream just think\nFanboys\nthink Fanboy Axe Body Spray new product\nright so here we are again running away\nrunning away running away yeah well I\nmean maybe I'll think about it later but\nlike I don't I want to sit here and\nthink about it cuz if I do bro I'm going\nto start crying and I want to cry in\nfront of thousands of people okay fair\nenough so then we're we're going to help\nyou not do that right but like there's\nanger there\nlike I you I mean something that might\nhelp you understand me a bit more I was\na very very angry kid I was always angry\nalways um I would throw [ __ ] I would\ncall my mom a [ __ ] uh till she watched\nmy mouth out was soap then I didn't do\nthat anymore cuz I'll tell you soap\ndoesn't taste good especially when it's\nlike solid soap and it gets stuck in\nyour teeth and then oh not good but um\nidentity you see yeah yeah identity\neventually I grew out of the anger but I\nstill had it like I play video games I'd\nbe very competitive in like CSO and\nstuff and I'd get pissed off at that but\nI've really pushed myself away from\nanger and I I really only get angry when\nI'm like at work and something's really\nfrustrating I get angry um but I still\nI'm trying to just not let anger control\nme and it's hard when it's also linked\nto man [ __ ] them\nwhy [ __ ]\nthem because they don't get it I feel\nlike they don't get it and I don't I\ndon't want people\nto come in and tell me what's what\nand try to push their point of view on\nme\nand or like change who I am I guess I\ndon't that doesn't really make sense but\nthat's kind of like what popped in my\nhead I'll tell you what I see this\nempathy is telling me because they\nweren't [ __ ] there for me when I\nneeded it they weren't [ __ ] there\nexactly so why the [ __ ] do they get me\nnow like you know\nlike [ __ ] this empathy and being\ncompassionate and caring about other\npeople like why why why why how is this\nFair [ __ ]\nthem that's what my empathy is telling\nme I have no idea if that's true or not\nbut that's what I feel no that sound\nsounds right to me sounds exactly\nlike that's the whole point of like they\ndon't get it is because they weren't\nthere and they just maybe they\nunderstand on some other level but they\nweren't there for understand\nyeah and they just I didn't get the help\nthat I needed so why do I put myself out\nthere we ask do you know how to care\nmaybe you do but you don't want to it's\nweird right cuz we've been asking like\nwhy don't why don't you care this and\nthen think you're a bad\nperson\nyeah does this make you a bad\nperson I don't think so I\nmean why not maybe I've maybe I've been\nan [ __ ]\nsometimes Maybe if but everybody does\neverybody comes along and does one or\ntwo things at least at least you know\ncouple [ __ ] like\nthings but like where a\nespecially the [ __ ] what is it the\nchocolate kind I think it was like the\nchocolate there's a chocolate it's like\nchocolate something it's terrible\nbut\num\nyeah so this is why things are\nconfusing Jacob because it's not it's\nnot that they're confusing it's that\nyou're not willing to look at some\npieces to care or not to care you're\nresentful you're angry\nright and and that's not it doesn't\nDefine you the the only reason that it\nfeels this like I know I don't know if\nit's going to make any [ __ ] sense\nbut so\nlike you know all like I get the sense\nthat you're you're\nhesitant right you can't move forward\nyou can't like say what needs to be said\nyou can't do what needs to be done and\nthat's because there's like there's one\nit's like one of your legs is like stuck\nback there and you don't realize that\nyou have it so there's like like stuck\nin like cement or something yeah right\nand then you're trying to move forward\nbut that leg doesn't want to move\nforward this is where we have to be very\ncareful because it's not just that\nyou're incapable it's that you're\nunwilling you're\nangry and now this is the crazy you've\ngot to figure that out man like it's not\nmy place to say that you're good or bad\nI don't think you're good or bad you\nhave to decide what the right thing is\nright and I think the right answer is\ngoing to be that you work through that\nanger in some way but now we get to\nanother thing which is I think you need\nto talk to your\nmom and and really like and it's not\nthat you have to have some like you know\ncome to Jesus conversation but I I think\nyou should really spend some time like\ntalking to your mom about what it was\nlike growing up with with her your her\ngrandmother I mean sorry your\ngrandmother you know even asking her\nlike hey do you remember when you found\nthat stuff that that I said I was\nsuicidal maybe she won't remember maybe\nshe'll be emotionally avoidant how did\nyou understand that what did you think\nwas going on like I think like this\nstuff is still alive within\nyou and that's so hard to bring up\nthough it is what makes it impossible\nyep fear of\nwhat bad results like the same thing\nkind of like in me I guess like anger\nresent or like the avoidance that I do\nlike you said like maybe she would be\navoidant and just not getting the proper\nresponse I guess\nlike healthy response so I I don't know\nthat I don't know that this actually\nneeds to be done but I think there's all\nkinds of challenges it with as well\nbecause you also have to be careful\nbecause it seems like you interpret\nambiguous social stuff because when you\ndon't have empathy you can be very\nsensitive to even like neutral\nresponses right so anything less than\nperfect may be like interpreted really\npoorly so I think this maybe not yet\nmaybe you do something like family\ntherapy or something like that if that's\nan option for you but like I get the\nsense that there's just I mean there's a\nlot of stuff in there dude like you're\nangry\ndude but I don't even show it yeah of\ncourse like not usually and and because\nyou're scared of it and you've learned\nhow to stick it in the\nbasement right like a lot of a lot of\ninternalization right it's really bad\nI've I've internalized a lot and I feel\nlike I've done it I've done it so hard\nat sometimes to the point where like it\nstinks mhm on the inside\nyeah that's the worst I never recommend\nthat for\nanyone that really really hurts I'm\nconflicted because on the one hand you\nsaid you didn't want to cry and it's\nclear you're right on the edge and on\nthe other hand it sounds like you're\nsaying something that is really\nimportant so I don't know if I should\nask more or if we should talk about nerd\nrage and letting it out on the internet\ngo ahead and go ahead and ask more cuz\nlike I want I want people to know this\nmaybe somebody's going through the same\nthing and [ __ ] maybe they're sitting\nhere about to cry so tell me about the\nsting tell me about how it hurts you to\nbe the way you\nare cuz I just want to be let\nout like I feel like I'm caging myself\nin and I feel like some of it's the\nother people outside and they're caging\nme\nin and\nit just pushes all down to this like one\nlittle point this needle that just stabs\nyou right in the\nsoul cuz like it goes\nagainst\nme but it\nalso it's like I'm going against myself\nI'm fighting myself but it's like the\npeople that I want to\ntrust or care about are also fighting\nme they kind of like go hand in hand\nand it\njust it burns man it burns on the inside\nand then I just ignore\nit I ignore it cuz I don't know how to\ndeal with\nit how does it feel to say\nthat I feel a little better it feels\nlike I've\nacknowledged and I feel like\nacknowledging is helping a little bit\nthat way I can probably sit there and\nthink about it a little bit more and\nkind of come to terms so if you\ndidn't beautiful articulate right like\nturning it into a needle just just\nyou're compressing it as much as you can\nit's like a [ __ ] like you know space\nlike you know about space like stars and\n[ __ ] like a [ __ ] neutron star you\nknow yeah yeah very small it's like a or\nlike yeah black hole it just everything\njust gets put in that one point and it\njust stabs you right in the heart\ndensity though very very it's very very\nintense\nstabbing yeah you've taken something\nthat used to be across your whole soul\nand you've crammed it down into a very\ndense little thing now here's the\nquestion CU you said that they hurt you\ntoo right you take their hurt and you\ntake something that you're going to put\non the outside world and you put it in\ninto you what would it look like if you\npointed it where it should be that's the\nthing is like I some some of it should\nbe in other places but I don't want to\nlet I don't want to let the anger the\nfrustration or the pain out and hurt\nsomeone else I'd rather hurt myself than\ndo\nthat yeah I think maybe some people\ndeserve it but I'm not going to let it\nall out on one\nperson so I I think there's a a a very\ntricky balance here I think it's got to\ncome out but it doesn't have to hurt and\nthis is where it's it's an issue of of\nknowing how right so it's got to come\nout dude so this is like I mean Freud\nnoticed this when he was around I don't\nknow like around\n1900 where he noticed that anger turned\nagainst the self is the source of\ndepression when people stop getting\nangry at the outside world they become\ndepressed and so I I think that that\nanger is there like the resentment is\nthere the unfairness the unfairness\nJacob the unfairness of your life\nI wouldn't call it unfair\neither why not I'm I'm not going to sit\nthere\nand call it unfair and kind of absolve\nmyself\nof\nresponsibility maybe I'm not responsible\nfor all of it but I'm going to try my\n[ __ ] hardest but you're going to take\nresponsibility for all of it I guess\nyeah right I'm not saying you shouldn't\ntry your\nhardest right and we're not saying I\nmean so nowhere in this conversation\nhave we heard a single mention of a\ndad right we don't need to get into it\nnow but I think it's a conspicuous\nabsence yeah and so like I mean I'm I'm\nI'm and this is that that too is like\nwhen you say I'm not going to that's\nanger [ __ ] it I\nrefuse I'll I accept all of the\nresponsibility why because if you have\nresponsibility you have the power to\nchange things you're not surrendering\nI'm not gonna I'm not going to\nsurrender feel it's a kind of like a\ngood kind of anger though yeah it\ncertainly can be yeah right so except\nwhen you turn it all against\nyourself and I think the biggest problem\nis that that see here's the problem so\nlet's say let's say you and I queue up\nfor a match of Rocket league and let's\nsay that sounds awesome that does sound\nawesome just wait we're not done with\nour hypothetical remember the context of\nthe\nconversation okay it's not gonna be\nawesome right and so let's say that I\n[ __ ] suck at Rocket League because\nI've literally never played the game and\nI don't know if you like 2v2 is there a\n2v2 2v2 3v3 okay so let's say we go 2v2\nright and and then we lose because I\nsuck and then you go on blaming yourself\nyou're like I'm such a piece of [ __ ] I'm\nso bad at Rocket League and there's no\nquestion that you can improve to the\npoint that potentially you could carry\nmy [ __ ] ass to\nVictory but the problem is that the\nmoment that you start accepting\nresponsibility for what is my fault it\nfundamentally becomes\nunfixable so if I go on saying you're a\npiece of [ __ ] that's why we're losing\nand then you go on saying I'm a piece of\n[ __ ] that's why we're losing if you\naccept all of the responsibility we will\nnever be world\nchampions responsibility must be\nattributed to who truly owns it and you\naccepting it for other people doesn't\nactually fix\nanything may make you feel good may let\nyou protect other people oh Mom I was\njust\nventing you may be able to do all kinds\nof stuff but if they are actually at\nfault and you accept responsibility for\nit those patterns will\ncontinue you know what really\nsucks the idea of a 10-year-old trying\nto\ntake responsibility from his\nmom there's the third\nperson can't say it can\nyou the fact that I as a 10-year-old\nwould take responsibility from my\nmom it's called\nparentification when the child becomes\nthe parent\ndidn't even know I had a name oh yeah\n[ __ ] people up real good\nyeah and once again we're not saying\nyour mom is a bad person because these\nthings happen so I think the real irony\nhere is that you're probably quite\nempathic you're probably quite gifted at\nthis CU they I don't know if your\nbrother was like\nthis you know if his experiences were\nsimilar but usually no I have to talk to\nhim about it yeah so I I I think that\njust and this is where you don't have to\nblame so this is the really tricky thing\nthere's there's also like a a certain\njust knowhow right so and we can talk\nabout that I was going to but then we\nwent here right how you holding up by\nthe\nway dude I'm doing good uh there might\nbe some tears coming out of my eyes but\nit's fine yeah I think it's fine we'll I\nI'll I'll keep the jokes coming okay so\nwe're we're not going to go so deep all\nright we'll stay near the surface so we\ncan come up for air right but but I I I\nthink it's it's not it's so so it's good\nthat you recognize I don't know I mean\ndo you did you know how angry you were\nbecause you didn't mention it all when\nyou we were talking about\nit Angry how angry I was when what like\neven\ntoday there's no there's no\nquantity there's\njust\nunexplainable I have like just a all of\nemotions yeah it's all tangled up right\nand all kinds of stuff yeah so so that\nthat's like when we avoid and stuff\nthat's what happens right so it all gets\nlike it's like we have a bunch of junk\nmail and we just shove it into the\ncloset and we don't know what's good we\ndon't know what's bad we don't know\nwhat's you know and so all that stuff\nhas to come out\ndude and like CU like this is the thing\nhow can you know who you are when you\ntake all these pieces of yourself and\nyou like shove them in the closet how\ncan other people know who you are\nwith the closet door locked\nabsolutely yeah it's\nlike it's like you can't really put\nyourself\ntogether you can't it's impossible\nbecause you're taking pieces and you're\nWalling them off right so that so then\nthen this leads to a lot of confusion\nwhat's wrong with me it's like you're\nseeing everyone else walking and your\nfoot is stuck in cement you're like why\ncan't I walk but you're blind to\nthat and so then you come up with all\nthese different kinds of conclusions\nabout yourself which in are in and of\nthemselves even more damaging can be we\ndon't know in your case but right so\nthis is what I tend to see I I I tend to\nsee that the see in life when it's the\ncompensations that we make for\nunresolved problems that really [ __ ] us\nit's not the problem itself it's all the\nL that we go to to avoid the\nproblem\nyeah cuz I mean on some level I guess\nproblems can be solved not every problem\nbut a lot but then when you avoid\nit right because it gets harder and\nharder to avoid the more stuff builds up\nyeah and then you're doing all these\nlike further bends and twists and you're\nbuilding all this rickety\nshielding yeah around this core and then\nyou have all these kinds of like\nproblems with relationships and stuff\nlike\nthat and I I I I think it's not going to\nbe as bad as you envision it is my sense\nI mean there's going to be a lot of\nemotion but I I don't think you have to\nblow up and yell at your mom or anything\nlike that I think it's just talking just\neven having a conversation with her\nabout so when I said that I think you\nenvisioned something which needs to be\naddressed but what I was talking about\nyou see it on my face no I mean because\nyou said like that sounds impossible\nright so what I was envisioning was not\nimpossible me anyway but I I was just\nsaying like you can just have a\nconversation what was it like growing up\nwith grandma just hearing her story\nseeing who she is as a person will help\na lot I think I\nhope you want to know like you just want\nlike some stories about her no no no I I\nthink I think you should hear the\nstories oh yeah I I think that you\nshould see her in the way that we get to\nsee you\ntoday because you've talked about a lot\nlot of stuff that's\nnegative yeah I mean do you feel weak or\npathetic or like a loser do you feel\nnegativity\ntoday dude sometimes I just [ __ ] hate\nmyself what about\ntoday I think today I'm a little proud\nof myself doing this even though I'm\nsitting\nhere anxious as [ __ ] the entire time I'm\nstill pushing through it I got tears\nrunning down my face and I didn't want\nto cry on stream\nbut it's whatever and people find it\nvaluable content so I'm pushing through\nto explore myself but help other people\nexplore themselves and I'm proud of\nmyself great and you said sometimes you\n[ __ ] hate yourself so do you want to\nsay more about\nthat it's the same thing like\npeople like I feel like it's people\ngiving me [ __ ] and not being able to\ngive it back and just internalizing it\nand I feel like I feel guilty or like\nshameful or just like I'm the\nproblem and so I just hate myself right\nso yeah you're the problem because you\nwon't give it to anyone\nelse\nyeah right so when when you ask your\nfriend hey you just say their name and\nthey're like\nwhat suddenly you're the [ __ ] for\nsaying hello that's that's that's what\nit felt like right and that's what I\nmean so when you have when you don't\nwhen the other person doesn't exist for\nyou you just take everything and then\nthat that creates problems because then\nwhat what your friend needs in that\nmoment is like wow sounds like is\neverything\nokay and then you say what can I do to\nhelp no don't start with that say like\nhey is everything\nokay and then maybe it was just a\nmisinterpretation maybe there's nothing\nto it maybe y'all can move on but I\nthink this is a very practical skill\nwhere it seems like you get shut down\nvery quickly from\nrelationships where unless feels like\nyeah and and and that's but like there\nwho knows what's going on who knows\nwhat's the what's the correct\ninterpretation of the\nsituation right and and so like and I\nhope it's okay I mean you're saying you\n[ __ ] hate yourself and all this kind\nof stuff and like I hope like you can\ntell I'm hope I hope I can signal to you\nthat I think that it is possible to make\nmistakes to improve on things and that's\nseparate from you hating like I think\nyou're a good dude I think you're a guy\nwho tries really hard and I think that\nyou're amazing in many different ways\nand I'm not just saying that because\nhere I am pointing out this I think\nyou're doing wrong the way that you\ninteract with other people I think is\nnot ideal and can be\nimproved and then all this pile of\nemotions that you've got I think some of\nit's fair but I think some of it is like\nvery simple you're just accepting all\nthe\nresponsibility right and so now you're\nresponsible for my faults and your\nfaults and you can't fix my faults which\nmeans that you will never be confident\nin yourself because you are always\naccepting blame for things that are\noutside of your\ncontrol so common well [ __ ] you\nbro and thankfully we play video games\nso we understand hey [ __ ] you you suck\nat this game and then you're like yeah\n[ __ ] me I suck at this game and then we\ngo on\nlosing I mean I've actually learned\nlike that's kind of what like you\ncan't it's like in video games like if I\nwant to win a match I can't sit there\nand be like my teammate's [ __ ] suck\nevery game I can't do that\nbecause I'm putting it on them and I'm\nabsolving myself of responsibility when\nI could be trying harder but I\nunderstand like you're so so both are\nequally bad right and you're spot on so\n100% my teammate's fault oh this like\nrank it's like force 50% win rate\nthere's some conspiracy that\npeople are causing me to lose and like\nI'm going to buy a Smurf account because\nthe reason I can't win is because my\nteammates are shitty we've heard all\nthat before that's the opposite of what\nyou are but it's equally bad yeah right\nso if you're like thinking about like an\nEsports team there's a shared\nresponsibility right in relationships\nthere is a shared responsibility and\nuntil you start sharing that out it's\ngoing to be hard to have them and if\nyou're not I haven't heard this yet but\nif you're not careful you'll attract the\nthe worst kind of people which is people\nthat agree with you devastating I don't\nhear anything about a romantic\nrelationship but this is something you\ngot to be careful about because\nsometimes when there's people like you\nyou'll find an abusive partner and it's\nalways your fault and they think it's\nyour fault and you think it's your fault\nand so y'all are there's a\nHarmony toxic Harmony\nit's a lot to process yeah it\nis that's\nokay you done some heavy lifting today\nman yeah yeah I\nagree it's not\nabout it's not I feel like that's the\nanger coming back up it's like not about\nbeing complacent [ __ ] being\ncomplacent I'm not doing that I'm\nchanging\ngood so I think it's really healthy to\nnotice it right doesn't mean that it's\nnot it's not wrong it's just not 100%\nright it's not about don't be you know\ncuz you're doing the work like stop and\nthink for a second that's the anger\nsaying don't be but you're doing you did\nthe work it's done you good you're proud\nsolid like we got to it was fun we\nlearned a lot we're not quite done yet\nbut I'm just sort of saying like you\nknow like you can take pride and feel\nangry at the same time like that's okay\nthat the anger is like\n[ __ ] yourself [ __ ] everybody\nelse seriously it's so confusing too\nlike when it's like [ __ ] everybody else\nand [ __ ] yourself yeah you you just\ndon't even know where to go yeah\nabsolutely man it's it's like being\nstuck in a [ __ ] roundabout like you\njust keep going around [ __ ] Circle\nyeah it's like that road over there well\nthe [ __ ] bridge is broken down so I\ncan't [ __ ] go that way this road over\nhere here there's a bunch of I don't\nknow trees in the road or something I\ndon't know just whatever yeah it's like\nthat just goes back and forth today [ __ ]\neverybody else tomorrow [ __ ] me yeah and\nthat really confuses the [ __ ] I was I\nwas gonna say really confuses the [ __ ]\nout of\nyou I was goingon to say\nit Jacob talks about himself in the\nthird person I do I do yeah right so so\nso that it's so interesting so so you're\nyou're you're you're doing honestly bro\nyou're doing great like the\nneuroplasticity is like kicking in\nyou're like oh this pattern this pattern\nthis pattern and that here's the\nbeautiful thing so thing about the\nroundabout you could the only reason\nthere's exits all over the place it is\nyour lack of awareness that keeps you\nfrom seeing\nthem you have to realize see here's the\ncrazy thing when you're on the\nroundabout and you switch sides you\ndon't think you're on a roundabout you\nthink you're moving forward that's the\ncrazy thing and then tomorrow you're\nmoving\nforward it's not even a roundabout\nyou're not trapped you're on just a\nregular Road and you keep on [ __ ]\nturning\naround and it feels like I don't know it\njust feels like eventually you're just\ngoing to drive straight through the\n[ __ ] like the field or whatever\nthat's on the side of the road yeah\nright and that's where you're just tired\nof it eventually and that's like the\nsuicidality and all that kind of stuff\nand you're like [ __ ] it I'm done with\nthis road I'm just going to head for the\nhills yeah right and and that's\nwhere kind of like I feel like I was\nstarting to end up at I had I had like\nfour people in my life tell me I should\ngo to therapy so I was like guess I\nshould go to therapy good for you man\nyeah how's it\nbeen I've been told people at work have\ntold me\nthat I seem way happier which is very\nconfusing it's like they're like why you\nseem like way happier like I think you\nknow therapy is doing good like he seems\nhappier like I hear them talk about\nme in front of me like they explain to\nother people um and they explain to me\nthat I seem happier but then like when I\nlook on the inside I'm like am I\nhappier so I I think I think this is\nwhere there's so when we're disconnected\nfrom\nourselves so I think the big irony is\nthat sometimes when we when we go into\ntherapy what happens all the stuff is\ndormant And So It all becomes active and\nso what what's probably happening is\nyou're feeling a lot more but in it's\nalmost like an enclosed space like a\nsafe space where all that stuff comes\nout and then you're not carrying it\naround the rest of the time that's what\npeople are really confused about so it's\nvery common for people to subjectively\nfeel worse but then there's usually\nsomething very similar to what you're\nexperiencing which is some amount of\npride but like there's a lot of\nnegativity coming\nout I mean is it a good thing yeah I\nthink so I mean it doesn't feel bad to\nme like it feels potent it feels bad\nthat I have to ask if it's a good thing\nthis is self judgment go for it judge\nyourself right I mean that's your mind\nis going to do that I I don't judge you\nfor it right and now the question is can\nyou be empathic enough\nto lean into what I'm doing or are you\ngoing to be 100% in what you're doing\nand judge\nyourself like so now we're going to\npractice something oh go ahead okay I\nfeel like okay I understand partially\nlike\nlook yeah what do you\nsee seriousness and and honesty what\nelse probably\ncompassion okay that's what I see okay\nyou seem very compassionate okay um and\nempathetic\nokay keep\nlooking what what what do you think I'm\nfeeling right now\nI'm just thinking about it I can't feel\nit yeah so you're not even looking\nyou're looking\naway I'm trying to think about it but\nyeah you're trying to think don't think\nlook\nperceive don't\ncognate look into my\neyes right so what what do you see on my\nface describe the\nfeatures happiness yeah it's confusing\nisn't it\nyeah so now you have to be careful this\nis a very important\nskill when we perceive something that\ndoes not make sense to us the mind will\nstart to play around with it I am happy\nI'm\nexcited if this was anyone but you if\nyou were [ __ ] watching this you would\nbe able to tell and people see happiness\nin you too what are you doing right now\nsmiling why\ncuz I feel like I learned a lot about\nmyself and that I\ncan perceive your happiness right now\nand and this this may be just me\nbeing in here and not empathic with you\nbut I think we're having fun\ntoday maybe not the most\nhonestly honestly yeah it's it's been\ngreat I've been like waiting for this\nday and then the day came and I'm like\nsitting there making coffee like an hour\nbefore and I was like shaking\nI was shaking like the whole first hour\nwe were\ntalking but it's been fun and like I\ndon't know it's been fun to talk to you\nand meet you cuz you seem like a really\nhonestly past past the\nYouTube and twitch and all that stuff\nall your coaching stuff you seem like a\nreally cool\nguy um how old are you I don't remember\nhow old you are\n41 holy [ __ ] you look way younger than\n41\nyou look way younger than 41 it's it's\nit's all the DOTA man it just keeps you\nyoung you know yeah I'm sure it does I'm\nsure it does I'm telling you man just\nlet the nerd rage out let it out baby\nand you will have be eternally\nyouthful yeah I get that\nhonestly no I mean but yeah I mean it it\nwas just really cool to meet you I think\nthat it it's been a lot of fun yeah it's\nweird right and so that's the thing I'll\nleave you with one last thing cuz it\nsounds like we're done and and um and\ndon't read too much and you're like oh\nmy god did I say the wrong no is that\nwhat don't do that okay it's a good time\nto stop so like this is what life is so\nlike this is the biggest lesson that\nmost of us are not taught it's a [ __ ]\n[ __ ] show man it's my team throws and\nthen their team throws and just don't\ngive up because there's always going to\nbe a throw there's fluctuations there's\ngood days there's bad days there's\nhappiness there's fun there's there's\njokes there's tears that's what life\nis you don't need to avoid it the\nbeautiful thing is that when you stop\navoiding life the bad stuff somehow gets\nless bad cuz even when your teammates\nare throwing you can laugh how terrible\nwe had such a big lead how are these\nguys throwing how can you throw this\nhard but the moment that we start\nrunning away from it you know this is\nwhat life is man and I think this is\nwhat you've missed out on for whatever\nreason your birth your circumstances\nyour karma your choices right some of it\nyou control some of it you don't\ncontrol stop running\naway go towards it in whatever doses you\ncan you know continue working with\ntherapist I think it's it's awesome like\nI I don't know what you were like before\nbut I think you have such amazing\nself-awareness now you you would have\nbeen surprised I probably had like a\ngood amount of self- awareness but I\nprobably would have just been like\nabsolutely horribly\ndepressed\ngreat I mean not great that you would\nhave been that way\nbut great that I'm not yeah I'm I'm I'm\nhappy to hear that I'm I'm happy we got\nthe version of you that we got today\nJacob I think it's a fantastic\nversion you know you seem like a really\nsolid guy and you know the only thing\nleft I think is we have to listen to\nyour\ntrack oh boy if you want us to but if\nyou don't want us to we\nwon't you can send us what whatever you\nfeel comfortable with maybe it's too\nmuch maybe we can't handle it what so I\nhave chat off but what are they saying\nthey want to listen to F I have chat off\ntoo I have no [ __ ] idea you think I\ncan pay attention to chat and do this at\nthe same time no um yeah they want to\nlisten to F booyfriend they want F\nbooyfriend okay well well give you give\nthe crowd what they want they want\nsomething you give it to them all right\noh [ __ ] you're way too loud [ __ ] oh\nsorry my bad no no it's not your fault\nit's it's my fault cuz I turned your\nvolume up and then I wasn't paying\nattention and then okay give me a second\nso why don't you I don't want to leak\nthis so you send me the Spotify link on\nDiscord yeah mhm and then what we're\ngoing to\ndo oh my\nGod what the [ __ ]\nson the [ __ ]\nart yeah it's AI actually I feel dirty\nmaking it cuz like AI is kind of like\nplaying hold on we're not\nI feel like what can be leaked from\nhere okay let me just show them\nthis okay so this is a single hold on\nchat okay we're gonna uh let me just see\nis there\nanything\num I'm just making sure that I'm not\ngoing to leak anything if I show my\nSpotify so actually I guess we can just\nwe can turn it on and then I will just\nhave you over we'll we'll see your your\nface all\nright okay here we go all\nright I made I made everything I made\nlike the beat the artwork I did the\nvocals okay so this terrifying art\nokay I see it's explicit are we going to\nget banned am I going to banned for\nplaying this no there's no n or f word\nokay if that's what you're concerned\nabout I mean I\nlet's\ngo I can't I it's too much I can't do\nthis on stream you can it no no can't I\ncan't handle it it's pretty explicit man\nit's pretty explicit it's too much it's\ntoo much Sor my bad no I mean I think\nit's glorious I'm going to listen to it\nprivately all right but I can't I can't\nkids watch this man people's Grandma\nit's not your my Sor it's not your fault\nI didn't know we\nit's called Fanboy friend what can we\nexpect I should have I guess I kind of\nshould have warned you it's it's pretty\ndirty I mean so I think we can you guys\ncan just search for it on Spotify but I\ndo not think this\nis we have like you\nknow like my mom watches this\nsometimes so as much as I want to\nsupport your artwork no it's not your\nfault it's not your fault I'm being\ntransparent with you I'm sharing\nresponsibility I'm saying this is a\nshortcoming please I know you're going\nto feel bad but you get where I'm coming\nfrom yeah yeah I think it's great it's\non it's on Spotify it's called Fanboy\nfriend is it on YouTube too yeah okay so\nit's on YouTube so Grandma didn't hear\nthat I think it's\nepic it sounds pretty [ __ ] hype yeah\nit is but is also just a bit too right\ntoo much too much a bit too\nmuch but I I think it's quite epic how\nwe lasted like I don't know 4 seconds 5\nseconds it's like it's all we can handle\noh you could tell us about your\nchildhood neglect you could tell us\nabout suicidal at the age of 10 but\n[ __ ] but I can't rap\nabout\nFanboys yeah I didn't understand some of\nthose words I've never heard some of\nthose words in combination before shees\nbut you know so I think you win an award\nJacob for the first person in the\nhistory of streaming who has made me bow\nout of something oh dude I don't know if\nI want that award you're such a cool guy\nlike I will listen to the song for sure\nall right I just really don't think it's\nappropriate because we do have some\npeople who are like under the age of 18\nso I understand but I understand we\nshould not but the the beat is an\nabsolute Banger it you know what what's\nfunny about it is it was like the\nsimplest beat I ever made I just did\nlike little horns and then bass and then\ndrums I spent 10 hours on Beats before\nand then everybody's like I love this\nbeat this beat's fire and I'm like dude\nI spent like 30 minutes on it well you\nknow when\nit's when it's about Fanboys you just\nbring everything up when it comes from\nthe heart or other places you\nknow maybe that's\nwhere yeah so so you know if y'all are\ninterested in listening to this oh which\nI would say go for it chat was so hyped\nup too I know I'm sorry chat I'm sorry\nwe're not going to we're we're not going\nto be I will invoke the the what is it\nthe I don't know the the react streamer\nrespect thing where instead of playing\nsomething on my channel that gets\nthousands of listens y'all can go listen\nto it yourself if you're interested in\nit and check it out the beat does sound\nlike a banger I'm I didn't show the\ncover art because you know kids yes\ndon't do that and um\nyeah but I you know it sounds great\nman yeah yeah so that uh\nyeah today I I was the shitty who was\nwrecked thank you all right I I\nappreciate everything today it was great\nlikewise dude thank you so much for\nsharing your story bringing us your\npresence sharing your music I genuinely\ndo mean that I do appreciate it I just\ndon't\nthink I feel bad but we just can't do it\nman we just can't do it I will listen to\nit now but as soon as I stop streaming\nall right don't worry about it I just I\nfeel bad because I didn't think about it\nI should have thought about it and and\nand I know you feel bad don't take the\nrespon you know so now we can test it\nnow the rubber meets the road right I\nsaw the explicit I saw the cover\nart I knew what the song was\nabout okay yeah right so it's it's not\nlike you were like oh yeah like here's\nmy cover of Mary had a little\nlamb and then it was like the dirtiest\nstuff yeah so I mean like I think you\ndid your part so I think we're now going\nto learn our lesson the rubber's going\nto be thrown I get to take\nresponsibility for it right you did your\npart I'm going to do my part and then\nsometimes this happens in life doesn't\nmean we think less about you doesn't\nmean you did bad doesn't mean you're\neverything's golden bro well I hope you\ndon't get too many Angry Grandma emails\nI mean what I'm more concerned about is\nthat I'm going to get too many excited\nGrandma\nemails right let's not assume okay let\nnot no assumptions all right you take\ncare of Jacob oh one last thing is um\nyou know we have a trauma guide coming\nout soon I I don't know if it's like\npeople know that but I would definitely\nthis stuff about dissociation and\nidentity and all that stuff is very uh\nwe go into a lot of detail around that\nstuff in the trauma guide so you should\ndefinitely check it out I think you'll\nprobably get some complimentary copy\nbecause you're a a stream guest um and\nif you don't like DM me or something but\nand because a lot of the stuff that\nwe're talking about is like there's so\nmuch good research there's a lot to\nunderstand and learn and and stuff like\nthat so definitely check that out okay\nand if you don't get it then let me know\nin some way and we'll we'll make sure\nyou got it cool okay all right yeah all\nright we made it for people like\nyou awesome um yeah it was a it was a\nwild ride today um honestly I hope we\nlike get to talk some other time because\nI feel like there's still a lot more\nstuff that I could talk about and I hope\nlike you'd be done for that so\npersonally I'm very\ninterested the challenge is that there's\na lot of people so what we have to do is\nbalance you know like could we have\nanother conversation there's no [ __ ]\nquestion we could have another\nconversation dude like I but it'll be a\nwhile I I I don't know I mean so so I I\ndon't handle stream scheduling and we've\ngot a bunch of stuff I think the\nchallenge that we really face is that\nthere's a lot of people out there and we\nactually want to hear from as many\npeople as we we can and precisely\nbecause of stories like yours I hope you\ndon't take that as a rejection but no\nwe'll just see how things go sometimes\nwe'll do follow-ups with people I think\nwe're definitely interested in your\nmusic I'm kind of curious about your\ncreative process um all right but you\nknow you know we'll see how things go\nyeah take care man yeah thank you\nYouTube bye\nadios all right\nchat\noh man Jacob is great but I kind of\nwalked into that one so there are times\nwhere you know chat you guys trick me\ninto stuff\nbut I mean the beat was a banger let's\nbe honest\nso you know we\njust G give the guy look he's you know\ncheck check out oh interesting based on\nthis song okay so check out the artist\nis blue j b u j a a j e y and the song\nis fboy friend all one\nword and if yall are curious check it\nout right so that it is it is\nexplicit um but it sounds like it was\ndefinitely made with a lot of passion\nand Jacob is an absolute Chad so you\nknow someone's got to make this kind of\nmusic because we need music for\neverybody and uh I will be listening to\nit but I'm just not going to do it on\nstream and with that I wish youall a\nhappy Friday um stay tuned I think we're\nstreaming next week too yeah so we've\ngot stream on Monday we're doing a um\nADH Doom ADHD Doomer stream and then\nwe've got Detachment part two on the\nmemb side and then um that's what we're\ndoing next week we should continue to\nhave uploads on YouTube uh as usual and\nthen yeah thanks very much for"
