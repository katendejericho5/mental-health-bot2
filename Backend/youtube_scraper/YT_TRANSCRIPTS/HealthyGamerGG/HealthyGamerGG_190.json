righty chat let's get started\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream just a reminder that I although\nI'm a psychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if yall have a medical concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional so super psych today we\nhave a viewer interview today which is\nsomething that we have not done for a\nlong time I apologize y'all but as we\ngrew so the early D stages the early\ndays of healthy gamer GG were just me\ntalking to people on the internet and\nman did I love it and then what started\nto happen is we started to grow and then\nmore people wanted to come on which was\ngreat so we were talking to people like\nthree times a week and then what started\nhappening is we people like kept on\nasking these questions asking these\nquestions asking these questions so we\nstarted to do things like lectures and\nthat was great too because it was still\nus and\ny'all and\nthen things started to change we grew\neven more and then people started\ninviting Dr K to places and then I\nstarted saying okay fine I will come\nbecause we want to spread the message of\nthe cult no um because you know people\nwould invite us and I I think it helps\nto have discussions about things like\nMental Health on different people's\nplatforms so we would do that kind of\nthing and then we started going to\nacademic conferences and doing things\nlike presenting our research and then we\nstarted going to different places and\nmore places and more places and more\nplaces and so along with all of that\ny'all also asked for more stuff and so\nwe started doing things like deep Dives\nwe launched memberships which is going\nsuper well um people seem to be very\nhappy at it we're kind of going back to\nsome of the old stuff that we used to do\nI know for some of y'all that don't have\nuh are upset about that we we're still\ngoing to be doing deep Dives and stuff\non the main channel so if y'all are\ninterested in more stuff go for it we\ntake all those resources and we use it\nto build more things for y'all um so\nyeah so today we're going back to a\nviewer interview but before we hop in\nwe've got a couple of cool things to see\nokay so let's go\nchat I saw someone made something funny\nlet's watch it\ntogether here we go okay let's see how\nloud this is all\nthese out there that are like vagina\nvagina\nvagina hold on let me adjust we just\nneed to listen to that part again\nbecause you know it's like all these\nzombies out there that are like vagina\nvagina\nvagina the [ __ ] and you just can't go\nanywhere with without like this [ __ ]\nhappening to you and if you want to\nunderstand what this is like as a man\nthis is what I'd say imagine your mom\nwas everywhere that every person you ran\ninto was your mom every time you join a\na video game or you're in a voice chat\nLobby your mom is there and she's like\nhave you taken out the laundry did you\ndo your homework imagine that no matter\nwhere you go your mom is there you go to\nthe coffee shop you pick up a coffee\nyour mom's behind the counter and she's\nlike hey did you do the laundry did you\ndo your homework and then you're like ah\nI hate this you're walking down the\nstreet you decide to go out your mom\nwalks up to you and she's like hey did\nyou do the laundry did you do your\nhomework and you're like [ __ ] hey\nleave me alone then you go home and\nyou're like I'm going to play games with\nmy friends your mom hops into Discord\nand she's like hey did you do your\nlaundry did you do your homework there's\nno Escape wherever you go you log on to\nTwitch chat and someone else like says\nsomething and then your mom shows up in\ntwit chat and she's like lol Noob did\nyou do your laundry did you do your\nhomework there's no Escape it\nsucks I don't know like what to say\nbesides\nthat it's like everywhere you go like\nyou're getting aggroed by your Mom\nthat's the closest\nanal I don't even know exactly what the\ncontext of this is I don't even know\nwhat I'm talking about do you all know\nwhat I'm talking about chat does this\nmake S sense to all these zombies out\nthere that are like\nvagina oh I I guess I get it vagina\nvagina\nright so I I guess I guess the analogy\nis like this is what it's like to be a\nwoman on the internet where it's like\nyou're constantly being hounded by the\nsame damn message over and over and over\nagain maybe that's what the analogy is I\ndon't know\nchat but so this is the thing y'all got\nto understand sometimes I open my mouth\nand people think it's good but I don't\neven remember what I say it's like I'm a\nmedium and I'm channeling some high\norder Internet\ntroll all right okay what are we doing\nhere all right let's\ngo here and\nthen let's go here uh so just a quick\nannouncement before we hop\nin so um we did our deep dives into\nKarma which was lots of fun and then we\ndid um so in two days we're starting our\nDeep dive into attachment I'm I'm\nlooking forward to it so if you all want\nto understand what how this is going to\nbe a little bit different so our deep\ndives into attachment are going to be\nnot necessarily new techniques there's\ngoing to be some new stuff in there but\nsomething to understand about as we get\nmore advanced into stuff and this is\nwhat I really like about sort of this\nthis model that we're using is it it\nlets us go more advanced and more\nadvanced is not often times new things\nit is often times more subtle versions\nof the old things which is what\nadvancement on in the yogic path is like\nright so if we even look at things like\nvideo games it's like if you want to\nclimb ranks it's not that you need to do\na whole lot of new stuff it's that you\nneed to get more refined more precise\nand more subtle at doing the stuff\nthat other people do or that you used to\ndo right so if you're playing like a\nposition one or a carry or an ADC or\nsomething like that like farming is like\nthe core thing but you can get better\nand better and more refined at it that's\nkind of what we'll be diving into so if\nyall are interested in more of that\nsubtle refined detailed take then\ndefinitely check it out it's a lot of\nfun I think we're we're doing good stuff\num yeah so let's hop into our\ninterview\n[Music]\nuh uh\n[Music]\nI uh one second\nchat okay\nwe are starting this let me see if this\nworks all\nright I hear\nmyself echo\nhello\nhi all right give\nme one\nsecond nope we want this no there we go\nhello my\nfriend can you count to 10 for me all\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 perfect one more\ntime 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 all right I'm\njust trying to adjust my volume in my\nspeaker position welcome my friend what\ndo you go\nby uh I don't know uh maybe call me by\nmy Discord name I guess great let's do\nit and what is your Discord\nname uh loan loan\nyes it's nice to meet you Lan I am Olive\nbut the internet knows me as Dr\nK I've\nheard and what are we gonna be talking\nabout today\nLan um well I\nguess okay\nso I okay there's half I guess sure like\ndating related stuff okay\nhalf\num just I don't know I\nguess uh maybe\npsychosomatic\nsymptoms that kind of just started\novernight that I can't really explain\nand I yeah there's there's a bunch of\nstuff okay sure what would you like to\nstart\nwith\nso I guess yeah we can start with um\nthe psychosomatic part okay so it's like\nthis this basically I um something like\nit maybe almost six years ago now um\nbefore six years ago I hadn't understood\nanything about and how how old are\nyou I'm 27\nokay so yeah I was like 21 before I was\n21 anything mental health related I was\nlike I was completely fine I would wake\nup and I would be like wow I'm actually\nhappy I'm like you know normal and I\ndidn't get depression and suddenly\nbasically one night or one\nday or basically like I I broke up with\nmy first\ngirlfriend um and I felt so bad for\nher that like and I was grieving so hard\nthat like the stress triggered like all\nthese symptoms like brain fog and um\nirritability like random things like\nRestless Thug syndrome like eczema all\nthat stuff um and it just since then it\ndidn't like even when the issue resolved\nit didn't really go away it kind of has\npersisted I'm still experiencing them\nand in my mind like I eventually came to\nthe conclusion oh it must be you know\nsomething I'm doing or like maybe it\nmust be physical is because I I I I\ndenied for a long time that it could be\nmental\nokay\num and\nso I've come along long uh way trying to\nunderstand what the hell is causing this\nI've gone back and forth between like oh\nI must be mental or maybe I'm just\ndepressed or\nsomething and at this point I don't even\nknow I'm not sure um and I'm not like\nexpecting to be diagnosed or anything\nbut like just you know things like cuz\nlike I feel like I personally don't know\nanyone\nlike I know plenty of people who take\nlike ssris or Lexapro or whatever which\nI do take as well um but like I've never\nknown someone who has symptoms like me\nuh okay in the way that I do which which\nis interesting and and in in relevant to\ndating it does 100% impact my social\nlife in general and I guess my dating\nlife as well okay so you mentioned\ndiagnosis let's just make sure we're on\nthe same page so I'm happy to talk to\nyou about this stuff because I think\nhere we just talk to people about their\nexperiences of Life of their life and\nthat can absolutely include physical\nchallenges that you're dealing with\nmental challenges that you're dealing\nwith I won't be diagnosing or treating\nyou for anything but I'm more than happy\nto um just talk about like you know as\nwe learn like I can explain certain\nprinciples of like psychosomatic\nmedicine and just help us understand\nlike almost more in a general principles\nformat and we can talk about how that\ncould apply to you but I I you know it's\nI'm guessing you've seen a doctor\nbecause it sounds like you're on some\nmedication especially for some of these\nthings like uh restless leg syndrome we\nhave pretty good treatments for that\nhave you tried to seen a doctor for any\nof that stuff ezema seen I'm seen a\nmillion doctors for everything you have\nseen a million doctors for everything\nyeah okay all right okay well that\nthat's that sounds rough man yeah yeah\nyeah so you were and so if you're okay\nwith that I'm I'm happy to talk about\nyou know the whole because I think this\nis way too common where you said that\nlike you know some of these physical\nthings that you deal with interfere with\nyour social life and that's kind of the\nintersection that we see so can you tell\nso are you okay with those kind of\nground\nrules yeah yeah okay so let's talk about\nhow it impacts your social\nlife\num I mean a lot of times I just I guess\nuh\nso on the daily basis um my my mood is\nkind of\nlike kind of just like RNG I guess okay\num like in it um I don't know really\ndepends\non I don't know it's not like like like\nsome days I'm just really really\neasily\num upset by something like what\nlike I don't know small like the tiniest\nsocial rejections will will make me feel\njust really really really bad okay\nand um yeah I think that's a big theme\nis random like social rejections and\nwhat's your understanding as to why they\nwhy you're more susceptible to them on\nsome days as opposed to other days\nthat's that's the thing so it's like\na it's like this this variable that's\nset in my body that's like you're more\nsensitive to things today and then\ntomorrow you might be completely fine um\nyeah I don't I never figure maybe we can\ntry to understand a little bit about how\nthat works because that can absolutely\nhappen and and you mentioned that um so\nyou're you're your social life is\naffected by this so so I'm a little bit\nconfused because you you mentioned\nsocial life being affected by your\nphysical symptoms is that what you\nmeant I mean yeah I would say so I mean\nI would just say it affects my overall\nlife but in social life you know that's\na part of that c can you tell us a\nlittle bit about what it's like what are\nthe things that bother you the\nmost so you mean just in\ngeneral I was more referring to physical\nstuff but if you want to talk in general\nabsolutely okay yeah so\nnot in a way directly related to my my\nmy social life\num the physical stuff I\nguess um I do randomly wake\nup early for no reason and then I'll be\nlike really really um like if if\nI if I don't get that much sleep or like\nmy sleep was really poor quality\nI'll uh just later in the day I'll just\nrandomly just\nstart um like not panicking like I've\nnever had like a panic attack or\nanything but\nlike\nmy um heart will just start racing I'll\nbecome like irritable and like really\nscared of\neverything\num and I guess when you get irritable\nwhat pisses you\noff I don't know I'll just start like\nruminating about random things that have\nhappened to me like what\nI I mean it could be anything like I so\nI I don't know how much I want to get\ninto the specific things that have\nhappened to me\nbut um I don't know like something\nsomeone said to me that like bothered me\nokay I'll just start ruminating a bit\nokay\nso I kind so I I don't if you don't want\nto get into it don't get into it but\nlet's let's notice something right so\nhere we are talking about something and\nyou're you're I don't think I'm not\ntrying to push you towards it so please\nunderstand that okay but your mind is\nlike let's stay away from that right so\nif I ask you about what what irritates\nyou which is not you know I'm not trying\nto pry but do you do you see how there's\nlike a slight avoidance there I'm not\nsaying that we need to overcome it I'm\nasking you to deserve I get I get what\nyou're saying right I think part I mean\npart of my part I mean you have to\nunderstand part of my avoidance is uh\nI'm on the stream yeah of course of\ncourse of course so so so now comes the\nnext question which is do you avoid this\nstuff in some way outside of our\nconversation let me\nthink\num there's definitely stuff I\navoid\num so we're talking about things that\nirritate\nme I wouldn't say I avoid things um okay\nokay things that I think about that I\navoid um I think there's some things I\ncan't think of them right now though\nokay that's fine H happens a lot stream\nbrain I mean there are random actually I\nmean yeah there are random\nlike I think there are things that\nI've there are some things that I try\nnot to think about and there are other\nthings that I thought so much about like\nfor hours and hours that like you could\nhave done with it and so once you think\nabout something for hours and hours and\nhours are you done with it or does that\nstill feel like it's unresolved in some\nway it I think they're still unresolved\num it's like when when I become\nirritable and my body turns into that\nstate of being irritable then those\nthings will come up and I'll be\nlike I can't believe this thing happened\nto me like five years ago okay yeah so\nso it's almost like you're opening some\nAttic in your mind and like stuff comes\nflooding out like stuff that has been\nstored up there for a long time huh yeah\nI'll just find like anything to to be IR\nto pissed off about okay can you tell me\na little bit about that that\nrelationship and and why you felt so\nguilty and when did that breakup happen\nby the way so was like mid\n2018 okay so six years\nago so I felt yeah yeah\num I felt guilty because I it was just I\nmean you know it it's just my first\nrelationship or whatever I was just\nhappy that someone liked me back and\nthen\num she also was\nlike depressed is I mean I wasn't really\nI was like mostly fine but\num I like yeah she was it was just like\noh like you won't get bored of me when\nyou leave right then like no of course\nnot and\nthen and I did yeah it was really\n[ __ ] it sucked um I just felt ter\nterrible and and and what what help me\nunderstand what the relationship was\nlike that you wanted to break up with\nher I I mean it was more like just that\nI just realized I didn't really like her\nall that much like okay or I didn't want\nto be in a relationship with her that\nmuch what made you not want to be in a\nrelationship with her that\nmuch\nuh just\ngeneral I guess I don't know milon\nattraction being like dealing with I\ndon't know\n[Music]\nrandom I guess that's primarily it but\nwhat was it like to be a relationship\nwith\nher I mean it wasn't like it was just I\nit's hard like I don't know just wasn't\nreally into it okay um it was I I I will\nsay there's like a lot of\num constantly having to kind of\nreassure um and that was really really\ndraining yeah sounds like it there was\nlike random times I I just feel yeah it\nwas just draining at times\nyeah so I'm kind of hearing that that\nmaybe your role in the relationship\nchanged and your experience of it wasn't\nso much about like attraction and fun\nand started to become like kind of like\nexhausting sort of like\nsupportive like maybe like kind of\nrelentlessly\nsupportive maybe I mean it was only\nlike three months or something before I\nbefore I like kind\nof broke out and and how did you how did\nyou how did\nyou help me understand why you felt so\nguilty so it sounds like you felt pretty\nguilty\nbecause think about I don't know like I\nmean I just like I just I guess I just\nfeel like I I don't know\nI'm I just feel bad for people pretty\neasily\nso especially since it was like under my\nresponsibility right it's\nlike something you have to do you\nshouldn't feel guilty about\nbut you know I don't know it's like it's\nlike the firing squad you know you're\nthe one who that's to pull the trigger I\ndon't know okay so so you you felt like\nyou have to pull the trigger on this\nrelationship like you have to do the\nyeah and then you're you're and and\nthat's that's an image right there um\nand and so you felt you felt guilty for\nlike putting her through the pain of a\nbreakup yeah yeah and so you it sounds\nlike you felt pretty responsible for\nher yeah and it also sounds like she\nkind of encouraged that like I I heard\nyou kind of make a you know like a quick\nclip of of it almost sounded like she\nwas saying like oh like you're going to\nget bored of me or something was that\nsomething she said she didn't like\nencourage it no but she was just just\nwanted re reassurance it's like past\nexperiences and stuff like that I don't\nremember exactly I don't know yeah okay\nso so it sounds like you broke up with\nher you weren't like too into the\nrelationship you felt like it had to be\ndone and she was pretty hurt and and\nwhat made you feel guilty about that\nsituation I mean I guess it just felt\nlike it was my fa I just felt like I\njust felt I don't know like it was my\nfault or it\nwas what was your fault what was the\nwhat was the mistake you\nmade I guess getting in I I mean like I\nguess not realizing that I wasn't\nactually that into like okay I was\nmore driven by like I guess I don't know\nlust at first and like just I\nguess that I was validated I guess for\nonce what did that feel\nlike it felt really good is that does\nthat happen to you often or is that not\nvery common for\nyou I wouldn't say it's very common it's\nyou know it's become\nlike incrementally more common over the\nyears but\nlike pretty much not you\nknow and um so tell me about what's been\nlike what's life like after the breakup\nso you're 21 years old you're guilty for\nsome amount of time do you still feel\nguilty\ntoday no I don't give a [ __ ] that's the\nthing is uh when I tell therapists about\nthat they're like oh there must be\ntrauma there it's got to be like\nlingering trauma and like no I got over\nit like or like once the whole thing\nresolved she got a new boyfriend it was\ngreat and my my symptoms are still there\nand like stuff like that um and now I\nmean she's getting married I I think\nshe's married I don't know cool yeah um\nno it's it's a good thing yeah yeah okay\nso it sounds like you're over that so\ntell me what the last couple years have\nbeen like for you so between 21 and 27\nso let's see graduated\nUniversity what was that\nlike I didn't do anything in University\nsocially I made zero I netted zero\nfriends okay I went to class and came\nback I\ngraduated did you celebrate your\ngraduation no okay I didn't\nhave yeah I didn't have I didn't attend\ngraduation cuz like the co kind of thing\nonline whatever\num I didn't have a graduation\nparty\num I don't really think about it I had a\nI had a\ndegree okay and what happened after\ngraduation oh and then\num so took me some months to find a job\nand now and so when I turned 24 was I\nyeah when I turned 24 I got a\nbig Tech\njob and so I\nworked in my hometown for a year\nremotely um so since it was still like\nCo and work from home\nstuff then I\num the beginning three years ago the\nstart of three years ago start of\n2022 I\nmoved to\nto Big City or\nwhatever um for my job and so then I\nstarted um I guess dating and stuff so\nyou don't have to go into details about\nwhat your big Tech job is or what city\nyou're in but can you tell us a little\nbit about what it was like to get a big\nTech job like how did that what was that\nexperience like well I I dedicated my\nI mean it was it was nice\nbecause felt like everything I did I did\npaid off uh I spent all of college like\nyou know being pretty socially isolated\nand did just I dedicated a lot of my my\nentire selfworth to\nuh I must get a well-paying job\nokay yeah and and so it sounds like for\nbetween maybe around 22 and 24 you had a\ndifferent\njob uh I I graduated when I was 23 and\nthen when I got my job I was 24 so so\nyour first big job oh your first job out\nof college was a big Tech job yeah and\nhow do how what was the application\nprocess like for\nyou it's fine I\nmean I I don't know how much I can go\ninto it's it's I I don't want to know\nthe details of what the what you know\nwhat you did what I'm curious about is\nwhat was your experience did you feel\nconfident did you feel like I think I\nfelt confident back then back was kind\nof like a it was a good Market compared\nto what it is okay okay so you felt\npretty good about it you applied the\napplication doesn't was it like super\nhard for you to apply did you have like\nconfidence issues or anything like\nthat I think it was fine\nokay and then you got your job and then\nyou moved to big city and then you\nstarted what was that move\nlike uh well I was certainly very lonely\nI mean I don't think I felt the\nloneliness but like um you know I don't\nhave any I still don't have any real\nfriends here actually okay been three\nyears how do you understand that\nactually started two years little more\nthan two years um how do I understand\nthat um\nwhat part of it how do you understand\nyou're not having friends after being\nhere for a couple of\nyears\nwell I think part of the truth is\nI almost I mean I kind\nof haven't really tried\nto um\nI mean yeah I don't know and I tell\nmyself I don't really care but\nlike I mean that's a really conflicting\nthing is because I don't want to be\nlonely and I want social stuff but\nlike the actual Act of having friends or\nor making a friend just like I don't\nknow I\nnever like I don't know it's it's such a\nconflicting thing and\nit's difficult to talk to therapists\nabout or when I talk to my therapists\nabout this they don't really understand\nthey don't get\nit what makes it difficult\n[Music]\nto talk talk about with your\ntherapists because the the the thing is\nI'm\nnot what I what I've gathered about\nmyself over the years is that I'm not\nall that interested in people\nbut\nlike I kind of am at the same time like\non one like I do want like social\nvalidation I want friends and and hang\nout with people but like if there was a\nperson who's like hey this person can be\nmy friend I don't want to do that I\ndon't want to go through the\neffort um and what's your understanding\nof why that doesn't feel worth it to\nyou right cuz it feels like not worth it\nlike I've been trying to I don't know\nI've been trying to figure that out like\nI cuz a long time ago I was like you\nknow it's like the what is it um Dale\nCarnegie whatever his book um is just\nlike to be genuinely interested in\npeople right but being genuinely\ninterested in people becoming genuinely\ninterested in people is like really\nreally hard and no one seems to know how\nto do that and it seems\nlike something that maybe you're\njust you just are that way or maybe this\nthere's just maybe it's my past\nexperiences that have just kind of made\nme this way I don't know so it like you\nfind people to be like\nboring some people I mean I wouldn't put\nit that way\nexactly there's there's just no way for\nme to um make a connection I guess um\nlike like we just don't click really um\nI don't think I click with there's\nthere's few people I click with\nwell and I think those people I'm\nactually interested in talking\nto what kind of people do you click\nwith I think I realistically people\npeople with like similar interests and\nstuff but like I don't know know exactly\nhow true that is um because\nrealistically I think it's people who\nare interested in talking to\nme are very easy so like I I tend to\nonly become friends with like extroverts\nokay it's because very clearly get\num right conversation is a two-way thing\nand\nso uh you get it's very easy to tell\nwhen someone is not interested in\ntalking to you um with extroverts who\nare interested in talking to you it's\nvery easy to tell that they are\ninterested in talking to you so you get\nsomething out of it and it's yeah those\npeople are easier to become friends with\nextroverts who are actually interested\nin you okay when you say it's very easy\nto tell is it very easy to tell when\npeople are interested you in you or very\neasy to tell when they're not interested\nin\nyou or both I would say I would say it's\npretty easy to tell if people are not\ninterested in talking to you\num to if someone's interested in what\nyou're saying I would say I can tell\nusually I just don't know how much\nthey're interested like maybe they could\njust have good body language and all\nthat can other people tell if you're\ninterested um I don't\nknow yeah I don't know if I I don't\nreally know yeah yeah I don't know how\npeople see me from the outside\nlike I mean I'm constantly like thinking\nabout how I'm perceived but that's not\nsomething that I can\nlike it's just never given it much\nthought I guess okay so when someone\ninteracts with you what is that like for\nthem don't know okay I think I think\nthat so I I mean I used to think I was\na pretty um you know not very\ninteresting person I think that's\nbecause the people I was talking to I\nwasn't interested in but um yeah I think\nI don't really give a lot of people like\nthe you know because conversation is a\ntwo-way thing I think I often don't give\npeople the the positive\nuh reinforce like if they tell a joke\nI'm not going to like laugh out loud um\nand so like people aren't like thrilled\nto talk to me you know um\nyeah what do you think about\nthat kind of sucks\nbecause I think deeply I do\nwant I want someone to be happy to see\nme\nright I guess I haven't felt that in\nlike a really long\ntime so sounds super sad\nbro yeah a little\nbit what's it like to live a life where\npeople aren't excited to see\nyou I don't know it's\njust I feel like that's what drives me\nfor to to get\nvalidation what does that term mean\nvalidation you've used it a couple times\nwhat do you mean by that\njust I guess reassurance that\nyou are a person of value\nmaybe okay that's one way to put it okay\nH how how's how's your relationship with\nyour\nfamily it's okay I mean it's fine now I\nthink but we the like\nwe grew up I\nmean\nvery it\nwasn't you know when I looked at like\nnormal American families I'd see people\nwho were like they were like pretty much\nfriends with like their Dad or Mom or\ntheir\nfamily members uh I like no one came\nhome and was asking me like you know how\nmy day was and stuff like that or like\naren't having dinner together at ever\nuh and if if something good happened to\nme I didn't tell my parents about it\nsomething bad happened to me I didn't\ntell my parents about\nit it was very like secular almost and\nbasically it was just\nlike only really like important stuff\nthat we'd talk to each other about okay\nwhat can you can you paint me a picture\nof what growing up was like like what\nwere your days like what would\nhappen like\nwhen you were like 10 like what was a\ntypical day\nlike i' go to school i' come\nhome uh at like 3 or something and\nthen I guess go on the\ncomputer what would you do on the\ncomputer I don't know play like maple\nstory nice I don't know and then maybe I\nguess i' some point I out on Xbox or\nsomething\nbut oh i' play outside sometimes those\nwere by yourself or with friends or what\nI had I had a neighbor or I had my best\nfriend lived pretty close to me so and\nare you all still in\ntouch uh not like too\nmuch um I would say that particularly\nfriend not much anymore\num but those that era does I do have\nsome fond\nmemories like\nwhat I don't know it just I mean there\nwas just no stress\ngo play your Nintendo DS\num play basketball\noutside go hang out at the uh at our\nelementary school off\nhours did you uh did you do how' you do\nin school\noh boy um\nso in fourth grade I so I think my mom\nmy mom got a\njob so like I grew up from from until\nthird grade or until second\ngrade I did fine and my because my mom\nmy mom worked like part-time jobs and\nstuff and then she got a job in medical\nfield um so starting third grade third\ngrade I did fine fourth grade\nthings dropped off because no one was\nthere to really tell me hey do your\nhomework and I was diagnosed with\nADHD I was started meds I started\nAderall in fourth\ngrade\num and took it until 10th grade so my my\ngrades I was saying math and stuff was\npretty good but in like reading or\nwhatever um and like history the where\nyou actually to do homework and stuff it\nwas like not great\num wasn't terrible like but you don't\nhave to do homework in\nmath I mean it was just like I don't\nknow you do it like I don't even\nremember what homework was like back\nthen but for a math it was like you\ncould do it in class okay worksheets and\nstuff it was good at that stuff what\nchanged in the 10th\ngrade 10th\ngrade I think I decided um\nI was like you know what maybe I don't\nlike what if I don't even have\nADHD um what if I don't need it and\nthen oh I I also like\nrealized that like I had did I think the\nmeds were causing me like tunnel vision\nlike um it was like holding me back I\nwas thinking which in a way it might\nhave been um but I think it was actually\nright about that but so I stopped taking\nit just out of my own poition\nand I\nmean sound like my my grades got like I\ndon't know a lot of things changed um\nnot because of the meds directly but\nlike that was the second half of high\nschool\nstarting\num I don't know high school was fine I\nwas\nlike like at B student AB I don't know\nbut did you enjoy High School\nit was fine um I don't really think\nabout it much I think\num yeah I think it was fine like I just\nwas kind of there like I I mean I I I\nwasn't like I wasn't banned I had a good\ngroup of\nfriends\nI I gen I generally like enjoyed my time\nthere I didn't hate it like a lot of\npeople do\nokay some stuff I hate like I some\nteachers and some classes like English\nclass but you know\nwhatever so that's kind of interesting\nright so I'm I'm hearing uh a couple of\nthings that sound a little bit strange\nto me so the first is like so when I'm\nwhen I'm envisioning your life it\ndoesn't seem fine it actually seems good\nin a lot of ways like you've got a good\ngroup of friends doesn't sound like you\nwere bullied doesn't sound like you were\nlike you know failing out like no\nundiagnosed ADHD you've got friends\nyou're playing Xbox you're doing\nband it it sounds\ngood\nyeah would you say it was\ngood I think it was good because I do\ngenuinely remember like I would see\npeople like when I started going on\nReddit in like nth grade or something\nand people were like oh I'm depressed\nlike I've never like Depression was like\nsuch a you know Meme at that\npoint um and I didn't get it I truly\ncould not comprehend that mindset and\nit's not like I thought it was stupid I\nwas just like I just I don't get it\nyeah was something missing in high\nschool did you feel like or were you\ncould just kind of like\nchilling um I guess it would have been\nnice to have like a relationship or\nsomething like at that time I felt like\nI still I did I did want like you know\nvalidation in the dating realm something\nbut I was like okay not having them and\ndoes validation in the dating Realm mean\nbeing wanted by\nsomeone I guess wanting someone and and\nthen wanting you back would be\nright\nokay so I I just want to point something\nout so so I noticed that sometimes when\nyou describe things you're you're pretty\nlike in the neutral zone so if we just\npay attention to your language like\nthings aren't good or great everything\nis okay it's fine it's whatever\nlike do you see\nthat yeah I I I'm thinking I mean I I\njust don't really think about high\nschool that much anymore I mean I'm not\ntalking about high school I'm talking\nabout your the the language that you use\nto describe your experiences tends to be\ntoned down or or it tends to get pushed\ntowards\nneutral right so nothing is\ngreat nothing is terrible things are\nlike okay or not the\nbest yeah I can see that right so once\nagain what did you just\nsay I can yeah I can see that right you\nsee\nthat so so it's it's interesting so\nwhere what's the signif significance is\nwho the [ __ ] knows I'm just kind of\npointing it out right so maybe it'll\nbecome important maybe it won't be\nbecome important so I'm hearing that\nhigh school was like okay you maybe\nwanted to you know be crushing on\nsomeone and have them Crush back but I\nthink a pretty Universal High School\nexperience is that that doesn't\nhappen yeah I did I I did have a a\npretty big Crush for like a year yeah\nshe Reed me and I actually you know I I\ncried in the shower and I got over it\nand it was you know I'm pretty proud of\nmyself for that actually yeah like it I\ndidn't I stopped caring after that okay\nwhat does that mean stopped caring how\nhow did that happen you just cried and\nand walk us through\nthat I mean I was just you know she\ndidn't like me back we were on like some\nband trip or something um and I was like\nI'm going to go take a shower we like\nshared a hotel room and I just I went in\nthe shower and\ncried and then I was like you shared a\nhotel room with your crush no no no no\nokay okay uh no it was like like we were\nsharing a hotel room like my my my band\nfriends okay and and did you tell anyone\nthat you were going to ask her\nout how would exactly happened is a\nlittle my friend one of my other friends\nwas stupid and\ntexted somehow got her number and texted\nher that I liked her and then when it\ncame to like the hey do does she\nactually like me back she said no or\nwhatever but\nwhatever yeah and then and then how did\nyou\nfeel I mean it sucked um there's the\nneutral tone again but\ngood um I mean no I mean yeah it I mean\nit felt really bad like I don't know\nlike there's not much\nI yeah I mean I don't know I guess I was\ncrushed I guess I was\ncrushed you you play games today loan\nyeah what do you play\nso let's playing League some point\nrecently but not much anymore\num yeah so it's interesting right so I I\nguess I was crushed so it's like if\nwe're playing a game of League of\nLegends\nand you know like we don't say like I\nguess I was crushed it's like [ __ ] these\nnoobs they don't know they don't know\nhow to play this game\nno but that's actually how I am when I'm\nplaying games though really interesting\nwhat's what's it like when you play\ngames I'm pretty I'm pretty competitive\nand\nlike I I care a lot about winning and I\nput a lot of effort into\nit hold on a second now I'm now I'm\nthoroughly confused because you say this\nis how I am in gamees like yeah I guess\nwe got crushed eh what you g to do\nshitty is going to be shitty that's not\nno that's not am I put a I actually put\na lot of okay so you you turn into a\nproper sweaty nerd yeah\ntilt yeah yeah\nirritable yeah it depends on the day\nlike I said like we're talking Le yeah\nsome days I'm like immune you know what\nis that\nlike it's nice it just feels like I\ndon't know are you happy when you're\nimmune yeah I think so like I'm very and\nit's especially those days my brain is\njust working better than usual like the\nbrain fog is not I think as bad okay so\nso this is important there there's a\ndifference between happiness and the\nabsence of\nirritability are you on those days are\nyou are we talking\nlike neutral to irritable or are we\ntalking irritable to\nhappy not irritable to have like I'm\nvery I would say neutral\nokay do you have\nfun yeah I think so you think\nso so this is important I'm I'm not\ntrying to beat you up and if it feels\nlike I'm beating you up you got to let\nme know okay are we doing okay so far\nyeah yeah okay yeah so like I think it's\nreally important for us to understand\nwhether you know you're having fun or\nyou don't know right so that's like an\nimportant signal is are you capable or\ndo you have awareness I'm not trying to\n[ __ ] on you here because we'll get to\nthat not not [ __ ] on you sorry what\nI mean is we'll we'll explain why but\nthis is an important piece of\ninformation right so are you even to a\ncertain degree numb to your\nenjoyment like are you aware that you're\nhaving\nfun I think in there are definitely\nmoments or like yeah there are\ndefinitely moments in when I'm playing\ngames that I I'm I definitely recognize\nyeah I am having fun are there days of\nyour life where you're like man life is\n[ __ ] awesome like this is [ __ ]\ngreat yeah absolutely tell me about\nthose\ndays I don't know uh things just are\njust I don't know just going my way or\nlike\nmy it's just so complicated there's it's\njust so complicated\nlike I guess so like the question\nquestion is like is it because of\nsomething externally that happened to me\nthat's just good or things or maybe a\nstring of things that happen that are\ngood I think that's probably at least\npart of it can you give us an\nexample when was the last time you had a\ngreat\nday oh\nGod the first thing that my mind goes to\nis like work when I when I solve a\nproblem or something and then I think\nI'm I'm good but like it's\nso like boring I guess or it's like sad\nto think about from like the outside\nperspective yeah M goes to that so now\nwe get to some fun stuff Lan when you\nrealize something about your life that\nis sad from the outside perspective and\nthis may be hard for you to answer\nbecause there's a bunch of [ __ ]\nhypothetical so when you think about\nwhen you notice something about your\nlife and then you look at it from the\noutside and you're like that sounds\nboring\nwhat do you do then what does your mind\ndo historically I've always\num thought I always want to like make it\nbetter somehow or like oh I got to start\ndoing this I got to start doing that\num yeah and what kind of things do you\nneed to start doing\nI mean now I don't know where my mind\nwill go but in the past it was like oh I\ngotta start doing social clubs at\nUniversity or I\ngotta I don't know like I mean\ndefinitely not directly related to this\nbut I guess oh I need to go to the gym\nand stuff like that or I want to lose\npounds or something and and that's when\nyou're feeling good about yourself is\nthe kind of thoughts you have like so\nwhen you have a good day at work and\nyou're like wow that sounds kind of\nboring like oh no no this is when you're\nfeeling bad about yourself yeah and then\nwhat's it what's it like to go to a\nsocial club or go to the gym what's your\nexperience of\nthat I I I enjoy the gym I'm just so so\nfor the gym I you know I enjoyed I I\npretty consistently went for like two\nyears and stuff I just didn't make a lot\nof progress and I real I'm just like\nfatigued all the time so like it's hard\nto keep making progress um and so but\nsocial related stuff\nis kind of a nightmare I\nmean yeah it's it's it's kind of a\nnightmare um I don't know what the\nphrase kind of a nightmare means\nI can you help me understand\nthat because it's it's it's not always\nso it's either a nightmare\nor it's fine okay so so talk us through\na nightmare we doing okay low are you\nfeeling judged or silly or okay yeah\nyeah um like I think you're great bro\nwe're you know let's just look at things\nas they are no no judgment from my\nend yeah so so what does that when\nthings are a nightmare what does that\nmean I think\nthat so there are times I put myself\ninto I've you know put myself out there\nwhatever for socializing or\nwhatever and often in the\npast maybe this was started like six\nyears ago till like four years ago\nduring University I was like trying to\nput myself out there and it would end up\nnot great because I would\nfeel just social rejection in some way\nand it would kind of\nreinforce what I was feeling and it kind\nof just made it\nworse can you give me an\nexample of putting yourself out there\nand like what the sequence of events was\nlike let's say I we're doing a replay\nanalysis what would we\nsee uh I would say a clear\nexample\nis I did an internship\nand it was on paper it was great I mean\nit was great thinking back it was I do\nstill have fond memories of the of that\ntime this was post um psychosomatic\nsymptoms or whatever and depression\nstuff or\nwhatever\nand I so it was a so this Tech entership\nit you know they housed us\nand there was I don't remember how many\nother interns maybe like 50 or 60 or\nsomething we basically were housed in\nlike we you know I I had like three\nroommates I had my own room and there\nwas a lot of um it was just it socially\nit was great because they spoil interns\num and so like we it was basically like\nthere was you know a lot of partying and\nstuff like\nthat me um I feel like I did I realized\nto do well in group\nsettings but I couldn't really like make\nconnections with\npeople um like I struggled to\nlike yeah like no like I I was good in\ngroup settings but I didn't actually\nmake friends I\nthink like there was no one I could sit\noneon-one with and just really like\nconnect with what would happen what what\nwhat would the signals of of social\nrejection look like do you\nremember\num trying to think um I mean it\nwas I think the first thing that comes\nto mind is not being included in\nstuff but I wasn't included in stuff\nlike early\non\num maybe there's a lot of small things\nlike uh like talking to people I don't\nknow sorry I'm gonna cut you off so okay\nso um can I ask so so you don't have to\nanswer this and we don't need to go into\ndetail but what are your what are you\nworking on in\ntherapy I I kind of stopped going to\ntherapy okay what what are you working\non\nso okay so my\ntherapist last year we were talking\nabout like why I'm not or um yeah like I\nwas talking about I'm not interest I\ndon't think I'm maybe interested in\npeople um and my I guess inadequacies\nand stuff like that or like just\nself-esteem stuff like that she was\ntrying to um put a label on me um I\nguess it was part of her job but I found\nit kind of annoying um\nshe really insisted on yeah putting a\nlabel on me basically like what is that\nokay like she wanted to give you a\ndiagnosis okay so it sounds like her\ngoal and your goal were not very aligned\nlike you wanted to focus on particular\nproblems yeah I would say so okay\nokay and so presumably we were going to\ntalk about dating so do you want to talk\na little bit about that we we can yeah\nyeah let's let's hear about it we're how\nyou feeling you doing okay yeah yeah\nyeah it's just there's yeah there's just\nthere so much like so little time I\ndon't know can can I share with you what\nit's what my experience this\nconversation is like okay sure I I think\nit's great man I think you're awesome\nand I I think that that you have a lot\nof\nchallenges I think I see\nso my impression of you is\nthat I get the sense that you have very\nvery powerful forces that are dictating\nthings in your life that you're\ncompletely unaware of like I get the\nsense that when you try to do something\nsomething comes and like really\npowerfully [ __ ] it up and it and the\nweird thing is that it's not like so\nsimple as I'm depressed or it's not so\nsimple as I have psychosomatic problems\nit's not so simple as like I don't know\nhow to make friends it's not so simple\ncuz like you do have bright points right\nso you're you're able to do excel at\nwork um which I'm sure by the way your\nbig tech company is thrilled with\nbecause they love nothing more than have\nsomeone who has an empty life outside of\nwork and derives their only source of\njoy and pleasure and satisfaction from\nfrom work\nso their hiring their hiring processes\nare spot-on you sound somewhat capable\nyou sound super confused like you don't\nknow what the [ __ ] is going on in your\nlife like you don't know like why things\nare happening you don't know like you\nyou've tried to I guess you're pretty\nsmart right so you have a job at a big\ntech company you never had to do math\nhomework right which I think is telling\num and so you're you're quite\ncalculative like you're you're good at\nlike making calculations and trying to\ntease things apart a lot of self-\nunderstanding but I get the sense that\nthere are a couple like big blind spots\nlike you just don't know why these\nphysical symptoms happen even the way\nthat you talk about them you're like\nokay this thing was triggered by stress\nbut now it's continued for 6 years and\nthe stress is resolved it's not cookie\ncutter it's not like oh like he had a\ntraumatic breakup and now he's [ __ ]\nfor the rest of his life he needs to\nheal on the inside right then you're\nlike no like I kind of got over it I\ncried in the shower and then I was fine\nand my ex is now getting married and I'm\nkind of happy for her like I'm not\nactually hung up on her like I I think\nwhat's really confusing is that a lot of\nthe standard answers don't seem to apply\ndo\nyou what do you think what do you mean\nby that like standard answers like oh\nhe's traumatized from his relationship\nright or like there was abuse growing up\nor like this or that or like he's oh\nhe's got ADHD actually I stopped at all\nat the in the 10th grade it wasn't that\nbig of a deal so so yeah that's that's\nwhat my my therapist would try to do and\nknow just I was I was arguing with her\nthat that is not the case um it's really\nand and all this has resulted in me\nrealizing I'm just a very very\ncomplicated person and I don't know I\nwish I wasn't I wish I wasn't but it's\njust it's it's complicated yeah so so so\nwhat the way that I understand that\ncomplicated I I don't disagree but I\nthink that what complicates the\nequation is there a couple of variables\nthat I don't think we have good insight\ninto right so if I like have some math\nequation that is like a + b + C = 4\nthere's no way to solve it like there's\njust too many blind spots and so the\nstandard stuff like ADHD if we slot in\nADHD doesn't work doesn't it doesn't\nexplain everything if we slot in hung up\non your 21-year-old girlfriend doesn't\nslot in right so it seems like any of\nthe standard answers do not give us the\nanswer on the other side there's too\nmany it's weird does that make sense\ndoes that feel right to you 100% okay\nlet's talk about dating\nokay tell me about dating I\nokay let me make sure can I bring up my\nown camera I want to make sure there's\nnothing showing in the background okay I\nthink I'm good should\nprescription\nokay\nokay um how do I pull my okay here we go\num\nso yeah that was my first girlfriend at\n21 that was my first like anything my\nfirst everything I\nguess it did feel like I was behind the\ncurve a\nbit um I stopped dating until I\nwas I turned 25 and I I when I was 25 I\nmoved\nout to big\ncity um and so then I started you know\ngoing on dating apps and I was I was\ncompletely aware of what I was getting\ninto what does that mean completely what\nwere you getting\ninto um well I mean I just knew that I\nmean you know it's pretty\nrough um I knew not to get like too\nattached or too like emotionally in like\nif I get if someone like unmatches me\nfor no reason like\nwhatever\num but I\nthink yeah so I had like casual some\nlike casual stuff or like I I mean I\ndon't\nknow I need okay I need to be like very\nclear on what I'm trying to say so what\nI um I did have some like not really\nrelationships there were women\nthat a few so I I mostly got nothing as\na standard for the dating exper dating\napp experience but the um the few that\nwere\ninterested I think once again I wasn't I\nI wanted like I don't know like I like\nhanging out with I liked hanging out\nwith them\nand I liked\num all the things involved in being a\nrelationship but I just didn't I didn't\nwant to just dedicate myself to just\nthat like or I I couldn't like I\ncouldn't be\nlike like in a relationship you know\nbeing\nlike only I don't\nknow basically I didn't like them enough\nto be in a relationship with them but I\nI did like them enough to hang out with\nthem do casual stuff and that really\nconfused them and of of course I would\nfeel really bad saying like yeah I don't\nwant to commit or you know I mean were\nyou interested in a platonic\nrelationship with\nthem I guess\nlike friends with benefits and stuff\nlike that okay but like in like eating\nout restaurants and stuff like that too\nso like it's it's so confusing to to\nwomen I think because it's like okay\nyou're doing all this boyfriend stuff\nbut you don't want to be my boyfriend I\ndon't get it so and what would you\ncommunicate to\nthat I I I was very very clear that this\nis casual okay casual what does that\nmean I think it's all [ __ ] I I think\nuh casual like these days it's like a\nmeme where there's just situationships\nit's a situationship okay um so is that\nwhat you were so is that what you were\nlooking for or that's just with the\npeople that you ended up matching with\nthere wasn't enough of a spark to make\nit a worthwhile\nrelationship I think so I I think it's\nthe latter um I\nthink I like at this point I don't\nreally know what I want from an act cuz\nI think I always imagined there was a\nwoman who would really sweep me off my\nfeet or whatever but I anyone I knew\nlike that just didn't really like me\nback and it's been a like a while since\nI felt that way about someone so I think\num yeah it's usually just like you know\nI just I just wanted to I wasn't that\ninto\nthem\nokay so L what what do you think needs\nto what do you\nwant to change in your life if anything\nlike what are you looking for what would\nwhat would help look like what what what\nwould you where would you like to be at\nthe end of our conversation today six\nmonths a year whatever you can pick\nwhatever\ntimeline what needs to\nchange we think in an end\ngoal\nit I mean as an end goal I mean I'd like\nto\nhave like a partner I\nthink I say I think\nbecause I've spent so\nlong trying to get validation at this\npoint that I don't\neven I don't even know what I want out\nof a relationship I think or I don't\nknow I'm not familiar enough with\nLike Love or\nWhatever to\nlike to say like yeah that's a person I\nwant to like marry or\nsomething so what would you like to like\nif I could wave a magic wand and make\nyou bring you one step closer to your\ngoal what would what would the magic\nwand\ndo one step closer yeah if I could just\nlike push you 10% of the way there with\na wave of a magic wand what would 10% of\nthe way there look\nlike we might need like\n50% uh 10%\nI don't I guess so like what would 50%\nlook\nlike I guess my um yeah my my Sy like I\nhave fewer symptoms like my brain fog\nmight be better and stuff like that but\nsince you know that's a little difficult\nso like I guess like being less\nsensitive to\nlike social rejection and stuff like\nthat um\nokay all right a couple more you have\nany questions for me so\nfar\num no not right now not right now\nokay um and tell me a little bit more\nabout what was your tell me about your\ndad so it sounds like your mom started\nworking when when you were in the fourth\ngrade so she wasn't around as\nmuch um my dad wasn't like super\ninvolved\nin like I mean I mean I don't mean that\nhe was like we were like divor they were\nlike divorced or I mean like he wasn't\nlike an involved parent I mean he was he\nwould just do work stuff and then come\nhome and didn't really care that we\nplayed video games stuff like that but\nmy mom didn't want us to play during the\nweekday um but she'd come home at like\n11: so we didn't really\nshe wasn't there to enforce anything did\nyou go to birthday\nparties it's a specific question uh yeah\nlike how how many birthday parties would\nyou go to in a\nyear when you were like\n10\num at least like three okay did you have\nyour own birthday\nparty some years yeah it wasn't like\nevery year but okay is it something that\nyou looked forward\nto I think so okay yeah um and you said\nus so it sounds like you've got at least\none\nsibling yeah and how are they doing\nhe's he's I think he's he's doing well\nhe's he's also a fan of the stream so\nokay maybe be seeing this later but is\nis he h is does he have difficulty in\nrelationships\ntoo kind\nof I mean he's like he's he's more\nstandard um socially anxious okay like\nanxious anxious okay I'm like yeah it's\nit's different he doesn't have um you\ndon't have to answer this but I'm just\ngoing to so so if there is a if there is\na case of some kind of mental health\nstruggle for either of your parents that\ncan be one piece of the puzzle you don't\nhave to answer that we don't have to go\ninto it but I'll I'll explain it a\nlittle bit later if you yeah let's not\ntalk about that specifically but um I\nthink it could be\nrelevant so can I think for a second\ncan I think for a\nsecond okay I'm going to need a long\nsecond here\nokay so you mentioned that you have all\nthese symptoms like eczema restless leg\nand you've seen a ton of doctors like\nwhat's been the what's the\ntldr\num pretty healthy uh I mean I mean I\nthink\nlike I don't know going to an allergy\ndoctor like there's not there's no\nthere's not much they can do there's\njust like oh let's test your skin oh by\nthe way it's like barely accurate\nthere's no food intolerance test they\nsaid to make a food journal 2023 I kept\na food\njournal alcohol triggers me for sure um\nbut like that's not that's about it and\nso um other do like I I was tested for\nautoimmune diseases and it was fine my\nvitamins are fine basically like nothing\nnothing significant in terms of medical\ndiagnosis or treatment like they weren't\nable to find anything that explains the\nstuff I mean I do have sleep apnea may\nlike mild um and so that that very\nrecent development I started I got a\nCPAP do you use\nit yeah I um I it's it's it's hard to\nadjust to\num I realize it takes some time but like\nI swear I think my brain fog has gotten\na little better maybe it's Placebo I\ndon't know but if that's explaining my\nbrain fog at least that part\nyeah I think I think the closest thing\nI've come to is that my stress and\nmental health really really affects my\nsleep which um which makes me have brain\nfog and and some other symptoms but\nthat's I don't know\nokay couple other I'm going to like we\nwe're going to the lightning round here\nso these are going to be random asked\nquestions that come out of nowhere okay\nLan are you\nselfish I think so tell me about that I\nthink I think I'm\nselfish because I have I kind of I feel\nlike I have to be tell me um I mean so\nin the context\nof in the context I'm selfish in the way\nthat I'm very very concerned conc erned\nabout the\nself I'm but I'm not selfish in the\nsense that I'm really I am really really\nconcerned about other people's\nwell-being around me like if I'm being\ntoo loud I don't want to disturb\npeople I'm I'm I'm pretty considerate in\nthat way and I don't like making people\nfeel bad but I am selfish in the way\nthat I am always thinking about myself\nat a\nsocial event I'm often just thinking\nabout myself and how I perceive it's\nlike the whole self-awareness thing it's\nlike it's not a always thinking about\nyourself it's a it's a crutch but that's\nthat's me that's it's it's annoying\nhaving to always think about how you're\nbeing perceived by other\npeople who's responsible for getting\nyour needs\nmet my needs met\num what needs are we talking about what\nneeds do you have\nfood what where in the hierarchy are we\ntalking about where whichever what all\nof them who's responsible for them me\nokay how long has that been\ntrue\num pretty much all always except except\nfor you know when my family provided for\nme\nsure do your parents know that you're\nstruggling right\nnow yeah I yeah my mom's always just\nlike oh you need\nto I don't\nknow I she like doesn't she finds it she\njust like oh you just need to relax and\njust watch the TV show stuff like that\nbut how does it feel when she says that\nI'm just I I I just tell I mean I have\nno shame in telling my mom that she's\nwrong about a lot of things so and when\nyou tell her she's wrong what\nhappens and she's just like and whatever\nI don't know she's not yeah she but\nshe'll she'll she'll keep saying it like\noh you just need to you know just relax\nand whatever what's that like for\nyou it I mean it used to it used to\nbother me more it's like it's it's\nwhatever like she just doesn't get it\nshe why don't you get bothered by it\nanymore well like when I first got my\nsymptoms like no one in my family really\nunderstood um you understand\nnow I think so\num but I don't get bothered by it\nanymore because I mean it's just I don't\nknow just it's just I just come to\naccept them my like my\nparents I go by the principle that my\nparents don't really know anything\nthey know how things worked in their\ncountry when they grew up but they don't\nknow how it works here um and so I'm\nusually\nright it's just kind of how it ends up\nbeing um and I could give examples of\nthat but yeah what does it feel like to\nhave parents who don't know as much as\nyou do and and you're usually\nright I mean\nI guess I have no sense of\num I guess I guess like it\ndoes I guess\nPride do people have pride in their\nfamilies is that a thing like I I guess\nI don't really I mean it's not like I\nlike my family is just kind of or like\nyou know my parents they were just kind\nof there\nokay can you tell me what general region\nof the world your your family's from we\ndon't have to go into specific huh\nMiddle East\nokay Iranian\nokay all\nright I have some ideas about what's\ngoing on with you and a couple of\ngeneral principles has anything floated\nto the surface does anything seem\nsignificant to you about what we've\ntalked about\nI is I mean the I\nmean I've never noticed about speaking\nin a neutral tone but that's about\nit\num anything yeah not really so far okay\ncan I think for a second sure\nthis is going to be like a minute okay\nnot like a second second\nso let me ask you something Lan if I\nwere to say I have figured you out this\nis what it is it's Dr K okay it's not\nyour average therapist how would you\nrespond to\nthat oh I can't hear you can can we hear\nyou uh I would say I'm in just to hear a\nresponse I you know what do you think\nyour emotional response would be to\nthat I guess I just want to hear it okay\nis that an\nemotion looking forward to\nit do you think there's a part of you\nthat would be\nupset possibly I just felt as soon as\nyou said that there's a pit in my\nstomach when what's the\npet some sort of diagnosis okay we're\nnot going to do that right no no but\nlike yeah or like something that I can't\ncontrol that would be do you think I\nunderstand enough about your life to\ntell you anything that could be\nhelpful I don't know I have no clue I'm\nhoping you're you just have magic words\nI don't know okay that's\nscary so now I got to be I got to be\nmagical so I actually need that magic\nwand is that what it's going to take\nwhat are you feeling\nnow I don't know mixed emotions I don't\nknow what good good good good good good\nmixed emotions so what is it what are\nthey let's go through them let's figure\nit out well it's a mix of just I want to\nhear what you had to say and then I\ndon't know what if you're going to say\nI'm Autistic or\nsomething okay and if I told you you\nwere autistic what would you how would\nyou respond to\nthat I don't okay okay so so I think\nthere's a lot of I'm getting a lot of\nturbulence and if you go back and you\nwatch the interview like you can just\nsee it in even like there was spinning\naround this way and that way and there's\nthis and there's this and so so so\nthere's a lot going on it's hard for you\nto see what's going on right you just\nfeel like there's a lot in there and so\nyou kind of want the answer we're not\nsure exactly what you're going to do\nwith it we're not sure if there is one\nbut I'm noticing a lot of like emotional\nenergy okay so um I'm going to need\nanother minute\nokay I was just\nsee okay\nso okay\none other question this is going to be\nthe hardest one you\nready what is what is the biggest smile\nyou can give\nus I don't want to do\nthat tell me what what makes it hard for\nyou to do\nthat it's interesting question no\nit\njust yeah I don't know I don't\nknow I just so so so so don't worry\nabout it we you don't have to smile\nright it's interesting did you think\nthat that would be really hard for\nyou I think I've always known that'd be\nhard for me I've been aware generally\naware of that yeah so how do you think I\nknow it's hard for\nyou that that is the biggest smile I\ncould give you but it's genuine\num I don't know so so now I want you to\nuse your your big Tech brain okay it\ndoesn't need to do math homework brain\nwhat do you think it's like for someone\nto go through life and like not be able\nto smile real big like what do you\nimagine that person's life is\nlike but they can't\nsmile I don't know probably sucks\nprobably\nsucks\nh i I think it probably sucks quite a\nbit\nno yeah I think so does your life life\nsuck quite a\nbit on paper it doesn't well socially I\nguess in theory it does there's the\nconflict right so when I ask that\nquestion your mind does two things do\nyou see that it's doing two things not\none thing you don't have one answer you\nhave one answer you have a reaction to\nthat answer you have an authentic answer\nyou argue against\nyourself you see how that happens\nfast we'll try again and this time I\nwant you to articulate your thoughts no\nthinking on the inside Lan not allow I\ncan't think no thinking on the outside\nyou can speak but we need to hear your\nthoughts okay does your life\nsuck it doesn't in the way that um you\nknow I'm financially\npretty completely fine um\nand I have no you know stress in that\nway I mean I stressed about work\nsometimes but um socially\nthinking about you know\nyou if I explain to someone that I have\nno friends in the city that I'm in not\ndating anyone I have online friends all\nmy friends all of my friends are from\nhigh\nschool they think that kind of sucks\nmaybe I mean I say maybe because I mean\nit could have a lot of friends but from\nhigh school that wouldn't that wouldn't\nreally suck but so so I could look at\none version of your life and I I use\nthis word on purpose okay and I would\nlook at your life and I would think this\nguy has a life that in some ways is\npathetic how does it feel to hear me say\nthat because that's like not a nice\nthing to say right I'm not saying you're\npathetic for the you know hopefully\nthere's that distinction I don't think\nyou're pathetic I took\num I took mushrooms a few months ago\nthat's the conclusion I came to no like\nI so I've already I'm not you're you're\nabsolutely right um like the one of the\nfirst emotions that came up with like\nthis is sad and\npathetic is your life sad and\npathetic I guess a little bit yeah at\nleast a little bit at\nleast because it's not that I mean I\nthink it's cool that I I I I a\nsuccessful\nfinancially yeah so we we got to work on\na couple things here\nokay\nokay\nyou I'm debating how much I want to push\nyou on the smile we'll probably let that\nslide we're going to be nice\ntoday why do you think it's so hard for\nyou to smile big\nI think\nbecause like my theory is that does it\nfeel like a betrayal if you smile real\nbig does it kind of piss you off if you\nlike smile like if you were like just\n[ __ ] happy does that upset you in\nsome\nway I think I just don't I mean I don't\nlike how my smile looks plus like\nI don't think it's it I don't think it's\na betrayal for me to to feel\nhappy you don't want to smile do you get\nthat like I I asked you what's the\nbiggest smile you can show us and you're\nlike I don't want to do\nthat right so a part of you that's kind\nof crusty it's like\nI I could be wrong but that's kind of\nwhat I'm I'm just sharing with you what\nI'm seeing feeling I think\nI I can't really express myself freely\nis is is I think primarily\nwhy\num I think I am okay like like being\nhappy or like smiling like a social\nsituation is for me a good thing\nbecause okay it's more interesting\ntalking to someone who's smiling I guess\nI don't know so if I if I smiled real\nBig W for you or with you would you be\nable to smile real\nbig\num I mean like involuntarily sure but\nyou don't want\nto and to have the focus being on me\nsmiling yeah I don't want to\nis it because it's the focus like you\nwould feel like too much like you're in\na [ __ ] zoo and on\ndisplay uh not like that but I just mean\nlike I mean even if even if it was like\nbetween my friends or something or like\nin a social situation then like\num yeah I I guess it kind of okay so\nlet's understand a couple things all\nright so I'm going to start talking you\ntell me to go [ __ ] myself at any\npoint um I think that there's a lot of\nsignals here that I think are very\nimportant to understand we don't really\nknow which what of this applies to you\nbut I'm going to kind of explain a\ncouple of general principles which I\nthink apply to a lot of\npeople so the first is how much do you\nknow about attachment Theory L have you\never heard of this I'm familiar with it\nI think I'm anxious\nattachment okay what's your\nunderstanding of what attachment theory\nis I think it's just how you\nexpress um not how you express but yeah\nhow you express\nlike okay specifically like I know\nanxious attachment is like if someone\nisn't reassuring you or isn't with you\nor some stuff like that you get anxious\nsomething like that and then secure\nattachment is you're just fine without\nthem do you get anxious when people\ndon't talk to you are you worried that\npeople are going to break up with you or\nyou like clingy\noh yeah\nreally yeah okay I don't think we got\nthat from the dumpy girl girlfriend\nFriends with Benefits well that's\nbecause I never so i' I've had that with\nfriendships and like random social the\nthing is I've never been with a girl\nthat I was truly really into that's so\nbut if that did happen I\nsuspect that might happen that ain't\nanxious attack ATT bro but okay so let's\nwe'll get to that in a second okay so\nlet's let's understand a couple basic\nthings okay so maybe it is who knows\nthere's all kinds of different ways that\nyou can really understand what kind of\nattachment someone has we don't have\nenough information I'm not going to\nlabel you with one kind of attachment or\nanother but let's understand a couple of\nBasics from attachment\nTheory so one of the things that I\nnotice about you is that you're\nemotionally some some degree of blind\nspots some degree of conflicted some\ndegree of numb so the first thing is you\nhave this\nvery kind of like constrained expression\nof\nthings like do people have pride in\ntheir family like that's such a basic\nquestion that you seem to not have an\nanswer\nto right and and I'm not trying to put\nyou down for that I just want you to\nthink about you know like most people\ngrow up understanding that their parents\nare proud of them and we have pride for\nour parents we have pride for our\nsiblings we are taught how to have pride\nin our family but what I'm hearing about\nyour upbringing so a lot of what we\nlearn about emotions this is like\nattachment Theory kind of 101 and just\nwhat we know about so you seem to have\nblind spots when it comes to emotions\nthere's a lot of conflicting emotions\nthere's a lot of emotional reaction\nfollowed by like logical masturbation to\nget you out of that emotional space like\nis your life\npathetic yes\nbut you're not allowed to say that\nbecause first of all it may not feel\ngreat secondly you do have things to be\ngrateful for and so is it absolutely\npathetic of course not but does it feel\nkind of pathetic is it kind of sag yes\nso this is where there there's a lot of\nlike confusion I think emotionally so so\nI think that you know you seem to I\nthink you experience there's a lot of\nstuff going on inside you that you're\nnot experiencing so this is the other\nthing that we really know so the first\nthing is that we are we learn about our\ninternal emotional environment from\nbasically our\ncaregivers so the way that a a child\nknows how it feels is interestingly\nenough not based on its own experience\nbut on the reflections of\nothers okay so I don't know if you've\nseen this but if a if a if a child is\nrunning and playing let's say there's\nlike a 2-year-old who's like running and\nplaying and trips and falls\nwhat you'll notice is that for like a\nhalf second the kid doesn't know whether\nthey're hurt or not and then what\nthey'll do is they'll look around and\nthey'll see you're nodding along tell me\nwhat kid looks around see if their\nparent like is like you know comes to\nreassure them absolutely right so is my\nparent like oh my God my wiow baby fell\ndown oh no and then the kid will start\ndoing what if the parent is concerned\nwhat will the kid do\nabsolutely and if all the parents are\nlaughing little baby look at how fast\nyou are what will the kid\ndo start laughing\nabsolutely so when you were going\nthrough stuff in the second grade the\nthird grade the fourth grade what kind\nof emotional response did you get from\nyour parents\nnothing so this is what we got to\nunderstand right so to understand our\ninternal emotions we need to see other\npeople reflect our\nemotions right now we get to something\nlike really really simple right so what\ndo you want more than anything else\nvalidation what does that mean you want\nto send something out into the world and\nthe world sends you what\nback nothing well that's what it does\nnow but what do you\nwant right you want it to yeah\neverything I want the world to tell me\nso when you're like talking to your\ntherapist hey my life is hard what's she\nsending\nback what is she sending back\nyeah it's not as validating as I would\nwant it to be so she's sending back a\nlabel\nyeah right you're like hey I have all\nthis complex [ __ ] going on like I'm have\nhaving strugg I'm struggling with dating\nI want to work on my self-esteem and\nshe's like let's discover if you're\nAutistic or\nnot yeah when you go to your doctors and\nyou're like hey I have eczema I have\nrestless leg I have this I have this I\nhave this what do you get\nback that U need to go up on my meds\nokay how does that feel\nI mean\nit it just sucks not knowing the answer\nthey yeah it is kind of invalidating I\nguess I don't know right so they don't\nknow the answer they're just ah [ __ ] I\ndon't know what's wrong with you let's\njust increase the\nmedication very\ninvalidating right and now we can see\nlike all kinds of other like potential\nsignals here which is like you have\ntrouble forming connections with\npeople so you know I think that's like\ntroubling for a couple reasons one is\nthat I I think it's hard for you to form\nconnect we'll get to that in a little\nbit but I think part of it is is\nthat you know it's hard for you to send\nstuff out\nthere yeah you know what I mean like you\ncan't send stuff out there cuz you're\nscared and then if you can't send stuff\nout there like they don't really get to\nknow you and I don't know if anyone\nwho's who's watching is paying attention\ncan follow along but I think you know\nwhat I'm talking about like if if you\nsend stuff out there like you you can't\nafford to send stuff out there so you\ncan't form a connection cuz you can't\nreally send something out\nthere and I mean here you are kind of\nsaying that you have avoided an\nattachment and that you you've been\nclingy with friends and stuff which I I\nmean we haven't talked about that and\nyou know more than I do and you've been\nin therapy and you know I I have no idea\non the flip side I I noticed that it's\nlike it's pretty easy for you to\nmaintain\nsituationships right so I I\nI mean yeah with with with with a very\nNiche set of women but yeah right right\nso I I think that that almost like I\nwonder if that feels like does that feel\nsafe to\nyou safe in what\nway yeah I I I we don't have to fit a\nsquare peg into if it doesn't resonate\nthat's\nokay just it's it's like kind of like\nlmic response like\nyou know because like I what what what I\nwas kind of thinking about is you're not\ngoing to get hurt in that\nrelationship because you're just not\nthat into\nher no I wouldn't say that's the case\nOkay okay so first thing is just\nunderstanding that there's like the your\ninternal experience of your emotions is\nto a certain\ndegree like clouded let's say certain\ndegree conflicted and then the the third\nthing that we've got going on\npotentially is that you tend to tone\nthings down right so we notice that\nabout your language which is like it's\nkind of a nightmare so you do this very\nspecific thing where you you don't you\nyou offer a really extreme word and then\nyou like soften it so it it's it's like\nkind of like you'll you you did that a\nlot where you weren't and then a lot of\ntimes there's like I don't knows there's\nlike I'm not sure like there's like\nthere's all kinds of like internal like\ntoning down and internal responses we\ndon't get a straight response to you\nsometimes you have a powerful I think\nemotional reaction which you then\nadaptively tone\ndown right so I I cried in the shower\nand then it was fine that may have\nactually been fine I think that was one\nof the better experiences in your life\nbut I I think for a lot of things it's\nnot like that like it's like you feel\nactually quite powerful but you don't\nlike there's a powerful emotion but you\nadaptively turn it down does that make\nsense does that resonate with\nyou to an extent yeah okay so I think\nthere's some amount of like\nnumbness and then there's also this kind\nof logical confusion of like I I don't\nthink you accept your own emotions so\nthat's the other big thing is that you\nhaven't been taught how because other\npeople haven't accepted them so now when\nyou're like yeah is is my life kind of\npathetic yeah\nbut you know it's hard to\nsmile yeah but there's a lot of like\nyeah but so that's like your logical\nmind and your emotional mind like\ngoing at\nit how does that sound to\nyou does that resonate not\nresonate it doesn't completely resonate\nabsolutely yeah so I I think there's way\nmore so I'm I I'm not offering you an\nanswer I think this is a piece of a\npuzzle okay I'm having like mild brain\nfog so I'm like forgetting forgetting\nwhat you said that's okay right so so\nthat too has a time in place and I think\nthere's a potential reason why your\nbrain fog is emerging now which I don't\nthink is is so remember I asked you like\nif I gave you an answer what would be\nresponse do you remember when I asked\nyou that\nquestion I don't remember okay that's\nokay okay so so there's some amount do\nwhat's the best way to deal with the\nbrain fog do you have a\nsense get as much sleep as possible okay\nso it looks like that's you want to take\na quick nap nap and then resume or what\nno uh I mean nothing really like I mean\nI think it's fine okay so let's explain\na couple other principles let's just\nforget about that for a second yeah so\nthe next thing to understand is anytime\nwe have\nemot anytime we have emotions that are\nnot dealt with so that can be processed\ninternally that can be validated right\nso there's a lack of validation in your\nupbringing and your social connections\nEtc the other thing that we sort of know\nfrom science is that these emotions will\nmanifest in the\nbody so so this is where like it it's\nreally tricky I I don't think that this\nis all in your head I think that's a\nvery incorrect way of understanding\nthese symptoms at the same time we know\nthat there are clinical trials on things\nlike\nfibromyalgia which show that as people\nstart dealing with their emotions the\nfibromyalgia improves I don't think that\nthis is all in their head I think now\nwe've elucidated something called\npsychon\nneuroimmunology which which is this this\nlike field of study where the way we\nfeel mentally triggers certain physical\nchanges so changes in our like so when\nwe feel mentally stressed we release\ncortisol cortisol causes\ndemarginalization of white blood cells\nwhich basically means it puts our immune\nsystem on high alert when our immune\nsystem is on high alert and there's\nnothing to fight against it starts\nattacking ourselves so it's like we've\npulled the pin out of the grenade and\nwe're like looking around for where to\nthrow it where to throw it where to\nthrow it where to throw it and then it\njust explodes in our hands so this is\nlike what happens to our immune system\nwhen we get stressed\nout so this correlates with like\nemotional numbness because one of the\nways that you can mentally dstress is to\ndeal with your emotions does that make\nsense now the challenge is I don't know\nthat you know what you're feeling or you\ninvalidate your own emotions so you\ncan't actually deal with them does that\nmake\nsense yeah\nI yeah I think I mean I I was under the\nimpression I I at least mostly\nunderstood my\nemotions like I'm not like what is it\nAlexa thic or\nwhatever uh I I mean I I think you have\na lot going on emotionally that you I\nthink the challenge is that you have a\nyou understand a slice of your emotions\nincredibly\nwell yeah so I I don't think you're like\nyou uniformly numb I think that's what's\nso tricky about this is there's a lot of\ndifferent pieces\nhere but I I think that\nyou're what do you think I mean do you\nthink there could be emotions going on\nthat you\ndon't I mean there must be I I I I think\nI don't know I explored that\nwhen I I saw your video on psychosomatic\nillness and then I also read part of a a\nbook from Carl y\nand it was it was talking about like how\nlike a guy who person who's like\nstressed or something will like cough\nlike is that really like I didn't\nknow about psychosomatic illness and\nthen I saw your video and and I was like\nhm okay I'll go to therapy I'll try\nshrooms\nuh so so this this is the other we so\nnow we're going to get to one other area\nwhich is like your relationships I think\nit's hard for you to show form\nconnections because I don't know if you\nknow what you're feeling and I think\nit's it's really hard for you to show us\nthe best parts of\nyou like do you get that like you're\nhiding you're\nsneaky like we see these little Smiles\nright so tell me about shrooms\nL streams\n[Music]\nyeah uh first of all do you want to talk\nabout it yeah\nyeah\n[Music]\num the last\nI did the first time I took two Gams\nlike several months ago I was on I I was\non 5 milligrams Lexa Pro and I was fine\nit was a good experience it didn't feel\nbad the next time I took it I was on a\nslightly like two and a half I was\ntrying to taper off and then um I took\ntwo grams again and uh yeah those\nthoughts of\nlike who it was\njust immense\nsadness um which was really confusing\nbecause like I didn't\nthink I I the reason I took it actually\nwas\nbecause I woke up from a dream where I\nfelt like everyone hated\nme uh and I didn't know why everyone was\njust like tired of\nme um and then so I woke up and I was\nlike hm\nI guess there's some internal stuff\ngoing on so I I took\nshrooms and\nthen I just felt it was just really\nreally really sad um I wrote stuff down\nand I thought I was convinced I was\ndying of like some\ndisease um and I thought it was I felt\nlike I was being mocked by the the\nfungal you know the\nuniverse because I was dying\nno crossing your\narms okay you're right so how does it\nfeel to tell us the\nstory\nuh it does\nfeel a bit a bit I feel a bit exposed\nyeah so let's see how pay attention to\nthat feeling okay bro that sounds wild\nso first of all sounds like you had some\ndream and like you felt really mocked\nmaybe there's something like deep going\non in your subconscious and you chose to\nexplore it and you had this wild\nexperience that wasn't necessarily\npositive but it it seemed very like eye\nopening like you really like understood\nsomething about yourself it also had\nsome wild [ __ ] like where you thought\nthe the the shrooms were like mocking\nyou right so like you recognize I was a\nlittle bit crazy but like sounds like\nquite the\ntrip yeah I don't even think of like\nit's I don't consider it a bad trip yeah\nbut you know did\nbut it was a lot of just negative\nemotion for sure yeah but it sounds like\nyou really uncovered a lot like it\nsounded like it was pretty\nintense well I wouldn't I wouldn't\nconsider it like it wasn't like I it was\nmore\nlike maybe maybe\ncathartic um less less so like it's not\nlike I learned about myself like it was\nmore like wow this is [ __ ] pathetic\neverything's pathetic\nand\nand\num it was mainly yeah just that but it\nwasn't like oh man I realized who I\ntruly am now it was just like\nemotionally cathartic I think and I\nswear maybe maybe I'm crazy but I swear\nI like usually I get eczema in the\nshower like my skin will start aging I\ndidn't feel that after I mean I I don't\nknow what what's going on\nthere I don't know\nyes you\ndo yeah I do I do there's the arms\nagain let's keep\ngoing but the thing is it's not don't\nargue against yourself just speak speak\nspeak what you know I want I want it to\nbe an answer that that you know I could\njust take shrooms and it everything will\nbe fine but it's just not really not\nreally an answer but like so it's\nemotional okay probably\ntalk to me about the shower what do you\nthink happened tell me about the\nshower so you went in the shower and you\ndidn't get eczema which you're right so\nit can usually be triggered by heat so\nheat induced eczema is very common so he\nheat\ntriggers granulation of mass cells yes\nso but you didn't have it this time tell\nme\nwhy suddenly your mass cells were like\nwere [ __ ] taking the day off no I do\nwant to oh I sorry do want to mention\none of the random symptoms is I guess\nit's called cold ticaria or something\nsure when I I hold a cold drink my skin\nwill start to itch really bad yeah and\nthat started after everything and then\nso same with the shower so yeah so with\nthe shower\num yeah like I I felt like the thing is\nI was anticipating like you know I feel\nlike I won't get itchy like or I feel\nlike\num like I'm not feeling like something\nabout my skin feels different what feel\ndifferent\nI don't know I just felt normal or like\nrelaxed or\nlike holy [ __ ] that's wild man I I don't\nwant to I don't want to make it seem\nlike suddenly everything was just went\naway but it was more it was just like\nsomething was different something was\ndifferent you could feel it yeah in your\nbody I think\nso how does it feel to say\nthat I mean it feels like I'm saying\nlike the answer like is I'll tell you it\nfeels [ __ ]\ndumb okay\nright yeah yeah sure yeah\nyeah how do you understand\nthat I don't think it's I don't think\nit's that dumb just because I know I'm\naware of psychosomatic illness and stuff\nlike that but we're not saying it is\ndumb I don't think it's dumb at all but\nit feels\ndumb feels foolish\nit's not that\nsimple yeah I don't think it's that\nsimple like yeah you're right you're\nright\nyeah what do you think what what just\nhappened what do we just do L what what\nthe [ __ ] is this what are we doing now\nwhat is\nthis I don't know how do you\nfeel uh\num I don't know I feel like there's like\nI'm like weighed down emotionally right\nnow weighed down meaning like you're\nyou're not able to express positive\nemotion or do you just feel like there's\na lot of emotion you're experiencing\nright now and you're not quite sure what\nit is I did feel a lot of emotion and\nnow I right now I'm it's less but like\nthere's a constant like like emotional\nGra\nyeah so so there's a lot of emotion that\nis weighing you\ndown I think so I\nguess is this unusual for you to feel\nthis\nway I think\nso yeah so how do you think it is that\nwe're feeling way actually I think it's\ngoing to be hard for you to answer that\nany questions for me or can I offer some\nthoughts we can offer some thoughts okay\nso I I think the reason I'm I'm sort of\nI'm going to slow down on the questions\nis I get the sense that you're\ncognitively spent I think this is like\nyou're o I think we can keep going I\nknow I'm I'm going to do the heavy\nlifting now that's what I mean okay does\nthat seem okay to you\nyeah okay would you want me to keep you\nasking you like more questions or\nyou yeah yeah I'm I'm with still going\nor like we'll continue but can can I do\nyou want to explore more or I can do\nlike thinking and\nstuff you I'm sorry you can do thinking\nand\nstuff I'm saying like you're saying\nyou're doing to do the heavy lifting I\ncan do some heavy lifting too okay so\nyou're not done yet I hear no Bell yeah\nokay let me think about\nthat do you feel like you've\ndone do you feel unsatisfied with the\nlifting that you've done so far\nyeah there we\ngo so does it does it make you feel\nguilty to have me start doing the\nlifting maybe not guilty but I just want\nto push through I want\nto what's the word Thug It Out out you\nwant you want to Thug it out you don't\nwant to let us down you don't want to\nquit yeah you want to you want to power\nforward you don't you don't need no one\nto carry your [ __ ]\nass no\nso that's\nguilt is it what else would you call\nit I I I was going to look it up on the\nin the dictionary just now right so so\nthis is also where it's like weird right\nso it's like it's not eye opening it's\ncathartic right so so you'll use these\nterms and so this is what I mean I I\nthink that there's a lot of like\nemotional there's like a like a a poor\nemotional vocabulary which I think you\ngot because I I think you it's it's\nbrilliant because you don't know these\nwords no one's ever taught you this [ __ ]\nand you're coming up with your own\nvernacular right\nso guilt I mean\nguess I'm confused how that how it is\nguilt I guess yeah so I I get the sense\nthat if I start lifting you will feel\nlike you're not doing your\npart and there can be like inaccuracies\nand stuff like that like sure sure right\nso so I I don't think it's anger I don't\nthink it's sadness maybe there's some\nshame but I think guilt feels a little\nbit more correct I don't think it's\ncuriosity I don't think it's Joy I don't\nthink it's Pride\nI don't think it's\nfear I don't think it's anxiety so I\nthink it's in the ballpark of guilt\nlet's put it that\nway okay does that track or not\nreally no okay good to know right so\nwhen I say something that that doesn't\ntrack for you how does that\nfeel it feels\nlike unresolved or like a like a cord\nprogression that doesn't\nresolve yeah I think I think this is\nthis is okay so let's keep going you can\nI we'll hopefully tie this in so let's\ngo back to kind of like let's understand\njust not about you but just every anyone\nin general so we gain our emotional\nawareness from the way that our parents\ninteract with us okay so once we don't\nknow exactly what we're\nfeeling then it becomes hard to kind of\nlive life and we end up in this very\nlike conflicted environment of like I'm\nlonely so I'm going to move in a\nparticular direction but it's it's way\ntoo much effort it's too confusing it's\nnot worth it to interact with people I\ndon't know how to connect with people so\nthen you like retreat back to loneliness\nso often times when people feel mixed\nemotions what we tend to see is a\npattern of like a\npendulum where it's and this is I think\none thing that you do quite well so I I\nthink you probably do like this math\nequation in your head so some people do\nthis when we feel mixed emotions what we\ntry to do is like almost logic our way\nthrough to get like a greater than or a\nless than and then we let one emotion we\nsay like okay like which one of these\nshould I lean into there's one right\nanswer but then the problem is that in\nthat moment that's the right\nanswer but as your situation changes the\nthe the greater than less than sign\nflips and then you go the other way and\nthen that feels like like the right\nanswer and then over time that changes\nso then you flip back and forth and\npeople feel like not paralyzed they feel\nlike they're not moving anywhere because\nyou're actually moving a lot it's just\nyou kind of go wishy-washy does that\nresonate with you at\nall I think so yeah\nokay I think it's\nalso there's a brand like a you'll\nbranching or I'll think of branching\nthings to say and then jumping between\neach leaf or whatever yeah um there's\njust a yeah I don't know there's just a\nlot of considerations and you try to\ncome up with one answer but then that\nanswer doesn't stand in the test of time\nyeah and this is what leads to your life\nI think being so complicated right so if\nwe try to label you and like even when I\ntry to label you even in a tiny way hey\nman what you're feeling is guilt you're\nlike\nn okay so we'll get to that in a second\nso um so I think that that kind of\nemotional clouded makes it very hard to\nform connections with people because\nforming a connection with someone is\nusually involves empathic connection\nbetween two people so like when you and\nI ceue up for a game of League of\nLegends and we have some Noob on our\nteam who doesn't know how to play and\nthen you and I both rage at them\ntogether that is when we become brothers\nyes these [ __ ] noobs man [ __ ]\nnoobs right it's not your fault it's not\nmy fault we're both like victims\ntogether or we can Triumph together I\ncan't believe we won anyway so it's\nshared emotional experience which I\nthink is very hard for you because like\nand even if we talk about like what's\nthe relationship that you want what you\nwant is shared emotional experience what\nyou want is someone who's into you as\nmuch as you're into them which is very\nnormal by the way it's not but I I'm not\nhearing I think it's very hard it could\nbe hard to for you to form connections\nbecause you're not quite sure what\nyou're feeling and so then\nlike I don't know this kind of makes\nsense but does it feel to you like you\nknow social interactions there's no\nspontaneity it's like a bunch of effort\nit's like I have to figure out what to\nsay what to feel what's this person\nfeeling what do I say now there's no\nlike I I don't get the sense there's\nspontaneity for you but it sounds like\nthere's some contrary information there\nbecause it does sound like you're able\nto form friends in band and things like\nthat you've stayed in touch with your\nfriends with high school so that's also\nkind of confusing what do you\nthink I think you're right there is no\nthere is no spontaneity that's a good\nword for it um and I'm I've been envious\nof people who are very spontaneous\nemotionally they say what they're\nthinking or feeling like immediately\nyeah so when you're envious of someone\nlike what what is that\nlike you logic yourself out of it like\nthere's no point in being EnV no I I I\nfully accept when I'm envious okay um\nI I just want what they have what makes\nit hard for you to get\nit it's like just things that are out of\nmy control just just how my brain is\nor anything that's just about how I am\ndo you think you're pretty fixed\nsome aspects of me I\nthink are fixed\nbut things like traits are like I'm a\npretty sensitive person I think that's\nfairly fixed but what I'm sensitive to\nis not fixed I\nthink um it's very nuanced right so so\nnot not much black and white thinking at\nall right so you you really consider a\nlot of Shades of Gray a lot of\nhypotheticals a lot of\ncaveats I love\nhypotheticals yeah it's I think it\nshows um so what what have you heard me\nsay so far what have you kind of taken\naway that I'm emotionally\nconfused and I'm confused about that I I\nthink uh yeah I don't know I guess was\nunder the impression I really\nunderstood\num I think there's sorry there was one\nquestion there's something some typed in\nchat was just really funny what was\nit I I'm not GNA say it\nokay just leave us hanging\nokay I'm confused about what why you're\nsaying I'm emotionally confused I I\ndon't I can't say it\nokay all right I'm confused about why\nwhy you're saying I'm emotionally\nconfused because I feel like I'm not but\nlike I guess I I must be because so like\nI've always considered myself pretty\nself-aware\nbut but\num no one's fully self-aware right it's\nimposs\npossible yeah so must missing something\nno I mean I I I think it's very\nunderstandable for you to be emotionally\nconfused because on some level it's like\nI'm kind of telling you like oh there's\nan eighth color and you're like what\nlike you don't have a frame of reference\nso it's very natural to be confused I\nthink there's three or four other\nreasons why you could be confused one is\nthat I I don't think you're like\nemotionally colorblind like I think\nyou're quite aware of some of your\nemotions right so the reason that I say\nI I don't if I'm saying confused is the\nright word maybe conflicted is a better\nword but I I do get the sense that there\nis a lot of push back against your own\nemotions maybe that's the best way to\nput it which is sometimes it's logical\nsometimes it's like numbness sometimes\nit's Retreat and so because you have a\nlot of things that would make it\nworthwhile for you to explore this\nhypothesis I would say so one is your\nupbringing also like being Middle\nEastern right so we're not South Asians\nMiddle Easterns East Asians we're not\nknown for being a very emotionally\navailable group of\npeople right so we don't talk about\nemotions Emotions Don't Matter so\nthere's like kind of a risk factor there\nthere's um I think just hearing about\nyour early experiences like it doesn't\nsound like you got a whole lot of\nemotional\nmirroring right so it sounds like you\nwere kind of left to fend for yourself\nand usually when kids are like that they\nhave difficulty recognizing their own\nemotions\nand then your lack of it's difficult for\nyou to form connections which I think\nmakes it so connections are formed via\nempathy empathy involves emotional\nresonance and so if you don't detect\nyour emotions that could make it hard\nfor you to be empathic like I don't\nthink you're a sociopath or anything\nlike that there's another kind of\ninteresting thing going on here which is\na lot of like um internal hyper\nsensitivity so the way that you were\ndescribing your selfishness\nis that you're either in your own head\nor you're in your own body so I think\nyou probably like and this this is\nsomething that we sometimes see where\npeople see when people with anxiety I'm\nnot saying you have anxiety we haven't\ntalked about your diagnosis or anything\nbut when people have a particular kind\nof anxiety that involves physical\nsymptoms like let's say nausea or\npalpitations or things like that is they\nstart to become more restrictive in\ntheir life like I leave the house less\nwhat happens is their their their\nsymptoms get worse\nas they start leaving as they stop\nleaving the house so if I feel nauseous\nand I stay home the nausea will increase\nbecause the only signal that I have is\nthe nausea whereas if I leave the house\nand I start engaging with other people\nthere are other signals that will drown\nout the nausea\nbetter so there there's also a\ncorrelation between social isolation and\nphysical discomfort now I'm not saying\nthat this is the source of your eczema\nor that it's all in your own head I mean\njust from a very mathematical\nperspective there is a relationship\nbetween externalizing your attention and\nnot feeling particular things in your\nhead or in your body so the clinical\nterm not the Clin it's not used\nclinically but the research term is\nvisceral hyper sensitivity and what we\nknow is that people who have a lot of\nthese psychosomatic problems will have a\nlot of visceral hypersensitivity so it's\nnot that you're busted or it's all made\nup it's that you turn up volume or\npeople with visceral hypers sensitivity\nwill turn up the volume on internal\nsignals so that could be a piece too\nthis all being kind of like a very I\ndon't think it's like a one one size\nfits all it's not like you're just oh\nyou're autistic and that explains\neverything but I do think that there's a\nlot of\nemotional there's there's a lack of\nemotional fluency and this kind of comes\nback to like what's the biggest smile\nyou can give us\nright it's just a smile but there's\nsomething within you that is\nlike get what I'm\nsaying yeah I think you know what's an\ninteresting thing is\nuh a few years ago I was I was drinking\nwith a friend the same friend that I\nused to live with in elementary school\nor like we were neighbors um and he was\nlike you know he he noticed that I when\nI'm when I'm drinking I smile a lot\nbigger and is very\nunrestricted and like I thought about it\nfor I mean I've thought about it quite a\nbit since\nthen yeah I do respect myself I think\nyep so so that that's where I don't know\nif it's just straight Alexia right\nbecause that's like color blindness\nthat's why it's so confusing is because\nI I think it's not just it's you don't\nfreely feel emotion because you have\nthat logic that kicks in you have that\ntoning down that kicks in so I think\nit's it's almost like more suppressive\nthan color\nblind right and and then once you have\nthat restricted range then it's hard for\nyou to interact with people because then\nwhen someone else is excited like what\nor if I smile like an idiot are you\ngoing to smile like an\nidiot yes or no oh if you if you you're\nasking me that\nyeah I mean I probably will just like\nreact actively right and are you going\nto but are you going to be happy about\nit I'm thinking I won't think anything\nabout it okay so I think the challenge\nthat you're going to run into in social\nsituations is that when I smile like an\nidiot and you may smile like an idiot\nreflexively but you're not you're not\nall in with me then what happens is I\ndetect that in\nyou and once I detect your reluctance it\ndeflates me and once I get\ndeflated you detect that deflation\nwithin me and then that triggers your\ndesire for social\nisolation I think I think you're 100%\nright right so so and this comes back to\nthe question what is other what are\nother people's experiences of sitting\nwith you and I think you leave people\nhanging\nbuddy cuz they'll Express and you're\nuncomfortable expressing with them and\nthen they're like well [ __ ] this guy\ndoesn't think my joke is funny when you\nthink it's hilarious you just feel\nembarrassed to\nlaugh and then they stop making jokes\nand you notice the change because they\nmade that first joke and they were\ntotally into it and now you detect it\ncuz you're [ __ ] observant and you're\nsmart and you detect that calculation\nand then you interpret it in this\nparticular way and then you're like nah\nI [ __ ] it up again they don't like me\nand then you\nRetreat which is interesting CU you did\n[ __ ] it up just not in the way that\nthink I I have thought about that like I\nhave a friend who is very he's very\nemotionally spontaneous he tells a lot\nof jokes I mean he's a pretty funny guy\nbut when he tells a joke and I don't\nthink it's funny I'll just or like I I\nonly think it's mildly funny I don't\ngive him the positive reinforcement that\nhe's looking for and I think about that\nand like he'll just like walk away like\nnot satisfied yeah so I would venture\nthat the kind of the reason you like\nextroverts it's not all extrovert\nextroverts it's probably oblivious\nextroverts the extroverts that are so\noblivious to your signals that they just\nkeep plowing\nforward I think you might be right right\nso so now this is really interesting\ndon't care huh or just don't care right\nyeah right so they're oblivious or they\ndon't care and then that's really good\nbecause then your negative reaction does\nnot tamper them and then you can kind of\nget along for the ride and I think you\nwarm up right I think you're a little\nbit a touch glacial so but you can get\nwarmed up like we've seen you get warmed\nup\ntoday\nso thoughts questions that's what I got\nfor you buddy\nI I have to think a lot more about it\nlike it's\nuh that I'm just not aware aware of my\nemotions or a lot of my\nemotions\nit's a difficult thing to I guess accept\nbecause I don't think you should accept\nit explore\nit explore it right so and and there's\nall kinds of other stuff like if you\ndon't want to focus on that that's okay\nI think uh another thing is just focus\non the way that you are with people and\nI think there are certain things that\nyou're going to really have to do which\nis Dale Carnegie again which is smile\nlike I think that's law number four of\nlike or rule number four of how to win\nfriends and influence people I think\nyour smile is like you know cuz I you\nsay you're embarrassed about your smile\nit looks like you have a pretty good\nsmile thanks I mean\nin my mind it's like you're just saying\nthat so I I yeah I don't know\nyeah I mean it's not like I'm\ncomplimenting your hair right or your\nmustache not just picking some random\nthing and saying that those are both\nfabulous which they are by the way that\nthat that I would take as very\ngenuine\nwhy don't I don't know I because I don't\nI I guess I don't think my my smile I\nthink my smile sucks can we see it or is\nthat too hard for\nyou well that's a fake one\nthat that's the pose that's the the\nsmile I do for photos and I hate that\nyeah that's that that smile is awful bro\nyeah that's not a smile it's a gri no\nnot not the fake one but like the the\none I did after I don't know I guess\nmaybe you didn't tell the difference\nwhich is not good no no no I I I saw a\nreal one afterwards that one was\ngreat that one I don't like do do it\nwith\nme that's fake that one's that one you\ndon't\nlike this that that one I don't like\nthat well I it's hard because your hair\nis you leave it that way on purpose you\ncan't see the top top of your\nsmile um not on purpose no okay yeah so\nso that that's kind of weird right\nthat's a whole other thing that needs to\nbe dug into is what I mean if you don't\nlike your smile then\nI don't think it's like objectively\natrocious or anything that Grimace that\nfake one that was awful I mean yeah I'm\naware of that I mean that yeah I was I\nwas kind of doing that on purpose but\nuh like the real like even the real one\nyeah yeah so I I I\nthink it's\nlocan\nlaran it's first one loc okay yeah I\nmean I think I think there's a lot that\nyou got to kind of think about a little\nbit and work on\nand I think one thing is\nreally understanding why you dislike\nyour smile so much\ntoo right I I I I don't think it's\nobjectively bad but the question is\nwhere did you get such a fixated idea\nthat your smile is\natrocious and like that's that's\nemotional bro is that I I think so a\ncouple things I think I have I mean I\nhave thought about and\nmy I have a my friend one of my friends\nis like really oh yeah it's just like\nall it's all internal like you just need\nto work on yourself like\ninternally like or like or in my mind I\nthink that's kind of just [ __ ] um\nlike\num like oh you shouldn't seek validation\nor\nwhatever which might be true to some\nextent but it's like if I smile and\npeople don't react or smile back or even\nlike and I get or I get a negative\nresponse there is no human on earth\nwho's going to you know not think that\nthat sucks to to smile more you know\nit's pavian or whatever um when did you\nstop smiling\nit might have been when I was in like\nelementary school or\nsomething yeah so that like that's the\nkind of [ __ ] that you should dig into\nwith a therapist\nbro because I I I think like the there\nthere's all kinds of stuff man and and\nI'd say one thing which is that it's not\nyour friend said is it's all internal or\nwhatever I don't think it's all anything\nso I think in your case you genuinely\nhave a lot of different things going on\nand like it's going to be adjusting a\nbunch of levers small amount over time I\ndon't think it's so simple as anxious\nattachment or a diagnosis\nor you know because you're aware of some\nof your emotions but I I think that this\nstuff really Cascades and especially if\nwe're talking about relationships like a\nlot of that is emotional\nawareness because the other thing that\nhappens is when you when you argue with\nyour emotions you may detect them in\nsome way and you kind of get rid of them\nthat way this goes back to the\nirritability they will surface again in\na different form which is usually\nsomething like\nirritability so one of the three largest\nwillower drains is suppressing emotions\nso if you're carrying around a lot of\nemotions you will see irritability come\nout quite a bit it'll just empty your\nwillpower are you waiting for me to say\nsomething s you waiting for me to say\nsomething no my mind was wandering off\nokay maybe enough for today what do you\nthink I I had a question yeah so what I\nmean what\nif what if I you\nknow don't want to smile at all that day\nwhat if I'm just like some days I'm more\nnotionally numb and I'm I'm you know I'm\nordering my my coffee or something so\nsome days I I will genuin I I'll I'll do\na smile or whatever and it feels pretty\nnatural and then other days I just don't\nwant to at all and just grab my drink\nand\ngo that that's not a\nquestion I mean so what if I don't want\nto smile like you know you're you're\nsaying just smile more maybe that's not\nwhat you're saying I don't know yeah\nit's a great question so so what if you\ndon't want to smile so that that I'll\nturn the question back on you what do\nyou want to\ndetermine what your life looks like the\nway you feel on a particular\nday no okay so then\nsmile so there there's a couple tricky\nthings about smiling in particular the\nfirst is that I think that so this is\nwhere things get so tricky right and I\nthink this is why you haven't figured it\nout because I don't think it's simple I\nthink it's very complicated so on the\none hand we have this whole [ __ ]\nvalidate your right so if I feel a\nparticular way I'm allowed to feel I\nshouldn't supress it I shouldn't\nartificially smile I should I'm grumpy\nlet me be grumpy and the whole world is\nlike yes you should be grumpy because\nyou're entitled to your feelings you're\nlike yeah right on the flip side I ask a\nquestion do you want your feelings to\ndictate your life and people are like no\nright we have the all these people who\nare like super hardworking and they're\nlike when I felt like quitting I didn't\ngive up I kept going so [ __ ] my emotions\nwhen I was angry I forgave and when I\nwas sad I got up and got out of bed and\nwhen I fell in love I had an affair like\nyou know there's on the one hand we're\nlike you're entitled to your emotions\nand on the other hand everyone's like oh\nlike you know [ __ ] your emotions and\njust do what you need to do so so what's\nthe right way to do it so this is where\nI'd say in your case I would learn how\nto smile genuinely when you do not feel\nlike smiling it isn't artificial and\nthen particularly with smiling I think\nis important cuz there's something weird\ngoing on with smiling there's something\nweird like it's like some kind of raid\nboss level weird skull icon mob that's\nwandering around amidst all your other\nproblems and I think you should smile\nand that's where like smiling genuinely\nis about tapping into something\ngood and so I think your biggest problem\nis not just that you should smile it's\nthat when you're in a particular let's\nsay head space let's not call it an\nemotion when you're in a particular head\nspace you have getting out of it and\nthat's going to sabotage your social\nrelationships because now you have a\nhuge problem okay you end up with these\nsituationships why because when you're\nreally into someone it creates a head\nspace and that head space you don't\nreally control very\nwell it starts dictating things to you\nit starts making it hard for you to put\nyourself out there you put yourself out\nthere and then you get rejected or\nwhatever right and like we we don't\nreally know what goes on but my point is\nis that I think it's very important for\nyou to be\nflexible whether internal flexibility is\nnot there right so we see that\nconstriction in the way that you talk\nabout things we see some of that kind of\nstuff and so I'd say when you don't feel\nlike smiling you should learn how to\nsmile and that's where you think about\nsomething positive and then\nyou look up there you\ngo and then let's let's see it\nreal one don't leave me hanging bro\ndon't leave me hanging I feel like an\nidiot help me out help me out come on\nthis is not a might is this not\nenough do you feel like smile there you\ngo I\nmean yeah that was it it was very\nhard I mean that was a very genuine\nthough one though which one that was\nlike yeah I think we saw a genuine one\nin there like because of the emotion\nthat I felt in that moment that's what\nhappened yeah the one before was trying\nto force it and this hard yeah so and I\nI think you've got and it's interesting\neven the way that you laugh you\nconstrain it very quickly do you see\nthat you don't let yourself laugh you\ndon't let it out you try to rain it\nin do you know what I mean or\nno yeah I yeah I think so yeah so I I\nthink we got to whatever that is like\nthat's got to start moving along it\nfeels very calcified to\nme so and once that opens up some I\nthink a lot of your stuff will get\nbetter like hopefully the psychosomatic\nstuff will get better hopefully your\nrelationships will be will get better I\nI don't mean that it's all this thing\nlike it's not like oh we found the key\nand now that we turn it wave the magic\nwand but I think 10%\n20% do you\nthink it's like I asked like um like one\nday I'll feel not that great and don't\nwant not want to smile\nso in my mind like the the whole RNG\nthing that I mentioned\nearlier it feels like that really\ndictates my emotions for that day but is\nthat is that really just head space I\nmean do you think it's like things I'm\ngoing through at that moment are\nmanifesting like maybe the next day I\nwake up just yeah so great question and\nand yes let's understand this so see\nthis isn't a trait it's a state\nthere is variability in our emotional\nexperience from day to day why do we\nfeel scuffed on some days and feel like\ngood and free and relaxed on other days\nthere are a couple of different things\nthat go into that so the short answer is\nno one really knows but I think that how\nmuch you sleep is a huge part of it how\nmuch of your suppressed emotions is a\nhuge part of it I think another part\nthat probably contributes quite a bit is\nare you internalizing or externalizing\nyour\nattention I would guess that the the\nmore internalized your attention is the\nworse things\nare right so there's all kinds of\nfactors that can go into the state of\nirritability that you have including\nthings like blood sugar and all kinds of\nstuff so there's all sorts of different\nvariables I think that you can start to\ntrack those back and this is where doing\nsome kind of like emotional practice\nbefore you go to bed could help a lot\nthe next day like doing some kind of\nmeditation specifically focusing on on\nyour like what your day has been like so\nI think like a meditative rewind\npractice would be really good for you\nwhich is when you sit down and then you\nyou start at the end of the night and\nthen you go back to one let it out let\nit out buddy let it out let it\nout what\njust something\nelse yes that's good right so so let it\nall out so think through your your\nemotional experiences of the day and\nwhat you liked and disliked\nand then\nyeah so during during this meditation I\nshould actually be thinking about things\nthat happen not just like my Brea in\nyeah no you want to think about okay so\nit's like let's say it's 10:30 p.m. and\nyou're like okay well like what was the\nlast thing that happened well I didn't\nreally feel like flossing today but I\nwent ahead and did it anyway and then so\nthat was kind of annoying and then\nbefore that like my food delivery came\nlate and then they screwed up the order\norder and my French Fri fries were soggy\nso that was kind of annoying and then\nthis thing happened and like that was\npretty cool like we had a a late game\nclutch play and then we ended up winning\nso that was pretty sweet and then I like\nleft work and I had plans to go to the\ngym but I felt so like physically tired\nfrom all this physical crap that's going\non so I felt like kind of guilty but\nalso like couldn't so just go through\nand and Rewind the day and hopefully\npeople wake up in the morning feeling\npretty good and so you'll sort of settle\nsettle your emotional stuff\nand just acknowledge what you\nexperienced I guess that just takes\npractice because a lot of my when I\nthink about things that happen is really\nlike jumping around it's really not\norganized yeah so that's why you want to\ngo\nchronologically right so there's the\nother thing is you mentioned some\nrumination and stuff so once again\nyou're not in control of your mind your\nmind decides what to think and then you\ndon't have the ability to\nrestrain it or move it in a different\ndirection so that needs to be worked\non so in terms of your internal\nemotional state where your cognitions go\nall that stuff can be leveled up and\nthat that's why I don't I don't think\nit's like just one thing it's just\nthere's this thing and there's this\npiece and this piece and this piece and\nthis piece I think if it was one thing\nyou would have figured it out\nyeah do you think uh well what about my\nsleep you think my sleep is 100%\nprobably because of\nuh because waking up early and stuff\nthat's like a a classic you know\ndepression symptom right yeah so I mean\nI think sleep is also more complicated\nbut could be some degree of uh\nobstructive sleep apnea which you have\nso as you adjust to the Sleep CPAP that\ncould help some so and then all because\nthere's all kinds of weird intersections\nbetween like sleep apne and depression\njust to give you one example so when you\nactually have these apnic epodes which\nis a period where you don't breathe so\nwhen you don't breathe your body\ntriggers a survival mechanism your body\nthinks you're drowning so then there's a\nsurge of like cortisol and adrenaline\nand what does Cortisol do to your immune\nsystem weakens it strengthens it it\nmakes it it's it's the it's the pull it\nweakens it yes but it's the grenade\nthat's pulled and then you're holding on\nto it right Auto right yeah so so\nthat'll make your autoimmune stuff worse\nthe other problem is when you've got\nthat cortisol and adrenaline and stuff\nit's going to shape the your thoughts in\na negative way so you'll feel more\nanxious you'll feel more depressed it\nall has negative effects on your mind so\nthen that may tip your depression over\ninto early morning Awakening or whatever\nand then the third reason that you may\nwake up in the morning in a panic is\nbecause you were physiologically\ndrowning a few moments ago but you had\nno recollection of that so there's all\nkinds of intersections around sleep\nwhere you know and then if you've got\nrestless leg on on top of that that by\nthe way is consistent with your\nirritability so there's a we know that\nthere's a subtype of depression called\ndepression with anger attacks and so\nthese are people whose depression is not\nreally filled with sadness they're just\nfrustrated and pissed off all the time\nthe really interesting thing is that the\nthese people respond well to the same\nmedications as people with restless leg\nsyndrome so one of the treatments for\ndepression with anger attacks is\nactually treatment for restless leg\nso there's something weird where the\nneurotransmitter is involved in the way\nthat the medication works there's some\nkind of common\npathway we don't know how that works are\nwe talking about\nlike nope so these are dopaminergic\nagents like\nrinol\nwhich you know many this isn't like true\nthere's no like evidence-based guideline\nit's just there there's some academics\nwho study this stuff a lot and they have\nparticular theories and clinical\nexperience so that's what this is based\non there's no like evidence-based\nguideline I don't know that the average\npsychiatrist will know\nthis so my point is that with sleep it's\nvery very complicated you my friend are\nvery complicated and there is no simple\nanswer but there's a place to start yeah\nokay last question um is\nit is it normal at all if\nwhen I first started taking lexipro I\nmean it worked literally like overnight\nmy sleep I finally slept up a good night\nof sleep and a lot of my symptoms were\njust gone is that something you\nsee generally speaking ssris do not work\novernight so they don't tend to be short\nacting medications so usually what we\nknow about the mechanism of action of\nssris is that they tend to\num they tend to change the transcription\nin your neurons so what happens is your\nyour genes will activate in a new way\nand you will make new cellular Machinery\nwhich is why they take about 2 to8 weeks\nto really hit full\neffect that being said I mean who the\nhell knows so people have can have all\nkinds of reactions and we don't really\nknow what happened but if you had one\ngood night's sleep so I don't know if\nit's because maybe you were mentally\nrelieved and then you just got a good\nnight's sleep and sleep did a lot for\nyou I mean who knows we don't\nknow right that that those that\nresolution of questions is really best\nwhen you have someone who's prescribing\nyour medication who knows you really\nwell that's when you'll really get to\nthat level of like understanding of\nwhat's going on with this medicine and\nme my my original psychiatrist I'd ask\nhim this stuff and he's just like I\ndon't know maybe\nvery\nuseful yeah so I I think that there's I\nmean unfortunately there are some\npsychiatrists out there who are not the\nmost attentive to their patients\nexperiences\nyeah but generally speaking I I mean\nthat's not what one of the when we teach\nabout ssris when we learn about ssris we\ndon't tell I don't tell my patients like\nhere's a pill it's going to transform\nyou by tomorrow morning oh yeah no I\nyeah I mean I didn't expect it to but\nyeah it kind of\ndid I me who knows may maybe you had\njust a burst of Serotonin and that felt\nreally good who\nknows there are many mechanisms that\ncould explain what happened to you I\nwould say Placebo being one of them but\nremember Placebo doesn't mean it's fake\nI mean so if you've got all this stuff\nthat's boosting your cortisol level and\nthen you finally destress CU we know\nthat everything that you mentioned is is\nsensitive to stress so Placebo may be\nfar more effective for you than for the\naverage person that's possible\ntoo all right we done for the\nday I can I wish I could have infinite\nsessions but you know so what what's\nyour takeaway from today\n[Music]\nLan um it sounds like I am in deed just\nemotionally experiencing things that I\nguess\nI'm not fully aware\nof and it is impacting me in other ways\nother than\nemotional yeah I I think that that's a\nvery reasonable takeaway so I'll give\nyou one last point so what I want you to\npay attention to so if anyone out there\nis in a situation like yours where\nthere's more emotional stuff going on\nthan we're aware and people will often\ntimes feel like I'm very aware of my\nemotions that's not incorrect okay so\nyou're you're right but I'll give you\none kind of clue so look at your\nreaction to your initial impulse that's\nwhere you'll find the emotion and how it\ngets toned\ndown so you'll notice that you have this\ninitial response and then you'll like\nrationalize it away you'll suppress it\nin some way you'll say oh I don't have\nthe right to complain you'll do\nsomething to yourself and that's where\nyou should look and really te tune into\nthat original thing and where that\noriginal response comes from don't don't\ndevalue\nit and if you're lucky as you start\nvaluing your own reactions a little bit\nmore you may become less sensitive to\nthe Valu the valuing or devaluing of\nother\npeople\ncool one last thing actually how often\ndo you see people like me\nwhat do you\nmean in the way that like all these\nsymptoms and stuff like that you know\npsychosomatic I guess psychosomatic\nillness uh so people like you so let's\nunderstand I I don't know what you mean\nby like you but here are the three\nthings that that I would say first of\nall how often do I see ruggedly handsome\nIranian men with beautiful smiles not as\noften as I would like okay so people\nlike you how often do I see people in\nour community who are successful in Tech\num struggle with social things have some\nphysical problems or just not happy in\nlife despite the fact that they are very\nintelligent and can work incredibly hard\nvery\noften how often do these people have an\nemotional component that is missing in\nsome way very often how often do these\npeople also have something in their\nparentage for example their second\ngeneration immigrants parents weren't\nreally super emotionally available very\noften how often do I see people have a\nnon-perfect relationship with their\nemotions and have physical problems all\nthe [ __ ]\ntime so a lot of my clinical work was in\ndealing with psychosomatic illness\nbecause doctors would get fed up and\nthen they would send them my way and\nthey're like like this person's [ __ ]\ncrazy and then the crazy thing is that I\nknow what crazy looks like they're not\ncrazy there's something else going on\nthere's something about the connection\nbetween their mind and their body where\neven if we don't know we don't have a\nmedicine for cold induced ticaria let's\nsay or not one that you would want to\ntake I mean you could take you know\nbadril or something but you don't want\nto be taking badril all the time so then\nwhat happens is what can we do we start\nworking on emotions some but we also do\na lot of mind body practice and that\ntends to work pretty well last question\nis how [ __ ] are people like you and\nI'd say the only reason that they feel\nit's very logical to think you're [ __ ]\nbecause you you're smart and you've been\nat this for 27 years and you haven't\nmade a whole lot of progress maybe\nyou've made some who knows how you rate\nthat arguably you're better worse off\nthan you were 5 years ago so people\nthink that they're very [ __ ] which I\nthink is very logical how [ __ ] are you\nI don't think you're\n[ __ ] I think that there's so many\ndifferent people here that that as you\nstart working on them you can really\nturn this boat\naround now will you ever be comfortable\nwith your smile like who knows like\nmaybe all it takes and this is where\nlike I can't solve that like what you\nreally need is you need to be hopelessly\nin love with someone who is hopelessly\nin love with you back and they need to\ntell you that your smile is beautiful\nmaybe that's what it\ntakes you know like maybe what love is\nfor you is when you're with someone and\nyou don't feel embarrassed about your\nsmile like that's how you know that\nthere's a keeper like there's all kinds\nof stuff that we don't know but I\nabsolutely see those as possibilities\nfor\nyou we\ncould yeah I actually feel better than I\ndid\nearlier\nweird how do you understand\nthat I don't know cathar catharsist I\nguess\nnope I've been validating the [ __ ] out\nof you\nbro I think it's both okay fair enough\nso notice what\nhappened you said something what did I\nsay you\ndisagree and then I said this is what's\ngoing on and you're like I think it's\nboth good right so I may have just\nscrewed the pooch there but yeah no I\nmean I I think I think and when I say\nvalidating the [ __ ] I don't mean in a\nmanipulative way I mean like yeah I\nrecognized\nthat when people in periods of\nexpertise tell you what's going on you\ndon't like\nthat which is\nokay but yeah I'm glad you feel better\nthat's what I should have said I kind of\nmade a big mistake there but I'm I'm I'm\nglad you feel better and like I'm\noptimistic for you man thank you so much\nfor coming on today thank you for\nsharing your experience of things I know\nI didn't make it easy on you we don't\nmake it easy on\npeople and I'm still now I'm GNA have to\ngo back and watch the time stamp and see\nwhat someone said in chat to make make\nyou laugh because\nthat there it is look I couldn't do it\nbut chat did it that that was that's a\nbeautiful smile that a great\nsmile you know I have this problem where\nit's just I laugh at the stupidest\nthings like whenever my first therapist\nsaid said CDT I couldn't St I couldn't\nhold back my laughter yeah I mean so\nthis is where like who the [ __ ] knows\nmaybe you're like really the the\nsolution is Twitch chat like maybe\ntwitch chat saves\nlorean and yeah that was a did you feel\nembarrassed about your smile\nthere um no yeah so I I think and that\nwas that was a great one I mean I would\ngo back and like we can freeze frame it\non and just look at yourself like that's\na happy dude like that's that's genuine\nit's great for the record when someone\nwhen the person said that it was it was\njust like why would someone say that I\nwonder if he was banned or something I\ndon't know that's all it's all Karma man\nit's all Karma to bring you to this\nmoment because Dr k k couldn't do it but\nsome [ __ ] random\nchatter yeah all all right L thanks a\nlot for coming man all right thank you\nso much best of\nluck and thank you for being a part of\nthe community bro all bye guys\nadios all right chat I don't know I\ndon't know I don't know what's going on\nreally I mean we tried to get him to\nsmile right and it didn't\nwork and that's how it\nis in the words of someone very wise it\ndo be like that\nsometimes um yeah I mean I I think all\nthat stuff is is pretty applicable by\nthe way so like I think this is\nsomething that we see a lot in our\ncommunity is a combination\nof some amount of\nemotional I I don't even think it's\nlike emotional color blindness CU\nthere's two patterns of it right\nsometimes we don't know what we're\nfeeling but sometimes if we're not\ncareful we will actually suppress or\ndevalue our own feelings so quickly\nit'll happen like\nthis the emotion pops up and then\nautomatically your mind is like\nnah that's wrong we shouldn't feel that\nway and if you're not careful it'll mess\nyou up\nman so that that supressed emotional\nenergy we don't really know what exactly\nit does whether it gives you dreams\nwhether it gives you eczema whether it\ngives you this whether it gives you that\nbut the one thing that we do know is we\nhave lots of signals that show that if\nyou think you're the Iceman you're\nprobably not the Iceman or that the\niceman is brittle in other\nplaces right like CU ice\nshatters and so that's what we tend to\nsee a lot is this kind of like floating\nup irritability Tilt at noobs on the\ninternet call it whatever you want to\nall kind of\nchallenges so take care of yourselves\nemotionally and even if you're\nstruggling with stuff there's a lot of\nevidence that shows that Psychotherapy\nis effective for things like\nfibromyalgia it doesn't mean that it's\nin your head it means\nthat in those illnesses we want to take\nadvantage of all the mechanisms possible\nand one of the things that we know is\nthat we can calm down your immune system\nby managing your emotions that's just\nphysiology 101 or neuros I don't even\nknow what which 101 it is\nmedicine 101 I suppose maybe not even\n101 maybe 2011 or 301 it's actually kind\nof an advanced concept but anyway it\nworks so by all means do physical stuff\nto take care of yourselves you know I I\nthink that it sounds like this person\ndid not have the the best relationship\nwith his therapist or his psychiatrist\nbut I think it's like people out there\naren't perfect and we\ngota you got to keep trying and it's\nit's really all about fit\nand I've had I've had my fair share of\npatients who thought I was a terrible\ntherapist doesn't make me good or bad it\njust means that it's about fit right so\nsometimes I'd push people and sometimes\nthey'd like it and sometimes they wanted\nyou know someone who was\njust endlessly validating and never\nchallenging and that's you\nknow that's how it is so find the find\nthe person who's right for you so thank\nyou all very much for coming today um\nlet me just see what else we got so huge\nuh props to lri and we've got a uh deep\ndive into Detachment on the membership\nside on Wednesday and then we're doing\nanother viewer interview on Friday so\npeople have been wondering hey where are\nthe viewer interviews we're bringing\nthem back okay so um y all stay uh stay\nhealthy stay safe"
