    "transcript": "so see one of the biggest mistakes we\nmake in communication is we listen to\nsomeone's response as a measure of\nwhether our words are getting through or\nnot so if I say something and someone\ndoesn't responds in a negative way my\nwords aren't getting through incorrect\nso I recently ran an experiment in this\ngame called Dota 2 and I calibrated my\nrank based on two different accounts one\nwhere I was talking and one where I was\nand one of the key things that I\nobserved when I was doing this is that\noften times when I communicate no one\nwill say anything but it has an impact\nI'll ask people what character they want\nme to pick in the draft and often times\nno one says anything but even the fact\nthat I ask them hey what do youall want\nme to pick signals to everybody else\nthat I'm willing to be collaborative I'm\nwilling to be cooperative I'm trying to\nimprove your game I'm open to feedback\ntransforms the rest of the game even\nthough they say nothing and so\ncommunication is slow a lot of people\nsay it doesn't work it may have some\nsmall impact you just have to give it\ntime so don't give up"
