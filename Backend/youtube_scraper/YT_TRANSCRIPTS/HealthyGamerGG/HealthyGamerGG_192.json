    "transcript": "if you think about people who are\nconcerned about ego and self-worth their\nattention is on themselves the moment\nthat you focus on compassion you stop\nlooking at here and you start looking at\nactually another human being that's why\ncompassion also eliminates ego because\nwhat is it that makes it hard for people\nto be compassionate it's because I'm so\ncaught up on this I can't afford to care\nabout someone else because my needs are\nnot being met and when I look at all\nthese people who are adversely judging\nJordan Peterson or Jonah Hill or whoever\nTaylor Swift take your pick me you what\nI tend to find is that the people who\nhate other people on the internet often\ntimes cannot afford to be compassionate\nbecause of something going on in their\nlife right who is it that is spending\nthe time to just make random toxic\ncomments on the internet many of these\npeople I don't think have fulfilling\nlives that's been my experience anyway I\ndon't know so compassion is beautiful at\nat dissolving ego"
