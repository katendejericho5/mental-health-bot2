    "transcript": "so who's paying the bill on the first\ndate I have no clue my tactic about\npaying I'll say something like I can get\nthe first one so it signals to them that\nI'm willing to pay but it also signals\nto them a Time Dimension and some\nexpectation of reciprocity or I'll say\nsomething like it's on me this time so I\nwill add that time Dimension which I\nfind is very helpful for like\nexpectations setting it's really really\ngood cuz then people don't like argue\nand like oh no like let's split it\nwhatever you I also defer to them very\neasily but then again I don't go on a\nwhole lot of dates or when I do go on\ndates there's someone we should have the\nsame B account so it's a kind of a mood\nissue"
