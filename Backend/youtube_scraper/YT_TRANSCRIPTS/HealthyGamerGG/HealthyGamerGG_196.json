    "transcript": "[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Music]\no\n[Music]\nall righty chat let's get started\nwelcome to another healthy gamer G\nstream my name is all kenoa just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational and entertainment purposes\nonly so if youall have a concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional so today um we have a super\ncool stream that we're going to be doing\nwith Dr Bala subra Manion will'll give\nhim a chance to introduce himself a\nlittle bit more but he's a conscious uh\nConsciousness research\nat Harvard Medical School um so we we\nspoke briefly a little while ago and uh\nI I think his perspective would be super\nsuper cool so we can learn a little bit\nabout the science and spirituality of uh\nConsciousness so he also is uh meditates\na lot and all that good stuff so I I\nthink it'll be like really cool to see\nwhat one of the most Forefront\nresearchers on Consciousness can tell us\num and then also like we're really\nexcited to have him on because he can\noffer both a personal spiritual\nperspective as well as a scientific\nperspective so right up our alley um\nbefore we kind of hop into stream um we\nhave just a a quick announcement so just\na reminder that we launched memberships\na couple months ago I think a lot of\npeople have really really enjoyed it um\nwe had a Karma lecture last week and we\nare going to be having another Karma\nlecture this week uh this is where we\ntend to go a little bit more in depth on\ntopics they tend to be onh hour lectures\nas opposed to like talking about a\nparticular particular post or rant um I\ntend to prepare each lecture in advance\nby looking at lots of research Etc um so\nif yall are interested in more Deep dive\nkind of content we'll still continue to\ndo deep Dives on stream so we have a\ncouple planned coming up on various\ntopics but if yall want more of that\nkind of content check it out um and our\ndiscipline lecture I think cracked the\nrecord for you know the most watched\nmembership lecture yet um so you can\ncheck that out if you want to\nand then uh our schedule is available\nhere so let me just show you\nall\num so here is our just a quick and then\nwe'll hop in with Dr Superion so we did\nDeep dive into Karma Deep dive into\nKarma part two is in two days and then\nwe'll be doing two deep dives into\nDetachment and then every month we also\ndo a\nQ&A okay so um with without further Ado\nlet's go ahead and hop in I told him\n12:05 but now we have a couple minutes\nso that's totally\nfine Dr sub monion we're ready if you're\nready see if he shows up all right yeah\ncoming on yeah okay cool uh can you just\ncount to five for me one two three four\nfive perfect so let me do oh I guess you\ncan't see me huh let me do this see if\nthat works you can see me now yes okay\nso um let's go ahead and hop in so\nwelcome Dr\nsuban um can you just start by telling\nus a little bit about your background\nand how you kind of came to\nConsciousness\nresearch yeah so I am a South Indian boy\nborn in uh South India and brought up\nthere and did uh my medical school at\njipmer poner then moved on to Anesthesia\nresidency at all indan Institute of\nMedical Sciences New Delhi MH and um\ncame to United States to do my residency\nat Beth Dias Medical Center Boston and\nuh I've been doing peroperative research\nfor quite some time but in the last 14\nyears or so I was exposed to um\nmeditation and again because if\nsomething bad bad has to happen in\nsomeone's life for us to turn inwards\nthat's what happened uh in our life\nlives so me and my wife are looking for\nanswers and we look towards meditation\nas one source for us to get the answers\nso we were at The Fringe for almost\nthree years before we jumped into it and\num then I think my wife did the in her\nengineering first and she did that and\nshe came home and I saw her she was\nreally looking beautiful and I said wow\nyou know what happened in this last\nthree days and basically she says I\ndon't know and you're saying this after\n15 years so I said yeah I need to go to\nthis program I did that for almost five\nyears it was a lot of self- exloration\nthen I just got a little bit more um\nconfident and thought okay how about\ntaking this to my field of um expertise\nthat is anesthesiology that is\nconsciousness basically so I asked the\nspiritual Master one question you know\nhow does anesthesia induced\nunconsciousness and he told me that it\njust takes away memory and that was a\nstunning response because that's not the\nway American provider usually thinks of\nConsciousness as and when I heard that I\nsaid wow so what does that really mean\nso that put me on this path and we have\nbeen on this for the last 12 years and I\nthink I'm still a Seeker okay so can you\ntell us a little bit about your\nresearch yeah so even though I am into\nanesthesia and want to do Consciousness\nresearch but I think the framework that\num I'm currently involved and we don't\nhave adequate tools to explore that so\nyou're looking at the footprints um so\nwhat we're looking at is you know how\ndoes\nmeditation uh cause human well-being and\nreduce stress Etc on one side on the\nother side we're looking at cognitive\nExplorations from the peroperative field\nfor example following surgery how does\nthe cognition get affected and trying to\nsee whether I can find a common\nintersection between these two and for\nexample the biggest thing that one can\ndo is prehabilitation that is keeping\nyour cognitive VIs\nat a high level before you go into\nsurgery so if you keep that high then\nwhatever injury that happens during\nsurgery potentially can be reduced if\nyou have kept your reserves ey so one of\nthe best ways to keep the reserves eye\nis to do prehabilitation I think\nmeditation is one important way to do\nthat so we want to get into that but\nwe're doing all the other Preparatory\nwork right now looking into other\npossible ways of quickly reversing the\num you know pre postoptic nitive changes\nand using meditation as a tool to\nfacilitate that okay so when you say\ncognitive prehabilitation what does that\nmean so for example you know let's just\ntake there are many domains in cognition\nright you can think of memory processing\nspeed attention is one important thing\nthat uh less importance is paid to that\nso what we want to do is can we enhance\nthe attention in the pre-or of period we\nhave worked on using tools such as you\nknow um brain games Lumosity Etc to\nenhance the cognitive reserves in\npatients preoperatively but it seems\nthat they're not affecting the attention\npiece so if we can do that that's what I\nmy focus would be this postoper seems\nlike lack of attention is a big problem\nand that can lead to things like\ndelirium and cognitive decline Etc\ninteresting and attention is as\nimportant as you can imagine in every\nwalk of a life right so so for pardon my\nignorance right so I I haven't been in\nthe O for many many many years um and so\nI'm a little bit confused so like I can\nunderstand that we have a skills-based\ntraining for let's say like memory like\nlet's say I do some kind of memory game\nbut my understanding of postoperative\nanesthesia is that we've got various\nlike anesthetics that are flowing\nthrough our bloodstream we've got uh a\nsurgical load on the body you know in\nthe postoperative complications I I I\ndon't understand the mechanism through\nhow is it that playing a memory game can\nprotect us from the very physiologic\nconsequences of like general\nanesthesia right so the main thing is\ninflammation neuroinflammation right so\nthat is intersection for both\nanesthetics could cause that but we\ndefinitely know that surgery can cause\nthat neur infl okay there's a inflamed\nblood and these cross a bloodb brain\nbarrier and can inflame the brain as\nwell so if you have to start itself for\nexample older age or pre-existing\ncognitive decline then when this injury\nhappens you decline even further okay\nright so now we're trying to keep that\npre-operative reserves a little high so\neven if injury happens that is not felt\nthat badly in the postoperative period\nso that's all we're trying to do in the\npreoper that makes sense what I'm\nconfused about what is the mechanism\nright so how does playing a memory game\nbefore I go into surgery how does that\nor maybe we don't know but how does that\nreduce like neuroinflammation like I\ndon't understand how those two dots are\nconnected neuroinflammation is not\nreduced but your chances of going into\nsteeper decline in your reserves is\nreduced right if you start at Point okay\nthen you go to a lesser extent down then\ncompared to starting at a lower Point\ngot it got it so it's not that it has a\nevolving area yeah yeah so it's it\ndoesn't have necessarily a direct effect\nit's just like you kind of mentioned\nboosting the cognitive reserves making\nsure we're at a high level before we go\ninto the surgical absolutely okay yeah\nthat's super interesting so so kind of\nSwitching gears for a second so can you\ntell us like um what is\nconsciousness yeah it's a loaded\nquestion right so um if you I'm a doctor\nso I'm looking at it first from a in a\nmedical point of view for us we use\nglass Goma scale to see whether someone\nis responding to themselves whether\nthey're aware of themselves aware of the\nenvironment and aware of the larger\nuniverse so we can think of this as\nthree steps um sorry I'm GNA interrupt\nyou a little bit if that's okay can you\njust explain to us what the glassco Coma\nScale\nmeasures so you're talking about the\nverbal response mainly the verbal\nresponse to simulation opening eyes\nthose are basically your three you know\nyou can call it as EVS measurements but\nthere a very gross measurement of a\nperson's response to a verbal stimulus\nor a painful stimulus or even a verbal\nresponse to open your eyes Etc right and\nbut that's not really telling anything\nmore than you're awake or not so we can\ncall it as a wakefulness scale at the\nbest yes so just to kind of clarify so\nthe Glasco Coma Scale is something that\nwe use in patients after anesthesia to\nsee how bad of a coma they're in right\nso can they respond to verbal stimuli\ncan they respond to touch things like\nthat so we can sort of measure very\nbasic levels of like are you awake and\nconscious or not right so we don't even\nuse a glass OFA scale Fantasia we just\nask them hey can you open your eyes if\nthey respond to that can you hold my\nhand tight we know that nothing has\nhappened like a brain injury or\nsomething like that so we just ask these\nsimple questions to see whether they're\nawake or not that's it okay but glass CA\nscale is as you know is very specific to\ntrauma injury and U you know coma Etc\nright so that that's what things are\nfrom a medical perspective so you were\nsaying you know you start with exactly\nso there you know a little bit more\nadvanced in the last 15 20 years or so\nthere's a lot of advances in\nneuroimaging specifically functional MRI\nand high density Etc that are looking at\nthese things in a very deeper way so if\nyou look of two things right there's one\nis wakefulness and the other other one\nis content that is awareness so if you\nlook of these two things as components\nof consciousness then we want to\nquantify them in both ways what is your\nwakefulness level and in addition what\nis your awareness level are you aware of\nthings you're just not moving your hands\nand opening eyes and just being that but\nyou're also having a qualitative\nexperience of certain things so you you\nwant to look at both the content as well\nas the wakefulness nowadays I think\nthat's the way the medical literature is\nevolved into looking at Consciousness as\nbut as in our uh Center that we have\nwe're trying to see whether we can\ncreate a platform where the scientists\ncan actually talk to the spiritualists\nand can have exchange of information\nbecause as you know the Eastern wisdom\nis looking at Consciousness as a\nfundamental out of which the matter\ncomes whereas the Western wisdom is\nbrain is the source of Consciousness so\ntrying to find what are the\ncommonalities or these just a definition\nproblem can we de little deeper and why\nis there a lot of confusion about this\nso that is why we use some tools like\nresearch education and Outreach to\nexplain this a little bit better so can\nyou explain to us kind of the general\nrationale behind the Eastern versus\nWestern so in the west we believe or not\nwe believe so there are some like\nbiological reductionists who believe\nthat Consciousness is simply a\nphenomenon that arises out of like\nneurons and and chemical reactions and\naction potentials can you talk us\nthrough that view a little bit right so\num the there is a you know you have\nbillions of neurons and then the there\nis experience that happens so these are\ntwo extremes right so you have stimuli\nthat comes up sensory stimuli that comes\nup to the brain brain kind of processes\nit and then gives that as an experience\nso that is the fundamental way we still\ndon't know how this stimuli becomes goes\nto the neurons and then becomes an\nexperience afterwards we don't know that\npath that's what everyone is struggling\nwith and they're asking this question\nwhereas the Eastern wisdom looks at\nConsciousness as energy that is the\nfundamental of the entire existence out\nof which all matter comes you can think\nof this as you know a screen on which a\nmovie is played right when a movie is\nplayed you only look at the movie you\nreally don't look at the screen so\npeople don't know that the fundamental\num thing in the universe is\nconsciousness so that is there well in\nthat you can explain the Sleep States\nthe dream states and the wakeful states\nwhereas in Western literature you have\nassociations okay during sleep something\nhappens and that's why they go to sleep\nthere's a dial Rhythm Etc they're trying\nto produce something of the nature but\nwe are not able to explain all these\nthree in a Continuum like the Eastern\nwisdom and they don't consider\nConsciousness as energy they think of\nthat as wakefulness and awareness as a\ncombination okay so so uh\nlet\nme kind of ask a couple questions so my\nunderstanding is that that like\nConsciousness you know the argument for\nConsciousness as a downstream effect of\nbiology right it is like we can just\nlook at things like anesthesia so if we\nlook at causal\nmechanisms I can make a change to your\nneurons which will induce a change to\nyour Consciousness correct right so so\nisn't that very very strong evidence\nthat Consciousness is created by\nneurons right so now you look at um for\nexample my spiritual Master says I think\nit's the best example I can't really\nimprovise that if you use a telescope to\nlook at the universe right you can't\ncall the telescope itself as a\nuniverse right but you definitely need\nthe telescope to visualize the universe\nso that is where the confusion comes you\nneed the brain to have the perception in\norder to actually experience the deeper\nConsciousness so for example our medical\nway of looking at it cannot explain the\ncurrent psychedelic experiences for\nexample people have this very\ndeep uh experiences which they cannot\nput in words they say that something\nbeyond what I know normally have seen it\nand they actually change everything in\ntheir lives and so that is something\nthat we don't know so I think this\nargument that brain is important to\nperceive without the brain you cannot\nreally look at that Consciousness for\nyourself like apparently human beings\nare the only ones who have been gifted\nwith this opportunity that you can\nactually experience the Consciousness\nyourself and you have this highly evall\nbrain with which you can do that but\nthat itself is not Consciousness by so\nthat is and near-death experiences\ncannot be explained you know you can't\nexplain that with just brain alone\npeople have talked about the needed\nexperiences event where they seem like\nI'm out of the body I'm actually looking\nat myself and now people are actually\nshowing EG recordings after so-called\nmedical death so these are all things\nthat are not explainable by medical uh\ndefinitions as of now I I thought that\nthere are studies that have done\nstimulations of the temporoparietal\njunction and basically induced outof po\nexperiences so that that is the\nexplanatory pathway but still their\nexperience of something out outside the\nbody if you're if you're experiencing\nsomething outside the body what is the\nexplanation I don't know you can explain\nout of body experiences but what is that\nexperience you're seeing something\nbeyond your mind and body itself and\nthat is something is it Just an Illusion\nbut it's just repetitively being spoken\nby many people in disease States and\ninjury States and whatever so I'm not\nsure whether the temporo parital\nstimulation itself is able to explain\neverything that people are experiencing\nso would you say that we have scientific\nexper uh scientific evidence of the\nexistence of subjective\nexperience no so that's another issue\nthat this the circular issue that we are\nall doing medical experiments in an\nobjective way we want an objective way\nimportantly because we want to avoid\nbiases we want don't want to have any\nsubjective influences Etc but then let's\nsay that we finished that experiment\nthen we take it back to the patients and\nthen ask for their subjective\nexperiences now here we have thousands\nof people who have this Observer\nobserved\nexperiences maybe even sometimes you\ntake a large pool of meditators\ndescribing the same thing about unity\nand Etc but we still don't want to\nbelieve it because that's not a\nscientist way of looking at it that's\nnot a subject that's not an objective\nexperience there's no way to measure\nthat we don't have tools for that right\nnow so that's where we struggle and so\nit remains as a subjective experience\nmy argument is if about millions of\npeople say the same thing they can't be\nconing something it has to be you know\nit has to be explained yeah so do you\nthink I mean so what's your kind of take\nlike so let's assume for a moment that\nan outof body experience is essentially\nlike a hallucination in the brain like\nwhat's your take on something like that\nso that like let's say our our neurons\nget wired and trigger in some ways that\ntrigger a perception right so we have\nsome evidence and I'm curious maybe\nmaybe you kind of disagree with some of\nthese premises um but like you know so\nwe have evidence of things like\nhallucinations so these are sensory\nexperiences that are not grounded in an\nobjective reality but are somehow\ncreated in the\nbrain yeah I I I don't think I know\nenough to talk about these specific\npsychiatric um components so I'll stay\naway from that yeah that's not my\nexpertise either but I'm sure that um\nthere is some correlation between that's\nwhy I think we had a recent conference\nwhere one of the physicist talks about\nvarious Dimensions so we have physical\ndimensions but the mental Dimension\nseems to have many many things that we\nneed to explain and we can't just ignore\nthem as non-existent but you have to\nstart explaining he comes up with\nsomething like 11 universes or something\nlike that and I can't go into things\nthat I do not know but it seems like\nthey are explainable in his physical\ntheories and you can look him up it's\nBernard Carr he just recently spoke\nabout that but I don't know enough to\ntalk about that so when you say the\nnonphysical dimension that sounds super\nwoooo can you explain what that means\nright yeah so um for me I can only talk\nabout my experience right and I can only\nground it on that so for example after I\nstarted this journey of going through\nmeditations Etc so there are times where\nyou are actually for a lack of a better\num you're flying on someone else's\nenergies here it's the spiritual\nMaster's energies so let's say you're\nsitting in a Meditation Retreat and\nyou're going through these processes and\nsuddenly you are in a non-physical\nDimension you're actually literally uh\nyou know losing your orientation\nto the time and space you're out of it\ncompletely but you're still there you're\nexisting and sometimes you even go\nbeyond that phase of being ruled by your\nmemory and you're actually there there\nnot in infuenced by any memory or\nimagination these are not things that I\nlive in on a daily basis but these are\nthings that definitely happen to a\nnumber of meditators these are\nnon-physical Dimensions that people\nactually experience and go through so I\nI really don't know what explanations we\ncan give for all those but if you go to\nthe Eastern wisdom and look at the\nstates they talk about one of the states\nthey talk about is the state in which we\nare not influenced by memory or\nimagination then it's called the St\nState or the T State whichever you can\ncall it as a t tool and you can actually\nexperience or explain some of these\nnon-physical experiences that we have\nsomething that is not influenced by\nmemory or imagination So when you say\nyou can explain some of these\nnon-physical experiences can you give us\nan example of of non-physical like what\nwhat do you mean by that like which even\neven if even for example right you when\nI sit through meditation once I lose my\nbodily per ction right I still know that\nI exist what is that state I know that I\nexist but I don't have a distinctly I\ndon't have lose my physical body and I\nlose complete orientation to where I am\nin terms of time right one minute can uh\nis for example one day can look like a\nminute to you and I don't know how these\nthings happen as for me that is a\nnon-physical experience okay so let me\nsee if I kind of understand this or\nmaybe this is kind of my understanding\nand and you let me know if this feels um\nyou know legit to you or if there's\nnuances you want to add or disagree or\nwhatever so so here's how I'm kind of\ninterpreting what you're saying and I\nthink it's pretty consistent with my\nunderstanding of things um so the first\nis that when we look at\nexistance we have a dimension of\nphysicality we have things that are\ntangible these are things like neurons\nthese are things like objects these are\nthings that can be touched observed Etc\nbut then if we look at\nexistence there is also a layer to\nexistence and I think we people use the\nword Dimension that is\nnon-tangible right so this is not even\nenergy this\nis the qualitative phenomenon of\nexperiencing stuff MH so I can like eat\na bite of a strawberry this\ntriggers my gustatory receptors in my\ntongue these travel to the thalamus via\nmy maybe my hypoglossal nerve I it's a\nmotor nerve but whatever you've got some\nsensory nerve right that goes somewhere\ninto the thalamus that goes to some\ngustatory cortex and somewhere in that\nI've I've put a physical substance on my\ntongue and I can follow the chain of\nneurons and I can look at this and I can\nsay look at all these neurons lighting\nup we know how this works right but I\nthink you kind of alluded to this the\nbasic problem with this theory is that\nhow do we know which part of the brain\nexper erences things like fear and\nanxiety at the end of the day the only\nway we know that the amydala is where we\nexperience fear we can look at an fmri\nstudy we can look at an EEG and those\nstudies objectively what they show is\nsimply blood flow in the brain they show\nelectrical activity this does not mean\nfear how do we know that the amydala is\nwhere fear happens we have to at the end\nof the experiment go to someone and ask\nthem what were you subjectively\nexperiencing so we can't in Western\nscience measure fear all we can do is\nmeasure blood flow and that blood flow\nin this part of the brain correlates\nwith a subjective experience of fear so\nwe actually have no evidence of the\nsubjective experience of fear we just\nknow that these things are correlated\nand sometimes causitive right because\nwhat I can also do is trigger something\nin the brain through something like\nanesthesia and I can induce a and\nexperience of Consciousness is that fair\nyeah that's absolutely in line with what\nI'm thinking so far yeah okay so then\nthe basic problem is that like here's\nwhat I kind of how I understand some of\nwhat you're talking about just based on\nmy own explorations of spirituality and\nNeuroscience and clinical work like so\nI'm a psychiatrist and I do a lot of\nclinical work but um is that so if we\nlook at like the non-physical dimension\nof experience we can't measure that we\ndon't even know that it objectively\nexists we have no proof that people\nexperience things it's just a shared\ndelusion amongst all human beings\nbecause we have no scientific evidence\nof subjective experience right we can\nlook at tissue we can look at electrical\nactivity we can look at blood flow and\nso what I'm kind of hearing you say is\nthat or here's not maybe this is not\nwhat you're saying but what I'm kind of\ncurious about is like or this what my\nbelief is that if we look at scientific\nexploration scientific exploration has\nbeen in the\ndirection of the physical world so the\ninstrumentation that we have developed\ndoes not explore the realm of subjective\nexperience it explores the realm of\nphysical material and maybe energy to\nsome extent now but and\nso is this kind of like would you kind\nof agree with that absolutely yeah so\nfar all we can do is the footprints of\nwhatever the Consciousness is like\nKristoff Co who is a leading\nneuroscientist even gave up he said\nlet's just forget about the eastern\nwisdom Etc let's just follow the\nfootprints and see where the changes are\nand go from there right so that's what\nthey they're doing and their theory of\nintegrated information Theory Etc trying\nto explain what Consciousness is is the\nlatest that seems to be the most closest\nto what the Eastern world is describing\nso so can you tell us so you use this\nthis uh metaphor of footprint so help us\nunderstand what you mean by that see for\nexample um you just explained measuring\nfear and where are the correlates the\nneural correlates for example so\nsimilarly other thoughts and perceptions\nlooking at fmri or you know using a\nhighdensity EG and seeing TSO lateral\nprefontal Contex seems to be modulating\nthe thalamus Etc so those are all the\nfootprints of what is happening but so\nfar we have not been able to for example\nSteven Lis from um jiga conscious lab\nLab in Belgium talks about there's an\ninternal awareness uh circuit and\nthere's an external awareness circuit\nexternal awareness as in when your\nsensory system is directed to the\noutside world now you have the parital\nand the frontal lobe on the outside\nactually tracking that awareness or the\nneural correlates and then internal\nawareness is when you have just thoughts\nand perceptions now you have the\npecunious and the ACC the anterior\nsingulate cortex Etc lighting up in\ntheir neural Imaging so these are all\nthe footprints that we can think of\nexplaining what the Consciousness\nprocess is okay so so if I'm kind of\nunderstand understanding this like it's\nkind of similar right I think we're kind\nof saying saying the same thing but so\nwhat we can really detect is not\nConsciousness itself but the footprints\nof Consciousness correct and and now the\nquestion that I think is kind of tricky\nis that some people believe\nthat the footprints are not so if we\nkind of use the analogy of footprints\nConsciousness is the primary thing and\nit creates an effect in the physical\nworld like I walk by and I leave\nFootprints as evidence of my passage but\nthe Footprints didn't create me I\ncreated the footprints right M yes on\nthe flip side so this is kind of the\nEastern perspective which is that\nConsciousness is the main thing and\nConsciousness induces changes in the\nphysical\nworld and on the flip side we have the\nbiolog biological reductionist approach\nwhere if we start tampering with the\nfootprints if we create a footprint of a\ncertain size and shape we can induce a\nsubjective\nexperience right going I think just\ngoing from different directions one\ncoming from the source the other coming\nfrom the effect but that's why I think\nthese two people need to talk and\nliterally take away the uh definitions I\nthink sometimes we just confuse the\nwakefulness with Consciousness and\nthat's where we get lost so that's why\nit's important for these two sides to\ntalk and exchange their knowledge so so\nhelp me understand\num what uh so what's your take like like\nwhat do you think is\nreal that's a great question so I I'm\ninterested in both um to to really\nunderstand that but having experienced\nsome meditation I do think there is\nsomething that is beyond materialistic\nworld that is beyond brain that is\nbeyond the origins and what is that\nsomething so for me what matters is if\nyou think of Consciousness as the energy\nthat leads to formation of even the\nbrain you know the physical and the\nmental body that and think of then\nthat's an easier way to understand okay\nhere's the energy that's what the\nConsciousness is and that means that is\nthe pan psychism way of explaining that\neverything has to have some energy makes\na lot of sense to me and now you look of\nwakefulness and the entire brain is\nbeing responsible for what we do right\ncreating the wakefulness experience and\nalso the content of the experiences the\nsky is blue Etc then that still needs to\nbe explained based on the brain brain\nstructure and brain connectivity and\nconnectomes all that then I think we are\nin sync we are there is no controversy\nbetween the two one is looking at us the\nenergy that leads to all this and the\nother one is still responsible for\ncreating these experiences and we still\nneed to do a lot of work using the you\nknow the latest and the greatest of the\ntools and try to figure out how these\nthings are\ncreated okay so so you're sorry can I\nwas a little bit distracted I was I was\nasking some people if they want\nquestions or if they've got questions\nfor us but so can so your take is that\nso let me just repeat this right for\nexample Consciousness is the source of\nenergy you can think of this again my I\nI love what my spiritual Master says you\nhave electric bulbs but you need some\nyou need to switch on the light for it\nto glow and so there is an electricity\nthat flows you can think of\nConsciousness as that electricity that\nflows and lights up that bulb and that\nbulb you can think of that as a brain\nand now you see basically everything as\nan experience when it lights up so if\nyou think of that example Consciousness\nis a source of energy that traps both\nbody and brain in fact our Center has\nthis as our you know a logo where it\nclaps both body and brain through which\nyou actually then perceive the rest of\nthe world or yourself and the\nConsciousness at\nlarge okay um so we've got a couple\nquestion do you have any questions for\nme or anything that you wanted to\nexplain further or talk about no we can\ngo on as we build I know I might have\nsomething to you afterwards because you\ncome from the world of Psychiatry uh I\nam interested in the hallucination\nportion that you talked about how do you\nthink of hallucinations in your world\nespecially that is something that is not\nreal yeah so I I can offer an\nexplanation for that so let's like\nhere's my take\nokay so it's kind of a weird take um so\nI think that there are a couple of\ndifferent things that we can look at so\nI think one thing that is very common in\nthe Eastern tradition is this concept of\nDetachment and suffering right so in\nSanskrit this is like Vaga I I don't\nknow how familiar you are with this\nstuff but in like L right uh so there's\nthis idea that the more attached we are\nto the\nworld the more we will\nsuffer and so what does it mean to be\ndetached\nso if we look at it from a very like\nconcrete perspective we have a\nmind the more that we believe that the\nmind is correct the more we are attached\nso in cognitive behavioral uh therapy we\nhave this concept of thought Fusion so\neven in Western Psychotherapy they've\nsort of discovered this that there are\ntimes when people are mentally ill where\nthey experience something called thought\nFusion where their thoughts become\nreality right so when I'm like having a\npanic attack if you ask me do I think\nI'm going to die or am I really going to\ndie someone in a pan panic attack will\nnot say I think I'm going to die they\nwill say I am going to die mhm even\nthough this is being perceived through\nthe mind right it's a thought like no\none knows when they're going to die\nright like you can even be dying and\npeople don't know that they're dying\nlike literally like we have people who\nhave strokes and heart attacks and\nthings like that and people can have you\nknow so it's weird so so it's kind of\nweird but people so the more fused you\nare with your thoughts the more there is\nnot distance between you and your\nthought the more suffering they will\nthere will be so we can also look at\nvery practical examples so let's say I I\njust get dumped by my girlfriend and in\nthis moment I have all these kinds of\nnegative thoughts right so my lyic\nsystem is active my amydala is active I\nstart to think I'm going to be alone for\nthe rest of my life there's no one else\nin the world for me I'm you know this\nthere's no there's nothing this person\nis my life is over this person was the\nonly one that I can ever love I have all\nthese thoughts now these are just\nthoughts right they're not thoughts are\nI can think about unicorns I can think\nabout all kinds of things thoughts are\nnot real so then my friends come to me\nand they say Alo you need to take a step\nback right and if I'm able to take a\nstep back from my thoughts then I start\nto realize oh even though the reality of\nthe situation is the same I'm no longer\nin a relationship as I take a step back\nfrom my thoughts I'm able to see this\nrelationship was toxic this relationship\nwas holding me back this relation all\ngood things come to an end that's the\nNatural Evolution of things so if we\nlook at it from a very practical\nperspective when we take a step back\nfrom our thoughts we T generally\nspeaking tend to reduce our suffering\nthis is when people say let's take the\nbig picture like look at the big picture\nfor a second this isn't all bad so then\nso so if we sort of look at like the\nnature of our distance from our thoughts\nand our mental experience we can\nbasically see a\nContinuum of absolute suffering to\nAbsolute Joy so at the top is this\nconcept of MOA or Enlightenment where we\nare so detached from the world that\ndoesn't mean that we don't do anything\nit doesn't mean we're apathetic it means\nthat the distance between the world and\nour conscious experience of the world is\nlike very big so what that means is that\nI can be internally tranquil even though\neverything is falling apart around me\nright I can acknowledge this is the way\nthings are I remain objective I do not\nget caught up in things so someone who\nis who has MSHA or has attained\nEnlightenment doesn't get caught up in\nthe world they can still participate but\nthey don't get caught up in it so that's\nMoka and then we can look at some of\nthese other states of sadii right or\nsome of these transcendental States Of\nConsciousness so if we look at some of\nthese psychedelic experiences\nqualitative research on these\npsychedelic experiences show us that\npeople have a very detached view right\nso you kind of alluded to this sum where\nyou kind of talk about okay so our\nexperience of Consciousness is grounded\nin our body you sometimes so most of us\nthink that we don't have experiences of\nConsciousness without a perception of\nour body we don't have experience of\npure Consciousness but when you enter if\nyou look at the qualitative research\naround uh psychedelic experiences or\nmeditative\nexperiences what we find is that as they\nbreak apart from themselves as they\ndetach from their experience of reality\nthis is actually what's therapeutic so\nthere even some studies that show that\nwhen someone uses a psychedelic the\nnature of their psychedelic experience\nfrom a subjective level correlates with\nthe degree of therapeutic healing they\nexperience so if I just see like visions\nand stuff that doesn't correlate with\nhealing generally speaking healing\ncorrelates with ego death\nexperiences okay so I know I'm this is a\nroundabout answer so at the very top we\nhave MOA which is complete Detachment\nthen we have have even things like\npsychedelics which which will induce a\ngreater degree of Detachment from your\nbody and the world and you recognize\neverything is connected then we have\nbelow that taking the big picture when I\nfeel like I'm very very unhappy let's\ntake a big picture let's take a step\nback that's a very common experience\nthat people have and then we get to\nemotionality right so sometimes when I'm\nfeeling very emotional I feel attached\nto things and then we have things like\npanic attacks where there is very little\ndifference between my thought and the\nreality so I think my thoughts are real\nwhereas for the enlightened person they\nrecognize that the mind is just an organ\nand it's not really who I am it's the\nexact opposite then we get to psychosis\nwhich is at the absolute bottom and even\nin a panic attack someone has some\nawareness that there is thought that\nthis is not reality in psychosis we have\nzero awareness that this is thinking so\nif we look at something like someone who\nhas a delusional\ndisorder they don't don't think that\nthese are just thoughts this is their\nreality so this is a psychosis in my\nopinion is a state of pure attachment it\nis the very opposite of\nMoka um and so from a neuroscience\nperspective like I'm not quite sure how\nthis stuff works right so we know that\nthere's all kinds of challenges that\nhappen in in the brains of people with\nschizophrenia we see we generally\nspeaking I think what tends to happen is\nwe have an over abundance or imbalance\nof dopamine so if you look at like the\ndrugs of abuse that induce a lot of\ndopamine like cocaine or K2 and things\nlike that these will lead to things like\nhallucinations we give dopamine blockade\nblockers right so first generation\nsecond generation third generation anti\npsychotics and those are very effective\nat treating the positive symptoms of\npsychotic disorder so things like\nhallucinations and stuff like that so it\nseems like you know I think what's kind\nof going on is you have all these\nsignals these powerful dopam energic\nsignals which are so strong that these\nareas like the prunus and the interior\nsingulate cortex can't\nregulate so you have these certain like\nin certain parts of the brain that\ngovern our internal experience which get\ncaught up they just get overwhelmed by\nlike dopamine and I would not be I've\nnever seen a study to this but I would\nnot be surprised if we saw that people\nwho have schizophrenia have some kind of\nimpairment in their inter ior singulate\ncortex or prunus and specifically the\nconnections between their dopaminergic\ncircuits in the brain their Thalamus\ntheir assoc uh their sensory Association\ncortices something about the way that\nour ACC frontal loes and prunus control\nthose parts of the brain my guess is\nthat they're busted in some\nway does that answer your question yeah\nyeah so I just want to uh clarify myself\nto myself right couple of things one is\nyou know you talked a lot about\nDetachment and the second thing you\nbrought about was distance keeping a\ndistance between yourself and your body\nand mind that is the second big\nprinciple that you brought in there so\nuh the third one is about thoughts so I\njust want to comment on all these three\nkeeping a distance you you talked about\nall the disease States but I'm just\ntalking about normal people so-called\nnormal people running around in the\nsociety generally so if you can keep the\ndistance between what is us and what is\nours that is the mind and the body so\nthis is a very this was a very difficult\nconcept for me to understand 14 years\nago but when you take up this journey\nyou kind of get it you kind of get that\nwhat is you and what is yours that is\nmind and body when we create the\ndistance it seems like suddenly there is\na lot of insight and when you have the\ninsight and awareness and suddenly\nyou're able to deal with issues you you\nknow tackle issues on a daily basis much\nbetter so I think that is one thing\ncreating a distance and even for normal\npeople it's very important and that I\nthink is what these tools do the\nmeditation tools do the second comment I\nhad about the Detachment was uh you know\nmy I have PE kids who are 24 years old\nright so they were also debaters and\nthey asked this question well if I am\ndetached from everything why do I live\nright what is there for me to live and\nand this is like a broader question so\nthen that another layer of explanation\nhad I had to learn that to explain to\nthem it's not detachment\nbut it's actually not getting entangled\nin something for example let's say you\nplay a game of soccer you play it\nintensely right that's that's what I\nthink meditation tools talk about being\nengaged in everything you do is the\nbiggest form of meditation you do the\ngame you play the game but once the game\nis over you just put it in your back\npocket and walk you're not entangled in\nthe results so that is I think it's a\nlittle different from detachments I just\nwanted to comment even for our viewers\nthat you're not really detached you're\ncompletely engaged in everything you're\ndoing but at the end of it you're not\nattached to it anymore you're basically\nnot entangled with it and so you're not\ncontinuing to suffer from that so that\nwas something else that I wanted to\ncomment on you're going to say something\nyeah yeah so so I mean I I completely\nagree and I think there's there's just\nhuge problems with I think when we\ntranslate Sanskrit to English and we\ntalk about Detachment a lot of people\nthink that this means apathy but in my\nexperience it's actually the opposite\nwhere the more detached you become and\nyou're using the word entanglement which\nI think is a a good word to use I think\nit's a little bit clearer for people to\nunderstand but I mean the simple way\nthat I kind of put it is that you know\nlike we have a lot of gamers in our\naudience and you can be fully engaged in\nthe game and enjoy the game and then\nlike leave it I mean we have we struggle\nwith this because we're true Gamers so\nwe have trouble leaving it we get pissed\noff and stuff but you know you can play\na game like if you play a game and\nyou're not even playing to win you're\njust playing to have fun or you're\nplaying to win but you're with a bunch\nof teammates who are new you know you're\ngoing to lose and that's okay you don't\nget messed up in it but it's not like\nyou you give up just because you have a\nbunch of new people on your team like\nthe expectation is you're going to lose\nyou can still play the game with full\npassion full enjoyment and even if you\nlose you can still enjoy it right\nbecause like the the way that you\napproach the situation ultimately\ndetermines the way that you feel about\nit and this is where you kind of\ndisentangle yourself whereas if you get\nvery upset whether you win or lose then\nyou're happiness doesn't come with\nplaying it comes with the outcome of the\naction yeah the entanglement yeah the\nother the last comment I make and then\nwe can take questions is thoughts right\nyou talked about thoughts and this is\nvery important at least for my\nunderstanding and learning and this\nwhole process is you know as you know\nMahabharat is a very famous epic in\nIndia and I like the you know the D not\nthe the know Dharma character which B\nbasically udra right so he thinks that\neven if you think of something that\nmeans it's done it's real for him the\nreason is that thought if it persists\nthen it creates that imprint in your\nbrain that is neuroplasticity and then\nit'll exhibit itself at some point in\nfavorable circumstances it'll exhibit\nitself it could be you know\nmaladaptation it could be you know uh\naddiction it could be whatever right so\nthat at that he's he's attacking at that\nlevel we for example another things is\nwe don't know where the thoughts come\nfrom no one knows the another problem\nwith Consciousness where are the thought\nthey're very random but if you get stuck\nto these thoughts and then build on it\nand then you create this neuroplasticity\nand now you're ending up in whatever\nthings becoming true and exhibiting\nitself at a favorable situation so even\nto going to that level of having\nsubtleness of the brain and not even\nhaving thoughts is eventual translation\npeople talk to me about I don't have\ntime I can't stop my thoughts Etc but\nthis is a journey and as you're going\nyour mind becomes very subtle and you\nmight end up in the no thought States\nyou can invoke thoughts when you really\nneed it but that's the highest level we\nare not looking to get that right now so\nso I I think I mean I I understand the\nreferences but a lot of people don't so\nI think some people may missed that so\ncan you help us understand what you were\nsaying about explain this concept that\nudish talks about about you know like\nonce the thought happens it's done so\nyou were talking something about I I\nassume you're also alluding to like\nvasana or something like that but right\nbut can you explain that a little bit\nmore right so for example let's say that\nI I get a thought in my head oh um you\nknow let's bring the very common example\nI like this girl right or even in a very\nuh gross way that I want to sleep with\nthis girl for example right somebody\nlet's start with that and that thought\nkeeps coming again and again here and\nthere at random and you pay attention to\nthat thought now now you're giving some\npower to that thought and then now\nsuddenly it becomes a routine thing in\nyour head and it becomes a\nneuroplasticity and it's an established\ncycle in your head and it is going to\nexhibit itself or manifest in a\nfavorable circumstances whenever that\nfavorable circumstances happen so\nthought translates to this ultimate\nthing of being manifesting itself so you\nthat's why people just tell you brain is\nbrain it is producing thoughts but don't\npay attention to it it's important that\nbrain works for you and you don't work\nfor the brain so so yeah I I think we we\nstill may have lost you a little bit so\nso let let's go a little slower if\nthat's okay so I have a thought right\nand if I have a thought when you say you\ngive it power how does that work you for\nexample the same thought comes again and\nyou now indulge in the thought process\nokay right it's not just a fleeting\nthought process now you pay attention to\nit and what happens when I pay attention\nto it now it gets empowered and now\nyou're thinking about how to make it\nhappen or maybe you're thinking a little\nbit more about it okay so now yeah so so\nfirst thing is that when I have a\nthought there are two things I can do\nwith the thought right I can let it be\nfleeting in which case it disappears\nyeah or I can engage with it which gives\nit power right so what engaging looks\nlike very practically is if I have this\nthought that oh I'm worried about this\ntest on Friday and then I can start\nstudying and then the worry will go away\nor I can start thinking about the worry\nwhat should I do should I do this should\nI do this should I talk to this person\nwhat is this person going to do so these\nare all thoughts that are born from the\noriginal thought which is I assume what\nyou mean by engagement correct now you\ntossed out this word neuroplasticity how\ndoes neuroplasticity enter into this\npicture so for example if this comes\nrepeatedly in your head right like today\nyou have empowered it so it is\ndefinitely going to come again so you're\nempowering the again and now over a\nperiod of time you have now developed\nthis uh you know image in your brain you\ncan call it as you know connectomes that\ncertain parts of the brain are creating\nthis cycle and now it becomes a memory\nand now that is called the\nneuroplasticity and suddenly it has\nbecome from a thought to a fullblown\nfull neuroplasticity in your head that\nmeans that there's a memory in your head\nand it is going to be much stronger than\na fleeting thought that it was a few\ndays ago yeah so we see that clinically\nall the time right so what happens I\nthink what you're referring to is that\nanytime I engage with a thought there's\nthe subjective realm of if I engage with\nit it'll grow if I ignore it it'll go\naway over time as I engage with it there\nare neurological changes and as I get\ninto a habit of thinking my neurons will\nwire in a certain way where if I start\nthe thought process all of the habitual\nneuron neuronal chain will happen and\nand so every time I engage with a\nthought neuroplasticity means the\ntendency for the brain to change right\nso that means that the brain is wiring\nharder in a particular way and this is\nnothing special this is just the same\nway we learn skills and the way that we\ndevelop habits right so the more I\npractice the piano the more that that\ngets habituated and the easier it is for\nme to play in the same way that I'm\npracticing the piano and it becomes more\nautomatic if I practice a particular\nchain of thinking\nthat will become automatic and will be a\nhabit and even if the chain of thinking\nis harmful to us or causes Suffering The\nMore We engage with it the more the more\ncommon it'll become and we also see this\nfrom from situations like addiction and\nthings like that where like all you need\nto do to induce Cravings even if you\nhave if you have a very common chain of\ncausation with addiction all you need to\ndo is see drug related paraphernalia and\nit'll trigger the whole thing like if\nyou even see like some kind of you know\nsomeone who has a cigarette or something\nlike that or you see a cigarette butt on\nthe ground or you see someone smoking in\na like all you need is the first start\nto trigger this chain of causation in\nyour brain and then the craving will\ncome on like full blast yeah so for\nexample snacking right let's say that\nfive days you snack at 4M and on the\nsixth day 4M comes you're automatically\nlooking for a snack it's not a conscious\naction so that's why another thing that\nis being taught to us is is take every\naction consciously practice towards that\nthat is what mindfulness is but\nbasically you're trying to become a\nconscious person that means you're not\nbeing driven by an automatic uh process\nof you've trained something there's some\nmemory in your brain there's a\nneuroplasticity and you're being driven\nto that for example young ad adolescents\nthey think about oh I'm not that good oh\nI'm going to fail in this test I'm I'm\njust you know that person is better than\nme all that suddenly that just becomes\nvery established in your head and you\nwill be what your thought process is and\nyou'll start manifesting that so that's\nwhy it's very important\nto treat the thoughts as thoughts itself\nI'm trying to tie this to Consciousness\nso you might know jidu Krishna morti and\njid krishn morti is a pure intellect and\nfor people uh he had interacted with\nDavid B who is a friend of Albert\nEinstein and they were in the same\nphysics lab and they've had these\ndiscussions 100 years ago I think these\nare very relevant even now he talks\nabout you cannot solve the problem with\njust thoughts you have to just sit down\nand have an insight to it don't try to\nthink of a solution to a problem just\nsit with it and then create that Insight\nonce you have the complete insight into\nit Solutions will come and that Insight\nseems like a larger you know it's not\njust coming out of your brain it seems\nlike a invoking a little bit more than\nourside your brain if you start\nbelieving in the connectedness which we\nhave had you know how do you connect\nyourself to the trees outside and\nOneness with others Etc so that's why I\nthink the collective Consciousness plays\nan important role okay so we'll get to\nthat in in a second um can you tell us\nso what do you think about free\nwill yeah that's that's a great question\nso we've had a conversation with um\nSteph Pinker and uh you know him is a a\nvery thoughtful person and suppose we\ngreatest thinker right now and he had a\nconversation at the Sanders Theater last\nOctober you you know that he has written\nthis book called blank slate right and\nwhere basically he says is you come with\ncertain things in you you're not a blank\nslate when you're born you have genetics\nyou calls about 40% of things are\ngenetics and there is unknown for\nremaining as unknown he says that\nunknown but the Eastern World calls it\nas compulsive Behavior or wasas or\nwhatever you can call that you're born\nwith and now when you come with these\ncompulsive behaviors unless you can\novercome all these uh you know elements\nyou're going to be an automatic person\nyou know you'll be driven by your\nTendencies rather than you doing a free\nwill so how can you can get to a free\nwill but in order to do that you have to\nbecome a conscious person first now you\nhave to take every action consciously\nand when you transcend that perhaps then\nyou can have a free will in everything\nyou do okay so what do you think about\nso there are some people who are\nbiological reductionists who don't\nbelieve Free Will right so and I think\ntheir argument is so once again if we\nlook at like the brain we know that for\nexample genetics can influence the way\nthat we think we know that experiences\ncan influence the way that we think and\neven our subjective\nperception of Free Will may just be\nneurons firing in a particular way that\nmakes us think we have free will and\nthere are some study that even sort of\nsupport this so if you look at things\nlike advertising and and someone buys\nlet's say like a packet of cookies and\nthen you ask the person why did you buy\nthe packet of cookies and they'll say I\nbought the packet of cookies because I\nknow that my roommate really likes them\nand I thought I'd do something nice for\nthem but what you can literally do is\ninfluence all kinds of things like where\nyou place the cookies what the packaging\nis that will shape people's behavior so\na lot of people will have and there are\neven certain things that you can do to\num you can stimulate some regions of the\nbrain that will result in people\nbelieving that they are acting out of\nfree will but they're it appears that\nlike they're not so how do you\nunderstand those kinds of\narguments right so one is you know\nobviously advertisers have done their\njob and they know that the these people\nwill fall for it so they have looked at\nthe patterns and behaviors in a set of\npeople to produce that business uh\ntactics but when you look at memory\nitself right there is um know my\nunderstanding after reading this books\nis there's an elemental memory with\nwhich the world is made the five\nelements and then you there's an\nevolutionary memory with which you are\nevolving from you know the smallest\namiba to what you are currently all that\nis imprinted in you and there it goes on\nand on there's an atomic memory then\nthere's an articulate memory and there's\nan articulate memory so there's so many\nlevels of memory that we have we don't\neven perceive that that is driving a lot\nof decision making within us and unless\nwe become conscious person or human\nbeing we will not be able to change all\nthat automaticity that is imprinted in\nus so that's where in a way it looks\nlike yes we are we we blessed with this\nability to actually have a free will if\nyou become that conscious person or if\nyou become that realized being but it's\nalso that difficult to get rid of all\nthese memories and then you know have\nthis Free Will within you so that's what\nI think about this you know there a\ncertain set of people will go and buy\ncertain set of things another set of\npeople will buy another set of things\nbut they're all driven by these layers\nand layers of memory that is embedded in\nus there's a there's a researcher from\nbe u a neurologist Andrew bson I think\nhe has actually written you know an\narticle recently about how he calls\nConsciousness as memory I think that's\nvery important that's basically what\nmemory is even though you know\nConsciousness is a little different than\nwhat he's talking about but if you take\naway that memory if you pull out all\nthis memory you don't exist so he's\nsitting on something that's very\nimportant and uh yeah sorry you were\nsaying something yeah so so I mean I I I\nI'm I'm with you from like a practical\nyogic kind of perspective right so that\nwe have automatic things we have the\nperception of free will we can start\nbehaving consciously like that stuff I I\ncould totally get from the Eastern side\nbut even in those cases how do we know\nthat there is some kind of free will or\nConsciousness like how do we know that\neven our perception of free will or\nConsciousness is not memory determined\nby our our cells our genetics neurons\nfiring right so like we can't so neurons\nthat have action potentials these are\nlike finite physical things and when\nneurons have action potentials this\ncreates fear and when people are afraid\nthere's all kinds of predictive science\nthat we have like median income can be\npredicted by your ZIP\ncode so so what's your take on people\nwho believe that there is no such thing\nas free will so that this concept is\nactually an illusion that is born of\nreductions to neurons firing in the\nbrain and even the moment let's say I I\nwake up and I say today I'm not going to\ndrink alcohol you could say okay I have\na perception of free will but literally\nwhat's happening in my brain is certain\nneurons are firing when I have a\nperception of Free Will and I don't\ncontrol those neurons I don't control\nthe action potentials I don't control\nthe sodium flow or the potassium flow or\nanything like that right so even like\nthe subjective experience of free will\ncan be tracked back to neurons in the\nbrain that are firing which we don't\nreally\ncontrol to my take on this if you're\njust asking my take on that's what we're\nasking yeah I think it's possible to\nhave a free will not 24 by seven but at\nleast in some parts of the time for\nexample you know maybe 20% of the time\nin a given day I can at least do these\nactions consciously but can I get all\n100% it's possible but it's not that\neasy you'll have to travel that path you\ncan get there but majority of this\nmajority of us are not having a free\nwill most of the time so I'm curious\nwhat did you what how do you understand\nmy\nquestion so your question is what is\nyour take on the Free Will itself okay\nfrom my point of view so I I feel like\nyes it is possible but it's just not uh\n100% of the time or it's not possible in\n100% of us so just to to kind of clarify\nso it's your take that people who\nbelieve that Free Will is all of our\nactions are basically can be tracked\nback to neurons and neurons are this is\nthis I'm not representing your view I'm\njust trying to clarify what I'm saying\nand then I'll clarify with what I\nunderstand your response to be so if we\nlook at like let's say on a given day I\ndecide okay I'm going to eat a salad or\nI'm going to eat a sandwich so in this\nmoment right so you're referring to an\nautomaticity so if I don't pay attention\nto myself I will eat whatever\nautomatically this is Vasa this is\nmental habit my neurons have been wired\nin a certain way we have this experience\nof Consciousness or free will that when\nwe gain awareness of this moment we\ncan push things in a particular\ndirection right right we can be\ntemporarily we can experience free will\nso there is an argument that even in\nthat moment when you are temporarily\nexpressing Free Will where is this Free\nWill Free Will originating from it can\nbe tracked back to action potentials in\nthe brain so in this moment where I\nrestrain an Impulse my frontal loes are\nfiring in a particular way are\novercoming the amydala or overcoming the\nnucleus accumbent that even in this\nperception of free will the reason I can\nexert Free Will in that moment is\nbecause my frontal loes their Action\npotentials fire in a particular way that\novercomes sou some impulses of the brain\nright and if that's the case some people\nbelieve that there is no such thing as\nfree will there are just the days where\nthe action potentials happen in your\nfrontal loes which even frontal loes can\nbe determined you know that and so does\nthat kind of make sense that's sort of\nmy question is what do you think about\nthat perspective right so do you think\nthat the frontal of firing preds your uh\nthought as such because if it is\nhappening something simultaneously that\nmeans you are exerting Free Will which\nis leading to the firing of the frontal\nlob and then that is controlling the\nlower level you know whatever thalamic\nand hypothalamic Etc so then there is a\nfree will right then you are exerting\nthat on those uh subservient loes so so\nsure but but in in this in in this\nexample and this is this is where this\nisn't my view I'm just I'm trying to\nrepresent a view as best as I understand\nso in that moment when you are quote\nunquote obser exerting free will that is\nliterally just some other corner of your\nbrain that has neurons that are\nactivating right so when\nI when I restrain an Impulse we know\nthat there is a frontal lobe suppression\nof let's say the nucleus succumbent so I\ndon't I don't play a video game or I\ndon't eat an additional cookie or\nsomething like that we know that some\ncircuits of the brain control other\ncircuits of the brain and so even then\nbut what determines the action of the\nfrontal lobe that may not be controlled\nthat there's that's just a it's all\nneurons at the end right so all human\nbehavior can be tracked back to neurons\nthe moments that we fail the moments\nthat we\nsucceed right yeah so I I still think\nthat there is something more than the\nbrain there's something more than you\nand you as you and that you is probably\nthe one who can control how the frontal\nlobe actually acts\nbecause we human beings have evolved and\nwe have this larger cerebral cardex and\nfrontal lobe Etc we are the ones who can\nactually decide what is our upper limit\nof experience and what is our upper\nlimit of control and what is our upper\nlimit of free will all all of that so\nnow I cannot help but think that that\nyou which is not just confined to your\nbody is the one that is exerting this\nactivity on the frontal L and then\ncontrolling subsequently and I think\nthat is freeo okay so so so there is\nsomething that goes beyond biology so\nit's not neurons at the bottom there is\nsome non neuronal nonphysical component\nthat can exert some kind of influence on\nthe physical world right that's a filter\nTheory Of Consciousness where your brain\nis actually\nfiltering whatever the higher you know\nthe flow of energy as and then it\nshowing whatever the world has\nexperiences has okay yeah I think is\nat least based on my experience I think\nit's true yeah so so that that that's\nthank you so much for sharing that I\nthink that's what we're curious about\nright so some people believe in the\nexistence of non-physical things that\ncan affect the physical world correct\nare you open to sharing with us how you\ncame to that\nbelief uh let's talk and let me see if\nthere's any good example that I can\nshare with rather than just okay sure\nabout something okay um so\nuh I I can I mean I can offer my take I\nagree with you and and if it would be\neasier I can share mine but yeah I don't\nyou do that yet share so so I I I think\nit comes back to this non-physical\nDimension so I think for a lot so we\nhave no scientific existence of the\nproof of thought we have no sorry\nscientific proof of the existence of\nthought right so this whole subjective\nrealm has been un touched by\nscience cuz we've gone down the physical\nroute we have not gone through the\nexperiential route and we can still\napply the scientific method to the\nexperiential route which is what I think\nthe yogis did so they weren't concerned\nabout neurons and things like that they\njust in the same way that like the\ndirection so so if we start in the\nmiddle western science has moved towards\nthe material world and there were a lot\nof things that if we take a purely\nmaterialistic view there are a lot of\nthings that took took us a lot of time\nto figure out like the existence of\nenergy we also discovered a couple of\nother really interesting things like um\nso there's this great book called in\nsearch of Schrodinger's Cat and at the\nvery end there's a beautiful analogy\nabout the nature of the reality of the\nuniverse now I'm not a Quantum physicist\nI think there's a lot of quantum\nmysticism BS out there I don't I I don't\nmuch like yourself I don't comment on\nthe quantum because I don't know the\nquantum and let the people who talk\nabout the quantum talk about the quantum\nall right so some people will say like\nConsciousness is in the quantum maybe it\nis who knows so I think they have a\nreally great analogy of like so if I if\nI show you a block of wood and I\nsay Dr Superion your face is inside the\nblock of wood and you say that's crazy\nhow can that be and then I chisel the\nwood in a particular way and sure enough\nthere is your face with your beautiful\nbeard and everything involved right so\nthe way that I look at\nreality forms the reality that I see so\nwe can look at this in things like I I\nand this is something that I think is\npretty factual I think I'm On Solid\nGround here if we look at something like\nthe particle wave duality of light is\nparticle a wave I mean is light a wave\nis light a particle it's both are these\nthings both the same thing no it's just\nsome weird physics stuff that I don't\nquite get but I know that what we detect\nis influenced by how we look so I think\nwhat basically happened is in Western\nscience we went down the material route\nand so you can go down the material\nroute as long as you want to but unless\nyou are looking\nfor the non-material realm you're never\ngoing to find it right so we have we\nhave to have the right like you can't\nuse a telescope to detect the weight of\nan object there are two there are\ndifferent kinds of instruments that\nmeasure fundamentally different\nqualities and the biology is really\ngreat at measuring the biology but as we\nboth sort of know right and like I've\nasked literally like probably at this\npoint 30 or 40 psychiatrists\nneuroscientists all kinds of people\nneurologists about hey do we have any\nproof of thought and no one has been\nable to give me convincing proof so we\nare all operating under a shared\ndelusion of thoughts which are not\nMaterial which cannot be measured by\nanything so how do we even know they\nexist because no physical evidence\nexists and that's because we're trying\nto use a telescope to measure the weight\nof an object the it's just different\ninstruments and so my take is that if\nyou look at the yogis what the yogis did\nthey didn't go down the material Road\nthey went the other way so a yogi does\nnot know about the existence of a neuron\nthe yogi doesn't know what a frontal\nlobe is they have very powerful frontal\nlobes but they have no idea like what\nthe different lobes of the brain are and\nif you ask a yogi like what is your\nfrontal lobe they don't know so they\nexplored in a different direction and\nand Neuroscience currently is going in a\ndifferent direction I think that's where\nyou allude to like you know having these\npeople talk cuz I think that'll be\nproductive and so I I think that\nbasically the the place in which we will\nfind evidence of Free Will is not in the\nmaterial world because Free Will is not\na material\nthing the experience of Free Will and\nall of our information about Free Will\ndoes not come from the material world\ndoesn't come from neurons it comes from\nsubjective experience and so if we want\nproof of Free Will that's the direction\nwe need to\nexplore I agree 100% I agree I'm with\nyou on that I think think we on the same\npage but I was just looking for an\nexperience that might have changed your\nviews on you know something other than\nyourself that is powerful enough to\ninfluence you so that's yeah we'll come\nback to that so let's see whether there\nare any questions yeah so um well let's\nopen things up to questions I I know\nthere's been like a bazillion questions\nand I haven't been able to keep up let\nme see if okay oh oh great we've got\nthem so thank you so much techer we have\nhave a moderator um is consciousness\nsomething we control or is it just there\nand controls\nare just Illusions or\nperception so from my take is\nconsciousness is fundamental to the\nuniverse we talked about this I think\nit's beyond the brain and so it is just\nthere okay so so do we so if I can kind\nof try to piggy back off of that\nanswer Consciousness is a unit of\nexistence so it's almost like asking um\ndo we control matter do we control\nenergy like ious is one of the three\nlayers of existence and it can manifest\nin all kinds of different ways correct\nso we are in in the Consciousness we can\ncall that we are um generating all our\nexperiences with the Consciousness and\nwe seeing all the experiences through\nthe Consciousness and so it's all there\nwe are in it so I don't think we can\nmanipulate that it's a fundamental thing\nokay um so what happens to our\nConsciousness when our brain is still\nalive but has no brainwave activity I\ndon't know if that question makes sense\nright so we talked about the telescope\nexperience right so we can address that\nwith that so if the brain is not for\nexample if you're anesthetized\nConsciousness is still there but you\ncan't experience it because now that\nmater that organ through which you would\nhave perceived the Consciousness is\nabsent so for you Consciousness doesn't\nexist but there is consciousness\neverywhere but for you that experiencing\nthat is not not happening because your\nbrain is shut down by anesthesia or shut\ndown by injury or whatever so that's all\nso so something just clicked for me so\nyou're saying the brain is the organ of\nperception that we have for\nConsciousness right so the way to\nunderstand that is not that it's created\nby this is fascinating so I I think I\njust hit on something so when someone\nsays okay like if I if I screw up the\nbrain then people won't then\nConsciousness gets destroyed\nbut your take is that I can close my\neyes and it doesn't make the world\ndisappear that the world exists it is\njust my ability to perceive it that has\nbeen impaired so the brain is not a\ncreative organ it is a sensory organ\ncorrect okay that's very interesting\nit's a tool through which you perceive\nit okay so it's a tool to perceive which\nexplains why you know if I tamper with\nmy eyes if I cover my eyes with a blind\nblindfold or if I close my eyes then I\nstop perceiving the world it doesn't\nmean that my eyes create the world it\njust means that is my organ of\nperception\ncorrect and then I guess it would make\nsense that if I make changes to my eyes\nmy I would see the world in different\nways right so right everybody sees it\ndifferently because they're all having\nthis tool a little different even though\nthe basic units are the same but you\nhave it wired differently and so the\nperceptions are different okay\num you doing okay can we go for a little\nbit longer\nthis this is fantastic I'm loving this I\nand and so thankfully we have a\ncommunity that is very technical so like\nwe tend to not try to dumb things down\nand sometimes people get left behind and\nwe're okay with that because I think the\npeople who are really interested in this\nstuff we have a lot of people in our\ncommunity who are super into\nneuroscience and super into uh\nspirituality so is consciousness a\nunique Human Experience or is there a\nspectrum that includes all\norganisms yeah so I think based on both\nthe Eastern wisdom and also the Western\nwisdom I think it's there in everybody\njust the content we talked about the\nawareness element if you have this XY\naxis the y axis is awareness and the\nx-axis is the wakefulness piece that\nawareness piece the richness of the\ncontent is going to vary right um\nthere's a beautiful mathematician uh\nHoffman I think from UCI who's talking\nabout conscious agents Theory and then\nwe are also having this integrated\ninformation Theory they all talk about\nnon-reducible pieces they're all there\nwhen they all come together when you\nhave more of it the richness of the\nexperience varies so everybody has some\nof it and as we keep evolving or as we\nkept evolving we have become very\ncomplex and our ability to experience\nthis has become much richer okay so so\nif we were to kind of go back to this\nconcept of brain as a perception organ\nfor Consciousness as the brain evolves\nthe richness of the Consciousness that\nwe can perceive evolves with it correct\nso I think in the Eastern says the same\nright so I think we have a lot of texts\nthat say that basically if you look at\nsomething like a clam the nature of its\nConsciousness is determined by its\nperceptual ability so not by its\nintellect but as it is able to perceive\nmore things and there are even some if\nyou really look at a lot of this Eastern\nphilosophy they say that even rocks will\nhave Consciousness the problem though is\nthat rocks have basically zero\nperceptual ability so their experience\nof Consciousness they basically are\nblindfolded the whole time so they can't\nreally see the world but they have some\nability they have some\nfundamental experience which is still\nthere right so another thing that I\nwanted to bring about is the um you know\nthere's a fascinating way I've not\nunderstood this from the Neuroscience\nview but fascinating way how everything\nbehaves is you know you have memory and\nthen you have identity and then you have\nintellect then you have intelligence so\nthese are let's say four parts of the\nmind which the yogic descriptions\nactually talks about the identity that\nyou take is the most important that is\ngoing to decide your experiences how\nyour intellect is going to act and\ntowards that memory will serve\neverything all your memory is going to\nserve based on the identity you've taken\nso all your experiences is very much\ndriven by the identity that you've taken\nand so you talked about intelligence\nright so a little bit there if you can\ntouch that pure intelligence and not\nhaving all these influences then you are\nhaving the deepest experiences that\npsychedelic people talk about or the\nmeditation people talk about that leads\nto transformation so um there are two\nreasons I'm bringing them here at this\ncontext because the ability for us to\nexperience things are very different\nbased on the identity that we have taken\nthis is how the brain or the mind works\nand we are striving towards touching\nthat pure intelligence which is very\nprofound what's the difference between\nintelligence and intellect right so\nintellect is something that you know\nagain this is not based on Neuroscience\nbut this is based on the yogic\ndescriptions is let's say that your\nability to discriminate between good and\nbad you know you're you know white and\nblack and things like that it's very\nsharp instrument can call that and\nthat's what sguru describes and\nbasically he talks about these things is\nability to discriminate between two\nthings you know the two polarities\nbecause intelligence is the Basic Energy\nthat we talked about of the\nConsciousness which is basically leading\nto formation of the mind and the body\nand everything else which is in the\nmatter that source of you can call that\nas a creator of the source of creation\nwhatever that is the intelligence and if\nyou can access that then you can\nprobably see what is truth and when you\nsee even the semblances of Truth\nsuddenly the place from which you\noperate from changes you ask me about\nwhat led me those conclusions\nwhere I was operating from earlier on in\nmy life in my academic career compared\nto where I'm operating from is very\ndifferent and so now I'm not driven by\njealousy and Etc all the negative\nemotions I'm only driven by experiencing\nlife and life as such and I'm not\nlooking for a meaning and purpose etc\netc okay so uh maybe I can kind of\nclarify because I I think you know\nthere's there's maybe just a some people\nmay have been a little bit like left\nbehind so if we kind of look at the E\nyogic system and I I don't know if this\nis if I'm mapping on to what you're\nyou're kind of saying but my\nunderstanding of it is when you use the\nword intelligence there's this Sanskrit\nword mahat which is Cosmic intelligence\nis the best way to describe it so if you\nlook at\nlike the universe there are certain\naspects of like order and the way that\nthe yogis interpreted things like\ngravity and you know the different kinds\nof nuclear forces and stuff like that is\nthat if you think about it there's a\ncertain order to it and they kind of\nequated that almost with intelligence\nthis is where things get a little bit\ntechnical or like you really have to\nunderstand it but and so I think what\nyou're kind of referring to is\nintelligence is on a more Cosmic scale\nright so there is like some raw like\nintelligence and then we also have this\nconcept that there's something called\nneon which is understanding which J\nKrishna talks about as Insight which is\nkind of like even if you're studying\nsomething right like there's this\nexperience of you can study something\nlike let's say I'm studying a textbook\non neuroscience and I'm reading all this\nstuff and I don't get it I don't get it\nI don't get it I don't get it so the\ninformation is there right and the\ndifference is that something has to\nclick and that's the yogis what they\nkind of concluded I'm assuming they all\nconcluded the same thing the stuff that\nI've read that I think makes the most\nsense so what they sort of stumbled upon\nis that you can have a lot of\ninformation but there is a moment where\nyou tap tap into something that jidu\nkrishn morti calls Insight we all\nsubjectively describe this as the light\nbulb going off in our head right where\nsomething gets connected and what the\nyogis actually did they did some cool\nexperiments where they found that the\nmore you let go of your ego and things\nlike that the the easier it is to tap\ninto those insights correct and and so\nthe the real source of knowledge if you\nreally pay attention I know this sounds\nreally bizarre but the there's in the\noutside world but the understanding and\nthe knowledge always comes from within\nand even if you read some external text\nit will trigger a understanding and then\nthat understanding lives within you so I\nI know I know it's kind of a bold claim\nbut if I I'm this has been my experience\nwhen I studied it so I read this stuff\nand then I went through this and I\nrealized oh like all understanding\nreally does come from within I can read\na bunch of textbooks but then some there\nhas to be an internal component that\ntriggers and then as we meditate and as\nwe do spiritual exper we start\ntriggering more and more insights and\nthen sometimes we even get to the point\nof when we sort of talk about these\nthings like\nSidis where people are able to have\ninsights that do not seem to be possible\ngiven the information that they receive\nright and and that's something that we\nkind of call like a transcend during\nthis conversation you suddenly said aha\nI really understand the word telescope\nand what you meant by that so that I\nthink you just getting to that level\nabsolutely absolutely right so something\nclicks for us so if we sort of stop and\nthink about it that click is internal\nit's not actually external absolutely\nyou have information all around yeah\nyeah so the yogis basically the more\nthey looked at it the more that that\nthey concluded that most of knowledge if\nnot 100% of knowledge is all clicks you\ndon't actually need external\nsources um okay so I think we talked\nabout\nConsciousness uh\nI think there's a we'll give you a shot\nat this one this may be a little bit\noutside of your wheelhouse but if you\nhave thoughts we'd love to hear them we\ndon't care that it's outside your\nwheelhouse we're happy to hear whatever\nyou have to share what is the difference\nbetween distance and dissociation such\nas someone who abuses fentanyl we know\nthe latter is not healthy but why is the\nformer\nhealthier distance and dissociation so I\nthink he's referring to he or she's\nreferring to when we say create a\ndistance between your mind and body and\nyourself right so that's am I\nunderstanding that\ncorrectly uh I I I don't know just just\nso I think that's what they refer to so\nin order to for example you you\nmentioned that uh I think my my Guru\nagain gives this example of traffic\nright it's a beautiful example let's say\nthat you're sitting in a traffic and you\nare in the traffic it's really hard\nyou're in Los Angeles for example you're\ncursing everyone but if you're sitting\non a helicopter and watching down the TR\ntraffic you're actually enjoying the\ntraffic because it's not affecting you\nso it's somewhat like that where you're\nalso living this life like everyone else\nbut if you can just distance yourself\nfrom this every everyone else you know\nexperiencing then you're actually\nenjoying the troubles and you're able to\nhave this insight and actually come up\nwith solution so that is dist distancing\nit's very healthy and actually he says\nthat that's the end of suffering there's\nonly two kinds of suffering physical and\nmental suffering if you can keep the\ndistance and create the distance then\nsuddenly end up suffering whereas what\nfentony does is the dissociation state\nthat you talked about is just something\nthat is happening within your brain\nright your for example ketamin is a\nbetter example where you're creating an\nanesthetic state with a dissociative\nanesthetic state where you're numbing\nyourself you're putting things putting\nthings under the wrap or putting things\nunder the blanket you're really not\nsolving the problem but you're just\nsuppressing the problem I heard you\ntalking about you know how C you know\ncaffeine you know B basically delays\nyour fatigue but but it's all there so\nit's something like that so really\nyou're not taking care of the root cause\nof the problems in order to survive so I\nthink that's a difference yeah so I I'd\nagree 100% And and i' I'd say that using\nfentanyl or camine is the opposite of\ndistance or Detachment or entanglement\nright so if we really look at what's\ngoing on there I am so\nentangled I'm so pissed off that I'm\nstuck in traffic that I need to get rid\nof it but if you really look at it like\nI'm very attached to that and it's a way\nof numbing it and even if we look at\nsome this is like kind of sketchy\nNeuroscience but we know from studies on\ntrauma that we have something called\nhemispheric lateralization which is when\nwe have decreased activity across our\nCorpus kosum so what literally happens\nwhen people with trauma dissociate is\nthey shut off the emotional brain's\nconnection to like the analytical brain\nso what I can do is like if I'm going\nthrough a very painful experience like\nI'm being abused in some way my\nanalytical mind sees that it's happening\nbut I I don't touch my emotions at all\nthe emotions are active it's just my\nawareness of the emotions are not there\nso physiologically like the emotions are\nvery active my heart rate is elevated\nall this kind of stuff but I just don't\nperceive it so this is what dissociation\nis it is literally a separation of both\nthings whereas if we look at the\nNeuroscience of Detachment or distance\nthe interesting thing is that it's my\nbelief and this is sketchy I think\nthere's a very solid clinical case some\ndegree of extrapolation from\nNeuroscience studies that distance is\nliterally Neuroscience in the opposite\ndirection so when you are mindfully\nengaged with something that is very very\nchallenging it can be difficult but when\nyou throw yourself into it without\nentanglement without stuff like when you\ncultivate Detachment you actually engage\nfurther and I think that the flow state\nis closer to Detachment so as we so if\nwe kind of think about this I know it\nsounds kind of weird but so if I'm\nparanoid about failing a test I can't\nactually enter the Flow State and study\nbecause instead of focusing 100% on\nstudying there is a portion of my mind\nthat is worrying about\nstudying so entering the Flow State\nrequires us to detach we can't be\nworried about consequences we can't be\nhaving parallel thoughts we can't have a\ndirector's cut right so a lot of people\nin our uh Community suffer from social\nanxiety and so what is social anxiety\ninstead of participating in the activity\nI have a constant commentary where I'm\nsaying this person doesn't like me\nshould I say this should I not say this\nam I talking too much am I talking too\nlittle so that sort of separate parallel\nprocess prevents the Flow State and what\nwe know about flow state is that it\ntends to be some pretty synergistic\nactivity across the brain so we're not\n100% sure about this stuff but it seems\nlike it's kind of in the opposite\ndirection from hemispheric\nlateralization where you need some\namount of emotional activation in\ninvolvement and so I'd say that these\nthings are actually like Detachment\ndissociation fenel\nis yeah that's why it's bad right\nbecause you're not actually detaching\nfrom things you are so attached to it\nthat you need to get rid of it but like\nyeah that's how I'd say it's kind of\ndifferent um any thoughts before we move\non to the next one yeah so I was trying\nto say when you talked about the social\nengagement piece right so we recently\ncompleted a study on relationships so um\nusing you know whatever tool that you\nwant to use any meditative tool so we\nused ining but you can use anything else\nwhere you know it it just I was\nfascinated by the result you know you go\nas a novice you go take this program and\nyou do this whatever for six weeks Etc\nsuddenly we found that all the usual\nscales in Psychology that are used for\nmeasurement of relationships and what\nare the you know subscales that actually\ndrive that seems like it has made a\nchange in each one of them so you are\nin your relationship with yourself your\nrelationship with others at work your\nrelationship at work all of that just\nenhanced completely and now you're\naccepting people you're accepting\nyourself and now you're suddenly moving\nin the society as a very confident\nperson you're centered on something that\nis very very native to you that's you\nknow like we talked about the\nintelligence Etc that we all have\nsomething in ourselves you around them I\nthink it's very important to bring that\nespecially when the Surgeon General\ntalks about loneliness and you know\nthat's a bigger problem right now the\nsocial engagement P suddenly becomes so\nmuch easier and I think that is a\nperfect antidote for loneliness and\ntaking something like this gives you\nthat much of insight and suddenly your\nrelationship becomes so much better and\nall angles acceptance of you others all\nthat I think that is very important I\njust wanted to give that to your readers\nwhichever tool you take you know seems\nlike it would make a difference great so\nI I think uh the Segways to the next\nquestion so the idea of having an\nexperience distanced from The Real World\nin quotes and being able to have a\ntranquil experience while the real world\nisn't sounds like purposeful delusion to\nkeep happy isn't that\nbad so when you say that there is a\ndistance to I I think for example let's\nsay that we'll take a game of soccer\nright or a game of cricket or whatever\nwhen I'm playing it I'm so engaged in it\nI can't be I am probably much closer\nthan anyone else in there because I'm\nnot thinking of anything else I'm in it\nI'm experiencing it 100% so it could be\nmountaineering it could be you know um\njust talking to someone and I'm talking\nto you I'm engaged in you more than\nanyone else is probably engaged in you\nso it's so much real for me in such a\nbut what I'm distancing myself is from\nthe outcomes and also you know um I know\nwho I am and I know who what I own and I\nhave that Insight in my head and I'm\ncompletely aware of it so that's what\nwhen when I say there's a distance I'm\nnot saying that you're distancing\nyourself from an experience like when\nI'm in it I'm engaged completely but I\nknow the practicalities the pragmatism\nand all of that I complete insight into\nthat yeah so I I'd agree so I I think\nthere's a couple of nuances in in in the\nquestion it's easy for me to see because\nI can read it but the idea of having an\nexperience distant from The Real World\nand being able to have a tranquil\nexperience while the real world isn't so\nlet's pause right there so the idea of\nhaving an experience of Tranquility\nwhile The Real World Isn't So that\nassumes that the real world is\nobjectively a certain way right so if we\nkind of say that okay you're having a\nTranquility despite the real world and I\nthink the really crazy thing is that the\nreal world is what it is it doesn't make\nus tranquil or not tranquil so I I mean\nfor me this is a lesson that I learned\nlearn kind of the hard way but uh in in\nmedicine so I was like an intern at at\nMass General and I I remember my first\ncode so like for those of you all that\ndon't know like there's something called\na code blue which is like in all these\nmedical shows when people pull out the\npaddles and you're doing chest\ncompressions and things like that so the\nsituation can be objectively\nbad but the best way to run a code is\nwith Tranquility if you were panicking\ninternally oh my God this guy's going to\ndie like yeah he's going to die like\nthat's a very real possibility that's\nwhy we're all here you can still deal\nwith that and this is what I saw from my\nsenior residents and the people who who\nran the codes who are oftentimes\nanesthesiologists right so like the way\nto run a code the best way to run a code\nis\ntranquil so so this is the crazy thing\nit's not so let me ask like I'm going to\nput this to to our community because\nthey'll understand what this means so\nyou're kind of saying the idea of having\nan experience from The Real World and\nbeing able to have a TR tranquil\nexperience while the real world isn't\nsounds like purposeful delusion to keep\nhappy I don't think so but what I would\nsay is that if you're losing a video\ngame is it better to tilt or not tilt\nand if you I know this may not make\nsense to you because maybe you don't\nplay games but see the moment that you\ntilt you lose your internal tranquility\nand you can still maintain internal\nTranquility when the game is going wrong\nthat doesn't mean that you're\ndelusionally happy you're not like\ndeluding yourself but you acknowledge\nthat these circumstances are bad and the\nmore internally tranquil you are the\nbetter you will be at dealing with\nthem and the key thing and we know this\nright because we have a lot of\nprofessional sports and sports\npsychology and and stuff like that where\nthe goal is to keep people internally\ntranquil in spite of bad circumstances\nand you can acknowledge that the\ncircumstances are bad and the more\ntilted you get the worse things are\ngoing to get so I I I don't think it's a\ndelusion to keep happy it's actually\nquite the opposite it's acknowledging\nthat things are bad and still being\ntranquil so that you can actually deal\nwith them in the best way possible right\nI'm going to give a couple of examples\nto that right so uh I am totally with\nyou on that so you know in one of the\ncardiac surgical procedures that I am a\ncardiac anesthesiologist it happened\nelsewhere not here so the surgeon closes\nthe test and walks out and I'm the\nanesthesiologist I'm taking the patient\nto the ICU something happens the patient\nyou know gets into trouble and there was\nan emergency situation so the surgeon\ncomes back and and standing there behind\nthe screen you know in my usual way\nthat's calm and handling what I need to\nhandle the emergency that's happening he\ncomes and looks at me and\nsays damn it you know something that I\ndon't what is that tell me now and I'm\nlike hey you know there's something\nhappening just open the chest take care\nof the issues and let's go and he's like\nno no no there's something you know I\nasked him why did he feel that way\nbecause you you're very calm and you're\nnot moving this way or that way but\nyou're you know what is going on unless\nknow something you won't be handling it\nlike that but we took care of the issue\nin 15 20 minutes and then afterwards he\nsaid I'm sorry I just you know broke out\nand something like that but that's the\nTranquil moment you have to be in that\nspace to handle any kind of critical\nemergency that will come up and still do\nwhat you're supposed to do to handle the\nsituation otherwise your frontal lobe is\ngoing to just get inhibited and you\nwon't be acting properly uh because of\nthe negative emotions that you have the\nbest example I can quote is Tom Brady\nright so he says when the game gets\nintense right in an intense situation\nthe game slows down for him and just\ntells you that he's actually dissecting\neverything when he's throwing the ball\nand he's able to focus on that\nparticular thing at that moment and he's\nso tranquil you can see him right in all\nthese comeback fourth quarter comebacks\nEtc how tranquil he is he's the most\nimportantly engaged person that that\ncould be I think in that particular game\nyeah so I I love that example and if I\ncan kind of just piggy back off of it\nfor a second so like this situation in\nthe O cardiac surgeon is panicking\nthere's a there's an objective emergency\ncardiac surgeon is panicking looks\nbehind the drape and sees you who's\nworking but not panicking and then he\ncomes to you and he says there's\nsomething you know I don't the world\nthat you see I must be missing some\ninformation because if you saw the world\nI the way I did you would be panicking\ntoo but you're not panicking therefore\nthere is something in the outside world\nwhich I am missing give me that piece of\ninformation right this is incorrect\nright so it's not that you see a\ndifferent world this presumes and this\nis a very critical thing which I think\nthe the questioner needs to understand\nwe all need to\nunderstand see when you take that\napproach to life that okay like the\nreason this person is Happy is because\nsomething I don't realize something\nabout this emergency it's not as bad as\nI think but that assumes that your\ntranquility or your piece is tied to\nthis external world and that's what he\nthought right is that you are seeing\nsomething that he's not seeing maybe the\npressure is okay or you know heart rate\nis okay there's not vtac or whatever\nthere's all like it but no you're seeing\nthe exact same world it is the way that\nwe interpret that world that's really\nwhat we're tunneling down into that\ninternal Tranquility which it can be bad\nsituation in both cases it's just how do\nyou receive that information I I love\nthat example I think it's so\nillustrative because that is the only\nthing under control right there's\nnothing you you can control only that\nyou cannot control anything else yeah we\ntalk about that quite a bit yeah it's a\nhard lesson to learn um so maybe we've\ngot you good with one or two more sure\nyeah okay so how does AI challenge our\nunderstanding of the human\nconsciousness yeah so uh the positive is\nI think with all the Imaging sequences\nand the neuroimaging advances maybe AI\ncan help us understand understand as I\ntalked about right um we still need to\nunderstand the experiences and the\nconnectomes and all of that maybe AI can\nhelp there but the common question that\nyou're referring to is can AI become\nconscious so that's a question and I\ndon't have any personal experience in\nthat but that's not life so that is\nsomething that you have created and as\nwe talked about initially my take on\nConsciousness is is the energy that\ncreates everything AI lacks that so when\nyou lack that you can never become the\nlife that you're talking about so I\nthink that's where there's a difference\nbetween Ai and US cool so that great\nanswer I've got a couple of questions\nI'm super excited about because I think\npeople are starting to get it so these\nare not like kind of these questions are\nI think based off of things you've said\nas opposed to general questions so if\nthe brain perceives Consciousness like\neyes perceive the world what is the\norigin of perception with with eyes it\nwould be light waves so what would it be\nfor the brain\num so the that's where all the theories\nof Consciousness actually could help\nbecause there is no clear winner there\nthere are four main theories they talk\nabout one the first one is called the\nhigher order Theory say as we have\nevolved whatever information that we\ncame from comes from below through our\nreticular system or the brain stem and\nThalamus Etc the frontal the prefrontal\ncortex actually now you know somehow\ncomputes it creates that experience for\nyou that's one Theory there's another\ntheory where it's basically the global\nworkspace Theory where it says it's like\na stage where there are multiple actors\nand there are spotlights and if a\nspotlight is on a particular actor\nsuddenly now you're seeing that\nexperience but in something else you see\nthat particular experience it could be\nvisual it could be sensory it could be\nmotor in front Etc so that's another\ntheory the third one is talking about\nthe integrated information theory that\nwe talked about you put in pieces of\ninformation from different parts of the\nbrain and then you create an experience\nyou know like um like a musical show or\nsomething like that there's a visual\ninformation there's an auditory\ninformation and there is also the other\nperception that's happening all of them\nput together create that bigger\nexperience for you so these are all\nvarious theories that are out there how\nit actually processes and leads to that\nfinal um you know Consciousness piece\nit's still evolving we don't know okay\ncool so I think this is somewhat\nrelated um if we consider our brain to\nbe a sensory organ how is it that we\ncan't perceive each other's\nConsciousness if I have a device to\ndetect weight how why do we only detect\nour own weight or\nthoughts uh I think any sensory organ\neven the touch right for example if I\ncome and touch alo alo will perceive the\nexperiences within him I can't\nexperience what he experiences so that's\ntrue for any sensory organ so there's no\nreason why a sensor organ should be able\nmy sensor organ should be able to\nperceive his sensory experiences I think\nthat's a simple answer for that yeah so\nI can't see out of your eyes I can't\nhear out of your ears so why would I be\nable to use my brain to perceive your\nConsciousness yeah I I guess you caned\nlike a yogis if you get that level of\nyou know advancement you can be\nconnected perhaps then that's a very\ndifferent world you're talking about\nthat's not my experience so I can't talk\nabout that but I can just say based on\nmy knowledge it seems like they are able\nto do that yeah so so there are cases of\nof um you know there not cases let's say\ntexts of particular practices which can\nbe done to perceive\nthings outside of your standard\nperception and being kind of broken down\nto you and and we also have some\ninteresting you know corroborations for\nthat concept when we look at some of\nthese things like psychedelic\nexperiences where people are able to\nfeel the hurt of other people people\nhave a a much deeper empathy that can\nsometimes evolve and this happens\nthrough meditation or or psychedelics\nit's a lot safer I think in meditation\nbut um and and so there there may be\nsome wiggle room there but I I think\nyour answer is a really solid one which\nis that this is kind of coales into our\nexperience and this is this is this\nplace we're standing when we perceive\nthe world so we can't stand somewhere\nelse someone else is standing over there\nand so they're going to see things from\ntheir angle we going to see things from\nour\nangle one last question so if we accept\nthe existence of Free Will and a free\ndecision isn't based on things like our\nmemories thoughts feelings personality\nwhat is it based on\nthen so um my so you know you know we\ntalked about this right you're not\ndriven by compulsive Behavior but if\nyou're driven by your conscious action\nthat okay today I want to talk to a and\nI want to make my point across and that\nis what I'm going to focus on now I'm\nmaking my brain work for my for myself\nthat myself I already mentioned that for\nme it's outside of this physical body\nnow I I think that's what it's based on\nit's not based on some automatic\nreactions some based on some past\nmemories that we talked about Elemental\nmemory evolutionary memory you know\ngenetic memory all of that so it's I'm\nnot just somebody driven by those but\nconsciously I'm deciding that this is\nwhat I'm doing\nso that's me if I can actually say who\nis that me that's the basic uh you know\nseeking that goes on around the world at\nleast for meditators as to who who am I\nright so that's a bigger question to ask\nbut if I can figure out that me then\nthat is the one that is driving all\nthese actions and that is the Free Will\nthat I'm talking about yeah so if I if I\nunderstood you correctly right so we we\nhave this idea that okay when we're\nbehaving outside of free will we're\nbeing driven by memories thoughts\nfeelings Etc the whole point of free\nwill it is is that it is that which is\nnot based upon something else so actions\ncan come from multiple sources they can\ncome from drivers right like hunger\nright so that's like that's the driver\nfor the action and some people believe\nthat there is this other thing that is\naction without being driven and that's\nwhat we kind of call Free Will so it's\nnot that the whole point of it is that\nit's not based on something it's free so\nit is it is a free will and you know\nthat's abolutely yeah\num how do I know my meditation\nexperiences are reflecting reality\nrather than them being an artifact of my\nneuronal\nactivity yeah I mean if you're asking\nthe question then uh first thing um that\nmy master says is that people around you\nwill tell you what your what transitions\nare taking place in you over a period of\ntime right it's not just one day or\ntoday or third day that's one second is\nthe centering of yourself will change\nthere will be so much of insight within\nyou that you're it's almost like\nflashing you know it's almost like\nholding a flashlight within yourself so\nyou're seeing yourself in much bigger uh\nway and actually both your goodness and\nboth your bad things are all highlighted\nsometimes times it's even very difficult\nwhen you become when you have that much\nof insight that you living with your own\ninadequacy sometimes becomes challenging\nso I think it's very you know you can\nfigure out that which way you're going I\nunderstand that's an internal Direction\nand it's very hard for you to figure out\nwhe going the right direction or not so\nhaving a community for you to lean back\non fall back on is good to tell you\nwhich direction you're going to evaluate\nyourself and having a particular school\nis good and listening to a teacher is\ngood these are all important things to\nmake sure that you're not delusional and\nyou're actually going in the right\ndirection great thank you so much so I\nthink that's all the questions that\nwe've got for today um Dr Superion do\nyou want to tell us a little bit about\nuh if people want more information or\nwant to learn more about your work or or\nyou know people are curious for more\nwhere should they go right so I also\nwanted to uh make a disclaimer that one\nyou know it's my everything that I've\nanswered is B based on my journey but\nit's very heavily influenced by one is\nfrom the science and second is from my\nown spiritual Master his name is sub\nGuru and all I've done is inner\nengineering and most of my knowledge\ncomes from there but that knowledge is\ngrounded on my experience and I'm not\ntalking just copying something from\nsomewhere so that's very important and\nso if there's something that you want to\nknow we have a center called sguru\nCenter for conscious Planet at Beth isra\ndness Medical Center and I'm a professor\nat Harvard Medical School so we website\ncalled sguru Center for conscious Planet\nat BMC you can just Google that sguru\nCenter BMC BMC you'll get our website\nthere's more information about the\nresearch that we have done mostly in the\npsychological space neurom maing space\nEtc and for my own Journey again you can\nchoose whichever one you want I'm not\ntrying to sell any products here but\nwhat has given me the transformation\nwe're not looking for just knowledge but\nactual transformation and that is what\nwhat truly I'm seeking and that is all\nfrom this technology called inner\nengineering you can Google that and\nfigure that out okay cool thank you so\nmuch thank you Al thank you for giving\nthis platform it's fun talking to you\nyeah dude it was great I I think you\nknow it's it's so hard to find people\nwho are so as well versed as you are\njust obviously like you know you're\nyou're a researcher you're a professor\nof\nanesthesiology um you know you really\nunderstand the science and and all that\ngood stuff and then you've also had\npersonal lived experience through\nspirituality and I I think one of the\nbiggest challenges that I frequently see\nis a lot of people who are very\nspiritual will make neuroscientific or\nscientific claims which they may not\nunderstand I mean you can argue that\nthey have this Cosmic Insight or\nwhatever and then on the flip side you\nwill have a lot of people who are\nbiological reductionists who don't have\na whole lot of subjective experience of\ntranscendental States um and so they're\nkind of each side is kind of operating\nwith an assumption of what the other\nside understands\nand what I really appreciate about you\nis I think you're you're excellent at\nalso drawing the lines right because\nthere are several times where you said\nthis is based on my experience this is\nwhat these kind of things say these are\nthis is what my master says here's what\nthe Neuroscience says and I'm not\nclaiming that the Neuroscience supports\nthis these are actually two separate\nperspectives and sometimes they overlap\nand sometimes there's work that needs to\nbe done yeah sounds good thank Youk so\nmuch take care a wonderful evening yeah\nbye bye all right\num okay so what was that like\ny'all did we get to enough\nquestions\num yeah great okay so I know was it's a\nlittle bit less practical than we\nsometimes talk about but I I think it's\nlike you know and and so so uh Dr superm\nis a fantastic guy so he's like I mean\nhe he just just really is well studied\nin this stuff and I think part of the\nreason I was excited to have him on is\num kind of for the reasons that I just\nsaid right so oftentimes you'll have\npeople who have one slice of\nexperience and and like that's fine so\nyou can develop a view that is\ncompletely legitimate based on one slice\nof experience but the thing that was so\ninteresting about my journey and and\nwhat I think is like fascinating is that\nso I like started studying meditation\nand I was like a huge skeptic I was like\nthis is all Bs like I don't think any of\nthis crap works and so early on early\nearly early on what I did is I had all\nthese options to study different kinds\nof meditations and I moved away from all\nthe BS ones so I was like I want to do\nthe practices that have some\nphysiological or Neuroscience evidence\nto back them up and that's what I'm\ngoing to\nchoose the problem is that like as I\nstarted doing those practices and\nlearning from authentic people I started\nhaving experiences which were not\nexplainable by science I was like this\nis insane man and then I started to get\ninto the more esoteric branches of of\nmeditation and that's where you get to\nsome really weird stuff which like I I\njust don't think the science is there\nyet I mean I think science hopefully\nwill be able to discover it but I we\ndon't know right like we don't\nknow um do an interiew with spolski okay\nwe'll reach out to\nhim I think he's\ngreat\num\nso yeah and and I I think\nuh you know like spolski is Fant\nfantastic right and so like I'm like Dr\nsuban has had conversations with people\nlike Steve Pinker and you know so that\nthey had like a conference I think about\na year ago there was a a conference\nabout Consciousness at Harvard and so\nthey had all kinds of people like they\nhad\nneuroscientists like spiritual people\nlike yogis philosophers\nlike all kinds of you know bi like\nneurobiologists they had all kinds of\npeople they just to have a discussion\nabout okay let's understand the\ndifferent\nperspectives um and I think that's\nwhere you know we\nare\num yeah so so we're we're down to do\nmore interviews with everyone right so I\nI think this is where we just try to\nbalance out like first of all who's\ninterested in showing up\nhere um so sometimes people you know we\nwe've reached out to a lot of people who\nhave not necessarily declined but have\nnot said yes which is totally fine right\nso people have schedules and whatnot um\nand and so we're happy to have\nconversations like\nthis\nuh yeah so I I think there are a couple\nof fundamentals we'll address one or two\nlike kind of last things and then we got\nto we got to um you\nknow uh we we we got to call it then\nso um if I make a decision a free\ndecision powered by my free will in what\ndirection does that push me and why\nwhat's the motivation of my free will\nsee this is where we have to understand\nthese concepts are so\nweird that the language that we\nuse\num okay I see people are interested in\nChris Palmer too yeah so I Chris taught\nme when I was in residency\num so Chris Palmer is fantastic and he\nwas like he taught me I think I don't\nthink he gave us a lecture on nutrition\nI think he was like maybe he taught I\ndon't know bipolar disorder or whatever\nbut we you know he was I trained and he\nwas a faculty where I was training um\nany viewer interviews yeah I think we've\ngot a couple coming up okay so let's\njust talk about this someone's saying\nlike what is the motivation of My Free\nWill so that this is where we have to\nunderstand very\nimportant see motivation\nis a\ndriver Free Will is not a driver the\nwhole point is that it's free and this\nis so confusing so hard to\nunderstand because most of our life we\nare so caught up in controlling our\nmotivation cultivating motivation\nrestraining motivation creating\nmotivation so let's understand this see\nthis is why everyone is stuck because\nwe're so obsessed with motivation so why\ndo we want motivation because if we have\nmotivation then things are automatic\nyall get\nthat so I want to be so motivated to\nwork out so I I once you know had a\npatient who this was I was working on an\ninpatient unit and we were doing group\ntherapy one day and one person was\nanorexic and another person was bulimic\nand the bulimic\nperson was envious of the anorexic\nperson because they're like I wish I was\nso psychologically traumatized that I I\ncouldn't eat cuz then I would have the\nbody that I wanted so this is the way\nthat we live life we want to be so\nmotivated that we we want to\nrelentlessly whip ourselves we want a\ndriving force within us that pushes us\nin a particular\ndirection we actually don't want to be\nin control we want to be out of control\npointed in the right direction I want no\nsteering wheel in life I want the Nitro\nboost and I want the Nitro boost to be\npointed in this Direction that's what\neveryone looks\nfor and this is why we\nstruggle because we're not actually\ntaking control of our life we are trying\nto seed control of our life in a\nparticular\ndirection and why do we want\nthat because motivation is\neasy responsibility is gone I have that\ninternal motivation to work out so now I\ndon't have to push myself\nright if you're motivated then things\nare easy so the search for motivation is\nthe search for an easy\nlife the challenge is that we don't\ncontrol our\nmotivation and so the real antidote to\nthis stuff and I think this is why we\nsee that there's so much like you know\nscience about meditation it's like you\nhave all these like different metrics\nthat people will measure you have it\nsprinkling into things like\nclinical modalities like dialectical\nbehavioral therapy like whatever right\nand like the the main thing that all\nwhat these yogis figured out with all\nthese meditators figured out is that the\nway that we are living our life is\nbackwards right so we're trying to\ncontrol our motivation so that our\nmotivation controls us that's what\nmotivation does it pushes you right so\nI'm I'm trying to push it so that it can\npush me the what is far far far better\nbecause cultivating motivation is good\nbut it's not it's not the right way to\ndo it the best way to do it is just to\nbe free from all\nmotivation so when you are free from all\nmotivation then you can freely\nchoose and then people ask but then I'm\nconfused if I don't have any motivations\nwhat do I freely choose from how do I\nknow what decision to make and this is\nwhat's super cool then your decisions\nare determined in a weird way by your\ncircumstances so I'll give you all simp\nsimple example and you may say but hold\non Dr K doesn't that mean that you lose\ncomplete control of your life I know it\nsounds that way but hear me\nout see let's say I have a test on\nFriday if I'm motivated to study for the\ntest I will study for the\ntest if I'm motivated to play a video\ngame I have to overcome that motivation\nand play and and and then I have to\nstudy for the\ntest so the weird thing is that the more\ndetached you become I know this is going\nto sound weird the more free you are and\nthen you can respond appropriately\nwithout internal\nHang-Ups so the more detached you are\nthe more free you are you can just\nsimply decide and then sometimes you\nmake those decisions based on the\ncircumstances and you may say that's\nlosing control of your life but I'll\ngive you all it just no it's the\nopposite I know it sounds weird so I'm\ngoing to try to explain\nit so for example let's say a patient\nmisses an\nappointment and I get pissed off right\nbecause this is the third appointment\ntheyve missed and they call and they say\nDr K can you see me I know I missed\nthree appointments I'm so sorry so if we\nlook at this moment what does the\nsituation demand who knows what it\ndemands but the whole point is that if I\nam pissed off then I will not see\nprecisely what the situation demands\nthere is no right answer or wrong answer\nin some cases this person may need an\nappointment and I don't want to punish\nthem for missing three appointments in\nother cases this is a pattern of\nbehavior that I am indulging in\nreinforcing and if I say yes they're\ngoing to no show a fourth time which way\nis correct we don't know it is based on\nthe individual precise\ncircumstances the whole problem with\nmotivation is that the more that I bring\nfrom in\nhere the less weight the outside world\nhas so now I want to even though what\nthis person needs is for me to not\nbehaviorally reinforce them if I feel\nguilty my motivation prevents me from\nresponding appropriately to the\ncircumstance does that kind of make\nsense I know it sounds backwards\nbut it's crazy once you realize how true\nthis is that your freedom so and if you\nlook at your life what is hard about\nyour life what's hard about your life is\nnot that you don't know what to do\nwhat's hard about your life is that you\ncan't do what you need to be\ndoing you can't do what you should do\nyou can't do what the circumstance\ndemands should you have a salad or\nshould you have a sandwich should I\nstudy today or should I play games today\nthe whole point is that you cannot\nrespond appropriately to the\ncircumstances but since we're a bunch of\nGamers here if I designed a video game\nwhere you had perfect control over your\ncharacter because this is what we do in\nvideo games right we optimize everything\nif you're playing like Persona or\nsomething today I'm going to work out\nand as soon as the workout cool down is\ndone I'm going to go do this I'm going\nto socialize here I'm going to do this\nI'm going to do this and we we're going\nto get some s tier performance in\nlife what determines the S tier\nperformance we can look at it\nobjectively and say these circumstances\nrequire these responses and if I do all\nof that I will get an S tier in life\nbecause the beautiful thing when you're\nplaying a game like Persona is the\nprotagonist has no motivation all they\nhave is free will they can do whatever\nthey decide which is you you have free\nwill with no motivation the protagonist\ndoesn't complain I don't feel like it I\nwant to play video games there's no\ncomplaints there's just complete Freedom\nwith no motivation and this is how you\nget to S\ntier we completely missed this point\n100% if yall understand this great if\nyall don't understand it I don't know\nhow else to explain it in this moment do\nyouall get what I'm saying\nhere so it's kind of\nweird because we we have it\nbackwards that we think oh my God like I\nneed to be motivated I need to be\nmotivated I need to be motivated you're\nseeding control you're seeding control\nyou're seeding\ncontrol and then we get confused because\nthe more that I let go of control of my\nlife to my internal\nimpulses like cuz when the was that\nthe successful\nformula CU listening to your internal\nimpulses is like not the way to build\nthe life that you want and so then what\nwe try to do is we're like okay but what\nif I have the right impulse that causes\nproblems too the the right impulse\nbecause the right impulse is not always\nright because the circumstances of your\nlife change people demand different\nthings so you can't have a motivation be\na right\nmotivation simple example if I'm going\nthrough problems in my marriage should I\nbe motivated to break up or should I be\nmotivated to make it work which one is\nright it\ndepends and what we have is a whole\nsociety that is trying to cultivate a\nmindless motivation I want to be\nhardworking I've seen so many people\nburn out in their 40s hit midlife crisis\nwhy because they're hardworking because\nsuccess is everything to\nthem I remember reading an article about\nMichael Phelps in his suicidality after\nwinning like 14 gold bals or something\nlike that and everyone looks in that\nthey're like how can you be so stupid no\nno no this is the price that you pay for\nyour\nmotivation cuz he was Mo presumably I\ndon't know he was motivated to be the\nbest and what that means is that you can\nbecome the best but if your motivation\nis to be the best and then you become\nthe best what that also means is you\nwon't be the best\nforever so even when you win you\nlose this is what motivation\ndoes\nright so it's kind of weird so what\ny'all should really do I know it's crazy\nis try to get rid of your motivation and\npeople say I'm so un motivated not true\nif you believe you are unmotivated in\nlife you're actually very highly\nmotivated just in the wrong direction\nyou're what you're motivated towards is\nsitting at home all day and playing\nvideo games that's very powerful\nmotivation see try to get yourself to\nstop very difficult this is not a\nproblem of insufficient motivation it's\na problem of too much motivation and so\nthen we try to create more motivation to\ncombat this motivation and then we get\nconflict I should do this instead I want\nto do this and now I feel guilty and now\nI'm regret and now I don't wish I was\nhere and then we get back and forth we\nget ping ponged back\naround so the right solution is not to\ncreate motivation in the opposite side\nwhich can lead to good external outcomes\ndon't get me\nwrong but to absolve yourself of as much\nmotivation as you can and then you will\nbe\nfree right so I'll ask youall one last\nquestion there are some days in your\nlife where you wake up and you're free\nyou're not actually\nmotivated right you don't have to do\nanything and then you're not like really\nhung up on doing a particular thing and\nthen what do you do you freely plan the\nday you're like today I'm going to do\nthis this is how I'm going to spend the\nday and then if things don't work out\nit's not the end of the world right you\nsort of let yourself respond to the\ncircumstances at\nhand and so everyone's like oh like\nwhere does the motivation from Free Will\nC doesn't work like that Free Will is\naxiomatic it doesn't stand on anything\nelse right and then do such things exist\nI don't\nknow how to UNM motivate what a great\nquestion okay so I guess\ny'all y'all bag me with one more point\nso let's\nunderstand so there are a couple of ways\nto UNM\nmotivate the first is observation so\nremember that motivation is a drive\nright and often times our most powerful\nmotivations are the ones that we're not\naware of so if you look at the\nNeuroscience of willpower monitoring\nconflict is the same thing as willpower\nit's the same part of the brain I know\nwe perceive it as a struggle but\nliterally what our brain is doing is\nmonitoring a conflict right does that\nmake sense you can't be struggling\nunless you're fighting internally which\nmeans that it's monitoring conflict and\nfurthermore you can't monitor conflict\nwithout the\nmonitor monitor is the important part\nthat's the\nverb right the conflict is the\ncircumstance but what you can control is\nthe verb so the right thing to do is\nObserve and the more that you\nnon-judgmentally and completely observe\nthe more your motivation will\ndissolve so I'll give you all a simple\nexample of not observing versus\nobserving so if I am conflicted about\nwhat I want to do today and I decide to\nplay a video game I monitor the conflict\nand I say I should study but I want to\nplay a video game and then I start\nplaying the video game what happens to\nmy\nobservation the moment that I sign up\nfor the video game my observation is\ngone now I'm absorbed in the video game\nand when I'm done what happens to my\nobservation\ngone right then I feel guilty but then\nI'm not observing Ving the guilt I\nbecome one with the guilt the guilt\ncontrols me and then I feel bad and I\nbeat myself up and I lose all\nobservation see the problem is that we\nmonitor the conflict but we don't\nmonitor the\nconsequences and there's this really\ninteresting I want to say it's an\nevidence-based technique because it's\nused in evidence-based programs that we\nuse in addictions called play the tape\nthrough to the\nend which is that we literally train\npeople to observe the consequences of\ntheir actions that's it\nand what you will discover is that The\nMore You observe the more stupid your\nmotivations\nbecome I'm going to get this person\nflowers so that they like me and if you\nobserve yourself you will discover that\nyou can't make people like you you can\njust be who you\nare right and this is what happens is\npeople don't do that and they get caught\nup and they think flowers isn't enough\nnow I have to do this now I have to do\nthis now I have to do this the\nmotivation is very very strong but the\nobservation is not there and so when\nthere is a failure without observation\nthe motivation will double down and\nit'll push you even\nfarther so first thing to UNM motivate\nyourself is to\nobserve not just the conflict but while\nyou're playing observe after you're\nplaying observe observe observe observe\nas much as you\ncan the second thing that you can do to\nUNM motivate yourself is to not feed\nyour\nmotivation so Dr Bala talked about\nthis right so the more that you engage\nin a thought or a pattern of behavior\nthe stronger that that pattern\nbecomes so if I look at like the track\nof a river how does this happen so if\nyou look at sometimes there's like you\nknow tracks and Glaciers and how does\nthat happen one little bit of water goes\ndown a glacier and since the water is\nwarmer than freezing\nit creates it melts a little bit more\nand now I have two droplets of water and\nthey create a little Channel and then\nI've got three droplets and then 100\ndroplets and a thousand droplets and\nthen once I start down a path if I\ncontinue doing it that will get well\nwell well grooved this is what we refer\nto as neuroplasticity and then our brain\ngets locked into a\nhabit so if you look at motivation\nmotivation is a habit it's a mental\nhabit and the more that you give into it\nthe worse that it be comes we see this\nonce again an\naddiction I'm motivated to drink because\nI had a hard\nday if I drink today will it be easier\nor harder for me to drink tomorrow will\nit be easier or harder for me to deal\nwith a bad day with alcohol if I drink\ntoday so this is the crazy thing as we\nlook at our lives and we\nsay my life there's circumstances are\ncrazy there's nothing I can do the world\nis all going to that's all\ntrue but what is the life that you've\ncrafted for yourself what do you do\ntoday right and this is the crazy thing\ncrazy everyone looks at the world and\nsays the world is and there's good\nevidence to support that there's good\nevidence that what we have is not a\nmental health crisis but is an economic\ncrisis and the two go hand in hand fair\nenough but then there are people in this\neconom crisis who have good mental\nhealth and good outcomes what's the\ndifference I'm not saying it's\neasy some people focus on their\nactions some people focus on their\ncircumstances this is a science of locus\nof\ncontrol and if you're someone who says\nmy circumstances are such that I cannot\ndo anything then you've truly lost\nbecause then you don't do\nanything it's the idiots who are like\nlet me try those are the ones that end\nend up doing\nwell so once again if you're in this\nkind of circumstance there will be a\nmotivation towards lethargy and\nStillness and absence of\nmovement and so the more that you give\ninto your motivations the more that\nthey'll\ngrow right so I I we we offered a a good\nexample in Dr K's guide to anxiety so I\nwas working with a\npatient and she had had a partner cheat\non her and so as she was engaged and\npregnant she started to worry that her\ncurrent partner was cheating on\nher and so what she did one day when he\nwas in the shower at night is she just\nchecked his\nphone just to see just to make sure she\nhad this\nfear she checked his phone and she was\nrelieved so she's like okay good I'm set\nnow but then what happened she started\nto worry maybe I missed something so she\nchecked it again and then she checked it\nagain and again and again and eventually\nhe found out it was a betrayal of\ntrust so here's the thing right so if if\nwe use checking someone's phone to\nalleviate our internal anxiety what that\nmeans is the next time we feel anxious\nwe will need that thing we've created a\ndependency the way to get out of a\ndependency is to move in the opposite\ndirection\nso the more that you do not give into\nyour motivation the better off you'll\nbe and the problem is that we don't\nthink about it that way right and here's\nthe third problem here's how to get\nunmotivated the source of suffering in\nlife is aidia or\nignorance the biggest reason that we\nhave Str we struggle with motivation is\nbecause we do not understand the\nprinciple we don't know how it\nworks right so if I want to like get my\ncar to go in a particular direction I\nhave to understand the components of the\ncar this is why it's so much easier to\nplay a video game of a simulation of\nreal life than it is to play real life\nwhat's the big difference between the\nvideo game and the real world in the\nvideo game we know what the rules are we\nknow how it works so we can direct the\nboat exactly where we want it to go in\nthe real world we don't know the rules\nwe're ignorant of the true cause of\nthings so the last thing that we need to\ndo is understand how motivation works or\nthe first thing understand the nature of\nmotivation and understand that it is our\nignorance of motivation that leads us in\nthe wrong direction and case in point is\nwe're so ignorant of this principle that\nwe are actively pursuing the wrong\nsolution and then we\nwonder why things are like\nthis so I see this a lot with so many\npeople I work with so this is when I say\nthe root of suffering is ignorance I see\nthere a thousand examples you guys could\ngive any example of any person that\nwe've talked to or helped or principle\nwe've explained there's always ignorance\na great example is the\nalphas the alphas will say oh my God all\nwomen want is like money or whatever\nstatus or whatever right so they believe\nthat relationships are\ntransactional and then this attitude\nthen they go out and date and if you pay\nattention a lot of these alpha males\nwill be\nsingle or maybe they're dating a lot of\npeople or whatever but they're not\nhappily married with families right and\noften times they're saying yeah that's\nbecause there's no good women left like\nI'm looking for a good\nwoman oh wow they're none n out there\ndespite the fact that you're so\nsuccessful and so rich and have some\nsuch big muscles oh my\ngod there really must be completely\nextinct right I don't know how these\nlike people who are slightly overweight\nand slightly balding are happily married\nand have take their kids to the\nplayground I don't know how that works\nthey're betas so here's what happens\nthey don't realize that their very\napproach when you when they engage with\npeople that they're attracted to you\ndon't have to be an alpha male and be\ndating a woman can be gay bisexual\nwhatever right it's it's what you bring\nto the table when you approach things\nwith a transactional view one of two\nthings will happen people who are\ninterested in transactional\nrelationships will stay and people\npeople who detect that you want a\ntransactional relationship you don't\nwant a real relationship you want you're\nyou have all these transactional views\nthey leave they go pair up with the\npeople who are interested in building a\nlife and so then what happens the only\npeople who stay are the ones who are\ntransactional and then what happens is\nit gets\nreinforced ah see all women want is\nmoney well when you advertise that all\nyou are is money like what do you\nexpect right but the problem is avidya\nignorance and maybe I'm wrong maybe my\ntake on this whole situation is my\navidya here I am saying oh my God I\nunderstand all of these things and oh\neveryone else is wrong and I am\nright\navidya so what is the solution to my\navidya even acknowledging hold on a\nsecond Maybe I'm Wrong Maybe I'm Wrong\nmaybe I'm\nwrong this is the last solution to\nunmotivation whatsoever you think May\nyou're wrong look at it a different\nway because if we look at life what we\nsee is something this was something I\nthink Freud described called the\nrepetition compulsion so if you look at\nstudies on psychoanalysis Psychiatry\nPsychotherapy illnesses whatever we tend\nto find is that people get stuck in ruts\nthey have the same problems over and\nover and over again why they hate them\nthey want nothing more than for these\nproblems to end I keep on ending up we\nknow that studies show that if you had\nan abusive childhood you likelihood that\nyou'll have an abusive romantic\nrelationship goes up goes way up and\nthat's not what they want it's that they\ndo not realize the way that they create\ntheir situations and this am I blaming\npeople for abuse no it's not their fault\nbut they have some control right and\nthis is as someone who's worked with\npeople in abusive of relationships help\nthem get out of it a big part of what we\ntry to do is help them see how they\ncreate this situ\nand I'll give you just one really simple\nexample okay so hopefully please don't\nmisjudge me or judge me right so I'll\ntry to\nclarify so as an example so I was once\nworking with a patient who when they\nwould date someone who did something\nreally nice for them this patient would\nget\nparanoid they'd be\nlike what is going on like where's the\nother shoe like when is this person\ngoing to flip on me like what's going on\nbecause when they were growing up\none parent was abusive and then when the\nparent was abusive that's when all the\nnice behavior\ncame they feel guilty the next day so\nI'm going to get you this little go-kart\nI'm going to get you this I'm going to\nget you this I'm going to get you\neverything that you want and so this\nperson in their earliest years when they\nwere understanding the strength of\ngravity when they were understanding how\nto use the toilet when they were\nunderstanding that up is up and down is\ndown wet is wet wet and dry is dry when\nthey were understanding the fundamentals\nof how the world Works they they learned\na lesson which is that if someone does\nsomething nice to you something bad will\nhappen these two things become a\ncycle right and they don't know which\none comes first they're like six the\nabuse followed by something nice and\nthen the abuse and then something nice\nthe abuse and something\nnice so we look at it as the abuse is\nthe start of it but for the child and\nvery practically it's a cycle so then as\nthis person goes into romantic\nrelationships the people who really\ntreat them with respect they get scared\nand they run away whereas when someone\nmistreats them ah this is something I'm\nfamiliar with and is a real tragedy of\nthe human race that we prefer the known\nevil to the unknown\ngood this is why people stay in ruts\nbecause they're afraid of what else the\nworld brings and that by the is not\nsilly or stupid it's very logical\nbecause if you grew up in an abusive\nhousehold what do you think about how\nsafe the world is in general see when a\nchild grows up in an abusive household\nand they cannot be safe at home the rest\nof the world is very scary because we\nform our basic idea about the world at\nhome can I trust other\npeople that gets taught when you can\ntrust your\nparents does that make make\nsense so avidya is the third thing that\nyou need to really focus on to undo your\nmotivation get complete control of your\nmotivation understand how things work\nand once you understand the rules of the\ngame suddenly it's easy to\nplay is this the problem in life is\nwe're all playing the game of life no\none teaches us the rules no one teaches\nus the mechanisms no one teaches us the\nscientific principles we don't get\ntaught this\nstuff and just imagine like if you're\njust playing some game where\nlike no one teaches you the rules and\nit's like I don't know about y'all I\nplayed those games growing up did y'all\never have this scenario I'd play with\nkids that are older than me and they'd\nlike make up the rules as they go\nthey're like yeah you have to get the\nball in the in the goal\ngreat and then they like toss the ball\nthey're like yeah I have to get the ball\nand the goal the goal's over there they\ntoss the ball and they score a point and\nthen I grab the ball and then I throw it\nand I'm like y I got a point too and\nthey're like no no no the goal moves\nevery time that that goal is usable only\nonce the goal is moved somewhere else\nand I'm like where does it move and\nthey're like over there I get\nanother point and I'm like so where's\nthe goal now and they're like it's\nbehind me and they throw it and then I\nget a point and then like something else\nhappens they're like yeah if you get two\npoints in a row you get a free\nthrow right and then like oh like now\nthat that you've got two points the\nfirst person who gets two points gets a\nfree throw the second person who gets\ntwo points gets a handicap so now you\nhave to hop around on one leg and this\nis this is these are the games that I\nused to play as was a 5-year-old on a\nplayground with seveny olds and these\nare the games that I would play and this\nis how we play\nLife go to college you'll get a good job\ntake out loans don't worry about it if\nyou're in the United States you'll be\nfine trust me\noh you're having trouble meeting people\nmake a profile on Tinder because that's\nwhere everyone is going if you want to\nfind love show up over there cuz that's\nwhat works\n oh you're feeling anxious all the\ntime you know what works great for that\nmarijuana\n right this is what's going on\neveryone 's telling us do this do this\ndo this take this\nsupplement subscribe to our YouTube\nchannel follow me on Twitch and all of\nyour problems will be\nsolved right see everyone's telling us\nwhat to\ndo we're not observing for\nourselves and that's how we get this\nway so observe for yourself learn\nright file means get information from\nother people\nbut you\nknow it's the best we can\ndo uh I think Dr Palmer's work is great\nI haven't read brain energy but I mean\nhe's he's solid generally speaking he's\na great researcher great\nclinician um\num okay one last question is there a\nbiological mechanism explaining how\nConsciousness manifests no there is not\nthat is the whole rub because we do not\nhave that that's the missing piece and\narguably we will never find it because\nsome people believe that Consciousness\nis not a manifestation of\nbiology\num okay you're very welcome\nmamax so yall keep\nworking um and keep at it we'll see yall\non Friday we have a member stream on\nKarma so if yall are interested in that\ncheck that out and otherwise thank you\nall very much for coming you know give\nus feedback on how yall enjoyed this\ninterview or not I know it's not for\neveryone so we are always trying to\nexplore different things having a little\nbit more of an academic conversation\nreally understanding stuff from an\nexpert so we're we're we're going to do\nall the above so it's just about what\norder we do it in so let us know what\ny'all are interested in and
