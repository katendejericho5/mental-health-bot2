    "transcript": "so the core problem that I see that a\nlot of men are struggling with is that\nthe world is changing but expectations\nare lagging behind and so even though\nthe world has changed in terms of where\nwe're living and what things look like\nmy hope is that this gets sorted out in\nthe next 10 to 20 years but there's a\nlag time in terms of expectations and\nmen are getting crunched between how the\nworld has changed but what we expect of\nmen so for example many people will\nexpect men to be providers of like four\nperson households you should be able to\nbuy a house you should be able to\nsupport a family like as a man right so\n75% of women for example want men to be\nemployed the expectations of what a man\nis supposed to be able to provide are\nbecoming increasingly impossible for men\nto do but no one gives us the slack for\nthat right everyone is like I still\nexpect this of you as a man I don't\nreally care that the macroeconomic\nenvironment has changed and that it's\nhard for you to\nprovide"
