    "transcript": "people who get addicted to the internet\nusually have a history of trauma or\nneglect now this is also changing a\nlittle bit because as the internet\nbecomes more addictive the amount of\ntrauma or neglect we need to get\naddicted is going down so now we have we\nused to have severely damaged people who\nwould have addictions but as the add\naddictive potency of the thing goes up\nwe don't need to be quite as damaged to\nget addictive so when we have difficulty\nforming bonds with human beings the\ninternet offers us this place to form\nbonds in an easier way it allows us to\ndissociate from our lives and now I have\nall these friends online I can hang out\nwith people on Discord all the time but\nI'm socially anxious in the real world\nso what I'm doing is I'm separating\nmyself out I'm literally dissociating\nand fragmenting my identity and if you\nreally pay attention what you'll find is\nthat in the virtual world we feel safe"
