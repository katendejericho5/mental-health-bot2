    "transcript": "today we're going to talk a little bit\nabout ADHD and\n[Music]\nobesity now generally speaking we think\nof these two diseases is unlined but the\nmore that we're learning about medicine\nthe more we're realizing that there is a\nMind Body Connection and what we're\nseeing sort of really speaks to the\nconnection between these two diseases or\nconditions so just as an example the\nworse your ADHD is at the age of let's\nsay six or seven the more symptoms of\nADHD you have the more likely you are to\nbe obese at the age of 16 so it turns\nout that these two conditions are very\ntightly connected because in ADHD we\nhave altered reward processing which\nmeans that the dopamine release that we\nget from food is much more potent and is\nmuch more likely to lead to obesity on\nthe flip side we tend to think of fat\ncells or adipocytes as cells that are\njust storage but they're not storage\nthey're actually hormonally active and\nit turns out that fat cells\nactually produce certain chemical\nsignals that will worsen ADHD as a\nsimple example of this there's this\nchemical called brain derived\nneurotrophic factor which is something\nthat literally stimulates growth of\nneurons and what we know is that kids\nwho have low bdnf are more likely to\ndevelop ADHD and it turns out that the\nmore fat cells you have the larger your\nadipocytes actually are the more that\nthey interfere or stop the uction of\nbdnf so let's dive a little bit into the\nNeuroscience because the Neuroscience\nwill show us how the brain of someone\nwith ADHD is a little bit different and\ngive us new options for things to do\nthat we don't even bother with in\nneurotypical individuals because they\ndon't have the ADHD deficits so let's\nstart with some features of ADHD number\none is reward processing so we know that\nthe dopaminergic circuitry in people\nwith ADHD is different it's more\nsensitive in some ways and specifically\nwhen it comes to food we discover one\nreally interesting thing so anticipation\nsignals I.E cravings for food is\nincreased okay so this comes from the\nPFC so the PFC is altered this is a\nprefrontal cortex in people with ADHD\nand now this would be fine this isn't\nthat big of a deal but this is where\nkids with ADHD really get screwed so the\nfood reward is actually decreased okay\nso this is something that's very very\nfascinating this is very different from\nwhat most people expect so most people\nassume and this is true in some ways\nokay that if I eat some unhealthy food\nsince my dopaminergic circuitry is more\nsensitive I get more dopamine that's\ntrue and we'll get to that in a second\nbut there's one really interesting\ndichotomy in ADHD which is that the\nCravings that you get are more intense\nbut the satisfaction you get from food\nis actually lower so let's say that I'm\na neurotypical person so I see I don't\nknow like a cookie and so when I see the\ncookie I get a craving score of five\nfive and then I eat the cookie and I get\na satisfaction score of five so this is\ngood right I want to eat the cookie the\ncookie looks really good I eat it I\nreally get satisfied everything is great\nnow if we look at someone who has ADHD\nand they see a cookie this is what\nhappens their craving score becomes a 10\nbut their satisfaction score becomes a\n2.5 so what are the implications of this\nthe first implication is that you want\nfood more but food is less satisfying so\nif we look at the brain of someone who\nhas ADHD what does the brain of ADHD\nwant so in this case we just need one\ncookie to satisfy our anticipation or\ncraving but if you really look in the\nbrain of someone who has ADHD we need\nfour cookies to satisfy this very\nintense craving so literally the reward\nthat you get from food is reduced so the\nway that I kind of understand this is\nthis is a little bit like a skeleton\nwho's eating food so I remember I saw a\ncartoon many many years ago of a\nskeleton who is very hungry and what\nthey keep doing is they keep on putting\nfood in their mouth but there's no\nstomach there's no digestion there's no\nsatisfaction so no matter how much they\neat they never really feel full or get\nthe benefit of eating and this is\nliterally what we see due to alterations\nin the PFC in ADHD increased Cravings\nlower dopaminergic response from receip\nof food hey y'all if you're interested\nin applying some of the principles that\nwe share to actually create change in\nyour life check out Dr K's guide to\nmental health it combines over two\ndecades of my experience of both being a\na monk and a psychiatrist and distills\nall of the most important things I've\nlearned into a Choose Your Own Adventure\nformat so check out the link in the bio\nand start your journey today the second\nthing that we see is altered inhibitory\ncontrol so this we kind of understand\nright so one of the problems in ADHD is\nthat people have impulse control\ndifficulties so if I get an Impulse\nlet's say I I see some kind of food it's\nvery difficult if I get the impulse if I\nget the thought of eating it it is very\nhard for me to restrain this impulse and\nso part of the challenge if you're doing\nlike obesity management is we can sort\nof tell people hey like you know the you\nshould eat healthy like make sure like\nyou know you you don't eat as much\nunhealthy food and then the neurotypical\nbrain is able to restrain their impulses\nmore so in ADHD we have a slight problem\nbecause the second that the impulse\nenters your mind if the idea of food\nenters your mind then you will eat the\nfood the gap between idea and action for\npeople who have ADHD is way smaller so\nif we look at the neurotypical person we\nhave the idea of food and then the act\nof eating is further away okay so this\nmeans that they have more ability to\nrestrain their impulses the second\nproblem that we have the third problem\nthat we have is altered emotional\nregulation okay so we need a little bit\nof Neuroscience for this so we have this\npart of our brain called the amydala and\nthe amydala is connected more broadly to\nsomething called the lyic system so this\nis where we feel negative emotions okay\nthen over here we have the nucleus\naccumbent which gives us dopamine and\nreinforcement anticipation okay so let's\njust understand dopamine circuitry real\nquick so let's say I have a stimulus if\nthe stimulus activates the nucleus\nsuccumbent we get a dopamine release and\ndopamine then goes to other parts of our\nbrain and does three things the first is\nit makes us feel pleasure the second is\nit increases Cravings of whatever the\nstimulus is so this makes sense right so\nif I eat a cookie for the first time oh\nmy God the cookie was so delicious what\ndoes that make me do the next time I see\na cookie I will have a craving for it\nthe next thing that'll happen is that\nit'll increase behavioral reinforcement\nso this is kind of related to the cookie\nso not only will I want the cookie but\nit is more likely that I will eat a\ncookie next time okay so this is the\ndopam energic circuitry basically how it\nworks now what we also know in people\nwith ADHD So This is highly sensitive in\nADHD which means that the dopamine\nsignal the anticipation and the\nreinforcement that we get is Amplified\nso there's another problem in ADHD which\nis emotional disregulation so what does\nthis mean so people who have ADHD feel\nnegative emotions more intensely so\nliterally like if something happens\nlet's say someone cuts me off when I'm\ndriving let's say this normally leads to\na in a neurotypical person this leads to\nfive units of anger in someone with ADHD\nthis will lead to 7.5 units of anger\nokay so we literally know that these\nparts of the brain are more jittery and\nare easier to activate there's another\nproblem so not only do we feel things\nmore intensely we also feel the emotion\nfor a longer duration okay so not only\nam I angry at units of 7.5 but I'm angry\nfor the next hour so we sort of know is\nthat this emotional disregulation has\neven been hypothesized as a subtype of\nad DHD so for some people this is\nactually their primary symptom now this\ncreates a specific challenge in food\nbecause these two circuits in ADHD are\nnot unlined in fact they're synergistic\nso what this means is that people who\nhave ADHD in their brains anytime they\nhave negative emotions this actually\namplifies their sensitivity to dopamine\nso what does this mean on a practical\nsense so let's take a look at what this\npractically means the first is I have my\nner typical kid okay then I have my kid\nwith ADHD who is happy and then I have\nmy kid with ADHD who is sad so in\nscenario number one kid sees a cookie\nneurotypical kid kid eats cookie kid\ngets five units of dopamine okay five\nunits of craving all right and five\nunits of dopamine now let's take our\nhappy kid so happy kid sees a cookie\nthis is 8hd Happy Kid okay so CES a\ncookie gets 10 units of craving and gets\n2.5 units of of dopamine from eating it\nso already I have to eat four times more\ncookie than a neurotypical kid now let's\ntake an angry kid or sad kid so now what\nhappens is if I've got negative emotions\nthis is going to amplify this effect\ntwofold so what this means is when I've\ngot negative emotions I need something\nto make me feel better so I will get 20\nunits of craving so now this anger this\nnegative emotion needs some kind of\nrelief so crave this cookie even more\nbecause as soon as I activate my\ndopaminergic circuitry it will help me\nfeel better so I may still get only 2.5\nunits of dopamine but my craving is now\ninduced so now what happens is anytime\nI'm angry or sad or have some kind of\nnegative emotion I need to eat eight\ncookies in order to not only give myself\nsome amount of pleasure but since I have\nso much more craving so much more\nnegativity I sort of have to treat that\nnegativity using this dopaminergic\nstimulus and this is in a nutshell why\nkids with ADHD are four times as likely\nto be obese compared with typically\ndeveloping kids what happens is our\nbrain is designed in this way where it\nbecomes sensitive to negative emotions\nwhich we have difficulty controlling we\nare more sensitive to Cravings we get\nless receip of food so we have to eat\nmore and so this is a basic basic\nproblem now before you think oh my God\nDr K does that mean I am screwed I am\n no there's good news so let's\nlook at a couple of things that we can\ndo because there are new interventions\nthat we can use that will counteract\nthese neurological mechanisms so number\none is the problem is that food reward\nis actually decreased okay so what can\nwe do there are two reasons for this so\nwhat we need to do is Savor our food\nhuge huge huge huge huge important thing\nthe more that you intend intentionally\nand attentionally Savor your food this\nfood reward will get increased so if you\nlook at people with ADHD what do they\nlove to do while they're eating not just\npeople with ADHD everybody right\neverybody loves to watch YouTube listen\nto a podcast oh we're being efficient\nwe're being so efficient I can't waste\nmy time eating oh my God that's 30\nminutes where I'm not learning Spanish\nor learning to code or having fun I'm\ngoing to work after I'm done eating so\nlet me have my break let me watch a\nlittle bit of Sports while I have my\nmeal right this is what we think so as\nwe watch this kind of stuff as we have\nsome kind of dopaminergic stimulus or\nsome kind of distraction it decreases\nour attention and if it decreases our\nattention on eating we are going to\ndecrease our food reward when you go to\nthe movie theater they give you a\n bucket of popcorn with like 128\no of soda these gigantic jugs of stuff\nand you sit there because the movie is\nso damn good and you don't get any\nreceipt of your food reward so there are\ntwo things that you need to do which\nwill help a lot the first is Savor your\nfood really sit there and enjoy it taste\nit notice the food as much as you can\nsimply noticing will increase the\nreceipt of the food signal second thing\nthat you can do is do not distract\nyourself don't do anything while you eat\nbecause then your brain is so\ndistractable to begin with it's not\ngoing to pay attention to anything that\nyou're eating so if you want to counter\nthis reward processing deficit or change\nin ADH Savor your food and don't eat\nanything don't do anything else while\nyou're eating second thing altered\ninhibitory control okay what this means\nis that the idea and the action are\ngoing to be way closer in ADHD so what\nwe really need to do is space those out\nso practically what I tell my patients\nwith ADHD is no\nunhealthy available\npackaged food okay so what does this\nmean this means that if you buy it and\nit is sitting in your pantry you will\neat it without realizing you will eat it\non an Impulse you cannot control whether\nyou eat it on an Impulse or not so what\nI tell all of my patients and what works\nreally well for them at the very\nbeginning I was saying don't you know\nstop eating cookies and that didn't work\nand then we discovered something really\ncool you can Absolut absolutely eat\ncookies but don't buy cookies make\ncookies so if you want to eat something\nunhealthy unhealthy food requires work\nthis is the key thing we're not cutting\nout unhealthy food because that's that's\nmean it's cruel oh you poor kid who's\nobese with ADHD no more cookies\nfor you no bro girl go ahead and have\ncookies but just make them bake them\nfrom scratch buy the flour buy the brown\nsugar buy the chocolate chips we want to\nincrease the gap between an impulse and\na reward and what I find when I work\nlike this with my patients is they are\nactually totally fine it's like awesome\nlike okay it's Friday evening I've had\ndinner I feel like having a cookie so\nwhat I'm going to do is bake a\nbatch of cookies that takes 30 or 45\nminutes it's way healthier there's none\nof this processed crap in it we'll get\nto that a little bit but this actually\nworks really well so do not buy packaged\nunhealthy food that is easily available\nthe only packaged stuff that you are\nallowed to buy or the only stuff that is\neasily available for you is healthy\nthings all of your unhealthy food should\nbe made so even if you want to make\nfried chicken don't buy Frozen nuggies\ndon't buy Frozen tendies chop up\nthat chicken breast make your egg wash\ngrab your breadcrumbs and fry that\nup man like have it and it's going to be\ndelicious it's going to be good it's\ngoing to be way healthier anyway okay\nthis is critical you cannot win this\nbattle when you are fighting it this\nbattle is won logistically before you\neven show up on the field of battle it's\none through Logistics ahead of time\nthird thing altered emotional regulation\nwhat can we do to fix this we need to\nmove this way so this is a prime example\nof one of the biggest problems that I\nsee with endocrinologists treating\nobesity I'm not trying to dog on them\nthey're doing a fantastic job they have\ngreat outcomes whatever right so I'm not\nsaying they're doing a bad job this is\njust a weakness of our field of medicine\nwhere we've over specialized in bread\nand weakness so if you're trying to\ncontrol your food impulses what you\nreally need to do is control your\nemotions so if we look at studies on\npeople who are binge eaters what we\ndiscover is Three core changes when it\ncomes to emotions the first is that they\nhave poor emotional ulation skills okay\nthe second is that they are almic so\nthey are not aware that they are even\nfeeling negative emotions you don't even\nknow exactly what's going on you're kind\nof like your mind is wandering all over\nthe place this is sort of why I see with\nmy patients with ADHD they're like mind\nis all over the place they have so many\nthings to take care of they feel like\nthey need to they're under a lot of\npressure right that's what they really\ndescribe they don't describe sadness or\nshame or fear or anxiety they're like I\nhave a ton of to do that's what\ntheir subjective experience is and what\nis that that's some kind of negative\nemotion it's fear of the consequences if\nI don't do it right it's anxiety it's\neven perspective shame if I don't do\nthis right oh my God I'm going to feel\nso bad everyone is going to think I'm\npathetic everyone is going to hate me no\none's going to want to be my friend all\nof these emotions are going on they're\nnot aware of it what do they feel they\nfeel pressure more than anything else so\nthey are unaware of their internal\nemotional state and then what happens is\ntheir brain their amydala knows that\nthere is shame there's fear there's\nanxiety there's Panic there's even some\namount of anger right oh my God how did\nI get into this situation why do I\nalways do this to myself right you feel\nall these negative emotions but you're\nnot aware of it all you feel is pressure\nand so then the brain of the ADHD person\nrealizes okay we have all this negative\nemotion we need to get this under\ncontrol boom let's go to the nucleus\ncumbin baby let's go let's get some of\nthose cookies let's manage that emotion\nCU we need to manage that emotion we\nhave to do we can't afford not to\neat unhealthy today because we have so\nmuch things to do so we literally find\nthree features in the brains of people\nluing poor emotional regulation skills\nAlexia which is emotional colar\nblindness we have a whole lecture on\nthat we've got guides on that it's\nreally really important third thing is\nreally fascinating these people\nliterally dissociate oh interesting so\nwhen you dissociate let's see oh\nfascinating we are not aware of the food\nreward so interesting right so what\nhappened is 30 years ago people did\nbrain scans on people who binge and like\nwow these people are dissociating we\ndidn't understand the mechanism now we\nunderstand the mechanism there is a lack\nof attention literally that's what\ndissociation is is to not be aware in\nexperiencing what is going on in your\nlife so what do we need to do to correct\nthis problem what we need to do to\ncorrect this problem is manage our\nemotions so what I recommend in my\npatients who are ADHD and obese because\nthey don't see the problem as emotions\nright they see the problem as impulse\nbehaviors they see the problem as\nwillpower they see the problem as\nattentional deficits emotions aren't\neven on their radar right so i' I've\nheard of very few endocrinologists who\nwhen someone comes in who's overweight\nfirst of all they may not even do an\nADHD evaluation right because we're here\nfor weight management and secondly\nthey're not going to say like okay\nwhat's your emotional regulation uh\nManagement on a daily basis how do you\nmanage your emotions every single day\nthat's not a part of obesity treatment\nand I'm not dogging on the\nendocrinologist because these people\nstudied for like 3 years in fellowship\nand went to some weight management\nclinic it's not a standardized part of\nour treatment because that's Psychiatry\nit's over there so what we need to do if\nwe have ADHD and obesity is daily\nemotional management right I don't care\nif you Journal I don't care if you go to\ntherapy I don't care if you meditate I\ndon't care if you go for a walk I don't\ncare if you take your dog out for a walk\nor you cuddle your cat or whatever but\neveryone who is struggling with ADHD and\nobesity must must have some kind of\ndaily emotional processing cleaning that\nstuff out it'll make it'll reduce this\ncraving literally neuroscientifically\nit'll make it easier for you to eat okay\nand it's not even that once again is a\nbattle that we're going to win The\nBattle Before we ever show up on the\nbattlefield as you regulate and take\ncare of your emotions your drive to eat\nunhealthy will naturally go down the\nreinforcement of that behavior will\nactually decrease if you manage your\nemotions what that means is that your\nCravings will decrease the pleasure that\nyou get from the unhealthy food will\ndecrease all by managing your emotions\nokay there's a lot of good stuff that we\ncan do hey y' I want to take a second to\ntalk about star Forge PCS so I am in\nlove with these Game Machines because I\nlove gaming the problem is that I\nstarted building PCS when I was 12 and I\njust don't have the time for it anymore\nand if you really think about it like\nsure you can keep up with all the trends\nand stuff but chances are especially if\nyou're a healthy gamer you may have\nbetter things to do with your time so if\nyou're like a college student I love\nthat they have the horizon line which is\nlike more economical really solid gaming\nPC and instead of like spending 15 hours\nfollowing trends like you know study\nyour for your final and like get a\nbetter grade and then get a better GPA\nthen get a better job and then go live\nyour life so if you're like me and\nyou're like a professional and you want\na really solid gaming PC because you're\na gamer but you also don't want to waste\nthe time to figure out what's good and\nwhat's not I highly recommend star Forge\nall of their PCS are built in Austin by\nGamers who really know what they're\ndoing and if you're like me like you\nbuild a PC once every 3 years and you\nscrew up the gel on the heat sink if you\nknow what I'm talking about you know\nwhat I'm talking about all this kind of\ncrap you don't have to worry about\nthey're going to do everything for you\nit'll be a solid PC it'll run your games\nand this is the crazy thing every single\none of their PCS I've ever used also run\nZoom at top specs so check out star\nForge I absolutely love\nhim now we're not done we're just\nhalfway and this may be way too long but\nhey this is like important to understand\nso now let's talk about obesity all\nright so the first thing to understand\nabout obesity is that adipocytes are not\nfat storage cells this is what we used\nto think we think oh my God your fat is\njust energy storage it's just sitting\nthere no no no we have a whole video\nabout this fascinating adipocytes are\nhormonally active oh my goodness so I\nwant you to think about it this way\nadipocytes are Endocrine cells what are\nyour other endocrine organs of the body\nyour testes your ovaries so what this\nmeans is that when we have someone who\nis obese they're eposides they usually\ndon't have more adipocytes the\nadipocytes just grow so if we double the\nvolume of adipocytes it's like doubling\nyour ovaries doubling your testes we see\nspikes in hormonal production and all of\nthese hormones will affect the ADHD so\nlet's start with a couple of core\nmechanisms okay the first is increased\ninflammation okay so what we literally\nknow is that adipocytes produce\nsomething called il6 so il6 along with\nil1 il10 t tumor necrosis fa Factor\nAlpha there are all these so inter\nlucans are chemical signals that\nactivate immune cells okay that's what\nthese are so these will activate your\nimmune system in increase inflammation\nwhat is inflammation it's activation of\nyour immune system but specifically we\nknow that adipocytes will create il6 now\nil6 does something really problematic it\ndecreases\nbdnf now what is bdnf brain derived\nneurotropic Factor so something that is\nneurotropic is something that causes\nneurons to grow a stimulant for the\nbrain now I don't mean stimulant the way\nthat like methyl idate or arerol or not\nthose kinds of stimulants these are\ngrowth factors so they promote the\ngrowth and development of your brain if\nyou look at children and you measure\ntheir bdnf the lower the bdnf in the\nchild during development the more likely\nthey will develop ADHD later in life so\nliterally the this is a chemical\nchemical compound hormonal compound that\ntriggers brain growth and development\nand it is low in levels of in people\nwith ADHD so there are some very small\ntrials that are sort of hypothesizing\nthat stimulating B bdnf will improve\nsymptoms of ADHD it may be one of the\nmechanisms through which um ADHD\ntreatments work on some way that really\nthat stuff hasn't really been sorted out\nbut we certainly know that fat cells\nincrease il6 and il6 decreases bdnf so\nhow does that work let's understand this\nsee our body has two modes it has\nfighting mode and it has building mode\nso our our our brain is just like any\nkind of RTS right so let's think about\nStarcraft or Warcraft I know no one\nplays RTS anymore we kind of have our\neconomy right we're going to build\nthings up we're going to acquire more\nminerals we're going to build more\npylons and then we make a lot of units\nand then we send those units into war\nand when we are building up our economy\nwe're not making like zealots or Marines\nor whatever like either we're building\npeons and pylons or we're building like\nzealots and drons I know this is a\nreference that y'all Gamers\naren't going to understand so either\nwe're investing our in our economy or we\nare investing in like wartime unit units\nso our brain and body are the same way\neither we are fighting off an infection\nor we are building things and the\nproblem is that since adipocytes\nincrease our inflammation they put our\nbody into combat mode and then it stops\nbuilding things it literally reduces\nbdnf which results in problems in our\nbrain reduces the function of our brain\nmakes our ADHD worse second thing that\nadipocytes do is mess with our insulin\nokay now we're going to have to learn\nmore complex physiology this is the most\ncomplex thing I'm going to teach yall\ntoday so let's understand this here is\nme I eat food food makes glucose in my\nbloodstream glucose triggers insulin\nokay insulin causes the absorption of\nglucose into cells so now my cell is\nfull of glucose okay so insulin is\ntriggered any time we eat something so\nwhat does insulin end up doing insulin\nsignals to our brain and our body that\nwe have nutrients check nutrients\nacquired okay so it kind of travels to\nour brain and it triggers things like\nleptin and gin we're not going to get\ninto too much detail but it kind of\nmakes sense right so when I'm hungry I\nwill have glucagon levels that are high\nglucagon is the opposite of insulin so\nglucagon tells us oh crap we're running\nlow on energy we're hungry and glucagon\nwill stimulate hunger and then we eat\nsomething we get glucose insulin shows\nup puts the glucose into cells and\nInsulin goes here and tells our brain\nhey nutrients acquired you don't need to\nfeel hungry anymore there's another\nissue at play which is that the more fat\ncells we have or the larger our fat\ncells are the more we have insulin\nresistance this is why people who are\ndiabetics type 2 diabetics who are often\ntimes overweight or obese require\ninsulin we have to literally inject\nextra insulin because their cells are\nresistant to insulin I want to ask\nyouall a question if I have a resistance\nto insulin what do you think it will do\nto my nutrients acquired signal it\ndecreases it right so the insulin is\nwhat tells our brain hey we have enough\nnutrients you can stop feeling hungry\nnow and as I increase my adipocytes ocy\nmass my insulin resistance increases\nwhich means that my body brain cannot\ndetect the signal of fullness it is\nliterally neurologically impaired so\npeople even when they eat they do not\nfeel full and this is mediated by\nadipocytes the last thing that I'm going\nto touch on I kind of forgot this is\nthat il6 works by two mechanisms one is\nbdnf but then the other thing is that we\nknow that inflammation increases mood\nproblems and anxiety so there are some\ntheories of inflammatory hypotheses of\nthe brain so if you sort of think about\nthis if you get the flu what happens to\nyour mood it goes into the pitter right\nso this is something that's very\nimportant to understand anytime we have\ninflammation in the brain we will feel\nmore depressed we will feel more\nanxious now we see where everything is\ncoming together because if y'all have\nbeen paying attention why does this hurt\nmore for people who have ADHD compared\nto the neurotypical person inflammation\nfrom adipocytes right so here's the\nsequence epoy increase in obesity Isle\nsix mood goes down anxiety goes up and\nwhat happens in the brains of people\nwith ADHD did y'all pay attention did\ny'all remember amygdala hypers\nsensitivity so now what we're going to\ndo do y all remember do y all remember\ndo you all remember we're going go up to\nthis column where is it here it is you\nguys remember this Dr K didn't doesn't\nhave enough space so now what we're\ngoing to do remember this one where\nemotional remember we have the sad kid\nwho's got ADHD so now we're going to add\na fourth column I'm sad and now I'm\nobese so if I'm obese it doubles the\nsadness if I double the sadness I get 40\nunits of craving and now 2.5 units of\nsatisfaction which means I need to eat\n16 cookies and oh that's right as I'm\neating these 16 cookies what would\nnormally stop us from eating 16 cookies\nin one sitting that's right because\nevery cookie that I eat releases insulin\nand tells my brain hey bro we've had\nenough but if I have insulin resistance\nfrom a large amount of adipocytes I do\nnot receive a satiety signal from all of\nthe cookies I'm eating which is\nhow I eat a whole package of cookies in\none sitting if I have ADHD and obesity\neverything comes together so does this\nmean we are screwed no this just means\nwe have been mistargeting the mechanisms\nso the first thing is as we increase\nemotional regulation techniques we will\nactually fix this problem automatically\nthe other thing that we're going to do\nis recruit a couple of other interesting\nthings so now we're going to use kind of\nanti-obesity mechanisms so our body has\nmultiple ways of detecting the food that\nwe eat one is through this insulin and\nglucose metabolism thing but then we\nalso have this thing called gastric\nstretch which is that we literally have\nstretch receptors in our stomach so as\nour food as our stomach fills with\nvolume we get a completely different\npathway right so you can't eat like this\nmuch food in terms of volume why not\nbecause what happens is I is I eat a\nlarge not quantity not nutrient density\nbut literally large volume of food my\nstomach stretches out it expands I feel\nfull and I'm bloated oh my God I've got\na food baby in my belly once I have a\nfood baby it's a completely different\npathway it is a physiologic stretch\npathway and this will help us feel full\nthis has nothing to do with dopamine\nnothing to do with emotions this is a\ncompletely separate pathway and this is\nwhat we need to utilize so what I\nrecommend to all of my patients who are\nstruggling with weight loss and ADHD is\nthat you eat foods that are going to\nmake your belly stretch make that belly\nstretch that is usually high fiber foods\nhigh volume Foods so if you look at\nsomething like broccoli you have to eat\nlike a large volume of broccoli to\nequate the calories of a single Twinkie\nthe problem with a Twinkie is that most\nneurotypical brains if I eat a Twinkie I\nwill feel somewhat satisfied because\nthose sugar receptors the insulin\nreceptors are all kind of in working\nwell so I get this nutrient load right\nand then my brain is like okay we've had\nenough because this is like 400 calories\nno big deal I'm done that doesn't work\nin people who have ADHD and obesity so\nwe need to use gastric stretch so eat as\nmuch high fiber food as you can have it\neasily available this will stretch your\nbelly and will make you feel full next\nthing we want to really start exercising\nso the more that we exercise the more it\nfixes this whole insulin resistance\nthing so we know that for example even\ntype 1 diabetics to a certain degree I\nthink is type one definitely type two so\nthe more that you exercise it kind of\ncounteracts all of this physiologic\nstuff and all this sedentary lifestyle\nis half the reason why ADHD and obesity\nare getting worse so the more you can\nexercise the better it will be for your\nstomach and your physiology and stuff\nlike that it'll even help your brain we\nwant to also eat anti-inflammatory food\nso this is where I would strongly\nrecommend that you seek a professional\nso someone like a dietitian or an\nendocrinologist or medical doctor and\ntry to really start eating\nanti-inflammatory foods and also foods\nthat affect insulin metabolism so in my\npractice I'll use things like margam in\nyou know urtic medicine we'll use bitter\nmelon a lot uh coffee green tea\nchamomile Ginger these are these all of\nthese foods have had some evidence that\nthey will affect our sugar metabolism\nand our inflammation so if you start to\neat these things you can start to\ncounteract some of these principles so\njust in summary so we're seeing a rise\nof ADHD and we're seeing a rise of\nobesity there's another problem that we\nhave which is that if you have ADHD\noften times we don't consider the impact\nof obesity on your brain and on the flip\nside if we're trying to treat obesity we\ndo not consider the impact of your ADHD\nemotional regulation reward processing\nbrain in terms of resisting food so what\nends up happening is that we use all of\nthese interventions which are designed\nfrom clinical trials but as part of\nthose clinical trials because they're\nvery controlled we start excluding\npeople who have problems like ADHD and\nso what we're seeing is a rise of ADHD\nand obesity partially because our\ninterventions don't account for both of\nthem and there are certainly there's\ncertainly a synergistic effect of obes\non ADHD it makes our brain more\nvulnerable and there is a synergistic\neffect of ADHD on eating and so this is\nwhy a lot of people lose hope but the\ngood news is that if we understand the\nmechanisms at play we can Target these\nneuroatypical mechanisms and hopefully\nget a handle on both ADHD and obesity\nand this is what I've seen as a\nclinician this seems like a a battle\nthat's really hard to win because one\nscrews over the other but the good news\nis that if you start moving in the\npositive direction with one if I have a\npatient who has ADHD and their weight\ngets under control their ADHD improves\nif I have a patient who is obese and I\nget their ADHD under control their\nweight improves so both of these things\nit's kind of they combine together to\nscrew you over but you can also actually\nimprove both of them two birds with one\nstone you can get kind of a nice fatty\ncrit in there and hit both of them at\nthe same time so definitely try some of\nthe stuff that we're talking about today\nif you're someone who has a clinician\nthat you're working with right now I\nstrongly recommend that you talk to them\nabout these kinds of mechanisms and see\nif there's something you can do about it\nthe last thing is if yall are really\ninterested in this stuff and you like\nthese kind of mechanisms and stuff like\nthat we have a awesome guide to ADHD\nwhere we dive into a lot of Neuroscience\nand give youall a lot of interesting\ntechniques so check that out too hey Dr\nK how do I get my kid to put down the\ngame without it being a fight every\nsingle time the problem with gaming is\nthat it tricks our brain into being a\nsubstitute for Life once we start to get\nour psychological needs met through the\ngame that's when we become addicted how\nto raise a healthy gamer combines the\nlatest in Neuroscience research along\nwith a decade of clinical practice check\nit out anywhere books
