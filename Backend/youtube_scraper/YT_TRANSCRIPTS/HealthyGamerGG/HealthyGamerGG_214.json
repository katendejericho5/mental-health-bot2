hello Chad welcome\neverybody welcome to another healthy\ngamer GG stream my name is Alo kenoa\njust a reminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is in intended to be taken\nas medical advice everything is for\neducational and entertainment purposes\nonly if youall have a concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional\num\nso welcome\neveryone so we are doing a update stream\ntoday our esteemed CEO will be joining\nus in about 5 to 10 minutes so I think\nwe're going to wait for her to like get\nstarted get\nstarted so I'll tell youall a little bit\nabout why we're doing this and then if\ny'all are cool with it maybe we can just\nhang out for a little while while we\nwait for\nher um so yeah I think\nuh how can I how can I get this\nstarted so\nlike this was never supposed to be what\nit is today like in a good way right so\nwhen we started healthy gamer it was\nlike it wasn't even like we picked a\nname or anything right it was like Hey\nI'mma start streaming and then at the\ntime I had someone who helped me set up\nthe stream and we had to like register\nan account so when I registered an\naccount I was like let's do healthy\ngamer I don't know and then that one was\ntaken so I was like okay healthy\ngamer.com is on auction for like a\nmillion\nso let's be Gamers and add a g to\nit right and so like that's how we got\nstarted and and so we started I mean I\nstarted streaming because literally like\nI was just having the same conversations\nwith the gamers in my office all the\ntime and I was like okay a lot of what\npeople need is not actually\nPsychotherapy or medications it's like\nan\nunderstanding education around how\ntechnology affects them how games affect\nthem and that's kind of where we got\nstarted\nand then I think the other thing is that\nearly on like as we had ideas we shared\nthem with you and I think cruy will talk\na little bit more about this um but I\ndon't know if yall remember but like\nfour years ago or something like that we\nhad a\nfundraiser for to develop a coaching\nprogram that was Community\nfunded and so like we had like and we'll\nwe'll get to this more but you know so\nwe sort of had these ideas like Dr K had\nan idea and it was like okay let's see\nif we can do this together as a\ncommunity let's see if we can do it and\nthen I think something that's changed a\nlot over the last year is that there's a\nlot of internal decision making which I\nI guess we don't we don't talk about\nquite as much and there are reasons for\nthat so one of the early things that we\nrealized when we had a very small team\nso I think we hired our first full-time\nemployee in April of\n2020 um and like you know eight months\nin or maybe into 2021 we had a small\nteam of like four or five people and\nthen sometimes I would have an idea on\nstream and if y'all participated in our\nhigh performance high potential groups\nand y'all were there at the beginning\nyou kind of know what I mean so I was\nlike Dr K was like okay you know what we\nneed to do like there's all these people\nwho struggle with like I have high\npotential like I don't know what how to\ndo with it I don't know what to do and I\nwas like okay let's start a group right\nlike let's start like working on this\nlet's meet on a regular basis and we'll\nhave coaches that help them with this\nkind of stuff and then after like one or\ntwo weeks of the group starting we\ndecided we're going to split people in\ntwo groups high performance and high\npotential and then the first question\nthat everyone had after like one or two\nweeks is like how do you tell the\ndifference between someone who's high\npotential and someone who's high\nperformance and then in my mind I was\nkind of like well if you've accomplished\nsomething then you're high performance\nand if you haven't accomplished anything\nyet you're high potential if you're like\na college student who's like you know in\nan honors program at a prestigious\nUniversity that's like high potential\nand but then we quickly realize like\nthis is silly right because what if\nyou're like two years out and like you\nstill haven't accomplished a whole lot\nbut you have a lot of potential you're\none of the up incomers at your at your\nyou know like job or whatever so the\ngroup had the groups had all kinds of\nproblems we learned a lot and we\ndeveloped it actually eventually into\nsomething like career coaching which has\nbeen very\nsuccessful so it's all useful but like\nwe would sort of start with Half Baked\nideas and then like develop it as we go\nand I think thankfully the community was\nvery very like understanding with this\nkind of approach the problem is at some\npoint we stopped being just a straight\nlike duct tape and glue kind of\noperation right at some point like you\nknow we have a team of over 150 people\nincluding coaches and employees at this\npoint and like you know we're have over\na couple million Subs on YouTube and and\n700,000 Subs on Twitch or followers on\nTwitch and like we're like a real thing\nnow right so we're like got nominated\nfor awards at various places got\nfeatured as a digital innovator or\nmental health innovator at the American\nPsychiatric association so then like at\nsome point like we became a real thing\nand then at that point it doesn't work\nlike we can't just be like oh yeah we\nbuilt this thing I'm sorry it doesn't\nwork and I think this by the way is is\nlike crazy if you really stop and think\nabout it right so we have so many\nwellestablished companies like AAA\ncompanies that are that put out products\nat huge price tags like $7 for a AAA\ngame $80 for a AAA game plus\nmicrotransaction bullshittery and it's\nbroken at\nlaunch and like we had [ __ ] that was\nbroken at launch like four years ago but\neven today with our\nyou know somewhat\nupgraded duct tape and Sho string and\nglue kind of like stuff like we put out\ngood products and we get good feedback\nright and so I think it's crazy so like\nI I think we've got a lean mean team\nthat is really really awesome we've got\na community that's super awesome and I\nthink part of what we're going to do\ntoday is because the other thing that\nmade it easier for us to share more\nabout what we were doing is it was like\nDr K is going to think out loud on\nstream but at this point we have people\nwho are we've got a team of developers\nand we've got product a product lead and\nwe've got like marketing people and we\nhave like a CEO and a CFO so like now\nthe building in public doesn't quite\nwork the same way because there are\npeople who are actually building it the\nright way which is part of part of the\npart of what makes our products great\nand also part of what like makes HG feel\na little bit different and so today I\nthink the goal is just to talk to youall\nabout what we're doing\nwhy we're doing it and what we hope to\ndo um and I think we we did this some\nwhen we launched memberships which I\nthink some people had concerns about\nwhich is fair enough we'll get into all\nthat so we're going to be like very\ntransparent today or I I think we're\ngoing to be very transparent we'll see\nwhether y all consider it transparent or\nnot but um you know our goal is to\nreally show youall and I I think some of\nit is not just this is what we were\nthinking but I think a lot of times I\ndidn't understand this either so when we\nstarted out when I started out before it\nwas a Wii right so like it was easy to\ndo things for HG because the only cost\nwas my time so I would like literally I\nwould work three 12h hour days in my\nclinic and then I would devote two two\ndays to HG so I would like work a whole\nweek and\nthen yeah I have a chair you can take\nthis one actually because the mic is\nstill set up in a way that it really\nonly picks up one person um why don't\nyou sit down here for a second I'm going\nto finish my thought and then you can\ntake over okay and I can help you drive\nokay but like at at the beginning the\ncost was only my time and then also it\nwas like what was our primary product\nour primary product was just stream so\nthat's pretty simple right we just need\nlike some kind of camera I remember I\nstreamed on a Yeti mic right so like we\nhad like a I had like an $80 camera and\nlike $150 microphone and that was it\nthat's all we needed and then I had my\ngaming PC obviously\nright which my work\nPC and and that's all it took but now I\nthink as as we'll show youall today\nhopefully that there's a lot more that\ngoes into it and then I also did not\nappreciate you know like how expensive\nthings are to actually build the right\nway and what we hope to do today is to\nshow yall what we're what we're how we\ngot to where we are what we're proud of\nwhat we're grateful to y'all for because\nwe literally could not be here without\nyou and also why we choose why we made\nsome of the choices that we made and\nwhat what some of the options are we\nalso want to show youall a little bit\nmore about behind the scenes what it\ntakes to\nbuild what we have built so far um and\nI'm going to actually turn things over\nto gruy who is sitting outside of the\nframe but that's okay and I will be\nsitting next door or not next door I'll\nbe sitting right here but I think you\nshould swap because this might set up we\ngot to figure out maybe a two mic set up\nat some point sitting where you tell me\nBBS do you need water I\ndo hey guys I'm straight out of the\nshower um how's everybody\ndoing if you need to do anything with\nWindows and stuff tell me I will do\nit I need to don't touch anything just\nFe okay hold\non how's everybody doing\ndoing\num all right I'm going to just get a\nlittle oriented here because I don't\nlike talking into the void so I want to\nmake chat bigger and myself\nsmaller okay y'all are going so\nfast okay um usually I need like a face\nto talk to I don't do well with anyway\num it's been a while since I've gotten\nto hang out with you guys and I am\nrealizing that we haven't given any\nupdates on what we're doing why we're\ndoing it what we're building so today I\nwanted to really connect with you guys\nand get your thoughts and opinions\non what we're kind of trying to\naccomplish here what we're\nbuilding uh I think it's been kind of\nfun\nbecause you know we've made a couple of\ndecisions\nright like was okay I'm going to quit\nmedicine to do\nthis and at the same time he was like\nbut if I do this I don't want to be\nsomebody who's just selling courses or\ndoing speaking events he really liked\nthe impact part um so then we kind of\nmade the decision\nokay if we're going to build something\nlet's build it let's make it high\nintegrity let's make it sustainable\nlet's make it something that he would\nfeel proud to recommend to\nsomebody and so we started with this\ncoaching\nprogram um way back in the day there was\nI don't know on a good day it was like\naund CCV stream and this was pre\npandemic right so there wasn't there\nwasn't such a dramatic need there were\npeople starting to think like oh I\nreally could be doing more for my mental\nhealth and so we built a coaching\nprogram for you know the hundred or so\nfolks that were showing up and also by\nthe way none of this was supposed to\nwork it was an experiment like let's see\nif we can do\nthis but of course as always all knocked\nit out of the park it went really well\nand then everything just kind of blew up\nand so we said okay how do we keep this\nintegrity and do it at scale\nand that's kind of where our coaching is\nAl look I am really struggling with how\nunsymmetrical I am on your\ncamera um you're not unsymmetrical there\nyou're I'm just unsymmetrical no you're\nunsymmetrical because you're it looks\nlike this and it's an angle the camera\nis angled slightly that's why you look\nweird let's stot you over here I can't\neven tell why don't look at don't look\nat yourself well I can't do this whole\nstream with one eyebrow that much higher\nthan the other one okay you want to go\nfix\nthem just don't worry about it just\nwe're not here for vanity I know that's\nwhy I'm trying to make the okay listen\nyou had your face blown up I made it\nthat's because I'm so much more\nnarcissistic than you are okay y'all\nwant to hear something\nfun how do I no I don't want the whole\nchapter how do I just\ncan you find chapter one for me so I can\nplay it for them all right listen if I\nget really unsymmetrical asymmetrical\nfor you just let me know otherwise it's\ngoing to be a long hour or so okay\nanyway so we started building things at\nscale and the coaching program was such\na hit that we really wanted\nto continue building on kind of the\ndepth but also the breadth\nso we wanted to\nget how do I say this the quality was so\nhigh but then the pandemic hit and so\nmany people needed help so we built\nreally fast and really aggressively so\nwe wanted to make sure that through all\nthat building the Integrity really\nreally stayed true and I think we were\nable to accomplish that I want to share\nthe impact Report with with you guys\nvolume is a bit low yeah you need to sit\ncloser to the microphone okay this is a\nproblem that we still haven't been able\nto figure out this is I don't know I can\nget more close to this yeah just\nget microphone is almost in my mouth\nthat's you just said excuse you I will\nposition this all right no don't move\nback\nthere\nokay let's try this\nagain all we're trying to do I think\ntoday is make sure that everybody\nunderstands what we're trying to do and\ntell us if you guys want to see\nsomething else from us and I want to\nmake sure that kind of expectations meet\nreality I think there are\num I think this is a pretty small\nminority but but it's still something\nwe're sensitive to right where there's\nlike kind of outsized unrealistic\nexpectations of what basically the two\nof us can pull together um we have been\nreally really fortunate I think that the\nhealthy gamer team is a I got got an\nemail because we just had our 21st hire\num for a healthy gamer and it's really\ncool to see everything grow so so big\nlike I used to meet every person that we\nhired I used to meet every I was in on\nevery decision and now you know we're\nlucky enough to really have a whole\nscaled up system and infrastructure\naround Mental Health Resources that\nwe've built for you guys um but the real\nPoint here is that it's for you so if\nthis is not what you want we are open to\nhearing what it is that you want um with\nthe coaching\nprogram we and that's like you know\nacross all of our content Revenue all of\nour Enterprise Revenue all of the\ncoaching Revenue all of the memberships\nall of that about 70% of that goes into\nmaintaining the quality and integrity of\nthe coaching program it's so important\nto us that if people are coming in for\nthat kind of experience that they're\nreally getting the best that they can so\nanyway that's kind of our Guiding Light\nis to build for and with this community\nand I wanted to share with you guys some\nof our plans some of the things that\nwe're working on I think you're going to\nlove most of it I think you're going to\nhave concerns about some of it so I want\nto kind of talk through all of it\num all right I agree Dr K looks great\nwith long hair oh I also wanted to share\nwith you have yall heard I'm listening\nto Al's Audi book right now like which\nis really not great for americ Mar but\noh I just want to play this part for you\nokay penguin Random House audio presents\nhow to raise a healthy gamer end power\nstruggles break bad screen habits and\ntransform your relationship with your\nkids this is the author alot kogia\nmdmph okay that's all I was just really\nproud when I heard\nthat all right so I think people are\ndone with the disclaimers let's get into\nit let's get into\nit um so what do you w to you want to\nstart with what let's go with the impact\nreport\nokay I think we can just link it in chat\nright\nyeah well we can just show it real quick\nshow it I will do this oh they want to\nsee you come over here are you reading\nresearch article right now yes for a\nmoment\nokay um it's going to be hard no this is\nnot going to work this you have no\none I tried to I tried to get this chair\nto work it didn't work I usually get the\n[ __ ] chair I know I got the [ __ ]\nchair this time I'm the [ __ ] today why\nare you because we don't I don't know\nhow to do this I tried for like five\nminutes and then um okay so let's we\ndon't have to go through the whole\nbecause I I think we showed this\nyesterday but I think just say say what\nyou want to say about well I just want\nto send them the link honestly okay\nwe'll just share real\nquick go ahead say what you want to\nabout the impact\nreport I mean honestly I wan to Che\nsituation I want to know um I want to\nanswer questions I think that impact\nreport is fairly explanatory um to me\nthe really cool part about all of this\nis we've the coaching program to date\nhas seen 16,000 people go through it and\nit still has like a 4.8 out of five star\nrating which to me is crazy and we have\nclients in like 140 something countries\nand territories so that's been\nawesome what is that I think just people\nthings that have been built\npeople are making things\num okay why don't we just okay let's\njust can I can I take a yeah please all\nright so this is going to be okay let's\nswap you see if you can figure out how\nto get this chair to to raise oh my\nGod okay musical\nchairs no\nmusic okay so we chat chat all right so\nwhat what are we talking about so a\ncouple of things about where we started\nI I saw some stuff on on chat just ask\nthem like what they want to know I don't\nwant to just talk at them yeah yeah what\nI think we're going to we're going to\nget to that um so I I just want to talk\na little bit about like why we built\nwhat we built so far and what we want to\nbuild going forward so the first thing\nis uh this just to get give youall a\nquick timeline right so we tried a lot\nof different stuff at HG so we tried\nfirst of all streaming\nhere's the problem with streaming is\nthat we got the same questions over and\nover and over again and that there's not\na library of content so one of the\nchallenges that we had to face was like\nokay how do we get how can we make\nsomething that's like almost like a\ncurriculum where if someone shows up\nlater um and then\nsays uh you know oh like has Dr K ever\ntalked about this and for a long time oh\nGod\num so for for a long time people would\nbe like oh is like has Dr K talked about\nthis kind of stuff before and then let\nme\nsee okay um so so if Dr K has talked\nabout this and then what what we used to\nhappen which was great right is people\nin our community would like sift through\nour content and say oh yeah there's a\nlecture on this or maybe this other\nresource from like another Mental Health\nCreator or this book is fantastic so we\nwere very very like Community Driven\nwhich is fantastic the problem is that\nlike y'all as community members don't\nhave the quite the same resources at\nhelping each other out as we have as an\norganization so this past year Tech\nteller who's an absolute Boss by the way\nhas been with us early early early on\nright so discovered us on the internet\num built these resource packs and so the\ngoal of resource packs is to give people\nlike you know like various oh okay I\nhave to be signed in so a lot of these\nare various lectures that we've done all\nover the place and then they have\ndifferent kinds of um like Reflections\nand videos and exercises and stuff like\nthat so we built\nah um we built these resource packs\nright so these were also like a a a kind\nof a fair lift from a product\ndevelopment side like this design and\nstuff like these look gorgeous and these\nare not\nlike these are not these take some time\nand energy to build um we talked about\nimpact report so so we started to\norganize our content we also did a\ncouple of things which I'm sure youall\nnoticed which is that we started to make\ncontent that was not live streams so\nwhat we sort of discovered is that when\nwe live stream stuff there's some stuff\nthat works really well on live stream\nbut sometimes people want like very like\na a to the point 20 minute or 30 minute\nvideo that really encapsulates a concept\nso we built that and then some people\nwere happy about that and some people\nwere not happy about that right so a lot\nof people who were with us at the\nbeginning were like this stuff seems\nless depth than the other stuff we liked\nthe depth that Dr K used to provide and\nthat's where we basically ran into a\ncouple of problems and the first problem\nis that we grew so then we had a core\nproblem of like okay as we\ngrow what's the goal for\nlike making what people want right\nbecause this is where there's like\ndifferent subsets of people at HG and\ndifferent people want different things\num so we started to switch over not\nswitch over but we started to do\nStandalone content that would get\nuploaded to YouTube uh but we still\ncontinued to stream and then like\nrecently for example a lot of people\nwill ask about things like interviews\nand stuff I hope to get back to way more\ninterviews especially Community\ninterviews um in the summer probably is\nwhen it's going to happen and the reason\nfor that is also because we grew and\nthis isn't like oh we grew therefore\nwe're leaving this [ __ ] behind this is a\nokay let's think about mission for a\nsecond like what are we doing here right\nwhat's the goal the goal is to try to\nhelp as many people as possible with\ntheir mental health and so we have a\nchoice like we always have a choice so\nrecently I went on a podcast called\nDiary of a CEO and the podcast was from\na metrics perspective very successful\nthere were a couple of clips that went\nviral and then there was a whole\ndiscussion that started to happen around\nlike suicidality and especially men's\nmental health so what I just want yall\nto like think about for a second is that\nour our choice is very simple right so\nwe I have a choice on any given day so\nfor Diary of a CEO I literally travel to\na different city right so it's like for\nthree days being on that podcast costs\nthree days of time\nso over the course of let's say like 50\nweeks a year right if I'm working six\nday that's like it's 1% of my yearly\ntime goes to Diary of a CEO so in that\nwhen I choose to do that what that means\nis that I sacrifice to stream days and\nthen the question is like what's is it\nworth it I don't know right we still\nactually don't know so generally\nspeaking what we found is that being a\nguest in other places is good in a lot\nof ways we had this book come out so we\nhad to like go to different places and\nwe went to NBC and things like that and\nthat was all great but it's like once\nagain we're trying to help as many\npeople as possible but the problem is\nthat when we do that we have to make\nsacrifices somewhere\nelse and especially if you know the main\nmuscle behind HG is Dr k then that's a\nvery very limited resource which is part\nof the reason why we started doing\nthings like made a coaching program and\nliterally the reason that I made a\ncoaching program is because I was\ngetting like 5,000 requests a month in\nmy private practice and I was like\nthere's no way I can see all these\npeople so can I teach people to do what\nI do in some way and there's a lot of\nevidence about peer support and stuff\nlike that in favor of United Nations and\nWorld Health Organization and Office of\nthe US Surgeon General everyone says\npeer support is fantastic i' had seen\nthat as an addiction psychiatrist\nworking at a couple of rehabs so we were\nlike okay let's build a peer support\nprogram for us for our generation this\nis not AA it's not adaptation of AA you\nknow there's certain Pro problems with\nAA in my opinion and many people doesn't\nwork well for them it's a fantastic\nprogram overall and I I'm a big fan of\nit but let's build something from the\nground up for us and I think if I had to\nsay like what are we about that's the\nmission statement let's build something\nfrom the ground up for\nus so then came Dr K's guide which is\npeople wanted a lot of depth um\nthe problem once again with online\ncontent is that there's a short\nattention span and people are coming in\nand out and so we wanted to create a\nlinear experience that is like a Mastery\nof a particular topic so often times\nlike I I was just seeing you know like I\nwas reading some YouTube comments from a\nvideo I can show you literally what I'm\ntalking about um I'll screen share this\nin a second so I was looking at comments\nlike this and and these kinds of\ncomments is what what made us make the\nguide hold on a second quiet\nyou\num so like I'm just going to show you\nall just one comment from a a lecture we\nhad right\nso\nuh so people would say stuff like this\nis not unusual by the way okay so this\nperson is saying my God now I understand\nwhy I never paid attention in school I\nliterally cannot get enough of these\nlectures it genuinely feels like I'm\nlistening to living life 101 so many\nbasic concepts I just completely miss\nthe boat on imagine if something like\nthis was taught in schools the benefit\nfor children would be incredible so we\nwe got this kind of feedback early on\nand so when I made the guide the goal\nwas to make a not living life 101 but a\nlike depression 101 or anxiety 101 or\nmeditation 101 and let's like turn it\ninto something that is oh let's turn it\ninto something that is like really\nreally indepth now the challenge is that\nwhen we do something like that it's not\ncheap right so this is this is where\nwe're going to get to a couple of\ndifferent\nthings um\nwhat\nyes there's so many\nCHS okay so you got to move up can't sit\nlike that okay got to move all the way\nup all right all right can we\njust okay so um let's let's show them so\nI think what we want to do is just show\ny'all a couple of\nthings that wait where is\nthe uh we want to show youall just a\ncouple of things before\num\nuh what should we start with I think I\njust want to quickly see um any\nquestions so\nfar you got to speak up and into the mic\nokay but I can't see anything with it\nright there my\ngod\n[Music]\num any questions so far my name is cie\nkenoia I'm Mrs K in chat I'm Miss cruy I\nam the co-founder of healthy gamer um\nand run all of the operations in the\nCEO yeah so just to give you all an\nexample um so here's just to give you\nall a sense so I think sometimes people\nI don't know how many of yall are\nfamiliar with content creation but so\nfor example like for Content this is\nassuming two to three lectures or videos\nper week okay so this is somewhere\nbetween 8 and 12 lectures a week takes\nabout 290 hours to build a month a month\nyeah right so so that's a lot so I\nprobably spend to do our standard\ncontent of either two to three streams\nor video uploads it takes me about 100\nhours a week so that's about 25 I mean\n100 hours a month so it's almost 20 it's\n24 hours a week\nbasically um and it takes me about eight\nhours of work to do one stream or\nlecture\njust to give you all some other sense so\nlike you know\ndesigning resource packs was a 230 hour\ninvestment go ahead I think we're we're\nwanting to kind of pull back the hood a\nlittle bit to kind of show you\nguys how much healthy gamer has grown so\nthe full team including coaches mods\neditors\nis about 200 people at this point which\nis wild for something that just started\nwith like allak streaming nights and\nweekends\num and I think it's really exciting to\ncontinue to build everything we just\nwant to make sure that we're building\nwhat you\nwant\num there are some kind of larger forces\nat play right cuz we've we've made a\nnumber of decisions\nall doesn't want to just be an online\ndoctor like that has to take a thousand\nsponsorships and stuff like that right\nso we wanted to build actual Services\nactual Mental Health\nResources\nso the way healthy gamer is funded then\nis with products that we're building\nourselves and\nselling as opposed to just taking\nsponsors and essentially selling out\nright we're also not wanting to be a\nnonprofit solely because we don't want\nto constantly be raising money we also\ndidn't want to take investment Capital\nbecause we didn't want to be beholden to\nsomebody else like we don't want to do\nall of this just to make somebody else\nsuper rich like that's not the goal\nright we want to be able to price things\nas affordably as possible we want to\nbuild for you guys we don't want to be\ndriven by an outside force so if we're\nnot taking investors if we are super\npicky about sponsors if we've made the\ndecision that like we want to actually\npractice what we preach and build the\nthings that we wish existed then that's\nkind of What's led to a lot of these\ndecisions\num so that's just like kind of\nbackground for all of the stuff that we\nwanted to talk to you about today like\nthe impact that we've driven through the\nimpact report and\nalso like to show you guys how much some\nof this stuff takes um which we love\nbuilding we just want to show you yeah\nand I I think the the big thing here is\nthat so so we're investing in building\nstuff like uh just a couple of other\nthings that you know we\nbuilt so couple things that worked\nreally well so touch grass was awesome\num if youall remember the touch grass\nchallenge right in the fields was\nawesome so right in the fields continues\nto evolve so that's part of the reason\nwhy you know it took our Dev team\nweeks to build this and um it's awesome\nand then we also want to show youall\nlike we're going through some major\nupdates with the guide and we'll talk a\nlittle bit about like why we're doing\nthis but just to give you all a sense\nright so\nyeah so right in the fields is also\nincluded with um the AOE healer\nmembership now because it was so\nsuccessful we wanted to kind of keep it\ngoing so it's in the m ship tiers um for\nAOE healer level yeah and um so there's\na couple of changes going on with the\nguide so we're making something that is\na little bit more so I I think\noriginally I don't know if yall kind of\nremember this but we had this kind of\nsphere grid thing right so I don't know\nif anyone's playing ff7 rebirth but I am\nand I'm hooked and it's great and so I\nplayed ff10 many many years ago and I\nwas like this is cool right so what we\nwant is like in a character development\nkind of way like going back to the\nschool of Life 101 we want to make a\ncompetency based grid for your life so\nit's like if you want to like you know\nbecome an expert at whatever like\nthere's information here that we can we\ncan we can unpack all of these things\nand like teach you these things one at a\ntime and my vision was that someone\ncould go through the guides and it's\nbasically like a curriculum to teach you\nhow you work and we're building it one\nguide at a time um and and so we we're\nstarting with like very popular mental\nhealth topics and things like that but\nwe're like inching into other things so\nguides are getting to the point where\nthey're overwhelming so we got some\nfeedback that they're like I don't know\nwhere to start this is way too big\nbecause yeah like learning how to live\nlife is like a complicated topic so\nwe're going through some design changes\nand we're going to make things a little\nbit more linear um and now it's going to\nbe more like competencies that are easy\nto navigate so this is too confusing\nonce we get I don't know if you guys can\nsee this but there's like 49 videos in\nthe ADHD module 26 in the meditation 28\nin anxiety 28 in depression and so\nthere's too many dots it's just as\noverwhelming so we need to start\nreorganizing things and there's also\nmore intersections between the guides so\nwe're reorganizing this and then I think\nwe're also moving into other things yeah\nso\nthe other thing that we're kind of\nlooking at\nis trying to let me see if I can find\nstart your\njourney where is this it's gonna be over\nto the\nside\num I'm looking for something in\nparticular so we've grown our\ndevelopment team and also freed them up\nI think from some of the more mundane\nbehind behind the scenes stuff so they\nhave\nbeen I don't know I think this all looks\nreally cool really interested what you\nguys think\num and it's also one of my favorite\nthings is so like Tech teller has been\nwith us from the beginning and I really\ndon't think that there's anybody that\ncan create a community and community\nexperiences as good as Tech does like I\nthink he is the best of the best trinian\nhas been with us from the beginning\nand I don't think anybody\nunderstands the features and\nfunctionality that make I don't know\nmental health education fun the way that\ntran does so that's what's really cool\nabout all of this is he's been with us\nforever uh oh oh so we should call him\non Discord yeah TR will walk everybody\nthrough\nit okay\nthanks TCH I was just wa what his can\nyou tell him to to DM me I don't know\nwhat his Discord is yeah okay I'll do\nthat\nokay oh I I think we may not okay there\nhe is\nokay all right let's see if you\ncan okay hold on hold on hold on hold on\nhold on we got to do a couple things so\nBrandon you're going to have to walk us\nthrough this but I need to add a\num I need to add a source it's okay take\nyour time audio output capture exting\ndesktop say something trinian hi can you\nhear me one two\nthree keep\ntalking talking one two three four five\nsix seven eight so so the only thing is\nwe're not going to be I'm going to put\nmyself on mute you're going to be able\nto hear me but stream will not be able\nto hear me because we need still get\nthis stuff set up um and so why don't\nyou talk us through the guide okay and\nI'll just drive sure what were you\nlooking for earlier I was looking for\nthe the the qu question\nstuff is that here when we ask which\nquestions um like how like question\nbased recommendations yeah that is\num can I share screen and show it on\nstream or actually you can do it too to\nif you want to uh on figma click on the\ntop right play\nbutton\nyeah\nyeah\n[Music]\nnice okay um so the I think this is what\nyou were looking for originally which is\nlike these questions here which is like\nwe are making the guide a little bit\nmore questions based where if you want\nto answer this question about the\nspecific domain in anxiety you would\ncome to these little playlists or paths\nthat you could do but basically the\nexperience\nis um let me see here if I\ncan is everything okay right\nnow okay\nsure cool um so if we started from\nhere um the idea is that we wanted to\nmake it a little bit more custom and a\nlittle bit more guided so like you were\nmentioning before how we now have five\nmodules now and the map itself as a\nsphere grid as a skill tree is kind of\ngetting overwhelming um so our idea now\nis to make it a little bit more guided\nmore personalized to um the user who\ncomes in and you know wants to go\nthrough the guide and get some questions\nanswered or go through specific modules\nthat they are looking through so going\nto skip this survey but basically right\nnow there's an intake survey here that\nallows for us to get some basic\ninformation some baselines first and\nthen that'll customize the experience of\nhow we recommend videos to the user how\nwe kind of navigate them and guide them\nthrough all the modules of the guide so\nskipping this for not because we don't\nhave it for designs but um same as the\ncurrent experience where there's a\ncouple intro videos where you can watch\nkind of uh how to use the guides why the\nguides are developed and then kind of\nstart your journey um afterward and when\nyou come to this view it's um we've kind\nof structured each of the modules now\ninto more of a core knowledge path where\nyou have core knowledge materials that\nis essential to the understanding as a\nbaseline for the module itself so\nthere's a core knowledge for anxiety\nthere a core knowledge for depression\nall the other ones will have one too and\nas you go through each of these um core\nknowledge paths which is a few videos\ntwo to four not too many uh you'll get a\nbasic understanding of how the module\nitself is structured and what you're\nsupposed what you want to what you can\nget out of it so once you've kind of\nwatched that core knowledge and you go\nback to all the paths um this is kind of\nwhere you can find out uh other paths\nwithin the specific module that you can\nexplore to dive deeper on specific\ntopics or learn more and kind of what we\nrecommend to you here in this area like\nat the top under this progression is\nbased off of what you answer in that\nBaseline uh intake quiz and will be\ncustomed to each person and each module\nwill have its own recommendation based\noff of um what originally the intake\nquiz kind of\ncalculates mentioning before where we're\nbasing a lot of the questions or basing\na lot of the module topics around\nquestions that you want to get answered\nin the module itself and you can go\nthrough these playlists or these paths\nto answer these questions more\ncompletely if you watch them from\nbeginning to end so\num right now the only example we'll have\nis again this anxiety\nmodule um like core knowledge but each\nof these will be will contain a custom\nplaylist of tracks um and custom videos\nthat are based off around that core\nknowledge or that specific question that\nyou may have around you know how do you\nunderstand the origins of anxiety if you\nclick in here it'll be like a series of\nvideos talking about anxiety behavior um\nyou know if you're interested in the\nEastern perspectives of anxiety there's\num a track for that too so it's really\ndivided and much\nmore uh digestible in terms of when you\nfirst jump into it so that's really like\nthe idea behind the new guide um how\nwe're kind of structuring it and um\nthere's still like the original features\nwe have so we still do have the\nmeditation index here um where you can\nlook at all the meditations um we do\nhave an improved\nglossery and uh we do have like favorite\nvideos where you can come in here and\nyou know favorite specific videos that\nyou are interested in and come back to\nthem\nlater okay so Brandon I muted you for a\nsecond um so I I want to just tell y'all\na couple of\nthings um so Brandon you can stay in the\ncall if you want to but I'm I'm going to\njust talk for a second so the the other\nthing that we wanted to do or actually\nI'm going to hop out of the call um the\nother thing that we what we're kind of\nmoving\ntowards is there are a couple of things\nto consider right so\nuh one is so if we if we try to\nunderstand what's wrong with people's\nmental health in the world today so\nthere's some lack of information right\nso if we go back to like this YouTube\ncomment right this is kind of like\nliving life\n101 right that's we're trying to address\nthat with some of these things like this\nvideo like this video I was so happy it\ndid well it's like 800,000 views a month\nago and it's not like some you know\nfamous guest or something like that\nsubstitute for like external success\nlike there's no substitute for security\nthere's no substitute for Financial\nFreedom there's no substitute for like\nthese real world things and so we built\nthat program because we realized that\npeople need help building their careers\nand that will have a positive impact on\ntheir mental health and this is just as\na psychiatrist I realized like and I\nstarted doing this work a lot with my\npatient so when I had someone who was\nrecovering from an addiction I I'm\nworking on a lecture on this but just\nthe phases of addiction recovery but\nwhat I realized is that like ultimately\nthis person if they want to stay sober\nthey have to have a life that is worth\nliving so the core reason why people\nkeep on relapsing or not the reason one\nreason that I saw is that the cost of\nthe relapse subconsciously is not very\nhigh there's a big difference between I\nI'm unemployed and I'm trying to get\nsober and like let me just get high this\nweekend or let me get hammered this\nweekend like whatever I can pick things\nup later and and so once people really\nhave something that is valuable to them\nand get gets negatively affected by\ntheir behaviors that's when I really saw\nlong-term sobriety become easier for\npeople because I if you think about kind\nof and I know I'm going off on a tangent\nI swear I'll come back but if you kind\nof think about like on a given weekend\nright unless you have a life that is\nlike full of joy and where you're\nprogressing towards things and stuff\nlike that like what's really the cost\nit's so easy to procrastinate on putting\nyour life together if there are\nsubstances\ninvolved so we kind of were like okay\nwe're going to teach yall some stuff\nthrough things like lectures streams\nwhatever and then there's coaching to\nhelp you accomplish your goals in a\nevidence-based kind of like Tim limited\nperiod And I think that's the real value\nis like it's not that you need it it's\nthat the question is so so I recently\nstarted working with a swimming coach\nand why did I do that because I wanted\nto get better at swimming within like\none month like I was like instead of\njust watching random ass YouTube videos\nI'm going to invest the time and energy\nbecause I want to be a proficient\nswimmer like 30 days from now not like\nwhenever the hell I get around to it\nright and that's really what the value\nis is the other thing that I noticed in\npeople's lives is that I think our field\nin Psychiatry and even in public health\nlike when I hear people talking about oh\nthere's a mental health crisis like I I\ndon't get the sense that people really\nunderstand the urgency and maybe that's\nmy projection but that like lives are\nbeing ruined in 90day intervals like 90\ndays is what it takes to get a set of FS\non your TR that\nwill that is like permanent Health\ndamage that's not like temporary damage\nthat you can heal that's like we're\ngoing to drop down from 100 Max HP to\nlike 90 Max HP you're your life will be\npermanently harder because of that and\nthat's the real urgency that that makes\nme focus on very like time intense uh\ntime valuable efficient\ninterventions so that's the other thing\nby the way that we wanted to build is we\nwanted to build interventions so that\nit's not just talking about mental\nhealth and like hey take my course I I\ngot some advice many years ago that hey\nlike all you should do is like build\ncourses and you'll be rich overnight and\nlike that's fine like we do build\ncourses and we try to make them as\naffordable as possible because they're\npurchased people in 121 countries which\nis a win in our book um and at the same\ntime like I don't know if you guys know\nthis but like you know courses on the\ninternet don't usually run 20 or 25 or\n30 or for 35 $40 they usually run like\nhundreds of dollars if not thousands of\ndollars and we very intentionally made\nthe decision to not price things that\nway so going back to where we're\ngoing so right in the fields is really\ninteresting because it is the first\nexample of us trying to incorporate a\nskills building competence-based\ncomponent that is not coaching so the\nfeedback that we got about coaching is\nthat some people can't afford it which\nis understandable we try to you want\nsomething you want\nthis\num\nokay all right so\nth this is kind of where where we're\ntrying to go with right in the fields is\nlike I think the next thing that we need\nto build is something that\nis\npersonalized and more Dynamic so now we\nhave like this body of knowledge and we\nhave certain interventions that we think\nwill help people actually train the\nskills now the problem is we have so\nmany different people who have so many\ndifferent questions and interested in so\nmany different things it does doesn't\nwork I don't know if this makes sense Dr\nK showing up and answering a particular\nquestion on this particular thing on\nlike April 8th doesn't fix the problem\nso what we really need to\nbuild is we what we really need to build\nis something that as\nDynamic assembles all the crap that we\nhave taught about and serves people up\nwith what you need and that's why I\nthought it was so great that what\ntrinian is building is like the guide Is\nFundamental I mean it's still and linear\nand you can go through all of it but the\nkey thing is that you can show up you\ncan figure out okay what questions\nmatter to me we've spent literally two\nyears on the research side developing\nlike looking at evidence-based validated\nquestionnaires and trying to figure out\nif someone comes in and says I struggle\nwith my mental health what is the\nsmallest number of questions to ask them\nto where we can use a validated\ninstrument to detect what your problems\nare even if you're not aware of it\nand then using that set that battery of\nquestions which we're trying to minimize\nbecause who the [ __ ] likes filling out\nsurveys then what we're going to do is\ndirect you to the right kind of content\nand then this is where the the last\nthing so that piece is like completely\nnew and then the the last piece that is\nalso completely new is we've got the\nvideos we don't have any way to direct\npeople to the right videos and then the\nnext thing is what are the interventions\nthat we can build where once you're done\nwatching the video you have information\nbut you don't necessarily have\nbehavioral change you don't have a boost\nto your EQ that's what right in the\nfields does right so right in the fields\nhas a really cool exercise called\nempathy labs and there's literally\nsomething called mentalization based\ntherapy which is very very useful for\npeople who are like narcissistic and in\nmentalization based therapy what we do\nis people who are narcissistic cannot\nunderstand what someone else's\nexperiences and if we look at like all\nof these problems that people are having\naround loneliness and social isolation\nand like inability to form relationships\nand tired of making small talk what we\ncan literally do is level up your EQ\nthrough something like empathy labs and\nso we're developing these kinds of\nthings where I think the next iteration\nis going to be right now we do content\nand we do coaching and coaching is very\nvery value driven and it is still out of\nthe reach of of a lot of people in our\ncommunity so for Content we have some a\nlot of free content and then some amount\nof paid content I don't think the paid\ncontent can really get any cheaper it's\njust it just can't economically but then\nthere's a there's another thing that's\nmissing which is okay if you want to\nlike put together your life how can we\ndirect you to all the right videos how\ncan we even understand what your\nproblems are using validated instruments\nthat you may not know and then how can\nwe develop some kind of tool that in a\nfocused manner allows you to practice\nand improve whatever you're working on\nand so that's kind of like the next big\niteration for us so a lot of this stuff\nand so but things are like one step at a\ntime right and then there's like outside\ncrazy stuff like people were like\nokay so when when we posted you know the\nname of this\nvideo and um and then this kind of\nhappened you know like it's official\nwe're headed to the ranch and as much as\nI want to do that I think that's also\nwhere like if we wanted to do that you\nknow we would we would have to you know\nthat takes a lot of money like I was\ntalking to cruy the other day but she\nwas kind of explaining to me that most\ncompanies that end up where we are today\nwith the amount of users engaged the\nnumber of people who are like have gone\nthrough coaching the number of people on\nDiscord who have a YouTube channel the\nsize that we are the average investment\nfor a com investment for a company like\nthis is between 20 and $100 million yeah\nand I don't know if you guys have like\nyou know if you followed some of these\nother\nuh so like let's just see if we can\nfind that was the top\narticle um we I just wanted to find the\nWikipedia ju just to give y'all like is\nthis not in Wikipedia\nno oh God okay um so like I don't know\nif yall have ever heard of like para\nTherapeutics but para Therapeutics\nstarted maybe I don't know a couple of\nmaybe a year oh founded in\n2013 um and and so para Therapeutics was\nlike this company that was built out of\nI think Boston and like they were all\nabout something called digital\nTherapeutics so they're like we're going\nto take Psychotherapy and we're going to\nlike turn it into an app and they raised\nI don't know how much they they raised\nbut um they went bankrupt it was over100\nMillion right so para Therapeutics like\nraised a hundred million or over100\nmillion and then like you know like it\nkind of went bust which is sort of\nwhat's going on right now so a lot of\nthese oh sorry go\nahead no I just want to find the actual\ninformation\num yeah but they were operating on\nlosses over a hundred million doar so\nthey\nthey made 12.7 million in Revenue in\n2022 and lost\n$123.4 million so I think maybe where\nthis is going\nis you know if we wanted to do this the\nway everybody else did this we would be\ntrying\nto we would be doing a few things we\nwould be really trying to play with\ninsurance systems which I think we all\nknow you don't get the best care when\ninsurance is paying for it um one of the\nreasons why companies like pair go under\nis because if payers or insurers don't\nwant to adopt what you're doing and\nthat's what you're completely dependent\non you can't you can't play in that\nspace so essentially all all we're\ntrying to say is for us to truly do this\nour way for us to truly say we want to\nbuild things for and with\nthis\ncommunity um we have to have our own\nkind of Economics behind it we can't we\ndon't want to depend on investors we\ndon't want to depend on donations we\ndon't want to overprice and underd\ndeliver we don't want to do any of that\nso what we're trying to say is as you\nsee things change if um I think we\nraised\nour module the pric can I jump in yeah\nso I I think I think people are super\nconfused like people are asking\nquestions like are are we going bankrupt\nso you're so chaotic okay let me let me\nlet let me let me tell yall what what's\ngoing on so here's here's where we're\ncoming so I I I think we're we're\nshowing these I'm just showing that as\nan example we're not about to go\nbankrupt okay so let me let me tell\ny'all what's going on so we started this\nwe started this to help y'all I think we\ndid really well we also built it to be\nsustainable right so this is where like\nin b basically like the the one thing\nwe've tried to avoid and I'm not saying\nwe won't do this in the future but we've\ntried very carefully to be beholden to\ny'all right so when we because like\nthink about it so this is where so when\na startup starts right they get money\nfrom a couple of different places either\nyou can go to the nonprofit route which\nI know a bunch of people are big fans of\nI'm not a big fan of it because when you\nhave a donor for whom you are dependent\non for the survival of your Enterprise\nand the donor walks in and says I want\nto start doing this you don't get to say\nno so like even compared to investors I\nthe i' I've worked very heavily with two\nnonprofits and my experience with them\nis that that's when you actually have\nthe least creative control for the\ndirection of what the organization does\nbecause if the donor says something\nthat's what you do right they provide\nthe money so that's what who you're\nbeholding to you can take capital\ninvestment and in the case of capital\ninvestment it's good in a lot of ways a\nlot of people do it for good reasons\nright and I think if we had taken\ncapital investment we would have been\ntwice as big or three times as big or\nwhatever like that's the whole point of\nit but then\nstill it's like then someone has a\nfinancial interest in this that comes at\nthe cost of the\ncommunity and then the other option that\nwe've got is sponsorships so that's\nwhere like to be blunt we turn\ndown sponsorships that are in order of\nmagnitude High than what we accept from\nmany people and the reason we do that is\nbecause it doesn't feel right right so\nlike for example if I were to take let's\njust say hypothetically like a gambling\nsponsorship those pay a lot or a crypto\nsponsorship those pay a lot and we\nchoose not to take those so we want to\nbe sustainable we don't want to be\nbeholden to someone else we don't want\nto take that gambling sponsorship I'm\nfine with raid Shadow Legends T TBH so\nyou guys have seen more sponsorships on\nour Channel and we're doing that because\nhere's the question is like where does\nthe money come from the more money we\ntake from sponsors the more we can build\nstuff at a reduced cost or free so if we\ndon't take if we don't sell out to\nsponsors then we got to sell out to\nsomeone the money's got to come from\nsomewhere and our our choice so far on\nbalance has been we're going to build\nstuff that yall want and we're going to\nbe beholden to\ny'all that's it there's no and then if\nyou guys want a ranch then we need like\nway way way way way more money which I'm\nnot suggesting that we do because I\ndon't even know what the [ __ ] would\nhappen there um but it's like it's\nbasically like well the main thing that\nwe're going to try to build and there's\nnothing there's not anything after this\nthe main thing that we want to build or\nthe point of this stream is to tell yall\nwe're migrating more towards this model\nof like okay let's understand what your\nneeds are a little bit better and let's\nbuild more stuff on the skills side the\nskills building side accountability side\nso that people are actually like\nimplementing those changes that's very\ndifferent from working with a coach and\nme making\nlectures\nso this is this is where people are\nsaying what's wrong with crypto and and\nyou're right so here's the challenge\nthat we face I want yall to just think\nabout this for a second okay so whatever\ndecision we make one slice of our\ncommunity is going to be unhappy because\nsome people are like yeah you should\nabsolutely like I live in a developing\ncountry I can't afford much fair enough\nright I think on balance it's way better\nif you can take $10 million from an\nexclusive streaming deal on a different\nplatform that shall shall remain\nunnamed right if you take an exclusive\nlike sure if it builds me free stuff and\nI'm living in like Bangladesh like go\nfor it like what the hell do I care you\ncan go ahead and do that on the flip\nside other people will be like no this\nis not right you guys should be a\nnonprofit and so then that's totally\nfine but then like our operations would\nbe way different if we were a nonprofit\nlike I don't think we would produce half\nas much cont I think we would have\nproduced half the content if even my gut\ncheck is we would produce five times\nmore if we took capital investment twice\nas much or three times as much if we\ntook just whatever sponsorship came in\nthe door right like we could but we\nchoose not to and so our goal in today\nit's not we're we're not we're not\nstressed out or anything it's we're\ntelling y'all right so the like and\nwhere does it come from and we kind of\ndecide we'd rather build half as much\nbut be careful about who we take as\nsponsorships not take capital investment\nand then charge yall money for what we\nbuild because I think that's when you\nactually get the best relationship\nbecause there isn't a third party like\nthis is what we [ __ ] see in the\nAmerican Insurance system is like doctor\nthinks that a patient needs something\npatient likes it or doesn't like it the\ntwo of y'all are involved and y'all can\neither work it out or not\nrobertino Rober oh wow hey\nTino how are you doing\nman that's great so Tino is a very good\nfriend of mine from Medical School who's\nalso an amazing\npsychiatrist and um it's cool to see how\nyou're doing bro I will text you later\nthanks for stopping by um and so the the\nmain thing that we want to tell youall\nis and and that's fine so any given\nperson can say I think this is the way\nthat you should do it which is fine our\nexperience unfortunately has been that\nwhatever we do some group of people\nthinks that we should be doing it\ndifferently which is they're not wrong\nit's just this is the reason we do it\nthis way and um what we really want to\nbuild we want to build more for y'all so\nthe other per purpose of this is like to\ntell y'all what we're thinking right so\nthere's one more guide coming out I\nstarted working on another book um we\nare going to continue with memberships\nbecause I think people are finding like\nreally really immense value out of that\nuh we understand and acknowledge\nthat because there's\nvalue other people may benefit from it\nas well and we're not deaf to that\nfeedback at all it's just trying to\nfigure out okay like how do we make this\nwork for people who can't afford it and\nwe're working on it\nactively um and then yeah if you guys\nwant to Ranch like you know someone\nneeds to Pony up $100 million and then\nwe'll do\nit or we can go the slow slow way and\nwe'll we're going the slow steady\nsustainable way but okay\nhere's okay you take a breath I'm done\ngood all right\nso just on kind of how we're evolving\nand how we're changing I just want to\nmake it like really simple nothing\nnothing dramatic is happening um\nessentially we are seen the need to\nraise prices so we're raising some\nprices I think we really dramatically\nunderpriced during the pandemic um again\nwe wanted to meet people where they're\nat we didn't want to charge thousands of\ndollars for courses and stuff like that\nso but we do need\nto steer the ship right and again\nthere's about 200 people um behind\nhealthy gamer at this point so we are\nraising the prices on the guides we are\nadding more coaching types and um there\nare there should be I think more\ncoaching spots coming next week there\nare some now we are really investing a\nlot I think in two core areas one is the\nHG\nInstitute okay my closer it is it's look\nI can touch it with my chin it's right\nin my face I maybe you speak louder\nokay all right\nso two core areas of investment going\nforward one is with the HG Institute so\nthe HG Institute is an accredited\ncontinuing education platform so the\ncoolest thing like our Dream right is\nthat you guys can work with therapists\nand like real mental health\nclinicians who understand the HG way and\nthe Institute is accredited by the\nAmerican Psychological Association by\nthe social work social worker board and\nwe're working on a couple more\naccreditations one is also with um naak\nwhich is the addictions group they are\nthe ones who run the peer support\ncertifications so we're really um\ninvesting a lot in kind of that AOE of\nnow teachers\ntherapists other people can learn the\nhealthy gamer way\nand employ that in their own practice so\nreally excited about that it's very\nresource intensive it is\nvery I don't know if you guys are\nfamiliar with Health Care regulations\nbut like every state has their own\nlicensing it is is just the most\nbureaucratic ridiculous thing but I\nreally think it's going to be worth it\nin the end to spread what we know to\nother people who work with young people\nand then another big area is in this\ncommunity layer so we started with\nmemberships um we're wanting to create\nmore kind of experiences so we have the\nguides and we're adding the trauma\nmodule that'll be ready for pre-sale\nnext week so we're really excited about\nthat one coming out\num but the real kind of what we've heard\nis skill skills right we do a lot of\nteaching and content and we are working\non coaching where people can kind of\ncreate those lasting changes but what\nwe're really hearing is the need for\ndeveloping skills so that's why right in\nthe fields is so great because it's\nreally teaching EQ and EQ skills so\nwe're wanting to invest more in this in\nthis community layer through memberships\nand other things\n[Music]\num that's I think the long in short of\nkind of where we're going I would really\nlove to open the floor for questions so\nI think we're going to just kind\nof gravitate towards chat um and Tech\nteller did you want to run any polls or\nget any\ninput feel free\nto all right will The Institute ever be\naccredited in other places than the US\ngreat question that's why we're working\nwith naak um naak is an international\norganization so they do addiction\nsupport internationally yes we do want\nit to be accredited\ninternationally can you specify new\npricing yes\nso of all like we wanted to kind of show\nyou guys how much work is going on\nbehind the scenes right we wanted to\nshow you how much work the developers\nare putting in to mobile experiences to\nnew F features and functionality all\nthat good stuff where we we raised\nprices by $5 across the healthy gamer\nportfolio so guides were $25 a module\nthey're now 30 a module coaching was um\nstarting at $30 per session which is now\nat $35 per session so so I I regret to\ninform you all that now the guide is\nofficially more expensive than horse\narmor DLC in Diablo\n4 and this was a generally speaking when\nwe're trying to think about the value\nthat we deliver with products we really\nask\nourselves does this help people more\nthan horse armor\ncosmetics in an action game and you know\nI have to say that this was a huge\npersonal loss to me because I feel like\nwhen I think about the value of horse\narmor DLC I don't know if the trauma\nguide can match\nit because just think about how\nbeautiful that horse looks with the\nhorse\narmor okay I'm going to take the mic\nback\num\nokay um the main thing is I wanted to\nalso\ngeez all right any questions\nguys all\nright I\nthink I'm hoping that this is where we\ncan kind of stabilize on pricing I\nreally we really want to keep things\naffordable I realize kind of with every\nprice increase that means some people\nget left behind but that's why we're\nalso trying to do things that are like\n10 bucks a month um so people can kind\nof join in when they can and they can\ntake a break very easily hey you can uh\nfind questions in the YouTube chat if\nyou switch from the top chat questions\nwe have QA going on oh perfect live chat\ntop\nchat no you have it questions top chat\nlive\nchat oh no we don't see questions\n[Music]\nuh maybe it's not uh I think you know\nwhat I think I know how to find it let\nme see if it's over here can\nyou also yes you guys are getting a\nbehindth scenes look at what it's like\nto work with Alo it really takes like 20\nyou hum to try to draw a slack dm with\nfrom Alo to make everything actionable\nit is a\nno the problem is that the plugin the\nchat plug-in on OBS I don't think has\nthe same\nfunctionality okay so we need a pop out\nlink and then we'll find questions oh\nthat's the problem if I'm on this side\nof the mic does that\nhelp you need a new mic why is this\nstill a problem because we' had the\nproduction company out here like three\ntimes I know and they got me they got\nthat amplifier thing which makes gives\nit a buzz so we that didn't\nwork so that's do you want to see Al's\nperformance\nreview\nokay all right maybe we'll do that we'll\ndo Alex's performance\nreview I see fan funding you know he got\nkicked out of all of our management\nmeetings\nI do not belong there no it was such a\nmess he has been stripped of all of his\ndirect reports he has\nbeen kicked out of all of management\nmeetings um but really we\njust as you guys would say we want to\njust let him cook that's the\ngoal\nmeets expectations most of the time\nyes uh the I see a question do I have to\nbuy the new modules separately so if\nyou're already a customer I believe you\nwill get if you already have purchased\nthe guide you will get I think preferred\npricing on\nlaunch\num I don't know the complete details\nthere but if you already have the guides\num you'll be getting an email\nthat lays out what the pricing looks\nlike but we do have some um preferred\npricing for current customers again if\nyou bought modules before at 25 bucks we\nwant to like kind of Honor that that's\nthe value\nexchange what is happening to the module\nbundle so we always like to bundle\nthings discount it so right now you get\nfour modules for 100 when the trauma\nmodule comes out I believe you will get\nfive for\n120 bye methane sorry yeah we're talking\nshop here\ntoday oh of course you keep the old\nguide um I think everything will be\nupdated to the new interface but I'm not\ntran would have details there\non if it's a forested update or if you\ncan update on your\nown loyalty pricing that's exactly\nthat's exactly right any new book in the\nworks um yeah he's writing a no don't\ntell don't tell him what's it's about\nit's secret okay that scared me so\nloud okay okay I've I've heard the\nrequest for regional pricing a lot I I\ndon't know how to do that and and we are\nbuilding so many things that really\npricing should be appropriate it's going\nto be on the higher side for some\ncurrencies but we don't we don't have\nthat ability for regional pricing right\nnow um non- English yes we\nare about to release the guides in\nSpanish and we're doing it kind of one\nat a\ntime\nokay\nokay can I pay with my HSA we are\nworking on ways to do that um again it's\nthrough the Institute and it's going to\nbe kind of a\n[Music]\nlong I don't know bureaucratic road but\nwe are working on ways for your people\nto use their benefits to be able to\npurchase healthy gamer\nresources essentially there's we're\nworking really hard on how to plug in\nlike our funky little experiment that is\nhealthy gamer into the larger mental\nhealth ecosystem like one day I would\nlove to have therapists Med management\nlike in-person experiences I would love\nto do the full stack um we just got to\nget there kind of Step by Step instead\nof trying to do everything all at once\nwe've we've kind of tried to be\nambitious and do many things at the same\ntime and it just doesn't go as well for\nus so we want to be able to really do\nthings super well one thing at a time\nand the rest of the year is really\naround The Institute and\ncommunity so what is the HG Institute\nexactly I believe the website is hg-\ninstitute.com um HD Institute\nessentially says okay here is what we\nthink therapists should know before they\nstart working with this\ncommunity so it takes kind of a lot of\nthe same principles and ideas but it\npackages it up for clinicians so\nclinicians can get credit for their\ncontinuing education\nrequirements and we can um help\ntherapists do great work with young\npeople we've heard so much from\ntherapists saying hey I really want to\nimplement this stuff in my own practice\nand we've heard so much from the\ncommunity hey I tried therapy it really\ndid not go well so I think there's an\nacknowledgement in the therapy world\nthat like hey we don't really know how\nto work with young people as well as we\nshould and so we said\nhey we think we can help and so we are\ntrying to help therapists help\nyou um how do you guys not have merch we\nhave merch we are just not very good at\nmerch um but we have\nit yeah and and related to that part of\nthe reason I mean so merch is is great\nlike honestly it's great like don't get\nme wrong but we're we're\npretty focused on trying to primarily\noffer value if y'all are purchasing\nsomething so like I love the hoodies\nlike the hoodies are great I like merch\nthere's nothing wrong with it but if\nwhen I when I really think about it it's\nlike what do we want to invest if we're\ngoing to charge all 30 bucks for\nsomething do I do we want to prioritize\nthe merch store or do we want to\nprioritize building a guide to trauma\nand that's where the merch store just\ndoes not the merch store\nlike yeah we just haven't we haven't\nfigured out how\n[Music]\nto we we wanted to do more than sell\nt-shirts but I would like to actually\nhave some better merch on there can you\nplease go back to chat what are you\ndoing I'm going to chat okay I'm trying\nto get to chat but okay twitch is\nshowing me ads on your own stream yes I\nit's\nyeah so I'm GNA have to figure out sorry\nwe have to watch our own there we are\nokay there's so\nlet's I see it's the top right arrow\nthank\nyou you're the best I am indeed\nokay um there was a great question that\nI\nwas there double chats\nanswer could we offer jepa Mala in merch\nit is it is hard to find legit ones we\nhave been trying for three years um to\nput together meditation kits for the\nmerch store with like a good yoga mat\ngood incense good candles like good\nstuff um but I don't want to sell you a\n$200 meditation kit that has like stupid\nstuff in it you know what I mean I want\nto we haven't been able to price it the\nway we want to price it and find the\nstuff that we want to find but we we are\nworking on it yeah so just to give you\nall just a we got it we we can't both\nanswer all the questions no no but this\nis worth this is cool okay so like if\nyou want to verify the authenticity of\nrudra right which is often times used in\nmalas you actually have to x-ray it so\nlike the quality controls for some of\nthis stuff which like I know there's\nprobably not science to it but I really\ndo believe that some of these things are\nlike like D and D in video games like\nhave magical powers that give you like a\nplus 10 to your meditation check or\nwhatever so so you know part of building\nsome of this stuff is like we want to\nfind like high quality stuff and that's\nlike hard to\ndo um yeah good good rudrax is like hard\nto come by so like a good rudrax Mala\nlike you know is\nis I think at least $50 and then there's\nalso the concern of like okay what if\npeople can't afford it so then then what\ndo we do um yeah so people are saying\nthuli over rudra and that makes a lot of\nsense right so thuli is way easier to\nget and then it's like before we start\nthere some of this stuff is honestly my\nfault because then what what I'm trying\nto do is is understand really what the\nattributes of each of these kinds of\nmalas is because everyone says use\nrudrax but you can use suard you can use\nRosewood you can use crystal you can use\ndifferent kinds of stone and so I'm I'm\nI'm going to show you all a couple of\nbooks in a second but I'm doing research\nand trying to figure out what are the\nactual like if you use a particular\ncrafting material what is the spiritual\nbuff that you get I'm going to let her\nanswer more questions while I show y'all\nwhat I've been\ndoing also TR if you're around and want\nto take any of the specifics in chat um\nplease feel free\nto\nsomebody asked for PayPal we do have\nPayPal\num somebody asked for PayPal we do have\nPayPal on the guides but we don't have\nPayPal for coaching um because PayPal I\ndon't believe lets us set up\nrecurring\nbilling so it's just kind of\nlogistically very\ncomplicated\nCanada no membership access okay we'll\nlook into\nthat is this his lady yeah I'm Mrs K hi\nnice to meet\nyou you still can't hear me this is wild\nokay\nwill it still be called healthy gamer\nwhen healthy Creator comes out yeah\nhealthy Creator is kind of a spin-off\nbrand um but what we do is pretty core\nso I\nwouldn't yeah the healthy gamer brand is\nkind of here to\nstay where can we go as Community to\ngive feedback our opinions whatever on\nanything so we watch the Reddit um it's\nkind of you know\na double-edged sword because usually the\nmost inflammatory stuff on Reddit gets\nto the top so it's you\nknow pretty accusatory and pretty\nhostile but we're we're kind of always\nlistening we look at comments on YouTube\nour internal slack channel is always\nlike hey did you see this comment I\nthink this person makes a great Point\nthese people are asking for this kind of\ncontent can we do this can we do that\num so we're we're kind of always\nlistening this stream honestly is in\nresponse or not really we like to\ncommunicate with you guys\nevery every quarter or so\num but this is a great Avenue to ask\nwhatever you want to\nask yeah just just piggy backing off of\nthat I I think this is this is I mean\nthis is why we do things like this right\nso the goal of the stream today is for\nus to share a little bit about what\nwe're\nthinking um so you all have some context\nfor some of the direction that HG is\ngoing and also for yall to ask questions\nand stuff like that so I see a couple\nother questions so I just want to show\nyou all so I'm doing research so two of\nthese books are by David froley thric\nyoga and monra the Primal sound and then\nthe really interesting thing if you\nreally want answers in this you actually\nhave to go back to like the puranas so\nsomeone asked me a question\nrecently about um reincarnation so more\npeople are asking\nabout like how do I access past\nlives so I'm not sure is the short\nanswer but we have to kind of dig\ndeep um and I'll just give youall an\nexample so like there's a chapter in the\ngur puran where he talks about the\nprocess of\nrebirth\num\nso like this\nis St is\nhilarious\nokay\num those with a positive credit to their\nultimate account get birth in Noble or\ngood houses they are conceived on the\neighth day after the menes of their\npotential mother the culation on the\nEighth Day ensures birth of sons\nthereafter the population on the even\nnumber of days results in the birth of a\nmale child and on odd days daughters\nokay that's too much information for you\num so the kind of productive period is\nhardly available for any other species\nthe woman should have Sweet Edibles on\nthe fifth day and refrain from eating\nbitter and astringent or spicy\nfood so there there's all kinds of weird\nstuff in here right and like this stuff\ndoesn't have a good index and like a lot\nof it is super wild like there's all\nkinds of stuff about all kinds of things\nand so it's kind of fun for me because\nI'm digging because this stuff isn't\nindexed so these a lot of these things\nare pass through through oral\ntradition and um you\nknow in retrospect it's not like I gave\nyou Sweet Edibles the fifth day after\ncopulation which is why we've got two\ngirls that's where we went wrong I\nwouldn't say that's going wrong I mean\nif you should be giving me Sweet Edibles\nand you are not giving me Sweet Edibles\nI would say that we are going wrong yes\nokay um there were a couple of questions\nuh that I wanted to get to that were\nmore serious so first is are we going to\nbuild more guides absolutely so um you\nknow we're building them basically as\nfast as we can just to give you all some\ncontext uh you know building one guide\ntakes about eight weeks of scripting\ntime so there's research time and then I\nwrite for about 8 weeks the the size of\na guide in terms of script is basically\nequivalent to one non-fiction book so\nthe final manuscript of how to raise a\nhealthy gamer was about the same size as\nlike a guide\nscript so you all can think about the\ninvestment is basically the time it\ntakes me to write a I mean a book is\nmore in in many ways because there's\nediting and all this other crap so we're\ngoing to build more guides um I'm\nleaning towards something\naround so we're probably going to build\na guide to addiction next because that's\none that we need to do at some point and\nthen the other one that I really want to\nbuild is like sex communication and\nrelationships and then we may build\nsomething on gender specific mental\nhealth as well so those are the kinds of\nthings don't don't don't do this don't\nlog in no not here we can't type um if\nyou want to do this then we should go\nhere so we are we want to build more\nguides for sure it's just about what we\ndo\nwhen um we are thinking about trans\npositioning to more of like a monthly\nsubscription I I'm interested in what\nyour thoughts are about that instead of\nlike a onetime pay kind of thing would\nthat help or would\nthat I don't know do you want to just\nkind of pay for it once and be done I\npersonally hate monthly subscriptions so\nyeah that's why so I I don't I mean\nbecause also right like we're one of the\nfew people on the internet who continues\nto do this I mean memberships I think is\na little bit different because the whole\ngoal of that is like for it to be\nlongitudinal and stuff like that it's\nalso way cheaper but um yeah so like\nthat was something that we you know we\ngot a lot of advice to do the opposite\nright because everyone's moving to\nsubscription model but thank God that we\neven have people on our Dev team who are\nlike the subscription model is evil yeah\nno we like we so\nmuch our Dev team is awesome and I think\na lot of a lot of why we do what we do\nis because we're like monthly\nsubscriptions are annoying let's just do\none and done okay what's a good price\npoint for one and done and so the way we\nprice things\nis essentially to be able to give it to\nyou in something that's a little less I\ndon't know spammy scammy kind of thing\nright and and I want youall to just\nthink about this right so this is where\nwe get some credit because we did it is\na onetime purchase and I think somewhat\nreasonably priced and like cuz like you\nknow and and so we're we're committed to\ndoing that kind of stuff to fight the\ntide of of soulless\nwhatever um so many fights man you have\nto fight it dude it's so hard man it's\nlike so\nhard um so yeah addiction for sure and\nthen some something around communication\nand relationships and then something\naround gender specific struggles and\nthen something about sexuality like\nthose are all topics I think the other\nthing that we often times will explore\nis whether a guide is the best way to\nexplore a topic can I just get a sense\nof okay so we're doing the trauma module\ntrauma module comes out for\npre-sale next\nweek after that we're we're debating\nbetween addictions like behavioral and\nsubstance abuse um\nand sex dating relationships do you guys\nokay one\nfor addictions and two for communication\nrelationships can I just see like what\nyou guys would\nprefer one for addictions two for\nrelationships okay we got to be able to\nsee I I know I'm gonna just do what you\nwant\nI'm in control now\noh Lord help\nus right I'm seeing a lot of twos\nfrom I thought addictions all consists\nthat communication relationships no no\nno who's who\nsaid which guy poll\ncoming um\naddictions Communication in\nrelationships um\nsexuality male female mental\nhealth\nokay right so this\nis okay so addiction seems addiction\ncommunication and relationships are\nbasically\ntied we need a\ntiebreaker no I mean I I think then\naddictions will come first because I\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nbut uh I think um with that that's the\nreason that we have these resource packs\nand stuff so we're trying to like I know\nthat everybody wants everything and\nwe're trying to sort of get to it one at\na time uh the other thing that I've been\nreally wondering about is whether a\nguide is the best format to work on\ncommunication and relationships so the\nother super cool thing that I'm starting\nto appreciate is that we don't need a\nguide on all topics some things are\nbetter as a lecture we did our first\nWorkshop which went really really well\num you know that Workshop was fantastic\nand people got so much out of it and it\nwas\nalso difficult in some ways but I think\nI wonder if for for communication and\nrelationships whether there is a\ndifferent kind of thing because when I\nkind of think about communication and\nrelationships I really think about a\ngroup coaching format is ideal yeah so\nwhen I do like actual like I was\nthinking about starting another group\nrecently but um really specifically\naround\nrelationships and uh so because some\nstuff is like it's just hard to describe\nit some stuff like if you guys get to\npractice stuff and talk about your\nfeelings and other people listen to you\nand things like that I think there's a\nlot of potential there yeah so one idea\num Tech if you wanted to jump into chat\nand clarify this please feel free to but\none idea we had was evolving groups more\naround practicing social skills so yes\ndefinitely a discussion and talking\ncomponent but much heavier on the like\npracticing\ncomponent\num but but I definitely I definitely\nthink like communication relationships\nis so individual that you can have all\nthe theory in the world but you need to\nbe able to like practice it and run\nthings by people so that's why I like\ngroups for communic relationships\ntoo okay Al righty any other questions\nhow are we on time we're doing okay\nwe're okay I'm\ntime Bassie boy I hear you like get\nmaking friends as an adult is difficult\nhonestly all look all looks like my\nwingman at the playground he will like\ngo and be like she looks like she would\nbe a great friend to you I'm going to go\ntalk to her for you and he will like\npick up friends for me at the playground\nit is incredible but some of my best mom\nfriends\nare his\nwork spirituality module well we have a\nmeditation guide you know I was thinking\nabout either doing this on the\nmembership side or as a workshop but\nlike we did a cool course at HGI about a\nyear ago about developing\na personalized meditation\npractice it was a so this was a course\nat the\ninstitute for people who were like\ncoaches in mental health professionals\nso we all hear that okay like for these\nkinds of for these kinds of profession\nright oh like we all like people are\nteaching mindfulness now as\ntherapists um these professions have can\nbe like prone to emotional burnout so\nhow can we\nhelp the the people who are delivering\nMental Health Services develop their own\npersonalized meditation practice I think\nit\nwas it was one of the most scuffed\nthings that I ever put together had so\nmany problems and it was also like like\nreally really great for all the people\nlike there were a lot of things that we\ndidn't do right um just in terms of the\norganization and stuff but people got\nsuch immense value out of that I'm\nthinking about whether we should put\nthat together in some\nway\num yeah so so someone's asking uh how do\nyou even create a guide on interpersonal\nrelationships too many people at too\nmany stages of emotional intelligence or\nability and the\neventual romance desperate cringe\nyeah I I I hear you so I think that's\npart of what makes it challenging and\nthe reason even though people voted on\naddictions and communication\nrelationships the reason that addictions\nwill probably come first is because\nmaking a guide to addictions is way\neasier than making a guide to\ncommunication relationships so I've been\nworking on a guide to communication\nrelationships for three years and the\nproblem is like I don't know what to\ninclude and what not to include so\nthere's probably and we have I mean I\nwe're working on but I think it's like\nthis will happen and then we also sort\nof think about you know even things like\ntouch grass and Social Sandbox right so\nwe have we have so many things in our\ncommunity that are address those\nproblems it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe a guide but ideally and this is kind\nof where we're evolving right so I guess\nwe thought everyone thought that there\nwas some you know big change like we're\ngoing bankrupt or we're buying a ranch\nor whatever no it's just we're we went\nbankrupt because we bought a ranch so so\nthe main thing is that we're trying to\nbasically like the next phase of what we\nwant to do is combine things like\ninformation like guides with things like\nSocial\nSandbox which is very successful by the\nway right and it's like how can we\ncreate a situation where y'all can like\npractice and Implement changes increase\naccountability it's so his\naccountability is neurod Divergence\nabsolutely right\num\nyeah yeah so people may and I think a\nlot of this stuff so remember y'all that\nwe we don't have to make a guide about\neverything right so like I remember we\nhave I mean we make you know we have\nlike 800 or a thousand videos on our\nYouTube channel and so we\ncan so just to give you all an example I\nI'm working on two videos right now two\nlectures one on\nuh autism being an autistic woman and\nthe second is being a woman and having\nADHD because for example like uh girls\nget underdiagnosed with ADHD because\nthey tend to be less hyperactive and the\nhyperactive symptoms are the things that\nreally cause problems and lead to an\nearly diagnosis so girls are more likely\nto engage in a lot of compensatory and\nmasking behaviors which means that they\nget\nunderdiagnosed and so the other thing is\nthat's kind of wild is this hormonal\nmanifestations or hormonal changes that\nwill affect things like concentration\nand potentially even aspects of neurod\nDivergence so um there's a lot of like\nstuff there that needs to be talked\nabout so like one thing just to keep in\nmind no matter all this stuff that we do\nmore guides more memberships whatever\nlike our bread and butter of making free\nmental health content and putting it on\nthe internet on a weekly basis that is\ninspired evidence-based and high quality\nlike our commit to that is not\nchanging and I think it's just because\nwe're doing a so this is the key thing\nto understand we're not\nreplacing any of the stuff that we do\nfor free it's always in addition and\nthen the question is how do we fund that\nstuff so I've got a bank of like five or\nsix really great videos that I'm working\non right now lectures call them whatever\nyou want to there maybe one or two deep\nDives in there we haven't given up on\ndeep Dives right so we do them\noccasionally um and and so it not\neverything 2hour deep dive stream\nprobably takes like 12 hours to prepare\njust by the way yeah so gry was asking\nam I was I reading something and like\nyou know yeah I won't grab it's okay\ngreat hey I have a question for you guys\num so as we try to package up all of\nthis um content\nand these kinds of community\nevents um and also these like\nexperiential kind of skills-based\nprograms would you rather see that in an\napp or would you rather see that in like\na membership kind of model like would\nyou rather it just be available on your\ncontent platforms and be able to log in\nthat way or would you prefer in an\napp yeah can somebody that's not Al run\nthe pole Tech are you\nthere I think danana has things under\ncontrol on on Twitch all right cool I\nsee she is present and when she is\npresent I function normally yeah danana\nis a real one another person that's been\nwith us for over four years she doesn't\nknow how to pull I'm I'm on it danana oh\nno you don't have to do everything oh no\nI can do some things myself honestly the\nfact that all it can get from like this\nroom into okay a podcast with somebody\nelse is Al\ndenana I'm wondering if should we build\nan app essentially I've always thought\nno I think it's too much work to\nmaintain too much stuff and it's 2024\nwho needs another app but you know\nthere's a lot of added benefit because\nwe can do things\nexactly so the options are the way we\nwant would you rather see like a\nmembership that is on a patreon or a\nYouTube membership or something like\nthat or would you rather have it in an\napp should I remove this option yeah\nanytime you can simplify we\nsimplify app or\nmembership\nwebsite is the best no\ninstall keep cost down I\nagree I'm biasing you and I I'm almost\npositive if\num you know if like our product team was\nmore present here they would be able to\nargue all of\nthe you know extra features and\nfunctionality we could do with an app\nthe main thing that we really want to be\nable to do so we have I don't know if\nyall know this we have I think seven\nresearch studies going right now on the\nefficacy of all of our different\nprograms one thing we really want to\nbake in is like when you start this\nmembership experience or this monthly\nexperience kind of what does your\nBaseline mental health look like and\nthen what what real benefit what real\nworld outcome does this program Drive so\nwe're trying to put together a pretty\nsophisticated like learning model I\nguess like what we call like the client\num profile where we can really\nunderstand okay if by watching this guy\ndid did this person's ADHD actually get\nbetter did their depression actually get\nbetter um so we're trying to measure\nthat which I think is enabled by an app\nbut I'm wondering if we can do it\nwithout\nthat\nmobile compatibility for the platform\ntotally agree the developers have put a\nton in to make the guides more mobile\nfriendly so when the trauma module comes\nout um you're going to see a lot of\nenhanced mobile\nfunctionality and a lot better indexing\nand organization in\ngeneral Swanson yes we will be\ncontinuing to grow the coaching program\nokay well this has been super helpful\nand it's been really fun to kind of get\nto spend time with you guys I have a\nbunch of meetings and things that I need\nto get to do you want to wrap up with\neveryone sure I'll do that all right\ncool and you can take your chair out of\nthe room I appreciate it thank you for\nme I will take it yeah we got to figure\nout\nthis I mean these guys everybody works\nso hard here yeah so huge huge shout out\nyou know I know everyone's like oh\nvolume is low volume is low like I I\nthink it's we've had people come in and\nlook at the setup and we've changed out\ncan I just say one more thing yeah um\nplease check out the impact report I\ndon't know if you guys um if mods y'all\ncan link it in chat but we're really\nreally proud of everything that we got\nto accomplish last year and we're really\nexcited to grow The Institute and all of\nour community experiences this year\num always open to feedback the whole\npoint of this is to make stuff for you\nguys so it's been cool hanging out with\nyou\nbye yeah anger management you know it's\ngreat that you mention anger management\nso one of the really interesting things\nis that anger management is a\ntopic underperforms are you going to\nclean this ever\nyeah\never um so so I mean I get super excited\nlearning about anger there's I got a\ngreat book by uh\nAaron backck on anger which I thought\nwas good but like I don't know why it's\njust people don't seem to care about\nanger but we'll still continue making it\nright so this is also where we don't I\nwe make videos all the time that we\nthink won't perform well because we\nthink they should be\nmade\num I can't get\nout how did you get in I don't know\nmaybe made a mess on the way in which is\nwhy you can't get out well the the seven\nof cheese here yeah give me a second\nchat here I help I help a hostage yes\nthat's the way\nthat you\nguys if y'all can please yeah can we\nplease get all look to clean his\nroom he's Wheeling my chair out and on\nthe way this chair has picked up one\nmask like a CO\nmask three sets of\nkeys it's stumbled\nover I don't know like 12 piles of paper\nit's\ncrazy take take\nyour expose\nto if you keep exposing me then I may\nhave to feed you Sweet Edibles the fifth\nday\nafter your whatever men for after after\ncopulation generally speaking I find\nthat that feeding you sweet editables\nworks better before copulation but I\nwasn't reading the garad Bron\nexperience\nokay\num all\nright yeah I I mean some things are\nclean in my place and some things are\nnot clean I don't know if yall do this\nthis is what I do where when I clean\nsomething I make a mess first so I dump\neverything on the floor and I like\norganize it and then like I never\nfinish cleanliness is a core part of\nspirituality so right now my my place my\nroom is in this phase\nof it's just because I've been I've been\nlike just traveling so much I have like\ntwo media\nthings a\nweek\num\nI've been to like California New York\nlike over the last month which is\nawesome I'm not complaining but it's\nlike in the grand scheme of things I\nthink it's okay to be messy during this\nparticular period And I actually clean\nthis morning because now I'm like back\nand then this week weekend I'm going to\njust be making stuff it's going to be Dr\nK\ngoing\num Okay so I think we're at time for the\nday uh sorry we didn't get to\neverybody's questions but you know I\nguess we should have been pretty clear\nthere's not the way we were talking at\nthe beginning that everyone was like oh\nmy God what's happening what's are you\nall bankrupt no we're not\nbankrupt um we're just sharing with yall\nbecause we this used to be a lot more\norganic the community used to be way\nsmaller right so it's like the same 200\npeople are showing up and we're thinking\nthrough things together and like I could\nfollow what chat said and now things\nhave changed a little bit we've got\nbigger teams we're trying to do more and\nwe you know it's very helpful for us to\nknow what yall want because everything\nthat we build is you know not it's not\nlike we're sitting there and like we're\nlike oh you know what I think the people\nreally need they need a really they need\nthey really want $25 horse armor DLC\nthat's what the people need so that's\nwhat we're going to build so we we tend\nto actually ask y'all hey what do yall\nwant and and even with this stuff like\nwe're committed to trying to make as\nmuch mental health stuff resources\ncontent tools as we can and then it's\njust an issue of like okay do we do it\nif we do it one particular way we grow\nhalf as fast if we do it a different\nparticular way we grow twice as fast but\nwe make certain tradeoffs and that's how\nit is like karmically right so either\nyou you know you take that that\nsponsorship and you get that sweet sweet\ncrypto\ncoin and then we have more money to\nbuild free stuff but we've chosen not to\ndo that so we just wanted to share that\nperspective with yall we don't you know\nI know a lot of people have a lot of\ndifferent opinions our biggest problem\nis that y'all don't agree right so we're\nhappy to do what y'all want and that's\nusually what we do so even now like when\nyou'all say okay we want we want y'all\nto build these two guides those are the\ntwo things that I'm going to work on um\nand when y'all say we like you know\nplatform specific stuff as opposed to an\napp like that's what we'll lean into and\nthen it's some point there may be do\nthere may be some once there's a good\nenough reason we may migrate over but\nright now we're trying to build\neverything on the platform which which\nour Dev team has done an awesome\njob\num you know\nand cool you know people saying does\ndoes a couple of last questions uh yeah\nthat was my wife um someone saying I\nlike trains cool I've never the appeal I\nmean I like riding on\ntrains like I took a train in Europe\nonce from the Netherlands to France and\nit was like\namazing um does making HG bigger scare\nyou it doesn't scare me I like it less\nit makes things complicated and it means\nthat we have to spend brain power or I\nhave to spend brain power on things that\nI don't enjoy spending brain power on\nbut I'm not scared of it it's just so I\ndon't know if youall know this but we\nhad back in the day\nwe had a retreat we held an in-person\nRetreat and\num and like nine or 10 people 8 nine 10\npeople showed up from like all corners\nof I think the United States and Canada\nand we had been streaming for maybe\nabout a year and I was like we should\nhave a retreat there was like a 100\npeople or not not a year maybe it was\nsix months f it was great we like I\nrented out an\nAirbnb people just had to pay for their\nflights um and then it was like\nmanageable and like we cook together and\nwe like meditated together and we went\non Hikes and stuff together\num but we can't do that\nnow right\nso and it's cool because even even\npeople who now like work for us like\nthere were some of our I I want to say\nthat three or\nfour people from The Retreat like 40% of\npeople who came were working with us in\nsome way and now I think only one or two\nof those those people are left one\nperson has left and started their own\ncompany which is doing really well and\nthey're crushing it another person is\nhalfway through a PhD and they're doing\nreally well which is\ngreat um but we just can't it just gets\ncomplicated when things get\nbig\nbut\nyeah\nuh will the parenting course have\nadditions probably at some point but I\nthink we're trying to set up more of a\nrobust like Q&A kind of\nthing um so we're we're definitely\nseeing a lot of influx of people into\nour community because of the book and so\nthose people need support too so\nspeaking of other things that we're\nbuilding we're we're building more\nrobust resources to support parents\num are you worried that as you expand\nyour core message aim gets duded 100% it\nhas to see staying to your core message\nis a luxury that must be bought in\ncertain\nways so I I've seen the operations of\nmany different organizations including\nvery Missi driven\norganizations and\num you know there's there's\na you know anyway I'm not going to give\nexamples but absolutely right so like\nit's easy to hold a retreat and have it\nbe free when nine people are showing up\nand I have a doctor's salary it's hard\nto do that when there's like two million\nof y'all and we try to build a bunch of\nstuff for free so there are certain\nthere are certain like things that used\nto be simple which now become\ncomplicated and that's one of the things\nthat I've learned\nwhich is just the price of\ngrowth and um and the trauma module will\nprobably come out in about a\nmonth do you plan to always be the face\nof healthy gamer I certainly hope\nnot I never wanted to be the face of\nhealthy\ngamer\nyeah Melissa Starlight saying I I miss\nthe one-on-one with viewers I do too I\nmean honestly I I miss it a lot so like\nthere's a reason why we started with\nthat because that's what I personally\nfind gratifying and enjoyable like I\nlike just talking to people and then\nthis whole thing started so this is\nsomething that we've seen we've worked\nwith about 500 content creat\ncreators here at HG and what we always\nfind is the same pattern which is that\nthe bigger that you grow as a content\ncreator the less Freedom you\nhave but\nanyway\num yeah scaling is hard it\nis um yeah trauma module hopefully in\nabout a\nmonth\nso\nI think we did a didn't\nwe I show\nspeed oh yeah\ndude I'm down to do a stream with I show\nspeed let's do it Thor stream yes see\noriginal people who were back in the day\nyeah we got to work on that I owe y'all\na\nlot um it's\ngreat Mr Beast will give me the money\nyeah I mean we'll see\nTech teller is saying no no to what I\nshow speed or Mr\n[Music]\nBeast look so so generally speaking just\njust a quick reminder right about we're\ngenerally speaking we're we we're open\nto talking to many many many many people\nI'm not saying we're going to talk to\neverybody but like I think part of what\nI believe just as a psychiat in what\nI've learned is that like most people\nare fundamentally decent human\nbeings and that the majority of them are\njust trying to do the right thing and\nbased on the way that they've been\nraised or what they're struggling with\ninternally they that usually results in\na lot of behaviors that get harshly\njudged and so what we try to do here is\nhave conversations with people about\nwhat their experience of of being it\nwhat's it like to be in\nlife\nyeah so someone's saying I should just\ndo what\nI\num I should just do what I like limit\nthe people and just enjoy yourself I\nwish I had that luxury but I decided\nsome time ago that I get to enjoy some\nthings in life but this life is not\nprimarily for my enjoyment it's\nprimarily service and maybe that'll\nchange maybe one day I'll wake up and\nI'll say you know helping X number of\nwhether it's 100 a th000 10,000 a\nmillion I don't know how many people\nI've helped at this point I have no idea\nhow to quantify that maybe one day I'll\nwake up and I'll say that's enough but\nthat's that hasn't happened\nyet um so it's kind of weird but you\nknow cruy and I actually had a\nconversation about 6 eight months ago\nabout like what are we really entitled\nto in\nlife so like we could do things\ndifferently but why are we more\ndeserving\nthan so we work really hard and there's\na very common kind of idea that okay if\nyou work really hard you deserve good\nstuff which I'm I'm not against by any\nmeans and at the same time like do I\nwork any harder than like a single\nparent who's working two jobs and trying\nto support their family and like no I\ndon't think so I mean I've had plenty of\nthose people as my patients and they\nwork really hard\ntoo so I try to get what enjoyment I can\nwhere I can and I try to spend most of\nmy week like trying to make the world a\nslight better place because in my life\nthere were people who did that for me\nand that's the only way it\nworks um but I appreciate the sentiment\nhow can we be best support your mental\nhealth giving you\nmoney I wish the answer to that was yes\nbut I think my mental health is\nprimarily my responsibility but I\nappreciate the sentiment one thing I\nwill say is that I think one thing that\nI think people underestimate so people\nwill make comment ments they'll post\nthings in chat they'll post things on\nsubreddits they'll post things on\nYouTube comments I think often times\nwhen we post things on the internet we\ndo not think about how it affects the\nperson who's reading it or what we do is\nwe justify our actions based on some\nperception of what their life is like\nbecause this person did this it's okay\nfor me to be cruel to them it's so and\noften times we don't see it as cruelty\nwe see it as I'm being honest or I'm\nholding them accountable or they deserve\nthis but there's just a lot of nastiness\non the internet and I think just even\nbeing a content creator like sometimes I\nsee it right and I notice the effect it\nhas on me and it does have a very real\neffect and I think oftentimes When We\ncomplain we don't really think about we\nfeel fully justified in the complaint\nwhich is\nfine um but we oftentimes don't think\nabout the impact that it has on other\npeople so I'd encourage all of you to\nreally think about the impact of your\nwords and as best as possible try to be\nas nonviolent with them as possible so\neven if you had have feedback to give\nyou know just think about the people in\nyour life who the feedback is kind of an\nemotional attack and the feedback is\nwell thought out and comes from a place\nof positivity and this isn't just about\nme I mean I think I'm quite lucky and\nfor the majority of of our community is\nincredibly incredibly nice and that by\nthe way y'all deserve huge praise for\nbecause part of the reason I continue\ndoing this is because for every bad\napple there's like 99 of y'all that are\nawesome like I was eating a taco the\nother day and someone walked up to me\nand and was like hey are you Dr Kane I\nwas like yeah and he's like hey I\nappreciate the work you do it's helped\nme a lot and then we kind of stood there\nawkwardly for a little while and I was\nasking the person I was like hey do you\nwant a picture and he's like nah I'm\ngood I'm like hell yeah this bump\nbecause I never know if people sometimes\nwant pictures and it's like you can\nthat's fine you can ask I I don't I\ndon't mind but\nI I never know and people are super nice\nI've noticed that sometimes people will\nlike if I'm with my family they don't\nbother me or anything and I'm very\ngrateful for that um and if y'all do see\nme on the street like it's okay to say\nhi like that's fine I'm not I'm not so\nimportant that oh my God I can't say hi\nback and if I'm having a rough day I'll\nlet you\nknow but I I think really like the best\nthing that you can do for me um we've I\nI think we've made it clear today what\nwe do with the money or what we want\nmoney for but it's not to give us more\nmoney it's take the effort that we're\nputting in and build a life that's worth\nliving like utilize our resources that's\nhonestly what we're here for so what we\nthe reason we build it is for y'all to\nuse right so what's the best thing you\ncan do for someone who like makes you a\nsandwich is to eat the sandwich and try\nto enjoy it as best as\npossible you have guard and inflammation\nhow do you feel better what a great\nquestion maybe we'll start talking about\nthings like gir more um I did a lot of\nclinical work with people who had gird\nso it's weird I got all these like\nthere's a there's a video in the trauma\nguide about somatic\nillness um which we call kind of\npsychosomatic Illness but with gird it's\na little bit different but depends on\nthe source of your gird right so talk to\na doctor because we have things like\nproton pump inhibitors and things like\nthat that can help with a lot with gird\nbut there's also all kinds of cool stuff\nstuff on\nprobiotics so um studies show that like\nfor example kimchi or yogurt or uh\nwhat's it called um not just yogurt\nbut\nDoo what's the other name for it\ncfir not the lime leaves but cafir the\nyogurt based stuff there's some evidence\nthat some of these probiotic things can\nactually be good for gird but we've got\npretty good pretty good uh medicine for\nit if you guys just see a doctor and\nthen the last thing is for inflammation\nwe've got some stuff coming out we have\na video hopefully coming out soon on\nADHD and obesity which is like\nmindblowing um but there's a lot of\nstuff there's some stuff in there about\ninflammation um G is gastro sophal\nreflux\ndisease\nyeah this is a complicated question so\nmaybe we'll do I'll I'll think about\nthis and we'll talk a little bit about\ngut microbiome but it's complicated tldr\nbut there are studies for some of this\nstuff\num let's just do a quick here we\ngo\nlet's see let's let's learn together\nchat we're going to look at this thing\nand then we're going to call it\nokay because G is very common let's look\ntogether gastr sophal reflux disease and\nprobiotics a systematic review published\nabout four years ago so there should be\nsome more data on this let's take a\nquick look\num 13 prospective studies not\nbad okay so it looks like five high\nquality studies Six lowquality\nstudies um so 11 studies 79% reported\npositive effects of probiotics on\ngird\num so it looks like nausea\nwas\nimproved okay however proper Placebo\ncontrol controlled randomized and double\nblind trials with a sufficient number of\nparticipants are warranted to confirm\nthe efficacy of its symptoms so it seems\nlike if we look at a meta\nanalysis the takeaway is there are not\ngreat studies but that there seems to be\na very noticeable effect my take as a\nclinician is that the effect not all\nprobiotics are the\nsame and and\num yeah\nbut\noh please ask Alo to finish the trauma\nmodule map after with\nme okay so I have work to do it looks\nlike I have some stuff to do in for the\ntrauma module so I'm going to get to\nthat because our awesome person training\nin needs my help um yeah poor Mike I\nknow dude I don't know what the to do\nwe've had we've used two different\nmixers I've used three different\nmicrophones and for some reason or other\nthe the sound is always\nlow\num so thank you all very much for coming\ntoday and we hope to see y'all again\nsoon let me see what what's next for us\nin\nstreaming there's\ndyspepsia let's close\nthat let me see do we streaming on\nFriday okay oh so we have a members Q&A\ntomorrow\ngreat so we'll see you all tomorrow\nevery I mean if we have a members Q&A\ntomorrow but otherwise I think I I'm\nstreaming next week um you know as\nalways if you all want particular topics\nlike someone posted about Financial\nHealth um I recently met Caleb Hammer so\nwe may try to set up a collab with him\num but I think it's like tell us what\nyou guys want us to build and that's\nwhat we're here for we're here to build\nwhat you want okay and what's helpful to\nyou and then we'll do our best to keep\nyou all in the loop for why we're\nbuilding what we're building what we're\nworking on\nand you\nknow that's what we're here for so thank\nyou guys very much thank you all for\nbeing a part of this journey so far\nsupporting the work that we do we\nliterally could not be here without you\num because y'all feel the questions\ny'all contribute to the community yall\nshow up on Discord and then you'll also\ndo things like try our coaching program\nbuy the guides and by the way since so\nmany people bot guides that's why we we\ncould build more and more so we always\ntry to take the resources that y'all\ngive us and turn it into stuff more\nstuff for yall so thank you all very\nmuch and take care and we'll see yall\npotentially tomorrow uh"
