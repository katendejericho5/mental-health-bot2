    "transcript": "what a lot of people do in quiet\nquitting is they recognize that\nadditional effort is not rewarded so\nwhat used to happen is okay like there\nare four employees and if you work hard\nyou will get promoted and so then the\ndefault became everyone is working hard\nbut you still only get one person who's\npromoted and so over time what that sort\nof means is there's this interesting\npressure where it creates like almost\nlike a game theory kind of situation\nwhere I have to work harder than all of\nmy colleagues in order to get promoted\nbut the harder my colleagues work the\nharder I have to work work to outpace\nthem so this system was happening and\nthen employers realized everyone is\nworking way harder than they are paid\nfor then what started happening is I\nthink employees started taking this for\ngranted so now we started getting things\nlike unpaid internships are really\nlowball salaries and employers started\nto think like oh we can just lowball the\nout of people because this is now the\nstandard that happened so much that\nemployers started taking this for\ngranted it's not even going above is no\nlonger going above going above has\nbecome the norm"
