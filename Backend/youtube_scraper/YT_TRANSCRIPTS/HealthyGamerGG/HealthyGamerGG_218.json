    "transcript": "burnout is caused by one thing extreme\neffort with a lack of reward so I'll\nwork a 30-hour shift in a hospital and\nI'll be fine with it like that's like 30\nhours just think about that I'll go to a\nhospital on Friday at 6:00 p.m. and I\nleave like Sunday morning or something\nlike that and this is normal for us as\ndoctors and we don't burn out what burns\nme out when I have to talk to an\ninsurance company to try to get approval\nfor a medication for my patient a 30\nminute 45-minute call where I'm sitting\non hold with an insurance company\ncreates more burnout than 30 hours of\nwork and so if you look at the science\nof burnout what causes burnout is when\nsomeone tries something really hard is\ninvested in something and then they\ndon't get it so if you look at like\ncontent creators why are they so burnt\nout despite all the success that you\nhave youall know this that there's\nalways this voice in the back of your\nmind that you're never content"
