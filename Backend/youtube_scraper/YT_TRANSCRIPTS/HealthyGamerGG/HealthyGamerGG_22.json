    "transcript": "so if you're struggling with\nvisualization the first thing to\nunderstand is whatever is coming up\nthat's negative you hopefully in a\nhealthy way and hopefully you can handle\nit you have to let that come up before\nyou can visualize so what you should do\nis close your eyes don't even try to\nforce a visualization or push the\nnegativity away let the negativity come\nup and out if you have a history of a\nclinical problem doing this with a\ntherapist is very important but if\nyou're someone who's just an ordinary\nperson doesn't have any history of stuff\nby all means get evaluated but I think\nit's okay to do this process on your own\nassuming that it's manageable you just\nhave to be careful and so whatever\nnegativity comes up let it come up and\nthen let it out so you can write some\nkind of Journal if you want to you can\nspeak it out loud you can do art\nwhatever negativity in there has to come\nup you can't if the mind is full of\nnegativity you can't force positivity\ninto it it has to be empty first"
