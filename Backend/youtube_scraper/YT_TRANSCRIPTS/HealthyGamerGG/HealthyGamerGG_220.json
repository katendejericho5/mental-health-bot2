    "transcript": "so this is a huge problem right is that\nneurodiverse kids often times have\nneurodiverse parents and so the\nbeautiful thing is that once you figure\nout how to do this for yourself you will\nbe the best person on the planet to\nteach it to your child because you have\nthe experience of struggling\n[Music]\nyourself at my wits end with a\n99-year-old boy ignoring basic requests\nI'm working on getting an official\ndiagnosis for my son who's nine in the\nmeantime I'm trying to alter his\nenvironment to make his life easier\nhowever he fights me on every little\nthing he clearly needs structure but\nwhen I try to do that for him he fights\nit he's been arguing with me whenever I\nask him to do something simple today\nafter finishing his homework I told him\nhe needed to put his paper in his folder\nand put the folder in his book bag\nbecause he has a habit of shoving things\nin his book bag and then he can't find\nanything he proceeds to immediately\nstuff the paper into his book bag I\nasked him why he did that and he said I\nforgot but that makes no sense because I\ngave the command like 2 seconds before\nhe put the paper in his book bag I want\nto be forgiving for stuff like this\nbecause I'm also neurodiverse and tend\nto forget things but this doesn't seem\nlike forgetfulness it it just seems like\nblatantly ignoring me because he doesn't\ncare about what I say it's not just this\nbut other things too I'm not sure\nwhether to punish the back talk in\nignoring my demands but I also don't\nhave the patience to be understanding of\nhim in this area so this is a very\ncommon example so kid seems defiant kid\nignores what you say kid seems to forget\neven though you tell him 2 seconds right\nbefore you tell them give them can kid\ndoesn't like it so if yall want to\nbypass this and I have dealt with this\nmyself we have to start by understanding\nthe brain of someone with ADHD we have\nto start by understanding how their\nbrain shapes their experience because\nwhat you see as a parent is very\ndifferent from what your child\nexperiences and once we understand how\ntheir brain works we can craft a\nstrategy that fits the child and will\nwill result in the behavior that you\nwant okay I know it sounds unbelievable\nbut let's understand this so I've just\nfinished a 3our stream I'm exhausted and\nI am hungry and I am craving tasty fruit\nso today I'm going to go with roasted\ntomato feda Cavatelli recently I've been\nmeditating a lot more and as part of my\nspiritual practice I need to stay\nvegetarian and that's what I really love\nabout this is there are a ton of awesome\nvegetarian options so you can get\nanywhere from 6 to 18 meals a week which\nif you're like me and your work schedule\nactually changes a lot I'll travel on\nsome weeks I'll be streaming a lot on\nother weeks I can kind of adjust to what\nI want the other thing that I really\nlike about factor is they have a lot of\ndifferent options so it's not just meals\nit's also things like snacks and\nsmoothies things like wellness shots to\nkind of keep you going throughout the\nday without any mess okay it's a pity\nyou guys can't smell things over the\nInternet because this actually smells\nreally\ngood good head to factor 7 5.com or\nclick the link below and use the code\nhealthy gamer 50 to get 50% off your\nfirst Factor box and two free wellness\nshots from three available flavors for\nevery order while you're an active\nsubscriber so let's start by\nunderstanding the kid this is the kid's\nexperience so the kid does homework and\nat the very end of homework parent says\nput this in your bag put this in folder\nand then folder in back this seems very\nsimple you're just a parent you're just\ntelling him hey like just do this thing\nBR it's easy I just told you to do it\njust do it but the kid seems like super\nlike the kid is defant so let's\nunderstand literally what's going on in\nthe kid's brain so the first is when a\nchild with the child with ADHD is doing\nhomework what this means is that after\nthe homework the child is exhausted they\nare cognitively exhausted so let's\nunderstand this so the child has frontal\nloes frontal loes allow them to restrain\nimpulses pay attention focus okay this\nis what the frontal loes do so normally\nif a if you're a neurotypical person and\nyou finish your homework you have enough\nfrontal lobe gas in the tank that you\ncan put things away properly because at\nthe very end we'll get to this in a\nsecond but with kids with ADHD you don't\nhave any gas in the tank which means\nthat they are exhausted which means that\nthey can't pay attention it's very\ndifficult for them to restrain their\nimpulses and do what you ask they can't\nfocus they're already empty empty\nfrontal loes at the end of homework okay\nthis is the pro first problem second\nproblem is I want yall to think about\nthe emotional experience of a child who\nis struggling to do homework so this is\na kid that has been doing homework okay\nI have to do homework I have to force my\nmind to pay attention I'm paying\nattention I'm paying attention I'm\npaying attention I'm finally done holy\n this is so hard but I'm finished\nnow I'm free I did it this is so hard\nfor me but I did a good job I did what\nmommy and daddy told me to do I have my\nhomework finished I worked really hard I\nsucceeded I'm done this is a win I'm\nfree now in comes parent and says no no\nyou're not free you have to do more you\nhave to do something else you have to do\none more thing and one more thing and\none more thing so think about the\nemotional experience when you're done\nfor the week and you've worked really\nhard you've worked really hard for the\nwhole week and it's Friday at 6 p.m. and\nyou're like I'm done for the day I'm\ndone I'm going to head home and your\nboss walks in and says oh by the way can\nyou do one more thing it'll just take a\nminute think about your emotional\nexperience in that moment and you are a\nfull grown adult this is what the child\nwith ADHD experiences the other thing to\nkeep in mind is that the child with ADHD\nhas a disregulated lyic system so\nremember that ADHD doesn't just AFF\naffect the frontal loes it also affects\nour emotional circuitry which means that\nthe child with ADHD when when we can\nhandle something a kid with ADHD won't\nbe able to handle it emotionally so they\nexperience more intense emotion it is\nmore difficult to control their emotion\nso for you it's just putting one piece\nof paper in the folder and putting the\nthe folder in the book bag when you're\ncognitively exhausted but for them it's\nlike okay now take these hundred papers\nand put them into a 100 different\nfolders and organize them and then put\nthem all in your book bag bag in order\nso the emotional experience is literally\nmore intense we have fmri studies that\nshow that kids with ADHD suffer from\nemotional disregulation because the\nliteral signal in their brain is more\nintense than the signal that we\nexperience furthermore since their\nfrontal loes are empty their ability to\ncontrol this emotional Outburst or this\nemotional response is weakened so let's\nlook at this case again trying to alter\nhis environment he fights me on every\nlittle thing okay he's been arguing\nwhenever I ask him to do something\nsimple so when the homework is done the\nkid is already exhausted and then the\nparent says oh and there's one more\nthing to do I asked him why he did that\nand he said I forgot but that makes no\nsense because I gave the command like 2\nseconds before he put it in his book bag\nnow hold on a second so this is really\nimportant when your child with ADHD\ngives you a answer that makes no sense\ndon't just assume that they are wrong\nyou don't don't do that if it doesn't\nmake sense to you you all need to come\nto an accord because there is something\nthat you may not understand and this is\nwhat really frustrates parents because\nparents will say I just told them two\nseconds ago but they forget how can they\nforget so let's understand a third\nneuroscientific mechanism attentional\nproblems so remember that in ADHD people\ndon't forget this very common\nmisconception people assume so\nforgetfulness in ADHD is not a memory\ndeficit so we see memory deficits in\nthings like Dementia or delirium these\nare actually dementia is like a memory\ndeficit this is not people with ADHD\nhave have memories that are totally fine\nthey can remember stuff fine the problem\nwith ADHD is that stuff does not sink in\nthis is the problem they are not paying\nattention when you are speaking so they\nnever hear you in the first place so the\nmore cognitively exhausted you are at\nthe end of your homework the harder it\nis to pay attention to one more thing\nright so I want yall to imagine this\nimagine that you're at the end of a\ninternational flight and you've been on\nthe plane for 24 hours and then some\ndude in the airport gives you a list of\nlike 16 things to do and you just can't\npay attention you can listen to the\nfirst like two or minutes but at the end\nof it you just can't pay attention to\nthe rest of it it's not sinking in it's\nnot that they don't forget they don't\nforget it never goes in in the first\nplace so if your child says I forgot and\nyou're like that makes no sense it's an\nattentional problem okay so now these\nare the three problems that we have we\nhave frontal loes that are exhausted we\nhave a lyic system that is hyperactive I\nwas free but now you're taking that away\nthere's one more thing oh my God one\nmore thing that's harder to regulate and\nsince their frontal loes are exhausted\nthey have have difficulty listening to\nwhat you're saying now the good news is\nthat we can fix all of them once we\nunderstand how their brain works we can\nInstitute systems to actually correct\nall of these okay so this is where there\nis one big mistake that parents make\nwhich is to think about when is the\ntiming of the request so remember that\nlet's say here's your frontal Loba\nenergy so this is your child's ability\nto pay attention follow through even\nregulate emotions now here's homework\nover time so as your child with ADHD\ndoes their homework this is this is what\nhappens to their attentional energy and\nthen you tell them down here one more so\nhere's the key thing this is what you\nthis is when you need to tell them if\nyou're trying to create structure in\nyour child's life you cannot create\nstructure and Implement structure at the\nsame time you need to plan the structure\nthat's the whole point of structure\nright it's built ahead of time so if we\nthink about like you know structure in\nin something like a house\nwe don't build the roof when it starts\nraining right that's absurd you build\nthe roof way ahead of time and then when\nit when it rains the roof is already\nready it's ready it's there everything\nis set up this is not what kids with ad\nuh parents with ADHD do with their kids\nthey create the structure when things\nare burning down or when things are\ngoing wrong does that make sense oh the\nkid did not put their thing in the\nproper folder therefore let me teach the\nkid where to put it no no no that's not\ncreating structure that is dealing with\nwith a fire that has already gotten out\nof hand structure is created ahead of\ntime preemptively not at the moment when\nyou need it so here is what I would\nrecommend that we do and there are a\ncouple of other uh techniques that we\ncan use here okay what I would do is\nliterally practice and explain\norganization so what we're going to do\nbefore we even start the homework is we\nare going to take the kid and we're\ngoing to say hey so let's talk a little\nbit about where our homework goes before\nwe do our homework where does homework\ngo and this is there's a huge thing that\nparents miss out on is that they try to\nexplain things to their kid but if\nyou've got a kid with ADHD you need to\nleverage their understanding ask\nquestions so what we want to do is ask\nquestions you can ask them okay where\nshould we put our homework when it's\ndone why do we put it in there can we\nleave it out on the table and then put\nit in later what happens if you leave it\nsomewhere and then you're going to\norganize it later what do you think will\nhappen and the kid is smart the kid\nknows oh maybe I'll forget where it is\nokay so then what should you do about\nthat leverage their understanding and\nthis is a big thing that a lot of\nneurotypical parents don't understand is\nyou can't take for granted the stuff\nthat is easy for you to learn see\nneurotypical people will connect the\ndots and the the whole challenge with\nraising a neurodiverse kid is that they\ndon't connect the dots the same way that\nyou do so you have to spend time\nexplaining things that otherwise don't\nneed to be explained and if you take\nthat step all of the effort of the mess\nthat you deal with down the road like\nthis this all gets fixed you just have\nto do it upfront and in the right way so\nwhat I would recommend is that you first\nhave a conversation with your child\nright so you have to like show up\nTuesday at 5:00 p.m. when nothing else\nis going on there's no homework being\ndone they have a full frontal lobe\nthey've just gotten back from their\nsoccer class we're going to sit down\nyou've had a good day let's explain\nlet's talk about homework and then what\nwe're going to do so we're going to\nstart with questions right go with\nunderstanding questions okay and then\nwe're going to explain organization so I\nmaybe I should do these in the opposite\norder okay so first thing you're going\nto do number one is ask questions and\nshoot for understanding what does your\nchild understand okay second thing that\nwe're going to do is explain if you need\nto because sometimes you'll need to\nexplain they won't understand like so\nyou'll say okay like this is why we do\nthings so that we we can find them do\nyou sometimes forget your homework do\nyou have difficulty misplacing your\nhomework okay so here's the reason that\nwe put it in the folder and then all you\nhave to remember is to check your folder\nyou don't have to remember where the\nhomework is what's easier checking your\nfolder or trying to remember where your\nhomework is okay good and this is the\nthird step that a lot of parents Miss\n95% of parents miss practice rce you\nhave to literally practice this skill so\nwhat I would say is that okay now what\nwe're going to do is I've got three\ndifferent pieces of paper that are in\nthree different places in the house what\nI want you to do is go get each of those\nthree pieces of paper and then put them\nin your folder and put your folder in\nyour backpack now this is really\nimportant so you don't just do this once\nyou do this every day for 1 to two weeks\nthis is our task that we are going to\nlearn three pieces of paper in three\nfolders it takes less than 60 seconds\nonce they get good at and here's the\nbeautiful thing in the ADHD brain we\nknow that these parts of the brain right\nour emotional system our frontal loes we\nhave attentional problems but there is\none circuit of the brain not one there\nare many circuits of the brain that are\ncompletely intact that function totally\nfine for kids with ADHD and as we use\nthe intact circuits of the brain their\nlife will become extraordinarily easy so\nthe first circuit that we're going to\ntalk about or the main one is the Habit\ncircuitry this is completely fine so the\nhabit circuitry is the endoc canabo\nsystem so this system is not altered in\nADHD the problem with kids with ADHD is\nif you are constantly nagging them and\nthey they don't have if there's no\nconsistency their habits can never form\nthis is the real tragedy of being a\nhuman being with ADHD is that the very\ncircuit that can fix all of your\nproblems which is the Habit formation\ncircuitry never gets enough consistency\nto form a habit in the first place\nthere's one thing that can save you and\nis very hard to activate that thing so\nas a parent what we need to do is build\nthese habits so for two weeks all we're\ngoing to do is practice putting our\nthing away putting our paper away when\nwe're done with our homework and now\nwhat happens is if you Institute this\nproperly what you'll find is that for\ntwo weeks you're focusing on this and\nthen after that the kid will know how to\ndo it and once they know how to do it\nyou will not have to nag them you will\nnot have to remind them it'll become\nhabit even if they're not paying\nattention this is the key thing right so\nif we look at this remember that the\nwhole point is you're asking the kid to\npay attention restrain their impulses\nand do this extra step if the child\ndoesn't pay attention they will end up\nhabitually doing it anyway because it's\na different part of their brain so even\nif they're emotionally exhausted if\ntheir frontal lobes are exhausted the\nhabits kick in that's exactly what we\nwant when the child stops paying\nattention they'll behave in the right\nway it's beautiful so that someone's\nsaying like what do your kids understand\nexactly so the problem is also that see\nwhen we often times if you're\nneurotypical you can connect the dots so\nit's obvious to you that if you put the\nhomework in the folder then you won't\nlose the homework but sometimes if your\nkid has ADHD you have to connect those\ndots for them when you're looking for\nyour homework where should it be in the\nfolder and even if they can come up with\nthe right answer it's not that they\nwon't be able to come up with the right\nanswer you have to ask them the set of\nquestions and then those connections\nwill form in their brain they can come\nup with the right answer but you have to\nask them the question and then once they\ncome up with the right answer that's\ngreat they may answer right away but\nyou're still like connecting those dots\nfor them what if the parent is ADHD and\ncan build any habit very good question\nso this is a huge problem right is that\nneurodiverse kids often times have\nneurodiverse parents and so the\nbeautiful thing is that once you figure\nout how to do this for yourself you will\nbe the best person on the planet to\nteach it to your child because you have\nthe experience of struggling yourself so\nif we look at our basic principles\nremember that a habit formation is\ndifficult at the end of the day so what\nwe need to do if you're a parent who has\ndifficulty with structures first you\nhave to implement the structure yourself\nand second is you should practice too\nright so practice putting your keys in\nthe right place your wallet in the right\nplace literally what we'll do is like I\nI'll with my kid I will practice this\nthree times in a row go put your\nbackpack here go put your water bottle\nin the sink go put your snack in the the\nsnack container in the sink and now\nwe're going to pull them out of the sink\nyou're going to pack your bag again\nwe're going to walk out the door and\nwe're going to come in and we're going\nto do it two more times we will practice\nthis and once they do it three times a\nday every day for one week then they\nknow how to do it I never have to tell\nthem again so you should do the same\nthing as an adult Implement that\nstructure early on in the day when your\nfrontal lobes still have some energy and\nliterally go through the\n[Music]\nmotions"
