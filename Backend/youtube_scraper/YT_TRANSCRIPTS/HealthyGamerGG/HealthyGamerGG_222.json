righty\nchat let's get started\nso my hair is a little bit messed up\ntoday welcome to another healthy gamer G\nstream my name is all kosia just a\nreminder uhoh do we have lag okay we're\nwe'll deal with it just a reminder that\nalthough I'm a psychiatrist nothing we\ndiscuss on stream today is intended to\nbe taken as medical advice everything is\nfor educational and entertainment\npurposes only if yall have a medical\nconcern or question please go see a\nlicensed\nprofessional that's very true especially\nabout what we're going to talk about\ntoday because we are going to talk about\nsuicide and specifically in men and I'm\ngoing to try to clarify a couple of\nthings that I said\num I wish I could say they were taken\nout of context but honestly I think\nthere was some amount of fair context\nthere and then we're also going to do\nsomething so so we're and and then we're\ngoing to talk about that because I did\nthis thing where I showed up on the\ninternet and I was recently on a podcast\ncalled Diary of a\nCEO this\npodcast has gotten a lot of views people\nstarted posting clips about it and then\nmy favorite thing my favorite thing\nhappened on the internet people people\nstarted reacting to\nit and so I'm new to this kind of thing\num but now what I'm going to do because\nI understand this is how things happen\nis I'm going to react to some of the\nreactions and what I'd love to do is\nclarify a little bit about what I was\nsaying um but then also continue to talk\nabout this because I think this is like\nreally important to understand and I\nthink some people on the internet\nlike seem to I I don't I don't want to\nsay that they misinterpreted what I I\nwas going to say because I think\ntechnically that's not what happened I\nthink they made some assumptions about\nthings that I was saying which I don't\nthink are correct and so I'd like to\ntalk a little bit about that and then\nthen what I'd really like to do is I'm\ngoing to show youall like a bucket of\nresearch about why I believe what I\nbelieve what this means for you and then\nhopefully at the end I will share with\ny'all what I think we should do in some\nway about male suicide I haven't really\nfleshed that part out yet but I think I\nfeel like ranting a little bit so we'll\nsee where it goes okay\nso a couple of other things just to keep\nin mind so sometimes when I talk about\nthings so today I'm going to be talking\na little bit about some of my clinical\nexperiences um a couple of other things\nto keep in mind sometimes when I talk\nabout clinical experiences they will\ninclude things that are\nclinically relevant which is is kind of\nlike my way of saying I guess this is\nlike a trigger warning because I'm going\nto be like sharing some of my clinical\nexperiences working with people who are\nsuicidal working with people who have\nbeen traumatized or abused things like\nthat as always and if you guys don't\nknow this whenever I talk about these\nthings everything that I talk about is\nchimerical which means that like if I\nsay like I saw a patient who was XYZ\nlike I change all that stuff out to\nprotect privacy but the essence of the\nstory is true and it's usually like\nmultiple people that this applies this\nto okay so there's a couple of quick\ndisclaimers so um a couple of other\nsimple things so one is that if you are\nsomeone who's struggling with suicide\nside I strongly strongly strongly urge\nyou to seek mental health help from a\nprofessional um in the you know if if\nyou're actually in danger today please\ngo seek Emergency Services call 911 in\nthe United States depending on what\ncountry you're in it's like 112 or all\nkinds of other things um I and hopefully\nif you don't feel like doing that quite\nyet uh I will make an argument by the\nend of wherever we end up today as to\nwhy that is a good idea and the right\nmove okay so let's\nstart with the\nreactions okay so Dr K did something\nsilly okay I did something silly and\nthat silly thing was I opened my\nmouth and then the rest of the general\ninternet was paying attention for once\nand let's see what\nhappened\noh okay looks like you guys do not have\nhave a audio input here let me see if I\ncan add one real quick can Dr K add a\ntech support\ncheck um audio output\ncapture uh desktop\naudio let's call it\nthis and then default\ndevice okay can y'all let's see if this\nworks suicide okay there we go all right\nso for this some reason this video seems\npretty quiet to me um so y'all may have\nto turn up the volume a little bit it's\njacked up all the all the way over here\nokay but let's just listen to it all\nright so the number one thing that\ncorrelates with male suicide is not\ndepression this is super scary there's\none study I saw recently that suggests\nthat 50% of men who kill themselves have\nno history or evidence of mental illness\nand this I I believe the statistic in in\nmy clinical practice because I know what\ndepression looks like I know what\nbipolar disorder looks like and how half\nthe men that I've worked with at least\nare not actually mentally ill see mental\nillness means a pathology of the mind\nwhich means that the mind is\nmalfunctioning most of the suicidal men\nthat I work with they're not ma their\nmind isn't malfunctioning they genuinely\nhave a life that is no longer worth\nliving they're looking at things and\nobjectively realizing that there's no\nway out of the situation so they turn to\nSuicide so I know it's kind of like a\nvery controversial statement but I think\nthat's what my clinical practice has\nshown and there's some research to even\nback that up okay\nso I I think there's there's a lot of\nthings here okay so this is what I said\num we'll show you the papers in a little\nbit um and and I think some people are\ngetting caught up in this word objective\nwhich so just a quick kind of disclaimer\nso like you know so this is challenging\nwhen you're speaking about stuff on the\ninternet is that like everything so if\nI'm giving a talk about male suicide\nthere's enough space in the talk to add\nthe new\nadd the complexity add the disclaimers\nand then sometimes when you do something\nlike go on a podcast You Are by\nnecessity forced to simplify things\nbecause like you're making another Point\nlike so in this video I'm not talking\nabout male suicide is the primary point\nI'm using it as a statistic to talk\nabout in context with a larger\nconversation so just to give youall like\na a quick heads up like the whole\ninterview was like 2 and 1/2 hours I\nthink it got edited down to like 1 hour\nand 8 minutes and I'm not saying that\nthey did a bad job or anything like that\nthat's just how things go right like I\nmay have scratched my balls somewhere in\nthe middle of the interview and they\nchose to edit that out thank you all\nvery much from Diary of a CEO I think\nthey did a great job with editing I'm\nnot saying that I got taken out of\ncontext or anything like that but now\nlet's look at some some of the reactions\nright so why live if your life is stupid\nwell why not take a huge risk what do\nyou have to lose that's how you should\nteach depressed men to think it bro\ngo all in you're already dead it's all\nupside from here so I think that this is\nlike one example of one of the the\nresponses right is like if someone's\nlife sucks why do you have to lose why\ndo you not take a huge risk I don't know\nwhy this person put depressed in quotes\nI I'm not I'm confused about what that\nmeans but I think it's like some people\nkind of feel this way right so this is\nlike kind of good it's like kind of\npositive right\nlike like you know I guess I'm not sure\num and and and then hold on let me see\nif I can God I can't stand myself talk\nI've had three friends who committed\nside all of the men two were married one\nhad a four-year-old daughter all of them\nhad lots of close friends one was highly\npaid Serv lives worth living is\nintended to Pander to a social media\naudience so when when I when I first saw\nthis tweet you know I got a little bit\nupset and I was like oh my God right\nthis person doesn't understand what I'm\nsaying I I think that you know like but\nlet's remember like this is X or Twitter\nright and this is the internet and what\nhappens like you know this was I wasn't\ntrying to Pander to a social media\naudience I I I thought the way that I\nwhat was in my head is I'm trying to\nraise awareness about a mental health\nissue that I think is troubling like I I\nmean if I was pandering to a social\nmedia audience I think I would have said\nit in an accent you know and and so my\nfirst reaction was that like okay this\nperson is like you know but I mean I\nthink the person probably comes from a\ngood place and let's remember like why\nwould this person interpret what I'm\ndoing is pandering to social media\naudience I don't know maybe because they\nspend some time on this place called the\ninternet where a lot of content creators\nlike this is what we do right so I think\nthat this is like a a helpful comment if\nMis a little bit misdirected which even\nthen I can't really blame them for right\nbecause what are they reacting to\nthey're reacting to a 50-second clip of\na 1 hour and 8 minute video that was\nedited from a 2H hour and 30-minute\ninterview so this is what we have to\nremember about the internet and Twitter\nand x and all of these platforms these\nare not places for nuance discussion\nthese are places for reactionary\ncontent okay so in regards to male\nsuicidal patients a therapist who\nbelieves their minds are not\nmalfunctioning and their lives are not\nworth living would not be beneficial as\na therapist does not attempt to correct\nor improve their situation now this is\nwhere I say this person I disagree\n100% so there are a couple of very very\nvery important things to consider\nhere so let's start with this okay I\nwant yall to really think about or\nactually we'll get to this in a second\nso then asmin gold decided to react to\nthis back that up so the number one\nthing so people are mad about this\npeople are pissed off and it's like\nobviously he's not saying that they\nshould kill themselves he's talking\nabout it from their perspective right\nit's like I haven't seen the context but\nlike tell me am I wrong that's clearly\nwhy it's like from their perspective\nthey think that their life isn't going\nto get any better so so like they\nlogically come to this conclusion rather\nthan come to this conclusion through a\nmanifestation of some sort of actual\npathology of the mind like he says but\npeople don't understand that and they're\ngetting pissed off at him right this is\ncrazy why live your life is stupid well\nwhy not take a huge risk what do you\nhave to lose well that's that's again\nwhat you have to teach people right and\nthat's clearly what the point is life's\nnot worth living is intended to\nPander to social media audience no like\nbro I feel like that sometimes right\nlike I remember so I'm going to pause\nhere for a second so I I I want to just\nso if we look at something like this and\ntheir lives are not worth living would\nnot be beneficial okay so the first\nproblem that I have with this\nis just because someone's doesn't have a\nmalfunction of the mind doesn't mean\nthat we don't try to help them right so\nlike I don't know how you say like just\nbecause someone accurately assesses\ntheir life is not having a whole lot of\nvalue why do you assume that that means\nwe don't try to help or correct or\nimprove their situation that's\nabsolutely what we do and this is where\nI I I I want youall to really understand\nthis this is what I think is so\nimportant to understand so here is a\nperson okay now let's look at their life\nthey have a there are some subjective\naspects to\nlife and this is like this is rif with\nall kinds of problems subjective\nobjective and let's say that there are\nobjective problems with their life\nso actually forget about subjective\nproblems I'm going to change this a\nlittle bit so let's say they have a\nmalfunctioning mind so if someone is is\nsuffering and says my life\nsucks\nokay and you have a malfunction of the\nmind so in the case of clinical\ndepression one of the key things about\nmood disorders like a depressive episode\nis that while often times depressive\nepisodes are triggered by negative\ncircum ances the whole point of the\npathology is that this person\nobjectively has lots to live for so I'm\nthinking about so I worked on a\nparticular psychiatric unit called Blake\n11 at Massachusetts General Hospital I\nwas an intern there and I would have\npatients who came in and they were\nmarried they had\nkids who loved\nthem they had careers they would go\nskiing in the wintertime they even had\ndogs\nso someone comes in and says I'm\nsuicidal my family would be better off\nwithout me my kids like I know they say\nthey love me but like they don't realize\nhow of a dad they've got this is\nwhat I would call a malfunction of the\nmind so this is a situation where you\nlook at it objectively and you say like\nand even then like you could say argue\nwhat is objective what is subjective and\nthis is where when I say objective like\nbasically what I'm referring to is we\ncan look at research on quality of life\nand we can take like a thousand human\nbeings and we can say say okay what is\nthe quality of life of these people and\nthen like we can say these people have a\ngood quality of life these people have a\nbad quality we have like research on\nquality of life okay we can say this\nperson has a malfunctioning mind now\nlet's take the case of someone else\nlet's say that I am 36 years old I am a\nvirgin I have no job I live at\nhome I've never had a romantic\nrelationship\nI have nothing to look forward to in the\nsense of like I'm not going on vacation\nI'm not striving from\npromotion so when I say like no future I\ndon't mean like in an abstract\nphilosophical sense I mean like\nliterally if you sit down and you talk\nto this person you ask them what are you\nlooking forward to over the next year\nand they have nothing they can't think\nof a single thing that they're looking\nforward to okay now we have to be super\ncareful\nhere because if we say the reason that\nthis person is\nsuicidal is because of these things\nwhich are I would call them objective\naspects of their life will'll get a\nlittle bit into the Nuance versus the\nobjective aspects of this this person's\nlife are okay this person's life\nsuck where is the root of the problem\nhere now this gets complicated and like\nI said we'll get into this because this\nleads to cognitive biases and emotional\nchanges and all that kind of\nstuff\nwe have to be super careful because if\nwe assume that this person's problem is\nall in their head and they have a\nmalfunction of their mind and actually\nthey're\nwrong we know your life better than you\ndo you have a lot to live for you're\njust too stupid to understand it\nyou just need to dig deeper and try\nharder these people try way harder than\nmost of us will ever try honestly this\nis my experience and my understanding of\nit to be 36 years old and wake\nup one day and like pull yourself out of\nbed because I'm happily married\nand like I've got a 2-year-old I'm tired\nbut my life is good I have a reason to\nget out of bed what is way harder is to\nget out of bed when you have no reason\nto get out of\nbed so this is where like you\nknow and we'll get some of this like why\nnot take a Hu what do you have to lose\nwhat you have to lose is\neffort so if you're 36 years old and you\nhaven't done anything with your life\nwhat do you have to lose you have more\neffort with no gain to lose that is a\nhuge cost you have futility in your life\nthis is what the experiences of these\npeople\nare right so this is where I don't say\nlike oh hey you're mentally ill you just\nyour brain brain brain\nyou don't realize that there's so much\nto live for when I say like I look at\nthese people's lives and I think they\nobjectively look and this is what I mean\nby objective so you call this objective\nor subjective I'll give you all a simple\nexample right so this person walks into\nmy office it's 36 years\nold and they have had nothing of\nconsequence in their life that they can\nremember maybe they did somewhere but\ngenerally speaking they kind of dropped\nout of college they just started playing\na bunch of video games watching\npornography you know like getting\ndeveloping social relationships with\nvtubers and like this is what their life\nis now if you ask this person like what\ndo you have to look forward to what has\nyour experience of life been like just\nthink about this if you've lived the\nmajority of your 20s and half of your\n30s and you have had nothing to look\nforward to why would you logically\nassume if you've been trying this\nfor like 36 years why would you\nlogically assume that things are going\nto get magically better in 2 years or 3\nyears or four years or 5\nyears why would you logically assume\nthat right so human beings are really\ngood at pattern recognition I'm not\nsaying that their lives are not worth\nfighting for and I'm not saying and\nwe'll get to that because I'm against\nsuicide but what I'm saying is like when\nI say that their lives are objectively\n like this is you know they say that\nand this by the way was something that\nwas taught to me which is like I'll just\nshare this example with y'all so I I was\nworking at Massachusetts General\nHospital and I was working in the\nemergency room there's a brilliant nurse\npractitioner there and then she would\nlike see patients and she would come to\nme and then you know we'd like talk\nabout it I'd say like okay what's going\non with this\nperson and then she'd say like there's\nsix diagnoses in the chart conduct\ndisorder polysubstance use and if you\nguys know mental health and you're a\nmental health professional you know\nexactly what I'm talking about poly\nsubstance use\ndisorder um conduct disorder PTSD\nbipolar\ndisorder maybe major depressive disorder\nforget the fact that those are mutually\nexclusive in ADHD those are the six\ndiagnoses but she says I ask her what's\nthe problem with this kid she says he\nhas\nSLS what is SLS life syndrome this\nis a kid that grew up in a traumatic\nhousehold was through like the group\nhome and orphanage system abuse\nsubstance use no good Role Models no\nprospects got into trouble at school got\nput into this IEP these kids just they\njust never had a chance in life you can\nslap as many diagnoses as you want on\ntop of them which is usually what ends\nup happening and then they get medicated\nto all hell but the problem is that\nthey've just never like you know there's\nso many Community social lack of Role\nModels lack of Love lack of support lack\nof modeling lack of emotional mirroring\nall this kind of\nstuff so first thing we have to be super\ncareful because if we assume that this\nis a malfunction of the mind then what\nwe try to do is fix the malfunction of\nthe mind and we ignore all of this stuff\nthis I think is potentially one of the\nbiggest mistakes that we're making okay\nso let's take a look at a couple other\ncomments okay Every Man Has a life worth\nliving Doom porn deserves scorn and\nrebuke so this I think is also where we\nhave to like take a step back and we\nhave to decide a couple of\nthings\nokay so someone says Every Man Has a\nlife worth\nliving now\nso one of the things that we try very\nhard as therapists is to do something\ncalled\nempathize what does that mean that means\nthat when someone walks into your office\nand they say this is my life we do our\nbest to meet them where they're at we do\nour best to understand as therapists and\nmaybe this is wrong but this is I think\nis\nfair that this person has lived their\nlife every single day and I have not\nlived their life every single day and\nthat the experiences of my life don't\nnecessarily translate over to them so if\nsomeone says every person's life has\nvalue I\nagree but the reason that I agree is\nbecause of my life because I see that my\nlife has value every day I've lived with\nsome value I've thought that I didn't\nhave value and now I believe that it has\nvalue I agree that all lives have value\nbut my point is that when someone walks\ninto your office and they say this is my\nexperience of the world I think it is\nthe height of arrogance to say you are\nwrong and I am right because I haven't\nactually lived a day in the their shoes\nand I'll tell you we did this for\ndecades to women because women showed up\nand said hey I'm getting sexually\nassaulted and we said hahaa no you're\nnot that is possible if you got sexually\nassaulted you are asking for it this is\nliterally the kinds of responses we had\nso what was this 2017 me too movement\nabout it was about believe women hey I\nhave a crazy idea when someone says\nsomething about their life how about we\nmeet them where they're at we're not\nsaying they're 100% right and there may\nbe cases I'm not going to get into the\nMEO movement in sexual assault and all\nthat kind of stuff they're they're\nabsolutely like at least in depression\nand suicidality there are cognitive\ndistortions and stuff like that but a\ngood starting point which I think is\nlike basics of medicine is like listen\nto your\npatients hear what they have to say try\nto understand them this is the\nfoundation of therapy is the better that\nI understand someone else's experience\nthe more that I will be able to help\nthem and the whole problem I've heard so\nmany horror stories of people going in\nand telling their therapist like hey my\nlife sucks and the therapist is like no\nit doesn't you just need to see things\nthis way you just need to do things this\nway and that can actually be helpful for\nsome people okay there's variability\nthere there's Nuance there but this is\nlike exactly in a sense what I think the\nproblem\nis so here's my take okay so first of\nall let's take a look at a couple of\nthese\num I think he they're subjectively\ndetermining their life isn't worth\nliving and there are only a few\ndecisions uh away from feeling otherwise\nthis person is kind of saying okay like\nwhat do you mean by objectively\nrealizing what do you mean these are\ngreat I would love to know more about\nwhat qualifies as not worth\nliving I'm not sure I get enforcing your\nclient Suicidal Tendencies is best\nmedical or ethical practice I agree\nwhich is why I don't do it right so I\nlet me be very clear I am 100% against\nsuicide and people may even say like\nokay but what about the situations where\nsomeone has a like debilitating medical\ndegenerative illness like\nALS and like even in those cases at best\nI'm a question mark So if I had a a\npatient who walked into my office\ntomorrow and said hey I have ALS I want\nto kill myself I would be like yeah I\ncan't help you do that so I've had those\nkinds of requests by the way so I've had\npatients like the weirdest referral I've\never gotten is someone was like hey I\nneed a psychiatrist to sign off so that\nI can go commit medical suicide in\nEurope and I was like I'm not willing to\ndo that so I'm 100% against suicide okay\nI've even had people who will be like\nlike but hey Dr K you believe in in\nreincarnation right so doesn't it make\nit okay cuz I just I just get a redo and\nI'm like no bro I'm still against\nsuicide sorry\nbro but here's how I approach those\nsituations so I think somewhere along\nthe way and this is like it's Twitter X\nor whatever right so acknowledging that\nsomeone objectively has a shitty life\nand this I'll tell you like literally\nwhat I say and here's the way I think I\nchoose to approach it so far my patients\nseem to be pretty happy with it\nas far as I know right and that is like\nokay so if your life is objective\nand you have no hope this is what I say\nI say I can explain to me why first of\nall help me understand how your life is\nmeaningless and is complete crap like I\nwould love to hear what you're actually\ntalking about and that's when they say\nthese kinds of things and this is when I\nsay I hear you I still don't think\nsuicide is the right answer if you're\nfeeling dangerous and you're going to\nhurt yourself please let me know I'm\ngoing to do everything I can in my power\nto stop that and here is why because at\nthis point hundreds of people I have\nworked with who have been suicidal\nhundred people have walked through the\ndoor just like you have and 97 out of\n100 over time have been arguably as\nhopeless as you have and their lives\nhave been better have gotten better I\nhear you that your life is objective\n let me help you build a life that\nis worth\nliving now this is very important to\nunderstand this is not me saying hey\nyour brain is malfunctioning you just\ndon't realize that your life is worth\nliving this is me saying hey I'm going\nto meet you where you're at if you think\nyour life sucks let's do something about\nit right and this is where like I don't\nI mean in a sense I can't blame these\npeople right because there wasn't\ncontext to this clip this 50-second clip\nright so I absolutely try to correct or\nimprove their situation but this also\nhas um you know like I I don't enforce\nquite the opposite the other thing that\nI'll kind of say to them is hey like\nlook I understand that you have no hope\nright now what I would love to do is\ncarry the hope for both of us I have\nhope for you you you're telling me that\nyour life is absolute crap right now I\nhear that not just right now you told me\nthat it's been absolute crap for the\nlast 10 years I think it's completely\nreasonable for you to be\nhopeless I can't imagine living 10 years\nof your life and waking up and finding\nhope I can't imagine how logically I\nwould be able to do that I totally get\nwhere you're coming from\nbut I have hope for you and if you're\nokay with it I will carry the hope for\nyou and me for three months you don't\nhave to all I want you to do is show up\ntry and get some help like I know you've\ntried a ton I know you've worked really\nreally hard I can see that you've tried\nso many different things I don't think\nyou're at fault but what I would like to\ndo is help you because I think the\nbiggest problem in your life is that you\nhaven't received the help that you\nneeded it's not your fault you've tried\nyou've given it a shot so let me help\nand the reason that I choose to Hope is\nbecause 977 out of 100 people who walk\ninto my office get better right so\nhere's where I'm coming from and I'm not\nwilling to give up on you yet and then\nsome of them will say but what about the\nthree you said 97 what if I'm in one of\nthe three and this is where we get to\nthe cognitive bias oh that's so\ninteresting why would you assume that\nyou would fall into the three instead of\nthe\n97 huh how did your mind jump there\nthat's so interesting I wonder if there\nare other situations in your life where\nyou assume that your things are not\ngoing to work out for you where did you\nlearn learn that how did you discover\nthat if you know it's I don't even\nknow what the right analogy is it's\nlike you know if everyone is mining up\ngold you dig in the earth and you're the\none guy who finds that's an\ninteresting like that's an interesting\nperspective help me understand that and\nthen we'll eventually get to the\nquestion of if you believe that you are\nin the 3% who you who will fail what do\nyou think that does for your prospects\nof success there's this thing called the\nno sibo effect where if you believe\nyou're going to screw up if you go into\na job interview and you think you're\ngoing to screw it up the belief that you\nare going to screw it up increases your\nchances of screwing it up and then we\nget to self-perpetuating cycles and we\ncan open the door and that's when the\ntherapy happens why do you immediately\njump to the three and even then when\nthey say the three and this is where I\nsay yeah like it's not that those people\nare uncurable let's understand this\nright let's be nuan let's be\nspecific it doesn't mean that they can't\nbe helped it just means that my dumbass\nwas not sufficient to help\nthem because shockingly I'm just a\nregular\npsychiatrist right I'm no Miracle Worker\nI am flawed I can't help all of my\npatients because as a psychiatrist we\ndon't have all this figured out and\non some days I don't get 8 hours of\nsleep and maybe my neurons are not\nwiring that doesn't mean that they are\nhopeless why do you assume that that\nmeans they are hopeless instead of I am\nflawed\nso even for those three\npatients who I care about deeply I just\nrecognize I was not the person to help\nthem so 100% against suicide\nabsolutely and we have to be super\ncareful because if we assume that the\nreason that people are suicidal is\nbecause they are mentally ill as opposed\nto they are not mentally ill and there\nare actually things in their life that\nare driving them towards suicide what\nthat means is we will focus on treating\nsomething that may not be the problem so\nthis is something I've learned as a\ndoctor misdiagnosis is the biggest\nmistake you can\nmake I think I'm fixing thing a and the\nproblem is\nB and right now what we're seeing is a\nlarge increase in Suicidal Tendencies in\nmen for sure but also in\nwomen like proper true 21st century\nequality people we are seeing\nEqualization of mental illness which is\nnot a good thing it's a bad thing\nbecause everything is going up so now\nlet's take a look at another\nreaction\nokay sounds like a fulfillment issue\nyeah it sounds like like if you're if\nyou're in an area so like for instance I\nbelieve that people can get to a point\nto where their life is not worth living\nbut in order for you to think that your\nlife is not worth living I think you\nhave to have like some kind of mental\nillness going on except for like I said\nin some circumstances like if you've got\nextreme failing Health\num such that you're just like in pain\nall the time like I like I said there\nare some exceptions that that I can\nunderstand but for the most part I don't\nthink I think it means life's not worth\nliving is a conclusion people arrive at\nafter a lot of thought rather than a\nmalfunction brain I disagree I don't\nthink that's the case your something is\n in your brain then cuz there's\nnot there's just not humans acclimate a\nhealthy brain acclimates to an\nunbelievable amount of stuff like even\nI've said this before in stream I think\nit said yesterday even people who get\nare like handicapped like you can lose\nboth your legs you can have quadriplegic\nyou can have shut in or locked in\nsyndrome and even these people's\nhappiness will acclimate surprisingly\nquickly um so the idea that you've done\nsome rational analysis of your life\nyou're like wow I need to kill myself\nsomething\nis yeah something is not okay so I'm I'm\nsure at some point Destin and I or I I\nhope will actually have a conversation\nabout this because this F\nreacting back and forth\nis so look so I I respect Destiny a lot\nI think he's not wrong here and I\ndisagree so let's understand a couple of\nthings right so let's turn to the data\nso this is where like I'm not and there\nthere's data to the opposite of what I'm\nsaying so we're going to talk about the\nflaws and the data so the first idea is\nthat okay like people can have a life\nthat's crappy but if you're suicidal\nthere's one exception which is like\ndebilitating illness um and Destin's\nalso so correct that there are a lot of\nstudies that show that human beings\nacclimatize to like lower standards\nthat's true like if you lose a limb you\nwill and you ask someone would you\nrather lose both your hands or die\npeople will say I would rather lose both\nI would rather die than lose both of my\nhands but then if someone has an\naccident where they lose both of their\nhands heaven forbid then what you\ndiscover is they're like are you glad\nyou're alive today like yeah I\ndiscovered that I can still have fun I\nthink there are a couple of huge\ndisconnections here with some of the\nthings that Destiny is saying based on\nmy understanding as a clinician I don't\nblame the guy because you know he's not\na doctor which doesn't mean that he\ncan't have all of viewpoints he's\nactually exceptional at assimilating\ninformation without a professional\nbackground I think it's something I\nrespect about him a lot he's right about\nsome of this stuff and also let's look\nat some more data I think he's wrong\nabout some of it too\nbut okay so um this is a study called\nsuicide in the absence of disorder a\nreview of psychological autopsy studies\nacross\ncountries okay so we conducted a\nsystematic review of uh um what is PA\npsychological autopsy studies from 2000\nonwards okay up to\n66.7% of suicide cases remain without\ndiagnosis in those that only examined\nAIS one disorders so 14 studies looked\nat AIS one disorders which means more\nacute mental illness not personality\ndisorders in 66.7% of cases remained\nwithout a diagnosis approximately 37.1%\nof suicide cases had no psychiatric\ncondition in research papers that assess\npersonality and AIS one so if we start\nlooking at personality disorders like\nnarcissism or sociopathy or things like\nthat borderline personality disorder\nthen the number of undiagnosed people\ndrops to\n37% okay and then Steven does a great\njob of this he says later on we're not I\ndon't know exactly where he says it but\nhe says like I believe believe that\nthere are going to be studies which will\nshow no evidence of Mental Illness but I\nthink that is a case of undiagnosed\nmental illness that is really there and\ncausing them to malfunction okay so it's\nlike when we look at this study does\nthis mean that this person was not\nmentally ill or that they were mentally\nill and we just didn't pick it up okay\nso let's just look at another paper so I\nthink when I was talking about the the\nthe the actual study I was referencing\nwas this one um\nuh so this is from the American Journal\nof preventative medicine I think this is\na group out of UCLA is like the primary\nauthors here okay so these are like real\nresearch articles okay most male suicide\ndescendant uh deant had no known mental\nhealth conditions most\nokay um and more frequently those\nwithout known mental health conditions\ndied by firearm and many tested positive\nfor alcohol adolescence young uh adult\nmales and middle-aged males without\nknown mental health conditions more\noften had relationship problems\narguments and or a crisis is a\nprecipitating circumstance than those\nwith known mental health conditions so\nthis is really important to understand\nbecause what this study\nsuggests is that it's not just that\nwe're missing stuff it is that we can\nlook at these\ncases and what we can find is that prior\nto Suicide these people had relationship\nproblems arguments and or some kind of\ncrisis in their life okay\num now I'm going to show you all a paper\nthat counters this sort of okay so\num let me see if okay so this is a p\npaper on the epidemiology of suicide and\nfrom a psychiatric perspective I think\nthis this really looks at a lot of World\nHealth Organization\ndata\nuh yeah the majority of suicides\nworldwide are related to psychiatric\ndiseases Okay so here is another paper\nthat was published in 2018 which\nconcludes that across the\nglobe like most of these things seem to\nbe related to psychiatric illness so we\nhave some papers saying okay this is\nvery little like 2third are not\npsychiatrically ill we have some papers\nthat say the majority are not\npsychiatrically ill and they had\nrelationship problems and then we have\nsome papers saying that okay like\nsuicide like mental illness is a huge\nrisk factor for suicide and maybe\nassociated with suicide all that stuff\nis is fair right so how do we interpret\nthis\nstuff so this is where we've got to be\nsuper\ncareful so I want youall to really\nunderstand the way that we interpret\nthese and I think Destiny did a great\njob of kind of analyzing this right so\nwhen we look at a scientific paper and\nwe say okay the evidence suggests we do\nnot see any history of mental illness in\nsomewhere between 37 and 66% of people\nwho commit suicide men who commit\nsuicide now we have to be super careful\nbecause what a lot of people will\ndefault to is say okay this is\nundiagnosed Mental Illness but that's\nnot actually what the data\nshows right so this is where we we can\nsay like okay I believe\nthat fairies are responsible for curing\ncancer and then I look at a study that\nshows there's no evidence of fairies in\n66% of cases and then I say well I think\nthat fairies are interested are are an\nimportant part of curing cancer and in\nthose 66% of studies we just didn't\ndetect the\nfairies so we have to be super careful\nthere because what we're actually doing\nis we are taking a piece of data and we\nare interpreting it based on our belief\nsystem as opposed to looking what the\nactual data\nsays the actual data says there's no\nevidence of mental illness in somewhere\nbetween 37 and 66% of people now to\ncounter that point just like Destiny\npoint out we know that the rates of\nmental illness are undiagnosed or they\nhigh rates of undiagnosed mental illness\nwe don't really know what those are but\nwhatever our estimates of mental illness\nare they're certainly worse so there is\na very good argument to make that these\npeople are mentally\nill on balance I do not think that the\nrates of mental illness Mis like\nundiagnosed mental illness are super\nsuper high I tried to find St statistics\non it the numbers are somewhere between\n40 and 100% which means that if we're\ndiagnosing 20% of people with depression\nwhat that means is that the real number\nis somewhere between 30 and 40% it's not\nlike we're Mis Mis we're not missing\nlike you know n out of 10 people we're\nmissing maybe one out of two and that's\nsort of a generous estimate so even if\nwe assume that we're missing one out of\ntwo and we double the rates of of\ndetection right we're still like talking\nabout a large chunk of the population\nsomewhere between and 4% of the pop that\ndoesn't have a mental illness that's\ncommitting suicide and the other reason\nthat I believe that is because of\nstudies like this where I kind of show\nshowed yall that if we look at this like\nif we look at suicide we can see that\nthere are other precipitating factors\nthat aren't mental illness which is why\npeople kill themselves we we there's\ndata around this right so it's not just\nso I think it's a here's kind of where I\nam with this it is a valid it it is a\nshocking statistic that in the the most\nalarming studies 66.7% of people who\nkill themselves do not have mental\nillness that is an alarming statistic I\ndon't think that the number is actually\nthat high I think that we're missing a\nfair amount of mental illness for sure\nno question now how much I don't\nknow now we get to a core problem which\nis that this is not just like Dr K\nsaying this right so this is also where\nI should say that my clinical experience\nabout this has been scary because I I've\nworked with these people who I don't\nthink are mentally ill they just look at\ntheir life and they're like I can't do\nthis anymore this is not a sustainable\nway to live life and then you may say\nthen why not change it because they've\ntried and\nfailed they're not willing to make the\nchange they're unable to make the change\nthey are powerless to make the change\nthis is why you you you believe that\nyou're going to check out right and\nthat's where I think we need to help\nthem which is what I do in my job but\nwe've got to be super careful going back\nto this basic issue\nokay so when someone comes in and says\nmy life is\n what are we saying right what's the\nright move do we say to this person this\nperson comes in and I have suicidal\nideation do we assume that one% of\npeople are malfunction of the mind or do\nwe say okay like we're going to not be\npaternalistic therapists we are going to\nlisten to you we are going to\nacknowledge that you know your life\nbetter than we\ndo and if someone shows up and says all\nlives have value like I think that's\ngreat like I think it's great that you\nbelieve that now what I want you to do\nis if you're someone who believes this\nand what would it\ntake for you what would you have to go\nthrough\nto change this belief what would your\nexperience of Life have to be how bad\nwould your life have to be to change\nyour mind that Every Man Has a life\nworth\nliving what kind of would you have\nto go through to throw you off of\nthat and now what we really need to\nunderstand is that this is the\nexperience of people who were\nsuicidal instead of assuming that\nthey're weak or broken let's assume for\na moment that their lives are\nobjectively incredibly\nhard that their lives are nothing like\nthe lives that we\nlive because this is what I've seen and\nI'm not the only\none\nso there's another just these are emails\nthat I wrote to my friends a couple\nyears ago and I remember I I I showed\nthem to one of my uh one of my\ncolleagues and I was like you know I I\nwas thinking about talking about some of\nthis stuff publicly and and I was like\nyou know but I I'm not ready to yet\nbecause I'm pretty sure I'm going to\nlose my job you know at Harvard and\nacademic position and he was like oh no\nno no if you talk about this you're not\ngoing to just lose your academic\nposition you're going to lose all of\nyour\npositions and so I was like oh okay\ninteresting so yeah got to make\nstrategic moves um I know so Abba Atlas\nalso is an awesome content creat Creator\nwe talked we had a conversation on men's\nissues like years ago and like that's\nwhat the climate was back then and\nthankfully I think the climate is better\nnow like so you know it's challenging\nstuff and I think this is the reason\nright so the moment that you start\nsaying stuff like this people will start\ninterpreting all kinds of weird things\nnot weird things I think they're\nreasonable but it's like you know so so\nthis is this is\nwhere let's understand like the dialogue\nhere because there this is important\nit's not that if I acknowledge that my\nclient or patient has a life that is not\nworth living that doesn't mean I tell\nthem to go kill themselves in fact quite\nthe opposite I'm just going to say this\nagain it's to say hey bro I understand\nthat you have a life that you think is\nnot worth living I would like to help\nyou deal with these objective\nproblems instead of just assuming that\nyou're you have a bunch of cognitive\nbias which is making you misunderstand\nwhat's going on what I would like to\nhelp you do is find a romantic\nrelationship build a\ncareer you know get\nbuild a\nbody that\nyou are\nnot embarrassed\nabout right these are the actual\ngoals and in order to accomplish these\nthree things in my experience as a\nclinician that's when we get to this\nbecause this stuff interferes with this\nin a way that they don't understand\nright in this word am I being\npaternalistic no I mean I think there's\nactually like a skill set of things that\npeople who are in this situation have\nnever had the benefit of learning and\ndue to issues like trauma and stuff like\nthat they have so many like they have so\nmany things going against them that they\njust have no ability to start because\nthat's not how I mean human beings don't\nreally pull themselves up by their\nbootstraps almost never sometimes it\nhappens but generally speaking what we\nknow is like hum who are successful are\nsuccessful because they get other humans\nto help them and at the beginning of the\nat the top list is like parenting\nhealthy parenting is such a huge\nadvantage in life and what is healthy\nparenting healthy parenting is help the\nmost important help that you will ever\nreceive in your life is from your\nparents and if you did not get that help\nyou have such a disadvantage but that\ndoesn't mean that the problem is in your\nhead that means that you may actually\nhave a life that is quite crappy that\ndoesn't mean that you should kill\nyourself it just means we need to do a\nbetter job of helping you so let's look\nat some other\npapers\nokay um this one we'll skip for\nnow\nso so this is kind of\ninteresting so a couple years ago we had\nsomeone come up with this concept of\ndiseases of Despair so what we did is we\nlooked at let me see if this is the\npaper no we'll get to this let me find\nthis I want to find the one with the\ndiagram do you have the diagram no you\ndon't have the diagram do you have the\ndiagram where's the\ndiagram here we go this\npaper\nso we started to realize something we\nsaw some disturbing Trends\nokay so for example\ndeaths from diseases of Despair in\nBritain comparing suicide alcohol rated\nand drug related mortality for birth\ncohorts in Scotland England Wales and\nselected\ncities so a couple of people noticed\nsomething and they noticed something\nkind of scary okay so I'll show you so\nthis is a a Trends in the diagnosis of\ndiseases of Despair in the United States\nbetween 2009 and 2018 yall ready ready\nto get wrecked we'll talk about what\ndiseases of Despair\nare 5\n15,834 me male median 36 years from 2009\nto 2018 the prevalence of alcohol rated\nsubstance related and suicider related\ndiagnoses respectively increased by 37%\n94% and\n170% ages 55 to 74 had the largest\nincrease in alcohol substance related\ndiagnoses hey let's try to be a little\nbit kinder to the Boomers can we do that\nthat please can we I know some of them\nare not nice to us but can we please be\nkind to the Boomers and here's here's\ny'all ready y'all ready internet\ngeneration gen Alpha gen Z ages less\nthan 18 had the overall had the largest\nincrease in suicid related diagnosis\n287\nper. the odds ratio for men is 1.49\nwhich means that one and a half times\nlike as likely or 50% more\nlikely\nokay and then there's some stuff about\nthe Affordable Care\nAct so like this is scary right and this\nis by the way is related to diagnosis\nthis is not talking about this is not a\nstudy looking at people who kill\nthemselves who don't have a diagnosis\nbut what does this mean diseases of\nDespair so here's the other like crazy\nthing which if you look at this research\nlike here's what you begin to see we're\ngoing to talk about addiction and\nsuicide for a hot\nsecond so in my experience there are two\nroots to\naddiction number one you have an\naddiction number two you are slow\nplaying\nsuicidality so now it sounds kind of\ncrazy but let's understand this see when\nyou're suicidal you've given up on life\nlife isn't worth living so what do you\ndo right in the worst cases that we want\nto try to prevent you kill\nyourself but you don't have to kill\nyourself fast the other thing you can do\nis get in the\naddiction and as I've worked with more\nand more people with addiction what I've\nstarted to realize is this is a slow\nsuicide my life is empty I have nothing\nto look forward to so what am I going to\ndo today let me go ahead and the\nworld and my future and\neverything around me I'm going to get\nhigh I'm going to jerk off I'm going to\nwatch porn I'm going to play video games\nbecause life has nothing to offer so I'm\njust going to indulge in this\ndopaminergic\nspurt addiction diagnoses I think in\nlike I want to say\n30% ballpark honestly the number is\nprobably higher these people have given\nup on life and they're just extracting\nwhatever they can from this biological\nsack while they're\nalive honestly that's been my experience\nand this is what the diseases of Despair\ntell us so a group of clinicians realize\nsomething really\ninteresting which is that there's a\ngroup of people who seem to be\ndespairing in life\nthese are people who it's not quite\ndepression so this is not like a\nneurochemistry imbalance in the brain\nthat is triggering all this there are\ngroups of people so if you look at\nresearch in the UK fishing villages in\nthe UK are notorious for\nthis the economy\nsucks these are often times young men\nwho are given these attitudes of\nIndependence and being like what makes a\ngood man a good man provides and when\nthe economic situation that you live in\nallows you to no longer provide you can\nno longer be a good man and what do you\ndo you turn to alcohol and other kinds\nof thing that's why they look at if you\nlook at the the diseases of Despair\nthere's a reason why they look at these\nparticular diagnoses they're not looking\nat like generalized anxiety disorder or\nOCD there is a different kind of\nconstruct which is when people genuinely\nhave a life that is crappy with very\nlittle opportunity we see a certain\npsychiatric\nmanifestation okay so I'm going to just\nrun through like a sample example of\nlike what this conceptual model of\ndiseases of Despair this is a fantastic\narticle by the way so let's look at\nwhere this starts like so here's the key\nthing to\nunderstand mental health outcomes is at\nthe end this is the terminal event this\nis not the cause this is the\noutcome okay so we have proximal life\nstressors like social rejection loss of\nstatus economic hardship loss of purpose\nlife events low resourced environment\nlack of stable employment social network\nthis is the actual\nstart Protestant work ethic I guess is\nassociated with it self-reliance and\nIndependence masculine culture oh\nme you're telling me that on the\nflowchart of mental illness is masculine\nculture and societal expectations\nme historical events childhood adversity\neconomic\nchallenges suicide contagion in media\nand then we get to the person this is\nstuff that is completely outside of our\ncontrol thoughts no one cares about me\nor will help me the system/ others have\nbetrayed me nothing will ever get better\nI should be able to fix this other\npeople don't understand me I'm broken\nI'm helpless I'm weak I'm a bad person\nokay now this is where we can say okay\ndoesn't this mean that this person is\nmentally ill\nsadly I don't\nknow sadly I think the reason that a lot\nof people believe this is because\nthey're conditioned to believe this\nbecause they've been taught this in some\nway now often times they qualify as a\nmental illness but like it's really sad\nbut this is not a malfunction of the\nbrain this is programming is it mental\nillness because it impairs their\nfunction\nabsolutely but when you have a child\nwho's raised in traumatic circumstances\nchildhood adversity abuse of parents\nthis is the way that they see the world\nand they're not wrong\nthis is what happens when you get\ntraumatized you develop survival\nmechanisms which become maladaptive\nlater we have a whole guide coming out\nin maybe like a month or two about\nthis right and so then there's emotions\nand then we get to some of this stuff\nthed belongingness perceived burden\nburdensomeness which is really scary\nokay so I want yall to understand these\ntwo we'll go into more detail in a\nsecond so when we look at theories of\nsuicidality\nwhat we find is that there are a couple\nof really damning things that really\nlead towards suicidality and mental\nillness is absolutely huge risk factor\nbut what researchers have actually done\nis they've tunnel down and and looked at\nthe people forget about the diagnosis\nfor a second what actually happens in\nthis person's life and what they\ndiscover is there are two\nthings one is perceived burdensomeness\nand the second is thwarted belongingness\nnow what do these\nmean this means\nthat first of all I'm a burden to those\naround me right this is perceived\nBurness burdensomeness it's not clear\nhow I don't know how you objectively\nmeasure burden but these people go\nthrough life or at some point they start\nto believe that like I'm more of a\nburden\nthan a help I don't contribute anything\nI'm just a taker and the other one\nthat's really devastating which I think\nwe see a lot of now this this one I\nthink is getting worse is thwarted\nbelongingness\nthis is where people try to belong I\ncome to a group of people and I say hey\ncan I hang out with you and everyone\nsays ew\nno and this is like this is where you're\nlike hey I'm a human being I'm trying to\nconnect with y'all and people are like\nthank you but no thank\nyou and in a sense this is reasonable\nright because no I mean I'll hear this a\nlot especially in terms of gender\nDynamics and and everyone's like I'm not\nresponsible for fixing this other\nperson's problem it is not my\nresponsibility to be this person's\nfriend it is not my responsibility to\ninclude this person it is their\nresponsibility to fix themselves find\ntheir own things I'm not responsible for\nanother human being this is the the\nvalue system that we live in today in\nthe west at least and that's reasonable\nright like I'm not responsible for some\nrandom person on the\nstreet but then we're still left with\nthe problem of if you're not responsible\nand I'm not responsible and this person\nisn't responsible and this person isn't\nresponsible then who is\nresponsible so what I\nsee is a group of people and this is\nhappening a lot with men it's happening\nwith women\ntoo I see it more in minority women and\nfrankly women who are don't adhere or\ndon't have the biology to adhere to\nstandard beauty standards some of the\nloneliest\nwomen\nand what happens is like these people\ndon't know how to connect right often\ntimes from a young age they're bullied\ntechnology enters the picture we don't\nknow how to like we don't have social\nspaces anymore we're spending all of our\ntime on Discord and then like once\nyou're 29 years old and you've never\nbeen in a relationship and you don't\nquite know how to dress when people look\nat you what do they see they see a\ncreep a creep is the most devastating\nlabel you can get cuz what does it mean\nto be a creep does it mean that you did\nsomething wrong no does it mean that\nyou're bad in some way like did you did\nyou actually do something are you a\nthief\nno are you harmful\nno you're a\ncreep what does that mean it means that\nI don't want to spend time with you but\nI don't have a very clear reason that's\nwhy we use the word creep right so if\nsomeone is like a rapist that makes\nsense they're a rapist that's why I\ndon't want to spend if someone's a thief\nwe have we understand if someone is a\nLeague of Legends player we understand\nwhy no one want to spend time with them\nokay but creep is like a word that we\napply to this and like what a damning\ndiagnosis because what do you do about\nthat like you don't have social skills\nnow you get ostracized now how are you\nsupposed to get them and this is where\nwe have another huge problem so if we\nlook at show you another quick paper I\njumped\nahead we there's another problem\nhere um\nthis is a paper called masculinity\nhelp-seeking among men with depression a\nqualitative study\nuh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nblah um okay so like the other problem\nthat we have is that as\nmen we don't know how to ask for\nhelp and that's because we're raised\nwith these masculine Norms of\nIndependence okay\nand as we we get raised with these Norms\nof Independence sorry for the LW\ncomment I I'll take it I'll take a dig\nat a couple other games before we're\ndone okay so we as men are not taught\nhow to ask for help and so there's like\ndata that shows that women are taught\nhow to ask for help we we'll we'll we'll\nshow that a little bit later because\nthere's a second point to it so I think\nanother huge problem that we have is if\nyou're a man today like you're you're\nsort of taught that you're supposed to\nbe dependent right and this is where a\nlot of people will say like oh but like\nmen you know when we talk about these\nsoal Norms there's a there's like a\ntrend to say like no like I'm not like\nthat right so we say like okay men\nshould be allowed to like a man\nexpressing your emotions is absolutely\nokay like men should be allowed to\nexpress their\nemotions\nreally which\nones men can cry oh interesting what if\nI have other emotions what if I feel\nangry am I allowed to express that as a\nman and this is where I I think Destiny\nkind of reacts to this too is a really\ncommon thing so we as men are\nconditioned to to express anger and feel\nanger it's the only thing okay we kind\nof like we talked about this on Diary of\nCEO a little bit and I think Destiny\nreacted to it but basically I was kind\nof pointing out that you know if you're\ngetting bullied what are you supposed to\ndo as a dude you're supposed to fight\nback right and like what we're supposed\nto do is get pissed and you guys can\nwatch any movie that has a male\nprotagonist I will guarantee you I guess\nI can't guarantee 99% confidence I don't\neven watch movies anymore that at some\npoint the man will get angry in a\nrighteous and positive way and this will\nbe a turning point in the\nmovie right you can watch a movie like\ntaken where spoiler alert it's about\nsomeone whose daughter gets abducted and\nwhat does the man do the man does what\nhe's supposed to do which is get pissed\nand everyone is like this is what a man\nshould be I want a dad like Liam\nniss you can look at any\nanything and then like now we have this\nlike very very contrived vulnerability\nof like oh yeah like it's okay for a man\nto cry but they're so manly when they\ncry like they have such big muscles when\nthey\ncry right they don't show like the\nsnot in the vomit in the dejection in\nthe self-hatred in the self loathing\nthey don't show the crying for hours and\nhours and hours it's like 5 minutes and\nthen there's a pad on the back and then\nthere's like positive anger and then\nwe're going to go fix our lives let's go\nbe men men about it and then we're going\nto have big dicks at the end of all\nthat so what what happens and and this\nis a such a common experience that I see\nin relationships is that women are\nconditioned that it's okay to cry and by\nthe way women get by not being\nable to express anger as well okay so\nit's not like just because men have\nthese challenges does not mean that\nwomen don't have challenges and in fact\nwhen it comes to anger women especially\nare punished for it so we're punished\nless as men it's the only tool we're\ntaught but if you're you're a woman and\nyou get angry especially in some place\nlike the\nworkplace you will be judged so\nharshly\nokay but this is what happens we're only\ntaught to express anger\nand then what happens we've started to\ndemonize anger in men right it's\ntestosterone they're fundamentally\nviolent these creatures cannot be\ntrusted all men are bad men cannot be\ntrusted and what is it that triggers\nthese it's expressions of\nanger so we're allowed to like sort of\nexpress our emotions but they have to be\nthe right emotions and in this\nway now we have entered the lot of women\nbecause for the last 200 years this has\nbeen true of women women women are\nallowed to only express a slice of\nemotions and men are only allowed to\nexpress a slice of\nemotions and so like this is a the kind\nof thing where we have to be\nindependent we express anger we get\nostracized we there's a sense of thored\nbelongingness and then what we end up\nwith is we get called creeps and then\nthe worst thing is that we don't know\nhow to ask for help we don't we're not\ntaught how to ask for help in fact we're\ntaught the\nopposite\nand so then what ends up happening is\nthat we don't know where to\ngo but we certainly know that there's\none group of people on the internet who\nunderstands our\nplight right because the rest of the\ninternet says oh yeah you're a man\nyou're privileged everything's Gucci for\nyou you you don't understand how good\nyou have it stupid me I didn't\nunderstand how good I had it right and\nsometimes that's true sometimes you do\nhave narcissistic people who have no\nidea how good they have it maybe I'm one\nof them who\nknows and so the one Refuge that they\nhave is the alpha males the red pillars\nand the\nincels and everyone's like oh my God\nthis is toxic masculinity these people\nhave nowhere else to go they tried to\njoin you and you kicked them out so what\ndo they do anytime you ostracize a group\nof people they're going to form their\nown\ncommunity and so if you guys have a\nproblem with toxic masculinity like how\nabout you be nicer to dudes so that you\ndon't have to shut them all out and then\nthey're going to congregate and then\nit'll get radicalized because that's\nwhat happens when you shut people out\nand then the other problem is these\npeople don't know how to ask for help\nand so instead the other real challenge\nhere and I don't blame people for\ndisliking them because the way in which\nthey approach other people is so\ntoxic right they're like all women are\nblah blah blah blah blah and like I\ndeserve this and I'm entit to this and\nlike they exhibit behaviors and use\ndialogue that is so damn poic polarizing\nantagonizing and then once they piss us\noff we're trying to be nice to them and\nthen they start opening it's like\nopening up this can of worms where\nthere's like Litany of like red pill\nwhatever the sexual Marketplace\nvalue and other kinds of pseudo science\nmating that these people have\nnever read a scientific\npaper right maybe they have I don't know\nthey like they have all these like\nideas right like Alpha and beta which\nlike the original person was like this\nis not\ncorrect the original researcher who\ncoined the\nterms and then they say things that make\nus not want to help them it's so hard\nand we're not taught how to ask for help\nright like how do you ask for\nhelp you can say you can point out what\nyour deficiency is you can point out\nthat you're striving for something and\nthen you can ask for help right so this\nis stuff that I literally teach my\npatients hey I notic that I'm not very\ngood at making\nfriends I would love to be like a better\nhuman being and a member of a community\nand contribute to like the people around\nme can you please help me strengthen my\nrelationships that's the thing point out\na flaw that you have pick a goal that\nyou want to strive towards and then ask\nfor help\nhey I noticed a\ndeficiency this is where I want to go\ncan you help me one two\n3 this the best way to ask for help I\ndon't know that\nscientifically I haven't looked at like\nmet analysis on different methods of\nhelp\nseeking right but we're not taught\nthis so someone struggles like they\ndon't know what to do they get judged as\na creep they have fewer economic\nopportunities and we're going to get I\nhave other ones hold on I have more\npapers I'm not done with the\npapers\nuh give me a\nsecond\nokay I'm gonna pause\nhere so I'm gonna ask\ny'all\nokay what do y'all want from me\nwe've got 45 minutes left so if y'all\nwant I will talk to you\nabout my take on the pathogenesis and\nhow to approach suicidality in\nmen it's not that I dislike women it's\nthat there are gender specific things\nI'm actually actively working on two\nlectures right now one is ADHD for women\nsecond is autism in women so I think\nthere are gender specific manifestations\nof mental illness which need to be\naddressed it just takes me a little bit\nlonger to do the stuff on women because\nI'm not a woman which means that I have\nto do like more research because I don't\nwant to be paternalistic right so I have\nto just it takes me twice as long to\nprepare a lecture for women as it does\nto prepare a lecture for men because I\nhave 41 years of experience being a\ndude\nokay do you guys have any questions\nabout what I've talked about so\nfar\nyeah so I'm I'm working on it Rosalie\num then be a woman I'm working on that\n[Music]\ntoo\nokay\nall right\nso okay\nso all right do you guys want to talk\nmore about male suicidality do youall\nhave questions or like what I mean I\nsee feet picks and only\nfans I have no idea how to interpret\nthat but that's not going to happen\ntoday because we're talking about the\nimportance of male suicide okay so I am\nthe prize\nchat\nokay okay so we're g to talk about all\nright so we're going to talk more about\nmale suicide okay I don't know who to\nask for help okay great I not great but\nwe're going to address that all right\nokay\nall right let's start by looking at a\npaper this is a fantastic paper\nexploring the psychology of suicidal\nideation a theory driven network\nanalysis so let's understand why people\nkill\nthemselves\nso if we look at theoretical models for\nsuicidal Behavior this is something that\nwe're going to talking about I'm going\nto show you all the actual model and\nthen I'll talk youall through it okay so\nthwarted belongingness is I'm trying to\nconnect with other people and I'm alone\nand perceived Burness I'm a burden and\nthen capability of suicide and then\ndesire for suicide and then this is kind\nof the V diagram and if you fit all\nthese things that this is when you're at\nhigh risk so the other thing to kind of\nthink about is if we look\nat how someone ends up committing\nsuicide what we see is that it's way\nmore complicated than a mental illness\nso we have what's called pre\nmotivational phase the background\nfactors and triggering events so this is\nthe way that you were raised the way\nthat you see the\nworld and then we have motivation and\nvolition so let's understand the\ndifference between motivation and\nvolition motivation is what I\nwant right it is my drive volition is my\nactions and so what we tend to see is\nthat over time what'll happen for people\nwho are suicidal and I'm going to sort\nof refer to men sometimes and just\nsuicidal people sometimes the different\npapers are looking at different\nthings okay so what what tends to happen\nis we have a sense of\nentrapment so I'll give you all kind of\nlike um and I think it's internal\nentrapment hold on let me make sure I\nhave this\nright internal\nentrapment I antis fatter yes\nokay so what tends to happen is we start\noff with like kind of this this\nunfortunate situation which we'll get\ninto then what happens is we feel\ntrapped and more often we feel trapped\nby our internal circumstances more so\nthan our external circumstances and\nwe'll talk a little bit about what it\nmeans to be trapped what it means to be\ntrapped is basically that your internal\nenvironment is not something that you\ncan get away from so every day becomes\nsuffering every day becomes hopeless\nevery day there is a negative space\nwithin you that you cannot act to change\nthis is a very common experience it's a\nvery powerful variable is this\nexperience of like I can't change the\nway that I\nfeel and then what happens is we have\nsomething called volitional factors so\nthis is what we focus on a lot as\nclinicians so we focus on things like\naccess to suicidal means so we try to\nremove guns from the household we try to\nlike make it hard for people to commit\nsuicide because often times suicidal\nbehavior is\nimpulsive so it's very common I want to\nsay like 90% of people decide to kill\nthemselves within one hour of doing\nit uh I could be wrong on the specific\nstatistics there I think 50% make a\ndecision within 5 minutes and then like\nit's 80 to 90% or within one hour so the\nsort of idea that we have from the media\nthat everyone like puts their Affairs in\norder is probably not correct there's\nsome awesome research by Matt KN also\nMaltsberger these are two excellent\nsuicide researchers strongly recommend\nyou check out their work\nso what we kind of see from this theory\nof suicide is that it's kind of like\nthis stretch of like stuff that kind of\ngets put together and as we talk about\nmen let's like I'm going to focus on men\nfor a little bit because I think it's\nrelevant let's understand how this\nhappens so how does a man become\nsuicidal so if we look at diseases of\nDespair what we start with we start to\nrealize is I'm a\ndude and as a good man I'm supposed to\ndo certain things I'm supposed to be\nindependent right I'm supposed to be\nself-sufficient I'm supposed to be\ncapable I'm supposed to be\nstrong right this is what it means to be\na man I'm supposed to take care of\nothers there's also another really\ninteresting variable here I'm supposed\nto be able to tolerate pain so this is a\nreally interesting gender specific\nsuicidal manifestation so people have\nbeen asking themselves for a while why\ndo men kill themselves at four times why\ndo for every one woman who kills herself\nfour men kill themselves why so one of\nthe interesting hypothesis is that as\nmen we are taught to tolerate pain and\nif you ask people what keeps you from\nkilling yourself often times people will\nsay I'm Afra of the pain so if you look\nat a protective Factor against suicide\nit's pain so my my since I'm such a wuss\nand I'm afraid of pain I'm not going to\nkill myself but literally there are\nstudies that explore this right I don't\nknow how conclusively they show it that\nbasically as men get better and better\nat tolerating\npunishment right because it's always\nlike you know if you your family gets\nattacked by a tiger it's not women and\nchildren to the front it's men to the\nfront right like literally like when it\ncomes to military conscription and stuff\nlike that it's like we send men into war\nto die like we're expected to do this\nwe're expected to experience pain and\nsuffering and whatever I'm not going to\nget into the biological evolutionary\nwhatever of that and whether that's good\nor bad or I don't know it's beyond my\narea of expertise but what we do know is\nthat men are taught to take punishment\nand since we're good at taking\npunishment we're like it's easier for us\nto kill ourselves because we're not\nafraid of the pain it's like the pain of\ndeath ain't nothing compared to the pain\nof\nlife okay so now this creates other\nkinds of problems so we also have a\ncouple of other things one is that we\nare\nalexic okay this means that we are\nunaware of our internal emotional\nstate and then the other thing that\nwe've got going for us is a combination\nof these two things since we don't\nmanage our emotions we don't ask for\nhelp we don't do any of that stuff then\nwe've got this pile of\nemotions and we also tend to use\nsubstances and addictions to treat them\nthis is what men do right remember this\nthe diseases of\nDespair let's take a\nlook 37 94% alcohol related and\nsubstance use related\ndiagnosis 55 to 74 the lar largest\nincrease in alcohol and substance\nrelated diagnoses holy\nJesus 172% increase in substance related\ndiagnoses between the ages of 55 and 74\nthat's because the Boomers this is agism\nso I'm going to rephrase but in a more\nfactual way I was about to say the\nBoomers don't believe in emotions so but\npractically what that is is that the\nboomer generation was not taught EQ\nskills even at the level that we're\ntaught today so they struggle more with\nemotions than we do because it was like\nyou think they're bad with us about\nemotional validation you should see\ntheir parents their parents were way\nworse than they are like the boomer\ngeneration has done an awesome job in\nmany ways I know it's like oh my God\nthis is going to get me\ncancelled but like they had it rough too\nthey had some things that were really\ngood like unprecedented economic growth\nokay but they struggle too all\nright and for the record I I don't think\nit helps to crap on any group of people\nlike it just doesn't help us be more\ncompassionate like We're All in This\nTogether the nicer we are to the Boomers\nhopefully the nicer they'll be to us we\nshould all be nice to each other We're\nAll in This Together like life is not a\nzero sum game where in order for me to\nwin you have to lose it's like a\ngame of DOTA where if you int and run\ndown mid you ruin things for yourself\nand you ruin things for your teammate\nlike we're in this\ntogether\nokay so what does this\ncreate so this creates like a problem\nbecause if you're a\ndude and you have a good\nlife then things are actually pretty\ngood because you may not need the help\nas much you have some advantages of a\npatriarchal Society I as a medical\nstudent got mistaken as a doctor my\nfemale colleagues when they were doctors\ngot mistaken for nurses like there are\nsome advantages to being a man but what\nI tend to find is that these advantages\nare really really like capitalized on by\nmen who have good lives so men who have\nthe opportunity for higher\neducation fuckups like myself like if my\nparents were poor I would not be here\ntoday the only reason that I'm I'm here\ntoday is when I failed out of college I\nhad someone who was there to pay my rent\nI had someone who could send me to India\nand study yoga and meditation I had\nsomeone to help me financially support\nmyself through medical school and if\nthey hadn't helped support me through\nmedical school and my wife helped\nsupport me through medical school then I\nwould be so racked up in loans that I\nwould have never been able to start\nhealthy\ngamer right so like I am I am born a\nprivilege and I'm grateful for that and\nI think those of us that are born for\nprivilege should try to do something\ngood in the world in what capacity we\nhave and I would love it if other people\nwho are privileged didn't wait till they\nwere dead to do their\ncharity right like we need your help now\nfor those of you all that are very very\ncapable of helping and I get that it's\nlike an awesome charitable donation to\nin your will leave your money to good\norganizations like I'm grateful for that\nbut like you know if you really want to\nbe nice can you do it while you're alive\nbecause in the 30 years that you're\ngoing to be\nhere like people need help too\nanyway the challenge is that if you have\na bad\nlife it's very hard for men to recover\nand that's because we're supposed to be\nindependent so no\nhelp okay we don't know what we're\nfeeling\nemotionally and so without emotional\nawareness and emotional healing these\nemotions negatively impact us so for\nexample when I feel\nashamed what is the purpose of Shame the\npurpose of Shame is to enact corrective\nBehavior so if I feel ashamed for not\nhaving money so I have very little\nmoney right so this is the kind of thing\nwhere like what I'm supposed to do is\nlike work hard and get a job and pull\nyourself up by by bootstrap son come on\ncome on boy bootstrap time let's go come\non but this only works if I live in an\nenvironment that has Economic\nOpportunity and this is why we see\ndiseases of Despair like literally like\nin like Wales and Scotland and places\nlike this because in these situations\nlike you can pull yourself up by your\nbootstraps as much as you want to\nthere's no up there's no up nowhere to\ngo like these are like fishing villages\nthat no longer have\nfishing it's like a huge problem in the\nUK okay and so then we don't know like\nwe don't talk to people we don't know\nhow to ask for help and then what we end\nup doing is self-medicating\nright and this is where we sort of end\nup with like slow\nsuicide which is\naddiction and what do I base that on I'm\nkind of clustering it into diseases of\nDespair if you look at the research on\ndiseases of Despair what you dis disease\nof Despair what you discover is that\nthere is a common element that leads to\nsubstance use\nand suicide that's why we cluster them\nbecause there's a shared\nroute\nokay and then what ends up happening is\nlike we're kind of stuck so now what\nhappens is that I'm here and then I have\nremember this this is my\nobjective versus m\nmalfunction I can't find one of the\npapers I was looking for maybe it's this\none this isn't the one I'm looking for\nI will find\nit so here's what we kind of\nknow so now what we've got oh\nsorry now we've now we get back to this\nthing right so now we have a human being\nwhose objective life is not very good so\nthey have very little in the way of\nrelationships they have very little in\nthe way of\nprospects they have very little in the\nway of\nromance right and so one person may have\nlike one of these three like so people\nwill have some amount of\nthis and then then what happens is this\nover time creates cognitive distortions\nabsolutely and this leads to mental\nillness okay so if we kind of go at our\ngo look at our diseases of Despair\ndiagram right so then we get to this\nregion so this is like the circumstances\nand then we start to see all these\nproblems within us and then this results\nin mental illness substance use\ndisorders depression suicidal\nideation\nokay now this is where you know when\nwhen Destiny says like yeah I think at\nsome point like even if their lives are\nobjectively bad they become mentally ill\nand he's not wrong I I personally don't\nagree with that but I think it's a\ncompletely defensible\nposition now the challenge is that when\nthings become mental illness the\nantidote is\ntherapy or medical treatment which I'm\nin favor\nof but here's what I honestly feel so if\nyou're a therapist who's alive\ntoday and this is the reason I started\nhealthy\ngamer so people would come into my\noffice and they'd say like I'm depressed\nand I'd say why are you depressed\nthey're like I've got no job I've got no\ngirlfriend I play video games all day\nand I was like you know what bro that\nsounds like a pretty depressing life\nright I would be depressed\ntoo and then the more that I started\nhelping people the more that I started\nto realize that we as therapists are\nhere to try to help people with their\ncognitive biases the malfunctions of\ntheir mind but so many of their problems\nare outside of the\noffice so many of their problems are\nactually bad things in their\nlife not malfunctions up\nhere and so what it feels like to me as\na therapist I'll just give youall an\nanalogy so like you know there's like\nthe king or the queen and the king or\nthe queen has like the Queen's guard or\nthe King's Guard so you have these like\nelite soldiers small number 20 of them\nand we're here to protect the king we're\nthe last line of\ndefense and what it feels like to be a\ntherapist today is to be the King's\nGuard and have no other soldiers ahead\nof you there are huge macro level forces\nof people who are unemployed or\nunderemployed inflation people 50% of\npeople under the age of 30 are living at\nhome we have toxic\nworkplaces we have all kinds of like\nproblems we've got social media and\nvideo games and pornography and there's\nall this tide of crap that we can't hold\nat Bay these are the macro forces which\nthere are plenty of research studies\nabout if you guys want to see them I can\nshow them to you\nlater and then what we are as therapists\nso we're like the King's Guard we're\nlike the last line of defense it's like\nif you're suicidal today we're going to\nsend you to the emergency room and we're\ngoing to do really intensive stuff but\nwe as a society are not fixing all of\nthe stuff that got you\nhere and so therapy is incredibly\nimportant we do a noble job but holy\n are we outgunned we are so\noutgunned we literally I trained for\neight years to become a\npsychiatrist right that's like King's\nGuard material right there eight years\nof\ntraining but when I look at the majority\nof people who walk into my\noffice more Economic\nOpportunity\nhaving other humans in your life like I\nI can help you with your cognitive\ndistortions I cannot make up for the\ndeficiency of hugs from the last 10\nyears of your\nlife a loneliness\nepidemic is going on right\nnow something is wrong with our\nsociety as we become more and more\nindependent we have stopped taking\nresponsibility for each other as human\nbeings I can't fix that as a\npsychiatrist I can do a lot I can help\nyou with your cognitive distortions I'm\ngoing to treat whatever malfunctions you\nare and we do an awesome job we're all\n burnt out by the\nway but if you really look at some of\nthese things and I can't find the paper\nbut there's one really good diagram that\nreally illustrates how there are these\nmacroeconomic forces that then Cascade\ndown into an individual and then this\nperson enters the\noffice and we can do a lot but like\nreally what we're seeing is a very tight\ncorrelation between the worsening of\neconomic conditions and the worsening of\nmental illness because when a human\nbeing doesn't have a life that's worth\nliving it's easy to become\nsuicidal and so what should you do about\nit so the first thing get therapy seek\nhelp right so I say this as someone who\nmade a video that went viral about why\ntherapy sucks for men still think yall\nshould get therapy I'm a therapist I\nthink it's great I'm an advocate for\nit and it is insufficient but that's\nwhere we're going to start\nokay so here's why a couple of things so\nif you are a man who is suicidal today\nthe reason that I think you should not\ngive up is because chances are you have\nnot received the help that you need and\nthe life that you're living today is\nbasically you're playing an mm RPG but\noffline and by\nyourself this is content that was\ndesigned as a 40 Man raid but you're not\nconnected to the internet and of course\nyou're going into Blackwing\nlayer or whatever ragnaros right and I'm\nmy like level 60 Rogue let's go to\nragnaros and then ragnaros two shots me\nand I'm like what the and then I'm\nlike you know what I'm going to be\nresilient so I respawn I repair my\n gear I go and grind right\nbecause I can't clear instances so I\nlike grind on BS there's no auction\nhouse so I grind on BS for like 15 hours\nand I sell them for some measly amount\nof silver and then I repair my gear and\nthen I go in to fight ragnaros again and\nI\nwipe this is what it's like to be\ndepressed everything you do is harder\npeople don't understand that if you're\nnot depressed the things that we take\nfor granted is people who are mentally\nwell like try to play\nby yourself and see how far you get\nthat's what it's like to be\ndepressed so I'm not disputing that your\nlives are bad but what I think\nconsistently helps is\nhelp and this is where it's incredibly\nchallenging because some people will say\nI've been and I've had these people too\nthey'll be like I've seen six therapists\nsix psychiatrists nothing\nhelps so we're going to talk about that\nfor a second we're going to talk about\nhelp okay\nwhere's my\npaper not this one here we\ngo so this is where I think there's\nthere's a big challenge in therapy right\nnow so let's take a look at Men's social\nrelationships and mental health\nokay um most sex differences studies\nfocus on two broad types of support\nemotional support which includes\nemotional sustenance and empathy for\nexample someone being available to\nlisten or offer sympathy during a time\nof Crisis now hold on don't read\nanymore so if you're a dude in the\naudience today or you know someone who's\nsuicidal has some suicidal ideation\nright go get help for real go to the\nemergency room get some\nhelp and I were to offer you hello I'm\nhere to talk to you about your problems\nwe're going to talk about how you feel\nthat we're going to talk about your\nfeelings I'm going to say oh my God\nthat's so hard for you that must be so\nhard for you oh my God that must be so\nhard for you that must be so hard for\nyou that's not what the men who come to\nmy practice\nwant they love it that's not what they\nwant if I try to give it to them they\nreject it I squeeze it in a little\nbits what do they want hey I want to do\nsomething about my life I want to fix my\nproblems right because remember some of\nthese people aren't mentally ill their\nbrain isn't malfunctioning and they have\nobjective problems and they want want\ncan y'all can y'all guess they want\ninstrumental support which includes\npractical Assistance or tangible help\nfrom others for example help that\nrequires physical effort or financial\naid so this isn't I'm not giving them\nloans and I'm not helping them move but\nwhat I tend to find is if you look at a\nlot of men's frustration with therapy\nwhat they're really looking for is\nsomething called instrumental support\nand this is not what the majority of our\ntherapy is this is not what the majority\nof therapists are trained on we're\ntrained in emotional support but what we\nfind is that like instrumental support\nis like really really effective for men\nso like when a dude like literally I had\na my Psychotherapy teacher right so I\nhad a dactic 16 weeks of here's what\nPsychotherapy is and a psychoanalyst\ncomes in and says and maybe I'm doing\nthem they taught me a lot of good stuff\nright so so don't they're not bad people\nthey're\nbrilliant but they're like when a\npatient walks in and says can you help\nme get a girlfriend what are you\nsupposed to say and I was like I don't\nknow maybe and he's like the right thing\nto say is what makes you want a\ngirlfriend what's it like to not have a\ngirlfriend those are all useful\nquestions but something that's happened\nin therapy is we've stopped accepting\nresponsibility for the outcomes of our\npatients we'll accept outcomes in terms\nof mental health measures so we'll say\nlike okay phq9 score Gad s score we're\ngoing to reduce your anxiety we're going\nto reduce your depression that's going\nto be great but as a profession we've\nbasically said like we're not going to\nhelp you get a girlfriend get a\nboyfriend we're not going to help you\nget promoted we're not going to help you\nbe a millionaire we can't do that which\nI also disagree with like I think if\nthere's anyone on the planet that can\nhelp you do that it's actually going to\nbe a therapist because we we've got an\nawesome skill set and what we see is\nlike therapists who work with their\nclients do get those kinds of outcomes\nbut we become afraid to try to help\npeople with instrumental\nsupport so try to find a therapist and\nI'd say you need to see\nthree okay because it's about\nfit and then recognize like hey I need\nhelp like accomplishing some of my goals\nand this is what I would say to a\ntherapist I want to like accomplish\ncertain things in life and I want to\nbetter understand what are the things\ninside me that prevent me from doing\nwhat I want can you please help me with\nthis right and throw in a\nplease it's part of what helps in terms\nof asking for help so step number one\ndon't kill yourself step number two get\nEmergency Services if you need them step\nnumber three find a therapist because\nthis is still the best evidence-based\napproach when we look at the swaths of\nhumanity we still know that there is one\nintervention that works pretty well\nwhich is psychiatric help so we're going\nto do\nthat and there's a lot more that we're\ngoing to\ndo next thing that you need to do is\nwork on\nAlexia alexiy is the inability to tell\nwhat your internal emotional state is\nand here's why so if we look at a lot of\nthe behaviors that create the\ncircumstances that make you not want to\nlive your life a lot of those are due to\nemotions so you may not think that they\nare due to emotions but this is what\nhappens we have negative emotions\nnegative emotions are supposed to prompt\nus towards action so emotions are a\nsource of information and they're a\nsource of motivation they give us energy\nand they give us info okay there's a\nwhole segment on this on the trauma\nguide where we kind of explain this so\nif youall are interested in what I'm if\nyou like what I say definitely check\nthat\nout so the problem though is that as men\nwe're taught to suppress our emotions\nand on top of that we engage in\nbehaviors that further suppress our\nemotions so if you think about the most\npowerful motivators for Behavior they're\nactually emotions right any movie you\nlook at some guy gets bulli and it's\nlike never again like I'm going to get\nSW I'm going to get big this like this\nshame is going to like I'm going to be\nthe best and I'm going to be\nthe right this is what happens in all of\nour movies right Mean Girls we see that\ntoo we're like Lindsay Lohan is like I'm\ngoing\nto I feel lots of emotion I'm going to\nbecome the winner because of\nit so negative emotion is a powerful\nsource of information a powerful source\nof motivation but the problem is that it\nhurts and so as we look at our lives and\nwe think there's no way that I can\nactually fix this I try to suppress\nit the problem is when I suppress it it\ndoesn't go away I just suppress it and\nwe also know that suppressing your\nemotions is a large source of willpower\ndrain so if you are suppressing your\nemotions and you don't feel them you may\nnot even be doing it consciously you're\nactually like cutting your willpower bar\nin half right I don't know if y'all play\nElden ring but like in Elden ring\nthere's this one particular attack that\nreduces your max health bar so even if\nyou heal you can only go up so much and\nthis is what suppressing our emotions\ndoes for\nus and so then what happens is not only\ndo we are we losing access to this\npowerful motivational fuel but it is\ncosting us a lot a lot to suppress this\nstuff so we really need to do is get in\ntouch with our emotions and process\nthose let's process them what\ndoes it mean to process them that means\nto make it go away\nforever\nright so think about that this is what\nwe try to do we like I don't like my\nemotions yeah I know you don't like them\nthat's cuz they suck and we want to make\nthem go away from forever but the way\nthat we're going to do that is by\nprocessing and healing not drinking\ndrinking doesn't make them go away\nforever it just makes them go away for a\nlittle while and then they come back\nworse so you look at literally studies\non alcohol what we know is that they\nmake you feel better from mood\nperspective temporarily and they make\nyou feel worse over time and then we get\nstuck in these addictive patterns where\nI'm going to do this thing today because\nit makes me feel good today and then I'm\nscrewing over tomorrow me and then\nscrewing over the next me and the next\nand then you get stuck in this cycle how\ndo you break the cycle by confronting\nyour emotions you got to let that\nout baby let's go and this is where we\nneed companionship we need support right\nso there's one of the papers that I show\ntoday talks about male\nsupport and how it's like really good\nlike Bros need Bros we don't have a\nspace for each other anymore and women\nare struggling from this too I don't\nknow where women hang out\nanymore and so step number one is get\nhelp step number two is manage your\nemotions and then the cool thing is Step\nnumber three is Like Instrumental\nsupport see once you do number one and\nnumber two then you are actually in a\nplace to fix your life because the\nproblem is that we try to jump straight\nto step number three but when we're\njumping straight to step number three\nwe're like\nhandicapped we have so many debuffs that\nattempts that we make to fix our lives\nlike we're shoot like we're we're\ndriving with a leaky gas\ntank and then we make a critical mistake\nwhich is that I tried 100% and it didn't\nwork which is not you're not wrong there\nand by the way this is when we get back\nto these kinds of comments\nright um right so like this is where why\nwhat what does it mean when someone is\nlike objectively hopeless like what do\nwe mean by that what I'm talking about\nhere is that these people try and try\nand try and try and try and they don't\nget anywhere so then they and I think\nit's reasonable right so if we were like\nan alien species and we saw someone\nperform an experiment where they tried\nto improve their life 6,000 times and it\ndidn't work what do you think is the\nobjective conclusion improving my life\nis impossible right that's like a\nreasonable scientific conclusion now\ntheir study is flawed I don't think\nthat's actually correct in some way but\nI think it's a reasonable\nobjective\ninterpretation it can be changed but\nthat doesn't mean that they're\nmalfunctioning that just means that the\nway that they've been playing the game\nof life is going to result in those\nkinds of of\nresults and so then comes the\ninstrumental support and what I've\nactually found is that like as a\ntherapist doing a lot of instrumental\nsupport especially for my male patients\nis very helpful it's part of the reason\nwe created a coaching\nprogram right so I recently heard anyway\nI'm not going to go into too much detail\nbut we recently approached by someone\nlike a group of people at anyway who I'm\nnot gonna I can't talk about it so never\nmind so the point is like we created\nlike this coaching program to because I\nnoticed that there was a deficiency of\ninstrumental support right and at the\ntime I\nwas I was at mlan hospital which is a\ngreat Hospital like arguably best\nPsychiatric Hospital in the country in\nthe United States probably one of the\ntop five in the world and so like the\nchief of Psychiatry there the CEO is\nlike hey you should really check out\nthis this cool thing we have here called\nThe Institute of coaching and I was like\nthis is\ncool right so they started an Institute\nthat's all about coaching which was\nstarted by uh a therapist who\nspecializes in positive psychology works\nwith a lot of\nCorporations and so there's instrumental\nsupport and the whole thing is that if\nyou want to put together your life this\nis what it takes it takes these three\nthings the first thing is to not\ndie\nbluntly right in the great words of\nRandy Marsh I didn't hear no\nBell the only time you lose at life is\nwhen you ring the\nbell this I believe\n100% I didn't hear no\nBell as long as you keep as long as you\nstick around there's a chance and the\nbiggest thing that people Miss is\nhelp so start by Staying Alive secondly\ngetting professional help third focus on\nyour emotions and fourth get\ninstrumental help actually start fixing\nyour\nlife take a problem that you have\nsomething that you want to change and\nthis is where literally all of the\ncontent that I've made for the last four\nyears five years if you'll ask how do I\ndo that that that's what I've been\nsaying for 5 years this is how recognize\nthat anything you try to do in life\nthere is going to be this internal thing\nthat holds you\nback the way that you perceive the world\nis going to change is\naltered right I'll show you all just a\nsimple example of this so one of the\nthings that we taught recently in our in\none of our members\nlectures right so lives not worth living\nis intended to Pander to a\nmedia audience now if we look at this\nthis person is\nassuming that I'm doing this to Pander\nto a social media audience this doesn't\ncome from me this comes from their mind\nright and it's I'm not saying it's an\nunreasonable conclusion I'm not\ncriticizing the conclusion I'm just\npointing out that this is a direct quote\nand this is what their mind adds to the\nequation so one of the craziest things\nthat you all need to understand is if\nyou're trying to fix your life you need\nto pay extra extra extra attention to\nwhat your life I mean your mind adds to\nthe\nequation and I see this all the time\nthese are the cognitive distortions\nwe're talking about if you ask someone\nout and they say I'm not looking to date\nright now you say I got rejected which\nis sort of true but is it your fault or\nis it possible they just weren't looking\nto date and this is what I see time and\ntime again is that the world that we\nlive in is shaped by our perception\nshaped by our\ninterpretation and then we also try to\nfix things not recognizing that number\none and secondly not recognizing what's\nin\nhere right and this is where like youall\nknow what I'm talking about like we had\nan awesome interview when we were\nstarting out with this guy I think named\ncruv I hope he's doing okay he's a voice\nactor and so we talked a little bit\nabout how he like this rubber band\nmechanic which is that anytime it's it's\nkind of like he's tied to a tree with a\nrubber band and the further he gets away\nfrom the tree the more progress he makes\nthe more elasticity there is in the\nrubber band and then he snaps\nback so if you have some kind of pattern\nin your life where like you snatch\ndefeat from the jaws of Victory or\nsomething keeps on screwing you up and\nno matter how hard you try something is\nmessing things up you need to look\nwithin yourself because there may be\nthings down there that you're not aware\nof you may be self-sabotaging in some\nway and that's why we talk about\nemotional\nawareness emotional processing healing\ntherapists are good at that kind of\nthing and this is what it takes It's a\ncombination of first of all staying\nalive secondly getting some help thirdly\nworking on your emotions especially as\nmen right so if I made a a a lecture\nabout women's suicide it would be\ndifferent and why don't I make this\nlecture about General suicide I mean\nsome of this stuff is generally\napplicable it's because shockingly I do\nnot think that our research papers on\nGeneral suicide May apply 100% to women\nI think that women deserve their own\nsuicide\nlecture the reason that I'm doing one on\nautism and one on ADHD instead of\nsuicide is because I think that's a\nbigger problem that women struggle with\nat least based on the data that I've\nseen and you do these three things and\nlike you will be amazed at how good your\nlife can get and I say this as someone\nwho's helped in 97 out of 100\npeople like and they come in and they've\nbeen in bad shape bro ladies all the\nabove men women\nwhatever and most of them can get better\nyou just need the right kind of\nhelp\nquestions so here's here's a here's a\ngood great great great great great great\nI have big goals but no Talent this is\nexact what I'm talking\nabout so notice so someone in chat typed\nI have big goals but no Talent what the\n does that even\nmean right\nlike just notice how reflexive that\nthought\nis like it is so no three people aren't\ndead\nthree people I just don't think I helped\nin a significant clinical way and I I\nmean I heard one of them is doing well\nthe other two I'm not\nsure but you\nknow\nso I I I think this is where like you've\ngot to be super careful because like if\nyall look at me and and just just like\nlook at the people like what does that\nmean what does it mean to be\ntalented like I I don't know what that\nmeans how do you measure talent I don't\nknow so I know we have this concept of\ntalent and the biggest problem with I\nhave big goals but no Talent so I'll\ngive you all one very concrete\ntip be very careful about conclusions\nabout your life that your mind gives you\nthat are not\nactionable super\ncareful see when the mind doesn't want\nto do\nsomething what it does is gives you an\nexplanation that allows you to give\nup so it says you need talent to succeed\nin this world and you have no Talent the\nconstruction of the world that you put\ntogether logically concludes to not act\nanytime your mind does that you need to\nbe super careful because chances are\nthere's something else controlling\nthings behind the scene\nI'm not saying that it's wrong because\nit's never wrong it's just selective\nusually so this is where like I hear\nthis all the time and it's something\nthat I literally look for I mean so\nthose of you all that you know will\nwatch my interviews and stuff like\nyou're like how how does this guy do\nthis it's because I look for these kinds\nof things I look for statements that are\nlike you know conclusions about the\nworld that make it impossible to act\nlike there's no point in\ntrying right if you view the world that\nway and if you look at the difference\nbetween people who accomplish things and\npeople who don't accomplish things I'm\nnot saying success what do I mean by\naccomplish accomplish is to set your\nmind to a goal and actually achieve it\nthe biggest difference is some people\nview the world in ways that allow them\nto act and some people view the world in\nways that do not allow them to\nact\nliterally spend some time reading stuff\non the internet the people asking for\nhelp and go line by line and analyze is\nthis actionable is this actionable is\nthis actionable is this actionable and\nwhat you will find is the\noverwhelming number of people who are\nstuck have nothing that is actionable\nthat's how they see their life but does\nthat mean that their life is not\nactionable no that just means that\nthat's the way that they conceptualize\nit\nokay yeah so the the man who says I can\nand the the man who says I can't are\nusual both the man who says I both the\nthe person who says I can and the person\nwho says I can't are both right you're\nright I completely\nagree right it's the question is which\none does your mind tell you because\noften times as an individual you don't\nthink both at the same time you think\none or the\nother how to change it great question so\nyou guys can watch the thousand plus I\nmean Jesus I don't even know\nlike right so if you watch our stuff we\nteach you all of these individual cases\nof how to understand your perception how\nto understand your mind this particular\ncomplex in the mind that particular\ncomplex in the mind here's how ADHD\nWorks here's some interesting thing\nabout ADHD here's this thing about ADHD\nand obesity we've got all this stuff for\ny'all so you guys just have to start\ngoing through it like I I don't know how\nto tell you I can't condense everything\nthat I've taught into like three minutes\nbut but\nI'll try Okay so the first thing to\nunderstand is awareness is key so here's\nthe thing see a lot and maybe we'll\nwe'll wrap after\nthis the reason that life is hard to\nlive is because we're blind like just\nthink about this when you can see and\nyou understand what the problems are\nthen life becomes\neasy it is when we misunderstand what\nthe problems are that life become hard\nso in Sanskrit they say that aidia or\nignorance is the root of our suffering\nand then you may say but I understand\nwhat my problems are they're just\nimpossible to solve and that's where I\nwould say I don't think you understand\nthem correctly right because if you look\nat someone who's there are all kinds of\npeople who will let's say I'm playing\nLeague of Legends and I say my God this\ngame is impossible to win but some\nDiamond Player some Pro Player will show\nup and will be like this game isn't\nimpossible to win you just don't\nunderstand\nit right so when we go through life like\nthere are so many things about our life\nthat we just don't\nunderstand we're not aware of our\ninternal programming we're not aware of\nwhat why we wake up on one day and why\nwe sleep late the other day why we\nprocrastinate today and why we work\ntomorrow just think for a\nsecond why do you procrastinate today\nand why do you work tomorrow or work\ntoday and procrastinate tomorrow do you\neven understand something so simple is\nwhy you procrastinate well holy if\nyou don't understand such a fundamental\nthing about you imagine how hard your\nlife is imagine how easy your life would\nbe if you could understand why you\nprocrastinate because once you\nunderstand what the drivers to\nprocrastination are then you can\nactually do something to disable\nit so the biggest problem right now is\nthat we don't understand\nourselves so it's like we're playing the\ngame of life where but we're blind and\nthe buttons keep changing\nso we're trying to figure out how do I\nget this character to move and it's like\nyou hit this button and today it moves\nbut then it's like one of these I don't\nknow these games where like you know you\nget like drunk or whatever and then all\nthe controller inputs change like that's\nwhat life is like we're playing one of\nthese games where all the controller\ninputs keep\nchanging and you have to figure out\nwhich buttons do what and you can't get\nyourself to do\nsomething imagine that you could get\nyourself to do whatever you\nwanted what would your life look like\nright and now we come full circle\nbecause I've spent a lot of time talking\nabout objective things and all this kind\nof stuff but at the end of the day I\nthink the biggest gain that you can get\nis just to understand how to control\nyourself what could you accomplish if\nyou could just control\nyourself and so that's what you should\nwork on how do you understand how to\ncontrol yourself you start by being\naware of yourself right you can't figure\nout what what buttons do what until you\nlook at the controller and you see which\nbuttons are even\nthere awareness awareness awareness and\nthe problem in our society today is that\nwe are so unaware literally we spend so\nmuch time listening to stuff and then\nI'm walking and I'm listening to a\npodcast in the shower and then I'm you\nknow listening to a podcast when I'm\ndriving and then when I get home when\nI'm sitting when I'm waiting for my\nfriends to show up I'm playing a game on\nmy cell phone we don't spend any time\nwith ourselves we externalize our\nattention\nconstantly and so we lose sight of\nourselves and then life becomes\nhard so spend a little bit more time\nwith\nyourself gain as much awareness of\nyourself as you\ncan and don't if you give up hope I mean\nI think it's okay like ideally don't do\nit but just because you don't have hope\ndoesn't mean that things can't get\nbetter this just means that you're\nunable to feel hope in this\nmoment and in my overwhelming experience\nas a mental health professional people's\nlives get better\noverwhelming experience and this is for\npeople who have even been 60 and said in\nmy life I've been depressed my whole\nlife I've seen them get better the main\nthing that you may need is a little bit\nof\nhelp and that's just what life is like\nit's an\nMMO happy Persian New Year everybody\ncool\noh what Guru Dr\nK oh my\nGod see the problem so gurus are great\nbig\nfan the problem is that we don't know\nwhich ones are\ngood so a real Guru I think is\nworth a ton if you can find one but\nthey're hard to find and the problem is\nthat we don't have the ability to\njudge\nso Andy Buck is saying this is like free\ntherapy so this is this is the other\nthing that I'll say I mean this isn't\ntherapy if you guys like this you should\njust go see an actual therapist you'll\nbe you'll love it so this is where if we\nlook at the mental health interventions\nright so what are we trying to do here\nat healthy\ngamer I kind of gave you this analogy\nthat being a psychiatrist a therapist is\nlike being a member of the King's Guard\nor Queen's guard like we're the last\nline of defense right so if we kind of\nlook\nat\nsuicidality all this stuff happens in\nsomeone's life and this is the last line\nof defense over here this is where the\ntherapist sets steps\nin so we're the last line of defense but\nall this needs to be\nchanged\nand the other problem that I have with\nassuming that therapy is all of the\nanswers all the time is that I don't\nthink it fixes all of those things is a\nsociety I think we need to understand\nthat the reason that an unprecedented\namount of men are killing themselves and\nby the way when we say unprecedented\nit's not that much worse than it used to\nbe because the other really crazy thing\nis male suicide rates have been super\nhigh for like the last almost 100 years\n50 years at least this has been going on\nfor a while it's getting worse and it's\na problem don't get me wrong but it's\nalso been going on for a while\nI think the problem is that if we say\nthat therapy is always the answer and I\nthink therapy is the first step for the\nmajority of people hands\ndown but I think we've got to be super\ncareful because the moment that we say\nthat this is a mental illness we also\nabsolve Society of\nresponsibility like I I think if you\nlack self-esteem and you're suicidal you\nshould absolutely get mental health help\nbut I think we should also help you\nbuild a life that is worth living that\nyou can be proud of but that requires\nEconomic\nOpportunity that requires some ability\nto connect or requires some ability to\nconnect with other human\nbeings and this is where we get into the\nproblem of like no individual person is\nresponsible for solving another human\nbeing's loneliness but then who\nis because you can't bootstrap you can't\nhug yourself and it doesn't feel right\nlike it doesn't do what it's supposed to\ndo and we've gotten so far to the point\nof like we're creating\ndolls and\npillows as a substitute for human\ncontact and it's like you can you can\ndecry the people who are making it but\nlike how the did we get here the\nonly reason that there's a market for\nthat is because human contact is\nnot findable for some people like think\nabout that for a\nsecond and the only way this is going to\nwork is if we start taking\nresponsibility for each\nother right not my problem like yes\nyou're correct but whose is\nit the only way this works is if you\nmake it your\nproblem and we can keep on becoming more\nand more independent and creating more\nand more FAS similes of human contact\nand we're going to get better and better\nat it but like this problem is fixed if\nwe all accept more responsibility for\nlike taking care of each other\nlike I don't know if you all see that\nright like why is all this stuff\nhappening because humans are giving up\nresponsibility for each other you're\nsaying I\ngot what is\nit IV\nFu so there's a very popular tech\ncompany where they have a phrase I'm\nvested you so after a certain\nnumber of years they get their stock\noptions and then they basically can all\nretire and so there's this phrase that\nwould get tossed around I'm vested\nyou right and this is the society we\nlive in today it's like once I get mine\neverybody else can go\nthemselves and this is the attitude\nbecause we live in this doggy dog world\nwe in this live in this independent\nworld we live in this world where like\nno one helped me so I'm not going to\nhelp\nanybody and like I can't blame an\nindividual for that I really can't I\ndon't but my my question\nis what\nhappens what happens like let's play\nthis tape through to the end and that's\nwhat we're here for right like it's\nabout AOE healing what's awesome about\nthis community is like I can't do it\nalone and last thing to consider for\nthose of youall that are struggling with\nsuicidality is a lot of people think\nthat when you're suicidal you have no\nvalue because you look at some of these\nobjective metrics so there's one really\nbig value I mean there's a lot of value\nin your life I think I really believe\nthat but there's one thing that I I want\nto make an argument for which is that we\nneed you\nso if you look at the\ndata what you find is that peer support\nis very\nhelpful and honestly like this is such a\nweird thing I was thinking about this\nand I was like why don't we have peer\nsupport for suicidality we have peer\nsupport for alcoholism we have peer\nsupport for all these things what about\npeer support for Su that's when it hit\nme oh yeah they all killed\nthemselves so now we have a unique\nproblem when it comes to\nsuicidality\nwhich is that we don't have\nsurvivors to show the rest of us how to\nsurvive so we need a crop of people I'm\nserious when I say need I say that with\na capital N who can get through what\nyou've gone through and then hopefully\nyou can put together your life and then\nthere's there's literally a 287 per\nincrease in people under the age of 18\n287 increase of people need\nyou and this is this is what we're\nnoticing right so this is what we learn\nfrom things like let's just take a quick\naside into alcohol research right I'm\nnot doing a full thing I'm making some\nconclusions and there's arguments and\nstuff you look at\nalcohol\nalcoholism we have great evidence-based\ntreatments and the majority of people\nget sober on their own or with AA they\ndon't come to medical\nprofessionals so we have good treatments\nbut the majority of people do it without\nus and so peer support is\ncrucial so like like literally I mean I\nI I say like we need people who know\nwhat it's like to be suicidal and put\ntogether your life and then show us the\nway because therapists can do a lot but\nwe cannot substitute for personal\nexperience this is what we've learned\nfrom peer support so when we look at\nevidence-based models of addiction\ntreatment\nfind is go see your\npsychiatrist and then go to AA or Refuge\nrecovery or whatever smart recovery\nwhatever your choice of PE support this\nright these two things are not\nreplaceable right so do the best that\nyou y y'all can I'm here to help you as\nmuch as I can right I don't I mean the\nwhole reason I did this is because I\nfelt like it wasn't enough to see people\nin my\noffice so unfortunately I can't see all\nin my office and also fortun like I'm\nhere because of that\nright and like go and go and and give it\na shot like go get help and give\nyourself a pat on the back and be\npatient with\nyourself and recognize that just because\nobjectively that your life has sucked up\nuntil this moment I'm not saying you're\nwrong but I'm also saying you can't\npredict the\nfuture\nsorry so don't give up I know it's hard\nlike to a certain extent as much as I\ncan having lived the life that I've\nlived and like give it a shot like you\njust don't know I mean like these human\nbeings are we're so\narrogant we think we know the\nfuture we don't know what's going to\nhappen tomorrow the world may end\ntomorrow or maybe someone will will\nrelease oh like psych it's not Elden\nring DLC it's Elden ring to and then\nsuddenly the suicidality disappears\nright there's like we don't know what\nlife has to offer and life is hard hard\nfor a lot of people right now but like\nholy crap like we could be on the maybe\nyou can go to Mars in your lifetime like\nthat's pretty\ncool just give it a shot don't give\nup and we need your help because we\ncan't do without\nyou I can't do it without you right we\nneed\nyou so thank you all very much for\ncoming\ntoday and uh yeah I I'll say just to\nclarify because I think some people on\nTwitter didn't\nunderstand I I am not for\nsuicide I am for living and trying to\nput your life together and I sincerely\nbelieve that you can have a life that is\nworth living and if you haven't been\nable to make one that's okay and also\nlike try to find someone to help you\nright that doesn't doesn't mean like\neven if you feel some shame have your\ntherapist work through that with\nyou all right take care guys"
