    "transcript": "almost everyone is who's really Ultra\nsuccessful has said this that you need\nto give something up to focus on the one\nthing if you want to succeed at it maybe\nthat means you can't have the social\nlife that you want to me S lot of the\ntime is a pretty big sacrifice you could\nsacrifice sleep I mean there's a lot of\nthings that you could give up in favor\nof pursuing an outcome that is greater\nthan the average what's the point of\npursuing an outcome desire of that\noutcome okay so I mean I think if your\ngoal is desire of an outcome then by all\nmeans make sacrifice what I have found\nin my life is that the fewer sacrifices\nthat I make the more successful I become\nrelentlessly pursuing a desire can\nabsolutely come with a lot of sacrifice\nbut I don't think that's the only way to\nreach success you know I I don't make\nmany sacrifices now in a sense I make a\nlot but they don't feel like sacrifices\nI just make choices that's all it is you\ncan't make a sacrifice unless you're\nattached to something does that make\nsense mhm when you can enjoy writing a\nbook just as much as you enjoy playing a\nvideo game are you making a Sacrifice by\nnot playing the video game no"
