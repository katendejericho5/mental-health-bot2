    "transcript": "so the number one thing that correlates\nwith male suicide is not depression and\nthis is super scary there's one study I\nsaw recently that suggests that 50% of\nmen who kill themselves have no history\nor evidence of mental illness I believe\nthis statistic in in my clinical\npractice because I know what depression\nlooks like I know what bipolar disorder\nlooks like and half the men that I've\nworked with at least are not actually\nmentally ill see mental illness means a\npathology of the mind which means that\nthe mind is malfunctioning most of the\nsuicidal men that I work with their mind\nisn't malfunctioning they genuinely have\na life that is no longer worth living\nthey're looking at things and\nobjectively realizing that there's no\nway out of this situation so they turn\nto Suicide so I know it's kind of like a\nvery controversial statement but I think\nthat's what my clinical practice has\nshown and there's some research to even\nback that up so if we sort of look at\nwhat's going on with men we're sort of\nthey have nowhere to turn to and the\nnumber one thing that correlates with it\nis not Mental Illness but is a sense of\nthwarted belongingness but basically\nwhat happens is what causes people to\nkill themselves is they try to connect\nwith others and they get rejected"
