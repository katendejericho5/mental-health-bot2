    "transcript": "if we look at what technology is doing\nto our brains the first thing that it's\ndoing is it is externalizing our\nattention so if you look back like let's\nsay a thousand years ago as human beings\nwe spent a lot more time with ourselves\nso let's say that you and I go out\nhunting let's say you shoot an arrow at\na deer and you miss and then I shoot an\narrow at a deer and I hit so in this\nmoment I'm superior to you and then we\npick up the deer and we're carrying it\nback and then we have about 2 or 3 hours\nto take that emotional insult and we\nkind of process it we just give our mind\nspace to process it which it does\nautomatically now if you look at what\nhappens in people's days they don't\nactually have any time to process what\nhappens to them because we are so\nconstantly distracted by external things\nwe lose sight of our internal signals\nliterally in the same way that if you\nraise a child in a dark cave the photo\nreceptors in their eyes won't develop\nthey will atrophy anything that the Mind\ndoes not get access to will start to\natrophy if I don't practice Spanish I'm\ngoing to forget Spanish the mind is very\nbrain is very efficient organ"
