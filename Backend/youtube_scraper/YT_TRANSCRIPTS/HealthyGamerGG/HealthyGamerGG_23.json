    "transcript": "so let's say that your partner forgets\nyour birthday oh my God this person\ndoesn't care about me I do so much for\nthem they always forget my birthday this\nis the last time if you take a step back\nand you look at things from their\nperspective oh my partner is working so\nhard they're so stressed about this as\nyou put yourself in their shoes the\namount of hurt you receive actually goes\ndown today we're going to talk about how\nand why you can be more selfless in an\nincreasingly selfish world so if you\nlook around everyone is self-absorbed we\nsee a ton of stuff on social media\nthat's all about me me me we have a lot\nof people who are incredibly burnt out\nwith their jobs with their social\nsituation dating is an absolute mess\nthere's a loneliness epidemic and so it\nseems like no one has time for anyone\nelse which is really weird right because\nwe have so much technology we've done so\nmany things to make life easy and yet\neveryone is becoming more selfish and\nthis is not just your perception there's\nresearch to back this up what we're\nseeing is that there's something called\nthe narcissistic personality inventory\nwhich measures how narcissistic people\nare and what we're seeing is that scores\nare rising over time and it turns out\nthat along with people being more\nnarcissistic we're also seeing a mental\nhealth crisis rates of suicidal Behavior\ncompleted suicides rates of suicidal\nthinking depression anxiety loneliness\nstress burnout and imposter syndrome all\nall of these things are increasing too\nand so it may sound kind of weird but\nlike clearly there's some kind of\nconnection there and it turns out that\nthe capacity to care for others which is\nvery lacking in narcissists actually\nleads to very positive impacts on our\nmental health working as a psychiatrist\nI work with a lot of people who are\nsuccessful unsuccessful CEOs people who\nare degenerate Gamers living in people's\nbasements and the one thing that I\nalways see is people come in wanting\nhelp for themselves they're always\nthinking about this is my problem and I\nneed help and this is going on and I\ndon't know how to do this it's kind of\nall about me which makes sense because\nyou're going to go see a psychiatrist\nand the psychiatrist's job is to help\nyou right they're not there to help you\nhelp other people but one of the things\nthat I've learned through psychiatric\npractice and sort of evidence-based\ntechniques is that when I help my\npatients develop more empathy when I\nhelp them be more kind and compassionate\nto the people around them they are the\nones that benefit and there's a ton of\nresearch that actually supports that\nthat the more empathic you are the more\ncompassionate you are the more your\nphysical health improves the more your\nmental health improves and even\nobjective things in the world like your\nrelationships and your job performance\nalso go up now even if I say all of that\nstuff there's a huge problem because we\nsort of also know that empathy leads to\nall kinds of problems so if you're\nsomeone who's like a highly sensitive\nperson you may have heard of hsps who\nare very very empathic and the more\nempathic you are the more you get\ncontaminated by other people's stuff\nright so this is something where like\nthere's actually this term called\nemotional contagion which is a\nconsequence of high empathy and this\nmeans you make other people's problems\nyours and it adversely affects you we\nalso see this in situations like social\nmedia where there's even evidence of\nvicarious trauma through social media so\nif you watch a lot of bad stuff on the\ninternet you're own mental will actually\nget messed up and we also know that if\nyou're empathic other people are likely\nto take advantage of you right the basic\nissue right now is that everyone out\nthere is saying advocate for yourself\nlike there're all these like you know\nlike success Bros who like life is zero\ngame if you if you win someone else has\nto lose you got to get your own ain't no\none going to take care of you man like\nyou got to do it all yourself right they\nhave this sort of attitude that like\nbeing kind to other people is not going\nto lead to success in life and if you're\non the receiving end of that and you are\ncompassionate to towards someone else\nchances are you'll just get taken\nadvantage of so here they are being\nself-absorbed and here you are being\ncompassionate and kind and trying to be\nnice to them so they benefit from your\ncompassion but you don't seem to benefit\nfrom theirs because they're not\nreciprocating and this is also something\nthat I see so much of I'm always the\nfriend that texts first I take care of\nmy friend but my friend doesn't take\ncare of me I'm really really emotionally\nsupportive to towards my boyfriend but\nmy boyfriend is not supportive towards\nme or I'm really supportive towards my\ngirlfriend but she's not supportive\ntowards me so we're seeing a lot of\nlopsided support and care which\nnaturally leads people to conclude I\ncan't care about other people I can't\nafford to care about other people\nbecause if I focus on other people my\nlife continues to stall and so today\nwe're going to advocate for you actually\nbeing more empathic compassionate and I\nrecognize the problem we're going to\nwalk you through that and the main\nreason is not to benefit other people\nthe reason for you to be empathic and\ncompassionate is for your own benefit\nand it turns out that there are a ton of\nbenefits to being compassionate hey\ny'all if you're interested in applying\nsome of the principles that we share to\nactually create change in your life\ncheck out Dr K's guide to mental health\nit combines over two decades of my\nexperience of both being a monk and a\npsychiatrist and distills all of the\nmost important things I've learned into\na Choose Your Own Adventure format so\ncheck out the link in the bio and start\nyour journey today so let's kind of take\na step back and think about this from an\nevolutionary perspective why is this so\nhuman beings are community-based\norganisms right we're not actually\nloners we it takes a village to raise a\nchild we're sort of like tribal right\nand so if you kind of think about it\nfrom a evolutionary perspective\nEvolution wants to give us a positive\nreward for helping members of our tribe\nwe see this in things like you know any\nmovie that you watch has some Noble hero\nor heroin who makes a sacrifice for the\ngreater good right and we all like\napplaud this kind of thing we thank\npeople for the military service that\nthey they do if someone's an organ donor\nlike that's really great like you\nsacrific for the benefit and we're going\nto we're going to say good job bro you\nget to board first on the flight well\nactually they don't do that for organ\ndoors which is absolutely insane but\nwhatever right so you get more overhead\nspace like that's the advantage but if\nyou kind of think about it from a very\npractical perspective right so we want\nEvolution or Evolution wants to reward\nUs rewards this or organism for helping\nother organisms so for example even when\nwe're looking at non-clinical\npopulations okay there are many studies\ndemonstrating associations between\nempathy related traits and behaviors and\ngood mental and physical health for\nexample highly empathic or compassionate\npeople report better mental health lower\nstress anxiety hopelessness and\ndepression and participate in fewer\nhealth risk behaviors like drinking and\nsmoking so with this with there's a ton\nof research that actually shows that\nbeing empathic towards other people\nimproves your own health what if I told\nyou there's one thing that you can do\nthat will lower your depression your\nanxiety your sense of hopelessness help\nyou form connections and cut back on\nunhealthy coping mechanisms like going\nto your goon cave every single day what\nif I told you there's one thing that\nwould do that and you'd be like yeah\nsign me up like what supplement is it is\nit a course what is it meditation it's\nnot meditation it's not journaling it's\nnot therapy it's actually being nice to\nother human beings and the mechanism\nthis of this is fascinating so if you\ngive someone this is a really cool study\nif you boost someone's serotonin\ntransmission they become more empathic\nand the reverse is also true that when\nwe become more empathic our serotonergic\ncircuitry actually gets buffed which is\nwhy we see that people who are empathic\nhave lower levels of depression and\nanxiety and what is the treatment that\nwe use for depression and anxiety it's\ngiving people serotonin selective\nserotonin reuptake Inhibitors we\nbasically boost their serotonin\ntransmission we also know that being\nempathic and kind towards other people\nlowers cortisol so cortisol is a stress\nhormone that does things like causes us\nto drink smoke play video games to\nmanage that negative emotion interferes\nwith sleep interferes with falling of\nsleep interferes with the quality of\nsleep messes with our appetite increases\nour heart rate literally increases the\nrate at which our cells age stress\ncauses us to age more rapidly and so it\nturns out that empathy from a neurobi\nbiological perspective enhances\nserotonin transmission enhances things\nlike oxytocin production and reduces\nthings like cortisol so it seems like in\na lot of ways it's the Silver Bullet the\nproblem of course is that if we try to\nbe empathic often times we get burned so\nwe're going to dive a little bit into\nthat so what we see when we look at the\nresearch is that scores on empathic\nconcern and perspective taking uh on the\ninterpersonal reactivity index have been\ndeclining over the past 30 years in the\nUnited States and that's even before the\nexplosion of social media and scores on\nnarcissistic personality inventory um\nwith low empathy have been increasing\nacross the same time period right so\nthis is crazy people are becoming less\nempathic over time more narcissistic\nover time and it is resulting in a\nmental health epidemic across the globe\neven though we have scientific evidence\nof how helpful empathy can be for you\nforget about other people there's still\nthis huge problem of how do I be\nempathic properly because there are a\ngroup of people who unless you learn how\nto utilize your empathy and compensate\nfor your high level of empathy it will\ntear you apart not only will you get\nemotional contagion from the negativity\nof others but people will do things like\ntake advantage of you and I'm also\npreparing a lecture on why you should be\nless empathic in the dangers of empathy\nthat's for a different day though so in\norder to really understand how to be\nempathic in a positive way and sort of\nreally understand like how can this\nreally help me what we're actually going\nto look at is romantic relationships now\na lot of people may say well duh Dr K\nlike oh like if I'm empathic doesn't\nimprove my romantic relationsships like\nthat's obvious but let's understand the\nmechanism because it's not just about\nromantic relationships So within\nromantic relationship some researchers\nfound that people scoring high in\nperspective taking or cognitive empathy\nreport being more satisfied with their\nrelationships now I want yall to notice\nthis this is very important to\nunderstand this is not saying that\nsomeone who has high empathy has better\nrelationships this is when you have\nhigher empathy your satisfaction with\nthe relationship actually improves\nanother interesting study found that\nmarried people with higher dispositional\nempathy are less likely to ruminate over\nperceived transgressions and more likely\nto forgive their partners for their\ntransgressions with Downstream\nconsequences on higher marital quality\nwhat this paper is really looking at or\nwhat these studies are looking at is not\nthat empathy benefits your partner it\ndoes but that's not what we're talking\nabout we're focused on you right because\nwe're selfish remember so we're talking\nabout the benefit for you so let's just\nunderstand this okay cuz I think once I\nexplain it hopefully it'll make sense so\nlet's say that your partner forgets your\nbirthday and when they forget your\nbirthday what tends to happen is unless\nwe're careful we'll start ruminating on\noh my God this person doesn't care about\nme I do so much for them they don't do a\nwhole lot for me and then we kind of get\nstuck in our own head we're just\nthinking about things from our\nperspective and as we think about things\nfrom our perspective we get more and\nmore frustrated with our partner they\ndon't care this is lopsided they always\nforget my birthday this is the last time\nI swear this is never going to happen\nagain I don't know why I'm in this\nrelationship we think all of these\nnegative thoughts and I don't know if\nyall have had friends or Partners or\nkids or parents or whoever who's very\nruminative what you'll notice is that\nthey get stuck in their own head and\nthere may be times in your life where\nyou've gotten stuck in your own head and\nyou're think constantly thinking\nnegative thoughts to yourself and you\ncan't seem to snap out of it now let's\nunderstand what which capacity of human\nbeings allows them to snap out of it and\nthis turns out is empathy so this is\nwhere empathy gets divided into two\nkinds so there's something called\ncognitive empathy which is the ability\nto understand what someone thinks and\nbelieves can I understand what's going\non in their head and there's also\nsomething called affective empathy which\nis the ability to feel what someone else\nfeels so when someone else is hurting\nI'm hurting too it turns out that\nemotional contagion is basically\naffective empathy running unchecked but\na lot of good can come out of cognitive\nempathy so in the case of your partner\nwho's forgotten your birthday present or\nfriend or whoever if you take a step\nback and you look at things from their\nperspective oh my partner is working so\nhard they're so stressed about this they\nhave a parent who has cancer the more\nthat you understand their perspective\nand they demonstrate their love not by\ngiving me a gift on my birthday but\nthey've been planning this amazing\nvacation for the two of us that's going\nto start in one month and that's where\ntheir mind has been now let's tunnel\ndown and understand this so as you put\nyourself in their shoes the amount of\nhurt you receive actually goes down\nbecause this isn't a case of them being\ncallous or really incredibly mean or\ntrying to hurt your feelings their mind\nis on other things and as you are able\nto understand them it's less offensive\nto you and your capacity to forgive\nactually increases now if we look at\nsomeone who's a narcissist they are\nincapable of doing that right oh my God\nI can't believe you forgot my gift\nyou're the wor I must be completely\nmeaningless to you I must be the most\nworthless human being on the planet I\ndon't understand how you could hurt me I\ndon't understand why you could how you\ncould do this to me and if you deal with\nnarcissist you know exactly what I'm\ntalking about that they take everything\nas a personal injury they don't take any\ntime to think about what your\nperspective is and the real crazy thing\nis yeah that's frustrating for you to\ndeal with but now I want you to imagine\nthings from The Narcissist perspective\nany random occurrence of you being busy\nor you forgetting or whatever suddenly\nturns into a full-on attack for a\nnarcissist narcissists are not happy\npeople they often times are depressed\nthey're anxious they're stressed out\nthey don't have good relationships and\nso this comes at a cost to them the key\nthing to keep in mind though is that\nwhen you are empathic towards other\npeople it reduces the injuries that you\nexperience right so your life becomes\nless painful it becomes less emotionally\ncharged you can focus on other things\ninstead of being wrecked by this\nrelationship and it allows you to\nforgive people more and when you do\nthose two things it enhances the quality\nof the relationship over time so in one\nrelationship there's taking things\npersonally and no forgiveness and in the\nother relationship there is recognizing\nthat your partner has challenges of\ntheir own putting what they did to you\nin context and being able to forgive\nthem and which relationship do you think\nwill lead to more of your satisfaction\nover time and that's the crazy thing is\nthat empathy actually benefits you it\nturns out that empathy also helps us in\nour professional life in an objective\nway so studies find associations between\nempathy in instructors and higher\nstudent motivation and effort using both\ncorrelational and longitudinal designs\nempathy and instructors is also\npositively correlated with actual\nachievement outcomes so if your job is\nto be a teacher and I know we have a ton\nof teachers in our audience y'all are\ngetting absolutely wrecked by school\nsystems right now but what we tend to\nfind is that when instructors are\nempathic their students actually get\nbetter grades and y'all may have\nexperienced this yourself in life right\nbecause sometimes we're lucky enough to\nhave a teacher who cares about us and if\nyou have a single teacher that cares\nabout you and inspires you it can do so\nmuch good for you so interestingly\ncollege students per perceptions of the\nprofessor's concern and consideration\nI.E empathy is the single largest\nprediction predictor of overall teacher\nevaluations perceived teacher empathy\nexplains 54% of the variance while\nperceived teacher competence only\nexplains 6.9% of the variance when\nstudents are evaluating teachers job\nperformance 54% of their evaluation is\ndependent not on how competent the\nteacher is insane not how smart they are\nnot how well they know the material how\norganized their class is it's none of\nthat crap 54% of the variance is\ndetermined by how much the teacher cares\nabout me only six .9% of it depends on\nthings like actual teacher competence\nand I've seen this in the professional\nworld as well when I look at people who\nare strong leaders so I did a lot of\nwork in banking and we have managing\ndirectors that are managing these like\nmergers and Acquisitions of billions of\ndollars and in banking there is a very\nhigh turnover the turn in banking is\nreally high because you get burnt out\nfrom banking over here and then you go\nto this other place you get burnt out\nover there you get burnt out over there\nand so the attit ude of these leaders in\nthese investment Banks is I've got fresh\nmeat right this is how we talk about\npeople we talk about them like meat and\nI need to CH chew them up as quickly as\nI can before they get burnt out and\nleave and this is the attitude that some\nleaders have and once in a blue moon you\nhave a very good leader who cares about\nthe people under them and when they care\nabout the people under them those people\nnot only stay but they perform so much\nbetter and I want yall to think about\nthe times in your life where you perform\nthe best how do the people around you\ntreat you often times when we have\nsupportive parents and coaches who\nencourage us and friends who encourage\nus and you know siblings or even spouses\nthat encourage us it brings out the best\nin us and when you are empathic towards\nother people it actually brings out\ntheir best performance and people look\nat you and think oh my God this person\nis amazing and it leads to positive\nprofessional evaluations so this is why\nyou should be more empathic you should\nbe more compassionate but there is this\nhuge problem of how do I do that because\nunless I'm careful and I'm empathic I'm\ngoing to get taken advantage of I'm\ngoing to suffer from emotional contagion\nand that's where we are going to teach\nyou the core skill of being safely\nempathic okay so this involves a couple\nof different things so the first thing\nto understand is that empathy without\naffective regulation or emotional\nregulation is a recipe for disaster so\nwhen we are empathic we will get some of\ntheir negative energy into us this is\ncalled emotional contagion and we need\nsome way to manage that negative emotion\nso if you are empathic without emotional\nregulation skills empathy is going to be\na net negative for you you won't see\nthese effects because when you are\ncaring about your students and they fail\nyou get depressed so instead of being\nwhat they need you to be you are getting\nyou know you're getting a contagion of\ntheir depression this is what we also\nsee on support communities on the\ninternet which are actually like\ncesspools of negativity if you all know\nwhat I'm talking about these are\noftentimes gender related communities\nand things like that there's just it's\nan absolute mess okay the first thing we\nneed is methods of affective regulation\nor emotional regulation we have a ton of\nvideos on things like Alexia and\ncommunity events and stuff in that where\nwe teach all emotional regulation skills\nbut this is really important right so as\nwe get better at emotional regulation\nskills we can also not engage in\nunhealthy coping mechanisms like\ndrinking smoking that tells you how old\nthis paper is that study I think was\nfrom 2013 right so before like gaming\nand porn and social media were like huge\nthings when they were like in their\ninfancy right so that's what this study\nis talking about but right now we see\nall these negative behaviors like\ninternet use okay so the most important\nskill is the ability to switch wherever\nyour mind is so this is the core this is\nkind of like the robo in the ocean of\nempathy okay this is how you stay afloat\nso let's take an example of when this\ndoes not work so if I'm someone who's\nnarcissistic I ruminate I get stuck in\nmy own head if I'm someone who has\nimpostor syndrome I also ruminate I get\nstuck in my own head right so I look at\nother people and I'm not able to really\nunderstand their perspective so let's\ntake the case of imposter syndrome I\nthink I'm an imposter I think I'm\nterrible and someone walks up to me and\nsays wow you did a great job on that\npresentation and what does my mind do is\nmy mind able to step outside of my own\nhead and step into their head absolutely\nnot right so what I tell myself is oh\nthis person is just being nice I'm not\nactually receiving their compliment I'm\nnot trying to understand their\nperspective I immediately reject someone\nelse's perspective and I say they're\njust saying that to be nice it's a\nformality of course what are they going\nto do walk up to me and say oh my God\nyour presentation was terrible that's\nwhat we do we're not able to step\noutside of our own head and this is\nliterally the treatment for people with\nnarcissistic personality disorder\nthere's a treatment called\nmentalization-based therapy and what\nthat literally means is to mentalize\nmeans to think about someone else's\nperspective to be able to put yourself\nin their shoes Okay so this is very\nimportant to do let's take the flip side\nof it so if you're someone who's a\nhighly sensitive uh person or you're\nprone to emotional contagion what often\ntimes happens is you have the same\nproblem but flipped around when now I\nget caught up in someone else's stuff\nand I can't switch outside of them back\ninto me so this is a huge part if you\nare a mental health professional so my\njob as a psychiatrist is I go into an\noffice and I do Psychotherapy with\nsomeone who's been traumatized and I'm\nthere with them I'm feeling their\nfeelings and then at the end of the hour\nI need to be able to unplug I need to be\nable to leave my work at work and be\nable to go home so I'm empathic with\nthem and then I pull myself out of their\nmind and back into my mind so as a\npsychiatrist even though we're talking\nabout really bad things I can pull\nmyself back into my mind and I can say\nokay at the end of this therapy session\neven though we discussed a lot of heavy\nstuff it's good right this is a good\nthing this person is in therapy even\nthough there's a lot of negative feeling\nin the room right now this is the\nprocess of healing so in that moment I'm\nunplugging from that person and back\ninto myself and so the key skill that we\nneed in order to be successfully\nempathic is the ability to switch right\nso if I'm stuck in my own head and\nruminating I need to consider their\nperspective and if I'm caught up in\ntheir perspective it's a whirlwind and\nwe also see this in people like\nhelicopter parents and parents who live\nvicariously through their children right\nthere's like a blending that goes on\nthat's super toxic between parent and\nchild that parent needs to back the\nup you know what I'm saying like does\nthat kind of make sense so that's the\nkey skill so now the question becomes\nhow do we become more empathic without\ngetting swept away with emotional\ncontagion so we're going to go into a\ncouple of fundamental empathy-based\nskills which most psychiatrists and\ntherapists have to learn which you can\nabsolutely learn too to harness the\nbenefits of empathy so the first thing\nto understand is that empathy without\naffective or emotional regulation is a\nproblem so when we're empathic we are in\nin essence either thinking or\nunderstanding what someone else's\nbelieves or feeling what they feel now\nthis can be beneficial in many ways but\nif we're not careful we will get swept\nup with their feelings so as\npsychiatrists and therapists we have to\nlearn how to limit how to be empathic\nand compassionate without being\noverwhelmed so there are a couple of\ndifferent ways to do that the first\nthing to understand is when you are\nbeing empathic towards someone recognize\nthat your responsibility is to help them\nnot to fix their problems now this is a\nsubtle but very important difference so\nI see this a lot when I was teaching\nright so I was faculty at Harvard\nMedical School and so the people that I\nwas teaching were very very driven these\nare some of the most caring hardworking\npeople they've volunteered for thousands\nand thousands of hours they've worked in\nrefugee camps in remote parts of the\nworld they've also done things like you\nknow teach mindfulness in prisons like\nall kinds these are just deeply caring\npeople and when they actually graduated\nfrom med school and became interns\nresidents psychiatrists and training\nthey started to get overwhelmed or some\nof them get very quickly overwhelmed by\nhow much they care about their patients\nbecause if you're a therapist or a\npsychiatrist or a school teacher what\nyou find is that you can't fix someone\nelse's life but since you are there to\nhelp them we can if we're not careful\nwe'll get really muddy with this and we\nwill try to fix their life instead\nrecognize that being empathic is not\nabout fixing someone's life it is about\nhelping them fix their own life if we\naccept responsibility for fixing their\nlife we have this person that we're\ntrying to fix that we can't control we\ncan't make sure they wake up on time we\ncan't make sure that they work on their\nresume we can't be in the room with them\nwhen they're interviewing with a job or\nwith them when they go on a date and so\nwe are attaching ourselves to success in\ntheir life which will tear us apart\nbecause as they keep making mistakes we\nwill invest more and more energy and\nbecome more and more burnt out so one of\nthe things that we have to learn as\npsychiatrist and something that I really\nfocus on teaching is that your\nresponsibility is to help not to fix so\nyou're going to in a sense limit the\namount of time and energy that you're\ngoing to do with 100% compassion while\nyou're there and then set limits around\nit right so as a therapist I see people\nonce a week usually for about an hour\nand I'm 100% present with them but when\nthey leave the office it's their\nresponsibility to take the next step\noften times what we find in people who\nare empathic is that they don't do this\nright they're ing up on their friend\ntrying to make sure that everything is\ngoing okay they're texting them every\nday and then what paradoxically happens\nis that your friend stops being\nresponsible for their life because you\nare taking on all of the responsibility\nas you take on all of the responsibility\nyou start siphoning their burnout into\nyourself so we need a way to limit or\nregulate our emotions when we're\nempathic with someone the best way is as\nwe said just limiting what you sign up\nfor and this mental shift will be\nincredibly helpful but then we can also\ndo a lot of standard emotional\nregulation techniques journaling going\nfor walks self-care right we're not\ngetting so caught up in their stuff that\nwe start neglecting ourselves it's time\nto set limits with them take care of\nourselves meditate eat healthy go for a\nwalk pet your cat whatever it is that\nyou do play some video games go for it\nthe second thing that we need to learn\nhow to do is mentalize so if we look at\ntreatments for narcissistic personality\ndisorder what we are literally trying to\nteach is something called mentalizing\nwhich is the capacity to step outside of\nyour own mind and step into someone\nelse's so when a narcissist feels hurt\nby someone this is where oh this person\nforgot my birthday and I take it so\npersonally right I don't think about\neverything that's going on in their life\nI don't think about all the difficulties\nin their life I'm just thinking about me\nwe tend to ruminate in our heads so how\ndo we stop ruminating in our heads how\ndo we actively take on on an outside\nperspective so this is where if you're\ncareful what you'll find is that when\nyou're ruminating signals from the\noutside will disagree with you so we're\ngoing to use the example of giving a\npresentation so let's say I have a big\npresentation to give and I'm very\nnervous about it I'm like oh my God this\npresentation could go terribly it's so\nimportant I'm going to be talking in\nfront of hundreds of people this is so\nimportant for my job or my career or my\nclass or whatever so you're filled with\nanxiety and you're worried about the\npresentation not going well and then\nwhat happens is the presentation happens\nand then you're terrified the whole time\nyou're anxious the whole time you\nprepared for it so much the presentation\nends someone walks up to you and was\nlike Hey Dr K I thought you did a great\njob I really loved your presentation and\nwhat do you do in your mind you reject\nwhat they say right you say like oh your\nmind says I didn't do a good job because\nI was feeling anxious my perspective is\nthat I was anxious I should have\nprepared more other people are better\nand I did a terrible job you are getting\ndata from the outside side that is\ncontrary to your belief now if we don't\nknow how to mentalize what we will do is\nreject that that data right we'll say oh\nthis person is just saying it to be nice\nthat's what they say to everyone right\nthis is what we do we dismiss what\nsomeone says so the core skill of\nmentalization is to assume for a moment\nthat the other person is right and then\ntry to figure out what do they have to\nexperience in order for this to be right\nwhere are they coming from how could\nthey Poss POS believe that this\npresentation was good and the\ninteresting thing is if we sort of focus\non assuming that the other person is\nright for a little while we're not\nsaying take what they say is 100%\ncorrect what we're saying is sort of\nconsider for a moment that they could be\nright and try to in your mind work\nthrough some logic to arrive at their\nconclusion well I did have some pretty\ncool graphics over there I had that joke\nthat people laughed at at the very\nbeginning people asked a lot of\nquestions and usually crappy you know\npresentations people are sort of\nmentally checked out and this is what we\nteach people with narcissistic\npersonality disorder when someone says\nhey you're kind of an where are\nthey coming from what could they\npossibly have experienced that make them\nthink this way right and when we\nliterally step outside of our heads and\nspend some time trying to hypothesize\nwhat is in someone else's head that's\nincredibly effective so this is a skill\nthat you can level up you know immensely\nover time but even that basic element\nwill reduce the rumination and sort of\nreally help you become a little bit more\nempathic cuz empathy helps us step\noutside of ourselves and into other\npeople so there's one last thing to\nconsider which is that a lot of y'all\nmay be listening to this and thinking\nwell sometimes like I feel super\nobligated to help people I try to help\nthem I really like do my best but I\ndon't seem to be getting these mental\nhealth benefits I'm still hopeless I\nfeel depressed I feel anxious I feel\nstressed out all the time so this is the\nreally fascinating thing about empathy\nin order to get the health benefits of\nempathy what is in your heart actually\nmatters if you do something out of a\nsense of stress and obligation it does\nnot lead to health benefits you have to\ndo things in order to actually help\npeople and to be focused on helping the\nother person so for example if you force\nsomeone into community service or\nvolunteering they do not get the\nbenefits of this sort of compassionate\nperspective importantly a recent study\nfound that in order to receive a health\nbenefit of volunteering people have had\nto be motivated by care for others those\nwho were po who were motivated by\npotential ways they could personally\nbenefit from volunteering learning\nsomething new or feeling good did not\nexperience a later health benefit so I\nwork with a lot of medical students who\nare like okay like in order to get into\nmedical school I have to volunteer for\n5,000 hours and they will go volunteer\nfor the sake of padding their resume\nthis does not result in health benefits\nso a lot of times what we feel is we get\npushed into a situation where we have to\nhelp someone but in our hearts unless we\nwant to help them unless we actually\ncare about them our oxytocin our\nserotonin or cortisol will not be\naffected in the right way so I know it\nsounds kind of weird but what you really\nhave to do is think about the other\nperson think about helping them and set\nhealthy boundaries right there's only so\nmuch you can do and then kind of take a\nstep back help them in that way and then\ntake a step back that's the healthy way\nto be empathic so I know it sounds kind\nkind of crazy but in this world everyone\nis becoming more narcissistic and there\nis data to support that everyone is like\nin order to get ahead in life you got to\nstep on other people the really\nbeautiful thing is that if we become\nselfless which is something that I try\nto cultivate right so there's kinds of\nmeditation like metha meditation\ndeveloping compassion I see a huge gain\nin the people that I work with it\nbenefits you to care about other people\nI haven't talked about the benefits for\nother people at all over the course of\nthis video right and that's because\nwe're not talking about them we're\ntalking about you and this is the other\nbeautiful thing one last advantage that\nI'm going to leave yall with in a world\nwhere everyone is looking out for\nthemselves imagine what it's like if you\nmeet someone who actually cares about\nother people your value as a human being\nthe way that people perceive you the way\nthat people will treat you if you are\nsomeone who is kind in a world of people\nwho are burnt out will be so much higher\nand what I see when I work with people\nwho are in relationships is like what\nwhat do they say they say that this\nperson was nice this person was kind\nwhat I value about them so much is that\nis their kindness and then a lot of\npeople get really upset because they're\nlike I'm a nice guy right I'm a nice guy\nI don't understand why people don't suck\nmy I don't know if that needs to be\nedited out right but that's what people\nsay but if you look at these people who\nare nice guys what is in their heart\nthey're acting transactionally which is\nwhy they don't they don't get perceived\nfirst of all they may be nice but\nthey're not empathic they're not\ncompassionate they're acting nice in\norder to get something so if you are\ngenuinely good right if you really focus\non compassion then it will be such a\nbreath of fresher it will be such a\ncompetitive advantage and now we get to\nthe biggest problem in this video which\nis that I I recently showed y'all\nevidence that if you are being kind for\nthe sake of gaining something like\nimproving your mental health then the\nkindness does doesn't work right that it\ndoesn't actually improve your mental\nhealth and that's something that I\nhaven't figured out so maybe in\neducating y'all about the value of\nempathy what I've actually done is Doom\ny'all to an existence where now that is\nno longer an option I don't know maybe\nwe'll figure it out I think it's still\nokay so give it a shot and let us know\nokay my condolences I did it out of love\nI didn't think this through\nB\n[Music]"
