    "transcript": "a lot of what's going on with men right\nnow it's loneliness it's isolation it's\ntouch starvation it's suicidality\nsexlessness as well sexlessness and it's\nno individual person's responsibility\nbut the real problem with this is that\nthese are not problems that men can\nsolve on their own this is exactly why\nthis is the problem that men are\nexperiencing because as men we are\ntaught to be independent we are taught\nto be you should fix everything on your\nown and so men have fixed all of the\nthings that we can fix on our own the\nonly thing that's left is the things\nthat we must rely on other people for\nright so no one complaining about I mean\na lot of men are obese but there's not\nlike an obesity there is a crisis but\nthat's not what's bothering people\nthat's not where we're losing the war\nwe're not losing the war on baldness\nright so there are lots of things as a\nman that you can fix in your own life\nit's just the real challenge is that no\none is willing to take responsibility\nfor any level of connection with men and\nso that's not something that is going to\nget fixed cuz you need another human\nbeing to hug you like you can't hug\nyourself it just doesn't work"
