    "transcript": "the interesting thing about the red pill\nCommunity is they're the only community\nthat allows men to suffer so if a man\ntoday says I am struggling the most\ncommon thing that they hear in return is\nthat you are privileged you should not\nbe struggling so the interesting thing\nis that the red pill Community is the\nonly community that says if you're\nstruggling yeah you are struggling\nbecause you suck they're the only ones\nthat say yes your life is hard here is a\nway to make it better and so I think one\nof the biggest problems that we see with\nmen right now is that they have nowhere\nelse to go where someone at least\naccepts the premise that your life is\nhard now I think there's a lot of\ntoxicity that comes out of the red pill\nCommunity because I've worked with a lot\nof incels and red pillars and things\nlike that and I think that it's almost\ntextbook like avoidant attachment kind\nof theory sort of stuff and literally\nevery single one that I've worked with\nhas had some kind of incredibly\ntraumatic experience with a woman that\nthey then generalize to women as a whole\nwhich I think is a big mistake"
