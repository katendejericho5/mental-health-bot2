    "transcript": "the reason that men are reluctant to go\nto couples counseling is because they\nare not good with verbal expression of\ntheir emotional state so anytime they go\ninto coup's counseling they feel\noutgunned because their female partner\nis able to like articulate their\nemotional experience better it feels\nlike the therapist ends up understanding\nand siding with the female partner more\nand this is where the society jumps to a\nconclusion it says okay so this is a\nproblem that you guys have as men you\nneed to learn how to talk about your\nemotions more therein lies the bias we\nnever stop to ask ourselves hold on a\nsecond if men are not very good at\ntalking about their emotions are there\ndifferent ways to manage emotions and if\nyou look at historically the way that\nmen manage emotions we have all kinds of\nthings that are different we are much\nmore physical and that's viewed as a\nnegative thing right if you have a\nproblem with someone you should\narticulate it out so already we're\nstarting to see that the way that our\nsociety judges particular things we\nplace articulation of emotions above\nphysical expression of emotions"
