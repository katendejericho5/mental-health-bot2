another healthy gamer\nGG stream my name is Dr oh oh we lagging\nmy name is Dr Al kenoa just a reminder\nthat although I am a psychiatrist\nnothing we discuss on stream today is\nintended to be taken as medical advice\neverything is for educational or\nentertainment purposes only if you all\nhave a concern or question please go see\na licensed professional okay so happy\nTuesday everybody um sorry we had to\nreschedule stream yesterday I uh was on\na podcast on Saturday and I the podcast\nlasted 5 hours and my voice was\ncompletely shot so I needed a day to\nkind of recover um I'm sure yall will\nhear about the podcast soon enough but\nlet's get started so I have a couple of\nuh quick announcements coming up the\nfirst is um I wrote a book it is called\nhow to raise a healthy gamer it comes\nout in about a week so I am super\nthrilled about the book for a couple of\nreasons so the book is actually geared\ntowards parents and teaches them\ncommunication skills and how to set\nboundaries and form an alliance with\ntheir kids so I know that the majority\nof our audience is not parents but there\nare a couple things that I just wanted\nto uh keep in mind because people keep\non asking me okay so Dr K like how do I\nget better at talking to people how do I\nget better at forming relationships so\neven though even if you y'all aren't\nparents I think how to raise a healthy\ngamer is the best example of learn how\nto talk like Dr K so if you guys want to\nlearn how to communicate the way that I\ncommunicate that's where I basically\nlaid that out for parents but the the\nthe communication skills are applicable\nto any kind of relationship so there's\neven a section for example about talking\nabout your to talking to your spouse if\nyour spouse disagrees with you which is\nsort of a side point but I think the\nfundamentals of communication that I use\nthat we also teach all of our coaches um\nwhich is partially responsible for their\nexcellent outcome so how to listen how\nto talk how to maintain boundaries with\nother people there's like basically a\nstep-by-step guide to that the last\nthought that I also had recently is that\nif your parents suck at communicating\nwith you and listening to you and\nhearing your perspective get them the\nbook um because I realize that like the\nthe biggest challenge that we sort of\nface uh is that we have a group of\nparents who don't know how to\ncommunicate with their kids especially\ngiven the the\ndifficult uh challenges that\ntechnology give us right so there's like\na whole social skills atrophy so if\nyouall are interested please check that\nout a couple of other things to keep in\nmind um we are we launched memberships\nand I just wanted to share with yall\nactually a couple of different things\nthe first we have a couple of community\nwins let's talk about\nthose so\nfirst time structuring my morning for\nADHD how did I do so I think this is\nfantastic so like this is cool because\nlook the community is learning so 6:30\na.m. walk to the kitchen and do 10\nJumping Jacks and walk back so I love\nthe low resolution of this listen to One\nChief Keef song I don't know who that is\ntake medicine with waffles so I love how\nthere's like a 15minute segment that has\nvery little quote unquote oh no what's\ngoing on here why is this clipped hold\non this is\nwonky okay it's bleeding through here\nbut whatever I guess it's too late to\nfix now what apps okay um let me see if\nI\ncan camera is off centered in the\noverlay I'm going to switch at some\npoint if yall want to fix\nit\nokay okay so uh and then 6:45 a.m. turn\non the shower so I think this is like\nawesome because often times when we're\ndoing things we try to um be a little\nbit too ambitious and so we set up tasks\nfor ourselves and then what ends up\nhappening is if you kind of think about\nit right like a 15minute segment this is\na successful 15 minutes the problem is\nwe don't consider this as like doing\nanything and so we don't end up we don't\neven break this apart but this is great\nso like these are Community Wom\num there's another super cool Community\nwin that I want to share with\nyall which is I clipped your video and\nedited into a piece into an art piece of\nmy own today it won first place in\nPurdue 2024 art design undergraduate\nexhibition amongst thousands of other\napplicants if I were a streamer I know\nthis is something I would love to see I\nhope this gets to you I've attached the\nlink below so someone turned something\nthat we did into art because heaven\nknows that this is not art what we do so\nlet's kind of check this out I don't\nthink that we're actually going to get\nsound from this oh that's interesting\nbecause this does not have do we have\nbrowser\nsound nope okay so that's something we\ngot to fix too at some point but all\nright whatever so let's see if we can I\nguess it'll just play through my mic\nwhich will be kind of annoying but\nwhatever it makes me feel a lot better I\njust feel but do you get that I'm just\nnot saying that to be nice like do you\ndo you agree I'm saying like you\nunderstand how your mind is picking up\nnew Concepts and like using them in a\nvery Rapid\nWay don't think\nI'm can you all hear that not not very\nmuch right I am genuinely a smart person\nI wouldn't be where I am today if I was\njust dumb you\nknow I I obviously am smart in a lot of\nways I know I understand things but I\njust\nfeel like that it's almost like Ace of\nis turned off right now and I really\nwant to try to turn it back on I feel\nI'm not living I I'm not wow this is\ncool I'm not\nenjo yeah I it's it's not hold on a\nsecond let me see if I can add a\nsource the problem is that we don't have\na browser source for video on here GG\nokay well we'll we'll share with y'all I\nI know the the audio is super low so\nsorry about the technical difficulties I\ndon't know what happened with our stream\nsetup um but yeah this is super cool so\nsomeone I guess turn this into art I\nknow yall can't see the thing we'll\nwe'll share a link with y'all um here is\nthe here is the\nlink so and y'all can go and check it\nout yourself that's okay sorry about\nthat and then the other thing um that\nwe're talking about real quick sorry I\nguess we'll just move on is\nuh\num yeah let's see so those are couple of\ncommunity wins sorry we kind of flubbed\nthose chat so let's get on to one other\nthing before we move on so we started\nmemberships and uh memberships are going\nincredibly well so I think we're seeing\na lot of people who are really learning\na lot of stuff so we're super happy with\nthat so there are live Deep dive\nlectures yall get to pick what the\ntopics are there's Q&A once a month so\nwhatever questions we don't get to in\nthe lecture that are left over we sort\nof answer those um and then there is a\nwhole Community element to it there are\nweekly quests I think part of the reason\nthat we sort of started memberships is\nbecause for a couple reasons the first\nis that so the challenge with\nstream okay is that people kind of come\nand go which is cool right so stream is\ngreat for what it is the other challenge\num is\nthat see we can talk about stuff on the\ninternet but it doesn't always translate\nover\n[Music]\ninto action the other challenge that we\nhave when we sort of make content on the\ninternet for stream is that we sort of\nhave to start from zero every single\ntime so what we're really starting to\nsee in memberships is is that people are\nprogressing in a very significant way um\nand I'll give you all just a simple\nexample of this there's one last thing\nthat I want to show youall which is\ngoing to be kind of weird um\nand so let me just show you all this\nreal\nquick so this is kind of like a good\nexample of\noh what I think memberships is good at\nso this is going to be kind of weird all\nright so this is where we what we'll do\nis we'll kind of like we explain this\nconcept some of these more advanced\nspiritual concepts of indria glisha or\nVasa okay and I know y'all don't really\nknow what this means but but the whole\npoint oh of membership\nis that we\nare I think this is this so if yall kind\nof look at this we'll ask this question\nis this an indria Kisha or Vasa and then\npeople will discuss it and the whole\npoint of this is that like when we teach\nthese Concepts right we'll have a video\nabout discipline or willpower or\nwhatever which we'll talk about today\nthe challenge though is that in order\nfor it to be applied to your life you\nhave to manipulate the information so in\nPsychiatry when we are trying to decide\nwhether someone has the mental capacity\nto do something like leave the hospital\nafter a heart attack so patients are\nhave the right to autonomy right so a\npatient can say I don't want lifesaving\ntreatment they're allowed to refuse that\nthe problem is is their mind functioning\nproperly right because sometimes if you\nhave like something like a stroke your\nbrain isn't functioning and then if you\nsay I want to leave the hospital like\nyour brain is malfunctioning so we as\ndoctors have to figure out is this\nperson actually like mentally there or\nare they not there and so one of the key\nfactors for assessing mental capacity is\nthe manipulation of\ninformation so what we're really seeing\nis a a skills growth an understanding of\nthings a manipulation of the information\nit's not just Dr K says this therefore\nit's correct it's that if we really want\nto understand how to control our\nmind we have to understand these these\nyogic terms like vasana\nindria what is the relationship between\nthese three things and how it shapes our\nmind so we're seeing a lot of good\nprogress there um and then just to give\nyou all kind of a quick heads up so what\nwe're doing uh in March is a deep dive\ninto thundra and meditation actually\ntomorrow and then we're doing a deep\ndive into discipline so I know that we\nhave resources like Dr K's guide where\nwe'll kind of talk about Thun and this\nkind of stuff which is good right we'll\ntalk a little bit about it we have some\nstream here there but the whole point is\nthat if youall want more depth and more\napplicability that's what we sort of\nhave in\nmemberships the simple reason that we\ncharge for it is very very simple it's\nthat I know thiss sounds kind of stupid\nbut what I realized I didn't realize\nthis at the very beginning but the more\nwe build stuff for free a lot of the\nstuff that we do is for free right um\nbut the more free stuff you make for\nmore people the more expensive it\ngets which Dr K was too stupid to\nrealize when I started and that's that's\nwhy we uh you know literally what what\nthe membership\ncost does is it actually buys out my\ntime because I have to generate some\namount of money to keep healthy gamer\ngoing and if I want to make more content\nI can't do other kinds of work um so for\nexample like you know we'll we'll like\nwe also skip things like a lot of\nsponsorships and stuff like that so we\ntry to be very like thoughtful about who\nwe take money from from right Dr K only\nfans or Dr K gambling sponsorship\nincoming and so what we've always tried\nto do is deliver value to our community\nand then we try to deliver it at the\nlowest cost possible we've got two tiers\num one is the base tier where you get\nall the value and then if yall want to\ngive us additional money just to support\nthe work that we're doing that's why we\nhave that\nokay so discipline and Tantra are coming\nthis week this month um and then the\nother cool thing is that yall basically\nget to decide what I talk about so uh\nyeah so it's chosen by the the\nmembers\nokay Dr K only fit is that the payal\ncontent that yall\nwant okay I was saying that that is not\nsomething that I was planning on doing\nbut I can't tell if y'all are serious or\nnot serious\nall right but we've got stuff to do and\nwe're running late already okay\num all right so this is lit let me see\nif I can do you guys mind if I try to\ncrop my\ncamera by myself can Dr K try to do\nthis\nno oh look at that holy [ __ ] dude look\nat me oh my God camera cropped\nson did it\nokay cropped by their\nself I love that Indian racial bonus to\nlike technology Dr K's never done that\nbefore but just racial bonus to\ntechnology I made my check for those of\nyou all that are playing D and D or\nbg3 um no but seriously if y'all want to\ntalk about stuff like G gam Sutra and uh\nyou know thrixxx and stuff we can talk\nabout that but you know I think it's\nlike not\nsee here's the other challenge is if we\nlike if we talk about that on places\nlike twitch or potentially YouTube or\nwhatever right like there's a chance\nthat we'll get flagged with all kinds of\nstuff we can get demonetized we can all\nkinds of things can go wrong so um\nanyway so a lot of the content that we\ncover in memberships is going to be the\nstuff that would like absolutely\nSlaughter us on the content platforms so\nthere there's a specific space where\nwe're not worried about metrics and view\ncount stuff like that it's whatever yall\nwant\nokay all right so let's talk about hold\non a second I am going to I want to just\ntime myself okay so let's talk about\nwillpower if willpower is finite what's\nthe alternative a few months ago I was\nfeeling a bit unproductive and\nprocrastinating a lot on college so I\nstarted researching for how to improve\nthis and G and this gave me a boost of\nconfidence things like the Pomodoro\nTechnique were mentioned a lot so\ndecided to try it I would get up early\nin the mornings and I'd work for 4 to 6\nhours deeply focused Advanced a lot in\nmy tasks and I wouldn't feel much tired\nfascinating in fact I'd feel very\nsatisfied with myself the best part is\nthat I would only study until lunchtime\nand then I had the rest of the day for\nmyself this routine worked very well for\naround a week or so then I began feeling\nvery lethargic I would have no energy in\njust just thinking about the work gave\nme negative feelings\nthe Pomodoro Technique stopped working\nI'd work for about 10 minutes and then\nI'd get a sense of dread and an urge to\nprocrastinate just seeing the clock\nticking down made me feel awful because\nI could see I was wasting my time also\nhaving my study time so strictly\nscheduled didn't sit right with me at\nthe end of the day I'd feel bad and\nexhausted for barely advancing anything\nnowadays I feel like I can't focus for\nmore than an hour or so every day what\nexactly happened here why was I able to\nwork so well during during this time and\nthen plummeted and then plummeted after\nI think what happened is that during\nthose weeks I was running on Willpower\nbut from what I gather Willow is a\nfinite resource so my question is this\nif willpower is finite what's the\nalternative how can we maintain a steady\nand sustainable workflow without re\nhaving to rely on Willpower okay great\nquestion so there's another question\nhere which is is Willow a drainable\nbattery an improvable\nmuscle um so I guess in this one book\nthey say that willpower is a\nrechargeable\nresource on the other hand Dr portrays\nDr K portrays willpower as a muscle that\ncan be improved for example certain\npractices of meditation will FOC uh\nfocus on using willpower to resist the\ntemptation of\nmoving so these two supposedly this\nhelps practice our restraint muscle and\nconsequently improve our willpower\nso which is it is willpower a muscle can\nthat can be improved or is it a finite\nresource okay now this is a very common\nproblem so as we go through life we\nrealize I need more willpower and\neveryone says be disciplined be have\nwillpower but the challenge is that as\nwe start to exert willpower sometimes\nwe'll get this burst of\nactivity where I'm working really hard\nand it works great for a week and then\nall of these old patterns start to\nemerge and now it gets really confusing\nbecause is willpower a drainable\nresource should it be conserved or is it\na muscle that needs to be worked out and\nit needs to be improved so how do we\nunderstand this stuff should I use\nwillpower should I not use willpower is\nit good or is it\nbad so in order to understand this we\nneed to understand human behavior\nand then we will see what role willpower\nhas and then we will also see why a\nyogic perspective and doing things like\ngetting rid of all of your ambition\nactually helps you in the long run okay\nso this is really confusing stuff right\nso people are like oh like all these\nyogis out there saying like oh like let\ngo of your ambition and like let go of\nyour desire but then we get really\nconfused because it's things like\nwillpower desire willpower helps us\nsometimes but desire motivation ambition\nthis is what drives us so in order to\nreally understand this problem we just\nhave to unpack this so when a human\nbeing acts there are five sources of\naction within a human\nbeing the first is desire I want\nsomething right so there's an internal\nmotivation that kind of goes in a\nparticular\ndirection the second reason that we Act\nis a habit so there's a lot of action\nthat happens within humans that is\nautomatic the third reason that we Act\nis an emotion so if we look at what what\nis the reason we have emotions emotions\nare sources of information and sources\nof motivation so if I'm walking down the\nstreet and I see I don't know a giant\nsnake this triggers an emotional\nreaction that causes me to run away or\nrun forward and try to hug it depending\non what my emotion is right I fall in\nlove with this person I love this person\nso much so I'm going to go to the gym\nso emotions motivate us habit cause us\nto act desires will Trigger action and\nthen there is some kind of other let's\njust call it an internal motivation\nbecause there may be other things within\nus things like ambition right so\nambition is you can maybe uh describe it\nas a desire but let's just say that\nthere's like kind of this fourth\ncategory so even then when we talk about\ndesire there are two kinds of Desire\nthis is what I mean by internal\nmotivation so some desires are born of\nthe sensory organs so I'm walking down\nthe street I smell a hamburger cooking\nand I want to eat it I'm watching\nsomething on the Internet and I see an\nadvertisement for a video game and then\nI want to play it so sensory input\ntriggers desire and then there's some\nkind of internal motivation these are\nthe four things so let's understand the\nrole of\nwillpower\nokay so actually let's take a a quick uh\nside note into Neuroscience so when I\nsay that there's an internal motivation\nand desire these are two different\nthings what do I mean by that what I'm\ntalking about is\nneuroscientifically so if you look at\nyour desire to do something there are\ntwo parts of the brain that are active\none is your nucleus succumbent this is\nthe pleasure or dopamine Circuit of the\nbrain so when you feel like playing a\nvideo game it's not like ambition it is\nthe nucleus succumbent is telling you\nhey we want to spurt a dopamine let's do\nthis pornography Doom scrolling playing\nvideo games eating healthy food all of\nthese trigger the nucleus cumbent but\nwhat we know is that some amount of\nmotivation or the desire to act does not\ncome from the nucleus accumbent in fact\nthere are parts of our brain this is\nmore of the serotonergic system which\nLongs for things like fulfillment\ncontentment security that's not the\nnucleus accumbent okay so we literally\nhave two parts of the brain this is\nmaybe the anterior singulate cortex as\nan example the serotonergic system\nversus the dopamine system and both of\nthese will drive our Behavior okay so we\nhave four sources of behavior emotions\nwhich come from the amydala the\nserotonergic circuit which is where\nthings like security ambition the desire\nfor contentment that's the serotonergic\nsystem the gratification of pleasure or\ndesires that's the nucleus accumbent and\nthen the fourth is our habit circuitry\nwhich is the endoc canabo circuitry so\ncannabinoids basically form habits\nokay so now what about willpower because\nI said there's five right so now let's\nunderstand willpower willpower is used\nto over ride the other four willpower\ncomes from our frontal loes so let's say\nI have a desire to eat a hamburger so\nthe nucleus cumbent is telling me let's\neat a hamburger let's get give me some\nthat dopamine give me some that dopamine\nson and so my frontal L step in restrain\nthat impulse let's say I feel anxious\ngoing to class and raising my hand my\namydala is telling me don't raise your\nhand don't raise your hand be invisible\nmy frontal loes kick in and say no no no\nwe strain that impulse in the amydala\nand we're going to raise our hand let's\nsay I have a\nhabit of adding sugar to my coffee even\nbefore I think about it my brain is like\nokay let's add sugar to our coffee this\nisn't even a desire for coffee it's\nautomatic in order to restrain that\ncannabinoid circuitry I need the frontal\nloes and I need\nwillpower and then sometimes we have\nthis other serotonergic circuitry which\ndrives us in a particular direction like\nI want to be ambitious I want to\naccomplish a lot and then we're our\nfrontal loes can still re that in so the\nfrontal loes control the other parts of\nour brain this is\nwillpower and so now we run into a\nproblem because the Neuroscience\nresearch tells us that willpower is a\nfatigable finite resource that usually\ngets\nreplenished when you go to sleep this is\ntrue okay so we know this because we\nknow there are a lot of studies that\nshow that it is hard to use willpower to\nmake the right decision when your\nfrontal loes are\nexhausted so if you think about eating\nhealthy it is easier to eat healthy in\nthe morning than it is at night when\nyou're fatigued right so you can like\nyou pack your lunch in the morning you\ngo to work but then by the end of the\nday you're exhausted you're tired so let\nme play video games let me eat unhealthy\nfood so we know that willpower runs out\nand it has to run out right because this\nis the other way to think about it which\nis that if it never ran out then doing\nwillpower for the first 5 minutes would\nfeel the same as 10 minutes uh 10 hours\nlater you could constantly exert\nwillpower and if it was not a fatigable\nresource everything would be easy but we\nknow it's a fatigable\nresource there's a really great\nexperiment on this which I'll touch on\nvery quickly which is what I call the\ncookie and beet\nexperiment so two groups of people were\ngiven an impossible task like it's like\na puzzle like a maze that doesn't\nactually have an exit you can't get from\nthe entrance to the exit or the or\nwhatever and they basically saw how long\nuntil people give up and what they did\nis they actually had a really\ninteresting condition so the the maze is\nunsolvable but while they're waiting for\nthe maze they're sitting in a waiting\nroom and there there's two plates of\nfood there there's the control condition\nand then there's the experimental\ncondition in one room there's a plate of\nchocolate chip cookies and in the other\nroom there's a plate of boiled\nbeets and the participants are told you\nare not allowed to eat this food this is\nfor for someone\nelse so in the chocolate chip cookie\ncondition people didn't eat the food but\nthey had to resist eating the food\nwhereas in The Boiled beets there's no\nresistance so what they found is that if\nyou had to resist the chocolate chip\ncookies you gave up on the maze faster\nthan if you had to resist the Beats\nbecause there's no resisting the Beats\nthere's nothing to resist there's no\ndesire and so in the beat condition\ntheir willpower was less drained so we\nknow that willpower is a fatig a\nresource but what about this whole idea\nof okay it's a a muscle to be trained\nabsolutely just because just because\nit's a a fatigable resource does not\nmean that it is not a muscle it's not a\nmuscle it's\nneurons but what we know is you can\ntrain a part of the brain so I think\nabout willpower is as a\nbattery but you can increase the size of\nyour\nbattery by doing things like meditating\nby doing things like emotional\nregulation techniques right so we\nliterally have things that will teach\nI'll teach these people uh skills in\nADHD or addiction Psychiatry when I'm\nworking with patients where I will teach\nthem how to restrain their emotional\nimpulses and as they practice they get\nbetter at it you still using willpower\nbut we can increase the size of our\nbattery\nbut if you are using willpower every\nsingle day to restrain your desires\nrestrain your Ambitions restrain your\nhabits and restrain your emotions you\nwill burn out in fact if we look at why\nburnout is so big in the world today it\nis because we are using so much\nwillpower we are relying on Willpower to\nconstantly restrain the other parts of\nourselves this is also why meditation is\nbooming because everyone is realizing my\nbattery is too small so I need to\nstrengthen it and so what ends up\nhappening we strengthen our battery we\nincrease the reserve of our willpower\nbut every day is a fight\ndo you all get that we have so many bad\nhabits to begin with that we are using\nwillpower constantly doesn't work this\nis what leads to\nburnout so let's understand how to make\nthings easy remember willpower is only\nnecessary when it needs to override one\nof these other\nthings so what the yogi says is that the\nreal way to live life is not to use a\nbunch of willpower or discipline do\nyouall get this so they have a lot of\nwillpower certainly but when they're\nsitting in the caves in the Himalayas\nevery day the reason that they're able\nto do that day in and day out the reason\nthat they're disciplined is because they\nhave actually decreased the strength of\nthe other four so understand this if I\nhave a very strong\ndesire I need this much willpower to\novercome it but the smaller desires that\nI have the less willpower that I need\nright if I have a very strong habit I\nneed a lot of willpower to overcome it\nbut if I reduce the size of my habit The\nWillpower necessary is\nlow if I have so if I'm a little bit\npissed right then it's easy to restrain\nthat okay I can be patient but if I get\nto care and level pissed then it\nrequires a lot of willpower to over\novercome it so this is the key thing to\nunderstand in the yogic system what the\nyogis realized is that you absolutely\nstrengthen your willpower but what you\nshould really do if you want to make\nlife easy and be in full control where\nyou need a small amount of willpower to\novercome anything you need to make your\nDesir smaller you need to let go of your\nemotions you need to actually even get\nrid of\nhabits and crazily enough you need to\nget rid of your\nambition so as you become more\ndesireless the amount of willpower\nneeded\ndecreases and then something really cool\nhappens\nbecause now you are no longer\nrestraining yourself does this make\nsense so let's understand this like so\nall of the progress that you want in\nlife is overcoming your internal stuff\nright so I want to eat a hamburger I\nmean my my body wants a hamburger or my\ntongue wants a hamburger but something\nup here restrains that impulse using\nwillpower and so the real way to to make\nthis work right so this is what I work\ndo with my patients who have who are\naddicts or even people who want to\nexercise and stuff like that is when I\nhave patients who exercise very\nregularly I ask them how much willpower\ndoes it take they say very little they\ndon't need a whole lot so I was working\nwith a professional swimmer for example\nand he said after 20 years of swimming I\nstill hate how cold the water is when I\nfirst get in so they need 5 Seconds of\nwillpower in order to do their full\nworkout and that is just to get in the\npool the rest of it is\neasy so what we advocate for if you\nreally want your life to be easy and you\ndon't even want willpower you don't even\nneed willpower it's to actually control\nthese other four variables decrease your\ndesires regulate your\nemotions alter your\nhabits and get rid of your ambition and\nthen what happens and this is what\nreally confuses people because they say\nisn't my ambition what motivates me no I\nmean yeah sort of right but the whole\npoint is that when you have ambition the\nother parts of your brain are like we\ndon't want to do this your nucleus\nsuccumbent is like no [ __ ] you serotonin\nsystem and by the way there's an inverse\nrelationship between dopamine and\nserotonin where if you engage in a bunch\nof dopaminergic activity your serotonin\nlevels actually go down right this is\nwhy you can have so much fun I can do a\nbunch of drugs I can play a lot of video\ngames but then I won't feel content or\nfulfilled at the end of the day whereas\nI can work out I can eat healthy I can\nwork hard I can learn an instrument and\nat the end of the day I feel good about\nmyself those are two opposite systems\nactually not technically but practi\npractically so what we really want to do\nif you're struggling with willpower is\nwe want to use willpower so this is what\nI'd say the right way to do it is to\ntreat willpower like\nsalt in\nfood so if we use a ton of it it's bad\nif we have none of it it's bad we need\njust the right amount of willpower\ndepending on the dish and in general we\nwant to try to use as little as possible\nor we're going to need some that's the\nright way to think about willpower\nand even if we look at this post we can\nsee this play\nout oh look at what happened so at the\nvery beginning they feel excited right\nso this is excitement this is not\nwillpower it's not like they were\nstruggling every day some amount of\nwillpower and some amount of excitement\nbut the problem is that emotions\nacclimatize they return to\nhomeostasis and now begin feeling very\nlethargic I have no energy negative\nfeelings now the the amydala is\nactivating it's a sense of dread and the\nurge to procrastinate we see all of\nthese other things kicking in we also\nsee habit circuitry kicking in\nhere and so this person used excitement\nand some amount of willpower and then\nthat runs\nout and then we're back to square one so\nwhat we really want to do is sublimate\nour desires so this is what a yogi\ndoes so Yogi says okay I have a desire\nfor this thing it's not about power to\novercome the desire it is let me tackle\nthe desire itself it's not about\nactually like resisting In This Moment\nlet me try to unplug the\ndesire and so we have a whole guide\nabout ADHD and doing stuff why did we\nmake this guide and why is it called\nADHD and doing stuff is because I was\nlooking at I was trying to figure out\nokay how do I help people do things\nsimple let us understand how a human\nbeing acts and let us teach other people\nlet's lay out how the brain works when\nit comes to motivation and action and\nlet's teach them the principles once you\nunderstand the principles there are\nexercises that you can do which gets\neverything and we're kind of laying\neverything out right because now the\nnext question is okay Dr K this is\nwillpower but how do you do those four\nthings how do you sublimate desire how\ndo you regulate emotions how do you\ncontrol your habits how do you find your\ninternal motivation those are all\nconversations that have their own\nlecture meditation is one thing that\nworks right but the question here is\nlet's understand willpower is it a\nrechargeable resource is it a muscle the\nanswer is it's both and if you really\nwant to live a free\nlife what you need to do is understand\nthat willpower is only\nneeded when your instrument has friction\nwhen you want to move in the wrong\ndirection that's when we need willpower\nso the real solution to this answer is\nto stop wanting to move in the wrong\ndirection in the first place let go of\nof your ambition replace it with Dharma\npractice emotional regulation techniques\nor digest the source of your emotions\nwhere do these emotions stem from why am\nI feeling so\nnegative notice your Vasa your Habit in\nthe mind learn how to rewire that habit\nthat's that's rewiring\nvasanas right so we've talked about each\nof these things and this is where I wish\nI could do I mean if you guys want to we\ncan do a whole two hours on this alone\nactually we're going going to do that on\nthe discipline section later in this\nmonth but this is how to understand\nwillpower is that is something that\nshould be used as a last resort or\nsprinkled in throughout the day and then\nif you work on the other four dimensions\nof behavior then you won't need\nwillpower\nokay see this is a last thing I'll\nsay a lot of people live very high\nfriction lives and what do I mean by\nthat that means that they rely on their\nwillpower to overcome the other parts of\nthemselves this is a battle you can win\nbut it is a war you will\nlose because one day your willpower\nwon't be there you'll run out eventually\nso even if we look at the clinical\nscience of overcoming addiction we know\nthat will pass power does not work long\nterm the real way to conquer an\naddiction is to work on the other things\nto really help people understand what is\nthe consequence of this thing and then\npeople stop wanting it we can change\nwhat you want and if we change what you\nwant then your life becomes very easy\nbecause imagine you could program your\nwants you can go into the source code\nand change what you want then life\nbecomes easy because then there's a\nnatural motivation to move in that\ndirection\nsee effortless self-control is in order\nto make self-control\neffortless what we need is for very\nlittle control to be exerted does that\nmake sense the more control I have to\nexert the more effort it's going to\ntake it's\ncrazy\nokay all\nright let's move\non actually let's do this do you all\nhave questions about\nthis is we're going to move on to\nanother\ntopic okay what a great question what if\nI want to do\nnothing let's understand this no one\nwants to do nothing this is a incorrect\ndiagnosis of the problem it it is\nimpossible for human beings to want to\ndo\nnothing and you may say but Dr K I wake\nup and I don't feel like doing anything\nhow do you spend your day do you just\nliterally sit there and stay in bed\nsometimes the answer is yes but usually\nit's no so let's understand even if you\nsit and and lay in bed all day that's\nwhat you want to\ndo right so let's say I get up and I go\nto the bathroom and then once I get up\nfrom the\nbathroom then where do I go I go back\ninto bed why do I go back into bed\nbecause I want to be in\nbed so the first thing to understand is\nthat when people say they want to do\nnothing they don't want to do nothing\nthey want to do very specific things\nthat are not something I want to play\nvideo games I want to stay in bed I want\nto get high I want to drink I want to\nsleep I want to be alone I want to not\nsee anyone these are all\nwants so the first mistake that we make\nif you do nothing is you have to realize\nthat you have very powerful wants it's\nnot that you have an absence of desire\nin fact what you have is desire that is\nway too strong because you have a very\nstrong desire to not see another human\nbeing you have a very strong desire to\nprocrastinate how do you know you have a\nstrong desire to procrastinate because\nif you try to do work your mind will\ntell you I don't want to do\nthis so how do we fix this problem\nthere are a couple of things to\ndo the first is to realize that it isn't\nthat you don't want something it is that\nyou are too much of a victim to your\nwants your wants control you you don't\ncontrol them and this is why people try\nto find motivation so this is where like\nthey make a very very very simple\nmistake which is that everyone says how\ndo I find motivation in life that's not\na solution that's actually a problem let\nme explain\nwhy see if I a slave to my wants my only\nsuccess in life is if I happen to have\nthe right\nwants if I want to work out then I win\nif I want to eat healthy then I win if I\nwant to be have so much money if I want\nmoney more than I want pleasure then I\nwin so what we try to do is we try to\ncreate particular\nwants we try to craft wants that move us\nin the right direction but we are still\na slave to our wants we're not actually\nconquering our desires we are just\nhoping that my desire is in the right\ndirection and this is actually what\nhappens to\npeople right because their their desires\none day they wake up and they're like oh\nthank God I want to work out today thank\nGod oh my God how do how can I be this\nmotivated every single\nday but the problem is that this isn't\nsustainable because this motivation will\ndisappear over time because today you\nwake up motivated tomorrow you're not\ngoing to wake up motivated this is why\ngym memberships are so popular the first\nweek of January because I wake up and I\nwant to do this so I'm going to do\nit so if you guys really want to conquer\nthis I'll give you all a really\ninteresting technique so what we want to\ndo is be free from desire entirely and\nwe think that conquering\ndesire means conquering our bad\ndesires I I'm going to force myself to\neat a salad even when I want to eat a a\nsandwich let's\nsay right I'm going to force myself to\nwork out even though I feel like sitting\non my ass the cool thing about\nconquering desires is you can conquer it\nboth ways so one really interesting\nexercise that I'll give to people is\nthink about something you're motivated\ntowards that's positive and then\nrestrain that by\n50% oh my God I feel so excited today\nI'm going to do eight hours of work\ndon't do eight hours of work do four\nhours of work do less l oh my God I want\nto eat so healthy I'm going to go to the\ngrocery store and I'm going to buy a\nbunch of healthy food because I'm\nmotivated to eat healthy don't buy a\nbunch of healthy food cut it in\n50% even the positive things in your\nlife do less of them I know super\ncrazy yes absolutely because the whole\npoint is that we do not want you doing\nthe positive things in your life because\nyou wake up one day and you feel like\ndoing it that's the wrong Compass\nbecause that means that if you wake up\ntomorrow and you don't feel like doing\nit you're not going to do\nit the whole point is to get control of\nthe compass not hope and pray that it's\nin pointing in the right direction one\nday and pointing the wrong direction the\nother day this is why people one step\nforward one step back see a lot of\npeople who are stuck in life if you are\nstuck in life this is probably the\nproblem the only problem and you say I\nmake some progress and then my progress\nSlips Away I make some progress and the\nprogress Slips Away the reason that that\nhappens is because you are a slave to\nyourself and if you want the right thing\non one day you'll do it if you don't\nwant the right thing the next day you\nwon't do it this is the problem is to\ngain control of yourself and it's so\nhard to overcome my desire for something\ndop and energic it is easier to overcome\nmy desire for something positive but we\nnever practice that so we're never\nfighting against a level one mob we're\nalways fighting against the level 10 mob\nan addiction I need to overcome my\naddiction\nno one is talking about overcoming\nlittle things or even things that are\nquote unquote good for\nyou setting a Target and sticking to it\neven when you feel like doing more today\nI'm going to go to the gym for 45\nminutes at the 45 minute Mark I don't\nfeel like I want to do more but I'm\ngoing to restrain\nmyself see do you ever restrain yourself\nwhen you're moving in the right\ndirection of course\nnot you're only restraining yourself\nwhen you're moving in the wrong\nDirection so you're not practicing\nrestraint and that's very hard this is\nwhat we call the rubber band\nmechanic okay in gaming we have this\nidea of a rubber band mechanic which is\nhow like things like games like l or\nDOTA whatever they'll have a rubber band\nmechanic so that things don't snowball\nbut we have this in real life too the\nrubber band mechanic in real life is I\nrun really really really far in a\npositive direction and then I snap back\nso imagine that there is a tree and\nthere is a rubber band tied between you\nin the tree and the further you run away\nfrom the tree the the more elasticity\nincreases in the rubber band the harder\nyou snap\nback right so how do you get away from\nthe tree you have to take off the rubber\nband that's the way to do it you have to\nsublimate the\ndesire start\nacting outside of your\ndesire so do something for the sake of\ndoing it not because it gives you some\nbenefit and this is where our whole\nsociety will say I don't want to do that\nI should have a reason why why I do\nsomething I'm studying because I want an\na I'm exercising because I want to be\nsexy no one is acting for the sake of\naction and then what happens the moment\nthat you stop acting for the sake of\naction you make yourself a slave to your\ndesire and then you just hope that your\ndesire moves in the right\ndirection so do something completely\nworthless the more worthless things you\ndo the more of truly nothing that you do\nthe better you will be in life\nI'll give you all just a simple\nexample I am going to empty this cup of\npens and then I'm going to put them\nin that's what I'm going to do we're\ngoing to do it again one at a time let's\ngo and then you will say to me but Dr K\nthat's a complete waste of energy you're\nnot accomplish anything that's the\n[ __ ] point I am am removing\naccomplishment from\naction and then you are in full control\nsee if you do if you have the ability to\ndo something that is completely\nworthless you will that's everything\nbecause there's no benefit there's no\ndopamine there's no serotonin there's no\nambition but there is freedom there is\ncontrol do worthless things absolutely\nright so one of our favorite practices\nvery difficult stare at a wall a blank\nwall for an hour you can blink just sit\nin front of a wall do a whole lot of\nnothing see everyone's like oh my God\nit's so hard to meditate so hard to you\ndon't have to do anything just sit in\nfront of a wall waste your time\nintentionally every day set some amount\nof 30 minutes of time that you're not\ngoing to do anything there's no point in\ndoing any of this\nstuff and then what will your mind say\noh my God we need to be efficient oh my\nGod I could be having fun and then the\nmind will go in a thousand different\ndirections it'll try to get you to act\nbut who's in charge you or the Mind\nit'll trick you so easily it'll it'll\nlure you in oh my God you could be\naccomplishing so\nmuch oh my God you could be having so\nmuch fun I don't like this I'm\n[Music]\nbored right it's like a dog that's\nrunning in circles and wants to do\nsomething anything anything anything\nanything but just this because it\ndoesn't like the leash all you're doing\nis just holding it like a leash\nanywhere it goes I don't give a [ __ ] you\nwant to go outside you want to eat food\nwhatever it doesn't matter you're going\nto hold the leash you don't have to do\nit for an hour every day that's quite\nintense I would start with 30 minutes do\n30 minutes of nothing just sit on your\nass you'll be\namazed\nseparate motivation from action if you\nseparate motivation from action you'll\nbe in complete control of your\nlife to act because you decide to to not\nbecause something in here tells you\nto that feels like using willpower oh it\nis that will require a lot of\nwillpower that's absolutely going to use\nwillpower right because there's a\nthousand different things that are\nmoving in different directions but you\nare going to restrain them and then over\ntime as you do not gratify these desires\nthey will start to shrink\nright because that which we give into in\nthe mind will\ngrow if I have a beer after work today\nat happy hour next week I'll do it again\nnext week I'll do it again and then over\ntime it'll be twice a week three times a\nweek four times a week if I play one if\nI play one round of whatever my video\ngame of choice is then I'll want to do\nit again and I'll want to do it again\nand I'll want to do it\nagain see anything that we feed in the\nmind grows and then it becomes more\npowerful if you give into symptoms of\nOCD the OCD will\nworsen okay so now someone is saying but\nwhat does it mean for these things to be\nright or positive things if I'm not\nsupposed to want them my whole point is\nsee if you're someone who does things\nthat are positive you're still screwed\nI'll tell you why see everyone is like\nokay it's okay to we should not do\nthings that are negative but it's okay\nto do things that are positive it's and\nthere it is practically but let me give\nyou all just an interesting yogic\nperspective on\nthis so who determines what's\npositive see if you're someone who only\ndoes positive things I don't know if\nyou've ever paid attention to your mind\noh yeah like it's\nokay to do this today that's all right\nthen your mind will try to convince you\nthat it's positive your mind will say\nand that's how it even tricks you the\nmost because it'll tell you oh my God\nthis is good for you oh yeah like eating\na burger every once in a while is good\nfor me that's why I should do it but\nreally what does it want it wants the\nburger so you have to be very careful\nabout doing positive things because now\nall your mind has to do or someone else\nif they want to manipulate you just have\nto convince you that this is good to\ndo it makes you a good friend you become\na good person to give me your\nmoney you become a good son or\ndaughter to always do what I ask you to\ndo it's a good\nthing oh yeah blessed are the poor for\nthey shall be rewarded in heaven let me\nlet me have all your\nmoney right do the good thing be\nrighteous give me that give me that\nmoney give me that money it's okay\nyou'll be a good good human being look\nat look at how much of a saint you\nare so you have to be very careful\ncareful about doing good things so start\nby just doing\nnothing way\neasier so how does this relate to making\nchoices what a great\nquestion conversation I think for a\ndifferent day that's its whole\nconversation is daydreaming for an hour\nequal to staring at a wall not usually\nbecause daydreaming is giving into the\nmind so daydreaming is a mental activity\nit's not doing nothing it is getting\nlost in your\nthoughts okay all right we've got other\ntopics let's move\non\nokay\no\nokay\num how do you gain confidence if there\nis nothing to be confident about don't\nhave much confidence or self-esteem I\ntend to just drink eat junk and play\nvideo games when things seem a bit shite\nain't it always like that am I right\nI've never had confidence even when I\nwas younger but as a youngster I always\nhad the illusion that things could get\nbetter in the future I hoped I would\nglow up and be taller did not happen I'm\nabout 55 and mid AF in the facial\nDepartment my mom says I'm rather\ngood-look and have a wide frame and to\nbe happy about myself but everyone's mom\nsays things to make their kids feel\nbetter so I don't really pay too much\nmind to it my personality in way of\nbeing is [ __ ] too I want to change for\nthe better and live a normal life but I\njust don't see how that could happen\nanyone else in a similar\nboat how do you gain confidence if there\nis nothing to be confident about right\nyou're just drinking eating junk food\nplaying video\ngames\nso let us first start to understand what\nconfidence\nis okay so this person may be talking\nabout\nself-esteem so confidence\nis generally speaking the ability to\nface\nuncertainty so let's look at someone who\nis not confident versus someone who is\nconfident so when I am not confident\nwhat do I need in order to move forward\nI need guarantees I need assurances I\nneed to be sure that this will work\nbecause I don't have faith in myself\nwhat if it doesn't work out then what I\nneed to protect against circumstances\nbecause I cannot rely on\nmyself so as an example confident people\nwill say just put yourself out\nthere and then people who are not\nconfident are like that doesn't work and\nthen The Confident people are like yeah\nit does just do it and that's because\nthese two people are living different\nlives in one case you have a human being\nwho just when you put yourself out there\nif if the world is a huge question mark\nthe question is is a question Mar\ndangerous or is it manageable people who\nare confident say that the question mark\nis okay it is manageable that's why they\ncan put themselves out there but if the\nquestion mark is dangerous does not end\nwell then we can't just put ourselves\nout there it is utter idiocy to put\nyourself out there so these two people\nare living in different\nworlds does that make\nsense so now the question becomes how\ndoes a confident person live in this\nworld and a notc confident person lives\nin this\nworld and this is where we can look at U\nuh studies right so we can look at\nstudies on things like adverse childhood\nexperiences so there's a really\ninteresting take on trauma okay which we\nhave a guide coming out on in a couple\nmonths it's in\npost-production so when we first\ndiscovered trauma we thought that really\nbad things had to happen to traumatic\npeople so we had people who came back\nfrom war World War I veterans had this\nproblem called shell\nshocked and what did doctors think at\nthe time they thought that literally\nthis person has difficulty functioning\nin society they have nightmares they\ncan't hold down jobs they get angry very\neasily they get fearful very easily they\njust seem to be [ __ ] up in some way\nbluntly and what did the doctors\nconclude they seem to be so [ __ ] up in\nso many different dimensions They\nconcluded that this person literally has\nshell shock what does that mean even\nthough their body part was not blown off\nan explosion happened near\nthem that the vibrations of the\nexplosion caused brain damage and caused\nsuch uniform brain damage caused\nproblems with their physiology caused\nproblems with their sleep caused\nproblems with their emotions caused\nproblems with their identity these\npeople became suicidal their mood tanked\ntheir relationships got screwed up this\nis a [ __ ] up human being and so it\nmust be brain damage because the whole\nperson is [ __ ] up this was PTSD\nversion\n1.0\nthen what happened is we discovered that\nthese people sometimes did not have a\nshell shock even near them they didn't\nhave a physiologic cause so I'm watching\nthrough binoculars and my friend is is\non a patrol and then they get blown up\nthere's no physiologic change right I'm\nnot actually getting hit by a shell or\nthere's not even a Shell near me and\nthis person has this symptom then we\ndiscovered PTSD so it's not a\nphysiologic cost and then something\nreally cool happened once we had the\ndiagnosis of PTSD clinicians started to\nrealize there are people who have never\nbeen in war never been in concentration\ncamps never been PS who also exhibit\nthese\ncircumstances and then we discovered ah\nthis is physical abuse at home or sexual\nabuse at home\nokay and then something really\ninteresting happened we noticed that\nthere were people who had no physical or\nsexual abuse at home and they still\nexhibited these symptoms what on Earth\nis\nthis now we discovered things like\nemotional abuse narcissistic parenting\nand what we concl ined is there things\ncalled adverse childhood experiences\nAces 60% of the population has one\nace the more Aces you have the more\nlikely you are to have difficulties with\nyour physiology difficulties with sleep\ndifficulties regulating your emotions\nfeeling too much negativity using\naddictive behaviors to compensate for\nyour negative emotions a poor sense of\nidentity and even difficulty with\nrelationships difficulty with being\nbeing able to work procrastinating a lot\nall these problems stem from\nAsis so how does one person become\nconfident and another person become not\nconfident and generally speaking a a\nfair way to put it this isn't\ntechnically 100% true because let's\nunderstand that real\nquick so I want you to imagine a world\nwhere you have two parents at home who\nlove you and love each\nother the world becomes a safe place\nbecause you can count on something you\ncan rely on something you can trust\npeople you can trust the world because\neven when something bad happens in the\nworld parents are there to pick you\nup now let's say that you have parents\nwho are not there to pick you up\nSuddenly the world becomes a dangerous\nplace I can't trust because if I go out\nand something bad happens no one is\nthere to pick me up so no one is there\nto heal the damage caused by the world\nsee when you have no healing capability\nwhich is usually provided by parents\nthen you have to be careful about damage\nright I want yall to imagine video games\nif there let's take your favorite game\nthat has some kind of healing capability\nstop using healing in the video game how\ndo you play the game you can't ever\nfight holy crap right suddenly we have\nto do one hit\nruns zero one HP run you have to play\nLife perfectly otherwise you're going to\nwipe and the good thing in a video game\nis we can wipe a thousand times and we\ncan respawn in life it ain't like that\neach time we take damage there's no\nhealing so what happens you have to be\nunconfident you can't trust the outside\nworld no more Estus well said zero Estus\nrun imagine how much more skill it takes\nat life to do a zero estos run so\ndifficult so then the question becomes\nwhat do we do if we have no confidence\nin life and this is what's really cool\nthis is what we discovered from trauma\nresearch and all kinds of other\nthings is that thankfully the world that\nyou live in is not the world that you\nlive\nin the world that you perceive is not\nthe real world it is a biased world so\nlet me give youall a simple\nexample this is what we see why do\npeople not have confident confidence\nokay so if we look at these\nstatements what does this person mind\njump to so my mom says I'm rather\ngood-looking and have a wide frame but\neveryone's mom says that so this is a\nkey thing to understand if you lack\nconfidence in life there is one thing\nthat you can change it is doesn't\nrequire willpower I'm going to show you\nall a\nsecret it's not willpower it's not\neffort it's not just doing it in fact\nyou have to do absolutely nothing you\nhave to take zero\nrisk that is to be critical of your\nperception\nthis is the biggest problem that people\ndo not get with a lack of\nconfidence so when something if you look\nat someone who lacks confidence when\nthey get positive\nfeedback their mind discounts\nit and when they get negative\nfeedback their mind amplifies it you are\nyou your mind becomes a a propaganda\nmachine which amplifies the negative and\ndecreases the positive so you take your\nfavorite\npolitical like News Network or\ncommentator or whatever and you look at\ntheir cognitive biases right someone you\nagree with or don't agree with probably\nsomeone that you don't agree with\nbecause it's easier to see cognitive\nbiases and what you'll see is all these\npeople will conveniently ignore anything\nthat doesn't agree with them this is\nwhat your mind\ndoes all it sees all it sees is the\nnegative because I don't know how to say\nthis but like literally the world is the\nsame place for both of y'all\nright and then your mind will say no it\nisn't because pretty people have this\nand this and this and this and I'm an\nugly\nperson well what about all the ways in\nwhich it is the same gravity is the same\nthe sun you have the same amount of time\nyou have the same amount of daylight you\nhave the same amount of nighttime you\nall [ __ ] the same way 99% of your DNA is\nidentical right the majority of the\nworld is actually the same for all human\nbeings cars run the same way physics\nruns the same way biochemistry runs the\nsame way the majority of the world is\nthe same but that's not what you see\nwhat you see is the parts that are\ndifferent and do you see the parts that\nyou're advantageous at of course not you\ndowngrade those you remove those you\ntake the positive data points and if you\nare not careful you will use your\nperception to filter them\nout this is a huge problem this is the\ncore of a problem with people with\nconfidence and I say this as a clinician\nwho has worked with these\npeople and so we even have data around\nthis right so the number of automatic\nthoughts that you can change an\nautomatic thought is your mind's\ninstinctive reaction to something which\nyou think is logical but it's not\nlogical if it happened right away it's\nnot like you're does that kind of make\nsense if your if your mind just jumps\nout with a thought which you think is\ncorrect how long did you stop and think\nabout that you say Oh I thought about it\nin the past but you didn't\nreally most of your thoughts are shaped\nwithout your knowledge it's not like you\nsat there for 5 years and developed a\nvery critical way of thinking about the\nway that you view the world that's not\nhow it happens the real tricky thing in\nthe brain is that we think that's what\nhappens but that's not what happens So\nDaniel Conan did a lot of cool research\non this where human beings think that\nmost of their thinking is logical\nwhereas just it's\nnot so we've stopped being critical of\nour perception so if you lack confidence\nand there's a really good there studies\non this for example with imposter\nsyndrome so what we see in imposter\nsyndrome it's a great test case because\nthis is a case where your\nperformance is roughly equivalent to\nyour colleagues because y'all are both\nin the same place so I saw a ton of\nimposter syndrome at places like Harvard\nMedical\nSchool and literally both people got\naccepted so they're like they both\ndeserve to be there from an objective\nstandpoint it's actually like completely\nacceptable that you're there\nbut the whole point is the person does\nnot see it that way so I'll give you all\njust one example of how we can change\nthinking in impostor syndrome which\nchanges thinking which eliminates The\nImposter\nsyndrome anytime you do something well\nif you are an impostor you attribute it\nto circumstances the reason I got an A\nis because I got lucky because the\nprofessor likes me because this because\nthis it's never your own\neffort and if someone else does\nsomething well it's because of their\neffort it's never luck\nthis person worked so hard oh yeah their\ndad is the dean I'm going to\nconveniently ignore that\nfact anytime you do something poorly if\nyou have an imposter syndrome it is your\nfault anytime someone else does\nsomething poorly it's circumstances oh\nman they were going through a breakup\npoor them it's so hard oh my God I'm\ngoing through a breakup I should be\nbetter at life I should be more in\ncontrol of my emotions I should be less\nof a [ __ ] I should be able to handle\nthis\nso it is the perception of your mind\nthat leads to a lack of\nconfidence it's not any real thing it's\njust your\nmind literally you can look at research\non Daniel Conan you can look at research\non cognitive biases and depression you\ncan look at research on imposter\nsyndrome we create our lack of\nconfidence in our\nmind and then our mind tells us this is\nfactually correct whereas it's not\nso what to\ndo if you are someone who lacks\nconfidence you don't even have to change\nanything all I want you to do is look at\nthe positive things in your life and\nwatch how your mind attaches a butt at\nthe end this is all you need to do you\ndon't even need to fix\nit notice that when there is something\ngood there's a butt and then look at the\nnegative things in your mind and notice\nthere is no\nbutt right so I'll give you a simple\nexample let's look at this\nthis so\ntextbook I'm rather\ngood-looking\nbut right so he doesn't say I tend to\ndrink eat junk and play video games but\nI a very good person but I'm able to\nhold a stable job but I'm able to do\nXYZ right even when I was younger I I\nhad the illusion that I was a Youngster\nand that things would get better sorry I\nI when I was younger I had the illusion\nthat things would get better but it\nturns out that things did get better no\none says that there's no butt with the\nnegative and there's always a butt with\nthe positive this is all you need to\nsee right my personality and way of\nbeing is [ __ ] too\nbut I'm interested in becoming better\nand the one thing that I have going for\nme is that even when my life is crap I\nask for help and I want to get better no\none says\nthat ah I want to change for the better\nand live a normal life oh my God what a\npositive statement what do yall think is\ncoming\nnext shocking let's look let's do a test\nchat let's search for but and what do\ny'all think is before this a negative\nstatement or a positive statement holy\n[ __ ] there are two cases of this in this\npost and are they preceded by positivity\nor they preceded by negativity I'm\nrather good-looking I want to change for\nthe better this is\nit how many negative statements do they\nhave there's no butt after that that's\nit\nsimple and by the way it's not like I\nlooked at that post and engineered all\nthis crap and I measured it before I'm\njust pointing out this is how the mind\nworks when you lack confidence you will\nadd a butt to all of the positive and\nyou will let the negative filter through\nwithout any\nproblem and then that shapes your view\nof the world and of course you're going\nto have\nconfidence\nsimple how do you gain\nconfidence very easy not easy hard but\nsimple the way to gain confidence if you\nlack confidence is to stop sabotaging\nyour confidence that's it you don't need\nto gain confidence you just need to stop\n[ __ ] it\nup it'll grow on its own because the\nworld is a place where human beings are\nnaturally confident you may say what the\n[ __ ] Dr K are you serious about that yes\nyou take a\n2-year-old they're\nconfident lack of confidence is learned\ninsecurity is learned you take a\ntwo-year-old they're happy they become\nthree they're happy four five 6 7 8 n\neven niney olds will naturally be\nhappy insecurity and lack of confidence\nare learned conditioned and taught they\nare not\nnatural\nso all you have to do is stop the\nperceptual\nbias right if you guys want more info on\nthat i' strongly recommend y'all look\ninto the the yogic discipline of\nprahara see we're all about logic we're\nall about emotions but we're not about\nperception no one says the way that I\nperceive the world is wrong everyone\nwill use logic they'll say oh like\nanalytically this is right this is wrong\nyou everyone will engage in logical\narguments but what are the axioms you're\nstarting from those are based on your\nperception just notice where you put a\nbutt and notice how [ __ ] up it\nis\nokay\nnext\nokay Dr K speaks [ __ ] on this dating\nis just a skill game I lo love Dr K's\nstuff but he has very little experience\ndating and his view just perpetuates the\nmysticism around dating as a whole this\nis not voodoo magic and I hate reading\nstuff like you have to reduce the\nimportance of dating in your life to get\nbetter at it you have to work on\nyourself first get pretty rich jacked\npopular before you ever try to date if\nyou don't love yourself no one else will\nwhat does this even\nmean uh why do [ __ ] up insecure people\nconsistently find Partners we'll get to\nthat imagine saying such confusing\nstatements to someone wanting to get\nbetter at chess poker or sales would you\nsay get smarter to an aspiring chess\nplayer no you play the game and reflect\nand improve upon your strategy tactics\nto get better I get that dating is full\nof traumatic experiences for some people\nand that doesn't change the fact that it\nworks exactly the same way as a strategy\nor tactics game the game of dating\nconsists of Bridging the Gap between\nmeeting someone point a and having sex\nSL relationship with m point B and you\ndoing that as many times as you want\nbetween A and B some intersections\nhappen traffic lights and at each one\nyou get a green light gives you their\nnumber accepts the date kisses you back\na yellow light shows hesitation flakes\non you gives you objections a red light\nclearly rejects you for whatever reason\nhas a boyfriend girlfriend you're not\ntheir\ntype the best strategy has a sufficient\namount of steps so that you don't force\na step forward that is too much given\nhow comfortable someone is with you and\nat the same time has the minimum number\nof steps so that you reduce the amount\nof traffic lights between point A and B\nblah blah blah on one extreme\nimmediately proposing sex is bad on the\nother hand on the other end [ __ ]\naround and hesitating to take things\nforward with this person for months on\nend is equally as bad\ngood tactics also deal with green lights\nand yellow lights accordingly there's\ndefinitely good moves on each one there\nare blunders the best strategy includes\nmeeting sufficient people so that the\nwhole thing works you won't get anywhere\nif you meet only a a couple of potential\nPartners per year and that's how you end\nup losing by not even showing up to the\nfield losing is part of the game no\npoker chess golf soccer player you uh in\nthe world wins all their games that's\njust ridiculous you will probably get\nrejected nine out of 10 times that is\ngood normal batting average while dating\nespecially if you want to date\nstrangers if you're average or even\nbelow average on several aspects you can\nabsolutely play The Dating Game and be\ngood your opinions on this are wrong if\nyou think\notherwise\nokay bait\naccepted okay so let's kind of unpack\nthese so let's deal\nwith the most\ncommon voodoo magic dis mysticism in\ndating and understand why people say\nthat is there any scientific support to\nthis why do people come up with all\nthese truisms and what is dating is it\nreally a game like poker chess or\nwhatever okay let's understand this\nbecause I I don't disagree with this\nperson on on some levels okay so let's\nstart with these mysticism bullshits the\nfirst is you have to reduce the\nimportance of dating in your life to get\nbetter at it now what the hell is that\ncuz people will say oh my God you have\nto like care less about dating to be\ngood at\ndating right that doesn't make any sense\nbecause dating is a skill and if you\nstop caring about poker or chess you're\nnot going to get better at poker or\nchess right wrong so the first thing to\nunderstand is that dating advice does\nnot apply to all people because not all\npeople are the same you can't make a\nuniform set of statements about dating\nso this idea of have dating care stop\ncaring so much about dating have it be\nless important to you why does this work\nfor some\npeople so the first thing to understand\nis that dating is about a\nrelationship so it is an interaction\nbetween two human\nbeings so if we look at what makes a\nsuccessful date or\nrelationship it is being able to send\nand receive\nsignals so the more that you are\nignoring the other person the worse your\ndating life is going to be you may be\nable to find a relationship but it's not\ngoing to be a healthy or happy\nrelationship so now the question becomes\nokay so like I'm I'm starting with an\nassumption that you can logically argue\nagainst if you want that the more that\nthere is a give and take in terms of\nreceiving and sending not even give and\ntake in terms of like money or sex or\nwhatever love what I mean is like\nliterally the process of\ncommunication I'm making I'm stating an\naxiom that the more that there is back\nand forth between you and another human\nbeing the better your relationship will\nbe\nthat if I deaf blind and and completely\nignorant of the other person's\nexperience of a relationship that will\nnot lead to a healthy\nrelationship so why should we stop\ncaring about dating let us look at the\nneuroscience and psychology of caring\nabout dating so when I care a lot about\ndating what happens is I stop being\nempathic I start being in my own head so\nI'll give you a simple example let's say\nI meet someone and we start talking and\nI have all these thoughts does this\nperson like me am I going to be alone\nfor the rest of my life am I wearing the\nright thing should I be sexier is my\nhair okay the more that I'm literally\nand in that moment I want y'all to pay\nattention who are you interacting with\nyou are interacting with yourself am I\nwearing something that is okay that is a\nthought in your head and who answers\nthat question does that person answer\nthe question no you answer it yourself\nthis is what it means to be in your own\nhead you are having a dialogue that is\ninternal and the moment that you start\nhaving a dialogue that is internal and\nyou are interacting with yourself you\nwill be less tuned to the other\nperson as you become less tuned to the\nother person you decrease the Strategic\nimpact of empathy you are shooting\nyourself in the foot strategically and\ntactically by not being in tune with the\nother person this is why we need to stop\ncaring about dating so much right so if\nif we can stop caring then that self\ndialogue will reduce that's why we say\nthat okay so the more you care about\ndating the more you're going to be in\nyour own head the more you're in your\nown head the less you're tuning into to\nthe other person because they're sending\nyou all these signals that everything is\nfine but you're not receiving them\nbecause you're interacting with yourself\nthis is why we stop caring about dating\nor care less about dating this is why we\nhave advice like try to enjoy\nyourself right it's not about dating or\nnot dating just enjoy yourself do the\nbest that you can you're in the presence\nof another human being try to enjoy the\npresence of the other human being what\nare youall doing today we're having ice\ncream let's just have a conversation and\nhave some ice cream don't even think\nabout it as a\ndate okay so as someone is saying stop\nthinking too much the question is how so\nwhat some people have discovered is as\nyou reduce the importance of something\nyou will think about it less so if we\nwant to stop thinking which is really\nthe goal so other way I'd put this is to\nbe present with another human being\nand one of the things that makes it hard\nto be present with another human being\nis is how you're so caught up in the\nimportance of\ndating this is not voodo magic and I\nhate reading stuff like you have to work\non yourself first okay so this one too I\nhave mixed feelings\nabout so why do we say you have to\noh why do we say you have to work on\nyourself first first of all I don't know\nthat that's necessarily true I think\nit's okay to work on yourself\nconcurrently\nbut understand that in dating someone is\npresumably accepting or rejecting\nyou so as you bring problems to the\nrelationship so let's say that I have\nlike you know I'll give you all a simple\nexample so a friend of mine went on a\ndate and the person that they went on a\ndate\nwith was like very very\nlike almost invasive not almost was\ninvasive about ask asking my friend\nabout like their job so my friend runs\nhis own company and then she was asking\nall these questions like where is your\naddress can I Google it like she was\njust so skeptical that he was like\nrunning his own companies like she's\nlike how much money do you make like on\nthe first date she like show me proof\nthat you make that much money and this\nguy was like what the this is completely\ninappropriate so it didn't go back or he\nwas like he went on a couple dates to\nsee if things would get better and then\nhe figured out this person's not for\nhim\nso where is this person coming from so\nshe was kind enough to tell him that you\nknow the last like my last long-term\nrelationship I was in relationship for\nfive or six\nyears my long-term partner basically\nlied to me about having a\ncareer they lied about going into work\nevery day they would just go to their\nparents\nhouse and pretend to work and their\nparents would send them money right\nthey're basically like giving them a\npaycheck so the parents were in on this\nlive and for six years this person lied\nabout having a career but money hit the\nbank account they had joint bank\naccounts and she's like okay so she's\nbeen so betrayed by this we can't really\nblame\nher that she carries this betrayal and\nit creates paranoia and then she asks\noverly invasive questions to deal with\nthe\nparanoia so in this situation as long as\nyou are carrying this stuff around\nyou're going to be sabotaging your\nrelationships so why do we say work on\nyourself\nfirst because the stuff that you bring\ninto a relationship can determine its\nsuccess or its failure so you have to\nwork on yourself see this is a very\ncommon problem that we see a lot in\ndating right where we see a lot of\npeople who say I'm looking for this I'm\nlooking for this I'm looking for this\nI'm looking for this everyone's looking\nfor the perfect partner no one's\ninterested in being the perfect\npartner so what do you think will\ncorrelate with more success in dating\nfinding the perfect partner or being the\nperfect partner\nthere is some degree of balance to this\nright so we should be critical and look\nfor the right thing but I think right\nnow especially with the way that Society\nis\nmoving which by the way we're getting\nworse at dating objectively I think in\nthe history of humanity this is the\nhardest that mating has ever been and\neven birth rates will reflect\nthis right so we have some countries\nthat have a birth rate of like 67 and\nthe first time in humanity in the\nhistory of humanity the human race is\nslow slowing down their rate of\nprocreation up until this point it's\nbeen acceleration all the\nway actually maybe that's technically\nnot true we've been slowing things down\nfor a little while but our survival rate\nhas been increasing so that on balance\nit's been positive right the net\npopulation is increasing across the\nworld it's still it's still going to\nincrease but we're starting to see\nslowing down so I don't think we've\nrealized that objectively in the world\nhuman beings are facing a crisis of\nmating a crisis of dating everyone is\nfeeling it we're seeing it reflected in\nthe birth rates and why is it it's\nbecause of stuff like this it's because\nas our society becomes more narcissistic\nwhich is what social media does suddenly\nI don't need to change I just need to\nfind because this is what happened right\nthe internet came along and said out of\n8 billion people you don't need to\nchange we'll help you find the perfect\nperson and you're great just the way you\nare oh my God body positivity fat phobia\nall this kind of stuff let's accept\neveryone right unconditional love\nunconditional acceptance these are all\ngood things they're the opposite of\nadverse childhood experiences everyone\ngets a participation\ntrophy I'm not saying that any of those\nthings is bad in isolation but I say if\nyou look at the the consequence of\ncombining all of this stuff there's no\nindividual responsibility\nanymore or there's less individual\nresponsibility right and I see this like\nreally nasty stuff where like teachers\nwill try to do things like tell a\nstudent what they are doing is\nunacceptable teachers are getting\n[ __ ] because they're not allowed to\ndiscipline kids if they discipline kids\nmommy and daddy show up Raise Hell the\nkid wins now the kid has the power in\nthe relationship they run over the the\nthe teacher there's a crisis in teaching\ntoo everyone's talking about famine war\nand pestilence that's not what what's\ngoing to destroy our society this is\nwhat's destroying our society narcissism\nis destroying our\nsociety and everyone out there is like I\ndeserve the best are you the best [ __ ]\nno if you don't Des if you can't handle\nme at my worst you don't deserve me at\nmy best but what do you deserve do you\ndeserve someone who's behaving at their\nworst no I deserve something that's\nbehaving at my best this is not even\nthis is not equality this is not\nreciprocity it's a rigged game everyone\nwants a rigged game why because we have\ninfluencers out there who are showing us\nthat a rigged game is possible look I\nhave nothing I treat people like [ __ ]\nand I still find relationship ship they\nglorify\nthis\nwhy do you think it's actually happening\nthat way I don't think the majority of\npeople are actually doing that they may\nthink they're doing it but I haven't\nseen\nthat in the worst cases what you\nliterally have is like people paying\nother\npeople to give the illusion of\nAttraction literally paying them to show\nup and take\npictures so as narcissism\nincreases we stop working on ourselves\nwe start expecting everything from the\nworld because I deserve it right because\nI've been taught that I deserve\neverything in life and I shouldn't have\nto work for\nit and so to counter\nthat we say you have to work on yourself\nfirst I don't know about first I would\nsay\nconcurrently so get pretty rich jacked\npopular before you ever try to date this\none I actually agree with this person\nAlmost 100% so I think a really common\nmistake that we have in the dating world\nright now is that I need to fix myself\nfirst then I will be ready to date I\nneed to accomplish XYZ before I date and\noften times these people are very\nreasonable about it right why do they\nsay this it's because I got rejected\nfrom this person for not having\naccomplished this I don't make $100,000\na year the last three people I've tried\nto date have said if you don't make 100K\nI'm not interested therefore I need to\ndo this first I don't think that's how\nlife\nworks I think if you're getting rejected\nfor something that is like you need to\nget jacked or you need to make money or\nwhatever I think you're actually you\nshould continue trying to date change\nthe people that you're accessing and\nwork on those things so I'll give you\nall a really simple example so I work\nwith some people who are very wealthy\nand very\nsingle and everyone thinks oh if you're\nwealthy and single then dating is easy\nit is but relationships are hard\nhard and you may say what do you mean Dr\nK like if dating is easy doesn't that\nmean relationships are easy oh my god do\nwe or do the two the same thing because\nhere's the problem the moment you become\nsuccessful in life you don't know what\nsomeone is actually looking for are they\nlooking for you or are they looking for\nyour\nsuccess and everyone out there who's\nlike the alpha male right like goo all\nthis stuff then all these women will be\nattracted to you yeah they will be\nattracted to you but what's going to\nhappen if you ever lose your job what\nhappens if you become sick what happens\nif they find someone who makes more\nmoney than you\ndo the basis of a relationship in my\nopinion my\nopinion is a connection between two\nhuman\nbeings that's what makes a healthy\nrelationship and I it's beautiful when\nyou see a connection between two\nhumanties I've also worked with a lot of\npeople who were failures when they met\ntheir\npartner and the whole point is that a\npartner can help them achieve I that's\nmy case for\nsure right I started dating the person\nwho is now my wife when I was young\nworthless 2.5 GPA no money she was\npaying my rent paying my bills I was\nplaying video games all the time the\n[ __ ] definition of a beta\nmale I didn't need to become an alpha\nfirst right I don't even know if I'm an\nalpha male now I I don't\nknow right maybe I I have kids I I have\na career I have a\nhair right I'm gaining MMR in Dota 2 so\nthat's pretty Alpha\nright but that's not what a relationship\nis so if you want to start creating a\nrelationship based on money or these\nkinds of things that's what that's what\nyou're going to select for and that's\nwhat you're going to\nfind so I don't think that you need to\nfix all that stuff first I think you\nshould start dating as best as you can\nand objectively it's hard all right\nokay if you don't love yourself no one\nelse will what does this even mean and\nif this were true why do [ __ ] up\ninsecure people consistently find\nPartners what a great question I love\nthis because this person is making a\npoint but they're asking a question I\nthink it's a rhetorical question so\nlet's answer\nthis so if you don't love yourself no\none else will and why do [ __ ] up\npeople consistently find Partners okay\nso first of all does finding a partner\nmean that someone else loves you\nare these two things equivalent\nabsolutely\nnot what we tend to find is that when\nyou don't love\nyourself you are an unloved person on\nthe inside you are not deserving of Love\nsee this is important to understand the\nway that you feel about yourself is what\nyou will accept for from other\npeople so if I think I'm ugly I will\naccept other people treating me\nugly\nright if I think I'm the best thing\nsince slic bread if I've been taught\nthat oh Alo is the brightest boy best\nboy best my little alok beta is so good\noh my God he's the best on the planet\nwhat will I accept from other people\nthey have to treat me like the best on\nthe planet if I'm raised to be entitled\nand narcissistic that's what I I will\naccept from other people and I will\nreject from other people that I am not\nthe best thing on the\nplanet so you will accept from other\npeople the way that you feel about\nyourself\nokay and so then what happens is you\nhave a group of insecure people who\ndon't love themselves and there's a ton\nof Partners out there who love that oh\nmy God I love being in a relationship\nwith someone who is so has such low\nself-esteem because they tolerate all of\nmy bad behavior people who are abused as\nchildren end up abused in romantic\nrelationships as adults very common ton\nof\ndata because there's a group of n so\nthis is very common the narcissistic\nborderline\npairing narcissist says I'm the best\n[ __ ] you suck borderline feels like I'm\nthe worst [ __ ] you're\namazing they Lo they they can form\nrelationships very\neasily because they're both on the same\npage I'm awesome and you're [ __ ] this is\nhow Dam emotionally damaged people wind\nup in relationships they don't have they\nhave difficulty setting limits for\nthemselves you should stop treating me\nthis way they can't say that because\nthey don't have self-love and so they\nselect for all the people who are\ncomfortable abusing them and they're\ncomfortable being abused it's not\npleasant but it makes\nsense paradoxically when you have no\nself-love and you meet someone who loves\nyou it can be frightening\nwhy because you're waiting for the other\nshoe to drop because often times when\nthese people are abused they grow up\nwith parents who are abusive one day and\napologetic and lovey-dovey the next\nbecause the parent feels\nguilty I'm so sorry let me get you this\ntoy because I was drunk the other\nday this is what\nhappens and so then what happens is\nthese people develop this pattern of\nokay when someone is nice to me\nsomething bad is\ncoming so if you don't develop\nself-love it will be very difficult for\nyou to engage in relationships\nyou are opening yourself up to the\npatterns of abuse if you don't love\nyourself so you should absolutely work\non love self-love now there's a caveat\nto this as well which is that we know\nthat one of the best ways to learn\nselflove is to have love from another\nhuman being so how do children love self\nLov they get it usually from their\nparents\ncaregivers and so even if you lack\nself-love this is where things get\nreally tricky is that one of the best\nways to get self- Lov is to have someone\naccept you and love you the way that you\nare right that happened in my case super\ncool so you can't learn it on your own\nor it's hard to learn on your own you\ncan't can so that's where things get a\nlittle bit\ntricky\nokay now the last thing is Imagine\nsaying such confusing statements to\nsomeone wanting to get better at chess\npoker or\nsales so this is where I think that when\nwe look at really look at relationships\nand dating it's not chess poker or sales\nright so chess has a set of\nrules that are the same for everyone who\nplays it there's a very clear Victory\nand there's a very clear\nloss so let's try to extrapolate that to\nHuman Relationships is there one set of\nrules [ __ ] no that's why dating is so\nhard oh my God as the\nman you're supposed to take\ncharge and you're way too beta because\nyou're not taking charge and you're like\nall right\nfine so then you're like okay I'm going\nto take charge and then the next person\nyou date is like oh my God you're so\nmisogynistic you don't believe in\nequality you're coming on way too strong\nit's no better for\nwomen right for women it's like do you\nwant me to be independent or are you\nthreatened by my here we are saying that\noh I want a woman who's an equal right I\nwant a woman to pay her own way I don't\nwant to be like dependent I don't want a\nwoman to be like dependent on me like\nyou know you should do your share I\nshould do my share but I'm threatened by\nyour success and you make more money\nthan I do so that triggers some kind of\nego thing so I want you to be\nsubservient but I'm a little\nbaby so I I need you to feel make me\nfeel like a\nman but I'm actually a\nchild that's the problem is there is no\nuniform set of\nrules if it's not like chess or poker\narguably sales is closer because that's\nmore of a\nrelationship so there's a human being\ninvolved right it's a co-op game so\nchess and poker are PVP games so I think\nthat these are like apples and oranges\nthat being said there are certainly some\nstrategy and tactics that you can use in\ndating right I don't think it's like\nquite as cut and dry as this person says\ngreen light yellow light red light we'll\nget to that in a\nsecond but I think the whole point of a\nrelationship is that you are making up\nthe game with another human being as you\ngo along and the rules of that game\nchange and evolve the goal of a\nrelationship is for both of you to win\nit's Co-op not PVP even when it comes to\nsales all three of those relationships\nthat this person described are somewhat\nPVP even in\nsales the more I can get your dumbass to\npay for something the more I I win and\nyou lose it's not really a win-win\nsituation sometimes it is a win-win\nsituation but sometimes it's a win- lose\nsituation and that's not ideally how a\nrelationship should\nbe so I think the problem is that you\ncan't there's not one set of rules for\nthe game because the people are\ndifferent and you have to navigate it\nwith someone it's almost like it's more\nlike D and D than I think anything else\nwhere we're like kind of working\ntogether it's like a DM and a player\nit's like we're sort of against each\nother there's some amount of push pull\nbut the goal is actually to create\nsomething together so I think the best\nanalogy for relationships from from a\nanalogy perspective is Dungeons and\nDragons I control the bad guy you\ncontrol the good guy but the whole point\nis that we are working together to make\nsomething and sometimes there's an\nantagonism between us and sometimes\nthere's cooperation between\nus that being said I do think that there\nare some skills or tactics or strategy\nor whatever that this person is breaking\napart which I think are\nreasonable right so the more people you\nmeet the better off you'll be\nbut I don't know if this makes sense but\nlike you know there are some of these\nstatements that I don't agree with so I\nthink most of the people that I know who\nare in successful relationships did do\nnot get rejected 90% of the\ntime most of the people that I know that\nare in successful\nrelationships basically have like\na pretty high success rate they're able\nto get in into a relationship like I\nwould say 30 to 60% of the\ntime right and I think part of the\nreason that that you end up rejected\nnine out of 10 times is because you kind\nof treat things as a game there's no\nlike Humanity towards another person in\nthis right if I just start asking people\nout like sure maybe I'll get n out of 10\nrejections but honestly like in in my\nexperience like most people who like you\nknow work on themselves and do this kind\nof stuff they don't actually have 90%\nfail rates it's the people who are just\nchain asking people out who have 90%\nfail\nrates this is where like some amount of\nempathy and sort of gauging whether this\nperson is into\nyou right having something organic\ndevelop a lot of people that I know are\nfriends\nfirst right it's it's actually like it's\ncrazy like some people are pretty good\nat\nthis and once you understand like how to\ninteract with another person once you\nunderstand that this is it's it's not\nlike success or failure it's like let's\nsee if this works are we\ninterested but overall I think it's a\nit's a great perspective I do think that\nsome things can be worked on the last\nthing that I'll say with a lot of this\ndating is a game\nstuff see there's a huge cognitive bias\nhere which is that we human beings love\ntaking complex things and simplifying\nthem\nit feels good to us that's why we do it\ndoesn't make it true but it feels good\nbecause it gives us a way to move\nforward see anytime the world is an\noverly complex place we are paralyzed so\nwhat do we do what does the human brain\ndo it reduces complexity to Simplicity\nand gives us a\ncompass if you want to understand how\nthis\nworks on the very scientific and fair\nside you can look at clouds that look\nlike animals clouds don't look like\nanimals but the human brain is capable\nof perceiving animals in clouds we are\ncapable of perceiving pixels on a screen\nas people that's not literally what it\nis you can't even see my face this is\nnot my face this pixels on the\nscreen that give the illusion of a\nface and if you look at things like\nimpressionist painting or abstract art\nthis is what we\nsee\nand in the more you\nknow the less accepting side we can even\nsay that this is where religion came\nfrom because human beings were looking\nat the disorder of the universe and we\nneeded to reduce that complexity to\nSimplicity yeah okay this isn't just\nrandom weather patterns there's a guy\nnamed Zeus who's up there who gives us\nThunder enlightening and it gives us\nactionable information right so now what\nwe're going to do is like we're going to\nstart praying to Zeus and if we pray to\nZeus it'll work out and then thankfully\nour brain is kind of cognitively biased\nso we tend to ignore certain things and\nwe accept certain things so in the times\nwhere we pray and there is no thunder\nand lightning look at that that was my\nprayers and in the times where there was\nthunder and lightning I didn't pray hard\nenough oh wow what a beautiful\ninternally consistent\nsystem right so this is a a a more\nsatirical approach but we sort of see\nthis right I I think that we have to\nacknowledge that some amount of pattern\nrecognition may have influenced our\nbelief of religion I'm not saying that\nreligion is wrong by the way I myself am\nreligious right but just because you're\nreligious doesn't mean that you\nshouldn't you want to conveniently\nignore the biology\nevolutionary perspective psychological\nperspective neuroscientific perspective\nof why human beings may have constructed\nreligion we should understand everything\nright we shouldn't just ignore\ninformation just because it runs against\nour belief that's bad in my\nopinion\nokay all\nright so cool\npost we have time for maybe one\nmore okay we're GNA\npick\nokay\nso we kind of cover this this is perhaps\none of my one of the biggest reasons why\nI hold back at self-improvement so you\nhave improved yourself I sure have will\nshe like you for you or the improved you\noh my\ngoodness so this is a real common\nproblem if you have trouble with\nself-esteem so if you have trouble with\nself-esteem this can be very reasonable\nright we're not saying that you're like\nyou you're dumb like sometimes the\nreason we have troubles with self-esteem\nis because we're not objectively where\nwe want to be in life so I lack\nconfidence because I'm not happy about\nmy body that's that can be an objective\nassessment we're not saying that there's\nsomething wrong with you but we're still\nleft in an interesting pickle which is\nonce I\nimprove who do people like do they like\nthe improved version of myself or do\nthey like the original version of myself\ndo they actually love me or do they love\nwhat what I have\nbecome so if we want to understand how\nto overcome that we have to understand a\ncouple of\nthings the first is that if you are\nworried about this\nquestion that is because on some level\nyou have not been loved enough right see\nwe have to understand this if I'm if I'm\nworried about something if I'm concerned\nabout something that means that I'm not\nat ease with it obviously right and so\nthen the question is how does one become\nat ease with being loved because it has\nto have happened before we have to\nunderstand okay this person accept\naccepts me for who I am that's one thing\nwe'll get to that at the\nend the next thing to understand is if\nyou are worried about whether someone\naccepts you for who you are or the\nperson you've\nbecome this is what we need to\nunderstand the earlier you are in a\nrelationship the more they will accept\nyou for what you appear to be and the\nless they will accept you for who you\nare the later you go a relationship that\ngets\nflipped\nhopefully so let's understand this right\nlet's just say take something like\nappearance so let's say that I have a\nshitty haircut maybe I do today who\nknows and when someone meets me for the\nfirst time they may accept or reject me\nbased on my haircut but as they get to\nknow me what literally happens is our\nbrain\nacclimatizes to certain stimuli those\nbecome normal and then we start to see\nthe person for who they are\nso the whole reason that we work on\nourselves is to give someone a positive\nfirst\nimpression because when they have a\nfirst impression they don't know us they\nonly have what they can see on the\nsurface everyone judges a book by its\ncover but the value of a book gets\ndetermined by what's inside over time\ndoes that make sense very simple at the\nvery beginning I judge a B book by its\ncover then I start to read it and by the\nend of the book I will not judge it by\nits cover as much\nnow in the case of a book most of it is\non the inside and the cover is only the\nfront and the back page whereas 300\npages are on the inside so that's why we\njudge a book primarily at the End by\nwhat's inside it's like 2 to 300 ratio\nof outside to inside with a human being\nit's different it's way closer to 50/50\nat the\nbeginning and so the question of are you\nloved by someone is at the very\nbeginning they're not going to love you\nfor you and if you believe that chances\nare you're screwed up in some way and I\nsay that with love but what I mean by\nthat is like I've literally worked with\npatients who have things like borderline\npersonality disorder or or are in\nrehab and they meet someone and within\nhours they're like oh my god this is my\nsoulmate they see my soul oh my God this\nperson sees me from me they don't see\nthe shell of who I am that's not what\nthey\nsee unless they're like enlightened or\nsomething that's not what they see what\nthey see is a projection\nif you think someone really knows you\nafter 15 minutes unless they're Dr\nk then they don't see you they see what\nthey think you are and you're kind of\nreceiving something it's so it's not\nlegit so at the very beginning everyone\nis going to judge you for what they see\non the outside that's why we craft the\noutside over time they will love you for\nyou\nhopefully so that's where it's not like\nwhich one is it it's a Time sequence at\nthe beginning they they like you for who\nyou appear to be and hopefully over time\nthey appreciate you for who you\nare\nokay so in terms of what to do about\nthat so I'd say craft yourself on the\noutside because that's the world that we\nlive\nin craft yourself to be as acceptable to\nothers as you feel comfortable\ndoing and then over time open yourself\nup up to an empathic connection with\nthis person and pay attention so all you\nneed to do to understand if this person\nloves you for you or loves you for your\nmoney is to pay\nattention\nright how do they demonstrate their love\nis their love contingent on you paying\nfor things if you tell them that you're\ngoing to take them to a date and you go\nto a cheap restaurant do they get\nupset you'll be able to tell if you pay\nattention the thing that makes it hard\nto pay attention\nis\nthis you are in your own head you are\ntalking to yourself if you are talking\nto yourself you're not going to read\ninto this person's\nsignals the other problem is as you have\na lack of confidence your judgment will\nbe\nclouded so you will either interpret\nthings in a positive way or negative way\nso as best as you can get out of your\nhead and pay attention to what they do\nand what they\nsay and this is also where like you know\nI think it's okay for someone to be\nsuper into the improved part of you and\nI think it's even okay to have lopsided\nFinancial situations and things like\nthat but that's where at some point you\nwant to have a\nconversation because a relationship is\nabout a\npartnership ideally it's\ncompliment or usually I mean it doesn't\nhave to be\nbut and so the whole point is that I\nthink it's okay for like in a\npartnership let's say you have kids for\none partner to stay home with the kids\nbecause yall decide that that's what you\nwant and one partner to make the money\nthat's fine it just should just be a\ncollaborative decision and the key thing\nto watch out for is contingent\naffection so if there's this kind of\nattitude of like unless you do XYZ I'm\nnot going to give you ABC\nif it is a transactional relationship\nthat's what you need to be careful\nof so what is their degree of\nacceptance when you are not the improved\nversion the more acceptance of the\nunimproved version there is the more\nauthentic the relationship is going to\nbe okay and now we're going to come full\ncircle\nhow do you get over this feeling I\nreally want to talk to\nyou but I don't want to annoy you this\nis great so everyone's like oh my God\nhow do we overcome this it's very\nsimple if you were\nworried because you want to talk to\nsomeone but you're worried that you are\ngoing to annoy them there's one very\nsimple thing to do\nin both of these\ncases where is your compass it's in here\nI want to talk to you I don't want to\nannoy you the subject of the sentence is\nthe same so I'm worried about annoying\nyou but I want to talk to you in both of\nthese cases I giving into\nmyself so if I choose to talk to you and\nI really want to talk to you I'm letting\nthat desire for communication control my\nactions it's my desire and my\nfulfillment\nI don't want to annoy you is still my\ndesire and my fulfillment you may say\nbut what do you mean Dr K let's\nunderstand this I don't want to annoy\nyou so if I don't talk to you I feel\nlike thank God I'm not annoying this\nperson that's why you're conflicted and\nthat's why there's that's why you're\nstuck right because I want this and I\nwant that I want blue and I want red\nthen you're\nstuck and why is that because that's\nbecause you're listening to yourself you\nrelying on what you want\nhow do you solve this by including\nanother human being oh my God so what's\nmissing in this\nrelationship what does the other person\nwant we have no\nidea in this scenario we have no clue\nthis is a fight we're fighting in here\nand this is why it is unsolvable because\nin a relationship you need another human\nbeing so here is how you do this\npractically I would reach out okay I\nreally want to talk to you hey I'd like\nto catch up\nsometime I really enjoyed hanging out\nlast time or I haven't talked to you in\na while I really missed that let people\nknow where you're coming\nfrom and then you can do something\nreally cool there's actually an OP\nsecret\ntechnique to understand whether you are\nannoying someone or not which is asking\nthem and being tuned to their response\nso sometimes if you ask someone am I\nannoying\nyou that's a tricky question there's a\nright way to ask this because then\nsomeone feels guilty very few people\neven if you are annoying them will say\nyes because they're afraid about your\nfeelings so instead what you can do is\nask an open-ended\nquestion which is how often do you enjoy\nhanging\nout just ask them how often do you enjoy\ntalking\nwhat's the right Cadence for you when\nyou hang out with someone how often do\nyou usually like at what intervals what\nintervals sounds [ __ ] weird but what\nI would say is like how often do you\nenjoy hanging out right so if I'm\nplaying games with someone new I'll ask\nthem how often do you play and then I'll\nask him straight up do you like to solo\nqueue most of the time or play with\npeople do you like to play with people\nat your rank are you okay playing with\npeople below\nrank right so toties is right they're\nsaying someone will be polite so there's\na cool way to bypass politeness which is\nto ask an open ended\nquestion right so there's no polite if\nthere's no\ndirection if I ask someone what's their\nfavorite food there's no room for\npoliteness I mean I suppose there is in\nsome outlier scenario where someone's\nlike oh I have to like the same thing\nyou like otherwise you're going to get\nupset but if that's the situation you're\nand you've got bigger\nproblems so the way to get around polite\nanswer is hey do you want to go out\nsometime hey can we hang out yes or no\nquestion encourages\npoliteness and you know this right\nbecause this is why you're polite all\nthe time people trap you [ __ ] do you\nguys get how trapping being polite\nis people trap you all the time because\nyou're polite and how do they do it hey\ncan I borrow five bucks yes or no\nquestion you want to be polite you're\ntrapped hey hey can you help me move hey\ncan you pick me up from the\nairport and this is really frustrating\nfor my\nrelationship because my wife will ask me\nyes or no questions in which she is\nexpecting a polite\nresponse hey do you want to eat Thai\nfood\ntonight and then I say no because she's\nasking me what I want and me stupid me\nthinks that when my wife asks me what I\nwant I should tell her what I want it's\ntaken me about 20 years of a\nrelationship to realize that's not\nwhat's going\non right so now I'll even ask her when\nyou're asking me if I want Thai food if\nI'm being an [ __ ] about it so I had\nto learn this in a couple of steps so I\nwas like are you asking if I want Thai\nfood or are you telling me you want Thai\nfood and that's a little bit more\ncontentious and now I've learned the\nbest way to do it which is when I have\nthe wherewithal I'll say\nI could eat\nwhatever what do you feel like\neating you guys see different\nways so if you're worried about people\nbeing polite ask open-ended\nquestions right so ask people get\ninformation from the other side because\nyou're not going to figure this out in\nyour by yourself this is what's so\ncrippling is you're like I really want\nto talk to you\nI really don't want to annoy you and\nthen sometimes what we do we make the\nstupid mistake of like letting all of\nour internal crap onto the other person\noh my God I really want to talk to you\nbut I don't want to annoy you am I\nannoying you is this too much am I too\nmuch I'm sorry I've been\ntraumatized it's so hard for me\nsometimes here's all my emotional crap\nlet me like emotionally let me trauma\ndump ready ready are you ready because\nI'm ready I can't wait let me TR it up\nthat's what we do now\nright so instead what you want to do is\nlet the other person enter the\nrelationship gauge them in some way hey\nhow often would you like to hang out so\nI'll give you all one last\nexample of you know I don't want to\nbother this person so once again from my\nlife so I have a friend who is a friend\nof mine and we share many\ninterests and then I will invite them to\nthings and I'll be like hey you want to\ncome watch this tournament because we\nboth like video games and they're like\nnah and then they turned me down two or\nthree times and then I ask them straight\nup do you is it annoying when I ask you\nor do you want me to keep inviting you\nor would you rather I stop so you give\nthem a\nchoice right this is a little bit yes or\nno because I needed that Clarity at some\npoint so I tried the open end and stuff\ndidn't work and then they said no it\ndoesn't annoy me like you can ask ask\nand then I asked one more question do\nyou want me to continue inviting you in\nthe future so you just lay it out for\nthem right it's not like oh my God he's\noffended and do I need to say yes at\nsome point I don't want him to like does\nthis make sense like I don't want him to\ncome out of politeness if he doesn't\nenjoy it because I you know it's not\nit's no skin off of my back whether he\ncomes or not so I just ask him like Hey\nlike how often do you want me to ask you\nright so then we get to the open-ended\nquestion I and then we settled on once a\nyear so once a year the invitation is\nopen again and I will extend\nit hey do you want to join our D andd\ngroup we're thinking about starting a\nnew campaign you want in he's like nah\nI'm like cool I'll be like I'll ask you\nagain next year he's like cool and we're\ngood I think maybe he doesn't like it\nmaybe he thinks I'm annoying who knows\nbut that's also where I'll teach yall\none last\ntrick\nso\nI don't want to annoy you right so\nhere's one crazy trick if you don't want\nto annoy people or you are worried about\nnot wanting to annoy people annoy people\nwhich is really what it is there's one\nfinal trick One op\ntechnique that I will teach\nyou which was learned from all of my\nnarcissistic\npatients if you annoy someone who\nrespons possibility is\nit to know that you are annoying\nsomeone see if you carry all the\nresponsibility here I am wanting to know\nam I annoying you am I not annoying you\nbut there's a basic problem which is I'm\nnot\ntelepathic so I don't know if I'm\nannoying you or not so the last thing to\nunderstand is if you are worried you're\nannoying someone and you make some\ndecent effort to just ask them the other\nproblem is it's their [ __ ] problem if\nyou are annoying in them it is their\nresponsibility to tell\nyou right it is a shared\nresponsibility so I'm not saying that\nyou should be completely oblivious to it\nbecause that's narcissism but I'm also\nnot saying for those of us who are\nsocially anxious we carry all the\nresponsibility we go through life trying\nto be telepathic because we carry all of\nthe responsibility how do I get this\nperson to like me am I too much of a\nfriend am I not enough of a friend\nshould I let them borrow money should I\nnot let them borrow money here we\nare trying to be like a [ __ ] deep\nblue supercomputer AI calculating all\nthese chess moves in the absence of\ntheir input and no wonder we get\nsocially exhausted no wonder the social\nanxiety is so bad and we never get to an\nanswer that's the problem with social\nanxiety is you never end up with an\nanswer that is reassuring you just spin\nyour wheels and get further in the\nmud let them take some\nresponsibility so you do 50% not 51\nmaybe 60 fine but not\n61 they share some of the responsibility\nthey can let you\nknow and if they don't but what if they\ndon't let me know that's then you can't\n[ __ ] be responsible for everyone\nelse's social growth if you go through\nlife assuming that other people have no\nresponsibility for their social\nImprovement right here you are working\non not being annoying and what they need\nto work on is being less polite and\nauthentically communicating with you you\ncan't solve everything in your life for\nthe deficiencies of the people around\nyou but [ __ ] a y'all try and I love\nyou for it but holy [ __ ] stop being so\nstupid here you are trying to correct\nall of the deficiencies of the people\naround you and then you end up lifting\nso\nmuch [ __ ] five heading six heading\nseven heading these social calculations\nbecause you're not willing to let\nsomebody else take responsibility and\nthen you're EX exhausted and the outcome\nsuck because it takes two to lift a\nrelationship and if you're lifting a\nrelationship solo the time is ticking\nyou're going to burn out you can't do it\nforever do it for a little while\nsure so let other people grow some too\nyou do 50% of the work in the\nrelationship or at most\n60% y'all get\nthat so here you are trying to solve an\nunsolvable problem and the worst thing\nis that hinders your success because now\nyou're doing all these mental\ncalculations on their benefit instead of\njust focusing on what you need to focus\non I'm so worried about oh did is my\nwife hungry or not she didn't eat very\nmuch and that's an okay problem to have\nbut then I start worrying about things\nlike world hunger that's impossible to\nsolve so let other people have some of\nthe responsibility in the relationship\nright sometimes when I play with my\nfriends they're like no yeah well we're\nlike we're like so I play DotA they're\nlike yeah we're going to do some\nImmortal ranked q and you're too low MMR\nfine do I feel a little hurt by that the\nfirst time it happened it did but then I\nstarted solo queing and discovered that\nI like that more because I was ranking\nwith my I was playing games with my\nfriends who are way better than me and I\nwas getting dumpstered in every single\ngame I looked recently I have a 32.7%\nwin rate\nbut they're awesome we're still friends\nI think they may be watching this\nhopefully they're\nnot I randomly found the most positive\ngroup of Gamers on the Internet it's\nit's\ngreat right it's\nokay you can let people\nknow and then on the flip side you\nshould also let other people know where\nyou're coming\nfrom\nokay all right\nthat's time for\ntoday I think we are done chat so thank\nyou all so much for coming we have a\nthundra stream tomorrow uh for members\nand then last thing is that if you guys\nreally like these communication stuff in\nthis relationship crap definitely check\nout our book because this is where we\ntry to teach the most\nfundamentals and like start
