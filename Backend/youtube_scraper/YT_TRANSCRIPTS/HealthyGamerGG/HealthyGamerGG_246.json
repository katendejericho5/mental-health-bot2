    "transcript": "the problem is that we' become overly\noutcome focused and the main thing is\nthat we've become unintentionally\noutcome focused we've started to be\ncontrolled by outcomes and this is where\nif you want to be an artist what I would\nrecommend to you is that you don't try\nto become a bestselling artist what you\ntry to do is make the best book and\nthat's a subtle but very important\ndifference so write the best goddamn\nbook you can paradoxically it's the\npeople who worry about becoming\nbest-selling authors that have the\nhardest time becoming best-selling\nauthors and it's the people who don't\ntry to become bestselling authors and\nfocus on writing the best goddamn book\nthat they can that wind up as\nbestselling authors now you may have to\nmake some adjustments and stuff based on\nlike markets and stuff like that so I'm\nnot I'm not saying you're ignoring all\nthat stuff but generally speaking with\nartistic Pursuits the best games are\ngoing to come not out of like formulaic\nunderstanding of things but someone\nwho's like I want to play a game where I\ncan do this"
