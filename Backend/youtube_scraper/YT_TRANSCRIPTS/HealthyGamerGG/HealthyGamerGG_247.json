    "transcript": "you're going to love video games but if\nyou become a gamer right I'm a gamer oh\nthose aren't real games a real gamer\nplays these games that's cringe so the\nmoment that personality becomes identity\nwe've entered the realm of\n[Music]\ncringe I'm shamelessly stealing\ncharacteristics of people I want to be\nlike is it bad analyzing my favorite\ncharacters so I can shamelessly steal\ntheir personalities okay I don't think\nthis is bad so if you look at other\npeople's personality characteristics and\nyou start stealing them I think that's\ngood that's totally fine even if they're\nfictional doesn't matter in order for\nthis to be harmful or helpful we have to\nunderstand the difference between\npersonality and identity so if you\nadopting other people's personality\ncharacteristics and it is not becoming a\npart of your identity then this is great\nif you are confounding the two then we\nhave a problem so now a lot of people\nmay wonder what is the difference\nbetween personality and identity we have\ngood science on this okay so personality\nis who you are and p uh identity is who\nyou think you are and it's fine for you\nto craft yourself into whoever you are\nthat's totally fine but don't pretend\nyou're that I know it's kind of\nconfusing so I'll explain so in science\nin basically psychological research\nwe've defined what personality is and\nwhat personality is is the way that you\ninterpret information the what your\ninternal reaction is followed by what\nyour actions are so if we look at people\nof two different personalities let's say\nI'm I'm going for a hike with my friend\nand we see a bear I get excited because\nI watched this Tik Tok earlier of people\nlike petting bears in the woods and I\nwas like wow what an amazing opportunity\nI want to be one with nature and so I\nwalk towards the bear hoping to pet it\nand my friend starts shading themselves\nso we look at this situation the\nsituation is exactly the same right for\nboth of us we're two people going on a\nhike the circumstances are exactly the\nsame the weather is the same the bear is\nthe same bear is the same size Bears the\nsame color situation is exactly the same\nthe personality determines how I\ninterpret this information how I react\nto it excitement versus fear and how I\nact walk towards it versus walk away so\nyou can take this for any number of\nthings let's say like you go to your\nschool dance and you're 16 years old do\nor you go to a party are you in the\ncorner so we're at a party there I don't\nknow anyone here this is a fact of the\nmatter depending on my personality this\ncan be very exciting I don't know anyone\nhere let's meet new people or this can\nbe very exciting I don't know anyone\nhere no one knows my shitty reputation\ntime to up other people's lives or\nI don't know anyone here I feel very\nawkward I don't know who to talk to I\ndon't know how to start a conversation\nso the circumstances can be exactly the\nsame the way that we interpret that\ninformation the way that we internally\nreact to it and the way that we end up\nacting determines our personality now\nnotice in these scenarios there's no\nsense of I right so when I see this bear\nin the woods I get excited about the\nbear but I don't think to myself I am a\nbear lover I a this I of that this is\nwho I am you don't think about that it\nis the way that you react interpret\ninformation your internal reaction and\nhow you act has nothing have to do with\nyour identity hey Dr K how do I get my\nkid to put down the game without it\nbeing a fight every single time the\nproblem with gaming is that it tricks\nour brain into being a substitute for\nLife once we start to get our\npsychological needs met through the game\nthat's when we become addicted how to\nraise a healthy gamer combines the\nlatest in Neuroscience research along\nwith a decade of clinical practice check\nit out anywhere books are sold so in\nthat way if you look at someone's\npersonality the way that they interpret\ninformation that the way that they\ninternally react and the way that they\nact in a circumstance by all means adopt\nsomeone else's personality this is\nactually healthy in some ways right so\nwhen you have figures that you're\ninspired by like parents there are times\nin your life where if you're lucky and\nyou've got a good set of parents you\nwill adopt their personality\ncharacteristics because your parents\nwill help you do that that's literally\ntheir job so you'll have a setback in\nlife you you asked your crush out and\nthey said no and then you feel\ndevastated your interpretation of them\nsaying no or they don't even say no they\nsay I'm not looking to date right now\nwhich you view is a 100% rejection\nthat's just something they're telling\nyou to spare your feelings but you know\nthat deep down they don't want anything\nto do with you ignore what they said\nbecause they're liars and then you\ninternally react that's your internal\nreaction and then you act I'm never\ngoing to ask anyone out again so your\nparent comes along and tries to shape\nyour personality let's reinterpret the\ninformation what did they actually say\noh they said they're not looking to date\nright now how do you know that they\ndon't like you now I want I want to ask\nyou a question I'm just curious let's\nsay that they did like you but that\nthey're life is chaotic what would they\nsay to you if they really liked you but\ncould not date you huh interesting they\nmay not say no they may say I can't date\nright now or I'm not looking to date\nright now oh interesting so there's a\ndifferent interpretation that could be\ntrue true so change your interpretation\nwhat's your internal reaction so you\nstart to get very upset let's learn some\nemotional regulation techniques let's go\nfor a walk let's talk about life right\nso change your internal reaction observe\nyour internal reaction and then change\nyour action I'm never going to ask\nanyone out again right so let's change\nthat so bi means adopt someone else's\npersonality right so take\ncharacteristics break them down into\nthose three pieces and then if that's\nwhat you want to be in your life you can\ndo it go for it the problem is adopting\nsomeone else's identity this is a\ncompletely different thing if you start\nto think of your personality as identity\nthen that is cringe so let's understand\nthis let's say that you are really good\nwith people and the moment you start\nthat's great it's wonderful you're\nyou're extroverted you're charismatic\nyou're social fine all of those things\nwonderful the moment that you think if\nyou don't understand what cringe is you\ncan take someone who's very charismatic\nwhat makes them cringe identifying as\ncharismatic I'm the most charismatic\nperson in the world look at me I'm so\ncharismatic I'm so sexy you want me you\nneed me uhhuh that becomes cringe\nanything when we identify with it\nbecomes cringe let's say I'm sad and I'm\ndepressed right this is something that\ndeserves compassion it deserves help it\ndeserves support doesn't make you weak\nor anything like that sometimes\ndepression happens to people so be it\nsome people make it their identity I've\nhad them as patients right that becomes\ncringe I am depressed I am depressed I\nam I can never get better I can get\nnever get better I can never get better\nwe still deserve I think we should give\nthem compassion and stuff right that's\nwhat we do you're going love video games\nbut if you become a gamer right I'm a\ngamer oh those aren't real games a real\ngamer plays these games that's cringe so\nthe moment that personality becomes\nidentity we've entered the realm of\ncringe even something as simple as but\nwhat about other qualities like humility\noh my God the most cringe of all of\nthese is identity based on humility\nbeing humble is fantastic if your\npersonality is one who's humble okay\nlike I'm not entitled to anything I\ndon't interpret that I should have I\nbought a lottery ticket I have a one in\na billion chance that I'm going to win\nthis is how it is being humble is\nwonderful having an identity is humble I\nsaw this so much in the asham look at\nhow humble I am look at how spiritual I\nused to be like that arguably I'm still\nlike that and still I haven't figured it\nout yet I'm sure a year from now I'll\nfigure out that there's some part of my\nidentity that is cringe look at how\nhumble I am everyone else is arrogant\nbut I'm so humble he's like not like the\nother boys or not like the other girls\nright like look at me like I'm so I'm so\ndifferent cringe so if you seriously if\nyou want someone else's personality go\nfor it right but let's understand what\npersonality is it is way you interpret\ninformation by all means interpret\ninformation in a more optimistic and a\nhealthier way go for it right if you're\nlooking cuz I was looking at this this\nand I see all these like anime\ncharacters right and like that's cool\nlike I think you can take\ncharacteristics from anime and try to be\nmore like those people like fine\nhopefully not the cringe ones right so\nif you and that's what human beings are\nlike we talked a little bit about\ncomparison earlier and and like that's\npart of it you compare yourself to other\npeople like your parents and we are\nwired to adopt some of those behaviors\nthis is why peer pressure is a thing\nbecause our brain is wired to adopt what\nother people do this is healthy just\ndon't get it confused with your identity\nand by all means change the way that you\ninterpret information change the way\ninterpret information in a better way\nwhether that's more skepticism or less\nskepticism whatever right depends on the\nperson depends on who you're looking up\nto depends on the change you need to\nmake change the way that you react to\nthings by all means react to something\nlike a hero in an anime where when the\ntheir disadvantage instead of giving up\nand jerking off for a week they decide\nto actually like give it a shot even if\nthey could lose go for it right go for\nit be more compassionate and accepting\nof people's quirks because that's a\npersonality characteristic you see\nsomeone have in a fictional Universe go\nfor it just don't let it cross the realm\nthe boundary into identity and if we\nactually see it a lot of these people\nwho are like super in anime right the\nreason that they're so cringe is because\nthey adopt it as an identity not as a\n[Music]\npersonality"
