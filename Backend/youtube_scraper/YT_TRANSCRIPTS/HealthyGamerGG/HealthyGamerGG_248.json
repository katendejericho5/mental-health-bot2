    "transcript": "the problem is until we start\nquestioning our perception then the\ncycle of depression will continue\nbecause the inputs we're getting that\nare making us depressed are not actually\naccurate they are distorted in some way\nand since they're distorted we see the\nworld in a negative light then we draw\nconclusions about the world our mind\nloves to overgeneralize then we draw\nconclusions about ourselves and then\nonce we believe that we are not good\nthen all kinds of problems will arise so\nthe question is how do you short circuit\nthis the way you shortcircuit at it is\nby actually training your perception\nright so if we can look out for these\ncognitive biases the selection bias the\ninterpretation of ambiguity as negative\nand the overgeneralization it will\nchange literally the way that you see\nthe world and once the world becomes a\ndifferent place it is way easier to be\nless depressed"
