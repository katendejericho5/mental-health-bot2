    "transcript": "often times the problem with shyness is\nnot the shyness it's the lack of\nconfidence so someone who is not\nconfident and shy will stay in the\ncorner where someone who is confident\nand shy like I don't care to speak to or\nget to know people it's not for me and\nyou guys may say but that's weird aren't\nyou a psychiatrist and like don't you\nget to I love to get to know people in\nthat way but I detest Small Talk At a\nparty like I don't want to hang out with\nany of these people but if you're\nconfident you can so then what ends up\nhappening is I'd say that you need to\nwork on your confidence and don't try to\nfix the shyness it's a personality\ncharacteristic you don't need to fix\nthat you need to fix the confidence so\nit's not that you should be less shy it\nis that you should have the control over\nyourself to where if you are put in a\nsituation that requires interaction with\nother human beings you can do so with\nfull skill and effort you should not be\ncontrolled by your shyness and that\nusually involves confidence"
