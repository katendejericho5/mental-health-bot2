    "transcript": "you have this idea of oh my God like\nthis relationship with this beautiful\nwhat a beautiful relationship and then\nsome unlucky human being has to pick up\nthat mantle some unlucky human being\nwith flaws is now trying to interact\nwith you but you're not interacting with\nthem because you have a preconceived\nidea of what the relationship should\n[Music]\nbe since I was in my early teens sex\ndating and relationships were the most\nimportant thing for me however despite\nthat fact somehow the years passed me by\nand I barely had any experiences all the\nones I did have were Rel really negative\nand hurt me now almost every time the\ntopic comes up in my life I feel a sort\nof pulling pain in the middle of my\nchest that is overwhelming and oh boy\ndoes it come up regularly it's the in\nthe movies books General pop culture and\njust pretty much everywhere my friends\ntalk about the tons of experiences they\nhad know they are not lying all the time\nI'm 23 and I now feel like nothing I can\nexperience in the future will be able to\noutweigh the pain that I already\nexperienced I just can't imagine\nanything that would justify the mental\nAgony I went through so far which might\nseem theatrical to some people but it is\nthe way that I feel maybe I'm just a\nsensitive person the disappointment with\nmyself for failing at the thing that has\nalways been the most important to me is\nsometimes crushing me I'd say I break\ndown because of it twice per month I've\nbeen in therapy for a year now okay\nstrong work hot G23 I mean that it can\nfeel like a vicious cycle where you're\nkind of stuck or actually not vicious\ncycle more like you get trapped you fall\nbehind and then you can't ever fix\nthings so we're going to start by taking\nsome notes okay because there there's a\nlot of things to understand here so I'm\ngoing to start with this concept of\nsomething called the Peter Principle and\nthe Peter Principle is this kind of\nprinciple from management that says that\neveryone Rises to the level of their\nincompetence now this can be kind of\nconfusing but let's understand this so\nlet's say I work at a job and I excel at\njob number one then what happens I get\npromoted to the next tier and then I\nexcel at the next tier and then I get\npromoted to the next tier and now I just\ndo an average job right this is\nequivocal so I do not excel at which\npoint I stay over here so instead of\nhaving me occupy a job where I have\nexcellent performance perance I'm\noccupying a place where I have mediocre\nperformance so this is kind of an\ninteresting observation that they made\nin the world of business that basically\nlike if you look at a company that has\n500 employees everyone is like operating\nat a mediocre level because they've been\npromoted out of their best skill set now\ny'all may say what does this have to do\nwith this case so here's kind of a weird\nkind of perspective right so if you have\na problem and you are stuck with that\nproblem for a long period of time and\nyou think you understand the problem\nthen chances are you actually don't\nunderstand the problem because the\nproblems that you correctly understand\nare the ones that you fix and the ones\nthat you incorrectly understand will\nstay unfixable right does that kind of\nmake sense so sometimes what happens is\npeople will have a problem for like 10\nyears and they'll say this is an\nunfixable problem because it's been a\nproblem for 10 years but the reason it's\nbeen unfixable is because you've\nmisunderstood it which actually means it\nis quite Poss to fix it so one way to\nkind of think about this in the field of\nmedicine is let's say I have a diagnosis\ndx1 and then dx1 has three treatment\noptions it has T1 T2 T3 right and let's\nsay treatment one doesn't work treatment\n2 doesn't work treatment 3 doesn't work\nand then you conclude that dx1 is\nunsolvable uncurable\nunfixable but it turns out that what you\nreally need to do to fix this problem is\nrecognize that this is a different\ndiagnosis you had a the wrong diagnosis\nand it turns out that you do T1 over\nhere and then this fixes the problem\nthis happens all the time in medicine\nthis is why a lot of people think that\nmedicine is about treatment medicine is\nnot just about treatment that's only\nhalf of it half of our training is in\ndiagnosing the problem correctly and so\nwhat I tend to see is people will have\nchallenges like this which I'm not\nsaying these challenges aren't real they\nare real and there's a lot that we're\ngoing to discover here that is actually\nquite logical it's not illogical at all\nit's 100% logical but just because it's\nlogical doesn't mean that it is correct\nit just means that it is correct in a\nform so let's understand this okay hey\ny'all if you're interested in applying\nsome of the principles that we share to\nactually create change in your life\ncheck out Dr K's guide to mental health\nit combines over two decades of my\nexperience of both being a monk and a\npsychiatrist and distills all of the\nmost important things I've learned into\na Choose Your Own Adventure format so\ncheck out the link in the bio and start\nyour journey today mistake number one\nsince I was in my early teens dating and\nrelationships were the most important\nthing for me however despite that fact\nthis is the first thing to understand\nimportance and success because as we\nwill discover something being really\nreally important to you makes it much\nharder to succeed not much easier years\npassed by and I barely had any\nexperiences all the ones I did have were\nreally negative and hurt me lots or not\nsome Lots let's use the word all all\nexperiences were bad hurtful okay now\nalmost every time the topic comes up I\nfeel a pulling pain in the middle of my\nchest that is really overwhelming my\nfriends talk about a ton of experiences\nI'm 23 and I feel like nothing I can\nexperience in the future will ever\noutweigh what I've already experienced\nokay now people may look at this and\nthey may say oh my God this person has\nlost all hope they are wrong no they are\nnot wrong they are not wrong at all if\nyou are someone who has suffered a lot\nand you think that nothing can make it\nbetter you may be surprised how right\nyou are but don't give up hope I just\ncan't imagine anything that would\njustify the mental Agony I went through\nso far and you are\ncorrect justify the mental Agony okay\nwhich might see theatrical maybe I'm a\nsensitive person don't do that okay\nwe're going to touch on this the\ndisappointment with myself for failing\nit the thing that had always been the\nmost important to me is sometimes\ncrushing me ah hold on a second hold on\na second hold on a second now we begin\nto see okay so here's the interesting\nthing here's the first thing that I'm\nI'm going to point out so because this\nis the most important thing for you\nfailing at it is crushing so this is\nvery important to understand okay now\nwe're going to get to it so here are our\nproblems importance and success number\none so a lot of people assume that if\nsomething is really important to you it\nmakes it easier to be successful but\nactually especially with dating having\nit be of hyper importance is one of the\nmost negative things you can do for your\nchances for Success so I'll give youall\nthis isn't just dating this is other\nthings as well oh my God I'm terrified I\nhave to do well on this exam I have to\ndo well on this exam this exam is I have\nto do good I have to do good I have to\ndo good I'm so stressed out about it I\ndon't sleep I study for eight hours and\nI think to myself oh my God this isn't\nenough other people know more than me I\nit has to be successful it has to be\nsuccessful I panic myself am I doing\nwell did I get that right did I get that\nwrong I have no confidence in my ability\nI second guess all of my answers on the\ntest and I end up getting a C+ the\nimportance of a thing does not\nnecessarily improve its chances of\nsuccess and now we see a second problem\nwhen something is really important to\nyou okay which is that not only do you\nhave the original let's call it a\nfailure okay but now since you failed at\nsomething so there's just the failure\nitself let's say I I wasn't able to date\nokay that's bad but if this is the most\nimportant to me then what I have is a\nsecond part of crushing defeat that I\nhave failed at the thing that is the\nmost important to me that is actually\nindependent of the failure to date does\nthat make sense so there are two\ninjuries here number one is failure to\ndate and number\ntwo is\ncrushing\ndefeat because number one okay so I know\nthis sounds insane but one thing you can\ndo in this situation is start to have\nthis be less important to you and we'll\ntalk about what that is okay so I'll\ngive you all like then people will say\nbut I'm aren't I allowed to want what I\nwant this is important to me and like\nthis is how I am and I love it so much\nbut hold on a back up a second okay so a\ncouple of things so I learned this the\neasy way so I got super lucky right I\ndecided to become a monk so I had years\nand years of like I'd want to say five\nyears of just pathetic attempts to date\nand people will say oh my God 5 years\nthat's nothing I've had 20 years and\nit's not the number of years that you\nhave and this is kind of what I\ndiscovered is that there is a different\nway to do it if I had kept operating the\nsame way I had operated I would have\ngone 10 years 15 years 20 years right A\nBroken Clock may be right twice a day\nbut it's wrong at all the other times so\nthis is the this is how we need to\napproach dating so basically what I did\nis decided to become a monk and then I\nno longer I gave up the importance of\ndating this is not for me and\nparadoxically this helped me become more\nattractive because I was so caught up in\nmy own stuff\nthat it was like stressing people out\nand I wasn't my best self and all this\nother stuff that people talk about in\ndating so let's talk a little bit about\nhow to make dating less important now\nthe first thing that's going to happen\nis if I talk about making dating less\nimportant there is going to be a torrent\nof disagreement no Dr K it's the most\nimportant how dare you tell me to Value\noh my God this is important to me it's\nall I care about yeah so let's\nunderstand what happens so when you have\nvery little EXP experience dating and\nyou care a\nlot about dating what happens in your\nmind so you start to build up fantasies\nright so how does the Mind know when you\nsay this is the most important thing to\nyou so let's let's understand this for a\nsecond okay we'll get to how to\nincorporate important so let's just\nunderstand this if someone has no\nexperience with dating and they say\ngetting laate is the most important\nthing to me having a relationship is the\nmost important thing to me what is it\nthat's important to you like literally\nwhat is it the relationship but have you\never had a relationship how can you\nvalue something that you have no\nknowledge of just think about it for a\nsecond right so if someone's like oh\nyeah like I have dreams to be an Olympic\nAthlete like I have dreams to be an\nOlympic Athlete it's everything in the\nworld to me and so I recently saw this\ninteresting article that the day after\nMichael Phelps I think won like four\ngold medals or something when the\nOlympics was over he wakes up the next\nday and he's suicidal this guy's crazy\nso the first thing to understand is that\nif dating and relationships are very\nvery the most important oh I want love\nthis is what I need to be fulfilled I\nhave this ache in my heart I've been\nthere right I had it too so if if you're\njust think about this okay so if you if\nthis is really important to you what is\nit that your mind thinks this is and\nwhat tends to happen when we value\nsomething that we have no experience\nover is we construct a fantasy and the\nmoment that you construct a fantasy you\nhave really set yourself up for a lot of\nproblems because the reality will be\ndifferent from it so instead of like\neven like a neutral experience so now we\nwe'll get to a couple of things okay so\nonce I construct a fantasy let's say\nthat this is relationships are the most\nimportant thing to me they're 100 right\nand then I have a real experience which\nis normal which is a 50 but what do I\nsee I see a minus 50 now if you're\nsomeone who does this your mind will\nrebel against this idea 100% no Dr K you\ndon't understand my situation my\nsituation is different but let's just\ntake a step back and I'll ask you forget\nabout your situation let's just\nunderstand the general principle when\nyou have no experience of something how\non Earth can you value it or you have\nvery little experience of it how do you\nunderstand its accurate value and so the\nproblem is we create all of these\nfantasies it becomes really really\nimportant to us and when something\nbecomes important to us we run into all\nkinds of problems because this is an\naverage normal experience which looks\nlike a minus 50 in your book so you're\nstarting you're opening the door to\nnegative bias you're also opening the\ndoor to stress which is going to make\nless\nattractive you are looking for something\nin particular instead of letting\nrelationships be organic and since I\ndecided to become a monk all of my\nromantic interactions have been like\nrelatively organic right so this is what\ntends to happen when you have a lot of\npeople when you see these people out\nthere who are like I don't understand\nhow this person keeps on finding\nrelationships and like where they're\nmeeting people like they just seem to be\nso good at it and and I think that there\nis a natural organic to relationships\nthat's how human being that's how human\nrelationships are designed to evolve and\nwhen you once you start adding\nimportance and stress to the\nrelationship it really sabotages your\nchances and there's one other source of\nsabotage that importance in a\nrelationship causes okay so the more\nimportant you think it is the worse off\nit is there's one other person that this\nreally harms and that is your\nperspective partner so when a\nrelationship is the most important thing\nto you oh my God this is what they mean\nto me they they they mean that there's\nlove and there's commitment and there's\nlike someone on your team all the time\nsomeone there for you whenever you need\nit and then you have this idea of oh my\nGod like this relationship with this\nbeautiful what a beautiful relationship\nand then some unlucky human being has to\npick up that mantle some unlucky human\nbeing with flaws is now trying to\ninteract with you but you're not\ninteracting with them because you have a\npreconceived idea of what the\nrelationship should be this is what I\nwant I need all of these things from Rel\nand then some human just a human just a\nperson is like I don't know how to\nhandle this like I can't make this\nperson happy or like this is weird so\nthey feel all of that pressure and it\npushes them away so paradoxically the\nfirst thing that you need to do if\nrelationships are the most important\nthing in the world to you is make them\nless important secondly if you're like I\ndon't want to do that right if you're so\nclinging to that that you cannot change\nthat that then examine that for a moment\nand then the second thing that you can\ndo even if you don't want to make it so\nimportant to you if you don't don't want\nto make it less important sorry there\nare other things that you can do which\nis observe these three things that I've\ntold you so when you make a relationship\nsuper important to you what do you\nconstruct in your mind how does your\nFantastical construction affect your\ninterpretation of real experiences\nchances are it'll be disappointing how\ndoes it affect your stress level when\nyou try to engage in this because\nrelationships are supposed to be fun\nright that's the whole point is\neveryone's like laughing and having sex\nand cuddling and maybe getting married\nand going on vacation and finishing each\nother's sandwiches this is what a\nrelationship is supposed to be that's\nwhy you want it so much but what is it\nlike for you right so as you bring that\nstress to the table it's going to you're\ngoing to shoot yourself in the foot not\nsaying it's easy I'm just saying that\nthis is a very common problem where\npeople will make relationships so\nimportant to them and then they end up\nshooting themselves in the foot let's\nlook at number two how to make\nrelationships less important so now\nlet's understand this okay if you want\nto make relationships less important\nhere's what you got to do number one\njust notice what this relationship being\nso important to you means and so just\nask yourself okay if this is important\nto me what does it mean to be in a\nrelationship like what is the\nsignificance of being in relationship\nand also like what does it who am I if\nI'm in a relationship and then like who\nam I not unless I'm in a relationship so\nso how do you see yourself if you are in\na relationship or not in a relationship\nright and that's when like we'll start\nto see that there's a lot of stuff that\nyou\nattach so you need to just look at that\nkind of stuff okay what is the what do I\nthink a relationship is and then once\nyou have it once you answer that\nquestion then ask yourself where did I\nget this idea and I'm not saying that\nthe idea is going to be wholly fictional\nbecause even our fictional\nrepresentations are rooted in in reality\nbut you need to just like look at what\nyour mind is doing if you're so caught\nup in relationships right and then the\nlast thing this is what's really\nimportant so if something is important\nto you I don't know if this makes sense\nbut for people who are the import\nrelationships are so important to them\nthere is an ache or a hunger and this\nache and hunger is so profound this is\nwhy you can't make relationships less\nimportant for you because on some level\nyou are\nstarving you're hungry there's something\ndeep down inside you that is unfulfilled\nand the thought thought of having that\nthing unfulfilled for the rest of your\nlife if you decrease the value of\nrelationships oh my God it'll be\nunfulfilled for the rest of my life that\nhunger will always be there that hunger\nis unbearable this is why it's\nimpossible to make him less important\nbecause you have that ache you have that\nhunger and to really understand where\ndoes this come from and this is one of\nthe weird things that I found as a\npsychiatrist is that often times we look\nat these things like trauma we say oh my\nGod like this sounds like a case of\ntrauma like this person must have been\nhurt very deeply when they were young\nand they look back at their lives and\nthey think to themselves okay I never\nhad anything like that there's no\nsmoking gun in my childhood my parents\nwere pretty chill they were pretty\nloving they're still together I don't\nknow where this hunger comes from and so\nsometimes I will explore the concept of\npast lives with people like my patients\nright and there's all kind like who\nknows where it comes from maybe it\ndoesn't come from this life I'm not\nsaying their past lives are real or\nthings like that I think there's\ntherapeutic value to operating in what\nwhatever frame a patient considers\nhelpful right so if they believe in God\nwe talk about God if they don't believe\nin God we don't talk about God it\ndepends on the patient but for you just\nbecause you can't find the answers\nexpand your horizon a little bit right\nit comes from somewhere all things come\nfrom somewhere nothing is random in the\nworld cause and effect so really explore\nthat hunger because this is going to be\nwhat makes it really hard and if you do\nthese four things this is going to be\nthe first step to really understanding\nhow to make relationships less important\nfor you because as it turns out\nrelationships being important may\nactually sabotage your chances of\nsuccess and we see this a ton in our\ncoaching program so we've had about\n12,000 or 15,000 people go through it\nnow and like a lot of times they'll come\nin with some problem that they think is\nreally really huge and then what the\ncoaches are really good at is like\nhelping them understand okay wait the\nway that you are playing the game is\nactually what's creating the result it's\nnot that the game is rigged it's that\nyou're misplaying you make the same\nmistake over and over and over again and\nand then somehow as like they understand\nthis stuff then they like start to get\nbetter and then suddenly they're like in\nrelationships it's weird we've seen it a\nton okay and these are like people from\nour community right so this isn't just\nlike some other theoretical fictitious\nperson who spends more time on LinkedIn\nthan on Reddit or twitch or YouTube or\nwhatever so like this is like\nus okay so really you have to understand\nwhat strategy you're using to play the\ngame and then you'll be surprised that\nif you can reduce the importance of the\nrelationship it fre freze you up more\nand it makes it more accessible but if\nyou're approaching it from a place of\nstress with high expectations and low\nself-worth this is a recipe for disaster\njust think about it right if I were to\ntell you okay hey like this person wants\nto get in a relationship oh tell me\nabout the person well they have super\nhigh expectations they have F\nFantastical ideas about what a\nrelationship should be like they have\nsuper low self-esteem they're stressed\nout a ton about relationships and they\nthey feel a crushing sadness every two\nweeks\nthat is crippling for them how how\noptimistic would you be right and some\nof these things are in your control\nnotice I didn't say I'm not disputing\nthat this person had negative\nexperiences all the ones I did have were\nreally negative and hurt me we'll get to\nthat in a second let's talk about I\nforget about a second let's talk about\nnow so this is kind of bizarre but when\nyou really want a relationship why is it\nthat what little experience you do have\nis so painful and sucks right that's\nwhat we see is that like oh my God like\nall the experience I I've had are hard\nso we can talk about something like\ncognitive bias if you all really want to\nthere may be some degree of cognitive\nbias here there's good evidence of that\nbut here's what tends to happen when you\nare desperate for a relationship and you\nfeel like you have low self-esteem you\ndo a very very interesting psychological\nthing which is that you remove all of\nthe healthy relationship possibilities\nfrom the equation before you even get\nstarted you discount all the people that\nwould lead to a good relationship so\nI'll give you all a really interesting\nexample for this when I graduated from\ncollege so I was a fifth year senior\nright finished with a 2.5 GPA I applied\nfor research positions because I had a\ndegree in neurobiology I applied to 131\nresearch positions and I got rejected\nfrom all of them except for one the one\nresearch position I ended up getting was\nat Harvard Medical school's oser\nResearch Center and I was really\nsurprised because I was like holy crap I\napplied to University of Texas San\nAntonio and like Texas Tech University\nfor research positions and I wind up\ngoing to interview at Harvard and then I\nkind of asked a couple months later I\nwas like how did I get this job and they\nwere like you were the only one that\napplied I was like what so there is a\nglot of mediocrity what happens with\npeople is they tend to undershoot where\nthey actually are so you have to\nunderstand this okay if you have low\nself-esteem do you accurately gauge what\nyou're worth is of course not that's the\nwhole point it's low self-esteem like\nyou think it's accurate but you think a\nthousand people have low self-esteem are\nthey accurately judging where they are\nno they're not so then what happens is\nyou have the possibility of a\nrelationship with someone and I see this\na lot especially in the people I work\nwith because the people I work with are\nall broken so they look at someone on a\ndating app and they're like that person\nisn't broken enough that person wouldn't\never want to date me oh my God you're so\ntelepathic my God you know this person\nso well you know what their preferences\nare you know what their attracted to oh\nbut they put something in my dating in\ntheir dating profile that I don't fit\nwell like that's a little bit silly\nbecause the only things we put in dating\nprofiles are things that don't relate to\nthe success of a relationship I know\nthat sounded weird so I'll rephrase so\ndating profiles are restricted with the\nkind of information that you can put and\ndue dating profiles capture the actual\nvariables that lead to successful\nrelationships no they don't right\nthere's all kinds of variables that lead\nto successful relationships like shared\nemotional experience the first time you\nmeet that's not you can't put that on a\ndating app right everyone assumes that\nit's different shared religion and\neverybody who wants like you know I I\nwant to be a sugar sugar daddy or I want\nto be a sugar baby and somebody else\nwants to be a sugar mama and like as\nlong as the babies and the mas and the\ndaddies all get together everybody's\nhappy but that's not actually what leads\nto relationships so the first thing is\nwhen we have low self-esteem when we\nthink that oh my God this is like I'm\nI'm not good at this the biggest mistake\nthat we make is we remove all the people\nthat are too good for us and then we're\nleft with all the people who are a\nlittle bit busted and then no wonder we\nhave negative experiences right because\nyou're selecting the one person that\nfeels safe to you which is someone who\nis unable to have a healthy relationship\nso we see this pattern it's been very\nwell studied in trauma so when you have\nchildren who who are abused they will\ndate people who are abusive why what's\ngoing on there it's because when someone\nwhen there's someone who's not abusive\nthe person gets confused they'd never\nconsider dating them in the first place\nbecause it's weird that person's too\ngood for me or they get scared by the\nlack of abuse when is the other shoe\ngoing to drop this person is being\nreally nice that must mean that they're\ngoing to be really nasty to me later and\nyou may say but Dr K why would you think\nthat just think about it for a second\nright in someone if you're a child who\ngrows up in an abusive household usually\nyour parents are not all nasty they're\nhumans which means that they also\nexperience guilt so on one day you're\nabused and on the next day your parent\nis like I'm so sorry here's a p PS5 let\nme make it up to you and then a few\nmonths later they start drinking again\nthe abuse starts they feel guilty their\n30 days sober the gifts start coming and\nso what does this person start to\nunderstand about gifts holy crap they're\ntied with abuse and so then you have a\nhealthy partner who starts giving you\ngifts and you're like oh I better\nrun cuz there's another aspect of this\nif you if you struggled with abuse is\nthat when you meet someone that you\nreally really like who is not abusive\nbut the thought of this one good person\nthat you really believe you could love\nand could really be the one who is not\nabusive the thought of that person one\nday becoming abusive is so scary that\nyou just Retreat from the relationship I\ncan't afford to lose all hope because if\nthis person turns out bad if this good\napple turns into a bad apple then all of\nmy hope is lost so you leave let me\npreserve the idea of a good apple out\nthere and so part of the reason that we\nhave such negative experiences if you\nhave low self-esteem who are you going\nto feel comfortable engaging in romantic\nrelationships with asking out on dates\nright so then then we have this real\nproblem where of course your experiences\nare negative but that's because of who\nyou're selecting and then people may say\nbut I have this like idea like but I\nfell fell in love oh my God I fell in\nlove right so this is the fantasy again\nfalling in love is the stupidest thing\nyou can do it's like the whole point is\nthat the biology of your system doesn't\ngive about the long-term\nconsequences and whether this is going\nto be emotionally good or emotionally\nbad it doesn't care\nthat's how we're wired we're wired to\nthink about like ignore the consequences\nliterally our brain is wired to like oh\nmy God I'm in love I guess I better shut\noff all the parts of my brain that allow\nme to calculate risks oh my God I'm in\nlove oh yeah all those red flags they're\njust personality quirks it's just a\nphase I can I can fix him I can fix her\nI can turn I can with my help oh my\ngoodness they will turn into such a\ndelicious peach pie oh my God we start\nto ignore all these things and so this\nis why we have negative experiences and\nso this is also why people say work on\nyourself before you start dating now if\nonly that worked the sad truth of the\nmatter and we know this from studies on\nattachment theory is that often times if\nyou're so busted and you have low\nself-esteem you can't necessarily fix\nthat on your own I mean a lot of people\ndo and I think it's a worthwhile\nEndeavor for you to try to fix it on\nyour own but the sad truth of the matter\nis is that we know from you know lots of\nresearch on Psychotherapy and stuff like\nthat that like often times we need\ncorrective emotional experiences to heal\nthat trauma and those corrective\nemotional experiences are provided by\nother human beings and this is something\nthat we don't like to say especially in\nthe west because we have this culture of\nIndependence I should be able to do it\nmyself but like that's not how human\nbeings were wired we were wired as a\ntribe right it's a multiplayer game you\ncan't solo all the content and now\npeople are going to be like okay but\ndoes that mean I'm screwed because now I\nhave to rely on other people and I have\nto work on myself like I don't\nunderstand what are you telling me to do\ndoc I'm telling you it's a slow process\nunderstand the nuances of it you can't\njust work on yourself but you should\nwork on yourself and also recognize your\nrelationship\npatterns right how is it that I wind up\nin the same place over and over and over\nagain and whatever answer your mind\ncomes up with that is wrong if it is an\nanswer that is already given you it is\nwrong it must be a new answer this is\nthe nature of diagnosis and treatment if\nyou have one diagnosis and all three\ntreatments have failed consider a second\ndiagnosis right and this is what we see\nlike so I've worked with people who are\nin cells and they have this belief that\nbecause their jaw is whatever they will\nnever have a a date it's impossible for\nthem to find love and they all believe\nthis and this is where you have to be\nsuper careful because if you have a\ndiagnosis that is unactionable you're\nscrewed right and we have those in\nmedicine we have things like stage four\nmetastatic cancer we have secondary\nProgressive multiple sclerosis we have\nALS right we have stroke where like you\nlose a chunk of the brain and it doesn't\nreally come back like brain doesn't\nregenerate much but usually with some of\nthese problems that we see a lot with\ndating a lot of these are very\ncorrectable because the problem is not\nactually in the world it is in the way\nthat you perceive and interact with the\nworld and that can change we know for\nexample that people who have borderline\npersonality disorder probably about 90%\nof them will get better within a decade\nthe specific numbers vary depending on\nthe study or whatever but a big part of\nthat can be a a single healthy\nrelationship for 2 years leads to 50% of\npeople being in remission from BPD so I\nknow that everyone's like just work on\nyourself you can't fix yourself first\nand then engage in a relationship it's\ngreat give it a shot by all means but if\nit doesn't work it's not like you have\nto fix yourself first and then enter a\nrelationship the two need to be\nconcurrent probably and the most\nimportant thing is pay attention to your\npatterns that got you here in the first\nplace so we talked about the importance\nin success we also talk about all\nexperiences were hurtful right now let\ntalking about pulling pain and nothing\nwill make it better so when we have\nnegative emotional experiences this\nemotion gets stored in the body and in\nthe mind and we tend to have these\nphysical Sensations so what tends to\nhappen is that anytime we have\noverwhelming negative stuff our our\nbrain and body are like we can't deal\nwith this so we push it down we wall it\noff behind psychological defense\nmechanisms will do things like\nself-medicate with\nsubstances with you know video games\nporn whatever and then all those\nemotions get shoved to the side and then\nwe enter this kind of thinking that\nnothing will make it better and nothing\nwill justify the mental Agony and this\nis actually 100% logical because thus\nfar what have you experienced that would\nmake this pain worthwhile nothing so you\nhave no frame of reference right all\nyou've been taking is bitter medicine\nevery day and you're like I can't\nimagine any situation in which I would\never want to put anything into my mouth\nbecause all I'm eating is bitter\nmedicine every single day and it's like\nyeah if you've never tasted a mango or a\nBLT or whatever like it would make sense\nthat you've never had an experience that\nwould make it nothing will make it\nworthwhile right so if you've never had\nthat experience of course nothing is\ngoing to make it worthwhile that doesn't\nmean that nothing is theoretically out\nthere and this is another bias of the\nmind that we have to be careful about\nthe Mind operates under the assumption\nthat my experiences are mirrors of\nobjective reality but that's not true\nright your mind just constructs whatever\nreality it's got and that's the best it\nkind of does and so it is okay for you\nto think this way and just because you\nthink that way because all of your\nexperiences up to the age of 23 have\nmade it so that nothing is worth the\npain so be it but that's just all the\nexperiences up to 23 arguably you've got\nabout 60 years left right so you've got\nlet's say you started puberty around 14\nso you've been doing this for let's say\na decade and you've got six of those\nleft and so things can change so this is\nwhere we strongly recommend things like\nyou know emotional processing and this\nperson is in therapy which is can be\nvery helpful but I strongly recommend\nthat if y'all are in therapy and you\nhave a problem like this like this is\nwhat you work on in therapy I used to\nthink this was obvious until I realized\nthat a lot of people don't it's not\nobvious actually that when you are in\ntherapy you are working on something and\nwhat a lot of patients don't realize is\nyou can pick what that is it is your\ntherapist's job to fix what you want and\nthen a lot of people may be like but oh\nmy God can they fix me yeah like that's\nour job like that's what we're there to\ndo if someone comes in and says hey I've\ngot OCD and I wash my hands 15 times a\nday and my hands I keep on getting\ninfections the therapist job is to help\nyou with that or if it's something like\nthis they're their job is to help you\ndeal with this pulling pain in your\nchest so you don't have to walk around\nwith it all day long so a lot of people\nwill go into therapy and then like their\ntherapist is like ask some weird\nopen-ended question and then you just\ntalk about you you think you're supposed\nto be you're doing what you're supposed\nto be doing in therapy instead of\nactually doing what you want to do in\ntherapy go and do what you want to do\nand then the last thing that you have to\nbe super careful about this is the most\ndevastating thing okay so sometimes when\nall this negative stuff happens we end\nup with this sentence out of everything\nin this post this is the most damaging\nthing so when we go through life we have\nexperiences and this part of our brain\ncalled the default mode Network takes\nthese individ ual experiences and makes\na conclusion about me I'm just a\nsensitive person so when I was growing\nup for example I thought I was\nunathletic and how did I arrive at that\nconclusion well I was last to be picked\non the basketball team I was last to be\npicked on the the football team I was\nlast to be picked for anything and I was\nnever the winner of any sports contest I\nnever came in first when we were running\nand so I concluded oh I'm not bad at\nbasketball I'm not bad at this I'm not\nbad I am unathletic so then what happens\nis once I start to think oh my God I am\non athletic then opportunities arose\nlater in life where they were like hey\ndo you want to do this thing and I was\nlike nah I'm not athletic it's not for\nme it's not who I am and so then what\nhappened is I stopped engaging in\nathletic activities which then\nreinforced the idea that I'm on athletic\nbecause everybody else is doing athletic\nstuff and now I'm just playing video\ngames all day I'm on athletic now what's\nwrong about this maybe I was on athletic\nno I came to an incorrect conclusion I\nwas a six-year-old competing against\n7-year-olds or even 8-year-olds that's\nwhy I was last it wasn't that I was\nunathletic it was the deck was stacked\nagainst me I was placed into a physical\nbracket where people had were like\nphysically larger and faster and more\ncoordinated and by the way had a year of\npractice over me right so then we're in\nlike big trouble so the one thing you've\ngot to be super careful about if you are\nin this dating hellscape is be careful\nabout what conclusions your mind draws\nabout you and you you will have what\nappears to be the right evidence at the\ntime to fall to form that conclusion\ndon't don't don't misund understand this\nI'm not saying that you're not logical\nit's that you have incomplete\ninformation so it was also a logical\nconclusion for a 5-year-old to think\nlike okay like I'm on athletic because I\nsuck at all this clearly but I didn't\nhave the frame of mind to think oh like\nI didn't think to myself how much older\nare these kids right maybe that has\nsomething to do with it so be super\ncareful about making meta level\nconclusions about your identity from\ndating because chances are they're not\ncorrect doesn't mean that they're not\nlogical they're just incomplete so if we\nhad taken you and put you in a different\ncircumstance or strengthen your skills\nin some sort of way or sent you to\ntherapy or whatever else it's very\npossible that you would be in a\ndifferent scenario right now and all of\nthose actions can still be taken and\nthen the last thing that I'll talk about\nis you know the disappointment with\nmyself for failing at the thing that had\nalways been the most important to me so\nthis is the problem of two arrows this\nis the problem of like okay not only do\nI have a set back in life but now I am\nbeating myself up because I had a\nsetback in life and so now you have two\nthings to overcome so I know it can\nsound really really challenging that if\nyou've been in this situation where you\ncan't recover from your terrible dating\nexperience I'm not disputing that your\nexperience has been terrible I'm not\nsaying that things aren't hard I'm not\nsaying that things the mental Agony\nyou've experienced is false in any way\nshape or form but my consistent\nexperience working with people from all\nwalks of life and this includes people\nwho are in prison people people are\nhomeless and people are billionaires\nseen the whole spectrum and what I found\nthe one thing that we fail to understand\nthe one most common mistake that human\nbeings make is that they do not\nunderstand how their actions shape the\nworld that they live in and this becomes\neven more of a problem because as you\nstop believing that your actions shape\nthe world right it's it's kind of like\nthis ex external idea of okay everything\nis determined for me then you give up on\nyour actions actually having any sort of\nimpact and then you stop you you start\nignoring your actions and once you stop\nstart ignoring your actions you ignore\nthe one thing that can actually fix\nthings for you so look at the way that\nyou're playing the game really ask\nyourself question yourself how can I do\nthis differently and what you what what\nthe real thing that's really fascinating\nis it's not and then people will go Post\nonline they'll be like what should I do\nno you need to look at your thought\nprocess even before you post look at all\nof the assumptions that you have and how\nyour mind arrives at those conclusions\nbecause posting things online is a\nterrible way to get get advice and why\nis that it's because what you post is\ngoing to be biased by your mind you're\nnot going to get some objective thing if\nyou guys know what I'm talking about you\ngo to some you know political subreddit\nor gendered subreddit and it's just like\nit's an echo chamber and people post one\nway no one ever says like hey maybe\nyou're making a mistake here it's always\nlike oh my God like everyone else is\nterrible and you should break up with\nthem right away like this is a huge red\nflag\nn"
