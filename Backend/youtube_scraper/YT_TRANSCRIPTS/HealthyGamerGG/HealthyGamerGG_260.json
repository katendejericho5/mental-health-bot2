    "transcript": "part of the reason that we have\ndifficulty falling asleep is because our\nbrain doesn't know what's daytime and\nwhat's nighttime because generally\nspeaking the two are the same right so I\nwake up I sit in this office I turn on\nsome artificial lights and my brain\ndoesn't know whether it's daytime or\nnighttime in fact the way that this\nsetup is made is that it looks the same\nwhether it's daytime or nighttime so we\ncan control for lighting so what you\nreally want to do is try to spend some\ntime Outdoors ideally immediately after\nyou wake up but you want to give your\nbrain a period of light and give your\nbrain a period of Darkness even even if\nyou're working on a screen try to do it\nin a place where you have Windows or get\nsome kind of sunshine go outside for a\nfew minutes and this is the key thing\nyou also as best as possible want to\ngive your brain Darkness so what I would\nrecommend is going outside in the AM and\nafter dark this is also very important\nin my experience our brain is really\nreally good at picking up different\nkinds of things there's no doubt in my\nmind that somehow your brain can tell it\nis nighttime if we're outside engage\nyour dial Rhythm and let your brain know\nhey it's like nighttime now"
