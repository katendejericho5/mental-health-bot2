    "transcript": "and then they'll tell me the weirdest\nthing pornography addiction is the best\nthing that ever happened to me and I'll\nask them well what what what makes you\nfeel that way help me understand how you\narrived to that conclusion and he's like\nthis has really made me realize what I\nappreciate about life and like how\nimportant these things are and like what\nkind of life I want to\n[Music]\nlive how long does it take to beat a\nporn addiction I know this might might\nsound a bit too vague but I would\nappreciate it a lot if you guys would\nhelp me especially those who have beaten\nthe addiction\nmaybe I'm asking too much but if you\nguys could potentially give me tips okay\nso first thing you've got to understand\nis that an addiction is not you can't\nbeat an addiction so if you even like\nuse that terminology right so this\nimplies that there is an opponent and\nonce the opponent is vanquished it is\ndead forever I've won the game is over\nthat's not how addictions work so\naddictions are things that are with you\nall the time you never win you just win\nthe battle today you can't ever really\nwin the war I mean you can we'll get get\nto that later but so that that's the\nfirst thing is that this is why where a\nbiggest mistake that so many people make\nwith pornography addiction is that they\ntry to beat it and why is that it's\nbecause people are tired of dealing with\nit so the desire to beat it comes out of\na fantasy of no longer wanting to fight\nit every day working as an addiction\npsychiatrist the worst thing that I want\nis a patient who thinks they have beaten\ntheir addiction because that's when the\naddiction really trips you up your guard\nis down now that you've won it is people\nwho have constant vigilance until\ncertain neuroscientific changes are made\nthat that's really when you can conquer\nit but for now don't try to beat it try\nto resist so how do you do that how long\ndoes it take to beat a porn addiction so\nthat too depends on how many factors are\nthere that are driving you towards porn\nand how many factors are driving you\naway from porn so for example if you use\npornography to as a antidote to boredom\nas long as you are bored you will have\nan interest in pornography as long as\nyou use pornography as an emotional\nregulation technique as long as your\nemotions are Disturbed you will lean\ntowards pornography hey y'all if you're\ninterested in applying some of the\nprinciples that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday so this is where what we really\nneed to do is under understand okay\nthere's a dopaminergic signal there's an\nemotional signal there's a emotionally\nsuppression signal and then there's a\ncomponent of just like the brain is like\nif we're not doing anything today let me\nat least get that hit of dopamine so\nreally overcoming pornography addiction\nis not in addressing the addiction\ndirectly which there is a part of that\nit's really in understanding what are\nall the risk factors that are\ncontributing to the pornography\naddiction and that's what we try to do\nwhen we do addiction Psychiatry so is\nthe substance itself let's use an\nexample of alcohol there's the whole Act\nof not taking a drink but then there is\nalso what goes into that which is okay\nlet's do Psychotherapy to understand why\nyou started drinking in the first place\nlet's understand what your triggers are\nlet's understand like all of the par\nalcoholic Behavior and the problem that\nI see with a lot of people who struggle\nwith pornography addiction is that first\nof all a lot of clinicians don't\nspecialize in it they don't really\nunderstand how it works and secondly\nthey don't fix all of the environment\nright so for example a big part of\novercoming alcohol add\nis changing your community so if you go\nhang out with your friends who go to the\nbar or you go hang out with your friends\nwho are part of a frat you're going to\ndrink so you have to find new friends\nbut what's the community of pornography\nthe community of pornography is\nloneliness so it's very difficult you\ncan tell an alcoholic not to go to a bar\nit is far harder to tell a pornography\naddict to no longer be lonely this is\nwhy pornography addiction is\nskyrocketing sure things are getting\nmore into the supern normal stimulus\nrealm but really it's that what's the\ncommunity of pornography it's loneliness\nand so when we when I really see good\noutcomes with people who overcome\npornography addiction they have more\nmeaning in their lives and they have\nmore Community but that's very difficult\nto do so what is the bar of pornography\nright so the bar is the physical\nlocation that you go to drink where do\nyou watch pornography and where do you\nmasturbate usually at home right those\nof the people that don't do it at home\nare the ones who wind up on sex offender\nRegistries wind up up in jail those\nkinds of things and so how do you get\naway from your house this is why\npornography addiction is so bad today\nease of access ubiquitous super normal\nstimulus emotionally unregulated\npopulation so at what we're doing is our\nbrains we're getting worse and worse at\nemotional regulation you see this with\nall the Kens on the internet you see it\nwith people posting all this toxic stuff\nthis misogyny and all this kind of stuff\nevery corner of the internet is filled\nwith just negative emotion and then you\nhave safe spaces that are just vent\njust vomiting all of this negative\nemotion constantly and so the the the\nworld is becoming more emotionally\ndisregulated and so what is our Silver\nBullet what is the brain's Silver Bullet\nwhen it comes to emotional regulation\npornography it's not a controlled\nsubstance so I don't have to get someone\nto prescribe it for me it's not illegal\nso I don't have to like hang out with a\ndrug dealer it doesn't cost me my rent\nusually there's a whole other aspect of\nlike only fans and parasocial\nrelationships we're not going to get\ninto so imagine if like heroin was like\nfreely available on the internet and you\ndon't have to pay for it right what\nwould use be like you just everyone had\nall the equipment in their own homes so\nwe if you look at any addictive\nsubstance it gives pleasure and it takes\naway pain and porn does that very well\nright porn is the one addiction that\naccesses the one part of our brain not\nthe one part of our brain the one\nfunction that accesses all parts of our\nbrain I'll give you all an example of\nthis neuroanatomy and function of human\nsexual behavior or neglected known issue\nso I was trying to figure out I tried to\nlook at like okay what part of the brain\ndoes pornography affect sexual behavior\nis regulated by both subcortical\nstructures such as the hypothalamus\nbrain stem spinal cord and several\ncortical brain areas acting as an\norchestra to finally adjust this\nprimitive complex and versatile Behavior\nchef's kiss of Neuroscience okay now\nlet's just look table one summary of the\nbrain areas involved in Su human sexual\nbehavior basically all of them the\nreward system okay like basically your\nhome whole brain wait wait it gets\nbetter neurotransmitters and modulators\nsummary of the main neurotransmitters\nand modulators involved in regulating\nhuman sexual behavior basically all of\nthem see like for example when we look\nat alcohol addiction we literally have\npills you can take for alcohol addiction\nthings like Naltrexone and what nalone\ndoes is it goes to the area where the\nalcohol binds to a receptor in your\nbrain and it blocks that binding so we\ncan literally give you a pill that will\nblock the effect of alcohol in the brain\nwe also have medications like like\nduliram so dulam is a devious medication\nwhen we drink alcohol there are two\nsteps in the metabolism of alcohol I\nthink we turn it first into an acetal\nalahh or something like that and then we\nturn it into whatever the final product\nis so the interesting thing is that\nalcohol that middle step so it gets\nturned in from A to B and B to C okay a\nis okay C is okay but B is toxic as [ __ ]\nso we give a medication that blocks the\nconversion from B to C and then this\nmetabolite builds up and makes people\nviolently ill so if you take your Dulan\npill and you drink alcohol you will be\nviolently ill so we can do this when it\ncomes to a substance we can like\nliterally give you a pill that will make\nyou ill if you drink alcohol but when it\ncomes to pornography it affects the\nwhole brain all of the neurotransmitter\nand so it's hard to like fix it just\nlike this and that's why the treatment\nfor treatment over coming pornography\naddiction is so much more holistic right\nit it involves emotional regulation\nfinding purpose finding meaning\nhopefully having a a healthy sexual\nrelationship another thing that we\nunderstand about pornography is that\nit's not even about sex it's not about\nrelationships or lust or anything like\nthat many of the people I've worked with\nwith pornography addiction I don't know\nabout the majority usually get exposed\nto pornography prepuberty so even before\ntheir brain knows they're not aroused by\nit at all they get this super normal\nstimulus in their developing brains\nwhich then shapes their brain to be\nvulnerable to pornography later in life\nand we know for example that marijuana\nis a gateway drug why is it a gateway\ndrug because it Alters the parts of our\nbrain that then become more vulnerable\nto addiction so it Alters the structure\nof our reward circuitry and once you\nalter the structure of your reward\ncircuitry now you can have a huge\nvulnerability to addiction which is what\nwe see in marijuana in developing brains\nand so with pornography this is what\ntends to happen I've noticed that the\nmore the younger you are when you get\nexposed to pornography appears that the\nhigher the risk is although I don't have\ndata to back that up that's just\nclinical practice Tober nil is saying I\nfeel like I'm doomed okay so here's the\nthing to understand you're not doomed\nbut fixing a pornography addiction in my\nopinion for a fair number of people okay\nso this isn't an absolute involves\nfixing your life so in a sense it is\nsolvable and some people get really\nupset by that they're like I have to fix\nmy whole life like sort of yeah on the\nflip side having fixing pornography\naddiction as your main quest in life\nwill necessitate that all of the things\nthat everybody else is doing as a main\nquest become side quests now they be\nthey become boxes to check that you need\nto do in order to fix the pornography\naddiction Find meaning find purpose\nbuild a career get physically healthy go\nto the gym so as you chase this\ninsurmountable goal every other part of\nyour life will fall in order because\nthat's what it takes to overcome and so\nit's it's actually like really\ninteresting because I've seen people\nwith pornography addiction the process\nof overcoming their addiction means that\nthey square away every corner of their\nlife there's also a karmic perspective\nthat sometimes I've had discussions with\nmy patients about because I'll ask them\nabout this kind of stuff right because\nit's about meaning so why do you think\nyou were given this addiction and\nthey'll kind of say that until I really\nfixed every corner of my life like it\nalways came back it was a signal to me\nfrom the universe that I'm not living my\nlife in the right way and then once I\nstarted living my life the right way the\npornography addiction got fixed\nliterally these are my patient words not\nmine then even if I did it 80% I would\nrelapse so I needed to really give it\n100% And then they'll tell me the\nweirdest thing pornography addiction is\nthe best thing that ever happened to me\nand now I understand this because then\nI'll ask them well what what what makes\nyou feel that way help me understand how\nyou arrived to that conclusion and he's\nlike this has really made me realize\nwhat I appreciate about life and like\nhow important these things are and like\nwhat kind kind of life I want to live\nright there's all this dopaminergic\nemotional regulation crap which is a\nfalse life it's not a real life it's an\nempty life and then in the process of\ngetting rid of that I've had to build\nrelationships I've had to be comfortable\nin my body I've had to do all kinds of\nother things right so we have a we have\na guide someone saying that this reminds\nme of my trauma so this is a huge\nperspective that's very important for\ntrauma we've done lectures and stuff on\npost-traumatic growth which yall can\ncheck out we have a guide coming up I\nguess I'm spoiling it sort of so I just\nfinished filming a guide where we dig\ninto all this kind of more spiritual\n[Music]\nstuff"
