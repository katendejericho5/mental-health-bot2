    "transcript": "so the more negative emotion we are\ndealing with the more vulnerable we are\nto dopaminergic signals from the nucleus\nincumbents so if you sort of think about\nit this kind of makes sense right the\nworse we feel if I'm feeling depressed\nif I'm feeling anxious I'm more\nvulnerable to dopaminergic activities\nbecause what we know is that dopamine\nbasically shuts off negative emotion and\nnegative emotion induces cravings for\ndopamine because we feel bad when we\nhave negative emotions right and if we\nfeel bad when we have negative emotions\nhow does our brain know how to make\nourselves feel better Ah that's right we\nhave this thing called dopamine and if\nwe release dopamine we will induce more\npleasure so what do we see in Psychiatry\nespecially with things like addiction\nPsychiatry so what we tend to find is\nthat people who are addicted tend to\nhave a lot of negative pent up emotions\nand as long as you have negative pent up\nemotions your vulnerability to dopamine\nsignals will increase"
