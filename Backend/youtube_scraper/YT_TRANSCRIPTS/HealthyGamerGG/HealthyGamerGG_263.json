    "transcript": "so when a relationship is the most\nimportant thing to you oh my god\nrelationships are the most important\nthing to me oh my God I like I need it\nthis is what they mean to me they they\nthey mean that there's love and there's\ncommitment and there's like someone on\nyour team all the time someone there for\nyou whenever you need it and then you\nhave this idea of oh my God like this\nrelationship with this beautiful what a\nbeautiful relationship and then some\nunlucky human being has to pick up that\nmantle some unlucky human being with\nflaws is now trying to interact with you\nbut you're not interacting with them\nbecause you have a preconceived idea of\nwhat the relationship should be this is\nwhat I want I need all of these things\nfrom Rel and then some human just a\nhuman just a person is like I don't know\nhow to handle this like I can't make\nthis person happy so they feel all of\nthat pressure and it pushes them away so\nparadoxically the first thing that you\nneed to do if relationships are the most\nimportant thing in the world to you is\nmake them less important"
