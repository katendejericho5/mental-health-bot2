    "transcript": "so at the beginning we seek particular\nthings and we get some amount of\nhappiness for some amount of time but\nit's never enough right we see this a\nlot with the content creators that we\nwork with I have 100,000 subscribers oh\nmy God go you are you happy now no I\nneed 200,000 are you happy with 200,000\nno this person they just came on the\nscene and they've been streaming for 6\nmonths I've been streaming for 2 years\nand they have 180,000 and I have 200,000\nI even have more than them but I'm still\nunhappy so this is the problem with\nfulfilling desires and chasing your\nwants is that it's never enough it is\nthe nature of a want to be temporary and\nthe satisfaction of a want to be\ntemporary how long does the happiness\nfrom the perfect wedding last we have\nall these Bridezillas and groom zillas\nnow right I want this I want this I want\nthis and even though you ruin all your\nrelationships and you go into debt to\nget your perfect wedding what happens a\nmonth later 6 months later so wants are\ntemporary"
