    "transcript": "so the main thing that we can do to\nboost our Charisma is to be more\nauthentic so if we sort of think about\nlet's say things that are naturally\nattractive so let's say like there's a\ncampfire okay and if you sort of think\nabout a campfire it's very inviting\nright it's like warm it's cheery it's\ncrackly it looks cool it's like fire bro\nand it's also like it feels good to like\nsit next to it right so we're sort of\nnaturally attracted to campfires so how\ndo we have other people be naturally\ndrawn towards us we have to be authentic\nand why is that it's because when people\ncan't trust us they will not be\nattracted to us and at the same time the\nmore that you can develop that\nauthenticity the more people will be\ndrawn towards you right because they\nknow what they're going to get and the\nprimary concern that so many people have\nin the world right now is that you can't\ntrust people so if you are one of the\npeople that people can actually trust\nthat's going to be a huge chunk of\ncharisma"
