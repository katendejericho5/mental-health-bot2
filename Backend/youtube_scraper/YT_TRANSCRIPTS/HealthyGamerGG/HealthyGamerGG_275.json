    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nboost your resistance to\n[Music]\ndopamine the basic struggle that most of\nus have today is that we should be doing\nsome things like studying or working on\nour resume or exercising but our brain\nwants to do something else it wants to\ndo dope and energic things like play\nvideo games watch pornography Doom\nscroll take your pick of technological\naddiction and the problem is that we\nstruggle to control this part of our\nbrain but that doesn't work because the\npart of your brain that wants these dope\nenergic activities actually is the part\nof your brain that controls you so this\nis sort of best described by this old\nSoviet Russian meme so I don't know if\nyall have heard this but you know these\nmemes back in the day about in Soviet\nRussia you do not watch television\ntelevision watches you so in our brain\nthe way that this kind of works is in\nSoviet Russia or in the current digital\nage you do not control dopamine dopamine\ncontrols you I want to want to take a\nmoment to thank the sponsor of today's\nvideo Babel Babel is the top language\nlearning app worldwide and I really love\nit because I'm actually learning Spanish\nafter I've been using it for about 2\nmonths so right now for example I'm\nlearning common conversational phrases\nthat I can string together to actually\nhave a conversation\nlike which means twice a week or Al\nwhich means three times a month and\nthat's what I really love about the app\nis they make learning very very easy and\naccessible and they use certain\nscientific methods that actually have\nyou being the most proficient in the\nshortest amount of time so I can't\nrecommend Babel enough and it's awesome\nthat they're giving us 60% off of their\nsubscription if you check out the link\nin the description below so thank you to\nBabel for keeping mental health content\non the internet free and actually\nteaching human beings how to communicate\nwith each other so we have to understand\nthis so you have one part of your brain\ncalled the nucleus succumbent and when\nwe're talking about dopamine this is the\npart of our brain that we're talking\nabout so the the nucleus accumbent\nbasically generates motivation for us\nand the way that it does that is through\nusing dopamine as a signal so when we\nget motivated towards something and we\nengage in that behavior we get this\ntriggering of dopamine which gives us a\nsense of pleasure and results in\nbehavioral reinforcement the problem is\nthat you can't really directly control\nthis circuit because this circuit is\nwhat generates your wants and\nmotivations so you can't kind of\nmotivate yourself to not be motivated by\nPleasure able things if that kind of\nmakes sense it's the part of your brain\nthat generates your motivation instead\nwhat we need to do is utilize the other\nparts of our brain to reduce the power\nof our nucleus accumbent so when it\ncomes to a behavioral action there's the\nmotivational drive from the nucleus\naccumbent but then there are all these\nother parts of our brain that influence\nthat motivational drive and this is sort\nof what I've learned as an addiction\npsychiatrist this is kind of our bread\nand butter is that we work with people\npeople whose nucleus accumbent in dopam\nenergic circuitry is in full control of\ntheir brain so we have people who will\ndo things like pick up a bottle of of\nbeer let's say and I the moment I get my\nfirst sip even though there are parts of\nmy brain that are screaming at me put it\ndown put it down put it down you can't\ncontrol it you're going to get divorced\nyou're going to get fired you're going\nto get thrown in jail your whole brain\nis screaming at you but you cannot\ncontrol it because once the nucleus\naccumbens gets a taste of that alcohol\nyou lose all control so let's start with\nthe nucleus accumbent okay so the first\nthing is that our nucleus accumbens is\nhas this pile of dopamine in it and\nlet's just go over a quick overview of\nof kind of what the nucleus succumbent\ndoes so anytime we engage in an action\ndepending on what the results of that\naction are we will get a release of\ndopamine and then this dopamine results\nin pleasure now when we receive pleasure\nfrom this action we are going to go back\nand we are going to reinforce the action\nonce we do this then this will create a\nmotivation to\nengage in the action again okay so\nbasically there's some kind of initial\nexperience with something which results\nin dopamine and pleasure which then\ncreates behavioral reinforcement and\nimproves motivation so the first thing\nthat we're going to talk about is how\nthings like dopamine detox actually move\nus in the wrong direction so in order to\ndo what we want we actually want a large\namount of dopamine available in our\nbrain so I know that sounds very\ncontrary to popular thinking but let's\ntake a quick look at some research on it\nhere is a study that looks at rats and\ndopamine depletion so what we've got\nhere is we have lever presses which is\nthe action and we have two kinds of rats\nwe have our control rats and what we\nsort of see is that the control rats\nover time will engage in lots of lever\npresses and then we also have something\ncalled dopamine depleted rats and what\nwe tend to see is that when you get rid\nof dopamine in the brain you actually\nengage in less and less action so the\nnucleus accumbens dopamine and\nregulation of effort in food seeking\nBehavior implications for studies of\nnatural motivation Psychiatry and drug\nabuse now here's the sentence that we're\ngoing to focus on a cin dopamine that's\nda may be important for enabling rats to\novercome behavioral constraints\nsuch as work rated response costs and\nmay be critical for Behavioral\norganization and conditioning processes\nthat enable animals to engage in\nvigorous responses such as barrier\nclimbing or em emit large numbers of\nresponses okay so this is kind of\ncomplicated but let me explain what this\nmeans this basically says the more\ndopamine we have the easier it is to\nengage in something called sustained\neffort now this may sound kind of weird\nbut let's understand understand this\nokay if you look at our our body this is\nwhat happens we wake up and we've got a\nton of dopamine and then our body has\nthe system called homostasis and so what\nthis means is if we engage in some kind\nof action right so let's take an action\nand we've got a ton of dopamine what\nthis means is that if we engage in an\naction we've got a lot of dopamine a lot\nof dopamine comes out because we've got\na ton of it right so our brain is just\nlike the way you are with your bank\naccount where if you've got a bunch of\nmoney you can afford to spend some\nbecause you've got a a bunch left so\nafter we engage in some kind of action\nwe lose some dopamine but we we kind of\nspend dopamine and then the action\nremember the more dopamine we release\nthis action gets\nreinforced okay so this is totally fine\nso as we use some dopamine you know\nthat's fine we have some left we can\ntake another action and we'll deplete\nsome more dopamine right totally fine\nand then eventually what happens is we\nrun out of dopamine and once we run out\nof dopamine then we have a slight\nproblem because now our bank account is\nempty so now in order to get dopamine\nout right now that we're kind of we've\nsqueeze the lemon dry we need to engage\nin highly\ndopaminergic activities so now that our\nreserve of dopamine has run out we need\nsomething so think about it like a a\nlemon that you're squeezing the juice\nout of right so the more you squeeze at\nthe very beginning you can squeeze very\nlittle and you can get a lot of juice\nout but at the very end you need\nsomething very very powerful\nto squeeze to squeeze out the remaining\njuice so the more dopaminergic the\nactivity the less dopamine you need to\nengage in the activity so when we look\nat things like video games these are\nhighly dopaminergic and I don't know if\nthis kind of makes sense to you but when\nyou feel really tired and you don't feel\nmotivated and you don't feel like doing\nanything when you're exhausted and you\ndon't want to have fun you just kind of\nsitting around doing nothing what are\nthe only actions that you can take what\nare the actions that are the easiest to\ntake the lower your energy level is the\neasier it is to engage in dopaminergic\nactivities because these will squeeze\nout the last bit of dopamine that is\nleft in your brain because they're very\npowerful pulls of dopamine now if we\nengage in actions like video\ngames uh let's go down here so if we\nengage in let's say we start out our\nday and we engage in an action like a\nvideo game now remember this is a\npowerful squeeze so now we have a full\nlemon and we are squeezing very tightly\nwhat's going to happen to our dop\nenergic signal we're going to actually\nempty our whole swath of dopamine\nbecause we've got a full lemon and we\nhave a powerful squeeze and then we have\nno dopamine left over for other things\nthis is what this rat study essentially\nshows that if you want to engage in\nsustained effort with low rewards we\nneed to have a lot of dopamine in\nreserve okay so this is something that a\nlot of people don't get but what we\nreally need to do is understand that the\nmoment you engage in a high dopaminergic\nactivity at the beginning of the day\nyou're going to exhaust all your\ndopamine and you literally will have\nnothing left for the sustained effort of\nthe things that you want to do and y'all\nmay have noticed this in your own life\nright so when you wake up and you play\nvideo games for 6 hours between 8:00\na.m. and 2:00 p.m. how motivated are you\nat the end of that time and then flip it\naround let's say we wake up in the\nmorning and we work for 4 hours how\nmotivated are you how many how much\nvideo games can you play after 4 hours\nof work so this is the first important\nthing to understand we do not want to\nget rid of our dopamine we actually want\na high level of dopamine so that when we\nengage in low dopaminergic activities we\nstill get a strong dopamine response and\nas we get a strong dopamine response\nright because there's a lot of dopamine\nin our brains we are going to reinforce\nthe action and in increase our\nmotivation to engage in the action so\nthe tldr for this is that dopamine isn't\nbad it's actually what causes behavioral\nreinforcement and this is why it is very\nimportant to do productive stuff first\nthing in the morning so do not even pick\nup your phone for one hour after you get\nup wake up and start doing something\nanything try to avoid avoid technology\nusage or especially the dop and energic\nTechnology usage for at least 4 hours\nideally at the beginning of the day but\ndon't touch your phone for 1 hour as you\ndo this you will have lots of dopamine\nand then you will be able to engage\nliterally in sustained effort right so\nlet's go back to this so this is an\nexperiment where we have lab Chow which\nis like crappy food okay that is very\nvery easy to access and then what the\nrat can do is jump up here and then end\nup eating this tasty Chow so this is\nlike better Chow but requires more\neffort and when we have a dopamine\nintact Mouse what we find is the mouse\ngoes over here jumps on here and eats\nthe tasty Chow okay so this is harder to\nget and then what happens is if we have\na dopamine depleted rat the rat is too\nlazy to even get the thing that is good\nfor it that it likes more and this is a\nbeautiful example of what goes on in\nmost people's lives we know that there\nare things that we should end up doing\nbut we are too lazy to do them and every\ntime we do them we're like damn this was\nreally great I'm so glad I did this and\nit turns out that the reason that we\ncan't engage in the stuff that is good\nfor us is actually because we're\ndepleted in dopamine so conserve your\ndopamine and try to use it at the very\nbeginning of the day in whatever\nproductive activities you have the cool\nthing is that kind of going back to our\niPad drawing what we see is that any\naction even something like cleaning your\nroom if we have a large reserve of\ndopamine will generate dopamine and\nbehavioral reinforcement so let's talk\nabout our second part of the brain so\nhere's the nucleus accumbens and now\nwe're going to talk about the amydala\nand the limic system so this system is\nvery important for dopamine\nvulnerability so the more negative\nemotion we are dealing with the more\nvulnerable we are to dopam energic\nsignals from the nucleus accumbent so\nthese two parts of the brain talk to\neach other a lot there are a lot of\nconnections between the nucleus\naccumbens and the amydala so if you sort\nof think about it this kind of makes\nsense right the worse we feel if I'm\nfeeling depressed if I'm feeling anxious\nI'm more vulnerable to dopaminergic\nactivities because what we know is that\ndopamine basically shuts off negative\nemotion and negative emotion induces\ncravings for dopamine because we feel\nbad when we have negative emotions right\nand if we feel bad when we have negative\nemotions what does our brain how does\nour brain know how to make ourselves\nfeel better Ah that's right we have this\nthing called dopamine and if we release\ndopamine we will induce more pleasure so\nwhat do we see as in Psychiatry\nespecially with things like addiction\nPsychiatry so what we tend to find is\nthat people who are addicted tend to\nhave a lot of negative pent up emotions\nand as long as you have negative pent up\nemotions your vulnerability to dopamine\nsignals will increase on the converse\nside when we do things like\nPsychotherapy and we end up reducing our\nnegative emotion our resistance to\ndopaminergic signals actually improves\nso what we really want to do if yall are\nstruggling to control your motivation\nand you're not motivated to do what you\nshould you should really start to work\non your negative emotions so we can do\nall kinds of emotional processing\nactivities this can be things like\ntherapy or journaling meditation right\nand some of y'all may be saying okay so\nDr K you just saying that I should\njournal and meditate and go to therapy\noh my God you've said a million times oh\nmy God yes but this is the main thing to\nunderstand it's not about engaging these\nactivities because they're good for you\nright so this is once again we'll get to\nValue generation in a second but the the\nthing to understand is that if you want\nto be able to control your dopamine\ncircuitry you have to understand what\nthe inputs are and understand that the\nmore depressed you are the more anxious\nyou are the more you will wind up\naddicted to dopaminergic stuff so you\nmust deal with those negative emotions\nand the cool thing is that as you start\ndealing with these negative emotions and\nyou can do something as simple as taking\na walk right you can just go for a walk\nfor about an hour and a lot of these\nnegative emotions will start to process\nthemselves automatically as you go\nthrough this stuff you will be amazed at\nhow much you are able to resist the\ndopaminergic impulse as long as your\nemotions get taken care of you go for\nthree walks a week for one hour a week I\nmean one hour a day right so you do that\nthree times and you'll be amazed that\nyou'll be 20% more resistant to the\neffects of dopaminergic activities the\nnext circuit that we're going to talk\nabout is the prefrontal c\nso the prefrontal cortex is part of our\nfrontal loes and our frontal loes are\nwhat generate things like willpower\nright so when we do things like meditate\nthe frontal loes are basically what\ncontrol the other parts of our brain so\nthat if you're feeling really really\nemotional and there's this voice in your\nbrain that says Get It Together buddy\nlet's calm down we need to focus or if\nyou're trying to study and so your brain\nis like instead of getting distracted\nlet's focus that's all done by your\nfrontal loes but that's hard right and\nthe one thing that we're going to focus\non today we're not going to do hard\nthings we're going to teach you easy\nthings to improve your resistance to\ndopamine so the other thing that the uh\nprefrontal cortex does is generate value\nassessments so anytime you're thinking\nabout doing an action your brain has\nsome idea of what the action is worth\nright what the value of the action is\nfor example when we have something like\nstudying or gaming each of these have a\nvalue and now we may think that the\nvalue of studying is greater than the\nvalue of gaming but if on a given day\nyou choose to game or you lose control\nand you end up gaming instead of\nstudying what that literally means is\nthat the value generated by Gaming in\nthis subconscious part of your brain\nit's not intellectual this is what it's\nactually observed okay this is some\nweird subconscious part it is doing a\nsubconscious calculation about the value\nof gaming versus the value of studying\nand this is literally what drives our\nBehavior the result of the subconscious\naction and this sub conscious value\nassessment is done by the prefrontal\ncortex so what we need to do is do a\nconscious value assessment and there's\none really really simple way to do that\nso this isn't something like I know this\nyou may think okay like I just think\nabout it I know studying is better like\nI know that like but I just can't\nmotivate myself no no you don't\nunderstand if you are motivated to not\nstudy that means that your subconscious\nvalue judgment is going to the nucleus\naccumbent and telling it to game instead\nof study that's literally what's\nhappening and there are some moments\neven if you sort of think about it right\nso if we kind of and this is a\nconstantly ongoing process so why do we\nstudy one day before the test because\nour subconscious value judgment is today\nwe can game tomorrow we can game on day\nthree we can game on day four we can\ngame and then the subconscious value\njudgment changes on Thursday morning\nwhen you wake up and you have a final\nexam on Friday now the subconscious\nvalue judgment changes and if you sort\nof stop and examine yourself you'll see\nthis now you start to panic now the\nconsequences are big now it becomes very\nimportant to start studying the\nsubconscious value judgment has changed\nso this is what's really cool we can\ntake that last minute Panic we can take\nthat last minute motivation and we can\nbring it up a couple of days we can\ngenerate that motivation earlier if we\ndo a conscious value assessment and\nthere is one really simple way to start\ndoing this we use this a ton in\naddiction Psychiatry works really well\nit's called play the tape through to the\nend this is what we're going to do we're\ngoing to play the tape through to the\nend okay so what does this mean this\nmeans that you should sit down with a\npiece of paper you can't do it in your\nhead because in your head your mind will\njump to all kinds of stuff you have to\nsit down ideal with a piece of paper\ndon't use a technological device and\nwalk through the actions that you're\ngoing to take and what the consequences\nof those actions are going to be like so\nif I wake up at 8: a.m. and I study what\nwhat's happen next what's going to\nhappen at 9:00 a.m. what's going to\nhappen at 10: a.m. what's going to\nhappen at 11: a.m. and then how am I\ngoing to feel at 5:00 p.m. and I study\nfor at least 2 or three hours versus if\nI game right now what's going to happen\nat 9:00 a.m. what's going to happen at\n10: a.m. how am I going to feel at 5:00\np.m. your mind will tell you oh we'll do\nit later but stop and really play the\ntape through to the end are you going to\ndo it later when what's actually going\nto happen and when you force your mind\nto slow down and you play the tape\nthrough to the end if I start drinking\ntoday what's actually going to happen\nwhat do I know is going to happen even\nthough this may not instantly boost your\nwillpower you may sort of find that at\nthe end of this exercise you end up\ngaming anyway and that's actually okay\nbecause what we've done is change your\nsubconscious thinking a little bit now\nthe price of gaming there's a part of\nyou that feels a little bit more guilty\nat the end of this exercise right you\nend up gaming anyway but it's not quite\nas mindless as it used to be you're like\nholy I really shouldn't do this but\nokay fine whatever today is fine so even\nthere is a small subconscious shift and\nas you play the tape through to the end\nover and over and over again your value\nassessment will change okay so the next\nthing we're going to talk about is super\nfascinating and this is the hippocampus\nso the hippocampus is our memory circuit\nthis is where our memories live so\nthere's one thing that's really\nimportant to understand when the\nhippocampus has a strong influence on\nthe nucleus succumbent but there are\nsome things that the hippocampus loves\nand some things that the hippocampus\nhates so this is important to remember\nthe hippocampus values novelty so if\nsomething is new for you it will\nactually trigger a stronger motivational\nimpulse so if you are trying to do\nsomething like study or let's let's take\nthe case of exercise and it is hard for\nyou to exercise if you are trying to\nexercise instead of playing video games\nand you've tried to exercise before the\nhippocampus will say hey we've tried\nthis before it doesn't work well we\ndon't really enjoy exercise so let's end\nup gaming if you want to start\nexercising the key thing that you need\nto do is add novelty to the mix so if\nyou try a different kind of exercise\nlet's go to Pilates let's go to yoga\nlet's go to taichi let's work out with\nfriends let's do high-intensity interval\ntraining let's join this workout group\nwith dudes or with women or whatever the\nmore novelty you can add that if you're\ntrying to do something again the more it\nwill increase your motivation and\nTrigger that sort of positive dopamine\nresponse so if you failed at trying to\ndo something like going to the gym to\nwork out I've tried going to the gym\nI've tried going to the gym going to the\ngym utilize your hippocampus circuitry\nand just try something new the more\ndifferent it is the easier it will be to\ntry and this is something that the\ngaming industry understands very well\nright they understand that games are old\nand old games are boring and how do we\nencourage people to play this game again\nwe add new stuff we add new stuff we add\nnew stuff so novelty triggers motivation\nso anything that you're trying to do\nwhether it's cooking exercising studying\nwhatever try to add some novelty to the\nmix and it will be easier to do the next\ncircuit we're going to talk about is\nactually the opioid circuit so this\ninvolves the MU receptor and the Kappa\nreceptor so this is interesting because\nwhen we're all talking about dopamine\nwe're obsessed with dopamine motivation\npleasure all this kind of stuff but\nremember that the whole brain works as a\ncircuit things are connected right and\nit turns out that the opioid endogenous\nopioids and the opioid receptors are\nvery powerful influencers of our\npleasure circuitry and it turns out that\npain and pleasure are actually very\ntightly linked and and control one\nanother literally so I'll give you all a\nsimple example of this let's say that\nyou're playing a video game and it's a\nstomp so when you stomp in a video game\nhow fun is it chances are it's less fun\nthan if the game was very very hard\nright if I'm losing at the beginning and\nthen my team makes a comeback the\ndopamine rush I get is huge so this is\nsomething very important understand that\npain correlates with pleasure so as we\ncan increase the pain from a particular\nactivity the pleasure that we will get\nfrom that activity actually\nincreases so you can sort of notice this\nas well when we kind of think a little\nbit about like things like working out\nright so if we half ass when we work out\nlike if we half ass it and it's just a\nlot of pain and there's not what ends up\nhappening is we avoid the pain and when\nyou half ass working out you actually\navoid the pain minimize the pain and\nthen it turns out that we have less\nreinforcement but instead if we sort of\nthink about working out right let's say\nI'm like doing a bench press or\nsomething like that and I can do six\nreps of the bench press without too much\nproblem but it's in that seventh rep in\nthat eighth rep that I sort of feel that\nburn this is what Arnold Schwarzenegger\ncalls the PMP right as I feel that pump\nthat those are the hard ones and those\nare the ones that make me feel really\ngood at the end of it so it's it's that\nlast pain painful part that actually\npositively reinforces our Behavior so\nthis is where we've got to be super\ncareful because a lot of times when we\nare engaging in dopam energic activities\nor our nucleus succumbent is running the\nshow we have a ton of avoidance of pain\nand instead what we want to try to do is\nadd some pain to the mix to influence\nour dopaminergic circuitry we also have\nreally interesting evidence of this\nwhich is that if you want to reduce\nCravings we have a medication called\nNaltrexone and what Nal actually does is\nblocks some of these opioid receptors or\npartially blocks them it's not a full\nblockade and so it it kind of interferes\nwith our ability to engage in pleasure\nfrom dopam energic activities now I know\nthat's not exactly what we're talking\nabout here but we certainly know from\nthings like\nnxone that the opioid receptors and the\nopioid system in the dopaminergic system\nthe nucleus acumin are very tightly\nlinked so the way that we want to\nutilize our opioid system is first of\nall don't retreat from pain we want the\nright amount of pain we want a balance\nof pain so we want something that is\nmoderately painful or mildly painful\nwhich will make that we can still\ncomplete so we don't want to have pain\nto the point of stopping the activity\nright so if something is too painful our\nbrain will actually say this is not\nworth it so this is where I think\nworking out is really like perfect and\npeople sort of figured this out right\nthey said you should do the the weight\nthat makes you feel the burn in the\nseventh rep the eighth rep the last\ncouple reps should be painful but you\nshould be able to do it and that's\nliterally what we're kind of shooting\nfor so you want to add some pain to the\nmix which will increase your resistance\nto the dopamine system and this is\nsomething that I think people like David\ngoggin has turned this into a lifestyle\nright so he's somehow figured out a way\nto use pain to increase his motivation\nis what I've heard I've never talked to\nthe guy and so this is it's actually\nvery consistent with our understanding\nof Neuroscience so let's summarize the\nproblem\nis that the nucleus succumbent\ngenerates motivation and once it\ngenerates\nmotivation that's what we want to do\nright this is what creates our want now\nthis is a problem because if we have\ncreated a want then it's very hard to\ncontrol it and our whole life is a\nstruggle about wanting to want different\nthings so instead what we're going to do\nsince we can't create the wants that we\nwant right so you don't get to pick what\nyour desires are instead what we're\ngoing to do is utilize other circuits of\nthe brain to weaken the strength of our\nnucleus accumbent to weaken this ability\nof the nucleus accumbent to control our\nbehaviors and we're going to use other\ncircuits of the brain we're going to use\namydala because our amydala makes us\nvulnerable to dopamine we're going to\nuse our prefrontal cortex and change the\nway that we\nconsciously demonstrate value we're also\ngoing to use our mu receptor an opioid\nsystem because if we can add some pain\ninto the mix it will change the way that\nwe experience pleasure we're also going\nto use our\nhippocampus to add novelty to the mix\nand so if you have some kind of goal\nthat you don't feel motivated to do the\nmore novel you can make it the more your\nmotivation will increase and lastly\nwe're going to be super careful about\nour dopamine\nreserves and we're going to remember\nthat in order to exhibit sustained\neffort we require dopamine we need lots\nof reserves of dopamine and that the\nmore dopamine you have the easier it is\nto release a higher amount of dopamine\nfor a less pleasurable activity and the\nbiggest mistake that you can make is\ndepleting your dopamine at the beginning\nof the day because then what you need is\nyou need something very very\ndopaminergic to squeeze the remainder of\nthe juice out so the last thing that I\nwant to share with y'all is that if we\nlook at the brain there's one very\nfundamental principle one part of the\nbra brain cannot control itself so if we\nsort of think about let's say we get\nemotional the part of our brain that\nexperiences emotion can't restrain\nitself we need other parts of the brain\nto control our emotional circuitry right\nso we we'll use something like our\nfrontal loes and we'll say hey bro you\nneed to calm down or hey girl you need\nto calm down I need to take a step back\nI need to take a deep breath that's your\nfrontal loes controlling your amygdala\nand your lyic system so then the\nquestion becomes how do we control our\nvery motivational circuitry and the\nproblem is that we've gotten so obsessed\nwith Will willpower and habits and\nthings like that that we've stopped\nlooking at the inputs to our\nmotivational circuitry and once you\nunderstand the inputs to your\nmotivational circuitry what you will\ndiscover is that you can control your\nmotivational circuitry by using these\nother things so definitely give this a\nshot and let us know how it works for\n[Music]\nyou\none"
