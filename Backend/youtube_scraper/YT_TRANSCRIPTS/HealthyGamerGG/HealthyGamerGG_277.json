righty chat let's get\nstarted welcome to another healthy gamer\nGG stream my name is Dr Alo kenoa just a\nreminder that although I am a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly\nis this\npre-recorded maybe if you're watching\nthis in the future but right now it is\nlive but at some point it will be\npre-recorded every moment except for now\nis going to be\npre-recorded right isn't that how it\nworks all right so welcome to another\nstream y'all we've got some exciting\nstuff today we have um let's see we we\nhave a couple of announcements to make\nuh and yeah and then today we're going\nto be talking\nabout um some dating virginity porn\naddiction stuff happy February everybody\nand then we also have some stuff about\nuh personality and meditation and\nspirituality so we're just going to\ntouch on a lot of different stuff so um\nrecently you know we've been a little\nbit busier over here and so I I really\nhave started to miss streaming I I\nthought that that would you know\neveryone's like oh my God like and even\nI felt that way too where I was like oh\nmy God like this is like too much and oh\nwe're okay right okay um because\nsometimes we have a problem with when we\nswitch profiles and it lags but it looks\nokay so yeah I'm I'm really excited to\njust like do what we used to do which is\nwe we've got some stuff from the\ninternet and we are going to talk about\nthings from the internet\nokay all right let's get\nstarted before we begin like I mentioned\nwe've been busy and it turns\nout that we crossed 2 million\nsubscribers on YouTube um and someone\nmade a post about it so I guess like you\nknow we started this out a couple years\nago on Twitch and it was you know\ntiny there were like 20 people hanging\naround and now about 4 years later we're\nlike you know watched by millions of\npeople every month month and so here's a\nshout out to AOE healing um and I I want\nto just remind yall that like we can't\ndo this without you right so even though\nit's my face and you're seeing my face\non the screen like as we're going to\ndiscover today it it's it's not just\nabout Dr K it's about everybody else who\nwe're going to be talking to I feel like\nI can't recover from my pain every\nFriday in a nutshell I think I will\nnever have a girlfriend I think you're\nwrong and I'm pretty hopeful for you you\nangry face right so we're going to be\ntalking about that stuff but this is\nthis is the community that y'all built\nso like we literally could not do this\nwithout\nyou um couple things the other thing\nthat I want to mention is that you know\nI I don't think a lot of people realize\nlike what our operation is but this is\nthis is like the\nteam and um you know like some of some\npeople have been here like so I don't\nknow if you guys know this but Hannah\nactually made made our original emotes\nfor the twitch channel uh people like\nLindsay Kabir and Brandon were our\noriginal mods on like twitch um and\nthere's just a ton of people that you\nknow y'all don't see very much but we've\ngot a huge team and they're really the\nones that make this happen I just talk\nto y'all for like six to eight hours a\nweek and everything else is absolutely\nlike these people um so yeah like so if\nyou guys like you know what we put\ntogether uh you know Zach is really\nresponsible for like helping our our\ncontent grow um Kabir does a lot too for\ncontent and sort of like merging content\nin community so really like a lot of\nthis stuff is is due to not me and I\njust kind of wanted to point that out so\nwe look at this and we're like oh my God\nthis is such an accomplishment\ncongratulations Dr K and it's like I I\ndidn't make that happen like everybody\nelse made that happen right so I can't I\ncan't sign up for something two million\ntimes and make it happen that's\nliterally all I can do is offer one\nsub um so just huge shout out to\neverybody for making this happen and I\nmean that I'm not just saying that it's\nlike really like you know I wake up and\nI used to teach in front of groups of\nlike 12 to 15 people and now I just do\nit in front of a couple hundred thousand\nto a few million so I haven't changed\nthe big thing that's changed is the way\nthat this information gets disseminated\nthe way that even people like I don't\nknow if you guys saw Jacob but I mean\nJacob Finds Me dozens of Articles every\nweek so that we can make content that is\nvery um you know research\nbacked so like everything that we're\nputting together because we've in some\nways reached the limit of what I know so\nlike you know I have to do a lot more\nresearch um and interestingly enough\nwe've also like touched barely 10% of\nwhat I know because there's a whole lot\nother\nstuff um yeah so I'm just really\ngrateful to be able to be here like it's\nfun that this is my job like I'm very\nexcited and like it's fun right so it's\na it's a Monday morning at noon where I\nlive and I get to talk to the internet\nfor two hours about dating virginity and\npornography addiction let's\ngo um yeah so next thing uh before we\ndive in is so have y'all ever played\nDragon's\nDogma we got to talk about gaming for\njust a hot second and then we're going\nto dive into the\nposts\num like this game is\namazing\nuh yeah it's really\ncool you're like an anime Saga speaking\nof anime sagas holy I started watching\nblue-eyed\nSamurai and I remember I think chat\nrecommended it to me or Lindsay\nrecommended it to me I don't remember\nbut so Dragon's Dogma I think it kind of\nlike scoured Ed by like it was not a\nhuge game but it's so good oh my God\nit's so\ngood like it's hard to describe how they\ncapture like a really good feeling and I\nfeel like there's a lot of stuff going\non in the industry where half the\nindustry is moving in the wrong\ndirection and half the industry is\nmoving in the right direction but like\nsome of these games like dragon's dog\nbut I was listening to some like you\nknow quote from one of their de\ndevelopers where they were like are you\ngoing to include fast travel and he's\nlike no they're like but players don't\nlike traveling and he's like well if\nyour game is boring yeah then they're\nnot going to like traveling but Dragon's\nDogma is a lot of fun you get to run\naround and like random stuff happens and\nyou get ambushed it's it's a lot of\nfun\num okay\nyeah yeah magic feels and looks amazing\nthat's one of the things I love about I\nusually love playing Mages but it's it\nthey do a really good job of\nthe like qualitatively capturing\nmagic\num yeah I tried Red Dead Redemption 2 I\njust felt like it\nwas doing chores it's like we're going\nto do this like in real life where we've\ngot chores to\ndo and it's like okay hold on a second\nif I want to do chores I might as well\ndo chores IRL instead of doing chores on\na video game and then have chores left\nover um but maybe I need to give it\nanother shot so the same thing happened\nwith dragon Dogo where like I played it\nmany years ago and then I like left it\nalone I think I played it around the\ntime I started med school or something\nand then you know I got busy for a\ndecade\num yeah I played a little bit of frost\npunk I love Against The Storm which is\ninspired by Frost Punk Punk and then I\ntried to go back and play Frost Punk but\nit was it was a touch primitive after\nthe evolutions of\nATS\num okay so has stream just started\narguably it has been just starting for a\nfew minutes\nnow come to India Dr K I want to I want\nto maybe this year actually let's do it\nchat Dr K goes to India let's\ngo um okay shall we do real things what\ndo y all\nthink real things yes no\nchat okay let's take a look so today\nwhat we're GNA what we're going to do ah\nthere we go so today what we're going to\ndo is we're going to talk about dating\nvirginity pornography and relationships\nOkay so we've\ngot this kind of\nstuff um so we've got four posts on this\nand then we've got so I'm\nshamelessly stealing characteristics of\npeople I want to be like is it bad so\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nhow to develop a personality and\nidentity um and then meditation bringing\nup anger and disgust towards my father\nso we're going to talk a little bit\nabout\nmeditation and then why does everyone\ntalk about the egos if they're not the\nego that's doing talking what a great\nquestion super cool okay so let's get\nstarted since I was in my early teens\nsex dating and relationships were the\nmost important thing for me however\ndespite that fact somehow the years\npassed me by and I barely had any\nexperiences all the ones I did have were\nRel really negative and hurt me now\nalmost every time the topic comes up in\nmy life I feel a sort of pulling pain in\nthe middle of my chat\nthat is overwhelming and oh boy does it\ncome up regularly it's the in the movies\nbooks General pop culture and just\npretty much everywhere my friends talk\nabout the tons of experiences they had\nknow they are not lying all the time I'm\n23 and I now feel like nothing I can\nexperience in the future will be able to\noutweigh the pain that I already\nexperienced I just can't imagine\nanything that would justify the mental\nAgony I went through so far which might\nseem theatrical to some people but it is\nthe way that I feel maybe I'm just a\nsensitive person the disappointment with\nmyself for failing it the thing that has\nalways been the most important to me is\nsometimes crushing me I'd say I break\ndown because of it twice per month I've\nbeen in therapy for a year now okay\nstrong work hot G23 I mean that so today\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nhow what to\ndo if you care about\nsex relationships love and you have been\nunable to engage in sex relationships\nlove it can feel like a vicious cycle\nwhere you're kind of stuck or actually\nnot vicious cycle more like you get\ntrapped you fall behind and then you\ncan't ever fix things so today what\nwe're going to do is break this apart a\nlittle bit and hopefully give you all\nsome way to move\nforward so we're going to start by\ntaking some notes okay because there\nthere's a lot of things to understand\nhere so I'm going to start with this\nconcept of something called the Peter\nPrinciple and the Peter Principle is\nthis kind of principle from management\nthat says that everyone Rises to the\nlevel of their\nincompetence now this can be kind of\nconfusing but let's understand this so\nlet's say I work at a job and this is\njob number one and I excel at job number\none then what happens I get promoted to\nthe next tier\nand then I excel at the next tier and\nthen I get promoted to the next tier and\nnow I just do an average job right this\nis equivocal so I do not excel at which\npoint I stay over here so instead of\nhaving me occupy a job where I have\nexcellent\nperformance I'm occupying a place where\nI have mediocre performance so this is\nkind of an interesting observation that\nthey made in the world of business that\nbasically like if you look at a company\nthat has 500 employees\neveryone is like operating at a mediocre\nlevel because they've been promoted out\nof their best skill set now y'all may\nsay what does this have to do with this\ncase so here's kind of a weird kind of\nperspective right so if you have a\nproblem and you are stuck with that\nproblem for a long period of time and\nyou think you understand the problem\nthen chances are you actually don't\nunderstand the problem because the\nproblems that you correctly understand\nare the ones that you fix\nand the ones that you incorrectly\nunderstand will stay unfixable right\ndoes that kind of make sense so\nsometimes what happens is people will\nhave a problem for like 10 years and\nthey'll say this is an unfixable problem\nbecause it's been a problem for 10 years\nbut the reason it's been unfixable is\nbecause you've misunderstood it which\nactually means it is quite possible to\nfix it okay does that make sense I know\nit's kind of weird so one way to kind of\nthink about this in the field of\nMedicine is let's say I have a diagnosis\ndx1 and then dx1 has three treatment\noptions it has T1 T2 T3 right and let's\nsay treatment one doesn't work treatment\ntwo doesn't work treatment 3 doesn't\nwork and then you conclude that dx1 is\nunsolvable\nuncurable\nunfixable but it turns out that what you\nreally need to do to fix this problem is\nrecognize that this is a different\ndiagnosis you had a the wrong diagnosis\nand it turns out that you do T1 over\nhere and then this fixes the problem\nthis happens all the time in medicine\nthis is why a lot of people think that\nmedicine is about treatment medicine is\nnot just about treatment that's only\nhalf of it half of our training is in\ndiagnosing the problem\ncorrectly and so what I tend to see is\npeople will have challenges like this\nwhich I'm not saying these challenges\naren't real they are real and there's a\nlot that we're going to discover here\nthat is actually quite logical it's not\nlogical at all it's 100% logical but\njust because it's logical doesn't mean\nthat it is correct it just means that it\nis correct in a form so let's understand\nthis\nokay so first mistake number one since I\nwas in my early teens dating and\nrelationships were the most important\nthing for me however despite that fact\nthis is the first thing to understand\nimportance and\nsuccess because as we will discover\nsomething being really really important\nto you makes it much harder to succeed\nnot much easier okay years pass by and I\nbarely had any experiences all the ones\nI did have were really negative and hurt\nme lots or not some Lots let's use the\nword all okay all\nexperiences were\nbad\nhurtful okay now almost every time the\ntopic comes up I feel a pulling pain in\nthe middle of my\nchest that is really\noverwhelming um my friends talk about a\nton of experiences I'm 23 and I feel\nlike nothing I can experience in the\nfuture will ever outweigh what I've\nalready experienced okay so nothing will\nmake it\nbetter now people may look at this and\nthey may say oh my God this person has\nlost all hope they are wrong no they are\nnot wrong\nthey're not wrong at\nall if you are someone who has suffered\na lot and you think that nothing can\nmake it better you may be surprised how\nright you are but don't give up\nhope okay I just can't imagine anything\nthat would justify the mental Agony I\nwent through so far and you are\ncorrect justify the mental\nAgony okay which might see theatrical\nmaybe I'm a sensitive person don't do\nthat\nokay we're going to touch on\nthis I'm a\nsensitive person okay I'm taking notes\nI'll show you all in a second the\ndisappointment with myself for failing\nit the thing that had always been the\nmost important to me is sometimes\ncrushing me ah hold on a second hold on\na second hold on a second now we begin\nto see\nokay okay so here's the interesting\nthing here's the first thing that I'm\nI'm going to point out so because this\nis the most important thing for you\nfailing at it is crushing so this is\nvery important to understand okay now\nwe're going to get to\nit so here are our problems importance\nand success number one so a lot of\npeople assume that if something is\nreally important to you it makes it\neasier to be\nsuccessful but actually especially with\ndating having it be of hyper importance\nis one of the most negative things you\ncan do for your chances for\nSuccess so I'll give youall this isn't\njust dating this is other things as well\noh my God I'm terrified I have to do\nwell on this exam I have to do well on\nthis exam this exam is I have to do good\nI have to do good I have to do good I'm\nso stressed out about it I don't\nsleep I study for eight hours and I\nthink to myself oh my God this isn't\nenough other people know more than me I\nit has to be successful it has to be\nsuccessful I panic myself am I doing\nwell did I get that right did I get that\nwrong I have no confidence in my ability\nI second guess all of my answers on the\ntest and I end up getting a\nC+ the importance of a thing does not\nnecessarily improve its chances of\nsuccess and now we see a second problem\nwhen something is really important to\nyou okay which is that not only do you\nhave the original let's call it a\nfailure okay but now since you failed at\nsomething so there's just the failure\nitself let's say I I wasn't able to date\nokay that's bad but if this is the most\nimportant to me then what I have is a\nsecond part of crushing defeat that I\nhave failed at the thing that is the\nmost important to me that is actually\nindependent of the failure to date does\nthat make sense so there are two\ninjuries here number one is failure to\ndate and number\ntwo is\ncrushing\ndefeat because number\none okay so I know this sounds\ninsane but one thing you can do in this\nsituation is start to have this be less\nimportant to you and we'll talk about\nwhat that is okay so I'll give you all\nlike then people will say but I'm aren't\nI allowed to want what I want this is\nimportant to me and like this is how I\nam and I love it so much but hold on a\nback up a second okay so a couple of\nthings so I learned this the easy way so\nI got super lucky right I decided to\nbecome a monk so I had years and years\nof like\nI'd want to say five years of just\npathetic attempts to date and people\nwill say oh my God five years that's\nnothing I've had 20 years and it's not\nthe number of years that you have and\nthis is kind of what I discovered is\nthat there is a different way to do it\nif I had kept operating the same way I\nhad operated I would have gone 10 years\n15 years 20 years right A Broken Clock\nmay be right twice a day but it's wrong\nat all the other\ntimes so this is the this is how we need\nto approach dating so basically what I\ndid is decided to become a monk and then\nI no longer I gave up the importance of\ndating this is not for me and\nparadoxically this helped me become more\nattractive because I was so caught up in\nmy own\nstuff that it was like stressing people\nout and I wasn't my best self and all\nthis other stuff that people talk about\nin dating so let's talk a little bit\nabout how to make dating less\nimportant now the first that's going to\nhappen is if I talk about making dating\nless important there is going to be a\ntorrent of\ndisagreement no Dr K it's the most\nimportant how dare you tell me to Value\noh my\nGod this is important to me it's all I\ncare about yeah so let's understand what\nhappens so when you have very little\nexperience daating and you care a\nlot about dating what happens in your\nmind\nso you start to build up\nfantasies right so how does the Mind\nknow when you say this is the most\nimportant thing to you so let's let's\nunderstand this for a second\nokay this is why importance is just bad\nwe'll get to how to incorporate import\nso let's just understand this if someone\nhas no experience with dating and they\nsay getting late is the most important\nthing to me having a relationship is the\nmost important thing to\nme okay when they when they're in this\nsituation what is it that's important to\nyou like literally what is it it's the\nrelationship but have you ever had a\nrelationship how can you value something\nthat you have no knowledge of just think\nabout it for a\nsecond right so if someone's like oh\nyeah like I have dreams to be an Olympic\nAthlete like I have dreams to be an\nOlympic Athlete it's everything in the\nworld to me and so I recently saw this\ninteresting article that the day after\nMichael Phelps I think won like four\ngold medals or something when the\nOlympics was over he wakes up the next\nday and he's\nsuicidal what this guy's crazy so the\nfirst thing to understand is that if\ndating and relationships are very in\nvery the most important oh I want love\nthis is what I need to be fulfilled I\nhave this ache in my heart I've been\nthere right I had it\ntoo maybe that's better no we'll leave\nthat on close the windows inside\nso if if you're just think about this\nokay so if you if this is really\nimportant to you what is it that your\nmind thinks this is and what tends to\nhappen when we value something that we\nhave no experience over is we construct\na\nfantasy and the moment that you\nconstruct a fantasy you have really set\nyourself up for a lot of problems\nbecause the reality will be different\nfrom it so instead of like even like a\nneutral experience so now we we'll get\nto a couple of things okay so let's take\na look at\nthis so let's say I've constructed a\nfantasy so once I construct a fantasy\nlet's say that this is relationships are\nthe most important thing to me they're\n100 right and then I have a real\nexperience which is normal which is a 50\nbut what do I see I see a minus\n50 now if you're someone who does this\nyour mind will rebel against this idea\n100% no Dr K you don't understand my\nsituation\nmy situation is\ndifferent but let's just take a step\nback and I'll ask you forget about your\nsituation let's just understand the\ngeneral principle when you have no\nexperience of something how on Earth can\nyou value it or you have very little\nexperience of it how do you understand\nits accurate\nvalue and so the problem is we create\nall of these fantasies it becomes really\nreally important to us and when\nsomething becomes important to us we run\ninto all kinds of problems because this\nis an average normal experience which\nlooks like like a minus 50 in your book\nso you're starting you're opening the\ndoor to negative\nbias you're also opening the door to\nstress which is going to make you less\nattractive you are looking for something\nin particular instead of letting\nrelationships be\norganic and since I decided to become a\nmonk all of my\nromantic\ninteractions have been like relatively\norganic right so this is what tends to\nhappen when you have a lot of people\nwhen you see these people out there who\nare like I don't understand how this\nperson keeps on finding relationships\nand like where they're meeting people\nlike they just seem to be so good at it\nand I think that there is a natural\norganic to relationships that's how\nhuman being that's how human\nrelationships are designed to evolve and\nwhen you once you start adding\nimportance and stress to the\nrelationship it really sabotages your\nchances and there's one other source of\nsabotage that importance in a\nrelationship causes okay so the more\nimportant you think it is the worse off\nit is there's one other person that this\nreally harms and that is your\nperspective\npartner so when a relationship is the\nmost important thing to you oh my god\nrelationships are the most important\nthing to me oh my God I like I need it I\nneed it this is what they mean to me\nthey they they mean that there's love\nand there's commitment and there's like\nsomeone on your team all the time\nsomeone there for you whenever you need\nit and then you have this idea of oh my\nGod like this relationship with this\nbeautiful what a beautiful\nrelationship and then some unlucky human\nbeing has to pick up that mantle some\nunlucky human being with\nflaws is now trying to interact with you\nbut you're not interacting with them\nbecause you have a preconceived idea of\nwhat the relationship should\nbe this is what I want I need all of\nthese things from Rel and then some\nhuman just a human just a person is like\nI don't know how to handle this like I\ncan't make this person happy or like\nthis is weird so they feel all of that\npressure and it pushes them\naway so paradoxically the first thing\nthat you need to do if relationships are\nthe most important thing in the world to\nyou is make them less\nimportant secondly if you're like I\ndon't want to do that right if you're so\nclinging to that that you cannot change\nthat then examine that for a moment and\nthen the second thing that you can do\neven if you don't want to make it so\nimportant to you if you don't don't want\nto make it less important sorry there\nare other things that you can do which\nis observe these three things that I've\ntold you so when you make it a\nrelationship super important to you what\ndo you construct in your\nmind how does your Fantastical\nconstruction affect your interpretation\nof real\nexperiences chances are it'll be\ndisappointing how does it affect your\nstress level when you try to engage in\nthis because relationships are supposed\nto be\nfun right that's the whole point is\neveryone's like laughing and having sex\nand cuddling and maybe getting married\nand going on vacation and finishing each\nother's sandwiches this is what a\nrelationship is supposed to be that's\nwhy you want it so much\nbut what is it like for\nyou right so as you bring that stress to\nthe table it's going to you're going to\nshoot yourself in the\nfoot not saying it's easy I'm just\nsaying that this is a very common\nproblem where people will make\nrelationship so important to them and\nthen they end up shooting themselves in\nthe foot give me a second I got to close\nsome of these\nblinds\nokay\nokay let's look at number\ntwo how to make relationships less\nimportant so now let's understand this\nokay we we'll talk about it it's a good\nquestion so if you want to make\nrelationships less important here's what\nyou got to do number one just notice\nwhat this relationship being so\nimportant to you means okay so like\nhere's what we're going to notice about\nrelationships okay and so just ask\nyourself okay if this is important to me\nwhat does it mean to be in a\nrelationship like what is the\nsignificance of being in\nrelationship okay and also like what\ndoes it who am I if I'm in relation\nship and then like who am I\nnot\nunless I'm in a\nrelationship so how do you see\nyourself if you are in a relationship or\nnot in a\nrelationship right and that's when like\nwe'll start to see that there's a lot of\nstuff that you\nattach so you need to just look at that\nkind of stuff okay what is the what do I\nthink a relationship\nis right and then once you have it once\nyou answer that question then ask\nyourself where did I get this\nidea and I'm not saying that the idea is\ngoing to beol fictional because even our\nfictional representations are rooted in\nin reality but you need to just like\nlook at what your mind is doing if\nyou're so caught up in\nrelationships right and then the last\nthing this is what's really important so\nif something is important to\nyou I don't know if this makes sense but\nfor people who are the import\nrelationships are so important to them\nthere is an ache or a\nhunger and this ache and hunger is so\nprofound this is why you can't make\nrelationship ship is less important for\nyou because on some level you are\nstarving you're hungry there's something\ndeep down inside you that is\nunfulfilled and the thought of having\nthat thing unfulfilled for the rest of\nyour life if you decrease the value of\nrelationships oh my God it'll be\nunfulfilled for the rest of my life that\nhunger will always be there that hunger\nis\nunbearable this is why it's impossible\nto make him less\nimportant because you have that ache you\nhave that hunger\nand to really\nunderstand where does this come\nfrom and this is one of the weird things\nthat I found as a psychiatrist is that\noften times we look at these things like\ntrauma we say oh my God like this sounds\nlike a case of trauma like this person\nmust have been hurt very deeply when\nthey were young and they look back at\ntheir lives and they think to themselves\nokay I never had anything like that\nthere's no smoking gun in my childhood\nmy parents were pretty chill they were\npretty loving they're still together I\ndon't know where this hunger comes\nfrom and so sometimes I will explore the\nconcept of past lives with people like\nmy\npatients right and there's all kind like\nwho knows where it comes from maybe it\ndoesn't come from this life I'm not\nsaying their past lives are real or\nthings like that I think there's\ntherapeutic value to operating in what\nwhatever frame a patient considers\nhelpful right so if they believe in God\nwe talk about God if they don't believe\nin God we don't talk about God it\ndepends on the patient but for you just\nbecause you can't find the answers\nexpand your horizon a little bit right\nit comes from somewhere all things come\nfrom somewhere nothing is random in the\nworld cause and\neffect so really explore that hunger\nbecause this is going to be what makes\nit really hard and if you do these four\nthings this is going to be the first\nstep to really understanding how to make\nrelationships less important for you\nbecause as it turns out relationships\nbeing important may actually Sav Avage\nyour chances of\nsuccess and we see this a ton in our\ncoaching program so we've had about\n12,000 or 15,000 people go through it\nnow and like a lot of times they'll come\nin with some problem that they think is\nreally really huge and then what the\ncoaches are really good at is like\nhelping them understand okay wait the\nway that you are playing the game is\nactually what's creating the result it's\nnot that the game is rigged it's that\nyou're misplaying you make the same\nmistake over and over and over again and\nthen somehow as like they understand\nthis stuff then they like start to get\nbetter and then suddenly they're like in\nrelationships it's weird we've seen it a\nton okay and these are like people from\nour community right so this isn't just\nlike some other theoretical fictitious\nperson who spends more time on LinkedIn\nthen on Reddit or twitch or YouTube or\nwhatever so like this is like\nus okay so really you have to understand\nwhat strategy you're using to play the\ngame and then you'll be surprised that\nif you can reduce the importance of the\nrelationship it frees you up more and it\nmakes it more accessible but if you're\napproaching it from a place of\nstress with high expectations and low\nselfworth this is a recipe for disaster\nlet just think about it right if I were\nto tell you okay hey like this person\nwants to get in a relationship oh tell\nme about the person well they have super\nhigh\nexpectations they have F Fantastical\nideas about what a relationship should\nbe like they have super low self-esteem\nthey're stressed out a ton about\nrelationships\nand they they feel a crushing sadness\nevery two weeks that is crippling for\nthem how how optimistic would you be\nright and some of these things are in\nyour control notice I didn't say I'm not\ndisputing that this person had negative\nexperiences all the ones I did have were\nreally negative and hurt me we'll get to\nthat in a second let's talk about I\nforget about a second let's talk about\nit\nnow so this is kind of\nbizarre but when you really want a\nrelationship why is it that what little\nexperience you do have is so painful and\nsucks right that's what we see is that\nlike oh my God like all the experience I\nI've had are hard so we can talk about\nsomething like cognitive bias if you all\nreally want to there may be some degree\nof cognitive bias here there's good\nevidence of\nthat but here's what tends to happen\nwhen you are desperate for a\nrelationship\nand you feel like you have low\nself-esteem you do a very very\ninteresting psychological thing which is\nthat you remove all of the healthy\nrelationship possibilities from the\nequation before you even get started you\ndiscount all the people that would lead\nto a good relationship so I'll give you\nall a really interesting example for\nthis when I graduated from college so I\nwas a fifth year senior right finished\nwith a 2.5\nGPA\nI applied for research positions because\nI had a degree in neurobiology I applied\nto 131 research\npositions and I got rejected from all of\nthem except for\none the one research position I ended up\ngetting was at Harvard Medical Schools\noser Research Center and I was really\nsurprised because I was like holy crap I\napplied to University of Texas San\nAntonio and like Texas Tech University\nfor research search\npositions and I wind up going to\ninterview at\nHarvard and then I kind of asked a\ncouple months later I was like how did I\nget this job and they were like you the\nonly one that applied I was like\nwhat so there is a glot of mediocrity\nwhat happens with people is they tend to\nundershoot where they actually are so\nyou have to understand this okay if you\nhave low\nself-esteem do you accurately gauge what\nyour worth is of course not that's the\nwhole point it's low self-esteem like\nyou think it's accurate but you think a\nthousand people have low self-esteem are\nthey accurately judging where they are\nno they're\nnot so then what happens is you have the\npossibility of a relationship with\nsomeone and I see this a lot especially\nin the people I work with because the\npeople I work with are all broken so\nthey look at someone on a dating app and\nthey're like that person isn't broken\nenough that person wouldn't ever want to\ndate me oh my God you're so telepathic\nmy God God you know this person so well\nyou know what their preferences are you\nknow what they're attracted to oh but\nthey put something in my dating in their\ndating profile that I don't fit well\nlike that's a little bit silly because\nthe only things we put in dating\nprofiles are things that don't relate to\nthe success of a relationship I know\nthat sounded weird so I'll rephrase so\ndating profiles are restricted with the\nkind of information that you can\nput and due dating profiles capture the\nactual variables that lead to successful\nrelationships no they\ndon't right there's all kinds of\nvariables that lead to successful\nrelationships like shared emotional\nexperience the first time you\nmeet that's not you can't put that on a\ndating\napp right everyone assumes that it's\ndifferent shared religion and everybody\nwho wants like you know I I want to be a\nsugar sugar daddy or I want to be a\nsugar baby and somebody else wants to be\na sugar mama and like as long as the\nbabies and the Mas and the daddies all\nget together everybody's happy but\nthat's not actually what leads to\nrelationships so the first thing is when\nwe have low self-esteem when we think\nthat oh my God this is like I'm I'm not\ngood at this the biggest mistake that we\nmake is we remove all the people that\nare too good for us and then we're left\nwith all the people who are a little bit\nbusted and then no wonder we have\nnegative\nexperiences right because you're\nselecting the one person that feels safe\nto you which is someone who is unable to\nhave a healthy relation ship so we see\nthis pattern it's been very well studied\nin trauma so when you have children who\nwho are abused they will date people who\nare\nabusive why what's going on there it's\nbecause when someone when there's\nsomeone who's not abusive the person\ngets so confused they'd never consider\ndating them in the first place because\nit's weird that person's too good for me\nor they get scared by the lack of abuse\nwhen is the other shoe going to drop\nthis person is being really nice that\nmust mean that they're going to be\nreally nasty to me later and and you may\nsay but Dr K why would you think that\njust think about it for a second right\nin someone if you're a child who grows\nup in an abusive household usually your\nparents are not all nasty they're humans\nwhich means that they also experience\nguilt so on one day you're abused and on\nthe next day your parent is like I'm so\nsorry here's a p\nPS5 let me make it up to you and then a\nfew months later they start drinking\nagain the abuse starts they feel guilty\nthey're 30 days sober the gifts start\ncoming and so what does this person\nstart to understand about gifts holy\ncrap they're tied with\nabuse and so then you have a healthy\npartner who starts giving you gifts and\nyou're like oh [ __ ] I better\nrun because there's another aspect of\nthis if you if you struggled with abuse\nis that when you meet someone that you\nreally really like who is not abusive I\ndon't know if this makes any\nsense but the thought of this one one\ngood person that you really believe you\ncould\nlove and could really be the one who is\nnot abusive the thought of that person\none day becoming abusive is so scary\nthat you just Retreat from the\nrelationship I can't afford to lose all\nhope because if this person turns out\nbad if this good apple turns into a bad\napple then all of my hope is lost so you\nleave let me preserve the idea of a good\napple out\nthere\nand so part of the reason that we have\nsuch negative experiences if you have\nlow self-esteem who are you going to\nfeel comfortable engaging in romantic\nrelationships with asking out on\ndates right so then then we have this\nreal problem where of course your\nexperiences are negative but that's\nbecause of who you're\nselecting and then people may say but I\nhave this like idea like but I fell fell\nin love oh my God I fell in love right\nso this is the fantasy again falling in\nlove is the stupidest thing you can\ndo it's like the whole point is that the\nbiology of your system doesn't give a\n[ __ ] about the long-term consequences\nand whether this is going to be\nemotionally good or emotionally bad it\ndoesn't\ncare that's how we're\nwired we're wired to think\nabout like ignore the consequences\nliterally our brain is wired to like oh\nmy God I'm in love I guess I better cut\noff all the parts of my brain that allow\nme to calculate risks oh my God I'm in\nlove oh yeah all those red flags there's\nyour personality\nquirks it's just a\nphase I can I can fix him I can fix\nher I can turn I could with my help oh\nmy goodness they will turn into such a\ndelicious peach pie oh my God we start\nto ignore all these\nthings\nright and so this is why we have\nnegative\nexperiences and so this is also why\npeople say work on yourself before you\nstart dating now if only that worked the\nsad truth of the matter and we know this\nfrom studies on attachment theory is\nthat often times if you're so busted and\nyou have low self-esteem you can't\nnecessarily fix that on your own I mean\na lot of people do and I think it's\nworthwhile Endeavor for you to try to\nfix it on your\nown but the sad truth of the matter is\nthat we know from you know lots of\nresearch on Psychotherapy and stuff like\nthat that like often times we need\ncorrective emotional experiences to heal\nthat\ntrauma and those corrective emotional\nexperiences are provided by other human\nbeings and this is something that we\ndon't like to say especially in the west\nbecause we have this culture of\nIndependence I should be able to do it\nmyself but like that's not how human\nbeings were wired we were wired as a\ntribe right it's a multiplayer game you\ncan't solo all the\ncontent and now people are going to be\nlike okay but does that mean I'm screwed\nbecause now I have to rely on other\npeople and I have to work on myself like\nI don't understand what are you telling\nme to do doc I'm telling you it's a slow\nprocess understand the nuances of it you\ncan't just work on yourself but you\nshould work on yourself and also\nrecognize your relationship patterns\nright how is it that I wind up in the\nsame place over and over and over again\nand whatever answer your mind comes up\nwith that is wrong if it is an answer\nthat is already given you it is wrong it\nmust be a new answer this is the nature\nof diagnosis and treatment if you have\none diagnosis and all three treatments\nhave failed consider a second\ndiagnosis right and this is what we see\nlike so I've worked with people who are\nin cells and they have this belief that\nbecause their jaw is whatever they will\nnever have a a date it's impossible for\nthem to find love and they all believe\nthis and this is where you have to be\nsuper careful because if you have a\ndiagnosis that is unactionable you're\nscrewed right and we have those in\nmedicine we have things like stage four\nmetastatic cancer we have secondary\nProgressive multiple sclerosis we have\nALS right we have stroke where like you\nlose a chunk of the brain and it doesn't\nreally come back like brain doesn't\nregenerate\nmuch but usually with some of these\nproblems that we see a lot with dating a\nlot of these are very correctable\nbecause the problem is not actually in\nthe world it is in the way that you\nperceive and interact with the world and\nthat can\nchange we know for example that people\nwho have borderline personality disorder\nprobably about 90% of them will get\nbetter within a decade the specific\nnumbers vary depending on the study or\nwhatever but a big part of that can be a\na single healthy relationship for two\nyears leads to 50% of people being in\nremission from BPD\nso I know that everyone's like just work\non yourself you can't fix yourself first\nand then engage in a relationship it's\ngreat give it a shot by all means but if\nit doesn't work it's not like you have\nto fix yourself first and then enter a\nrelationship the two need to be\nconcurrent probably and the most\nimportant thing is pay attention to your\npatterns that got you here in the first\nplace\nokay okay let's talk about a couple of\nother things about this\npost so\nundo ad Strokes undo I don't know what\nthat means let's talk about the other so\nwe talked about the importance in\nsuccess we also talk about all\nexperiences where hurtful right now it's\ntalking about pulling pain and nothing\nwill make it\nbetter\nokay so when we have negative emotional\nexperiences this emotion gets\nstored in the body and in the\nmind and we tend to have these physical\nSensations so what tends to happen is\nthat anytime we have overwhelming\nnegative stuff our our brain and body\nare like we can't deal with this so we\npush it down we wall it off behind\npsychological defense\nmechanisms we'll do things like\nself-medicate with\nsubstances with you know video games\nporn whatever and then all those\nemotions get shoved to the\nside and then we enter this kind of\nthinking that nothing will make it\nbetter and nothing will justify the\nmental Agony and this is actually 100%\nlogical because thus far what have you\nexperienced that would make this pain\nworthwhile nothing so you have no frame\nof reference right all you've been\ntaking is bitter medicine every day and\nyou're like I can't imagine any\nsituation in which I would ever want to\nput anything into my mouth because all\nI'm eating is bitter medicine every\nsingle day and it's like yeah if you've\nnever tasted a mango or a be or whatever\nlike it would make sense that you've\nnever had an experience that would make\nit nothing will make it\nworthwhile right so if you've never had\nthat experience of course nothing is\ngoing to make it worthwhile that doesn't\nmean that nothing is theoretically out\nthere and this is another bias of the\nmind that we have to be careful\nabout the Mind operates under the\nassumption that my experiences are\nmirrors of objective reality but that's\nnot true right your mind just constructs\nwhatever reality it's got and that's the\nbest it kind of\ndoes and so it is okay for you to think\nthis way and just because you think that\nway because all of your experiences up\nto the age of 23 have made it so that\nnothing is worth the pain so be it but\nthat's just all the experiences up to 23\narguably you've got about 60 years\nleft right so you've got let's say you\nstarted puberty around 14 so you've been\ndoing this for let's say a decade and\nyou've got six of those left and so\nthings can\nchange so this is where we strongly\nrecommend things like you know emotional\nprocessing and this person is in therapy\nwhich is can be very helpful but I\nstrongly recommend that if y'all are in\ntherapy and you have a problem like this\nlike this is what you work on in therapy\nI used to think this was obvious until I\nrealized that a lot of people don't it's\nnot obvious\nactually that when you are in therapy\nyou are working on something and what a\nlot of patients don't realize is you can\npick what that is it is your therapist's\njob to fix what you\nwant and then a lot of people may be\nlike but oh my God can they fix me yeah\nlike that's our job like that's what\nwe're there to do if someone comes in\nand says hey I've got\nOCD and I wash my hands 15 times a day\nand my hands I keep on getting\ninfections the therapist job is to help\nyou with that or if it's something like\nthis their their job is to help you deal\nwith this pulling pain in your chest so\nyou're not have to walk around with it\nall day\nlong okay so a lot of people will go\ninto therapy and then like their\ntherapist is like ask some weird\nopen-ended question and then you just\ntalk about you you think you're supposed\nto be you're doing what you're supposed\nto be doing in therapy instead of\nactually doing what you want to do in\ntherapy go and do what you want to\ndo\nokay and then the last thing that you\nhave to be super careful\nabout this is the most devastating\nthing okay\nso sometimes when all this negative\nstuff\nhappens we end up with this\nsentence out of everything in this post\nthis is the most damaging\nthing so when we go through life we have\nexperiences in this part of our brain\ncalled the default mode Network takes\nthese individual experiences and makes a\nconclusion about me I'm just a sensitive\nperson so when I was growing up for\nexample I thought I was\nunathletic and how did I arrive at that\nconclusion well I was last to be picked\non the basketball team I was last to be\npicked on the the football team I was\nlast to be picked for anything and I was\nnever the winner of any sports contest I\nnever came in first when we were running\nI never and so I concluded oh I'm not\nbad at basketball I'm not bad at this\nI'm not bad I am\nunathletic and that so then what happens\nis once I start to think oh my God I am\nan athletic then opportunities arose\nlater in life where they were like hey\ndo you want to do this thing and I was\nlike nah I'm not athletic it's not for\nme it's not who I am and so then what\nhappened is I stopped engaging in\nathletic activities which then\nreinforced the idea that I'm on athletic\nbecause everybody else is doing athletic\nstuff and now I'm just playing video\ngames all day I'm on\nathletic now what's wrong about this\nmaybe I was on athletic no I came to an\nincorrect conclusion I was a\nsix-year-old comp competing against\nseven-year-olds or even\neight-year-olds that's why I was last it\nwasn't that I was unathletic it was the\ndeck was stacked against me I was placed\ninto a physical bracket where people had\nwere like physically larger and faster\nand more coordinated and by the way had\na year of practice over\nme right so then we're in like big\ntrouble so the one thing you've got to\nbe super careful about if you are in\nthis dating\nhellscape is be careful about what\nconclusions your mind draws about\nyou and you you will have what appears\nto be the right evidence at the time to\nfall to form that conclusion don't don't\ndon't misunderstand this I'm not saying\nthat you're not logical it's that you\nhave incomplete information\nso it was also a logical conclusion for\na 5-year-old to think like okay like I'm\non athletic because I suck at all this\nclearly but I didn't have the frame of\nmind to think oh like I didn't think to\nmyself how much older are these\nkids right maybe that has something to\ndo with\nit so be super careful about making meta\nlevel conclusions about your identity\nfrom dating because chances are they're\nnot correct doesn't mean that they're\nnot logical they're just incomplete\nso if we had taken you and put you in a\ndifferent circumstance or strengthened\nyour skills in some sort of way or sent\nyou to therapy or whatever else it's\nvery possible that you would be in a\ndifferent scenario right now and all of\nthose actions can still be\ntaken\nokay and then the last thing that I'll\ntalk about is you know the\ndisappointment with myself for failing\nat the thing that had always been the\nmost important to me so this is the\nproblem of two\narrows right right this is the problem\nof like okay not only do I have a\nsetback in life but now I am beating\nmyself up because I had a setback in\nlife and so now you have two things to\novercome so I know it can sound really\nreally challenging that if you've been\nin the situation where you can't\nrecover from your terrible dating\nexperience I'm not disputing that your\nexperience has been terrible I'm not\nsaying that things aren't hard I'm not\nsaying that things the mental Agony\nyou've experienced is false in any way\nshape or form but my consistent\nexperience working with people from all\nwalks of life and this includes people\nwho are in prison people who are\nhomeless and people who are billionaires\nseen the whole Spectrum right not all\nspectrum of all human beings but I've\nseen a wide\nrange and what I found the one thing\nthat we fail to understand the one most\ncommon mistake that human beings make is\nthat they do not understand how their\nactions shape the world that they live\nin and this becomes even more of a\nproblem because as you stop believing\nthat your actions shape the world right\nit's it's kind of like this ex external\nidea of okay everything is determined\nfor me then you give up on your actions\nactually having any sort of impact and\nthen you stop you you start ignoring\nyour\nactions and once you stop start ignoring\nyour actions you ignore the one thing\nthat can actually fix things for\nyou so look at the way that you're\nplaying the game really ask yourself\nquestion yourself how can I do this\ndifferently and what you what what the\nreal thing that's really fascinating is\nit's not and then people will go Post\nonline they'll be like what should I do\nno you need to look at your thought\nprocess even before you post look at all\nof the assumptions that you have and how\nyour mind arrives at those conclusions\nbecause posting things online is a\nterrible way to get\nadvice and why is that it's because what\nyou post is going to be biased by your\nmind you're not going to get some\nobjective thing if you guys know what\nI'm talking about you go to some you\nknow political subreddit or gendered\nsubreddit and it's just like it's an\necho chamber and people post one way no\none ever says like hey maybe you're\nmaking a mistake here right it's always\nlike oh my God like everyone else is\nterrible and you should break up with\nthem right away like this is a huge red\nflag huge red\nflag the game is rigged from the start\nthe game isn't rigged from the start the\ngame is rigged by our\nmind and we have so much more power than\nwe really understand until you start\nexercising it properly and then you\nrealize holy crap I can affect\nchange okay and it's not anyone's fault\nbecause this too is like you haven't we\nwere not taught this stuff because the\nsociety we used to live in you didn't\nneed to like understand your mind this\nwell the problem is that in today's\nsociety we get bombarded with so much\ncrappy information that it shapes the\nway that we see the\nworld and we have all of these things\nthat everyone is doing which are like\nterribly inefficient like online\ndating it was supposed to fix things and\nit somehow made things worse but now\neveryone's stuck because it's like what\nam I supposed to how am I supposed to\nmeet people without an app that's where\neveryone\nis right so it's like either I use this\nbad thing that everyone is using or I'm\nthe one person that doesn't use it and\nthen I can't meet anyone anyway you're\ndamned if you do damned if you\ndon't but even that conception is\nincorrect because lots of people get\ntogether without online\ndating and a lot of people get together\nwith online dating maybe you should do\nboth yeah so someone's saying boy have I\nhad n some narratives running me into\nfaults what a beautiful way to put\nit okay let's move on\nokay so for those of you that don't know\nevery Friday on our subreddit is the one\nday that we are oh allowed to post\nthings about dating and\nrelationships I think I will never have\na girlfriend I think you're wrong and\nI'm pretty hopeful for you and then we\nget\nmad so we got to talk about this this is\na great\nmeem\nso see when we when we talk on the\ninternet this is not just talking about\ninternet we're going to teach you a\nlittle a little thing\nabout understanding how people\ncommunicate and what people are looking\nfor when they communicate okay so\nsometimes when we\ncommunicate we're not looking to be\ncontradicted helped or anything we just\nwant to wallow in our self-pity and\noften times the reason that this kind of\nthing this kind of encouragement doesn't\nhelp is because it's very inv validating\nthis is not what this person wants to\nhear right so I don't know if you all\nhave ever seen this like on on video\ngame forums or like whatever but\nsomeone's like oh this particular\ncharacter is so\nop and then like people are like no it's\nactually not that op this is just you\nknow this is how you beat it and then\nthe person is like no that doesn't work\nscrew\nyou right so like this is one of those\nsituations what does that person want so\nthe next time I want y'all to see\nsomething I want y'all to watch\nsomething okay the next time you see\nsomeone on the Internet Posting about an\nOP character in a video game I want you\nto respond to them and say oh yeah oh my\nGod that person is so busted I was in a\ngame recently where they did this and\nthat was like completely crazy and Watch\nWhat Happens so the rest of the internet\nmay downvote you but watch what the\noriginal person who posted about this\ncharacter being okay key watch how they\nrespond they will love you for it\nbecause they're wrong and the internet\nloves to tell them that they're wrong\nyou're the one person that's telling\nthem that they're\nright so in this\nsituation we have to be super\ncareful because if we're not careful we\nwill wind up in places where I think I\nwill never have a girlfriend you will\nend up in some corner of the internet\nwhere everyone else will tell you yes\nthat is\ncorrect women are you in this\nenvironment women are just completely\nundatable or this or that or like\nwhatever they're going to say you can\nfind corners of the internet will say\nthe same things about men recently I've\nstumbled into all of this bisexual\nhatred which I don't know if you guys\nhave seen this but you know like they\nget ostracized by\neverybody and and they have trouble like\nI I worked with men who are are bisexual\nand have a lot of trouble dating\nwomen like because the women judge them\nfor being\nbisexual and it makes them less manly\napparently right and so there's any\ncorner of the internet well you you'll\nfind like an echo chamber of hatred and\nthat's where you have to be super\ncareful because if you ignore everybody\nelse who disagrees with you and you just\npost this kind of stuff and you get\nangry with with dissenting opinions\neventually you will find a corner of the\ninternet where no one disagrees with you\nand then your feelings will get set in\nstone and then you will start operating\nbased on a worldview that is quite\nradical that doesn't help you\nit just helps you feel good huge\ndifference\nokay all right I'm going to grab some\nwater real\nquick and\nthen I'll leave y'all with\nthis okay I haven't had sex or any form\nof intimacy for 10 years and it's eating\nme alive\nfood can\nbe oh\nwe\nokay I haven't had sex or any form of\nintimacy for 10 years and it's eating me\nalive food can be a form of creative of\nexpression I put my emotions into my\ncooking this tastes\nhorny is nice to be understood oh my\nGod please please\nplease I don't want to know what food\nthat tastes horny tastes\nlike I don't know what do y'all think\nchat what are the horniest Foods what do\ny'all\nthink what do y'all\nthink\num we should do a poll what are tier\nmaker tier\nlist shrimp\nMayo salty sausage\npineapple chocolate covered strawberries\nbone\n[Music]\nmarrow Special\nSauce\nokay um Brun a Costa hi Dr K from Brazil\nplease your golden advice for a\n30-year-old virgin on everything with a\ndate scheduled with a foreigner for next\nmonth\nokay so what should you do if you're a\n30-year-old virgin who is having their\nfirst\ndate in a month okay so here's Dr K's\nguide to if you're a virgin whose dat\nfor the first time what to do you've got\n30 days the first thing is you got to\nfeel comfortable in your own body so\nthis is what is to be understood when we\nare dating and we are inexperienced and\nwe're virgins our main enemy is the\nVirgin inside you that is what you're\ntrying to conquer so how do you conquer\nthe Virgin inside you the Virgin inside\nyou doesn't think that they look good\nthey don't feel good they're stressed\nout they lack confidence so the first\nthing you've got to do is feel good in\nyour own body now you may not be able to\ndo that in 30 days but let's get\nstarted so in 30 days you will be able\nto see at least some kind of change in\nyour physical body if you start\nexercising today if you start stretching\ntoday we want you to literally feel good\nin your own body is what little amount\nthat you\ncan okay and then what we really want\nyou to pay attention to is whatever\nprogress you can make in 30 days that's\nthe goal\nand in terms of the stakes oh but what\nif I procrastinate what if I do this\nwhat if I do this remember the goal here\nis that you want to feel as good as you\ncan in 30 days and the clock is ticking\nso feeling good in your body can be\nexercising can also be things like Mind\nBody practices like yoga and taii when\nyour ass gets up out of the chair and\nyou feel Gran and clunky and and sore\nand stiff that doesn't feel good so when\nyour body is Rusty your mind will be\nrusty\nokay so you got\nto exercise or do your mind body\npractices whatever something to feel\ngood you can go for a walk that's\ntotally fine you can walk for 30 days\nand that'll be good enough go for one\nhour walk for 30 days do it feel good in\nyour own\nbody a second part of that is often\ntimes upgrading your physical appearance\nin whatever way you can so get a nice\nhaircut get some advice from people\nmaybe get some new clothing really pay\nattention to your wardrobe consider\nshaving right so like get some advice\nthis is like I think okay there's this\nyou know thing of looks maxing that\neverybody's doing nowadays I think some\nof it's kind of body dysmorphia in\nDisguise but some of it's like pretty\ngood right so do what you can to feel\ngood in your body second thing is that\nwhen we have a date and we're virgins we\nthink that everything goes into this\ndate oh my God this is the chance like\nthis is going to be what determines my\nfuture\nno this doesn't determine your future\nthis is practice for the\nfuture so every date that you go on is\nnot about succeeding at the date or\nfailing at the date every date you go on\nis to prepare you and level up for the\nnext date that's frame of mind change\nnumber two because when you've been\nhungry for so long and someone finally\ngives you food oh my God I need to eat\nit no no no slow it down everything is\nabout leveling up for the future\nthat's what this date is and the third\nthing that I would strongly strongly\nstrongly strongly strongly recommend is\nthat you try to attach no outcomes to\nthis date don't try to get laid don't\neven try to get a second date or\nanything like that try to have a good\ntime so this is the way that I want\nyouall to think about\ndating so in my\nlife I can be with someone with a lot of\npeople with one person with no people\nyou can pick\nwhatever and so you're going on a date\nto try to get to know someone appreciate\nthem for who they are and see if you\nhave some kind of natural inclination\ntowards them see if yall can Vibe\ntogether or not it's a Vibe check that's\nwhat a date is so it's not about an\noutcome it's about an\nexperience so go there with the attitude\nof not I need to impress this person and\nthis person needs to like me or anything\nlike that don't let all that stuff go\nyou're going you're going to show up as\nyourself they are going to show up as\nthemselves you're going to be a polished\nversion of you right so you want to make\nit enjoyable for them as well and just\ntry to enjoy the\nexperience I think that's what what I\nsort of found is is like um and I this\nis going to sound arrogant but same same\nsort of thing happened is that like when\nI this was the big thing that changed a\nlot for me so it started with me being a\nmonk so I was like okay I'm going to be\na monk so now that I'm hanging out with\ngirls like there's no semblance of any\nkind of romantic anything it's not an\noption it's off the table so I can relax\nand I can just have a good time right\nlet's just go hang out\nlet's go to lunch somewhere hey are you\nwe're done with lunch do you want to\nlike go do something else like let's go\nfor a hike then you end up hanging out\nwith people and they wind up being a\nlittle bit more attracted to you and\nthen when I was in med school contrary\nto popular belief it's not like everyone\nsalivates over doctors it doesn't fix\neverything immediately we're not even\ndoctors yet we're Med students same sort\nof attitude so I was engaged in med\nschool so I was like all right there's\nno like everyone else is like oh my God\nlike who's who are the hot singles like\nlike oh my God you know let's go but I\nwas like yeah I'm not going to play that\ngame so instead when I hung out with\npeople it's just let's have\nfun then sometimes people there's\nattraction that Sparks and that's okay\nright then we shut it down it's a\nconversation for a different day right\none day I I long for the day in this\ncommunity when someone's like how do I\nhow do I cut back on the Romantic St\nactually not I don't long for the day\nwe've been in that we've had that day\nfor so many times we've had so many\nwomen in our community it's like how do\nI just make a friend without them trying\nto get into my pants so we've been there\nalready I long for the day that the men\nand our community can experience that\ntoo right so then we'll be shared and\ntied in our suffering and then the\ngender Dynamics in our community will\nimprove so this is what I would say is\nis try to have a good time right\nrecognize that this is not the end of\nthe world or the beginning of the world\nit's one date and you should learn as\nmuch as you can from it third thing is\nbe comfortable in your body the more\ncomfortable you are in your body the\nmore confident you will be the more\nrelaxed you will be the more you will\nenjoy the experience\nokay there one other thought that I had\nthat I'm blanking\n[Music]\non see let's talk about arranged\nmarriage for a second so are you saying\nthat I should have an arranged marriage\nno so let's understand something\nso any system has advantages and\ndisadvantages and I didn't have an\narranged marriage um my parents didn't\nhave an arranged marriage it was very\nscandalous back in the\nday and so when people say like oh my\nGod arranged marriages are so bad for\nall of these million reasons and they\ncan be really really bad so I had a\nfamily member who basically like was\nkind of forced into an arranged marriage\nthe family was like somewhat abusive\nlike they basically wanted an unpaid\nservant right so and and someone to like\ncook and clean and like there was no\naffection or equality or respect or\nanything like\nthat and so my family member left right\nand it was very scandalous in the\ncommunity because they're like oh my God\nnow she's like damaged goods oh my God\nthey would say all these kinds of things\nand so we can look at the evils of\narranged marriage in that way and they\ncan be very evil right and also there's\na reason why we used to do it and the\none thing that we forget about arranged\nmarriage\nis that what we look for in a partner\nmay not be what leads to a successful\nmarriage right so here we are looking\nfor what we want and how's that working\nout for us because we know what we want\nand we deserve what we want\nright I deserve everything in life\nespecially when it comes to love no\none's raising their kids and being like\nyeah you know I I have daughters and I'm\nnot you know I've never said this to\nthem where I'm like yeah you know I know\nthat true love is really important but\nchances are you're going to have to\nsettle for half of what you're really\nlooking for because that's life no dad\ntalks their daughters that way like it's\nabsurd right we don't talk to our sons\nthat way either you just got to settle\nbro you're not going to get what you\nwant so we create all these ideas that\noh you should have absolutely what you\nwant and by the way you're a good judge\nright let's keep that in mind so the one\nadvantage of arranged marriage is that\nyour parents chances are have more\nexperience in understanding what creates\na safe healthy long-term relationship\nthan you do maybe not safe who\nknows and so they have an idea of your\npersonality traits better than you do\nthey know what will complement you well\nso that's what they sort of make the\ndecision based on because when we're at\nthe helm it's not like we're always\ndoing great right so in this is the the\nproblem with things like dating apps is\ndating apps don't actually allow you to\nselect for the variables that\ncorrelate with success in long-term\nrelationships we just pick things that\nare all superficial like income and\nappearance and whatever Vibe whatever\nright you just answer these random\nthings and that's why by the way I don't\nknow if you all have noticed but dating\napps have moved in the direction of\nbeing like less clear so they're they're\noffering more ambiguous information like\nyou know tell me something interesting\nabout yourself because they've realized\nthat if we just have a bunch of\ncheckboxes it doesn't work they're\ntrying to get closer to the factors that\nactually correlate with successful\nrelationships\nright so I mean this is It's not that\narranged marriages are good or we should\ngo back to them it's that they have some\nadvantages which is that if you grew up\nwith parents who understand what makes a\nhealthy relationship and if you assume\nthat your parents know you pretty well\nthen they can be very advantageous at\nhelping you find someone who would be a\ngood partner right they they can have\nthat information more than you can and\nin the current version of arranged\nmarriage it's usually not like you meet\nyour bride on the day or husband on the\nday of the marriage th those happen in\nIndia and some places still but nowadays\nthe way that arranged marriage works for\nmost like nris or other people is that\nyou basically like in in the western\nsystem right in America you date someone\nfor a while and then you have to meet\nthe parents face and that can go well or\nthat can go poorly right now in the\nIndian system it's just just reversed so\nthe parents pre-approve it's you've been\npre-approved for your loan you've\nalready been approved for this credit\ncard the parents do the pre-approval\nprocess then you go on a series of dates\nwith like five or six people 10 people\nhowever however many and then you keep\non dating people until you like one so\nit's just the steps are\nreversed let's make a\nbiodata I'm already married\nson\num\nyeah so someone the issue is forcing\narranged marriages to everyone yeah so\nthat absolutely happens and I do not\nagree with forced arranged marriage like\nthat's just you\nknow I think that that too comes from a\nI just don't think that's really viable\nanymore but you know there was a time in\nhuman history\nwhere Community kind of mattered way\nmore than the individual like you as an\nindividual had a responsibility\notherwise just we wouldn't survive like\nright so this was before we had a lot of\ntechnology and things like that so there\nwere like really simple things like in\nyour village of 300 so I was talking to\nmy Grandma about this and so she was\nkind of telling me that you know like\nthe one thing about arranged marriage is\nthat so what would happen is you'd fall\nin love with like people in your village\nright but they wouldn't let you marry\nanyone from your village you had to go\none or two Villages over to find a\npartner and why is that it's because\nchances are you're like somewhat related\nto the people in your\nvillage right cuz you all have been\nliving there for like generations and\ngenerations and generations and there's\nsome like so like they had this rule\nwhere like whoever you got married to\nhad to be from one or two Villages over\nthat was really the Only Rule they just\nwon't let you and who do you fall in\nlove with you never meet these people\nbecause you don't you the village over\nis like 20 miles away which is like a\nday's travel or something like that so\nthere were reasons why people had these\nkinds of rules and it was just a whole\ndifferent\nworld\nsomeone's asking Dr K how do I get a\ngirlfriend and stop being so shy around\ngirls we should talk about that let me\nthink we've got other posts though okay\nwe'll talk about shyness maybe at the\nend\num\nlet me think about\nanyway\nokay no I mean so so that that's where\nlike okay let's talk about this for a\nsecond so couple of things to understand\nthe first is that shyness as a\npersonality characteris IC does not\ncorrelate with introversion or\nextroversion this is very interesting so\nshyness also doesn't necessarily\ncorrelate with things like anxiety so a\nlot of people think that if I'm shy I'm\nan introvert that's actually not true so\nyou can be a shy extrovert which can be\nvery painful if you're a shy extrovert\nbecause you're shy but you really love\nhanging out with\npeople so if we understand what shyness\nis right so there's like a couple of\ndifferent parallel things that we tend\nto get mixed up and if you're struggling\nwith shyness the key thing is to try to\nunpack what we mean by the word shy\nbecause some of these things we don't\nwant to change it's part of who who you\nare and we love you for it but part of\nthat stuff can negatively impact things\nthat you want to do so case in point I\nam extremely shy I'm also an extreme\nextrovert so I mean introvert so I know\nit sounds kind of weird but like Dr K\nyou're streaming on the internet no I'm\nsitting in a room by myself on a weekday\nand I don't have to I don't even see\ny'all yall are just fictitious in my\nmind and nothing helps a shy person so\nmuch as imaginary people on the internet\nright it's like imaginary friends is\ntotally fine so first thing is that\nlet's understand what shyness is and\nmany people find shyness especially\ngirls will find shyness to be cute okay\num so let's understand what to do about\nthat so the big problem with chin is\nfirst of all it's not introverted or\nextroverted so you can be either or okay\nsecond thing is that often times the\nproblem with shyness is not the shyness\nit's the lack of confidence so someone\nwho is not confident and shy will stay\nin the corner whereas someone who is\nconfident and shy like I don't care to\nspeak to or get to know people I just\nit's not for me and you guys may say but\nthat's weird aren't you a psychiatrist\nand like don't you get to I love to get\nto people know people in that way but I\ndetest small talk like at a party like I\ndon't want to hang out with any of these\npeople but if if you're confident you\ncan right so then what what ends up\nhappening is I I'd say that you need to\nwork on your confidence and don't try to\nfix the shyness because that's sort of\nfixing a part of it's a personality\ncharacteristic you don't need to fix\nthat you need to fix the confidence so\nit's not that you should be less shy it\nis that you should have the\ncontrol over yourself to where if you\nare put in a situation that requires\ninteraction with other human beings you\ncan do so with full skill and effort you\nshould not be controlled by your shyness\nand that usually involves confidence so\nin my case what I really sort of think\nabout so here are a couple of tricks to\nbe confident okay I mean I guess it's a\ntrick but it's not really a trick the\nfirst is spend a little bit of time\nthinking how much does this person\nmatter and chances are you will discover\nI know this sounds kind of weird that\nthis person doesn't matter very much\nright so I'm not saying that human\nbeings don't matter I'm not trying to be\nan [ __ ] but often times when we are\nlack confidence we think to ourselves\nthat oh my God if I screw up this\nconversation with this person it's going\nto be so bad why you're not going to\ntalk to this person again right it's\nlike not that big of a deal there's like\n8 billion human beings on the planet you\ndon't need this one person to like you\nin this moment and then people get so\ncaught up about this with like job\ninterviews and dating and whatever right\nthere's lots of fish in the sea there\nare lots of human beings out there you\nhave to impress this\nperson that's number one right just\nthink to and if you kind of screw it up\nyou screw it up I've screwed up many\nsocial interactions in my life it's like\nusually people like forget about that\nkind of\nstuff second thing is that to remember\nthat often times you are a much harsher\ncritic of your behavior than other\npeople are so they just see your\noutsides whereas you are being fogged by\nyour outsides and your\ninsides\nright so if you're just like quiet and\nnot saying anything you can be in tons\nof internal emotional turmoil like oh my\nGod like I had something to say should I\njump in is it my turn to speak because\nthey seem to be talking and I have\nsomething good to\ncontribute but then like 60 or 90\nseconds go by and they've started to\nmove on to something else and now you're\nlike you're like bummed because damn it\nI had a good thing to say and I know\nthat I need a good thing to say to\nparticipate in the conversation but now\nthey've moved past it and now I go back\nto it that makes things awkward so then\nyou just sit there then you think about\nthat for another 30 seconds and then\nyou're like well now I haven't said\nanything for a while and I've been\nawkwardly silent and so there you are\ntorturing yourself and the other two\npeople are having a flowing conversation\nthey're not really paying attention to\nyou\nright so another\nthing is that often times when we are\nwhen it comes to confidence our\nconfidence or lack thereof is born of a\ncomparison but the problem is that the\ncomparisons we make are Franken stonan\nmonsters so we don't just compare oursel\nto one person with like 10 qualities\ndown the road or down the line what we\ndo is we compare we take our weakest\nquality and we take the strongest person\nwho has that quality and we can make\nthis comparison then we compare to this\nperson's head and this person's feet and\nthis person's career and this person's\nCharisma and this person's money and\nthis person's relationship and so we\nlook at all these different people and\nwe don't could do oneon-one comparisons\nwe don't look at the person who makes\nmore money than us and we tell ourselves\nyeah but this person is like a complete\ntrain wreck when it comes to\nrelationships and they've been divorced\ntwice we don't think that\nway so when it comes to a lack of\nconfidence be very careful about\ncomparison and ideally don't compare at\nall you or you and let other people\naccept you or reject you based on that\nand the last thing is if you are\ndeficient in some way improve upon it\nright but you don't need other people's\ncomparisons to show you that you can be\nbetter you can always be better and\nthat's what you should lean into and\ngenerally speaking once you develop\nconfidence and you are shy then that\ntends to solve the problem because then\nyou can go and you're still shy but you\ncan interact with people when you need\nto how do we develop and grow while it's\nnot comparing a little though with\npractice\nright so comparison exists in our brain\nto help us grow that's that we know that\nright so we make comparisons to pick\nidealized traits that we then move\ntowards the problem is that in society\ntoday this signal of comparison so let's\nunderstand this this is really\ninteresting so let's talk about how\ncomparison used to be good but is now\nharmful\nokay\nso shouldn't you compare yourself a\nlittle bit yes you should but just a\nlittle bit the problem is that it's hard\nto compare yourself a little\nbit so here's how comparison\nworks here is a human\nbeing here is a larger human being so\nthis human being looks at this human\nbeing and says oh my God I need to be\nbigger so there's a comparison\nand then usually when we have a\ncomparison we\ninduce a\nnegative motiva uh negative\nemotion and motivation okay so like I\nfeel\ninferior I feel guilt I feel shame\nusually right that's the most common\nthing or\nEnvy so if we sort of think about it\nthis is really important to understand\nlet me find you guys this paper\nhold on we're going to look at a cool\npaper\nchat uh what am I looking\nfor ah first one right out of the\n[Music]\nbat let me just make sure there's not a\nbetter\none\nokay so let's take a look at this\npaper amydala regulation of the nucleus\nofum commum dopamine output is governed\nby thee prefrontal\ncortex okay now I know this is kind of\nan esoteric paper or weird paper sounds\ntechnical so we're going to read one\nsentence of it then I'll explain the\nsignificance a dynamic interaction\nbetween the prefrontal cortex in the\nnucleus accumbens may be fundamental to\nregulation of goal directed Behavior by\nact affective in cognitive\nprocesses okay\nnow um in Freely moving rcts micro\nstimulation of basolateral amydala at\nintensities that produce mild behavioral\nactivation okay so this is important now\nlet's understand what the hell this is\ntalking about so here is my\nbrain and I have this little part over\nhere called the nucleus\ncumbent\nand this is where our\nmotivation and goal\ndirected\nBehavior comes\nfrom and guess what connects to it a\nlot this is my amydala\nand my lyic system this is where I\nexperience\nemotions especially negative emotions\nand this is really strong has very\npowerful connections here and controls\nour Behavior a lot and then here's our\nprfc prefrontal cortex and this guy\nbasically\nmodulates the interaction between these\ntwo things the key thing to understand\nis why do we make comparisons when we\nmake comparisons it induces a negative\nemotion which then goes over to the\nnucleus succumbent and induces a\nmotivational\nchange okay this is why comparison is\ngood\nnow why is comparison bad\nnowadays because of what happens with\nour negative\nemotion\nso if we look\nat um let's look at negative\nemotion on the x-axis and motivation on\nthe Y\nAIS so here's what's kind of interesting\nif someone has no negative emotion their\nmotivation will be relatively low you\ncan get motivated by other things and\nthen as negative emotion\nRises the motivation actually Rises\nuntil a critical point at which point\nnegative emotion lead leads to basically\nzero\nmotivation and what determines this\nthreshold so when our brains evolved we\nevolved with external stimuli in\ncomparisons that would induce this level\nof motivation this is what happened\nright so if you kind of think about a\ntribe of 300\npeople how many people in the tribe of\n300 are more attractive than you and how\nmany of those people how much more\nattractive are they than you so if I\nhave a tribe of 300 people we say\nthere's a bell curve right so like\n86% 86.5 right is going to be somewhere\nin the middle here so 7% are going to be\nover here and 7% are going to be over\nhere so that means that most of us are\nkind of in this middle of the\npack and then there's like a handful of\npeople like literally seven out of 100\nare going to be like noticeably more\nattractive and even then they're not\ngoing to be like you know mind-numbingly\nmore attractive than you so what ends up\nhappening is when someone is like one to\ntwo points higher than you you make a\ncomparison this motivates you a little\nbit by giving you some negative\nemotion then you motivate to change\nmaybe I should be more like that person\nnow in our current day when you look at\nfaces I know this sounds kind of weird\nbut just think about how many faces you\nsee every day what is the average\nattractiveness of those faces so I would\nventure that probably human beings see\nbetween 50 and 100\nfaces a day\ntoday and where do we see the majority\nof these faces I Venture that 80% of\nthem are on the\ninternet right so if you if you spend\nlike half an hour on Tik Tok you will\nsee 50 people's\nfaces and now let's think about this\nright because if you're spending time on\nsocial media what is the average\nattractiveness of the face it is very\nhigh because now what we're doing is\nwe're taking about four billion people\nand we are taking the most TRC of 1% and\nthose are going to be the faces that you\nsee so now what goes on is if you look\nat 86.5 what's one standard deviation of\nattractiveness when you're using the\ninternet it's like you know let's say an\n8.5 is the middle of the bell curve and\nthen the majority of the population is\nactually over here but you feel like\nyou're over here and so now what's\nhappened is we've created a comparison\nbetween an average of an 8.5 and a five\nand you think this is average and you're\njust a five you're actually average but\nthis is an this is a 3.5 Delta\nwhereas before we had like a onepoint\nDelta and now what started to happen is\nwe start to get a large negative\nemotion which then tips us past this\nthreshold in our motivation\ntanks so comparison used to be good and\nnow because of the nature of\ncomparison it is\nbad and people say are saying that I'm\nin the top\n1% I mean I don't think that that's true\nso I tend to make up for it right I'm\nnot on social media because I'm\npretty I'm on social media because\ntheoretically I am helpful or\nentertaining do you all get\nthat like seriously like understanding\nstatistics like if if if I had my way in\nschool I would teach every child\nstatistics there is so much\nmisinformation in the world right now\nand the number one thing that combats\nmisinformation is statistical\nanalysis right so once someone\nunderstands okay what is the sample size\nof what I'm seeing every\neveryone is whatever everyone is what is\nevery who is\neveryone who how do you know what\neveryone is doing there's eight billion\npeople on the planet how many of them\nare doing what you're talking about\neveryone is looksmaxing right now what\ndoes that mean\nlike so this is where I you know I I'd\nencourage y all to like the next time\nyou're at an airport hopefully you get\nto go to an airport from time to time\njust look at everyone and see what\npeople are doing and even that there's a\nsubset of the population that gets to\ntravel by\nair\nokay all\nright\nokay let's keep\ngoing before we keep going I just want\nto ask y'all do y'all get this business\nso this is important this business I\nknow this this paper sounds\nweird\nokay but this is this is important this\nis really important to understand if you\nguys are having trouble with your\nmotivation like negative emotions have a\nhuge part of\nit\num okay we've got a we've got a video\ncoming out about dopamine resistance\nsoon so this is going to be a video\nabout all of the things so if you can't\ncontrol I guess we're about to talk\nabout porn addiction so this is\nimportant to\nunderstand so if you can't control your\nbehavior and you addicted to something\ndope and energic the problem is that\nthe dopaminergic circuit in the brain is\nwhat creates\nmotivation this is why all of the stuff\nwe're addicted to is dopaminergic why\nisn't all the stuff we're addicted to\noxytocinergic or serotonergic or opioid\nnergic right why is it that all of our\naddictive substances are dopaminergic\nbecause dopamine is the one signal that\nis primary in our motivational\ncircuitry so so if you can't control\nbecause that's what the that's where\nyour motivation comes from so the real\nchallenge about things like porn\naddiction is you are not motivated to\nactually fix it and you may say but hold\non Dr K I want to fix it but let's\nunderstand this wanting up here and what\nyour body and your brain is motivated\ntowards are two different things I want\nto have a six-pack but I want to drink a\nsix-pack you all understand the\ndifference so your motivational circuit\nis not\nthinking big Mis big big big big\nmisunderstanding our capacity for\nthought and logic comes from our\ncerebral cores these are the parts that\nmake us\nhuman our\nmotivation oh anganga anganga smash is\nwhere our motivation comes from it's a\ncompletely different circuit and a lot\nof people get confused by this because\nthey get addicted to pornography and\nthey're like porn is destroying my life\nporn is destroying I can't stop that's\nbecause your motivational Tre is\nattracted to it so you're consciously\nyou may look at that you're like some\npilot that is sitting in a cloud and\nlooking at all the Primitives in your\nbrain that are attracted to breasts and\npenises and whatever and you're like\nthis is a mess like what do I do because\nthe motivational circuitry doesn't\ncare the other problem that we see with\npornography addiction is as you fall\nfurther into pornography\naddiction what ends up\nhappening\non let me show\nthis okay so here's the other problem\nhere's why you can't control porn\naddiction all right let's let's look at\nthis the other problem with controlling\nporn\naddiction all right so problem number\none that we just discussed is that this\nis where your thoughts come\nfrom okay or actually let me just start\nfrom scratch okay let's do this again\nwhy you can't control porn addiction in\na\nnutshell so here is my brain here's my\nnucleus\naccumbens here is my amydala\nand libic\nsystem okay so here's the paper that we\njust looked at amydala regulation of the\nnucleus accumbens dopamine output is\ngoverned by the prefrontal cortex okay\nso what this means this is negative\nemotions is over here\ndopamine\npleasure\nbehavioral\nenforcement and motivation come from\nhere and what we know is that this part\nof the brain controls this part of the\nbrain\nokay and then we know that our\nprefrontal cortex is over here now this\nis the controlling this is what makes us\nhuman our cerebral cortices is where\nthought comes from logic comes from and\nthen here is the Primitive brain down\nhere so the first thing is that you can\nsay to yourself okay I want to stop\npornography you look at it and you think\nlogically you you have thoughts I want\nto\nstop but I want to stop is just a\nthought it's coming from the top half of\nyour brain it's not coming from here the\nhunger for porn the actual motivation\nwhich correlates almost like a hunger\ncomes from down here and that's because\nporn gives us\ndopamine all right so it directly\nactivates your motivational circuitry\nthat's why we're so addicted to\ndopaminergic stuff instead of oxonic or\nserotonergic or whatever ad adreno\nadrenergic\nnoradrenergic right so like all of those\nother hormones neurotransmitters our\nbrain we don't get addicted to that\nstuff we get this is the good stuff\ndopamine\nyummy so wanting to stop comes from up\nhere but that's not real motivation it\nis a thought it is a it is an\nidea so that's why it's different\nthinking you want to stop porn and\nwanting to stop porn is different so now\nthe second thing that we need to\nunderstand is that when it comes to\npornography addiction remember this the\nnegative emotional circuitry controls\nthe nucleus succumbent so when we're\nstuck in a cycle of porn and we feel\nashamed of ourselves\nwhen we sh feel shame\nguilt what\nelse\nuh\nbored all of these are negative emotions\nthese are going to amplify this which\nwill amplify this which will cause us to\ngo into\nporn Okay so thinking about wanting to\nstop porn addiction doesn't\nwork the more negative emotional\ncircuitry the more netive emotions we\npile up the more we become dependent on\nporn because this is your brain's way of\nbalancing the negative\nemotions the other thing that's very\nimportant to understand about\npornography is one of the variables that\ncorrelates the most with pornography is\nmeaninglessness and this is the way that\nI understand this so if you look\nat logistic regression or multivariate\nanalyses on porn addiction so what does\nthat mean if we take a hundred people\nwho are addicted to\nporn and we ask them we do like a\npersonality assessment we do a\npsychological assessment what are the\nvariables that float to the top so we'll\nask them are you depressed are you\nanxious are you whatever were you abused\ngrowing up were your parents divorced\nwe'll ask a thousand\nquestions and one of the top two things\nthat comes up is\nmeaninglessness and here's the way that\nI understand it so then I with some porn\nporn addicts right when I work with porn\naddicts this is what I\ndiscover you have to have a reason to\nnot watch porn in order to not watch\nporn you got to have something in your\nlife the people that are the most\naddicted to pornography usually have\nsome kind of profound emptiness in their\nlife and sometimes we'll see people who\nare like so sometimes this is like I'm\n25 years old I sit at home I'm\nunemployed I have no friends whatever\nsometimes at someone who's really like\nyou know got nothing for them in life\nbut you'd be amazed at what percentage\nof\npeople\nare financially successful\nprofessionally successful in\nrelationships but there's usually\nsomething\nmissing and so overcoming this addiction\ninvolves a couple of different steps the\nfirst is it involves finding that\nmeaning because you have to have a\nreason to not stop and your partner\nbeing mad at you is sometimes not\nsufficient and why is that so if y'all\nhave been paying attention Okay let's\nlook one last time when my partner is\nmad at me for watching pornography what\ndo you think that does to my brain chat\nwho can\nguess what happens when my partner is\npissed\nuh\nI gotta see if I can\nthere makes me feel negative beautiful\nbrilliant y'all get it so that when your\npartner gets mad at\nyou this fuels that which just fuels the\nwhole\ncycle right and this is why people like\nwhen your partner pressures you to stop\nwatching porn you usually do it for a\nwhile so there's a a time while your\nfrontal\nloes are inhibiting the circuit but one\nday they fall short one day you're\nexhausted one day you didn't get a full\nnight's sleep one day you had something\nelse go bad in your life some negative\nevent\nhappened and then it's too much and your\nfrontal loes aren't able to compensate\nand then you\nrelapse and then your partner gets very\nconfused because they're like I thought\nyou had this under control and then they\nlose trust in you you lose trust in\nyourself you're really confused you did\nit well for so well but now they're even\nmore pissed at you you start to get\nhopeless everything just fuels the\npornography and why is\nthat it's because when it comes to\npornography sex is such a vital part of\nhuman\nevolution that it affects every part of\nour\nbrain and sex is so powerful remember\nthe desire procreate is so powerful that\nwe basically shut everything else off\nall of our negative emotions go away\nit's highly dopam\nenergic even yogis in Ancient India will\nsay that one of the easiest ways to\nenter brief samadi is\norgasm right so or samadi is temporary\nEnlightenment the moment of orgasm is ah\nBlissful right so it's such a powerful\nthing and this is what we get addicted\nto now let's talk about pornography for\na second\nspecifically so anytime we get there's a\nbeautiful experiment that happened with\nbeetles and green glass bottles so what\na group of researchers noticed is that\nthere there was a group of beetles a\ncertain kind of beetle that were humping\nand trying to procreate with green glass\nbottles and people got really confused\nand they were like why is this why are\nall these beetles like this Beetle\npopulation is dying because instead of\nhaving sex with each other they're\nhaving sex with green glass bottles and\nso the re researchers started studying\nthis and what they discovered is that\nwhen you have something called a\nsupranormal\nstimulus it activates our sexual\ncircuitry in the brain and we gravitate\ntowards it very very\npowerfully okay and so if you look at\npornography what does pornography do it\nis a supernormal stimulus it's not\nnormal breasts it's not a normal penis\nit's not normal colors with normal\nlooking people everything everything is\nAmplified everything is artificial\neverything is bigger everything is\nbrighter the color saturation is jacked\nup right everything is more intense\nthere are more people\ninvolved so it's a supernormal stimulus\nthat then activates the circuitry more\nintensely and as it activates the\ncircuitry more intensely we get more\ndopamine release in the nucleus\naccumbent we get more emotional\nsuppression and what you tend to see in\npeople who are addicted to pornography\nis that over time they will gravitate\ntowards harder and hard hardcore porn\nright because that that supernormal\nstimulus then becomes a normal\nstimulus and then what'll happen is you\nrequire that supernormal stimulus to get\nthat same level of dopamine to get that\nsame level of emotional suppression so\nyou need it to be more\nhardcore\nokay\nquestions\nokay while we're waiting for questions\nyall can ask I'll keep I'll keep track\nof them okay um so let's take a quick\nlook at this\npost how long does it take to recover\nfrom a porn\naddiction it's kind of embarrassing um I\ndon't want I so I won't elaborate too\nmuch but it feels like it taking way too\nlong addiction and it feels impossible\nhow long does it take to beat a porn\naddiction I know this might might sound\na bit too vague but I would appreciate\nit a lot if you guys would help me\nespecially those who have beaten the\naddiction maybe I'm asking too much but\nif you guys could potentially give me\ntips okay says Johnny sin's Fanboy okay\nso let's talk about beating an\naddiction so first thing you've got to\nunderstand is that an addiction is not\nyou can't beat an\naddiction so if you even like use that\nterminology right so this implies that\nthere is an opponent and once the\nopponent is vanquished it is dead\nforever I have won the game is over\nthat's not how addictions work so\naddictions are things that are with you\nall the time you never win you just win\nthe battle today you can't ever really\nwin the war I mean you can get to that\nlater but so that that's the first thing\nis that this is why where a biggest\nmistake that so many people make with\npornography addiction is that they try\nto beat it how do I Vanquish it and why\nis that it's because people are tired of\ndealing with it so the desire to beat it\ncomes out of a fantasy of no longer\nwanting to fight it every\nday really a\nproblem working as an addiction\npsychiatrist the worst thing that I want\nis a patient who thinks they they have\nbeaten their\naddiction because that's when the\naddiction really trips you up your guard\nis down now that you've won it is people\nwho have constant vigilance until\ncertain neuroscientific changes are made\nthat that's really when you can conquer\nit but for now don't try to beat it try\nto resist so how do you do that how long\ndoes it take to beat a porn addiction so\nthat two depends on how many factors are\nthere that are driving you towards porn\nand how many fact are driving you away\nfrom\nporn so for example if you use\npornography to as a antidote to boredom\nas long as you are bored you will have\nan interest in\npornography as long as you use\npornography as an emotional regulation\ntechnique as long as your emotions are\nDisturbed you will lean towards\npornography so this is where what we\nreally need to do is understand okay\nthere's a dop op energic signal there's\nan emotional signal there's an\nemotionally suppression signal and then\nthere's a component of just like the\nbrain is like if we're not doing\nanything today let me at least get that\nhit of dopamine right that's how it\nthinks so really overcoming pornography\naddiction is not in addressing the\naddiction directly which there is a part\nof that it's really in understanding\nwhat are all the risk factors that are\ncontributing to the pornography\naddiction and that's what we try to do\nwhen we do addiction\nPsychiatry so is the substance itself\nlet's use an example of alcohol there's\nthe whole Act of not taking a drink but\nthen there is also what goes into that\nwhich is okay let's do Psychotherapy to\nunderstand why you started drinking in\nthe first place let's understand what\nyour triggers are let's understand like\nall of the par alcoholic\nBehavior and the problem that I see with\na lot of people who struggle with\npornography addiction is that first of\nall a lot of clinicians don't specialize\nin it they don't really understand how\nit\nworks and secondly they don't fix all of\nthe environment right so for example a\nbig part of overcoming alcohol addiction\nis changing your community so if you go\nhang out with your friends who go to the\nbar or you go hang out with your friends\nwho are part of a frat you're going to\ndrink so you have to find new friends\nbut what's the community of pornography\nthe community of pornography is\nloneliness so it's very\ndifficult you can tell an alcoholic not\nto go to a bar it is far harder to tell\na pornography addict to no longer be\nlonely this is why pornography addiction\nis\nskyrocketing sure things are getting\nmore into the supernormal stimulus realm\nbut really it's that what's the\ncommunity of pornography it's\nloneliness and so when we when I really\nsee good outcomes with people who\novercome pornography addiction they have\nmore meaning in their lives and they\nhave more\nCommunity but that's very difficult to\ndo so what is the bar of pornography\nright so the bar is the physical\nlocation that you go to drink where do\nyou watch\npornography and where do you\nmasturbate usually at home right those\nof the people that don't do it at home\nare the ones who wind up on sex offender\nRegistries wind up in jail\nthose kinds of things and so how do you\nget away from your house this is why\npornography addiction is so bad\ntoday ease of\naccess\nubiquitous supernormal stimulus\nemotionally unregulated\npopulation so at what we're doing is our\nbrains we're getting worse and worse at\nemotional regulation you see this with\nall the carens on the internet you see\nit with people posting all this toxic\nstuff this misogyny and all this kind of\nstuff every corner of the the internet\nis filled with just negative emotion and\nthen you have safe spaces that are just\nventing just vomiting all of this\nnegative emotion\nconstantly and so the the the world is\nbecoming more emotionally\ndisregulated and so what is our Silver\nBullet what is the brain's Silver Bullet\nwhen it comes to emotional regulation\npornography\nright it's not a controlled substance so\nI don't have to get someone to prescribe\nit for me it's not illegal so I don't\nhave to like hang out with a drug dealer\nit doesn't cost me my rent usually\nthere's a whole\nother aspect of like only fans and\nparasocial relationships we're not going\nto get\ninto so imagine if like heroin was like\nfreely available on the internet and you\ndon't have to pay for\nit right what would use be\nlike just everyone had all the equipment\nin their own\nhomes so we if you look at any addictive\nsubstance it gives pleasure and it takes\naway\npain and porn does that very well right\nporn is the one addiction that accesses\nthe one part of our brain not the one\npart of our brain the one function that\naccesses all parts of our brain I'll\ngive you all an example of\nthis so I was trying to figure out\num\nuh trying to show you all this paper but\nI have to find\nit\nsee yeah I want to open 20 20\ntabs nope\nnope nope nope\n[Music]\nnope give me a second\nchat h no this looks like it's the\nwrong okay couldn't find it I'll try to\nfind it later oh maybe it's an\nolder\nthese are all oh oh here we go oh I\nfound it hey hey I found it hold on chat\nokay hey here we go okay so here's the\nother thing to understand why why is\npornography so damn\naddicting neuroanatomy and function of\nhuman sexual behavior a neglected or\nknown issue so I was trying to figure\nout I tried to look at like okay what\npart of the brain does pornography\naffect\neffect okay sexual behavior is regulated\nby both subcortical structures such as\nthe hypothalamus brain stem spinal cord\nand several cortical brain areas acting\nas an orchestra to finally adjust this\nprimitive complex and versatile Behavior\nchef's kiss of\nNeuroscience okay now let's just\nlook table one summary of the brain\nareas involved in s human sexual\nbehavior basically all of\nthem the reward\nsystem okay like basically your home\nwhole\nbrain wait wait it gets\nbetter neurotransmitters and modulators\nsummary of the main neurotransmitters\nand modulators involved in regulating\nhuman sexual behavior basically all of\nthem\nokay see yeah so it's like\nwhat does pornography addiction affect\nthe whole brain all of the\nneurotransmitters and this is why it's\nso hard\nto see like for example when we look at\nalcohol\naddiction we literally have pills you\ncan take for alcohol addiction things\nlike\nNaltrexone and what Naltrexone does it\ngoes to the\narea where the alcohol binds to a\nreceptor in your brain and it blocks\nthat binding so we can literally give\nyou a pill that will block the effect of\nalcohol in the brain we also have\nmedications like like dulam so dulam is\na devious\nmedication so when we make when we drink\nalcohol there are two steps in the\nmetabolism of alcohol I think we turn it\nfirst into an acetal alahh or something\nlike that and then we turn it into\nwhatever the final product is so the\ninteresting thing is that alcohol called\nthat middle step so it gets turned in\nfrom A to B and B to C okay a is okay C\nis okay but B is toxic as [ __ ] so we\ngive a medication that blocks the\nconversion from B to C and then this\nmetabolite builds up and makes people\nviolently ill so if you take your Dulan\npill and you drink alcohol you will be\nviolently\nill so we can do this when it comes to a\nsubstance we can like literally give you\na pill that will make you ill if you\ndrink\nalcohol but when it comes to pornography\nit affects the whole brain all of the\nneurotransmitters and so it's hard to\nlike fix it just like this and that's\nwhy the treatment for treatment\novercoming pornography addiction is so\nmuch more\nholistic right it it involves emotional\nregulation finding purpose finding\nmeaning hopefully having a a healthy\nsexual relationship another thing that\nwe understand about por pornography is\nthat it's not even about sex it's not\nabout relationships or lust or anything\nlike that many of the people I've worked\nwith with pornography addiction I don't\nknow about the majority usually get\nexposed to pornography pre puberty so\neven before their brain knows they're\nnot aroused by it at all they get this\nsupranormal\nstimulus in their developing brains\nwhich then shapes their brain to be\nvulnerable to pornography later in\nlife\nand we know for example that marijuana\nis a gateway drug why is it a gateway\ndrug because it Alters the parts of our\nbrain that M that then become more\nvulnerable to addiction so it Alters the\nstructure of our reward\ncircuitry and once you alter the\nstructure of your reward circuitry now\nyou can have a huge vulnerability to\naddiction which is what we see in\nmarijuana in developing\nbrains and so with pornography this is\nwhat tends to happen I've noticed that\nthe more the younger you are when you\nget exposed to pornography it appears\nthat the higher the risk is although I\ndon't have data to back that up that's\njust clinical\npractice\nokay\nso Tober nil is saying I feel like I'm\ndoomed okay so here's the thing to\nunderstand you're not\ndoomed\nokay but\nbut fixing a pornography\naddiction in my opinion for a fair\nnumber of people okay so this isn't an\nabsolute involves fixing your\nlife so in a sense it is solvable and\nsome people get really upset by that\nthey're like I have to fix my whole life\nlike sort of yeah on the flip\nside having fixing pornography addiction\nas your main quest in life will\nnecessitate\nthat all of the things that everybody\nelse is doing as a main quest become\nside\nquests now they be they become boxes to\ncheck that you need to do in order to\nfix the pornography addiction Find\nmeaning find purpose build a career get\nphysically healthy go to the gym so as\nyou chase this insurmountable goal every\nother part of your life will fall in\norder because that's what it takes to\novercome and so it's it's actually like\nreally interesting because I've seen\npeople with pornography addiction the\nprocess of overcoming their addiction\nmeans that they square away every corner\nof their\nlife there's also a karmic perspective\nthat sometimes I've had discussions with\nmy patients about because I'll ask them\nabout this kind of stuff right because\nit's about meaning so why do you think\nyou were given this\naddiction and they'll kind of say that\nuntil I really fixed every corner of my\nlife like it always came back it was a\nsignal to me from the universe that I'm\nnot living my life in the right way and\nthen once I started living my life the\nright way the pornography addiction got\nfixed literally these are my patients\nwords not\nmine then even if I did it 80% I would\nrelapse so I needed to really give it\n100% And then they'll tell me the\nweirdest thing pornography addiction is\nthe best thing that ever happened to\nme and now I understand this because\nthen I'll ask them well what what what\nmakes you feel that way help me\nunderstand how you arrived to that concl\nand he's like this has really made me\nrealize what I appreciate about life and\nlike how important these things are and\nlike what kind of life I want to live\nright there's all this dopaminergic\nemotional regulation crap which is a\nfalse life it's not a real life it's an\nempty\nlife and then in the process of getting\nrid of that I've had to build\nrelationships I've had to be comfortable\nin my body I've had to do all kinds of\nother things\nright so we have a we have a guide\nsomeone saying that this reminds me of\nmy trauma so this is a huge perspective\nthat's very important for\ntrauma we've done lectures and stuff on\npost-traumatic growth which yall can\ncheck out we have a guide coming up I\nguess I'm spoiling it sort of so I just\nfinished filming a guide where we dig\ninto all this kind of more spiritual\nstuff yeah so have also have higher\nexpectations from their Partners\nabsolutely Ely man so I think that the\nthe the whole partner thing is so\ncomplicated\nuh okay yeah I'll try to fix my audio\nit's because I scooted back it's it's a\nvery sensitive mic thanks for that\nfeedback\nokay all right let's look at other\nstuff so I'm shamelessly stealing\ncharacteristics of people I want to be\nlike is it bad analyzing my favorite\ncharacters so I can shamelessly steal\ntheir personalities\nokay\nso I don't think this is\nbad and let's understand\nwhy so if you look at other people's\npersonality\ncharacteristics and you start stealing\nthem I think that's good that's totally\nfine even if they're fictional doesn't\nmatter in order for this to be harmful\nor helpful we have to understand the\ndifference between personality and\nidentity so if you adopting other\npeople's personality characteristics and\nit is not becoming a part of your\nidentity then this is\ngreat if you are confounding the two\nthen we have a problem so now a lot of\npeople people may wonder what is the\ndifference between personality and\nidentity\nso we have good science on this okay so\npersonality is who you\nare and p uh identity is who you think\nyou are and it's fine for you to craft\nyourself into whoever you are that's\ntotally fine but don't pretend you're\nthat I know it's kind of confusing so\nI'll explain so in science in basically\npsychological research we've defined\nwhat personality is and what personality\nis is the way that you interpret\ninformation the what your internal\nreaction is followed by what your\nactions are so if we look at people of\ntwo different personalities let's say\nI'm wandering I'm going for a hike with\nmy friend and we see a\nbear so I get excited because I watched\nthis Tik Tok earlier of people like\npetting bears in the woods and I was\nlike wow what an amazing opportunity I\nwant to be one with nature they're so\nbeautiful they're such majestic\ncreatures and so I walk towards the bear\nhoping to pet it and my friend starts\nshading themselves so we look at this\nsituation the situation is exactly the\nsame right for both of us we're two\npeople going on a hike the circumstances\nare exactly the same the weather's the\nsame the bear is the same bear is the\nsame size bear is the same color\nsituation is exactly the same\nthe personality determines how I\ninterpret this\ninformation how I react to it excitement\nversus fear and how I act walk towards\nit versus walk\naway so you can take this for any number\nof things let's say like you go to your\nschool dance and you're 16 years old do\nor you go to a party are you in the\ncorner so we're at a party there I don't\nknow anyone here this is a fact of the\nmatter depending on my personality this\ncan be very exciting I don't know anyone\nhere let's meet new people people or\nthis can be very exciting I don't know\nanyone here no one knows my shitty\nreputation time to [ __ ] up other\npeople's\nlives or I don't know anyone here I feel\nvery awkward I don't know who to talk to\nI don't know how to start a conversation\nso the circumstances can be exactly the\nsame the way that we interpret that\ninformation the way that we internally\nreact to it and the way that we end up\nacting determines our\npersonality now notice in these\nscenarios there's no sense of I\nright so when I see this bear in the\nwoods I get excited about the bear but I\ndon't think to myself I'm a bear lover I\nam a this I am a that this is who I am\nyou don't think about that it is the way\nthat you react interpret information\nyour internal reaction and how you act\nhas nothing have to do with your\nidentity yall get that if you really pay\nattention to the examples that I\nprovided there's no sense of\ney so in that way if you look look at\nsomeone's personality the way that they\ninterpret information that the way that\nthey internally react and the way that\nthey act in a circumstance by all means\nadopt someone else's\npersonality this is actually healthy in\nsome\nways right so when you have figures that\nyou're inspired by like\nparents there are times in your life\nwhere if you're lucky and you've got a\ngood set of parents you will adopt their\npersonality characteristics because your\nparents will help you do that that's\nliterally their job so you'll have a\nsetback in life you you asked your crush\nout and they said no and then you feel\ndevastated your interpretation of them\nsaying no or they don't even say no they\nsay I'm not looking to date right now\nwhich you viw is 100% rejection that's\njust something they're telling you to\nspare your feelings but you know that\ndeep down they don't want anything to do\nwith you ignore what they said because\nthey're\nLiars and then you internally react\nthat's your internal reaction and then\nyou act I'm never going to ask anyone\nout\nagain so your parent comes along and\ntries to shape your personality let's\nreinterpret the information what did\nthey actually say oh they said they're\nnot looking to date right now how do you\nknow that they don't like\nyou now I want I want to ask you a\nquestion I'm just\ncurious let's say that they did like you\nbut that their life is chaotic what\nwould they say to you if they really\nliked you but could not date\nyou huh interesting they may not say no\nthey may say I can't date right now or\nI'm not looking to date right now oh\ninteresting so there's a different\ninterpretation that could be true so\nchange your interpretation what's your\ninternal reaction so you start to get\nvery upset let's learn some emotional\nregulation techniques let's go for a\nwalk let's talk about\nlife right so change your internal\nreaction observe your internal reaction\nand then change your action I'm never\ngoing to ask anyone out\nagain right so let's change that so bile\nmeans adopt someone else's personality\nright so take\ncharacteristics break them down into\nthose three pieces and then if that's\nwhat you want to be in your life you can\ndo it go for\nit the problem is adopting someone\nelse's\nidentity okay this is a completely\ndifferent\nthing if you start to think of your\npersonality as identity then that is\ncringe\nokay so let's understand this let's say\nthat you are really good with\npeople and the moment you start that's\ngreat it's wonderful you're you're\nextroverted you're charismatic you're\nsocial fine all of those things\nwonderful the moment that you think if\nyou don't understand what cringe is you\ncan take someone who's very charismatic\nwhat makes them\ncringe identifying as charismatic I'm\nthe most charismatic person in the world\nlook at me I'm so Charis charismatic I'm\nso sexy you want me you need me uhhuh\nthat becomes\ncringe anything when we identify with it\nbecomes cringe let's say I'm sad and I'm\ndepressed right this is something that\ndeserves compassion it deserves help it\ndeserves support doesn't make you weak\nor anything like that sometimes\ndepression happens to people so be it\nsome people make it their\nidentity I've had them as patience right\nthat becomes cringe\nI am depressed I am depressed I am I can\nnever get better I can get never get\nbetter I can never get better we still\ndeserve I think we should give them\ncompassion and stuff right that's what\nwe\ndo you're going love video games but if\nyou become a gamer right I'm a gamer oh\nthose aren't real games a real gamer\nplays these games that's\ncringe so the moment that personality\nbecomes identity we've entered the realm\nof\ncringe even something as simple as but\nwhat about other qualities like humility\noh my God the most cringe of all of\nthese is identity based on\nhumility being humble is fantastic if\nyour personality is one who's humble\nokay like I'm not entitled to anything I\ndon't interpret that I should have I\nbought a lottery ticket I have a one in\na billion chance that I'm going to win\nthis is how it is being humble is\nwonderful having an identity is humble I\nsaw this so much in the asham look at\nhow humble I am look at how spiritual I\nused to be like that arguably I'm still\nlike that and still I haven't figured it\nout yet I'm sure a year from now I will\nfigure out that there's some part of my\nidentity that is\ncringe look at how humble I am everyone\nelse is arrogant but I'm so\nhumble he's like not like the other boys\nor not like the other girls right like I\nlook at me like I'm so I'm so different\ncringe so if you seriously if you want\nsomeone else's personality go for it\nright but let's understand what\npersonality is it is way you interpret\ninformation by all means interpret\ninformation in a more optimistic and a\nhealthier way go for\nit right if you're looking because I was\nlooking at this this and I see all these\nlike anime characters right and like\nthat's cool like I think you can take\ncharacteristics from anime and try to be\nmore like those people like\nfine hopefully not the cringe\nones right so if you and that's what\nhuman beings are like we talked a little\nbit about comparison\nearlier and and like that's part of it\nyou compare yourself to other people\nlike your parents and we are wired to\nadopt some of those behaviors this is\nwhy peer pressure is a thing because our\nbrain is wired to adopt what other\npeople do this is healthy just don't get\nit confused with your identity and by\nall means change the way that you\ninterpret information change the way\ninterpret information in a better way\nwhether that's more skepticism or less\nskepticism whatever right depends on the\nperson depends on who you're looking up\nto depends on the change you need to\nmake change the way that you react to\nthings by all\nmeans react to something like a hero in\nan anime where when the their\ndisadvantage instead of giving up and\njerking off for a week they decide to\nactually like give it a shot even if\nthey could lose go for\nit right go for\nit be more compassionate and accepting\nof people's quirks because that's a\npersonality characteristic you see\nsomeone have in a fictional Universe go\nfor\nit just don't let it cross the realm the\nboundary into identity and if we\nactually see it a lot of these people\nwho are like super into anime right the\nreason that they're so cringe is because\nthey adopt it as an identity not as a\npersonality you all get it does it make\nsense what are good identity\ncharacteristics\nwe've got a lecture coming up on that uh\nWednesday but we're doing deep dive in I\nwon't go into more detail but let's take\na look at identity\nokay we have a we have a post so we'll\ntalk about a little bit about it now\nokay why does everyone talk about the\nego as if they're not the ego that's\ndoing the talking everyone seems to\nrefer to the ego as if it's a as if it's\nseparate from the one typing or talking\njust as a thought arises so do these\nwords I'm typing as well as the words I\nspeak it's like everyone is trying to\ntranscend this voice in their head or\nwhatever but the voice in the head is\nwhat's creating these words I type as\nwell as the words I\nspeak do people understand this or have\nthey just created a super ego that\nthinks it's separate from the thoughts\nand words when reflecting upon what\nthey've seen when explaining to me it\nseems as if the program has realized its\nprogram but other people seem to think\nthat the words they write and say are\nnot coming from the from thought SL ego\nI'm not referring to the awareness or\nConsciousness that's observing all of\nthis just referring to the seemingly\nlarge number of people who think they're\nnot an ego when\ncommunicating\nokay so if you are confused\nbecause everyone's talking about ego but\nisn't it oh whoops isn't it just the ego\nthat's doing the talking no it's not so\nif you all want to understand this it's\nvery simple okay maybe it's confusing\nbut I think it's relatively simple the\nfirst is that thoughts and ego are not\nthe\nsame so we're going to use a lot of\nSanskrit here because I think Sanskrit\nis a very very sophisticated language\nand we run into this problem here with\nEnglish because English does not have\nthe language to specify these\ndifferences so the first thing is that\nthis person says thought SL ego\nwhich implies that thoughts and ego are\nthe same thing right so if you're using\nlike you know good slash right like that\nimplies and this is precisely this\nperson's problem I according to\nme is that they haven't understood that\nthe mind has different parts and that\ndifferent parts can observe and act on\neach other so let's understand\nthat okay so we're going to use the\nSanskrit phrase\nAnana so antakarana is often times\ntranslated as the mind but man is mind\nsuch an unsophisticated representation\nof it so antakarana literally means\ninternal instrument and that is the best\ndefinition so if we look at our lives\nokay there is this physical body we have\nhands we have eyes we have nose and all\nof these things things are designed to\ninteract with the outside world so I can\npick up a pen so that the hand is really\ninteresting because it is a sensory\norgan and is it it is an organ of action\nI can affect a willpower change in the\nexternal world with my hands and I can\nget information from the outside world\nwith my hands the whole body is an\nexternal instrument I can taste things\nfrom the outside I can my body will let\nme know whether this is healthy or\nunhealthy because I'll get sick or feel\ngood after I eat something so we have\nthis instrument that allows us to\nconnect with the\nexternal and then we have this\ninstrument that is internal this is the\nAnar this is the\nmind now let's understand so much like\nthe body has hands feet Eyes Nose we\nhave five senses we have many organs of\naction right we can do things with our\nheet feet we can do things with our\nhands we can do things with our voice we\ncan affect change in the outside world\nwith many instruments that are part of\nthe body so what are the parts of the\nantakarana the internal\ninstrument so the first question\nis thoughts and ego because this is what\nthis person is confused\nabout so can I think without having an\nego\nabsolutely right so if we look at what\nis the ego the ego is the sense of ey so\nan ego is something that's me mine\nthat's what ego is so even in the west\nand the east we kind of agree that there\nis a quality of possessiveness there is\na quality of meanness there is a quality\nofus we know there's this part of the\nbrain called the default mode Network\nwhich is probably where this part of the\nInus\nlives we also know that the me has a\nspatial location so I know this sounds\nkind of weird but you the Unice of you\nexist somewhere over here you're not in\na different room right now you're where\nyou are right and that sounds kind of\nweird but we also know that you can\nelectrically stimulate the the\ntemporoparietal junction of the brain\nand you can trigger a Out of Body\nExperience you can have an eye that is\noutside of the physical location of your\nbody so there's a certain\nInus so you can the the function of\nthought is separate from the function of\nego so ego is identity it's like who I\nam okay in Sanskrit we have the word\naara which\nmeans the sense of eye or eyess\nbut you can think about things without\nego it is you that's doing the thinking\nyes but you're not thinking in terms of\nego like I can just drink this\nwater there's no ego involved in that\nright I'm just drinking water and you\ncan say but you're saying you're saying\nyou're drinking water but yeah but that\ncould be unconscious too I could just\ndrink the water so we have thoughts we\nhave emotions and then we have so\nemotions are different from thoughts\nright so they're feelings those things\nare different those are two different\nparts of the Mind two different parts of\nthe\nantakarana and then we have the ego so\nthe ego is anytime you have an eye\nstatement that is the ego so I am good\nat this I am good at that that requires\na judgment of a an identity\ncompound anytime we make a comparison\ninvolves the ego because I cannot say\nthat you are taller or shorter without\nme being taller or shorter so you can\nmake comparisons to nonp people that's\nnot ego but anytime you make a\ncomparison to someone else that involves\nthe ego because you can't say that you\nare taller or shorter unless you have an\nidentity and so the ego is a part of the\nmind it can be observed just like your\nthoughts just like your emotions you can\nnotice the function of ego it's trickier\nit's\nsubtler but you can even notice any eye\nstatement that you make is is a thought\nright and it's being sort of run by the\nego then we know that we can exist with\negoless States so really good example of\nan egoist state is if you ever jump into\na body of water that is a little bit\ncold for a moment you're just pure\nexistence you're not fat or thin you're\nnot silly or smart you're not successful\nor a failure you're not poor or Rich for\na moment you're just jump into the water\nand then you exist fully in that moment\nyou're not notay P attention you're not\nthinking about video games or distracted\nor anything like that you're fully\npresent right there for just a flash of\na second but you have no sense of\nidentity if you really pay attention\nyou'll find\nthis and so this is the ego and it's not\nthe same as thought it's not the same as\nemotion and then we sort of get to this\nthis ultimate idea which the person kind\nof alludes to in in their\npost right which\nis um\nI'm not referring to the awareness or\nConsciousness that's observing this\nthat's what's ultimately at the end of\nit okay is that there is a Consciousness\nthe act of witness observation or\nexperience is ultimately like what's\neven beyond the\nantakarana so the Anar the internal\ninstrument or the mind has thoughts it\nhas emotions it has\nego has two other things some scars like\nmemories and it's got a a location of\nsorts called the jit\nit's got a space where all these things\ninteract and then beyond that is pure\nConsciousness and so when this person\nsays it seems to me as if the program\nhas realized it's a program it's not the\nprogram that realizes it's a program\nit's the Consciousness that realizes\nthat there is a program running so you\nhave a witnessing capability which can\nwitness your thoughts can witness your\nemotions and can witness your\nego but the witnesser itself is does\ndoesn't have any ego qualities because\nit is just the screen on which\neverything else is\nprojected right so I don't know if this\nmakes sense but like you know you can\nhave a lot of pixels on the screen but\nthe TV itself doesn't\nchange everything all of the images that\nare projected on the screen can change a\nlot your thoughts can change your\nemotions can change but that Which\nexperiences has never changed that's the\nyou your body has changed your mind has\nchanged but you have not changed what\nmakes you you your personality has\nchanged what makes you you is you're the\none who experiences every moment of your\nlife this is why it's so hard for other\npeople to understand you because they\ndon't experience the other parts of your\nlife right if everyone could share\nexperiences everyone would understand\neach\nother the whole challenge in life is\nyou're the only one that experiences\nyour life and yet you are always\nexperiencing it you don't get a break\nfrom it for even a moment this quality\nof experience is the most fundamental\nthing and that is what observes the ego\nit isn't the ego observing the ego and\nthere's a very simple way to understand\nthis so when someone is behaving\negotistically do they know they are\nbehaving e egotistically not at all\ny'all get\nthat the more head the more of their\nhead that someone has up their ass the\nless aware they are the ego dominates\nthe mind it is dominates the antakarana\nand as it dominates the Anar you lose\nawareness narcissists don't know they're\nnarcissists that's the whole\nproblem how do you demolish narcissism\nyou raise\nawareness as they become more aware the\nnarcissism reduces\nliterally if we look at things like\ndialectical behavioral therapy which\nis regarded by many as the best\nevidence-based treatment for borderline\npersonality disorder which is a cluster\nB personality disorder and the cluster B\npersonality disorders also include\nnarcissism so what do BPD and narcissism\nshare they share a very unhealthy\nego that's the root of it unhealthy in\ndifferent ways and so mindfulness helps\nboth so the more we move away from the\nego the more that the symptoms of these\nclinical illnesses\nimprove\nand so ego doesn't observe\nitself okay and now if y'all are really\npaying attention some of y'all may ask\nthe question okay\nbut you know what is it so if if the\nwitness or the experiencer can observe\nthe ego what is it that observes the\nwitness and the cool thing is people may\nsay is there a witnesser Beyond\nwitnesser right so I witness my life\nlife but is there something beyond that\nis there something beyond that is it\nbasically like turtles all the way down\nand the answer is no there is an end of\nthe\nroad and the witnesser is the end of the\nroad but you can't understand that until\nyou get really\ngood at looking beyond the Anar to your\nawareness until you learn how to move\npast emotions thoughts and ego to what\nit what is experiencer and then you try\nto look beyond that you can keep looking\nand then you'll find the answer it makes\nsense once you find\nit right there's just one it's not like\nthe TV is pixels on another TV which is\npixels on another TV right so we can\neven do this like this is cool let's do\nit\nchat right so this is what it kind of\nlooks like but no this it it it isn't\ninfinitely\nregressive thankfully so and the way\nthat we know that is because if you\nactually get rid of the UN K if you stop\nall thoughts all emotions and all ego\nand you are just witnessing in a raw way\nthere's nothing Beyond it that's full it\nfeels\ncomplete it's you have to experience it\nbut by all means go looking for\nsomething Beyond ego and I mean beyond\nthe witnesser and prove me\nwrong go for it right this is just once\nagain the ego of me oh my God my\nexperiences must be generalized to\neverybody\nI could be wrong I could be an idiot in\nfact I am an idiot so check it out for\nyourselves I feel like I am not in\ncontrol of the witness though yeah\nthat's right you are not in control of\nthe witness the witness is in control of\nyou the witness is uncontrollable and\ncan arguably exert some control but\ngenerally speaking the witness is\nindependent of the axis of\ncontrol\nyeah so some people are saying this is\neye opening some people are saying I\ndidn't understand a single thing totally\nfine either way totally fine right so\nthe challenge that I face is that as we\ntalk about things we can talk about more\nadvanced things or we can talk about\nearlier things and it's not that\nadvanced is better than earlier right\nit's just where people are on their\nJourney\nso if you like you're not stupid if you\ndidn't go to school and learn any\nmathematics until you were 13 it's not a\nreflection on you as a person it's just\nhave you been exposed to the earlier\nsteps of this conversation or\nnot can there be ego without comparison\nyes but there cannot be comparison\nwithout ego or comparison to people you\ncan\ncompare you can compare two objects like\nyou can compare a rock as larger or\nsmaller without ego\nuh so someone's asking about could you\ntell us the differences uh between an\nADHD brain reacting to weed and how\nneurotypical people react to weed I\nthink we've done that before so part of\nthe reason that so so I I know that we\nhave a lot of new people in our\ncommunity which is great right so we're\ngrowing\ncool and part of the challenge we face\nis how much do we repeat things that\nwe've covered before versus cover new\nthings so what I would say is if yall\nare interested in ADHD we have a guide\non it for a reason right so instead of\nwatching like 300 random ass hours of\nstreams where Dr K randomly talks about\nADHD here and there we've got certain\nthings that are start to finish like the\nguide to ADHD and then we also have\nspecifically a video or a stream where\nwe talked\nabout addiction and ADHD I'm pretty sure\nso y'all can just Google\nthat um and I think that's the time that\nwe have for today let me see what else\nwe had one\nmore no I oh meditation bringing up\nanger and\ndisgust it's\n230 okay we can go uh one more chat\nwe'll try to make it a little bit faster\nokay maybe not who\nknows so since we're talking about\nmeditation meditation bringing up anger\nand disgust towards my father I am a\nBuddhist 27f and have been practicing\nshamata I don't know if that's\npronounced right meditation for at least\nan hour a day for the last three months\nbefore this I believed that I didn't\nhave issues with anger only having two\nmemories of situations when I felt anger\nin recent years towards an Abus of EX I\nI recall feeling very angry at my\nparents when I was younger but it\ndisappeared in my late adolescent years\nbut now I feel more and more anger is\nbubbling up manifesting itself in\nintensified irritation at what I\nperceive is arrogance or condescension\nand in particular in Anger whenever I\nhave whenever I have discussions with my\nfather who tends to resort to\ninterruptions aggressiveness ad homonym\nattacks and so on I'm noticing that in\ngeneral I feel a lot of anger towards\nhim just the thought of having a close\nrelationship to him makes me feel\ndisgusted I feel like he sees everyone\nis inferior in himself is infallible\neven though even my mother often\ncriticizes him behind his back he seems\nto have no awareness that his daughters\ndo not feel comfortable debating with\nhim even though we are all passionate\nindividuals my other three sisters no\nlonger Express their views because he\nresponds so aggressively our\nrelationship with him is broken at least\nthat is my perception of the situation\nso I guess that's the context for my\nemotions I'm trying to understand why I\nfeel this way I've never had issues like\nthis before has anyone experienced this\nor some understanding of it should I\nreally be meditating when it is making\nme angrier than before it used to be so\nmuch easier to control my emotional\nexpression but now it feels like there\nis a Revolt within me thank you so much\nfor all your thoughtful answers I\nthought I should clarify that my father\nhas certainly never been abused abusive\neither physically or emotionally\nemotionally distant yes insensitive yes\nbut not abusive or narcissistic what I'm\nshocked by is the intensity of my\nemotional reactions more than anything\nhope that provides some useful\ncontext so I love\nthis so I'm going to comment on it as if\nI know something but I'll be the first\nto say that I could be completely wrong\nbut I think this is a beautiful example\nof many different dimensions of\nknowledge that all get woven together so\nas we talk about this we're going to\ntalk about trauma trauma responses we're\ngoing to talk about meditative Theory\nand we are going to talk about some\nelements of spirituality and Karma and\nthen we're going to end up with\npractical advice not that this person is\nasking for it but because I feel excited\nabout giving\nit about how to deal with someone when\nyou have these kinds of feelings okay so\nwe're going to do kind of like weave it\nall together or try to\nmaybe it'll work\nokay so this is a case of someone who\nfeels a lot of anger in meditation that\ncomes bubbling up because they have this\ndad who apparently was not fun to talk\nto so let's start with why is there\nsuppressed Ang or where is this anger\ncoming from I'm not an angry person this\nis very fascinating\nokay so if you look at traumatic\nsituations\nand I know this person didn't say they\nwere abused but what we sort of know now\nis that a lot of these situations are\ntraumatic in the sense of trauma with\nlitty they shape the way that we live\nthey don't have to be abusive but they\nshape our reactions and and stuff like\nthat so we're going to explore that so\nthis person used to get\nangry with their\ndad because their dad was\ncondescending not not listening number\none right the dad doesn't listen to what\nother people have to say he just insists\nthat they're wrong so when you were a\nchild you have\npoorly\ndeveloped frontal\nloes which means when you feel\nangry you act\nangry right a 2-year-old throws a temper\ntantrum like they can't control\nwhat is happening in the brain is what\nwe see in the outside when we're a\nchild so there's research on this\nthere's a great paper by Judith Herman\nokay we can maybe even pull it up if\nyouall\nwant um should we pull it up let's pull\nit up let's take a quick look I have to\nfind it now oh my god I've got like 600\npapers\n[Music]\num okay I try I try\nI try chat give me a second give me a\nsecond we show this paper because paper\nis cool opening up 18 tabs let's\ngo uh not that one not that\none not that\none\noh can I find\nit\nah it's the last one beautiful okay now\nwe have to find this okay all right\nbeautiful paper this is the paper that\ncoined the term complex ptsc I\nthink um by Judith Herman so let's see\nanger\nyes yes\nokay here it is the humiliated Rage of\nthe imprisoned person also adds to the\ndepressive burden during captivity The\nPrisoner cannot express anger at the\nperpetrator to do so would jeopardize\nsurvival even after release the Survivor\nmay continue to fear retribution from\nany expression of anger against the\ncaptor moreover the Survivor carries a\nburden of unexpressed anger against all\nof those who remained indifferent and\nfailed to help efforts to control this\nrage May further exacerbate the\nsurvivor's social withdrawal and\nparalysis of initiative\noccasional outbursts of rage against\nOthers May further alienate the Survivor\nand prevent the restoration of\nrelationships an internalization of Rage\nmay result in malignant self-hatred and\nchronic\nsuicidality beautiful\nokay so if we look at this situation\nlet's let's adapt what this is saying to\nthis case Okay meditation brings up\nanger only having these particular cases\nof this explosion of anger right towards\nthe dad towards an abuse of ex-boyfriend\nI'm not trying to diagnose this person\nwith cptsd okay so let me explain what\nwe learned so when we were studying when\nJudith Herman came out with that paper\nin Jesus what is it let's\nlook 1992 so 30 years ago 30 32 years\nago this paper was\npublished in those 32 years what we've\ndisced discovered a couple of things the\nfirst is that Judith Herman was looking\nat impotent rage for prisoners of War\nand what she noticed is that when you\nare in a controlling\nenvironment rage cannot be expressed\nbecause anytime you get angry you get\npunished for being\nangry okay then what happened is over\nthe last 30 years everyone was like wow\nthis stuff happens to prisoners of\nWar right and then we notice something\nreally weird that there were people who\nhad complex PTSD who had never been\nprisoners of war and that there were\npeople who grew up in abusive childhoods\nor abusive homes they manifested these\nsymptoms and we were like okay so it's\nnot just prisoners of War it's also Abus\nchildren fair enough still bad trauma\nand then we started to see that oh my\nGod wait they don't have to have Frank\nabuse they don't need to be physically\nabused emotionally abused or sexually\nabused they just need to have\ncontrolling environments over L\ncontrolling environments they need to\nhave adverse childhood experiences like\ndivorces and moving around a lot as kids\nso over time over the last 30 years\nJudith Herman's characterization started\nwith this and we've now encompassed it\nto include up to 60% of the\npopulation this is what we know and\nimpotent rage is a big part of it okay\nso what I'm envisioning and this is\nbased on my clinical experience right so\nI have no idea what happened with this\nperson but what I've seen time and time\nand time again is\ndaughters who have trouble with feeling\nangry and at some point in their 20s or\nearly 30s will start to get really angry\nwith their\ndads and these are dads who are very\ncondescending very angry with the child\nand most importantly punish the child in\nadolescence for getting angry so as the\nchild gets\nangry dad will actually be very\npunishing towards them and so child\nadolescent girl learns don't cross dad\nand we see this family Dynamic it's like\nit's textbook right\nwhere if you kind of look at\nthis dad has no awareness that his\ndaughters do not feel comfortable my\nother three sisters no longer Express\ntheir views this is what signals to me\nthat this is a household thing this is\nnot a this person thing the everyone in\nthe fa all the sisters have figured out\ntalking to Dad is a waste of time and\ngetting angry is a waste of time totally\nfine\nright fine in the sense that that's how\npeople adapt to the\nsituation so impotent rage is harmful so\nwhat do we do with it our frontal loes\ndevelop when we're adolescents and we\npush the rage down we don't express the\nrage anymore we learn that feeling rage\nis harmful is dangerous we are not going\nto be angry people because being an\nangry person doesn't get you anything\nwhen you are in a truly emotionally\nsupportive\nhousehold when you get angry your\nparents won't shut down the anger they\nwill recognize it as a signal something\nis wrong this child is not happy for\nsome reason let's explore it let's try\nto handle it and you can correct the\nangry behavior right you can say you're\nyou can't hit people what are you upset\nabout let's figure out how to address\nthat\nneed so now what's happened is we have\nentered the realm of psychological\ndefense mechanisms like sublimation and\nsuppression so we take all of that anger\nthat we've felt and we push it way down\nand we wall it off in the\nmind and now we enter meditation and\nunderstanding what happens in\nmeditation so in order to survive in\nthis kind of household there is a child\nthat\nhas oh man I'm so glad I did this one\nbecause I'm so\nexcited\nanger but this anger is harmful so it\nbecomes an impotent rage and then what\nwe do is we take a bottle in our mind\nand we take this\nanger and we move it down into the\nbottle and then we block it\noff with our psychological defense\nmechanisms enter the work of\nanroy right who discovered these things\nlike suppression\nor even\naltruism and it doesn't help other\npeople when I get angry so I'm going to\nbe the bigger person and I'm not going\nto feel my anger we do all of these\nmental\nthings so as we do these mental things\nwe do these mental things so that we can\nfunction in the world because having\nthis unbridled unprocessed suppressed\nanger that started at the age of\n13 okay when we were 13 years old we\nstarted getting angry and we started\npushing it down\nlet's say\nadolescence and then this works because\nthis allows their\nfamily to continue having a relationship\nwith your parents right we just got to\npush it push it\ndown relationship is broken but they're\nmanaging because how do they how do they\nfix the broken relationship they just\ndon't talk to their dad easy so of\ncourse it's broken but this is how they\nmaintain Harmony through no\nconversation okay\nI'm trying to understand why I feel this\nway I've never had these issues before\nokay so now let's talk about\nmeditation so in\nmeditation this is our\nmind all right so what we do in\nmeditation is we start erasing layers of\nthe\nmind all right so what does this look\nlike practically so if we look at my\nmind I have\nthoughts I have\ndesires I have\nemotions I have a sense of\nidentity these are all the things that\nexist in the mind so at any given point\nthe reason I made them this way is\nbecause this is usually our perception\nof them we don't always perceive our\nidentity right we don't walk around\nthinking oh like this is who I am we\nwalk around just thinking stuff like I\nneed to get a glass of water I need to\npick up the mail and then as I walk out\nof the house my my eyes see\na cookie and then I'll have a desire so\nI experience that desire and then\noccasionally if I'm a human being living\nin the world I'll experience some\nemotion and then occasionally I'll have\na sense of identity I'm so awesome I'm\nsuch a loser oh my God I'm great I'm\nreally way better than I used to be so\nwe'll have all of these experiences and\nin meditation what do we\ndo we start by stopping the thoughts\nright so Focus your attention on the\nbreath or do adarana DOA do whatever\nwe're doing some kind of meditation then\nthe thoughts\nstop and then what do we do in\nmeditation we stop we restrain our\ndesires so really simple example I'm\nsitting in meditation I'm chanting M and\nI have an itch on my nose in normal life\nthe itch on the nose happens and I\nscratch it the itch goes away the next\ntime the itch comes I gratify it it goes\naway the next time the itch comes the I\ngratify it it goes away and I result in\nmind that when I have a desire I give\ninto the desire which doesn't mean that\nthe desire goes away forever in fact it\nenhances the\ndesire so the more we give into the\ndesire it grows whatever you feed will\ngrow when you give it what it wants it\ngrows so if I get my very fancy coffee\nor very simple coffee every day at 9:00\na.m. if I get used to having it that day\nand I'm gratifying that desire over and\nover again if I throw a temper tantrum\nand everyone caves in and accommodates\nme\nincluding all four of my daughters then\nI have no awareness of it the desire\ngets fulfilled and the desire keeps\ngoing but in meditation we learn to\ncontrol our desires no scratching your\nnose so this layer of the Mind\ndisappears so then what starts to happen\nis as we break down these layers of the\nMind what we're also doing is breaking\ndown our defense mechanisms we break\nthis which means that this stuff comes\nflooding out and why is there so much of\nit because karmically not just\nkarmically just also psychologically I'm\nsort of using this as a karmic way\nbecause we're talking about meditation\nfor 13 years we've been adding\nanger to this until the age of\n27 we've added a ton of anger down there\nand so the pressure builds up and as I\nremove things from the layers of my mind\nas I remove my psychological defense\nmechanisms by just allowing my mind to\nbe completely free then these emotions\nwill come roaring\nout okay so there are a couple things\nwe're going to talk about now so the\nfirst is that when we are meditating\nlike this this is not you're not an\nangry person if you get a lot of me\nemotions that come out during meditation\nthis is not your Baseline this is the\nkarmically stored energy emotional\nenergy that has been implanted within\nthe mind which just needs to be cleared\nout so it's not going to be forever in\nfact over time it'll Decline and then\nit'll completely go\naway so some people will have crying and\nthey'll have this and they'll have that\nthey'll have catharsis and they'll feel\nall this kind of like whatever like all\nyour pent of emotions will come out when\nyou\nmeditate now there's one really\ninteresting example of this so this is\nwhy monks are\ncelibate so that may sound weird so\nwhen we have sex it creates such a\npowerful impression orgasm creates such\na powerful impression that it seeks\nsinks deep into our\nmind and what happens as you get very\nadvanced in meditation you will discover\nthat as you get to higher and higher\nstates of meditation right so we talked\nabout\nthese we talked about these layers of\nmind\nbut\nliterally so as you get rid of this\none and even as you get rid of ego you\nhave to transcend the ego in order to\nrealize\nthis after you transcend the ego what\nyou find down here is\nsex and what you will find is that the\nhighest states of\nmeditation there is a sensory impression\nthat gets a sensory psychological\nwhatever you want to call it there's\nsuch a powerful impression from sexual\nactivity that gets implanted so deep\nthat as you wipe away the top layers of\nmind you find a pile of sex at the\nbottom so this is also why people will\nkind of have like you know if they're\nvery promiscuous like I'm not making a\nmoral judgment on that when I when I\nteach people who are very promiscuous\nmeditation they have a lot of trouble at\nthe advanced stages because what they\nrealize is they've been accumulating all\nthis stuff from all these partners that\nthey weren't aware of and most people\ndon't realize it because you don't get\nto that level of mind you have to\ntranscend everything else to to get\nthere and then you realize how disrup\nsex is for for meditation it just keeps\nyou from getting there right which I\nsuspect is also part of the\nanthropological reason that some of the\nthe misogyny started because these yogis\nwere trying to get Enlightenment but\nthey got laid a couple years ago and\nthen they hate this person for taking\nthis away from them and then there's all\nkinds of problems that that arise but\nthe point is that in meditation whatever\nis buried will come\nout but it's not at its core there's\nalways something underneath until you\nget to unfiltered experience\nand so the last thing to consider is\nmore practical so if you're in this\nsituation first thing I would say is\nthis is why I think meditation teachers\nare really good like it's fine that\nyou're practicing but the guidance of a\nguru is very important to help you\nnavigate through these things because\nyou don't know if I'm meditating I'm\nfeeling worse should I keep meditating\nyes as long as you can handle it keep\nmeditating as long as it's not hurting\nyou but let these emotions come out\nthey're usually transient if they're not\ntransient then you need a psychiatrist\nor Guru or whatever and some kind of\nhelp the last thing is if you're in this\nsituation as you learn these things and\nas you let this emotion out it's I think\nthis is beautiful because this person is\nrecognizing like look what is this life\nthat I have with my\nfamily right like this is the life that\nI have this is my dad this is my\nrelationship and my dad was not\nabusive right he was emotionally distant\nand insensitive and the biggest problem\nis that Dad is\num he seems to have no\nawareness and so the last thing that I\nwould say is that this is a very\nbeautiful kind of Dharma dharmic pull or\nDuty see now if you're in a situation\nlike this you have the opportunity to\nimprove this\nsituation right and this is something as\nsimple I'm not saying it's going to work\nbut this is where like there's some this\nis what I love about like meditation and\nfamily Dynamics as you meditate more and\nmore you begin to uncover these patterns\nbecause you're like where is this anger\ncoming from now you realize this you\ntalk to your sisters you realize oh my\nGod we all walk on eggshells because\nthis guy has no idea how he's he's\nbehaving so now you can open the door to\na\nconversation hey Dad what is your\nperception of people's experiences of\ntalking to you what do you think talking\nto you is\nlike right and then really slowing\nthings down so have you noticed that you\nknow the our Three Sisters aren't really\nlike they don't talk to you about stuff\nanymore you know we have a lot of views\nwhat do you think is the reason that we\ndon't talk to\nyou right and then the dad may get very\ndefensive May attack you and things like\nthat and that's when you point out so I\nasked you a question of what your\nperception is and what do you notice\nabout your\nwords right how do you feel right now do\nyou feel angry do you feel defensive do\nyou feel\nhurt and just really raising awareness\nwith sitting with this\nperson and sometimes it's like\nimpossible I've tried\nit sometimes it's impossible some people\nreally need something like MBT which is\nmentalization based therapy some people\nhave such a primitive empathic\nunderstanding that they cannot\nunderstand any of that they're like\nreally like and MBT is a useful\ntreatment for narcissism useful\ntreatment for BPD can be very\nhelpful but this is where I I think that\nlike you know from a karmic perspective\nI would look at this person I would ask\nthem you know do you want this\nrelationship to be like this or you have\na chance for healing before things get\ntoo late I'm not saying that you have to\nforce it I'm not in your dad has to be a\nwilling participant but there are ways\nto approach the the situation and the\nway to approach any family Dynamic is\nusually by awareness of the dynamic\nwe're not judging anyone we're just\nasking people hey have you noticed this\nwhat's your perception when I share an\nopinion with you what's your experience\nof it so when I said XYZ how did you\nreact to that what did you think I was\ntrying to do by sharing\nthat because I've noticed that when I\nshare an opinion you'll usually correct\nmy opinion or offer your own and give\nreasons why your your opin opinion is\nsuperior to\nmine have you noticed that you do\nthat and then at some point you can get\naround to Hey Dad I'm curious if you\nwant to try just listening and trying to\nunderstand I know that your mind jumps\nto this idea of like this is why we're\nwrong have you ever considered like\nasking more questions or trying to\nunderstand our perspective\nbetter what do you think that would be\nlike do you think you'd be capable of it\nare you interested in it so let's try\nsomething I'm going to say something to\nyou and let's see if you can just try to\nunderstand it better and then I'll ask\nyou what your understanding is and we'll\nsee if it's like consistent with what I\nwas saying or\nnot and then you can even ask people hey\nwhat did you hear me say what is your\nunderstanding of what I was telling you\nand it's it's kind of like very slow\ngoinging but there's a lot here that can\nimprove because when a dad has been\nalienated from all four of his daughters\nthat's a problem in\ncommunication yeah so I I see a lot of\npeople saying I wish this this would\nwork no sometimes they will literally\nnot what if the father is mentally ill\num I can't have this conversation and\nnavigate the backlash I'm with you right\nso even I've so I'm a professionally\ntrained psychiatrist and I have\nencountered people for whom this does\nnot work even though arguably I'm a\nprofessional at doing this and I'm with\nyou this is not always going to\nwork but I would say the better you get\nat it the more effective it will be\nsecond thing that I would say is that\nyou would be surprised at\nhow things that are ineffective actually\nare\nworking so one of the most humbling\nexperiences I've had as a psychiatrist\nis that my judge of I am helping this\nperson a lot or I'm not helping this\nperson a lot how wrong I've\nbeen right so there are times patients\nthat I've worked with where I'm like man\nI'm the best psychiatrist on the planet\nand the patient still has lots of\nproblems and there are times where I\nfeel like I'm not doing anything for\nthis person in six months from now\nsomehow they bounce back and they're\ndoing\nfantastic so see one of the biggest\nmistakes we make in communication is we\nlisten to someone's\nresponse as a measure of whether our\nwords are getting through or not\nobviously right so if I say something\nand someone doesn't responds in a\nnegative way my words aren't getting\nthrough\nincorrect so I'll give you all a simple\nexample okay so I recently ran an\nexperiment in this game called Dota 2\nand I calibrated my rank in this game\nbased on two different accounts one one\nwhere I was talking and one where I was\nnot\ntalking so the MMR difference is about\n800 I don't know how that translates\ninto ranks but it's like pretty\nsignificant right it's like a couple of\nranks maybe like one rank which is it's\nin the the middle of the bell curve so\nit's a lot you're moving from like the\n50th or 40th percentile to like 55th\npercentile or something like that so\nit's a 15%\nincrease and one of the key things that\nI observed when I was doing this is that\noften times when I communicate no one\nwill say anything but it has an impact\nso one really simple I'm getting very\ndetail oriented here I'll ask people\nwhat character they want me to pick in\nthe draft and often times no one says\nanything but even the fact that I ask\nthem hey what do yall want me to pick\nsignals to everybody else that I'm\nwilling to be collaborative I'm willing\nto be cooperative I'm trying to improve\nyour game I'm open to feedback\ntransforms the rest of the game even\nthough they say\nnothing the other great example of this\nis people who Foster animals\nso when you probably people too but\nhumans when you Foster a cat for example\nyou can be sending a signal which the\ncat is ignoring but it's absolutely\nhaving an impact you just don't see it\nright away and if you're a novice at\nfostering you'll think the cat dislikes\nme the cat will never like me the cat\navoids me at all\ncosts but if you Foster cats you know\nwhat I'm talking about that a lot of\nyour signals just because you don't\nperceive them being received does not\nmean that they're not being\nreceived you may not perceive but it's\nabsolutely being received and so\ncommunication is slow a lot of people\nsay it doesn't work it may have some\nsmall impact you just have to give it\ntime so don't give\nup\nokay and the third thing is that\nsometimes this requires the other person\nwanting to change and the biggest\nproblem when people say I wish this\nwould work or sometimes they will\nliterally not is that they don't want to\nchange and then there's nothing you can\ndo and that's the problem right it's not\nabout capability it's not about mental\nillness I literally my day job is\nworking with people with mental illness\nthey are capable of so\nmuch the difference is whether they want\nto\nchange and so the last thing that I\nwould say even if you're in a situation\nwhere this doesn't work is give it a\nshot and don't lose heart because if\nsomeone doesn't want to change they\nwon't change but you will come out of\nthis\nbetter because even though they don't\nwant to change you will have practiced\nthis and one day you will meet someone\nwho will want to change and when they\nwant to change you will have the skill\nset to help them get there and create a\nhealthy relationship and this will mean\nthe world in your life because then what\nwill happen is over time you will start\nseparating people who is willing to play\nball who is willing to communicate who's\nwilling to change\ntheir what they're doing change their\nstrategy and who is not willing\nto and depending on who you end up with\nright so then you you will start to\nrecognize sorry not end up with you will\nstart to recognize the difference\nbetween these two kinds of people and\nthen you will naturally gravitate\ntowards the people who are willing to\nhear you and after you do that for a few\nyears your entire friend Circle will be\ndifferent assuming you socialize and\nstuff like that right assuming\nloneliness is\nnot uh holding you\nback you'll start filtering people out\nof your lives people who are unwilling\nto meet you halfway and you can maintain\na relationship there can still be\nharmony with your dad you visit for\nChristmas and things like that the anger\nwon't be there but you'll sort of\nrecognize that hey like this is you know\nthis is what I can\ndo and then you can even go one level\nlater so after two years of talking to\nyour dad a little bit you can say Hey\nDad it really hurts me that you know\nwe're we've I've tried talking to you a\nlittle bit but it seems that you're\nunwilling to that you don't want to\nimprove your communication style you\ndon't seem to want\nto you don't seem to value our\nexperience of communicating with you\nthat makes me\nsad and like you'd be surprised I know\nthat there's some tough nuts to crack\nout there and like believe me i' I've\nmet uncrackable\nnuts but there are Advanced Techniques\nthat can be used\nright waiting a year or two and then\nsaying like it it hurts me that you\ndon't seem to take this\nseriously right and this means that I\nwon't be able to communicate with you my\nexperience is that I spend less and less\ntime want like I I don't want to spend\ntime with you I I consider it almost a\nwaste of time because when I speak you\ndon't seem to care to\nlisten and that can be hurtful right and\nthen then like the parent can get but\nyou're not angry you're just sharing\nfeedback with them and they can explode\nand then you can turn to them and you\ncan say this is exactly what I'm talking\nabout I was sharing with you that\nsomething is hard for me and your\nresponse is to not hear it at all just\nget angry and you start yelling and you\nstart telling me I'm wrong this is\nexactly what I'm talking about do you\nsee what's happening in this\nconversation and then often times what\nyou'll get is what do you want me to\ndo\nlisten all\nright so look I I get that there are\nuncrackable nuts out there but what I'm\nproud of is that this is a community\nhopefully where that's changing and I\nknow that a lot of people will post\nthings that can feel toxic or whatever\nand like people get upset because their\npost gets banned or whatever or people\nget upset and start yelling about double\nstandards if somebody else's post\ndoesn't get\nbanned so be careful about your\negotistical reactions to\nstuff right and I mean I'll be the first\nto say I have yet to meet a team of\nmoderators who have discovered the\nperfect rule set along with perfect\nenforcement I have yet to see it so the\nmoderators are humans too they're flawed\nthey do their best with a good intention\nin here maybe sometimes they Power Trip\nI have no idea generally speaking I\ndon't think our mods do that there are\nother corners of the internet where mods\nwill power trip that'll be their whole\nshtick mods M take your pick thankfully\nour mods are like\nstellar and they do all this [ __ ]\nthemselves right so when they show up on\non the subreddit they do their best to\ncreate an environment that's good for\neverybody\nokay all right y'all well we are um I\nthink we're done for the day that's\neverything we've got and so we'll see\nyou all next time I think\num yeah so take care everybody thank you\neveryone for coming today I hope yall\nenjoyed it I hope it was helpful and um\nwe'll catch yall Pro I think maybe\nWednesday Friday I don't remember\nexactly but"
