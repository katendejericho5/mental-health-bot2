    "transcript": "the more motivated you are the harder it\nis to make a choice because if we think\nabout what is motivation I'm motivated\nI'm driven so if you sort of think about\nit who's in control when you're highly\nmotivated I've worked with CEOs who are\nso motivated to work really hard they've\ngotten married and divorced three\nseparate times I've literally had to\ntake patients who had Eating Disorders\nwho were so motivated to avoid food that\nthey had to be strapped into a hospital\nbed and hooked up with IVs so they don't\nhave heart arrhythmias and die this is\nthe power of motivation but when we get\nhighly motivated we lose all control so\nthe crazy thing is that as you move away\nfrom motivation what you start to get in\nreturn is choice and now I want youall\nto think back to a time where you just\nhad a good day where you woke up in the\nmorning and you weren't particularly\nmotivated we're talking about truly\ncontent and then you can kind of do\nwhatever you want to that day"
