    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why a\nbedtime routine isn't enough to actually\nget you to\nsleep so this is a really common problem\nthat people experience where if I need\nto go to sleep I get stressed out about\nit right oh my God I need to sleep I\nneed to sleep I have a final tomorrow\nand the more stressed out you get the\nmore you need to go to sleep the harder\nit is to actually sleep or you wake up\nin the middle of the night and you're\nlike oh my God I need to be well rested\ntomorrow why did I wake up I need to get\nback to sleep I need to get back to\nsleep and so the stronger that your\ndesire is to go to sleep the more sleep\neludes you so if this is a problem often\ntimes what we end up doing is try to\nimplement a bedtime routine and I\nremember when I when I first encountered\nthis is I was training to become a\npsychiatrist and I had this brilliant\nlecture on sleep hygiene from someone\nwho is faculty at the Harvard Medical\nSchool and they came in and they said if\nyou have a patient who has difficulty\nsleeping here is what you do you tell\nthem to go to bed at the same time every\nsingle day this helps them train their\ncircadian rhythm and forms the habit and\nwill help them sleep you tell them there\nare no devices to be used for an hour\nbefore bed because the blue light from\nthe device suppresses melatonin\nproduction and will interfere with their\nsleep and you tell them that doing\nthings like half an hour of meditation\nbefore you go to bed has been clinically\nproven to help people sleep and then\nhere I was a seconde Psychiatry resident\nrecently minted MD I go to my patient\nand I say my friend I know you have\ndifficulty sleeping but I have the\nanswers all you need to do is go to bed\nat the same time every day you need to\nstop using devices and you need to\nmeditate for half an hour and of course\nmy patients did what all patients do\nthey went home and they said ah I didn't\nrealize I was supposed to go to bed at\nthe same time I didn't realize I was\nsupposed to meditate for half an hour I\ndidn't realize that I wasn't supposed to\nuse my phone and then they all slept\nvery peacefully for the rest of their\nlives no it doesn't work like that right\nthe whole problem with sleep hygiene and\nthese evidence based recommendations is\nthat that's hard to do it's kind of like\ntelling someone like hey you've got\nyou're overweight and you've got\ndiabetes just go to the gym every day\nwhat I discovered as a clinician is that\nimplementing the right advice about\naround bedtime was very difficult to\nactually do that the people who were\nable to and had enough routine and\nfrontal lobe function and willpower to\ngo to bed at at the same time every\nsingle night those were not the ones who\nwere complaining about sleep that the\nanswers that we had didn't seem to work\nfor the people who actually struggled\nwith the problem and so instead what we\nneed to do if we want to understand\nsleep is we have to understand the\nphysiology the Neuroscience of sleep\nwhat is it that keeps you awake and what\nis it that lets you fall asleep so we're\ngoing to start with something called the\nreticular activating system so this part\nis back here kind of in the back of our\nbrain so this is the part of our brain\nthat governs wakefulness so it does\nthings like tells us when to wake up and\nwhen the reticular activates ating\nsystem is calm then it allows us to go\nto sleep so this is the first thing that\nwe've got to understand about sleep\nsleep is not something that you can do\nit is a circumstance that you can create\nfor your brain so that your brain will\nsay okay fine it's time to go to sleep\nnow I can afford to sleep this is what\nthe reticular activating system responds\nto not just habitual signals it's\nwhether you can afford to sleep or not\nso how do we figure out what works for\nthe reticular activating system and this\nis when I was working as a clinician I\nsort of implemented this advice right so\nI went to people I said just go to bed\nat the same time every day don't use\ndevices you're set and so I was\nstruggling with these patients and I\nstarted to realize that there's this\nother principle from medicine called\npositive deviant which is that if you\nwant to figure out how to do something\nyou don't take the group of people who\ndon't know how to do it and then try to\nsolve that problem what you actually do\nis take the people who never had a\nproblem to begin with and figure out\nwhat they do once you do that then you\nwill develop what you need to do for the\npeople who struggle so I know that\nsounds kind of weird so I'll give you\nall like the actual example of where\npositive deviants came from so a group\nof researchers who were trying to fix\nmalnutrition in Vietnam and so they went\nto this part of rural Vietnam and there\nwas 50% of children had childhood\nmalnutrition oh my God 50% that's\nterrible so how do you fix malnutrition\neasy you give people food so these\nresearchers showed up they had a grant\nto get some amount of food but because\nof some kind of government corruption\nnone of the food ever showed up and so\nthen these researchers are like well how\nare we supposed to fix this problem\nwithout any food because that's how you\nfix malnutrition duh right just eat bro\njust go to bed at the same time every\nday bro like that's how we fix it right\neasy just exercise just feed them and so\nthe government was like oh yeah we're\nreally sorry about that but can you\nplease try and so these doctors were\nlike okay fine we'll give it a shot and\nthen that's when they realize something\nreally important 50% of kids are\nmalnourished\nand then we said but hold on a second do\nwe already say that yeah but what they\nalso realized is if 50% of kids have\nmalnutrition what that means is that 50%\nof kids don't have malnutrition and they\nall live in the same rural area they all\nhave the same socioeconomic status they\nlive down the street fre each other so\nthey started asking themselves the\nquestion how is it that 100% of people\nare not mal Mal children don't have\nmalnutrition in this particular area and\nthat's when they discovered there were a\ncouple of different behaviors that the\nhealthy kids parents did and very simple\nthings like there's a particular weed\nthat grows in the rice patties which is\nviewed as Poor People's food but is\nhighly nutritious that was one of the\nbehaviors and the second behavior is\nfrequently when you're in the rice Patty\nyou'll see different things like shrimps\nand clams and things like that and\nliterally half of the village would\ncarry an apron where they would scoop up\nthat kind of stuff and stick it in the\napron and the other half didn't and when\nthey went home they took these veggies\nand they took the little shrimps and\nclams and whatever and they added them\nto their regular diet and they sort of\nfix malnutrition that way you get a\nlittle protein you get a little\nmicronutrient you get a little bit of\nfiber and that actually fixes the\nproblem so we're going to do that for\nsleep so what we're going to do is take\na look at people who sleep healthily and\nwhat is going on in their reticular\nactivating system and once we understand\nthat we will discover how to be able to\nsleep in a healthy Manner and the\nmajority of it actually has nothing to\ndo with bedtime hey just a quick note a\nlot of people will ask us what do I do\nnext and that's why we built Dr K's\nguide it's a comprehensive resource that\ndistills over 20 years of my experience\nboth as a monk and as a psychiatrist and\nit's designed in a way that's tailored\nto fit your needs so if you're\ninterested in better understanding your\nmind and taking control of your life\ncheck out the link below so let's\nunderstand the reticular activating\nsystem all right so here is the RAS it\nsits back here around our brain stem\nand it governs\nwakefulness so now the key thing to\nunderstand is that sleep is not\nsomething that you do it is something\nthat happens to you in the right set of\ncircumstances sleep comes naturally\nright and sometimes y'all may have\nexperienced this because there are\ncertain circumstances that you trigger\nwhen you don't want to fall asleep oh\nI'm here to watch this movie but I fell\nasleep during the movie how did that\nhappen because you triggered the right\nset of circumstances and even though\nyour mind is saying I want to stay awake\nyour Ras is like nah man we're going to\nactually go to sleep right this second\neven though you paid $18 for this ticket\nso what does the reticular activating\nsystem respond to the\nfirst is that our frontal\nloes have a measure of what we're\nsupposed to do today so we have this\nidea of amount of work and there's this\nphenomenon called\nRevenge\nbedtime procrastination\nso this is what happens in re veg time\nprocrastination so we know we're\nsupposed to do something today right I\nhave some amount of work to do or I'm\nsupposed to have fun our our mind kind\nof has this idea of like what a normal\nproductive day looks like so if we waste\nthe\nday and we try to go to bed what does\nour mind tell us our mind is like no no\nno we can't go to bed yet we have so\nmuch stuff to do and if we have stuff to\ndo this goes and activates the reticular\nactivating system it tells the frontal\nlobes say hey we haven't done enough\nthese are the parts of our brain that\nlike measure like how much we've done\nlike the reticular activating system\ndoesn't know how to do that it also\nexists in like turtles and stuff and\nthey don't have like a daily quota for\nanything or maybe they do who knows but\nthis is where if we sort of look at like\nokay what is the what are we supposed to\ndo to we're supposed to get some work\ndone and if we don't do that work then\nthe reticular activating system is going\nto or the frontal loes will go to the\nreticular activating system and they'll\nsay hey we can't go to sleep yet because\nwe haven't done our work for today now\nthis becomes increasingly problematic\nbecause if we look at the frontal lobe\nand\nsleep what we discover is that when our\nfrontal loes are impaired so when we\nsleep\nless okay what actually ends up\nhappening is it weakens our frontal loes\nso our reticular activating system won't\nlet us fall asleep unless we've done\nwhat we're supposed to today and when I\ngo back to this principle of POS\ndeviants I actually when I was really\ntrying to help uh my patient sleep I\nstopped asking my patients who were\nstruggling what they did to sleep I\nstarted asking my patients who never\nhave any trouble sleeping I took all my\npatients who didn't have any trouble\nsleeping and I asked them hey how do you\nspend your day and here's what I\ndiscovered the first 4 hours of the\nday are\nproductive you don't even need to do\neverything that your mind wants to do\nthis is very important to understand\nbecause a lot of people will say like oh\nmy God I do I have to finish everything\nfor the day no you just have to trick\nyour brain into thinking hey at least I\nhad a productive day and the part of the\nday that makes you think that you had a\nproductive day is actually the first\nfour hours of the day and this is one of\nthe reasons that sleep is so difficult\nis because we don't realize that the\nmajority of being able to sleep is not\nabout how you go to bed it's how you\nspend your waking hours so if you want\nto fix this Revenge bedtime\nprocrastination where you feel like I\nhaven't done enough for day what you\nreally need to control is the first four\nhours of the day come hell or high water\ndrink a big cup of coffee if you need to\nbut for the first four hours of the day\ndo something anything it doesn't matter\nwhat you do you can do laundry you can\ntake out the trash you can do some work\nyou can exercise it doesn't matter just\nspend four hours of productive time\nfirst thing in the day this will calm\ndown your frontal loes and you'll feel\nlike you did enough today even if you\nand once you have that feeling it it\nwill allow the reticular activating\nsystem to calm down which will in turn\nhelp you fall asleep that's number\none number\ntwo you got to manage your\nemotions now what do we mean by managing\nour\nemotions so something has changed\nrecently in our society since the Advent\nof basically smartphones are amount of\nemotional management has dropped has\ncratered so what we know is that\nbasically any technolog iCal device okay\nwhether it's a cell phone social media\nvideo games pornography binge watching\nNetflix HBO Hulu whatever it doesn't\nmatter YouTube twitch doesn't matter all\nof this stuff does one common thing in\nyour brain which is that it's suppresses\nthe activity of your lyic system which\nis your emotional Circuit of the brain\nso basically as we go throughout our day\nif you kind of think about how you spend\nyour day you're basically constantly on\na device for most of us we work on a\ncomputer we study with a laptop we are\non an we have an audio book or we're\nlistening to music in the car there's\nalways some kind of electronic at play\nwe use the bathroom with our cell phones\nwe are we on our phones on the train\nwe're on our phones when we're at dinner\nwe're on phones when we're standing in\nline so phones phones phones phones\nphones so what that means is that we are\nsuppressing negative emotions throughout\nthe day now what do you think is the\neffect of negative emotions on your\nreticular activat system when you're\nfilled with negative emotions are we\nlike oh man I just went through a\nterrible breakup and my boss yelled at\nme wow I really want to go to sleep I\ncan't wait to lay down sure I can't wait\nfor this day to be over I can't wait for\ntomorrow but you're not like oh man I\nreally just I'm so excited about going\nto bed today not how it works so\nnegative\nemotions activate the reticular\nactivating system and by the way\nreticular activating system is what\nwakes you up okay so as long as we're\nlike stressed out or anxious we can't go\nto sleep and now we begin to see this\nproblem of I really need to go to sleep\nright because when you really need to go\nto sleep what are you feeling internally\nyou're feeling anxious you're feeling\nworried and that inter turn activates\nyour stress system activates adrenaline\ncortisol we'll get to another\nneurotransmitter or hormone called\norexin in a second activates all these\ndifferent hormones that then turn on\nyour reticular activating system so now\nthe question is what do we do about this\nand y'all may have noticed this that\nwhen you go to\nbed finally when you're done with a\ndevice all of these negative emotions\nstart flooding up right so when you go\nto bed if you try to go to bed on time\nwhat is the experience of someone who\nactually goes to bed on time they sit\nthere and their mind is hyperactive\nwandering and sometimes even flooded\nwith negative emotions and so how do we\nfix that problem what we do is we wait\nuntil the\nfatigue is so so\nhigh that we just get zonked\nout or what we end up doing is using a\ndevice to keep emotions at Bay and\nthoughts until we pass out with the\ndevice you fall asleep watching\nsomething right and that's because you\nhave to wait until that fatigue becomes\nso overwhelming because if you ever stop\nto turn off a device all these thoughts\nand emotions come flooding back now this\ncreates an even bigger problem because\nif you are using this strategy what this\nmeans is that you are getting to such an\nexcessive level of fatigue that it\nweakens your frontal\nloes and now we get into a real problem\nbecause once our frontal loes are\nexhausted this is where our willpower\ncomes from comes from the frontal loes\nand once our frontal loes are exhausted\nwe have zero willpower\nand once we have zero willpower we can't\nforce ourselves to go to B on time the\nother really interesting thing there are\nthree major drains of willpower an\nemotional suppression controlling your\nemotions is one of the strongest drains\nof your willpower so if you kind of\nthink about it right so if you get\nreally pissed at someone man you want to\nyell you want to yell you want to\ngo and you hold it and you hold it it's\nso hard to hold it in and afterward\nyou're like you can't do anything right\nyou can't like okay now I'm going to go\nto the gym now I'm going to practice\nguitar you're so exhausted after\ncontrolling your emotions and so here we\nare suppressing our emotions all the\ntime they build up they become very\ndifficult to control our frontal loes\nbecome exhausted we end up passing out\nwe wake up the next day tired when we\nwake up the next day tired we can't be\nproductive in the first four\nhours huge problem so what do we do\nabout this so one really simple way to\nmanage your emotions you don't even have\nto fix anything all you need to do is\ngive space\nbefore you go to bed for all that\nthinking that's going to come anyway\nright because when we go to bed all the\nthinking comes so you spend one hour and\nyou're going to say oh my God Dr K I\ndon't have one hour I'm so busy\nlook at your phone look at your daily\nusage of your phone and I would bet\nmoney that 95% of you have at least 2\nhours a day on your phone the average\namount of cell phone use in the\npopulation today is around 3 hours and\n45 minutes and even at the top end like\n50% of people use up to 5 to six hours\nof of Technology usage especially cell\nphones per day so you have the hour you\njust choose to waste it on your phone\nwhich we both know okay so you want one\nhour of\nunstructured mental activity so what\ndoes that mean you can go for a walk you\ncan sit at a blank you can stare at a\nblank wall you can Journal if you want\nto just something where your mind is not\noccupied by something and this is the\nthe cool thing about the mind is it'll\nclean itself out on its own all you have\nto do is give it the space it may be a\nlittle bit unpleasant but you'll notice\nall these thoughts come up this why I\nthink walking is the best there's all\nkinds of other things going on with your\ncardiovascular system with walking so\nsay if you can take a walk for an hour\nat any point of the day ideally maybe\nbefore bed can help some but at any\npoint throughout the day give your mind\nthe space to emotionally decompress\nbecause your emotions are going to\nactivate your articular activating\nsystem third thing that we're going to\ntalk about is my boy\nOren this is a hormone or\nneurotransmitter that governs\nwakefulness and motivation it's actually\nI think one of the most um it's kind of\nlike the Silver Bullet that we're\nmissing in terms of motivation so is\nOrin is um important for the development\nof addiction it's important for going to\nbed on time and it's important for being\nfocused in motivated to do things it's\nactually like really interesting so what\nwe want here is a modul\nof our orexin level and we have very\nlittle science into this but this is the\nbest that I've been able to piece\ntogether so very high\nfat diet or even\nmeal triggers ereen increases in ereen\nand ereen will keep you\nawake high\ncarb decreases\nereen okay so this is where we've got to\nbe super careful about the amount of\ntotal fat if you look at a lot of Health\nFood nowadays they'll have low carb\nbecause everyone's like carbs carbs\ncarbs are bad protein is good we're\ngoing to do protein I'm going to add\nsome quinoa I'm going to add some these\ngrains PE protein protein protein\nprotein and carbs are bad no carb we're\ngoing to put all this artificial Katra\nand if you look at any kind of like\nHealth Food you go look at the health\nfood aisle what you'll find is all of\nthese things are very high in fat often\ntimes saturated but it's healthy it's\ncoconut oil so we're going to put a\npound of coconut oil sprinkle of sugar\nartificial sweetener and we're going to\ntake some weird kind of we're going to\ntake the husk we're going to take the\nfiber we're going to take the unedible\nwe're going to take a a a leaf and a\nbark and we are going to turn it into\nbark flour and we will add it to it\nwe'll make it healthy no that's how it\nworks so you have to be careful about\nthis very practically what this means is\nbaby you know it high carbs for dinner\noh my God\nideally complex carbohydrates so we have\nthat carbohydrate load that's actually\nsprinkling into your system for the next\nfour or six hours but by all means have\na whole wheat pasta have some fruit have\na lot of pasta go for it add some\nprotein add some Fiber we're not saying\nthat you should have a you know just\nstraight unhealthy carbs high fiber High\ncarbohydrate dinner before meal works\nreally well this is what I used to call\nthe burrito trick where if I really\nneeded to go to sleep I would go eat a\nburrito that had rice in it and it would\nslip me into a food coma that's really\nunhealthy so we don't want to do that\nbut you can actually have a healthy\namount of carbs slam a bunch of carbs\nbefore you go to bed and by all means\neat low carb throughout the rest of the\nday it's okay all right talk to your\ndoctor if you have any health concerns\nbut this is what we sort of know about\nereen we don't really know much else\nabout what triggers it so be super\ncareful about high fat diets and instead\nwhat we want to do especially before\nsleep is get that ere rexin level to go\ndown next thing that we want to do is\nengage\nour dial\nRhythm so part of the reason that we\nhave difficulty falling asleep is\nbecause our brain doesn't know what's\ndaytime and what's nighttime because\ngenerally speaking the two are the same\nright so I wake up I sit in this office\nI turn on some artificial lights and my\nbrain doesn't know whether it's daytime\nor nighttime it looks in fact the way\nthat this literally this this setup is\nmade is that it looks the same whether\nit's daytime or nighttime so we can\ncontrol for lighting right that's why I\nhave these lights the way that I have\nthem so I can do\nthis this is what daylight looks like\nokay and then I turn this on and\nthen it's like oh look it's daytime but\nI can do this in the middle of the night\nmakes no difference so what you really\nwant to do is try to spend some time\nOutdoors ideally immediately after you\nwake up but you want to give your brain\na period of light and give your brain a\nperiod of Darkness even if you're\nworking on a screen try to do it in a\nplace where that you have Windows or get\nsome kind of sunshine go outside for a\nfew minutes and this is the key thing\nyou also as best as possible want to\ngive your brain Darkness so what I would\nrecommend is going\noutside in the\nAM and after\ndark this is also very important now we\nhave no science to support this at least\nthat I'm aware of\nbut in my experience our brain is really\nreally good at picking up different\nkinds of things so I suspect if you walk\noutside that even Moon light or\nStarlight or any of that kind of\nDarkness the darkness of outside there's\nno doubt in my mind that somehow your\nbrain can tell it is nighttime if we're\noutside there all kind it's not just\nabout lighting is what I mean you can\nsort of tell the difference there's all\nkinds of weird chemical signals that we\nhaven't figured out but engage your dial\nRhythm and let your brain know hey it's\nlike nighttime now so that may trigger\nparticular things that we haven't\ndiscovered yet okay now the last thing\nthat we're going to talk about is\nunfortunately has to do with devices so\nthis is where things get kind of\ninteresting so the research on bedtime\nprocrastination has gotten to a point\nwhere we've discovered\nsomething which is that there is a new\narea of\nprocrastination basically based on my\nclinical assessment and the reading of\nthe literature we sort of know that how\nlate we stay awake has gotten about 200%\nworse in the last 20 years okay I want\nto say something like 80 to 90% of\nteenagers are actually sleep deprived\nand they sleep like around 11:00 p.m. or\nafter 11: p.m. I want to say 40% or\nsomething sleep at 1:00 a.m. I'm Rusty\non the statistics and so what's changed\nso researchers actually discovered\nsomething very interesting there's all\nthis procrastination that we've already\ntalked about but there is a new level of\nprocrastination there is a different\nkind of procrastination that actually\ngets added to the mix this new level of\nprocrastination is there's\nprocrastination to go to bed and there\nis procrastination to fall asleep so\nthat there now people are spending one\nto two hours in bed trying to go to\nsleep but what they're actually doing is\nthey're on a device cell phones are\nnumber one and so what we sort of found\nis that we've doubled the amount of\ndelay in going to bedtime and basically\nall of it has to do with cell phones so\nnow we get into a problem because how do\nwe protect this right how what do we do\nabout that because these so this is\nwhere sleep hygiene is kind of correct\nwe do not want to take our phones to bed\nand it's not enough for me to tell you\nthat but let me explain to you why\nso here's what we know about bad\nbehavior so this actually comes from\nresearch on suicide so if you look at\nthe there's a guy named Matt KN who's\ndone a ton of research on suicide has\nawesome awesome papers on it so what we\nsort of know about suicide is that the\nmajority of people I want to say 80 to\n90% of people do not premeditate their\nsuicide what they do is they make an\nimpulsive decision and within five\nminutes of making the decision they make\nthe suicide attempt 80 to 90% of people\nabout 40% of people decide within 60\nseconds they say hey you know what I'm\ngoing to kill myself and then they\nactually go ahead and do it like within\n60 seconds this is not what the media\ntells us the media media is like oh my\nGod people plan and plan and plan no no\nso here's what we know so when someone\nis suicidal there's one major thing that\nwe try to do as mental health\nprofessionals we remove access to\nSuicide so we're going to take away your\ngun we're going to take away your noose\nwe're going to take away the way in\nwhich you can kill yourself but you can\nsay but Dr K can't some someone just go\nout and buy a gun if they really want to\nabsolutely they can why do we do it this\nway it's because if they have the\nimpulse for suicide and they have access\nto suicidal means that is what is the\nhighest risk what we know is if we take\naway the access the impulse will\ndecrease over time so people may feel\nsuicidal and I don't know if it's kind\nof make sense but a lot of people feel\nsuicidal a lot but they they're not\nkilling themselves all the time so the\nwhole idea behind this impulse of\nsuicide is if you can write out the\nimpulse without taking an action you'll\nbe okay hopefully and if you're\nstruggling with that you should\nabsolutely see a mental health\nprofessional but what we learned from\nsuicide and human behavior in general\nand why do we look at suicide is because\nit's an important Behavior so we've\nreally studied it a lot so same thing is\ntrue of cell phones if you have an\nimpulse and you have access then you're\nscrewed and phone designers every\ntechnology designer has figured this out\nthis is why if you look at it what is\nthe trend with Device usage there are\nfewer and fewer barriers so now you have\nface unlock you have fingerprint unlock\nyou've got Auto logins you've got\nautoloading Auto patching why do people\nAuto patch video games because they know\nthat if you load up and you have to wait\n5 minutes to play then you're going to\ngo do something else the desire to play\na video game will disappear so you\nliterally have a whole industry and I'm\nnot trying to demonize any particular\nperson everyone has figured this out Tik\nTok YouTube every game designer every\nsocial media platform you now even have\nthings like if you log into Netflix they\nstart Auto playing something to engage\nyour attention because if before they\nautop played what did you do when you\nloaded up your your on demand thing you\nscrolled for 15 minutes looking for\nsomething to watch and then kind of\ndecided I have nothing to watch and then\nyou turn it off and then every single\none of these like online streaming\nplatforms is like oh no the only thing\nworse than them for you turning it off\nis you switch to a different platform\nand that other platform has has\nsomething autop playing and then you\nclick on that and now Netflix has lost\nand HBO has won so there's an industry\nthat is trying to get you to capitalize\non your impulses they're trying to\nimprove access so the moment you have an\nImpulse you have access to the thing and\nthen you lose an hour right because\nthat's what happens when you're\nscrolling on some kind of shorts\nplatform reals Tik Tok\nwhatever a 5-second impulse let me look\nlet me see what's you don't even know\nthat you want to do it a 5-second\nimpulse results in an hour of lost time\nand that's what they're trying to do\nscience of human behavior folks and this\nis where the Sleep hygiene becomes\nreally important right we're going to\ncome full circle here you have to\nunderstand that when you go to bed you\nhave this industry that for every minute\nliterally every minute that you spend on\nyour phone multiple people are getting\npaid one person's selling your data one\nperson is making ad Revenue then you\nswitch to something else someone else is\nmaking the ad Revenue everyone's selling\nyour data so everybody wants you to use\nit and they're going to make you try to\nuse it and they recognize that if we can\nmake this as easy as possible if we can\nimprove access as much as possible then\nthey will they'll give into their\nimpulses and we win they make money so\nwhat can you to solve this this is where\nI could say okay go ahead and train your\nbrain through meditation go spend years\nin the Himalayas become an absolute Chad\nMonk and then you will have impulse\ncontrol or what you can do is remove the\naccess you can do what we do as mental\nhealth professionals we're trying to\nkeep people alive remove the access so\nliterally one to two hours of going to\nbed later than usual is because people\nuse cell phones so do not take your\nphone into the bedroom or do not take it\nanywhere near your bed I will sometimes\nleave it on a dresser on the opposite\nside and this is for those of you'all\nwho are like but what if somebody needs\nme in the middle of the night I want you\nto just think for a second in the last\n365 days how many in the middle of the\nnight phone calls have you gotten I'm a\n doctor I've gotten only a\nhandful right and it's people's J job to\ncall me in the middle of the night if\nthey're having trouble so you may miss\nsomething so that's fine if you want\ndon't want to miss something you can\nleave it at the opposite end leave no\ndevices near your bed and this is where\nthere the other standard sleep hygiene\nstuff is also good so using a device 1\nhour two hours before bed not a great\nidea so at the end of the day if you\nwant to go to bed on time it's not even\nabout bedtime it's about daytime you\nhave to understand okay what is the part\nof my brain that allow ows me to sleep\nor keeps me from sleeping because you\nwant to sleep but something in your\nbrain is not letting you sleep this is\nthe reticular activating system and\nthere are a couple of important inputs\nthat we need to understand number one\nany kind of work that we need to do if\nyour brain is not satisfied with what\nyou've done today it will keep you\nawake so the first four hours of the day\nyou need to be as productive as\npossible next thing any amount of pent\nup emotions or stress will activate your\nmind and has been artificially\nsuppressed so you want to spend 1 hour\njust with unstructured mental\nactivity next thing is there are certain\ndietary things that we can do be careful\nabout super high-fat diets and have a\ndecent amount of healthy carbohydrate\nbefore you go to bed it's fine I'm not\ntalking about dessert I'm talking about\ndinner okay complex carbohydrates will\nalso leak glucose into your system and\nglucose will actually suppress ereen and\nhelp you fall asleep so you want to have\nmaybe a really solid meal two hours\nbefore bed and then no devices folks\nhate to say it but that's how it is\nright the last thing that I'll leave you\nwith is the one willpower thing and\nhopefully what'll happen is as you do\nall these other things all of this stuff\nwill start to get easier and this is how\npeople who don't have trouble sleeping\n[Music]\nsleep"
