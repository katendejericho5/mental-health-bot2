    "transcript": "I'm going to give you all the little\nhack that I use to pretend to be smart\nwhich is that I write about everything\nbefore I open my mouth so before I did\nmy first stream on Twitch I was writing\na book or I wrote a book about the\nneuroscience and psychology of\nTechnology it is this 160 page Mammoth\ntone that is absolute garbage but what\nthat process of writing when I wrote 160\npages and like 88,000 words it clarified\nall of my ideas so that when I opened my\nmouth it made me sound like I was a\nsmart person so when it comes to clearly\ncommunicating the most important thing\nthat you can do is write out your\nthoughts you don't have to repeat them\nor memorize them or anything like that\nbut if you look at the Neuroscience of\nwriting and speaking when we go through\nthe process of verbalization and sort of\nwriting this stuff out this is when we\nactually clarify our thinking and now\nthe cool thing is when you open your\ndumb mouth all of the thinking has\nalready been done so that when you start\nspeaking it comes out super clear"
