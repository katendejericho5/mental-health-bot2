    "transcript": "today when you fail the reason you're\ndemoralized and you give up is not\nbecause you failed today it's because\nyou add the energy of all of your\nprevious failures onto this failure this\nis why it's overwhelming to deal with\nit's not just this failure you're not\nlooking at it in isolation they do it\nonce and then they fail again and they\nfail a third time and then what happens\nnow I've failed three times in a row you\nstack them all together without\nprocessing each one and then the fourth\nfailure you're not dealing with one\nfailure you're trying to manage four\nfailures this is how you get these kind\nof patterns of people who are like I've\ntried everything and nothing works\nfailure after failure after failure\nStacks up changes the way that your mind\nthinks and then you start engaging\nsomething called the no sibo effect\nwhich is the opposite of plus sibo so\nplus sibo is can you explain that term\nso plus sibo is if we think something is\ngoing to work it works and no sibo is if\nwe think something isn't going to work\nit doesn't work very simple"
