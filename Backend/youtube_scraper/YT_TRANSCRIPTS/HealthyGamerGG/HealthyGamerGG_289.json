welcome to another healthy gamer G\nstream my name is Dr Alo kenoa just a a\nreminder that although I am a doctor\nnothing we discuss on stream today is\nintended to be taken as medical advice\neverything is for educational or\nentertainment purposes only if yall have\na concern or question please go see a\nlicensed\nprofessional\nokay\nso I am super excited to be streaming\ntoday I haven't been this hyped about\nstreaming I don't know since since when\nI don't know so today we are going to be\ntalking about purpose motivation and uh\nsomething else I don't I don't remember\nwhat meaning purpose and motivation okay\nso here's what makes me excited so today\nwe are not going to pull punches right\nso today so sometimes when I\nstream I have to be like\ncompassionate and I have to be like oh\nmy God your life is so hard oh my God\nbut today we're going to like we're\ngoing to tell it how it is like so this\nmay be a slightly more based stream than\nusual um and so so the other thing is\nlike in this community people are\ngetting like more knowledgeable and\nwe're learning some of the basics so\nlike we're going to actually explain\nlike what I think the right answers are\nand the challenge with explaining the\nright answers is that sometimes the\nright answers make people feel bad right\nlike it it's kind\nof you know like so sometimes there's\nlike a there's like a right way to do\nthings and a wrong way to do things and\nbut sometimes the right way to do things\nis it it can be bruising for the\nego and so I'm not I'm not saying I'm\ngoing to be an [ __ ] today but we're\ngoing to like if you guys want like if\nyall have real questions and you want\nreal answers that's what we're going to\ndo today so there are a couple things\nthat we're going to talk about in\nrelation to that the first is that today\nI'm going to include a few Easter eggs\nokay so over the course of today's\nstream I was thinking about some like\nwhat we're going to talk about and what\nI'm actually going to do is include\nsomewhere between probably two and four\nEaster eggs which if you are paying\nattention to you will pick up these are\nEaster eggs that are going to be about\nthe way that your mind functions so I'm\ngoing to teach yall four lessons about\nwhat the mind the way that the Mind\nfunctions and four ways that if you are\nnot careful your mind will lead to\nincorrect\nconclusions but I won't say this is\nlesson number one this is lesson number\ntwo this is lesson number three this is\na little bit more so we're going to\nanswer like a question and there'll be a\nlittle nugget of knowledge in there for\npeople who are paying attention and if\nyou really want to like put get your\n[ __ ] together you have to have a mind\nthat functions well okay so if yall pay\nattention you'll pick these up if you\nmiss it it's not a big deal\nokay\nso Okay we okay with that so we're going\nto be looking at a couple of posts from\nacross L Reddit um but before we dive\ninto that a couple things first of all\nare there palor enjoyers so in in in the\nvein of Easter eggs maybe it's because I\nI downloaded pal World across the\nweekend um or over the weekend but like\nare there are there pal World enjoyers\nin chat today\num yeah yes\nno yes okay um so if there are you know\nit I can't tell if the game is good or\nis like is going to turn\ninto so there there's a part of me\nthat's afraid that it's going to turn\ninto some microtransaction [ __ ] hell\nokay but let me let me tell youall you\nknow why I love pal\nworld so I think for a long time the\nPokemon franchise has had a monopoly on\nthis kind of gameplay and I think this\nthis may be kind of a unfortunate take\nbut I I think what I've disliked about\nPokemon is since they've had a monopoly\non this kind of gameplay and Pokemon has\nbecome synonymous with this sort of\ncatching sort of thing their games have\ndecreased in quality like they've gotten\nlike worse and worse and worse and\nthat's because they've got no competitor\nin the space so I'm thrilled that pal\nworld is doing well and my hope is that\nthe Pokemon franch\nwill get their [ __ ] together and\nactually start making good games because\nI'm sure that they're they're panicking\nover there that there's this game that\nis come out which has basically taken\nthe idea of Pokemon but like actually\nmade a good game out of\nit um you know and it's not that like I\nlike Pokemon like I got my kids a\nPokemon game I got them Pokemon arus\nbecause I wanted to play Pokemon I\nthought this was great but the game is\nlike it's so trash on so many levels\nlike it's a really fun game in some ways\nbut there's just like the attention to\ndetail with like interface problems and\nlike you can't skip dialogue and like\nall this kind of stuff like the graphics\nare junk and it you know in pal world\nit's like it's pretty cool like I I\nbuilt this harness and then I got\nattacked by the who are these guys I\nlove it the the the pal resistance\nFreedom Movement or some [ __ ] so I got\nand it was all buggy as hell and it's\nit's kind of like a even power world is\nkind of like a there's like some stuff\nabout it that's trash right it's early\naccess so I guess that's okay but it\nit's kind of fun to run around and catch\nthings and and you know we'll we'll see\nhow it goes like but there's a part of\nme that really hopes that they don't\nturn it into this microtransaction hell\nwhere it's like okay to get the highest\nlevel sphere and do this or some grindy\n[ __ ] show which I I'm not a fan of um\nbut anyway it's kind of you know it's\nkind of\nwhatever um Okay so in relation to other\nthings uh so it so I wrote a book I\ndon't know if you guys know this so I\nwrote a book and the book is actually\nfor your mom so uh I wrote a book called\nhow to raise a healthy gamer which may\nconfuse a lot of people because like\nmaybe y' all don't have kids maybe I'll\ndo so the first thing is that people are\nvery surprised to discover that I was\nsurprised to discover that the average\nage of our audience is 32 and we have\npeople in their 60s and 70s that watch\nour content which is like wild right so\npeople like my my mom um\nand so the reason that I wrote a book\nabout how to raise kids is because when\nI was sort of thinking about why does\nthis community exists in the first place\nlike if I could go back in time and what\nwould I do if I could go back in time\nlike 40 years what I would actually do\nis write a book about parenting because\nI think the problem with with my\nupbringing is not that my parents were\nbad they were great they're wonderful\nparents but they were just outgunned\nthey're outgunned by like technology\nbecause they don't know how to deal with\nit so so I know it's kind of weird that\nit's kind of like not our quote unquote\ntarget audience which people were\ntelling me and they're like oh you know\nwrite a book for your community don't\nworry all those are coming the next two\nbooks are going to be for y'all and I've\nalready I started working on those about\na year ago but the reason I wrote this\none first is because when I think about\nthis community the most important thing\nis if I could go back in time and help\nyour parents that is actually the way\nthat I would help you the most\nand so what I'm thinking about is not\njust y'all but the kids who are 6 9 12\n15 18 right now we're getting into our\ncommunity and what their parents need to\nunderstand to protect their kids from\nthe\ninvasive stuff in technology okay so if\ny'all have kids definitely check out the\nbook um it's actually for the next 48\nhours there's a 25% discount for members\nat Barnes & Noble so it's how to raise a\nhealthy gamer so you know if yall are\ninterested in supporting the work that\nwe do it's a very very good book um\nthere are a couple of other things so\nyou can also get the book for your\nparents right so if you find if you're\nlike a gamer or you're someone who like\nuses technology and your parents are\nlike man like stop using the technology\nlike oh my\nGod like the social media is ruining you\nand you're like yeah but see here's the\nproblem is that if you have a problem\nwith technology and your parents are\nwriting your ass on it\nyou can't ever and you know you have a\nproblem you can't ever admit that it's\ncausing you a problem because if you\never admit yeah this is like causing\nproblems in my life you give them ammo\nthey're like see I told you I was right\nall along I look I told you games are\nnot good they're ruining your mind\nyou're going to ruin it ruin it ruining\nit and then you can't ever so then\nyou're [ __ ] stuck holding this\ndefensible position of yeah no it's not\nthat big of a problem that's what\nhappened with me I knew I was [ __ ] up\nmy life but if I ever told my parents if\nI ever admitted it to them that that\ngives them license to take it away it\nempowers their position and it weakens\nmine so if y'all are in this situation\nget your parents this book because what\nwe try to do is teach parents like\ncommunication skills so the other thing\nthat I think this book would be useful\nfor is so there's a big part about\ncommunication skills in this book that's\nreally what a central part is about so\nif y'all are interested in develop in\ncommunication skills in terms of your\nrelationships if you have a loved one\nwho's got a problem with like video game\naddiction or you have a loved one who's\nlike got problems with mental health or\nwhatever if you have people in your life\nthat you have difficulty communicating\nwith the book will help for that right\nso it assumes a context of parent child\nrelationship but the stuff in the book\nlike applies to just about any\nrelationship so these are a lot of the\ntechniques that I use when I'm I'm kind\nof raising my own kids they're also\ntechniques that we've used uh in we've\ngot like studies that are running right\nnow about like the efficacy of these\ntechniques and stuff that looks pretty\ngood but it's also stuff that like I'll\nuse in my marriage it's just about the\nfundamentals of and this is kind of what\nthe book is about is like this is how\nyou form an alliance with someone so\nthat the two of y'all are on the same\npage instead of being\nantagonistic and then this is how you\ncommunicate with them to like sort of\nunderstand them help them out and things\nlike that and then there's a section on\nBoundary setting which is is really\ndesigned for more of the parent child\nrelationship but can be applied can be\nadapted\nsome so and and maybe if I mean if\nenough people get it and then y'all\nreally want us to maybe what we can do\nis consider like adapting a portion to\ndifferent kinds of\nrelationships um so if yall are\ninterested at all highly recommend it\nyou know I think it's like the reason we\nwrote it is because we think it's pretty\ngood um and it certainly helps us out so\ny'all can there's a 25% uh\ndiscount off of all pre-orders at Barnes\n& Noble for a period of 48 Hours okay\nnext thing that I wanted to talk to you\nabout before we dive in is on Friday we\nstreamed with Dr thorderson I'm just\ncurious what y'all thought about\nthat the title of the book is how to\nraise a healthy\ngamer\num what do y'all think\nuh\num\num okay did y'all catch the stream with\nDr\nthorderson it's it's getting released in\nMarch there's a pre-order there's a\npre-order sale right\nnow okay so someone was saying it's\nawesome it was amazing uh there will be\nan audio version of the book I will be\nrecording it myself next week\num more spirituality PLS okay we're\ngoing to get into that\ntoday I liked the stream a lot okay so\nsome some people are saying it was okay\nso so let me ask youall what do you\nthink would make it\nbetter okay so I need more depth thank\nyou very\nmuch caught it but couldn't finish it\nokay I think she should have been\ninvolved in the Reddit analysis great\nthank you very\nmuch\num do the in recording with the accent I\ndon't know if my publisher is penguin\nrandom house I don't know if my\npublisher would be okay with that would\nlike\nokay let her talk longer okay cool all\nright so so here's the here's okay so\nthat's cool so we're going to pass that\nfeedback along so by the way so we got\nsome feedback already and the feedback\nis overwhelmingly positive\num but we think that there are things\nthat we could do better so I think a lot\nof people liked it and um I think she's\nfantastic and so uh it's actually really\ninteresting how I and we'll talk about\nhow we found her later gruy actually\nfound her at the American Psychiatric\nassociation National Conference and\neveryone there was like sipping some\nKool-Aid and she was like y'all are\ndoing it wrong like this is crazy like\nthis does mental health does not need to\nbe this particular way so she's quite\nrevolutionary in a lot of her ideas and\nshe's quite based and so gruy was like\nthis is a based take and so she really\nliked it and so she like introduced\nherself afterwards and and she's awesome\nso okay so we're we're trying to we'll\nsee if she's willing to come on again um\nand then we also want to think a little\nbit about how we can help y'all more\nokay okay audio issues yeah we're\nworking on that don't worry about it\nchat all right so let's get to stuff\nwhat do y'all\nsay\nokay let's see if my things are right\nall right so this is what I'm going to\ndo do\nfirst what we're actually going to do is\nwe're going to just take a quick look at\nthe posts okay and then once we look at\nall of the posts the titles then we'll\nkind of go through them in detail okay\nso oh my\nGod see if does this work yes thank God\nall\nright change my mind Dharma or Duty\nikigai Jihad whatever you want to call\nit as the solution for duka suffering is\njust huffing copium in Disguise so we're\ngoing to talk about this is this whole\nconcept of finding meaning or purpose or\nwhatever just like some gigantic source\nof\ncopium okay number two I can't find\nmeaning meaning in life I feel that I'm\nslowly becoming a nihilist I have no\nfriends no family nothing to live for\nthe for the sake of it don't get me\nwrong I'm not sad or depressed I'm not\ntrying to lay out a sob story but I fail\nto understand the point of this money\nfame or even virtue why does it\nmatter like I'm not even 20 and I feel\nlike I'm I've live to 60 okay bored of\nlife does anyone else struggle to find\nmeaning in life right so now we're even\ntalking about okay I have great friends\nI have a solid job I like my co-workers\nI have a good social life but I struggle\nto find any meaning in\nlife and then here's one so why should I\nlive if I don't want to\nright interesting question I already\nknow everything I should do but nothing\ncompels me to want to do them how do I\nmove myself forward in life if nothing\nfeels exciting or rewarding enough to do\nit all right\nso these are the\ntopics and Y y'all will notice that\nthese are sort of related right so we're\nswimming around this concept of like\nwhat the\n[ __ ] are we doing in life like what's\nthe point where does the motivation come\nfrom where does the purpose come from\nlike where like how what about what I\nwant to do what I should do what is\ndopamine have to do it is there some\nbigger picture is this all just some\nkind of like scam right religion is the\nopiate of the masses it's all just\ncopium I'm depressed I'm not depressed I\ndon't know what I'm doing I'm doing\neverything right but my life feels empty\nwe're going to deal with all of it and\nwe're going to tackle all of these\ndifferent things okay so let's start\nwith\nso the other thing by the way is if\ny'all are\nnew so here's a here's a criticism that\nI've been getting recently so which is\nthat like stop talking about the same\ncrap over and over and over again Dr K\nso that's fine so I'm going to assume\nwe're going to do a very quick kind of\nrecap of core things that we've\ndiscussed in the past but one of the\nthings that we're going to do today is\nlike I'm not going to explain the basics\nI'm going to assume that y'all know the\nbasics okay so if y'all don't understand\nwhat I'm talking about\nI apologize go watch something else we\nhave resource packs and stuff that y'all\ncan access that will teach yall some of\nthe basics okay\nso let's start are y'all\nready\nokay okay change my mind Dharma Duty\nikigai Jihad whatever you want to call\nit as the solution for duar suffering is\njust huffing copium in disguise I\nanticipate encountering the rebottle\nof no true Scotsman that I simply\nhaven't discovered my true unique Dharma\nyet and that I will happily tolerate any\nsuffering for I don't believe there's\ncopium strong enough to Huff that's\nworth the unavoidable pain of life\nthere's arguably an easier rebuttal of\nthis is a problem only you have but\nlet's walk around that for\nnow so the first thing is that I think\nwhat this person is talking about so\nlet's just dispense with this right away\nso that you know if someone says okay\nDharma Dharma which is the Sanskrit word\nfor Duty and we'll get to why it's not\nreally\nDuty they'll say like okay like if you\ndon't believe that your Dharma can\nalleviate suffering that's because you\nhaven't found your real Dharma yet and\nit's just until you find your real\nDharma then that's your problem right\nyou're not trying hard enough so this is\nan argument that I think is like a\npretty good argument uh that we have to\nbe careful of\nso I think that like let's just talk\nabout this for a second so like I have a\nproblem with this argument too so I I\nthink I agree with this person's\nargument that's what I mean so there's\nlike you know when I was like starting\nmy spiritual journey I would talk to\npeople about things like prayer right so\nlike prayer never worked for me and I\nhad people tell me like yeah that's just\nbecause you're not praying hard enough\nright like the problem is that you're\nnot doing it right it's not that we're\nwrong and praying and believing in God\nwill absolutely God bhagan God will fix\nall of your problems you just put it to\nGod and I'm like I put my problems with\nGod and nothing [ __ ] changes they\nlike that's because you're not praying\nhard enough you're you have to have more\nbelief more faith no it's not that this\norganism that we have no scientific\nproof for you can talk to it let not\ntalk to you let's all this kind of stuff\nlike okay you can argue that there is\nproof whatever I'm not trying to say\nreligion it is not that this being in\nthe sky this Flying Spaghetti Monster is\nthat is not wrong you are wrong you are\nnot playing praying good enough right\nand when we talk talk about Dharma the\nsame thing happens a lot of people will\nsay like oh yeah like the reason that\nyou think that Dharma doesn't work is\nbecause you didn't find it yet okay so\nI'm with you there but that's not what\nwe're going to do okay don't worry about\nit so let's get back to it if I had both\nDara duka on a set of scales the duka\nmight as well be something very dense\nlike a black hole I personally don't\ncare to work and suffer for more for\nDharma and not even to save not even to\nsave to attempt to save Humanity from\nthe unavoidable duka of existence there\nare countless worthy altruistic causes\navailable I not burnt out already with\nbasic existence and I'm not interested\nin additional labor so like just F this\nwhole thing right like it's just not\nworth it there's nothing so valuable\nthat I would want to go through what I\nhave lived and suffered so far and\nthat's before we even account for future\nsuffering so there's nothing that I can\nperceive\nthat makes the [ __ ] life that I've lived\nworth it and it doesn't even have to be\n[ __ ] right doesn't have to be very very\nbad it can just be an average life but\nit's still not worth it I can agree with\nEastern Buddhist schools of thought when\nit comes to suffering and perhaps\nattachment however they couldn't commit\nto the rational conclusions okay so now\nwe have to be a little bit\ncareful because if we think someone else\nis not willing to commit to rational\nconclusions we got to be super careful\nabout that right so the mind is really\ntricky it says oh yeah this is the\nrational conclusion but others are not\nwilling to commit to it it's not that\nthey're the the problem is that they're\nnot willing to commit it's not that they\nare right and I am wrong they just can't\nface the truth the way that I can right\nif I explain I expect I would be banned\noo but Savvy readers who know no oh very\nokay so if you're in the no you're in\nthe no and they're the people who are\nthe Enlighten ones who know and then we\nget we get oh my God we get cancelled if\nwe speak it out loud because is secret\ntruth be oh okay however cycles of\nreincarnation conveniently exist oh my\nGod they're so convenient I don't\nbelieve in it I'm not enlightened enough\nto have encountered the alleged evidence\nof it and one life is already an\nexperience I could have done without and\nthat the only exit to transcend through\nNirvana and supporting monasteries I\ndon't know where this comes from but\nokay sure we'll talk talk about Nirvana\nand stuff later okay if the school of\nthought of thought religion didn't\nperpetuate itself then they wouldn't\ncontinue to exist this true I I don't\nknow if I I I don't know if I agree with\nthat but we'll so let's just dispense\nwith this for a second okay I'm not\nsaying I'm right or wrong there's just a\ndifferent perspective so if you look at\nsome of\nthe perspectives from the karmic\nreligions okay it's not so see if\nsomething is true you don't need a\nself-perpetuating\nthing to keep it going so something that\nis true will be discovered and\nrediscovered even if all of the\nmonasteries fall apart someone else if\nsomething is true right so if we had\nthis apocalyptic if we had this\napocalypse that happened and we got sent\nback to the Stone Age as the human race\nwe would still discover gravity we would\nstill discover electricity we would\nstill discover all the same stuff if\nit's true we don't need a lineage to\nperpetuate what is true okay I've talked\nwith psychotherapists and heard varying\nranging responses ranging from agreement\nto disagreement on Dharma as the\nsolution to dukka but what are others\nthoughts on the matter sorry for the\nwalls of text I'll check back later on\nthis post if I remember okay thanks for\nthe insights I'll ruminate over whether\nor not letting go of all attachments is\na pic Victory and investigate the\ndifferences between dis disassociation\nand being free of all attachments so\nfirst of all I love this post okay and\nthe stuff that I argued against in the\nmiddle that's not actually what want to\ntalk about I'm just sort of pointing out\nI'm not going to address those things\nbut it just because I'm not addressing\nit doesn't mean that I agree with it\nthere's a different perspective okay so\nif we want to understand this what we\nreally have to do is start by\nunderstanding these\nterms so there is a huge problem when it\ncomes to\nspirituality which is\nthat a lot of people think they\nunderstand spirituality but they don't\nreally understand spirituality now this\ncan't be the the no true Scotsman\nargument right so this is Dr K saying oh\nyou don't really understand spirituality\nthat's why you misunderstand things if\nyou really understood the real\nspirituality then you would understand\nwhat we're talking about so I'm not\nsaying that I'm right but let let me\nexplain this\nokay so right now let's try to\nunderstand the\ndissemination of these Concepts like\nDharma and dka how are these Concepts\ntaught how do people learn about them so\nwe learn about them usually through\nthings like people random d masses like\nmyself or on the Internet speaking about\nthese Concepts or you read some\nbest-selling book right where someone\ntalks about this or you watch lectures\nor you listen to podcasts or whatever so\nthe way that we learn about things like\ndka are through easily disseminable\nmaterials and the goal of all of these\nmaterials is to be easy to disseminate\nso when we make a YouTube video or we\nstream on Twitch or whatever right one\nof our goals is that we want people to\nbe able to understand it so we transmute\nwe transmute the knowledge into being\neasily\naccessible okay now this is a huge\nproblem because originally these\nConcepts were not taught intellectually\nthese Concepts were taught in tandem\nwith\npractices so this is like night and day\nso I'm going to give you all an example\nif I want to teach yall about swimming I\ncan write a book about swimming I can\nmake a YouTube video about swimming I\ncan make a twitch stream about swimming\nI can do all kinds of stuff about\nswimming but if we look at how do we\nactually learn how to swim we have to\nget into the water at some point so the\nbiggest reason why there is a\nmisunderstanding of these Concepts is\nbecause these Concepts were originally\ntaught in conjunction with practices and\nwe would take kids that were about eight\nor n years old we would send them to an\nasham or a monastery where they would\nhave daily meditative practices in which\nthis philosophical angle was combined\nthere is an experiential component a\npractice component along with the\nintellectual or philosophical component\nand when you combine these two things\nthen you understand it but that's not\nwhat we have today right so what we have\ntoday is people writing books where the\nintellectual mind reads it and then we\ntry to make it accessible to the\nintellectual mind right so we don't\ninclude any experiential knowledge\nbecause if you include any experiential\nknowledge the intellectual mind won't\nunderstand it so we are a society that\nis learning spirituality the way that\nsome people learn about sex through\nwatching pornography I'm going to watch\nthis porn over and over and over again\nand then eventually I the more I learn\nthe more I educate myself the better I\nwill get at sex this is what's happening\nin with spirituality in our current\nexistence because everyone wants to sell\nbooks and if I say things that people\ndon't understand then no one will buy\nthe book so instead what I do is I take\nall the stuff that's true that's based\non experience and I remove it from my\nexplanation so today what we're going to\ndo is add what is missing from this\nunderstanding okay does that make sense\ndo you all have questions about\nthat you all get this so like the\nexperience comes with the knowledge and\nnow all we're doing is we're sending 50%\nof it along and we're leaving out the\nrest of it\nokay so now let's understand some of\nthese\nConcepts okay so first thing is let's\nunderstand the relationship between\ndukka and Dharma and in order to\nunderstand the relationship between\ndukka and Dharma we have to understand\nwhat duka truly means so the other\nproblem that we run into is that these\nwords are translated as English words\nand then we think we understand what\nthey mean and this is another problem\nthat the mind has is when the Mind gains\nan intellectual understanding of\nsomething it believes that it\nunderstands it right so if you spend\ntime on the internet you will find this\nall over the place where someone hasn't\ndone something but they dismiss it\nbecause the mind understands it this\nwon't work for me this works for you\nthis doesn't really work that doesn't\nwork here's the reasons why it doesn't\nwork the mind doesn't actually have\nexperience it has a intellectual\nunderstanding and it believes that its\nlogic is correct okay so we have to be\nsuper careful about that so let's\nunderstand the word\nduah so what does duka mean\ncomes from the word d which means\nbad and C which means empty Spa uh\nsorry which\nmeans\nspace so literally what lka is is empty\nspace or bad space okay it is it is a\nbad space it is space where space does\nnot\nbelong okay so if yall want to\nunderstand really Whata is if you've\never been to a restaurant and you've sat\nat a table that is wobbly right there's\nthe wobbly\ntable there is a space where it does not\nbelong right there's some like this is\nlike this is the floor this is where the\ntable should be but instead there's some\nGap and in this Gap in this this is the\nbad space this is the space where\nwobbliness happens and so if we look at\nlike\nanything um if so if we look at sort of\nlike the nature of duka duka is\nbasically like space where it doesn't\nbelong or a bad space so I'll give you\nall like a simple example of a couple of\nother simple examples of duka so let's\nsay I eat a slice of pizza now this the\nslice of pizza is supposed to bring me\njoy right like I want to eat a slice of\npizza I'm really hungry it looks\ndelicious it smells delicious but the\nmoment that I take a slice of pizza I\nfeel guilty I'm like man like I should\nhave eaten a salad I shouldn't eat this\nso even in pleasurable things instead of\nus being able to have this experience of\npizza which is supposed to be full of\npleasure that's why we ordered it in the\nfirst place there's actually this little\nspace over\nhere where there's like\nguilt this is\nduka and our whole life is designed to\nget away from dka so even things like\naltruism right so if we look at someone\nlike a soldier who dies for their\ncountry so someone who dies from their\ncountry is also trying to move away from\nduka because it for this person the\nideal of the country is greater than\nthemselves right so like even as we\nengage in negative things we're still\ntrying to get rid of this like emptiness\nwithin us we're always trying to get rid\nof emptiness within us there's a great\nbook called in the realm of hungry\nghosts by Gabor mate in which he talks\nabout addiction as an attempt to fill up\nthe void within us we feel empty on the\ninside and so we go in looking for\nthings to fill the emptiness another\nvery simple example of dka is\nboredom so when there is some when\nthere's boredom nothing for the mind to\nthink about I'm looking to fill the mind\nwith something let me play something fun\nlet me watch something fun let me do\nsomething let me do let me fill up this\nemptiness this emptiness feels bad this\nis bad space this is what dka is now\nlet's talk about\nDharma so Dharma gets loose L translated\nas duty but that's not really what it is\nokay so if we talk about Dharma what\ndoes Dharma mean the root of the word\nDharma is d and d means\nsupport or\nconstant okay so to act in accordance so\nthis is kind of how this works all right\nso what is Dharma so if you look at the\nworld you'll find that there's all kinds\nof\ncircumstances and the circumstances will\nalways change and so if you're trying to\nfigure out how do I live in this world\nlike your circumstances change every\nsingle day there's different kinds of\npeople different kinds of personalities\ndifferent kinds of socioeconomic status\nso what's the right answer we have no\nidea because everyone's an individual so\nas people sat down and explored this\nthey realized there are some constants\nin\nlife and as you start building a life\nbased on constants things will go better\nfor you so one way that I think about\nDharma\nis Dharma is about\nHarmony to live in a way that is\nharmonious so this is also something\nthat the Greek philosophers I I think it\nwas Greek philosophers so they came up\nwith this concept of\nTS which is like I think the purpose or\nvirtue or something I'm a bit Rusty on\nthis stuff so they kind of said like\nokay what is what is the difference\nbetween a good chair and a bad chair\ndoes the object fulfill its purpose so a\nchair is designed to sit on so if a\nchair can support someone's weight it is\nfulfilling its T Lo and this makes it\nvirtuous what's the purpose of a table\nto be able to hold stuff up what's the\npurpose of a plant to be able to provide\nshade or fruit or whatever right so that\nmade these very simple observations that\nthere's like a certain way that objects\nare supposed to be things are supposed\nto be and when they fulfill that purpose\nthat this makes them good and virtuous\nthis is the purpose of\nsomething now let's talk about Dharma so\nthe first thing to understand is Dharma\nis about constancy so when we say\nsupport we don't what we mean is like\nsupport is in the thing that holds other\nthings up this is what Dharma truly is\nokay so Dharma is like the way that we\nlet me think about\nthis\num okay well pause there all\nright so let's talk about the\nrelationship between\nDharma and\nsuffering now that we've understood what\nthese two things are okay so this person\nsays okay Dharma is a copium it's copium\nright it's just something that people\nit's so if we think about what is copium\ncopium is like basically a false thing\nthat people kind of choose to believe\nthat alleviates their suffering in some\nway so there are a couple of things to\nunderstand if we really look at the\nsunkit literature the path to happiness\nor the alleviation of dukka actually has\nfour\nsteps\nDharma\nARA\nK and\nMoka so already in a sense this person\nis\ncorrect that Dharma doesn't\nfix duka it's one of the four pieces\nthat fixes duka so this is Dharma which\nis roughly translated as Duty and then\nARA's wealth\nGMA is\npleasure and Moka is\nLiberation so if you want to be free\nfrom du these are the four things that\nwill alleviate look in some\ncapacity so let's run through them okay\nand then we'll get to Dharma last so we\nknow so even the yogis sort of figured\nout that all right so like if we look at\nthe world today like what's the problem\nin the world today like half the\nproblems of half the people or maybe\nhalf the problems of 90% of people on\nthe planet could be solved with wealth\nright I think this is like we kind of\nknow this that we have a mental health\ncrisis which is really rooted in an\neconomic crisis so the amount and and\nthis this by the way is like something\nthat we don't quite we don't quite\nacknowledge so everyone talks about like\nthe Boomers right the Boomers talk about\nhow like Millennials and gen Z are like\nruining everything and you see all these\narticles like oh my god like people\naren't having babies and I recently\nheard that like Vladimir Putin was\npleading with Russian women to have\nseventh or eighth children I also have\nheard you know I've read articles about\nthis I don't know if it's true or not\nthat China is starting a policy well\nthey they are subsidizing people to have\nkids and then we have all these like\nDoomsday articles like Millennials\naren't buying houses Millennials aren't\nhaving kids oh my God Millennials are so\nlazy genz is so lazy everybody's so lazy\nno this is wrong gen Z Millennials we\nare actually like the best generation on\nthe planet\nlike from an objective standpoint let's\nunderstand why we're the hardest working\nright so we work harder than any\ngeneration above us we work more hours\nand yet we get less for it we have\ninherited a world that has gone to [ __ ]\nso what's happened this is important to\nunderstand so human beings used to\nstruggle and then we developed\ntechnology and for a while as we\ndeveloped technology technology just\ngave us a net benefit in society the\ngoods of Technology outweighed the bads\nso these things like pollution didn't\nreally bother us too much because the\nworld was like generally speaking like\nthere wasn't too much tech there wasn't\ntoo much pollution and so we increased\nefficiency things got better and better\nand better and better and better so what\nhappened is we had a a hundred years of\nhuman beings being able\noh okay we had a group of human beings\nwho for 100 years had technological\nadvancements that could supplement the\nhalf assness of their\nefforts and now what's happened is\ntechnology has caught up with us\ntechnology no longer rapidly improves\nour situation in fact technology is\nstarting to be harmful we've developed\nsuch a beast that is now hurting our\nmental\nhealth and we are the first generation\nthat is dealing with this\nproblem so it's not that we're doing a\nbad job we're actually doing an awesome\njob it's just that we were playing this\ngame with a handicap in our favor right\nso the the that doesn't make sense we're\nplaying this game with an advantage\nright we're playing in tutorial mode\nwith no perade death and now this is\nstarting to catch up to\nus and so everyone is panicking because\nthe systems that used to work are no\nlonger working why are they no longer\nworking because there was some\nartificial thing that was propping this\nstuff up and now it doesn't work\nanymore okay so we're not lazy but\nanyway going back to what we're talking\nabout so if we go back to\nduka\noh sorry so if we go back to\nduka ARA is one of the things that will\nalleviate suffering okay so this is\nsomething that the yogis figured out the\nsecond thing that they noticed alleviate\nsuffering is GMA so pleasure alleviate\nsuffering to some degree so even when\nwe're talking about the pizza so if we\nsort of think about I'm hungry and I\nwant pizza look at all of this dka and\nthen I eat the\npizza and it doesn't fix the problem but\nat least it gets get rid of at 50% right\nlike now I have the guilt over here but\nat least I feel full I no longer have\nthe hunger I have some degree of\npleasure dopamine whatever so this\nalleviates\ndka Dharma alleviates dka as well so\nthis is important to understand it's not\nthat one of these things\nfixes in fact the whole point the reason\nthey came up with four is because you\nneed all four or arguably just Moka but\nwe'll get to that in a second and so the\nway to alleviate suffering is some\namount of like wealth\nright so you have to have some security\nyou can't be hungry all the time or\nthirsty all the time or wet or cold all\nthe time you need some degree of\npleasure like let's enjoy our cup of\ncoffee let's let's go on vacation like\nthese are all things that alleviate\nsuffering obviously right but we don't\nsort of think about it that way the\nproblem is that in our modern\nsociety we only focus on these two so\neveryone's like oh my God like let's be\nAlpha bro like I'm make money I'm I'm\nI'm a [ __ ] ladies or dudes I'm a [ __ ]\neverything that moves like let's go bro\nlike I'mma buy a fancy car I'm go to I'm\ngoing to f first class I'm going to go\nto watch like oh my God like let's make\nthat money I'm a side hustle I'm going\nto hustle my side hustle oh my God like\nlet's go bro and we have a society that\nglorifies this and yet if you look at\nthese people right like if you look at\nthese people who are like very\nsuccessful are they\ndo they behave like contented\nindividuals or are they getting into\nstupid fights with random ass people on\nthe internet because they're so [ __ ]\ninsecure that they can't tolerate any\nkind of criticism from a stranger who\nthey're never going to meet you have\nmillions of dollars and yet you have to\npick a fight with someone on the\ninternet like\nwhat how are you not content clearly\nyou're not content because then you have\na silent majority of people in the world\nwho are relatively intent or maybe\nsilent minority and what how do they\nspend they just don't spend their time\narguing with dumb asses on Twitter right\nthis is\ninsufficient why do we get caught up in\nthis because we know that from this part\nright so if this is if this is the\ncircle of\nduah right we get ARA does\nthis Kama does\nthis Dharma does this and arguably Moka\ndoes either this or for all of this\nwhich we'll get to so we Chase it\nbecause it does fill the hole but it\nonly fills the hole to a certain\nextent and now we can see this\npost right\nso um I do get happiness from things\nlike love friends sex accomplish even\nday-to-day activities but it is\ninsufficient very common right so good\nyall yall are figuring [ __ ] out good\njob now let's talk about\nDharma so how does Dharma help suffering\nso Dharma the real advantage of Dharma\nis not necessarily that it alleviates\nsuffering it is that it makes suffering\ntolerable or even choosable so in\nlife we've got two\noptions if you wake up on any given day\nany time for any decision ever ever you\nhave two options you have a painful\noption\nand you have a pleasurable option or you\nhave a less option or you have a more\noption if you look at any choice right\nso what am I going to eat am I going to\neat pizza or am I going e a salad\nthere's a pleasurable option and there's\na painful option am I going to wake up\ntoday and am I going to out or am I\ngoing to spend 45 minutes on my\nphone am I going to play a video game or\nam I going to study anytime you look at\nlife your mind always has choices and\nthe problem is because of our dopamine\ncircuitry okay\nwe tend to gravitate towards the\npleasurable\noption it's hard to choose the painful\noption so since it's hard to choose the\npainful option what we do we're going to\noh man look look you need to just start\ndoing stuff man like we got to work you\ngot to like brain hack yourself\nmotivation hack yourself dopamine detox\nyourself you got to like hit yourself in\nthe nuts right like look I I this is\nreal I saw this once where some guy was\nlike here's the reason that we're not\ndisciplined this is what you got to do\nyou got to take a $10000 bill and you\ngot to put it on your fridge and you\nhave to make a a decision you have to\ncommit and anytime you don't work out\nand you don't get those gains bro you\ntake that $100 bill and you burn it and\nthen you have to punish yourself you\nhave to punish yourself if you don't do\nthe right thing man that's how you get\ndisciplined you have to commit to it but\n[ __ ] bro if I could commit like what\ndo you think is going to happen I'm just\nnot going to burn the $100 bill if I was\ndisciplined enough to burn the $100 bill\nthen I would be working out to begin\nwith\nyall get that so we have a pleasurable\noption we have a painful option and this\nis why we get so obsessed with willpower\nbrain hacking oh my god let's brain hack\nbro brain hack yeah let's go right\ndiscipline and it's not that these\nthings are bad I'm a fan of all these\nthings but there is a simpler way to do\nall of this stuff so generally speaking\nwe can use all of this crap over here to\novercome this\nor what we can do is Dharma lets us\nchoose the painful option this is the\nreal advantage of Dharma is that it\nmakes suffering more\ntolerable it allows us to even pick the\npath of pain so let me give youall a\nsimple\nexample so I don't like working all\nnight right like no one likes very few\npeople like working all night so there's\na 24-hour period of the day I enjoy\nthings like\nrelaxation and yet when I'm on call as a\nphysician because because I care about\nmy patients and because I have this Duty\nas a medical professional as a medical\ndoctor to take care of other human\nbeings this allows me to tolerate pain\nso the classic example that I use if we\nlook at a human being let's say that\nsomeone points a gun at me okay so if I\nlook at the gun what does the gun mean\nthe gun means pain\ntheft death Badness\nso what is my natural inclination is to\navoid this thing I'm going to move away\nfrom the gun if at all possible okay or\nI'll fight them whatever like if you're\na super chat you can fight them fine\nwhatever but this is something that we\nif there's a painful stimulus we tend to\nmove away from it\nright\nnow let's say that there is a loved one\nover here now suddenly like this whole\nrelationship changes so even though the\ngun still means the same thing\nthis doesn't change like if I get shot\nby a gun like it's still going to hurt a\nlot I could die whatever but this Dharma\nis what if if I love this person over\nhere then I put myself in the path of\nthe gun to protect this other person so\nthe world hasn't change the circumstance\nhasn't changed I'm just choosing the\nhard path I'm choosing the painful path\nand is what allows you to do the hard\nthing and so when you sort of look at\nlike all of these posts right\nI already know everything I should\nnothing compels me to want to do how do\nI move forward if nothing feels exciting\nor rewarding enough to go for it now we\nsee the problem this person is stuck\nover\nhere their mode of operation is to be\ndriven by\nPleasure and now you're you're in a real\nproblem this is a real problem so a lot\nof us have\nbeen conditioned to be controlled by\nPleasure right so which video game do\nyou play do you play the boring game or\ndo you play the fun game I play the fun\ngame dumbass that's why I play it I\ndon't play some shitty ass game I play\nthe fun game which food do you eat do\nyou eat the tasty food or the not tasty\nfood I eat tasty food dumbass I don't\nwant to eat the untasty food right so\nthis is what happens we get conditioned\nto pleasure and once we get condition to\npleasure we open ourselves up to one\nhell of a\nproblem because in the world that we\nlive in today we have so much access to\npleasure that we can start to develop\ntolerance or numbness to\npleasure so as I play the a video game\nfor one hour it's fun second hour Less\nFun third hour Less Fun fourth hour I\ndon't even know why I'm playing this\nthing anymore but I can't\nstop and now we're really stuck because\nif we've been conditioned to move\ntowards pleasure but we develop a\ntolerance to pleasure then we're stuck\nbecause now I don't get the pleasure and\nthat's the only thing that gets me\nmoving in the first place so now I need\npleasure to act but I don't feel the\npleasure anyway so now now what do I do\nI can't do anything I'm\nstuck everyone's just sort of like\nexisting instead of like being motivated\ntowards anything and we see this so I've\nseen this a lot as an addiction\npsychiatrist where there's this idea in\nopiate addiction called chasing the\ndragon and why do opiate addicts chase\nthe dragon it's because the first time\nthey got high holy it was so amazing and\nI'm just chasing that pleasure chasing\nit again every subsequent time you get\nhigh it's never that good it's never\nthat good it's never that good but every\nonce in a while oh my God it's so good\nand so you chase that pleasure over and\nover and over again but the problem is\nthat the world does not give you the\nsame unit of pleasure the same magnitude\nof pleasure as you engage in it over and\nover and over\nagain if that worked we would not have\nany of these\nproblems so what do we do we must move\naway from\npleasure right we can't be driven by\nPleasure because it doesn't\nwork so how do we move away from\npleasure this is where Dharma comes\nin Dharma allows us to choose the\npainful path and so there's research\nthat supports this very simple concept\nso we know in in addiction Psychiatry is\nthat in order to become sober you have\nto have a good enough reason to become\nsober you need something called a\ncompeting\ninterest so this is why when we sort of\ntalk about we talk about addictions\nright so I'll tell like a a really\ninteresting story so when I was learning\nto become I was in medical school at the\ntime and I was trying anyway so I'll\ntell the I've told it before but I'll\ntell it again because we maybe have a\nlot of new people so I was a med student\nand I had a\npatient let's go to\nthis so I was a first year medical\nstudent and I had a patient who was\ntrying to get to quit smoking okay so I\nI went to them and I said hey do you\nknow do you know that smoking is bad for\nyou and they're like yeah and I was like\nbrah I'm medical student man let me tell\nyou it is going to cause lung cancer it\ndamages your respiratory epithelium it\nputs oxidative stress look at all these\nfacts look at all the signs see I'm so\nsmart I'm medic I'm going to be doctor\none day didn't you know and the doctor's\nlike wow doc that sounds really bad I'm\nlike so are you going to quit smoking\nand he's like yeah doc I'm going to quit\nsmoking patient comes back a month later\nI'm like how's it did you quit smoking\nyet and he's like no I I I haven't been\nable to you know I I know I'm supposed\nto and I was like okay I did not doctor\nyou enough nah let me doctor you more\nnot only lung cancer you will get stroke\nyou'll get heart disease it causes all\nof these problems I'm telling you it is\ncausing all of these problems isn't that\nenough for you to quit smoking and he's\nlike\nno didn't work right cuz information\ndoesn't help us overcome addictions what\nwe need in addictions is something\ncalled a competing interest so this is\nsomething we have to understand anytime\nwe're dealing with an addiction if we\nstop the addiction we it sucks it's\npainful like literally painful your body\ngoes to withdrawal in the case of opioid\naddiction you literally just experience\nwhole body pain you start having\ndiarrhea you start to be feeling\nnauseous you can vomit you get chills\nit's it feels worse than cancer I've had\npatients who've been addicted to opiates\nI've had patients who have had stage\nfour metastatic cancer and these people\nwill say withdrawing from opiates is\nworse than stage four metastatic cancer\nthis is what I've heard from them so how\ndo you get this person to stop because\nanytime you stop you go through so much\npain you have to have a\nreason so I got wise right so I started\nto learn this I was still learning I I\ndon't do do this now So eventually this\nperson came\nback and then I decided okay let me get\nto know this person so I got some advice\nfrom people and they were like you have\nto give them a reason to quit so I as\nthis person hey what do you what do you\nlike you know what do you care about in\nlife and they're like you know I have I\nhave two awesome daughters they're\namazing and things like that and I'm\nlike what are you looking forward to\nwell one of them is going off to college\nyou know and like I know that my job as\na dad is is done when these things\nhappen and we sort of got started\ntalking about walking them down the\naisle and they said that you know a\ndream to walk my daughters down the\naisle one day then I asked this guy a\nquestion I said when you walk your\ndaughters down the aisle do you want to\nbe Wheeling an oxygen tank behind you\nand the dude was like what what is this\nkid saying and I'm like yeah well if you\nyou know if you don't stop\nsmoking you know at a minimum you may be\nWheeling an oxygen tank behind you but\nthere's a decent chance you won't be\nable to literally walk down the aisle\nbecause you could be in a\nwheelchair right so this is like the guy\nwas\nlike right so so this made an impact and\nI softened it up I was a firste medical\nstudent at the time so then I became a\npsychiatrist I learned how to use that\nsame principle without bludgeoning\npeople but this is a competing interest\nyou have to have a reason to tolerate\nthe pain this is what Dharma is Dharma\nis a reason to choose\nthe painful\npath now as we do this right what\nhappens to our life so if we look at the\nSuffering The D in our life where does\nthe duka in our life come\nfrom where does the duka in our life\ncome\nfrom so as I I'm living life and I\nchoose pleasure over pain I'm going to\ngame\nokay\nstudy and then I'm going to eat pizza\nversus a\nsalad right and then I'm going to stay\nat home because I feel\nanxious instead of going to a party\nbecause this makes me feel\nanxious so I'm not going to do it I'm\ngoing to\navoid what is what happens to my life\nright so this is my life and as I move\ntowards pleasure more and more and more\nand more and\nmore My Life starts to feel emptier and\nemptier and emptier and\nemptier and then eventually I have life\nwhere it's not it's like what am what am\nI doing here I don't know I'm not doing\nanything worthwhile so the then the\nquestion becomes how do you move down\nthis path Dharma is very very efficient\nat moving down that\npath\nokay so it isn't that\nDharma fixes suffering it's that Dharma\nis one of the four components that will\nreduce your\nsuffering now there's a couple of other\nthings to consider so let's just go\nthrough the post to make sure I didn't\nleave anything\nout\num\nso yeah does that make sense okay so\nlet's pause for questions for a second\nand then I'll continue because we've got\na couple of other\nangles\num okay so what what questions do you\nall have\nokay mocha gu so we'll talk about mocha\nin a second how do I know I found my\nDharma we'll talk about that\ntoo does anyone have questions about\nwhat we does is anything unclear about\nwhat we've discussed about the\nrelationship between\nand Dharma this is first thing to\nunderstand how do you find okay so we'll\ntalk about how to find said\npurpose\nokay yall about to get\n[ __ ] okay so let's talk about how to\nfind your purpose in life Dr K okay this\nis great you're saying Dr K let me\nunderstand you all right you're saying I\ngot to find my purpose is the way that I\nchoose the hard thing in life right\nbecause Dharma it's my Dharma that\nallows me to eat a salad instead of a\nslice of pizza I'm with you but how do I\nfind that purpose what is the greater\npurpose in life that allows me to choose\nsalad instead of pizza right how does\nthat tie to this broader idea of life\nand purpose and the existence of\nhumanity and the stars and we're all\nStardust Dr K how do we how do we\ntranslate this\ninto I'm going to not have cheeseburger\nI'm going to have just a Hamburg I'm\ngoing to cut out the cheese from my life\nI'm going to cut out the soda from my\nlife I don't understand how does it get\nto this broader purpose so let's\nremember that\ndhma is not this bigger broader purpose\nsee this is the this is the thing that\nreally upsets a lot of people we have\nthis idea that Dharma is something that\nis Grand oh my God like I'm going to\nsacrifice I'm going to live my life for\nsomething don't live your life for\nnothing live your life for\nsomething follow me on Instagram we're a\ngroup of people who live our lives for\nsomething not for nothing not for\nnothing you got to you got to wake up in\nthe morning you got to want it you got\nto need\nit you can't just you can't just watch\nporn all the time you got to you got to\nwant it right this what the [ __ ] so\nhere's the crazy thing Dharma is not\nsomething that is Grand remember Dharma\nmeans\nsupport\nconstant\nor yeah support or const constant so\nwhat is your Dharma in life everyone\nthinks that it's some Grand thing and if\nI have some Grand thing like if I have\nkids then I will be able to like work\nreally hard and that works for some\npeople but I would not recommend that\nyou have children for the sake of\nfinding your Dharma okay so the first\nthing is that you\nknow what you need to do to increase the\nharmony of your life so if you're trying\nto find Dharma the first thing to\nunderstand is about it is about\nincreasing Harmony what do I mean by\nHarmony so if we look at the wobbly\ntable right this space is a disharmony\nit is things that don't fit so if you\nlook at your life what you will find is\nthat if you are not living in accordance\nwith Dharma there will be a lot of\ndisharmony there will be a lot of space\nthat is created around you and there\nwill be\nfriction so let's just understand a\ncouple of things so when you wake\nup Do You Are you a do things feel fluid\nto you I know this is going to sound\nkind of weird but like do things feel\nfluid and easy is your life harmonious\ndo you wake up feeling refreshed and\nthen are able to do what you need to do\nfor the day tasks that you need to get\ndone you start working on or is\neverything in your life a friction a\nfriction a friction a friction a\nfriction see this is the way that I\ndon't know if y'all can hear my belly\nrumbling but this is a friction too so I\nskipped a meal today and so this is\ncreated\nfriction so this is what's really\nimportant to understand the first d is\nnot about anything Grand now the reason\nthat we look for a grand Dharma a Dharma\nwith a capital D right I'm GNA do\nsomething with my\nlife is because this is very ego\ngratifying because if I'm a little [ __ ]\nperson I need to accomplish something\nvery\nbig right when I was failing out of\ncollege I had dreams to go to\nHarvard when I was premat I was like I'm\nI'm going to go to Harvard and I'm going\nto be the best I'm going to be the\nsmartest I'm going to be the greatest\neveryone's going to look at me and\nthey're going to be like oh my God that\nguy went to\nHarvard and the big irony is when it's I\n[ __ ] gave up that [ __ ] I was like\n[ __ ] this I'm a [ __ ] loser I'm just\ngoing to try to do the best that I can\nin life and let's see if I'm grateful\nhopefully after three years of applying\nto med school maybe one day some after\ngetting get rejected from 120 Med\nschools maybe one day I will even get a\nchance to be a doctor that's enough give\nup on your big\ndreams and the irony is that when I\nstarted doing that I could focus on the\nwork instead of focusing on whatever\nfulfilling my dreams right I don't know\nif this makes sense but like you can\nhave a big house but like you still have\nto build it one brick at a time and\nthere's a weird thing that happens when\nwe have Big Dreams Big Dreams sabotage\nour ability to work everyone's like oh\nman like aim for the\nStars no so let let's understand saying\nthis we have this part of our\nbrain that has to do with motivation\nokay so we\nhave our prefrontal cortex and we have\nour nucleus succumbent okay so we're\ngoing to do a quick side note on\nmotivation and why this is going to\nscrew you okay so the nucleus accumbens\nis our source of\nmotivation okay and the PFC is our\nsource of value\ngeneration so what the PFC does is it\ngen it tries to assess the value of an\naction and then what it does is if the\nvalue generation is in favorable then it\nwill go and it'll motivate you to do it\nso if I have a big\ndream\nokay and let's say I want to go to\nHarvard because that's what I wanted to\ndo and then I wake up one day and my\nbrain is looking at going to Spanish\nclass should I go to class this\nmorning what percentage of attending\nSpanish class this\nmorning what percentage of progress have\nI made towards my dream of attending\nHarvard Medical School maybe this even\nif I'm lucky it's probably less than\nthis statistically you know it's\nprobably like you know one millionth\nit's just one class it's this so then\nour PFC looks at this and it says how\nimportant is this for fulfilling this\ngoal and it's like you know what it's\nbasically insignificant so we're not\ngoing to do\nit it's not worth it and if yall are\nstuck in life doing the same time\nwasting\nactivities I will bet you money that\nwhen you try to do something else your\nmind tells you it is not worth it it is\nnot\nenough so if we look at this concept of\nenough where does the concept of enough\ncome from the concept of enough comes\nfrom the ratio of this to the box that\nwe're filling the bigger our dreams the\nless the less enough any given task will\nbe okay so the first thing to understand\nis this principle and how Dharma with a\ncapital D finding your purpose in life\npurpose purpose with a capital P baby\nthis is why I'm on the earth I'm here to\ndo this work son and until you're ready\nto do the\nwork\ncapital P this is not what Dharma is\nDharma is smaller than that Dharma is\nTiny Dharma is emptying your trash\ncan increasing the harmony between you\nand the life around you emptying your\ntrash can you don't have to eat healthy\nor get swool but adding a a serving of\nfruit or vegetable Dharma is a tiny\nlittle thing being slightly less of an\n[ __ ] to the people around you right\nwe're not saying that you have to be\nSaint be slightly good in some ways\nthese are tiny little things so your\nfirst Dharma is to take care of\nyourself your body is a temple and you\nshould treat it as\nsuch so what do you do for your body do\nyou take care of it every single day\nbecause this is the only thing you're\nthe only one who's responsible for\ntaking care of this right no one else is\ngoing to knock down your door and is\ngoing to make you take care of your body\nyour poor body just think about this for\na second your poor body who does it have\nlooking out for it right you in charge\nof it and how do you treat this thing do\nyou take care of it do you exercise\nevery day do you stretch every day do\nyou sit in in a in a the chair for nine\nhours a day oh I have to do it for work\nokay what happens after work well then\nI'm\ntired but what about your poor body\nwho's going to take care of your body if\nyou don't take care of it\nright so this is what happens we don't\nbut it's\nhard you're right so that's because\nyou're going down the route of pleasure\nthis is\nadik right you're the only one who can\ntake care of your body so the first\nthing is take care of\nyourself and this is where I would say\nlike if you guys are starting okay start\nwith a 1H hour walk every single day so\nI've done this in the hardest parts of\nmy life I have taken walks so this has\nbeen in the heat of over 100° he in\nIndia taking a 1 hour walk Come H high\nwater and there's also been in 18 de\ndegree weather in Boston when it's like\nsnowing outside and stuff like that\nright so it's like rain or shine like\ntake a walk right if it's unsafe don't\ndo it so there's days that I did not\ntake a walk because it's there's black\nice and I'll slip and fall and whatever\nbut like just take a\nwalk all right eat\nhealthier and now this is where the mind\nis going to be like but what do you mean\nlike how healthy should I eat this\nserving of thing everyone's like on the\nInternet is like you do this protocol\nand do this protocol and then like this\nis what I'm going to do Bros like okay\nso like we know that cruciferous\nvegetables are very friendly they alter\nyour cytochrome p450 we need fiber with\nthe problem the problem is that in\ncruciferous vegetables when we eat\ncrucifer vegetables we have a problem\ncuz we are bound by our digestion okay\nso I I have the ultimate I have the\nultimate I the ultimate body hack to get\nyou all the fiber that you need you take\nan enema and you fill it with broccoli\nwith protein powder and then you shove\nit off your ass and then you you just go\nstraight you're going to bypass you're\ngoing to bypass the stomach see the\nstomach is the the thing that restricts\nhow much nutrients you can take how\nswoll you can get 200 gram of protein\nright off the ass that's what we're\ngoing to do\nnow and if it's not 200 g you should\n[ __ ] the [ __ ]\nup right the eat healthier come on you\nknow you don't need some Harvard trained\ndoctor to tell you what it means to eat\nhealthy eat healthier take care of your\nbody you know what to do one serving of\nfruit and vegetable one walk for an\nhour okay this is number one for taking\ncare of your\nbody number two for finding your dhma so\nlet's talk for a second about why it's\nhard to find your Dharma\nso the second thing that we have to\nreally consider is that there's a\nthere's a challenge with finding our\nDharma\ntoday which is that our attention is\nexternalized so there's this weird\nproblem where when we look at like okay\nlike how am I supposed to find what I do\nwith my\nlife so this is kind of weird to\nunderstand but the more that we\nexternalize our\nattention\nright so if I spend my time watching TV\nplaying video games responding to emails\ntalking to people around me like I spent\nall of my mind my mind is not with me\nanymore so even when I'm doing\nproductive things like cleaning and\ncooking and whatever in order to be\nefficient I'm listening to a podcast\nright because I got to use that time and\nI was this way like so when I was like\nstarting med school right or trying to\ntowards the end of getting into med\nschool I'd be super efficient so it's\nlike\nlistening to some lecture in the morning\nlistening to a lecture when I'm walking\nto the train in the train I'm going to\npull out my notes when I get to school\nit's headphones back in walking to the\nlecture then attending the lecture then\ngoing to the library reviewing the\nlecture right and it's this is what it\nis constant constant constant\nexternalization of\nattention in the guise of\nproductivity and as I spend all of my\ntime outside of myself I lose my\nconnection with\nmyself and as I start to lose my\nconnection with myself I wake up one day\nand I ask myself what should I\ndo now when we have when we ask this\nquestion what should I do we can get a\nsource information from two sources one\nis from\ninside and one is from\noutside now the problem is that the more\nthat I look to the outside for this\nanswer the more\nfriction I will create let's understand\nwhy you are a unique human being you are\njust\nyou right no one else knows your mind no\none else has your experiences no one\nelse has your personality your\nadvantages your disadvantages so the\nrest of the world tells you you should\nbe this the world says you should be\nthis and they say here's how to do it\nbut there's always going to be a\ndiscrepancy between the advice or what\nthe world tells you to do and you\nthere's never going to be a 100%\ntranslation this is why we need\nclinicians instead of basic science\nresearch to help people with addictions\nwe have all this Neuroscience figured\nout we have all the psychology figured\nout but when you translate science to an\nindividual life you require a\nclinician you have to take all that\nscientific knowledge and apply it to\nyou and there's another problem here is\nthat as we externalize our\nattention the internal mind gets piled\nup with crap okay so we see this like\ncycles that starts to emerge so as I as\nI spend more and more time let's say\nlike watching stupid stuff on the\ninternet I start to procrastinate and\nthen I feel guilty and then I start to\nfeel behind and then I'm start to feel a\nlittle bit insecure right because I'm\nlooking at all these people on social\nmedia who have these ripped bodies and\nso much more money than I do and there's\nso much thinner and they have thigh gaps\nand I don't have a thigh gap right and I\nstart to feel worse about myself and\nthen what happens so as I feel worse\nabout myself spending time with myself\nbecomes difficult because I'm just I\nbecome a\ncesspool right and we even see it in in\nthis\none so\nlike\num there is nothing so valuable that I\nwould want to go through what I have\nlived and suffered so far and that\nbefore we even account for future\nsuffering so this person has suffered\nintensely on the\ninside right and if you look at all\nthese posts like why should I live if I\ndon't want to what's the meaning of life\nI'm slowly becoming an nihilist whether\nyou're sad or not sad some people are\nsad some people aren't sad is this pile\nthis stuff piles up as the internal\nenvironment piles up we gravitate more\ntowards the external environment because\nI don't like sitting with me so one good\nexample of this is\nboredom what is\nboredom boredom is just existing with\nyourself that's literally what it is\nright when you have no external thing to\noccupy your mind you get bored what do\nyou have you have just yourself the most\nboring thing on in the world is being\nwith\nyourself right so we are so gravitated\ntowards the external environment and\nthis can become a vicious cycle by the\nway because as this negative negativity\npiles up we have\ntechnology which supress Es are amydala\nand limic\nsystem so when I'm feeling bad if I go\nto technology what technology will do is\nit'll cover this stuff up it'll suppress\nthose parts of our brain it doesn't fix\nanything so then what happens is I\nprocrastinate for one more day and I\nfeel guilty and then when I go to bed at\nnight oh my God all this stuff comes\nrushing back and what is my antidote to\ndeal with this run away from it run away\nrun away run away run away run away as\nfar as you can so we gravitate towards\nthe outside as we gravitate towards the\noutside we get disconnected from\nourselves and as we become a pile of\n[ __ ] on the\ninside we don't like this how do I fix\nit I'm going to turn to the outside tell\nme how to fix\nit and that's where they're like [ __ ]\nyeah baby I'm glad you showed up here\ncuz let me tell you what son when you\nwere pathetic this is what you got to do\nto fix your life you got to be Alpha you\ngot to be look maxing you got to be jaw\nsurgery you got to be a foot taller you\nneed a dick that's one foot bigger right\nand sorry I'm I'm sort of adopting a\nmale perspective on this but this is\ntrue of women as well so this is where\nlike once again we got to wear this\nparticular makeup we have to use these\ncosmetic brands I need to get eye\nsurgery I need to get BOTOX I need have\na thigh gap I need to be able to cook\nthis kind of meal I need to be a girl\nthat's different from the other\ngirls right I got to be a boss babe I\ngot to sell Amway products I got to be\nMy Own Boss babe I got to one of these\nparticular high heels and by the way the\ninternet loves this right because the\ninternet has figured out hey if we can\nmake you insecure we can sell you\n[ __ ] and the more insecure you are the\nmore time you will spend on our platform\nrunning away from this\nso the more insecure you become you\ndon't like yourself so you start moving\nout into the world and then when you\ndon't feel good about yourself when you\ndon't feel insecure the world has\nanswers for you they say this is what\nyou should do oh you don't feel\npretty wear these pants by shapewear\nwhich literally takes the parts of your\nbody that you don't like and compresses\nthem we've moved back like 300 years or\n200 years back to the Victorian area of\ncorsets where we we are using physical\nthings to adjust the shape of our body\nshapewear Botox thigh gaps makeup take\nyour pick something is wrong with you\nand we will fix\nit and as you disconnect from\nyourself you end up chasing all of these\nthings and then we end up with an adoric\nlifestyle and what does that mean an\nadoric lifestyle that means on any given\nday we are doing something random that\nwe think is the right thing to\ndo right okay so I need to work on my\ncareer I need to get sexier I need to\nmake more money I need to become taller\nI need to be a gamer girl I need to be\nmore of an eir and Dudes Only like women\nwho put out so I need to put out\nmore right the rest of the world says do\nthis do this do this and since you have\nno internal compass and by the way\nthey're all competing right so one\nperson says go this way one person says\ngo this way one person says goes this\nway one person get says go\ngo go this way and some of us get stuck\nwe get stuck between a thousand\ndifferent things we have a a group of\ninstruments that we bought on the\ninternet that are collecting dust we\nhave art supplies in our\nbasement we're trying to save up money\nfor some kind of cosmetic\nsurgery we've lost complete touch with\noursel we have no sense of internal\ncompass then how can we find our purpose\nit's my purpose I'm unique my karma is\nunique my body is unique my mind is\nunique the world that I live in is\nunique everything about you is 100%\nunique how are you going to find an\nanswer from some Guru on the\ninternet right and y'all may say but Dr\nK aren't you a guru [ __ ]\nno I'm not telling you what to do I'm\ntelling you how it is you decide what to\ndo and then we also have something else\nwhich is that sometimes if we're super\nChads we actually check all these\nboxes I got the career I got this i got\nthis i got this i got this and then we\nend up\nhere this is\ninsufficient\nah now oh did I make a new one okay so\nnow we get to\nMOA right so Dharma\nMOA but before we get to mocha we're\ngoing to talk a little bit more\npractically so let's talk more\npractically if if you're in this\nsituation what do you do how do you find\nyour\nDharma so what you need to do is\nintrospect spend more time with\nyourself because let me explain\nsomething to\ny'all the world can't tell you what you\nwhat you want the world cannot tell you\nwhat you want boy does the world want to\ntell you what you want boy does the\nworld try to convince you that this is\nwhat you want this is literally we have\nan industry called\nadvertising and what does the industry\nof advertising do it tries to convince\nyou to want things and not just\nadvertising we also have this other kind\nof thing called propaganda which we're\ntrying to shape your thinking everyone\nis trying to shape your thinking to\nbelieve this and do that and buy this\nthe one thing that they don't want oh my\nGod what is the worst kind of user on\nany app or platform the one who\nuninstalls and no longer\nparticipates oh [ __ ] cuz then we can't\ncontrol you if you leave the platform we\ncan't influence you in any way you've\nbeen lost to us don't leave baby come\nback come back and let us feed your\ninsecurities and then solve them with\nwithout our $150 yoga pants let me tell\nyou something the world is becoming\nincreasingly materialistic and\ncapitalistic that's why we need to be\nspiritual and the way that we are going\nto be spiritual is to buy these yoga\npants these is the most they have the\nenergies of the powerful yoga they have\n$150 and they will allow you to be free\nfrom\ncapitalism free shipping and handling of\norders over\n$160 so for yoga pant I'm sorry it does\nnot qualify for a fee shipping it is\n$259 .5 for shipping or you can buy one\nother\nthing we have jock\nstrap which holds your junk in a\nparticular place and that one is only\n$18.95 and then you will get free\nshipping so order it and be less\nmaterialistic yeah okay\ngreat introspection spend time with\nyourself go for a walk take care of your\nbody these are the first dharmas these\nare your starting dhas and now we're\ngoing to really go off the rails before\nwe talk about\nMOA here's the last thing that people\ndon't tell you about Dharma your Dharma\nis waiting for you whether you want it\nor not so now I'm going to completely\nleave science behind and I'm going to go\nto something that I'm 100% confident in\nbut probably won't make sense I'm going\nto break ranks with all of my other\ncolleagues who are teaching about\nmeditation on the Internet by distilling\nthings to that which is understandable\nor believable so there's a difference\nbetween what is believable and\nacceptable and what is true and now I'm\ngoing to depart from the believable the\nscientific and move towards the truth\nnow this is not truth in the objective\ntruth this is just what I think is the\ntruth I'm 100% confident in what I'm\nabout to say but I'll be the first to\nsay that I could be [ __ ] wrong\nbecause there's no science behind it\nright so maybe I'm\ndelusional so your Dharma waits for you\nand this is the cool thing about life\nlife is just like a video game where you\ndon't get your Dharma with a capital D\nuntil you fix the Dharma with the little\nD you don't get your tutorial you you\ndon't get to fight the raid boss until\nyou're done with the tutorial this is\nhow life is I observed it in my own life\nI've observed it in hundreds of people\nthat I've helped your Dharma is waiting\nfor you but you're not ready for\nit and so thankfully the universe is in\nyour favor and they're not going to just\nset you up to fail it's waiting you have\nto complete the tutorial before level\none comes and when you finish level one\nyou become level two and when you become\nlevel two then you go to level three and\nthen you go to level four and then\nyou'll end up getting the raid boss and\nhere we are addicted to\npornography eating unhealthy food and\nwe're like what where's my purpose I\ndon't know what my that's because you're\nnot [ __ ] ready for it and if it faced\nyou you would get\ncrushed that's the\ntruth when you are ready things will\nhappen and if yall really pay attention\nto this you will see\nthis so there's something that's really\ninteresting is happening the better I\nget at life the harder my life becomes\nholy [ __ ] right so at the beginning what\nwas my job it's just get this pile of a\nmess to go to class that was level\nnumber one right and I failed at that\nfor so many years and then once it was\ngo to class it's like okay let's\nactually do these applications and then\nwhat's the next level beyond\nthat it's like okay when you fail when\nyou get 40 rejection letters from\nmedical schools every single envelope\nand and by the way I even figured this\nout so when they send you a big envelope\nit's an acceptance when they say send\nyou a little envelope it's a\nrejection and it was so traumatizing to\nopen up traumatizing for me in a\nprivileged sense to look at that letter\nand know [ __ ] this is another rejection\nthis is another rejection this is but\nthere's a chance right this is what was\nso painful about it is there's a chance\nthat maybe I'm\nwrong maybe this is an acceptance and I\nheld on to a little bit of Hope and then\nI opened that thing and it was another\nrejection and then with each rejection\nthat I got it became harder and harder\nand harder to\nHope and then the Hope Was Gone\ncompletely and then next year rolls\naround and then I ask myself the\nquestion I feel like I have no hope I\nhave 40 rejections what's the chance\nthat something could happen very low am\nI going to act in accordance with my\nhopes or am I going to act in accordance\nwith something else the my prefrontal\ncortex is telling me that this is a\nwaste of time am I going to listen to it\nor not that was the next\nlevel and so I beat that level I applied\nfor a second year didn't get in applied\nfor a third year got into medical\nschool and then like it was\neasy right so from going from a 2.5 GPA\nand 119 rejections to medical school to\nwinning two Awards which I didn't even\ngo to the award ceremony because it\nnever dawned on me that I would win an\naward because I'm the kid who is last in\nthe class and [ __ ] barely scraped in\nby some Grace of the universe or God or\ndumb luck RNG right I'm playing some Goa\ngame in life where I'm buying these\nlottery tickets and then eventually I\ngot one this is not the kid who wins two\nAwards when they they graduate from med\nschool and then has my life become\neasier no\nit's become harder harder and harder and\nharder and harder and\nharder because now what is my job do I\nget to sit here and take care of myself\nno I have to sit here and take care of\nyou because this is my Dharma because if\nI'm not going to do it who else is going\nto do\nit right so this is what Dharma is about\nit's what are you going to\ndo if you don't do this thing who else\nwill do it and if the answer is no one\nthat is your Dharma in a nutshell who's\ngoing to take care of you [ __ ] no one\nso you have to do\nit who's going to take care of your dog\nwho's going to take care of your cat no\none then you have to do\nit and then as you level up the game\ngets harder everyone wants a Dharma with\na capital D they suck trust me you do\nnot want it it's\nharder not\neasier and this is why people have\ntrouble finding their Dharma so you're\ndisconnected with your yourself and then\nthe other thing is honestly you're not\nready for it because let's say let's\njust say hypothetically for a moment\nright that there was some great big task\nthat you're supposed to accomplish could\nyou handle it right\nnow and this is what's really tricky\nright because there's a there's a\nbalance between okay as I can handle\nsomething right so as you move towards\nthat great or good it gives you some\nsense of purpose alleviates some degree\nof suffering allows you to choose the\nhard task and then you level up and you\nlevel up and you level up and you level\nup and and in the people that I work\nwith they walk this path too where the\nmore successful you become the more\npeople turn to you for guidance and\nsupport and help you become the\nfinancial pillar of your family because\nyou're the only one who's managed to get\na\njob and the weight that you carry grows\nand grows and grows and grows and grows\nand this is what's [ __ ] awesome about\nit is then you get to decide are you\ngoing to lift that weight or not right\nthis is where Dr K becomes are you going\nto lift weight son and then you have to\ndecide do you want to give into this\nthing or don't give into this thing but\nthis is the thing everyone's like what's\nmy Dharma how do I find my Dharma your\nDharma you know what your Dharma is you\njust don't want to do\nit oh yeah I don't want to like take\ncare of myself I don't want to like\nbecome more compassionate I don't want\nto stop wasting my time on the internet\nI want some big fancy Thea let me get\nlet me take a fancy one can I have a\nfancy dma I don't want oh my God I don't\nwant to clean things up I don't want to\nbe nice I want to be an [ __ ] can I be\na narcissistic [ __ ] on the internet\nplay thank\nyou you [ __ ] know what you need to do\ncome\non and then this is where the PFC comes\nin and says but that's not enough now\nhere's the thing to understand so you\nhave to watch out for when your mind\ndevalues\nsomething this is trickery of the mind\nyou don't want to do something and Along\nComes Your\nPFC and your nucleus succumbent is like\nwe don't want to do this and the PFC is\nlike all right bro I got you I'm going\nto tell you it's a waste of time I'm\ngoing to tell you it's not enough see\nproblem\nsolved now you are\nrationally thank God we're being\nrational we have a rational explanation\nas to why cleaning your [ __ ] room is\nnever going to be enough thank God we\ndon't have to do it and oh my God this\nrational explanation it's lit son let me\ntell you I have the best product for you\nPFC comes to the nucleus coms I have\nthis thing called rationality and we can\nuse rationality to justify\nwhatever degenerate lifestyle you want\nlet's go\nrational oh meditate forget that it\ndoesn't work I tried it see this is the\nother thing about the mind it thinks it\nunderstands I tried it it doesn't work\nfor me period how long did you try it\nhow hard did you try it how much\ninstruction did you get oh no no it\ndoesn't work I am right and it is\nwrong\nvery\ntricky so your Dharma first of all is\nhard to get to because we don't\nintrospect enough because we call\nintrospection\nboredom right it's crazy just be with\nyourself for a while see what happens do\nthat start to connect with in here and\nthen this will tell you what you want\nthis will tell you what you should be\ndoing and then instead of this we turn\nto the outside world which tells us all\nkinds of crap about what what we should\nbe doing right oh you should do this and\nby the way let me let me get you like\nthere's this very special product that I\nhave that will help you do it in order\nto look Max oh you're having trouble\nwith dating you should be look maxing\nmore and by the way buy this thing\nthat'll help you looks\nMax\nokay and then we get pulled into a\nthousand different\ndirections then we're like what is my\nDharma or we even tell ourselves Dharma\nis copium\nno so like I don't I mean I think it can\nbe copium certainly right so if our mind\ngets take takes advantage of it and it\ncan be absolutely can be copium but I\ndon't think it's copium it's just how to\nlive a harmonious life right how to live\nin accordance with everything around you\nand this is what what they sort of mean\nby that\nconstancy because if we look at life\nlife is an interaction between\nstuff and when you operate in line with\nthat interaction your life is harmonious\nwhen you operate with friction your life\nis not\nharmonious right so even if we look at\nsomething like a\njacket a jacket creates Harmony between\nme and the environment that's all it\ndoes so as we engage in this this\nharmony moving uh engaging stuff we'll\nour life will be better now people may\nask does that mean that I should like do\nwhat people around me want no so pay\nattention right so when do you set\nboundaries when do you not set\nboundaries you look at what this does to\nthe harmony of your life\nlife does acceding to this person's\nrequests increase the harmony of my life\nor decrease the harmony of my life and\nwhat is your Dharma just ask yourself\ndoes this increase the harmony of my\nlife or decrease the harmony of my life\nif it increases the harmony it is Dharma\nand you should do\nit and it's not something so Grand and\nlater on you'll get Grand stuff don't\nworry unfortunately you will get Grand\nstuff you don't want Grand stuff Grand\nstuff is harder raid boss has way more\nhit points than the tutorial\nmobs\nokay\nso what questions before we move\non\nokay so there's some questions\nlike\num okay so but I even if it's a reality\ncheck I still don't want to do anything\nof what he is saying we'll we'll get to\nthat in a second\num what's the difference between\nfriction and healthy challenges so the\nquestion is what happens to your Harmony\nat the\nend see when I when I let's talk about\nsetting boundaries so when I acced to\nsomeone who's toxic what H what does my\nlife look like for the next 10 years if\nthis person is in my life right so if it\nif they're if it's not good then I\nshould if it reduces my Harmony then\nmove away from it and that's the whole\npoint is when we talk about healthy\nchallenges right Dharma is the thing\nthat allows you to embrace the pain for\nthe sake of something\ngreater and it starts with you so should\nyou exercise yes why because you're the\nonly one who can take care of your body\nso you should take care of your\nbody what about pushing your boundaries\nwell that's that's fine\ntoo right it it's not about to adhere to\na boundary or push a boundary or\nwhatever because like your situation is\nunique right so we can't say you should\npush boundaries or you shouldn't push\nboundaries my point is look at the\nthings that only you can take care of\nand those are the things that you could\ntake care of if they're hard or\ndifficult or they result in anxiety or\navoidance or whatever like that's fine\nthat they're just going to be hard and\nso do it it\nanyway and then people will say but it's\nhard to do it anyway fine right so you\nhave to start somewhere that's why I\nkind of said everyone's like looking for\nsome see this is the Mind wants some\ncomplex thing y'all want me to make you\nguys don't want to do\nthis\nokay so let's go through a couple of\nthings all right so I say take a\nwalk eat healthier\num\nexercise\nright\nsocialize\nsome right even engage in\npleasure by all\nmeans attain\nwealth and\nsecurity this is what you should do this\nis D do all these things now this is\nwhat the mind so you guys want some\nreally complicated thing right so pay\nattention to your mind your mind is like\nI'm over here I don't think this is\ngoing to work so Dr K build me a path to\ngo from here to here but I don't want to\ndo that because the more I build you the\npath the more this becomes and then this\nis eating healthy and then your PFC\nwon't like it and who what the [ __ ] do I\nknow how am I supposed to build a path\nfor what you're supposed to do with your\nlife I don't\nknow but what I have\nseen is that as you start to take steps\nin the direction and you\nintrospect you need to listen to\nyourself because the rest of the world\nwill tell you to do this to do this to\ndo this to do this but they don't know\nyou I don't know you I can't map out a\nlife for\nyou I know y'all want me to but I would\nbe wrong what do I know I mean some of\ny'all are 36 some of y'all are\n63 how am I supposed to give you generic\nadvice that'll work for all of you so\nconnect with yourself first and foremost\ndo something take care of yourself and\nthen the other stuff will come so this\nis the other thing that I've noticed is\nthat you're not actually doing it alone\nthere's a lot of help so you want to\nfill in all this stuff this stuff the\nworld is going to do for you buddy you\njust need to do your part and you will\nfind the support that you need this has\nbeen my experience the experience of the\nmajority of people that I've worked with\nI want to say 100% of people that I've\nworked with but I'm sure there's some\nkind of cognitive bias going on in my\nmind that cannot be trusted when I say\nthat that's what I\nbelieve but scientifically it sounds\nlike BS BR come\non\nokay I think I'm going to be stuck\nforever it seems good so now we\nunderstand see this is what the Mind\ndoes see this is very important to\nunderstand so when your mind tells you\nsomething like I'm going to be stuck\nforever it or it won't be enough or this\nwon't work what does your mind letting\nyou do with that thought what is the end\nresult of that thought that means that\nyou don't have to eat healthy today do\nyouall see that very important to\nunderstand any kind of conclusion that\nyour mind comes to you have to look at\nwhat is the direction that the\nconclusion wants me to\ngo and what y'all will find 90% of the\ntime is that the mind is telling you\nthings to craft the life that it wants\nnot that you want that it wants you may\nsay but what do you mean by it well just\npay attention to your mind what does it\nwant it wants video games it wants\npornography it wants unhealthy food it\ndoesn't it intellectually understands\nsome of these vague consequences but it\ndoesn't it's like I don't want that but\nI don't want\nunhealthiness or I want pizza more than\nI want to be healthy\nso it always moves towards What It Wants\nunless it is trained you have to be\ncontrol in control of\nit okay so you must be rigorous and this\nis the basic problem that we have is\nthat we trust our mind but you think\nabout it for a second who is responsible\nfor conditioning your\nmind the world and oh my God do they\nlove to condition you because if they\ncan control your mind they can control\nyour\nactions right because your mind controls\nyou you don't control it so all I have\nto do is control the mind this why\nadvertising is literally a thing they do\nstudies where they look at different\nkinds of colors and they look at okay if\nI make this advertisement with these two\ncolors it'll induce people's behavior\nmore they it it's become a precise\nscience man\nso one of my\ncolleagues was an empathy researcher at\nMass General Hospital in Harvard Medical\nSchool he started a\ncompany in which he hooked people up so\nhe was an empathy researcher so he' take\nan EEG heart rate monitor all kinds of\nother physiologic monitors he started a\ncompany where he hooked people up to all\nthis stuff and he had them watch\nadvertisements and then people would pay\nhim to figure out which advertisement\nworks the best and this isn't some focus\ngroup low Tech Noob level [ __ ] this is\nlike we're going to hook you up to the\nmost sophisticated scientific equipment\nthat exists and measure what this\nadvertisement does to you we're going to\ndo it to 50 people and we're going to\ntell you out of these 10 variants of the\nad this is the one that works the\nbest his company got acquired by\nneelen very successful\ncompany so so the world wants to\nconvince you and then your mind is we\njust trust our mind right so let's take\na quick look at a\npost I don't think he's evil or anything\nby the\nway\num okay so let's take a look at this one\nI already know everything I should do\nbut nothing compels me to want to do\nthem how do I move myself forward in\nlife if nothing feels exciting or\nrewarding enough to go for it so this\nproblem is very\nsimple see this is what's\ntricky do your wants control your\nlife so this is why everyone wants\nmotivation everyone is like how do I\nfind motivation how do I find motivation\nhow do I find motivation because if you\nare motivated that is a natural\ninclination within you to move in a\nparticular\ndirection so everyone is looking for\nmotivation because they are lazy and\nwhen they find the person who is the\nmost motivated is the laziest you may\nsay what the [ __ ] does that mean doctor\nokay just hear me out because when you\nare motivated you don't need to push\nyourself because there's a natural\ninclination you don't actually control\nyou the Mind want something and you're\nlike okay you go for it oh my God I hope\nI want to study today oh my God I hope I\nwant to study today I hope I want to\nread instead of playing a video game I\nhope I want to socialize instead of\nwatching porn I hope I hope I hope I'm\nmotivated towards all these things\nbecause we have no control over\nourselves when you have no control over\nyourself you pray for motivation in the\nright\ndirection and this is what happens right\nso when we have no control over our\nactions and we rely on motivation then\nwe're screwed if we do not want things\nbecause if we want\nsomething then we'll do it and now\nwhat's happened is my life Falls to what\nI want and now you're really screwed\nbecause who controls what you want do\nyou control what you want hell no right\nthat's the one thing that we can be 100%\ncertain about is I don't get to control\nwhat I\nwant right for a hundred years people\ntried to do this with the homosexual\nCommunity where we're like hey you were\nattracted to this person who is the same\ngender as you we are going to fix that\nwe are going to change what you want we\nare going to control what you want and\nyou can control what you want doesn't\nwork you don't control what you want so\nnow the question becomes very simple do\nyou want to live a life where you are\ndirected by your wants or do you want to\nlive a life where you are not directed\nby your wants does your desire control\nyou or do you control your\ndesire\nand you got have a thousand reasons to\nto that you should do it and now we'll\nkind of get in more detail to the\npost I look at these goals and I feel no\nstrong pull towards them right so that's\nthe thing this person is looking for\ngravitation I should do all this\nstuff and I look at these goals and\nthere's no strong pull it's just ah that\ndoesn't sound exciting or fulfilling at\nall now let's tunnle down into the mind\nthis is tricky\nso when the Mind does not want something\nit will convince\nyou that this is this doesn't sound\nexciting or fun you won't enjoy this so\nnow we don't have to put forth effort\nright let me convince you that this is\nnot going to be worth\nit and we just trust the\nmind right so this person is like [ __ ]\nin a couple of ways we all are because\nwhat we should do the world has\nprogrammed us that we should do all of\nthis kind of stuff right and then we\ndon't want to do\nit so there's no internal drive right\nthere's no\nmotivation and then we're kind of\nstuck I break up within months because I\nget bored so this is a basic problem of\nyou are not in control of your mind your\nmind is in control of you very\nsimple I just do it and then think all\nright what else do I do with my life\nokay fine so the first thing to do if\nyou are in this situation where you\ndon't want things but you should do them\nis you must control your\nmind so meditation is the number one\nthing right so why is meditation the\nnumber one thing it is the practice of\nyou gaining control of your mind instead\nof your mind controlling you so\nliterally what we do in meditation it's\nthe most direct form of practice if my\nmind wants to think about something\nelse no we're going to think about this\nthe mind is like I want to go over here\nyou're like no we're going to think\nabout\nthis so then what happens as you\nmeditate more and more and more is you\nbecome your actions become independent\nof your wants see this is a big problem\nwhere we are all trying to cultivate a\nparticular want but we are fundamentally\nnot in control of it how do I get\ninspired how do I get motivated how do I\nget this how do I get this how do I get\nthis right I want to make it easy on\nyourself no you just you decide when you\nsay jump the Mind should\njump right we don't go through life with\nlike our hands doing whatever the [ __ ]\nthey\nwant I want to do this right now and I\ntell my hands to stop and my hands are\nlike no [ __ ] you but this is what\nhappens with our mind our mind is run\nwild we don't control it anymore so it\ndecides it wants something and we're\nlike okay fine you're the\nboss because if we don't listen to it it\npunishes\nus it makes us\nbored oh my God don't play a video game\nwhy not what'll happen I'll be\n[Music]\nbored so you guys want if you guys want\nto really train your mind you want to\nteach your mind a [ __ ]\nlesson next time you take a flight don't\ntake anything to\ndo just don't take anything to\ndo what am I going to do nothing there's\nnothing to do I I understand they have\nsome very high quality magazines in the\nseat pocket in front of you some really\njust topnotch\nliterary production there just really\naward-winning stuff\nman you\nknow what's going to\nhappen nothing nothing is gon to happen\nyou'll\nsurvive you'll be\nbored right don't take your phone into\nthe\nbathroom all of these things what what\nwhat do you get from using your phone\nnot very much it costs you more than it\ngives you but our our mind is in control\nof us so all these things are\nhard so if you if you don't want to do\nsomething that you should do the\ninteresting answer is you just need one\nthing to fix this problem which is learn\nto be bored learn to not let your wants\ncontrol you and the most direct way to\nnot let your wants control use boredom I\nwant this so\nwhat\nright so I went through a practice where\nI gave up ice cream for 10 years ice\ncream was my favorite\nthing and by the way when we're talking\nabout real medit we'll get to this in a\nsecond you may say but Dr K 10 years oh\nmy God that's so long yeah that's right\nso if you really want to get good at\nthis stuff the time the time scales that\nwe're talking about for a lot of the\nspiritual stuff like finding your Dharma\nand stuff like that we're talking about\ndecades or even\nlifetimes if this is to be understood\nbut in our current Society we want\neverything to be done within days if not\nweeks we can't even wait a week for a\nshipment of something we need overnight\ndelivery right and the world is\naccommodating us making it easier and\neasier and easier to give into our wants\nand they love doing it by the\nway because the more that they can make\nit easy to give into your wants the more\nimpulsive your life will\nbe right you can they can capitalize on\nthe impulse I feel like buying something\nlet me just click a button and then\nit'll be bought easy oh thank God whoo\nthank God that they can have an impulse\nand we can get their money in that\namount of time I'm not saying capitalism\nis evil or anything I love overnight\ndelivery it's great love\nit I'm just saying let's understand what\nthe society is doing to us let's\nunderstand what technology is doing to\nus so in order to gain control of your\nwants you need two things one is\nmeditation the second is the tolerance\nof boredom once you learn to be bored\nnow just think about this for a second\nthink about the value of being bored if\nyou no longer have to retreat from\nboredom do you need to use your phone no\ndo you need to play a video game no do\nyou need to watch pornography\nno can you go to the library yes it's\nboring at the library Dr K oh my God\nit's so boring well boredom doesn't\nbother you anymore so ain't no thing\nyour life will be transformed with this\none very simple trick learn to be bored\nbe okay with being bored get very good\nat being bored and then eventually\nsomething cool will happen as you're\nbored your mind will finally come\ncrawling to you and it'll say please\ngive me something to do it's like all\nright son Let's Learn physics and your\nmind is like okay\nfine and then you will be in control of\nyour mind and it will not be in control\nof\nyou\nokay wait there's a difference between\nyou and your mind absolutely you are not\nyour mind\nmind right your mind is thoughts and\nemotions that's not you you are that\nwhich always experiences the\nfluctuations of your mind your mind\nchanges but you don't\nchange okay let's talk about a couple of\nother things so people are asking how to\nmeditate so last thing so we haven't\ntalked about mocha either so let's talk\nabout Moka and\nmeditation\nso as these people have\ndiscovered right so there's a lot of\nsuffering in the world can't find\nmeaning in life and even as we pursue\nthings like money or fame I already I I\nwon I checked all the\nboxes right none of this works it's not\nenough yes you are correct the yogis\nfigured out the same thing so at the\nvery beginning in the first phase of\nunhappiness in life the Mind seeks\nparticular things that it believes will\nmake it happy and why does it do that\nbecause they do make it happy for a\ntime so I think to myself oh my\nGod I'm alone and I love her I need her\nshe's the only one in the world for\nme I just want her to date me I wanted\nto say yes please and our mind wants\nthis thing I mean love this is what\neveryone talks about in the movies oh my\nGod and then the person says yes and\nit's\nbeautiful for 3 weeks and then I realize\noh my God this is a human being they are\nnot what I idealize them as and our\nminds are so stubborn that it can take\nus years to discover that this is a\ndifferent person from whom I thought\nthey were they continuously tell us hey\nI'm not who you think I am I'm not who\nyou think I am I'm not who you think I\nam\nand yet our mind goes on ignoring it\nignoring it ignoring it ignoring it\nsometimes we even get married and we\nhave kids and then we wake up one day\nand we realize holy [ __ ] this is not the\nperson that I thought they were so when\nsomeone tells you who they are pay\nattention so at the beginning we seek\nparticular things and we get some amount\nof happiness for some amount of time but\nit's never\nenough right we see this a lot with the\ncontent creators that we work with have\n100,000 subscribers oh my God go you\nyeah are you happy now no I need\n200,000 are you happy with 200,000 no\nthis person started they just came on\nthe scene and they've been streaming for\nsix months I've been streaming for two\nyears and they have 18 180,000 and I\nhave 200,000 I even have more than them\nbut I'm still\nunhappy so this is the problem with\nfulfilling desires and chasing your\nwants is that it's never enough it is\nthe nature of a want to be\ntemporary and the satisfaction of a want\nto be\ntemporary how long does the happiness\nfrom a the perfect wedding\nlast we have all these Bridezillas and\ngroom zillas now right I want this I\nwant this I want\nthis and even though you ruin all your\nrelationships and you go into debt to\nget your perfect wedding what happens a\nmonth later six months\nlater so wants are temporary\nand so the first stage is the Mind\nthinks okay I will satisfy this want\nthis is Gama\npleasure and then next stage is we start\nto realize that there's\nsecurity that okay it's not just about\nfulfilling my desires I need some way to\nsupport this life that I live I'm a\nhuman being I have needs these needs to\nbe these needs need to be met if the\nneeds are not met this will create\nstress so we seek pleasure and we try to\navoid pain this is where ARA comes in\nARA Is\nwealth so ARA protects us against the\nnegative things in life and lets us move\ntowards pleasure right so these two\nthings are tied and yet even if we have\nARA and we have GMA if we have pleasure\nand we have wealth we are not perfectly\nhappy and there are many people out\nthere who are very wealthy who are not\nperfectly\nhappy so this is where Dharma comes in\nnow we have to have a greater purpose we\nhave to be on this Earth for or\nsomething it's greater than me I need to\nmake the world a better place there's a\nlot of fulfillment that comes from that\ngreat and then sometimes we do all three\nof these things and we are still not\nhappy so we have people right so let's\ntake a quick\nlook does anyone else struggle to find\nmeaning in life I have great friends a\ngood solid job where I like my\nco-workers a good social life but I\nstruggle to find meaning I get so\nfocused in this train of thought that it\ndepresses me people sometimes say to\nfind happiness in the small Pleasures in\nlife I do get happiness from these\nthings love friends sex accomplishment\neven day-to-day activities like eating\nand running however I can't help but\nthink that these are just Evol\nevolutionary tricks and with no\nintrinsic meaning it's a really sad way\nto go through life but I can stop but I\ncan't stop thinking about it I think is\nwhat this person means to say right so\nthis is what happens to some of us as we\ndo everything that we're supposed to\ndo\nand then we even think about things like\nmaybe this is an evolutionary trick so\nlet's understand something if we really\nwant to understand Moka and the real\npurpose of life we have to understand\nthe bounds of different dimensions of\nthe self now I know that sentence makes\nno sense so let me explain\nit so when we talk about Evolution which\npart of us is subject to\nEvolution primarily our physical\nbody right so if we sort of think about\nlike where does evolution act Evolution\nacts on the physical body like this\ndesire for procreation hunger thirst all\nof these things are physical in nature\nnow we start to touch on the\npsychological realm through Evolution\nbut really like if we sort of think\nabout life like a bacterium right so we\ndon't know that a bacterium has thoughts\nor emotions maybe it does who\nknows but it certainly has that\nphysicality it has hunger it has thirst\nit has the desire to Pro procreate we\nhave those F plasmids baby M right for\nthose of you all that know\nmicrobiology so these fundamental things\nabout procreation and the propagation of\nlife live exist on a very basic level\nyou don't need to be human to have\nthose and so this is the problem is we\nare more than bacterium we have layers\nof self that transcend the Physical\nRealm we have layers of existence that\nare\nnon-physical so when we look at all of\nthese evolutionary things that were\ndriven towards h hunger thirst whatever\nwe can satisfy those but then only the\nbody will be\nsatisfied now we enter the mind and now\nwe have some animals that also have\nemotions and stuff like that right dogs\ncan get angry they can get sad they can\nget happy they can get excited they can\nbe\nloving and so we must also satisfy the\nmind okay so now we even look at\nthat right friends\naccomplishment these are satisfactions\nof the mind which part of us wants to be\naccomplished our mind does our ego does\nso we can go on satisfying all of those\nthings and if that is all that a human\nbeing was then we would be happy right\nit makes sense this simple logic if this\nwas sufficient for happiness this would\nmake us\nhappy and if you look at an animal right\nwe don't really know this maybe animals\nare unhappy but generally speaking if\nyou have a dog so I had three dogs\ngrowing up and they tend to be pretty\nhappy if you take care of their physical\nneeds and you take care of their\nemotional needs that's all they\nneed they don't have existential crisis\nthat we know\nof so now if we look at a human being\nwhat is different about a human\nbeing so animals have thoughts and\nemotions they have some degree of ego\nright they have their place in the pack\ntheir social\nhierarchies do humans have anything that\nanimals don't have now this is Up For\nDebate but we're going to just for the\nsake of Simplicity to try to answer this\nquestion we're going to say\nyes so the human being is a little bit\ndifferent because the human being has\nsomething that we call awareness and\nmaybe animals are somewhat aware too\nactually everything has some degree of\nawareness but we have more awareness\nthan animals let's say that and what is\nawareness so awareness is that Which\nexperiences everything\nelse so you have this part of you that\nis the essence of you and it's not your\nphysical body because your physical body\ncan change over time it does change over\ntime but you're always you you were you\nwhen you were Oney old you were you when\nyou were 15y old you're going to be you\nwhen you're 50 it's always you but the\nbody\nchanges the mind also changes happy one\nday sad the next day but what's what is\nyou you are that Which experiences you\nare just raw subjective experience the\none thing that separates you from\neverything else is that you have the\ncapacity to be aware of all of these\nthings and so this is where MOA comes\nbecause we can satisfy the body we can\nsatisfy the mind and it is not enough\nbecause there's a part of us that hasn't\nbeen satisfied does that make\nsense if we are only a physical\nDimension and we are only a mental\nDimension then fulfilling these two\nthings should make us perfectly content\nand we can see that roughly speaking\nwith\nanimals making some assumptions there\nwhich are arguable on a philosophical\nlevel on a scientific\nlevel so there must be something else\nbecause we're still not happy this is\nwhat the approach that the yogis\ntook and they're like why am I not happy\nyet what's going on I have everything\nright this is what happened with budda\nall of his physical needs are met he's\nloved he's\nrespected people are proud of him he's\nbeen\ngroomed so he has love he has\nrespect emotions are satisfied yet he\nwakes up one day and he's\nunhappy now we get to\nMoka so if you are someone who is in\nthis state where you have checked all\nthe boxes and you are still unhappy\nthere's only one thing left which is\nLiberation now if yall want to\nunderstand what Liberation is we're\ngoing to teach\nyou now the question is\nhow so this is what I want youall to\nunderstand you can exist outside of a\nsensation of body and outside of a\nsensation of\nmind so even know that you can trigger\nthis part of you so if you electric\nelectrically stimulate the\ntemporoparietal junction you will\ntrigger something called an outof body\nexperience we figured out\nneuroscientifically where the outof body\nexperience comes from so all this weird\nstuff that happens in in spirituality\nsome of it we figured out how to trigger\nso we figured out how to trigger\ntranscendental States this stuff that\nhappens in spirituality we figured out\nhow to do some of it with with things\nlike psilocybin and psychedelics\nstimulating The temporo prial Junction\nsometimes works for outof body\nexperience we figured out a couple of\nthese\nthings but if you really want to\nunderstand what the nature of Liberation\nand and true contentment and happiness\nis meditation is the path to do it maybe\nprayer there are other ways to do it but\nwe're going to talk about meditation\nbecause first of all that's the\ntradition I come from and secondly it is\nthe one that is the most stepwise where\nif you do a b and c the same thing will\nhappen if I drop an apple it'll fall if\nyou drop an apple it'll fall if anybody\ndrops an apple it'll fall because\ngravity is a uniformity of the\nearth and so in this way Consciousness\nis also a uniformity of all human beings\nso you can discover\nthis so there are a couple of steps to\nthis okay we'll teach\nyall so the first is that if we look at\nour attention the simplest way to\nexperience pure Consciousness is\nsomething\ncalled so this is very simple if I close\nmy eyes what happens to my other\nsenses so if I close my eyes my\nawareness the awareness that was being\nutilized by the eyes\nthen gets moved over to the other senses\nso if I'm listening to a piece of music\nand I close my eyes I will hear the\nmusic more intensely\nright and so then what happens is if I'm\nlet's say I'm getting a massage and then\nthere's I close my eyes and there's\ncomplete silence then I will feel the\nmassage more deeply so whichever sense\nwe get rid of the attention moves to the\nremaining\nsenses now what happens when we get rid\nof all five senses where does the\nattention go it has no object for Focus\nI'm not looking at anything I'm not\nseeing anything I'm not hearing anything\nI'm not tasting anything I'm not feeling\nanything all we are is attention and\nthen people will say okay so where does\nthe attention go the attention goes into\nthe\nmind right so we can be lost in thought\nfine but then eventually thoughts can\ncease too so thoughts have the capacity\nfor cessation and you know this because\nsometimes you zone out and you're not\nthinking about anything and you're just\nkind of you zone out right so there are\nperiods of time where our mind does not\nthink so sleep is a one a good example\nof this when we're not\ndreaming zoning\nout so this is why we start with prahara\nand then we do something called dharana\ndhana is the focusing of your attention\non a single\nthing so you all may notice this when\nyou meditate so let's say I do a\npractice called trataka SOA is fix fixed\nPoint gazing so what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to look at the tip of my\nnose okay so if I look at the tip of my\nnose and I keep looking at it eventually\nmy thoughts will cease at the very\nbeginning I'll have all kinds of\nthoughts but if i gaze at the tip of my\nnose and I keep looking keep looking\nkeep looking the thoughts will all stop\nand I will be fully focused on\nthat and then we enter into so what isan\nso our mind has a very simple principle\nwhich is that it will acclimatize to a\nstimulus so when I put my shirt on\nI feel the\nshirt but after a few moments I no\nlonger feel the shirt so the way that\nmeditation works is we push everything\nelse to the side and we focus on one\nthing and then eventually my mind Alim\nacclimatizes to that thing and I lose\nthat\nthing and then all I am is raw attention\nwithout an\nobject this is the first path to\nmeditation now when you enter this state\nof mind where all you are is attention\nwithout any objective focus it feels\ncool it is somewhat\nBlissful and as you spend more and more\ntime in this state you will no longer\nfeel dook dook will\ndisappear suffering will be\ngone right and this is where the mind\nwill Rebel with all kinds of things\nIt'll ask but what about this and what\nabout my job and what about this what\nabout this what about this what about\nthis I don't [ __ ] know I'm not saying\nthat look is designed to make your life\nfunction or meditation not designed to\nmake you function with whatever goals\nyour ego has that's not the purpose this\nis a fundamental of human beings it is\nnot like a construction that is designed\nto make your ego gratified this is what\nit\nis right if you eat something the hunger\ngoes away if you get a hug you feel\nloved that part is satisfied to satisfy\nthat which is left this is the way what\nare the Imp lications for your life you\ndecide if you want to know if you're\nhungry eat something if you're feeling\nlonely go get a hug if you're discontent\nwith life and you're filled with D do\nthis thing it'll go\naway what does that mean for life you\nfigure out bro I don't\nknow but this Bliss State cannot be\nconsidered pleasure it's not pleasure\nit's\nBliss okay this is not the same as\nwriting a roller coaster it's a\ndifferent experience it's just attention\nwithout\nFocus just pure un raw\nattention and the the interesting thing\nis that if y'all really want to learn\nhow to do this this is not like an\neight-week thing so I'm going to walk\ny'all through an advanced meditation\npractice and just to give you all a\nsense of like how long it took me to do\nthis I would say somewhere probably\nbetween 3 and 20\nyears I will explain what 20 years of\nmeditation actually gets you okay and\nthis is where if youall say like but I\nneed it tomorrow well good\nluck right so it's like the body ages at\nthe rate that it ages you can't speed up\npuberty like that's just the scale at\nwhich stuff\nhappens and the scale at which the\nmeditative stuff happens if you really\nwant Mora moves incredibly\nslowly with very little gain along the\nway so this is what's so powerful about\nthis stuff is see when the Mind expects\na gain that's when you run into problems\nthat's when it's very hard to be\ndisciplined because if if the expected\ngain is like high and you don't get it\nit actually destroys your motivation\nbecause I didn't get what I was\ninvesting in I've been buying this chick\nflowers for so many days in order to get\nlaid how many how many times do I need\nto take this person out on a date not\nchick dude whatever\nI've been koi with this person and\ntrying to get this person to break up\nwith their girlfriend and start dating\nme for so\nlong when do I get what I want that's\nI'm sorry the spiritual scale is\nincredibly\nlong and there's a beauty to that it's\nlike it's awesome once you understand\nI'll try to explain it because here's\nthe thing if there is an expected gain\nthen mind enters the\npicture because if you meditating for\nsomething then your mind will want it\nand then once it gets it it says ah\nthank God but to completely get rid of\nmind because that's what we're trying to\ndo you have to operate on a scale where\nthe mind is just completely\ngone you have to do something for no\npoint over and over and over again and\nthat is when you will\ndiscover I don't know if that makes any\nsense to y'all because it's weird\nbecause as long as there's an expected\ngain the mind will motivate you towards\nit and if it doesn't get the gain it'll\nmotivate you away from it and even if it\ndoes get the gain it'll want more next\ntime if you have if if I'm meditating\nfor a transcendental experience this is\ninteresting so the the first\ntranscendental experience in meditation\nis the is easy the second transcendental\nmedit experience in meditation is the\nhardest because the first time you ever\na transcendental experience there's no\nexpectation of the Mind the mind is out\nof the way and once it's out of the way\nthen you can trans it very easily but\nthe moment that you have a\ntranscendental experience the Mind wants\nagain holy crap that was so cool let's\ndo it again and then it sits down and it\nhas that expectation and with that\nexpectation the Mind remains active when\nthe mind is is active you can't\ntranscend it the whole reason you had\nthe first one in the first place is\nbecause the mind was not\nthere so the second one is the\nhardest and the cool thing is that we\nwant to transcend mind completely so it\noperates at a scale where unless you are\ndisciplined enough the mind will give up\nwhich is good because that's the only\nway it\nworks so now we're going to teach yall\nlike just I'm going to give yall a\npractice and this is a practice to be\ndone for a\ndecade ideally twice a day for 20\nminutes for a decade and then if it\ndoesn't work y'all can come back and say\nhey Dr K you're full of PS okay fine do\nit for a decade 20 days every single uh\n20 minutes twice a day for 10 years this\nis the the scale at which meditation\ntruly\noperates om\nchanting if you do for a decade I'll\nwalk you through what\nhappens so when we first chant oh we're\ngoing to teach yall very\nsimply so oh is just from a fully open\nmouth to a fully closed mouth and we're\nexhaling in that vein that's it\nokay\nah\n[Music]\ndo it with\nme\n[Laughter]\n[Music]\na\nah\n[Music]\neasy right so now we get to the subtlety\nof it when you really want to learn om\nchanting we're going to use this we're\ngoing to talk about the phases there are\nso many levels to om\nchanting and we'll understand what they\nare so I will give yall an\nexample okay so when we do om\nchanting okay so in the first phase of\nom chanting we are just doing the\npractice so you're chanting for about 20\nminutes you have to chant for 20 minutes\nyou can do like yoga and Nishi and stuff\nlike that so I'd say suya\nnamaskar for five minutes Nar should\nthe for five minutes and\nthen oh\nchanting for about 10 minutes twice a\nday for 10 years so in Phase number one\nwe're just doing it we're just making\nthe\nsound phase two pay attention to\nvibration so what you will notice is a\nvibration in your body and this is where\nit's useful to\nmaximize the\nvibration so I'll give you all an\nexample Okay\n[Music]\nso\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nah okay maximize the vibration and what\nwe want to do is feel the\nvibration in your\nbody we're focusing on feeling not sound\nstep number three\nnotice the\nlocalization of\nvibration okay so what you will notice\nis when I say A I'm going to give you\nall the answers now but if you don't you\nhave to discover this on your own but\nwell just to illustrate one technique\nokay ah so when you chant ah you will\nnotice the vibration is maximal around\nyour\nnavl in uh the the vibration is between\nthe throat and the chest and then in the\nvibration is going to be somewhere\nbetween your chin and the top of your\nhead so as you chant oh you will notice\nan ascending vibration that starts at\nyour Naval and goes all the way to the\ntop and so when we're meditating we're\nnot just chanting anymore we are\nfocusing on the movement of\nvibration I guess this is step four\nright so first you notice it in the\nthree areas and then this is why it\ntakes so long because you need the\nability to detect the\ndifferences and then you will notice it\ntraveling up so each ohm chanting is\nlike a Vib vibrational energy that is\nascending in your your body now you will\nnotice all kinds of interesting\nthings so now what we want to do is you\nwill notice that this vibration is\nlurchy or not smooth\nthis is a natural thing that you'll\ndiscover it'll feel off at some point\nyou're like I'm not this doesn't feel\nright in the same way that when you sit\nuncomfortably in a chair the chair feels\nuncomfortable the mm vibration will feel\noff now we get to the hard stuff this\nstuff may take a couple months but it's\nhonestly easy\nsauce so now we have to make the perfect\nvibration this is very difficult to do\nto chant oh in a way where each part of\nthe ohm the vibratory so you're not\ngoing to be able to hear it you can\nprobably hear it too but it's hard to do\non the hearing level to feel the ascent\nof the vibration to be smooth and\nwithout a jerk so I'll give you all just\none example of something that will mess\nup your own vibration which is a locked\njaw so when I chant oh now I want youall\nto pay attention so I want youall to pay\nattention to your jaw when you go from\nah you'll notice that at some point you\ngo\nfrom you'll notice a a shift in the\nLocking of your jaw you move modally\nfrom one movement to another movement to\nmake that smooth is possible but is\n[Music]\ndifficult and then what you will notice\nis to avoid the locked jaw you require\nrelaxation of the jaw so now I'm\nchanting but all of my attention is in\nrelaxation of the jaw to avoid that\nbump okay there's more we haven't even\ngot into the fun stuff yet okay so now\nwe make a perfect vibration from bottom\nto top this will take probably months if\nnot years of practice to be able to do\nlet's say months I think this is still\nmonths all right so now we have a\nperfect vibration and then we get to the\nfun\nstuff so then what we do is decrease the\nvolume and\nvibration so once we have tuned oursel\nto the perfect ohm we start to slowly\ndecrease the vibration and the way that\nthis works is as you do this vibration\nyou will start to notice something else\nso you paid attention to the locked jaw\nyou have an even amount of breath with A\nand M so that's another goal so when\nwe're talking about the perfect\nvibration locked Jaws\none even\nseconds of a u and M and then even\nbeyond that we have\n5.2 which is the right level of\nSilence\nbetween\nrounds you will know what the right\nlevel of silence is you have to find the\nright level of silence and then\nsomething cool will happen so this may\nbe around the time that you get your\nfirst weird spiritual experience so in\nmy case for example after I was done\nwith the practice I'll just share this\ntoday just to give you all an example I\nnoticed a pair of\neyes so I had my eyes closed and I\nnoticed a pair of eyes floating to the\nsurface that were looking back at me so\nwhen you close your eyes you have like a\nscreen in front of you okay\nand then what I noticed is that there's\nlike a pair of eyes that are like\nlooking at me and I had never seen it\nbefore and it freaked me the [ __ ] out\nand I was like oh okay this is what\npeople are talking\nabout right so like they're looking back\nI'm doing something and something is\nnoticing and is looking at\nme then what\nhappens is we will decrease so you'll\nnotice these weird things as you do this\nyou will you will sort of find the\nperfect VI and then you will start to\nfeel something\nelse and then what happens is you will\nnotice that there's something else that\nyou're\nfeeling there's another Sensation that\nis not vibratory which if the human body\nis like this let's say I'm sitting\ncross-legged okay and I'm in a\nmeditative posture so the vibration goes\nup like this but then what you'll start\nto notice is that there is like this\ncolumn within you and the column is like\nit's just a\nfeeling and then what happens is in\norder to enhance the sensation of the\ncolumn in order to be able to detect the\ncolumn you will notice that the\nvibration interferes with your ability\nto detect the column and so then what\nhappens is you need to make the\nvibration smaller and smaller and\nsmaller and smaller and then as you\nnotice that this vibration becomes\nsmallest so then we're going to chant oh\nvery\nquietly then you will notice the column\nmore more and more and more and you will\nstart to observe a nonphysical\nstructure this is\nsushumna this is the channel through\nwhich your Kundalini Shakti\nRises and then you will get to the phase\nwe're going to stop there but then\neventually what'll start to happen is\nwithin sushumna you will notice an\nupward energy but it is not physical it\nis not\nvibration the other thing that'll happen\nis when we meditate let's say I'm\nsitting like\nthis my arms are like this okay what you\nwill notice is that the vibration that\nyou feel starts at the front of your\nbody but as you practice more it'll move\ntowards the back and the quieter that\nyou you'll also notice that Su sushumna\nis back\nhere there's something posterior to the\nvibration the vibration will be at the\nvery front of your\nbody so sushumna is posterior and the\nmore quiet you become with your om\nchanting the more you will detect Suna\nin the\nback and then you will notice the upward\nmovement\nthere and this will take at least I\nwould say between one and three years at\nleast if you do this practice\nonly and then along the way stuff will\nhappen you will see things in the chash\n100% actually I don't know if it's 100%\nI'm I'm confident that this will happen\nI don't think I'm unique but this is the\nlevel of meditation that no one talks to\nyou about people don't and then the the\nother problem is that the people who do\ntalk about it are not trained in science\nso they I think they have difficulty\nlike breaking it\ndown right so maybe they're good at it\nbut this this is what I've seen so like\nwhen I read texts about the esoteric\nforms of meditation people don't break\nit down into these stages and stuff like\nthat I I just haven't seen that maybe\nsomeone's doing\nit how does this relate to Kundalini\nthis is the discovery of Kundalini over\nthis is the opening door and this is the\nbeginning and the end of Kundalini\nYoga it is a bit scary it's not a bit\nscary it's very scary this will\ncompletely change the way that you live\nyour life because you will discover so I\ndon't know if this makes sense so we're\ngoing to leave one last thing which is\ngoing to be the\ncraziest and if yall disagree with me\nplease let me know because I've been\ntalking about this for inquiring about\nthis so about a year ago\nI had some weird experiences in\nmeditation and then I started asking my\nfriends who are neuroscientists\npsychiatrists do we have proof of the\nexistence of\nthought and to date I haven't had anyone\ngive me a convincing answer as to\nyes right so when I asked my friends who\nare like neuroscientists these are\npeople like researchers at Harvard\nMedical School right so they're like\nthey kind of know what they're talking\nabout and like we all kind of agree that\nwe don't we don't really have proof we\nhave implications of thought so we can\neven measure thought but we have no\nproof of its\nexistence so we have what is the proof\nthings like EEG this is electrical\nactivity it's electrical stimuluses\nstimuli we have things like fmri which\nis blood flow to different parts of the\nbrain pet pet scans right this is the\nactivation of different water molecules\nso we have have all these physical\nthings and then we correlate them with\nthought so what we do is we do an EEG\nand then we ask someone what are you\nthinking what are you feeling right so\nhow do we know that the amydala is where\nour negative emotions come from because\nwe'll ask people we do brain scan we see\noh there's activity in the amydala what\nare you feeling you're feeling fear okay\ncool we know that this is where fear\ncomes from but there is a subjective\nlevel of experience there is a\nsubjectivity to you which cannot be\nmeasured in a physical form and now we\nrun into a very big problem because if\nwe look at science science has no way to\nmeasure thoughts right we have no\nthought detecting device we can measure\nsome things that correlate with thought\nbut the reason that we know that\nthoughts exist we actually don't know\nthat they exist it's just a delusion\nthat the entire human race shares and\nthere are people who are like you know\nhard biologists in terms of Neuroscience\nwho think that this thing doesn't\nactually exist it literally is a shared\ndelusion it doesn't exist and in the\nphysical sense it doesn't\nexist so then something interesting\nhappened is once science failed to\ndetect thought we started to develop all\nof this instrumentation in the physical\nworld but we stopped exploring thought\nwe all of our scientific exploration is\nin the physical\nDimension right let like fmri and EEG we\ncan detect energy and we can detect\nmatter this is all we can\ndetect so then the question it's really\ninteresting the question is okay what\nabout the subjective stuff what about\nthe subjective\nexperience we can't explore that\nscientifically not\nyet and so we stopped exploring it but\nwhat happens when you start exploring it\nso you have to be the one who explores\nit a scientist can't do it for you you\ncan apply the scientific method to\ninternal subjective\nexperiences and this is what happens in\nmeditation people are saying what does\nthis have to do with Kundalini this is\nthe way that Kundalini was discovered\nand so when we're talking about MSHA it\nis operating at this\nlevel So eventually what is MOA so what\nis the point of meaning of life it\ndoesn't have a meaning actually this is\nthe most important discovery which is no\nnot a problem see we only think that\nlike finding the meaning of life is only\na problem if you're operating in the\nmind like oh my God what am I doing like\nwhat the [ __ ] you know imagine that you\nexisted only for a day\nright life just is meaning is something\nthat the human mind attaches to\nit meaning is like when we look up at a\ncloud in the sky and we see that this is\na dog or this is a piece of popcorn\nright this is something that a mind is\nattaching the cloud is just the cloud\nlife is just life it just is a rock is\njust a rock there's no good rock or bad\nrock is the meaning that that we attach\nthe mind the Mind needs meaning and the\nproblem is that we are so operating\nWithin in mind because all of this\ntechnology all of this externalizing\nstuff is all feeding the mind it's all\nmental in\nnature emotions thoughts this is the\nworld that we live in logic reasoning\nthis all\nmental but there's a layer of existence\nthat ex that is beyond mind or outside\nof mind which is just pure Consciousness\nattention and when you start exploring\nthis you will start to be content this\nis what leads to Suk Anand\nMOA and when you realize that that is\nactually the truest form of reality and\nthat the rest of the stuff is less\nreal that's when you are done you're\ndone with the cycle of Liberation and\nwhatnot now the\nproblem is that when we're talking about\nthings like this and this is a great\npost by the way I I didn't mean to bash\nthis person at\nall\nso I don't believe in it and I'm not\nenlightened enough to encounter the\nalleged evidence of it okay fine right\nso this is this is a born of logic this\nis\nlogical but then like the whole point is\nthat once we once you start operating at\nthis level like once you experience this\nConsciousness it's amazing\nhow suffering in life starts to Slough\noff it just starts\nsublimating and I I I mean like we see\nthis right we see the scientific\nevidence of this that people who\nmeditate are more content with life we\ncan literally measure their quality\nquity of life and their quality of life\nimproves even though the circumstances\nof their life don't improve at\nall there's studies that show that you\ndon't make if you do an 8-week\nmeditation study it's not like this\nperson makes $10,000 more at the end of\neight weeks but their quality of life is\nbetter their health hasn't substantially\nchanged their relationship there's been\nno change in their life the external\nlife looks exactly the same the internal\nlife is different and the quality of\nlife\nimproves and so this is what MO is and\nif you guys really really want to go\nthere go\nthere but you're not going to get there\nin 8 weeks you're not going to get there\nin eight\nmonths I've been doing this [ __ ] for 20\nyears and when I started out I wanted\nsome kind of like General Advantage\nfine right I wanted to be able to study\nbetter I was a\nskeptic I'm still a skeptic but then\nthere are some experiences that you have\nwhich change your understanding of\nthings that's how life is I didn't\nbelieve in love until I fell in love\nthat's just how it\nworks and a thousand people who have\nnever been in love you can't convince\nthem that love exists until they\nexperience it so now yall are really\nonly left with one question which is\nwhat are you willing to try to\nexperience it and for you to understand\nthe time scale of these things is\nlong right it's very long especially\nwith our conditioning and this is the\nother problem that we run into if you\nlook at all these meditative\npractices what you'll find is that these\npeople have very rigorous Lifestyles why\nwhy are they vegetarian why are they\ncelibate they even control the nature of\nviolence in their mind you don't think\nnegative thoughts right you train your\nmind to not even think negatively about\nsomeone\nelse why do they avoid all psychoactive\nsubstances not only all psychoactive\nsubstances they have very specific diet\nit's not just vegetarian where you're\neating this highly processed PE protein\nwhatever the [ __ ]\nthey're eating very specific foods low\namounts of\ngrains because they've sort of\ndiscovered they've discovered all the\nstuff about gut microbiome because in\norder to attain these states of mind you\nneed a mind that operates at a very\nspecific way biologically you need a\nvery specific pH right so a lot of these\npractices so there are some practices\nthat I've done that you take one breath\nevery 6 to 8 minutes other practices you\ntake 200 40 breaths a\nminute what's going on here it's\nchanging our respir we're inducing\nrespiratory acidosis and respiratory\nalkalosis when we induce respiratory\nacidosis and respiratory alkalosis it\nchanges the function of our\nbrain and then they eat very specific\nthings and I'm telling you when you all\nstart operating at this level you will\nnever feel\nsushumna if you are not have the right\ndiet so then what happens is we get to\nthe phase of like you know when people\nare talking about bodybuilding right so\nif I'm if I'm\nlifting minimum\nrequirement to lift properly as people\nwill say is one gram of protein per kg\nor pound of body weight depending on who\nyou talk to and to them it is no it's\nit's silly to try to work out unless\nyou're going to have this diet because\nin order to support this physiological\ngrowth you need a certain\nnutrient\nsimple right you can't be eating\nprocessed food in 5,000 calories and\nexpect the bodybuilding to work properly\nlow carb high protein this is what you\nneed the meditators were the same they\nsort of figured out the same thing\nwhat's the\nequivalent of one gram of protein per kg\nor pound of body weight it's all the\nmeditative diet this is why they eat\nwhat they do in monasteries Because\nunless you do it it just you won't get\nthere you can do all the same effort you\ncan take two people they work out the\nsame amount they both work out six hours\na week one of them eats their protein\nrequirement one of them doesn't the\nresult that the two get will be\ndrastically different this is the other\nthing that we do not understand about\nmeditation everyone who's like talking\nabout meditation they don't adhere to\nthe diet they don't adhere to an\nabstinence of psychoactive\nsubstances and it's even things like\nthey'll avoid potatoes eggplant and\ntomatoes\ngarlic onions these things you won't\nfeel sushumna as\neasily right so if you want to detect\nall this stuff if yall really want to\nunderstand what MOA is this is the way\nto do it it's been described right and\nit works and it's cool the thing is it\nrequires a level of dedication and focus\nthat like most of us don't have our mind\nis not happy with that it's like what\nwhat am I going to what but what about\nall the [ __ ] that I care about I mean\nthis is where I like just think about it\nfor a this silly you can meditate for 20\nminutes twice a day for the rest of your\nlife without impacting any part of your\nlife you can have the same career that\nyou have now you can have the same\nrelationships that you can have now you\ncan have the same degree of degeneracy\nthat you have now you can play spend all\ndays playing video games you can do all\nthat I do not buy that you do not have\n40 minutes of the day that you can carve\nout every single day for the rest of\nyour\nlife you can do\nit and then the question becomes well\nwhy should I that's for you to\ndecide right so you have to decide do\nyou want to experience the Ultimate\nReality right I make it sound so\ngrandiose and if you do then work for it\nand if you don't then that's\nokay and also do you want to let your\nwants control what you do and this is\nthe real value of it this is why it's so\nop because you set a target for yourself\nyou make a\ncommitment and then you start to follow\nalong and then the rest of life becomes\neasy because compared to that can you\nimagine how hard it would be to to do 20\nminutes of practice twice a day for\nseven years with no\nbenefit what will your willpower have to\nbecome in order to do\nthat all kinds of benefits will come\nalong the way but they're not the\npurpose\nthey're actually distractions so as you\nstart to walk this path there's also a\ndescription of\nSidis psychic powers the ability to read\nthoughts time travel and all this other\nkind of\nstuff these are all\ndistractions that's what they say and\nonce you start walking the path you'll\nunderstand questions before we wrap up\nfor the\nday\nso Jackie in here is saying what special\nthing happened to you after you asked\nyour colleagues about the proof of\nthought so that's like after you saw the\neyes so two\nthings one is the proof of thoughts and\nI was just curious right because the\nmore I thought about it I was like do we\nhave proof of thoughts that's a little\nbit separate so I and the second thing\nis I'm not going to say more and the\nreason is because saying more is going\nto be an Eng engagement of the Mind\nyou'll create I'll create curiosity and\nexpectation and that's going to hurt you\nin the long it would be harmful to tell\nyou the other thing is it'll diminish my\nown power so one of the things that I\nfound is that the more I talk about my\nspiritual practice the less potent it\nbecomes even disclosing this one\nexperience I'm going to be paying for\nfor the next three months that's all I'm\nwilling to\npay so your mind is curious fine but\nwhat what let's just play the tape\nthrough the end let's say oh my God I\nknow I saw this and I saw this and I saw\nthis what's that going to do to you\nyou're going to get so excited the mind\nwill get excited oh my God let me do it\nthis sounds cool I want to experience\nthat but now I've created a curiosity in\nthe mind that Curiosity won't last it'll\nbe harmful in the long\nrun second thing is people will become\nmore skeptical which in a sense is fine\nright what is this guy talking about\nthis guy is crazy okay fine but it\ndoesn't help\nanyone see the more I talk it up the\nmore it creates false expectations for\nsome people creates skepticism what's my\ngoal here my goal is for y'all to\nmeditate you just do this thing for\nyourself and it's not to experience the\nUltimate Reality we're talking about\nevidence-based stuff right be less\nanxious have a little bit more willpower\nstrengthen your frontales I don't want\nto do anything to sabotage that even to\nsatisfy curiosity the most dangerous\nInsidious thing is that'll grow my ego\nbecause anytime I say something I did\nthis\nit grows the ego that's I have to I have\nto deal with that\nlater so this like meditators don't this\nis the problem right is like meditators\ndon't we don't talk about these\nexperiences and for good reason and when\nyou meet another real meditator you will\nknow they will know you guys can\ntell you know when someone is\nspiritually developed you learn how to\ndetect it and they can see it in you\nthat's enough\nwill you see benefits Abs from\nmeditating 20 minutes a day if you don't\nabide by the yogic diet absolutely so\nthis is the cool thing right so if we\ntalk about the scientific benefits of\nmeditation no one is controlling diet in\nthese studies people are eating whatever\nthe hell they want so you'll get the\nscientific benefits it's the spiritual\nstuff that we have no studies\nabout so you'll get reductions in\ndepression or anxiety improvements in\nquality of life all that kind of stuff\nyou'll get so that's why like I feel\ncomfortable you know saying this is fine\nto do you can meditate for 20 20 minutes\na\nday why should I do this meditation or\nshould I do a different one see you\nguys are kind of missing the\npoint so like the mind is looking for\nthe optimal and so someone is saying\nokay should I do a different one well\nwhy would you do well what if one's\nbetter what does better mean well better\nmeans that I'll I'll get some spiritual\nexperience in a years instead of 10\nyou're still giving into the mind you're\ngiving into the mind you're giving into\nthe mind you want efficiency you want\noptimization the Mind wants to optimize\neverything it wants to put in the least\namount of effort for the most amount of\ngain and that optimization is great when\nwe're talking about the material\nworld how do I start though we've\nalready told you\nchantone we've even given you the steps\nthat once you do one step we've given\nyou the next couple of steps this is the\nother cool thing is that once yall do\nthis for a while you'll learn that\npeople will help you\nout your karma will support\nyou is it not with withholding from\npeople you love to not share this no\nit's not\nwithholding not at\nall no am I not sharing something sure\ndo if you want to classify it as\nwithholding sure but it's like it it's\nnot I'm not depriving you if you want to\ncall withholding fine I I don't think\nI'm depriving anyone of\nanything right so it's kind of like am I\nif my kids want to eat candy all day and\nI love them am I withholding by not\ngiving them candy even though I have a\nbank account that has $1,000 because I\ncan buy them as much candy as they want\nis that withholding sure is it depriving\nno what do you mean your karma will\nsupport you so what happens is once you\nstart walking this path like literally\npeople will come out of the woodwork and\nthey will help you on your journey once\nyou demonstrate the\ndedication people will come and you will\nfind\nOpportunities around you\nyou'll run into people you'll get\ninvited and the only thing you need to\ndo is once you start meditating\nregularly pay attention to the signs so\nif you have opportunities take\nthem there are many paths there are\nthousand paths million paths you don't\nhave to chant oh om is just the\nsimplest\nokay what if you feel anxious for people\nto see you chanting oh even though you\nknow you shouldn't so then the question\nyou decide what if what if you feel\nanxious okay so what are you going to\ndo you going to do it or you going to\nnot not do it but I feel anxious okay\nwhat's the consequence of feeling\nanxious you feel anxious\nso you have to decide are you going to\navoid things that make you feel anxious\nbut it's difficult and it hurts\nfine can you do things that are painful\nif you want to practice doing things\nthat are painful do yourself a\nfavor whatever food you would eat eat\nsomething that is less tasty you can\njust level that up\ntoo right you just level it\nup so if you would add let's say 10 gram\nof salt to whatever you're eating at\n8 learn to tolerate\ndiscomfort okay do you believe\nmeditation Retreats help get through the\nmind more efficiently depends on the\nretreat see I think there's there's a\nbig problem in in the meditative\ntradition today which is that the\nmajority of teachers we have who teach\nmeditation and you can even make the\nargument about me are not good at it\nso let's understand historically what\nwas required to become a meditation\nteacher the Zen tradition required 30\nyears to become a meditation teacher to\nbecome a master and you don't teach\nuntil you're a master right because\nteaching something halfway you can do\nmore harm than good so teaching should\nbe done by Masters and in the Zen\ntradition it takes 30 years so if we\nlook at something like the Hindu\ntradition you had this class of people\nthis cast right I'm not saying right or\nwrong about the cast it's just how it\nwas\nof brahans and Brahman started learning\nmeditation around the age of four or\nfive and they grew up with it in the\nhousehold it was a family job that you\ninherited and before you when you're\naround maybe 24 25 you can go out on\nyour own and you can be your own Brahman\nbut you've been you've been practicing\nmeditation for 20\nyears these are who the meditation\nteachers used to be and even then\nBrahman aren't Med actually technically\nBrahman even that's insufficient\ntechnically the real meditation teachers\nwere\nswamis and that also is like it's like a\n20-year training see now what's happened\nthe reason that meditation is so\nmisunderstood and people don't really\nbenefit from it on a spiritual aspect is\nbecause in order to become a meditation\nteacher what do you\nneed nowadays everybody wants a\ncertification I'm a certified meditation\nteacher this is kind of funny so I was\ninvited to speak at a conference and\nsomeone asked so the people at the\nconference were asking me like you know\nwhat certifications do you have in\nmeditation I was like I don't have any\nI've got a medical degree but I'm not no\none gave me a piece of paper right they\ndon't do that in the\nIMs so now what started to happen is\nthis is absurd you take a meditation\ncourse and at the end of let's say six\nmonths because these things aren't\ndecades right cuz who's got time for\nthat no one says by the way you've not\nspiritually grown enough the dedication\nof your practice has been insufficient\nor your karma has been insufficient to\nwhere you are not allowed to teach this\nyou haven't you sure you do the\npractices but you haven't you haven't\nattained enough in spirituality to be\nable to teach no one says this so you\nhave people who are certified and what\ndo you have to do to be certified show\nup you don't actually have to attain\nanything right so think about it this\nway why are there so many meditation\nteachers who don't cannot teach\nspiritually on the spiritual level many\npeople can teach from like a you know\nmbsr or whatever I'm not saying that\nthat's bad talking about\nspiritually so imagine\nthat we had people who taught how to\nplay video games so take your favorite\nvideo game valerant or whatever right\nand then you've got to rank and in order\nto teach do you have to attain a\nparticular rank to teach no you just\nhave to attend class and ceue up for 80\nmatches and if you attend class and you\nqueue up for 80 matches whether you win\nor you lose we're going to certify you\nas a valerant teacher and then you can\ngo out and you teach\npeople this is how we teach meditation\nthere's no indicator of quality or\ncompetence there's just\ncompletion okay and I'm not saying that\nthere aren't good meditation teachers\nthere can be lot everyone's teaching to\nthe best of their capacity myself\nincluded I'm not some enlightened Master\nby the way so maybe I'm doing it wrong\nI'm certainly doing it wrong almost\ncertainly so I fall into this but this\nis what's happened is we've adopted this\nwestern style of teaching which is that\nyou pay money you go through a course\nand then we're going to give you we're\ngoing to slap you with a label we're not\ngoing to because how do you measure\ncompetence in\nmeditation right because at the end of\nthat you imagine what would happen if\nsomeone was like yeah you don't get you\ndon't get to graduate but I already paid\nthe 3,000 do I get a refund I don't know\nit's not how it works we've adopted this\nWestern system and the Western system is\nfine when we're looking for physiologic\nchanges right because then you just do\nthe practices and there's no need for\nspiritual\ngrowth that's just how it is it's you\nknow so like I I think this is where\nthere's a lot of misunderstanding about\nmeditation and people think they\nunderstand it which is another thing\nthat the Mind does loves to think it\nunderstands something because it\nunderstands it to the best of its\nability but the mind is not good at\ndetecting its own\nignorance that's why dun and Krueger\nexists what is my karma we'll see but it\nain't going to be pretty from here on\nout let me tell you\nwhat\nah\nyeah we'll see\num okay so thanks a lot y'all and we\nwill see y'all I don't know when we're\nstreaming\nnext but I hope y'all are doing\nwell\num\nuh\nokay um\nyeah so just before we wrap up just a\ncouple of announcements so reminder that\nwe have our book which is on sale so\nit's 25% off on Barnes & Noble how to\nraise a healthy gamer so if y'all are\ninterested in learning a little bit\nabout so if you guys have parents that\nyou want to communicate better with you\ncan get them this book if youall have\nyoung kids we teach a lot about\ntechnology addiction and Neuroscience\nand the last thing is if you have loved\nones who are struggling with things like\ngaming addiction and you want to have\nconversations with them this book can\ndefinitely help with that on the outside\nedge if youall want to learn about our\nbasic approach to communication but in a\ndifferent context the book can\nabsolutely be helpful so if you want to\nlearn how to connect with other people\nthere's a lot of very good techniques in\nthere that you you'all can\nlearn so I hope that today has been\nhelpful to y'all I recognize that things\nwere a little bit different a little bit\nmore unfiltered a little bit less\nscientific and I encourage you all to\njust take what we shared with a grain of\nsalt right because who am I I'm not I'm\nno Arbiter of Truth I've tried to\ninclude science where it's relevant but\nif youall really want to understand\nthese Eastern Concepts we have to adopt\nan Eastern\nperspective there's a whole context\nright you can't take something out of\ncontext and then you know like based\nwhat does based mean well it depends on\nthe\ncontext right based means something\nwithin this\nlanguage um and so I encourage you to\nexplore on your own and the one that I\nlike the most sort of being a skeptic is\nthat like you know I don't have to have\nfaith in this stuff I just had to have\nfaith in my teachers to a certain degree\nto try it\nmyself but I encourage you allall to try\nthis\nstuff and consider some of these\nperspectives around okay what is the\nnature of Happiness right where what is\nthe nature of suffering explore this\ndon't take someone's word for it look at\nyour own life look at what causes your\nsuffering what doesn't cause your\nsuffering even when you alleviate your\nsuffering how long does it alleviate for\nand is there any way to permanently\nalleviate some kind of\nsuffering and the more that you explore\nthis\nstuff I think that there's been a\nconsistent Discovery by many many\ndifferent people that when they walk\nthis path they we basically find\nsomething very\nsimilar but even if you don't find\nsomething similar if you find something\ndrastically different that is awesome\nbecause that means that there's a\ndifferent perspective from everybody\nelse who's come before you right not\neveryone I'm sure that people found\ndifferent things but\num and so give it a shot so I I come\nhere to share my perspective on things\nand that's what people ask for so that's\nwhat we're going to do my hope is it's\nhelpful but I'm not saying I'm right and\nreally even if I think I'm right like I\ndon't know your life I don't know your\ncircumstances I don't know what happens\nin your mind so the best that I can do\nis to try to offer you a road map that\nyou have to test for\nyourself all right we'll see yall when\nwe see you take care"
