    "transcript": "I think the main thing to understand is\nthat the happiness that comes from\nsecurity is what money buys absolutely\nyes the challenge is that for a long\ntime when we're unhappy we believe and\nthis is true right that like more money\nand more stuff will make us happy like\noh I want a I want to buy this game and\nI can't afford the game and then I get\nthe game and now I have the game and now\nI'm happy so our whole life we actually\nlearn that getting stuff will make us\nhappy but the problem is all of the\nhappiness of those things is temporary\nand never end until you learn how to\nappreciate what you have you can have\none piece of jewelry and then you can\nstill like appreciate it on on a daily\nbasis but that requires like a\ncultivation of appreciation appreciating\nwhat you have as opposed to chasing\nsomething else and appreciating what you\nhave that's just eventually learned no\nyou have to learn it you have to learn\nit I mean I think the people who are\nlucky eventually learn it but I think\nthe sad thing is that a lot of people\ndon't learn that though right they don't\nyeah"
