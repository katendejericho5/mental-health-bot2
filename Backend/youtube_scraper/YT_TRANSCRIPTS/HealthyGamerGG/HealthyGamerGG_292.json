    "transcript": "you're the hardest worker when it comes\nto other people but you can't do\nanything for yourself when there's a\nhard job to be done you're going to\nvolunteer when there's overtime you're\ngoing to do it when someone needs\nsomeone to do something you can do it\nbut when you need to do something for\nyourself you can't so there's a couple\nof core things here the first the core\nreason why we do this is because we\nvalue other people over ourselves this\nis the root of the problem because if\nsomeone else needs a sacrifice you're\nwilling to make it for them but you're\nnot willing to make a sacrifice for you\nlet's understand that it's very simple\nother people are worth more than you are\nit's not rocket science oh someone else\nis sick and they need like freshly\ncooked food like okay I can make it for\nthem but if I'm sick eh I'll order to\ntake out like maybe you're sick and\nyou're not you know you're low energy so\nmaybe not the best example but the core\nreason that we're willing to bend over\nbackwards for other people and do\nnothing for ourselves is because we\nvalue other people more than we value\nourselves"
