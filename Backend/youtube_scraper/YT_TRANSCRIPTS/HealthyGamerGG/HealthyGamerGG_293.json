    "transcript": "hey y'all today we're going to talk\nabout breaking the cycle of\ndepression now the trickiest thing about\ndepression as a clinician dealing with\nit is that one problem leads to another\nproblem depression is almost like the\nHIV aids of mental illness because it\nattacks your variability to fight back\nso once you feel depressed it's hard to\nget out of bed it's hard to get\nmotivated and then once it's hard to get\nmotivated other parts of your life start\nto fall apart and so this creates a\nvicious cycle and it turns out that\nthere's one Central Point which can\nactually disarm the cycle which is our\nability of perception or more\nspecifically how depression creates\nparticular cognitive biases that then\nmake our life worse before we dive into\nthe details I just wanted to tell you\nall a little bit about myself so I'm\nsomeone who studied for S years to\nbecome a monk and then ended up becoming\na psychiatrist if youall are interested\nin more resources on depression check\nout the various videos on our YouTube\nchannel our resource packs or even check\nout Dr K's guide which is sort of my\ntake on depression how do I approach\npatients when they walk into my office\nhow do I sort of figure out what's\nclinical and what's non-clinical and\ntoday we're going to be sharing with you\na non-clinical perspective on depression\nwhich is the kind of stuff that's\nincluded in the guide so let's go back\nto this idea of perception so before we\nkind of get into why perception is so\nimportant let's take a quick look at the\ncycle of depression so what do we know\nscientifically about what happens to\nsomeone when they become depressed so it\nstarts with an inciting event okay so\nwhat we know scientifically is that most\npeople who get depressed usually start\nwith something bad so there's some kind\nof normal bad thing that happens in life\nthere's a breakup we lose a loved one we\nsort of get an F on a test something\nhappens and then the first thing is that\nmany people recover from it but if you\nend up with depression something happens\nand you don't recover from it and let's\nunderstand a little bit about what that\ncycle is so when there's an inciting\nevent the first thing that happens is\nthat there's a cognitive bias that\noccurs and so the problem with the\ncognitive bias is it shapes the way that\nwe see the world we start to see it in a\nnegative Manner and so even though\nthings are objectively better than we\nthink they are our mind doesn't see it\nthat way now before we kind of get\nfurther into it we're going to show\nyouall a cool experiment that shows you\nhow your mind when it doesn't know\nsomething will just make things up so\nit's a really great experiment which is\nthat most people don't realize that you\nactually have blind spots in both of\nyour eyes I know right now you're\nlooking at the world and you think that\nyou can see everything in front of you\nbut you literally cannot there is\nactually a part of your vision that is a\nblind spot where you can't see anything\nand it turns out that your mind\nconstructs almost like an AI what should\nbe there so we're going to start by\nshowing you this principle so what I\nwant yall to do is sit up straight close\nyour left eye and then hold your left\nfinger out in front of you kind of like\nthis okay so we want to hold our left\nfinger and then we're going to be\nlooking at our left finger with our\nright eye and then I want you to put\nyour two fingers together so focus on\nthe left finger the opposite finger from\nthe eye and then what I want youall to\ndo is move the right finger slowly away\nso as you focus on this finger what\nyou'll notice is there's a period right\nabout here where you actually can not\nsee this finger you can even wiggle it\naround a little bit and you'll notice\nthat it's completely gone and if you\nmove to the left you can see it if you\nmove to the right you can see it but\nthere's actually a blind spot right here\nand this is absolutely insane because it\nteaches us one very simple principle\nwhich is that when the mind doesn't\nactually have information it makes\nup and this is a huge problem in\ndepression so let's go back to this idea\nof an inciting event so once we have an\ninciting event there's a set of\ncognitive biases that start to come into\nplay so let's talk about what these are\nthe first is negative interpretation of\nambiguous events okay so what this means\nis that let's say you're in the\nbreakroom and a colleague of yours is in\nthe breakroom and they don't say hi to\nyou while they're grabbing their coffee\nand you're grabbing your coffee so if\nyour mind is depressed it's going to\ntake this ambiguous information and\ninterpret it in the most negative way\npossible but it's not that the person\ndislikes you it's that your mind is\ndoing this business again where it\ndoesn't actually see what's going on but\nit fills it in with whatever the\ndepressive character of your mind is so\nthis is bias number one and we'll talk a\nlittle bit about how to deal with these\nso bias number two is a selection bias\ntowards the negative now what does this\nmean so I'm sure that y'all have been in\nthis kind of situation where someone is\ngiving you feedback and they give you\npositive feedback and they give you\nnegative feedback but sometimes our mind\nis kind of tricky and it actually\nignores all of the positive feedback and\nthen it sort of Narrows down or focuses\nentirely on the negative feedback the\nthird bias that we create this one is so\ntricky it's so subtle and so devastating\nis an\novergeneralization of memories okay now\nthis is really important to understand\nit's subtle but it's important to\nunderstand so when your mind is healthy\nit remembers specifics so if my mind is\nhealthy and let's say I get a perform\nperance review where I get good feedback\nand negative feedback what the mind will\nnaturally do if I'm healthy is I'll say\nokay I'm doing these things good and I'm\ndoing these things poorly but if I am\ndepressed what starts to happen is I\ngeneralize I\novergeneralize especially my memories so\nwhat ends up happening is the next day\nall I will remember is that performance\nreview went terribly even though my boss\nsaid hey you're doing a a fantastic job\nbut I tend to ignore that so I tend to\novergeneralize and if you talk to people\nwho are depressed or maybe been this way\nmaybe you're depressed you'll sort of\nnotice that they speak in very general\nterms my life sucks the world is going\nto hell everything sucks everything\nsucks everything sucks and if you ask\nthem for specifics they can give you\nspecifics and we'll get to that in a\nsecond but there is still this function\nat play in the brain where their brain\nis sort of overgeneralizing things and\nremoving a lot of positivity so let's\ntake a quick look at how this manifests\nvery practically so if I am going\nthrough a day let's say I get one\npositive event one negative event and\none neutral event so let's say I go to\nwork and I actually had a good\nperformance review my boss said you did\na fantastic job here are a couple of\nthings you need to work on this is a\ngood thing my boss said I did a\nfantastic job then there's the neutral\nevent there's the person who is grabbing\ncoffee in the morning who doesn't say Hi\nand then I get a text from someone that\nI've been on three dates with saying I\ndon't think this is going to work if I'm\na non-depressed person if my mind isn't\ndepressed on this day I had had one\npiece of bad news one piece of good news\nand then all kinds of stuff happened in\nmy day not just this all kinds of stuff\nhappened in my day that's relatively\nneutral right some people said hi some\npeople didn't say hi but if I am\ndepressed what ends up happening first\nof all this gets removed from my memory\nI literally do not think about it the\nneutral thing gets converted to a\nnegative thing and then then I have a\nnegative thing so whereas on balance I\nactually had a plus one a zero and a\nminus one in the mind of a depressed\nperson I have a a zero a negative 1 and\na negative 1 so in my life instead of\neven breaking even I convert breaking\neven into a Nega -2 so what tends to\nhappen next so now as I start to see the\nworld like this the world becomes\nobjectively worse right because like my\nmind cannot see the positive information\nand let's take a look at what this looks\nlike so now I decide that I'm bad at at\nmy job or my job sucks people don't like\nme I'll be alone forever so if we sort\nof look at this for a second we begin to\nrealize that in people who are depressed\nlives Everything feels like it's going\nwrong right this thing is going wrong\nand this thing is going wrong and this\nthing is going wrong everything's going\nwrong at the same time and so if you\nhave problems at your job if you have\nproblems with your friendships and if\nyou have problems with your romantic\nrelationships what does the Mind end up\nconcluding if every dimension of your\nlife is going wrong is it really every\ndimension of life that's the problem no\nthen our mind puts all these three\nthings together and concludes I am\nbad and this by the way is the Crux of\nsomething called negative self attitude\nso the key Hallmark of depression is a\nnegative self- attitude the way that you\nsee yourself is incredibly negative and\nhow do we get to see ourselves as\nincredibly negative it's because of this\nright I suck at this I suck at this I\nsuck at this but this in turn is based\non a perception problem so then what\nhappens is once I have negative self-\nattitude then we enter all the good\nscience about depression right then what\nI start to do is I start to have\nproblems with motivation I start to have\nproblems with inflammation now as I have\nnegative self- attitude my serotonin\nlevel maybe decreases and so then we\nenter into treatment now here's the\nproblem with treatment is that when\nwe're treating someone with depression\nthere's a lot of things we can do as\npsychiatrists or therapists we can help\npeople cognitively reframe we can help\nwe can help validate their emotions we\ncan work on the emotional part of the\nbrain we can work on the cognitive part\nof the brain but this is why this is\nwhat's the big thing that's missing what\nperpetuates the cycle is actually the\nperception problem right because it's\nnot that actually three things in your\nlife went wrong it's only that one thing\nin your life went wrong but you're\nunable to see it that way and the reason\nthat I I don't know if this kind of\nmakes sense but the reason that psychiat\nsuck at altering your perception is\nbecause that is literally the one thing\nthat we cannot do right so as a\npsychiatrist I can talk to you about\nyour emotions I can validate your\nemotions I can decompress your emotions\nI can give you a hug I can tell you I\nthink you're a wonderful human being I\ncan do all this kind of stuff we can\nalso do things like cognitive behavioral\ntherapy we're going to we're going to\nmake charts what are your cognitions\nwhat are your behaviors what are your\nemotions we can do all this stuff\nbecause it involves words right it\ninvolves actions but the one thing that\nwe can't change is the way that you see\nthe world and so the problem with this\nnow is that since we aren't good at it\nas psychiatrists we actually don't have\ninterventions for it because it's\nsomething that happens within you and\nsince we don't have sort of\ninterventions for it what this means is\nthat this one part of the cycle of\ndepression has been horribly neglected\nby the field of Psychiatry and the real\nproblem here is that this one part of\nyour brain that's been horribly\nneglected is actually the most important\npart for propagating the cycle of\ndepression it's the thing that actually\nhappens the earliest and even if you\nlook at people who are resilient so if\nyou do studies on people if you look at\nstudies of people who are resilient what\nyou discover is that the way that they\nperceive setbacks is different from\npeople who are not resilient it all\ncomes down to a perception difference so\npeople who resilient will say okay this\nthing you know I didn't do great today\nbut I learned something right so at\nleast I'll be better tomorrow so the way\nthat they interpret their events is very\ndifferent hey all if you're interested\nin applying some of the principles that\nwe share to actually create change in\nyour life check out Dr K's guide to\nmental health it combines over two\ndecades of my experience of both being a\nmonk and a psychiatrist and distills all\nof the most important things I've\nlearned into a Choose Your Own Adventure\nformat so check out the link in the bio\nand start your journey today so what do\nwe do about this there are a couple of\nthings that we're going to use from the\nsystem Sy of yoga and the reason that I\nlove the system of yoga is because it is\nstrong at everything that Psychotherapy\nis weak at because Psychotherapy is\nabout I'm going to do something to you\nright you're going to come into my\noffice I'm going to sit here and I'm\ngoing to therapize you but in yoga it's\nall about a single person right so\nthere's no one there to help you you're\nsitting there you're meditating and so\nthe other cool thing about yoga is it's\nvery good at training perception they\nhave a whole system of meditation called\nbre Yara which is all about training\nyour perception there are dozens of\npractices this is also in the guide by\nthe way so here's what we're going to\nteach you we're going to teach you one\nvery simple thing which is called the\nmentality materiality exercise this\nexercise comes from this awesome\nBuddhist text called the vudi Maga and\nthe vishi Maga literally means the path\nof purification so this is the way that\nyou purify different parts of yourself\nand they have a beautiful part in there\nthey have a beautiful chapter in there\nabout purifying your perception and what\nthey share with us is something called\nthe mentality materiality exercise it's\nvery verbose that's just how they talk\nso this exercise is actually quite\nsimple it is to acknowledge that\nanything that you see in the world has a\nmateriality to it so here I've got a\nvial of I think a sample perfume okay so\nif I look at this there are some\nattributes of this that come from the\nvial right so this is this vial is it's\nclear it's white it's kind of like a\nlittle bit cold it's not very heavy it's\nlight all of these things are actually\nin the object the question is that when\nI see this object I do not see it that\nway right what I see is oh I like this\nperfume I don't like this perfume it's\ntoo small man I should have bought a a\nbigger bottle because I really liked it\nand now I can't find it online and now\nthis is a problem that's all True by the\nway this is something that I was going\nto get from my wife that I didn't order\nin time because I procrastinated and now\nI still have this thing it's been\nsitting on my desk for a year so the key\nthing here is that if you look at the\nworld let's say you see your dog your\ndog has certain physical material\nattributes it's hairy it's smelly it has\na cute face but even cuteness right so\nwhat is cuteness cuteness is something\nthat our mind attaches to the dog and\nthis is the point of the mentality\nmateriality exercise is to notice what\nare all of the things that are actually\na part of the object and what are all of\nthe things that my mind adds to it and\nwhat you will discover is mindblowing\nbecause 99% of your perception doesn't\nactually come from the outside world it\nactually comes from you so when you look\nat your dog and and your dog makes you\nfeel good the making you feel good is\nnot in the fur of the dog it's not in\nthe eyes of the dog it's not in the\nwagging tail of the dog this is just a\ndog sitting there wagging its tail what\nmakes you feel good comes from within\nyou and this is also where if we sort of\nstop and think about it a lot of we what\nwe get upset about this person did not\nsay hi to me in the break bre room this\nmorning hold on a second what does your\nmind attach what is the mentality that\nyou attach to that materiality the\nmateriality is I walked into the\nbreakroom I got my coffee they got their\ncoffee they walked out and I walked out\nthat is all that happened that's it and\nyet our mind attaches all kinds of\nmeaning to this and then you may say but\nmy mind attaches meaning because it's\nlogical right because it knows that I am\nunliked and now we get to the second\nthing that we're going to talk about so\njust practice the mentality materiality\nthing where I want you all to just\nnotice your internal reactions and what\nyou attach to objects outside of you and\nthis is where in the vishu Maga they\ntalk about 40 attributes of materiality\nso they say that an object can be hard\nit can be soft it can be heavy it can be\nlight it can be warm it can be cold it\ncan have temperature you know it can\nhave smoothness it can have whatever so\nthey attach all these different\nattributes and none of them are going to\nbe the stuff that your mind attaches to\nlike something something or dislike\nsomething something's good or something\nis bad these are all attached by your\nmind so do that practice there are a\ncouple of other things that we can\nmanage to shape our perception and\nthat's going to be these three sources\nof cognitive bias so the next exercise\nthat you can do if you feel like the\nworld is going to hell is you can take\nlet's start with the interpretation of\nambiguous stimuli so there are studies\nthat basically show like conclusively\nthat people who are depressed will see\nambiguous things and interpret them in\nthe worst ways possible so for example\nthere's one study that showed that if\nyou have a neutral facing facial\nexpression right you're just\nlike depressed people will see that as\nnegative and normal people will see that\nas neutral this person is just like\nwalking they must be thinking about\nwhatever right that it has nothing to do\nwith me we'll get to that one in a\nsecond so what you want to do is take\nanything that you sort of view as\nnegative and take a sheet of paper and\nsay what is the real evidence that you\nhave that this this is a negative thing\nand what is the evidence that you have\nto the contrary this technique is also\nused in cognitive behavioral therapy so\nyou take one thing that is negative and\nyou try to see what could be positive\nthere and the goal isn't that you have\nto believe that the goal is literally to\npractice having your mind look at things\nin a more nuanced way we want to be able\nto weigh pros and cons but in depression\nall we see is the the cons so as we do\nthis practice this will actually work\nfor number one and number two with the\nselection bias that's very very very\nhard to shakee but this the mentality\nmateriality exercise will help with and\nlet's talk about how for a second so why\ndoes the mentality materiality exercise\nhelp with selection bias so as we begin\nto see things as they are instead of our\nway of interpreting them this will\nchange the way that we see the world so\nthen we won't select just the negative\nbecause nothing in our life is going to\nbe negative everything is actually going\nto be neutral and this is the goal that\neven the Dalai Lama speaks of so he says\nthe hardest thing to do in the world is\nto see things as they are so mentality\nmateriality is going to help with our\nselection bias we talked about altering\nour interpretations with a procons list\nand now we get to the good one\novergeneralization so there's one thing\nyou can do to break the cycle of\novergeneralization which is to remove I\nfrom the equation so if you look at\nsomeone who's depressed one of the key\nthings is that they always think that\nthey're at fault right so and this is\ngoing to sound really weird because if\nyou pay attention to your thoughts and\nyou're depressed or you're feeling bad\nwe're not talking about clinical\ndepression we're just talking about\nyou're kind of in a bad head space well\nyou'll find is everything has to do with\nyou these people would be better off\nwithout me they'd have more fun if they\nif I didn't even go the work everyone\nwould be happier at work everything is\nabout me me me me me so what we know\nabout depression is it's actually quite\nnarcissistic in some ways we even know\nthat the part of your brain that thinks\nabout you is hyperactive in depression\nthis is the part of the brain called the\ndefault mode Network and this is also\nwhy ketamine is one of the fastest or is\nthe fastest treatment for depression\nthat we know of and what ketamine\nactually does you can inject K Infuse\nketamine or give it to people\nintranasally and what ketamine does is\ncauses a dissociative uh reaction in\nyour brain so ketamine causes\ndissociation that's why we in initially\nwe used it for anesthesia and surgery so\nwe give people ketamine and then they\nlike lose sight of themselves\nand once they lose sight of themselves\nlike nothing hurts so like we literally\ninduce dissociation and it breaks the\ncycle of depression so we're going to do\nthat without ketamine because ketamine\nhas all kinds of problems and so this is\nwhat we're going to practice is removing\nthe eye from your thinking right so what\nyou'll notice is that overgeneralized\nthinking has to do with eye thinking I\nknow this is getting kind of like\nnuanced but I really want y'all to hear\nwhat I'm saying so anytime you\novergeneralize it's going to involve I\nyou'll see that these two thoughts are\nlinked I suck right that is the mother\nof all\novergeneralizations and so what we want\nto start doing is literally thinking\nabout particular scenarios like I went\ninto the break room and I got my coffee\nand this person got their coffee and\nwhat we end up doing is we think that\nthe reason they didn't talk to us is\nbecause I they don't like me we never\nstop to think okay maybe this person is\ngoing through a divorce maybe this\nperson is preoccupied maybe this person\nhas a really stressful day maybe this\nperson is really excited about something\nmaybe this person just got a really\nworrying text we do not think about the\nother person at all it always has to do\nwith me me me me me so pay attention to\nany thoughts that you have in your mind\nthat are overgeneralized and have to do\nwith you and just take a moment to\nconsider what about the rest of the\nworld what could be going on in this\nperson's life to create this behavior\nand sometimes people can get so\ndepressed that they literally cannot\nthink of anything and that's why I\nencourage you all to practice as best as\nyou can and this is the kind of thing by\nthe way this cognitive reframe Fring is\nsomething that a therapist can really\nhelp you with the last thing that I'm\ngoing to share with yall is something\ncalled the Thematic app perception test\nso what we do with the Thematic app\nperception test is we look at images\nthat are intentionally ambiguous and\nthen we ask people for their\ninterpretation of them so as we look at\nthis like you may say like oh it's very\nclear what's going on this person is\nreally sad but the question is why is\nwhy are they sad did someone just die\nhere that's my interpretation of this\none what about this right like this is\nkind of creepy the other reason I like\nthe Thematic Apperception Test is all\nthe images are like super creepy so this\nis like a good example of like what's\ngoing on here like how are you\ninterpreting this is this person trying\nto smother this person or is this a\nblessing that they're giving or like\nwhat are they doing here are they about\nto wake them up like who knows what\nabout this one so the key thing here is\nthat some of these images can be\ninterpreted very very differently\nbecause the image is purposefully\nambiguous and the whole point of the\nThematic Apperception Test is that we\ndon't realize how much our perception\nshapes literally the way that we see the\nworld we think of our perception is\nobjective and the problem is until we\nstart questioning our perception then\nthe cycle of depression will continue\nbecause the inputs we're getting that\nare making us depressed are not actually\naccurate they are distorted in some way\nand since they're distorted we see the\nworld in a negative light then we draw\nconclusions about the world our mind\nloves to overgeneral\nthen we draw conclusions by our about\nourselves and then once we believe that\nwe are not good then all kinds of\nproblems will arise so the question is\nhow do you short circuit this the way\nyou shortcircuit it is by actually\ntraining your perception right so if we\ncan look out for these cognitive biases\nthe selection bias the interpretation of\nambiguity as negative and the\novergeneralization it will change\nliterally the way that you see the world\nand once the world World becomes a\ndifferent place it is way easier to be\nless depressed now there's one last\nthing that in all fairness I have to\ninclude I didn't want to include it but\nI kind of got to so the last thing we\ngot to talk talk about is actually kind\nof derails what I just told youall so\nthere's this great concept called\ndepressive realism and what basically\nresearchers were trying to figure out is\nthat if I am depressed or does a\ndepressed person actually see the word a\nworld in a distorted way or do they see\nit in a real istic way so is the glass\nliterally half empty and what we've\ndiscovered is kind of scary is that\ndepressed people are better at actually\njudging the accuracy of the world so I\nknow this sounds kind of weird but hear\nme out so all human beings have an\ninherent bias towards the positive so\nthis is why the lottery is a thing right\nthis is why people buy loot boxes\nbecause every human being thinks that\nthey are better than average this is\nfactually incorrect so factually like\nyou know that you're not going to win\nthe lottery there's no point in buying\nloot boxes but we each have this\nintrinsic bias that thinks even though\nit doesn't work for other people I'm a\nwinner everybody else who buys lottery\ntickets is a loser but I'm a winner and\nthe problem is that this level of\nnarcissistic idiocy is required for\nhealthy human functioning this cognitive\ndistortion that the world is a better\nplace than it actually is is required\nfor the maintenance of a healthy mind\nand so the problem with depressive\nrealism is once we remove that bias and\nwe actually see the world more\naccurately which it's studies will show\nthat they actually are accurate with the\nway they judge things but this even\nthough it's more accurate it is not in a\nit doesn't view the world in a way that\nmakes us healthy so I know it sounds\nkind of weird but technically depressed\npeople if you're depressed you're like\nactually right about the way that you\nsee things in a lot of ways these\ncognitive biases are still at play so\nyou actually are a better judge of the\nworld not actually about yourself\nbecause all these cognitive biases will\nlead to an amplification of the negative\nbut technically and we're trying to be\nprecise here technically depressed\npeople are more accurate judges that\ndoesn't mean that there aren't\ndistortions as well and this is just one\nthing that I had to include for the sake\nof completeness from a very practical\nsense though we know that if you want a\nhealthy mind you should change your\nperception and this is where my\nexperiences with yoga and stuff are that\nas I see the world more clearly as I\nstrengthen my perception everything does\nget better but I don't think that I'm\ncognitively distorted because even once\nyou do prahara a lot like you're just\ngoing to see the world as it is is\nneither good nor bad it is just what it\nis anyway I know it's kind of an aside I\nknow it's kind of like after the fact\nbut for all the depressed people out\nthere who really believe that the glass\nis half empty y'all are actually not\n[Music]\nwrong\non"
