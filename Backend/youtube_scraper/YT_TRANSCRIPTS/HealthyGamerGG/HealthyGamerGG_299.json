    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nmake life\n[Music]\neasy now if you're listening to this\nyour first reaction to that is probably\nthis is ridiculous right this guy is\ntelling me that there's a way to make\nlife easy and how do we naturally\nrespond to that we say that this person\ndoes not understand my life this person\nmay think life is easy but that's\nbecause their life is easy some people\nout there have easy lives if they have\nmoney if they have power if they have\nsecurity and then there are people out\nthere who have hard lives and it's it's\nno use for people who have easy lives to\ntell people who have hard lives it's\npossible to make your life easy so when\nwe have this kind of reaction to this\nstatement hey it's possible to make your\nlife easy what do you think that\nactually does the first thing that it\ndoes is if someone has actually figured\nout how to make life easy we end up\nmuzzling them we end up canceling them\nbecause you're not allowed to say that\nand if we live in a societ soety where\npeople who have figured out how to make\nlife easy can't talk about it what does\nthat mean for the rest of us that means\nthat the rest of us will continue to\nlive Hard lives because the people who\nhave figured out we're canceling in the\nfirst place and the most bizarre thing\nis that one of the reasons that life has\nbecome harder and harder and harder is\nbecause we've started to rely on science\nmore and more and more and the more we\nrely on science the harder life becomes\nnow this may sound really confusing\nbecause doesn't like it doesn't science\nmake a lot of Our Lives better it's very\neasy I can get food delivered to my door\nI can get grocery delivery I can work\nonline science makes my life easy in so\nmany different ways well yes and no\nbecause if we look at science sure\nthere's a lot of technological advances\nwhich will make my life more convenient\nbut something paradoxical is happening\neven though my life is becoming more and\nmore convenient because everything is at\nmy fingertips right especially this guy\nthat can do everything somehow we're\nseeing a unprecedented Mental Health\ncrisis despite the fact that we have a\nton of technological advancement so\nwhat's going on so it turns out that\nscience is really good at advancing\nTechnologies and building convenience\nbut science is actually quite bad at\nteaching you how to live your life but\nyou may say but hold on Dr K we have all\nof these studies about happiness and\nthis and that and let's tunnel down into\nthat as it turns out those studies don't\nmake things easier they actually make\nthings harder so we can have as many\nstudies as you want about what makes\npeople happy and people will say okay\nyou need $100,000 a year now probably\n1225 you need a healthy stable\nrelationship you need social support you\nneed access to Green Space this is the\nway that you get a happy life right this\nis science's answers just do all of\nthese things and you will be happy the\nproblem is that science tells you what\nthe goals are or what correlates with\nwith happiness but it doesn't actually\ntell you how to get there right so they\ndon't teach us the how they just teach\nus in general what correlates with\npeople being happy now let's understand\nwhat I mean by that so science is very\ngood at teaching you populationbased\nstuff science can't tell you what will\nwork for you science is the study of\nwhat works for the average person so we\ncan look at scientific studies on\nhappiness for example and science can\nlook at 100 people who are happy and 100\npeople who are unhappy and science will\ntell you okay the way to be happy is to\nmake $125,000 a year to have a strong\nfriend group to have someone who loves\nyou in your life access to Green Space a\npet and to meditate every day so science\nis like this is the way to happiness and\nthen if you try to apply that knowledge\nto your life it becomes very very\ndifficult because you can't just wake up\none day and say hey I'm going to go find\nsomeone who loves me hey I'm going to\ncreate a friend group because this is\nhow science Works science is a\npopulationbased approach so science\ndoesn't give us answers for you as an\nindividual it gives us answers for what\nworks on average for most people so a\ngood example of this is something like\nSSRI by anti-depressant medication so we\ncan do randomized control trials that\nshow us that 100 people who are\ndepressed can start on an SSRI and on\naverage we will see a 30% Improvement\nbut this doesn't mean that if I give you\nan SSRI that you will get 30% better it\nmeans that if we take a 100 people a\nthird of them will get 80% better a\nthird of them will get maybe 40% better\nand a third of them will have no benefit\nat all but when it comes to applying the\nscience to your life which of those\nthings do you fall into science has no\nway of knowing and this is why despite\nall of our advances in science we still\nrequire\nclinicians to administer medicine so\nlet's understand precisely what a\nclinician does what a clinician does is\ntakes all of this information that\nscience has provided these\nevidence-based techniques like let's say\nmotivational interviewing for addictions\nor dialectical behavioral therapy for\nborderline personality disorder it takes\nall of these like scientific things and\nthen we actually app apply it to an\nindividual you require a human being to\ntake all of Science and translate it\ninto something that will work for you\nand this is why when we look at the\noutcomes for problems that are hard\nright like problems like addictions we\nrequire clinical support and this is\nwhat we discover is that science is good\nat providing population-based answers\nbut the application to a human being\nstill requires a lot of specificity so\nscience can't give us all the answers\nfor our individual life so in order to\nunderstand how to make life easy we have\nto understand what is the difference\nbetween easy and hard and this is very\nsimple so if you know how to do\nsomething it's easy and if you don't\nknow how to do something it's hard right\nthis is very very simple if you know how\nto change change a tire it's relatively\neasy if you don't know how to change a\ntire it feels very hard and feels very\nimpossible and this is true of things\nthat we view as objectively hard as well\nso I'm an addiction psychiatrist which\nmeans that I work with people who have\naddictions and if we look at the\ndefinition of an addiction it's\nsomething that's very very very hard to\ndeal with we have aspects of your\nphysiology your biology we have for\nexample an opioid addiction we have\nthese mu receptors these little\nreceptors all over your body that if you\never stop taking an opiate they will\nstart exhibiting pain signals they'll\namplify all of the pain in your body\nthey'll give you withdrawals you'll\nstart having diarrhea you'll feel awful\nyou'll start shaking everything will be\nvery very difficult your body will\npunish you your brain will punish you if\nyou ever stop opiates and so this is\nsomething that is objectively hard to\ndeal with and yet through the practice\nof clinical medicine we will do\nsomething really cool which is that the\nmajority of my patients feel like\nmanaging their addiction is now easy\nright they don't even think about it\nanymore it used to be hard but then they\nlearned The Knack of it then they\nfigured it out and then suddenly it\nbecomes easy so let's take the example\nof something that is objectively hard\nlike an addiction so if I have something\nlike an opioid addiction or marijuana\naddiction this is something that is\nobjectively difficult to overcome\nbecause I have all these receptors in my\nbrain and my body these mu receptors in\nopioid addiction that if I ever stop\ntaking opiates they will punish me they\nwill create pain they will create\ndiarrhea I'll start aching all over I'll\nfeel chills I will feel so physically\nbad my body will punish me if I ever\nstop taking the opiate and so someone\nstruggles with opioid addiction they\nwill say this is really hard to overcome\nit is impossible to overcome but as they\npractice and as use certain techniques\nlike motivational interviewing as they\nengage in things like Narcotics\nAnonymous and peer support as they do\nall this stuff they get the Knack of it\nright and suddenly what became\nimpossible becomes very difficult but\ndoable and then it becomes hard but\nactually not that big of a deal and then\neventually you get to this point where a\nlot of people who are sober will get to\nwill say oh I don't even think about it\nanymore right even now when I go to a\nbarbecue I don't even think about having\na beer I don't want the beer suddenly\nthat that which was so difficult to\ncontrol becomes a natural impulse I\ndon't even want to drink like it's\ndisgusting I'm done with that stuff and\nthe question is what the hell how did\nthis happen because this is objectively\ndifficult right science will tell you oh\nmy god\novercoming addiction is objectively\ndifficult so what's going on here\nbecause it's very simple if we want to\nunderstand the difference between hard\nand easy it's one very simple thing if\nyou know how to do something it's easy\nand if you don't know how to do\nsomething it's hard right so until we\nlearn how to manage our addiction it\nbecomes hard or even impossible and once\nwe learn how to manage our addiction it\nbecomes easy and this is not just true\nof addiction right so you can say oh my\nGod I just built my first PC and it was\nso hard it's so hard to build a PC I\nhave no idea how to do it and then you\nhave people over here at PC Master race\nwho are like don't worry about it bro\nit's easy like I'll I'll help you out\nright so as soon as you learn how to do\nsomething it becomes easy and if you\ndon't know how to do something it\nbecomes hard very simple hey y'all if\nyou're interested in applying some of\nthe principles that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday we spend a lot of time learning to\ndo hard things so let's take the example\nof calculus okay so if we're studying\ncalculus we study calculus for one year\nabout two semesters so the semester is\nabout 12 weeks and then over the course\nof let's say one week of calculus let's\nlook at what our actual studying program\nis if you want to learn calculus you go\nto class for 3 hours a week and for\nevery hour that you're in class you\nshould study for two hours a week so\nwe're spending nine hours a week\nstudying calculus we're studying\ncalculus over two sem semesters that are\n12 weeks each right and so this ends up\n12 weeks * 9 is 108 so I'm spending 108\nhours for one semester of calculus and\nover the course of the year I spend\n216 hours of dedicated study to learn\ncalculus now when it comes to living\nyour life how many hours of dedicated\nstudy do you have do you go to class\nwhere you learn certain Concepts about\nhow to live your life and then spend two\nhours applying those concepts for every\nhour that you learn do you spend nine\nhours a week practicing how to live life\nwith intention where someone is teaching\nyou what the principles are and then you\npractice abs absolutely not the reason\nthat life is hard is because we don't\nspend time learning how to live life\nright you just kind of get bodied by\nlife you're sort of struggling over here\nand then this thing happens and you try\nto manage you're managing managing\nmanaging coping coping coping instead of\never intentionally learning and as long\nas you are not doing that if you don't\nknow how to live life of course life is\ngoing to be hard and so until you've\nspent 26 hours of dedicated study trying\nto live life of course it's going to be\nhard so today we are going to teach you\nthe most most fundamental building block\nof how to make your life easy this is a\nconcept that was discovered by the yogis\nthousands of years ago and it turns out\nthat if you understand this concept A\nlot of your life will become easy and\nthere's another problem here which is\nthat a lot of the things that we try to\ndo to make our life easy or actually\nmaking our life harder and the number\ntwo the two culprits are motivation and\nwillower everyone is out there looking\nfor motivation and everyone is out there\nfor looking for willpower and they think\nthe more motivated the more I I my\nwillpower is strong the easier my life\nwill be actually the exact opposite\nmotivation and willpower the wrong\ndirection you shouldn't even be moving\nin that direction if you understand this\none yoga concept that concept is the\nconcept of something called a Guna so\nGuna means quality basically and what\nthe yogis essentially discovered is that\nthere are three states three qualities\nthat all things can be in there's a\nfundamental quality of thas which is\ninertia there's a fundamental quality of\nrajas which is activity or passion and\nthere's a fundamental quality of satas\nwhich is balance so if you look at\nanything in the universe we're going to\ntalk about people for a second you'll\nnotice that there are two forces there\nis a an inertia force and there is an\nactivating force and when these two\nforces are in Balance things will be\neasy and when they are out of balance\nthings will become hard so let's\nunderstand this in the body and mind so\nthere have been days in your life where\nthings are easy right you had some days\nwhere things are easy and if you really\nlook at those days in your life you may\nsay okay I'm like kind of motivated but\nit's not actually technically that\nyou're very motivated you don't wake up\nand you like I'm a I've got a fire in my\nB\ngo you're like okay like I got to do\nthis stuff today so let me just go ahead\nand do it okay let me just take care of\nthis stuff let me take care of this\nthere's a certain casualness to it\nthere's a certain ease to it right and\non these days you're also not pushing\nyourself because you're not like oh my\nGod I need a ton of willpower I got to\ndo it I got to do it oh my God it's so\nhard it's so hard you kind of wake up\nand on some days you know what I'm\ntalking about you've had some of these\ndays where like the stars align and you\ndon't know what is going on and like\nsuddenly like things are a little bit\neasier that day you wake up one day you\nbrush your teeth you have some breakfast\nyou sit down you do a couple hours of\nwork and suddenly like oh my God you did\nso much you were procrastinating so hard\nand in three or four hours you kind of\ngot everything done what the hell is\ngoing on like how did that happen and\nthen you wake up on other days where\nyou're like oh my God it's so hard to\nget out of bed I don't want to get out\nof bed man I need a cup of coffee man I\nneed two cups of coffee oh my God and\ndoing everything is so difficult you\nhave to push your body this is thus\nbecause your body and your mind are\ninert pushing your mind to focus on\nsomething it's inert it doesn't want to\nmove pushing your body it's inert right\nand when we get an abundance of thumb us\nwe even get a clinical diagnosis of\nsomething like major depressive disorder\nin a depressive episode there's a part\nof that that is psychomotor retardation\nwhich means that moving walking down the\nstreet is like moving through mud\ninstead of moving through air there's a\nlot of resistance in an inertia this is\nthus on the flip side we have rajas\nrajas is activity or passion and you may\nsay okay but like inertia is bad so\nrajas is better right no equally bad\njust bad in a different way so when we\nhave an overabundance of rajas we get a\nton of passion right so we get super\nexcited about stuff and this is your\nproblem too it's not just that you're\ninert some days it's that you're way too\npassionate other days oh my God I got so\nexcited about this I'm going to do it\nI'm going to do it I'm going to do it\nI'm going to order all this stuff I'm\ngoing to buy a guitar I'm going to buy\nall this stuff I'm going to learn to\nplay guitar you this overabundance of\nactivity or passion you get super\nexcited about a video game your mind\ngets super excited about something oh my\nGod we're we're cooking now let's go\nbaby let's go and what ends up happening\nafter an overabundance of regist you run\nout of steam or the other problem is\nthat you should be focusing on thing\nnumber a but your mind is so active or\npassionate about thing number B that you\ndon't focus on what you're supposed to\nbe focusing on so in both cases this is\nnot the right State of Mind instead what\nwe want is a balance for things to be\nbalanced right I'm not overly excited\nbut I have enough energy or activity to\nwhere I can do the thing that I need to\ndo and my mind is relatively tranquil\nand calm now let's go back to motivation\nand willpower the problem with\nmotivation and willpower is that they\nare\ncompensations for tamas and rajas so if\nwe really think about motivation why do\nwe want motivation so we want motivation\nbecause if my body or mind is motivated\nthen I don't have to force it right so\nmotivation is a natural inclination to\ndo something and we all go seeking out\nmotivation because if we have were\nmotivated oh thank God then I don't need\nwillpower my body will naturally want to\ndo it but I want you to think a little\nbit about how Insidious and devastating\nThis truly is because what you're trying\nto do is create a state for your body or\nmind where it does what you want it to\ndo it wants to do it right the Mind once\nit's motivated it naturally wants to do\nsomething but that still means you're\nnot in control if the mind is motivated\ntowards doing something you're breathing\na sigh of relief but it's not that you\nare telling it to do it and then the\nmind naturally follows your orders it's\nthank God the Mind actually wants to do\nit because I have no [ __ ] control\nover my mind to begin with so on the\ndays that it wants to do what I want it\nto do thank God and so we end up chasing\nthis idea where we want the mind to do\nwhat we want it to do but we are\nfundamentally not control of it and this\nis what makes life hard because\nmotivation waxes and waines so what\nmotivation is is to try to channel the\nsense of rajas we want a natural passion\nin the direction that we want it because\nwe don't control the mind so we hope\nthat the passion is in the direction\nthat we want well what about willpower\nwillpower is our antidote to thumb us\nright so when our body or mind is inert\nand we don't feel like doing something\nwhat is our solution our solution is\nwillpower so even though it's sluggish\nand slow I'm going to force it I'm going\nto push it push boy push willpower like\nlet's go let's go let's go but if you\nlive a life where things are there's a\nlarge exertion of willpower your life\nwill not be easy you may accomplish\nparticular things but it'll be [ __ ]\nexhausting because we know that there\nare three major things that drain our\nmental willpower and uh drain our our\ncognition actually is really a better\nway to put it drain our cognitive energy\nand willpower is one of them forcing\nyour mind to do something or your body\nto do something is very very difficult\nand very draining and here we are\nchasing motivation which is actually\ntricky because motivation means you're\nnot in control you cross your fingers\nand you hope that your body and mind\nwant to do something because they're the\nboss and you're just along for the ride\nand on the flip side we're draining\nourselves trying to push this inert body\nand then on the flip side there are\nthese days where you're in satas and in\nsatas your mind is relatively balanced\nyou're not overly excited so you've got\nsome stamina you've got some stay power\nand you can say to your mind okay today\nwe're going to do this so and then your\nmind is like okay like let's just get it\ndone and on these days life is easy so\nnow the question is all right so if I'm\nin a Raj sick or thick State of Mind how\ndo I cultivate Savas there's one really\nsimple trick that you can do and we'll\nteach all some more details the first is\non a day that you are passionate you\nneed to do things that will make you\nmore satvic tomorrow so anytime you have\na overabundance of rajas the goal is not\nto give into the rajas but to do things\nthat will make you have a balanced mind\ntomorrow so good examples of this are\nfirst of all food so there are certain\nfoods that will lead to passion and\ncertain foods that will lead to inertia\nwe all know there are foods that will\nlead to food Comas right so these are\nthings that are highly calorically dense\na combination of carbohydrates and fats\ntogether so all desserts fall in this\ncategory Pizza falls into this category\nprocessed foods that will cause things\nlike inflammation and stuff like that in\nthe gut well there's all kinds of\nscience we're not going to get into that\nnow you can check out all of our other\nvideos but we know that when you eat\nprocessed foods it increases\ninflammation inflammation then causes a\nlow level of brain fog in your brain\nwill make it hard for you to focus on\nthings will make it hard for you to have\nwillpower everything gets screwed so how\ndo we create this balanced mind so let's\njust think about it for a second right\nhow do we create balance in our body how\ndo we create balance in our mind what we\nput into the body and mind will\ndetermine its function so if we eat\nparticular kinds of food the body will\nbe slow if we eat other kinds of food\nthe body will be activated right if I\nget drunk on liquor suddenly I'm filled\nwith passion and the same is true of the\nMind certain foods will slow down the\nMind certain foods will speed up the\nmind this is true of all psychoactive\nsubstances as as well these are the\nthings that affect the mind in a\nparticular way so food that is light and\nnutritious doesn't weigh down the mind\nbut also doesn't overly activate it the\nsecond thing that we can do to create a\nbalanced body or mind is to stretch it\nright so we want to engage in exercises\nthat will sort of clean out the Mind\npurify the mind as well as stretch the\nMind Focus the mind so this is where\nMind Body practices are very very\npowerful so if we look at practices like\nyoga or taichi how do these things work\nfundamentally so when I engage in a yoga\nposture it's not about becoming a human\npretzel it's that if I try to balance on\none leg with my arms above like this\nwhat's it going to do to my mind it is\ngoing to force my mind to focus right\nbecause I can't stand like this with on\none leg unless my mind is focused this\nis the point of yoga is to induce to\nliterally practice the focusing of the\nmind and since you are telling the mind\nto do something and it is maintaining\nthat state despite the fact that it is\nhard you are training the mind to listen\nand the more you engage in this kind of\nstuff the more balanced the mind will be\nthe more plant the mind will be it'll\nbecome Supple easy to to kind of listen\nto you so these are the two things that\nwe really want to focus on so the first\nthing is we're going to eat light\nnutritious food so high amounts of fiber\nbut not processed fiber anything like\nthat don't don't have any of that\nMetamucil crap or anything like that eat\nvegetables eat fruits cook yourself a\nnice nutritious meal second thing that\nwe want to do on a day of reges when we\nfeel pretty good is we want to do some\nkind of yoga or taichi ideally not even\nexercise but we want a Mind Body\nbalancing practice so you can do Surya\nnamaskar or something like that the\nthird thing that we really want to be\ncareful about when we are trying to\ncreate a soic mind is to avoid all\npsychoactive substances now this is a\nbig one that a lot of people will\nstruggle with so let's understand\npsychoactive substances for a second and\nhow they affect our mind let's take\ncaffeine so does caffeine do caffeine\ncounters thus right so if I wake up in\nthe morning and I feel very sluggish or\nif I'm having an afternoon oh my God I'm\nkind of sluggish let me take caffeine it\nartificially boosts my energy but\ncaffeine doesn't increase your energy\nall you're doing is taking in advance on\nyour future energy so if I drink\ncaffeine now I'm going to have a crash\nlater this is true of all stimulants\nright so once the stuff wears out all of\nthis artificial stuff that you've been\nkind of suppressing through the caffeine\nso if we we look at technically the way\nthat caffeine works it blunts our\nability to detect our fatigue so the way\nthat our brain knows how fatigued we are\nis we detect this uh chemical called\nadenosine and the more adenosine we have\nin our brain the the more we feel tired\nand so that what ends up happening when\nwe take caffeine doesn't actually give\nus energy it just blunts our ability to\nuh detect our tiredness so once the\ncaffeine wears off there's this pile of\nadenosine and suddenly you feel very\ntired okay so caffeine is doesn't give\nyou energy you're just taking an advance\nfrom the future and then you're going to\nhave to pay it back other psychoactive\nsubstances like alcohol or marijuana or\nthings like that these too are\nproblematic because what these are going\nto do is going to calm us down oh my God\nI have anxiety this is an overabundance\nof activity of the mind and so then what\nhappens I take the substance and it\ninduces a thic state we are making our\nmind inert which by the way is true of\nour psychiatric medications as well if\nyou look at these medications like\nanticho medications they're all sedating\nbecause they literally slow down the\nactivity of the mind even ssris are\nsomewhat sedating right we can feel\nsleepy sluggish we're inducing a th6\nstate because in Psychiatry when there\nis an overactivity of the mind we just\nsedate it literally that's what we do\nthat's the neurochemistry of our our\npsychiatric drugs so this is the problem\nis as long as you are ping ponging back\nand forth between a Raj sick mind that\nis chemically not even balanced but\novercome with some something that's\nthick right we're sedating a passionate\nmind or on the flip side we have a\nsluggish mind that we're artificially\nboosting with stimulants in both of\nthese cases the state of our mind is\nunhealthy it's not balanced it's not\neasy so you must cut out as many\npsychoactive substances as you can and\nyou will hear this you may even\nexperience this yourself that if you\ntake a break from all alcohol all\nmarijuana caffeine doesn't have to be\nany all of these substances at the same\ntime every patient I've ever talked to\nif they can cut out a psychoactive\nsubstance after 30 to 60 days they feel\nbetter it may come back after a while\nyou may need to use it I'm definitely in\nthat camp for caffeine but this is the\nkind of thing where once you actually\ndetox off of the substance everyone says\nthey feel better so what we want to do\nis create a savic mind and the more\nsavic our mind is the more balanced our\nmind is the better we will be so we want\nto eat light nutritious foods that are\nnutrient rich and ideally not too\ncalorically dense it's not so much about\nwhether you eat 2,000 calories or 1,800\nor 21100 that's not important the main\nthing is that the food should not be\nPsycho actively dulling right so we want\nfood that's light and nutritious some\nkind of Mind Body practice and some kind\nof restriction on as many substances as\nyou can manage to restrict if you can do\nthese three days on a day that you are\nRaj sick right because remember there\nare going to be some days that you're\noverly active some days that you're uh\nsorry inactive and some days where\nyou're balance so you take an overly\nactive day which is going to happen at\nsome point and then you do as many saic\nthings as you can can as you do more\nsatvic things what are you actually\ndoing you're actually setting up for a\nhealthier tomorrow so when you wake up\nthe next day all of that stuff in your\ngut the Mind Body practice that you've\ndone the reduction in substances means\nyou're going through less withdrawal\nokay or maybe you started the process of\nwithdrawal but since you're eating\nhealthy and stuff like that you're not\nvery sluggish your gut bacteria isn't\nout of whack the next day when you wake\nup your mind will be 1% 5% 10% more\nsavic and as your mind becomes more\nsatvic it'll be a little bit easier to\nget it to do what you want to do because\nit's balanced it's not overly sluggish\nand it's not overly excited so now\nyou've added 10% balance and so then if\nyou tell it okay today we're going to\neat healthy again today we're going to\ndo a little bit more yoga let's try yoga\ntoday let's let's skip that second cup\nof caffeine in the afternoon and by the\nway a great way to avoid afternoon\ncaffeine is just to nap okay so if you\nguys are struggling with caffeine fine\nhave your cup in the morning but in the\nafternoon just nap right cuz you're\ntired so listen to your body instead of\nignoring your body just listen to it and\ntake a little bit more rest then when\nyou wake up you'll feel probably not\neven refresh you'll feel a little bit\nmore sluggish mentally but your body\nwill get that rest which will help you\ntomorrow so this is the key thing to\nunderstand about how to make your life\neasy the first thing is that you must\nbalance your body as your body and mind\nare balanced life will suddenly become a\nlot easier second thing to understand is\nthat this balancing takes time and the\nmain thing to do is you should invest\nwhatever you can today that will make\nyour mind more savic tomorrow the third\nthing to understand is that if your mind\nis more saic it is easier to do more\nsavic things so it's kind of like a\nstring of dominoes where if I can eat\nhealthy and meditate one day do Mind\nBody practices whatever tomorrow in some\nway it'll be easier to do it again we're\nnot saying that you have to be perfect\nit's not about perfection it's about a\ntrend in the right direction and the\nlast thing to understand about making\nyour life easy is that in order to make\nyour life easy you must must be willing\nto live a hard life today there are two\nkinds of people in life the people who\nwant an easy life so they seek an easy\nlife and they avoid hardness and their\nlife becomes hard right so when you're\nsitting here and you're avoiding the\nwork that you have to do when you're not\nexercising you're not doing yoga because\nyou want an easy life you want an easy\nlife in search of an easy life you\ncreate an easy life today a life of\nindulgence a life of lack of effort a\nlife where you screw yourself over\ntomorrow then your life will be hard\nparadoxic\nthe ones who Embrace a difficult life\ntoday will have an easier life tomorrow\nand the more that you Embrace difficulty\nthe easier your life will become until\nyou reach a point where you are\nrelatively saic and as you're relatively\nsaic something magical will happen your\nbody and mind will start to listen to\nyou and if your body and mind listen to\nyou you don't need motivation you don't\nneed willpower because it is it is\ncompliant it is a well-trained animal\nwhen you tell the horse to go this way\ngoes this way and then your life will\ntruly become\n[Music]\neasy"
