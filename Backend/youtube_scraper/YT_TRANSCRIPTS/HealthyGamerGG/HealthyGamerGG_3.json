would say on a on a deeper level\nit's more like when when we say work on\nyourself that involves all kinds of of\nlike things about moving your life\nforward and they struggle with\nmotivation in these\nthings it's because when I don't think\nI'm worth\nit I'm not worth fixing\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nwhen you develop empathy and compassion\nfor other\npeople there's going to be room for\nsomeone else in the\nrelationship and then this in turn is\ngoing to reduce the feeling of being an\nH\nnow two people can\nconnect and now it's not about getting\nyour needs met and\nstarvation it's about two human beings\nforming a relationship\n[Music]\nh\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\npractice wishing for the object of your\nmet that these things happen to\nthem so you'll repeat this\nthought maybe may this person be\nhappy may this person be\nfree and may this person be at\npeace alrighty chat let's get started\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is Dr Alo kenoa just a\nreminder that although I am a doctor\nnothing we discuss on stream is intended\nto be taken as medical advice everything\nis for educational and entertainment\npurposes only if youall have a medical\nconcern or question please go see a\nlicensed\nprofessional so hello chat it has been\num a little while since we have done a\ngeneral live stream it is awesome to be\nback uh I had a slightly restful\nvacation or very restful vacation um I\nwas working a ton and it's it's really\nnice to be back um today we are going to\nbe looking at a couple of posts about\nbeing tired of working ADHD and all this\nkind of\nstuff but before we get started with\nthat um as some of y'all may have seen I\nwas recently reprimanded by the medical\nboard of Massachusetts and I think it's\nreally important to kind of talk about\nthis so the first thing to understand is\nthat this is like really really\nimportant um we've been cooperating with\na board investigation that started about\ntwo years ago it's finally concluded and\nI think that this is like a very healthy\nand fair way to do things so I know a\nlot of people like the work that we do\nand they're like oh my God like this is\nso unfair no this is exactly how things\nare supposed to happen so about 5 years\nago I saw a problem with mental health I\nsaw a degree of AOE damage that was\nbeing done where as a clinician working\nin an office I realized that like there\nis no way like the number of people who\nneed help we would need an army of\nclinicians that we don't have to try to\nfix this problem the the extent to which\npeople are suffering and the extent the\nthe Mental Health crisis that we were\nfacing required some kind of additional\nInnovation or something needed to be\ndone differently so I started streaming\nand when I started streaming I did\neverything that I could to make sure\nthat this was okay and then what\nhappened is someone filed a a complaint\nin 201 22 and this is exactly why\nmedical boards exist right so medical\nboards exist because occasionally you'll\nhave a doctor who tries to do something\na little bit different and is this okay\nor is this not okay so over two years\nwe've been investigated by the medical\nboard and we've been reprimanded but\nit's also important to understand what\nthe reprimand is for what it means and\nalso what it does not mean so the\nreprimand is for undermining The\npublic's faith in the Prof profession so\nin the board complaint and what many\npeople thought was that I was doing\nsomething wrong so this includes\neverything from being negligent or in\nsome way responsible for reckful suicide\nuh that I was streaming live therapy\nthat I was conducting the practice of\nmedicine on the internet with patients\nso this is really important to\nunderstand the board found that none of\nthose things were true so what this\npractically means is that there is a\nreprimand for undermining the public\nFaith but also that you know boards have\na lot of power right so they can do\neverything from fine me they can put me\non probation they can recommend ethical\ntraining um they can revoke my license\nthey can suspend my license they can do\nall kinds of more practical consequences\nbut they elected to do none of those\nthings because they found no cause to do\nany of those things the other thing that\nthe board can do is determine that what\nwe are doing on the Internet is the\nractice of medicine and therefore\nrequires all these other things they did\nnot find that that was true as well so\nwe've been cooperating with the board\nfor the last two years I actually think\nit has been an eye-opening humbling fair\nand excellent process this is why\nmedical boards exist because when there\nis a problem when I show up and say hey\nI'm here to help is what I am doing\nharmful in some way helpful in some way\nwhere is the line I personally feel\nrelieved that the board has gone through\neverything that we've done with a fine\ntuned tooth comb and they have placed no\nrestrictions on my license no probation\nnothing like that and furthermore and\nmore importantly no restrictions on the\nwork that we do here so theyve they you\nknow they could have said hey you\nshouldn't do interviews anymore that's\ntherapy no more streaming no more\ncontent creation this is not allowed\nthis is the practice of medicine they\ndid not find that any of those things\nwere actually applicable so I'm still\nallowed to interview people I'm still\nallowed to stream I can make mental\nhealth content on the internet and I can\nsee patients without restriction so that\nfeels really good to me now a lot of\npeople may be surprised by those\nfindings because they're like oh my God\nlike this is terrible or what we do is\nterrible and I think this is where it's\nlike really important to understand that\nwhen we started streaming we've had a\ncontinuous process of improval because\nwe take this seriously right so when I\nstarted streaming I had didn't have much\nof an idea of what I was doing and then\nevery month that goes by every couple\nmonths that go by we improve our process\nso we have a rigorous process of\nonboarding boundary setting um we have\noversight from a scientific Advisory\nBoard we've consulted with the American\nMedical Association the American\nPsychiatric association and we will\ncontinue to improve our process I think\nbecause our process is so rigorous this\nis why the board had no recommendations\non what we should do differently and no\nrestrictions on what we already do so we\ntake this really seriously and it is abs\nabsolutely relieving to have someone go\nthrough all of the information and\nbasically say there's nothing better\nthat you can be doing right now we have\nno recommendation so this is awesome\nright and furthermore no restrictions\nthe other thing that sometimes surprises\npeople is that you know a lot of people\nthought that I was negligent with\nreckful and all this kind of stuff and\nthis is where the board actually\noutlines this very clearly that I\noperated within standard guidelines\nthere's no evidence of negligence or\nmalpractice or anything like that now\nthis may surprise people because they're\nlike oh my God what I did was so bad but\nI you know I'm going to say this I've\nsaid it before but I'll I'll kind of say\nit again so one of the challenges of\nthis situation is that because someone\nhas a right to\nprivacy I cannot share everything that I\nknow about the situation right so people\nmade allegations and like in order to\ndefend myself I have to violate\nsomeone's privacy and I'm not going to\ndo that I'll never do that the good news\nthe relieving thing for me is that with\nthe medical board the the right to\nprivacy because they are a medical board\nthey reviewed a lot of Records things\nlike that right they can look at patient\ninformation and they are allowed to make\na determination after they've looked\nthrough all of the information and I\ndon't even blame people for thinking\nnegatively about me right because you\nguys didn't have all the information and\nyou can't ever get all the information I\ncan't give you the information it's just\nnot possible and that's okay right so\nthat's it's part of what being a content\ncreator is so I think this is is a\nreally important healthy process this is\nwhat oversight looks like right this is\nwhat we need to be safe is for someone\nto go through it's totally fine to\ncomplain and then the board goes through\neverything and they make a\ndetermination I think it's been an\nincredibly Fair process I'm personally\nrelieved and I'm like actually really\nhappy that I continue to do everything\nthat I've been doing right no\nrestrictions on my license or content\ncreation so I showed up here 5 years ago\nto help and I will continue to do so in\nthe same ways that I have been I will\nalso continue and we as an organization\nbecause this the other thing to\nunderstand is that this goes Way Beyond\nme right we have a scientific Advisory\nBoard we have um you know even an\nethicist on the SC scientific Advisory\nBoard we have a Content team we have an\nonboarding team we have a research team\nwe have a compliance team right to make\nsure that everything that we're doing is\nin compliance with all the laws and\nregulations and once again no findings\nof a lack of compliance with anything\nthat we do\nright so that's like really important to\nunderstand and and like we will continue\nto improve so just because the board did\nnot find any faults with our process\ndoes not mean that we are not listening\nto your feedback does not mean that we\nare not listening to your criticism does\nnot mean that we are doing a perfect job\nand that we can't do better so overall\nthis has been like honestly it's been\neye openening humbling but I've really I\nthink it's a very healthy thing this is\nthe way that things work in the world\nright when you try to do something new\noccasionally we need a third party that\nis objective that is going to look at\neverything that you do and determine\nwhat you are doing right and what you\nwere doing wrong I'm actually incredibly\ngrateful to the board I know some people\nhave been like oh my God this no like\nthat's they're doing their job right\nit's their job to make sure that I'm not\ndoing something out of line or whatever\nand then they take my license away if I\nam like that's what they're supposed to\ndo and so I'm just really grateful to\neveryone who's been helpful to us\neveryone who's given us feedback on what\nwe could be doing better everyone who's\nhelped us create the processes that keep\npeople safe in the work that we do I'm\nI'm grateful to everyone for all that\nkind of stuff right I'm even grateful to\nthe American Medical Association and\nAmerican Psychiatric association for\nweighing in in what way they could in\nour processes for our attorneys and\neveryone else and I'm grateful to y'all\nfor allowing us to do this work right so\nwe showed up 5 years ago to help and I\nthink we've done some help in that time\nand\nwe're will'll continue to do so and I\nthink that's the most important thing is\nthat we don't need to change actually\nlike a single thing about our process\neverything that we've been doing or I\nmean it's not perfect by any means but\nthe the board made no recommendations on\nrestrictions to practice or any of the\ncontent or interviews that we\ndo so I'm sure that this isn't the end\nof it um you know like I I think that\nthis is we have like posts to cover\ntoday so I think it's important to kind\nof Honor those and at the the same time\nlike this is you know I think it's\nimportant like we got to address this in\nsome way so I'm I'm really grateful to\neveryone for allowing me to do this work\nthe medical board included y'all\nincluded right I don't get to do this\nwork unless the rest of the world\ndecides that it's okay I love that on on\na Friday in the middle of the day my job\nis to talk to the internet about feeling\ntired and ADHD and you know being below\naverage IQ and how do you function in\nthe world like it's an absolute\nprivilege to do this work um it is\nabsolutely important to do this work\nbecause I still think that like what is\nhappening right now is insufficient to\nthe the systems in place are\ninsufficient to support our mental\nhealth and we see piles and piles and\npiles of evidence to that effect right\nsuicide rates are on the rise depression\nis on the rise anxiety is on the rise\ntechnology addiction is on the rise\nloneliness is on the rise touch\nstarvation is on the\nrise right thankfully we have a lot of\nother institutions that are aware of\nthese problems and trying to do\nsomething about the the office of the US\nSurgeon General the World Health\nOrganization the United Nations a lot of\npeople are trying to do something about\nthis and this is the small slice that I\nhave chosen to try to help this\nproblem you know I I hope to continue to\ndo so um I I'm I'm I feel privileged\nthat I will continue to be able to do\nthis work essentially in the same way\nthat we have been I'm not saying that\nyou know this is like I will have a\nlicense to do this for the next 30 Years\nlike we're going to continue to make\nprocess improvements right there's\nalways you can always do better and\nthat's like part of what we do here at\nHG is like continual process Improvement\nit's part of the reason that our content\ndoes well it's part of the reason that\nour coaching program does well and by\nthe way the board looked at all that\nstuff\ntoo um so I'm I'm really grateful for\nthis opportunity we're really grateful\nto y'all for being here allowing us to\ndo this work we're grateful to y'all for\nposting on the subred about the\nchallenges that you face asking\nquestions posting memes all this other\nstuff like we're grateful for all of it\nall right and uh 5 years ago I showed up\non the internet to try to help this\nproblem and thankfully after the\nconclusion of this board process I will\ncontinue to do so in roughly the same\nmanner right and I think that's really\nthe important takeaway for me is that I\ndon't have to stop right they're saying\nwhat I'm doing is okay um\nyeah\nso let's see uh let me think\nabout\num\nokay\nokay so the first thing we're gonna look\nat hold on a second let me see if I\ncan hold on chat let's mute this for a\nsecond\num let me\nsee okay I'm gonna okay\num all\nright okay\nso yeah okay so\num let's get\nstarted okay\nuh and I I'm sure that this will\ncontinue to be a topic of discussion\nwhich is fine right like so that's\nthat's healthy okay so I saw this this\nis actually kind of disturbing\nchat Dr K is Ariana Grand's Crush so\nlike someone posted this on our sub and\nI was like this is this is actually\nlike this is kind of creepy\ndude like this is creepy\nlike if I didn't know better I would\nthink I was living in The Matrix but I I\ndon't even know how to interpret this I\ndon't know how to understand this I\ndon't know um you know I've I've worked\nwith a fair number of musical artists\nactors\nactresses I I have no comment on this I\njust it kind of honestly like it kind of\ncreeped me out a little bit that that my\nface is in a music video\num who knows like I don't know what do\ny'all think about this like how should I\ninterpret\nthis this is a vampire from Twilight\nit's Dorian Gray I I don't know dude I\ndon't\nknow okay anyway this is why like when I\nsay it's a privilege to be able to do\nthis work like I think it's great that\nthere's a a meme [ __ ] post or fan art\nabout like I don't even know I don't\nknow what to do or say or how to react\nbut like how is life when you wake up\none day and there's something that's\nkind of like creepy and arguably\nflattering like I don't know if I should\nbe flattered or creeped out I don't know\nbut I'll tell you one thing it's not\nanother\nFriday okay so enough of the memes let's\nget\nstarted okay so I just want to chill for\nthe rest of my life I don't want to\n[ __ ] work and conform to societal\nstandards life is [ __ ] I'm just so\ntired\nso this is something that we are seeing\nmore and more\nof that you know this generation of\npeople like we're talking about\nMillennials gen Z gen\nAlpha is sort of experiencing this life\nwhere like they just want to chill like\nthey're tired of the hum drum they're\ntired of work they're tired of\nconforming to social standards they're\njust tired exhaustion is actually like\nthe prim Ary\nexperience now when people feel this way\nwhat happens is often times the older\nGenerations or even our own generation\nBoomers or other Millennials will say\nlike oh you're a loser for being tired\nthis is what life is you got to grind\nyou got to hustle and then the older\ngeneration will say like oh like young\nkids nowadays they don't have a work\nethic they don't have a this they don't\nhave a that so one of the things that I\nsee a lot is when people are exhausted\nof Life the most common thing that we do\nis blame them for it\nright we say that oh if you're exhausted\nin your life like this is your fault if\nyou worked harder things would be\nbetter and so the challenge that you\nknow the the the hardest thing about the\njob that I do is actually in pointing\nout that it isn't your fault but it is\nyour\nresponsibility is this conundrum\nbetween I understand why people are so\nexhausted let's just talk about that for\na second so the first thing is that jobs\nhave\nchanged so jobs have been optimized for\ndifferent things they haven't been\noptimized for you know well-being of the\npeople who are working them right so we\nhave these like\ncareers where and I think like residency\nlike medical residency is a really good\nexample of this where like we accept a\nlot of abuse in the medical resident\nCommunity because the abuse is temporary\nso I I've heard horror stories I you\nknow I ran a program where we did like\nStress Management resilience training\nfor about 600 residents and I heard\nhorror stories about abuse of attendings\nand what everyone kind of says is like\nsuck it up because it's only a couple of\nyears and then you'll leave and then\nyou'll make hundreds of thousands of\ndollars and it'll be worth it and so\nsomewhere along the way I see this also\nin banking where it's like we have the\nsaying that says [ __ ] rolls downhill so\nwhen you're at the bottom of the hill\nyou're getting the most [ __ ] and then as\nyou move up the hill you get to roll the\n[ __ ] down to the the peons\nI had to go through a crappy phase so\nthat you you you can go through a crappy\nphase too I had to do it I had to be on\nthe receiving end so it's okay for me to\nbe on the giving end we feel exhausted\nby work because work is not fulfilling\nwork is not designed to be\nfulfilling and then we also have\nsocietal expectations and this is what's\nso exhausting about societal\nexpectations see we've had societal\nexpectations since the dawn of humanity\nI'm pretty sure I mean I I wasn't there\nbut the challenge right now is that the\nsocietal we everyone has societal\nexpectations that are different and you\nfall short of all of them right I see\nthis a lot for example in\ndating so it's like you know am I\nsupposed to ask someone out or am I not\nsupposed to ask someone out am I being\ncreepy if I ask someone out am I\nviolating someone's space am I creating\na lack of safety but then on the flip\nside other people are little like okay\nlike no you're supposed to be the\ninitiator right I'm sort of thinking\nabout men\nand women have it no better either it's\nlike okay should I should I have sex\nearly or not have sex early or I don't\nknow like is this person being\nrespectful or they not being respectful\nI don't know what to expect for women\nespecially things like kids and career\nam I supposed to have a job am I not\nsupposed to have a job am I supposed to\nhave kids am I not supposed to have kids\nand the problem with Society right now\nis that everyone has strong societal\nexpectations that are different and you\ncan't make everyone\nhappy so if you're a woman who decides\nto have a care\ninstead of\nkids some people will be like Yay good\njob and other people be like when when\nare you having your kids when are your\nkids hey when are we getting\ngrandkids right and we we have on the\nflip side we have men who are like okay\nlike men are supposed to express their\nemotions it's okay to feel your emotions\nit's okay to express your emotions\nexcept for anger because if you're an\nangry man you're a threat and you're a\ndanger and women have it no better with\nanger either because women areed\nsupposed to be docile they're supposed\nto be kind they're supposed to be polite\nthey're supposed to be empathic and if\nyou're a woman in the workplace who gets\nangry you're a [ __ ] you're evil oh my\nGod can you you have a specific term for\nan angry woman\n[ __ ] right what what we don't have a\nterm for an angry man so I don't think\none gender has it better than the other\nI think the key takeaway here is that\nSociety expects so much of us you should\ngrind you should work hard but by the\nway you should also be happy and\nmeditate you you should have a work life\nbalance but you should work twice as\nhard right like it this is the problem\nis everyone expects so much from us you\nshould be fat you should be thin oh yeah\nwe should have body positivity but we\nshould also all get in\nshape right like how are you supposed to\nwin this game it's impossible to win and\npeople are\ntired so if you look at the research on\nburnout one of the the key factors of\nburnout I want to say number one cause\nbut probably not one of the top three\nstatistically is not working hard see\nthis is the big mistake that the Boomers\nmake they look at our generation and\nthey say y'all aren't working hard it's\na problem of work ethic that's\nincorrect this generation is actually\nthe hardest working I think\nstatistically right we work way more\nhours than people used to the cause of\nburnout and the cause of exhaustion is\nworking futile\nso when you work really hard and you\nhave nothing to show with it this is\nwhen you get\ntired so the problem with living up to\nexpectations society's expectations is\nthat you are actually doing a good job\nof living up to half of society's\nexpectations you are 100% satisfying\nthis group of people but this other\ngroup of people is still unhappy with\nyou and so then what do we do we want to\njust check out I'm done I just want to\nchill I don't want to do the rat race\nanymore and people are mentally checking\nout all over the\nworld in the US we call them neats not\nin education employment and\ntraining in parts of South America or\nSpain they're called\nnin in China it's called laying\nflat right we're not we're mentally\nchecking out of this so if you're\nsomeone who's exhausted by life what do\nyou do what's the solution\nhere so the solution is actually quite\nsimple but it's very\nhard and that's that you can't live for\nthe sake of a job and you can't live for\nthe sake of making Society happy you'll\nit'll never work you never make Society\nhappy because there's a basic issue with\nhuman beings which is that the more that\nyou do for human beings the more they\nwill want\nsee most human\nbeings if I help you with your laundry\nonce you will want me to help you with\nyour laundry again and then you will\nwant me to help you with your laundry a\nthird time and then you will start to\nexpect me to help you with your laundry\nand then if I don't do you a\nfavor not only is there a complete\nabsence of gratitude there develops a\nsense of entitlement and along with that\nif you stop doing me the favor then I\nget mad at you hey I need you to work on\nthis Rush project it needs to be done at\nthe end of the\nweekend and then once you do it once\nthey expect you to do it again they\nexpect you to do it a third time right\nnot everyone is like this thankfully\ngood people are out\nthere so what do we do about this so\nthere's one fundamental problem that we\nhave which is that at some point we\nstopped listening to\nourselves and we started paying more\nattention to the external world and why\nis this happening so if you look at the\nhuman being today there's a couple of\nreally interesting scientific and\npsychological changes that are happening\nand this is more of a yogic perspective\nnow okay there's science to it to it as\nwell we'll talk about that the first is\nthat if you look at where your attention\ngoes your attention goes to the\noutside so where am I getting\ninformation about what I should do in\nthis world so most of the the\ninformation that we're getting is from\nthe outside because I'm watching these\nTik toks I'm listening to some random\nguy on the internet talking about how I\nshould live my life and this very\ninspiring\nmusic yeah and you got to work hard you\ngot to\nCME right or you listen to stuff that\nreally emotionally resonates me yeah all\nwomen are this or all men or this and\nthat makes you feel good right and you\nkeep on scrolling you're like yeah\nsubscribe like tell me more about how\nwomen are bad or men are\nbad so we go on looking at like feeding\nourselves this diet of of literally\nmanufactured [ __ ] I guess not\nliterally\nmetaphorically right these these short\nform content pieces and things like that\nand like this is the way the world is\nright this is why people say go out and\ntouch\ngrass and so our attention is outside of\nus and this is something that's very\nimportant to understand if you look at\nthe way that the human being evolved the\nhuman brain evolved our attention was\nwithin us for like half the day so for\nthe majority of human history we've had\nwe've been doing like rot tasks so we\nwould go out foraging we'd go out\nhunting and then we'd have to walk back\nfor two and a half hours and during the\nwalk back we've got no headphones we've\ngot no podcasts to listen to We would\nhave some degree of conversation but\nlike what are you talking about for like\n2 and a half hours on a one-way trip\nevery single day you can't there's not\nenough to\nsay so what a lot of human beings would\ndo is pay attention to themselves and\nfundamentally what has happened in our\nsociety today is we've gotten\ndisconnected from our own internal\nCompass because literally our mind and\nour attention is outside of us for the\nmajority of the day see I used to have\nthis trap of being\nefficient and being efficient is one of\nthe worst things that you can do so when\nI was in med school I was like oh my God\nI got to be efficient I would wake up in\nthe morning and I would start putting on\nsome podcast while I did some exercise\nwhile I was in the shower while I was\ncooking breakfast I was listening to\nsomething and then on the way to the\ntrain I would be listening to a lecture\non the train I'm reading a textbook when\nI get off the train headphones back in\nlistening to a lecture for the 12-minute\nwalk to the school then I go sit down in\nmy lecture hall I open my notes I start\nreading I in CL in class all day I go to\nwhatever likes my study sessions or\nwhatever and then it's the headphones\nback in being efficient listening to\nnon-fiction learning languages I'm\nalways efficient efficient efficient\nefficient\nefficient no time for boredom no time\nfor idleness no wasted\ntime and so what I noticed is that over\ntime right so thankfully I had the\nopportunity to study for a few years in\nIndia I started to notic well hold on a\nsecond this is weird I'm losing sight of\nmyself I feel disconnected from\nmyself because I'm not spending time\nwith me I got conf refused my grades\neven weren't that good and then I\nabandoned all of\nthat I started paying attention to\nmyself I started studying fewer hours a\nday and my grades went\nup see the basic problem with finding\nanswers about you from outside of you is\nno one knows\nyou no one has the degree of information\nabout your internal environment that you\nhave no one understands your thoughts\nyour emotions your drivers your\nmotivations as well as you\ndo and so then what happens is we have\npeople who offer Solutions like myself\noh do this this will help\nyou right but my solution is never going\nto map 100% On To\nYou therefore it is going to be\ninefficient as you consume more and more\ninformation about productivity and habit\nformation and this and that all that's\nstuff is good I'm not saying it's bad\nbut I'm saying that that is\ninsufficient to build a life where you\nfeel Joy where you have a lot of energy\nand you feel good about what's going on\nyou're progressing it's not going to\nwork now this problem has gotten way\nworse over the last 10 years because a\nsecond thing has started to\nhappen and that is that the uniform\neffect of all of this technology is\nemotional\nnumbness internal numbness\nwe shut down our amydala in our\nhippocampus every time we Doom scroll\nevery time we play a video game if we\nwatch pornography even if you do\nsomething like watch a live stream all\nof the stuff will will shut down your\ninternal signals so not only are we\nexternalizing our attention we are when\nwe externalize our attention we are\nactually numbing\nourselves and when we numb ourselves we\nlose sight of\nourselves and when we have a void Within\nbecause we don't know what we want right\nand I hear this all the time when I'm\nlike working with people like in my\noffice like well what do you want and\nthey're like I don't know what I want\nlike that's the problem I don't have any\nmotivation like this seems like a good\nidea I'm kind of curious about this this\nseems cool so even if you listen to\npeople's language what you find is it's\nvery externally oriented it's not I care\nabout this I want to build this one day\nI want this sometimes you'll have some\ndegree of\nfantasy but it's not internal it's like\noh this seems like a good idea I think I\nwould be a good fit for this profession\noh making video games like would be\nfun so it's not like information about\nwhat I actually know about myself it is\na hypothesis about the external world\nand the external World by the way loves\nthis so the external World Loves when\nthere's a void within you and you don't\nknow what you want and this is where we\nget to the of societal expectations\nbecause if you don't know what you want\nif you don't know how to develop\nconfidence in your life then the world\ncan tell you hey buddy you're un you\nlack confidence you don't like the way\nthat you look buy this thing it'll\nhelp and so if you really look at like\nwhat people what happens to people is\nthey're pulled in a thousand different\ndirections right today I'm told oh I\nshould have work life balance tomorrow\nI'm told I should hustle more today I'm\ntold I should have kids and that I can\ncan do it all and you can be a boss babe\nyou can have kids and a career and then\nyou're also told oh like you shouldn't\nhave kids and anti-natalism and this and\nthat like everything is crazy all the\ntime and so what ends up happening to us\nwe get pulled in this direction we get\npulled in this direction we get pulled\nin this direction we have no\nanchor we are literally pulled away from\nhere away from here away from here where\nis our anchor our anchor should be here\nfrom within us\nand the science behind this is\nbeautiful so when someone who is\naddicted to a substance decides in\nhere hey I'm done with this\n[ __ ] they're able to gain sobriety the\nmajority of people who become sober do\nso without any medical\nhelp and if you talk to these people\nwhat they'll say is they'll say one day\nI woke up and I realized enough was\nenough this is the strength that\nlacking right because when you have an\ninternal compass in my case I had an\ninternal drive I was going to be a\ndoctor\nhopefully and so I applied to medical\nschool 40 rejections in year one applied\nyear two 40 more\nrejections 80 rejections year three 39\nrejections one\nacceptance if I was relying on society\nand by the way Society tried to tell me\nto\nquit right people told me bro you've\napplied to for 2 years 80 medical\nschools you've gotten two\ninterviews not a single\nacceptance you should quit you should do\nsomething else go to the Caribbean get a\nPhD do something\nelse so Society will give you Reasons to\nQuit not just Reasons to Quit reasons to\ndo something else right oh do this thing\ndo this thing do this thing be this way\ncolor your hair this way buy this\nthing so the internal fortitude to defy\nsociety's\nexpectations comes from understanding\nyourself see this is another subtlty\nthat I think is very easy to\nmiss I don't want to work and conform to\nsociety's standards there's a subtlety\nhere which we need to talk\nabout which is that when you con to so\nwhen you don't conform to society's\nstandards how do you feel it hurts it\ndoesn't feel good to conform to society\nstandards you don't like\nit and so then what do you do you\nconform to society's\nstandards right so I was working with a\npatient\nonce who had a sibling who was\nlike not The Golden Child well older\nsibling and then older sibling had a\npretty tragic accident\nand so the parents understandably\nstarted caring for that sibling quite a\nbit but then something weird something\ntoxic started to happen everything was\nabout this\nsibling right and as this sibling poor\nsibling poor person could not finish\nUniversity could not get a job could not\ndrive could not participate in\nrelationships right was really paralyzed\nliterally so of course what do the\nparents do the parents start caring for\nthis\nperson and then something toxic started\nto\nhappen which is that as the younger\nsiblings started to\nachieve oh we can't really celebrate\nthat because it's going to make your\nsibling feel bad when you graduate from\ncollege we're not going to hold a party\nbecause you know it'll be hard on your\nbrother your brother won't be able to\nhandle\nit right it it we're not going to no you\nknow I'm I'm glad that you got a new car\nbut we're not going to advertise it it's\ngoing to be tough on your brother your\nbrother's been through so\nmuch and so all these societal\nexpectations right familial expectations\nhey you shouldn't be this way don't\nadvertise and the real tragedy of living\nup to uh societal expectations is that\nthat doesn't make you\nhappy see when you live up to societal\nexpectations all you feel is relief you\ndon't feel pride pride comes from\nwithin so this is the problem of\nsocietal expectations if you don't live\nup to them you feel disappointed in\nyourself you feel bad and even if you do\nlive up to them all you feel is relief\nyou're never never getting your head\nabove water right it's just we're just\ngetting right to the\nsurface it's a lose lose situation and\nwhen we play this lose lose game no\nwonder we're\ntired and if you look at people people\nwho are content at life there's\nabsolutely studies that show that you\nknow there's a certain amount of income\nthat correlates with a positive quality\nof life my personal read on that is that\nthere's a certain amount of very\nobjective stress which resources can get\nrid\nof security can be countered by\nresources but resources cannot create\nfulfillment or sorry lack of\nsecurity right so resources give you a\ncertain amount of security and that is\nthe found foundation for\nhappiness so it's very hard even when I\nwas in India many years ago people would\nsay you can't meditate on an empty\nstomach and if you kind of think about\nit see people think that\nmonks have given up life and that their\nlife is very difficult because they've\nthey've given up all of their material\ndesires hard to be a monk right no the\nexact opposite the most secure and safe\npeople on the planet are monks\nthey have the easiest lives people say\noh my God it's so hard you can't watch\nvideo games or you can't play video\ngames you can't watch TV you can't have\nsex isn't it hard to give up life no the\nmonks have the easiest Planet life on\nthe\nplanet want you understand why let's\nthink about this I stayed in an\nusham I woke up meditated for a while I\nwalk into the dining hall and someone\ngives me food I don't pay for\nit I walk in at lunchtime someone gives\nme food I don't pay for it I walk in at\ndinner time someone gives me food I\ndon't pay for it I go to my dormatory at\nnight I have some somewhere to sleep I\ndon't pay for\nit think about\nthis monks have utter security their\nmeals are paid for their clothes are\npaid for usually they even have cell\nphones that are paid\nfor they live on the charity of others\nand this is the crazy thing they're the\nbiggest mooches on the planet and we\nrespect them for it like what the [ __ ]\noh you're a monk\noh tell me yes take money yes oh you're\nare so\ngreat [ __ ] hobos living on our dime\nthat we\nrespect right it's crazy so you really\ncan't meditate on an empty stomach and\nthe monks have figured this out and\nthankfully as a society we've been kind\nenough to to support monks I'm not\nsaying don't support monks I think it's\ngood it's\nhealthy right cuz the problem is that\nyou you don't get to eat some ocas or\nsome Michelin star restaurant so you do\nhave to give up quite a lot but if you\nreally look at security they are very\nsecure they don't have to worry about\nwhere they're going to be living 10\nyears from now they don't have to worry\nabout how to put food on the table for\nthe next decade people give them free\nstuff like Medical Care and it's great\nso the problem with life right now is\nthat like we're disconnected from\nourselves we're trying to live up to\nthese societal expectations even if you\nwork really hard you're not working for\nyourself you're working to make someone\nelse happy at work or at home or\nsocietal\nexpectations and so like it's never\ngoing to\nwork and the solution is I think\nhonestly\nmultifactorial so there's a lot of stuff\nthat we in Society need to do right so\nit's not just on you and I think this is\none of the biggest\nchallenges of trying to help individuals\nis when I work with patients I I you\nknow we talk\nabout oh like you know like you can do\nthis and you can do this and like if\nyou're having trouble with dating like\nwe can work on your confidence but the\ntruth of the matter is that as a\npsychiatrist like I can't change the\nworld that my patients live\nin and if you look at if you really look\nat the\ndata the most most influential thing for\nyour mental health is the world that you\nlive in it is nothing about what you\ndo so there are some really profound\nstudies on adverse childhood experiences\nor\nAces and what we find is that the\ncrappier your childhood is the more\ntimes you move the more times your\nparents get divorced the more times you\nget abused the shittier your mental\nhealth is going to be and the shittier\nyour life will be your circumstances\ncreate so much power in your life in the\neast we call this Karma and Karma cannot\nbe\nescaped this is the truth of it we need\nsocietal change that's why I started\nstreaming in the first place because I\nfound it to be\ninsufficient to help people one at a\ntime we need to change the whole\nsociety now the challenge is that if we\nneed to change society are you screwed\nand that's where thankfully the answer\nis no so this is another mistake that I\nthink a lot of people make is that they\nsay Okay society sucks fair enough right\nI don't disagree and life is hard and\nyet the real tragedy of the situation is\nthat like who's going to take\nresponsible for fixing the society that\nyou live in I'm going to do some tiny\npart I encourage yall one day to do some\ntiny part we'll talk about that\nlater but the real challenge the real\n[ __ ] scam of being alive in the world\ntoday\nis that you're fighting an uphill battle\nthat you have to carve\nout\nhappiness success\nmotivation you have to carve it out of\nthe society that we live in it's not\ngoing to give it to you in fact it's\ndesigned to take it away from\nyou and this is the real tragedy right\nso when I work with a patient I'm\nthinking about one patient in\nparticular who has bipolar disorder\nand we were talking about how\nchallenging it is to live with bipolar\ndisorder they were like you know this is\nnot fair like why am I like this I do so\nwell for about 18 months and then I have\nthis manic episode I spend $80,000 dig\nthrough all of my savings buy all the\nstupid [ __ ] start gambling ruin my\nrelationships [ __ ] up my job this isn't\nfair and what am I supposed to say to\nthat as a\npsychiatrist right I can't say I mean\nthere are a lot of people out there who\nare kind of anti- Psychiatry and like\nyou know like oh yeah like it's all\nexcuses that people make and like you\nknow these are just\n[ __ ] I I don't subscribe to that I\ndon't think it's\nfair it's not your fault but it is your\nresponsibility you're the one who has to\nlive with it right this is a reality of\nyour\nlife and people aren't understanding\nabout mental health they're not\ncompassionate about mental health that's\na real it of the world that we live\nin thankfully yall are starting to\nchange\nthat and so what we need to do is take\nresponsibility for whatever we can do\nand this is the crazy\nthing the crazy thing is that when I see\npeople do this it is very\neffective you'd be amazed I mean I I\nthink you will be amazed because I've\nseen people who are lost and behind and\nhate society and I've seen them rise to\na place of happiness and success and I\nsee it\nconsistently all you really need to do\nis tap into\nyourself right start to connect with\nthis and I think this is our first\nanswer which is going to be somewhat\ninsufficient because this is a whole\nprocess in in Dr K's guide to trauma we\ntalk about this process of how you get\ndisconnected from yourself literally\nwhat happens in trauma is we form some\ndegree of emotional numbness we have\nthis process called hemispheric\nlateralization which results in things\nlike literally dissociation and\ndepersonalization there's a process to\nreconnect with\nyourself and you must reconnect with\nyourself you must listen to\nyourself This is\ncritical and as you listen to yourself\nwhat makes this hard what makes this\nhard is because the [ __ ] in there is not\ngood there's this old story from Hindu\nmythology\nwhere somewhere along the way there were\na group of Devas which are like\nangels and asuras which are like\ndemons so back before there were humans\nthere were the dasas and the asuras and\nthese people are in\nconflict and somewhere along the way\nsomeone told them hey at the bottom of\nthe ocean is\nambrosia that will if you drink it you\nwill have\nimmortality and so the deas and asuras\ndecide to have a truce and they're like\nokay we got to get this stuff from the\nbottom of the ocean how are you going to\nget it from the bottom of the ocean they\ndon't have\nsubmarines so what they start to do is\nchurn the\nocean like I have a good idea how do you\nbring something from the bottom to the\ntop you Churn\nit right let's create some\ndrama so they turn the ocean but before\nthe Ambrosia comes up poison floats to\nthe surface and they're like oh crap now\nthere's poison at the top someone has to\ndeal with the poison\nand so it ends up that Shiva takes the\npoison and he stores it in his throat he\ndoes this weird thing where he just\nholds it in his\nthroat and it's also like the symbol of\na powerful yogic practice called a\nthroat\nlock and then once the poison is is\nremoved then comes the Ambrosia and I\nthink this is a beautiful analogy for\nwhat I see as a therapist before you get\nto the pot of gold at the end of the\nrainbow it's not a pot of gold at the\nend of the rainbow\nit's a a [ __ ] bow it's a lot of [ __ ]\nwith a pot of gold at the end see a pot\nof gold doesn't exist at the end of the\nrainbow it's not beautiful beautiful\nbeautiful beautiful reward it's [ __ ]\n[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]\nreward in therapy what we do is we dig\nin the process of discovering confidence\ndiscovering motivation discovering\npassion we have to work through a lot of\ncrap I don't know why it is this\nway but the negative ity is on the\nsurface and the goodness is\nunderneath right we have this also in\nthe hero's journey where we have to go\nthrough trials and tribulations to\nattain success at the\nend and this is the basic problem that\nwe have is anytime people start to do\nintrospective work anytime you stop\nnumbing yourself what do you experience\nnegativity lack of confidence shame fear\nall of these negative things come up\nwhich you suppress through your\ntechnological\nusage and so what we need is\nperseverance with\nintrospection you got to keep going\nright and this is why thankfully we have\nprofessionals we have tools\npsychotherapists are fantastic at this\nsometimes coaches do this work but\ncoaches are more about accomplishing a\nparticular thing and then if there is an\ninternal barrier overcoming that barrier\nfor the sake of\naccomplishment whereas a therapist this\nis my simp simplistic understanding a\ntherapist is more interested in not\nnecessarily accomplishing a particular\ngoal doesn't mean that they can't be\ngoal focused but generally speaking\nwe're interested in healing not\naccomplishing and so a coach will be\nmore about okay if we have to heal this\nin order to accomplish it let's do it\nbut a therapist will be focused more on\nhealing right which is why they're\nmedical professionals mental health\nprofessionals the goal is healing\nHealth not\noutcomes which is a whole tragedy in the\ntherapy profession to begin with but\nanyway conversation for a different day\nso it's going to be\nhard right and this is what's the really\nchallenging thing is we're so externally\nin outcome focused that we think what\namount of this work will lead me to\nhealth and happiness and success and the\nanswer is I don't\nknow and this is the big Paradox and\nthis is exactly the the flip that uh the\nswitch that I see flips is that\nsometimes when we start working on this\nstuff it gets hard and then we power\nthrough true we don't give up because we\nsay to ourselves this is important\nenough I'm doing this for myself this\ndoesn't help anyone but me it's not to\nget a promotion it's not to make someone\nhappy I'm doing it for me I'm tolerating\nthis pain and suffering for me and the\ntragedy of the world is you can tolerate\nas much pain and suffering as you want\nfor other people but they will never\ngive you the gratitude that is\ncommensurate for what you've\nsacrificed tell me I'm wrong I would\nlove to believe I'm wrong no one will\nappreciate you as much as you\ndeserve go if you guys disagree prove me\nwrong this has been my\nexperience so in order for you to be\nworth it you have to be worth it for\nyourself I'm making this sacrifice for\nme I'm dealing with this crap for me I'm\ngoing to connect with who I am the\nbeautiful thing is once you connect with\nwho you are there's data on this as well\nthat once you have internal drive for\nsomething right this goes back to the\ncompeting interest in overcoming\naddiction once you have a reason in here\nthis is worth it for me I have decided\nwhat I\nwant then the amount of mental fortitude\nyou have is\nmindblowing literally metaphorically\nmind-blowing so I'll work with people\nwho are addicted to alcohol and I don't\nknow if you all understand this but\nalcohol withdrawal is lethal\nis\nlife-threatening when you withdraw from\nalcohol you have these things called\nGaba receptors and when you drink\nalcohol the alcohol goes to your Gaba\nreceptor and activates the Gaba receptor\nnow the Gaba receptor tones down the\nactivity of the\nbrain so it slows everything down makes\nit harder for your neurons to trigger an\naction potential dulls you out and then\nwhen we drink lots and lots and lots of\nalcohol we bomb bar our Gaba receptors\nand our Gaba receptors start to down\nregulate so we have a we're basically\ndisabling the break in our\nbrain and the reason that we're still\nable to function is because we have so\nmuch alcohol swimming around that the\nalcohol is like an artificial\nbreak so once we remove the alcohol our\nbreaks no longer work because we were\nrelying on the alcohol to slow down the\naction potentials an activation of our\nbrain which means that when we no longer\nhave a break on the brain the neurons\nstart hyperactivating they bounce back\nbecause they used to be suppressed by\nthe alcohol it's a rebound effect and\nthis literally causes\nseizures\nbut if you all know medicine you know\nthat action potentials don't just exist\nin neurons they also exist in heart\nmuscle electrical conductance is how the\nheart pumps in unison there's an\nelectrical signal that goes through our\nventricles and causes all of the muscles\nto\ncontract and so when we withdraw from\nalcohol the heart muscle can also\nseize and when the heart muscle seizes\nwe\ndie literally that's a\nliteral alcohol withdrawal can be\nfatal now this is important to\nunderstand when your body is\ndying it will let you\nknow it will send the most powerful\nsignals that it can to tell you hey\ndumbass\ndrink otherwise we will die your body is\nvery\nsmart and so the process of overcoming\nalcohol withdrawal is Conquering the\nmost powerful signals that your body\nwill send you these are signals which\nhave built over millions of years of\nevolution to preserve\nlife it doesn't start with straight\nseizures it starts with shakes it starts\nwith agitation it starts with Cravings\nit starts with dry mouth it starts with\npalpitations as your body starts the\nprocess of dying through\nseizures it tries to control it the\nneurons want to seize the heart muscle\nwants to seize that's what a palpitation\nis it's not beating normally it's\nmonitoring that and it sends you signals\ndrink drink drink drink it's getting\nworse it's getting worse I can't handle\nthis we're going to die we're going to\ndie we're going to\ndie and what is it that allows people to\nconquer\nthis it is internal\nfortitude it is saying I'm going to do\nthis even if it costs me my life\nthat degree of strength is what's\nmissing this is why life is hard this is\nwhy we lack motivation we lack this\nconnection to our s we have a void\nwithin us that has been created through\nliving up to external expectations and\nnumbing ourselves through technology not\nto mention substances like alcohol and\nmarijuana and we in this void the rest\nof the world fills it in there's no\nfortitude we're completely disconnected\nfrom where where our perseverance and\nstrength comes from and when we connect\nwith that thing it is literally makes a\nhuman\nbeing so\nfocused and have such a degree of\nwillpower and motivation that they can\nconquer these\nsignals now thankfully in the case of\nalcohol withdrawal we also have people\nlike medical professionals who will do\nthings like push Ivy Adavan which will\nkeep us from dying and will also calm\nsome of those signals down what we do in\nin medicine thankfully\nis we titrate people off right so we\ngive them the amount of Gaba support\nthey need so we start off with like 10\nmigs a day and then we go to 8\nmilligrams a day and then we go to 6\nmilligrams and then 4 milligrams and 2\nmilligrams and then we're off so over\nfive or six days it's a rocky thing but\nwe can give the body time to acclimatize\nso that alcohol withdrawal is no longer\nlife-threatening that's the right way to\ndo it also feels way\nbetter right so don't go trying to\nwithdraw from alcohol by yourself like\nthat's it's Medical dangerous I would\nstrongly recommend you go to a medical\nprofessional but these are the issues at\nplay and we have a society of people who\nare\ntired and why are you tired because you\nhave no energy where does the energy\ncome from energy comes from in\nhere you can't be externally motivated I\nmean people try to rely on external\nmotivation you can't have some degree of\nexternal motivation but when we're\ntalking about going the distance the\nproblem with external motivation is it\ncomes from the outside which means if\nyour environment changes your motivation\nchanges with\nit it's not sustainable so people will\ntry to craft an environment that creates\ntheir motivation and this is\nclever but it's not\nideal see people who craft their\nmotivation craft their environment to\ncreate motivation you are still\nsurrendering control to your\nenvironment and if the environment\nchanges then your motivation will change\nwith\nit people who date a\npartner because they lack confidence in\nthemselves and this person tells me I'm\nbeautiful this person tells me I'm\nwonderful therefore I feel good about\nmyself it is a short-term solution that\npropagates the long-term\nproblem instead let the confidence\ndevelop from\nwithin now why is that hard because when\nI go digging within what do I find I\nfind\nshame I find a lot of lack of\nconfidence so if you're someone who's\ntired of the world tired of living up to\nsocietal\nexpectations tired of work and you just\nwant to\nchill connect with yourself that's where\nchillness comes\nfrom there's a whole different\nconversation maybe we can go into it if\nyall want but what is the nature of\nchillness\nliterally where does chillness begin and\nwhere does it end chillness is about\ncontentment in\nhere am I chill with one beer or two\nbeers or three\nbeers see chillness is an an internal\nexperience and that's where we need to\nexplore so some people will say oh my\nGod I hate working 8 hours some people\nwill say I hate working 12 hours I'm\nhappy to work 24 hours I'm chilling I\nlove being on call\nI like working hard on\ncall I like that time at like 2:30 in\nthe morning when I step outside of the\nhospital and everything is quiet maybe\n3:30 I've got my pager with me so if\nsomething happens I'll get paged and I\nwalk back in but the whole world is\nasleep and I go to the roof of the\nhospital and I just step outside and I\njust look out wherever I\nam go to the upper levels of\nMassachusetts General Hospital and look\nout over the Charles River why the whole\nworld is asleep it's a beautiful\nexperience and then I get paged so and\nso is\nconstipated like all\nright time to help this person take a\n[ __ ] if you you're a doctor and you've\nbeen on call you know what I'm talking\nabout right the 330 Pages for\nconstipation and if you don't know what\nI'm talking about you're very lucky and\nyou've got a good day team that manages\nconstipation and you don't get paage for\nit that's good you should be paging me\nfor heart attacks and seizures not\nconstipation but then I worked with\npeople who had constipation and\nconstipation can be\nworse okay\nquestions the whole world is not asleep\nyeah we're not asleep but we're you're\nnot visible from the top floor of a\nhospital how do you find what you like\nwithout trying you have to try who said\nthat there's no\ntrying how do you connect with yourself\nokay okay these are all great questions\nall right how to overcome the need for\nexternal validation and\nbelonging okay so a lot of people\nstruggle with being addicted\nor dependent to external validation or\nbelonging and I want to ask yall a\nsimple\nquestion how do I become independent of\nthe charity of others to feed\nme how do I no longer become dependent\non other people's pantries for food I\nhave to have my own Pantry that's\nstocked see you only need external\nvalidation when you are not happy with\nyourself external\nvalidation is when there is a lack of\ninternal validation when you are\nconfident in the work that you're\ndoing when you believe in the work that\nyou're doing when you are happy with the\nwork that you've done right so sometimes\nI'll get patients who are upset with me\nthey'll be like Dr K I've been\ncoming I've been coming to you for 6\nmonths and I'm not cured yet you're the\nworst doctor on the planet you've been\nscamming me you've been doing this and\nlike this and like you should have done\nthis different you should have done this\ndifferent people will come and be very\nupset with\nme and oh my God like this is my patient\nI care about this person I've been\nworking so hard it'll normally it'll\ntear you\napart right and it's important as a\ndoctor I think this is a big mistake\nthat we make as a profession we don't\nlisten to those people\nenough so we should listen listen to\nthose people and I I think I try to\nlisten to those people they may\ndisagree right so I I take what they say\nseriously like CU if you're six months\nin and you're not happy like maybe I'm\ndoing something wrong I could there's no\nquestion I could have done something\nbetter because I'm not perfect there\nmust be something I could have done\nbetter tell me what I could have done\nbetter tell me tell me please I'm here\nto help but even that approach comes\nfrom an internal\nconfidence right the only way to\ntolerate that that kind of thing is for\nme to feel good in\nhere see\nnarcissism involves a dependence upon\nthe opinions of others this is why\nnarcissists can't tolerate criticism\nbecause if you tell me that I am a bad\nperson I don't feel good on the inside\nso your opinion determines my\nreality narcissism is about insecurity\nit's insecurity that's root cuz if I\nbelieved in myself I don't need your\napproval so how do we get\nindependent of external\nvalidation we have to be confident in\nourselves we have to have internal\nvalidation this is why in Psychotherapy\nwhen we have someone who has an\ninsecurity this is oftentimes confuses\nthese people because the therapist will\nsay nice things to you they'll say like\noh like you know it sounds like you\nworked really hard for that and then\nthey get really skeptical right you're\nlike you're just [ __ ] you're saying\nthat because you're my therapist you're\ntrying to be nice you don't actually\nbelieve\nthat think about that for a second right\nif you ever been skeptical of like\nyou're like nah therapist is just being\nnice so hold on a second we got to\nunpack\nthis the first is that why are you\nskeptical of what the therapist is\nsaying\nright because you don't believe it\nyourself if I tell you hey I think\nyou're pretty and you're like are you\ntrying to trick me are you going to make\nfun of me am I on camera somewhere I'm\nnot pretty I'm not good-looking see when\nyou believe something about yourself and\nyou get contrary evidence there's data\nabout this right cognitive bias we\ndiscount contrary\ninformation it's because you don't\nbelieve me then you find the reason then\nthe mind is like I they're saying that\nbecause they're a therapist but it\ndoesn't matter whether they're a\ntherapist or not you disbelieve the\nstatement to begin with then your mind\ngoes and looks for logic that allows you\nto disbelieve it because the therapist\nsays oh I think you did a good job\nyou're like you're just saying that\nbecause you're my therapist but if\nsomeone else tells you you did a good\njob you do the same thing your parents\ntell you oh you're my\nmom a random person on the street tells\nyou oh hey I think you did a good job\nand you're like this person may believe\nit but what about the other hundred\npeople your mind will find ways to to\ndisable\nit so if you want to get off of external\nvalidation the first thing you need to\ndo is recognize this pattern what do you\ndo that allows you to ignore the\npositive signals from\nLife the second thing to understand\nabout this and by so let me finish about\nthe therapist thing first so what we're\ndoing in therapy by the way is not\ntrying to convince you that you're a\ngood\nperson that's not our job what we're\ntrying to do is teach you a way of\nlooking at\nyourself we're trying to\nModel Behavior about\nself-confidence so when I say something\nto someone in therapy my goal is for\nthem to be able to say it to themselves\nin the future the goal of therapy is for\nyou to leave see a lot of people think\nthat oh people want to create therapists\nwant their patients to be there forever\nbecause you're milking them for money I\ndon't really think that's the case I\ncertainly don't most of my colleagues I\nwouldn't say do that a shortage of\npatience I don't need you to stick\naround like 6 months weight list more\npatience than the therapist on the\nplanet can ever\nsee so the goal is to get you to leave\nand how do we get you to leave we train\nyou to think about yourself in a\nhealthier way now then the question\nbecomes why aren't you thinking about\nyourself in a healthier way because you\nwere taught not\nto see when you were growing up and you\nwere developing your sense of self\nsomeone or something around you taught\nyou that you are a piece of\ncrap that you don't deserve praise that\nyou're\nugly they made the core of you to lack\nconfidence and this is important to\nunderstand this is not the default\nstate so if you just observe a child\nwho's one year old 2 years old 3 years\nold child has no shame child doesn't\nwear care about wearing clothes they\ndon't care if their junk is out there\nthey don't care if they've got food on\ntheir\nshirt they don't care if their haircut\nis good or\nbad children are content at\nBaseline they have confidence at\nBaseline that's why they're so\nstupid right kids will like oh like I\nsaw this video of like this kid jumping\ninto a a sewage\nhole right and like why do kids do\nstupid things because they're confident\nin themselves they don't realize that\nthey're impervious that they have you\nknow so kids will walk up to strangers\nthey'll talk to strangers they'll do all\nthis kind of stuff there's some amount\nof stranger anxiety and stuff which is\nbuil built\nin but confidence is the default State\nshame is\ntaught right so when I was growing up it\nwas literally called I don't know if you\nguys are like brown or if this is in\nother cultures or if this is just my\nfamily sham\nsham oh your VV is hanging out that is\nsham sham Shame Shame sham Shame Shame\nShame sham means you should be ashamed\nof yourself this is shame this is shame\nwe teach shame we have to teach\nit and depending on your upbringing you\nwere taught a lot of Shame your\nconfidence was\nshattered and then once your confidence\nbecomes shattered then you require other\npeople to feed it right now your water\npipes are broken so you need to get\nwater from someone else carry buckets of\nwater and often times when we're growing\nup if you really pay attention this is\nreally sad but like people do that on\npurpose like subconsciously maybe but\nlike it's intentional right\nsubconsciously intentional because when\nthey can make you feel bad about\nyourself they have power over\nyou and that feels good to them in some\nway because they feel powerless in their\nown lives so the more powerless I feel\nthe more I need to exert power on the\npeople around me to make make myself\nfeel\npowerful this is why we have Petty\ntyrants in the\nbureaucracy these are people who feel\nlike cogs in a machine they don't have\nthe ability to exercise whatever they\nwant to in their life they want to\ncreate some kind of policy change it\ntakes 18 months these people feel\npowerless in their life so what do they\ndo they Lord it over the poor saps who\nend up in line in front of\nthem always always respect Petty\nbureaucrats always give them as much\ndeference and respect as you can because\neven though they're tiny little cogs in\na big machine they can destroy your life\nbe polite to receptionists be polite to\npeople who you talk to after you've been\non hold for 15 minutes it's not their\nfault customer service people teachers\nthey're not beneath\nyou these people deserve respect give\nthem respect or they will punish you for\nit\nso often times we grow up with a petty\nTyrant who destroys our\nconfidence and when they destroy our\nconfidence then we are dependent on\nother\npeople so what we need to do is regain\nthat internal confidence really look at\nthe Hard parts of yourself look at the\nthings that you lack confidence on and\ndo something about them and by do\nsomething about them let's say that I\nI'll walk y'all through it okay so\nthere's take an action and then this is\nthe really important part it's not just\nabout the action because a lot of people\nwill take the action but they don't do\nthe Second Step which is more\nimportant then what you need to do is\nwatch for and counteract the cognitive\nhabit that comes afterward the\nvasana so I'll give you all an example\nlet's say I don't feel good about my\nbody so then I go to to the gym because\neveryone's like oh go to the gym okay\nI'll\ngo going to the gym is only 25% of the\nbattle it's not even half then it's what\nhappens when you go to the gym what your\nmind does when you go to the gym and\nwhat your mind does after you go to the\ngym it starts making comparisons oh\nyou're so out of shape oh you're so\npathetic and then you leave and you're\nlike I'm never coming back that's where\nthe real\ndamages so I see this a lot for example\nlike with people who are hopeless right\nsometimes people will come to my office\nand they'll be hopeless like I've tried\neverything I went to this doctor I did\nthis I worked with the dating coach I\ngot plastic surgery I did\neverything nothing\nworks see we can change as much as we\nwant to in the outside world but if we\ndon't change the inner response no\namount of external change will be\nsufficient and I know this sounds like\noh like change yourself on the inside no\nlet's just be [ __ ] practical for a\nsecond okay if you have someone who is\nunhappy in life no amount of gifts will\nmake them\nhappy and I I bet you money that y'all\nknow this because you've tried\nit you've done kindness after kindness\nafter kindness for this person they're\nstill not happy they say oh I I don't\nlike this I I you know I don't get the\ngood food you give them the good food oh\nI don't have friends you invite them\nsomewhere you try to help them over and\nover and over again and nothing seems to\nwork let's think about it scient ific Al\nhow is this that's because only half of\nit is the action the other half is the\ninternal response the cognitive\nresponse the yogis discovered this\nthousands of years ago when they\ndiscovered a vasana a mental habit a\nmental reaction that discounts external\naction thousands of years later Aaron\nBeck rediscovered\nit right he said hold on a second\nthere's a cogn bias at\nplay so for anything that you lack\nconfidence about take the action but\nwhat the internet fails to tell you is\nthat the action is just half the battle\nit is the mental response that you have\nand watch yourself and think about this\nfor a second right so I went to the gym\ntoday and I walk out and how do I feel\nabout myself pathetic this was a mistake\nthere's the\nproblem when progress becomes a mistake\nyou will stay stuck for the rest of your\nlife going to the gym is a mistake if\nyou feel unhappy about your body what\nthe [ __ ] illogic is\nthat this is why we stay stuck it is not\nbecause of the lack of action it is\nbecause not understanding what our mind\ndoes and so by all means go see a\ntherapist by all means check out what we\ndo on the membership side where we\nexplain these more advanced yoga concept\nceps like Vasa by all means just pay\nattention to\nyourself by all means you look at this\non your own you don't need anyone's help\nhelp\nhelps\nlook and ask yourself one\nquestion what is the progress that I\nmake that my mind thinks is a\nmistake that wasn't intended to rhyme\nbut it came out nicely\nand this one thing will transform so\nmuch of your life like it's crazy man\nhow much how hard we sandbag ourselves\nand this by the way is why I have faith\nthis is why I show up\nhere right I look at this picture and I\nknow we've been talking about this for a\nwhile I just want to chill for the rest\nof my life I look at this and people\nlike oh my God my life is so hopeless my\nlife is so hopeless I I get that it is I\nI mean I'm not disagreeing with you but\nyou're also driving with a flat tire\nyou'd be amazed I mean the reason I\nbelieve this stuff is not because I'm Dr\nK I believe this stuff because I've seen\nit I believe this stuff because I was a\n[ __ ] loser who didn't know how the\nhell to live life and I learned a couple\nof these things and it's been night and\nday but then I thought to myself you\nknow being trained in epidemiology like\nmaybe it's a sample size of one you\ncan't rely on this stuff right maybe I\ngot lucky and I certainly did then I\nstarted teaching it to other people and\nit's like wow this is pretty cool it\nworks consistently\nand then I realized one day I was like\nam I really on to something crazy\nno this isn't that transformative all\nwe're doing is teaching someone how to\nuse the\ncontroller if you're playing a game and\nyou don't know what the buttons do you\ndon't know how the you know what the\ndamage calculation is you don't know the\neffect of armor\nreduction you don't understand things\nlike effect of\nHP you don't understand like you're you\nknow You' got some [ __ ] Elon Musk\nElden ring build and you're going\nthrough life you know no hate on Elon\nMusk I think his Elden ring build is\ngreat you guys know what I'm talking\nabout right like no wonder you're\nstruggling and then if you start to\nlearn like how this stuff works if you\nstart to realize holy crap my mind is\nturning progress into a\nmistake no wonder life is\nhard like some of the people that I work\nwith are trying to drive a car that's\nstuck in neutral gear and they're\nslamming on the gas pedal and they're\nlike hey everyone says that the gas\npedal moves things forward but it\ndoesn't seem to work for me and it's\nlike yeah you're right but that's\nbecause we're missing something so\nunderstand yourself understand how the\ncontroller Works understand the Game of\nLife understand the\nmechanics and then your life will\nchange great questions\nshall we move\non man so many good questions how do I\nknow what I will like when I find it you\npay attention to yourself right and this\nis so it's like so crazy that like this\nis a question but you pay attention to\nyourself so this is a a people will\nwonder okay how do I\nknow what I like and so this sounds kind\nof weird but you know I I learned this\nlesson from patients that I work with\nwho are\nhomosexual so I was once working with a\npatient and you know he was an older\ngentleman he's from the south he was\nhappy to work with me because I too was\nfrom the south he wasn't interested in\nany of this New England woke\nstuff\nright dude has been gay his whole life\n60 years just doesn't doesn't realize it\nor he realizes it he just doesn't like\nit right and so when you when you talk\nto people like this and it's kind of\nlike you know I'll ask a set of\nquestions and it's you know when you\nwatch pornography what kind of\npornography do you watch when you\nfantasize about sexual relationships\nwhat do you what goes through your head\nright and and like we know what we we\nknow what we like\nour body and our brain tell us right so\nthis person had come because he had some\ndegree of erectile\ndysfunction turns out that is erectile\ndysfunction is because he's just trying\nto have sex with people he's not\nattracted\nto right they don't have the right\nparts and so if you really like pay\nattention to yourself your body and your\nbrain and your internal experience will\ntell\nyou the challenge is that we judge\nourselves this is why it's hard it\nsounds so\nsimple but the problem is once again a\nVasa a cognitive\nreaction so if you don't know what you\nlike in life if you don't know what you\nwant in life there are two things to do\nthe first is cut back on your\nTechnologies use ideally for an extended\nperiod of time so spend two or three\ndays off the grid if you can go for a\nweekend camping somewhere\nbecause those neurological signals of\nsuppression of internal experiences will\nbe like very it'll be hard you're\nplaying the game with a handicap the\nsecond thing that you need to do is look\nat\nself-judgment the thing that is the most\nconfusing about understanding yourself\nis self-judgment because you have an\nimpulse and you judge it and you swat it\ndown and since you are actively\nsuppressing it through\nself-judgment you'll never discover that\nyou like like it you'll never discover\nthat it matters to you so I was working\nwith someone else who was once dating\nsomeone who is less attractive than they\nwere less attractive in a lot of\nDimensions so a woman who is dating a\nman who is not as physically attractive\nmade 15% as much money as the female\npartner and the female uh the lady was\nmy\npatient she's like I don't know what I'm\ndoing with guy he's a loser he's this\nhe's this she comes in and she complains\nabout him every week like why don't you\nbreak up with him I don't\nknow right the more that we get to it\nthe more that we realize that she\nactually likes him that's why she stays\nwith him some Primal part of her some\ndeeper part of her is like I like this\nperson he makes me happy and I've dated\nlots of people who are more successful\nwho don't make me happy he prioritizes\nme he cares about me he makes me laugh\nwhat's the problem the problem is the\nself\njudgment the problem is I should be with\nthis kind of person the problem is the\nsocietal\nconditioning so if you want to\nunderstand what you like there's a\nreally really really good thing that you\ncan do which is pay attention to your\nself judgment and it doesn't necessarily\nmean that whatever you judge is\nsomething that you like but that's a\npoint of\nexploration and what you will find is\nsome of the things that you love the\nmost are things that you judge yourself\nharshly for so I'll give you all a good\nexample some people love to dance but\nthey suck at it and so they are afraid\nof dancing they're like I have no rhythm\nI never grew up learning how to dance or\nI love to sing but I feel\nembarrassed right you know you love to\nsing you know you want to dance you know\nthat you want nothing more than be\ngraceful on the Dance\nFloor you know nothing more than you\nwant to be able to sing freely but what\nkeeps it your self judgment you're bad\nat\nthis and one of the most tragic things\nabout not understanding what we love is\nwe do not allow ourselves to love what\nwe are bad\nat it's a tragedy that Society does not\nallow us to be at\nthings and so we go on discounting\nwhat's happening with is us over and\nover and over again whatever you judge\nabout yourself that should be\nexplored okay now I really need to get\nmy act\ntogether\num because this is just one post and we\nhave got like 30 minutes left but how do\nyouall let's do more posts right\nchat let me see if I can do\nthis\num thoughts on camine\naddiction\num\nokay okay one okay let's let's move on\nto post okay thoughts on Kine\naddiction do I want to answer that okay\nlet let me do this I'm going to show\nyouall what the next post is and then\nwhat we are going to do is we are going\nto do this thing called ask\nchat this\none no okay I don't know yo yall need to\nchill no\nquiet okay let me do this real quick so\nhere's the next\npost I want to do this one for sure\nokay I get a job I can't stand this\nanymore I quit I need a job to survive\nwe're going to talk about how to break\nout of the cycle but before we do\nthat\num what do ketamine addiction or cycle\nof job and\nquit all right let's vote real quick\nchat one of the\nadvantages okay so cycle of job and quit\nis winning pretty heavily okay so no\nsurprise the team here at HG selected a\nlot of great posts that we will focus on\nokay so I I love doing Q&A and and it's\njust been a while but\nokay\num all right so we're going to do this\nwe're going to do this and I'm G to\npause this and I'm GNA pay attention to\nchat okay I know sugar Danny is saying\nketamine sorry sugar Danny all\nright I get a job I can't stand this\nanymore I quit I need a job to survive\nso this is a cycle that a lot of people\ngo\nto okay go through sorry and the problem\nwith this cycle is that it's a\ncycle and so what happens is that if we\nlook at Cycles the basic problem with\nCycles is that we go through them over\nand over and over again and if we think\nabout why do we go through a cycle over\nand over and over again like\nfundamentally like what's going on right\ndoes that kind of make sense like why\ndoes this\nhappen so the reason is\nbecause a cycle is driven by particular\nthings the reason that we end up going\nthrough the cycle is because we're\nactually continuously\nresponding to certain emotional\ndrivers and if we kind of look at this\nokay here's what's going on right so\nlet's take a look at this real quick so\nI get a job\nI can't stand this\nanymore okay so what we're going to do\nis take a look at this I can't stand\nthis\nanymore I\nquit I need a\njob so for any cycle to continue it\nrequires an energy\ninput okay so this is like important to\nunderstand anytime we're making a\nmovement it requires energy input and\nthe reason that this cycle is so common\nis because it actually has the same\nenergetic\ninput each of these steps actually\nincreases energy in a particular way and\nthen once that energy reaches a critical\nthreshold then we that energy drives us\nto\naction and breaking this cycle is\nactually relatively simple but it can be\nvery difficult and what we need to\nunderstand is not these\nsteps we need to understand the\narrows because what actually propagates\nthe cycle it's not the steps it's the\narrows does that make sense this is\nwhat's moving us from here to here so\nthink about this for a moment I get a\njob the real money is not that you get a\njob it's what happens over here that\nallows you to not I can't stand this job\nanymore and if you can't stand this job\nwhat results in the\nquitting if you quit what results in the\nnot needing the job so often times what\nI find is that when people are in\nCycles what they tend to do is they\nactually miss the important\nstuff right so I I keep on like I can't\nfind someone I can't find the right\nperson I keep on dating the wrong people\nand it's\nlike I'm lonely\nI need to date or I date\nsomeone I date this\nsomeone this\nrelationship is\nunhealthy or doesn't feel\nright I break up\nright we can see these\nCycles this happens a lot\ntoo or I got to get out of the house I\ngo out of the house I try to socialize I\nfeel anxious so there a lot of these\ncycles and everyone focuses on these\nsteps but that's not where the money is\nthe money is right\nhere and the reason for that is because\nwhen human beings correctly diagnose a\nproblem they fix it if a problem\npersists that usually means there is\nincorrect diagnosis same is true for the\nmedical profession that's how we learn\nthis stuff if I diagnose you with the\nwrong thing and I keep treating you\nyou're going to keep having\nproblems so if we want to\nunderstand what drives Us in this cycle\nof getting a job can't stand this\nanymore quitting and I need a job what\nit is is our\nemotional\nmotivation we are victims to our\nemotional motivation which is why we\npropagate this cycle okay so let's\nunderstand\nthis so the first thing let's start with\nI need a\njob so when you need a\njob what is what is going on here we're\ndesperate I need a\njob right you're not selecting a job it\nis a move of\ndesperation and when you're making a\nmove of desperation so you're so\ndesperate so like now I'm like I have\nsome amount of money the money starts to\nrun out the desperation starts to\nrise and as the desperation reaches a\ncritical threshold it triggers a\nmotivational action which is find a job\nthe Panic signals happen find a job find\na job find a job so I find a job I go\nwalk down the\nstreet oh look it is a\njob so if we look at it what is it that\ndrives me what is it that results in a\njob it is desperation so the moment that\nI have a\njob the desperation\ndisappears right I no longer need a job\nI have a job I need a job I have a\njob and then what starts to\nhappen well how did I pick my job well I\njust picked what I needed to because I\nwas desperate there's no selection of\nthe\njob and then what happens is this job\nisn't great so then what happens is like\nthe emotional negativity starts to build\nup my boss is not the best the hour suck\nthe commute is too long negativity piles\nup piles up piles up until I am\ndesperate I can't stand this\nanymore and once again what is it that\nmotivates us\ndesperation so then what do I do I\nquit once again\ndesperation and now that I quit what\nhappens I bake through I burn through\nwhatever savings I have I need a job\ndesperation increases increases\nincreases so as long as you are living a\nlife where desperation is driving you\nyou will accept the bare minimum it is\nabout getting by today and if your\nemotional strategy if your life strategy\nis getting by today you are going to get\nbodied right left and Center you will\nnever build a life that is worth living\nif your goal is getting by if your\nmotivation is the avoidance of\ndesperation you will never build a happy\nlife because your goal is not Joy your\ngoal is not success it is I want to get\nrid of this and this by the way is the\nway that our whole medical profession\nhas trained us to be\nwe have a society that focus focuses on\nfixing problems not building\nthings we need to fix the homelessness\nproblem we need to fix oh you have pain\nlet me give you Ibuprofen that'll take\nthe pain away temporarily now you're\ndesperate take this pill when the pill\nwears off take another pill when the\npill wears off take another pill take\nthese six pills every single day don't\nbuild\nHealth right you'll never find a gym in\na doctor's office you'll never find a\nmeditation room in a doctor's\noffice right the most shocking example\nof this like I you know I talk about\nthis a lot because it just really seared\nin my mind I was on vascular surgery\nrotation and the patient was coming in\nfor the third\namputation and the attending surgeon\nthat I walk I work with comes in he's\nlike here we are again this guy has\nliterally removed pieces of this\npatient's feet\nand he's like you know this is going to\nkeep happening while you qu keep smoking\nright you got to stop smoking and she's\nlike yeah doc I know I'm so sorry lops\noff a piece of her\nfoot gives her a\npamphlet here's how smoking is dangerous\nfor\nyou literally dude like [ __ ] I was\nlike my mind was blown I was like is\nthat the extent of this conversation hey\nyou know this is going to keep happening\nuntil you stop\nsmoking let's activate the saw and\nremove the foot I was like what the\n[ __ ] I was a thirdeye medical student at\nthe time couldn't say a damn\nthing burned in my\nmind and you can even argue if fairly so\nby the way I'm not blaming the surgeon\nbecause it's not the surgeon's\njob right the surgeon's job is to Lop\nthings\noff it's not their job to do smoking\ncessation\ncounseling but they put an order for it\nand a nurse shows up while you're in the\nhospital and gives you some resources\ndoes a decent\njob but this is what happens in our\nsystem is we fix problems we don't\ncreate Health we just fix what is broken\nand if in your life you are constantly\nfixing what is broken you'll never break\nout of the cycle\nbecause you're not banking\nanything so the cycle of desperation\ncontinues your primary motivation is\ndesperation I need a job let me find\nsomething so how do we break out of the\ncycle we break out of the cycle by\nliterally breaking out of the\ncycle okay so we're going to show you\nall what I mean\nso okay I need\na\njob so I get a\njob I can't stand\nthis here's what we need to do find\nbetter\njob when the desperation is at a low you\nshould keep looking for a\njob okay\nI can't stand this\nanymore I quit when the desperation is\nat a high I'm going to work with a\ntherapist or\ncoach to stay\nhappy and in the\njob while I find a better\njob this is how we break out of\nCycles right we literally find\nAlternatives but the problem is that\nthis is\nhard why is it hard well first of all\nthe economy sucks right so the deck is\nstacked against you let's remember that\npeople who wind up in the cycle are not\nhere because they're stupid they're here\nbecause things are genuinely hard if if\na bunch of people find themselves in a\nwith a problem right like we look at\nlike malaria malaria affects a bunch of\npeople in subsaharan Africa does it mean\nthat they're dumb no does it mean that\nthey're weak no it means that there's a\nlot of mosquitoes with malaria if a lot\nof people are experiencing this in our\nsociety today it means that there's a\nsocietal problem the first of the\nsocietal problems is that we are\ntraining people to be emotionally\nresponsive\nMercurial we get motivated by our\nemotions and this starts very\nearly right if you don't study you're\ngoing to\nfail starts very early where we try to\nincentivize people from fear and\nDesperation if you don't do this you're\ngoing to get bullied or we bully you\nbecause you're not wearing the right\nclothes so now you're motivated to dress\nbased on the avoidance of negative\nemotion this is how we live our lives\nthrough the avoidance of negative\nemotion and people who are very\nmanipulative love this because they\nrealize if I can create negative emotion\nin you I can control your\nbehavior we see this a lot with the men\nthat I work with or I see this a lot\nwith the men that I work with where we\nguiltrip men for\nproviding it's a man's job to provide\nhappens with women\ntoo with cognitive load and\ngroceries oh my God don't get me\nstarted right so we do this a\nlot and so the challenge though is that\nwhen we talk about finding a better job\nit's not that easy because first of all\nthe economy\nsucks it's getting better at least here\nin the\nUS but there's a second problem which is\nthat what is it that motivates me to get\na job this is fueled by\ndesperation and why don't we find a\nbetter job because when we find a job\nwe're already exhausted I've applied to\n300 jobs I'm\ntired now the desperation goes away I\ncan't motivate myself to find a better\njob let's be honest it's not as that\neasy\nright so then this cycle continues I\nquit and then what happens is I feel\ndesperate so even this is a\nproblem because now what's happening is\nour\ndesperation creates the sense that I\nneed a job and since I have a\ndesperation I find the first thing\nthat'll come I'm not\nselective and if I'm not selective for\nmy job what am I going to do I'm not\ngoing to be able to stand it\nthis desperation here and\nhere inevitably creates a situation that\nyou cannot\nstand this is how you break out of the\ncycle first of all\nrecognize that what propagates the cycle\nneeds to\nchange if the driving force behind the\ncycle changes the cycle will\nend right so when two people people when\nthere's a blood\nFeud which we don't have much anymore\nright but I guess take your your\nfavorite streamers that beef\nregularly right so we still have\nsomething like blood\nfeuds the streamers that beef\nregularly what's driving the cycle of\nblood feuds it's\nVengeance right there's no forgiveness\nthere's no compassion there's no admit\nwhat I did wrong everyone both sides did\nsomething wrong but what do they focus\non they focus on what the other side did\nwrong they never own up to their\nmistakes I've been in beef with people\nbefore generally speaking it goes a long\nway to say hey buddy I screwed up in\nthese\nways I'm\nsorry and then they something cool\nhappens right when you apologize to\nsomeone\nif you're lucky they apologize back yeah\nI know man I wasn't the best either it's\nlike what the [ __ ] did we just do here\nyou did this wrong you did this wrong\nI'm sorry I'm sorry like what the it's\nthat\neasy but some of y'all will say but it's\nnot that easy because I apologize and\nthey say yeah screw you and they don't\naccept responsibility fair enough those\npeople exist\ntoo and then what you do is distance\nyourself\neven when you apologize to someone who\ndoes not apologize back you've taken\nsome energy out of that cycle CU you're\nnot aggravating them and then they'll\nget less aggressive and over time what\nyou want to do is just don't feed the\ncycle let this plant wither and\ndie but don't give it\nfertilizer and in the cycle of the job\nand so then over time you want to let it\ndie and then what you're going to do is\nfind other relationship ship where\npeople are apologetic when they do\nsomething wrong they accept their\nmistakes and then your energy is going\nto go over there you will literally\nspend less time thinking about this\nperson this person may try to aggravate\nyou right CU they're trying to put\nenergy into the cycle but now your\nenergy is somewhere else you just let\nthem leave them behind they can have\ntheir life you're going to have yours\nthis is how you escape toxicity through\nforgiveness and\ndistance still not as easy I'm as I'm\ndescribing I recognize\nthat right this is the sketch of the\nstrategy that\nworks going back to the job thing we\nhave to escape this energy of\ndesperation see even if I need a job if\nI'm able to be\npatient and wait for the right\njob can I manage that desperation a\nlittle bit\nbetter when I when this job sucks can I\nbuild my resilience a little bit can I\ntry to improve the job a little bit can\nI seek some degree of help can I get\nsome kind of support we have to change\nwhatever fuels the\ncycle and then yall may say okay so like\nwe can reduce the desperation this is\nwhere working with a therapist or coach\nor someone like that right we have\ncareer coaching where they're pretty\ngood at this kind of stuff right helping\nyou understand where your motivation\ncomes from sometimes it just it it's\nmore efficient to work with someone\nright I don't need to ever work with a\nplumber I can do everything by myself\nbut it's just easier to use a plumber\nsometimes because it'll get done within\n24 hours and if I try to do it myself\nwho knows how long it'll take if you DIY\nit and we're a society that has still\nunderappreciated the value of working\nwith someone else who specializes in\nhuman\nbehavior right so you'll see this a lot\nfor example like you know I gave a talk\nat indeed a couple years ago and they\nhave like a on staff coach and Google\nhas a whole coaching program I think\nright so they have like these internal\ncoaching programs because they figured\nout like holy crap like this actually\nhelps when I went through my Executive\ncoaching certification like half the\npeople in the room were like HR\nprofessionals so people have figured out\nthis stuff\nhelps but the main thing to understand\nis if you're stuck in the cycle it's\nusually driven by desperation and you\nneed to break out of that desperation\nreduce the desperation as much as\npossible now a lot of people may get\nconfused by that because they're saying\nif I reduce the desperation then I won't\nact you won't act in the same way so\nonce you remove the desperation it g it\nmakes space for another kind of\nmotivation so this is where once you\nhave a job what do you like about it\nwhat do you dislike about it can you\nstart to be a little bit more proactive\nand take on projects that may be more\nengaging to be more involved at your\nwork paradoxically to work\nharder so this is something that a lot\nof people Miss is that like when you're\ndesperate and you take a job and you're\nlike\nG your mental lack of Engagement is what\nmakes it\nuntenable so if you look at studies\non health of a relationship especially\nwithin the first 6 months\nwhat you find is that someone's attitude\ntowards the relationship heavily\ninfluences the health of the\nrelationship the attitude that someone\nhas if someone thinks oh this is a\ncrappy relationship I settled for this\nperson the relationship is going to be\nunhealthy faith in the relationship\nliterally determines the quality of the\nrelationship it's not the other way\naround this is what a lot of people get\nconfused they think oh yeah I have faith\nin the relationship because it's good\nit's actually scientifically the reverse\nI have faith in the relationship that\nmakes it good I have faith in a job that\nmakes it better I believe in this that\nmakes it better and we know this this is\nPlacebo I believe this medicine work it\nmakes it work [ __ ]\nweird right so notice the cycle of\ndesperation reduce your desperation as\nmuch as possible create\nspace for another kind of motivation to\narise\nexperiment a little bit and don't get\ncomplacent do you guys understand that\ndesperation and complacency are part of\na cycle they're the same thing they're\ntwo sides of the same coin once the\ndesperation goes away what am I left\nwith am I left with Joy Drive motivation\nno I'm left with complacency and when\nthe complacency goes away I'm left with\ndesperation this is not just a problem\nof desperation this is a problem of\ncomplacency so pay attention to this\ncycle work on the desperation make space\nand actually put forth more effort don't\nlet your effort be tied to your\nemotional desperation separate these two\nvariables the more you do that the\nbetter things will\nbecome questions\num so Rockwell is asking do you think\ncoaching is a Hidden Gem in a world\nwhere people don't appreciate such ones\nthat work with human behavior so people\nwho do work with coaches may have an\nadvantage in the society I think that's\ntrue absolutely right so the the\ncoaching outcomes research is not great\nas a field but I think that there's a\nreason why you see a lot of these\ncompanies investing in coaching because\nthey have internal metrics which are not\npublished but even at like so I you know\nI did a little bit of work at like\nHarvard Business\nSchool and they have like an internal\ncoaching staff at [ __ ] Harvard\nBusiness School like it's\ncrazy um so I I think that there is an\nadvantage but we have to be a little bit\ncareful because we don't have large\nscale studies showing exactly what the\nimpact of coaching is so we have like\nour own internal data that we presented\nat American Psychiatric association\nabout our core coaching program and\nspecifically around technology addiction\nbut a lot of this stuff we don't really\nhave good science right we have the the\nstart of good science but it's nowhere\nnear as robust is what we have in the\nmedical\nfield\num okay so should I quit my job if I'm\ntoo kind of person after I work harder I\nget new tasks while other people are\nslacking since I do it never mind stupid\nquestion I don't think so so this is a\nreally common problem where here I am\nadvocating that yall work\nharder and what a lot of people will say\nis that I work at a job where there are\nSlackers and I work hard and this work\ndoesn't get\nrecognized I've certainly worked in\nplaces like that\nbefore and this is where there's kind of\nlike a dual approach to to this so on\nthe one hand if you work extra hard\nconsistently over time and I'm talking\nabout 6 months a year 2 years because\noften times what happens is our ego gets\nin the way so now that I've been on both\nsides of the table right so for example\nlike when you when you're a medical\nstudent and you're rotating somewhere\nyou think that the residents and interns\nare like oh they don't appreciate my\nhard work and like this other person got\nhonors and I only got a high pass this\nis unfair\nso then being an intern or a resident\nyou begin to realize that oh like one\nmedical student is not really aware of\nwhat the other medical student is\ndoing so they think that they're working\nhard but they're actually slacking off\nbased on my view so one of the biggest\nchallenges is that this idea that I'm\nworking harder than my colleagues gets\nreally tricky with ego because the ego\nwill see how hard you work but it won't\nsee how hard other people work a really\ngood example of this is you look at any\nrelationship and you ask the person\nwhich one of you like Works harder to\nmaintain the relationship which one of\nyou apologizes more which one of you\napologizes first on average which one of\nyou does more of the\nchores most relationships everyone will\nsay I do more my partner does\nless this is ego so there's a big bias\nthat I see a lot where someone will be\nlike they'll complain and they'll be\nlike but I did all this stuff and this\nperson got a better grade that's not\nfair it's like you don't actually know\nwhat the other person\ndid right and you may not be quite as\ngreat as you think you\nare so there's ego that you have to be\ncareful about when you think I work\nharder than everyone else doesn't mean\nthat you don't I'm just saying that's\nsomething you need to consider before\nyou you know judge\nsomeone second thing is when you work\nhard there are two ways to work hard so\none is if you're working hard and\nconsistently then you need to assess\nwhether the people that are around you\nappreciate that effort in some\nway and hopefully they appreciate\nit there are certain skills about\nhighlighting that appreciation making\nsure people recognize the work that\nyou're putting in there's also a very\ncommon problem that we see a lot which\nis um so you know we have a career\ncoaching program where\nuh you know like this is a really common\nproblem hard work doesn't necessarily\ncorrelate with\nvalue just because you're working hard\ndoesn't mean that it is useful to people\nthis is a big cognitive bias that people\nhave if the harder I work the more\nvaluable it should be that's not always\nthe case so we worked with Ethan Evans\nwho is like a senior VP at Amazon ran a\nteam of like 800 people launched Amazon\nPrime video\nand Ethan was like you know the hard\nwork should be in the\ndirection of what your direct report\nwants having a pet project that they\ndon't care about that you work really\nhard on isn't necessarily\ngreat and the third thing about working\nhard is that I tend to work hard in ways\nthat benefit me so this is a pet\nproject so in 2015 when I was a seconde\nresident I started asking people about\nvideo game\naddiction and I started to work on video\ngame addiction no one really\ncared I applied for a chief resident\nposition didn't get it best thing that\never happened to me right people didn't\nappreciate the work that I do but I\ndidn't care because this is something\nthat I am building for its own benefit I\nwrote a book in\n2018 on video game addiction a whole\nbook it's never seen the light of day\nbecause it's a piece of\n[ __ ] work that I did that was extra has\nno external value except I learn except\nI gain a competence which has a ton of\nvalue so it's okay to work hard I'm a\nbig fan of working hard I think most\npeople should probably be working harder\nI think they should also be working\nsmarter the two aren't mutually\nexclusive you know people say work\nsmarter not harder I don't think it's\nwork smarter and harder\nso I think when it comes to working hard\nlike it can be good but it needs to be\ndone in the right way so the one thing\nto avoid is if someone asks you to work\nextra hard in an area that doesn't that\nyou're not interested in that doesn't\nbenefit you in any way and they don't\nappreciate the work that you do I think\noccasionally it's okay right if someone\nasks you for a favor I think you can do\nsomeone a solid help out a little bit\nthat's\nfine and the way that I think about that\npeople ask me for help all the time I'll\ndo it doesn't help me but it's fine I'm\ngoing to make the world a better place I\ndon't have to get compensated for every\nlittle for for every minute of work I\ndo but at the same time if they're\nasking a lot and then they're like oh\nyeah like we need you to fulfill do\nthese two jobs and over time that\ndoesn't change or they don't acknowledge\nthat then that's a\nproblem so I don't think it's about\nkindness I think it's about really\nthinking about okay are you working hard\nhard is that being recognized and are\nyou growing in some way because of it\nbecause it can have an additional\nvalue okay let's do one\nmore great\nquestions why should gifted kids have\nall the fun you've heard of the gifted\nkid child to burned out adult pipeline\nnow get ready for the below average\nchild to the already given\nadult\npipeline\nso here on the channel we tend to talk a\nlot about gifted\nkids but what we don't talk about\nis Ungifted kids we don't talk about\npeople who are below\naverage and I've worked with a lot of\npeople who are below average especially\nin terms of IQ right so one of the cool\nthings about being a psychiatrist\nis you work with people who have things\nlike diagnoses of developmental delay\nyou work with people who have diagnoses\nof like intellectual disability you work\nwith people who have diagnoses of\nschizophrenia which can lead to\ncognitive problems over time like a\ncognitive decline over time you work\nwith people like I've had patients this\nsuper cool so I'm I'm so grateful I like\ntrained at Mass General in mlan and the\ncool thing is like people with weird\nconditions from all over the world fly\nacross the world to be treated at these\ninstitutions so I've even worked with\npeople with things like William's\nsyndrome fascinating condition so\nWilliams syndrome is a chromosomal\nabnormality that results in a couple of\ninteresting features so there's some\namount of intellectual\ndisability there is their brains are\ndifferent in a way to where they have no\nfear of like strangers so they're\nincredibly friendly with everyone\nthey're the nicest people on the planet\nthey have no conception that like you're\ngoing to hurt them in some way so we all\nhave like this circuit in our brain that\ncauses us to like pull back a little bit\nthey don't have that the other really\nfascinating thing about William syndrome\nis\nsomehow this constellation of things\nalso results in some people with\nWilliams syndrome with perfect pitch so\nthey're musical\nsavants you can play like without any\ntraining you can play a particular key\nand they can like tell you what it is\nthat's weird brain is\ncool so if you're someone who's below\naverage IQ has developmental\ndelay often times what happens is you do\npoorly early in life and then you have\nthis destiny that is laid out for you\nright because the smart kids do well and\nif you do well in school then you go to\na good college and if you go to a good\ncollege you get a good job and if you\nget a good job you make a lot of money\nif you make a lot of money you are more\nattractive on The Dating Market you find\nthe right person and then you have\nbabies and you go on vacations and then\nyou surf and then you buy this car and\nthen all of this life starts with\ngrades\nso as you start to struggle at the\nbeginning you are told implicitly and\nexplicitly that you will suck at life\npeople will literally give you FS people\nwill tell you you will go nowhere people\nwill tell you this is what you need to\ndo to be\nsuccessful and then this creates the\nidea in your mind that you are doomed to\nfailure unfortunately there's something\ncalled the no sibo\neffect and the no sibo effect is the\nopposite of the plus sibo effect so the\nplus sibo effect is if I believe that\nthis medicine will help me and I take\nthe pill I will get more\nhelp belief creates outcomes\nthe no sibo effect is also the same\nprinciple belief creates outcomes but if\nI believe I am doomed to failure I will\nactually fail it increases the\nlikelihood of failure when you control\nall other\nvariables and I see this a lot in the\nclients and patients that I work with\nlike especially people who are not\nnecessarily intellectual disability but\nI I've worked with people with below\naverage IQ for sure right and they go\nthey approach a job interview or a\npromotion opportunity thinking like oh\nI'm going to not do\nwell I'm going to fail at this and this\ncreates a greater chance of\nfailure so there are a couple of things\nyou need to understand if you're someone\nwho's not below average\nintelligence about your success and\ntrajectory the first thing to understand\nis that IQ to a certain degree\ncorrelates with external success and\nmedian income but is not nearly as cut\nand dry as people think\nso the first thing is that if you look\nat the people who make in the top 1% of\nearners in the\nworld they are actually not as\nintelligent as like the top\n10% okay this is really interesting so\nIQ correlates with income on the\nwhole but the smart the the most\nsuccessful people are actually not the\nsmartest\nit's not that they're not necessarily\nthe smartest it is literally high IQ\ntops out at a certain point and then if\nyou really want to become a top 1%\nearner it's not IQ that gets you from\n10% to\n1% now if you look at what results in\nsuccess in your job success in life it's\nso much more than\nIQ so your EQ matters a lot\ntoo how kind you are how reliable you\nare how much people like\nyou see human beings are Community\norganisms and there are a lot of things\nthat correlate or there are a lot of\nthings about just being likable and\ncaring about other people and putting\nyour effort in the right direction that\nis incredibly\nrewarding so I remember when I was uh\nthird or fourth year medical\nstudent we had a student that rotated\nwith us who was very\naccomplished sorry when I was a third\nyear third or fourth year resident we\nhad a medical student so what happens I\nI did one of these we have these things\ncalled away rotations so if you want to\napply if you want to go to a very\ncompetitive program usually like a top\nfive program what a lot of people will\ndo is you will do an audition rotation\nso as a medical student I did a one\nMonon audition rotation at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital so if you look at like\nyou know the the top programs in the\ncountry you show up there for a month\nyou have your application on paper but\nthen you actually work there for a month\nand you let them get to know\nyou and in my case that worked\nout so I landed a spot\nthere sometimes though what happens is\nyou have these candidates that show up\nthat are so stacked their resume is\nstacked\nexcellent test scores tons of\nPublications prior experience good\ngrades they they look like God's gift to\nEarth and then when the time came around\nto talk about this person we were like\nhey like you know what do yall think\nabout this person a lot of us had\ntrouble articulating because there's\nnothing wrong with them they were very\nintelligent they knew a lot of\nstuff and so we were having difficulty\nlike none of us were like we like you\nknow like this person we couldn't fault\nthem but none of us were enthusiastic\nand that's where brilliant one of my\nattendings just [ __ ] brilliant\npsychiatrist I won't say their name\nbut brilliant psychiatrist she's like I\nwould not want to teach that person for\nfour years she's\nannoying this is what what of my\nattending said I would not want to teach\nthis person for 4 years and she said I\nwouldn't want to be on I I wouldn't want\nto supervise this person on call I don't\ncare how smart she\nis right so it blew my mind just how\nclear they were with their language what\nthey understood this person is\nannoying and we we're here talking about\na meritocracy is it okay to not select\nsomeone because they're annoying I think\nabsolutely right like annoying matters a\nlot in the world and like I love the way\nthat she said that because I was think\nto myself like I I don't enjoy teaching\nher I don't enjoy it and when we're\nreally thinking about selecting a group\nof people who you are going to be in the\ntrenches with with working 80 hours a\nweek on call for 24 hours and the [ __ ]\nis hitting the fan the emergency room is\nfull of people there's a guy who's high\non meth who has just been put into\nrestraints there's another person who's\npsychotic who do you want to be in the\ntrenches with it's not necessarily the\nperson who has the best\nanswers it's the person who is the\neasiest to work with it's the person\nthat you can rely on not the smartest\nperson one of the most important lessons\nI learned in residency be a good person\nto work\nwith right big irony is who knows I may\nnot\nbe right you'd have to ask the people at\nHG\nso if you're not the smartest person\nunderstand that there are many ways that\nyou can advance pretty far and I've seen\neven medical students who are in my\nopinion probably average or even below\naverage IQ and they can actually do it\nit's hard right so their ability to\nassimilate and analyze information is\nsuboptimal but the good news is that a\nlot of being a doctor is not just about\nknowing the right answer it's about not\nbeing an AS ho and also I know so many\ndoctors who are so smart but are so\narrogant that they do not listen to the\npatient they make judgments based on\ntheir\nBrilliance and I am sure that I've been\nguilty of this too here I am criticizing\nyou I'm sure I have I'm sure I've had a\na day where I was thinking egotistically\nwhere I was annoyed by the patient where\nI was H having a tough day\nand the reason that I know this is\nbecause I have made that mistake that's\npart of what medical training is it's a\nlesson in\nhumility so now what happens is when a\npatient comes in to say hey I think this\nis wrong with me I say okay cool thank\nyou for giving me the answer it's like\nholy [ __ ] this person is living this day\nin and day out and if they tell you that\nthis is wrong you should take it\nseriously so if you're someone who's\ngotten lots of FS you're not doomed to\nfailure you're not destined to\nnothingness there are a couple of things\nthat you need to understand the first\nthing life is not a\nrace and when I work with people who are\nbelow average IQ they tend to move\nslower but what ultimately determines\nwhere they end up is how long they move\nnot how fast they\nmove it took me 5 and a half years to\ngraduate from college it's taking and\nsome of the people that I work with six\nbut they do\ngraduate medical school is not about\ngetting straight A in your first year\nit's about having the core competencies\nof being a doctor when you graduate if\nit takes you six years to graduate from\ncollege instead of four or even three\nyou are still qualified to graduate you\nmeet that minimum threshold so this is\nthe first thing there's no harm in going\nslow there may be some harm but it's not\nthat's not there may be some harm but I\ndon't think that I think it's not nearly\nas important as reaching the Finish Line\nreaching the finish line is the most\nimportant thing so if you need to take\ntime you take time I'm a late bloomer I\nstarted med school at\n28 I finished residency at\n32 I had friends who finished residency\nat\n26 I had friends who were finishing\nresidency when I was still applying to\nmedical school and get getting rejected\nlife isn't a race you have to operate on\nyour own timeline if you try to operate\non someone else's timeline it's silly\njust think about it in any other\ndimension someone else's flight leaves\nat 5: in the morning oh my God I need to\nget there by 4: what time does your\nflight leave\nnoon silly don't play based on someone\nelse's\ntimeline ultimately your value in the\nworld is not how fast you did something\nbut how well you do something if it\ntakes you time it takes you time it took\nme\ntime second\nthing focus on the things that may not\nbe IQ related that absolutely matter\ndependency kindness reliability\naltruism human beings are Community\ncreatures the world\nneeds good generals and good\nsoldiers I personally do not think\nthere's any shame in in being a good\nsoldier I'd happy to be I've been a good\nsoldier in my life I'm happy to continue\nto be a good soldier and arguably I'm a\ngood soldier\ntoday I have a boss who's a CEO who\ntells me to do certain things and then I\ndo those\nthings I have some leadership in this\norganization but one of the most\nimportant things that we ever did for HG\nis me stepping down a\nCEO this is bigger than Dr k\nthere's no shame to me I don't feel\nashamed by having a boss I don't need to\nbe the\nleader and the cool thing is that your\nFS when you're growing up don't\ndetermine your success later this is the\nother really important thing that's\nimportant about\ndevelopment so if you get Fs in the\nthird\ngrade you may just be developing slower\nthis is why we have a diagnosis of\ndevelopmental delay it's not\ndevelopmental stunting\nit's delay so you will get there in the\nend and this is the real challenge of\nbeing someone who's below\naverage is that you don't realize that\nall of these things are not Destiny for\nyou they're not determinant of your\nfuture but the problem is then we start\nbelieving that if I get Fs in the third\ngrade I will get Fs for the rest of my\nlife if it takes me 5 years to graduate\nfrom high school instead of four it\nmeans I'm an idiot if it becomes\ndeterministic and then you start\nbelieving that and the real problem is\nonce you believe it then it becomes\nDestiny it isn't the fs that make it\nDestiny there's an intermediary step F\nleads to a lack of Hope lack of Hope\nleads to\nDestiny very important to\nunderstand how do I know this because\nI've worked with these people because\nthe data says\nso because the data shows that if you\nintervene\nin someone's life you can alter their\ntrajectory right I I recently saw a case\nreport of two people on the autism\nspectrum with very early intervention\nintervention at 20\nmonths and showed a remission of autism\nwhich I'm somewhat skeptical of but we\nabsolutely know that with autism\nspectrum we can alter the course of the\ndevelopment of autism through early\nintervention we have a lot of uh\nprograms in Psychiatry like early\nintervention\npsychosis where we know if someone is\npsychotic the earlier you intervene the\nbetter this person does you can alter\nthe trajectory of\nlife and what really seals the coffin\nfor these people is their belief that\nthe trajectory cannot be altered that\nonce you are in this Camp you will be in\nthis Camp forever not\ntrue so what would I recommend to this\nperson first of all take it\nslow you can get an F year one year 2\nyear three year four doesn't mean that\nyou'll get an F for the rest of your\nlife in my particular case it was I got\nFs in year one and year two I got C's\nB's in year three year four of\ncollege and I got B's and a is year five\nthen I went to med school went back to B\nfor year 1 and\ntwo B's or\nC's and then I got to years three and\nfour and I got a and then I went to\nresidency and I got\na so past performance is not a predictor\nof future return this is what people say\nabout the the stock market and the whole\npoint about being human is that we can\nalter the trajectory of Our\nLives the thing that fundamentally makes\nus human is that we don't have to listen\nto\nourselves I don't know that a tree can\never become a\ndancer I don't know that a lion can ever\nbecome vegan we can enforce veganism on\nthem but a human being who has a\ndigestive tract that is designed to eat\nmeat has teeth that are designed to eat\nmeat can stop eating\nmeat a human being that wants to hurt\nanother human being can restrain that\nhurt a human being what makes a human\nbeing is that we can fight against our\nnature that we are not actually\npredestined that's what makes us human\nwe can alter the course of our life so\nunderstand\nthis take it slow number one number two\nyour future is not determined number\nthree get help number four even if your\nIQ is not ideal work work on your EQ\nwork on being a good person work on\nbeing\nreliable it will let let you rise very\nvery\nhighly there may be some Partners out\nthere who are sapiosexuals and attracted\nto intelligence but most of the people\nthat I know will take reliability\ntrustworthiness and kindness over\nintelligence every day of the\nweek yeah it's like super cool to date\nsomeone who's a genius but half of them\nare arrogant pricks\ncan ask my\nwife so kindness compassion altruism\nreliability\nempathy these can help you succeed in\nyour relationship they can help you\nsucceed in your\ncareer so all is not\nlost we have time for one or two\nquestions before we wrap up for the day\num okay so what do I do if I don't have\nnatural empathy or Alexia the same thing\nthat anyone does if they don't have\nnatural anything else you practice\nit I didn't have natural empathy I was\nnaturally very\nalexithymic okay this is how I\nwas and then like I went through\ntraining and I became more\nempathic right some of us are not\nnaturally graceful I wasn't naturally a\nchef but I'm like decent at cooking now\nso this is the other cool thing about\nbeing\nhuman the stats at level one are not\ndeterministic for what we are at level\n20 the whole point of being human is we\nget to level\nup right I know it's like such a simple\nanswer we have tons of resources on\nAlexia and empathy and things like that\nso I'll refer you to\nthose like there's a lot of good stuff\non\nemotions we've done lectures on emotions\nwe have a couple of memberships lectures\non emotions we've got a trauma guide\nthat digs a lot into emotions so check\nthose resources out\num we may have resource packs\nspecifically on emotions I'm not\nsure um I'll look into diaspora Blues I\nlike that term I'm not too familiar with\nit\nbut okay this is a good question how do\nyou avoid trying too hard before it\nleads to burnout and not trying at\nall try to answer this one quickly but\nit's a long one see one of the biggest\nproblems that we run into is that we try\nhard we try extra hard and then we burn\nout because we're told oh my God you\nshould try harder you should work harder\nright by people like\nmyself so how do you avoid the cycle of\ntrying extra hard burning out recovering\ntrying extra\nhard so this happens because the trying\nhard overwhelms some of your internal\nsignals\nsee I'll give you all a great example or\nmaybe a terrible example I'll give you\nall an\nexample so there's this thing that I\ncall the gamer\ndiet and the gamer diet is when you're\nplaying games for like 10 hours a day 12\nhours a day and you suppress your\ninternal hunger signals when you\nsuppress your internal hunger signals\nand you finally take a break from gaming\nyou're\nfamished and then you order a gigantic\npizza and you consume a pizza and then\nyou go into a food coma and then you\nlike get out of it a couple hours later\nyou put on some anime you watch it for\nlike 3 hours and then when you've\nrecovered from your food coma it's back\nto the\ngame so if we look at what propagates\nunhealthy Cycles in our life it is\nnumbness to our internal\nsignals CU you say work really hard you\nyou say work extra hard what I'm saying\nis why is there a really or an extra in\nthere why can't it just be work hard\nwell because the reason you have to work\nreally hard is because your body is\ntelling you this is enough your body is\ntelling you it's time to stop your body\nis telling you we need rest and you\noverride those signals this is why you\nwork really\nhard because your body is telling you\nenough and then you ignore those signals\nand then you burn\nout so many years ago\nI climbed Mount kilamanjaro\nand mount kilamanjaro is pretty cool so\nwhat you do is you wake up at midnight\nand you start the last day hiking at\nmidnight why so that you can see Dawn\nfrom the top of the mountain at 6:\na.m. so I started hiking at\nmidnight got to the top around 7:30\nbecause I was having\ntrouble hung out there for 10 or 15\nminutes you can't really hang out at the\ntop of the mountain it's too cold and\nthen I started on my way\ndown and then I was so excited so\nthrilled and people told us yeah you\nhave to hike kind of like halfway down\nthe mountain and then you'll spend the\nday there you'll get back to the halfway\npoint at\nnoon you spend the day there and then\nyou hike back the rest of the way and\nI'm like how much hiking do we do the\nrest of the way they're like oh it's\nabout 6 hours 8 hours cuz going down is\nway easier I was like screw that let's\njust keep going like why stop it like I\ncan walk downhill for another 6 or8\nhours so stupid me started hiking at\nmidnight took a 2hour break at noon and\nstarted down the mountain at 2:00\np.m. after 8\nhours I was in I was a\nmess first thing that I did was pull a\nmuscle in my\nass then I was limping did I stop no\nnext thing that I did was pull a muscle\nin my Contra lateral knee actually\nprobably Tor a tendon which is still an\ninjury I have to this day did I stop\nthen no kept going next thing I is pull\na muscle in the other\nass hiked for what is\nthat 7 and 1/2 hours with another\nfour and then another eight or\nnine hiked like 20 hours in one day\n[ __ ] dumb\nand my body paid the price when you\nignore the signals that your body or\nyour brain or your mind said send you\nyou will burn out you will get\ninjured so how do we avoid the cycle of\nworking really hard and burning out we\npay\nattention to what our signals are\ntelling us about slowing down the second\nthing that's really important why don't\nwe pay attention to those signals\nbecause something else is driving\nus that's what we need to understand\nwhat is driving you to ignore the\nsignals so in the case of working really\nhard and burning out I'll give you all\none really good example right so I work\nwith people they're burnt out they're\nout of work for 3 months now they have\nto catch\nup now I'm behind it is the sense of\nbehind that causes me to work twice as\nhard ignore when I should slow\ndown see after you've been out of work\nfor a while you can't go back to 150%\nyou should start at 50% then 70% then\n90% work your way up go slower not\nfaster catching up involves going\nslower so back when I was at MGH I\nworked with patients from the concussion\nclinic so these are people who have\nconcussions they're already 6 months\nbehind people with a head injury and a\ncoma they missed a year of school when\nthey go back to school we don't tell\nthem hey buddy you missed a year of\nschool you need to take twice as many\nclasses it's the opposite you're going\nto take two classes class the first\nsemester instead of five if you do okay\nthere you're going to take three classes\nthe next semester if you're okay there\nyou can take two classes in the summer\ncatch up a little bit then you can take\na full course load the next year you'll\nstill be a little bit behind then you\ntake a full course load the semester\nafter that this is the way you catch up\nin life not by working\nharder not by making up for lost time I\ndon't know how to say this to y'all once\ntime is gone it's\ngone can't ever get it back don't try to\nmake it up done finished behind you your\nattempts to reclaim time from the past\nwill cause you to screw your present\nruin your\nfuture this is what happens when we burn\nout and we fall\nbehind take a lesson from evidence-based\nconcussion treatment go slow\nthe time's gone\nGG but what difference does it make it\ntook you 5 and a half years or six years\nto finish college instead of\nfour you're a little bit behind but then\nwhat you finish college you're going to\nwork for 40 years either way oh you're\ngoing to just work for\n38 you can make up for it later this is\nall an illusion of the Mind second\nreason that we work really hard because\nwe burn out not just catching up we want\nto impress people\nnow here's the problem with impressing\npeople if they are not impressed what do\nwe do we work even harder we are\nshooting for being impressed other\npeople being impressed with us now what\nwe're doing is letting our\nwell-being rely on the sensory\navailability of someone\nelse what if the reason they're not\nimpressed is because they're going\nthrough a divorce so they don't have the\nemotional bandwidth to say good job\nkid there are so many variables that\nresult in someone being impressed or not\nimpressed and we're relying on this\nwe're coveting this we're craving this\nwe're flagala ourselves in order to\naccomplish this thing to impress\nsomeone third reason we burn ourselves\nout and work really hard because we need\nto prove something to\nourselves I don't have faith in myself\nif I'm at the top of my class then I\nwill be good then I will be\ncontent we tie our own ego our own sense\nof well-being to some kind of external\nthing this is a match made in\nhell because on the one hand you can\nwork the hardest you can possibly work\nand still not end up at the top of your\nclass because maybe someone worked a\nlittle bit harder maybe someone cheated\na little bit more maybe someone is a\nlittle bit smarter than you\nmaybe someone has a background in the\nsubject maybe just because of random\nchance you spent out of a hundred things\nthat you were studying you focused on 90\nthey focused on a different 90 the 90\nthat they focused on showed up more on\nthe test\nGG now you're going to let your work\nethic your self-esteem be the result uh\nbe dependent on Randomness\nGG people will often times flag late\nthemselves work really hard I see this\nas in banking I see this in medicine\nit's adaptive it allows people to\nsucceed but it's\ntoxic we've talked about toxic fuel\nbefore so if you want to get out of the\ncycle of working really hard and then\nburning out what you need to pay\nattention to is first of\nall pay attention to the signals telling\nyou to slow down and even if you notice\nthe signals telling you to slow down and\nI would say 75% of the people that I've\nworked with notice the signals\nthey just don't care something else\nmatters to them more and as long as that\nthing matters to you more you are going\nto cannibalize\nyourself you have to change what matters\nto you and I've seen this as well with\nlike you know patients and banking who\nare in their 50s who do way too much\ncocaine they've been doing cocaine for\n30 years because they're in banking and\nthat's what people in banking do work\nhard play hard\nproblem is now you're in your\n50s your myocardial tissue cannot handle\nthe levels of cocaine that you used to\nuse 20 years ago so you have a heart\nattack and then you wind up in the\nhospital where a cardiologist is taking\ncare of\nyou and a cardiologist realizes oh [ __ ]\nthis person tested positive for cocaine\nlet's get Psychiatry involved\nand then they call my\nass and then you go and you work with\nthis\nperson and then what do you\nsee you see someone who ignores their\nsignals and then you ask them why and\nit's because they value something else\nand then I have to do the work of trying\nto get them to recalibrate their value\nsystem right it's fun work I love it and\nI can't do it for them they have to\nultimately\ndecide so burnout is most often driven\nby\nyou technically it's an intersection\nbetween you and the workplace that's\nwhat the research shows but you have a\ncomponent so that's the one that we're\ngoing to work on when I go and I work\nwith a company we address the company\nside\nstuff\nokay so the more you understand yourself\nthe more you recognize your signals and\nthe more you look at why you are\nignoring those signals this is when you\nwill truly be\nbetter all right\ny'all that's all the time we have for\ntoday I know we didn't cover quite as\nmany um huge thank you to our team for\nputting together the posts whether it\nwas Tech teller or MC or who who did it\nI'm not sure um I know we didn't get to\neverything but there's a lot of good\nstuff in here maybe we'll get to it next\ntime um thank you all very much for\ncoming today it's fun to be back from\nvacation uh we also really appreciate\nyou know we talked about the board stuff\nat the beginning I'm sure it'll come up\nagain um I just want to reiterate once\nagain that I think this is how things\nare supposed to happen right got\nreprimanded by the medical board that's\nthe job of the medical board they had an\ninvestigation we cooperated thankfully\ntheir reprimand does not come with a\nfine a probation no restrictions on my\nlicense more\nimportantly no restrictions or you know\nchanges to the content that we make or\nthe work that I do online so that's\ngreat so practically this doesn't change\nwhat I do day in and day out I don't\nthink yall will see many changes here\nbecause we don't need to change anything\nsay we needed to change\nanything um grateful to everyone who's\nprovided us with feedback grateful to\nour scientific Advisory Board um\ngrateful to all the people internally at\nHG who do develop our processes and\nprocedures of onboarding to make sure\nthat things are safe and boundar and\nwhatever and we will continue to improve\nbecause the work that we're doing here\nwe believe is important\nand thankfully you know we're allowed to\ncontinue to do this work in an\nunrestricted way so I think the board\nprocess was super fair I think that's\nwhy we have institutions like medical\nboards I think they're doing their job I\nthink we're going to do our job and we\nare going to do the best that we can to\ntry to tackle this Mental Health crisis\nin whatever small way we can do it and\nwe're going to do it for y'all because\ny'all are worth it and so thank you all\nvery much for your support over the last\nfour or five years crazy this has like\nbeen going on for 5 years now right\nwe'll be doing it for a couple more\nyears a minimum I hope but we never know\nwhat tomorrow\nbrings so thank you all very much it's\nan absolute privilege to be able to do\nthis work it's privilege to be able to\ncall this work you know it's not always\nfun but it is an absolute honor and I'm\ngrateful to y'all and we'll see y'all I\ndon't know when what's\nnext um when are we\nback okay so we have a members Q&A on\nMonday and then we have a deep dive into\nautism spectrum I believe scheduled for\nnext Friday so we're going to do a deep\ndive into\nautism um next week so we hope to see\nyall there thank you"
