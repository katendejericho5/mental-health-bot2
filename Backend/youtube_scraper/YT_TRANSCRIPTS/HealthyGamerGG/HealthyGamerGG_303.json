    "transcript": "acceptance is acknowledgement of the\npresent circumstances and then once you\nacknowledge what the present\ncircumstances are like in my case like I\nrealize like holy sh this girl is not\ngiving up on me she deserves better\nright and there's two things that can\nhappen when a dude has that thought\nnumber one is oh my God you're going to\nleave me right you're going to leave me\nand you're going to find someone better\nbecause you deserve better and you don't\ndeserve me the second is I'm going to\nbecome better I'm going to become what\nyou deserve and it's when people start\ndoing that when both parties do that in\nthe relationship I'm going to be what\nyou deserve I'm I'm going to grow for\nthe sake of this relationship I'm going\nto get better it's not if you can't\naccept me at my worst you don't deserve\nme at my best it's that I'm grateful\nthat you're accepting me at my worst and\nyou deserve nothing less than the best\n24/7 and that's what I'm moving towards\nbut you cannot do that unless you accept\nthat there's a part of you that's be\nhere and now"
