    "transcript": "so this is the other thing I've seen\nevery successful relationship or almost\nevery successful relationship I've seen\nis a psychiatrist and a lot of people\nmay think okay like if you're a\npsychiatrist don't you see bad relation\nno like most people actually have\nhealthy relationships not everyone comes\nfor coup's counseling every relationship\nI've seen that's successful has at least\none red flag and even that everyone's\nlike red flag Run for the hills don't\nrun for the hills because when you have\na red flag early in the relationship you\nlearn conflict resolution can you manage\nconflict with this person right so I had\nred flags early in my relationship my\nwife had red flags and we worked through\nthose and wow it turns out that if you\ncan resolve your red flags that's\nactually like a very good prognostic\nsign for future relationships but we run\naway from them"
