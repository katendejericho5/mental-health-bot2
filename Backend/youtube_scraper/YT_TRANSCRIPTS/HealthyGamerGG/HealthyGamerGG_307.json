righty chat welcome to another\nhealthy gamer GG stream my name is allo\nkenoa just a reminder that although I'm\na psychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice and everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if y'all have a concern or question\nplease go see a licensed\nprofessional okay so couple of quick\nannouncements and then we have a very\nexciting interview we're going to be\ntalking with Thor from Pirate software\num about gaming or mental health or\nwhatever and um just a quick heads up we\nare actually going to be I'm going to be\ndo working on a super secret project um\nnext week so we will not be streaming\nnext week uh we should continue to have\nuploads um to YouTube uh but we won't be\ndoing any live streaming next week and\nthen in two weeks we are going to be\nstreaming with Michaela thorderson who\nuh about women's mental health so I know\nthat like uh you know a lot of the\ncontent that we do is sort of from a\nmale perspective I'd say 50% of my\npatients have been women so we will\nsometimes you know it's not that we're\ncompletely ignorant of that but um\nwomen's mental health is not my\nspecialty by any means and I think it's\nimportant to get someone in here who can\nspeak specifically to that also Dr thers\nis super awesome so we will have her\ncoming in and um yeah if y'all have\nother mental health professionals whose\ncontent y'all like and you think would\nbe like really fun to talk to or we\ncould learn partic things about please\nlet us know so we're we're looking for\nkind of more mental health professionals\nwho specialize in different areas I know\na lot about a lot of stuff but I'm not\nan expert in anything by any means or\nnot everything maybe I'm an expert in\nsome things who knows being a noob um so\nwe're going to actually hop straight in\nwith Thor and let me see if I can find\nhim so let's go okay I'm\ncalling and then I'm going to do this\nhello can you count to 10 for me 1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8 9 10 awesome okay so I think I'm\ngoing to turn you down just Just A Pinch\nand I can't see your video uh turn on\ncamera there we go it's going to be\ngreen screen so you'll probably have to\ncancel that out that uh I don't know how\nto do that but that's okay I don't think\nI'll do it I'll handle it on then okay\nhold on Boop we're gonna do\nthis where are you Discord I can do what\nI can count no no no you're you're\nyou're good you're good I think I just\ngota I'm just reading\nchat wait where is the\nno the problem is I'm trying so hard to\ninstall Skyrim right now that I cannot\nfind where's the Discord I was talking\nabout Skyrim mods after you bringing it\nup and how Wild they are now yeah dude\nit's okay this is weird Okay let's\ntry hold on a second let me try this I'm\ngoing to try to change my overlay\nwe're going to hold\non okay let's try this so for some\nreason it's not detecting my pop out\nDiscord window as a potential\nSource F but we're going to try this one\nmore\ntime you don't see Discord where did\nunknown connection failure I wonder if\nthat's\nit oh here we go found you there you are\nwe we've suceeded I have succeeded tech\nsupport check I rolled my tech support\nand it worked you done it I haven't I\nhaven't leveled up much of it but I have\na racial\nbonus so that's what I'm that's what I'm\nreally relying on in terms of my oh yeah\nhow are you man I'm doing really good\nactually yeah just got off stream so all\nof the Goblins are here now yeah thank\nyou so much for uh sending raiding us\nbut you know you you don't have to do\nthat you can oh it's it's fun because\nthen the community can be engaged in it\nit's um yeah no absolutely I think it's\nreally fun that way yeah I think so too\nand so you are you go by Thor is that\nright yeah it's my middle name so I was\nborn in a thunderstorm and U I got the\nmiddle name of Thor and it's like why\nnot use it right wow that's cool yeah\nyou were born during a thunderstorm yeah\nyeah I was born this my my dad um made\nmy middle name Thor my brother got the\nmiddle name of Russell cuz he was born\nin uh in like uh fall so he got rustling\nleaves and I got I got Thor for mine so\nI feel like I got the good one yeah so\nRussell is an R SLE e or R Us SS l l eel\nyeah it's eel no Double L in there okay\nyeah interesting and anything in\nparticular that you want to talk about\ntoday Thor well I was actually\ninterested because you you wanted to\nreach out to talk about game Devon\nmental health and um I'm actually\ninterested in talking about that and\nseeing what your kind of take is and I\nwant to see what your lay of the land is\nspecifically for mental health for game\ndevelopers okay like because there's so\nmany people from the Next Generation\nthat are entering the game development\nspace now and it's mostly because the\ntools that we have today are so much\nmore accessible than they ever have been\nin history so because of that you can\nhave younger people making games you can\nhave older people making games you can\nhave so many different people making\ngames and how you feel about the way\nthat game developers are treated inside\nof the Space by players and the kind of\nlike mounting pressure for that kind of\nstuff and how how it feels because I've\ngot a lot of perspectives on that too\nbut I'm interested in how you feel yeah\nso we are i' I've worked with a ton of\ngame developers we work with a ton of\ngame developers there's a bazillion game\ndevelopers in our community um so it's\ninteresting because we have I have a\ncouple of different perspectives so one\nis we have a we have a data perspective\nso we have certain programs that game\ndevelopers will go through and so the\nneat thing is that compared to being\nlike just a clinician who works with a\npopulation we have a lot of internal\ndata like outcome measures so we measure\nthe outcomes of anything that we do\nbasically um and so we sort of have like\naggregate data about what works what\ndoesn't work but then there's also like\na clinical perspective of working\nindividually with people um who are in\ngame development and what that\nexperience has been like uh I'd love to\nhear kind of your experiences of working\nin the industry um if you have\nparticular questions I'm more than happy\nto answer them but I think oh sure I\nyeah go ahead oh\nsorry yeah so for me for for experiences\nin the industry so I've been in the\nindustry for about 20 years um I used to\nwork at blizzard entertainment so I\nstayed there for seven years um I\nstarted in game testing there and then I\nbecame a quality assurance member so\nlike you go from game tester to Quality\nAssurance that's like kind of the\nupgrade for that and then after that I\nbecame the lead of application security\nfor battl net which was all of the\nsecurity for Blizzard's websites\nglobally and then after that I became a\nsenior red team specialist which is\noffensive security I'm a hacker um I\nleft blizzard because I realized I was\ndeeply underpaid um absolutely it was I\nthink I was making 36% of Industry\nstandard for my position left because I\nI had been there my whole life went to\nAmazon game Studio which is right up the\nstreet got paid like a you know an\nactual wage and I was um a automation\nengineer working in Python uh working on\nThe LumberYard game engine then I quit\nthat because I got my third black badge\nfrom Defcon which is a hacking\nconvention in Vegas every year and when\nI got that the United States Department\nof energy reached out to me and said hey\ndo you want to come hack power plants\nfor the federal government I was like\nyeah that's freaking red so yeah 100% so\nI ended up going and doing that I stayed\nthere for a year and after working that\nfor a year of our team of seven people\nfour of them quit the same time to go\nmake their own security firm so they\ntook that and basically I was I was\ndoing 10 weeks a year flying around the\ncountry so like on call anytime had to\nfly out and they're like hey that's\ngoing to be 30 weeks a year now and I\nwas like no yeah I'm not doing that so I\nquit and I was I was thinking about like\nwhat am I going to do I have no idea\nwhat I'm going to do I'm going to wait\ntwo weeks kind of settle myself figure\nout what I'm going to go next in my\ncareer and two days into that Jack\nSeptic I played our game heartbound and\nit just exploded because he played it to\nlike two and a half million people and I\nhave never done anything else since I\njust make video games and I stream and\nI've been doing that for like six years\nfulltime now well seven now technically\nbecause it's 2024 now okay and most of\nwhat I do now is I help new people enter\nthe industry I teach them everything\nthat I learned from making video games\nthe whole time I show them everything I\npossibly can I run a Discord we've got\nlike 54,000 people in it to give them as\nmany resources as possible to give them\nyou know that kind of a choice and I\nfind more often than not people that are\nentering the industry now they want to\nquit their day job and just jump over to\nIndie Games and I I I try to encourage\nthem not to do that keep your day job\nuse that to pay your bills and do this\non the side to give yourself more\nmeaning in that Hobby and maybe work\ntowards doing it full-time one day you\nknow okay that's that's such\na that's a beautiful story man well\nthanks um I I really love the way that\nyou weave together kind of like notable\npoints along with kind of your internal\nexperience of it right so you you you\ndon't just say like oh I left the\ndepartment of energy you talk a little\nbit about what caused you to leave um\nwhat caused you to leave blizzard what\ncaused you to uh leave Amazon game\nstudios so it's it's it's a really\ninteresting narrative well thank you\nyeah I think that context when I'm\ntelling stories I I've learned how to do\nthat over streaming for so long is like\nyou have to give those kind of like\nlittle bits of context or people just\ndon't understand they're like why would\nyou leave such a high-paying job and\nit's like well there are reasons\nsometimes you know\nyeah um how do you I don't know if this\nis kind of too broad of a question but\nwhat is your like internal Compass like\nso it seems like you have a very clear\nsense of priorities\nand how you make decisions can you tell\nus a little bit about that I do a lot of\nstuff based on analytics for the\nbusiness so like if I'm doing business\nrelated activities it's not an emotional\nspace for me okay business related\nactivities are always going to be\nanalytic based so I may have a general\nfeeling of like this could be good\nbut let's look at the numbers and make\nsure that that feeling is correct before\nI do anything going forward for business\nrelated stuff for emotional basis stuff\nlike for my personal belief stuff for\ninstance I I run a feret rescue that's\nsomething I do on the side I don't do\nthat for money I do that for meaning\nright something that gives me an\nemotional boost for myself it's like I'm\ndoing something really good in the world\nyou know this is helpful for these\nanimals and I can see the effect of that\nthat's something that I do from like a\njust a purely emotional standpoint right\nand I still run the business side of\nthat from that analytics space is like\ndo we you know are we making enough\nmoney to run that rescue does it\nactually make sense to do this am I\ngoing too far am i expanding it too\nquickly that kind of a thing so that's\nkind of the the general compass that I\ndo is like I if I want to do something\nemotional I need to have the math to\nback that up if I don't have the math to\nback it up then it's too much of a risk\nand I need to make sure that I'm I'm\nbasically tempering that risk somehow\nthat it's not foolish and for the the\nrescue we actually put it up on Twitch\nso that end up making a ton of AD\nrevenue and running the whole thing\nmakes a ton of money doing yeah so so\nthat's interesting because you you say\nthat you run the the feret rescue for\nemotions but it's almost like there's an\nanalytical part of you that is saying\nokay so for this emotional unit in my\nbody and brain I need to do something so\nit almost seems like there's still\nanalysis at the top oh yeah yeah no 100%\nis that because like I I realize I want\nto do this this is an emotionally\nfulfilling thing for me but if I do it\nwrong I'll cause more damage than good\nand that's why there's the analytical\nside at the top of that because if if I\njust jump into it head like you know\nhead first I'm like we're just going to\ndo this and no like you can you can\ncause a lot of harm cuz now you have a\nlot of animals that are relying on you\nyou've got a lot of systems that can go\nwrong and it hurts much more outside of\nyourself you know and that's that's why\nthere's that analytical side at the top\nis I I can't do it any other way because\nif I did it would it'd be dangerous\nright too much risk it's bad for me bad\nfor them H interesting was there a have\nyou always been like this where there's\nanalytics at the top I think I think\nthat happened probably when I was about\nlike 20 somewhere in there I think I was\nhomeless for a year that's what caused\nthat I think I was very stupid before\nthat be for business stuff um I lived\nout of my car for a year in Colorado it\nwas not great and I realized right then\nI need to stop screwing up I had kind of\nlike one of those moments where you're\nlike I need to figure out I got to\nfigure out my [ __ ] right like I'm\nI'm not handling this correctly I put\nmyself in a bad position business-wise\nand now I need to make sure that doesn't\nhappen again and it doesn't happen to me\nand doesn't happen to the people around\nme that I care about so put analytics at\nthe top figure out something that works\nand I started going forward with that\nand it's been successful and it's it's\nworked actually and I feel emotionally\nfulfilled by doing the stuff that I do\nand I feel good because I know that I'm\ndoing it based on you know something\nthat that we can see is actually working\nrather than just feeling it actually\nworks you know like the math side of\nthat stuff are you comfortable talking\nabout the period of time when you were\nhomeless and what kind of led up to that\nsure yeah no I actually used to make\nthings in a game called Second Life ages\nand ages ago so that was my first\nfreelance kind of a thing I did that for\nabout 5 years and um I had a business\npartner and stuff screwed up basically I\num we had a 5050 deal we're like oh we\nhad a 50-50 cut and they wanted 80 they\nwanted 80% I did all the programming ran\nthe business they did the art and I\ndidn't I was too young didn't know what\nI was doing um they wanted to do that I\nsaid no and they took all of our work\nand they open sourced it at the time I\ndidn't manage my money very well at all\nso I couldn't pay rent the next month it\nwas that was it and it was like well now\nI don't have any money I have no cash\nflow and debts are mounting and\neverything's going on and I had to live\nout on of my car and it was it was a\nvery eye openening thing for me to\nrealize like hey you need to not only\nnumber one you need to make sure that\nthere's no way that someone can like\nscrew over your business on you know\nwithout you know there being some kind\nof contractual obligation in place some\nkind of legal ramification you need to\nprotect that in some way and then also I\nneed to manage my money better I need to\nmake sure this doesn't happen again it\nwas never one of those things where it's\nlike oh screw that person I'm just going\nto wallow in sadness it was like we need\nto solve this puzzle\nthis is a puzzle that needs to get\nsolved and it has to be solved by me\nchanging my behavior and that worked\nreally really\nwell do you have a sense of why you\ndidn't wallow in sadness I don't people\nwould I don't know for me I kind of\napproach a lot of stuff like Puzzles\nright frankly that's kind of how it's\nalways been since I was young is like\nthis is a puzzle to solve analyze the\nsituation um be sad the whole time like\nthere's nothing wrong with having the\nemotions about it right be upset be\nangry all that kind of stuff feel that\nbut at the end of the day the only way\nthat's going to you're going to get out\nof it isn't just by only feeling\nemotions it's by solving the puzzle and\ngetting yourself out of it is how I felt\nabout it and it it worked for me I don't\nknow if that works in every situation\nbut in the in the one that I had that\none worked very very well and it's\nworked for me since so are there\nsituations where you feel like solving\nthe puzzle hasn't\nworked I wouldn't say solving the puzzle\nhasn't worked it's just solving the\npuzzle led to to a a kind of a a\nsolution that I didn't want I so I was\nmarried for 10 years and I got divorced\nand the solve to that puzzle was that\nand it felt awful it was horrible it was\nsomething I had to go through but that\nis something that I think a lot of\npeople don't want that to ever happen\nbut sometimes that's the best for\neverybody involved you know and that's\nthat's an awful solution to that puzzle\nman but sometimes it's the right\nsolution you know so that I mean that\nsounds like a situation where puzzle\nsolving worked really well I mean even\nif it was painful yeah it works but it's\nnot the solution you want you know you\nwant to find another solution to that\ngenerally so I feel like it worked but\nit it's not the way you want it to work\neven if it is the best way absolutely um\nare you so Thor what what like I'm happy\nto talk about the industry in general\nbut I I think you're just a fascinating\ndude ask whatever you like open book man\num so if I ask something that feels out\nof bounds like just let me know okay can\nI trust you to do that yeah so I'm so\ncurious cuz you said that you were you\nhad been doing stuff for second life for\n5 years when you were 20 years old that\nmeans you started when you were 15 not\n20 I think it was I think it was\nactually around 23 when it when it all\nwent wrong I was in my early 20s so I\nstarted when I was 18 what was your\nupbringing like so my dad actually\nworked for blizzard for 23 years um he's\na cinematic director for Blizzard\nEntertainment if you know he who has no\nlife from South Park that's him that's\nnot like a a you know close to him\nthat's actually him that's yeah I've\nseen your short short on that that's\nbeautiful so growing up I actually went\nto Blizzard's offices all the time um so\nlike I grew up in Blizzard's office\ndoing my homework on the floor and stuff\nlike that and I had this kind of culture\nof game development around me the whole\ntime and I was like one day I'm going to\nmake a video game right before that I\nwanted to be an anthologist so I\nactually went to college to be an\nanthologist and I ended up dropping out\nbecause I realized that wasn't the\ndirection that I wanted to have in life\nI still have a very huge love of insects\nto this day I actually have Brazilian um\nMadagascar sorry Madagascar his and [ __ ]\ncockroaches over on the side over here\nand then I have um God I I used to have\na camp spenc fanus colony which is ants\nants and cockroaches right and I I keep\nisopods and all other kinds of stuff\nbecause I love that it's such a cool\nthing to me but I didn't want to do that\nfor work so I ended up dropping out of\nthat going and doing my other stuff\ndoing freelance work and then before all\nof that though it was it was mostly like\ngrowing up in Blizzard's offices and\nbeing like wow this is so cool to make\nvideo games maybe one day I'll be able\nto do that and I got so interested in\ntechnology and programming and trying\nthings and taking the remote apart\nalmost putting it back together kind of\nstuff you know that's that's what I was\nvery young like causing lots of problems\ntoo did you grow up playing video games\nI did oh yeah absolutely I I think when\nI was very very young my Dad tried to\nkeep me away from them because they were\nworking on stuff like Diablo at the time\nand they're like maybe that's not good\nfor a young kid to play you know just\nbunch of Satanism stuff in the video\ngame they tried to keep me away from it\nbut that didn't last long I think I was\nplaying that like I think it was like a\nyear after it came out I was playing Dia\none and how old were you I don't\nremember that was so long ago I'd have\nto go back and look I was born in ' 87\nlet me actually see when Diablo came\nout so uh I think 80 Diablo probably\ncame out mid 90s is my guess 96 yeah so\nI think I was let's see it's probably 9\n10 nine yeah nine 10 years old somewhere\nthere and Thor what was high school like\nfor you oh high school was weird so I\nwas a huge nerd in high school massive\nnerd and I had like very little social\nskills like I was really bad at it and I\nthink that was the time where I kind of\nlike SL ified humor as like a good\ndefense mechanism right because I wasn't\nvery good at at interacting with people\nI didn't pick up on social cues I wasn't\ngood at doing that kind of stuff so I I\nwas like well how do I fix this I'm\ngoing to do it with humor I'm GNA make\njokes because my dad's really sarcastic\nso I was like oh that could work right I\ncould use this as a mechanism to like\nmeet people and hang out with them and\nit worked great it was actually really\nuseful and um I still didn't pick up on\nsocial stuff until probably much later\nin life like really but all of that\nstarted there where I was like I'm a\nhuge nerd Outcast but they're like well\nhe's funny so he can come hang out with\nus so I was like cool I'm hanging out\nwith all these people and I don't know\nwhat that means yeah so so it sounds\nlike you figured out that humor was the\nthe way to solve that puzzle oh yeah\nokay and um what about your relationship\nor like the that your marriage are you\ncomfortable talking about that like like\nwhat that started like and what happened\nover the course of it sure we actually\nmet at work um when I was working at\nblizzard and we stayed together for a\nvery long period of time and um\neverything worked really really well um\neverything's going super well and then\nbasically we just kind of had a\ndifferent path in mind you know like you\nwe had this idea where you kind of have\nthe idea of like oh we're going to get\nmarried we're going to have a kid we're\ngoing to do all this kind of stuff and\nwe had a series of just terrible\nterrible things happen one after the\nother so her her father died of a heart\nattack M which was just devastating\nbecause it was like right after he\nretired just absolutely awful and then\nuh she got uh what is it called thyroid\ncancer oh my God so she had Hashim Modas\nand she ended up getting thyroid cancer\nand then after she got the thyroid out\nshe was like well I'm going to start the\nfamily now and I was like I don't you\nknow that's not that's not the time for\nthat right like I just can't do that yet\nand um it ended up being one of those\nsplitting path things where it's like\nyou can do this now but if you're not\nfully into it that's probably not the\nright choice you know if you're not\nfully into like ready to have a child\nand and do that kind of stuff it's just\nit's just not the right time right and\nend up being one of those things where\nit's like I'm want to do this now\nbecause all these devastating things\nhave happened and I was like well I'm\nnot ready for that so we split you know\nand that was the whole thing for that\nand it's it's awful it's terrible but I\nthink it was the right choice and she's\ngone off she's remarried and\neverything's great there and she's got a\nkid now and I've I've gone off and I've\ndone all the things I wanted to do and\neverything's great you know I think I\nthink everybody's happier as a result of\nthat but it was awful to go through and\nI think that it's that's always a really\ntough thing is figuring out what you\nwant to do in a moment like that of like\nwhat are the what are the things that\nare going to go wrong how is this going\nto turn out in the end like there's so\nmany choices there's so many paths there\nthere's so many ways to feel about stuff\nand I think I think we chose the right\none if that makes sense how do you go\nabout navigating it when there are so\nmany\nvariables uh I sit down and I just think\nabout it I I think a lot of the times\npeople will try to distract themselves\nfrom a large issue like that they'll try\nto watch TV or they'll try to screw\naround on the Internet or play video\ngames dude I I sat in bed and I was like\nI'm going to sit down and think about\nthis I'm going to introspect I'm going\nto feel emotions about this I'm going to\nthink about you know just kind of\nimagine what it would be like if I went\ndown that route the things that could go\nwrong the things that could go right\nhow do I see myself down this path in 5\nyears how do I see myself down that path\nin 5 years and it took months to figure\nit out of like what's going on there and\nit ended up being in that sort of\nDirection it was like okay out of\neverything that it could be this one\nmakes the most sense and then we talked\nabout it and we did that and we moved\nforward and there was no there's no like\nnegativity there or anything like that\num I actually still talk to her mom she\nstill sends me Christmas presents and\nstuff like super super friendly awesome\npeople and like that's it you know and\nand I think that's probably the most\nrespectful outcome and the most like\npositive emotional outcome it could have\nbeen because that can end so badly yeah\nit can end with like a person you care\nabout more than anyone else in the world\nit can end in a way that you never talk\nto them again and that's a huge shame\nyou know it's not necessary\nso so Thor um over the months that\nyou're sitting in bed thinking about it\nhow do you know whether your thoughts\nare circular or you're making\nprogress you don't a lot of the times\nsometimes it just feels like you're\nspinning your wheels on stuff um at\nleast I felt that way sometimes it was\nlike I've already thought through this\nI'm overthinking this part but it's one\nof those things where it's like it's\nsuch a large decision in your life you\nknow such a big one that that felt okay\nat the time I didn't go into that path\nwhere it was like I'm thinking about the\nonly thing over and over and over again\nand I'm not producing value in any way\nI'm not moving forward with more of a\nsolution to this it was more like okay\nI've thought about that one before put\nthat one back to the side there's like\nan emotional reason to think about that\none again the worst wor possible\nscenario the best possible scenario we\nknow that those are there we need to\nfind out what's going to happen in the\nmiddle because that's more likely worst\npossible scenario is less likely the\nbest possible scenario is less likely\nit's always usually it's going to be\nsomething in the center for that so that\nwas kind of how I paired that back was\nto be like okay that's just the Deep\nfear talking that's just the absolute\nhope talking what happens in the center\nand kind of move forward with that and\nthought about those things to try and\ntry and figure it out you have a very\ninteresting relationship with your\nemotions that's probably\ntrue can you tell us a little bit about\nyour relationship with your\nemotions um I guess I don't know I I\nthink the thing is is it's it's one of\nthose things I try to keep them in check\nmore than anything else it's very easy\nto go kind of off the rails and feel\nemotions very deeply that are not\nproductive it's easy to get incredibly\nangry incredibly upset incredibly\nwhatever and lash out at people but it's\nalso really easy to be like okay hold up\nI know this is happening right right now\nit is not productive to for me to yell\nat you just because I'm angry there may\nbe a situation where yelling makes sense\nto relieve that stress for me but doing\nthat to another person is just going to\nmake them have the same problem right\nit's like when you're upset at a like a\ncustomer support person there's no\nreason to be upset at the customer\nsupport person they usually can't solve\nthe problem that you have there's\nnothing that they can do they're not\nempowered to fix the issue yelling at\nthem gets your stress out but raises\ntheirs and they get to go home and have\na shitty day as a result there's no\nreason for it so in situations like that\nI'm like okay I'm just going to stop for\na minute I'm going to figure that out\nlater I'm going to be frustrated about\nit but I'm not going to be frustrated at\nthis person and I'm not going to be\nfrustrated in this moment because that's\njust going to lead to more problems that\nthen we'll have to go and solve there's\nno point for that so Thor this is\nprobably a hard question for you to\nanswer but do you have a sense any idea\nof why you were like this and many\npeople are not cuz you say I have no\nidea hold up right and then then I don't\nknow if this kind of makes sense to you\nbut there's a different part of your\nbeing that kind of takes over so when\nemotions can sometimes take\nover and you're able to put the breakes\non that and then some do you sort of\nunderstand what I'm talking about\nbecause you I think you kind of use this\nphrase hold up and I think that's the\nhard part I think the thing for me is\nI've seen what happens when other people\nget very mad I've seen what happens when\nother people just let the emotion guide\nthem and they live in that moment and\nthe outcomes are random they don't think\nit through they don't think about what\nthe other person could be feeling they\ndon't try to stop and say how does that\nperson feel what would their perspective\nbe based on their current understanding\nthe situation they don't think about\nthat and when they don't do that it ends\nup being a situation that completely\nchaotic you don't know the outcome you\ndon't know what could happen and as a\nresult people can get hurt people can be\nupset when when did you discover that\nthat oh I don't know I don't know if\nthat was like a thing that I discovered\nso much it's hard for me to know that\nhonestly I've been that like that very\nlong time when you were a kid probably\nit's probably some kind of carryover\nfrom when I was young yeah I wouldn't be\nsurprised and when you say that people\nget angry and you don't and and the\nresult is chaos do any particular\nstories come to\nmind I'm trying to think it's it's\nprobably related to my mom my mom kind\nof sucks frankly um very emotionally\ndriven human being so likely that it it\nstems from that which makes the most\nsense to me um I did I did have kind of\nlike a rough upbringing with her and I\nended up moving my dad we had a we had a\nmoment my dad and my mom split up when I\nwas very young right and when they were\nwhen they split up we actually got the\nchance to like which house do you want\nto live with from like the court and I I\nwas like chose my dad because my mom was\nvery emotionally driven and it just kind\nof freaked me out and when I was young I\nwas like like super super analytical\nrobot mode right like I I couldn't\nhandle any of that kind of stuff very at\nall and and that's probably why I didn't\nhave any like ability to interact with\nother people or kind of like understand\nlike social interactions and stuff stuff\nlike that would be the most make the\nmost sense to me and the adapt the\nadaptation there was to be like okay I\ndon't want to be like that I'm going to\ndo this a different way right and and\ntry it a different way so I think that's\nprobably the most likely result from\nthat so when you say your mom was very\nemotionally driven what does that\nmean um somebody that doesn't really\ncare about the logic of a situation\nsomebody who doesn't care about like hey\nyou know you're mad mad about this thing\nbut here's a piece of evidence that\nshows that that's not real mhm and it's\nlike no well I'm mad because I'm mad now\nit's like okay that's not that's not\neffective and I I found that to be I\nguess early me it was like this doesn't\nmake sense I would rather run through\nlife based on evidence information it's\nit's one of the things that I talk to my\ncommunity about a lot is like trust but\nverify is trust to the other person's\ntelling you the truth but then verify\ntheir claim and if you can't don't\nspread that information because if you\nspread that information you're likely\nspreading something that can't be\nverified it's likely fake right and\npeople bring me like wow did did you see\nthe news for this and I was like no I\nhaven't seen the news for that let take\na look at it and there's nothing to back\nit up right now so let's wait you know\nlet's wait and deal with that later when\nwe actually have more information to\nmake a valid you know sort of assumption\nabout it and I think I learned all of\nthat when I was much younger yeah and\nit's funny people in chat are talking\nabout uh the tower which is a a chapter\nin our game heartbound and uh yeah\nthat's that's completely what that's\nabout it's all about you know my\nrelationship with my mom growing up and\neverything like that's why I made that\nsection of the game it was kind of a\ncathartic thing for me to build that\nportion of the video game about that c\ncan you talk to a little I'm I'm\nunfamiliar with that what how sure so in\nthe game there is a character um little\nbit of\nspoilers there's a game that's a\ncharacter that is the boss of the tower\nwhich is like a a working environment\nkind of AAA you know I tried to take all\nmy stuff that I learned from like triaa\nand like put it into the video game make\nit something that people could identify\nwith and everything like that and the\ncharacter of that is is based around\nmanipulation and gaslighting it's about\nyou know praying on the emotions of\nanother person it's about using that as\na weapon right and I wanted to kind of\ntake the things that I had grown up with\nthe things that bothered me and turn\nthat into a narrative that was a little\nbit larger than life right but kind of\nhit at the core of the way that it feels\nwhen you're young when a parental figure\ndoes that because if you are using any\ntype of emotion or anything like that as\na weapon to a child it's it's much more\nextreme and that will carry with them\nfor the rest of their life and then when\nthey become adults they have to now\nabsolve that problem they have to figure\nout how to solve it now right and it it\ncan be a very monstrous thing so that's\nmade a monster out of it right and when\nyou say is is much more extreme with a\nchild what does that mean I think for me\nwhen I was young it was I\nguess it felt like the norm like all\npeople are going to be like this so\nthat's because you have very little\nperspective mean um lying to you about\nthings gaslighting saying things that\nhappened that didn't happen all kinds of\nstuff right and it's it's a rough it's a\nreally bad feeling right so when you're\nyoung and that's your only perspective\nit's very hard to see outside of that to\nsee that other people aren't this way it\nis very hard to see like well this\nperson does this so maybe all people are\nlike this and that's kind of how I grew\nup I was like oh maybe all people are\nthis way and I learned very quickly over\ntime it's like no no not everybody's\nlike that as your perspective starts to\ngrow and expands you're like wait a\nminute now I can pick up identify so\nsomebody is lying to me I can pick up on\nyou know maybe this person is not\ntelling the truth in this situation\nmaybe this person is just being overly\nemotional right now you start to learn\nthe social cues for different types of\nthings it's not the same for everybody\nbut there there are pieces you can pick\nup that can carry over to other\ninteractions you know okay that makes a\nlot of sense yeah um any questions for\nme so far no this is great I think this\nis fun actually I think Chad is getting\na lot out of it they're all reacting to\nit so uh yeah so so and we were and I'm\nI'm a little bit curious so Thor you\nseem quite content yeah oh yeah can you\ntalk a little bit about that sure yeah\nno um up until this year I'd been\nstreaming on Twitch for about six years\nand if you remember when the twitch\nleaks happened when they leaked all the\nthe information like uh financial\ninformation that we had on here um\npeople thought at the time because I was\na partner I'd been a partner for a\ncouple of years they thought I was like\nRich right and they're like oh man this\nguy's Rich he's he's a partner and all\nthis stuff I was making less than\nfederal minimum wage doing streaming and\nmost of my money came from people buying\nthe copy of heartbound and um and like\nbuying the merchandise and stuff like\nthat that was like where it was I live\non about ,500 to $22,000 a month that is\na not a huge amount of money and uh\nthat's including the mortgage everything\nelse food all of it and I it's because I\nlive very frugally I like to live\nfrugally it's something that I I find a\nlot of joy in because I'm like how more\nefficient can I get this it's always\nlike a can I can I do this in a way that\nsaves more money it's it's a fun game\nfor me basically is what that is and I\nenjoy doing that so like once I got that\nkind of in and then the stream took off\nin the last couple of months we went\nfrom 450 average viewers which was\nalready the most i' had ever had in my\nlife we went from like 100 average\nviewers at the beginning of the year to\n450 and then YouTube found me and my\nstream now has 11 12,000 people on\nTwitch side another 2,000 on YouTube\nit's wild it's completely wild and\nbecause we had spent all this time in\nthe last six years setting up the\nDiscord making sure that there's stuff\nlike like the website develop. games\nwhich is the website that I put together\nto teach people about making games like\nall of these little buckets and things\nthere was something for people to stay\nbecause many times when you have that\nlightning at a bottle moment you're not\nready for it because it's like wow all\nof this interest and there's nowhere to\ngo and it disappears and that happened\nthe first time when Jack Seth the guy\nplayed our game ton of people came in\nton of people left immediately because\nthere was nowhere for them to go and I\nwas like if this ever happens again\nwe'll be ready and that's exactly what\nit is so I feel very content now because\nas you can see everyone in the community\nis here and to be real with you as a\ncontent creator your community carries\nyou hands down that's not it doesn't\nfeel like my accomplishment even though\nI planned for it even though it's it\nhappens because of the things that I do\nit exists because of them hands down\nevery single time and that feels really\nnice nice to me and all the nice\nmessages that I get from people saying\nlike hey you changed my life I'm making\nvideo games now I'm doing stuff on the\nside I'm doing side projects now I never\nthought I'd learn programming or any of\nthis kind of stuff or all the people\nthat reach out to me about the ferrets\nthey're like hey you know people that\nsurrender their ferrets to us all the\ntime because they're in really bad\nmedical conditions I got two new ones in\ntoday actually so we've got 21 now in\nthe rescue and they're they're ones that\nare up for youth in Asia ones that are\nnot going to survive and we save their\nlives and we we rebuild them you know\nand that's that's something that's just\nincredibly emotionally positive for me\nlike all of that is so it's very\nfulfilling incredibly fulfilling and on\ntop of it with the massive increase in\ncommunity it's I already had all of my\nfinances in order so it's just done like\nall of my needs are met beyond all of my\nneeds are met frankly so now what I'm\ntrying to do with that is do things like\nRun the game jams to give that back to\npeople give as much information out make\nsure there's no ads on it or any AD any\nkind of blockades no no kind of walls or\nbarriers for that to teach people more\nstuff because I came from the hacking\nCommunity right so I'm offensive\nsecurity guy most of our community is\nabout teaching you as much as possible\nis to give you information even if you\nknow no matter what give you as much\ninformation make that free and I've\ncarried that over for everything that\nI'm doing and it just feels good all of\nit feels good yeah that's fascinating\nman so I'm curious what what do you\nthink about like do you have any sort of\nreligious or spiritual\nBend no no not at all actually um I I\nreally like religion oh wait sorry\nyou're going to say something go for it\nyeah I I actually really like religion a\nlot um I find that sometimes people can\ntwist religion into a weapon which I\ndon't really enjoy I think that\nsometimes religion can be used to really\nbenefit people um to teach them like hey\ndon't be a dick right don't be a dick to\npeople and that's that's a very kind of\ninteresting thing that it kind of takes\na large bath and people have different\nfeelings about it but I've seen religion\ndo a lot of good for people and I've\nseen religion do a lot of bad for people\nI'm not personally religious um I don't\nknow where we go when we die right and\nthat's not that scary for me because the\nway that I generally feel about it is\nthe reason that accomplishments that we\nhave in life are accomplishments is\nbecause we have a limited amount of time\non Earth and we don't know how much that\ntime is it could be any amount of time\nit could be 10 minutes from now right\nbut the things that I've done I feel\ngood about it and I feel like I've\naccomplished things because I had a\nlimited amount of time to do it and I\nfeel like things like I don't know\nimmortality would be more of a curse\nfrankly because you're like well okay if\nI unlimited time then what's the point\nwhy do anything today just do it\ntomorrow right so like with that that's\nkind of my Outlook in terms of like\nreligious Outlook is like I'm just going\nto do things and other people can have\nfeelings about stuff and I support that\nand I think that's cool as long as\nyou're not ruining somebody else's game\nright that's really all that is don't be\na jerk to other people um on the behalf\nof something that you think is a greater\ngood because it's not it's not a greater\ngood ever if you're you know hurting\nsomebody else there's no point to that\nso H how do you I'm kind of curious\nabout what what kind of motivates\nyou um\nH I don't know no there's no like single\npoint factor for\nthat I like solving puzzles that's one\nfor sure I love to fix problems I love\nto find problems and fix those it's a\nbig part of why I got into Security in\nthe first place I'm always like I'm\noffensive side so I'm I'm the guy that\nbreaks in I'm the dude that finds a way\ninto the office I'm the guy that you\nknow finds a way past security I'm the\none who finds a way into the network\nthat's what we do we solve problems it's\nfun it's it's a puzzle to solve every\ntime and I I like that a lot and I think\nthe biggest thing for me is if I can\nalign my emotional feeling with that\nanalytic side I can do things like the\nferret rescue right that's something\nthat's like I really want to save\nferrets I think that they're an animal\nthat is not generally looked on very\nwell by people I think that a lot of\npeople don't take care of them very well\nI think that they're overlooked a lot\nbecause they're exotic so exotic animals\ngenerally cost a lot more so people get\nthem thinking like oh I'll just put them\nin a cage it's like a rat and then they\nfind out no this is a very high needs\nanimal it's a lifestyle animal\nand um they don't take care of them it\nmakes me really sad to see that like\nfrom the emotional side it's like this\nis awful and there's not a lot of groups\nthat actually take care of them and then\nit's the analytics side pops in and goes\nhey how do we solve this because there's\nan emotional need there so how do we\nsolve this to make sure that emotional\nneed is met and we get to do something\ncool at the same time so both sides of\nit could appease Thor do you have a\nsense of purpose\ninternally sense of purpose in what way\nlike do you have a sense like so I I'm\nI'm with you that in the implementation\nsure we got to check the emotions we got\nto check the the problem solving but\nwhat I'm kind of really curious about is\nlike what's the driving force is it cuz\nyou know o Over The Meta of your life\nwhat is the problem you're trying to\nsolve like do you have a sense of that\nor is it kind of really day by day I\ndon't think there's a sense of that I\nthink I solved that for myself a long\ntime ago I don't really have like a a\ndriving thing that I need anymore I\ndon't think I have a need for that it's\nmostly just like a I enjoy doing this if\nthat makes you solve it do you have a\nsense of\nthat I think after I picked myself up\nafter being homeless I think it's what I\nsolve that that kind of internal driving\nforce is like I can I solve this\nanything that comes after this as long\nas I fit in that minimum guidelines of\nlike these are the needs that I have the\nminimum needs because I've already seen\nhow bad it is if you go below that and I\ndon't want to ever go back there again\nas long as they don't go back there\nagain we're good you know and I I find I\nguess it gave me perspective on that cuz\nmany people would be like oh my day is\nso awful someone said something bad on\nTwitter you know like I just don't that\ndoesn't that doesn't bother me at all\nlike it could be so much worse than that\nit could be way way worse than that and\nI don't think there's anything that\nhurts me in that way anymore I think it\nkind of got rid of that frankly you're\ntotally fine so I I get that so that's\nwhat I'm kind of curious about is if we\nsay like okay so you figured out what\nyour minimum requirements are right to\nrun the software of Life yeah so these\nare your minimum requirements but then\nonce those are\nsatisfied what is it that cuz you could\nif you could just be satisfied right and\nyou could just sit there but you don't\njust sit there okay so is it is it\nboring is it boredom I don't even know\nif it's boring it's just that like think\nof it this way if you're sitting there\nin a car with a full tank of gas and you\ngot an open road in front of you are you\ngoing to sit there with a full tank of\ngas some people would there's no reason\nto drive especially if you don't have\nanywhere to go right I could drive on\nthe road I could not drive on the road I\nchoose to drive on the road that's\nreally what it is is not because I have\nto but because what if there's something\nover there that I haven't seen yet I get\nto experience something new maybe\nthere's something over the hill right I\nget try something and then there's new\nthings to solve and that's that's\nfulfilling to me right there's new\nexperiences to have new stuff do\nnegative experiences qualify as new\nthings to experience they do they're not\nthe best thing to experience I think\nthey they're teaching moments a lot of\nthe time you know they'll teach you\nabout something you don't like something\nabout yourself something about the way\nthat you work something about other\npeople or a particular person um not\nsomething I want to experience but it is\nsomething right everything in your life\nis something that is an experience you\ncan have you can store that away and be\nlike okay I understand this now this\nthis person is like this this group of\npeople is like whatever it's going to be\nright have you ever tried like spiritual\npractice no no I haven't actually any\nparticular reason no um just something\nthat's ever really interested me um the\nidea of if you're talking about like\nlike ritual inside of practice so you're\ndoing like the same activity sort of\nthing or\nmeditation taii meditation taii yoga any\nof that stuff no no I've never actually\ndone any of those I I think I don't\nthink I have anything against it I've\njust never experienced it never tried it\nif that makes\nsense yeah makes a lot of\nsense\num\nh\ncan I think for a second sure yeah go\nfor\nit what do you want to talk about today\nThor I don't\nknow I think this is actually a really\ncool conversation to be honest with you\nI think so far it's actually been really\nneat because I've talked about things\nduring this that I haven't talked about\nin probably a very long time to be\nhonest with you I usually touch on some\nof these subjects on my streams but not\nin this depth I\nthink what uh what's cool about the\nconversation I think it's probably just\nsomething like that like I I haven't\ntalked about this stuff publicly really\nand that's something new right doesn't\nneed to be new but it's actually kind of\nnice to talk about these things because\nI think most of the time when I'm on\nstream you know and I'm I'm talking to\nthe rest of the community it's it's very\nkind of held back in certain areas for\nthat kind of stuff because it it ends up\nbeing being a thing that is kind of\nnegative emotionally for some people\nthey don't want to hear the negative\nside of stuff they don't want to hear\nthe bad things that you've been through\nand I think in a setting like this it's\nmuch more appropriate if that makes\nsense yeah so is it the novelty that\nmakes it\ninteresting no I don't think it's a\nnovelty I think it's I think it's a\npositive thing because I think a lot of\npeople have kind of a weird idealist\nsort of representation of streamers and\nif I talk about these types of things it\nmay help some people understand that\nit's it's not like that everyone is a\nhuman being even the people that you\nlook up to and I think that is\nbeneficial in a lot of ways the\nidealism yeah well dropping the idealism\nand seeing that like even the people you\nlook up to the most they've had bad\nthings in their life yeah they've had\nsituations where they failed they've had\nsituations they succeeded I think that\nis deeply important especially in a time\nwhere so many people can look up to a\nCreator and be like I want to be that\nguy and because I'm not that guy I feel\nbad about myself and I don't ever want\nthat to be the case yeah so I I'm kind\nof at a fork in the road of this\nconversation and I think I'm going to\nneed some help if you can help me out so\nI I find your personal story to be\nabsolutely fascinating okay um I think\nyou have so I I've and I'm I'm I don't\nknow how familiar you are with my\nbackground I'm happy to share more\ndetail about kind of where I'm coming\nfrom but one of the things that I've\nbeen doing for many years about 20 years\nnow is teaching\nmeditation Co and there are certain\ntemperaments or even some karmic it's\nreally more karmic although I recognize\nthat that is a\nvery charged word you have a lot of the\nso you're familiar with RPGs I'm\nassuming yeah D and D are you are you\ntalking about like Karma and Dharma yes\nokay so so like play D and D yes okay\nwould you like to see I have a box of d\nandd right underneath me actually so so\nI don't know how how what's the earliest\nedition of D and D you played do you\nremember first edition first edition old\nschool play everything from that to\nfifth let let's go back to 2E which is\nthe greatest of all editions okay yeah\ngood good you know how like when you\nroll your 3d6 six times and you get that\n17 on Charisma and you get your that\nwhatever 11 on wisdom and 13 on strength\nor whatever you need to be a paladin you\ngot certain builds right but unlike\nthese noobs who play fifth edition where\nit's like oh you get to pick whatever\nstats you want to no your stats get\nrolled and then you get to you have to\npick an appropriate class no are we okay\nuh so one thing is is that in that way I\nsometimes meet people who I think have\nthe\nstats for what I would call\nspiritual multiclassing or presti\nclassing is probably the best way to put\nit so I think really like being a monk\nor or spiritual growth like so you can\nhave it as your main class but it's\nreally a Prestige class for at least in\nin the in the way that I do it it's kind\nof like a Prestige class on top of a\nnormal thing so I work with a lot of\npeople in finance programmers things\nlike that content creators um and and so\nit's just interesting to me anytime I\nmeet someone like you because a lot of\nwhat what your experience of life is\neven your capacity for hold up which on\nthe one hand signifies that your frontal\nloes are quite robust and have strong\ninhibitory connections to your lyic\nsystem and your amydala strong brain but\nbut that it's yeah so there's a there's\na\nneuroscience uh component to it but in\nthis other tradition it's not just\nNeuroscience there's a whole spiritual\naspect to that um the thing though is\nthat that's kind of what interests me\nbut it's like I certainly don't want to\nbe pushy about my spiritual or religious\nbeliefs no that's fine yeah I'm\ninterested in learning about it to be\nhonest with you and the the the\ninteresting thing is I'm not quite sure\nwhere to go with that so so that that's\nwhy I'm kind of giving you two options\none is that I just notice this tendency\nin some people and I think you've got\nthe stats like you qualify for the\nprestige class if you want to start\nleveling it up um and we could have a\nconversation about that because it\ndoesn't seem to me so many times when I\ntalk to people they'll you know ask for\nguidance or information on a particular\nDimension but I'm not seeing that you\nneed that in any way shape or form so\nthen the thing is that we had a we had a\npresumptive topic which is like mental\nhealth for game developers which we\nhaven't really touched on which we could\nabsolutely spend time on um but I I kind\nof leave it to\nyou I'd kind of like to do the mental\nhealth for game developers and if we\nhave time I'd like to do the other one\nas well and if you want to talk about it\noffline too I'm also okay with that\nbecause I'm actually really interested\nin learning about that from you um\nthat's not something that I really talk\nto a lot of people about or have a lot\nof information on so that's actually\nkind of cool I dig that yeah so what's\nthe reason to talk about mental health\nfor game developers for me it's it's\nbecause there's a lot of people in my\ncommunity that are game developers\nthere's a lot of people that are out\nthere and I think it'd be really\nbeneficial for them to hear that like a\nlot of a lot of that is really that's\nimportant to me that they're getting as\nmuch out of that as possible if that\nmakes\nsense because I know like my needs in\nthis case like I'm interested in that\ntopic but I feel like a lot of people\nwould be interested in the other topic\nbecause I'm specifically a game\ndeveloper which is well known on Twitch\nwhich is not a common thing today we\nhave the software and game development\ncategory and there's not a lot of people\nthat have kind of like broken out into\nthe general internet for that yeah can I\njust think for a second oh sure yeah\nyeah thank\nyou what kind of things would you want\nto talk about for mental health and game\ndevelopment mostly demoralization for\nstarting out developers I think it's\nsomething that I talk to my community a\nlot about but I'm be interested in your\ntake because this is your realm of\nexpertise and I'm doing it mostly from\npersonal experience which you may have a\nwider range of understanding for this\nand it's I see a lot of the times people\nwho are starting out that are doing this\nkind of stuff they become very\ndemoralized if their game doesn't take\noff if there's not a lot of information\nthat's coming in like people aren't\nplaying their game or anything that\nstuff and they feel like they're a bad\ndeveloper and they never want to do\nsomething again and the advice that I\nalways give them is is the same which is\nmake a bunch of bad games it is okay to\ntry and fail and try and fail and fail\nfast and we've seen that many many times\nfrom other developers inside of the\nindustry and not to tie your personal\nvalue to the legs that your first\nCreations have tie your personal value\nto what kind of a developer was I three\nmonths ago what kind of developer was I\nsix months ago because many people have\nthat kind of like extra voice that's\nsaying like you suck you're bad like all\nthis kind of stuff they point out all\nthe flaws to themselves everything like\nthat but that's not a fair fight because\nthat's your internal monologue you know\nyour own weak points you know where\nyou're the most efficient and nobody\nelse knows that that's that's you\npunching in places you can't block right\nso I tell them like hey if you want to\nmake video games you should make a bunch\nof really bad stuff you should focus on\nyour own self-improvement see where\nyou're going in that direction and then\nwhen as you put it out into the world\nyou should start taking feedback from\nothers and then in you know bring that\nin and start becoming better and better\nof a developer but I find a lot of the\ntimes people will start this process and\nthey just they fall flat they're like I\nneed to make the best game ever possible\nas my first game and they just\ncompletely fail out because they either\ncan't finish it it gets really\ndemoralizing because they never see the\nimpact of their work that's another big\none is they don't show it off to anyone\nbecause like no one can see it until\nit's out they get halfway through a\nthreee long project as their first game\nand they just stop working on it because\nthey're terrified of showing it to\nanybody I I my general stance is always\nlike make something in 30 days put it\nout on the internet see what people say\nand then go from there so I was\nwondering like what your take is on that\nfor not just game developers but Min\ncreators is is the idea of I have to do\nit perfect I have to do it immediately\nyou know and like I need to do the best\npossible thing I got to buy all the kit\nand show all the stuff and no one's\ngoing to care about anything that I\nmake yeah can I think for a second\nsure so you give this advice right so\njust just make something in 30 days and\nput it out there yeah and how does that\nwork how does that work for people they\nlove it a lot of people are super into\nit and it's it's mostly people are like\nI was trapped in AAA and I wanted to\nmake stuff and I didn't want to do it I\nI didn't have an opportunity to this\nkind of stuff and it works for them and\nit ends up working for them really well\nbut I'm wondering if there's anything\nkind of larger from that that I'm not\nseeing because I have such a narrow\nViewpoint from specifically game\ndevelopment specifically streaming yeah\nso I I mean I I think yeah there's\nthere's more to it I I don't know that\nit's actually so here's my my kind of\ntake on this so we deal with a lot of\ndemoralization as well and I I I think\nwe're going to end up talking about the\nformer um but like is in topic number\none so let's just understand a couple of\nthings okay the first is uh so when you\nsay make a bunch of bad things and put\nit out there that's coming from your\ntemperment so I think that that advice\nso like here we are talking about this\nthing because you want to help your\ncommunity right and then I ask you when\nyou give this advice how does it work\nand you're like it's great and then I'm\nsort of thinking like Okay cool so then\nlike why do we need to talk about it\nbecause you've already figured something\nout that's very effective based on your\npersonal experience resonates with\npeople I'm an expert but I mean dude if\nwhat you're doing is working and it's\nhelping a ton of people that and you\nthat's what you're advocating for you\nknow why so so then the the flip side of\nis okay what about the people that it\ndoesn't work for that's the thing is\nit's it's really hard to see that yeah\nyeah what do you see that it's it's hard\nto see the people that it doesn't work\nfor because either they won't say\nanything or they just disappear ABS or\nthey don't exist yeah I just don't know\nright so so so now what we're doing is\nwe're like trying to solve a problem for\na group of people that we're not even\nsure is out there what how big they are\nwhat the nature of their\nresistance to adopting your thing is and\nlike sure we can do that I'm enough of\nan expert to walk you through what their\npsychology and all that good stuff is is\nbut I think it's kind of like what we're\ndoing is is because you you want to do\nsomething for the benefit of others\ninstead of the benefit of yourself we're\nmoving further and further away from the\ndata set that we have in getting into\nhypothetical Realms to like help these\npeople that and I I think that like it's\nin a sense we can help them but it's not\ngoing to work because they their\npersonal value is so baked into what\nthey do they have difficulty separating\ntheir ego from their performance that\nthat's the first thing that needs to\nchange yeah you can't just tell people\nto stop caring about the way that you\nlook when you go to the gym it just\ndoesn't work now there's a a process of\nthat we can talk about that but I I\ndon't think that's the conversation to\nhave with\nyou because that's the conversation to\nhave with the person who's in that\nsituation hey Thor tells me that I\nshould stop caring about the the product\nof my work but you all can take a look\nat any and I'm not trying to be racist\nhere but there's a cultural element to\nthis anytime we interview Koreans\nespecially like Korean streamers every\nsingle Korean or almost every single\nKorean Korean I've interviewed on stream\nhas this very very as you said this\nextra voice this self-critical voice\nthat\njust destroys them yeah culturally\nthat's a very that's more common in some\ncultures than others so I can understand\nthat entirely um and it it the different\na different flavor in Indian culture but\nyou know for whatever reason just the\nKoreans they kind of come to the top of\nmind for me and not to say that that\nthat's present in every ethnicity so you\ncan always grow up in a household where\npeople can be critical of you you\ninternalize that voice and stuff like\nthat but this is kind of like where\nwe're solving someone else's\nhypothetical problem right we're not we\ndon't have good data I don't I don't I\nmean I can give you a lecture on it no I\nmean that makes total sense you know it\ncomes to the point where it was like\nmostly I just wanted a sanity check on\nthat I guess like the general sense of\nlike does this make sense even thinking\nabout this and you're right yeah you're\ncompletely right about that is it's it\nis solving a problem that isn't\ntechnically a problem it's mostly kind\nof like I I don't know what the term\nwould be for it cuz it's not like\nsomething that I spend a huge amount of\ntime on but it is one of those things\nit's like I wonder if this is working to\nthe effect that I think it is you know\nsure and I get the sense that you feel\nobligated to try to help your community\nbecause that's one of your central\ncompasses right so you're like okay like\nhow can I help other people because like\nI don't necessarily need help and I\nthink this is what's the cool thing\nabout things like this is that I think\nparadoxically the best way to help them\nis to have conversation number one\nyeah it makes sense and I I know I can't\nsolve everyone's problems though I can't\nfix all of that for everybody so it does\nmake sense and yeah you're right you're\n100% right okay so you said you're kind\nof Interest so let's talk about\nmeditation spirituality whatever the\n[ __ ] yeah sure no absolutely so you said\nyou're interested in it what are you\ninterested in I'm interested to know\nbecause it for many people that kind of\nspiritual spirituality is very unique\nfor each person some people handle it in\ndifferent ways they go by different\nteachings there's so many different ways\nof handling and doing that kind of thing\nand I'm interested in what your take is\non that because it's for me a lot of\nthat is going to be unique for you and\nlike the way that you handle that the\nway that especially approaching it from\nfrom your you know kind of education on\nthis the way that you you do it is\nlikely going to be very interesting if\nthat makes\nsense interesting in what way\ninteresting because it'll be unique you\nyou can see a lot of things like if you\ngo on like YouTube and stuff a lot of\nthe times you'll see kind of like a lot\nof people saying similar things the very\nsame things but when you're approaching\nit from kind of like your your\neducational standpoint and your\ninteraction with other people especially\nwith people that are like you know\ncontent creators it's going to be very\ndifferent we have a whole bunch of\ndifferent types of problems you met so\nmany different people with so many\ndifferent kinds of problems that you've\nhelped them walk through you probably\nhave a very unique perspective very\ndifferent perspective if that makes\nsense yes and I find that to be more\nvaluable I guess that makes sense but is\nthere a particular part of my\nperspective that you're interested\nin\n[Music]\num that's a hard one I actually don't\nknow I don't know if there is I I mostly\njust want to hear your take on it see\nyou walk you through it you so\num so Thor what what are\nyou what like what are you I am a bone\nMech piloting you know being piloted by\nabout two pounds of meat in my brain\nright it's like fat and a bone Mech with\nmeat armor that's you know okay well\nsaid I'm a I'm a single point in the\nuniverse for the time period that I'm\nhere and I'm going to do the things that\nI want to do in that time and hopefully\npeople will like those things\nkind what is the eye yeah you said I'm\nGNA do those things that I want to do\nwhat is the eye the eye is is the thing\nthat exists within that that time period\nright the this maybe maybe we exist\nafter it I don't know but for now we\nhave a physical form and if that\nphysical form breaks down then we got\nwho knows that's kind of you have a\nphysical form what else constitutes\nyou\num if you made an exact clone of a\nperson this is always the question right\nif you made an exact clone of the person\ntheir mentality would be very different\nyou know we've seen that with twins they\nobviously don't have the exact same\nmentality so I think you're a collection\nof those experiences and how you handle\nthose experiences too but if you gave\nthe same people the same experiences\nwhat happens don't know I I always\nlikeed that in Star Trek actually is the\nidea in Star Trek is that when you\nteleport it actually constructs the old\nbody constructs a new body and then\nimplants the same memories into it and I\nwas thought that was a very interesting\nthing CU it it brought up a lot of sort\nof ideas in Star Trek of like are you\ndead when this happens well it's still\nyou but is it you you know like is there\na Consciousness component to that that\ndisappears during that transaction or\nare you actually just a collection of\nmemories and we can rebuild you don't\nknow so this is what I would great this\nis this is going to be good so my my\nfirst response is there's actually way\nto answer that question oh right so so\nwe're approaching that question\nphilosophically which is what Star Trek\nis really great at but I love start Tre\nthe reason I love spirituality is that\nthere's there's a there's an\nexperiential answer to that question\nthat can okay you can know it's not\nphilosophy and actually the process of\nthat knowing is is literally what what\nin my opinion or the version of\nspirituality that I I walk in and I'm\nsharing with you and what I think you\nwould be what you have the stats for\nlet's say so let's go and and we're\ngoing to help all the people who get\ndemoralized by the way so don't worry\nabout that and it's beautiful how these\nthings work out so you said that you\nhave a physical form yeah is that as far\nas we know anyway yeah yeah is is that\nall that you\nare I don't believe so no what\nelse um the way that you manage that\nform there is a Consciousness within\nthat whether that is derived from\nsomething or not is unknown like a lot\nof people talk about it at least unknown\nto me right and I think that's the\nbiggest thing with that is yeah the way\nthat you pilot that Mech is kind of the\nwhole point right so just having the\nphysical form is irrelevant having the\nability to Pilot in a certain way is the\nimportant part okay and what are the\ncomponents of piloting this is great uh\nfiguring out how to you know your how\nyou want to interact with other people\nif you can do things that does the\nfiguring\nout that Consciousness whatever that is\nto spark you know so so let's understand\nthis is consciousness what what are the\ncomponents of Consciousness so let's\nlike take a programming example like\nwhat is like you know there's like\nintegers and whatever the other\nvariables are in programming like\nthere's like like float things or I mean\nI'm Rusty on this so what is what is\nlike the you know what is the variable\nclass of\nConsciousness m so defining that\nspecifically yeah I would say because\nwe've said there's a physical form which\nhas the physical the class of matter\nright yeah so what is like the stuff\nthat is not that is you that is not\nphysical the stuff that is you that is\nnot physical honestly that's I think\nit's kind of interesting because many\npeople kind of look down on animals and\nsay like animals don't have a\nConsciousness they don't matter anything\nlike that but I find that the more that\nyou look closely at pretty much any\nliving thing you'll see that each one of\nthose individuals most most usually will\nact differently than their counterparts\nwithin the side of that right I think\nthose differences is what that is most\ngenerally to me so like if you look at a\ndog one dog is gonna be oh sure hold on\nyeah so so so so is it okay I interrupt\nyou yeah sure sure go for it so so I\nfine so there's personality so we can\nexplain to you what personality is we\nwe're going to so we're going to do some\nstuff at the end for all the people who\nget demoralized we're going to do like a\n15 to 20 minute 30 minute rundown of who\nyou are what your different components\nare what your personality is what your\nidentity is those things by the way are\ncompletely opposite they're not the same\nthing at all which a lot of people don't\nunderstand and then we will will end up\nwith helping people who get demoralized\nby their failures to understand why they\nget demoralized and where that\ndemoralization comes from and why\nsomeone like you does not get\ndemoralized because the whole issue is\nthat when you have a failure at this\npoint it does not affect your being no\ndoesn't right and and other people it\naffects their being so what is the\nmechanism of action what is different\nbecause the stimulus is the same but the\nresponse is very\ndifferent and something about the way\nthat these two things are connected\nbecause the stimulus happens is like a\ndrop of water in a pool and depending on\nthe substrate of the pool what we create\nwill be different even with the same\nstimulus okay so we'll we'll get to that\nbut I'm I'm going back to this which is\nlike sure you said that okay dogs\nrespond differently by the way do you\nthink that plants have\nConsciousness not in the same way that a\nlot of people think I know they\ncommunicate um I'm actually really into\nmicology which is like fungus right I\nactually have a um mushroom farm and one\nof the things that we have is many\nplants will actually communicate to each\nother through myum which is like a\npretty interesting thing through trade\nand information like that so if you if\nyou damage a nearby plant many of the\nother nearby plants will actually stop\ngrowing in some cases for certain types\nof plants and that's communication and\nthat's response to simula even though\nit's not a response to its own situation\nit's a response to a nearby situation in\nthat way I feel like that's that ends up\nbeing effectively Consciousness right\nyou you being yeah I would say yes\nthat's why I wanted to kind of phrase\nthat around it so I would say yeah\nabsolutely absolutely okay\ngood yeah you're you're definitely\nqualify for the Pres\nclass um so so okay so let's go back to\nthe substrate though right so you said\nthat dogs respond differently sure\nanimals have Consciousness as an aside I\nthink the biggest difference between\nanimals and humans is our ability to run\nagainst our\nbiology so to my understanding there is\nnever an animal that has chosen to be\ncelibate and if you give dogs that are\nraised vegan the opportunity to eat eat\nmeat they will eat meat yeah yeah and\nand so I if we there's a whole lot of\nstuff down that route the the the core\nthe biggest area of difference is that I\nthink human beings fundamentally have a\ngreater capacity unclear whether it's\nbinary or not to run against our\nnature makes sense um but let's go back\nto this so like what is the substance of\nthe you that is not\nphysical so you call it Consciousness\nwhat is that collection of experiences\nat that point okay so let's how you\nmanage them what's let's understand okay\nso you said experiences and management\nwhat how do we experience things so we\nexperience things through emotional\nstimuli like when we're interacting with\nanother person how we feel about that\nbased on the other experiences we had in\nthe past there may be you know chemical\nchange that makes you angry or makes you\nupset or whatever it is that's going on\nuh a lot of the time someone will have\nan emotional reaction they don't realize\nwhy they need to sit down and stop for a\nmoment like why am I having this\nemotional reaction right\num there's that and then there's\nmemories of the things in the past\nwhether they are perfectly memorized or\nnot whe they are kind of just an\nidealized version of that memory or not\nis kind of up in the air but like those\nare down to how you form those memories\nand how you act on those in new\nsituations is sort of how that is and\nthat's unique for each person and that\ndoes form a personality but I think the\nConsciousness part is you stopping and\ngoing okay I have these memories is this\ncorrect you know does that does that\nmake oh sorry I'm I'm going I'm going to\nchange gears on you for a second so I'm\ngoing to start taking notes on what\nyou're saying cuz I'm doing that anyway\nbut I think this is going to be this is\ngoing to be great okay so I got to just\nso I'm going to just change my overlay\nand I'm going to screen share with you\nto make sure that you can see so we're\ngoing to do this and then I'm going to\ndo this and I'm going to\ndo this\ngo live oh God why is this so\nlaggy hold\non we're gonna see if I\ncan pop back C can you see it I can see\nit yeah okay\nso all right so let's understand what\nthe nature of a human being is okay so\nyou said that there's\nyou yeah and and so how is it that you\nexperience things you say that we have\nexperiences you have experiences through\nthat physical form it's always going to\nbe through the filter of that physical\nform right okay like if you have bad\neyesight you're going to see things\ndifferently you see things in the corner\nof your vision who whoa whoa whoa yeah\nyour this is great hold on so so\neyesight good yeah and then you also\ntalked about so when you have an\nexperience you also mentioned memory you\nmentioned emotion yep right okay so\nlet's understand this so how how what is\nthe how does an experience happen\nso new experience happens because one of\nthose physical Sensations or visual\nSensations something that you are taking\nin as information but it's through the\nfilter hold on let's sorry I'm gon to\nkeep interrupting you because this is\ngreat totally fine okay so you said take\nin right yeah so the first thing that\nwe're going to do is we're going to\nunderstand that there's something called\nan indria an indria is a sensory\norgan and as you\nmention this is so an experience starts\nwith an\ninput right I can agree with that all\nright then what happens so you take that\nand it is filtered by kind of the\nquality of that input like maybe you\ndon't have very good eyesight maybe you\ndon't have the ability to touch and feel\nas good as another person would be that\nis always going to be changed by your\nphysical body whatever it's going to be\nokay so there's there's a physical\ncapacity for the inas 2020 Vision okay\nfair enough yeah but I wouldn't say that\nthat okay okay fine so you mentioned the\nfilter so what we're talking about is a\nlimitation of the indria when you use\nthe word filter yes okay that is exactly\nit okay fair enough let me just erase\nthat because I wouldn't call that a\nfilter I'd call it a quality of the\ninput quality of the input makes sense\nyeah the signal okay then what happens\nso after that it's going to be you you\nyou may have a reaction to it\nimmediately there might be an automatic\nemotional reaction that happens before\nthe kind of analytical reaction and then\nthe analytical re action for me kicks\nright in and goes wait a minute don't\nhave the emotional reaction that's\nalways the first the emotion reaction is\nalways the first it is the automatic\nresponse the I should jump away I'm\nafraid I should punch you know I'm in\nyou fight or flight sort of a situation\nand that that can happen in many\ndifferent ways of I need to hide I need\nto fight back I need to run anything\nlike that and then after that is the\nanalytical and then we store in memory\nis how I kind of feel about that and the\nmemory storage may be different based on\nit is colored by the way that the\nsituation was handled from your\nperspective which may not be the full\ntruth okay so this is cool okay so let\nme ask you this when you say that\nthere's an emotional\nreaction\nyeah how would you describe do you like\npeanut butter Thor I do which part of\nyou likes peanut butter\nH\nH okay I see where you're going with\nthat there are certain parts of me that\ncan kind of have the sensation of peanut\nbutter right like my I can taste it I\ncan feel the texture on my tongue it may\nbe good to eat it right may give me like\noh I'm not hungry anymore sort of thing\nand it reminds me of times when I've had\npeanut butter and jelly sandwiches\nthere's a lot of different pieces that\ncan kind of have that experience yeah\nyeah okay so let let me let me put this\nback right so there's there's a taste\nwe've already counted for that that's\nthe indria there's a memory of past\npeanut butters fair enough y there is\nthe analytical portion which can say\npeanut butter is healthy or unhealthy we\nshould eat more of it or less of it\nright who's that yeah what about the\npart that likes so even the first time\nyou try peanut butter there's this taste\nand The Taste the let's assume for a\nmoment that the taste of peanut butter\nis like conserved between human beings\nright there's this philosophical\nquestion of is red red the same to\neverybody whatever but we all kind of\nagree that peanut butter tastes like\npeanut butter and orange juice tastes\nlike orange juice yeah so the part there\nis a part of you that is not analytical\nis not memory and is not taste so\nthere's the the physical quality of\ntaste but then there is your the part of\nyou that likes or\ndislikes yeah where would you put the\npart of you that likes or dislikes on\nthis map what do you think it is the\nclosest to I would say it's closer to\nemotion and the reason why is I can like\nor dislike something that is bad for me\nand the emotion side goes do it and the\nanalytical size goes do it in moderation\ncongratulation congratulations you have\njust discovered the second Sanskrit word\nManus so Manus is our reactive mind okay\nso Manus is the part of our mind that\nfirst of all acts first this is where\nour emotions come from and this is where\nwe also have likes and\ndislikes do you like olives do you\ndislike olives do you like peanut butter\ndo you dislike peanut butter something\nabout us likes and dislikes and the\nspeed of liking and disliking is the\nsame as the speed of\nemotion if you tunnel down into this you\nwill discover this but it happens first\nthat makes sense emotion is is can is\ndifferent but it so now we've discovered\noption number two okay so now we're\ngoing to kind of move this over here\nwe're going to take the reaction and\nthere is a reaction in the\nmonus and then you mentioned a couple of\nother things like me so then you\nmentioned analytical mind and the\nanalytical mind is fundamentally\ndifferent from the Manus right yes so\nthe analytical mind is what we call\nbudhi so you've discover the third\nSanskrit word so buddh is also has a\ncouple of other features it is\nanalytical it is also responsible for\ndiscrimination so by discrimination I\nmean literally to be able to divide\nthings so pattern recognition and\ndiscrimination uh P oh hold on a second\nokay pattern recognition we'll get to in\na second sort\nof because for a pattern to\nexist we have to have a\nmemory makes sense right so yeah this is\nour analytical capability so we can\nanalyze\npatterns we can analyze our\nmemories pattern recognition is kind of\na storehouse of knowledge it is not this\nsame as an analytical capability does\nthat make sense that does make sense yes\nokay so now the question is how does a\nmemory\nform okay would you like me to answer\nthat yeah how I feel okay so I I think\nlike in this case you have indria so\nthat's that's the incoming information\nthat goes into what is the second is\nmonus yes monus so that goes into we\nhave a reaction immediate responsive\nreaction do I like it do I dislike it is\nthis something positive something\nnegative do I have to have an immediate\nresponse does it need to happen before\nwe analyze the situation fully like you\nknow is is it a fist coming in our face\nsort of a thing and then after that if\nit can make it past that point then we\nhave the analytical side that then goes\nokay we have all the information now\nlet's stop for a moment let's think\nabout this and it gets stored away\nsometimes I find that memories stop at\nthe reactive mind and immediately become\nan immediate memory in that case because\nthe emotion of the situation is much\nmore powerful than the analysis of the\nsituation and that memory may come from\nthere sometimes we remember wait a\nminute I felt this way but it actually\nmeant this which means the memory is now\nChanged by the analytical side of it if\nthat makes\nsense let's say there's a memory so we\ncan modulate memory with wood the yes\nright and we can change its temperament\nlet's say okay fair enough yeah so you\nthe way that we we recall it basically\ncan change from that okay so so buy has\nthe ability to modulate Memories but how\ndo memories get formed I would say from\nthat immediate like the reactive mind I\nwould say usually it's from that yeah\nspot on almost always okay so so we're\nwe're we're doing spirituality at this\npoint by the way really yes I find that\nto be really interesting actually yes I\nknow you do that's why we're doing it\nthis way so I love that so so we're\ngonna let's let's understand a couple of\nother things so now let's talk a little\nbit about science okay so we know about\nthe formation of memories is that there\nare a couple of things that are\nimportant with memory one is deeny you\nmore likely to remember that which\nhappened a little while ago than that\nwhich happened some time ago the second\nthing that happens is that memory is\ntied to what we call\nsalience and salience often times has to\ndo with emotion so if you look at our\nbrain we have this part of our brain\ncalled\nthe let me just show okay I'm looking at\ndark versus clam we can watch dark\nversus\ncler um wait can you not see this oh no\nmy hair was just in my face I get it out\nof it but is can you see the screen\nshare I can yes I can says salience into\nemotion okay so we're going to okay GG\nnever mind something break nope I was\ngonna I was going to show you something\nbut it's it's fine so let's look at\nneuro Anatomy okay so here's your brain\nokay so we have this part called the\nlyic system which is kind of over here\nwhich is our emotional circuitry and\nright inside it or next to it we also\nhave our hippocampus which is our memory\npart of the brain these two things are\nvery close together so what's going to\nhappen is our memories are largely\nformed by our emotions makes sense and\nfurthermore not only so you talked about\nthis indria thing and this is where I\nI'm going to say use the word filter but\nwhat I'm going to say is that our\nmemories actually act right\nhere okay so you get an indria and then\nyour memory\nrecalls your memory attaches relevant\ninformation which will create a\nparticular reaction I can agree with\nthat that makes sense okay so let's just\nrun through a simple example let's say I\nhave a phobia of dogs if I have a phobia\nof dogs and I\nyeah Jesus okay if chat wants to see\nThor's camera I'm gonna need a\nminute okay hold on yeah\nwe they want to see his hair I but\ndiscord's not showing it to me cuz I'm\nscreen\nsharing I don't think I that's so funny\nno okay I I I I can I can do it I can do\nit I can do it hold\non I'm still screen sharing with you\nright I talked about fixing my hair and\nthey're losing their minds now okay okay\nso I'm you can see my screen sharing\nyeah I can see everything okay oh my God\nhe can see everything we're gonna okay\nhold on I'm going to I'm going to have\nto create the I'm going to have to do\nthis okay Source no we're gonna oh God\ndid I screw something up\nno hold on dude do do you realize what\ny'all are asking Bros okay hold on ADD\nuh not new folder the technology the\ntechnology [ __ ] Thor we're just gonna\ncall it this now Thor is going to have a\nsource inside it which is going to be a\nscreen capture which we are going to\ndo let's see if this\nworks\nnope and\nthis oh God hold on chat okay if you\nguys want this I can do it but then\ny'all have to stay with me for a second\nokay [ __ ] throwing me off my\ngame we're going to try one last time\nwe're going to do a window capture add\nsource\nDiscord\nvideo and then we're going to make\nthis over here and now we're going to\nclick one button and if this did it\nwork stream is evolving it's happen okay\nI've done it I've done it okay so but\nchat you guys can now see his face and\nmy face and the thing right there you go\nokay did did it work though I can't I\nliterally can't see it because if I see\nit then it will go away because it has\nto have you I have to have you on on my\nscreen it is working okay it is working\nlet's continue then and you can still\nsee the iPad yeah I can okay great man\nthat was a dc20 that was a a dc20 tech\ncheck okay and if it's not aligned y'all\ncan go [ __ ] yourselves we're not dealing\nwith that right now okay all right so\nlet's go back to memory so now remember\nthat\nmemory can\nfilter our sensory experience yes okay\nso I that be interesting because that's\nkind of where that happens for kind of\nlike a preconceived notion for something\nlike this is going to go bad before I\neven have information to say that it's\ngoing bad yes don't worry we're going to\nhelp the demoralize people okay so now\nlet's give you an example let's say\nthere's person number one and this\nperson is Thor and there's person number\ntwo which is person in your community\nwho does not get helped by your advice\nadvice doesn't work so when person when\nThor looks onto the internet and sees a\nfailure this enters your\nindras mhm right\nyeah but then what happens is you have\nsomething over\nhere that shapes your reaction to the\nfailure which results in a change over\nhere and this change is going to be okay\nlet's learn the budhi takes over 100%\nokay\nit the other person has a failure out\nthere their\nindas see this failure but they don't\nsay what can I learn there's some kind\nof reaction over here that makes it [ __ ]\nI'm a\nloser that that does make sense there a\nhigh amount of negative emotion and\nthere is a high amount of other quality\nthat we have yet to\ndiscover so this is the problem over\nhere because what what what do you\nactually add you add okay so let's think\nabout your memories right\nfailures make me stronger yep I can\nsurvive\nfailure I have survived failure yep and\nthat's why yeah sure so I have making me\n[ __ ] erase\nthis okay so so since your mind\nleverages these things which are based\non your memories and we'll talk about\nthat in a second this is why you have a\ndifferential response to the same\nstimulus now what tends to happen is you\ngive people this advice and let's\nunderstand for the person in your\ncommunity not this person but the person\nfor whom it\nworks this is what happens so they're\nover here they want to do a\ntask but their\nemotions are like like nah braah that's\ngoing to hurt and then then what happens\nis they have another indre input and\nAlong Comes\nThor and Thor says do it and then they\nhave an emotional reaction to what you\nsay because if they just have a logical\nreaction they're like I don't know what\nwhat the [ __ ] but then what happens is\nThor inspires\nthem then what happens is the nabra and\nthe inspir\nthey\nfight and if the inspiration wins they\ndecide to try\nit and if they try it one of two things\nhappens we'll get to this in a second\nbecause we haven't quite figured out how\nmemories form this becomes really\nimportant because if they try it either\nthey develop confidence and what does\nthat confidence mean this confidence\nmeans they literally get to\nplagiarize your thought which I want\nthem to absolutely right yes so I\nsurvived or but that doesn't happen to\neverybody what happens to some other\npeople when they try\nit if they fail and then it reinforces\nthat notion before of I am a failure\nokay right so now there there there's\nright so there's\nreinforces I am a failure\nyep okay and that's why when I'm\nexplaining things to people especially\nlike with a one-on-one kind of a\nsituation I try to talk to the person\nfor a minute get information about them\nand then try to pose that in the way\nthat is best suited for their kind of\ncommunication style if that makes sense\nyeah makes a lot of sense yeah I think\nthat's it sometimes people need a little\nbit of extra care I don't have all the\ntime in the world but for the ones that\nI do have time for I can yeah so now\nthere's a differential reaction now this\nbecomes everything do you see this\nbecause if we can figure out how to go\ndown this route then your advice will\nwork for every human being on the planet\nI don't think that's realistic of course\nit is is it yes why not show me what the\nlogic where the logical errors is in the\nsystem if it could be possible silver\nbullets I find to be very rare A A\nsystem that always works 100% of the\ntime I find to be very rare I always\nfeel like that's I would I I would\ndisagree categorically with that I would\nactually say the opposite that most\nsystems work 100% of the time that the\nnature of the universe is that gravity\nisn't fluctuating it's\ngravity\nsense yeah I would agree when does that\nsystem disappear when do we stop having\nthat system so I think when that system\ndisappears is when I don't have enough\ninformation to\npose that sort of stance to that person\nin the way that they need to hear it\nhold on that's why that system breaks\ndown yeah but that's not it's not a\nproblem with the system it's a problem\nof your lack of understanding of the\nsystem sure if we understand the science\nof mind and we've done a pretty good job\nalready if we can understand how to push\npeople from this reaction to this\nreaction they'll turn time we can win\nevery time then we can win every time\nright but the amount of information\nrequired for that is enormous and it's\nUnique for each person it is it not no\nit's not right so hold on hold on a\nsecond hold on a second let's just\nunderstand this is the C this is is\ncrazy\ntalk okay you have a brain right yes I\nwould hope so how similar is your brain\nto my brain is your hippocampus in the\nsame place as my\nhippocampus likely likely frontal loes\nare the same yep lyic system is the same\nwe all do any of us experience emotional\nreactions before sensory inputs I see\nexactly where you're going with this it\ndoes make sense right so this is this is\njust the reason it feels like it's\nimpossible is because we're not\ncompetent enough I mean if you ask me Dr\nK how do I make a video game I'd say\nit's [ __ ] impossible because I don't\nunderstand what variables are I don't\nunderstand what integers are I don't\nknow python I don't know this I don't\nknow this I don't know this and so\nsomething seems impossible simply\nbecause I don't understand it Bingo\ncompetency that makes complete sense\ncompetency okay so I think the thing is\nfor me is the reason why I don't call it\na silver bullet is because I realize\nthat I do have a limit right and because\nI have a limit that may be a limit on\ntime I may not be able to reach that\nperson in the amount of time that they\nrequire right that may be an issue of\nCompetency maybe I don't understand\ntheir situation as well as I could maybe\nI don't know how to communicate with\nthem in in the way that they need sure\nso so there there's a practical limit\nlike the Silver Bullet is a silver\nbullet but if you don't have a gun it\nyou know fair enough but let's not\nforget that like if we can figure out\nhow to consistently do this then the the\nwhole game changes yes okay agree so now\nlet's understand what forms a memory\nright so like we talked about salience\nwe talked about recency now here's kind\nof the other thing I'll I'll kind of\nhelp you out a little bit but so so what\nwe sort of discover or actually hold on\ndo I want to help you out\nI don't do um let's let's let's just\nstumble for a little bit and see because\nyou're doing great so far you've already\ndiscovered like 80% of it 60% of it so\nlet's see how far you can go without any\nhelp okay all right so so then let's\nunderstand the quality of a memory so\nhow does a\nmemory how does a memory affect this\nsystem a memory may change your way of\nhaving that pre-reaction to the\nemotional part it may change your kind\nof perceptions of the situation before\nit even reaches the emotional state and\nthat may temper your emotional state it\nmay change the possibilities for that so\nour memory can also affect our indas\nwhich is absolutely true yep so just to\ngive\nyou um an example of\nthis hold on a second let's just take a\nquick look at a scientific study about\nthis sure oh my\nGod I think it's the same thing like the\nthe sort of the same thing with that is\nanytime you meet someone new um you may\nhave preconceived notion about color of\ntheir skin the you know maybe their\ngender uh maybe dogs like we were\ntalking about earlier is like someone's\nafraid of a dog you know um based on a\nprevious re like previous memory for\nthat that scared them and it it makes\nsense you that memory can change your\nreaction before you even get a chance to\nget to the normal emotional reaction\ntempers it changes the outomes the\npossible outcomes yes so let's take a\nlook at this depression biases is the\nrecognition of emotionally neutral faces\nthis is basically a paper that shows you\ncan see this or no you're seeing air\nserver [ __ ] I cannot see it that's okay\noh do you have it on screen I can see it\nnow I'm watching The Stream we're good\noh you're watching screen yeah don't\nchange anything you're good okay thank\nyou okay so depression biases the\nrecognition of emotionally neutral faces\nthis is super cool so we're going to\nlook at the combined hypothesis the\ncombined cognitive bias hypothesis of\ndepression let me find the right\nokay so at the level of interpretation\nprocesses dysphoric and depressed\nindividuals display a tendency to\ninterpret emotionally ambiguous\ninformation in a negative manner that's\nreally interesting actually findings\nsuggest that the ambiguity resolution is\ndistorted in the eff generation of\ninterpretations and the selection of a\nsingle interpretation is most likely\napplicable I'll explain what that means\nin a second because I think there's a\nsentence in here\nbasically here it is depressed yeah go\nahead can I interrupt for a moment um do\ndo you think do you think that that\nactually has a carryover to things like\ntext I found something kind of\ninteresting in the current generation of\npeople online where for a little while\nand I don't know if this is still the\ncase if you put a period on the end of\nyour sentence it was seen as rude as\ndisrespectful as negative do you think\nthat that carries over to things like\nthat communication Styles what do you\nthink I think it does yes absolutely and\nthis this is proof of it right so\nanything that is ambiguous so here's the\nkey thing when people are depressed they\nreport overgeneral and more negative\nmemories so anytime there's ambiguity\nour\nindas are affected by something over\nhere there's absolutely something that\nis altering the way that we perceive the\nworld this is the biggest thing that\npeople don't understand about depression\nis that the the real thing that\npropagates depression is actually a\nproblem with our\nperception okay so people don't realize\nthat they you see the world as negative\nin depression and this is the crazy\nthing it's not that you see the world as\nmore negative than other people all\nhuman beings actually have a bias\ntowards the positive this is why the\nlottery exists because everyone thinks\nno one thinks probabilistically everyone\nthinks I'm better than the average\nperson even though that's statistically\nuntrue y so depressive people people who\nare depressed are actually better let me\nsee if I can find find\nit are better gaugers of reality than\nregular people are but so what we we\nsort of discover is that people who are\ndepressed are better gaugers of reality\nbecause they don't have that positive\nbias the problem is in order for the\nhuman brain to function healthily we\nrequire this stupid bias we we require\nan extra layer on it to be like no it's\nactually better than that or you're have\nhealth function so so the glass is\nactually more half empty and then the\nother problem is that there are other\nproblems of perception so like people\nwill tend to overgeneralize in\ndepression we'll get to that in a second\num and then they they just they see the\nnegative things so if if you uh someone\nis depressed and they look at an\nemotionally neutral face they will see\nthat face as a negative face even though\nit's neutral so you start to interpret\nall neutral stimuli in a negative way so\nthere's absolutely a shaping of the\nindria which you correctly discovered\ngood job yeah no this this all makes\ncomplete sense because I at a time in my\nlife I was depressed for a while and you\nare completely accurate when you see\npeople that are just neutral you think\noh that person's looking down on me oh\nthat person feels negatively about me\nthey're not showing an expression like\nthat because they they don't want to say\nit you know that kind of a thing they\ndon't want they don't want to tell me\nthat they feel bad about me so yeah I\ntotally get it totally so so now we're\ngoing to get to something even not more\ninteresting but let's let's kind of\nactually let's go back to Memories so\nhow how are memories\nformed like what do you think goes into\nwhat gets saved to your hard drive when\nyou form a memory I think it's it's that\nthe original memory modifying from the\nindria and then the emotional reaction\nthat that gets saved and then we have\nthe chance to go and maybe analyze it\nlater sometimes people do sometimes\npeople don't okay introspection is what\nhappens there perfect we'll talk about\nthat in a second so let me ask you\nthis what is the effect of the size of\nthe emotion that we experience\non the memory that is\nformed I would say that's pretty\ncorrelative a lot like if if it's a\nlarger emotional response it's more\nlikely you're going to remember that\n100% right so we talked about the\nhippocampus and the in the\nthe now next question is when I recall a\nmemory what happens in my\nmunus and monus is the emotional Center\nso with that for me I don't know if this\nis the same for everybody because I only\nhave my perspective on that I relive\nthat scene so I'll have like a full\nvideo of that I feel the emotion of that\nmoment um whatever it's going to be I\ncan recall it but again it's recalling\nit based on kind of partial fuzzy\ninformation because from okay so now\nwe've got a big problem the more emotion\nwe experience the\nworse the more corrupted the save file\nis because it's not geared towards\nreality because our emotions are\ndrastically changing what the actual\ninput is\nthat totally makes sense I agree with\nthat emotions change the way we perceive\nthe world and the stronger the emotion\nthe more distorted it is the more but\nthe higher the emotional energy the more\nlikely we are to remember\nit yeah this and now you're getting a\nbunch of corrupted memories yes this is\nthe way that we that changes your\nperception and it it ends up being a\nrunoff effect yes 100% now let's like\njust use a simple very practical example\nthis is evolutionary by the way so\nwhat's your favorite Thor oh I know\nyou're Frugal yeah I was going to say\nwhat's your favorite uh hold on okay\ngive me what what do you what's your\nfavorite the last time I the last time I\nate really really well at a restaurant\nwas Fogo to Chow okay I love a Brazilian\nMeat House like steak house and kind of\nstuff but like that's so rare yeah okay\nso a real big Rarity for me so Fogo to\nchiao okay so you've got this Brazilian\nsteakhous now let's say that you've\neaten at Fogo dechow like five times and\nyou loved it every single time oh yeah\nand now if you eat at it a sixth time\nand you get food poisoning what is going\nto happen the next time someone asks if\nyou want to go to Fogo to\nChow I would probably look up the health\nreport for that place because if it\nhappened to me likely happened to others\nand if that one is the one that's the\nproblem then I'd be kind of you know\nsuspect of it I probably wouldn't change\nmy feeling of Fogo to Chia overall as a\nrestaurant chain I would feel about that\none specific one may have a problem okay\nwe're going to we just have to make a\nnote this is too good dude this is too\ngood a check Health Report we're going\nto put that into we're going to see what\nhappening what is happening in your mind\nwhen you do that so the what what\nhappens with most human beings is that\nyour body will have an instinctive\nreaction to avoid the place even if it's\nbeen good for you and that's because\nfrom an evolutionary perspective if you\nget sick from water once and you survive\nit we don't want to take a chance we're\ngoing to go to a different Watering Hole\nso part of the reason that this all this\ndepress stuff happens is because from an\nevolutionary perspective we are biased\ntowards the negative if I fight a snake\nfive times and it doesn't bite me and it\nbites me once like that's enough like I\ndon't need to learn my lesson a second\ntime so negative things way\nmore heavily in our mind in our calculus\nof what gets recorded than positive\nthings yeah no that makes sense so as we\nso we store this emotion and then this\nis the other thing to understand is when\nwe store when we store a memory it goes\nwith the emotion so now we're going to\nadd something else which is a sucar\nchanged by it and stored with it yes and\nso now what happens is when I think of\nthe memory or if the memory gets\ntriggered right so that it you're pretty\nlucky because it seems like you had a\npretty amicable divorce but for the 50%\nof people who do not have amicable\ndivorces even the sight of their ex\ncomes with a torrent of emotional energy\ntotally makes sense in the world of\nphysics\nnothing can be created or destroyed\neverything is just energy right this is\nlike a universal principle this is true\nof emotional energy as well so whatever\namount of energy becomes dormant in our\nmind will be recalled at a later date if\nit is triggered in the right way no I\nagree with that I think the way that I\nhandle that is lots of introspection if\nI'm like there's a time bomb in there I\nneed to do something about that I'm\ngoing to go sit down and think it out so\nI can let it out in a way that is\nhealthy and not damaging to other people\nyes that step is going to enter into\nthis this we're going to get to that in\na second uh so we have a storehouse of\nemotions okay now this is also where so\nthis is where we can do a quick aside to\nsomething like trauma or even we can\nlook at depression so there was for a\nwhile we believed that Depression was\nsort of a neurochemical imbalance like\nthere was a deficiency of serotonin in\nthe brain that's probably not really the\ncase what we sort of to now know is that\nthe number of adverse childhood\nexperiences that you have so this can be\nlike divorced parents it can be abuse it\ncan be getting bullied it can be moving\naround a lot there's just like a list of\nwe've done Big Data kind of analysis of\nthis the more adverse childhood\nexperiences you have the more likely you\nare to be depressed later in life and\nbasically what's going on is for each of\nthese negative experiences we are\nincreasing huh you're setting the\nperception you're setting absolutely\nyou're you're creating these negative\nemotional energies these negative\nemotional energies do not get\nmetabolized or digested properly which\nmeans that these things then get\nrecalled over here into your sensory\ninput and it shapes the way that you see\nthe world okay so now let's talk a\nlittle bit\nabout how do we metabolize this this\nemotion so how is it that you metabolize\nthe in uh the\nemotion so when I do that if I have an\nemotional response and I there's kind of\na limit right it's like there's a moment\nthat's happening where the emotional\nresponse starts analytical side kicks up\nand it goes is this a measured emotional\nresponse to the situation does this make\nsense to have this emotional response\nright now and if it does I go okay let\nit go right and if it doesn't make sense\nto have that emotional response I go I'm\ngoing to step back for a minute I'm\ngoing to disengage from this\nconversation to that emotion handles for\na moment right we're not going to yell\nabout it we're not going to scream about\nit we're going to freak out about it\nwhatever's going on there and then we\nre-engage with the conversation we\nhandle the conversation whatever is\ngoing on and then that gets stored and I\nsit down and we'll introspect on that\nlater to find out like what was going on\nthere why did I have such a strong\nreaction to something that didn't\ndeserve such a strong reaction if that\nmakes sense great so which part of your\nmind is doing that analytical sign 100%\nyes yeah so this is very important\nthis decays the emotional energy and\nthis is where we this is great check the\nHealth Report what is that that's your\nbuy acting this this is done by the buy\nand if you didn't check the Health\nReport then your emotional response\nwould be would get to go off all of\nthose restaurants are bad right right so\nit's the same thing with people it's the\nsame thing with animals it's the same\noverall it's pretty easy to become\nracist if you have one bad interaction\nwith person of a particular skin color\nand you don't have the analysis in place\nto be like\nindividual now we also so we've done a\nreally cool thing so we've discovered\nthat the the way out of all of this\nstuff is\nour ability to analyze so now let me ask\nyou a\nquestion let's say this\nis uh hold on let me think about this\nlet's this is analytical\ncapability this is age starting with\nbirth what do you think what does this\ncurve look like let's say death I think\nit definitely go it 100% goes up over\ntime your analytical ability goes up\nwith age is what I found and it's mostly\nbecause I have more experiences to call\nupon to explain the situation okay I\nhave experience let me ask you this so\nif this is if this is true and our budy\ngets\nstronger which if I have an experience\nat time Point T1 and an experience at\ntime Point T2 which one do you think is\ngoing to color my perceptions of the\nworld\nmore it depends\nand you said if our buddy gets stronger\nit doesn't always I feel like that's a\nmuscle that you have to flex sure you\nhave to train that would you agree that\nthe average person who is 25 has a more\nrobust budhy than the average person who\nis five yes absolutely so which I would\nsay that the first one colors our\nimmediate emotional response more than\nthe second one but the second one can be\nmore tempered by those experiences\nthrough absolutely right so good job\nThor you just discovered why\npsychotherapists talk about childhood oh\nit all makes sense I mean it does make a\nton of sense so yeah right because if we\nsort of think about it when we have\nexperience as a child we don't know so\nlike let's say I'm four years old and my\nparents are getting divorced let's say\nI'm 24 years old and my parents are\ngetting divorced when I'm 24 years old\nI'm like thank [ __ ] God it was\nmiserable being at home with them they\nabsolutely they did it for a while but\nlike I can see that they're not happy\ntogether and it's so much easier this\nway yeah when you're a kid you think\nit's the end of the world and because\nyour capacity to analyze it is not good\ntherefore you think they're getting\ndivorced because I did something wrong\nand then this gets stored in your\nConsciousness as a sscar and then the\nsscar activates at all kinds of random\nass times whatever triggers the some\nscarc activation and now what's\nhappening is my my so if I fundamentally\nfeel unloved this this saves I am\nunlovable into my hard drive\nand now this is going to color your\nperception of the world if someone you\nhave some kind of ambiguous response hey\nI'm sorry I I don't think I can be in\nthis relationship anymore oh [ __ ] I'm\nunlovable then I think that also gets in\nthe way in specific situations where a\nperson is in a location where they're\nsucceeding so they feel that emotion\neven though they're in a loving\nrelationship they may sabotage it\nabsolutely this is 100% correct that so\nthis is the cool thing right so we can\nexplain so many phenomenon using this\nmodel that when when so now what's going\non is let's let's just take a look at\nthat example here's me here's you we're\nin a relationship you say I love\nyou my indas inter this is the what I\nget from the indria right indria Thor is\nsaying I Love You But Here Comes This\nstupid sscar back from when I was four\nyears old and my parents told me that\nthey loved me but then they like got\ndivorced anyway so what did I learn I\nlearned don't trust people who say I\nlove you it comes over here creates a\ncognitive filter and then I feel\nbad and then I get [ __ ] confused and\nthis creates all kinds of problems\nbecause I love you means it's weird like\nhow am I supposed to win this game when\nI love you makes me feel bad makes me\nfeel guilty makes me feel like this\ngoing to end yeah and it it ends up\nbeing one of those situations where they\nsay that to you you hear it and you say\nI have to end this before it goes truly\nwrong absolutely that ends up being the\nself- sabotage AB in situations we were\nalready winning demoralized programmers\nyep right even when they win they put it\nin the L column Yep this other person\nsomething cool they look at somebody\nelse and they go that guy could make it\nbetter than me absolutely same thing\nwith artist same thing with writers same\nthing with voice actors and instead of\nlooking at themselves three months ago\nlook at all the progress of made they go\nlook at that guy that guy's amazing okay\nso now we're getting to something\ninteresting so what is their analytical\nmind doing when they have a\nvictory they're putting themselves down\nthey're saying it's not a victory\nbecause that guy is that that person\nover there is more Victorious they did\nit better than me they did it faster\nthan me I can't do that yet but what\nshould the buddhi be doing what should\nthe analytical mind be doing at that\npoint they should be looking at their\nown their own progress soy should be\nsaying hey this is like new data that\ncounters our perception of the past\nbingo so what's wrong why isn't the\nbuddhi doing what it's supposed to be\ndoing\nthat's the part that I actually don't\nhave a solution for because for me for\nme it is immediate every time it's like\nokay well I failed here why so we don't\nfail in the same way again exciting\nright we get something new we learn\nsomething about it and we can do\nsomething awesome there's there's always\nsomething to learn and always something\npositive to get out of that and I'm\nconstantly try to be honest with you I'm\nconstantly trying to try little things\nlike test little things with the intent\nof this will probably fail and then I'll\nlearn something about it so I can\nsucceed in a different one when the\nstakes are higher right fail in tiny\nways fail small ways now we've got now\nwe discover the missing piece because\nour model does not account for\neverything so first of all we've got\nindas let's just do a quick recap these\nare our sensory\norgans then we've got our\nManas which is our emotional\nmind then we've got our buddhi which is\nour analytical\nmind then we've got our Su scars which\nare balls of undigested emotion that go\ndormant and become recalled in the\nappropriate thing so but sometimes buly\ndoes a good job and sometimes it does a\nbad job so the big difference is whether\nit's being controlled by ego or a\nhamara so when my ego is involved So\nwhen you say they\ncompare in order to make a compare what\nare the let's talk about comparison what\nis required to make a comparison you\nneed to have a preconceived notion of\nthat which means a memory to recall upon\nan emotion with that preconceive notion\nof what what is\nrequire whatever it is so when I when I\nam making a comparison right so we're\nusing this example of this other person\ndid it better than me what is required\nfor that so you need to have two sets of\ndata you need to have the data that you\nhave that is your perception of that\nsituation or that that individual or\nwhatever is going on and then you have\nan expectation whatever the expectation\nis going to be it's like oh my work is\nlike this but their work is better than\nthis right the expectation is that your\nwork should be like their work because\nyou spend a lot of sure all that stuff\nis true but even deeper than that\nthere's a me and there's a you okay\nright there's your work and there's my\nwork now see here's the really\ninteresting thing if we literally go\nback and we listen to your\nlanguage about when you try something\nnew there is no ego there is no this\nother person and me I'm going to try\nthis thing because you are the one who\ntries it but it is about the trying it\nis not about a comparison if you really\npay attention to your words you will\nfind that there are very few ego related\nstatements I didn't even realize it yes\nyou're not going to actually quite funny\nright because you're you're GNA say I'm\nG to try this thing it it may work or it\nmay not work whereas if you're ego is\nactive I could fail or I could succeed\nliterally the the the world is the same\nthe thing works or it doesn't work the\nquestion is whether you add I to the\nequation or\nnot and if you listen to your language\nthis is how I know you're ready for the\nprestige class you don't make a lot of\negotistical\nstatements your ego is there it's\nsubtle there's a different version of\nyour ego at\nplay which is that oh I can't do\nsomething for myself I have to do some\nthings for other people which is the\nwhat how the ey is but anyway that's\nconversation for a different day okay\nlet's keep going so comparison requires\nego right so I I'm taller this person is\nshorter that requires a me and that\nrequires a you\nso then what tends to happen is we take\nthese some scars and the collection of\nsome scars become something called the\naamar which is the sense of I or\nego now here's the really interesting\nthing there are things that activate the\nego and things that dis deactivate the\nego and the number one thing that\nactivates ego is negative emotion in the\nmonus the a hum God is the bouncer of\nthe mind it's the it's the main tank and\nso if you think about what triggers my\nego it's when I'm being attacked in some\nway if someone is saying oh like hey\nlike you're a wonderful person that may\nlead to Ego but generally speaking it\ndoesn't I know it sounds weird I can\nunderstand that though because you have\nto have a strong sense of self to\nweather something like that so they\nactivating the ego would make the most\nsense it's like it's a protection\nmechanism it's like they say this but I\nI know who I am so this is why if you\nhave someone who's narcissistic valid\nation brings down the narcissistic\ndefense\nmechanisms right so that's not just\npeople who are narcissistic this for\nanyone who has defense mechanisms active\nthe more that you address the underlying\nemotions so we figured this out in\nPsychiatry a long time ago that's why\nwe're very validating because then the\nemotions calm down once the emotions\ncome down by the way the ego controls\nthe buddy this is the piece that we were\nmissing so sometimes the Buddy and the\nego\nclash and when they Clash if your ego is\nstronger then it's going to bully the\nbuddhi\nso I'll give you an example my favorite\nexample from when I was in college and\nwas terrible at\ndating so all o likes a girl I'm Olo by\nthe way in this story and Olo wants to\nask out a girl and Olo asks out a girl\nand girl says no Then I feel ashamed but\nI'm not really aware of my emotions but\nthen what happens I start making these\nstatements to myself and to other people\nto anyone who will listen I'm not that\ninto\nher you know ah her loss the self\n[ __ ] yeah right the self [ __ ]\nbegins yep now this is not like\nanalytical and so then literally what\nthe ego does is it goes to your budy and\nit says hey bro we're feeling bad give\nme a selective interpretation of this\ngive me something that feels logical\nthat can help us feel better so we're\ngoing to selectively ignore all the\nstuff that she's I'm in love with her\nand she's amazing and and all this kind\nof [ __ ] and then just give us all give\nus all the bad things about her because\nif we can put her down we can feel\nbetter about ourselves and then we don't\nhave to feel ashamed of ourselves this\nis how it works makes sense okay I can\nsee that now for like I have an\nexperience like that when I was in high\nschool actually I asked the girl out um\nshe actually said yes but I was really\nsocially awkward at the time date didn't\ngo well and it was more like okay well\nthis date didn't go well but it would it\ndidn't go well not not because she was\nrude but because I'm weird right it's\nlike one of those moments like I don't\nknow how to interact with people just\nyet and I need to work on that and that\nend up being kind of like a catalyst for\nme to be I need to understand social\nsituations better I need to learn that\nstuff so in that that's a situation\nwhere your buddy did a good job so your\nbudy was stronger than your ego on that\nday because if your ego had been\nstronger you would have said she sucks\nat relationships I'm fine right so when\nthe ego is subject to the buddhi then we\nwe'll do we'll move in the right\ndirection if the ego is controlling the\nbudy which frequently we don't realize\neveryone thinks that they're logical but\nlike very few people are right you can\ntake any political discussion yeah and\nthen like everyone is like my sance is\n100% logical you are 100% emotional it\nis the worst right and and so that's\njust because we don't realize that our\nlogic is not always under our control\nand this is where people say okay if\nyou're emotional you're not logical\nthey're missing a step emotion leads to\nEgo ego interferes with logic you can\nactually be logical and emotional at the\nsame time in fact your best performance\nand your\nclosest uh connection to the truth is\ngoing to be when your your monus and\nyour budhha are both active this is what\nwe call a flow state so we have a part\nof our brain called the Corpus colossum\nand then we have a right Hemisphere and\nwe have a left hemisphere this is our\nanalytical side this is our emotional\nside and this is the part of the brain\nthat allows the two to connect when\nsomeone has a history of trauma this\npart shuts off this is why people end up\ndoing things like dissociating what is a\ndissociation it is a analytical I'm\nbeing physically hurt right now but I\nfeel no emotions so you can analyze the\nsituation you can look at it\ndispassionately without emotions and\nthat's because the trauma is trying to\nshut this [ __ ] off we don't want these\ntwo things to connect on the flip side\nwe have this thing that everyone\ncultivates called The Flow State and\nflow state has increased activity across\nthe Corpus colossum in order to attain a\nflow State we need the right level of\nemot engagement with the right level of\nsynch synchronicity with our analytical\nbrain I'm actually interested there was\na kind of a case that I read before have\nyou ever seen the case of the guy who\nhad his Corpus kosum severed yes I'm\nactually really interested in that too\nin this case because Corpus kosum having\nso much control over this and in that\ncase what they had done is they actually\nhad him look at an image with one eye\nand draw it with the other one and then\nlook it with the other eye and then draw\nit with the other one and they were\ngetting like incorrect images out of it\ndid you see this yes so I don't know\nthat particular thing but we can you can\nI know what you're talking about yeah so\nlet's understand this that's because\nthere's all kinds of things so like the\nleft visual field gets processed by the\nright hemisphere we have this part in\nour in the back of our brain called the\noccipital lob and it's on both sides the\nproblem is that there's also other kinds\nof things so you can get like\nright-sided Hemi neglect and like you\ncan get all kinds of weird neurological\nphenomenon we can really get into it if\nyou want to we can like run through the\nNeuroscience but basically like so their\nright eye will connect to the left side\nof their brain which means and if\nthere's no Corpus colome what happens\nyeah so I'll tell you so like if I think\nI'm Rusty on this I always have to\nrefresh my memory but so right eye\nactually connects to the left side of\nthe brain which means that if you want\nto read words the right eye will be able\nto read words but the left eyee connects\nto the right side of the brain our\nlanguage processing is on our left so we\nhave no connection to language\nprocessing so it could be difficult to\nread words but you can identify a\npicture so like this is also the kind of\nthing where it's like do you recognize\nwhat this is the right brain says yes I\ncan recognize it I know exactly what it\nis but I have no access to my verbal\nbank so I can't tell you what it is but\nI know what it\nish and then if you look at like\nsomething with your right eye you may\nnot get any emotional response like who\nis this this is a picture of my kids how\ndo I feel I don't feel anything so\nthere's going to be all kinds of weird\nphenomena but then you get Hemi neglect\nand you'll get people who are drawing\nclock faces like\nthis that's actually really interesting\nthe idea that if you look at something\nwith your right eye you won't have an\nemotional response and many times we see\nin kind of like movies iconography\nthings like that is the squinting of one\neye when you're a sniper hold on no no\nno but but that's if your Corpus\ncolossum isn't intact oh if it's not\nintact okay that's why I was like wait a\nminute that's kind of an interesting\naside for that we're talking about this\nguy who has his Corpus colum Seer okay\nhe guy name something that he sees with\nhis left eye okay is there any time\nwhere the connection would be briefly\nshut down under any type of duress or\nanything like that yeah yeah so so this\nis what trauma does so so when you say\nshut down so we have to understand that\nI I don't think like there's zero\nelectrical activity but the whole point\nis that there is reduced electrical\nactivity which allow ows for some this\nphenomenon called hemispheric\nlateralization which means that we only\nonly one hemisphere is operating at a\ntime basically it's not as bad as a a\nclear physical severing but this is what\nleads to dissociation and numbness\nsuppression these all are features of of\nhemispheric lateralization and decreased\nactivity across the Corpus colos yeah\nthis is a whole area I know nothing\nabout so it's really\nfascinating so this is just we we'll get\nback to the the Sun side of it but we\ncould we'll I'll I'll I'll drop in\nNeuroscience here and there where it's\nrelevant okay I'm down yeah so now we\nkind of get back to a couple so now now\nwe've got all the pieces together so now\nlet's talk about and we still got to\ntalk about one big thing the thing that\nwe're going to teach\nyou so if you have someone who's\ndemoralized and you give them this piece\nof advice so this is what I would say if\nyou're a programmer who's demoralized\nfirst of all recognize that the way that\nyou see the world\ndepends on your Su\nscars or the emotional\ncontent of past\nexperiences so now we also discover the\nmechanism of psychotherapy which is what\nwe do in Psychotherapy is we take these\nmemories and then what the\npsychotherapist literally does the\npsychotherapist acts as a budy for you\nbecause your budy is out of whack and\nthey help you cognitively reframe they\nhelp you recall this emotional energy in\nthe present now you said that when we\nrecall\nsomething we feel that in the present so\nthis is what's really cool if you look\nat the science of people who are\ntraumatized yeah so here's my brain\nlet's say I have a\ntrauma this part of my brain is called\nthe posterior singulate cortex the\nposterior singulate\ncortex\nintegrates\ninformation and\ndecides on a course of\naction the thing is this is this is in\nthe present I don't know if that kind of\nmakes sense right so like makes sense if\nI'm trying to decide what to say I'm\nintegrating information I'm deciding\nwhat to say yeah remember back here\nwe've got our\nhippocampus yeah if Chad if you guys\nhave ever seen me like go and talk about\nsomething you'll see that pause for a\nmoment and then like kind of do a recall\nof like how do I reframe this that it\nworks for that specific person I'm\nguessing that's exactly in that moment\nright yes PCC is active now here's\nwhat's really interesting about trauma\nso we think of traumatic memories where\nshould traumatic memories live in this\ndiagram what do you think Thor I know\nyou're new to Neuroscience but where do\nmemories live new to Neuroscience this\num I mean at this point the Deep lizard\nbrain no like the the hippocampus\nabsolutely this is where memories live\nyeah unless you have PTSD then you get\nno\nactivity the trauma lives here really so\nthis is why people have flashbacks and\nthis is why this is why they can't get\npast the trauma trauma lives with them\nbecause it's literally not in the memory\npart of the brain it is not in the past\nit is a constant thing that you are\ndealing with today the part of your\nbrain that decides a course of action\ntoday is what's active when you're\nexperiencing trauma that's really\ninteresting when you do psychotherapy on\nsomeone who has PTSD and you ask them to\nrecall the\nmemory let's talk about when you were\nassaulted at the beginning of\npsychotherapy it activates their PCC as\nyou succeed in Psychotherapy it moves\nback to the hippocampus and then they're\nfree from their trauma so you can\nactually see that through you can see\nbrain scans brain scans it moves the\nmemory moves from the present to the\npast and this is why some people oh yeah\nthis person I never got over my ex in\nhigh school they're still living in the\npast I'm still caught up with my ex it's\n30 years later they've moved on but I\ncan't move on yes you literally can't\nmove on because the experience is is\nexisting in the present in your brain do\nwe understand the mechanism that causes\nthat to be there in the first place\ncauses what to be where the memory to be\nin the present at all times do we\nunderstand why that occurs yes okay\nbecause normally what happens with\nnormal experiences so let's look at\nnormal experience and it's it's not\nanything\nspecial so right now we're having an\nexperience right we're operating here at\nthe end of this conversation our brain\nis going to move it over\nhere this process is impaired in\ntrauma simple simple mechanism there's\nif you want more details I can give you\nmore details but the short answer is\nthat this is the process that's busted\nwhich is why we live with it and if you\nget someone's help they can help you\nmove it to the past this is also why you\ndon't necessarily need to do\nPsychotherapy this is why if you look at\nlike even studies on things like\npost-traumatic\ngrowth the people who so you can take a\ngroup of people and I know we're kind of\ngetting off track but let me know if you\nwant me to go back to track so if you\nlook at a group of people who are let's\nsay who've like experience genocide\nright so there's like hundreds of\nthousands of people and people we've\ndone psychological studies on them the\nreally interesting thing is that if you\nhave 100, people that someone tried to\nexterminate let's say 100,000 people\nsurvived not all of them develop\nPTSD in fact less than 50% usually\ndevelop something like\nPTSD and what happens is we know that\nthere's this function called\npost-traumatic growth which you've been\nthrough I've been through where we go\nthrough a traumatic experience and it\nactually makes us\nstronger and so a big part of that is\nthis process of what we call\nconstructing a\nnarrative and you can't construct a\nnarrative unless you've got multiple\npoints in time and some [ __ ] is behind\nyou so if you literally go through the\nprocess of constructing a narrative so\nwhen I was was working at like a an\naddiction rehab at the end of the 30\ndays someone would have to write they'd\nhave to share their narrative so we\nstart working on this on like week two\nwhere you're going to tell the story of\nyour relationship with the substance the\nfirst time you saw someone drinking the\nfirst time you got drunk how awesome it\nused to be it's like this beautiful like\nfour page 30 minute like catharsis of\nlike this is what alcohol this is my\nrelationship with alcohol and it's not\nall negative there's a lot of beauty and\nand it's just it's really powerful [ __ ]\nbut when someone does that it literally\nmoves things from here to here and then\nthey've moved past it and it has\ntherapeutic value their outcomes in\nterms of addiction recovery and\nproof postraumatic growth same process\nwe have to construct a narrative so\nreally a lot of the process then at that\npoint is trying to move it from PCC into\nthe hippocampus to make sure that it is\nnow seen as something that is no longer\na present threat it is now a past thing\nto recall to change future outcomes\nright which which part of the which part\nof our veic model does\nthat um the name is is escaping me yeah\nso you can use the English\nequivalent uh so in that case that'd be\nthat would be reliving the memory so\nyou're doing memory recall and then of\nthe what is it Sam samcara yeah the\nsamcara becomes active right so when\nyou're telling the story The Emotional\nenergy Rises to the Mind everyone's\n[ __ ] crying because it's really\npowerful [ __ ] and then and then our anal\nmind takes over after that absolutely Y\nand then we move past it that makes\nsense and it's just it's recalling it\nreliving the emotion reframing it and\nthen filing it back away again using a\nmore analytical approach rather than\njust having it up in you know Forefront\nof your mind all time you just did a\nbeautiful summary the best summary I've\never heard of what we call emotional\nprocessing makes sense yeah it's\nliterally what honestly it's many times\ncuz I've people have asked me what does\nit mean to emotionally process I've\nnever given them an answer as beautiful\nas the one that you just put together so\nthank you for that so anyone is\nwondering what is the what is emotional\nprocessing it's whatever the [ __ ] you\njust said I don't remember but that\nsounded\ngreat okay and this is why we need to\nprocess emotions because until we\nprocess our emotions now we're going to\ngo back to our demoralized person\nwhere's our demoralized\nperson so now they have to experience\nthat themselves you can't tell them it\ndoesn't work that way you have to feel\nthat yes yeah yeah so we also know that\nfor example there are studies that show\nthat when you talk\nabout emotional experiences\ndispassionately it doesn't work you have\nto activate the emotional circuitry yes\nin order for it to\nwork and and so now we've got the\ndemoralized person so there's the\nfailure all right and so remember the\nfailure then they have a Samara\nor their\naamar goes over here and then Alters\nthis experience and then they interpret\nin a particular way and remember the\ndemoralized person feels bad about\nthemselves right this is a me\nproblem it my project didn't fail I\nfailed I failed yeah they they they put\nthat as a I am the failure not this\nproject is the failure to learn from\nabsolutely the way that I try to frame\nthat for people is I always tell them go\nmake something tiny make something tiny\nand expect the project to fail and learn\nsomething from it and then move on to\nmake another thing and expect that to\nfail and learn something from it and as\nyou learn from this look back on your\npast project and go look at how much\nbetter my project is now today because\nof what I learned as a result of those\nfailures so here's how we're going to\nhelp the people they can't do that yeah\nbecause some of them can not all of them\nyes but the reason they can't well the\nones that can do it have the ones that\nBui is stronger than a humar the ones\nwho have a humar stronger than budy\nthey're not going to be able to apply it\nso this is when we get to okay how do we\nhelp demoralize programmers we teach\nthem this stuff so this by the way we I\ndon't know if you remember we talked\nabout the\novergeneralization in depression so we\ndon't view things specifically we lose\nall sense of nuance why did this project\nfail there are a thousand different\nreasons besides me that the project\nfailed but when we enter into this\nnegative mind frame this AAR mind frame\nwe overgeneralize to\nourselves applying everything to\nyourself ego is the mother of all\novergeneralizations it's me it's me it's\nme no there's a thousand different\nreasons why you broke up there's a\nthousand things going on in her life\nthere's a thousand reasons why this\nperson didn't didn't swipe right on you\non Tinder there's all kinds of [ __ ]\ngoing there's a whole world out there\nwith like 8 billion people and weather\nand patterns and physics and all kinds\nof stuff going on you're just a tiny\nSpeck in existence very little has to do\nwith you yeah absolutely but the\novergeneralization is the mother of this\nis the source of ego\nokay um so how do we help this person we\ndo two things one is we can digest their\ns scars so remember that this emotional\nenergy up here\ngets\nactivated and then affects our\nexperience in the present right that\nstored emotional energy so if we can\ndecompress that if we can remove all the\nthe crap from the sucar if we can\nmetabolize the sucar that will go away\nbecause if you kind of think about it I\nthink that kind of a situation is really\nfor like more of a professional setting\nis more effective for that for many\npeople we we'll talk about Professionals\nin a second this is just this is the\nscience of it how to do it we'll get to\nin a second second but this is what I\nwant yall to realize so if you are a\nprogrammer who feels demoralized the\nreason and even demoralized is a good\ngood word because you are not\ndemoralized because of one thing you are\ndemoralized because of the\nstorehouse of failur and today when you\nfail the reason you're demoralized and\nyou give up is not because you failed\ntoday it's because you add the energy of\nall of your previous failures onto this\nfailure this is why it's overwhelming to\ndeal with it's not just this failure\nyou're not looking at it in isolation\nthey do it once and then they fail again\nand they fail a third time and then what\nhappens now I've failed three times in a\nrow you stack them all together without\nprocessing each one and then the fourth\nfailure you're not dealing with one\nfailure you're trying to manage four\nfailures this is how you get these kind\nof patterns of people who are like I've\ntried everything and nothing works\nfailure after failure after failure\nStacks up\nnobo OPP of plus sibo so plus sibo is\ncan you explain that term yeah so plus\nsibo is if we think something is going\nto work it\nworks and no sibo is if we think\nsomething isn't going to work it doesn't\nwork very simple so it's kind of just\nnegative Placebo yeah it's a negative\nPlacebo so there's all kinds of\nneuroscientific mechanisms it affects\nyour cortisol and this and that and we\ncan get into that it's conversation for\na different day but it's a it's a Well\nstudied effect if you don't believe it's\ngoing to happen it's it's going to\nhappen it's not going to happen we know\nthat the effect of placebo and nobo is\nprobably somewhere around 30 to 50% of\nlike the outcome yeah no I I I actually\nyou see that every day people are like\nwell I can't do this so I'm not going to\ntry or if they if they say I can't do\nthis but I'm going to try anyway and it\nfailed just like I thought it would\nright that's a super common thing really\nreally common yeah it's very common so\ngoing back to to people who are\ndemoralized we can do one thing for them\nso you can process your negative\nemotions you can also reduce your ego so\nthere are certain meditation practices\nthat you can engage in and stuff like\nthat or even you can do some level of\ncognitive retraining so I failed versus\nlike so just appreciate for a moment\nthat this isn't your failure this\nproject failed and the more that you\nliterally use a different kind of\nlanguage and different perspective if\nyou cognitive ref frame to that the ego\nwill start to decrease you can also do\nthings like shuna meditation which is\nmeditation on the void we'll get to that\nin a second we're going to get to\nsomething for you in a second I know\nyou're excited we'll get there don't\nworry I know I was like what is that\nyeah no I'm gonna we're GNA meditation\non the void yeah I know okay we're\ngetting there you're you're next we've\nhelped the demoralized people so these\nare the two things and the third thing\nto do if you're demoralized by whatever\nis happening in your life is just like\nstart swimming in this Frame workor\nstart picking a part what does it mean\nto me demoralized what part of me is\nactually being affected what am I\nfeeling\nemotionally notice your thinking is your\nthinking even logical you're going to\nthink it's logical but hold on a second\nreally simple test that you can you can\ndo to see if your thinking is logical if\nsomeone else was in the same situation\nwould you say the same thing to them\nthis voice in the back of your mind that\nyou talked about and then everyone says\nof course not why not why wouldn't you\nsay that to them well tell me why why\ndon't they say to other people\nThor because they don't I guess I guess\nthe biggest thing is when you see it\nfrom your own perspective for yourself\nyou see all the weak spots that other\npeople don't see even if you saw someone\nelse's weak spots would you yeah would\nyou talk to them way them the way that\nthey talk to you this may be hard for\nyou I just realized because you don't do\nthis I don't do that so it's difficult\nyeah so I'll tell you I'll tell you what\nthey say but they're\ndifferent\nI'm me and they're\nthem right it's a different standard for\nyou and other people you may not\nunderstand you're too far along you've\nqualified for the prestige class is\ngoing to be confusing for you that's\nlike super confusing for me I know it's\nyou're not to be honest with you I don't\nunderstand that there's a different\nstandard for me compared to other\npeople right so let me give you an\nexample so when I when I show up on\nstream I try to help people right yeah\nand who deserves the\nhelp\ntoday anyone and people are going to\nwatch this video people are going to\ninteract with it I mean anyone who\nhappens upon it but even people who\ndon't see it do frankly but they may not\never get it what about\nyou yeah I mean I'm I'm here for that\nright I'm here so you're including\nyourself but like it's for the help of\neveryone and you're sticking yourself in\nthere but if we go back to it this super\nsubtle it's there in you but it's going\nto be so subtle that you may not be able\nto detect it you were interested in\nsomething I'm interested in something\nI'm interested in the and you chose to\npick demoralization of the people in\nyour audience over you specifically yes\nyes the reason why I feel that way is\nbecause I most definitely am in a\nposition where I feel very comfortable\nin my life incredibly so and I have I\nhave the like basically this kind of set\nup they deserve it more than you do I\nkeep that yeah they do that's what it is\nthey deserve it more different standard\nfor make more plainly simple yes\ndifferent standard for them compared to\nyou yes it's not so hard to understand\nno just in your case you're objectively\nright but in everyone else's case that\nsets standards for other people they're\nobjectively wrong it's all in their head\nit's a bias but in your case you have\nall this subjective evidence see as soon\nas the ego enters the analytical mind\ngets short circuited you're you're G to\nlaugh chat every single day is like you\ndeserve it you deserve it I was like nah\ndifferent standards for thee than for me\nyep your problem is that your alignment\nis on the good side you're like lawful\ngood or chaotic good or some [ __ ]\nneutral good so now you get to use this\nego it's still operating with you this\nis physics baby you're not immune even\nif you're a good person no 100% you have\nto level up in the prestige class to\nbecome\nimmune we're going to teach you that in\na second okay but this is this you say\nit's really foreign but you just\nunderstand it this way that you still\nhave a different\nyeah and the second that you're a hum\nkicks in I have a standard someone else\nhas a standard and if you're thinking\nthat way and then you're like yeah but I\nhonestly I deserve it less than other\npeople what do you know about the people\nwho are demoralized you don't know what\nthey deserve I don't you're\novergeneralizing and making some\namalgamation maybe they deserve it less\nthan you do the way that I feel about it\nis even if they don't deserve it that is\nnot my choice to make ever so I'll give\nyou an example someone will come to me\nand they say hey I really want to make\nvideo games it is never my position to\nget in the way it is never my position\nto get in the way of that kind of\nAdventure of self-discovery right\nbecause I could be gatekeeping I could\nbe like oh you never make it don't don't\neven try right but I've just robbed two\nthings I've robbed the world of a\npotentially awesome thing that they\ncould have made I've robbed actually\nI've robbed more than two things I've\nrobbed them of the experience of of\nunderstanding that maybe understanding\nthemselves more and I've robbed anyone\nelse that could be inspired by the work\nthat they\ncreated of course I'm going to spend the\ntime to do it even if it turns out\nthey're undeserving of that that's not\nmy place to tell in the beginning good\nit's not my place at all yeah so I I\nagree completely with you so I I think\nthis this is where like what I've sort\nof concluded is this idea of deserving\nis like I don't know who judges that\nthat ain't that ain't yeah the only\nthing that we know about deserving from\na scientific perspective is it has to do\nwith your ego the ego is what decides\nwho deserves what I deserve this I'm an\nincel I deserve to get\nlaid right so it's ego ego is this what\nI I don't I'm I ain't no moral judge I\ndon't know [ __ ] just like you and the\nmore that ego enters the equation you\nwill decide what people are deserving\nnot deserving of I don't have that\nwisdom okay makes sense now let's get to\nyour part okay anyway let's let's finish\nso couple of things there are all kinds\nof exercises you can do okay so one is\nto adjust the your perception so there\nare practices called brara which\nstrengthen your perception and this is\nwhere we have this big problem in\ndepression the problem with depression\nis that we have an inciting\nevent something genuinely bad\nhappens this has an emotional\nreaction this then turns into a\ncognitive\nbias which then we have a bunch of\nambiguous\nstimuli or even positive\nstimuli\nthat we start interpreting in a negative\nway and then we discount this stuff so\nthis cognitive bias is what then what\nhappens is the world that you live in\nbecomes objectively worse because of\nyou're filtering out information so if\nyou're a demoralized programmer changing\nyour percept strengthening your\nperception which is one of the things\nthat we have gotten the weakest at in\nour society the most atrophy I think the\nnumber one reason why mental health is\ngetting worse in the world today is\nbecause our powers of perception have\ngotten weaker I actually I talk about\nthis quite a lot is there's there's a\njoke that I have which is the only day\nthat the way that people act on April\nFool's Day is the way that they should\nact in general which is they meet the\ninternet with scrutiny they say wait a\nminute is that real before they\nimmediately engage and kind of go on\nwith it and April Fool's Day is the only\nday that happens and that should be\nevery day April Fool's Day should be\nevery day yeah love that so you can you\ncan adjust your perception through\npractices called prahara\num you can you can digest the content of\nyour some scars you can sublimate your\nego and if you do these three things you\nwill no longer be demoralized you will\nbe able to turn into Thor if any all out\nthere want to be Thor this is how\ntransform you get the hair and\neverything yes all comes together\nyeah now let's talk about you for a\nsecond now we get to the punch line or\nmaybe the beginning\nactually so this is going to be kind of\nweird I'm going to actually stop screen\nsharing oh we're going to go back\nto this and we're g to move\nyou over\nhere okay move it around we're gonna go\nback to talking hello so there's the\nphysical\nform okay what did we just map out we\nmapped out the entire mental process for\neverything the mental process very good\nyeah\nso here's the question if we look at a\nunit that is\nThor does a physical process and a\nmental process\nencapsulate have we filled out that\nthing is Thor physical plus mental yeah\nokay so this is wrong really yes so now\nI'm gonna actually\nwait your mental state can definitely\nset the tone for how you feel about your\nphysical state if that's what you mean\nnope I'm I don't mean that yeah so now\nwe're going to get to so now here's the\nthing interest there are periods of time\nwhere your ego is inactive right okay\nthere are periods of time where your\nbuddhi is\ninactive yeah there are periods of time\nwhere your Manus is\ninactive\nokay so you can have a sensation of\nthought you can have a sensation of\nemotion you cannot be having an ego\nreaction so I'll give you maybe an\nexample maybe this works for you maybe\nit doesn't but sometimes like let's say\nsay look at look at a sunset so there\nare times where we look at a sunset\nwhere we don't exist within the mind\nthat we lose our sense of time that we\ndon't have any particular thoughts we're\nnot we feel good like it feels good but\nthere isn't an emotion it's not a\nvariation in the M us there is a\ncontentment but not necessarily an\nexcitement not necessarily a\njoy there is just a kind of like a weird\nBaseline level of\nexistence I actually have a time period\nin my day every day where I do that\nwhere I focus on nothing uh it's usually\nabout an hour a day during my kind of\nfree time and I will try to focus on\nnothing I may be doing an activity at\nthe time that that's happening but I\nwon't be thinking about how to solve\nthat I'll just be letting it be blank\nand that's usually when I'm hanging out\nin the ferret rescue when I'm playing\nwith the ferrets doing ferret time like\nthat people see me on video for it I\njust no thoughts only only hanging out\ndoing the thing yeah so what are you in\nthat moment\nnothing which is kind of nice for just a\nmoment there there's no Machinery\nrunning there's no no systems to be\nsolved there's nothing it is turned off\nand it's it is my barricade after being\non stream and handling lots of questions\nand helping a lot of people it is my\nbarrier between that and doing the other\nthings that I want to do in the day is\nI'll have that hourong thing now this is\ngoing to be weird okay so this is why\nyou you're ready for the presious Clash\nbecause you've been doing it for a while\nokay so you've stumbled into meditation\nthe truest essence of meditation so but\nnow we're going to go into something\nelse so you say that it's nothing but\nI'm going to tell you that that is the\nfullest moment of your\nexistence okay does that make sense to\nyou it does because in that\nmoment it is the other types of things\nthat are going on are kind of irrelevant\nI'm just there and it's nice and that's\nit right so now if we really look look\nat it all of the things that are\nsomething about you are actually\nperturbations of the fullness of your\nexistence they detract from the fullness\nof your existence now you become reduced\nto a thought to an emotion to a problem\nsolving to a physical sensation whereas\nactually when you step away from all of\nthose reductions of self this is when\nyou feel the fullest version of yourself\nthat makes sense because it doesn't need\nto be split off fragmented into pieces\nvery good\nright so this is what we\ncall that's a hell of a name it's it's\nit's a hell of a name right so this is\nIt's considered it gets translated in\nthe western religious framework as a\nprayer but it's not a prayer it is a it\nit is\na understanding of the nature of\nexistence\nso there is the\nhole and you can take a drop out of the\nhole and the hole Still Remains whole\nthe hole actually exists within the drop\nand then the drop can re remerge into\nthe hole it's [ __ ] weird until you\nhave these kinds of experiences you're\nnot going to understand this but you're\nactually experiencing the fullness of\nyour existence in those\nmoments here's why meditation is\nimportant for you formal practice is\nimportant for you this is just layer one\nin the same way that we have explored\nthe physical world by making a simple\nobservation of gravity we have these\nbasic sense organs but then we can if we\nadvance in this realm in the physical\nworld we can make rocket ships and we\ncan harness energy and we can make solar\ncells we can make computers we can make\nartificial worlds and second life in the\nspiritual realm you have entered at\nstage\none there are stages of this fullness\nthat are even way bigger than this\nthat's the hard it's hard to describe\nbecause now we're getting into the\nundescribable Realms language does not\ncapture\nit okay and so the reason you need to\nmeditate is because there's there's like\nall kinds of cool stuff on that road\nyou've stumbled into Road step number\none on your own not actually on your own\nbut that's a conversation for a\ndifferent day but there are more subtle\nand what I would call Transcendent\nStates Of Consciousness which we have\nsome EV we've always had evidence for\nthrough spiritual experiences but now\npsychedelics is making this revival and\npeople are able to access these states\nmore freely the problem is with\npsychedelics you don't get to control\nwhere you go that makes sense and and\nthen going back to you know this\nquestion about Star Trek like so that is\nanswerable like so once you sit in the\nfullness of your experience what you'll\nrealize is that is that a different\nConsciousness no because we're all part\nof the same ocean in fact my\nConsciousness and your Consciousness\nwill be linked and you'll be able to\nfeel that if you explore far enough so\nthat's actually the same thing that like\nremember when I was talking about it's\nnot my place to send away of the other\nperson that's because when I'm gone the\nthings that they learned and did will\ncontinue on and that way any person\ntheir actions become immortal you're\nalready linked with them there's no\nreason to treat them badly and stop them\nfrom entering that stuff because\ntogether you are creating a richer\nculture than there was before there's no\npoint in standing in the way of that\nyou're actually hurting everyone\nincluding yourself by doing so so now\nwe're going to do something hard okay\nnow we're going to do something that\nyou're going to have difficulty with\nthis is a beautiful analytical\nexplanation but the analytical\nexplanation is the translation of\nsomething that you know deep within\nyou that huh you're the same person yes\nyeah do you know what I mean this is\njust your I know what you mean you do\nnot believe that because you figured it\nout the belief or the knowledge came\nfirst and then this is your analytical\nmind yes yes so this is what we're\ntalking about this is why you're ready\nfor the prestige class my whole game\nheartbound the whole thing that I built\nfor it is as you go through it as you\ntreat people badly you yourself find out\nthat you can be treated badly it changes\nthe perspective of the character the\nwhole time that you treat people well\nyou yourself find that you can be\ntreated well because you are everyone\nthat you meet and they are everyone that\nthey meet it's the same and yeah that's\nkind of been the basis for that for most\nof my life that's like a pretty normal\nunderstanding for me so yeah I totally\nunderstand what you're saying about say\nyou are everyone and they are you and\nand this is what's weird right so now\nyou say this is a pretty normal\nunderstanding in the meditative\ntradition in the meditative tradition\nyou have stumbled upon one of the four\nmahavakyas Great\nsentences these are things that students\nof meditation are told to contemplate on\nin order to gain the understanding that\nyou\nhave and one example of this is aasi I\nam the universe that there's actually no\ndifference between me and anything else\nand this is also where if you look at\npeople who meditate they naturally\ndevelop compassion but we sit here and\nwe try to develop compassion you can't\ndevelop compassion compassion's real\nsource so if you sort of think about it\nare you compassionate towards your hand\nno there's no compassion towards your\nhand it's part of you you don't need any\ncompassion towards it the real source of\ncompassion is when you realize that\nother people in you are no different\nyall are all part of one weird [ __ ]\norganism and so why would you hurt your\nhand you wouldn't and in the same way\nit's stupid to hurt other people but\nonce you understand aamas you have some\ninkling of this you've done a lot this\nis very good and what I'm telling you is\nthat if you're interested there's a\nformal\ntraining\nfor future steps people have walked this\npath you're pretty far along but if you\nreally want to know like even there's\nweird karmic stuff too but you know I I\nI think you'd like it I understand the\nidea of like Karma versus ver Dharma\nwhich is like your requirements versus\nlike the best thing you can do and how\nthey those can be different from each\nother I don't know if that's all that\nyou're talking about but yeah no talk\nmore than that more than that okay that\nmakes sense right so there are many\nthings in this area I don't know so that\nmakes sense I I I understand so so and I\nthink these are for future conversations\nand it's not the simple reason the\nsimple question is why are you the way\nyou\nare yeah right so so you have a lot of\nyou have a lot of karmic setup for\nSpiritual prce practice number one at\nthe top of the list is you're amicably\namicably divorced yeah so you're free\nfrom you're essentially you you've got a\nvery if we looked at your character\nsheet and we looked at your background\nyou're very similar to a monk you're\nintuitively\nFrugal you don't really care too much\nfor material things I have so little\nstuff you have freed yourself your your\nsoul has freed you from the bounds of a\nmarried life we have haven't talked\nabout whether you're lonely or not but\nif you're lonely I we'll talk about how\nyou're lonely I'll tell you how you're\nlonely you're lonely because of\nconditioning you're not actually lonely\nbut if you have some degree of\nloneliness left it's an echo from\nprevious connection that I'd agree with\nI'm really yeah in that in that area I'm\nsuper fulfilled like I feel really good\nabout that so but there's the echo right\nthere's the memory of oh yeah there was\na point in my life when I enjoyed this\nthing and so you may find almost like\nthis small inkling towards it but when\nyou really stop and think about it\nyou're fine yeah yeah I agree with that\ncompletely yeah it's clear yeah so and\nand this is where I think you got to\nlearn this stuff man because I think\nyou're going to love it I think I am too\nthis is actually like way more than I\nthought this was going to be that's\nactually awesome as hell so yeah know\nthat that makes a ton of sense cool\nreally surprising actually me too I was\nnot I didn't know where this was\nactually I I had an inkling but\nanyway now that I I'm honest with myself\njust an\ninkling so now what what questions do\nyou\nhave now I'm interested in where more do\nI learn about this because I don't know\nthe terminology I don't know the\ndirection for that because you have you\nhave a lot of terms but there terms in\nlanguages I don't know right yeah so\nthat ends up being difficult to research\ndifficult to find okay so um and how I\nthink beyond that how do I apply that in\na way that doesn't get\nme disconnected from people that I talk\nto because I feel like there may be a\nchance for that if it's handled wrong if\nthat makes sense there's a chance for\nthat if it's handled\nright\nokay deeply\nterrifying yeah so so I mean this is\nwhat's going to happen so you've been\nwalking this path of basically\nsegregating yourself from the world\nright so you are in the world but you\nare not of it okay and so you're right\nthat as you continue walking this path\nyou will be less of it but it doesn't\nmean a bad thing it's not like you have\nto disappear and go to a cave in the\nhimalay that would certainly help if you\nwant to do live Basement you know pretty\nclose close to a cave we're almost I\nwouldn't worry so much about that but it\nit could happen but not yet and then in\nthe same way and the same forces in your\nlife that have brought you to this\nmoment will also you if all you have to\ndo is pay attention it'll tell you where\nyou're supposed to go you'll know\nwhether it's supposed to be right now\nyou have a very clear Duty that there's\na lot of people out there you're helping\nyou have ferrets and stuff like that so\nyou got to keep doing that you don't\nhave to give any of that up to do what\nI'm telling you to do yeah that makes\nsense I didn't think I would so yeah I\nthink you know that um so now the\nquestion is okay so like what's your\nnext step so this is where like I I\nnormally don't try to do this this is\nnot a plug but like we literally have a\nmeditation guide that I think you should\ngo through okay um I think it'll equip\nyou with all of the basic\nterminology it'll be I think you'll\nunderstand quite a bit of it it's just\ngoing to give you a vernacular so that\nyou can manipulate the concepts with\nyour\nmind the other thing that we can do is I\ncan teach you a meditation here and now\nwhich I'm curious to just try and we'll\nsee what happens I don't know that this\nis the right one or the wrong one but\nsince all the basic stuff normally I\nstart with Basics and Basics are all in\nthat guide so I want to teach you\nsomething else okay if you're okay with\nit yeah I'm definitely okay with it okay\nso what I want you to do is sit up\nstraight your neck needs to be straight\nyour spine needs to be straight your\nback needs to be straight and I think\nyou're going to need some space in front\nof you can you make a circle with your\narms in front of you like this kind of\nyeah okay it's around your mic but yeah\nokay so so you're going to need to be\nable to do that okay all right so what I\nwant you to do is start by closing your\neyes and I want you to imagine that\nthere is a string connected to the the\ntop of your head which is pulling your\nspine up so that you're very erect all\nright so imagine kind of like your you\nknow your spine is kind of like a\nclothes hanger and then your body is\nlike clothes just hanging on off the\nhanger but there's a lot of rigidity in\nthe\nspine are you comfortable yeah okay so\nnext thing that I want you do to go\nahead and open your eyes so I want you\nto make a ring with your\nhands okay and now this is going to be\ntricky I want you to look at the space\nin the middle of your hands look at the\nemptiness so at the beginning the mind\nwill see objects through the emptiness\nbut what you want to do is see The\nEmptiness not the object I'm GNA move\nthis out of the\nway so just\nlook and try to notice the\nspace you see the space or do you see\nobjects space okay so look at the space\nand now close your\neyes and now feel the emptiness in the\nmiddle of your\narms so now feel that emptiness within\nwithin the space of the\narms Okay this may sound weird but what\ndoes it feel like to\nyou I guess the basic term would be like\nkind of like rigidity like a jelly that\nMak sense yes yeah okay okay there's a\njelly\nyeah do you have a shapee of the\njelly try kind of what I want that to be\nI guess so what where do you feel the G\nwhere do you feel the emptiness When You\nClose Your Eyes in your hands or in in\nthe space but in the circle of your arms\nin the circle of the arms wherever that\nenclosed space would be okay does that\nmake sense so close your eyes do it\nagain okay so you can look first if you\ncan't feel it but I want you to just\nfeel that\nemptiness\nsure and now go ahead and relax your\narms and now what I want you to do you\ncan relax your arms you can put them\ndown in front of\nyou so now what I want you to keep your\nback straight neck straight so I want\nyou to feel the outside of your form so\nyou will notice that in your existence\nyou can feel your head you can feel your\nshoulders you can feel your arms you can\nfeel your back you can feel your even\npotentially the front of your chest your\nlegs but if you really pay attention\nkind of right around the area of the\nsolar plexus you're going to feel\nnothing there is an emptiness within you\nthere's an absence of space and you can\nstart from the outside and you can work\nyour way in and you'll notice that at\nsome point you stop feeling do you feel\nthis yes concentrate upon\nthat\nand now go ahead and come on back to\nus do you still feel\nit less but yeah okay so now there's\nadvanced stuff but to start you can do\nsome version of these three practices so\nif you want to you can start by looking\nat the space and then close your eyes\nand feel the\njelly and then throughout the day I want\nyou to notice emptiness within you okay\nthe other thing is that you'll notice\nthat all kinds of stuff is like I don't\nknow how to describe this\nbut there's all this stuff around it and\nall that stuff fluctuates and changes\nlike pixels on a screen but the\nemptiness within you is the screen\nitself so just spend some time there I\nthink I understand what you're saying so\nspend some time there and when you're\ndone spending time there and you want\nsomething else you're ready for step two\nyou let me\nknow okay no that makes a lot of sense\nokay and I I think the thing is with\nthat th that's I don't think that's the\nfirst time I've felt that no it's\nnot\nno that's really interesting because I\ndon't think I've ever intentionally done\nthat intentionally felt that in any way\nbut that is something that I've I have\nfelt that way before exactly and I'm\ntrying to place when I'll tell\nyou felt that place when you were\nstruggling and you put stuff in there to\nstop\nstruggling but there's nothing in there\nyes that's why you can put your\nstruggles into there and it\ndisappears you've connected to that when\nyou needed it most or if you were unable\nto connect to it you\nsuffered that point is what you\nconnected to when you transcended\nsuffering\nh i could be be wrong I'm just I'm\nreally interested because for me the way\nthat that felt was yeah it was kind of\nlike that that feeling when I had\nthere's there's a place that you go when\nit becomes too much and that place is\nsimilar to that but in the past it was\nbest way is to describe it as like TV\nstatic there's too much going on there's\ntoo much in there there's too much\nhappening that's not there anymore\nthere's nothing there and I think that's\nsomething that I I've never like kind of\nsat down and thought about that before\nthat's a different spot now\nwhere there's just an empty room if that\nmakes sense yeah I I think I sort of\nfollow you but the more static is there\nthe further you you are away from the\nempty room but at the same time the\nstatic really isn't there the only thing\nthat's always there is the empty room\nthe static is actually an illusion but\nit is\nso enticing or or engrossing engrossing\nis a better word the static can be so\nengrossing that you lose sight of your\nCenter okay yeah I don't have that\nanymore I think I used to have that a\nlong time ago when things were quite bad\nyes and as things went forward and I\nkind of unpacked stuff and I learned how\nto manage that myself I don't have those\nmoments anymore that's that's why I can\njust sit down and be like I'm here now\nthis is fine yes yes this is all\nconsistent so you do this for a while\nyou play around and then you let me know\nwhen you're ready for part two sure I\nwill also you can go learn where like\nwhat part of the world do you live in I\nlive in Washington state in the US okay\nso like the other thing that you can do\nis you don't have to do part two with me\nyou just go and go to some asham or\nMonastery or whatever Zen whatever kind\nof thing you want and then if you want\nguidance like if you're like hey I'm\ninterested in this particular thing or\nthis seems interesting to me or whatever\nlike you can you don't have to learn\nfrom me you can go learn from anybody\nnow that this has started for you it\nwill it'll go on its own so you just you\nask the universe for help if I happen to\nbe a manifestation of that Universe I'm\nhappy to but you can go anywhere and\nit's it's\nstarted train has left the station yeah\nthat's really like there's a there's a\nwhole thread you've basically unraveled\nthere for a sweater that I didn't even\nknow existed it's effectively how that\nfeels yes yes yes yes so now you just\nneed to keep pulling you don't need me\nbut I'm around I'm going to do that and\nyeah no I definitely reach out with that\nthat's actually there's a lot there now\nI'm really\ninterested thank you you're very\nwelcome no less than you\ndeserve you say\n[Laughter]\nthat oh man any last kind of thoughts\nquestions we've been at this for two and\na half hours two hours and 45 minutes\nit's been quite a while yeah I didn't\neven realize\nyeah well I think I think from me that\nis everything is there anything like I I\nwould ask is there anything from chat\nthat you guys want to ask\ngreat they're spamming chat with hearts\nI see all of\nyou\nnow the super villain Arc begins I'm on\nmy way this is it full\nMaster oh you've become the superv I'm\ngonna become corrupted and you're gonna\nhave to you're gonna have to take me\ndown this will be it this will be the\nENT and then you'll have a Redemption\nArc that's that's how it should go right\nthe full Heroes journey we'll\nsee I I some sometimes the sometimes the\nsuper villain just ends as the the\nRedemption aren't yet we'll see that is\ntrue okay so questions I'm happy to\nanswer questions that chat has yeah I I\nthink the only thing for me is um\ninterestingly enough you you said that\nit is when it works it means you become\ndisconnected from all these things\neffectively is that the path of becoming\na monk removing everything and realizing\nthat it's\nnot as important sort of a thing and and\nlike I I've seen this before the path of\ngoing down that\nand um I I think the biggest thing\nis for for people that want to go down\nthat route it ends up not being a\nchoice I've seen in many it's like a\ncalling sort of thing it's like this\nfeels correct this feels like the right\ndirection and so I understand that\nentirely and I'm I'm interested in where\nis the basis of that belief structure\nwhere did that be do we\nknow the origins of that absolutely\nbecause it seems like it seems like a\nhuman calling something that just kind\nof absolutely so the beautiful thing is\nthat so for the tradition that I'm a\npart of the origins is not the Ora so\nthe whole point is that it is not it is\nnot like this thing was discovered and\nnow it's known and now it gets\ntransmitted to you the whole thing is\nthat every person has to walk the same\nroad so the person who discovered this\ntradition you are that person you have\nto walk the same road so there was one\nguy probably about 10,000 years ago\nsomewhere between 5 and 10,000 years ago\nthat is probably known as Shiva or ADI\nYogi so there was one dude who's\nprobably from an anthrop anthropology\nperspective was probably someone who\ndiscovered basically like the stuff that\nwe're talking about\ntoday and then that guy started\nexploring in this way and then as he\nexplored more and more and more and more\nand more he started to like figure out\nall kinds of stuff\nand then what happens in the world is\nwhen you have a being like\nthis there is a natural drawing of other\npeople to these people this is why\nreligions form around them when they\nbecome quote unquote enlightened it's\nnot like you think Chad is actually a\ncult is\nthat we try very hard not to be a cult\nand if we ever stopped trying to become\na cult we would become a cult yeah\nthat's true but there is there is a\ndrawing towards of these people and I'm\nnot talking about me by the way looking\nat you I know so this is what happens is\npeople are drawn to you because of some\nyour Tranquility or some [ __ ] who knows\nbut there's something that people look\nto these people and they say okay like I\nwant a piece of what this person has but\nthat's probably historically where it\ncame from and then there's a set of\npractices that were developed that then\nlike there were a bunch of like gurus\nand then the gurus like but at the end\nof the day this is just an internal\nexploration where anyone who does this\nexploration will discover so far what we\nbelieve to be basically the same\nthing so anyone if there's a a shoe box\nand there's an object inside anyone who\nlooks in the Box will find the same\nobject and thus far and once you start\nthat Discovery you find the same object\nyes and so this is what kind of gets\nturned into what we call kind of the\nkarmic religion so this is like Hinduism\nBuddhism jism to a certain degree sism\nbut but there are independent\ncorroborations of this in Many religious\nTraditions so cabala is a good example\nlike in the Jewish tradition like if you\nlook at cabala texts and like the SED\nfrom Hinduism the texts are very similar\nif you look at Sufism so that these\nthese Paths of mysticism the mystical\nbranches of all of our religious\nTraditions are basically very similar\nthat's one of the things that like I\nhave a cursory knowledge of a bunch of\ndifferent religions and I found that is\nthe case there's many different sections\nthat are most mostly the same and then\nthere's very specific sections where\nthey Branch off of each other and yeah\nno I I totally understand that\ncompletely it's one of the reasons I\nended up not being heavily religious is\nbecause I was like I understand the\nmessage here I don't need to ascribe to\nthe one belief structure if that makes\nsense and that's this I had a very\nsimilar experience in terms of of\nfollowing a particular Gru so I studied\nwith lots of them because I didn't feel\nlike one was any particularly I mean I I\nI've had a couple that have been pretty\nimportant in my life but that too it's\nI've started to understand that that's\njust the person that I had in that\nmoment and that person helped me along\nthe journey and that's what a guru does\nyou don't necessarily need to attach\nyourself to one until the right one\ncomes along and you attach as long as\nyou need\nto that makes sense yeah yeah any other\nquestions from chat or does it did I\nanswer your question about where did\nwhere my question yeah yeah that answers\nmy question completely one last thing\njust about being a monk so I think that\nlike monk is a job but the whole reason\nyou don't need to become a monk to do\nthis the thing that you'll discover over\ntime though is that the lifestyle of a\nmonk\nphysiologically in supports or increases\nthe likelihood of creating the\nneuroscientific states that are\nTranscendent Consciousness that are\nsimilar to like psychedelic\nexperiences so for example when I'm\ndoing my more hardcore\nmeditations I have to be very careful\nabout what I put into my body so even\nlike if I eat meat or fast food a single\ntime the quality of my meditation goes\ndown to like 10 per. yeah I don't eat\nfast food at all like like it's I cook\nall my own food I do it really simply\nbecause it's just I feel terrible if I\ndon't like it just feel so that that's\nconsistent so you don't need I mean so\nthere are formal places where they do\nthat kind of stuff you're kind of\nfiguring it out as you go which is fine\num and over time what you'll kind of\nnotice is\nthat\nlike certain foods and stuff will like I\nwould describe it this way so that\ndoesn't become important until you start\ngetting quite Advanced so for the\naverage person they don't need to do\nthis but you kind kind of think about it\nlike a bodybuilder like if you're a\nbodybuilder then you have to be extra\nextra careful even 10 extra grams of\ncarbohydrates will completely [ __ ]\neverything up so the higher you go on\nthe bell\ncurve like the more sensitive you have\nto be to continue to to climb yeah\nthere's only like one time even a month\nthat I eat something that's like bad and\nit's I we have this joke in the Stream\nfor the burrito index where we determine\nhow many burritos I can buy from Taco\nBell based on the ad revenue from the\nstream and that's the only time I do it\nI was like okay I'm gonna eat three\nburritos from Taco Bell today and that's\nit and then like the rest of the month\nit's all cooked by me that's it and it's\nfunny too because the largest food\nexpense I have is those three burritos\nfrom Taco Bell cuz fast food crazy\nexpensive now I know it's crazy it's\nnuts wild yeah they're up to\n$516 at my local Taco Bell for a five\nlayer burrito up from like 475 last year\nwhat are the layers in a five layer\nburrito I don't know I just know they're\ncalled a five layer burrito and it's\nmore than a dollar a layer so I should\nknow right like it's ridiculous at that\npoint but no I've been we've been\ntracking it for a year now we've been\nwatching the burrito inflation over a\nyear which is quite funny that's sad\ndude it is sad yeah so I think this is\nthe universe's way of telling y'all to\nstop eating burritos yeah stop it you\nknow it's really bad that's the only day\nlike I'll eat them I'll I'll eat them\nbut it's the only day of the month where\nit's like I'm eating this with the full\nknowledge that I'm going to feel gross\nafterwards like fine right that's the\nthat's the one day for that you know\nrest of the month I just cook all for\nmyself okay cool man so any um other\nquestions from chat are\nwe that's up today are you still are you\nstill\nstreaming oh no I'm not streaming I rate\nit over to you I know but I mean are you\ngoing to stream now no I rated so I\nstream from about 1:00 a.m. to about 10:\na.m. PST every day sometimes up to about\n12: 1: a to 10 what yeah yeah I stream\nfrom about 1:00 a. to about 10: a.m. I\nstreamed a full nine hours before coming\non actually about 10 hours before I came\non you stream in the middle of the night\nyes every day so I started that\ntradition because it was a competitive\nthing on Twitch because I looked at the\nanalytics and I was like where's the\ntime where I can make Caron name for\nmyself right because you want to get\ninto what are called the kingmaker slots\ninside of the category the category is\nkingmaker slots are the top three inside\nof the category right whatever is going\non there people are more likely to click\nthat so I ended up streaming at 1:00\na.m. when it had the least amount of\ncompetition this allowed me to sit in\nthe kingmaker slot even though at the\ntime I had about a 100 average viewers\nthat increased the amount of followers I\ngot per hour from about 1 to about 7 to\neight per hour so it worked it was very\neffective new people started piling in\nand then allowed the community to expand\nupwards and now when I sign on all of\nyou guys are there and it's the whole\nCommunity it's everybody is there and\nit's what time you go to bed I usually\ngo to bed so I'll I I have the same\nschedule every day I'll work eight hours\non stream I work eight hours off stream\ndo about 16 hours of work a day I have\nthree hours of free time and I sleep for\nabout 5 hours and Chad is always like\nthat's not enough sleep that's not\nenough sleep I went to the doctor for\nthis did sleep studies everything is\nfine with me so it's it's completely\nlike a healthy lifestyle for me and we\nknow that it works and it's not leading\nto like some kind of degradation or\nanything like that but it's the same\nschedule every day sometimes I have my 3\nhours free time before the sleep\nsometimes I do after the sleep it's kind\nof fluid whatever way that I feel that\nday but it's always 16 hours 8 hours on\nstream 8 hours off stream and if it's if\nthe stream goes longer it'll cut into\nthat second eight hours but I always get\nwhatever work done outside of that it's\nusually like management work stuff or\nworking on the game or whatever it's\ngoing so that also is very consistent\nwith um monk mode so I have a very\nstructured lifestyle incredibly\nstructured so as as you're careful about\nwhat you eat do you drink caffeine no no\ncaffeine of any kind I don't have coffee\nI don't have energy drinks I drink water\norange juice ovaline and cranberry juice\nit's pretty much it yeah so if you skip\ncaffeine and you're careful about what\nyou eat if you eat non- thic Foods you\ndon't need more than four to 6 hours of\nsleep at night and you're also waking up\nat uh you're prepping for Brahma mura a\nlittle bit earlier but there's even some\ninteresting stuff around circadian\nrhythm in physiology because it sounds\nlike you wake up at close to midnight I\nI'll wake up at about 12:30 about 30\nminutes and then you probably sleep\naround 800 PM right usually about 7:30\nto 8 yeah so that is very consistent\nwith the times of waking and sleeping\nit's several of the monasteries I've\nbeen\nto yes so there is there is a period of\ntime between about 3 and 5 a.m. really\n4:30 a.m. which is very conducive to\nmeditation the pre-dawn hours okay and\nthen sleep should be soon after dusk so\nDawn and dusk are the best hours to\nmeditate and then like even if you look\nat like matens in the Catholic tradition\nI think it's around midnight so monks\nwill wake up frequently around around\nmidnight you're a little bit earlier but\nI'm not surprised at all that you need\nless sleep given your diet lack of\npsychoactive substances and then well I\ndidn't ask you about others but we won't\nno I don't drugs of any kind either yeah\nlike the way that I feel about it is\nthis I can get through my work schedule\nevery day and I've talked to stream\nabout this a lot I get through my work\nschedule of of 16 hours of work three\nhours of you know whatever I want and\nthen 5 hours of sleep without extra\nvariables if I add an extra variable to\nthat like drugs like caffeine like\nenergy drink any of that stuff I may not\nbe able to do that so I just don't\nthere's no reason to if I wanted to test\nthose types of things sure but I don't\nreally have any reason to so I just\ndon't right and if it does throw off\nthat kind of a rhythm then it could be\ndetrimental and I just don't want to\ndon't want to deal with it frankly so I\njust don't yeah yeah I think that makes\nsense I think a lot of what what we miss\nout a lot on especially when comes to\nthings like caffeine is there you know\nlots of studies that show that caffeine\nis healthy for example but healthy\ndepends on what your Baseline is so\nthere are also studies that show that\ninjectable insulin is healthy but\ninjectable insulin is healthy if your\nblood sugar is out of whack yeah so the\nhealth benefits of caffeine or any other\nsubstance if we look at something like\nmarijuana there are studies that show\nthat marijuana is effective for treating\nanxiety so marijuana can be used as a\nmedicine that makes it healthy right\nwell yeah but if you're sick if you're\nsick and if you do it in moderation yeah\nyeah yeah so I mean this is true of all\nof our medicines our medicines are only\nhealthy if you're sick like cholesterol\nmedication insulin whatever and and so I\nthink what a lot of people miss out on\nis if you do a population based study on\ncaffeine and you say Okay caffeine is\nhealthy because we did it we measured\nthe population of the United States or\nEurope or whatever the question is what\nis the Baseline of that\npopulation I think that's what it is for\nme is I found my Baseline and I know\nwhat that is no that's I worked around\nthat instead of around a baseline that\nincludes stimulants of any kind yeah\nright I think that makes\nsense cool do you have a suggestion on\nwho we should raid oh man let me see\nwho's on a look let's raid somebody this\nis a really good talk by the way I\nenjoyed it a lot\ntoo let's\nsee actually let me see if
