    "transcript": "the problem isn't that you're not\nmotivated enough the problem is that you\nare too motivated in the wrong direction\nso let's take the case of you sitting at\nhome and doing nothing as you try to go\nand do something there are very powerful\nforces for you to overcome for you to do\nsomething right you really have to try\nhard to extract yourself from the\ncomputer you have to really try extra\nhard to go to this extra study session\nor go to office hours so if we really\nlook at it doing things in life requires\nextra effort and now you may think\nthat's because I'm not motivated but if\nyou really pause and think about it\nyou're highly motivated to continue\ndoing what you're doing there's a part\nof your brain that is telling you hey we\ndon't want to do that we actually really\nwant to stay here and watch one more\nepisode of whatever we happen to be\nbinging at the time or as you struggle\nto find the motivation to stop using\nsocial media there's a part of your\nbrain that's like no no no no no no my\nfriend we are not going to stop we are\nactually highly motivated to continue\ndoing what we're doing"
