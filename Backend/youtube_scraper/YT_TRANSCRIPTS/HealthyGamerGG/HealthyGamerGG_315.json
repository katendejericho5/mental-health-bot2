    "transcript": "hey Dr K after my first relationship\nI've had a lot of success with let's say\nsuperficial dating which grew old fairly\nfast and now after having been in a lot\nof those I haven't been able to find\nanyone to have something deeper anymore\nwhat should I do so if you've had a\nmeaningful relationship followed by a\nstring of empty or shallow relationships\ntwo options one is that you haven't\nfound the right person right which is\nvery possible the second though is that\nyou're not really emotionally open to\nsomething deeper the main question is\nhow did your first relationship end have\nyou really fully like recovered from\nthat do you have space in you for\nanother relationship like that and often\ntimes what happens when our first\nrelationship ends is we get kind of\nscarred over right this is what happens\nanytime we have a wound the body and the\nmind will scar over it and so if you're\nhaving trouble forming a connection I'd\nreally like look at what was the\naftermath of your first relationship and\nare you really ready to meet someone or\ndo you want to be in that kind of\nrelationship again because you may not\nbe ready yet may not want it so I'd kind\nof process the old relationship and make\nsure that you're emotionally available\nfor a new one"
