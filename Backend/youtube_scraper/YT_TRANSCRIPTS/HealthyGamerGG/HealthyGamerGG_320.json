    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\ndevelop Charisma even if you're\n[Music]\nunattractive most people are of average\nattractiveness or even below average\nattractiveness and what do you do if\nyou're one of those people and this is\none of the things that bothers me the\nmost because when I talk to people who\nare of average attractiveness or even\nsomewhat unattractive it is such a\nstruggle to engage with other human\nbeings you have to work so much harder\nthan someone who's attractive and what\nthis sort of ends up in is you engaging\nin all kinds of techniques to get other\npeople to like you and in fact there's\neven a whole industry that is designed\nto teach you these techniques so that\nyou can try to level the playing field\nwith people who are naturally attractive\nthe experience that I'm talking about\nhere is someone who like you're always\ntexting your friends but they never\nreally text you back that when they need\nsomething you're going to drop\neverything and you're going to do\nwhatever they need but they never\nreciprocate so what ends up happening is\nthat you're kind of chasing these\nfriendships and you're putting in more\ntime and more effort and sometimes you\neven have to resort to special kinds of\nmanipulative techniques like okay I'm\ngoing to do this or I'm going to do\nnegging or I'm going to do this other\nkind of crap to get this person to\nengage with me and you deserve better\nthan that I want you to have better than\nthat I want you to be in a situation\nwhere by virtue of who you are your\ncharisma is so developed that you\nnaturally attract people to you because\nyou absolutely deserve that and I'm\ngoing to help you get there so the first\nthing that we've got to understand is\nwhat is charisma now a lot of people\nthink that Charisma is simply physical\nattractiveness but as the modern\nresearch shows physical attractiveness\nis just one of the six dimensions of\nCharisma and on top of that it's not\neven one of the most important ones\nthere are actually three attributes of\ncharisma that are worth more when it\ncomes to Charisma Than Physical\nattractiveness now y y'all may not\nbelieve that right because we all kind\nof know for example that like clearly\nCharisma means physically being hot\nright well let's actually take a look at\nthe research because I think it's really\nfascinating so to begin with we're going\nto take a quick look at this paper\ncalled generic Charisma\nconceptualization and measurement so\nthese two people bless them I can't\npronounce these names because they're\nfrom Croatia and Slovenia they sort of\nsat down and tried to figure out okay\nlike what is charisma actually composed\nof and here's what they found which is\nreally staggering so the first is that\nattractive is a part of Charisma but it\naccounts for 10.5% of the variance\nbetween people who are charismatic and\nnot charismatic the really interesting\nthing is if we actually look at the\ncomponents of Charisma what we discover\nis the most important aspect of Charisma\nis communication skills someone who\nattracts admiration and inspires right\nso that's not the same as physically\nattractive and someone who's honest and\nreliable and if we look at the\ncumulative variance what that sort of\nmeans is what percentage of Charisma is\nembodied by these three things what we\ntend to see is first of all these three\nare all worth more than physical\nattractiveness and about half of the\nCharisma that you exude or that most\npeople exude is actually like made up of\nthese three things and it has nothing to\ndo with physical attractiveness in fact\nphysical attractiveness is only\nresponsible for 10.5% of the\nwhen it comes to Charisma now that's\njust one paper and I'm not saying that\nthis one paper you know explains\neverything there are other papers that\nwe kind of dig into but the first thing\nto understand is that people have\nresearched Charisma and physical\nattractiveness accounts for only about\n10.5% of it and so then the question is\nwhat is the rest of Charisma and how do\nI develop it so we're going to focus on\nthree attributes because these are the\nthings that you can actually learn how\nto do and as you improve these what you\nwill naturally find is that people are\nmore interested in spending time with\nyou even if you're physically\nunattractive so the three things that\nwe're going to talk about are vision and\nvision implementation authenticity and\ncommunication okay so let's start with\nvision and vision implementation so the\nfirst thing to understand is that in our\ncurrent Society we don't have a whole\nlot of vision so what does vision mean\nso companies will have things like\ntargets right we want to sell\n$100,000 worth of flowers this year and\nthat's like a really solid like that's a\nbusiness metric baby like this is a goal\nthat I want to accomplish and if you\nlook at your life chances are you will\nhave all kinds of goals for yourself and\nyou think that accomplishing these goals\nwill make people like you right like I\nneed to get one foot taller my dick\nneeds to get a couple inches bigger\nmaybe my tits need to get a couple\ninches bigger you know maybe I need to\nmake more money and if I hit these\ntargets then people will like me but it\nturns out that vision is not hitting\nTargets in fact it's the opposite so\nvision is the quality of we don't sell\nflowers we sell Beauty it's this weird\nabstract kind of thinking it's Vision\nright it's not a concrete thing it's\nsome kind of idea that you have about\nyour life and the direction that your\nlife is going in now why is it hard for\nus to develop this floofy floofy idea\nlike what is your vision of your life if\nI ask you that question you're like I\ndon't know right you can give me a goal\nbut you don't have some weird aesthetic\nidea of what you want your life to\nAspire to be you're not some like Greek\nphilosopher who's like oh yes like I\nwill pursue Beauty because I'm epicurian\nlike uh we don't know how to do that\ncrap right and the question is why it's\nbecause that instinct of vision is\nactually conditioned out of us through\nthings like school so if you look at\nsomething like school what is school\nactually for do we take a group of a\nhundred kids and try to enhance their\nunderstanding and help them develop\ntheir sense of vision between the\nformative years of like literally five\nand and 22 when most people are in\nschool for 17 years of the basic most\nformative part of their life we actually\ntry to get rid of vision schools are not\nplaces to help you cultivate a vision of\nlife there's they're factories they're\nfactories designed to create a\nparticular kind of person so we have\nstandardized classes with standardized\ncompetencies that we measure and\nstandardized ways and when you get let's\nsay a degree in finance everyone who's\nemploying you expects you to have a\nminimum level of competence so the\nreason that it's hard for us to develop\nvision is because we have a society that\ndoesn't care about vision and actually\nactively conditions us to no longer have\na vision and youall may have noticed\nthis because at some point in life you\nprobably had these tiny little inklings\nof vision and you're like I want to do\nthis thing and everyone else is like no\nyou cannot do that thing you need to\nbecome doctor how dare you try to do\nsomething to change the world and make\nit a better place and you want to live a\nlife of Art and Beauty Al who will marry\nyou if you are living an art of a life\nof Art and Beauty you need to become\ndoctor then you will find a good wife\nthe second reason why it's really hard\nto have Vision right now is because the\nworld is falling apart so vision is\nabout the future right it's like hey I\nwant to accomplish this thing or not\neven accomplish it's like I want to live\nin service to this thing over the next\n20 years of my life 30 years of life we\ndon't even know what state the world is\ngoing to be in like 2 years from now\nwe've had about three or four Once in A-\nlifetime crises in like 5 years I've\nheard that the crab population is\ncratering it's 25% of what it was like\nfour years ago something insane like\nthat if you're the under the age of 30\nit's impossible to buy a house it's like\nimpossible to date whether you're a man\nor a woman whether you're a dude it's\nlike 90% of people ignore you and if\nyou're a woman it's like if you message\nsomeone you're going to get a dickpick\nso the fundamentals of life in the the\nfuture can't be counted on and so\npsychologically what do we do when we\ncan't count on a future there's no point\nin having a vision because Vision means\ndisappointment now here's the problem\nwith that even though it's really hard I\nstill want yall to try to cultivate it\nit's been beaten out of you and it's not\na good idea but literally if you look at\nthe science of Charisma and you want to\nbecome a more charismatic in individual\ndeveloping a vision is a key part of it\nokay and let's understand why because in\nthis world where everything is falling\napart if you occasionally meet a human\nbeing who has Vision about their life in\nthe future holy that's so inspiring\nright so let's focus on Vision so let's\nunderstand a couple of fundamentals the\nfirst is that vision is not a goal so\nwhen you're trying to develop your\nvision of Life anything in your mind\nthat is a goal which is by the way how\nyou've been conditioned to think right\npromotion this percentage of you know\nincrease in salary this kind of\ncertification this kind of award reward\nthis kind of achievement this kind of\nwhatever like it's always goals goals\ngoals goals goals I want to lose 5\npounds that's different from I want to\nlive a life of Health right my body is a\ntemple what does that mean those are\nthose Vision kinds of statements that\nthen you move towards in a particular\nway and when you have a solid vision of\nyour life then people will sort of\nnotice that in all of the actions that\nyou do because in pursuing that Vision\nyou will start to align different parts\nof your life and people will be like wow\nthat person is so organized so how do we\ndevelop this Vision first thing that we\ndo is we get rid of goals has nothing to\ndo with goals second thing is that we\nwant to really think about what are the\nideals that you want to live your life\ntowards and be as floofy and\nuncalculated as possible all those\nthoughts that you've let go by the\nwayside because they're not useful and\nyou can't achieve them in this world is\nsomething that you need to start to\ndevelop now Vision also gets coupled\nwith vision implementation and if we\nlook at the research on Charisma these\ntwo things are really important it's not\nenough to have an ideal in life you also\nneed to be able to implement it and the\nimplementation of your vision involves\nthree steps the first is clarification\nand this is kind of also step one\nbecause you know we kind of say I say\nlike develop a vision you're like at\nthis point in the video you haven't done\nthat yet right so what you really want\nto do is really start to think about\nwhat do I want my life to look like when\nI look back on it what do I want my life\nto be perceived as by other people what\nwould make me happy on my deathbed if my\nlife was this way and I can guarantee\nyou that if you kind of like well I\nguess not guarantee you but it's not\ngoing to be a particular Target right\nlike when you're 80 years old and you're\nthinking back to your life and you're\nlike man the one thing that makes me\nreally happy is that when I was 28 years\nold and I applied for that promotion I\ngot that particular promotion at that\nparticular company and thank God I\nachieved that goal because that has made\nmy life worthwh no it doesn't work like\nthat right when you look back on your\nlife what are the ideals that you were\nshoo shooting for what was the direction\nthat you wanted your life to go these\nare Concepts like you know I want to\ncreate a story that inspires people or I\nsee that there's a lot of suffering in\nthis world and I want to capture that\nsuffering and share it with other people\nin the in the form of like a story or\nsomething like that these are kind of\nmore floofy sort of ideas right I want\nmy body to be a temple I want to live a\nlife that I can be proud of I know it\nsounds kind of bizarre but that's all\nVision stuff and the next thing is to\njust simply clarify that idea and as ask\nyourself a little bit about why do I\nwant this what's important to me and the\nmore you do that kind of introspective\nwork the more that you will develop\nVision the second thing about Vision\nimplementation is structure so now that\nwe have some kind of Ideal and it\ndoesn't have to be fully fleshed out it\ncan be a work over time right is there's\na big part that people who are goal\nfocused and not Vision focused kind of\nfocus on which is the what so I want to\naccomplish this thing it's all about the\nTarget right what's the target we're\nshooting for we want to increase sales\nwe want to lose 10 lb it's all these\ntargets and we love targets because\nthey're easy to measure and the other\nthing is that everybody else loves\ntargets because it's a quick way to\nreduce us to a number it's a way to rank\na mass of human beings so we want to\nabandon that way of thinking when it\ncomes to Vision so Vision implementation\nis about structure and what we mean by\nthat is where when and how so for\nwhatever ideal you have don't focus on\nwhat the goal is focus on when you're\ngoing to do it where you're going to do\nit and how you're going to do it so it's\nnot even about the goal it's really\nabout the process and the more that you\nfocus on the process of it the where the\nwhen the how and if you say to yourself\nokay I want to live a life of beauty\nwhat the hell does that mean so then ask\nyourself where am I going to live a life\nof beauty when am I going to live a life\nof beauty how am I going to live a life\nof beauty what does that mean that means\nthat okay I'm going to make some kind of\nartwork and present it on March 27th\n2024 at this particular community of art\nlocal artists or whatever right so as\nyou tunnel down into the when where and\nhow it's not about the what or whether\nyou achieve your goal or not achieve\nyour goal it's when are you going to do\nit where are you going to do it and how\nare you going to do it whatever appeals\nto you there's no right or wrong okay\nthe next part of vision implementation\nis strategic thinking so this may sound\nlike kind of common sense right like oh\nI should like think strategically about\nmy life but that's not actually what\nhappens so let me give you all an\nexample so let's say that I have some\nkind of setback in life let's say I get\ndumped and what is our experience of\nbeing dumped we usually don't think\nabout our life in a strategic way right\nthe setback hurts us so much we start to\ndevelop all these views about the\nopposite sex or maybe the same sex we\nstart to lose our faith and love and\nhumanity and all this kind of stuff we\nlet these events around us shape our\nfuture so what strategic thinking means\nis when it comes to your life and you\nhave a vision that you want to move\ntowards and you figured out a where a\nwhen and a how inevitably things ain't\ngoing to go your way because you're just\nlearning how to do this stuff and how do\nwe respond when things don't go our way\nthis is where human beings are very good\nat strategic thinking when it comes to\nwork but they are very bad at strategic\nthinking when it comes to their own\nlives because at work there's no\nemotions involved there's no ego\ninvolved there's no like usually parents\ninvolved right but when it comes to our\nown lives we can't think about our life\nstrategically because when things don't\ngo away our way we feel bad and then we\nwant to drink or we want to get high or\nwe want to play video games or whatever\nwe don't think about things\nstrategically so what does it mean to\nthink strategically so that's where when\nyou have a vision or a particular\ndirection that you want to go and you've\nsort of figured out the where when how\nanytime you have a setback you think\nabout okay how can I move past this\nright how can I circumvent whatever has\njust happened and continue moving\ntowards my vision it's about sort of a\nstrategic approach to always moving\nforward it's not about a goal it's not\nabout achieving a a particular thing\nalthough you can let a goal roll in it's\nno big no big deal but to really think\nabout for any setback you have in life\nwhat can I do about this how can I move\npast that and what we sort of know from\nthe science of Charisma is it's when\nhuman beings start to do this that other\npeople around them are like wow look at\nthat person they're attracted to this\nright because what does this look like\nfrom the outside wow that person did not\nlet a setback hold them back this person\npersevered through success men they are\nmoving relentlessly towards a particular\ngoal it's not a goal it's actually a\nvision right they're and the when where\nhow means that they're actually doing\nstuff so this is a huge part of Charisma\nthe next thing that we're going to talk\na little bit about is communication\nstyle and authenticity and we're going\nto kind of roll these together even\nthough they're separate factors so the\nmain thing that we can do to boost our\nCharisma is to be more authentic now\nwhat does that mean so if we sort of\nthink about let's say things that are\nnaturally attractive so let's say like\nthere's 's a campfire okay and if you\nsort of think about a campfire it's very\ninviting right it's like warm it's\ncheery it's crackly it looks cool it's\nlike fire bro and it's also like it\nfeels good to like sit next to it right\nso we're sort of naturally attracted to\ncampfires so how do we have other people\nbe naturally drawn towards us we have to\nbe authentic and why is that it's\nbecause when people can't trust us they\nwill not be attracted to us so we\ncurrently have a society that is built\non distrust so dating profiles are very\ncalculated methods of distrust right\nyou're trying to advertise some of this\nstuff oh yeah the person never mentioned\nthat they've got kids or they never\nmentioned that they're actually in jail\nor like you know there's all kinds of\nstuff there's so much deception going on\nin the world today with employees\nemployers with each other with\nrelationships and youall know what I'm\ntalking about because if you've tried to\nexist in this world you've realized that\nbeing authentic is like kind of stupid\nand you get punished for it and at the\nsame time the more that you can develop\nthat authenticity the more people will\nbe drawn towards you right because they\nknow what they're going to get and the\nprimary concern that so many people have\nin the world right now is that you can't\ntrust people so if you are one of the\npeople that people can actually trust\nthat's going to be a huge chunk of\nCharisma and we've already looked at\nsome of the data and there's a lot of\ndata that shows that you know\nauthenticity is very very important now\nthere are a couple of caveats to\nauthenticity because we don't want to be\nauthentically like negative and spewing\nall that crap right so what we really\nwant to be authentic about is our sense\nof vision our sense of direction who we\naspire to be you can share some\nnegativity there's no problem in that\nbut what we really want you to do is try\nto be your authentic best self and if\nthere's a chunk of negativity in there\nthat's actually okay because that shows\nyou as being more authentic the problem\nright now is that a lot of people\nconfuse authenticity of self as verbal\ndiarrhea for for all of my trauma and\nthose are not the same two things I mean\nsure that's one version of authenticity\nbut that's the kind of authenticity that\nyou should have with a therapist right\nnot people that you met 5 minutes ago on\nthe internet and then the third thing\nthat we're going to focus on is a\nparticular kind of communication style\nwhich is the most important part of\nCharisma now this communication style\nit's not just that you can do these\nthree or four tips and then you're going\nto be charismatic there's absolutely\npieces of that but this communication\nstyle is built on the other two so the\nnext thing about authenticity is if\nyou're trying to figure out what is too\nauthentic what is not authentic I would\nencourage you to temper your\nauthenticity with compassion so in Asia\nlike East Asia like India China some of\nthese areas that have like Buddhist and\nHindu Roots they have this really\ninteresting approach to truthfulness so\nthey say that there's this thing called\nSATA which is something you should\naspire to you should try to be truthful\nall the time but they say that Satya is\nsubject to aimsa which means nonviolence\nand so when they're trying to figure out\nhow honest should I be or should I share\nthis or not share this it's not that I'm\nradically honest and so I'm going to be\nan to you because this is my\nauthenticity no what they mean is that\nyour truthfulness should be subject to\ncompassion so compassion should be your\nnumber one goal and truthfulness should\nbe in service to that so if you're\ntrying to figure out should I share this\nshould I not share this is this part of\nmy authentic being think about letting\ncompassion temper that what will this\nauthenticity due to the people around me\nand this is where you say well doesn't\nthat mean you're not being authentic\nbecause you're starting to hide things\nno you don't want to fake positive stuff\nso you want to let stuff out that is\nabsolutely authentic but you want to\ntemper with compassion as much as\npossible now we're going to get to the\nthird part which is communication style\nand communication style is absolutely\nlike certain techniques that you can do\nbut these are subject to number one and\nnumber two so as you develop a vision as\nyou clarify a Vision as you start\nimplementing a vision as you start\npracticing authenticity and compassion\nthis is where we get to communication\nand so what we want to communicate is\nnumber one and number two right so you\nwant to share authentic things you want\nto share what your vision is with people\nyou don't want to brag about it I did\nthis I did this my body's a temple I'm\ndoing this I'm so cool look at me I'm so\nAlpha but what we really want you to do\nis clarify your communication and the\nway that we do this so when people when\nyou ask people you know what is the key\naspect of like communication for someone\nwho's charismatic and it's that they're\nvery clear with their communication and\nthere's a very easy technique to develop\nthat which is actually to practice\nwriting so with whatever you end up\ntalking about or communicating with\nother people write about it first now a\nlot of people are super surprised by\nthat but I'll give you all a simple\nexample so people will look at me and\narguably I'm somewhat charismatic right\nand let's let's let's use the Dr K test\nso if you think I'm charismatic great if\nyou don't think I'm charismatic well I\ndon't know so maybe I'll still fail the\ntest and I'll fail these Dimensions so\nwhen youall kind of like look at me\nright what do yall see do you think that\nI'm authentic do you think I'm\ntransparent do I communicate things in a\nclear way do I have a vision of what I'm\ntrying to accomplish so as we check\nthose boxes because it's not that I'm\nlike particularly sexy right like I know\nthat some people think that and oh my\nGod Dr K is such a thirst trap I don't\nthink so bro like I'm a 41-year-old dad\nof two who exercises intermittently I'm\nnot that attractive right got a decent\nhead of hair I'll give you that but at\nthe end of the day these are the\nqualities that I try to Aspire to right\nit's having a Clear Vision of what we're\ndoing it's trying to be as authentic as\npossible with y'all and at the end of\nthe day it's communicating things in a\nclear way so let's focus on that number\nthree so when I started streaming on\nTwitch everyone was like oh my God this\nguy is so good at talking about stuff oh\nmy God he's so brilliant oh my God right\nand believe me I love it but I'm going\nto give you all the little hack that I\nuse to pretend to be smart which is that\nI write about everything before I open\nmy mouth so before I did my\nfirst stream on Twitch around the time I\ndid my first stream I was writing a book\non video game addiction I was writing a\nbook or I wrote a book about the\nneuroscience and psychology of\nTechnology it is this 160 page Mammoth\ntone that is absolute garbage right so\neveryone's like oh my God Dr K can I\nread it no it sucks trust me you don't\nwant to read it but what that process of\nwriting when I wrote 160 pages and like\n88,000 words it clarified all of my\nideas so that when I opened my mouth it\nmade me sound like I was a smart person\nI'm not actually that smart I just\nfigured this piece out about clear\ncommunication and that's why I'm sharing\nit with you so when it comes to clearly\ncommunicating the most important thing\nthat you can do is write out your\nthoughts you don't have to stick with\nthem you don't have to repeat them or\nmemorize them or anything like that but\nif you look at the Neuroscience of\nwriting and speaking when we go through\nthe process of verbalization and sort of\nwriting this stuff out this is when we\nactually clarify our thinking and now\nthe cool thing is when you open your\ndumb mouth all of the thinking has\nalready been done so that when you start\nspeaking it comes out super clear\nbecause most people when they\ncommunicate they're thinking at the same\ntime right so just think about this for\na second when you're having a\nconversation and you formulate some kind\nof response to a question that's the\nfirst time you're thinking about it so\nif it's the first time you're thinking\nabout it how clear do you think it's\ngoing to be and this is why most\nconversations are not filled with\nbrilliant Revelations but if you want to\nhave conversations that are filled with\nbrilliant Revelations start writing\nabout it the simple Act of writing will\nclarify the thoughts and then when you\nspeak you will sound much much clearer\nmuch more competent so I know it sounds\nkind of crazy but it turns out that\nphysical attractiveness is a small\npercentage of Charisma accounts for\n10.5% of the variance of Charisma and\nthere are other things that are\nabsolutely in your control that you can\nuse to level up your charisma plus three\nto Charisma baby look at that racial\nbonus from D and D hell yeah dude make\nyou a strong Paladin make you a strong B\nit's going to be lit plus three to\nCharisma baby how do we do this Vision\nVision implementation authenticity and\ncommunication if you can do these four\nthings all of the literature about the\nscience of Charisma from business to\npsychology suggest that you will improve\nyour charisma by about 44% right that's\nthe variance of these three categories\nroughly actually that's not correct but\nit'll go up quite a bit I'm confident to\nthat and the coolest thing is that this\nis something that is not based on the\njawline that you were born with or the\nway that your face looks and especially\nin a world where everyone is trying to\nsurvive a single human being who can\nspeak clearly has a vision that they're\nimplementing and is someone that you can\ntrust well wouldn't you be attracted to\nthem so give it a shot and level up your\ncharisma and you will be thanking me for\nthem that's dumb see I didn't think\nthrough this yet so now I don't know how\nto close it because now I sound like an\nidiot do you all see how different it is\nwhen I haven't thought I didn't think\nthrough how I was going to end this\nvideo and now I sound like a dumbass so\nmaybe that's the best proof I can give\nyou so now go and do it hey y'all if\nyou're interested in applying some of\nthe principles that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out
