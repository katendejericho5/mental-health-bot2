    "transcript": "[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Applause]\none second chat I have to oh no I don't\nknow if I hold on chat hold\non\n[Applause]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n10\n[Music]\nAl righty chat let's get started welcome\nto another healthy gamer G stream my\nname is allo kenoa just a reminder that\neverything we discuss on stream is\nintended to be taken uh as education or\nentertainment and nothing is intended to\nbe taken as Medical advice if yall have\na concern or question please go see a\nlicensed\nprofessional um so today we are talking\nwith Dr um Naidu who is a psychiatrist\nwho specializes in the effect of food\nand mood um so we're going to be hopping\nin with her and we'll do like kind of a\nfull introduction but hopefully this is\nvery very helpful for yall\necho\necho oh how's that\nfixed saved\nsaved saved chat saved okay\num all right so yeah so we'll be talking\nwith Dr Naidu um and we're going to be\ntalking about like food and mood so\nwe're going to have a conversation about\nanxiety and like the effect of food and\nthings like that so we've got like a\nreal expert okay this isn't like a Dr K\nflavored expert this is like a real\nexpert and then on Monday we're going to\nbe talking with Dan Clancy okay CEO of\ntwitch so let's hop in but let me see if\nI can figure this out so hello Dr\nNaidu okay this is the wrong thing one\nsecond I'm gonna fix something real\nquick because this says sneo and you are\ncertainly not\nsneo um okay that's fixed hold\non for some reason it didn't say some of\nmy settings and then the next thing that\nwe're going to do is this we are going\nto\ndo this there we go all right oh you're\nokay perfect okay so um let's just make\nsure C count to 10 for me again one two\nbeautiful three so uh welcome Dr naid do\nto our little corner of the internet um\nso can you tell us a little bit about\nwhat you first of all should we call you\nDr naidy what do you what do you go by\num on social media goes Dr Uma but you\ncan call me Uma whatever works Dr great\nand um can you tell us just a little bit\nabout what your area of expertise is and\nand where you exist in your day\njob um so I'll start with my area of\nNiche expertise which is the combination\nof nutrition for mental well-being it's\na field that is new and emerg called\nnutritional and metabolic Psychiatry and\nI come to that with the diversity of\ntraining I'm a har trained psychiatrist\nI'm also a trained professional chef and\nauthor of a couple of books um and a\ntrained nutrition neural biologist and\nwhat that does alcas it brings my um\nexpertise together to help people choose\nthe best foods for the mental well-being\nand it I think it's something that is\noverlooked um often prescriptions are\nthe first thing given to people instead\nof a discussion of lifestyle and\nnutrition is a pillar of lifestyle\nchanges that we can make yeah so can you\ntell us a little bit about like you know\nhow does food intersect with mood or\nmental health so I'd like to give what\nseems like a really simple example but\nit'll help to break down the very\nimportant gut brain connection gut brain\necosystem and help us understand how the\nfood we eat impacts mental well-being if\nyou have a headache the pain is usually\nperceived in your head somewhere um and\nyou generally will go take a headache\npole um swallow some water and hope that\nthe headache goes away but think about\nit for a second we swallowing something\nit's going to our digestive tract but\nit's working elsewhere in the body and\nthe pain might be usually somewhere in\nyour head in a very similar way the\nevolution of understanding the gut brain\nconnection has helped us understand that\nthe food that we eat the nutrients that\nwe that eat or don't eat in the case of\nmaybe eating less healthy choices are\nbroken down in the digestive tract but\nthey also interact with trillions of\nmicrobes down down there that are there\nto actually support digestion but also\nwork on sleep and circadian rhythm which\nis our internal body clock vitamin\nproduction hormones uh immunity mental\nhealth and more so that helps us\nunderstand that the breakdown of the\nnutrients the interaction with\nneurotransmitters then starts to impact\nthings like anxiety mood and other\nconditions over time that's a that's a\nsimple version of of it okay so like I\nwe love simple versions but we actually\nalso love complex versions so one of the\nthings that I was really surprised by is\nhow scientifically Savvy um the internet\nis and even our community is so like the\nlast expert we had on we were looking at\nlike binding pharmacokinetics of ssris\nand like everyone could follow what was\nbeing said so we' love like more detail\nso like how does this work so can you\ntell us a little bit about let's say\ncircadian rhythm and like what I eat how\ndoes like eating something what is the\nscience behind eating something and how\nit affects my circadian\nrhythm so I have to tell you cm is not\nmy not my Lane of expertise but what I\ncan speak to is the science of the gut\nmicrobiome um when I said padian RM what\nI was saying is that our gut microbes\nactually involved in so much more than\njust digestion um I think that\nunderstanding that the gut and brain ex\narise from the exact same cells in the\nhuman embryo um is super important\nbecause even though they form through\ndifferent organs in the body they\nactually are connected then they remain\nconnected by the vagus nerve which\nallows for messaging between the organ\nsystems of major things like\nneurotransmitters the biggest ones that\nwe would want to be talking about are\ndopamine serotonin Gaba Gaba is\nsignificantly involved in anxiety so if\nwe take it a step further they are\ncommunicating about neurotransmitters 90\nto 95% of Serotonin and serotonin\nreceptors are in the gut now there's\nalso a smaller percent much smaller\npercent in the brain the serotonin in\nthe gut doesn't actually reach the brain\nthat easily it doesn't cross the blood\nbrain barrier and this is where food\nbecomes super important so things like\ntryptophan in chickpeas or turkey are\nhugely important as being precursors to\ncrossing the blood brain barrier and by\nthe way we need to eat these because we\nneed to eat sources of tryptophan on\ndiet because uh they are the precursors\nand because we don't get these naturally\nin um in our our body does not make them\nso they cross over and then join with\ndifferent types of precursors in the\nbrain to form those important uh\nneurotransmitters that we need\nthe other level that we are\nunderstanding and learning about is that\ncertain strain of say Bido bacterium are\ninvolved with serotonin dopamine others\nare involved with Gaba and they're\ninteracting in a way to produce more of\nthese substances uh they also interact\nwith things like cortisol now we know\nthat cortisol Gaba all of these things\nare linked to our stress response linked\nto\nanxiety can ium in for picture yeah yeah\nso so I just want to take each of these\nthings in turn so like let you mentioned\ntryptophan right so let's just\nunderstand that so tryptophan is a\nserotonin precursor yes right um and so\nserotonin does not cross the bloodb\nbrain barrier right that's correct so\nthe serotonin made in the gut doesn't\ncross over that's why we need these\nthese Foods in our diet to help us and\nso once we eat something like chickpeas\nor turkey that has a higher level of\ntryptophan the tryptophan does CL cross\nthe blood brain barrier and gets turned\ninto serotonin\nthat's right and do we have evidence\nthat shows that eating chickpeas or\nturkey has a clinical impact on\nsomething like\nanxiety we do we have uh we have\nresearch behind the fact that eating\nthese nutrients in fact one of the\ntricks with tryptophan is tryptophan\nalso needs some form of complex\ncarbohydrate hydrate to be paired with\nit um so I sort of like to joke around\neven though it's not the best example\nthat you know the turkey it's actually\nthe mashed potatoes that count uh\nbecause that's helping the the the\ntransport but I think we want to find\nyou know we love mashed potatoes at\nThanksgiving but we want to find uh more\ncomplex carbs that we can work with but\nthose little nuances are are important\nand I think the overarching message is\nthat food is powerful we are not at a\npoint of being prescriptive with food\nbut I think the food is medicine\nmovement and nutritional Psychiatry is\nhelping to move this along but there's\nalso robust evidence behind we got\nmicrobiome signs um the signs of foods\nbehind anxiety but I would never want to\nsay oh eat chickpeas and your anxiety\nwill be cured it's part of a holistic\napproach so things like learning breath\nwork a breath work exercise hydration\nhugely important dehydration can\nprecipitate Panic it can um people can\npresent I'm going to I'm going to jump\nin again so so if it's okay like we're\ngoing to take one thing at a time and\nI'd love to talk about all of these\nthings so I want to ask you about\ndehydration I mean or hydration I want\nto ask you about microbiome and just a\nreminder you know like Dr Uma said we\ndid a disclaimer at the beginning of\nstream but that everything we're\ndiscussing today is for educational\npurposes only and nothing should be\ntaken as medical advice and if youall\nhave a specific question like please uh\ntalk to your doctor or um whoever your\nuh Medical Professional is so you\nmentioned so trip so it sounds like\nwe've got data that shows that dietary\ncon consumption of tryptophan along with\ncar complex carbohydrate and apparently\nthat enhances the absorption of the\ntryptophan do you have a sense of like\ndo we know how that works like why is\nthat um I don't know the exact mechanism\nuh off the top of my head but what I\nunderstand is that tryptophan um needs\nto needs to make that conversion and the\nthe carbohydrates actually help it along\nokay so the best I can say for right now\nis you know I think I think if we\nremember those principles we want to try\nto think of how uh we remember that\ncomplex carbohydrates also come from\nthings like cauliflower so so it doesn't\nhave to be people think carbohydrates\nthey think bread pasta or potatoes there\nare many there are many more foods and\num what I do in my book calm your mind\nwith food is actually break down these\nfood groups because they are very\nconfusing to people macronutrients\nmicronutrients bioactives and all of\nthat um so that it helps us to fill out\nthe understanding around food so what\nare some of the other you mentioned this\nis It's a fascinating Nuance what are\nsome of the other things that people who\nare struggling with anxiety like what\nare some of the other things that they\nshould understand like you mentioned\nthat there are principles right which\nshould be part of a holistic plan what\nare some of these other bits that you've\nkind of discovered or or will share with\npatients or or you know people what else\ncan we find in your book exactly so so\nfood food and nutrition are the one very\nsolid pillar but what I want people to\nunderstand is those things like\nhydration are significantly important\njust sipping on water or decaffinated\nteas throughout the day um will actually\nhelp your hydration uh our bodies by\nchemical reactions we know need water\nbut low hydration actually is associated\nwith anxiety so just keeping up will\nhelp you another thing is just learn in\nyour spare time when you're not feeling\nanxious maybe you have a little bit of\nworry whatever it is learn a breath work\nexercise one of them is called um\nalternate nostril breathing these are\nsimple techniques you can learn from a\nvalid source on YouTube and have that in\nyour back pocket and the reason that I\nsay that is because when you have that\nanxiety coming on you can automatically\nuse breath work a research study\npublished in 2020 was actually looking\nat pranayama yoga which is breath workor\nyoga and it was looking at\ncardiovascular patients and they\nsecondarily found that the breath work\nhelped anxiety and depression so you\nknow we're not we're not just saying\nlearn a breath work exercises that\nactually can help you another piece is\njust getting some daylight like 10\nminutes of daylight every day helps with\nabout 80% of your vitamin D can I jump\nin again so I've noticed that you'll\ngive us like two or three different\nthings to do but we'd love into dive\ninto one mechanism at a time if that's\ncool with you okay so you mentioned you\nyeah so you mentioned hydration so what\nis like help us understand the link\nbetween hydration and\nanxiety so when when our our body our\ncells need hydration in order to\nfunction at a cellular level at the\nmitochondrial level these are just these\nare just sort of chemical mechanisms in\nwhich our biology happens when our cells\nare short on hydration there is some\nmechanism that seems to activate what\nfires in our Milla which generally tends\nto be the hot bed for anxiety so how I\nwant people to think about it is in\norder to keep your your stress levels\nlow and to keep yourselves calm you want\nto be hydrating because what that's\ndoing is it's kind of think about it\nthis way it's sort of filling up your\ntank of water in your body but the the\nwater is distributed throughout your\nbody on a deeper cellular level it's not\njust you know hydration of your skin\nalthough sometimes that's a great sign\nof dehydration\nso having that as a tool and realizing\nthat you may be drinking a lot of soda\nyou may be drinking a lot of energy\ndrinks you may be drinking a diet energy\ndrink uh these are very popular but\nthose things are not they firstly they\nadding either artificial sweetness or\nsugar which is not helping your body and\nthey also dehydrating your salts\nalthough I think that coffee is is a a\ncompletely okay uh beverage to have um\nit coffee itself can be dehydrating so\nif you like coffee make sure you also\ndrinking water during the day these are\njust helpful tips to get us by can you\ntell us a little bit about how our\nartificial sweeteners because you know\nthere's a lot of idea that okay if they\ndon't have calories they're fine yeah um\nbut there's some studies that show I\nremember seeing a study that showed that\nthere's a dose dependent relationship\nbetween artificial sweeteners and risk\nof dementia and so what how does our\nbody metabolize artificial sweeteners\nwhat impact would they have on our mood\nor anxiety right so let's look at mood\nand anxiety first uh they tend to the\nartificial and non-nutritive sweetness\nthey call non nutritive because they're\nnot really bringing nutrients to our\nbody they're just giving that perception\nof a very sweet taste um so they are\ndisruptive to the gut microbiome that's\none mechanism but they also do an\nunusual thing because when you have if\nyou've ever looked at you know teaspoon\nof sugar versus a packet of artificial\nsweetener there's a tiny bit of powder\nin the packet and a teaspoon of sugar or\nspoon of sugar is a spoon of sugar but\nyou put in this powder because it's\nactually hyper sweetened um and what\nhappens is that you however you're\ntaking it maybe taking it through a diet\nsoda or something like that the cells in\nyour body you know your body thinks oh\nyou know this something sweet it your\ntaste receptors perceive it is sweet and\nyour body thinks oh sugar is coming you\nknow I I'm I'm going to be fed I'm going\nto be fed but what actually happens is\nthat you you um consume the artificial\nsweetener but it's not followed by any\nactual food or calories and so it's a\nlittle bit of a trick that gets your\nbody working in the wrong direction and\noften people who are consuming a lot of\ndiet soda end up gaining weight for this\nreason so it's it's it's not not helping\nthe signals in our body it's disrupting\nthe gut microbiome because again the gut\nmicrobes want to be fed um Fresh Foods\nor Whole Foods or Fiber uh it can be\nfrozen foods but actual food versus a a\na processed Ultra processed version of\nit not includes artificial sweetness so\nthey are um they are they are helping\nyour sweet taste but they're not\nnecessarily helping your body or your\nbrain um is there some way that we can\nCenter the camera a little bit I can try\nit on my end but I think the bottom of\nyour if you can tilt it down just a\ntouch yeah maybe a little bit more there\nwe go perfect that's beautiful and and\nby the way we we absolutely love that\ndegree of resolution in terms of like\nokay so what I'm hearing about\nartificial sweeteners is that they trick\nyour taste buds but they trick other\nparts of your physiology as well right\nso they most right they yes go ahead\nyeah no no go go for it tell us more so\nso these are basically um weight gain\nhas been associated with things like\nnon- neut sweetness or artificial\nsweetness these are compounds right that\nare powerful activators um and are sweet\npaste receptors in the tongue are the\nfirst to perceive them but we also have\nthem elsewhere in the body and so when\nthese receptors are activated by say\nhaving the diet soda or something that\nhas the sweetener these receptors signal\nthe body that you know Sugar's coming\nI'm going to be fed um but so so you\nknow the body T starts to remove sugar\nout of the blood because they perceive\nmore food to be coming and then you have\na sugar crash and you get you know you\nhave a low blood sugar you may not not\nreach\nhypoglycemia but it leads you to feel\nlike you need to consume more food so\nyou and and this is something that has\nbeen associated with actual weight gain\num but you have these receptors that\nperceive the the sweet taste also in the\ngut the liver and um you know it's it's\njust these little nuances matter because\nsometimes you know you want to know more\nthan it's disrupting the G microbiome\nbecause we know that it drives\ninflammation it get it feeds the gut\nmicrobes the wrong type of nutrition\nthat they they really don't thrive on\nand those types of things actually upset\nthe balance in a gut microbiome which\nleads to things like inflammation and\ninflammation in research is being shown\nmore and more to be associated with\nconditions like depression and anxiety\nand even brain fog and and focus\nattention and memory so it's a pretty\nimportant newer mechanism that we're\nunderstanding in mental well-being yeah\nso that that's we're going to dive into\nI'm going to ask you a ton of questions\nabout got microbiome and I understand\nwe've got maybe about half an hour left\nso I just want to make sure I I I caught\nthis because this is fascinating so it\nturns out that artificial sweeteners are\nassociated with weight gain and one of\nthe reasons for that is that if we think\nabout an artificial sweetener it tricks\nour tongue into tasting sweet but our\ntongue is not the only place where\nreceptors for the artificial sweetener\nexist they exist in our liver they exist\nin other parts of our body\nand then they also trick our body into\nexpecting sweetness or sugar and food\nand yes exactly and so then what happens\nis once we trick some of these receptors\nin our liver and other places our body\nresponds by removing blood sugar from\nthe bloodstream because it's thinking\nhey we're going to be getting a new pile\nof sugar or nutrients so we've got to\nclean out the bloodstream so that we can\nstart to get more sugar this results in\na very kind of subclinical\nhypoglycemia mhm and then as we start to\nbecome hypoglycemic and then the The\nfood doesn't come right the nutrients\ndon't come the sugar doesn't come then\nour then our body pendulums the other\nway and then it says oh my God our\nenergy levels are low and then it\ninduces potentially cravings and causes\nus to actually eat things which is why\nI've seen studies that show and I I've\nseen some of these that if you\nespecially if you look at people who\nwill eat like fast food with a diet soda\nthey it doesn't actually impact their\nweight gain at all and that's because\nwe're activating parts of our body to\nactually seek out more\nnutrients that that's awesome so\ninteresting do we get that right that is\nyes no you got that right I was going to\nsay that I want I want it also be clear\nthat there are newer sweeters now um\nsome of them one of them that I've been\nstudying is alul um some of the data\naround arral doesn't arrol does not\naffect insulin resistance that's a key\ndifferentiator may have some other\nissues but I also want to point out that\nyou know people do look for something\nsweet and there are some newer\nsweeteners where all I want you to think\nabout is using a little bit to sweeten\nsomething rather than the baking mixes\nthat they now have of full of and say\nwell okay I'm baking a cake or I'm\nbaking something and I'm going to put\ntwo cups of that in to replace something\nelse I think that that's where we that's\na bit of a mixed message because we're\nnot doing our body or brain good have a\nsweetener have a newer one and just\ndon't and use it in moderation at\nremembering that the diet sodas and\nthings those are really the older\nsweetness that are problematic okay and\nare there other things so you mentioned\nwe'll talk about gut microbiome in a\nsecond you mentioned breath work um we\nwe teach nari or alternate nostril\nbreathing here it's something our\ncommunity is very familiar with um so I\nthink that that stuff is great but are\nthere other things related to anxiety\nand food like things that people should\nknow foods to stay away from or other\nsome of these other principles like I\nthink this artificial sweet one is huge\nanything else\num so I was going to talk about the\nvitamin D before I went to the foods to\nkind of stay away from vitamin D is\ninteresting right because we um\ncertainly I live in the Northeast we we\nmany people are vitamin D deficient so\nwe you know always believe in test don't\nguess check with your doctor get your\nlevel checked but simple things spend 10\nminutes Outdoors before adding sunblock\nor sunscreen um that will allow for\nabout 80% of your vitamin D requirement\nfor that day you can fill that in with\nFoods it doesn't work if you're sitting\nnear window you have to be outdoors\nanother thing that really helps and by\nthe way adequate vitamin D levels or I\nshould say low vitamin D is associated\nwith the low mood and anxiety so just\nmaking sure that you are keeping up with\nthat is important shurin Yoku which is\nForest bathing um uh a Japanese\ndescription of forest bathing and and\nyou know what I say to people is maybe\nyou live in a city maybe the park is the\nclosest you might come to nature but\nthat actually is very help helpful to\nyour body um being able to walk in\nnature these are things which will\nactually help fill in um these\nprinciples that will help T tamper down\nanxiety um we already and then also\nmaking sure that you're sleeping\nadequately because if you sleeping\npoorly and um you you are having\ndisruptive sleep all of that affects\nthings like even your hunger hormones\nand it starts the cycle of disrupting\nyour anxiety um and you know one of the\nthings I I share in the book is really\nthat it's so linked to our metabolism\nand other things so we want to we want\nto keep this front of mind so you\nmentioned that you should uh get 10\nminutes of sunlight without sunscreen\nwhat's the relationship between\nsunscreen and vitamin D so if you're\nwearing uh Sun sunblock or sunscreen\nyou're not your skin is not going to\nabsorb with that well right that because\nyou you basically are protecting\nyourself from certain rays of the Sun\nand we we encourage sunscreen and\nsunlock because of the high levels of\nskin cancer in this country and\nworldwide so the idea is allow for that\nnatural absorption vitamin D interacts\nwith your skin it forms enough that you\nneed at least 80% of what you need for\nthat day but then I want people to be\ncautious because this is not a message\nof all just spend time and we we love\nthe sun we want sunlight because it's\ngood for our bodies it's good for our\nmood but we want to be careful after a\ncertain point that we are protecting\nfrom the damaging gra of the Sun that\ncan damage us okay interesting so so the\nthe UVB that I think that's primarily\nwhat's blocked I forget if it's UVA or\nUVB so there is actually like do we know\nis there science behind sunscreen usage\nand lower levels of vitamin D\nproduction the the the certainly yes so\nuse of sunscreen definitely impacts\nvitamin D that's why that's why I'll\ndescribe it this way interesting and so\nyou also said something about the the\ndietary vitamin D that we get is that\ninsufficient compared to what we get\nfrom sunlight or is there some\ndifference between those two I here's\nwhy I shared it as a tip because you was\nyou was saying let's look at some of the\nholistic measures it's an easy thing to\ndo to step outside we should be stepping\noutside um for a few minutes every day\nanyway you know it's tough in the Zumo\nbut um it's an easy thing to do so why\nnot do something that's easy and then\nfill it in with the way that you're\neating um I feel that the more times we\nhave lower barriers to improve improve\nhow we feeling like stepping outside it\nit just becomes easier awesome and so\nyou uh you've mentioned got microbiome a\ncouple of times can you help us\nunderstand so I know that there are\nstudies that show that even for example\nlike certain subtypes of bacteria are\nmore common with people who have high\nlevels of anxiety certain types of\nbacteria are common with people who have\nhigh levels of a mood disorder they're\nalso now um I think like clinical\nstudies triing stool\ntransplants um and and those have\nactually shown some promising clinical\nresults and a stool transplant is what\nexactly how does that work Dr na do uh\nwell I'm tell a fascinating study um\nactually in schizophrenia there was a\nstudy uh that used a fecal uh uh\nmicrobiome transplant and how that works\nis it's um it's actual it's done\nobviously in a clinical uh sanitary way\nso that it can be done easily but this\nparticular research study took the\nmicrobiome from uh patients who had\nactive schizophrenia symptoms and\ntransplanted the microbiome through an\nfmt into what's an fmt uh fecal uh\nmicrob microbiome microbiome transplant\nand the mice developed symptoms of\nschizophrenia so so what so let me just\nunderstand that correctly we took a\nhuman human with schizophrenia with\nschizophrenia we took their poop right\nwe took their feces we implanted it in a\nmouse and the mouse exhibited symptoms\nof schizophrenia schizophrenia now how\ndo we detect schizophrenia in the mouths\ndo you have any\nidea I would like to know that goes\nbeyond my understanding exactly I was\nfascinated by the study you know I think\nthat they looked at the they looked at\ncertain behaviors in the mice and they\nuh were able to track them so it is a\nfascinating question what I thought was\nvery powerful about the study was that\nthat is coded in the you know when we\nsay use the word microbiome we referring\nto the genetic material along with the\nmicrobes what I think was fascinating is\nit's it was the fact that we yes we\nremoving the poop but we was doing it\nthrough an fmt from the microbiome and\nreplacing it in these animals and it's\nchanging their behavior yeah you know so\nI think that that that to me was a just\na powerful indicator of where we can go\nyou know sorry yeah no I mean I think\nthat's that's especially interesting\nbecause when we think about you know\nclinically about schizophrenia I sort of\nwas taught um you know by a faculty at\nlike yourself that that schizophrenia is\nbasically uncurable that that we don't\nreally have any good evidence that that\nI mean some people may disagree and\nthere are some studies and stuff out of\nlike Lapin Norway and things like that\nabout sustained remission or potentially\ncure there are certainly psychoanalytic\nperspectives but I I think I mean going\nthrough my clinical training I sort of\nfelt like depression and anxiety are\nmuch more curable or we can put those\ninto sustained remission whereas\nschizophrenia feels a lot more\nuntreatable like if we look at just the\nthe trajectories of people with\nschizophrenia they you know depression\nmaybe some people can get better but\nit's really fascinating to see that even\nin such a tractable biologically based\nillness that we can see improvements so\nlet's talk a yeah go sorry sorry no so I\nagree with that and you know there are\nsome dietary measures that we've been\nlooked at um that could potentially help\nconditions like both bipolar disorder\nand schizophrenia which in our training\nwe were certainly taught with the more\nserious and severe conditioning\ncondition so I agree with you on that um\none of them is a ketogenic diet and one\nof the things I would say about that is\nthere there's some good evidence behind\nit uh but I think we also know that not\nall schizophrenics uh come with the\nresources uh not individuals with\nschizophrenia have the resources to have\nsomeone help them Count Their micros\ntheir macros and manage their diet they\nmay live in residential group home and\nnot have access to just healthy Whole\nFoods they may have state AED foods\nwhich could be sliced bread and prous so\nyeah so can just important to understand\nabsolutely so I I I think um what I'm\nhearing from you is is that a lot of our\nbeliefs about schizophrenia may come\nfrom the situations that these people\nlive in so it's not so much that the\nillness is not improvable or even\ncurable it's that these people or some\nof the people in society that have kind\nof the worst environment if we're\ntalking about holistic health they're\nthe place that they live the kinds of\nfoods that they eat they have so many\ndisadvantages outside of the disease\nprocess of schizophrenia that really\ncould be responsible for the very poor\noutcomes that we see which makes perfect\nsense to me um can you talk can you talk\na little bit about ketogenic diet so\nlike what is the impact of ketogenic\ndiet on something like an anxiety\ndisorder panic\nattacks right so it it certainly has\nbeen helpful one of the things I talk\nabout is a kind of a you know an\nadaptation of the keto diet and it can\nbe helpful I think that in in my\nclinical practice I've only used it in a\nshort form nature with individuals and\nthat be that's because my view of the\nresearch is that it's not sustainable\nfor a lot of people so it can be very\nhelpful things like therapeutic\ncarbohydrate reduction in someone who\nhas gained weight from a um from a an\nanticho medication or other medication\nuh in psychopharmacology that cause\ncauses weight gain or metabolic changes\ncan be really helpful meaning that you\nbalance up the type of carbohydrates\nthat you're eating and that that is not\nthe main focus of your meal you remember\nthe food pyramid from way back was\ncompletely backwards right it had us\neating multiple servings of bread rice\npasta or whatever it was um and that has\nreally evolved and changed over time and\nwe understand things a little bit better\nso it's helping someone tweak that and\ngiving them the support to to do so so\nit can be very helpful in certain\nconditions um in in these conditions to\nhelp someone e also gain lose some\nweight from these side effects but also\nmetabolically improve the symptoms so\ncan you tell us what what do you mean by\nthis term therapeutic carbohydrate\nreduction it's actually a term that is\nused to help us understand the it's\nalmost understanding the types of\ncarbohydrates we can consume and\nunderstanding that a carbohydrate can\ncome from cauliflower which is very low\nin calorie um and high in fiber and\nother nutrients that our body needs\nversus pasta or a slice of bread and\nusing those\nuh in a therapeutic way but reducing the\nkind of bread pasture that we've been\ntaught to eat in a way that still\nbalances up your macronutrients and\nmicronutrients and helps your dietary\nkind of improvement in this condition\nyeah so Dr Ruma I've got kind of a a\ndifferent sort of non-scientific\nquestion for you but that hopefully your\nexpertise can help us with sure I just\nlike bread and pasta more than\ncauliflower so when you're working with\npeople how do you actually like how do\nyou eat healthy right so you're saying\nall this stuff oh like microbiome and\nthis and that and like cut out this and\ncut out that and but like from the\nPractical perspective like let's say I'm\nlike 25 years old or 24 years old I've\ngot a roommate or two and like we're\nlike living there right I I work for\neight hours a day I commute for like 75\nminutes a day I do laundry and I have to\nlike sustain myself like I you know it's\nnot like I have all the money in the\nworld how how does one practically like\neat healthy like what works for your\npatients first and foremost I think it's\nit really starts with uh feeling the\nurge the\nmotivation the the emotional kind of um\nsignal that you want to make a change\nright because it's I fundamentally\nbelieve a look that many of us know\nwe've been to school or we've studied uh\nthings in science we know what healthy\neating is but it's really hard for\npeople to implement it a busy mom busy\nfamily busy busy younger person has so\nmuch much going on I usually start with\nwhat's bothering you most about your\ndiet with some of my patients it might\nbe hey during Co IAT began eating ice\ncream every day you know I can only\nafford fast food I really can't St shop\nat the supermarket because those foods\nare too expensive so what do I do it's\nso much easier to pick up this burger\nand fries and I get a free soda with it\nwhy would I you know go cook cauliflower\ndiet\nsoda\nand and you know uh make make it a large\nprice but also you know I'm not going to\ngo to supermarket and cook something so\nit has to start with something that you\nwant to change because if not it's there\nisn't really a level for you to make a\nchange and that's sort of more of the\npsychology uh psych psychology be think\npart of it and so so I'm in I'm in a\nslightly advantaged position because the\npeople coming to my clinic have all been\nreferred because they're interested in\nthat work if someone is listening to\nthis new Feld well you know what this is\njust feels too hard one of the things I\ndo in my books is I break down shopping\nlists I break down foods that you can\neat all things by the way you can take\nphotographs off and keep on your phone\nfoods to avoid or cut back on certain\ncondition here's one nitrates in\nprocessed Meats have been shown to\nworsen depression U simple thing but you\nknow that could help you choose um that\ncould help you make a healthier choice\nthe next time maybe uh buy a roasted\nchicken breast from the store instead of\nthe the processed deli meat version of\nit um so I think that start with\nsomething that's bothering you if let me\ngive you a few examples if it's the ice\ncream um there's a way to make ice cream\nfrom bananas and you can even make a\nchocolate flavor with cacao flavor NOS\nwhich are great for your brain so there\nare ways around this because I don't\ndemonize sugar but I want people to know\nthat sugar added sugars are just not the\nbest option for us so here's here are\nsome things you know say you don't want\nto cook breakfast can you get small a\nsmall plain yogurt and eat it with\nberries even frozen blueberries and a\nbit of cinnamon because that will save\nyou on tons of added sugar calories from\nthe fruited yogurt that will be on sale\neach week in the supermarket so things\nthat you can do you don't actually have\nto cook the food but choose Whole Foods\nand by the way there even non-dairy\nversions of uh probiotic Rich yogurt now\nso there there's a few choices we can\nmake yeah that's awesome so I'm so\ncurious so can you tell us a little bit\nabout the N nitrates and their effect on\ndepression so some some research showed\nthat uh for for some reason um the\nnitrates especially that are found in\nthese processed meats and part of it is\nthe fact that these meats are you know\nthey they look the way that they do but\nthey actually highly processed to get to\nthat stage versus if you do consume meat\nand you go to the the store or the\nButcher and you see a piece of chicken\nbreast it's a piece of chicken breast\nit's it's come it's been taken or\nremoved and the butcher has done what he\nneeded to do the sliced deli meat has\nbeen highly processed to get to that\npoint it has preservatives additives and\nlots of things and one of them is\nnitrates and for whatever reason it\nseemed to have caused people to be more\ndepressed when when they ate it so if\nyou're eating a lot of that maybe\nsomething to think about interesting so\nso we're not quite sure what the\nmechanism behind processed meats and and\nnitrates so it seems to be nitrates in\nit and that somehow negatively affects\nour mood and is associated with\ndepression so what about some of these\nthings like intermittent fasting or\nsuper high protein diets um some people\nare even on something like called the\ncarnivore diet where they like eat\nexclusively meat uh what do we know\nabout intermittent fasting in mental\nhealth or high amounts of protein or\nmeat intake in mental health sure so\nwith intermittent fasting there's really\ngood body of evidence for physical\nhealth for autophagy cellular turnover\nuh rest ing our body and being able to\nconsume U calories in a certain window\nof time and be fasting the rest of the\ntime Windows tend to vary for men and\nwomen and um what so women men tend to\nbe able to tolerate uh longer hours of\nfasting than women and that's been that\nhappen to be shown in research as for\nthe reason I I don't know off the top of\nmy head but I think that that's an\nthat's one important difference um I\nthink that what we don't necessarily\nknow yet is intermittent fasting and\nmental health anecdotally by patients\nwho actually tolerate fasting under my\nguidance or the guidance of another\nphysician actually say that they feel\nclearer they have less brain fog they\nhave more energy so I think that that is\npositive and worth worth\nresearching some of the difficulties\nthough that I want to point out with\nthings like intermittent fasting is\npeople interpret these things\ndifferently um I've met some young women\nrecently who were eating for 2 and 1\nhalf hours of the day and fasting the\nrest of the day which which is by the\nway extreme um you know and when asked\nif they exercise and are able to be\nactive they actually reported all\ndifferent demographics different parts\nof the country not patients of mine\nreported feeling really weak and not\nbeing able to exercise so for me that's\na bit of a Miss because leading that or\ntrying to achieve a better lifestyle\nthere's no perfect lifestyle none of us\nis perfect but being able to exercise\nand and be outdoors and do this type\nthing if you don't have the energy\nshould you really be eating for two and\na half to three hours a day shouldn't it\nbe a little bit longer so some of that\nlike as you know as a psychiatrist this\ncan tip over into things like eating\ndisorders or disordered eating of some\nkind um so I would be careful about that\nso good good if intermittent fasting\nworks for you you naturally fast you\nhave a a good solid plan of hours that\nyou eat and it's resting your body the\nrest of the time great um with um with\nthe the extreme diets whether it's\ncarnivore or fully ban I think that that\nmy position on eating is really centered\non food equity and what I mean by that\nis if you if you eat chicken beef and\ncauliflower that's what you like to eat\nbasically I'm going to work with you to\ntweak what you're eating to the best\navailable\nfoods that you have access that you have\nfor your mental well-being I don't feel\nit's my role to tell you to be Carnival\nor vegan I think that with the extreme\ndieting people it works for people and\nuh that's good for them but they are\nmissing on muts from some foods if a\ncarnivore is never eating vegetables we\nneed a lot of those phytonutrients from\nvegetables if a plant-based person is\nnever going to eat um meat or fish they\nmight miss out on omega-3 fatty acids\nfrom Seafood and vitamin B12 which is\nmostly found in um animal sources so\nthey might need to supplement with\nnutritional yeast a vitamin b supplement\naloh oil supps Etc so I don't think\nthere's a perfect diet I think we take\nwhat we like to eat and we tweak it I\nfeel like the diet culture in this\ncountry divides people and confuses them\nso um how so all because when when um\nPhysicians\ninfluences um uh individual who app Pine\non a certain eating pattern come out and\nsay never eat spinach or only eat\nspinach something is missing in the\nbalanced plate of both those individuals\nand I feel that the that in this country\nthere's a huge focus on weight loss and\nself-help and that's great but what\nabout our metabolic Health what about\nour mental health they are all connected\nyou know you can't supplement a bad diet\nyou can't exercise out of a bad diet so\nI think they're just going back to more\nWhole Foods that we can eat to the best\nof your ability whatever your situation\nmay be I think is a better choice in um\njust in moving moving the conversation\nforward protein is hugely important you\nasked about that um and we should be\ngetting enough of it but I'll tell you\nmost Americans lack fiber in their diet\nso just eating vegetables you get get\nfiber from plant-based sources so\nvegetables um uh fruit beans nuts seeds\nlegumes healthy whole grain you you\ncan't get fiber from meter or seafood so\njust make sure you're having that\nbalance because fiber is what feeds your\nmicrobiome interesting okay so so um if\nI'm let me just make sure I kind of\nheard you so I I really love your\napproach of like kind of meeting people\nwhere they're at right so you when\nsomeone comes to you it's sort of\nstarting with okay like where do you\nwant to make a change first of all\nwhat's your motivation to make a change\nand what are some Alternatives so it's\nnot that you have to eat fiber or you\nhave to eat spinach in fact I I what I'm\nhearing you kind of say is it's kind of\na problem because right now we live in a\na a society and about 50% of our\naudience is from North America by the\nway so you're talking to everyone\nincluding people from Ethiopia and\nMalaysia and in the Philippines and all\nover the place um and and so I I really\nlove kind of your perspective which is\nthat if someone comes to you and says\nhey I want to be on the carnivore diet\nyou're like okay or hey I want to be\nvegan you're like okay and and everyone\nout there right now is saying this is\nbad or this is good or you should try\nthis and I feel amazing or whatever but\nthat what you really try to do is start\nwith with people where they are and then\nwhat's one thing that we can do that\nwill sort of move you in the direction\nthat you need to go then\nand yeah any diet out there it may have\nsome kind of deficiency it doesn't\nmatter which Spectrum you're on and I\nlove this what you said about whether\nsomeone's saying eat only spinach or\nnever eat spinach both of those have a\nproblem right and and then I'm also\nhearing that um and and if you can just\nshow us your your book real quick so I\ndon't think people can see that see it\nbecause it's out of frame it's it's in\nthe corner but I have one here so this\nis the book called come your mind with\nfood and this is my first book I'll show\nyou I'll show you both while I so this\nis the first book which kind of covers\nall mental health conditions and this is\nthe book that's new that's coming out\nthat's really about helping anxiety um\nand helping people eat for their better\ncontrol or management of worry and\nanxiety and stress that's awesome um and\nwhat I also kind of what I heard you\nmention is that if we sort of think\nabout how do I eat healthy so sure it\nstarts with motivation but then we're\ninundated with so much information and\nso it sounds like you've got a lot of\nstuff in there just just yeah\nconflicting information so just you've\ngot some resources in there that sort of\nalmost offload the cognitive part right\nso you've kind of figured things out for\npeople they can take a look at a list\nand they can figure out what kind of\napplies to them correct\nand and what condition condition applies\nfor them so in my first book say you\nhave a family member with the PT PTSD\nbut you're struggling with depression\nyou know you just try out different\nparts of the book different parts of the\nplan and do what works for you um I\nthink that you know a studies show that\n70% of individuals globally especially\nsince you have a global audience never\nsee a mental health professional never\nsee a mental health professional which\nmeans and speaks to us having more\nsolutions for those of us out there who\nmay never see you or me um in a Prof in\na professional capacity maybe you know\num and and so food since we're eating\neven if you're intermittent fasting\nmaybe you're having one meal a day it's\nsomething we're all doing and it is a\npowerful um Vector that we can change\nawesome so are there other things like\nany interesting like mechanisms you\nmentioned gut microbiome maybe we can\ntalk about that so what's the\nrelationship between gut microbiome food\nand\nanxiety so the um when we go back to\nthose gut microbes and them digesting\nthe food um they uh are involved in\nseveral reactions as food is is broken\ndown and what we Now understand is\nthere's even kind of more cool stuff\nlike different different types of\nbacteria that interact with food so\nhere's a few lactobacillus plantarum\ninfluences dopamine and serotonin levels\nthat help mood and anxiety um when it\ncomes to specifically anxiety there's\nanother identified bacteria called\nlactobacillus alticus that lows cortisol\nlevels and therefore helps anxiety we\nknow that when we stressed and corol\nlevels are high we know that that can be\nproblematic for levels of anxiety um\nanother bacteria um it actually eases\nanxiety symptoms is lacto basilis quesi\nso we now knowing the difference we\nunderstanding a little bit more on the\nmicrobiome level of what the different\nmicro uh the different microbes are\nactually doing so I feel like one of the\ndirections I'm really hoping um we go in\nis um psychobiotics so psychobiotics is\nbasically the use of uh preim probiotics\nand foods to improve mental health\nsymptoms and what it will do is\ncircumvent the need in some individuals\nfor the use of a prescription medication\nuh another powerful one by the way uh\nlactobacilus rosis which actually\ntargets those um Gaba receptors so as we\nlearn to fill in more of this\ninformation we are understanding the\npower of what we can do to positively\nmanipulate the microbiome for our mental\nwell-being so you mentioned these these\nvarious kinds of lactobacillus but like\nI'm sitting here at home how do I get\nthe benefit of whatever lactobacillus\nyou're talking about very easy one of\nthe ways to think about this is that the\nfood we eat they each have a microbi so\nif you're eating remember you know if I\nthink about a dish a plate that you're\neating on I want it to be a lot of plant\nFoods because they give you fiber\nphytonutrients and vitamins and minerals\nand each of those plants has a\nmicrobiome of their own so by eating\nthose Foods as well as eating fermented\nfoods fermented foods almost every\nculture has one kimchi cfir uh kombucha\nwhatever it is that that you enjoy try\nto add those in because fermented foods\nhave liveactive cultures by eating these\nFoods you are actually Gathering as many\nof these microbes into your diet\nspecifically if you want that strain\nwe'd have to go in the direction of\nmicrobiome testing we'd have to look at\ncompanies that are more private uh in\nthe private sector that can test your\nmicrobiome say hey look you probably\nneed to eat these foods and take these\nsupplements to help along your\nmicrobiome um and that's when you get\ninto the more details and specifics but\nthe overarching message is you will\nstart to get these microbes if you just\nare eating more of those Whole Foods and\nyou are focusing on things like\nPrebiotic foods which garlic leaks\nonions bananas um fermented foods like I\nmentioned what is a Prebiotic food what\ndoes that mean Prebiotic food so\nprebiotics are what feeds your gut\nmicrobes but prebiotics can be a\nsupplement but they can be obtained from\nactual food garlic leaks onions uh\nbananas hikima Jerusalem AR of chokes\nlots of different veggies actually have\nthat so you can eat it through food you\ndon't have to take a supplement um so\ngetting all of these pieces in and\npaying attention to fermented foods\nwhich give you like liveactive cultures\nthat enter your body and enter your\nmicrob biome and really just helping you\nhelping you fill in this picture okay\nand you mentioned um trauma so I I know\nwe've got maybe about 5 to 10 minutes\nleft just let us know you know which of\nthose is closer to what works for you\nbut um so you so you mentioned in your\nfirst book you talked a little bit about\nPTSD and I I've I've seen a ton of\nresearch on mood disorders um even a\nlittle bit of research on psychotic\ndisorders anxiety disorders but I I\nreally haven't seen much about trauma\nbecause I I sort of think about trauma\nas you know kind of like a psychological\nor sometimes physical thing that happens\nto you but what is the relationship\nbetween trauma and like gut health right\nso you know um trauma uh we know well\nlet me start with this the microbes uh\nrespond to things like emotional changes\nyou have a fight with your boss\nsomething's not going well at work the\nmicrobes actually have been shown to\nrespond in a certain way so they they're\npretty sensitive to emotions as well as\nto food and other things like stress\nwait hold on you just blew my mind how\nhow does that work how is a microbe\nresponsible to my\nemotions so when you know uh when when\nyou have when you experience stress the\nthe microbes sense that and they are\npart of your body right they're not a\nseparate entity they're all they're all\npart of it so if you're are emotionally\nexperiencing something they start to\nrespond um and based on that we now know\nthat there's a pretty fascinating\nresearch on things like blueberries and\nuh This was done in an animal animal\nmodel of\nPTSD um and basically helped us\nunderstand that eating blueberries on a\nregular basis can actually friend off\nsome deoa of stress associated with PTSD\nand can help so it it just little things\nthat um pull out the information we have\nand gives us a little bit more to work\non um this particular study was done in\n2016 um it really looked at PTSD as a uh\nstress related disorder and uh looked at\nthe process the underlying process of\noxidative stress and inflammation\nspecifically in the prefrontal cortex to\nCortex and\nhippocampus um usually as you know we\nprescribe ssris for these conditions but\noften their effect is\nif any so having more tools in the\ntoolbx in addition to psychotherapy and\nother forms of therapy like the MDR and\nthings like that become really important\nfor for people to to have so uh when you\nsaid these effects are marginal you're\ntalking about trauma disorders in in\nssris or you're talking about anxiety\ndisorders I was talking about trauma\nbecause you asked me about trauma but by\nthe way they also have very limited\neffects in anxiety and research has\nshown um that in fact only about 25% of\npeople actually improve when they take\nan SSRI medication a huge number of\npeople have a marginal effect and others\nhave no effect at all so you know again\nspeaking to the fact that um by all\nmeans that doesn't mean someone should\nstop their medication always speak to\nyour doctor because these things are\nhugely important but you may be taking\nsomething and if you're not finding that\nyou're getting an improvement in your\nsymptoms then advocating for long\nconversation with your doctor to see\nwhat other options exist become\nimportant yeah so how do you as a\npsychiatrist kind of like what's your\nwhat's your rubric for combining let's\nsay something like an SSRI for an\nanxiety disorder with food like how do\nyou practically approach it I approach\nit I have three three sort of groups of\nindividuals who approach me um one group\nis uh being prescribed a medication and\nthey want to use nutrition to tweak what\nthey're doing and in that group of\npeople depending on the severity of\ntheir symptoms we can sometimes stay at\nthe same medication or even over time\nlower their medications while using and\nseeing if nutritional interventions make\na difference another group of people are\nindividuals who are feeling anxiety\nfeeling symptoms and they really want to\ntake a more holistic approach but\nthey're also not so sick they're not\nactively psychotic they're not suicidal\nthey're not homicidal um they not manic\nfor example and they can they\nfunctioning but they're not feeling\ngreat and they're a great group and a\nlot probably the largest part of my\npractice who want to come in and tweak\ntheir diet and lifestyle factors uh work\non their metabolic Health in order to\nimprove their symptoms and then the\nthird group are just individuals who are\ntrying to see what would work they may\nor may not be on medication um and and\nand sort of looking to they may actually\nhave a different condition and come from\na different specialty entirely it might\nbe a referral from my favorite an\northopedic surgeon\nuh you know or or an infectious disease\nDoctor Who said a patient to see me but\nvery specific related conditions that\nthey wanted to work on that actually had\nhad come about on account of their\nmedical um primary medical condition\ninteresting okay so it sounds like you\nget different kinds of patients and\ndepending on where they're coming from\nand what their goals are you really try\nto find a balance between medication or\nnot medication I I think you are one of\nthe growing number of psychiatrists and\nthis is probably a selection bias on my\npart who is finding um a decreasing\nvalue towards pharmacology is a is a\nsingular approach so I I know my\nclinical experience was just that the\nmore I practice Psychiatry the more I\nfind that medications really don't fix\nproblems and that there's a subset of\npatients I would say for about a third\nof my patients they really have a\nsignificant benefit and and for some\npeople they really can be quite\nlife-changing but that the idea that the\naverage person is going to have a\nlife-changing experience after starting\na medication is something that I've sort\nof learned the hard way is not the case\nit's not that easy yeah and and as sort\nof the relative value of medication I've\nseen a lot of kind of postmarket studies\nabout the percentage of ssris that are\nactually Placebo as opposed to like a\npharmacologic benefit that number seems\nto be growing and growing and\ngrowing the more important some of these\nthings like food become so as we're\nlearning more about the science as we're\nlearning more about gut microbiome and\ninflammation and things like that um so\nI I guess my last question for you is if\nsomeone's like interested in this right\nlet's say that I'm someone out there and\nI have anxiety and I want to do\nsomething for my health where can we get\nmore information I mean do you have a\nclinic do you see people um you know\nwhat what's the next step for me if I\nwant to get better with my anxiety and I\nwant to do something about it what\nshould I do so look I um have a very I\nhave a weight list clinic right now so I\nI wouldn't want to misinform people and\nsay hey just contact me because right\nnow we're not at that place but we're\ntrying to grow our resources and we're\ntrying to train more clinicians to do\nthis kind of work um the best way to get\nstarted uh to understand my work is\nactually believe it or not to start\nworking through my books because they\nwalk you through lists of food types of\nfoods to eat types of foods to cook easy\nrecipes um I started cooking later in\nlife so I know it's not easy so I I I\nwant to make it really accessible for\npeople um like I said take photographs\nof different lists and use them when use\nsupermarke or doing your online shopping\ncalm your mind with food the book that\nI've just written is about filling that\nGap 25 there has been a 25% increase in\nanxiety since Co has published in the\nlandset so we know that many more people\nare suffering we know that early times\nof Co zolof went on shortage because\nthere was so many new prescriptions for\nanxiety um so so the way to get started\nis to work through the science in the\nbook uh understand the micronutrients or\njust go to the third part which is how\ndo you solve the problem list of foods\nto shop for an anti- anxiety shopping\nlist a few pages of a protocol you can\nfollow uh easy recipes that you can make\nat home that are interchangeable whether\nyou you Carnival or vegan um and uh ways\nthat you can feel better it it's meant\nto be filling that Gap while you might\nbe made to see a therapist or a doctor\nor you just want to try something on\nyour own and tweak your diet in a\nslightly healthier way yeah that's\nthat's beautiful I think one of the\nthings that I really like about\nresources like yours is that um one of\nthe things that I think is actually like\na big problem in our mental health\nsystem is that the majority of our\nmental health professionals have no\ntraining in the body yeah so so you know\nI think psychologists and and clinical\nsocial workers and stuff they're all\namazing people but just the way that\nthey're educated a and I think that\nworked fine and it's still very\neffective so we know that Psychotherapy\nis an incredibly effective um\nintervention but I think the more that\nwe're learning that the mind is actually\npart of the body I I find that more and\nmore psychologists and and and social\nworkers and stuff that I've worked with\nare like getting into it and it's it's\nreally problematic because I think a lot\nof people will see only a therapist and\nthey'll never see a medical doctor which\nis fine because the majority of\npsychiatrists out there are primarily\nPsych pharmacologists they have 15minute\nMed visits they prescribe a medication\nand then it's out the door or they'll\nsee a nurse practitioner or something\nlike that but but I I think it's really\nhard because we we we are seeing so many\nstudies about the benefits of food\nprobiotics prebiotics whatever and so\nhow do you incorporate that if you're\njust seeing a therapist and that's why\nI'm really glad that we have people like\nyou writing books like the ones that\nyou're writing thank you I appreciate\nthat so thank you so much and uh we hope\nto see you back I I have many more\nquestions about other illnesses and and\nespecially like trauma and PTSD because\nthat's one thing I'm really curious\nabout kind of what you think about that\nbut thanks a lot I will definitely be\nback thank you so much for inviting me\nit was great to talk to all of you take\ncare bye take care bye\nbye all\nright we're good I'm still streaming but\nyou're they can hear you but thanks a\nlot druma\nbye okay how was that chat screw\ncarnivore and vegan I'm beating both\nthat's the that's the\nStrat\num yeah so so yeah Dr naid is fantastic\num I I this is my actually first time\ntalking to her but she's uh I I know\npeople that know her very very very very\nwell\num and and so strongly recommend yall\ncheck out her book I mean she's I don't\nthink she kind of mentioned this but\nshe's also like you know I don't know if\nshe's still there but was faculty at\nHarvard for a long time and all that\nkind of stuff she didn't toot her own\nhorn um but she she's awesome and and\nthat's why I actually really loved like\ntraining there because it's awesome you\nhave all of these like experts who like\nI mean I've never met someone who is a\npsychiatrist and then like went to\nculinary school and then is a\nnutritional biologist right so this is\nkind of like so you all have Dr K and Dr\nK is like pseudo monk became a\npsychiatrist whatever is an influencer I\nguess so like there are a couple of\ndifferent slices and the really awesome\nthing is that there are people out there\nwho are like other kinds of like\namalgamations right they're Franken\nstoni and monsters of nutritional\nbiology chef and medical doctor and\nmental health\nprofessional and so if yall really want\nto understand stuff I I think her book\nis also like she said pretty practical\nso my experience of what makes adopting\na diet hard is there are a couple of\ndifferent pieces of it so this is why\npeople can't can't eat healthy so there\na couple things we got to understand the\nfirst is that we're habituated to eat a\na particular way so if you grew up\neating something your neurons get wired\nso that you reach for those things when\nyour body sends you signals so if I grow\nup in a an environment of processed food\nand like eating fast food which is what\nI how I grew up now even today when I\nfeel\nhungry what does my brain what is the\nexperience of my brain for what solves\nhunger I know that fast food is going to\nsolve my Hunger so what's happened is\nthat our brain has been conditioned\nbecause when we feel hungry this is what\nmakes it go away and the more you do\nthat as a child that's what gets baked\nin so this is when your brain is wiring\nin this way it's also learning other\nfundamentals of life like gravity like\nwhat is the force of gravity how high do\nI need to jump or how hard do I need to\njump to reach this particular place so\nwe're wiring and we have all of this\nhabitual circuitry going on in our brain\nthe second problem that people have with\neating healthy is that they don't have\nthe right motivation and what do I mean\nby that so if we look at like motivation\nmotivation is not intellectual so you\ncan watch something like this you can\nsee someone else who's healthy and you\ncan think oh my God I need to eat\nhealthy but this is an intellectual\nthought the parts of your brain and body\nthat select foods are not the same parts\nthat want to eat healthy so this is a\nhuge discrepancy right because your\nbrain is saying one thing and your\nstomach in your tongue or saying\nsomething else those by the way are just\ndifferent parts of your brain it's all\ncoming from your brain in some way or\nvice versa so the other thing is that\nyou really have to connect with your\nemotional need is the simplest way to\nput it your motivational drive to really\neat healthy so what I would ask you is\nwhat is it worth to you to eat healthy\nand it can't be an answer like oh like I\nwant to be healthy because that's a good\nthing right I want to exercise every day\nbecause that's a good thing I want to do\nyoga for an hour every day because\nthat's a good thing I want to you know\ngo out and feed the Homeless because\nthat's there's a thousand things out\nthere that are that should be good\nthings but the real question is why does\nit matter to you and if it doesn't\nmatter to you then it's not going to\nwork and like let's let me give you all\na simple example so some people will say\nwell I want to eat healthy because I\nfeel\nembarrassed every time I go to the beach\nbecause my friends take off their shirt\nand I'm not very sexy so when I take off\nmy shirt I feel embarrassed and so your\nbrain then has a problem right which is\nthat when I take off my shirt I feel\nembarrassed and we want to avoid that\nand here's your [ __ ] head which is\nlike okay if I eat healthy for 6 months\nor nine months and I exercise every day\nI can fix that problem because then when\nI take off my shirt I will feel proud of\nmyself but the thing is your brain isn't\na efficient organ it's not an\ninefficient organ so the brain comes up\nwith another solution hey you don't feel\ngood when your shirt is off at the beach\nI can fix that without nine months of\nworking out and eating healthy and\nsuffering and doing hard things I can\nfix that so much easier just don't\ngo problem solved right because at the\nend of the day the situation is the same\nyou can take off your shirt you can feel\ngood about yourself or you can just\navoid going in the first place and so\nthe problem that we we're dealing with\nin society today is that our brain is\nreally really efficient it's figured out\nalternatives to the healthy things and\nso this is why if you really want to eat\nhealthy you really have to think a\nlittle bit about what what is this worth\nto me what am I willing to sacrifice it\nfor it and this is where unless so if we\nlook at the sacrifice required to eat\nhealthy in terms of lack of enjoyment\nwillpower effort money not being able to\nplay video games not being able to relax\nmore because now you got to cook the\namount of hours I have to spend cleaning\nright CU everyone's like oh yeah like\ncooking health is so great everyone you\nshould cook at home who ever talks about\ncleaning like cleaning is a pain in the\nass do you guys get that like I don't\nhave to clean anything ever if I just\neat out it's just you eat out is a\ndisposable container nice disposable\ncontainer can you imagine how\ncrappy like purchasing food outside and\nfast food was if you ever had to do\ndishes so half of eating healthy is not\neven about food it's about the cleaning\nso you have to really figure out\nsomething within you that makes it worth\nthe pain in the ass a couple of other\nthings that people don't understand\nabout eating healthy is that when you\ncrave things it's not actually you\ncraving it it's actually your gut\nmicrobiome craving it so some of the\nmost fascinating research that I've\nlooked at I'll try to pull up a\nreference shows that so this is what\nwhat Dr naid was talking a little bit\nabout so so when I have a set of gut\nbacteria if I eat a particular diet okay\nwhat happens is the foods that I eat\nwill select for some kinds of bacteria\nso there's some bacteria that can break\ndown broccoli and there's some bacteria\nthat will survive off of french fries\nand these bacteria are two different\nsets of bacteria because one of can one\nof them can break down things like\ncellulose and like other kinds of like\ncomplex fibers and they can eat that and\nthere's a bacteria that's like nah brah\nwe want like oil and simple\ncarbohydrates potatoes and so then what\nhappens is if I'm used to eating french\nfries and I stop eating french fries the\nFrench fry eating bacteria start to\ndie and as they start to die they\nincrease inflammation which then makes\nus feel more depressed feel more anxious\nwhich in turn then fatigues our frontal\nloes right so the more inflamed our\nbrain is the less energy it has the less\nwillpower we have when when you have the\nflu you don't have the willpower to do\nanything that's because you have a whole\nbody inflammation going on as our\nwillpower\ndeclines then our ability to control our\nimpulses drops so as those french fry\neating bacteria start dying they're like\nI may die but my friend over there that\nalso eats french fries I'm going to save\nmy friend by fatiguing your brain and\nthen you will crave french fries and\nthen we'll save them there's even some\nevidence that as these be Bia die they\nstart to release chemical Messengers\nthat travel to your brain and literally\nstimulate so this is not just whole body\ninflammation that that's just like it's\nlike a general whole body inflammation\nthat fatigues your brain it's not\nspecific but these bacteria also have\nguided missiles so they secrete\nparticular neurotransmitters that do\ncross the blood brain barrier and induce\ncravings for some kinds of food so if we\nsort of stop and think about it this is\nhow craving work works right so if I\ncrave water how does that work it's\nbecause there's something somewhere that\nis secreting a chemical signal in this\ncase it could be coming from someplace\nlike the kidney which measures our fluid\nbalance and stuff like that or even\nthere are certain cored barel receptors\nthere receptors over here there are\nreceptors around the heart there are all\nthese kinds of receptors that will\ndetect our fluid level and then they\nsend signals to parts of our brain to\nhave us crave water oh my God I'm so\nthirsty oh my God I'm so thirsty oh my\nGod I'm so thirsty right and in that\nsame way these bacteria will send\nsignals too that will cause Cravings so\nthis is why eating healthy is hard it's\nnot just like oh my God that guy over\nthere is eating healthy and therefore it\nshould be easy for me no you are\nactually moving against your body when\nyou are eating healthy see everyone\nthinks that eating healthy is healthy\nand your body will want it it's actually\nthe opposite your body doesn't want to\neat healthy because millions of years\nago when our body was evolving it was\nlike oh I can eat this tuber which is\nvery low caloric density or I can eat\nbutter and if I eat butter the\nlikelihood that I will live is actually\nbetter and so we have all of this stuff\nthat has been engineered in our body to\nsurvive in calorie deficient situations\nright this is what most animals do most\nanimals a struggle for life is a\nstruggle for calories this is why\ngrizzly bears will fight each other to\nbe able to eat\nsalmon and so now what's happened is we\nhave such an abundance of of calories\nthat our body is actually working\nagainst us now that which allowed us to\nsurvive has suddenly become that which\nkills us more people die of obesity and\ndiabetes than they do of starvation in\nthe world today this is the problem that\nwe live with so everyone's talking about\neating healthy is if it's a good thing\nit's not a good thing it's not actually\nwhat your body is designed to do your\nbody's working against you and so that's\nwhy if you really want to eat healthy\nyou have to first of all understand this\nand understand that what you're really\ndealing with is about somewhere probably\naround 21 days of hardship so this is\nthe other thing that a lot of people\nneed to get so it takes maybe about two\nto three weeks this is kind of my\nclinical and personal experience for\nyour body bacteria to overhaul so I\ndon't know exactly how long they're\nalive and things like that but if you\ncan kind of make it to the two we Mark\n3- week Mark then there's a good chance\nthat you'll do a lot better and for\nthose of y'all that have tried dieting\nyou'll know kind of what I'm talking\nabout because for the first two days\ndieting is easy right you can give\nsomething up for 2 days why is it that\ndieting gets hard at the weeklong Mark\nit's because that's when these bacteria\nstart to die they've stored up some\nstuff in the bank they can survive for a\nwhile but once you're like one week of\nlike broccoli instead of french fries\nthis is when the bacteria start dying\nand then they dump all these chemical\nsignals those chemical signals travel to\nyour brain and they induce\ncravings and then what happens is since\nthere's an emotional fluctuation\nthroughout the week right they catch you\non a weak point oh my God I haven't\neaten this for a week and I eat it and\noh my God it tastes so good and then\nthat\nreinforces all of these craving signals\nin your brain and they're like oh my god\nI've been craving for a week and this\nfeels so good and then your brain is\nlike yeah let's do it again let's this\nis this is great so the worst thing that\nyou can do if you are dieting is to\ncrack within one week the more that you\ncrack within one week the harder and\nharder and harder it will be to diet\nthere's even some really fascinating\nstudies around something called the\nObesity set point and this is what's\nreally scary is if you're doing this is\nwhy you should never do crash diets so a\nlot of people will be like oh my God I\nhave a wedding coming up I'm going to do\na crash diet I'm going to wait lose some\nweight crash diets are bad for your\nlong-term health and here's the reason\nwhy there's something called the Obesity\nset point so we have a weight set point\nso our body has a weight that it likes\nto sit at this is why most people don't\nfluctuate weight right you sort of have\nthis like seminormal weight it may go up\na couple pounds every few years but\ngenerally speaking you have like a\nweight that is set and what our body\ndoes is it says okay this is our healthy\nweight it's let's say it's like 140 PBS\nokay so if we've got a weight of 140 PBS\nour if we eat more than that like if we\neat a ton of calories our body will feel\nless hungry and if we eat less than that\nour body will feel more hungry it tries\nto stay at 140 pounds\nnow what happens when you crash diet\nwhen you crash diet you induce a period\nof starvation and then when the crash\ndiet ends you eat again so now what is\nthe lesson that you're teaching your\nbody you're teaching your body that\nthere are periods of\nfamine right there's a period of time\nwhere we're only going to get 1,200\ncalories instead of our usual 2,000 if\nyou were a body and you are trying to\nsurvive periods of famine what are you\ngoing to do you're going to fatten up\nafter the famine disappears our body is\nlike oh crap there was famine so if we\nstay at 140 lbs we will not be able to\nsurvive the next one so we're going to\nincrease our set point to 150 lbs\ntherefore we can survive the next famine\nso now what happens is we feel hungrier\nour weight goes up to 150 and then what\ndo we do we're like oh [ __ ] now I weigh\n150 pounds time to crash diet again and\nso now you have to crash diet even\nharder because you need to lose 10\npounds and then if you crack it all you\ncrash diet for a while you drop back\ndown to 135 you're like woo and then you\nstart eating again cuz the crash diet is\nover and then our body is like oh my God\nthis is a second period of famine last\ntime we only lost 5 pounds but this time\nwe lost 15 PBS it adjusts the set point\nhigher it makes you crave more because\nit's trying to keep you\nalive it's like bro girl there's famine\nwe need to fatten up to survive these\nWinters and the more you do it the more\nit\nchanges now let me try to find a\nreference does that make\nsense we don't understand this right so\nhere we are trying to adopt a certain\nweight let me see if I can find\nthis I have a paper here somewhere I\nhave a physical copy nope okay let me\nfind it\nnot giving up yet\nchat is my gut bacteria related to why I\nbingel lot very possibly almost\ncertainly I think this is the\njournal\nokay um I I think this may be the\noriginal paper that I was talking about\nso let's just take a quick look at\nthis okay so here we've got a paper on\nthe role of set point Theory so this is\nI think like\nuh basically like there's a bunch of\nstuff that regulates food intake and\nthere's also if we look at um what is\nit uh dieting and set point\nweight Theory let's see if we can find\nsomething here\num yeah I think this is older stuff so I\nthink these papers are like from the\n90s um and yall should really look at\nlook at this stuff it's fascinating\ncookie settings no\nno let's see if we can find this article\nN I don't know so y'all should really oh\nlet's do\nWikipedia there we go\nwell so like there there's a lot of good\nstuff here about set point Theory it's\nreally fascinating but the key thing to\nunderstand about setpoint\ntheory is that our body is just trying\nto survive and it doesn't understand\nright so you have to think about what\nyou create in your body and what the\nbody thinks is going on and so when we\ngo on a diet our body thinks that\nthere's\nfamine it doesn't understand and this is\nwhy a lot of healthy dieting if you want\nto it's not dieting so this is the other\nproblem is I think I think dieting is\nstupid dieting is one of the worst\nthings that you can do because dieting\nis like oh I'm on a diet right now which\nmeans that at some point you're going to\nstop and you're going to start all this\nyou're going to confuse your body right\nso if you diet for a while I'm\ndieting I'm cutting out this kind of\nthing for now because I want to achieve\nthis kind of weight loss when you do\nthis sort of thing you confuse your body\nbecause your body's like oh [ __ ] there's\na famine and so when you start eating\nagain your body's like oh my God we've\nlost weight because there's a famine\nthen when we start eating again we we\nneed to gain it back we got to get past\nthis period of famine right it's kind of\ncrazy so you lose 5 pounds and your\nbody's like oh [ __ ] there's no food and\nthen when you get food again it's like\nwe better move up 15 pounds so that we\ncan account for the next famine so the\nmore that you diet the more yo-yoing\nyou're you're going to get which is why\ndieting is so hard and which is also why\nthere is a dieting\nindustry see the only reason you can\nhave an industry is if the solutions\ndon't\nwork yall get that so if if the problem\nis solved right there's not like an\nantibiotic industry antibiotics work we\nprescribe them when you need them and\nthen the problem is fixed right\nantibiotics are are a terrible\ninvestment for drug companies because\nyou don't have lifelong patients because\nthey fix the problem but the dieting\nindustry works really well because their\nfundamental mechanisms do not harness\nbiology they go against biology so you\ninduce some kind of weight loss people\nfeel good about themselves they think\nthat there is a win and then they end up\nrebounding this is why dieting is stupid\nwhat is good is eating\nhealthy this is not a temporary change\nthis is a permanent change a permanent\nchange to the way that you eat now it\ndoesn't have to be on a daily basis but\ndoing simple things like okay I'm going\nto cut out 90% of my soda for carbonated\nwater this this is one of the things\nthat I did many many years ago which I\nthink is probably good for me right or\neven simple water so cutting out a\nparticular beverage reducing your\nalcohol consumption I'm not saying don't\never drink again what I'm saying is stop\nhaving a beer with things or even stop\nhaving soda with your food these are\npermanent changes that we're going to\nmake and the way to eat healthy is to\ndecide okay these are things that I'm\ncomfortable with this change this is not\nsomething that requires willpower so if\nit requires willpower that means that as\nmy willpower fluctuates and as my life\nbecomes stressful I have less of it\nwhich means that things are going to\nfall apart at some point this is what\nthe dieting industry relies on you got\nto work really hard you got to have a\nton of willpower and then one day your\nwillpower is going to fail you're going\nto rebound but then what's going to\nhappen when you rebound you lost the\nweight with us once so you're going to\ncome\nback this is also the business model of\na lot of drug rehabs by the way is yeah\nyou felt so good and sober when you were\nwith us and then we're going to send you\nback home home and by the way when\nyou're here for 30 days and you're out\non the beach and doing yoga and getting\nmassages and all this kind of crap then\nwhat happens we send you back and then\nthere's alcohol there and who knew after\na few weeks you relapsed or a few months\nyou relapsed and then you have such a\npositive association with the rehab\nfacility that you go back so some rehabs\nout there are actually based on repeat\ncustomers because their interventions\ndon't work or they work for some amount\nof\ntime dieting is the same way so what you\nyou want to do is make changes that you\ncan live with this is the key thing so\nI'll give you all a very simple\nexample I used to love and I still love\ngrilled cheese\nsandwiches and grilled cheese sandwiches\nare delicious get that butter on there\nright put that bread on there put that\ncheese on there put another piece of\nbread on top pick that up butter the pan\nagain before you flip it you get that\nnice crisp golden like crispiness you\nknow the crispiness on the outside the\nsoftness of the bread and the melted\ncheese in the\nmiddle so I was trying to figure out how\ncan I eat healthier so what I started\ndoing very simple very simple thing if\nyou guys want to know how to eat a\nhealthy version of a grilled cheese so\nyou take a slice of bread put butter cuz\nwe're not giving up butter screw this\nlike olive oil Camp no no no we're going\nto use butter right nice good butter put\na slice of bread on there put cheese on\ntop and then don't put the second slice\nof bread on\ntop no butter no second slice then what\nyou do is you flip that [ __ ] over and\nyou may think oh my God Dr K you mean\nput cheese directly on the pan you're\ndamn right I put cheese directly on the\npan the cheese becomes\ndelicious it gets like crispy you get a\nnice monster or cheddar and doesn't it\nmelt all over the place no it actually\nlike so it'll start to melt and then\nit'll crisp up and it'll hold and now\nyou basically have an Open Face Sandwich\nand since you're actually I don't know\nif it's the myard reaction or whatever I\ndon't know if that happen with cheese\nbut something happens with cooked cheese\ncooked cheese is\namazing and then what's happened is I\nhaven't sacrificed butter I haven't\nsacrificed cheese and I haven't\nsacrificed bread I've just changed it a\nlittle bit and even then the cheese is\nactually tastier when you when you grill\nit\ndirectly and then what I tend to do is I\nput some stuff on top so I'll add a\nlittle bit of like spinach or arugula\nmaybe some tomato some hot sauce you can\nsauce that stuff up and now I have this\nother version of a grilled cheese this\nis what I eat now instead of grilled\ncheese and it tastes just as good it's\nlike it's not unsatisfying at\nall and so this is this is the way that\nwe should be dieting right it's not\ndieting it's not like a temporary thing\nthat you do it's alter your\ndiet grilled cheese sandwich with crispy\ncheese on both sides it's just on one\nside but yeah it's like it's not even a\nsandwich anymore it's like an Open Face\nSandwich which I think is not a sandwich\nit's a slice of bread with [ __ ] on\ntop yeah so Europe grilled cheese means\nactual cheesee grilled not a not a\nsandwich yeah so I think like if you\nlook at some of these cultures that have\nthings like halumi right oh my God\nhalumi is\ndelicious some vegetables actually make\nit better I completely agree so here's\nthe other thing I like about my version\nof grilled\ncheese so when I normally eat a regular\ngrilled cheese that has two slices of\nbread cheese in the middle and butter on\nboth sides one is Never\nEnough okay I can I can stomach too but\nI feel awful at the end of it like if\nyou eat two grilled cheese sandwiches\nit's too\nmuch one is clearly not enough and half\na grilled cheese sandwich like one and a\nhalf is like a little bit depressing you\nknow what I mean it's like a little bit\ndepressing like you can't just do like\nit's like you want a little bit more\nthan half but a whole one is too much\nthe beautiful thing about these\nsandwiches is when i e two of them is I\nhave two I feel full at the end but it's\nnot heavy because half of it is like\nspinach and tomatoes with like hot sauce\nraw onions I actually really like on\nthere too\nright and it's a tarene\nyeah so like here's the thing when when\nwhen I when I think about eating healthy\nif you guys want to know what the\nhealthy gamer diet is the healthy gamer\ndiet is not eating healthy it's eating\nhealthier it's like let's just let's\njust remove one slice of bread and a\nlittle bit of butter and you can eat two\nof them and then that's really all we\nneed to do so it's it's all about making\nsustainable changes changes that you\ndon't have to work really hard to\ndo get what I'm saying cooking some yeah\nwe we actually owe y'all a Thor stream\nfrom like two years ago which we're\nworking\non the thandor is 800 pound for those of\nyou all that don't know and I just got\nit\ndelivered so we're I'll we'll work on it\nyeah so when people saying Europeans are\nthinner I think there's more to it than\nthat I think in and I mean they have\ntrains and they walk too so we here in\nthe United States drive and have parking\nlots does drinking smoothies filled with\nfrozen fruits and veg have the the same\nnutritional benefits as eating them\nalmost certainly not doesn't mean that\nit isn't healthy to do but almost\ncertainly not so as Dr Uma said if you\nactually want optimal absorption uh what\nwas it of tryptophan you need to eat it\nwith complex carbohydrates so this is\nwhere there's a lot of interesting\nscience about\nabsorption and so there are some things\nthat for example like eating fruits and\ndairy together according to ayurveda is\nactually suboptimal absorption and if\nyou guys really want to understand this\nthere's a very simple scientific\nprinciple so when I eat different kinds\nof\nmacronutrients okay so if I eat\nsomething like a carbohydrate a\nfat and a protein all at the same time\nthis may tastes really good but what's\ngoing on in my stomach so what goes on\nin my stomach is I have different\nenzymes that digest each thing so for a\ncarbohydrate let's say I'm using amas\nwhich breaks down carbs\nfor a fat I'm using a lipase and for a\nprotein I'm using a protease but often\ntimes it's just you know the acidic\nenvironment proteas protein digestion is\na little bit different but if we're\nsimplifying it let's say we have amas\nlipase and proteas now let's say I'm\neating a carbohydrate a fat and a\nprotein all together so what happens is\nI have three molecules of food and I\nhave three molecules of enzyme they all\nget dumped into my stomach and my\nstomach\nturns so if you sort of think about it\nwhat is the likelihood that the amas\nbumps into the carbohydrate it's one out\nof three right what's the likelihood\nthat a lipase bumps into one of the\nother three it's one out of three so\nwhat that means is that my digestion a\nlot of enzymes are bumping into stuff\nthat they can't\ndigest so if you sort of think about\nwhat's the opposite scenario let's say\nthat I just have carbohydrate that I'm\neating by itself and only Amala then my\ndigestion is 100% sufficient\nI mean uh efficient now people may say\nbut people eat this all the time and\ndigestion is fine yeah because our\nbody's really good but if you guys want\nthere's a very simple experiment that\nyou can do to experience optimal\ndigestion and that is eat some kind of\ncarbohydrate by itself with nothing so\nif you take a slice of bread and you\njust eat the slice of bread what you\nwill notice chew like for 30 seconds\nwhat you will notice is the change of\nthe bread the Taste of the bread changes\nover the course of the 30\nseconds so if I have a slice of bread\nit's going to taste like regular bread\nbut by the end of the 30 seconds I will\ntaste sugar I will taste sweetness by\nthe end of the 30 seconds and that's\nbecause the amas is operating very\nefficiently now you take that same slice\nof bread and you add a piece of cheese\nto it okay bite number one is just bread\nbite number two is bread and cheese or\nyou add ham to it or whatever you want\nyou add hummus to it add\nsomething and then what you will notice\nis that after 30 seconds the bread does\nnot taste the same very simple the amas\nmeets 100% of the bread it will digest\nit when it eats 50% of meets 50% of the\ncheese it will it will not work in the\nsame\nway very very very simple test that you\ncan do so these very simple principles\nof digestion we've lost sight of and we\ncome up with things like smoothies which\nare combining all kinds of ingredients\nwhich are not normally designed to be\neaten together right so let's think\nabout it from an evolutionary\nperspective we as humans are hunter\ngatherers and maybe we have some\nlivestock so I've got a cow at home\nmaybe right we're not actually even\nsupposed to have dairy\nevolutionarily but generally speaking\nwhen we're a hunter gatherer Society\nsometimes we'll have meals but we don't\noften times mix Foods it's like I'm\ngoing out and I find a blueberry patch\nI'm going to just eat a bunch of\nblueberries later I'll go out hunting\nand I find something I I hunt some or I\ngo fishing and I get a fish and I just\neat the fish so we actually don't\ncombine Foods that's how our digestion\nis it's not designed to eat multiple\nthings at the same\ntime yes salivary enzymes have amas yes\nthat's what I'm saying is there's amas\nin in your mouth that's why I'm using\nthe example of a carbohydrate doesn't\nwork with a protein because proteas is\nin here it's in your\ngut so let's talk about ideal versus not\nideal so why are smoothies healthy for\nyou even though they are not ideal so if\nthe problem in my\ndiet is that I'm deficient with\nsomething I'm not getting enough\nfiber the value of adding a cup of\nspinach to my smoothie even if it leads\nto suboptimal\ndigestion is worth it so even though my\ndigestion is suboptimal the fact that\nI'm getting one serving of fiber on\nbalance improves my health overall so\nthe more you optimize you don't need to\noptimize digestion until you're eating\nhealthy if you're eating unhealthy\nforget about optimizing your digestion\njust get your basic macronutrients in so\nthe other way to kind of think about it\nis let's say I'm climbing MMR in a video\ngame and I can look at Pro players who\ndo all these different kinds of\ntechniques if I'm like iron tier or\nbronze tier or whatever I don't need to\nbe doing Platinum level plays I just\nneed to be doing bronze level plays\nthat's all I need to do to climb and the\nhigher I climb the more sophisticated I\nneed to be diet is the same way right so\nI play moas and so I like this game\ncalled Dota 2 and in Dota 2 like I'm a\n[ __ ] tier MMR I don't need to be playing\nsome some Pro level play I just need to\ndo the basics right and that's diet is\nthe same way so you guys don't need to\nworry about all this complicated I mean\nI think you all should learn this stuff\nbecause it's cool and hopefully stuff\nlike that but that's why it's it's\nhealthy to do unhealthy things even this\nis why we have\nuh uh you know dietary supplementation\npeople take supplements there's a ton of\nevidence that show that supplements\ndon't really\nwork the supplement industry doesn't\nwant you understanding that why because\na supplement doesn't fix a problem\nthey're saying hey like you need to take\nthis every single day right there's some\nevidence that shows that supplements can\nbe helpful so there's you know isolated\nthings like we know that for example\nomega-3 even things like some of these\nherbs like ashwagandha St John's W\nthere's some data behind it but this\nidea that you need to take a\nmultivitamin every day is like not very\ngood vitamin D supplementation\nsure so I'm not saying that the\nsupplements are bad there's absolutely\ngood therapeutic uses or nutritional\nuses health uses for\nsupplements but the main thing is that\ny'all don't need to be doing like 5,000\nMMR players plays when y'all are at\n1,000 MMR just focus on the basics\nthat's where you need to\nstart and this is also where like a lot\nof people don't understand this about\nmeditation so everyone you know there\nthere's two camps of people with\nmeditation there's all these weird like\nspiritual people who are like oh my God\nmeditation can solve this and can do\nthis and you would have an experience of\nuniverse and all these psychedelic\nexperiences in\nmeditation and they say here's the\ntechnique to have a psychedelic\nexperience in meditation you go and you\ndo that technique and it doesn't\nwork why that's because you're not at\nthat level so the people who have these\npsychedelically induced experiences in\nmeditation have very very careful diets\nso they have very very low levels of\ninflammation in their body they even\nwill have I suspect sex hormone\ndeficiencies which is critical for\nprogress in meditation this is why\neveryone is celibate when they're monks\nso they'll even eat certain diets that I\nsuspect reduce your testosterone level\nthere's even an ASA called sidas which\nis called adeps pose it's the basic pose\nthat if you're if you want to be a\nspiritual aspirant you do this pose and\nin sidas you place the heel of your left\nfoot against your perenium the area\nbetween your scrotum and your anus and\nwhen you press that with your heel and\nyou sit in this posture for eight or\nnine hours a day what is in that place\ndoes anybody know what flows through the\nperenium the taint as it were so what\nflows through there is the blood vessels\nto your\ntestes you don't sit on the testicles\nit's the area underneath the testicles I\nwould show you a picture but then I'd\nget\nbanned okay so it's the area between\nyour balls and your butthole if you're a\ndude and so when we press on that spot\nthat's where the blood vessels to our\ntesticles are so we slowly reduce the\nblood flow to our testicles when you do\nthat for a year or two\nyears I imagine that the test testes\nstart to atrophy as the testes start to\natrophy your testosterone level goes\ngoes down your aggression level goes\ndown your horniness level goes down all\nthat kind of stuff so I suspect that\nthere's physiologic I don't know if\nthere's scientific studies but you can\njust look at in an anatomy text and you\ncan kind of put two and two together\nwhen I press on this part of my body\nlike what's going to happen I'm going to\ncompress whatever the [ __ ] is\nthere okay and that's why sidas is not\ntaught to everybody we've never taught\ny'all sidas because when we use yoga and\nmeditation we're not trying to turn yall\nwe're not trying to give induce some\ntransient level minor level of\ntesticular testosterone deficiency\nthat's not our goal right you guys want\nmore testosterone how do I be mly how do\nI be Chad so all of these things have\nsubtle subtle effects on the body we\njust don't know\nit but does low testosterone equal low\nsex drive what a great question we will\ntalk about that next week when we are\ndoing a deep dive into\nasexuality\nbut generally speaking yes but low sex\ndrive can be caused by other things this\nis the main thing that we don't\nunderstand or many people don't\nunderstand low sex drive has a\ndifferential diagnosis it can be caused\nby all kinds of things not just\ntestosterone deficiency so low levels of\ntestosterone is one of the causes of low\nsex drive but another cause of low sex\ndrive is trauma another cause of low sex\ndrive is insufficient sleep another\ncause of low sex Drive is\nlike not being happy in life low levels\nof mood or anxiety or high levels of\ncortisol stress these are all causes of\nof low sex drive but what do we do in\nsociety we think oh my God my my sex\ndrive is low let me boost my\ntestosterone because that is something I\ncan fix I can take a pill or an\ninjection it'll fix my problem so\ninstead of addressing my why my mood is\nlow why my anxiety is low why all of\nthese other things are wrong in my life\nwhy I'm not sleeping well I'm going to\ngo out there and I'm going to take a\ntestosterone pill that'll artificially\njack up my testosterone then I'll feel\nhorny and I'll feel like a man but then\nthis is what's wrong with Society we\nlook at this so you guys have to\nunderstand this our society is getting\nsicker and sicker and sicker despite the\nfact that we have more and more and more\ntools at our\ndisposal Neuroscience is an all-time\nhigh we understand so much about gut\nmicrobiome and we're doing fmri studies\nand we know so much about all these\ndifferent like chemical compounds and\nlike herb that will boost our\ntestosterone level we're taking all this\ncrap\nwhy why do we need it in the first place\nbecause Society is getting sicker why is\nsociety getting sicker because when we\nhave a problem instead of fixing the\nroot we take a\nsupplement so the more answers we have\nfor our\nproblems the worse we're getting because\nnow I'm going to fix this over here I'm\ngoing to take an app over here I'm going\nto do this over here I'm going to do\nthis over here I'm going to do all these\ndifferent things instead of fixing the\nfundamental which is sleeping 8 to 9\nhours a\nday just\nsleep most of your problems will get\nbetter the One symptom that basically\nevery mental illness axis one mental\nillness\nshares is disturb sleep anxiety disturbs\nsleep depression disturb sleep\nschizophrenia disturb sleep panic\nattacks disturb sleep PTSD disturbs\nsleep so if you sleep well your mind has\na chance to fix\nitself\nright and so but why don't we have why\ndon't we work on sleep y'all because\nit's complicated because it's way harder\nthan simply taking a pill right or\nsometimes and this is why sleep\nmedication works so well cuz hey someone\ninvented a pill that helps you\nsleep so we we have these kinds of\nmedications right these um these\nderivatives of benzo diip Pines like\nambian but what you know the really\ninteresting thing is that it only\nincreases sleep by about 15 to 30\nminutes when you take it it's all it\ndoes to your sleep what it changes is\nour perception of\nsleep there's another thing that a lot\nof people don't realize when you say you\nsleep you don't I only slept 4 hours a\nnight that's all almost certainly not\ntrue so when you take a bunch of people\nwhat we sort of discover is that if you\nmeasure your sleep in a sleep lab you're\nsleeping like 6 to8 hours even if you\nthink you're sleeping 2 to four but your\nperception of sleep is way off the\naverage human being has a huge sleep\nmisperception\nproblem because how do you know how many\nhours you slept you're not aware when\nyou're\nsleeping so then you think to yourself\nbut I'm aware when I'm awake but how\ndoes your mind calculate how long you've\nbeen awake it is actually based on\ninternal signals of\nfatigue so you think you slept a certain\namount based on how you feel when you\nwake\nup so someone's asking about pads and\nstuff like that to help you lower your\nbody temperature I think actually that\nstuff is pretty good right so there's so\nI think things like weighted blankets\nare actually like very good\ninterventions what's even better than a\nweighted blanket is to like cuddle with\nsomething right so part part of if we\nthink about what is why does a weighted\nblanket help us sleep what's the\nmechanism of action of a weighted\nblanket the mechanism of the ACT\nmechanism of action is that why does\nweight on top of us help us sleep\nbecause what is what is the biology what\nwhat was the\nexperience that we had as human beings\nas we Evol evolved that allowed us to\nsleep more comfortably when there's\nweight on top of us think about this for\na\nsecond right what do you all think it\nis where did our body learn that oh it's\ngood to sleep now that there's weight on\ntop of\nme\nright and that's the thing it's like\nsleeping with other human beings or\nanimals and even if we look at the\nweight of a weighted blanket so there\nare basically two or three weights of\nweighted blankets that work well it's\nlike 10 lb it's not 50 lb and what\nweighs about 10 lb when you have another\nhuman being sleeping next to you and\nthey put their arm around you the\nfeeling that you feel of their arm and\nshoulder and stuff like that I weigh\nabout 130 lb this right here weighs 10\nto 20\nlbs so it's the feeling of approximation\nof something like an arm or a\nleg so weighted blankets are the bi\nology that makes us makes weighted\nblankets effective is essentially\ncuddling with other human beings or\npotentially\nanimals and this biology is not just\nhuman beings it's also animals it's like\nif you've got a cat where does the cat\nlike to sleep I'm going to come and\nsleep on top of you so there are warmth\nsignals there are weight signals and now\nwhat's happened in our society is that\nwe don't like sleeping with each\nother and as we've gotten worse at\nsleeping with each other we've started\nto use weighted blankets\nand now we have these like waifu\npillows right that's another thing like\nso that the Contour of that pillow in\nthe shape approximates a human form and\nwe look at these people and we think oh\nmy God this person is such a loser for\nusing this kind of pillow they're not a\nloser we've just created a society where\nthis person cannot get human\ncontact and we call them a loser for\nit this person has no human\ncontact and there's also other stuff\nwhich I'm kind of riffing here but if\nyou think about safety right and here's\nthe thing if you look at\nkids unless you sleep train a kid a kid\nis going to want to sleep with you until\nthey're teenagers that's what's\nbiologically\nnormal right so all the sleep training\nis like a movement away from our\nbiology because what does safety feel\nlike to a kid a kid even a one-year-old\nfeels safe when they're with their\nparents that's hardwired even a\nfour-year-old feels slave when you'll\nnotice this if you have children that\nthey get yet cuddlier the worst they\nfeel they need that physical contact\nthat's how they know that they're\nsafe and so when we have a society of\npeople that is\ntraumatized they need human contact and\nthis is why people with a history of\ntrauma end up in unhealthy sexual\nrelationships because they don't know\nhow to feel safe they don't know how to\nengage with someone else and I've seen\nthis especially with my my female\npatients where they'll end up having\nunhealthy sex and why because that's the\nonly way that they can get\ntouch and their body is hungry for\nsomething and they can't feel safe\nexcept when they're in the arms of\nsomeone\nelse when that happens as an adult is\nthat\nregression so when we're hungry for\nanother human being's touch when we're\nadult it's not\nregression it is actually\nstalling so if you look at the science\nof trauma we don't regress I mean\nsometimes it's regression but generally\nspeaking it's not regression it's that\nwe get stuck at that phase because we\nnever get\nit so if you have some if you're looking\naround at other people around you and\nyou say to yourself oh my God my peers\nare capable of all of this I am not if\nyou feel\nbehind the reason you're behind is not\nbecause you're regressing it's because\nyou stalled and this is literally how\nour brain develops so if we look at the\nscience of cognitive\ndevelopment we don't move on to the next\nstage until we fix stage number one so\nif a child is\nneglected and never touched or never\nheld when they're growing up they stall\ntheir cognitive development you don't go\nto level three four 5 six and seven if\nyou never beat level two you stay stuck\nat level two and this is why we get\nimmature adults we look at them we're\nlike this person is so immature why are\nthey immature it's because they were\nnever allowed to mature why are you\nmature you didn't do anything for it if\nyou were loved as a child if you felt\nsafe as a child you feel like the world\nis a good place right so let's like dig\ninto this for a\nsecond why is one human being confident\nyou look at all these other people who\nare like the same age as you and they\nlike they're confident and I'm not\nconfident why is that it's because when\nthey were growing up they were taught\nthat the world is a safe place that's\nwhere confidence comes from the safer\nthe world is the more confident you can\nbe\nwhy do I prance around naked in the\nconfines of my own home because I feel\nsafe why don't I prance around naked on\nthe\ninternet because I haven't started my\nonly fans\nyet you have to pay for\nit so when a human being feels safe they\ndevelop\nconfidence and when we live in a society\nor when we grow up in an environment\nwhere when bad things happen to us if\nthere is not a loving caring figure to\nput the world back together then the\nworld becomes an unsafe place so I'll\ngive you all just a really simple\nexample of this so let's say I grow up\nin an environment where I get yelled at\nfor\ncrying very common shockingly\ncommon right so your parent yells at you\nwhen you're crying now this is very\nconfusing for a child because normally\nwhat is crying what is crying crying is\na signal for\nhelp and a heal hey child cries parent\ncomes oh are you okay little baby and\nthen child stops crying this is called\nsecure\nattachment so if you look at kids if you\nwant to see whether a kid is securely\nattached see how long it takes for them\nto stop crying once someone shows up and\nsecurely attached kids will take less\nthan 5 Seconds they can be having L\ncrying eyes and buckets and buckets of\ntears and then you pick them up within 5\nSeconds they stop crying this is a\nsecure attachment because they okay now\nthe world was scary and now someone has\nshown up and now they feel safe now I\nfeel safe\nokay when the world is a dangerous place\nI can do something to make it safe I can\ncry and when my crying works okay now I\ncan affect change in the outside world\nit is not something to be\nfeared this is where confidence comes\nfrom oh you have a setback no problem I\ncan do something to fix\nit this is what confident people are\nlike these [ __ ] that are confident\nthey have a setback and they're like no\nproblem I got\nthis and why aren't you like that\nbecause when you cried you got yelled at\nso let's understand how this affects\nyou I need help let me try to do\nsomething to improve my circumstances\nand you get yelled at holy crap I tried\nto do something to fix the problem and\nit made the problem\nworse now if you grow up with a brain\nwhere when you try to fix something it\nmakes the problem worse what do you\nthink ends up\nhappening you stop trying to fix\nproblems because when you try to fix it\nit only makes it worse sound familiar\nand now we wonder why are we not\nmotivated oh my God I have so many\nproblems in my life I don't know I don't\nknow why I don't do something to fix\nthem and then you feel\npathetic the reason that you don't do\nanything to fix your problems is because\nearly on you\nlearned that fix fixing your problems is\na waste of effort this is why people are\nnot motivated it's not your fault you're\na smart kid you learned it was a waste\nof\ntime right because we're human we're not\ndogs that bark at the Moon because dogs\nin that way are not as intelligent as we\nare so they continue to Bark at the Moon\nfutility is no problem for a dog but we\nas humans will learn that when I try to\ndo something it's not worth it and then\nwe lose all of our motivation\nthat is not a deficiency you're not\nbroken it's an\nadaptation this is why it's so\nhard it's not something wrong it's\nsomething right it's the way that you're\nwired yeah you can feel your back\nstarving with touch this is all like\nthis is the problem that we face today\nright so as our H as our society\nrequires less interaction with humans we\nbecome touch starved and we get\nsurprised oh my God everyone is touch\nstarved why because we don't need other\npeople anymore except this is the one\nthing that we need other people\nfor right so I can get sexually aroused\nto something like pornography there are\nassistive devices for orgasm but there's\nno substitute for human touch that we've\ndiscovered\nyet having a pet comes close right so\nyou can there's good outcomes in terms\nof mortality and cardiovascular disease\nand things like that for having a\npet can we cultivate that safety on our\nown it's really\nhard it's possible but it's very\nhard right so that's kind of like I mean\nthere's a lot of stuff you can do on\nyour own but we as human beings were not\ndesigned as solo creatures so the way\nthat we get shaped is through\ninteractions so the body pillow is not\nan effective substitute I would say it\nis a partial substitute so this is what\nstarted to happen is we've started to\ntry to figure out how to trick our\nbrains into being\nsatisfied right instead of achievement\nin the outside world I'm going to get\nachievement in a video game and that\nscratches the hge\n50% instead of being proud of who I am\nin the real world I'm going to be proud\nof who I am in the video game that on\nsocial media that scratches the H\n50% and we've worked with hundreds\nliterally 500 content creators at this\npoint and what we find is that the\nidentity that they develop from content\ncreation is like a shadow of a real\nidentity because they cre construct this\npersona\nand so we we're we're going about trying\nto fill our\nneeds without doing the thing that fills\nthem we try to find some kind of\nsubstitute that is easier because the\nactual way to fill our needs is hard or\neven\nimpossible do you know why touch\nstarvation is going to be the biggest\nsource of product development in the\nhistory of\nhumanity touch salvation is the biggest\nOPP capitalistic opportunity on the\nplanet people who fix touch salvation\nwill be rich beyond\nbelief and the reason is because touch\nstarvation is the one product that you\ncan fill that requires another human\nbeing to actually fix it's the one thing\nyou can sell to someone else that unless\nthey buy your thing they have to rely on\nthe kindness of another human\nbeing\nso all of these attempts to self-help\ntouch starvation when fundamentally it's\nnever going to be solved you're going to\ncreate the best customer base on the\nplanet so get into the the touch\nstarvation Market early I\nmean I think we're already late I saw\nsomething about Elon Musk making AI\nrobots I don't know if that's real or\nnot\nright but\nlike so I don't know I I don't know what\nto make of this stuff I I don't know how\nmuch of this is like an unfair Shake\nThat Elon is getting or what's going\non but I mean I think there's a reason\nwhy this is happening and it's not just\nthis\nright like everyone's building robots\nand AIS and we want a substitute for\nhumans\nand the more we substitute for\nhumans those things will sell because\nwe're getting lonely but we're not\nfixing the\nproblem we're trying to create a\nsolution to the fundamental problem of\ntouch starvation is for people to touch\neach\nother with consent don't go out there\nand be\nlike right it's it's like I mean this is\nit's not a hard problem to solve it's\nimpossible I mean in a sense it's very\nsimple but it's not easy that's what I\nshould say cuz touch starvation is not a\nproblem you can fix for yourself but\nit's something that you can fix for\nsomeone\nelse and the biggest problem in our\nsociety today is that we have started to\nassume that if I have a problem I have\nto fix\nit because I can't rely on other people\nvery\ndangerous right but life is a\nmultiplayer game it's not a single\nplayer\ngame\nso rambro is asking tutorial on how to\nfind one once again there you are trying\nto fix the problem for yourself so I\nwould say that's the wrong tutorial not\nwrong I'll work on it okay my promise to\nyou rambro I'll work on it see if I can\ncome up with\nsomething but here's what I will say to\ny'all is that you saying how tutorial on\nhow to find someone I don't know exactly\nwhat you mean by that but what I will\nsay is instead think about how you can\nbe that person for someone\nelse\nthat's the fundamental shift we need in\nour society see we're all always looking\nto find our own needs\nmet everything about our direction of\nour society comes from an overreliance\non Independence I'm not saying\nIndependence is bad it's great in many\nways it's improved the world in many\nways but if we want to fix a lot of the\nproblems that exist in the world it's\nwhat can you do for someone else not\nwhat can you do for\nme and start to think about who in your\nlife you can enrich their lives in some\nway and that's what you should do and if\nevery person on the planet does that 90%\nof the world's problems will be\nsolved\ndone all we have to do is start thinking\nabout other\npeople so Black Vulcan X is saying I\ncan't be that kind of person fair enough\nso here's the crazy thing it's not your\nresponsibility to be that kind of person\nit is our\nresponsibility to fix that for you it is\nour responsibility to even if you cannot\ngive anything to us for us to give you\nsomething without expectation of return\nfor you to say okay so be it you can't\ndo it I'm going to offer a hug\nanyway that's what needs to happen right\nbecause how do you get to be that person\nhow do you where where how does a human\nbeing learn kindness they learn it from\nwhat they\nreceive I'm relying on others now we\nwe've all been relying on others from\nthe very beginning the only mistake that\nwe've made is we've duded ourselves into\nthinking that we don't need to rely on\nothers will regular masses save the day\nno half moia regular masses will not but\nyou\nwill you'll save the day we don't need\nregular masses all we need is\nyou we don't need we don't need everyone\nto save the day we just need you you'll\nbe\nenough you can change the\nworld and the the big scam is that we\ndelude ourselves into\nthinking that oh what I can do is not\nenough I can't save the world and\nthereby you deprive yourself of agency\nand you don't even try because it's not\ngoing to be\nenough see the biggest trick the Mind\never plays is convincing you that it\nwon't be enough the most dangerous\nthought in the mind is it's not\nenough so if you really stop and think\nabout\nit it's not\nenough is a\nmask that your mind wears when it\ndoesn't want to do something when it\nthinks that something is going to hurt\nyou it tells you it's not\nenough you have it's very subtle so\nanytime your mind tells you it won't be\ngood enough what does your mind actually\ntrying to do it's trying to protect you\nfrom\nPain oh I shouldn't study for this test\nwhy because it won't be enough you won't\nget an A and then you may ask yourself\nbut wait what is it trying to protect me\nfrom it's trying to protect me from a b\nbecause I want an a I need an\nA but if I get a b or if I get a c or if\nI get an f and I tried I'm going to be\nso devastated it so your mind tells you\nit won't be\nenough it won't be enough is a trick\nthat the Mind plays to reduce your\ndesire to\nact really\ninteresting so if you really want to fix\nyour life the most important thing to do\nis to do things that are not\nenough there's not been a single person\nthat I have ever worked with and I've\nworked with hundreds of people at this\npoint I was about to say thousands but\nlet's just say hundreds and play it\nsafe every single one that I have taught\nto do things that are not enough has\nsubstantially improved their\nlife if you can start doing the\ninsufficient your life will\nchange oh my God exercising for 20\nminutes is not going to be\nenough so I might as well not do do it\nyou're right if you want to get whatever\nthe [ __ ] your goal is you need to\nexercise for 90 minutes but do the thing\nthat is not\nenough see that's the problem is we all\nlook for the thing that'll work we need\nto start doing the things that won't be\nenough that won't work because the real\nsuccess comes not from the thing that\nworking or not working the real success\ncomes from the doing because this is the\ncrazy thing the only thing you can\ncontrol is the\ndoing\nright I can spend I can work really hard\nget a ton of money and buy a house and a\nhurricane could hit it tomorrow and dis\nmake the house disappear I can't control\nthat if I get paralyzed and I think to\nmyself oh my God how am I going to\nprotect my house from a hurricane and\nthen I wait to buy a house until I know\nI it has hurricane shielding then I'm\ngoing to go my whole life without ever\nbuying a house even if I can afford one\nand I can enjoy one and I can live\none off to brush your teeth is there you\ngo honestly Joe Nicole do things that\ndon't\nwork that's the story of my life when I\nstarted get living it\nproperly right even this this is a this\nis an exercise in futility oh my God\nthere's actually so there CDC this past\nweek released some kind of bulletin that\nthere's a teenage suicide crisis in the\nunit United States\ncrazy what can I do I can't fix a\nteenage suicide crisis so I'm going to\nshow up I'm going to we're going to talk\na little bit about the how artificial\nsweeteners actually help you gain cause\nyou to gain weight it's not enough to\nsolve this problem but we're going to\nwe're going to it's an exercise in\nfutility we're going to start living\nlives of\nfutility I strongly encourage you to\nlive a life of futility instead of a\nlife of\ninaction\nokay so I think we're at time for\ntoday\num thank youall very much for\ncoming uh on Monday we're doing a stream\nwith Dan Clancy that'll probably be over\non Twitch because he's CEO of twitch on\nFriday we're doing a deep dive into\nasexuality so yeah that'll be fun so\nwe're going to do like a 2hour like deep\ndive into asexuality so it'll probably\nbe about a 90-minute lecture followed by\n30 minutes of\nQ&A so we're going to understand\nasexuality where does it come from\nwhat's the differential diagnosis for it\nso if you feel like you're asexual does\nthat mean that you are\nasexual or what are the different\nreasons for it I think one of the\nbiggest tragedies around asexuality\nwhich on the one hand I'm really\ngrateful that we're becoming more\naccepting of people and whatever their\nsexual ual preferences on the flip side\nI think it's a little bit unfortunate\nbecause some people that I've worked\nwith who believe they are asexual have\nsome problem that is blocking their\nsexual feelings and then they're usually\nhappier if they can overcome that so\nwe're going to learn a little bit about\nhow on the one hand it probably is just\na normal variant of human biology or\npsychology and then on the other hand\nthere are some things that can\ncontribute to it like hormone\ndeficiencies and stuff like that and so\nas we kind of get into a deep dive\naround what are all the how does\nasexuality work where does sexual\nfeeling come from within the body the\nbrain the mind we'll also discover a\ncouple of really interesting things like\nthe overlap between neurod Divergence\nand asexuality which is somewhere\nbetween two and five times as likely if\nyou're on the autism spectrum and what\nis even the mechanism for that so even\nif you're on the autism spectrum and\nyou're interested in becoming less\nasexual what does the science tell us\nabout potential Avenues to do that if\nthat's a goal that you've\ngot so hopefully that'll help\nhelp and\nuh yeah so Violet Emerald is saying
