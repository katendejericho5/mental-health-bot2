    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why\ndudes have trouble getting second\n[Music]\ndates now the first thing we got to\nstart with is some disclaimers because\nnow Dr K is talking about dating oh my\nGod to be completely fair I have not\never made an online dating profile but\nthis video is born out of the dudes that\nI have helped who have struggled to get\nsecond dates and what we discovered is\nthat a lot of the common wisdom around\nhow to date is actually not wise at all\nit's crap on the internet and it's taken\nme a while to put together this video\nbecause I've literally been reading\nabout the nature of sexual attraction\nchemistry dating and this kind of stuff\nlooking at all of this research for\nabout a year and a half and I think I\nfinally figured something out that has\nbeen very helpful to some of the men\nthat I've worked with now the second\ndisclaimer is is this video only about\nmen a lot of the stuff in this video\napplies to actually everyone because\nwe're going to learn the science of\nAttraction and why human beings date\npeople who are not good for them right\nbecause if you're a dude out there and\nyou're like scratching your head and\nyou're like I don't understand I'm doing\neverything right I glowed myself up I\nwent to the gym I worked on myself\nbecause everybody said work on yourself\nand now I'm making more money I got\npromoted I did everything right and I\ncan get someone to go on one date with\nme but for some reason they always say\nyeah I think about you as more of a\nfriend so what is going on there right\nand here you are as a dude pulling your\nhair out because you can see that there\nare romantic Partners out there that are\nless suitable than you that seem to be\ngetting second dates all the time so\nwhat the hell is going on I want to take\na moment to thank the sponsor of today's\nvideo Babel Babel is the top language\nlearning app worldwide and I really love\nit because I'm actually learning Spanish\nafter I've been using it for about 2\nmonths so right now for example I'm\nlearning common conversational phrases\nthat I can string together to actually\nhave a conversation\nlike which means twice a week\nor which means three times a month and\nthat's what I really love about the app\nis they make learning very very easy and\naccessible and they use certain\nscientific methods that actually have\nyou being the most proficient in the\nshortest amount of time so I can't\nrecommend Babble enough and it's awesome\nthat they're giving us 60% off of their\nsubscription if you check out the link\nin the description below so thank you to\nbabble for keeping mental health content\non the internet free and actually\nteaching human beings how to communicate\nwith each other so a lot of this stuff\napplies more to men because this is the\nselection bias that I have but a lot of\nthese scientific principles apply to\nwomen as well I think for women though\nthe expectations around dating are\ncompletely different and come with their\nown set of challenges and a lot of the\nwomen that I've talked to have different\nproblems with dating usually involving\nthings like dickpics people being\ntwo-faced and all kinds of other stuff\nwhere like they seem really really nice\nuntil oh it turns out they're an\nso there's a different video that I'm\nmaking about that but today we're going\nto focus on these problems around second\ndates now if you a woman or non-binary\nperson and you struggle to get a second\ndate all this stuff will apply to you as\nwell so let's understand what's going on\nokay the first thing to understand is\nthat a lot of the common wisdom we have\naround dating is wrong it's not actually\nbased on any kind of science it's just\nthis is what people think works everyone\nis looking for a long-term partner I\nmean not everyone is looking for a\npartner a lot of people are like looking\nfor short-term kind of things but if we\nthink about a date a very common\nexperience that I see people having is\nthat people have a super high list of\nrequirements it's like I'm looking for\nthis I'm looking for this I'm looking\nfor this and there's this kind of this\nmentality that like okay if this person\ndoesn't fit my requirements it's not\nworth wasting my time right I should\nfilter all them out because out of the\nbillion people on the internet surely I\ncan find someone who checks these boxes\nso this is a problem for one very\nfundamental reason\nwhen human beings first interact the\ninitial chemistry and what we kind of\ntalk about chemistry versus friend zone\nor short-term or long-term or whatever\nthe chemistry that we experience has\nnothing to do with long-term mating\nprospects selecting a long-term mate has\na different set of requirements and\ndifferent stuff going on to the in the\nbrain than someone who we think is hot\nwe know we shouldn't be dating and we're\nnot even sure because our friends are\nkind of telling us hey they're not even\nthat hot but for some reason we can't\nget them out of our mind we are going to\nteach you about why that happens okay so\nthe first problem is that modern dating\nconfuses shortterm attraction with\nlong-term kind of mating prospects and\nthis is where a lot of people like\npickup artists and red pillars will kind\nof come in we'll say like oh you should\ndo this like you should insult her man\nand if you insult it's negging if you\ninsult her then you'll show her that you\nare more valuable to her and then she'll\nlike you the reason that crap works is\nbecause some people out there have been\ntraumatized and have low self-esteem\nand when you play into their trauma and\nemotionally manipulate them they may be\nwilling to engage with you further but\nit doesn't work on everyone it works on\na subset of people who've been\ntraumatized so a lot of this common\nwisdom is actually off okay so the first\nthing that you should do when you go on\na date is do not talk about your\ninterests don't try to see if yall are a\ngood match don't try to see if you guys\nlike all the same things I know it\nsounds absolutely insane but if you\nreally pay attention to the case studies\nand think about the people in your life\nwhen you got super into someone you may\nbe like yeah we kind of have all the\nsame interest like sometimes that's sort\nof the case but often times we find\nourselves attracted to people who are\nnot like the opposite version of our I\nmean the the opposite gender version of\nourselves right assuming a heterosexual\nrelationship so it's not it's not like\nthe person that I find the most\nattractive is the person that is a\nfemale version of Dr K like it doesn't\nwork like that in fact my wife and I are\nlike completely different we're at\nopposite ends of the Spectrum in so many\ndifferent ways and we just couldn't get\neach other out of our heads so we're\ngoing to teach you how to do that so\nnumber one Pitfall to avoid don't talk\nabout your interests let's understand\nwhy so one of the things that we know\nabout creating chemistry or sexual\nattraction okay because there's studies\non sexual attraction too is that shared\nemotional experiences lead to attraction\nokay so this is a huge problem in rehab\nso if you have ever been to rehab if you\never worked at rehab you know that we\nhave one problem is doctors and rehab or\nnurses or whoever we try to keep\npatients from all the patients\nall they want to do all the time rehab\nis like honestly if you know what\nI'm talking about you know what I'm\ntalking about and the question is why\nwhy on Earth are all of these people\nwhen they are when they're withdrawing\nfrom substances when they're like in the\nprocess of putting their life together\nwhich is an absolute shambles all they\ncan think about is and it turns\nout that when you share an emotional\nexperience with someone that lead leads\nto a sense of chemistry Bond and even\nsexual attraction this is why like you\nknow if you you'll hear this story a lot\nfor example like yeah you know like this\nperson's partner passed away from cancer\nand there was someone else who is there\nfor them and they both grieved together\nand then they fell in love right so we\nknow from science that basically anytime\nyou share an emotional experience with\nsomeone else and you have you're on the\nsame empathic wavelength that leads to\nchemistry so what happens in rehab is\neveryone is going through all the same\ncrap everyone's lives have fallen apart\neveryone is sharing their story\neveryone's going through withdrawal and\nby the way by the end of rehab right\nweek three week four everyone is feeling\ngood so you've walked this emotional\nridden this emotional roller coaster\nwith this other human being and it\nliterally creates this kind of like\nchemistry this deep bonding my favorite\nstudy that sort of tested this\nspecifically is they had dates go meet\non a bridge so that they had people who\nwent on dates there are two Bridges\nthere's a stone bridge and then there's\na rickety bridge and what they literally\nfound is that when there is stability on\nthe bridge people are less attracted to\neach other but when there's a rickety\nbridge and we meet in the middle of a\nrickety bridge I'm scared a little bit\nshitless and you're scared a little bit\nshitless and that actually creates a\nsense of chemistry so if we look at the\nstandard date that we go on it's like\nokay like let's go and see if we're a\ngood match so we're going to sit there\nit's not a date it's a interview\nright it's like okay so tell me a little\nbit are you interested in having kids\nbecause like I've got my thing and like\noh I see here that you're interested in\nhaving kids okay like how do you feel\nabout pets dogs cats are you dog person\ncat person are you a neither person are\nyou a vegan are you not vegan it's a\n job interview and if you look at\nthe empathic connection it's not there\nat all right because one person is doing\nthe interviewing and the other person is\nbeing interviewed y'all may take turns\nbut in the moment that both of you are\ntalking about your stuff it's like\nwhere's the empathic connection where's\nthe flirtation where's the excitement\nwhere's the the fear so we know that we\nneed shared emotional connections and a\nlot of times that's not what happens\nwhen we go on dates because we're in\nthis weird pseudo interview kind of like\nstyle so what I would recommend is that\nyou do an activity is not a standard\ndate but you do an activity that is\ngoing to have both of yall having the\nsame emotion now this is where a lot of\npeople slip up because we can say like\ngo on a roller coaster like I think that\nsounds great go white waterer rafting\nthese are things that I like right maybe\nyou want to do something like go rock\nclimbing or dancing but then you've got\nto be careful so a lot of times if you\ndo something dancing let's say are you\nand the other person going to have the\nsame emotional state only if both of\ny'all are into dancing but if one of\ny'all is a novice and one of y'all is an\nexpert one of you is going to be having\nthe time of their life and the other\nperson is going to be thinking like oh\nmy God I'm such an idiot I'm such an\nidiot I'm such an idiot I'm not saying\nthat compassion in those situations or\nteaching someone can't be attractive as\nwell there's other stuff to it but the\nmain thing to understand is we want to\nshoot for a shared emotional state so\nsomething like an escape room something\nlike a roller coaster something like\nlike something where both of y'all are\ngoing to be emotionally kind of at the\nsame level is really what you want to\nshoot for and anytime human beings share\nemotions they feel connected the second\nthing that leads to chemistry or\nattraction is a freedom from daily\nhassles so this is a second problem that\nI think a lot of people run into is that\ngoing on a date with you can sometimes\nbe more trouble than it's worth right so\nthis is where what you really want to do\nis create a situation that is hasslefree\nnow this is not easy to do it's full of\nlandmines because this is the other\nproblem that dudes face is that like\nit's not clear women too everyone who's\ndating is facing this basic problem\nwhere everyone has a set of rules about\nwhat to do or what not to do the problem\nis that there's no consensus about the\nrules so some people are like oh my God\nlike real men figure everything out and\nthey don't ask a thousand questions they\ntake the lead and other people are like\nwell this person is like not giving me a\nchoice this person is like figuring out\nlike he's telling me to be here at this\ntime he sounds like an there's\nno space for my opinion and in both of\nthese cases everyone is really really\nsure what they want but it's the exact\nopposite thing which makes it insane to\ntry to date today because every person\nthat you meet has their own report card\nwhich you don't know ahead of time and\nthey're not going to give you a second\nchance because there's a billion people\nout there so like before you know what\nyou're be being graded for it's like\nthey hand you a sheet of paper and\nthey're like write something on the\nsheet of paper and you're like I'm\nconfused should I write an essay or do a\nmath problem or draw a picture and so\nthey're like H I don't know and so then\nyou draw a picture and they're like\nyou this was a Spanish test you were\nsupposed to be writing an essay in\nSpanish they're like you fail and then\nyou're like wait you didn't tell me that\nahead of time this is what modern dating\nis like at the same time what we know\nabout sexual attraction chemistry being\ninto each other is that you want to make\nthings as hasslefree as possible so\nstart to ask yourself when someone is\ninteracting with me is it a hassle right\nam I I asking them too many questions am\nI demanding too much from them so what I\nwould actually recommend is that you do\n51 plus% of the work yourself in terms\nof organizing the date maybe ask for a\ncouple preferences and be like hey I'm\ngoing to toss out an idea let me know if\nthis works for you or if you want to\ndiscuss it more what do you think about\nmeeting at this time at this day and\nwe'll kind of do this like how does that\nsound right so offer something up first\nand then leave the space for them to\ndisagree or whatever so you want to be a\nlittle bit directive but a little bit\nopen the main thing is that you don't\nwant to make it a pain in the ass for\nthem there are studies that show that\nwhen people are like dating and stuff\nand what they really are looking for is\na break from their day so I'm at my I'm\nat work today my boss is writing me\nabout this and like my co-workers are\ndoing this and I have this deadline\nthat's due on Monday so Thursday rolls\naround I want to take a break from my\nlife and it's the human being that can\nhelp me take a break from my life that I\nwill feel much more attracted to okay so\ntry to be as hassle free as possible the\nthird thing which a lot of people make a\nmistake on is that we know that\nchemistry builds and starts to wne after\n90 minutes so if you have an interaction\nwith someone don't have it longer than\n90 minutes okay so what that means is\nwe're going to do like a nice short date\nand even if they're super into it be a\nlittle bit careful right because things\nwere going really really well and we\nwent on a 4-Hour date and then they were\nlike I think of you as a friend and\npeople like I don't understand what\nhappened things were going really well\nwe we hung out together for 4 hours\nthat's what happened you hung out for 4\nhours and the data suggests that a\n90-minute window is actually optimal for\nsort of the formation of chemistry okay\nso these are the three things that you\nall need to really focus on if you want\nto get a second date because a lot of\ny'all out there have fixed all the stuff\naround the dating profiles right you've\ndone what you can you've learned how to\nglow up a little bit you learned how to\ntake a picture you started working out\nyou started working harder at work you\ngot promoted you make a little bit more\nmoney you fixed everything everything\nthat you can in your own life but you're\nstill not sure why people don't go on\nsecond dates with you and on the flip\nside by the way this is how those losers\nend up getting second dates third dates\nfourth dates right because it's not like\nthey have stable jobs or they've got\nfive baby mamas or whatever like you\nknow their their life seems to be a mess\nand they're managed to get dates and why\nis that that's because they figured this\nstuff out they tend to be in and out\nright they're not consistent 90 minute\noh yeah sorry I got to go they're not\nhanging out with you all day they do\nmake things actually kind of hassle-free\nright there may be drama but it's\nhassle-free early on it's like hey this\nis a free ticket to a good time right no\nstrings attached like whatever we're not\ngoing to talk about life we're not going\nto talk about marriage or having kids\nwe're just going to have a good time and\nlast thing is that they create shared\nemotional connections and sometimes the\nway that they do that is by actually\nencouraging drama so some people who are\nlike very dramatic will actually create\na shared emotional connection I'm\nfrustrated with you you're frustrated\nwith me and that actually like binds us\ntogether even though we're really\n frustrated traed with each other\nright it's really weird but that's like\nliterally how it works now the last\nthing that we're going to talk about is\nwe're going to talk about the friend\nzone for a second because this is a\ngreat example of why the friend zone\ndoesn't work so a lot of times people\nwill be like I'm so confused why this\nperson continues to date Bad Dudes when\nI'm loving I'm supportive I'm\ncompassionate my friend or this person\nthat I'm attracted to keeps on\ncomplaining about all these qualities\nbut I have all of those qualities why\nwon't they date me it's because y'all\nare never on the same emotional level\nright so when your friend who\nfriendzoned you is crying because she\ngot mistreated by her boyfriend you are\nvery compassionate and she is very\nemotional that's not on the same level\nyou're picking up the pieces and by the\nway that's what friends do for each\nother ideally what would happen is if\nyou were going through a breakup she\nwould reciprocate right you're crying\nand then she's sort of meeting you where\nyou're at and that's what friends are\nfriends are people who don't necessarily\nshare the same emotional connection but\nactually compliment each other\nemotionally right friends are the people\nwho when you're feeling really down\nthey're the ones that are going to pep\nyou up that's not sexual attraction\nthat's friendship that's reciprocity so\nit turns out that if you're having\ntrouble getting a second date there's\nactually some interesting scientific\nstudies and principles that we don't\nreally leverage we don't really\nunderstand what the nature of Attraction\nis and how chemistry forms and\nparadoxically this is really frustrating\nfor us because we see it right we see\npeople that we think this person should\nnot be getting second dates this person\nshould not be getting their bits I'm\nbetter than them but they clearly are\ndoing something that you are not doing\nand it turns out it comes down to three\nthings first of all 90 minutes or less\nhassle-free and shared emotional\nconnection this is what the science of\nchemistry attachment things like that\nthe formation of bonds really tells us\nleads people to kind of get sexually\nexcited and form a little bit more\nchemistry so give this a shot I hope\nit's helpful to you and as a caveat like\nthis is not stuff that well it's stuff\nthat I've piloted with a very small\nnumber of people but this is what I've\nbeen found to be useful for a lot of the\npeople that I work with so give it a\nshot and for the love of God do not talk\nabout long-term stuff on a first date or\neven if they want to you can humor them\nsome but you don't go there you're not\ngoing through a job interview you're\ntrying to have fun with someone and form\na connection so that's what you should\nfocus on and doing something a little\nbit scary for both of y'all is usually a\ngood\nstart\nn"
