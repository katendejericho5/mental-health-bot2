    "transcript": "people say it's impossible to get out of\nthe friend zone you should move on I\nmean like yeah you should move on if\nsomeone's not interested in you but I\nthink that I want to say like 30 or 40\nthe% of the relationships that I've seen\npeople start out as friends like it\nhappens quite a bit like people move out\nof the friend zone all the time the\nproblem that we run into is we get so\ncaught up about doing it that we put all\nof our eggs into one basket we want to\nforce it that is actually what sabotage\nis in right so the right move is to\nconfess your love not confess but let\neveryone know that you're having\nromantic thoughts if they're your\nfriends so I I think don't confess your\nlove oh my god dude so much to handle\njust let them know like hey like I\nsometimes have these feelings and then\nwatch them get flustered be like hey\nwould you ever you know want to consider\nchanging this relationship and I I I\nwouldn't say more than being friends by\nthe way don't ever say more than friends\nbecause it implies that other things are\ngreater than friendship friendship is\nequal to romance right when you start\ntreating it that way people will receive\nit a lot better would you ever be\ninterested in exploring something\nbesides friendship right just ask"
