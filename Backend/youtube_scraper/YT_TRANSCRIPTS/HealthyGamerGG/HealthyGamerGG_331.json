    "transcript": "why men are often times not attractive\none is that we're not conditioned to it\nI think a second thing that tends to\nhappen with men is that people don't\ncomplement men's appearances very often\nI grew up in a a time where any kind of\npositive affection or even comment in\nthe Physical Realm about another dude\nlabeled one as homosexual so I grew up\nin a highly homophobic environment\nheaven forbid you say that a Dude Looks\nattractive like oh my God that means\nthat you're gay oh my God we can't have\nthat the other thing that tends to\nhappen is that men don't get compliments\nso we don't feel attractive and if we\nnever get positive reinforcement we're\nnot going to go out of our way to look\nattractive and part of the reason that\nwe never get compliments it's not just\nwomen's fault or other men's fault it's\nbecause frequently we as men get\nconfused when someone compliments us\nthis person is complimenting my\nappearance when I complement someone's\nappearance that means that I'm attracted\nto them and want to sleep with them so\nif they are complimenting my appearance\nthat means that they must want to sleep\nwith me"
