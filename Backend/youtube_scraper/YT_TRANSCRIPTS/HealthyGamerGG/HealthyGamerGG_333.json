    "transcript": "so the other problem that we run into\nwhen we don't let people reject us is we\nbecome manipulative and we create\nrelationships that are doomed to fail\nwhat do I mean by this if I don't don't\nwant to give someone the chance to\nreject me what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to hide something right oh yeah\nthat's not really me or I'm not going to\nshare this little tidbit because if I\nshare this they could reject me they may\nlike it they may not like it but then\nwhat happens is you create a\nrelationship that's based on a lie and\nthen what happens is now like you've got\nto cover this thing up and they can\nnever find out and you're playing this\ngame that if if I can force them or\ntrick them into investing a lot into the\nrelationship when they eventually find\nout there's so much in the relationship\nalready that I'll be able to write it\nout not a good strategy give them the\nchoice to reject you I know it's hard\nbut your relationship will actually be\nhealthier instead what's going to happen\nis you'll build something up for a while\nand then they're going to feel betrayed\nso now there is a possibility of\nrejection and there is a guarantee of\nbetrayal so I know it's I know it's hard\nbut you got to give people the chance to\nreject you cuz that's where like respect\ncomes from"
