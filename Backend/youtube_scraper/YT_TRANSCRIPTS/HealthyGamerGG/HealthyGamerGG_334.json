    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about the\npotential advantages of\nloneliness now I know this sounds kind\nof weird because a lot of y'all are\nthinking I'm really lonely I'm feeling\nisolated I hate this state I don't want\nto be here anymore right and so what is\nour experience of that it's like okay\nlike I'm lonely I'm isolated my\nloneliness Rises so much to where I'm\nfinally like okay I got to make I got to\nleave the house I got to make some\nfriends and then you go you leave the\nhouse and then suddenly you're anxious\nand everyone's like kind of weird weird\nand like people don't really treat you\nvery well and people ignore your text\nmessages and you have to me message them\nfirst and they never message you back\nand then you're kind of like this sucks\nand then you go back to retreating\nwithin yourself and this becomes a\nvicious cycle that I've seen in memes\nand there's also like the you know the\npurple sorry the pink blob mean where\nit's like okay I'm like isolated and\nlonely let me go out into the world and\nmake friends and it's like slam get back\ninto your cage and so it's kind of\nbizarre right because we think about\nloneliness as a negative thing but if we\nreally stop and think about it anytime\nthere's an ecosystem that has something\nthat's on the rise right and loneliness\nis at epidemic level\nproportions so anytime something is on\nthe rise what we have to understand is\nwithin nature that means that there is\nan Adaptive advantage to that thing and\ntoday we're going to teach you how\nloneliness is used as a powerful\nemotional regulation technique and a\ncouple of things that we can do to\nharness the positives of loneliness\nwhile actually shedding out some of the\nthings like the sadness and feelings of\nisolation so let's start with kind of\nlike a macroscopic view okay so most of\nthe time when people talk about\nloneliness they say that okay the reason\nthat people are more lonely is because\nSociety is changing so they'll say\nthings like we're much more digitally\nconnected right so you don't have to\nleave the house anymore to connect with\npeople and then people will also talk\nabout things like the loss of third\nspaces so these are spaces that you sort\nof have to go and interact with people\nlike places like community centers or\nchurches or bars or like you know sports\nclubs or whatever where you sort of are\nable to make friends and there's sort of\nlike a death of this third space so you\nhave work you have home but there's no\nother place for you to meet people it's\nreally hard to meet people and those are\nabsolutely real problems and absolutely\nreal things but I think that part of the\nreason that loneliness is is on the rise\nis because people suck more than they\nused to I mean like literally like not\nliterally metaphorically but literally\nlike people like are crappier than they\nused to be so if we look at the internet\nwhat's the internet doing the internet\nis making us more divisive more\nself-righteous more narcissistic social\nmedia makes everybody more narcissistic\nand the most disturbing Trend that I've\nseen recently within humans is that\nhuman beings expect other human beings\nto conform to whatever I want so you are\nnot allowed to say something or do\nsomething because it makes me feel bad\nright and and so I'm not saying that\nlike we should all be all the\ntime but what I'm sort of saying is that\nhuman beings are now Outsourcing\nthe regulation of their emotions to\nother people since I'm feeling hurt that\nmeans you did something wrong and if I'm\nfeeling hurt you should change your\nbehavior so I no longer feel this way so\nif we really look at what's going on in\nthe world sure there's the loss of third\nspaces but I think human beings are like\nbecoming more narcissistic becoming more\nemotionally dependent becoming more\nemotionally infantile and what that\nmeans for you is that like it's harder\nto interact with beings and you can see\nthis with sort of the rise of carons\nright so now we even have a term for\npeople who are like so disregulated and\ndemand so much or so entitled from the\nother people that we give they have\ntheir own name and they're male Kens too\nit's not just about being a woman and so\nwe start to think about okay like why\nare people lonely it's like yeah sure I\nmean it's hard to make friends and all\nthat stuff but part of the reason it's\nhard to make friends is because people\nsuck and they don't text you back\nbecause human beings are replaceable\nright now right so if I don't text text\nyou back like I can find someone else to\nhang out with and the moment that you\nstop conforming to what I want I'm going\nto just block you and there's literally\nlike a billion people that I can\ninteract with to get my emotional needs\nmet there's a study which showed that\n50% of people who use dating apps women\nuse dating apps for psychological needs\nthat have nothing to do with romantic\nrelationships okay and I'm sure that men\nuse it for all kinds of stuff too so\nwhat's going on is that human beings are\nlike becoming more replaceable we're\nbecoming more dispensable and so as a\nhuman if you're out in this world where\npeople are more narcissistic and people\nare more then why would you\nwant to interact with them couple this\nwith the fact that it is so easy to be\nalone so not only have human beings\nbecome harder to be with but we need\nthem way less than we used to so I see\nthis a lot in the dating world where now\nit's no longer like I need a partner to\nbe happy now the the issue is is my life\nactually better with a partner than\nwithout a partner that what you you're\nnot competing against other people what\nyou're really competing against is the\nSolitude and peace of mind of the person\nthat you're trying to date because\nwithout you and your drama their life is\npretty good right I can order food if I\nwant I can play fun video games if I\nwant there's an unprecedented level of\nlike fiction books that are being\npublished and non-fiction books that are\nbeing published you know like the world\nis becoming a pretty cool place you can\ntravel alone it's pretty safe travel is\nalso way easier there's all kinds of\nways that you can sort of do fulfilling\ncreative work and you can take art\nclasses and like you know life is so\nfull of stuff right now that we don't\nneed other human beings as much as we\ndid in the past so I think this is the\nkind of a macroscopic view that we have\nto start with which is that first of all\nloneliness may be more adaptive because\nrelationships kind are kind of crappier\nnow in addition to the macro environment\nthere's also some really interesting\nstuff that isolation actually does to\nyour brain and your emotional state so\nlet's take a quick look at that the\nfirst kind of Distinction that we need\nto create is that there are high arousal\nemotions and there are low arousal\nemotions and what does that mean so if\nwe look at our emotions our emotions\neither put us in one of two modes they\neither activate our sympathetic nervous\nsystem which is our fight or flight\nsystem or they activate our\nparasympathetic nerv nervous system\nwhich is our rest or digest system so\njust a quick aside about the autonomic\nnervous system so we have two modes we\nhave fight and flight and rest and\ndigest so if you kind of think about\nlike let's say I go out and I'm playing\nlike Ultimate Frisbee with my friends\nI'm activated I'm excited I'm sort of\nfeeling a lot of positive emotion but\nit's excitement if I'm going out and I'm\npartying with my friends we're also like\nwe're living life to the fullest right\nand then there are also positive\nemotions that are not high arousal but\nare actually low arousal these are\nemotions like peace relax ation Netflix\nand chill like even though the direction\nof the emotion is positive it feels very\ndifferent from excitement right this is\nkind of I'm chilling I'm relaxing I'm\nenjoying right so that's the\nparasympathetic nervous system or low\narousal emotions so we tend to think\nabout\nemotions as positive or negative but we\ncan actually further subdivide them into\nhigh arousal or low arousal so high\narousal positive emotions are things\nlike\nexcitement Joy\nlust right these are like good things\nlike yeah like let's go baby come on and\nthen we also have positive emotions that\nare low arousal so these are things like\nrelaxation or feeling relaxed\ncontentment\npeace okay and then on the negative side\nwe also have high arousal emotions and\nlow arousal emotions so what are high\narousal emotions that are negative these\nare emotions that cause us to act or\ninduce action right they want to\nactivate us we got to do something like\nanger fear\nanxiety right these things ramp us up\nand we sort of know that all three of\nthese emotions will increase our heart\nrate increase our blood pressure induce\ndiaphoresis which is sweating pupilary\ndilation right because we need to be\nable to see more and we need to be able\nto like pull in more light so anger fear\nand anxiety they all increase our our\nsympathetic nervous system activity they\nare high arousal and then we have\nnegative low arousal emotions like\nsadness and\ndullness okay so I'm feeling sad I don't\nfeel like doing anything right when\nwe're depressed we don't want to get up\nand do something we don't want to run\naway or fight something we want to just\nsit and we want to fast forward our day\nuntil things get better so if we look at\nisolation Okay so I'm going to use this\ndifferent word isolation we'll get to\nloneliness in a second so if we look at\nwhat is the effect of isolation the\neffect of isolation is that it moves us\nfrom high arousal emotions to low\narousal emotions okay so it does this\nfor positive and negative emotions this\nis what's really important to understand\nall right so anytime we isolate we feel\nless excitement and we feel less anger\nwe feel less joy and we feel less fear\nand anxiety so isolation is a is\nsomething that we do that basically\nmoves us from high arousal to low\narousal if we approach things from an\nemotional regulation standpoint why do\nwe isolate so it turns out that the more\nnegative High arousal emotion you\nexperience the more that your brain is\ngoing to want to tone that down by\nisolation and if we sort of look at\nsociety today what are the predominant\nemotions we experience when we spend\ntime on the internet they are all high\narousal emotions and companies have\nfigured this out because they've sort of\nfigured out that if they can make you\nfeel content you're not going to buy\nanything but if they can make you feel\nanxious if they can make you feel angry\nif they can make you feel afraid oh my\nGod you're getting older like I've seen\nthe number of women I've worked with who\nare under the age of 30 and are getting\ncosmetic surgery is rising\nastronomically if you look at things\nlike beauty products and all this stuff\neverything is astronomical everything is\ngrowing so fast the beauty industry on\nsocial media is gigantic and why is that\nit's because if they can create\ninsecurity oh my God you're getting old\nyou're getting wrinkles oh my God you're\ngetting wrinkles by this thing this will\nmake your wrinkles go away oh oh thank\nGod that someone is selling me something\nthat will solve this fear that they've\njust created in Me by showing me all of\nthis social media kind of stuff oh my\nGod thank God that they're selling this\nthing because without that I would have\nwrinkles and heaven forbid human beings\nare not allowed to have wrinkles I'm not\ntrying to be insensitive to people who\nhave these problems but I'm just sort of\npointing out that this is what's being\ncreated by social media so the internet\ncreates these really high intensity High\narousal emotions and then what we end up\ndoing is isolating to fix them this also\nis like a a perfect example of this\nwhole cycle of okay I'm feeling lonely\nlonely lonely sad sad sad and eventually\nonce the sadness builds up right so the\nsadness is increasing over time and then\nonce it hits a critical threshold then\nI'm going to go out into the world and\nwhen I go out into the world and I\ninteract with people then suddenly my\nanxiety starts increasing and then what\nhappens is the second that my anxiety\noutpaces\nmy sadness then I'm like more sad and so\nthen what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto go back to isolating right so this is\nthe Vicious Cycle that we create and so\nwhat essentially is happening is we're\nping ponging between sadness and\nisolation and anxiety and being out in\nthe public so how do we fix\nthis it turns out that there is one\nreally interesting thing that we can do\nwe can turn sadness and dullness into\npeacefulness and contentment so so\nhere's the crazy thing if you want to\nmove from sadness and dullness to\npeacefulness and contentment what you\nactually need to engage in is Solitude\nnow this may sound insane because you're\nsaying I'm feeling lonely the antidote\nof that is to spend time with other\npeople right that'll make the loneliness\ngo away but if you look at research on\nloneliness what you discover is that\npeople who are lonely are just as\nsocially engaged as people who are not\nlonely social activity is actually\nindependent of your degree of loneliness\nexcept for in very severe cases is my\nguess okay so then the question is well\nhold on a second how does that work well\njust think about it for a second right\nso if you're sitting at home by yourself\nand you're kind of tired of being alone\nand then you go out and you hang out\nwith a group of friends you're with\neight of your friends and they're all\ntalking and what are you doing you're\njust by yourself right you get ignored\nby the people around you you engage in\nsome degree of social activity but\nyou're texting them they're not texting\nyou and then eventually I'll go out for\ndinner and then if you really look at\nthe total amount of social activity that\nyou may have it's actually it doesn't\ncorrelate with like the degree of\nloneliness that you feel because as I'm\nsure you all know you can feel\ncompletely alone when surrounded by a\ngroup of people and in fact sometimes\nthe times where you feel the most alone\nare when you are surrounded by a group\nof people who are in a completely\ndifferent place from where you are so\nthe first thing to understand is that\nactual social activity doesn't\nnecessarily correlate with the degree of\nloneliness that you feel\nand so this is where Solitude comes in\nso this is something that's really weird\nabout human behavior but it makes\nperfect sense a human being's choice in\na particular thing is the most important\nthing for their mental state so for\nexample if I look at the physical state\nof getting fired and quitting it's\nbasically the same I don't have a job\nanymore I don't go to work there anymore\nthose are no longer my co-workers but\nhow I feel about that is very different\nif I chose to quit or if I get fired\nright breaking up with your partner and\ngetting dumped feels completely\ndifferent and I'll give you all just\nanother example right so people will do\nthis thing called dieting have yall\nheard of dieting it's when you restrict\nwhat you eat and you stop eating the\nfood that you want to eat that's insane\nnow imagine if someone else did that to\nyou right if someone else showed\nup at your house and got rid of all the\nbad food and was like no you don't get\nto eat that you eat what I tell you to\neat you eat this chicken breast\ngrilled chicken breast for the 86th time\nthis year because you need protein this\nday this month whatever this week right\nyou're going to eat this crappy food\npeople would be rebelling right left and\nCenter no you don't get to control what\nI eat oh my God this person is so\ncontrolling we've seen posts about it on\nthe internet my boyfriend is so\ncontrolling they regulate what I eat oh\nmy God everyone's like break up with\nthem and yet you have an equal number of\npeople who are doing the same things to\nthemselves so this is the key thing to\nunderstand okay I know it sounds crazy\nSolitude and loneliness are two versions\nof isolation one is very healthy and\nwill actually help you a lot and the\nsecond is unhealthy and will screw you\nover and then the problem and this is\nwhy it's so mindblowing right and this\nis why no one has figured it out yet\nbecause it's paradoxical because when I\nfeel lonely what does my brain tell me\nto do it says go engage with other\npeople but we've already explored that\nit's like go engage with other people\nget smacked and then go back into\nloneliness so instead what you need to\ndo is engage in solitude and what does\nthat mean so I'm not suggesting that you\nbe alone for a long period of time what\nI'm saying is 20% of the time that you\nare by yourself you engage in solitude\nand what does that mean so what that\nmeans is for let's say I'm sitting at\nhome on my ass for 10 hours a day and I\ndon't see another human being okay I've\nbeen in that state before so I'm not\nsaying that you what I'm saying is for\ntwo hours of that time you don't think\nabout other people and you do things\njust by yourself very intentionally\nother people are not a part of it so\nwhat can you do with yourself for for\nthose 10 hours and a lot of you may say\nwell that's how I spend I spend the\nwhole day with myself no you don't\nchances are you don't actively engage in\nsolitude right you don't say this is\nwhat I want to do this is what you are\nforced to do so I would pick two hours a\nday if you're by yourself basically all\nday long to engage in solitary\nactivities so I'm going to brew a cup of\ntea I'm going to take a walk I'm going\nto sit down at a park bench I'm going to\ngrab my thermos and I'm going to read a\nbook so for a 2hour stretch I'm just\ngoing to be by myself and this is the\nreally interesting thing is when human\nbeings engage in solitude and there's a\nlot of research on this it shows that\nthey actually move into that column of\nlow arousal positive emotions they\nactually become less sad and more\npeaceful in content even though their\ncircumstances are exactly the same it's\njust like quitting versus getting fired\nthat which you choose mentally you will\nbe okay with so choose some degree of\nsolitude okay for let's say 2 hours a\nday if it's 10 hours So 20% of the time\nthe rest of the time you can be lonely\nand by all means go engage with other\npeople I'm just saying encourage a\nlittle bit of solitude now the really\ninteresting thing is we've got some\nreally good data or not data but\nanecdotal evidence of what impact this\nhas so the best example of this comes\nfrom monks so monks don't really\nsocialize much right it's not a big part\nof what they do and so you kind of think\nabout it but if you ever like hang out\nwith a monk they're like so fun to hang\nout with they tend to be peaceful they\ntend to be relaxed they tend to be\npretty chill like they're kind of joyous\nand how do they spend most of days in\nsolitude and paradoxically it makes them\nbetter at engaging in social activity\nand this is the other really wild thing\nis Solitude doesn't\njust reduce the amount of sadness and\ndepression and and dullness that you\nfeel and make you feel more peaceful and\ncontent there are research studies that\nshow that Solitude improves the quality\nof social interactions and improves the\nquality of connections you're able to\nmake with other people Solitude\nliterally makes makes it easier to\nconnect to other people and you may\nWonder well like hold on a second why is\nthat and why are the monks so good at it\nit's because when you spend time with\nyourself you get to know yourself and\nthe more that you know yourself the more\nthat you can connect with another human\nbeing because what makes connection with\nanother human being hard what makes it\nhard is that there's a pile of crap in\nhere and then there's the mask that I\nput on and so when I meet someone what\nthey're going to connect with is the\nmask they're not going to connect with\nall the crap that I keep hidden right\nand so paradoxically this is another\nproblem that we see in our community is\nthat people will get really good at\nacting social but internally they still\nfeel incredibly alone and so the really\ncool thing is that there's actually one\nthing that you can do to really address\nthis feeling of loneliness and actually\nlean into it a little bit even because\nwhat we know is that loneliness helps us\nmanage our powerful negative emotions\nwhich is to engage in solitude the other\nthing that you can do which is really\ninteresting is that the more that you\nengage in negative emotions that are\nhigh arousal the more Solitude dependent\nyou will become or the more more\nisolation dependent you will become okay\nso this is where if you really think\nabout it after you spend an hour or two\nhours or three hours browsing the\ninternet and reading like Mi the\nor whatever kind of like dating\nsubreddit kind of stuff like whatever\nyour you know Israel Palestine Hamas\nversus like the IDF like what whatever\npeople are reading right now it all gets\nyou ramped up and what do you feel like\ndoing at the end of those hours right\nwhat do you feel like doing you're like\nwow I'm so glad I spent three hours\nbrowsing the internet man let me call up\na couple of friends and let's go do\nsomething fun let's go play some\nUltimate Frisbee or go for a hike no\nyou're just like h ah what do I do oh my\nGod I guess I'll order something from\nfood delivery cuz like now I'm\nhungry and then you eat that and you\nfeel like crap even more so the other\nthing that you can do do is to sort of\ndecrease the hunger for isolation by\nreducing your exposure to high arousal\nnegative\nemotions and if youall are able to do a\ncouple of these things you will be\namazed at how much you can kind of\nutilize this isolation for your benefit\nin a perfect world you would do the\nfollowing things one is you'd limit your\nhigh arousal internet content that'll\nreduce your need for isolation the\nsecond thing is you spend more time with\nyourself intentionally Solitude instead\nof being alone right technically or on\nthe surface it's going to look like the\nsame thing because you're by yourself in\neither situation but one is something\nthat you choose to do by yourself and\nthe second is something that is forced\nupon you by the assholery of the world\nwill completely change your perspective\nand will change the way that you\nexperience it will even change your\nbrain the more that you spend time in\nsolitude the more peaceful and content\nyou will be the more peaceful content\nand grounded you are the easier it will\nbe to tolerate the crap from other\npeople the more monk-like you will\nbecome and interestingly enough it'll\nalso help you connect with those people\nso not only does it help you tolerate\nthe bad but it also improves the quality\nof social interactions that you have so\nyou have fewer crappy social\ninteractions so I I know it sounds crazy\nbut isolation actually has some\nadvantages the key thing though is for\nyou to slip into Solitude instead of\nloneliness hey y'all if you're\ninterested in applying some of the\nprinci principles that we share to\nactually create change in your life\ncheck out Dr K's guide to mental health\nit combines over two decades of my\nexperience of both being a monk and a\npsychiatrist and
