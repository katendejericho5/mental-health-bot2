    "transcript": "today I'm going to teach you why you\nshould be less motivated and how to\nachieve less\nmotivation now this may sound insane\nbecause you're sitting there telling me\nbut hey Dr K I'm actually not motivated\nenough my life suffers from a lack of\nmotivation all I do is sit at home all\nday or I want to go to the gym or I want\nto eat healthy or I want to work harder\nat work I wish I could study harder but\nI'm just not motivated enough to do it\nand I would actually argue that the\nproblem isn't that you're not motivated\nenough the problem is that you are too\nmotivated in the wrong direction so\nlet's take the case of you sitting at\nhome and doing nothing so if you sort of\nthink about it as you try to go and do\nsomething there are very powerful forces\nfor you to overcome for you to do\nsomething right you really have to try\nhard to extract yourself from the\ncomputer or TV or whatever you have to\nreally try extra hard to go to this\nextra study session or go to office\nhours with your professor so if we\nreally look at it doing things in life\nrequires extra effort and now you may\nthink that's because I'm not motivated\nbut if you really pause and think about\nit you're highly motivated to continue\ndoing what you're doing there's a part\nof your brain that is telling you hey we\ndon't want to do that we actually really\nwant to stay here and watch one more\nepisode of whatever we happen to be\nbinging at the time or queue up for one\nmore video game or as you struggle to\nfind the motivation to stop using social\nmedia there's a part of your brain\nthat's like no no no no no no my friend\nwe are not going to stop we are actually\nhighly motivated to continue doing what\nwe're doing let's take a quick look at\nthe neuroscience and see if this kind of\npans out because it absolutely does in\norder to understand how to become less\nmotivated and these are the bad\nmotivations that we have we've got to\nstart by understanding the Neuroscience\nof motivation motivation comes from the\nnucleus accumbent of our brain the\nnucleus accumbent governs reward\nbehavioral reinforcement and motivation\nso basically the way this works is I try\nsomething and depending on how\npleasurable it is I get a spurt of\ndopamine in my nucleus accumbens if my\nnucleus accumbent gets some dopamine it\nsays okay this thing feels good it feels\npleasurable therefore let us reinforce\nthe behavior and if we stop and think\nabout what do behavioral reinforcement\nmean it basically means motivate to do\nit again right so if I play a particular\nvideo game and I have lots of fun I will\nget a lot of dopamine and then I will be\nmotivated to Play It Again the other\nimportant part of the nucleus succumbent\nis that it is also very sensitive to\npain so not only does it help us seek\npleasure it also is very very sensitive\nto avoiding pain and this is exactly why\nwe're highly motivated to do nothing\nright so if there's a task that you're\nprocrastinating on like like hey I need\nto email my professor for an extension\nyou're concerned that the professor may\nthink something bad about you may say no\nthat you may really be screwed and in\nthe avoidance of that pain your nucleus\nsuccumbent is like whoa whoa whoa buddy\nwhy would you engage in that\nconversation that could end badly when\nwe can queue up for another game right\nand then we can get that dopamine and\nit's totally fine and so if we think\nabout our internal struggle to do the\nthings that you should do instead of\ndoing the things that you're motivated\nto do what we find is that it comes down\nto the nucleus accumbent now how do we\nbreak free of this how do we actually\ndecrease our motivation now this is\nwhat's really cool there's another\nsource of happiness in our brain that's\nreferred to by the term udics so when\nyou kind of think about happiness\nthere's two terms that kind of come up\nand they come from different parts of\nthe brain the first is hedonics so this\nis pleasure this comes from the nucleus\ncumbent and this is like you know\npleasure seeking like games are f fun\nbooze is fun pot is fun dancing is fun\nsex is fun like all this stuff is fun\nright it's pleasurable but then if we\nlook at happiness and contentment this\nis actually governed by a completely\ndifferent part of the brain this is what\nwe call udics and it's governed by this\npart called the insula and the primary\nlike neurotransmitter involved is also\nserotonin so we've got kind of the\ndopamine system and we've got the\nserotonin system now the interesting\nthing about udics is the subjective\nexperience of udics is that you're kind\nof chill you're vibing you're content\nyou feel generally happy with life now\nthe really interesting thing is that\nthese two things are antagonistic so if\nyou look at someone who's highly\ndopaminergic and their life is governed\nby the nucleus accumbent they have very\npowerful motivations oh my God I I need\nto get up and I need to hop on the\ncomputer I need to hop on my phone I\nneed to use technology I need to do this\nthing a lot and then generally speaking\nif you ask them how content are you in\nlife how happy are you in life they will\nsay low now if we flip it around and we\ntake someone who is highly UD dimonic\nand we ask them what's your life like\nthey kind of wake up and they're sort of\nchilling they're kind of vibing they're\nlike life is good and then if you ask\nthem what do you want to do today today\nthey'll be like whatever you want to do\nis fine they're not their brain is not\nsort of honing in on I need this\npleasure I need to avoid this pain\npeople who are highly UD dionic are also\nmore resilient like we said it kind of\nrelates somewhat to serotonin and what\nwe understand is that boosting serotonin\nsignals in the brain will improve things\nlike depression and anxiety so if we\nsort of think about someone who's UD\ndionic and kind of chilling and content\nthey're less depressed they're less\nanxious and they're kind of going about\nliving their\nday and so now what we really need to do\nis understand okay how do we make this\nshift from hedonics in the nucleus\naccumbens to udim monics in sort of\nbeing generally content now this is\nwhere thankfully we've got a really\nreally really good technique that comes\nfrom yoga so couple thousand years ago\nyou had a group of yogis and monks and\npeople like that right and you have all\nthese people like um you know who will\ntalk about how meditation makes them\nhappier and more content boost willpower\nhow does that work what the yogis\nbasically figured out is that the\nattachment to pleasure and the avoidance\nof pain come hand in hand if I'm going\nto get a lot of Pride from a success I'm\nalso opening myself up to Devastation\nfrom failure and so what the yogis\ndecided that we're going to do is we're\ngoing to detach from all of that crap\nwe're going to separate ourselves from\nthe hedonics and then what happened when\nthey started doing these yogic practices\nthey became more UD dionic they started\nto become more content and as they got\nbetter and better than that at that they\neven attain States called Enlightenment\nwhich is a period of sort of persistent\nhappiness and contentment and you may\nsort of Wonder like how is that possible\nit's because they udics are through the\nroof they're kind of chilling vibing\nwith whatever happens so how how do we\nmake this shift so the yogis give us a\ncouple of good tips the first is that\nthey used to do practices like fasting\nor the deprivation of positive stimuli\nnow this is where we misunderstand\nreally what the benefit of this is when\npeople do things like fasting we think\nit's about willpower it's not actually\nabout willpower it's about observing\nyour life in the absence of a\npleasurable thing so let me give you all\nan example so when I was in an asham\nright so when I first went to study yoga\nthe food there sucked right so it's like\nasham food it's like Monastery food it's\nthe same kind of GRL I was actually\nnauseous I could barely choke it down\nand I longed for the foods that I wanted\nthe nucleus accumbent of my brain that\nwants that dopamine from that double\nfisting of a beer in one hand and a Coke\nin the other and a slab of Pizza in\nfront of me is like oh my God I don't\nwant to eat this rice GRL day after day\nafter day after day this sucks so much\nand then as I continued with the\ndeprivation I wasn't starving myself or\nanything I started to realize oh\nactually like I can actually find\nhappiness despite the fact that I don't\nget my material desires fulfilled after\na week goes by after two weeks go by I'm\nkind of like this is okay so one thing\nthat you can do is abstain from some\nkind of pleasurable thing now the goal\nof this abstinence isn't to actually\nboost your willpower although that can\nhappen the goal of this abstinence is\nfor you to pay attention to what happens\nto your sense of\ncontentment is your life absolutely\nmiserable without a slice of pizza or\nwithout beer or without marijuana you\nmay experience all kinds of negative\nthings but really pay attention to that\nand start to see what happens to your\nlife when you deprive yourself of this\nthing now what's going on in the brain\nwhen you do this what's going on is that\nwe are not feeding the nucleus\nsuccumbent because remember when the\nnucleus accumbent get something\npleasurable Spurt of dopamine behavioral\nreinforcement stronger motivation the\nnext day so we're sort of quieting down\nthe nucleus accumbent now the problem\nwith that technique is that it's pretty\ntough but I would recommend um you know\ngiving something up that you find\nsomewhat pleasurable but like is not\ngoing to be life-changing so in my case\nI gave up ice cream for 10 years and\nthat worked really really well it was\nawesome really helped me a lot next\nthing I know 10 years right honestly\nit's not that bad that's the whole\n point of the exercise you do it\nfor a while you're like hey this ain't\nso bad I could live totally fine and I\ncan be completely happy some of the best\nyears of my life were outside of one of\nmy favorite things second thing that we\ncan do is dissect pleasure now this is\nthe key thing that they sort of\nunderstood that we miss out a lot in in\nlife so right now everyone is all for\navoiding pain right cuz pain sucks and\nthat's bad and we don't want to Embrace\npain we don't want to fast we don't want\nto deprive ourselves of anything you see\nyour nucleus of cumbin it's like no no\nno no no no no we're highly motivated to\nnot give up ice cream don't take that\npleasure away from me me and it's going\nto drive you you see that motivational\npull that's happening right now I don't\nwant to give anything up which is fine\nyou don't have to so this is the cool\nthing you can not only embrace the\nnegative but you can also detach from\nthe positive now this may be where once\nagain your nucleus accumbens is freaking\nout does this mean he's going to tell me\nlike I shouldn't do fun things no no no\nI said detach from not abstain from so\nwhat does it mean to detach from the\npositive what this means is to dissect\nyour pleasure right observe your\npleasure from the outside so as you eat\na slice of pizza or have some ice cream\ntake a look at what's going on inside\nyou where in my body does this pleasure\ncome from now what you'll find is that\nas you start to observe and dissect your\npleasure the thing will become less\npleasurable so I'll give you all just a\nsimple example back in the day before I\nwent on my monk training I was 19 years\nold I was in my college dorm and I was\nwas living a hedonistic glorious\nlifestyle I would order fried rice 2 lbs\nat a time to save on delivery charges\nand I would just Gorge myself on soda\nand fried rice for 24-Hour gaming binges\nwhile I was playing Diablo and man I was\ncompletely unconscious but it was just\nsome sort of orgasmic gaming degenerate\nexperience no awareness and so hedonic\nand it ruined my life\ninstead what I want you all to do is\njust dissect it right so just pay\nattention to what about this is fun and\nwhat you'll discover is that the less\naware you are the more lost you are in\nthe stuff the more hedonic reinforcement\nyou'll get so as You observe pleasurable\nthings instead of get lost in them the\npleasure you receive from them will\nstart to decrease a little bit but the\ncool thing is that as you decrease that\npleasure your udics will actually\nincrease so we know from studies of\nmindfulness is that when we do any\nactivity mindfully our nucleus\nsuccumbent gets less activity it's less\npainful right so we'll use this for\nmindfulness for things like cancer\nrelated pain so it reduces the pain we\nexperience and it even reduces the\nhedonic pleasure we experience but what\nit does is it boosts our contentment so\nthis is exactly what we want to do and\nthe yogis have given us an answer which\nis to dissect the pleasure just observe\nit as much pleasure you want to engage\nin go for it but just observe where the\npleasure comes from and it'll blunt that\nnucleus accumbent response the last\nthing that I want to leave y'all with is\nsort of this core understanding that the\nyogis came to that motivation is a bad\nthing so I want youall to think about\nthis for a second the more motivated you\nare the harder it is to make a choice\nbecause if we think about what is\nmotivation I'm motivated I'm driven\nright so we'll even use the word I'm\ndriven to whatever because I'm highly\nmotivated so if you sort of think about\nit who's in control when you're highly\nmotivated I've worked with CEOs who are\nso motivated to work really hard they've\ngotten married and divorced three\nseparate times I've literally had to\ntake patients who had Eating Disorders\nwho were so motivated to avoid food that\nthey had to be strapped into a hospital\nbed and hooked up with IVs so they don't\nhave heart arrhythmias and die this is\nthe power of motivation\nbut when we get highly motivated we lose\nall control so the crazy thing is that\nas you move away from motivation what\nyou start to get in return is choice and\nnow I want youall to think back to a\ntime where you just had a good day where\nyou woke up in the morning and you\nweren't particularly motivated now we're\nnot talking about motivated to sit down\nand start playing games like the first\nthing when you wake up we're talking\nabout truly content and then you can\nkind of do whatever you want to that day\nif some someone suggests hey do you want\nto go for a hike and you're like yeah\nthat's fine I can do that or you can\nwake up and you're feeling relatively\ncontent you're like ah let me just go\nahead and take care of this work and\nthere isn't this internal struggle so\nthe crazy thing that the yogis ended up\ndiscovering is that motivation and\nchoice are also\nantagonistic and the more that you boost\nyour insula the more that your serotonin\nsignal increases the more you dionic you\nbecome the more freedom you have in life\nthat contentment and freedom actually\ncome hand in\nhand so I know it sounds bizarre and I\nknow that yall think you struggle with\nmotivation and you do struggle with\nmotivation but the problem isn't that\nyou have too little it's that you have\ntoo much and it's in the wrong direction\nso Free Yourself of that motivation and\nstart to make the right choices in life\none last thing that I want to share with\ny'all is how we leverage this principle\nof udics in our coaching program when I\nwas designing the program I started to\nlook into research about what helped\npeople feel content and what allowed\nthem them to flourish and it turns out\nthat this experience of flourishing and\ncontentment and also motivation not\nreally motivation but Freedom of Choice\nreally comes to things like discovering\na life purpose if you look at the\nscience of what activates the insula and\nwhat boosts that serotonin it is things\nlike discovering a purpose in life and\nthe cool thing is that's what our\ncoaching program really tries to focus\non it helps you sort of understand\nyourself\nunderstand your direction and help you\ngo there and the really cool thing is\nthat what we find is that as we increase\nthat purpose depression and anxiety\nstart to come down the the hedonistic\ndependence neuroscientifically starts to\nkind of come down as we start to build\non that purpose now the reason I built\nthis is because what I noticed as a\npsychiatrist is that we were focused so\nmuch on the depression and anxiety that\nwe were completely ignoring the ud\ndionic side of things and it turns out\nthat leaning into that substantially\nimproves people's lives so if yall are\ninterested check it out if you're not by\nall means do the practices that we\nshared with yall today around dissecting\npleasure and avoiding some amount of\npleasure as well hey all if you're\ninterested in applying some of the\nprinciples that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it
