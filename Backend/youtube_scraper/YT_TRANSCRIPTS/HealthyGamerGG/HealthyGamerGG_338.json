    "transcript": "sound kind of bizarre but it turns out\nthat the most important thing that you\ncan control for your own happiness is\nactually your thoughts and this may\nsound surprising because isn't happiness\nabout emotions because if I'm depressed\nand sad all the time and I wake up and I\nfeel ashamed of myself and I'm so\ndepressed and it's hard to get out of\nbed it's hard for me to be happy right\nthat makes perfect sense so isn't it\nabout emotion well it turns out that if\nyou look at research on Psychiatry and\nPsychotherapy that emotions are a big\npart of it but if if you really look at\nwhat we do in Psychotherapy it's not\njust fixing emotions in fact the goal is\nto decompress emotions so that you can\nhelp your patients start to think\nclearly and the real change that we see\nhappens when our patients start to think\nclearly and think in a healthier way"
