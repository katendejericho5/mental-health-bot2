    "transcript": "what problems does caffeine cause most\nof the problems that we actually see\nhave to do around diet and sugar so\nparadoxically one thing you can really\nthink about is if you're having trouble\neating a healthy diet and are vulnerable\nto highly processed foods with a very\nhigh nutrient density there is a chance\nthat cutting back on your caffeine will\nhelp you with that on the flip side we\nalso know that for people who are\nintermittent fasting for example they\nwill recommend caffeine intake early on\nin the morning or even into the\nafternoon to make it easier to tolerate\nthat sort of fasting window right so if\nyou're doing something like 186 and\nyou're awake for like 8 10 hours a day\nwithout eating caffeine can really be a\nuseful appetite stimulant in that way\nbut I'd say that the primary problem\nthat caffeine causes has to do with like\nmaking it difficult for us to regulate\nour blood sugar our sense of hunger and\nour cravings"
