let's get started welcome\nto another healthy gamer GG stream just\na reminder that although I am a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if yall have a concern or question\nplease go see a licensed\nprofessional um yeah so welcome\neverybody happy Monday happy December to\neveryone on in the universe and on the\nplanet we've got some cool stuff today\nlet me see what we have here okay we\nhave an announcement and we've got posts\nto talk about this is going to be hype\nokay so today we're going to be doing a\nReddit review and focused on male mental\nhealth which leads into our announcement\nso we\nare launching YouTube memberships so we\nare going to start using the memberships\nfeature on YouTube so people may wonder\nwhy on Earth are we doing this so there\nare a couple things that I want to talk\nto youall about the first is there are\ntwo challenges that I face making\ncontent and I'm hoping that memberships\nwill help with this the first is I do\nthe same stuff over and over and over\nagain this is not necessarily bad but if\nwe look at like HG on the whole we have\nalmost 2 million subscribers on YouTube\nwe get watched by about 5 million people\na month somewhere between two 2,000 and\n5,000 people join our community every\nweek and have questions for Dr K which\nis great but this also means that I\nstarted streaming four years ago and I\nanswering the same questions I was\nanswering four years ago which is cool\nbecause new people are joining and they\nhave the same questions they're really\nimportant questions that's fine the\nchallenge is that for me it's a little\nbit frustrating because I spent a lot of\ntime studying in India and studying\nneuroscience and Psychiatry and medicine\nand ayurva and all that good stuff and\nyoga and meditation\nand I never get to the advanced stuff so\nmemberships are for people who are\ninterested in more depth okay so they're\ngoing to be a little bit more applicable\nwe'll talk about how um and so B\nactually let's just talk about that now\nso what we're going to offer with our\nmembership is four lectures a month plus\nQ&A so these lectures are going to be\ndifferent from our standard YouTube or\nstream content this is the other problem\nthat is difficult about being a content\ncreator so here on YouTube we are at the\nmercy of the algorithm and what that\nmeans is that we've sort of noticed that\nwe have to make some compromises with\nthe content that we make our videos tend\nto be about 20 minutes long they have to\nbe sort of like focused on one thing\nthey can't assume that anyone knows\nanything right so every YouTube video\nhas to be started from scratch takes any\nperson on the internet who knows nothing\nabout nothing and we have to be able to\nlead them from A to Z so we hope to\nsolve this problem with membership\nso what we're going to offer is four\nlectures a month plus Q&A all of these\nwill be live streamed and the goal is to\ngive people 1hour lectures that are more\nacademic more applicable and more\nin-depth so I get to go full Professor\nmode for an hour and talk about nuances\nand research and all this kind of stuff\nokay each lecture probably takes me\nabout 6 to 8 hours to prepare um so that\nmeans that I'm spending about 24 to 32\nhours a month on this endeavor uh and\nthe other cool thing is it will not\nimpact any of the other content that we\nmake so we're going to continue\nreleasing free content via stream and\nYouTube and everything like that our\nDiscord remains completely intact this\nis an additional thing that we are\nadding for people who want more in-depth\napplicable stuff now the last thing that\nI think is very very exciting for me\nabout memberships is right now our\ncommunity and our content have been\nseparate so we'll make YouTube videos\nand sometimes I'll like I I read our\nsubreddit for example people will ask\nquestions on Discord and stuff like that\nbut so far these two things have been\nseparate the other thing that I'm super\nexcited about is y'all may be wondering\nokay which four lectures do I do every\nmonth and that's where y'all decide so\nthe cool thing about the the memberships\nfeature is that there's a there's a\ncommunity aspect to it so y'all\nbasically vote on whichever lectures you\nwant me to prepare and if you want me to\nprepare a meme lecture and that's at the\ntop of the list like Dr K explain thxx\nto us like what's actually the science\nspirituality like all this kind of stuff\nwe'll do it if yall want something that\nis very targeted or focused we'll\nactually do that too so y'all\ndecide what we're going to be learning\nand this is also something that I'm\nreally excited about because right now\nthe way that we make content is we kind\nof scratch our heads and we say to\nourselves okay like Dr K is excited\nabout this so I want to make a video\nabout this and then there's some aspect\nof okay we're going to randomly like\nscour the Internet and try to come up\nwith topics and people seem to be\ninterested in this so let's make a video\nabout it but y'all get to decide so\nthese are the key things that we're\nreally really focused on in terms of\nmemberships I've been looking for a way\nfor four years to make more in-depth\ncontent and that's where we have things\nlike the guides and the guides are\nawesome but the guides are like\nbasically I don't know if youall know\nthis but each guide requires me to\nessentially write a full nonfiction book\nlike the length of the guide uh the\nscripts for each guide is like the\nlength of basically a book so it was\ncrazy the first year I wrote three books\nlast year I wrote one I'm writing one\nnow I actually wrote an actual book\nsomewhere in there and the problem with\nthe guides is that they're not flexible\nright so the the production timeline for\na guide is basically about a year so the\ncool thing about memberships is y'all\nget to decide okay this week or this\nmonth we want to talk about this or we\nwant to talk about this or we want to\ntalk about this I want to keep our\ncontent flexible I want to keep it\napplicable and I want to make it more in\ndepth and I've been looking for that now\nsome people you know maybe wondering\nhave some questions about this and stuff\nlike that what about price we haven't\ntalked about price the price is 10 bucks\na month for our base healthy gamer tier\nand this is something that's kind of\ninteresting so we basically give yall\nall the value at the base tier that is\nsort of what we're about right so we try\nto make mental health content as\naccessible as possible so for 10 bucks a\nmonth you get four live streamed\nlectures of topics of your choosing that\nare an hour long plus Q&A with Dr K you\nalso get supporter stuff badges things\nlike that um there also going to be\nweekly quests related to the four\nlectures which you all can\ncomplete and then there's a second tier\nwhich is AOE healer which is $15 a month\n$4.99 and that's basically for people\nwho want to give us extra money um\nyou'll get access to some beta features\nfor things that we're developing and\ntools that we've built in the F past\nlike right in the fields emotion\ntrackers and stuff like that so you may\nget early access to stuff but we're\ngoing to be super transparent that the\nbase tier is where the value is and the\nadditional tier is for people who want\nto give us money and I know that sounds\nkind of bizarre I know it sounds bizarre\nbut for four years people have been\nsaying Dr K start a patreon Dr K do this\nhey Dr K why don't you do sabatons we've\ndone very very limited amounts of\nfundraising from our community and\nsabatons and patreon and stuff like that\nI know there are things out there that\ncan allow y'all to give us more money\nwhich is cool like don't get me wrong\nbut to be completely honest I've been\nreluctant to do any of those things for\nabout 4 years simply because for me like\nif yall are giving us money there should\nbe some value towards it it doesn't\nnecessarily need to be towards yourself\nso like sometimes we've done fundraising\nand things like that which is totally\nfine but like we want to be very clear\nabout what you're giving us money for\nand so this is just a tier that like\nliterally sometimes like one time I got\nan email from someone who is like hey\ncan I send you this pile of money and I\nwas like no you cannot and then they\nfound a way to send some anyway but\nanyway that's neither here nor there but\nlike this is where you know if yall want\nto give us money and support the work\nthat we do if you want to give us\nadditional funding so that we can build\nmore free tools build more YouTube\nvideos things like that then y'all can\ngive us that money but that's really\nwhat the second tier is for you'll get\naccess to some early features like maybe\nmaybe some beta stuff things like that\nbut really yall should do it because you\nwant to support the work that we're\ndoing and for no other reason or well I\nguess other reasons are fine but that's\nreally what we built it around so\nbasically 10 bucks a month four lectures\nchosen by you plus Q&A I will build\nwhatever yall want me to build and for\nthose of you that don't have the\ndisposable income for that or don't want\nto which is totally fine yall do you we\nwill continue with our current rate of\nbasically free mental health content on\nthe internet so this does not compromise\nanything it's for those of y'all that\nwant to listen to Dr K pontificate on a\nnumber of things okay now a couple of\nother\nthings um\nso for the first month we are going to\nfocus on male mental health now this is\nreally important to understand this is\nnot a membership for men this is a\nmembership for everyone in our community\nand we try really hard to make content\nas inclusive and as applicable as\npossible at the same time when we PLL\nour community the most common topic that\nwe sort of get that we have not done is\nactually like male mental health so\nspecific stuff on male mental health the\nreason that we're doing this in the\nfirst month is because the voting has\nnot opened yet so we sort of informally\npulled the community we picked one thing\nso that you know what you're getting in\nthe first month but it is not our goal\nto have this membership be exclusively\nfor men and in fact we encourage\neveryone who's not interested in male\nmental health to go ahead and join\nanyway so that you tell us what to build\nand if yall tell me hey Dr K now that\nyou've done male mental health we want\nyou to do a lecture on autism and\ncomputer developers and are programmers\nmore likely to be autistic what do you\ndo if you're autistic and you're a\nprogrammer and you're having trouble\nyall basically get to decide so we want\neveryone who wants to to join and then\ny'all will steer what this membership\nbecomes and who it's for okay so the\nfour lectures we're going to do this\nmonth because we needed to prep them\nahead of time right so it like takes a\nwhile so we don't want to like start the\nmembership and then by the way the first\nlecture is in two days okay we didn't\nwant to start the membership and have\nyouall be like hey this month you can\njoin our membership ship and you get the\nability to vote for what happens 30 days\nfrom now so we wanted right out of the\ngate to give youall something that is\nhigh value so our four lectures are\ngoing to be a little bit scary number\none is privilege and expectation so how\ncan we understand men privilege and the\nexpectations that we put on men so this\nmay be a slightly more charged topic\nwhich is totally fine so that's what we\nwe're going to kind of do sometimes in\nmemberships all tell me if you want me\nto talk about something controversial\nI'll talk about something that's\ncontroversial um so we're going to talk\na little bit about really understanding\nsome of the science and sort of clinical\nperspective around like what does it\nmean to be privileged what are the\nexpectations that we place on men and\nsome somewhere once we sort of dig into\nthat we will discover some really scary\nthings that men struggle with so that\nlecture is going to be about how to\nmanage and deal with expectations of\nbeing a man so if you're a man as well\nas a woman or anyone else you're going\ngoing to have a set of expectations the\nchallenge is that as men the\nexpectations that are placed on us are\nincreasingly harder to meet right so for\nexample if you look at women I think\nlast time I checked more than 50% of\nwomen in heteronormative relationships\nwant their partner to make more money\nthan they\ndo the problem though is that as there's\nequality that's developing in the\nworkforce more than 50% of college\nstudents are are women now this is an\nexpectation that has be increasingly\ndifficult to meet so how do you navigate\na world as a man when that expects a lot\nof you and then but the world is not set\nup for you to meet them so our\nexpectations are somewhat outdated so\nthere's going to be a lot about that\nsecond thing that we're going to talk\nabout second lecture is going to be\nemotions for men so this is where I know\nit sounds kind of weird but we did a\nvideo which kind of went viral about why\ntherapy sucks for men and I know that\nthat's weird because here I am a\npsychiatrist talking about it but that's\nwhat I've observed so there's a lot of\nactually biases in what we assume to be\nobjective about emotions and a lot of\neven the language that we\nuse for emotions is actually biased in\nmy opinion a little bit towards women\nand this is not like women's fault or\nanything like that this is just if you\nlook at the\n70% of patients historically are women\n70% of therapists or women a lot of the\nresearch that we've done is not\nbasically specifically on men and so as\na result like men have a different way\nthat they deal with their emotions so\nunderstanding your experience of\nemotions is different how you manage\nemotions is different there's some inter\nreally interesting biology we'll talk\nabout a little bit today uh lecture\nnumber three is going to be healthy\nmasculinity so understanding toxic and\nhealthy masculinity where does toxic\nmasculinity come from where does healthy\nmasculinity come from how do you\ntransition from one to the other last\nthing that we're going to talk about is\nmale perspectives on depression so as\nwe're going to touch on that today\nactually so we're going to we've got a\ncouple posts about it but there's going\nto be a whole lecture on why depression\nis different in men okay and it's very\ndifferent so um wait it's not\npre-recorded\nno no dude we're going live baby it's\nlive\nokay uh yeah so membership will yeah\nvods will be available absolutely so\nhere's the thing there's no so here's\nhere's why I want to do this for those\nof y'all that become members I want yall\nto watch all the lectures or at least be\nfamiliar with them and the reason that I\nwant yall to watch all the lectures is\nso that next month I can assume that\ny'all have watched everything in the\npast and therefore I can build on stuff\nokay so for example if y'all want to do\na deep dive into meditation or yall want\nto do one lecture a month that is like\nkind of sequential for like like eight\nweeks of Dr K teaches fundamentals of\nmeditation we can do that right that's\nthe that's really the goal is that I'm\nfrankly I enjoy it but I hate to say\nthat I'm tired that basically since I\nstarted streaming I've only gotten to\nshare about 15% of like what I know and\nwhat I truly want to share and what I\nthink y'all need and the reason for that\nis because like you have to everyone has\nto know the 15% before we go to like 30%\nor 45% or 60% or whatever and we tried\nto do that with a workshop which was\nfantastic so like we did a workshop on\ntrauma which had 200 spots that sold out\nin 24 hours and 96% of the people in the\nworkshop said that they would sign up\nfor another one at the end of the\nworkshop so that went fantastic the\nproblem is like it just doesn't scale so\nwe're still planning on doing more\nworkshops and stuff like that we got to\nfigure out what to do about that because\nthe workshop was great it was really I\nmean that's not me saying this I loved\nit I loved teaching it and towards the\nend we got like really off the rails in\na really good way about the nature of\nwhat we are as human beings and I think\nsome people got it which is great\nso um yes 15% look y'all yall got to\nunderstand this\nokay I'm gonna just take\nthis all right so this is just this is\njust like five of the books okay I've\ngot like three 00 books in my in my room\nand like we haven't even\ntouched right is a a sect on I mean as a\nSE an exploration of spirituality that\nwe haven't even touched we've touched\nthis one I've taught about 15 to 20% of\nthis one and what else is good yeah\nyogic management of asthma and diabetes\nwe haven't really done that you guys\nhave gotten a good chunk of this one\nthis is a book about some of the\nmeditations that I teach her from there\nbut that's the thing like we're just\ngetting\nstarted and so like I can make a guide\nonce a year but like that that takes a\nlot and the problem is that like if you\nguys want to if you need something now\nso here's what's going on we've been\nworking on a guide right this is what's\nbizarre so we started this like [ __ ]\nlike eight months ago and then we're\ngoing to like film hopefully sometime in\nfingers crossed knock on wood\nJanuary and then like the problem is\nlike y'all are struggling now like hell\nthe whole reason that I started\nstreaming was because people can't wait\nyall get that like Society is getting\nscrewed today so when I was like I got\ntwo really fantastic job offers from two\namazing human beings just really awesome\nmentors and they were like in 10 years\nlike you'll be the expert and I'm like\ngreat you can get these you can get this\nfunding you can get this grant for like\n$5 million then we can apply for this\nGrant and then like you can do this and\nyou can do this and I was like broh\npeople are on The Struggle Bus like\ntoday like I don't know that people can\nwait\nright and and so like there's more to\nlearn y'all there is so much more to\nlearn and I want to teach it to you like\nthis is the thing I realized a couple\nyears ago that I'm mortal and this is\nthis is a weird\nrealization and so what I realized is\nlike okay so if I'm mortal like we got\nto get this show on the road we've been\ndoing this for four years and we got to\nlike 10% within year one and then May\nmaybe an additional 5% in the last 3\nyears and so we got to like y'all\nthere's just it's it's liberating how\nmuch dude there's so much good stuff to\nunderstand stuff about your body stuff\nabout your brain stuff about your mind\nstuff about the nature of Happiness\nKarma understanding your karma how how\nto develop a healthy sense of identity\nthere's just so much stuff out\nthere and like you know as much as I\nlove YouTube and it's great like I love\nbeing able to stream this with y'all\nwe're going to cover a lot of good stuff\nthere's there's a lot of great work that\nwe're doing and it is insufficient so\nfor those of y'all that want more want\nmore in-depth and want like\nopportunities for Q&A and things like\nthat for y'all to direct our content as\na community that's what I'm excited\nabout\num Dr K is lit starting a stealth\ncollege program at a snails pace yes\nyou're damn right I am so here's the\nthing this isn't like college though\nthis is stuff that everyone should be\nlearning okay there's a fascinating\nstudy the state of New York I think New\nYork Department of Education did about\nteaching kids social and emotional\nskills and when they teach it formally\nas a class like it's worth 11\npoints in terms of\ngrades you know all that crap when\nyou've got a group project and you're\nlike oh my God I have to find a partner\nand then since you're not socially adapt\nlike you don't have first choice and no\none asks you so you end up like with the\ndrgs because hey you're the dregs too\nright and then what happens is you end\nup with someone who's mentally checked\nout more mentally checked out than you\nare and this is what happens in a group\nproject when you're one of the bottom\npeople in the group project that doesn't\nhave all these people that you're\nalready working with what happens is\nthere's a very quick assessment right I\nknow this because I've done this where\nit's you and the other two people that\ndon't have group members what y'all\nquickly do is assess which one of us is\nthe most degenerate which one is the\nleast degenerate and the two people who\nare more degenerate will turn to the\nperson who is the least degenerate and\nthen that person becomes the leader and\nif you're the leader then you're\nresponsible for everything and then\nyou're [ __ ] lazy to begin with but\nthen what happens is you got to Wrangle\nthese other two noobs who are even\nlazier than you\nare and so then what happened is the the\nNew York I think Department of Education\nwas like hey let's teach people how to\nsocialize when they did that group\nprojects I imagine became way\nbetter\nright and now here we are a bunch of\nrejects who never got picked for group\nprojects and we are a force on the\ninternet let's\ngo but we're going to we're going to\nteach\nyall ourselves maybe I need to learn it\ntoo how to be like better at\nlife am I right and the only difference\nbetween me and you is I'm the least\ndegenerate here\nmaybe maybe I'm sure there's actually\npeople who are less more I mean less\ndegenerate than I am but I'm I'm the\nwho's taking the lead because all y'all\nare just looking at me and be like okay\nI this guy's the least degenerate so I'm\nlike okay the only reason I'm the least\ndegenera is probably because of\nage but it's it's crazy so I I I did a a\ntalk recently a couple weeks ago and\nthere this was at a place that is quite\nfamous that a lot of you know\nhardworking people end up\nat and um and I was amazed by like how\nhow awesome our community is like I I\nview our commity is a bunch of\ndegenerates but we're not really like\nwe're actually pretty [ __ ] epic and\nso I just continuously impressed by\npeople who are just knocking it out of\nthe\npark\num\nyeah it's because of Harvard I don't\nthink so to be\nhonest see here's the thing about\nHarvard you don't become a Chad at\nHarvard they only select Chads to begin\nwith that's their that's their\nangle uh no I don't feel bad for bra I\njust I'm just humbled by seriously like\nhow amazing some people in our community\nare I got asked to like review someone's\npersonal statement and they're and I was\nlooking at their resume and they're like\nmore qualified than I am and I was like\nall right I guess you're applying to med\nschool but you're more successful than I\nam in terms of like Publications it's\nawesome it's great\nplease talk about the first stream it's\non Wednesday yeah so we're starting this\non Wednesday so Wednesday we're going to\nstart we're going to dive into privilege\nand expectation as a man so what does it\nmean to be\nprivileged how do you deal with all the\nexpectations that life puts on you we're\nstarting Wednesday like the lecture is\nready to go\nchat\nokay Ash welcome to live stream let's\ngive Ash a good experience what's the\ndifference between the two tiers\nso both tiers get all the content\nbasically the second tier is for two\nspecific things first the second tier is\nif you want to give us more money you\ncan just give us more money that's what\nthe second tier is for but we were\nreally really it was really important to\nus to not try to\ngatekeep the really high value stuff\nbehind a pay wall of five additional\ndollars so we try to give the the stuff\nat the base tier and the second tier you\nget access to some beta tools and things\nlike right in the right in the fields\nwhich is a community event so like\nonline tools and stuff you'll get access\nto that but it's basically if yall\nsupport the work that we do we're giving\nyou the option if y'all have extra\ndisposable income of five bucks a month\nyou can give it to us and I hope that's\nokay to be transparent about that like\nthat's what the tier is for and we've\njust we haven't done things like we\ndon't usually do things like sabatons\nand patreon and stuff like that maybe\nwe'll do it one day I don't know but\nwe've held back on\npeople giving us money and that\nchanges um it'll be recorded yeah okay\nwhy are we all depressed let's talk\nabout\nit\num yeah but the value you know the the\nvalues at the base tier\nokay let's look at\nposts all right\nthe way people talk about men it makes\nme feel like very few men are considered\nattractive the general idea from the\nmost blue pilled people online is that\nif you have a good personality and click\nwith someone you can find a good\nrelationship over time you might become\nattractive to someone because of your\npersonality okay but what about the\nphysical part the raw sexual part are\nmen not attractive visually at first it\nseems like men are expected to become\nattractive over time despite their looks\nnot because of them in part obviously\nit's not all looks everyone wants to be\nliked by their personality as well I'm\nsorry but I am a very sexual ooh very\nphysical and visual I want to be a\nreally attractive guy physically I\nunderstand people have different\nopinions on what is beautiful or not but\nI sorry I don't accept this extremely\npessimistic view people here have about\nmen I'm confused about what's the what's\nthe pessimistic view I'm confused\nanyway so very few men are considered\nattractive so let's understand\nthis so are very few men\nattractive so let's understand a couple\nof things the first is that from a very\nyoung age okay so I'm going to make some\ngeneral statements about genders this is\nnot meant to be discriminatory we can\njust look at research okay about how men\nand women are raised differently and\nfrom a young age women are conditioned\nto be careful about their appearance so\nfrom a very young age right so it's it's\nnot how does this conditioning happen if\nyou look at\nSociety women are more likely to wear\nmakeup than men women are more likely to\nget their nails painted than men this is\nthis is changing now but this is\nbasically historically how Society has\nbeen so imagine that you're a 2-year-old\ngirl versus a 2-year-old boy and you\nhave a daddy and you have a mommy and\nmommy starts getting ready for something\nan hour ahead of time and does makeup\nand gets her nails done and things like\nthat right this happens in my own\nhousehold and so if you're a young woman\nif you're a girl growing up what do you\nget conditioned towards you get\nconditioned towards your appearance is\nvery important and that appearance is\nsomething that should you should devote\na lot of time and craftsmanship has a\nwhole set of like accessories that you\nneed to learn to use at some\npoint when when it comes to men in\nappearance we are not conditioned to\ntake care for our appearance hell when I\nwas growing up I was like ready to start\nshaving so people started making fun of\nme at school but like my dad never took\nme aside and was like hey it's time to\nstart\nshaving and so I I remember I I talked\nto my dad and I was like Hey Dad like I\nthink I should start shaving and he's\nlike okay go for it and I was like are\nyou gonna I didn't ask but he was like\nyou know here's the stuff go shave and I\nwas like are you going to teach me and\nhe's like no if you run into any trouble\njust like let me know I'm here in the\nother room and like I'll help you if you\nrun into trouble and I was like all\nright right so that was my upbringing\nbut I think a lot of men are like I\nwasn't taught how to style my hair I\nwasn't taught how to shop I wasn't\ntaught how to do anything really when it\ncomes to personal\nappearance and so if we look at like you\nknow why are\nmen unattractive I think the biggest\ndifference between men and women is that\nwomen actually like give a [ __ ] about\ntheir appearance and they get taught\nAndor learn how to take care of their\nappearance so that's the first thing is\nlike as dudes like we just know get\ntaught this stuff and now there's like\nall this different kind of you know male\nlike it started with metrosexuals where\nit's like dudes started taking care\nabout their appearance I think it's a\ngood thing you know traditionally we've\nbeen into exercise as men but we don't\nreally like care too much about how we\nstyle our hair or like whatever I mean\nsome people do right we've got barber\nshops and stuff like that but men just\ndon't take as much care about their\nappearance second thing is that I think\nthat what people consider attractive is\nhighly variable and I don't know the\ndata on this but you know a lot of the\nwomen that I've worked with and patients\nof mine and men tend to look for\ndifferent things that I've seen so this\nisn't like well res researched right so\nI I I'm hesitant to make generalizations\nbut I think oftentimes what we consider\nattractive as men is different from what\nwomen consider attractive so men and\nwomen just have different preferences\nwhen it comes to attraction so sometimes\nwomen are looking for some someone who's\na little bit more caring or has a a\nparticular kind of personality or\nwhatever maybe just the bar is lower in\nterms of physical appearance for\nmen it's hard to say but I think the\nbiggest thing to consider I as to why\nmen are often times not attractive I\nthink there are a couple things one is\nthat we're not conditioned to it I think\na second thing that tends to happen with\nmen is that people don't complement\nmen's appearances very often so men\ndon't complement men's appearances right\nso I grew up in a a time where any kind\nof positive affection or even comment in\nthe Physical Realm about another dude\nlabeled one as homosexual so I grew up\nin a highly homophobic environment and\nso we were like taught not to ever say\nanything nice heaven forbid you say that\na Dude Looks attractive like oh my God\nthat means that you're gay oh my God we\ncan't have\nthat and so I think the other thing that\ntends to happen is that men don't get\ncompliments so we don't feel attractive\nand if we never get positive\nreinforcement we're not going to go out\nof our way to look attractive and part\nof the reason that we never get\ncompliments is not it's not just women's\nfault or other men's fault it's because\nfrequently we as men get confused when\nsomeone compliments us because we as men\nsometimes get confused this person is\ncomplimenting my appearance when I\ncomplement someone's appearance that\nmeans that I'm attracted to them and\nwant to sleep with them so if they are\ncomplimenting my appearance that means\nthat they must want to sleep with me so\na lot of women that I've talked to get\ninto big trouble by trying to offer even\nsimple kindness towards men because that\ngets interpreted in a weird way on the\nflip side a lot of the men that I work\nwith who get\ncomplimented they are just so stared\nfrom any for any iota of affection or\nattention that even a tiny bit of\nkindness fills them up with all of these\ndifferent feelings that they don't know\nhow to\nhandle and when you kind of put this\ntogether it becomes hard to compliment\nmen we as men don't do it to each other\nwe feel kind of weird like is this guy\nhitting on me if he says that my hair\nlooks good like oh my God and if a woman\nsays something nice to us often times\nthey tried that a little while and then\nyou know once they complimented the\nwrong person they got a dickpick and\nthen even if it's only like 10% of the\ntime but like if you're nice to 10\npeople and one of them sends you a\ndickpick that's only going to need to\nhappen once or twice before you learn\nyour lesson in the worst case scenarios\nwe get people who are like stalkers and\nlike don't know how to take no for an\nanswer and all this kind kind of stuff\nso it's challenging I think it's\nchallenging on both\nsides not blaming men and I'm not\nblaming women the truth of the matter is\nthat it's hard for men to be attractive\nbecause we it's hard for us to get\ncompliments it's hard for us to give\ncompliments we're not taught about our\nappearance\nand it can be embarrassing right as a\ndude like it's so embarrassing to start\nfocusing on your appearance you feel\nlike an idiot like what are you going to\ndo like walk into a Sephora and buy\nsomething like it's so\nhard so I I I think it's common for men\nto feel\nunattractive and then I think the other\nthing is we do have all this whole idea\nof like oh you know like relationships\nare more are more than just looks which\nI think is\ntrue so yeah I mean I I don't think\nthat I think it's very common for men to\nnot feel attractive and for us to not\nput in a whole lot of effort into our\nappearance I mean hell like this is a\nt-shirt from Amazon and this is I don't\nknow what but I've had this for like\nfive years I woke up a shaved kind of\nsort of did my hair a little bit but\nthat's the end of it brush my\nteeth right we don't spend a whole lot\nof time on\nit\nquestions\nokay so there's a great question here\nhey do there Dr K I just have a question\nfor maybe a later talk as a child\ngrowing up I was the only boy in the\nhouse and was always told that I'm the\nman of the house so I need to do this or\nthat so that's what our first lecture in\ntwo days is about managing expectations\nas a man so often times what happens so\nI once had a patient\nwho was I think 19 years old and was in\njail and I asked the patient you know\nhow'd you end up here and they they were\nuh in jail for like a their nth\npossession charge with intent to\ndistribute because they sold drugs for a\nliving and I asked them how did you get\ninto selling drugs so they said that\nwhen they were about 12 years old they\nwere in a household with their two\nsisters and their mom and their dad\nleft and so what happened is Mom and two\nsisters said you're now the man of the\nhouse and what a man does is provide to\na\n12-year-old and so the 12-year-old was\nlike I don't know how to provide and\nthere's one way that 12-year-olds are\nable to provide for their family is\nactually to sell drugs so they started\nselling drugs at the age of 12 and so\ngot picked up for a couple of juvie\npossessions over the course of you know\nfive or six years because hey when\nyou're 12 you suck at selling drugs and\nit's not like there's an older Mentor\nwho has your best interests at heart\nwho's teaching you and then finally they\ngot picked up when they at some point\npast the age of 18 and then they're no\nlonger protected by being a juvenile so\nthey wind up in\njail so how do you navigate these kinds\nof challenges of being a man like what\ndo you do right when people say you're a\nman and a man's job is XYZ how do you\nfigure out if that's right or wrong\nbecause I don't think that they're\nalways wrong and that story by the way\nis not an attempt to demonize women just\nFYI it's just that was that particular\ncircumstance I have plenty of stories\nwhere dudes are the bad\nguys okay so it's not like this we got\nto be careful about on the\ninternet but that's what happens is a\nlot of times so here's here's the tldr\nso we're doing a whole hourong lecture\non it okay but here's the\ntldr so when someone places expectations\nupon you as a Man true of women\ntoo if you live your\nlife to satisfy the expectations of\nothers you will not be in control of\nyour life I'm not saying it's good I'm\nnot saying it's bad I'm not placing a\nvalue judgment on it I'm being a little\nbit scientific about it let's just\nunderstand so if I'm a man and my job\neveryone turns to me and says Dr K as a\nman you need to do this to be a man and\nif I'm living my life to make them happy\nI lose control I'm not saying it's bad\nI'm saying that I lose control because\nnow suddenly they are the ones that are\ntelling me what the targets I need to\nhit are same is true for women by the\nway too we just expect different things\nof women when are you going to have\nbabies are you having babies yet when\nare you going to have babies are you not\na mother oh the joy of being a mother is\nsomething that you'll never experience\nin life like I want to have babies I\nwant you to have\nbabies right dudes are happy to want to\nbe dads is they don't have to be\npregnant\nright and so the key thing to understand\nis that when society places certain\nexpectations on you whether you're a man\nor a\nwoman you have to decide which of those\nexpectations you want to\ninternalize because if you try to just\ndo what a man is supposed to do or what\na woman is supposed to do then you'll\nlose control of your life because you're\nsetting you're you're playing somebody\nelse's game and so how does one go about\ndoing that that's what we're going to\ntalk about on\nWednesday right and and the real tragedy\nhere is that as we try to live up to\nothers expectations we lose control of\nour own life sometimes you can never\nmake other people happy right because\neveryone is all for you doing\nsomething without them working right so\ngetting pregnant is a good example of\nthis but they're like a man provides\nwhat does that mean about our\nrelationship that means I stay home you\ngo out there and work so everyone is\nvery willing to sign you up to do stuff\nand what's happened in today's society\nis that when people sign you up to do\nstuff they've come up with a beautiful\nset of wrapping paper right so we wrap\nthis [ __ ] sandwich up in this beautiful\nwrapping paper of masculinity and we say\nhey if you're a man if you want to be a\ngood man if you want to be a high value\nman if you want to be this kind of man\nif you want to be a real man then you\nmake this sacrifice it's a [ __ ] sandwich\nwrapped in something\nbeautiful and so what can ends up\nhappening and we'll get to this in a\nlittle bit maybe we can jump to it now\nis that man are kind of stuck in this\nsituation which is one of the reasons\nwhy we have such high so high suicide\nrates which what we can talk about what\nis this lecture you keep mentioning okay\nso I'll explain see this is exactly what\nI'm talking about\nso when you're a live streamer you got\nto answer the same questions over and\nover and over again no no offense to\nanyone who's just joining it's great\nthat yall join but we're launching\nYouTube memberships here's the 32nd bit\nso reason we're launching memberships is\nto offer more in-depth lectures plus Q&A\nevery month this is in addition to our\nnormal content which will\ncontinue we'll continue that so for 10\nbucks a month we're going to do four\nlectures that are 1 hour along so more\nin-depth more applicable they can even\nbe things like skills workshops if\nthat's what youall want so like Dr K we\nwant to learn in-depth meditation\nwhatever the cool thing about the\nlectures is y'all decide so members vote\nevery month about what the next four\nlectures are going to be and we're going\nto take the topics that you want us to\nteach about I'm going to spend six to\neight hours preparing a lecture plus Q&A\non topics of your choice they're going\nto be more advanced and in-depth so more\nscience more application more Nuance not\na 20-minute YouTube video for for 10\nbucks a month 15 bucks a month if you\nwant to give us additional money and get\naccess to Beta features you all everyone\ngets Badges and stuff like that like\nsupporter kind of stuff that's what\nwe're offering\nokay women and men both have their own\nstruggles and what I would love is for\nso the first month we're going to focus\non male mental health just because we\nalready pulled the community and that's\nwhat floated to the top but I would love\nto do a month on women's mental health\nor any number of other topics whatever\ny'all decide so the only reason we're\nlaunching with this is because\nwe didn't want to launch and then have\nyall vote and then like wait a month to\nput together\nstuff\num\nokay uh Hey as a girlfriend I have a\nquestion I understand that expectations\nplay a big part in why men feel bad\nabout themselves but can't feeling bad\nabout yourself give less motivation to\nget better what a great question so\nlet's understand this okay\nwe're also going to cover this in a\nlecture but so let's\nunderstand what the impact of feeling\nbad on your about yourself\nis so all of our brains are wired to\nexperience negative emotions things like\nshame guilt fear so if you sort of think\nabout it why do we feel\nashamed like what's the purpose of that\nso shame is a powerful emotion some\nPsych olist even call shame the master\nemotion because shame is the emotion\nthat we tend to avoid the most in life\nright we will structure our whole lives\naround avoiding feeling\nshame it controls us even if we don't\nfeel it the trying not to feel it\ncontrols our\nlife so now the tricky thing about\nemotions is if you look at the\nbrain emotions in some decent quantity\nwill actually motivate positive behavior\nso the reason that we feel shame is to\nencourage the right kind of behavior\nright so back when we were tribes of 300\npeople if we didn't do something right\nif we stole let's say from somebody else\nthe whole tribe of 300 shames us and\nwhen they shame us Shame\nShame we're never going to steal again\nthat's the purpose of\nShame now the problem is that when shame\nbecomes so powerful it actually induces\na lack of motivation which is normally\nwhat shame is supposed to do so the\nfirst thing that happens when we feel\nshame is we want to lay low so it is\nprotective for shame to isolate us\nbecause when everyone's mad at us we\ndon't want to be noticed we want to\ndisappear from the world right so we're\na little bit quieter we don't talk we\ndon't defend ourselves we Retreat and if\nwe think about it from an Adaptive\nperspective if we Retreat and we're kind\nof like out of the public eye in our\ntribe they're going to end up getting\npissed at someone else and then we can\nresurface so shame is isolating as an\nadaptation now the problem in modern\nsociety is that shame gets we get\nscrewed by shame in a couple of ways the\nfirst is if we continuously feel shame\nwe will continuously be\nisolated and now we run into the real\nproblem is that shame is\ntriggered by all kinds of things that it\nwas never designed to be triggered by\nshame is supposed to be triggered by\nother human\nbeings but today it is triggered by a\nthousand things that are not other human\nbeings The Internet Is Not a Human\nBeing social media is not a human\nbeing this is what's so\ntricky is that now in our current\nenvironment we get overwhelmed by shame\nbecause it's triggered by all of these\nproxy human beings like people posting\non social media and then the second\nproblem is as we get bombarded by shame\nover and over and over and over again on\na daily basis it causes us to isolate\nisolate isolate isolate and then the\nlast problem is remember shame is\nsupposed to correct our behavior in the\nright way the problem is that on the\ninternet we get we see\nversions of correction that are\nimpossible now what does that mean so if\nI feel ashamed by the way that I look\nand I'm with my tribe of 300 people and\nwe have a swimming contest there's one\nperson out there who is the most swole\nof them all but it's like a sample size\nof 300 that includes K kids and the\nelderly but nowadays when I look on\nsocial media there's someone who's a\nprofessional bodybuilder or professional\ninfluencer who spends three hours a day\non their appearance that is not\nsomething we can actually correct\ntowards so this is the other problem\nwith shame when we feel ashamed by\nsomething on the Internet our brain\ncannot see a path to actually achieve\nthat and then we feel paralyzed because\non the one hand we feel this is what I\nshould become and on the other hand we\nlook at this person we say this is\nimpossible for me so then what do I end\nup doing absolutely\nnothing so what's happened is shame has\nstopped fulfilling its core purpose and\ninstead has become something that is\ncrippling for\nus does that make\nsense why does shame arise when when\nother people are not shaming us because\nof what it's triggered\nby right so shame is Tri triggered by a\ngap in where you are and where you think\nyou should be that is literally what\nshame is okay I should be here I am here\nboom shame and now even without people\nall you have to do is see other people\ndoing the stuff that you want to do and\nthat'll trigger shame because it notices\na gap and what do you do if you really\npay attention this is what you'll\ndiscover\nanytime you experience shame you are\ngoing to be making a\ncomparison wow look at this person is\nthis way but I am this\nway and we have people out there whose\njob it is to be the best version of a\nparticular thing that's literally their\njob if you're like an influencer right\nlike a fitness influencer or a wellness\ninfluencer and part of the model is make\nyou feel ashamed of yourself and this is\nwhat advertisers have figured out the\nmore shame they can create in you the\nmore you're going to spend\nmoney right oh you feel sad about the\nway that your hair is buy this product\nand your hair will look\nbetter oh how do use shame and turn it\ninto something positive like Alchemy we\nhave a couple of videos about\nthat um I don't know exactly where they\nare but they're on YouTube I think we've\ngot some on shame for\nsure and we're going to cover more on\nthat there there's a lecture on emotions\n101 for men definitely going to talk a\nlot about shame as well as the\ndepression lecture is going to be a lot\nabout shame all right but we've got\nother\nstuff oh my God my God\nokay oh this is a good one okay let's\ntalk about\nthis all right next up why is depression\nand anxiety more common in women but\nsuicide rates are higher for men okay so\nlet's understand something about suicide\nokay by the way the other reason that\nwe're doing some of these lectures is\nthat some of the topics that we want to\ncover will get at a minimum demonetized\nand sometimes delisted on YouTube\nbecause they relate to like suicide so\nyou can't like make a video on it's very\nhard to make videos on suicide and\nmental health on YouTube it's not\nYouTube's fault for the record I I don't\nI they're just trying to protect their\npopulace and there's this weird virality\nwith suicidal content that then people\nwill actually start killing themselves\nand it's a whole mess but one of the\nreasons is we want to just get free from\nsome of those\nconstraints but let's talk\nabout why is depression and anxiety\nhigher in women but suicides are higher\nin men so let's understand a couple\nthings about statistics the first is\nsuicide attempts are much more in women\ncompleted suicides are much more likely\nin men I want to say that attempted\nsuicide is three to four times as common\nin women than it is in men and completed\nsuicide is about four times as common in\nmen than it is in women so women try to\ncommit commit suicide\nmore men actually succeed at committing\nsuicide more now the question is why is\nthis so there are a number of different\nhypotheses and these are the ones that I\nkind of put my money in the first is\nthat women are more likely to engage in\nwhat we call suicidal gestures so for\nexample borderline personality uh\ndisorder is more likely to be diagnosed\nin women and women who have BPD are more\nlikely to engage in sud Su suicidal\nBehavior so for example cutting or\nsomething like that which isn't actually\nsuicidal but from the outside we're not\nreally sure what that is it freaks\npeople out we call 911 they go to the\nemergency room which is absolutely the\nright thing to do given the\nsituation and then this sort of gets\nlogged as a suicide attempt so sometimes\nthere is suicidal Behavior or\nself-injurious behavior which is more\ncommon the second thing that tends to\nhappen has to do with the\nmeans so women are more likely to\nattempt suicide with non-lethal means\nnow you may say Dr K what does that mean\nnon-lethal means what the hell does that\nmean non-lethal suicide that means is\nthings like overdosing on pills so\noverdosing on pills is something that we\ncan save someone from we can pump your\nstomach get the medication out there you\ncan get hospitalized in the ICU and we\ncan ride you through an overdose so\nwe're more capable of saving lives based\non the poison of choice for women\nbasically the second thing is that women\nare much more likely to\ncommunicate when they are attemp\nattempting suicide that one I don't have\na clear reference for but that's\nsomething that I I has been my\nexperience so they'll do something like\nI'll take a bunch of pills and I will\ntext someone and I'll say goodbye and\nthen what happens is that gives the\nother person an opportunity to alert\nmental health support and and you know\ncall emergency services and we're able\nto save a life so this is one of these\nare one of the reasons why I think women\nare more likely to attempt suicide and\nsurvive it as opposed to men so men tend\nto be a lot more crafty when they decide\nto kill themselves their heart is really\nin it they will calculate a lot more and\nthey will choose means that are harder\nto recover from like things like\ngunshots so it's like hard to survive if\nyou shoot\nyourself I think there's more to the\nequation though because part of the\nproblem is that our system of\ndiagnosis will catch women who are quote\nunquote mentally ill better than it will\ncatch men and often times what happens\nis that men who are quote unquote\nmentally ill don't look like they have\nmental illness because our definitions\nof mental illness are not male Centric\nthey're actually female Centric and this\nis not me just saying this so like this\nis a great paper hypothesis of gender\ndifferences in self-reporting symptoms\nof depression implication to solve\nunderdiagnosis and under treatment of\ndepressions in males so we know this um\ngender differences in a in a cohort of\nmajor depressive patients further\nevidence for a the male depression\nsyndrome\nhypothesis so there there is actually a\nlot of research that suggests that the\nway that we diagnose mental illness is\nnot based on men that men experience\nmental illnesses in different ways and\nwe all oftentimes get misdiagnosed or\nnot diagnosed at all which is why up to\n50% of men who kill themselves have no\nhistory of mental\nillness now this could mean that they\nhave an undiagnosed mental illness or\nwhich I think is shockingly true much of\nthe time is that people men who try to\ncommit suicide or commit suicide were\nnot mentally ill in the first place\nwhich I know sounds crazy but this has\nbeen studied in the literature as\nwell this is not people who\nare this is not people who are mentally\nill they're just they decide in their\nright mind that suicide is the only\noption for them so which is crazy but\nsometimes people decide to do that I\nthink we we do ourselves as a disservice\nas Society when we assume that all\npeople who are suicidal are mentally ill\nbecause sometimes people are suicidal\nbecause their life is objectively so bad\nthat they no longer want to live it they\nhave an accurate representation of how\nharsh their life is and for us to assume\nthat this person is mentally ill and\nthey're not thinking right and the\nproblem is up here instead of the\ncircumstances that drived them the\nsuicide I think we're doing a huge\ndisservice to\npeople that being said I think that if\nyou are suicidal you should\nabsolutely go see a mental health\nprofessional or call 911 if you're in\ndanger right now and that's because I\nthink our job as therapists is to help\nyou no matter what right and sometimes\nlike what I'm really proud of is we as\ntherapists and psychiatrists if it's\npathological we will try to help that\nand it can be really useful for you to\nunderstand okay I'm not mentally ill my\nlife genuinely sucks and the good news\nis that there are professions like\ntherapist that can help you rebuild your\nlife even if it sucks so we can help you\nmanage some of the internal stuff so\nthat you can go out there and make a\nchange for\nyourself so\ntldr women are more likely to be\ndiagnosed with particular illnesses our\nsystem of\ndiagnoses is more geared towards women\nand there's data I'm not saying that\nbecause I'm like oh my God women are\nevil no no one's evil no one did this\nintentionally this is just when 70% of\nthe popul that you deal with is of a\nparticular demographic your system of\ndiagnosis is going to be biased towards\nthat demographic this is just science\nit's not\ndiscrimination right so you the other\nthing we need to understand is that it\nis possible for there to be a bias\nwithout discrimination in my opinion no\none intentionally was like [ __ ] men no\nthey didn't do that we were like okay\nlet's ask a 100 patients who suffer from\ndepression what is the most predominant\nthing that you experience and people\nwill say I am sad and and 70% of people\nsay I'm sad 30% of people don't and then\nwhat we're we're going to do as\nscientists we're going to say okay\nsadness is the most common\nthing does that make\nsense\nokay what would you say to about people\nwho want to get therapy but don't\nbecause they're scared of the price what\na great\nquestion all right so if you want to get\ntherapy and you're scared of the price\nthere are a couple things that you need\nto understand the first thing is that\nwhen you don't want to do something your\nmind is happy to construct reasons to\nnot do it and price is a really good one\nright because if you're being like if\nyou're not doing something because it's\ntoo expensive then you're being\neconomical it's a positive to not go to\ntherapy but deep down if you're scared\nof therapy for some reason you got to be\nsuper careful about how wise the the\nexcuse that you have is right cuz who on\nEarth can argue with you about price if\npeople are like no man you should go and\nyou're like well that's easy for you to\nsay you've got more money than I do but\nI have a very real economic constraint\nthat prevents me from going to therapy\ntherefore you cannot blame me for my\nchoice so be\ncareful second thing to understand\ntherapy is expensive and is Out Of Reach\nfor many people that is a real tragedy\nin today's world it's part of the reason\nthat I'm here speaking with you today\nnot as a substitute for therapy but\nwe're going to do whatever we can for\nfree second thing to understand is that\ntherapy is often times the best\ninvestment that many people will make I\ncan't attach a statistic I can't say\nit's the best investment for 51% of\npeople I can't say that many people that\nI've talked to that have found therapy\nto be an absolute waste of time and\nmoney now I think that depends on the\ntherapist that you see and also the work\nthat you put\nin but it's often times the best\ninvestment that my patients have told me\nthis it's the best money that they've\never\nspent because the thing about therapy is\nthat it helps you live the rest of your\nlife way better right it helps you\nperform better at work helps you perform\nbetter in your relationships it helps\nyou walk around the house and have a\nhealthier space up here because what\ntherapy fixes is that which you carry\naround to everywhere you\ngo it is the global\nbuff to improve yourself will improve\nevery dimension of your\nlife and the third thing that I would\nsay if you are scared about the\nprice is that I remind you that how much\nyou get out of therapy depends on you\njust like a gym membership the value of\nwhat you paid for access to the gym\ndepends on how you use it so if you're\nright on the fence and it's financially\ndifficult for you to pay for therapy I\nwould encourage you to try to really get\nthe most out of it and hold your\ntherapist accountable my recommendation\nis that you see three therapists within\none month three separate therapists\nwithin one month and pick the one that's\nthe best pick the one that you like the\nmost there's a big mistake that people\nwill make they'll spend 8 12 15 20 30 50\nweeks with a therapist before realizing\nhey this is isn't working or I'm not\ngetting much out of this so big mistake\nthat people get make is that if they go\nto therapy and they're not getting\nsomething out of it they assume that if\nthey just keep kind of hanging out\neventually they'll get something and\nthere's some truth to that not every\nproblem is fixed right away and there\nare breakthroughs in therapy that will\nhappen like in a couple months that you\ndidn't foresee happening so there's\nvalue to sticking it\nout but I've seen way too many people\nwaste way too much time in therapy to\nwhere it's not worth it and it is the\nbiggest waste of money in your life so\nif you're scared about price first of\nall I'd make sure that that isn't an\nexcuse to avoid therapy secondly it can\nbe quite expensive so you should really\ntry to get your money's worth which\ndepends on what you put in and finding\nthe right therapist is a huge part of\nit the last thing is that there are many\nthings like the open path Collective is\na good example of of this there are many\ntherapists myself included who will see\npatience at a reduced or even free like\nthere was a point where 50% of my\npractice was like free care and like a\nlot of therapists a lot of us are in it\nto try to help people and like we'll\ntake a couple of sa stories who can't\nafford our services and we do it\ngladly so ask just say hey I really want\nto work with you or I'd like to give\nthis a shot but my financial situation\nisn't\ngreat do you have any spots for people\nat reduced or free\ncare\nyeah so someone saying I feel shy\nashamed to go see a therapist because\nI'm not a talkative person that's okay\nwe're really good at getting y'all to\ntalk and often times shy people have the\neasiest time talking in therapy because\nthere's only one other person in the\nroom and anything you say will never\nleave the room so it can be liberated\nthe Sher you are sometimes the easier\nand the more enjoyable you will find\ntherapy I love doing therapy with\nintroverts it's a lot of\nfun what is better a therapist or a\ncoach so let's understand the difference\nbetween the two real quick okay and then\nwe're going to move on to another\ntopic so therapists what is this\ncoaching business so coaching is like\nwhy are we doing this so there's a group\nof therapists who specialized in\npositive\npsychology and what they sort of\nrealized is that the techniques that we\nuse in therapy can be used for non-\ntherapeutic goals so we do Psychotherapy\nspecifically generally speaking nowadays\nto treat an illness right someone has a\nmood disorder or an anxiety disorder we\nare going to leverage our understanding\nof the mind to fix something that is\nbroken this group of positive\npsychologists um I think Carol Kaufman\nis one of them who's at the Institute of\ncoaching at mlan hospital and Harvard\nMedical School so this is where I got my\nintroduction to coaching realized that\nthese same techniques can be used for\nsomeone who's not ill at all who is\nbaseline or even above Baseline to help\nthem Elevate what they're capable\nof and that's where coaching in my\nopinion was born is the recognition that\nyou can take someone at Baseline and you\ncan help them achieve by using a lot of\nthese same principles so I think the\nreal goal is whether we're or are we\ndoing this as therapy is does it have a\ntherapeutic goal is it designed to fix\nsomething that is broken or is it\ndesigned to help you achieve and\ntherapists I think all therapists can\ntheoretically do the work of a coach\nbut no coaches can do the work that is\nexclusively a therapists if that makes\nsense the challenge is that therapists\nare not often times trained to work with\nhealthy people and help them achieve\nthat's just not what our training is our\ntraining is is with people who are have\na pathology of some kind so it's\ndifferent and so my general question\nwhen I'm asking people or when people\nask me like hey which one should I see\nI'd say are you trying to fix something\nthat's broken or are you generally\nspeaking relatively healthy and you want\nto achieve\nmore\nokay let's move\non all\nright a study has found men view\ntraditional symptoms of depression as\nmore severe than other types of\nsymptoms and men with traditional\ndepressive symptoms are perceived as\nmore feminine and less masculine this\nhas major implications for stigma and\nhelp\nseeking so our last lecture with our\nmembership launch is going to be a male\nspecific focus on depression but we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about how men\nexperience depression differently from\nwomen or just in general there's a male\nspecific it's not clear whether it's\nwomen or it's just everybody\nelse so men do\nexperience oh okay let's not click that\nbutton yet or let's click it\nrestart\n[Music]\nthere we\ngo\nokay what was I saying all\nright so there's a lot of research that\nshows that men experience depression\ndifferently from what we sort of think\nabout as textbook\ndepression this is one of the reasons\nwhy men are less likely to be diagnosed\nwith depression than women I think on\nthe inside there is something similar\ngoing on but the way that this is\nexpressed on the outside is different\nfor example so doing a lot of work as an\naddiction psychiatrist one of the key\nthings that I've sort of discovered is\nthat a lot of addiction in men is\nactually a manifestation of depression\nnow this becomes a little bit\ncomplicated because once you start using\na substance to self-medicate your\ndepression we'll talk about what that is\nin a\nsecond what then that creates is a\nseparate seate diagnosis which is a\nsubstance use dependence now I become\ndependent on the substance and I have a\nseparate thing going on that is an\naddiction that has its own life right\nbut if we look at why I got addicted in\nthe first place often times it is\ndepression at the root so here are a\ncouple of things that people don't\nunderstand about how depression can\nmanifest in men that looks very\ndifferent from women so if we look at\ndiagnostic criteria for major depressive\ndisorder\na big part of it is feeling sad so it's\nlike there's five out of these nine\nthings like sleep disturbance and honia\nwhich means inability to enjoy things\nfeeling guilty having lower energy all\nthis kind of crap is there for the\ndiagnostic criteria of major depressive\ndisorder but the main thing that\neveryone basically has to have is you\nhave to feel sad for about two weeks now\nthis is a huge problem for men because a\nlot of men who are depressed don't\nactually feel sad what we will feel is\nfrustrated angry out of\ncontrol so the experience of men doesn't\ndoesn't involve a whole lot of sadness\nor crying or isolation and in fact the\npaper that we just looked\nat demonstrated that when a man\nexperiences those things when I'm\nisolated crying and feeling sad I view\nmyself as weak or feminine I don't think\nabout it as depression I view it as\nweakness so men move away from that\ndepression on purpose they don't endorse\nthose symptoms in fact they try to\nself-medicate them I'm going to drink my\nproblems away so I don't feel like a\nwuss tired of being a wuss so I'm going\nto do all this stuff\ninstead so then what happens if you ask\nthis person hey do you feel sad and\nthey're you're like no I num it I don't\nfeel sad what I feel is pissed angry\nfrustrated so the male experience of\ndepression is a little bit different and\nlet's take a quick\nlook\nokay so a hypothesis is of gender\ndifferences in self-reporting symptoms\nof\ndepression and let's look at let's look\nat this potential\nmechanisms that account for this\ndifference may include three\naspects there's something about estrogen\nbut gender differences in coping style\nis really important so men are\ncomparatively less emotionally\nexpressive are non-help-seeking so we're\nless likely to get diagnosed with\ndepression and there there are\ndifferences in phenotypes so the way\nthat depression looks in men is\ndifferent so these are atypical we call\nthem atypical symptoms of depression but\nthey're actually just male symptoms\nright so this in of itself is a key\nthing to understand typical\ndepression is not what men look like\nwhen they're depressed we have an\natypical presentation so the the whole\ncondition is\ndefined as a in a typical way in manner\nsort of\natypical um let me just show yall what\nuh a couple of\nexamples um we don't worry about that\nokay this is the key thing gender\ndifferences in the phenotypic symptoms\nof depression so what is phenotype mean\nphenotype means the way it looks not\nwhat it is but the way it\nlooks\nso\nuh so males so\nwhat we want to be as so when men are\ndepressed we are more or just in general\nmen are more likely to be proactive\naggressive violent whereas women are\nmore likely to be emotional passive and\nselfless um let me try to find there's\none good sentence in here or maybe it's\nover\nhere oh yeah no here here it is okay\nthis is the paper I'm looking for so\nthis is a great example this paper looks\nat the specifics of male depression so\nthese people even suggested back in 2001\nthat depression in men has its own\nparticular Syndrome has its own\nconstellation of symptoms so let's look\nat what depression looks like in\nmen\nokay um men\ndisplayed more comorbidities with\nalcohol use so the number one sign of\ndepression in men could be a substance\nuse disorder impulse\ncontrol uh\nand this is not what I'm looking\nfor there we go okay so more\nprovocatively look at that Chad I don't\nknow if you guys see what I did to find\nwhat I was looking for but I knew what\nyear the reference was okay so rutz has\npostulated the existence of a specific\nmale depression syndrome characterized\nby temporary low stress tolerance acting\nout aggression low impulse control anger\nattacks abuse or abuse equivalent\nBehavior antisocial features alexithymia\nwhich is emotional numbness depressive\nthought content High suicide potential\nso let me ask yall something have y all\never\nexperienced a period of time where you\nwere more sensitive to stress you felt\nsuper stressed\nout you felt more\naggressive you had worse impulse control\nyou're jerking off more playing more\nvideo games drinking more you get\nangry you're more likely to engage in\nsubstance use you become more antisocial\nand you become more\nnumb this is what depression in men\nlooks\nlike there's no sadness there's no\ncrying there's no like leaning on other\npeople for help you're pissed you're\nisolating you want to stay the hell away\nfrom everybody else everything is\nfalling apart you feel out of control\nyou don't know what to do about\nit you carry around this weight in your\nhead and the only thing you can do to\nget relief is to turn to some kind of\ndopaminergic activity alcohol marijuana\nvideo games\npornography this in 2001 was described\nas a male syndrome of\ndepression but this is not what we\ndiagnose when someone comes in we ask\nthem have you been sad people like no\nI'm not sad I'm [ __ ] stressed out and\nthe world is falling apart and I don't\nknow how to fix it all I can't fix it\nwhich is what everyone wants me to do is\nfix it but I can't so I'm drinking\nmore and then we look at this person we\nsay oh wow sounds like you've got an\nalcohol problem because you're not sad\nand crying you're just drinking a\nlot so this is what we don't understand\nabout male\ndepression and this is also where like\none of my not mentors\nteachers maritzio\nfava who when I was training\nwas um what is it associate chief of\nPsychiatry at MGH also discovered a\nspecific kind of depression with anger\nattacks back in\n1998 super\ncool so we know that there are different\nmanifestations of depression the problem\nis that this doesn't sink in and so men\nget diagnosed with depression instead\nwhat they get diagnosed with is being an\n[ __ ] man this is toxic\nmasculinity he's angry drinks a lot\ndoesn't discuss his emotions it's toxic\nmasculinity it's toxic masculinity and\nwho's to\nblame\nright the more compassionate versions of\nus will say that Society is to blame the\npatriarchy is to blame well how do we\nfix\nthat right what I'm sure that people\nhave good suggestions about how to\ndismantle it in the worst case scenarios\nwe blame the\nperson so see we've become so\nenlightened as a society we still get we\nstill blame a lot of people for being\ndepressed we certainly do it's sad but\nnow there is a subgroup of people who\nfrequently get blamed even more because\nit doesn't even look like depression we\nview it as toxic\nmasculinity impulses\naddictions but this literally could be a\nmanifestation of a pathology that just\nlooks\ndifferent and so male depression is very\ndifferent this is what I've seen and\nthis is why I think that like you know\nsometimes the reason that men kill\nthemselves is because they actually\nexhibit depressive symptoms but they\ndon't get diagnosed with depression they\ndon't seek help right and some of this\nstuff I think is fair to say is a piece\nof toxic masculinity I think it's a fair\ndefinition it's a fair conception in\nsome ways like the lack of helpy\nbut then if you look at why don't men\nseek help it's because we get punished\nfor it and I've got a paper about that\ntoo but anyway I'll find that for find\nthat for\ny'all\num\nyeah uh let me see if I can find this\nreal\nquick anyway so this is a this is a good\npaper I'll just flash to this we don't\nhave to go over it in\ndetail um but where do I turn for help\nGeneral conflict self stigma and\ncolleges College men's help seeking for\ndepression basically explores why men\nare sort of not open to seeking help and\nas you examine more of this this this\npaper and this literature what you\ndiscover is that one of the main reasons\nthat people don't seek help is because\nwhen we seek help we get punished for it\nwe're viewed as either not not masculine\nsometimes but frequently people just\ndon't help us and so we stop asking for\nhelp because it's a waste of\ntime it sucks that YouTube only allow\nleftist therapists preach what does that\nmean I'm so confused is what am I the\nleftist how did politics enter this did\npolitics because we're talking about\nI'm I'm confused am I leftist or am I\nrightest\nhere can someone help\nme I'm so\nconfused is is what I'm I'm confused\nabout this person's comment because is\nthis person saying that I'm leftist or\nthat I'm\nrightest\nI don't know where this puts me I\nthought we were talking\nscience I'm opst\ngamist okay I'll be opst I didn't\nrealize like this the reason we're\npointing to researches I I don't think\nthis is political and maybe this is me\nbeing ignorant because I am ignorant in\na lot of ways\nyou know because I spend my days reading\nthis instead of you know being poit like\nunderstanding like I don't know if I'm\nleftist or rtist or\nwhat no I'm I I I genuinely want to\nunderstand where on the side of whatever\nI am right\nnow because I'm terrified I'm terrified\nof being branded as one of these\nists because as far as I I mean I don't\nI think I'm talking science does that\nmake me\nlove I don't even know\nanymore okay let's move\non I don't know what I am in terms of\nleftist or rtis because every time I try\nto talk to someone about this I can't\ntell I can't find a consensus\ndefinition\nI talk to some people who are leftists\nwho think I'm a rtist and I talk to some\npeople rtists who think I'm a leftist\nand that maybe that makes me a Centrist\nI don't\nknow I mean but yeah\nokay I I don't I don't know I don't know\nI don't know I'm open to being\neducated\nokay\nall\nright um let's talk\nabout okay yeah I I I I don't I don't\nknow I don't know chaotic neutral now\nwe're talking let's let's forget forget\nabout political spectrums what alignment\nare\nyou chat what is What is your favorite\nalignment for characters that you play\nand better better question is what what\nis the preferred alignment of characters\nthat I\nplay okay oh there's a great question\nabout being stoic okay give me a second\nJoe\nmama chaotic lawful neutral good yeah so\nmy my chaotic good\nforever okay I love it there's D and D\nenjoyers oh my God love y'all all right\nso to be honest I like so my favorite\nclasses to play are BS thieves and\nnecromancers my favorite alignment is\nchaotic neutral I like necromancy but\nyou know it's generally speaking evil\nbut I'm sometimes I'll play those people\nwho like just want to understand the\nnature of life and death and I'm not not\nevil but chaotic neutral chaotic neutral\nBard let's\ngo so in real life my alignment is\nprobably chaotic good because if I was\nlawful good I would have stayed in\nAcademia right we gota we gotta we got\nto bend the rules we got to do something\na little bit\nunorthodox\nyeah it's it's it's it's challenging to\nwant to play necromancers though because\nmost DMS you know we because the the\nnecromancy is sometimes to be frowned\nupon you know what I'm saying\nlike you\nknow\nit's it's to be frowned\nupon I see you as neutral I take that as\na compliment\nCrow\nhey would the YouTube membership content\never have interviews that's not\nsomething that we have planned right\nnow but it could I mean the whole point\nis that yall decide what we\ndo\nright\num yeah so couple of comments and let's\nmove on thank you guys so much for the\nthe dip\ninto D and D I still need to play bg3 by\nthe way I'm like an hour\nin oh my God I was playing on tactician\nand then I realized I I moved down\ndifficulties this is the first time I've\never done this in life speaking to the\nperson who's like 40 years old who is uh\nKristoff\nf um yeah so like as a as a geriatric\ngamer I I just found that while I could\nwin the battles on tactician they were\njust so cognitively intensive and I had\nto like save and reload a bazillion\ntimes or die a bazillion times and just\ntry again so I was like you know what\nthis is not actually fun so I downgraded\nthe\ndifficulty and I felt like a real Noob\nbut then the game felt Freer like I\ndidn't have to like prep for everything\nyou know what I mean like when you're\nplaying laran games like if you're on\nthe hardest difficulty and you walk in\nyou have to know exactly what's going to\nhappen or maybe I need to maybe y'all\ncan just YOLO it but\num yeah anyway so there's a question\nabout stoicism and there's a great\nquestion that I just want to get to for\na second oh my God it disappeared\nsomeone was asking about schizoid\npersonality disorder and stoicism I I\ndidn't quite I don't remember the\nquestion 100% but you know if you have\nschizoid personality\ndisorder you tend to be pretty withdrawn\nyou don't really care for social\nrelationships like you don't need them\nso if we look at like the schizoid\npersonality versus kind of the dependent\npersonality there there's a difference\nso people are just like comfortable\nwithout\nrelationships um and you know that's\nexactly the kind of topic that we\nhaven't Dove too much into just because\nof an epidemiology issue which is that\nthe percentage of people who have this\nare quite small and so like very very\nsmall small exceedingly small and so we\nwe haven't spent a whole lot of time on\nit but that's the kind of thing that if\nyou guys want us to do lecture on we can\nmaybe I mean we'll I'll explore it\nanyway\nbut\num okay thank you so much nagram the\nacknowledgement of the existence of\npatriarchy is a leftist thought for some\npeople that's why they framed you like\nthat I think good to\nknow thank you'all for educating me yeah\nI think maybe I'll put together\nsomething on stoicism alexiy and\nschizoid uh what if members vote on\nbasic beginner level topics and not\nesoteric topics for the lectures that\nwould be horrible yes I agree but also\nwe got to start\nsomewhere so I think over time the\nvoting may\nchange\nHenrik did you miss the big announcement\nI don't know chat did Henrik miss the\nbig\nannouncement we can do it again so\nhere's the announcement so we are\nlaunching YouTube\nmemberships and we we're launching today\nand the first lecture is going to be in\ntwo days so the reason we're doing\nmemberships couple of super quick\ndetails about it the first\nis what you get with memberships it's 10\nbucks a month and what you get is four\nlive streamed lectures which will be\navailable on demand afterward with Q&A\nso the lectures are going to be longer\nthey're 1 hour lectures that are more\nacademic more applicable more in-depth\nso this is for the subset of our\ncommunity who wants more than 20-minute\nYouTube\nvideos the topics for the lectures are\nchosen by y'all so you decide one month\nin advance what I'm going to build\nlectures on I'll spend about 6 to 8\nhours putting together a lecture\nthere'll be weekly quests related to the\nlecture so if if you guys want to like\nbuild something off of it you\ncan um but it's not 20 minute clickbait\nkind of stuff it's like we're going to\nactually go into a topic in depth in in\na\ntopic um the first month we're going to\nfocus on male mental health and the\nreason for that is because we have been\nbasically been polling the community and\nthat's at the top of the list for stuff\nthat we have not focused on so far so in\nour our general like streams and and\nYouTube videos and stuff like that we\ntry to be as inclusive as possible but\nwhen we ask people what do you want\nlectures on this is the stuff that's\nactually at the top so going forward\nwe're not we're not planning on making\nthis like an exclusively male membership\nor anything like that that's not the\ngoal we just needed somewhere to start\nand we just listen to the community in\nterms of what they wanted so we just did\na bit about male depression there's\ngoing to be a whole one hour lecture on\nthat um we're going to talk about\ndealing with expectations as a man how\nto develop healthy masculinity and where\ntoxic masculinity comes from emotions\nfor men how the experience of emotions\nis different for men and also how we\nmanage emotions is different for men so\nlearning a little bit about that and the\nlast lecture is going to be uh male view\non depression so how is depression for\nmen actually different from General\ndepression so if yall are interested\nsign up I'm going to give an hourlong\nlecture and we'll do Q&A at the end and\nI think once a month we're going to try\nto have Standalone Q&A as well as a as a\nseparate live stream so I I think five\nlive streams a month the good news is\nthat this does not impact our general\ncontent that we make so for those of\ny'all that are not in a position where\nyou can even afford 10 bucks a month\nno you know no no up I'm not upset about\nthat you know if y'all are kind of in a\nposition where you can't afford that\ntotally fine we're going to continue\nmaking all the same free stuff that we\nnormally make and our hope is that with\nthe money from memberships we can\ncontinue to build other stuff we have a\nsecond tier which is at 15 bucks a month\nwhich is if you want to give us extra\nmoney what do you get at that tier you\nget maybe early access to other tools\nand things like that that we're building\nbut our our goal is to really create the\nhighest value at the lowest tier and the\nsecond tier is just a substitute for\npatreon so if you guys want to give us\nmoney and we're building something new\nyou get early access to it but it's it's\nreally not it's really to support the\nwork that we're doing because we get\ntons of requests from people who are\nwanting to give us money and we haven't\nset up something yet so that's why we do\nit\num\nokay do I pay to get into the lecture\nyou just join as a member so each\nlecture I guess technically is like\n$2.50 or maybe $2 because there's a Q&A\nsection as\nwell uh yeah you'll be able to watch I\nthink you'll be able to watch it after I\nI don't know exactly that depends on the\nYouTube functionality but generally\nspeaking we plan on having\nvods\num okay Ricardo is saying I've been\ndiagnosed with Alexia you have a video a\nit but it's hard to find exercises okay\nwe'll work on it thank you very much\nRicardo I'm filing it\naway\num\nokay\nyeah y'all can join yeah so so this is\njust so just so yall understand the\nreason we're charging for this is just\nbecause it takes time to build and this\nis a group of people that we hope yall\nwill be able to get to Advanced\ntopics but all of our standard like free\nstreams and and YouTube videos and stuff\nis going to\ncontinue okay\nyeah so uh there should be a schedule\nsomewhere I think the first stream is on\nWednesday and we're doing one stream a\nweek\nbasically okay\nuh yeah all right so let's move\non\nokay give youall a choice chat you guys\ndecide so we\nhave okay yall tell me which one okay\nwe're going to do finding a therapist as\na man is difficult struggling with the\nidea of being a man and can you ever\nfully recover from\nporn which one do youall want to\ndo how do I become a member I think\nthere's a join button somewhere can\nsomebody help this person out um Whi\nwhich one chat which one are we\ndoing\nporn porn is there a poll mods mod\ncheck\nuh oh my God I did it chat okay\neveryone's saying two a lot of people\nare saying two two and three two and\nthree two and three okay it looks like\none is the\nleast all right let's do\ntwo all\nright let's do\ntwo we're going to do them both we're\njust trying to figure out the\norder okay wait I'm seeing more people\nsay three okay no oh my God\noh wait is this a\npoll no\npinned okay let's do let's do\ntwo okay and then we'll do three right\nafter okay three right after struggling\nwith the idea of being a\nman I recently I\n23m recently graduated from University\nwith a degree in computer science and\nfound a great job which makes me money\ngood money Financial Security and the\nthe ability to support my brothers and\nmother who is retiring soon was one of\nthe main goals that I was working\ntowards I'd say that my idea of what a\nman is mainly my idea of what a man is\nis mainly a provider someone whose duty\nis to ensure the well-being of those\ndependent on him for doing this there\nare no pats on the back or thank yous\nthat I expect as I'm merely doing what\nis my duty as a man as a sibling and as\na son to be someone who I know my family\ncan rely on gives me great pride in\nknowing that I can El Elevate their\nfinancial alleviate I assume their\nfinancial struggle has become a great\nsource of Pride and fuels me to keep\ngoing the problem I encountered is that\nbeing in the provider role has made me\nemotionally numb to everything else my\nconstant focus is on the fact that I'm\ndepended on by others and I have to do\neverything I can to make sure they want\nfor nothing which has manifested as a\nneed to climb the corporate ladder for\nhigher pay I don't feel much of anything\nnowadays I'm not happy I'm not sad I'm\nnot angry I'm merely just exist and Fain\nand manipulate my character in responses\nto fit the situation I am in romantic\nrelationships make no sense to me at all\nI see friends in long-term relationships\nso happy and reliant on each other for\nemotional and physical support I've\nnever had it and I've gone long enough\nwithout it that it doesn't seem like a\nnecessary whatso like a necessity\nwhatsoever part of me views needing\nreassurance and emotional support from\nothers as weakness mostly because I made\nit this far without it it and and I am\nnothing special so why can't\nthey my family needing me led me to the\nconclusion that I would not have any\nchildren of my own is this would split\nmy attention and finances to both\nfamilies everyone makes sacrifices in\nthis F in this life for family so for me\nthis is this is one that I choose to\nmake for their sake I don't think I have\nthe emotional capabilities to be a good\nfather or partner to anyone hence it's\nbest if I stay away from starting my own\nfamily anyway work hard then provide\nmove up the ladder earn and then provide\neven\nmore\nso this is a all to Common\nscenario where we are taught as men that\nit is our duty to provide and women are\ntaught to provide in a different way\nright so women are taught to provide in\nterms of cleaning up and cooking and\nentertaining and whatnot bearing\nchildren and men are taught that what we\nare is a vehicle of economic stability\nfor the people around us and what ends\nup happening is that we are taught that\nokay you're supposed to be this thing\nand if you are not this thing then you\nshould be ashamed of yourself and if you\nare this thing you should be proud of\nyourself but something really tricky\nhappens when we take a group of people\nand we say that your pride\nis dependent on\nsacrifice this creates a really\nchallenging situation because at the end\nof the day for you to feel Pride you\nhave to give something up you have to\nhurt in some way right because that's\nwhat sacrifice is sacrifice is you take\nthis pain for this\nbenefit and so often times I see this a\nlot in men a lot of men who are suicidal\nactually this is exactly how they start\nout they start out at the age of 23\nmaking sacrifices for their family and\nthen they get Bound in that sacrifice\nthe family becomes dependent on that\nsacrifice and so now if you stop holding\nthe world up the world for your loves\none loved ones will fall apart and so\nthen they end up at the age of 40 being\nsuicidal because they've been numb for\nso\nlong that they don't know what to do\nthey're tired of living this life and\nthis is exactly what happens because\nwhen you start sacrificing for other\npeople you can feel some degree of pride\nin it\nbut every time you sacrifice it hurts\nyou so as a dude how do you manage that\nhurt I have to get up every day and I\nhave to go to my job because I need to\npay the bills but it hurts I don't like\nmy job so what do I end up doing the\nbrain adapts by becoming numb the brain\nadapts by\ndissociation so literally what happens\nis as you start to burn out your\nemotional circuitry in the brain shuts\noff because in the absence of it\nshutting off it would hurt too much and\nthen what happens is all of the\nconsequences of emotional numbness\nbecome really problem problematic at the\ntop of the list is not engaging in your\nown healthy\nrelationships right because you don't\nhave emotional bandwidth you're numb on\nthe inside you don't even feel so much\nattraction or when you feel attracted to\nsomeone it carries with it a lot of\nreally nasty other things you'll know\nwhat I'm talking about it's kind of\nweird like if you don't know what I'm\ntalking about it's going to be hard to\nunderstand but\nyou know I remember\nlike when I was attracted to someone it\nwould bring up all kinds of stuff I\ncouldn't just be in love I couldn't be\nattracted because anytime I had those\nfeelings like all this other crap would\ncome with it like am I good\nenough what does this person need me to\nbe can I live up to their expectations\nI'm already holding all these other\npeople's expectations I don't think I\ncan live up to somebody else's\nexpectations or if I like this this\nperson that's weak or if there's some\nkind of relationship here I'm scared of\nit we don't really realize that's what\nwe feel but all all the only thing that\nI remember feeling and I've worked with\na ton of men who have experienced this\nis that the the attraction in the\nrelationship comes with all of this\nunsorted\nbaggage and since we're so numb we're\nnot really aware of it we haven't really\ndealt with it so then we start\nretreating from that and we start\ncreating this life we our only source of\nPride because we're so numb and we don't\nlisten to ourselves our only source of\npride is living up to\nexpectations and you can feel a lot of\ngenuine pride in that I'm not saying\nthat you know providing for your family\nis a bad thing I certainly did my fair\nshare of it still do I'm happy to do it\nright so there was a point in time where\nmy wife was in\nschool we had a bills to pay I had two\nyoung kids so I had to spend my weekends\nworking in a hospital thankfully I was\nin a situation where I could work for 48\nhours and make enough to be able to\nsupport you know my student partner and\nmy young\nkids so that's what we do as men right\nwe\nprovide the challenge though is that\nwhen this becomes our only source of\nPride we almost become addicted to\nproviding because if you stop providing\nat that point what are you left with\nshame you're a failure and since you've\nsacrificed everything else in your life\nyou have nothing to fall back on this is\nthe Trap that traps men\nand leads to middle-age suicides and\nmidlife crises is I'm going to sacrifice\neverything else in my life to make these\npeople happy and now I only have one\nsource of Pride joy and positive\naffirmation the problem is that that\nSource requires me to continue to\nsacrifice and now I'm stuck because I'm\ndependent on this source of\nPride and if I ever give it up then I'm\nscrewed because I have nothing left I\nhaven't built anything I'm 40 years old\nand I've sacrificed to create this\nfamily which on some level I love but I\nfeel empty and numb inside I feel\nunfulfilled so let me color my hair and\nbuy a\nconvertible right this is what happens\nbecause I've got nothing else I've spent\n20 years of my life to get to this point\nand what do I have to show for it\neverybody else has security but what do\nI\nhave right and this is where people are\nsaying exploited by people in the worst\ncase ISS\nyes but this is where we tend to do\nsomething as men we want to blame other\npeople but this is where you made this\nChoice were you pressured absolutely\nwere you taken advantage of very\npossibly it's not my place to say\nwhether you were or you\nweren't but I absolutely know that early\non there was some willingness to\nsacrifice and then we get stuck with\nit so this is the real tragedy is we get\ntaught that as a man you have to\nsacrifice in order to feel feel pride\nand then we get stuck sacrificing then\nwe give everything up and then our lives\nare empty and then people\nwonder what's wrong with when well we've\ngiven up everything in our lives for\nthis particular thing and now our life\nis empty and like that's not going to\nlead to happiness having an empty life\nis no way to be happy sacrifice only\ngets you so far in terms of maso's\nhierarchy of\nneeds right so what do we do about\nthis so this is where I would say if\nyou're a man\nand people are dependent on you and you\nfeel\nforced to support\nthem not saying you don't support them\nbecause that's going to lead to a bunch\nof Shame they don't know what to do\nright it's your source of Pride what I\nwould say first and foremost is pick a\ntimeline get dimensions of time so if we\nlook at this\npost the main question that I have for\nall of this is when how long are you\ngoing to be providing for your son your\nyour mother and your siblings I think\nit's good to provide for your family\nlike that's a good thing how long are\nyou planning on not having a\nrelationship what's your\ntimeline because what tends to happen\nthe biggest mistake men make is not in\nsacrifice I don't think sacrificing is\nbad it's in a NeverEnding sacrifice an\nendless sacrifice of God knows how many\nyears this is going to go on so if\nyou're supporting someone who's\nfinancially stable I mean sorry unstable\nsit down with them and ask them okay\nwhat's the\nplan right and then you kind of got to\nfigure out like what's the timeline this\nperson has siblings how are the siblings\ngoing to be self-sufficient for what\nperiod of time are you carrying the\nload and this is what tends to happen is\nwe make sacrifices and we never have\nthis conversation we never even let\npeople know that hey by the way I may\nnot be here forever\nand instead what we actually end up\ndoing is we start enabling dependent\nBehavior because we never bring it up we\ndon't expect\ngratitude and so when people start\ntaking us for granted instead of\ntreating us with gratitude because we\ndon't expect it right it's my duty I'm\nfulfilling my duty therefore other\npeople don't have to acknowledge it\ndon't have to be grateful and can assume\nit's always going to be there this is\nhow we get\ntrapped the worst thing you can do for\nsomeone is something that they can do\nfor\nthemselves and when we start supporting\neverybody around\nus they'll start to count on it\nespecially when you don't expect\nappreciation which I think is fine you\ndon't have to expect\nappreciation but just let them know that\nthere's a timeline ask them how long are\nyou expecting you know sit down with\nyour family say how long are you\nexpecting me to financially support\nus right just\nask and acknow have everyone sort of\nacknowledge for a moment what you are\ndoing and what the timeline for this\nis we're not saying don't do\nit second thing to\ndo is to take some of that emotional\nnumbness and gravitate a little bit\ntowards something that makes you feel\nhappy or\ncontent you need to have some source of\npride and joy in your life that comes\noutside of helping other people\nsacrificing for other people because\nthat's like that's d that's\npoisonous to feel Pride from sacrifice\nand then sometimes this can even become\ntoxic so to feel Pride from sacrifice in\nthe worst case scenarios results in\nstuff like Munch Housen by\nproxy which is when since my only source\nof pride is to sacrifice for you when\nyou no longer need\nme that means that I have to create\nsituations that require My Sacrifice ice\nso now what I'm doing is since I feel\nPride because I sacrifice for you and\nyou don't need my me to sacrifice\nanymore now what I need to do is I'm\ngoing to start a fire and I'm going to\nburn myself while rescuing\nyou I've seen it it's\nscary there's even a form of\ndepression or depressive personality\ndisorder called altruistic\ndepression which is when people feel\ndepressed unless they are sacrificing\nfor someone else and so what these\npeople end up doing it's it's at the\nbeginning everyone's like oh wow I would\nlove to have someone like that in my\nlife where they feel good about\nthemselves when they're doing something\nfor me that sounds great but eventually\nwhat these people will do is they'll\nstart creating\nproblems to sacrifice so that they can\nfeel better about themselves and they go\non sabotaging all their relationships\nthey drive people\ninsane altruistic depression it's crazy\nand so this is the tricky thing I I\nthink it's totally fine and this\nhonestly for the record I don't think is\nmale right we expect Sacrifice from all\nhuman beings for your family it just\nlooks different and if you're in this\nautopilot sacrificing\nmode you need to stop and really think\nabout how long do you want to keep this\nup and what are you giving up are you\ngiving up romantic relationships are you\ngiving up your own happiness and this is\nthe crazy thing is that you don't even\nneed to give it\nup so when you sacrifice your whole life\nto support your family you've got to be\nsuper careful because what you could be\ndoing is creating dependence and when\nyou create dependence they need you to\nsacrifice but if you hadn't sacrificed\nso much in the first place they would\nhave learned to become\nself-sufficient this is what really\nfeels like a you know chicken or egg\nkind of problem so I'd strongly\nrecommend you have conversations with\nthe people that are dependent on you and\njust try to get a sense of okay like\nwhat are we doing\nhere right and then you're not going to\ndo that though because it'll\nmake it'll make them feel guilty for\nbeing dependent on you and the last\nthing that you want to do is make other\nPE people feel guilty you're welcome\nyou're you would much rather sacrifice\nand take all of the negative emotions\nyourself and you're supporting them\nfinancially but heaven forbid you make\nthem feel guilty for it we can't do that\nso I'm not saying that you should go up\nand say hey you should be grateful for\nall the sacrifices I make for you you\ncan just ask them hey what's your plan\nright what are what's our plan this is\nour life we're living it together this\nis what you're doing this is what I'm\ndoing this is what I need help with this\nis what you need help with and how long\nare we going to be doing this it's very\nhelpful to\ndo now this is great someone's asking\nwhat if you ask and the answer is to\nsupport forever\nso I think that's where you get to\ndecide right in the case of a parent who\nmay not have the working potential\nanymore I think it's actually okay to\nsupport someone forever I think that's\nokay right like that's acceptable but\nyou have to decide that it's acceptable\nyou have to understand what you're\nsigning up for and then this is on the\nflip side is I would still ask if you\nare making a lifelong sacrifice for this\nperson I think it's completely\nreasonable for you to ask that of them\nthere should be reciprocity in\nrelationships and they don't have to\nsupport you financially but I'm sure\nthey could support you in other\nways right helping you hey set me up\nwith someone I want to start dating ask\nfor help it's\nokay right and and that's also where if\ntheir answer if they are capable of\nworking and their answer is you support\nme forever you can also say I'm not not\nwilling to do\nthat right or this is what this is\ncosting me this is the extent to which\nI'm willing to do it but here's what I\nneed from you and if they're if they're\nasking for ongoing financial support\nthen I think it's completely reasonable\nfor you to ask for something else and\nthis is important that you don't get\ntaken for\ngranted\nright it's like Gabe is saying\nreciprocated altruism is an evolutionary\nstrategy for highly social animal\nit comes out on top in the long run\nwhich I think is totally fine I'm\ntotally fine with a division of labor\nwithin a household where one person\nearns all the money and one person takes\ncare of things at\nhome but I think this is a challenge is\nthat a lot of times we just sign up for\nthe\nstuff or we get signed up for it and we\nwe proceed on autopilot without\ncritically thinking about what we're\nsigning up for and what kind of\nbehaviors we're\nengendering we create dependency all\naround around us and we never even talk\nabout it because even bringing it up oh\nmy god this is my duty I should do it\nwithout complaint no you doing it doing\nyour duty is a good thing but you\n[ __ ] get to\ncomplain right when when did we\nsurrender that what did we get in return\nwhen we gave up the ability to\ncomplain like complain if you want\nto\nright\nquestions yeah we need to negotiate I\ndon't even I wouldn't even call it a\nnegotiation I would say have a\nconversation and really like in the over\nthe course of that conversation you will\ndiscover what how you feel about it\nwhich is really\nimportant complaining is healthy it can\nbe so you all have to understand\nsomething is complaining\nhealthy what a great question first\nthing to understand is that if human\nhuman beings do it if the majority of\nhuman beings do it chances are it's a\nfeature not a bug there's a reason why\nhuman beings complain there's a reason\nwhy it's normal to complain because to a\ncertain extent it is healthy so let's\nunderstand how complaining is healthy\nthe first is it gives other people a\nchance to understand where you are\nbecause if you are in an unsustainable\nsituation it is actually beneficial for\nthe people around you to understand that\nyou are not happy because if we want to\ncontinue whatever we're doing everyone\nneeds to be moderately happy in order\nfor it to be sustainable that's number\none it's a way for you to signal to\npeople how to maintain this\nrelationship second reason is it opens\nthe door for empathy when I complain\nabout my boss and you complain about\nyour B your boss we bind with each other\nso we as human beings know that when we\nshare something negative it opens the\ndoor for\nsupport now in what ways is complaining\nunhealthy\nbecause remember that complaining is\nsupposed to have other steps right so I\nshare my struggle you share your\nstruggle we both Bond over it and we\nboth feel better this builds a\nrelationship or I share something that\nI'm unhappy about to give you an\nopportunity to try to fix it or even\ncomplaining can be a way to articulate\nand work through something that you're\ngoing through internally so to increase\nself- understanding by sharing something\nthat you're complaining about we do some\nback and forth I understand it once I\nunderstand it I can take\nsteps now the three things it with\ncomplaining that all make him healthy\nhave subsequent Steps either the\nrelationship is being worked\non we're forming a relationship by\nsharing a struggle or I'm thinking\nthrough things so that I can fix them\nmyself when complaining becomes\nunhealthy is when people just stop after\nthe\ncomplaining complaining is a vehicle to\nget from point A to point Z when we just\nboard the train and we stay on it\nforever that is\nunhealthy it fatigues other people if\nthere's nothing being done about it if\nthere is no processing or forward\nmomentum you're kind of stuck in that\nnegative space you're activating all\nthese negative emotions and you're not\nactually doing anything about them and\nwe see this a lot on the\ninternet where you'll have a lot of\npeople who complain all the time and the\nsecond that someone stops them from\ncomplaining they will go find someone\nelse to complain to so they're stuck in\nthis constant cycle of complaining\ncomplaining complaining complaining\nwithout getting\nanywhere and so in this case what's\nhappening is remember that complaining\nis a a tool to improve\nthings does that make sense so once I\ncomplain to you we're going to work on\nsomething I'll clarify something for\nmyself now that I understand it I can\nfix it or we're going to form a bond\nwe're going to form an emotional\nrelationship but it is a method to fix\nfix things so then the problem is if you\nif all you do is complain and you don't\ntake that second step nothing ever gets\nfixed if nothing ever gets fixed you\nneed to complain a whole lot\nmore as you complain a whole lot more\nyou're going to start driving people\naway and you're going to find other\npeople to complain to so then what\nhappens we get stuck in this cycle where\nI'm unhappy things aren't getting fixed\nI have a ton of negative energy that I\nneed to expel through complaining so\nthis is the cycle of someone who gets\nstuck in complaining and this is all Al\nsometimes what happens in Safe spaces\nwhere it's like it's just a place where\nlike we've had tons of people in our\ncommunity who said I can't handle this\nthis is like too messy for my mental\nhealth because every time I come here\nit's just like it's just vomit of\ncomplaints complaints complaints and our\nmods have done a phenomenal job of\ncleaning up the community and keeping it\nwith a forward\nmomentum so complaining should be a step\nto progress and it becomes unhealthy\nwhen that's where we end up with it\nbecause if we never change anything then\nwe keep on feeling bad and all we do is\ncomplain complain\ncomplain and sometimes this happens in\nin safe spaces where it's just a bunch\nof people complaining about stuff\nwithout actually making taking steps to\nimprove their\nlives right so there's some amount of\nvalidation which can be very helpful but\nthen validation is a step to\nsomething so that's you know that's the\ndifference between healthy complaining\nand unhealthy\ncomplaining\nwhy does complaining about stuff we\ncan't do anything about feel so good if\ncomplaining is only here to help us in\nlife what a great question so remember\nthat complaining is doing something\nright so complaining is all about\nemotional expression which is doing\nsomething and how is that helpful so\nunderstand this when a negative emotion\nis dominating your mind it becomes very\neasy to become hopeless to feel like you\ncan't do anything to fix the problem so\none of the most fundamental steps when\nyou're dealing with a negative emotion\nis to vent the negative emotion from\nyour mind so that your mind can Now\noperate clearly and once your mind can\noperate clearly you may be able to fix\nan unfixable problem my favorite example\nof this is someone who gets dumped who\nthinks that I will never date again\nbecause I am unlovable they just need to\nvent that negative emotion and then they\nwill start to see that if they got into\none relationship chances are they can\nget into another and that generally\nspeaking most human beings are capable\nof relationships like 99% of us we just\nneed to be in the right frame of mind so\ncomplaining is absolutely an emotional\nstep and then once it clears our mind\nhopefully we're able to do something\nelse great\nquestion\nokay all right let's talk about porn\naddiction by the way this stuff about\nstruggling with the idea of being a man\nthis is what the two of our lectures are\ngoing to touch on this\nokay so two of our starting lectures are\ngoing to if if this was if yall are\ninterested in learning more about this\nwe're doing one uh lecture specifically\non how to manage expectations as a man\nso what are the expectations that you\nwhat's the what are the expectations\nthat are placed upon you how do you\nnavigate those and embrace some and shed\nthe others and then there's also a\nlecture on healthy masculinity which I\nthink is related to this\ntoo so if yall are interested in those\nlectures join up with memberships\nthey're coming this\nmonth\nokay can you fully recover from porn I\nwent like over a year without porn I\nrecently relapsed after discovering a\nloophole in my blocking system oh my\ngoodness outsmarted by yourself and man\nit felt just like it did when I was\naddicted the same rush I spent like\nthree weeks binging almost every day\nafter work I closed the loophole only to\ndiscover\nmore honestly I found the process of\nuncovering loopholes pretty addictive\ntoo yeah I can imagine anyway I'm just\ncurious about what this means for over a\nyear I kind of forgot that porn existed\nI never felt tempted and I just lived\nporn free and now I'm being back to\nbeing a a full-blown addict is there a\npoint where I'll be free or do I always\nhave to live in fear of my addict self\npopping its head out of\nnowhere so this is such a great question\nand so many things about it are so true\nof life and so much of it is we got to\nunderstand that this stuff you can you\ncan really be free of this in in some\nways but it's in\nAttitude\nokay so let's understand how to be free\nfrom porn\naddiction so in order to understand how\nto be free from porn addiction we have\nto do two things one is we have to\nunderstand porn addiction and second is\nwe have to understand freedom and the\nbiggest mistake that most addicts make\nis they do not understand\nFreedom most of y'all can understand the\naddiction with just a little bit of\nteaching it's really an understanding\nFreedom that a lot of addicts really\nreally really get messed up okay so\nfirst let's learn about porn addiction\nso the first thing is why do we get\naddicted to porn we get addicted to porn\nfor two reasons so all addictions share\ntwo properties one is all addictions\nmake us feel better and second is they\nstop us from feel feeling bad these are\ntwo very discreet\nthings so one is it takes me when I'm\nfeeling normal and makes me feel good\nand the second is when I'm feeling bad\nit makes me feel normal or it makes me\nfeel good so they bring pleasure and\nthey take away pain now a lot of times\npeople think about pornography and\naddictions they just think about the\nfirst thing they think about making me\nfeel\nbetter and so pornography is\ndopaminergic masturbation is\ndopaminergic orgasm is dopaminergic it's\nalways going to make you feel\ngood but if we really look at addictions\nit's not just the feeling good that\ncreates the problem it's actually taking\naway the negativity that is the real\nproblem with porn\naddiction so porn addiction is like some\nkind of cheat code for\nemotional feeling good so if we look at\nlike literally our brain our brain has\nthis part of our there's a part of our\nbrain called the amydala and the lyic\nsystem this is where we feel negative\nemotions this is a very primitive part\nof the brain right so like you can even\nfind an amydala in like rodents and\nreptiles and probably even fish in some\nway so we all have this capacity for\nnegativity now if we look at things that\nyou can do that make the negativity go\naway instantly pornography is at the top\nof the\nlist so anytime I'm feeling negative\nemotions even if I'm not aware of them\nby the way which you don't need to\nbe porn will make that go away so it's\nvery very effective and if you look at\npeople who are addicted to\npornography the most common thing is a\nsense of meaninglessness in life so it's\nnot even necessarily like a very\npowerful shame or something like that\nthe most common thing is actually like\nboredom like not doing anything and so\nliterally the way that I would describe\nthis is like it's not like we're doing\nanything anyway we might as well watch\nsome porn this is the sentiment that\nI've that I've seen the most commonly\nwith people who are addicted to\npornography might as\nwell so if you want to be free from porn\naddiction you've got to do two things\nthe most important thing is you have to\nhave an alternate way to deal with your\nnegative emotional states you need\nsomething that works better than the\npornography because when your brain is\nhurting it's going to go for whatever\nworks that's how the brain works when\nyou're thirsty your brain is like let's\nget some water that's how it works when\nit's emotionally hurting it's going to\ndo whatever it can to bring itself back\nto equilibrium which is pornography so\nif you want to be free from porn you\nneed some way to manage your emotions\nyou can meditate you can exercise you\ncan see a therapist you can eat\nhealthier you can do whatever you want\nto you can think you can Journal\nwhatever but you need some consistent\nway to manage your negative\nemotions okay second thing is you need\nsome kind of structure to stay away from\nfrom pornography so it sounds like this\nperson developed some kind of system the\nproblem is that you can develop some\nkind of system but as long as the\nunderlying drive is not addressed you\nwill eventually\nrelapse now the second thing that this\nperson asked can you be free from\npornography addiction now this is where\naddicts make one big mistake with\nunderstanding\nFreedom they talk about Freedom as if\nit's\nforever right but this is the key thing\nthat you need to understand if you want\nto conquer an addiction don't think\nabout forever think about today so what\npeople want is they want a freedom they\nwant a relaxation they want oh my God\nI'm free I don't ever have to worry\nabout this again so if we stop and think\nabout it what do they want to be free\nfrom they want to be free from the worry\nthey want to be free from the struggle\nthey want to be free from the negative\nemotions that come with pornography\naddiction the\neffort right and so you don't get\nfreedom in that way this is the first\nthing you've got to understand you can't\nbe free from negative emotion the reason\nthat you want to be free from negative\nemotion is because porn is what you do\nto fix it right so the only way to get\nrid of the for porn addiction forever is\nto feel good forever doesn't work like\nthat good news is doesn't need to so\nlet's understand something basic about\nfreedom and\naddiction freedom of addiction is one in\nthe moment you don't win it in the\nfuture so any day that you do not use\nporn you are free from it in a\nsense okay so you don't worry about\nforever worry about today worry about to\ntoday when tomorrow rolls around worry\nabout today worry about today what are\nyou going to do today what are you going\nto do today what are you going to do\ntoday what are you going to do today\ndon't worry about\ntomorrow now this is where people will\nsay but that's so\nexhausting right I Want to Be Free tell\nme how to be free so that I don't have\nto work anymore that's why people want\nfreedom I don't want to work anymore I\ndon't have work at it so the good news\nis it will get easier over time so your\nbrain will\nrewire right so you should focus on\ntoday but every day is going to get\neasier there may be hard days in there\nbut on the trend over the whole every\nday will get easier and there will reach\na point where it will essentially be\nthat you are free from pornography that\nyou don't think about it because you've\ndeveloped so many neuronal habits your\nneurons have wired in a particular way\nwhere they're quite habitual where you\ndon't even think about it sounds like\nthe person did it for a year if you can\ndo it for one you can do it for two\nright there's nothing magical on day\n366 it's just on a given day you will\nslip up and you can slip up after one\nyear or 5 years or 10 years or 20 years\nyou can always slip up so in that sense\nare you ever free from it who knows I'm\ngoing to go ahead and say\nno and why am I saying no is it true not\nnecessarily but I need you to believe\nthat there is no\nFreedom why because if you believe there\nis no Freedom then you accept that there\nis a struggle on a daily\nbasis and the moment that you accept\nthat you grieve it and you say [ __ ] it I\ngot to take my medicine it's going to be\nbitter it's going to suck this is where\nthe freedom from addiction really comes\nfrom freedom from addiction comes from\nthe fact that there is no freedom from\naddiction and once you realize that this\nis a lifelong enemy that you're going to\nbe living with and dealing with on a\ndaily basis then you will deal with it\ndifferently\nyou will stop fantasizing about freedom\nfrom it and you're like how do I become\nfree how do I become free you're looking\nfor a license to be la for the rest of\nyour life and it's in looking for that\nlicense for laziness for the rest of\nyour life that you do the most\ndamage it's going to be a struggle every\nday so be it that's\nlife y'all get\nthat everyone's like oh I I want to be\nfree from work of course you want to be\nfree from work I want to be free from\nwork too\nbut that's not\nlife right you have to decide what you\nwant this life to be do you want a life\nof\nease everyone's like yeah obviously like\nI want it too but it's okay not having\nit perfect right it's okay to enjoy the\nmoments of ease that you get and it's\nokay to work during the other\ntimes and I will tell you that the worst\nthing that you can do for yourself is a\nlife of ease\nbottom of my heart I believe this\n100% I've seen people have a life of\nI've addiction Psychiatry I've seen\ntrust fund babies who have an unlimited\namount of wealth and boy are they\nmiserable drugs drugs and more drugs\nbecause you're not [ __ ] doing\nanything with your\nlife it's\nawful and I want Financial Freedom too\ndon't get me wrong like it's great\nsounds great but I'll tell youall\nsomething very important about the the\nmind in the human\nbeing is a fundamental principle of\nbiology the body and mind do not wear\nout they\nrust we're very cool that way we're the\nonly thing in nature that gets better\nwith\nusage\nlife any inanimate object will decline\nover\ntime but if you want to be the\nhealthiest human you need to be using\nyourself learning a new instrument\nhaving a\npet playing chess learning a new\nlanguage all of these things are\nprotective against\ndementia when you breathe really hard at\nthe gym you are not shortening your\nlifespan because you're using all of\nyour energy up it's quite the opposite\nthe more you use

in\nwhich case [ __ ]\nyou but the rest of us are addicted to a\n50% win rate because the struggle is\nwhat feels good when do you love playing\nthe game why can't you all stop playing\n[ __ ] video games it's not because of\nthe ones that you win it's the ones that\nyou win that you should have lost that\nkeep you addicted and this is what life\nis\nlike\nright so stop looking for a free past if\nyou're going to be struggling with porn\naddiction for the rest of your life you\nstruggle with it for the rest of your\nlife accept\nit the good news shockingly I know it's\ncrazy this may be a little bit un\nempathic but the good news is that there\nis so much more to life than struggling\nwith porn addiction can you ever be free\nof it I don't\nknow but what I can guarantee is you

although it\ndefinitely gets easier over time we know\nthat we know that very\nwell so it will get easier over time but\ndon't try to look for a pass that in and\nof itself is what reinforces the\naddiction and this is why people at\nAlcoholics Anonymous figured this\nout I'm celebrating my 40th year sober\nhi my name is Alo and I am an\nalcoholic period never goes\naway because it's when you let your\nguard down that the addiction wins this\nis the principle of addiction the number\none reason that people get owned by\naddiction is they think they're the ones\nin control and if you have friends who\nare addicted you know you know what I'm\ntalking about they're like oh yeah I\ndon't have a problem I would have a\nproblem if dot dot dot here's where I am\nand people who are over here have the\nproblem and then if I move over here\nthen I'm going to say people over here\nhave a problem oh yeah people who use\nevery day they're the ones who who have\na problem and then you start using every\nday and someone was like hey didn't you\nsay that people who use every day have a\nproblem you're like no no no but like\nI'm Different I don't use a lot I just\nuse it to mellow out a little bit\nthere's some people who really dependent\non it need it to have a good time I can\nhave a good time without it I just\nchoose not\nto and so you always think oh I've got\nthis under control I can handle it I can\nhandle it I'm in control control I can\nquit drinking whenever I\nwant I do this because I choose to those\nare the people who stay\naddicted so admit that it's going to be\na struggle admit that you're not in\ncontrol admit that it's a fight and you\ncould win and you could lose that's how\nyou break an\naddiction got\nit okay you got want to do one more post\nor a question or\nwhat shall we do a tick talk ticking\ntalking Tik\nTok Tik Tok\nreact yeah so speaking of of addictions\nand Stoners and whatnot so this is this\nis one thing\nso you know if yall want

porn addiction\nevery now and then but I'd love to do a\ndeep dive and so that's our goal with\nmemberships is really to have you all\nchoose what we lecture on so we can do\nan hour or two or whatever youall\nwant\num\nokay\nquestions Dr K was just wondering if you\nhave any tips for recovering from\nburnout depression with all or nothing\nthinking um so I think when it comes to\nburnout and depression one of the most\nunderutilized tools is like cleaning and\ndiet so I I think that I know it's kind\nof weird\nbut\nso back when I was in my early days as a\nmonk I was at this one particular asham\nwhen I got invited to join a\ncult and so the way that this looked or\nthis is what I thought was happening is\nat the end of one class I'd been there\nfor about two\nmonths and someone comes up to me\nafterward and they're like hey there's\nthis like you know this like secret part\nof the there's this one road that no one\nis allowed to go down and they told me\nthat hey you should you know next\nTuesday at 10:00 a.m. you should walk\ndown the road until you see the hut\nand I'm like what Hut and he's like\nthere's a Hut you should come I think\nyou're ready I was like okay this is how\npeople join Cults so I went down the\nroad and sure enough there's a Hut and\nin the Hut is a Swami who's kind of like\na monk and so I started joining this\nclass like six other people and it was\nlike the secret class right where the\nsecret knowledge is bestowed but the\nthing about the the class is that every\nday when I would walk out walk towards\nthe Hut I would see that outside the Hut\nis a plate a bowl a spoon and a cup\ndrying in the\nSun and then one day I asked the the\nSwami who was teaching the class I was\nlike you know what's up with the plate\nthe bowl the spoon and the cup and the\nSwami told me that the one thing that he\nhas to do every day is clean his own\ndishes and that without cleaning his own\ndishes he cannot sit down to meditate\nthe people in the asham will provide the\nfood they can do the cooking they'll\nbring him one meal a day which he has\nbut then the one thing he's got to do is\nhe's got to clean himself because his\njust doesn't function without cleaning\nand I don't know what it is but\nsomething about cleaning your\nenvironment is very very helpful to the\nMind actually we have some hypotheses of\nwhy that happens but I don't know why\nmaybe it's something about the mobility\nI think it has something to do with like\nusing physical motion that is mentally\nengaging enough to where you have to\nsomewhat pay attention but allows your\nmind to run on autopilot cleaning is\nalmost like a poor person's EMDR if\nyouall know what that is so I moved\ndesensitization retraining or whatever\nis a treatment for trauma and what we\nessentially do in\nEMDR is we have someone Focus their eyes\nin a particular pattern so it requires\ncognitive attention and we ask them to\nrecall or even we'll read back or have\nthem talk about traumatic experiences so\nnormally when we discuss or talk about\ntraumatic experiences it triggers a\nphysiologic response our adrenaline\nshoots the roof our cortisol goes up\nbecause recalling the trauma creates a\nflashback\nbut when we do EMDR and someone is\nfocusing on something else it blunts the\nphysiologic response instead of being in\nthe trauma I'm just kind of like\ndistractedly doing it on the side while\nI'm focused on something else kind of\nlike having a conversation with your\nsignificant other when you're browsing\nthe internet on your phone right so\nyou're not like mentally there so we've\nused that principle to treat people with\ntrauma and cleaning is really\ninteresting because when we clean I\nthink it does something very similar\nwhere our mind has 50% autopilot it's\njust kind of processing and then at the\nsame time we're sort of doing something\na little bit physical so we don't get\nlost in our thoughts when we clean so my\ntip is\nclean if a person is in denial of harsh\ntruths to save getting their feelings\nhurt does that lead to schizophrenia I\ndon't think so but it's very possible\nthat there is a psychoanalytic theory\nthat says so so I I'm of the Mind of a\nlittle bit more biological mind of what\ncauses schizophrenia which is that it's\nlike probably like a pretty discreet\nbiological process I think schizophrenia\nis one of the\nmore less psychological of illnesses\nalthough I'm no expert in\nschizophrenia\nokay I guess last question and then\nwe're done for the day but this is a\ndating one I guess\nhey Dr K I think I have gotten a crush\non a girl but there is a real\npossibility that if I ask her out or\nconfess we may never talk again ending\nour friendship is paralyzing me any\nadvice yes so much advice number one\nadvice if you have a crush on someone no\nconfessions no confessions confessions\nare terrible let's understand\nwhy so if you have a crush on someone\nyou have this you have a little bit of\nemotion your love starts down here okay\nI'm not pointing to my penis I'm trying\nto point to my belly button so love\nstarts in the belly button and works its\nway up to the chest and when it gets to\nabout the throat right so this is like\nit starts down here with butterflies in\nthe stomach and then we feel that aching\nover here and if we let the love build\nup too much it ends up in our throat is\na lump and we can't say anything and\nthen we feel crippled that's how love\nworks physiologically it's scientific\nokay so when you're in a relationship\nwith someone let's say who's a friend\nand you signal to them that you're\nattracted to them and that you want to\ngo on a date confessing means letting\nall this crap that is built up out so\nyou're not just\nlike telling them you're dumping all of\nthis like pent up love and oh my God I\nneed you so bad oh I've been loving you\nfor all of this time and I need you in\nmy\nlife right you can't dump that [ __ ] on\npeople come\non and this is why everyone has this bad\nimpression of like confessing your\nfeelings for a friend this is why\neveryone thinks it's so hard damn hard\nto get out of the friend zone it's\nbecause they're you're strapped into\n[ __ ] rocket and they're on a donkey\nand you guys are just moving at\ncompletely different Paces remember that\nwhen you have been in love with someone\nfor a long\ntime you have had a chance to\nacclimatize to that right you've been\nloving this person for like 10 years and\nso you're used to that level of Love\nthey're just figuring it out for the\nfirst time and you're dumping 10 years\nof feelings on them or six months\nwhatever your case is so number one is\ndon't\nconfess right this is what ends the\nrelationship second thing is if you want\nto ask someone out you can ask them out\nbut I know this is absolutely insane but\nif you have a friend and y'all are\nfriends and you want to preserve the\nfriendship you have one card that you\ncan play that none of the alpar red\npillars can play because they're not\nfriends with women\nyou get to have a friendly\nconversation you get to say Hey you are\nmy friend I value you as a friend and\nI've noticed some feelings kind of\narising up where I've started to think\nabout you in like a slightly romantic\nway I was hoping to have a conversation\nwith you about this you were going to\napproach it from as a friend what should\nI do with these feelings help me figure\nout what should I do with these\nfeelings right let's figure this out as\nfriends this is a shared problem in our\nrelationship which is maybe I've got\nsome romantic feelings and you put the\nball in their court let them know what's\ngoing on now if someone wants to sever a\nfriendship with you because of that\nright like that's you can't really\ncontrol that but usually having worked\nwith a ton of I'm assuming that this is\na guy talking about a girl having worked\nwith a ton of women they don't have a\nproblem with you telling them that you\nhave feelings they have a problem with\nwith a confession pressure and guilt\nwhich if you approach it as a friend you\ncan say hey these are feelings that we\ncan talk about what should I do with\nthese\nfeelings now one of several things will\nhappen one is they will maybe they'll\nrun away but generally speaking I don't\nthink that's going to happen because we\ndon't handle the conversation right as\ndudes it's a confession oh my God we\ndon't know how to talk about emotions\nwithout vomiting them all over the place\nso just like talk about them just be\nlike hey sometimes like I've been having\nsome some weird thoughts like romantic\nthoughts\nsexual don't say anything\nsexual okay nothing sexual just use hey\nI've been having some like kind of\nromantic\nfeelings is this something that's ever\ncome up for you is this something that\nwe should explore or is it something\nthat I should like go talk to a\ntherapist about right so just like lay\nit out there for them to play with\nbecause that's what happens in a\nrelationship the problem with all these\nconfessions is that you've created all\nthis stuff in your head and then you\ndump it on the other and the other\nperson's like what is this where did\nthis come from you built up this weird\nskyscraper about what who I am and what\nour relationship is you all are friends\nyou work through it\ntogether other cool thing is that often\ntimes you will find that when you do\nthis it works out really\nwell you will discover that wow they\nwill actually see you as an emotionally\navailable person and they may have some\ndegree of Attraction as well but the\nfact that y'all can actually talk about\nit like human beings is like a step up\nin your favor\nand I think like people say it's\nimpossible to get out of the friend zone\nyou should move on I mean like yeah you\nshould move on if someone's not\ninterested in you but I think that I\nwant to say like 30 or 40 the perc of\nthe relationships that I've seen people\nstart out as\nfriends like it happens quite a bit like\npeople move out of the friend zone all\nthe time happens a\nlot the problem that we run into is we\nget so caught up about doing it that we\nput all of our eggs into one basket we\nwant to force it that is actually what\nsabotage is\nin right so the right move is to confess\nyour love not confess but let everyone\nknow that you're having romantic\nthoughts if they're your\nfriends right so I I think don't confess\nyour love oh my god dude so much to\nhandle just let them know like hey like\nI sometimes have these\nfeelings and then watch them get\nflustered be like hey would you ever you\nknow want to\nconsider changing this relationship and\nI I I wouldn't say more than being\nFriends by the way don't ever say more\nthan friends because it implies that\nother things are greater than friendship\nfriendship is equal to romance right\nwhen you start treating it that\nway people will receive it a lot\nbetter would you ever be interested in\nexploring something besides\nfriendship right just ask and if they\nget turned off and they ghost you and\nstuff like that you you get your signal\nand then you talk it through then you\nmake a decision and then you're done if\nthey they're not recept\nthen you move\non and don't be surprised when you move\non that they change their tune because\nit\nhappens so just be casual about it\nabsolutely there's nothing more\nattractive than being\ncasual in other words don't act needy\nand desperate haha yes that is correct\nfrom jelle no less so pay attention boys\nand\ngirls so Mr pushup is saying lost me a\nhome girl because of this and that's\nokay right it's\nokay if we want to make healthy\nrelationships we have to be willing to\nlose relationships that's part of making\na healthy relationship it has to be\ntested and strengthened and is born with\nconflict that's how it\nhappens packets is saying Dr K what if I\nwant to meet a girl casually in a bar\nthen stop hanging out here as my\nguess go meet a girl casually in a\nbar\nright look everyone's saying confidence\nis sexy casual is confidence yeah so\nlook let me explain something to y'all\nokay so sure all that stuff is true but\njust forget about being confident or\nsexy for the other person you're trying\nto attract just think about yourself for\na moment how do you want to live your\nlife do you want to live your life with\nall these worries in your head oh my God\nwhat if she says this and what if I\nconfess all my feelings and what if she\ndoesn't like it oh my God oh my God oh\nmy God oh my God just chill the [ __ ] out\nman like look if she doesn't like it she\ndoesn't like it if he doesn't like it he\ndoesn't like it you are going to be\ntranquil up here right so you have some\nfeelings hey I've got this feeling like\nit's like this cup of water and like\nmaybe I can drink from\nit that's how it should\nbe right you want this job you can tell\npeople hey I'm really interested in this\njob I'm excited about it for this this\nand this\nreason the problem is when we let our\nexcitement become an attachment the\nproblem is when we start planning around\nsomething that hasn't happened yet so\nlet go of the attachment let go of\neverything you attach to this\ninteraction your selfworth as a man oh\nmy God she won't talk to me this one\nperson rejected me and now I don't feel\nlike a man that's okay one person\nrejected you there are a thousand\nreasons why people reject other people\nthat have nothing to do with you biggest\nmistake that we make in our societies we\ntake rejections\npersonally right and the reason we do\nthat is because some people try to make\nit\npersonal so don't get so caught up in\nhere just be chill about it right you\nwant to be chilled not for confidence or\nattraction or anything like that like\nokay so do I want this person saying no\nto ruin a month of my life or three\nmonths of my life the answer is no okay\nso I'm going to be chill about it right\nI'll feel hurt you acknowledge that so\nhow do you be chill about it you accept\nfirst of all that there's a part of you\nthat does not want to be chill that's\nstep number one to being chill except\nthat you don't want to be\nchill step number\ntwo is you don't get caught up in here\nso literally if we look at what does it\nmean to be chill it means spending less\nspace up here so if we look at something\nlike a panic attack which is the exact\nopposite of chill literally what happens\nin the mind with a panic attack we\nperseverate or ruminate on a particular\nthought the more that your mind turns a\nthought over and over and over and over\nand over in your head the less chill you\nwill be so literally to not think about\nit is to be less chill so then the\nquestion becomes but Dr K how do I not\nthink about it very simple look at the\nscenarios in which you do think about\nit so you think about it when your mind\nis Idle you think about it when you've\nbeen playing too many video games you\nthink about it in that post-nut Clarity\nyou think about it before you go to bed\nyou don't think about it when you\nspending time with your dog you don't\nthink about it when you're spending time\nwith your friends you don't think about\nit when you're reading a really good\nbook\nor when you're super engaged in a video\ngame right so number one is notice that\nyou're attached number two is literally\nspend time doing other things with your\nmind not just a distraction so this is\nimportant some people will make it a\ndistraction to keep it at Bay and the\nmoment the distraction goes away the\nthoughts return we want to do something\nthat engages the mind not distracts the\nmind and Once the mind has had some\nengagement so I would say like adopt a\nproject like do something a little bit\ncreative like put something out there\ninto the world then the mind will be a\nlittle bit fatigued it'll have that less\nof excess energy and if it has less\nexcess energy you will be less likely to\nruminate we have a whole lecture on this\non Dr K's guided anxiety by the way\naround thought Loops if you all want a\nbetter understanding of\nthat and this is how you be chill and\nthe third thing that you can do is think\nabout the long term right this one\nperson there's a thousand other people\nout there just give this a shot and\nthink about even if this does not work\nwell your goal in this if it works out\ngreat if it doesn't work out you will\nget better at managing\nyourself so everything in life is about\ncreating a better you for tomorrow now\nyou've been rejected by one person this\nwill make the second rejection easier\nyou've leveled up a little bit so think\nabout the long game then when you have\nthose three\nthings your conversation with this\nperson will be easier right because when\nthey say no you're not torn out of shape\nyou can say thank you very much for\ntelling me how you feel I hope that this\ncan I hope we can still continue to\nmaintain a friendship if it becomes\nweird for you please let me know if it\nbecomes hard for for me I will let you\nknow and then you fist bump and then you\nmove on with your\nlife right so this is how we we get so\ncaught up with our attachments because\nit's all we give our mind time to\ndo\nand then if you guys really want number\nfour which will both sometimes create\njealousy but you know a week or two\nlater you ask said friend you can say\nhey anyone you can set me up with I'm\ninterested in\ndating right so this is what people\ndon't understand about the friend zone\nfriend zone is a great place to meet\nwomen if we're talking about a dude and\na girl or vice versa right or friend\nzone for people who are gay totally\nworks just ask people to introduce you\nto other\npeople right and that signals to your\nfriend that you're not interested in\nthem you've moved\non and hopefully they don't get butt\nhurt about it but sometimes they will\nand then they'll start playing games\nwith you because they actually are\nattracted to you and now you\nknow right it's a\nwin-win that feels manipul I can imagine\nit's the purpose is not to so here's the\nthing manipulation\nis\nabout shaping someone else's\nBehavior okay so we're not doing this to\nshape their behavior this is I I have a\nbig problem with people who are\nmanipulative we're not doing this to be\nmanipulative we're not trying to get\nthem we're not trying to make them\njealous all I'm saying is that you\nshouldn't be stupid about this may\nexcite some jealousy if it if there was\nsome degree of Attraction it may float\nto the surface which is fine right and\nthen you as friends you will talk\nthrough it\nit's it's not to try to get her to like\nyou in fact that's the wrong thinking\nthat's not being chill about it that's\nbeing overly attached that's unhealthy\nfor you and unhealthy for\nthem yeah so I wonder how people who\ncan't even ask the other one out imagine\nthe relationship will go that's the\nthing right so so at some point we've\ngot to stop imagining and start\ndoing you will do so much better when\nyou start collecting data instead of\nrunning\nhypotheticals hi Dr K how do you\npersonally weigh your innate goodness\nand morality against the temporary and\nimpulsive streamer sense to perform you\nseem to be as true of yourself as you\nare a streamer well yeah so let's cool\nquestion let's understand a couple\nthings the reason I'm myself as a\nstreamer is because this is what I am in\nreal life so the cool thing about\nstreaming is that you don't have to be\nsomething else I mean some people are\nbut it's too cognitively exhausting like\nto for me to try to be something I'm\njust not and this is who I am and people\nwho I mean I imagine there's some people\nwho are watching this or who may watch\nthis who know who I am in real life and\nthe really frustrating thing is that\neven my kids like recognize that there's\nDr K and my one of my kids actually\ntrolls me about it now she like makes\nfun of me for being Dr K it's actually\nreally cute and I love her for\nit so the other thing is that I don't I\ndon't I don't think I have innate\ngoodness or morality for the\nrecord and so the only thing that I try\nto perform is I try to be myself and I\ntry to be a good version of myself so\nnot the most degenerate but I think part\nof what makes me I think I mean I'm\nassuming I'm I'm a good streamer here\nbut I think part of what resonates with\npeople is that I'm not I'm a little bit\ndegenerate right like we all\nare to be honest and so it's like I I I\ndon't I mean I'm not like innately good\nin fact I think that the real struggle\nso I to just tell you all a\nstory so I was in my second year of\nPsychiatry training I had an attending\nwho was\nbrilliant and was like told me that hey\nso I see that you're very capable but I\nencourage you to use your capability for\ngood instead of evil\nbecause I think she accurately assessed\nthat I have a side of me that is not\ngood like I'm very good with people but\nlike I can get people to do good things\nor I can get people to do bad things and\nshe was an awesome teacher and one of\nthe few people who saw that quality\nwithin me oras everyone else just\nthought I was like a really nice guy but\nshe's like I can see that some of your\nniess is crafted and just don't be an\nevil person and even to this day I I'm\ngrateful to her and I took her advice to\nHeart\nand I'm Not Great by any\nmeans I'm a degenerate just like y'all\ninstead of doing my work this morning I\nplayed about 40 minutes of against the\nthe storm which is a great game that\nyall should check out by the way if\ny'all are into Rog light city\nbuilders um\nyeah yeah so I'm I I try to be the good\nkind of degenerate and and the reason so\nhere's the difference between a good\ndegenerate and a bad\ndegenerate\na good degenerate loves their degeneracy\nand a bad degenerate demonizes their\ndegeneracy so the whole point of being a\ndegenerate is we're [ __ ] human man\nlike we're we're designed to become\nobese we're designed to be lazy we're\ndesigned to be efficient do you all\nunderstand that laziness and efficiency\nis the same\nthing it's like to do more with less\nlike that's encourages laziness like\nthat's why we do things right we are so\nefficient and we are so lazy as a race\nthat we have developed\ntechnology that has become so\nAdvanced that we literally now force\nourselves to go to a gymnasium to\nuselessly lift weight up and down with\nno purpose in mind we literally going to\na place and we're like lifting weight up\nand down we're doing work for no\nobjective like these muscles were\ndesigned to lift things and carry them\nfrom point A to point B to lift other\nhuman beings or fight predators and\ninstead we literally will manufacture\nhunks of iron and just lift them\nrepetitively like [ __ ] Geral on\nhamster\nwheels because we've gotten so efficient\nI can haul my ass to a car which will\nthen save me the work of walking I will\ntake elevators to save me the work of\nstairs and I will even not even have to\nwalk to the car and I will now use this\nthing to send some electrons out into\nthe universe that will then deliver me\ntacos to my front door this is how\nefficient and lazy we are as people we\njust have to understand this this is\npart of who we are and you have a\ndegenerate within you who doesn't want\nto do anything today and that's okay\nthat person is not the enemy that's\nyou the problem is when we demonize it\nsometimes we win and sometimes it wins\nand when it wins it punishes us for all\nthe war crime crimes that we've\ncommitted to it I've taken that\ndegeneracy and I have told it that it is\na terrible human being and I've torn it\napart and instead I'm going to be a uber\nChad a side hustle\nHustler and now you can purchase my\ncourse on how to side hustle how to\nhustle people into side hustling which\nis my my nth tier\nhustle this is what we've\nbecome photons not\nelectrons thank you\n[Music]\nStephen right so like it's okay to be a\nlittle bit of a degenerate everyone's\nlike oh like I used to be such a loser\nand like now I'm so great I'm like braah\nI was a loser then I'm a loser now you\ndon't have to be a loser doesn't have to\nDefine you you can continue to be a\nloser and still be very successful\nworked really well for\nme seriously that's what y'all should do\njust just do it like it's so it's okay\nlike you're a little bit degenerate and\nsome days the degenerate is going to\nwin and how upset can you really be\nright cuz hey you had fun that day said\ngood job degenerate thanks for giving us\na break we got to do some work today can\nyou help me out can you try really hard\nnot to sabotage me\nfurther\num okay there is a question last\nquestion then we're going okay FDI is\nasking hey Dr K after my first\nrelationship I've had a lot of success\nwith let's say superficial dating which\ngrew old fairly fast and now after\nhaving been in a lot of those I haven't\nbeen able to find anyone to have\nsomething deeper anymore what should I\ndo so if you've had a meaningful\nrelationship followed by a string of\nempty or shallow\nrelationships two options one is that\nyou haven't found the right person right\nwhich is very possible the second though\nis that you're not really emotionally\nopen to something\ndeeper so the main question is how did\nyour first relationship end and if you\nreally fully like recovered from that do\nyou have space in you for another\nrelationship like that and often times\nwhat happens when our first relationship\nends is we get kind of scarred over\nright this is what happens anytime we\nhave a wound the body and the mind will\nscar over it this is why people who are\ntraumatized will repress memories like\nit's literally how we function by\nlogically and so if you're having\ntrouble forming a connection I'd really\nlike look at what was the aftermath of\nyour first relationship and are you\nreally ready to meet someone or do you\nwant to be in that kind of relationship\nagain because you may not be ready yet\nyou may not want it right so I'd kind of\nprocess the old relationship and make\nsure that you're emotionally available\nfor a new\none okay all right so we're at time for\ntoday chat been at this almost three\nhours so one last time we we are sharing\nour big announcement for the day which\nis that we are launching YouTube\nmemberships and reason we're doing\nmemberships is because we want to teach\nmore advanced in-depth stuff that is\nchosen by y'all and so our membership is\n999 a month for four lectures a month\nthe lectures are one hour in length\nfollowed by Q&A all delivered live and I\nthink they should be available as vods\nafterward part of the reason that we\nwant y'all to sign up is because every\nmonth we will vote and I will spend 6\nto8 hours preparing whatever lectures\ny'all want me to prepare so this is\ncommunity meets content we also get\nfreed from a lot of these standard\nproblems that we run into with content\ngeneration number one we're not victims\nto the algorithm anymore y'all can ask\nme to make a video that will tank in the\ngeneral YouTube algorithm and that is\nwhat I will prepare a lecture on right\nnow we got to play the game because\nwe're on YouTube That's what everyone\nhas to do second thing is we get to go\nto more advanced topics so the idea is\nto create the for all the members who\nhave hopefully been you know cuz y'all\nare like watching these and paying money\nright so this is these are people who\nare going to be interested in this stuff\nthen we can get to more advanced things\nso we can do longitudinal things like\nsomeone was asking about tips about\nmeditation so we can do multiple\nlectures on meditation for whatever\ny'all decide so every month y'all get to\nvote I will prepare the lectures we will\ndeliver them live it'll be four a month\nit's not necessarily one a week so\nsometimes we'll cluster things sometimes\nit'll be a little more spread out and\nthis in no way\nimpacts the rest of the content that we\nmake we will continue putting out\nlectures deep Dives YouTube videos as we\nnormally do\nstreams last thing is we have a second\npricing tier of$ 14.99 for people who\nwant to give us more money it's\nliterally what it's about you will get\naccess to some features that other\npeople the the Bas tier doesn't get but\nthose are features like right in the\nfields or early access to other things\nthat we're building but really the\nreason to do that is if you want to just\ngive us more\nmoney simple what does the money do the\nmoney does everything that all of the\nother money does so that's how we\ncontinue to make free content we have\nlike a research team we have an editing\nteam things like that right so we'll\ncontinue building stuff like right in\nthe fields is a community event that\nrequired a lot of moderation Dev time to\nprogram new features all of that was\ncompletely free we also do a lot of\nresearch so it'll fund all that stuff\nit's just going where all the other\nmoney is going um building a guide is a\nsignificant investment too so we had to\nbuild those before we could charge for\nthem if that kind of makes sense so it\ngives us Runway as a company to like try\nbuilding new things that's really what\nwe want it\nfor will there be more streams on\nYouTube yes we will continue our regular\nstreaming schedule on Twitch and\nYouTube okay the way we arrived at the\nprice is we saw what other people were\ndoing and we saw that a lot of lot of\npeople are having like $6 memberships or\nwhatever for like basically nothing or I\nmean not nothing you get Badges and\nwhatever but we were sort of trying to\nthink about how can we keep things\naffordable for people who are from\ncountries where the dollar doesn't do\nwell so we've heard a lot of feedback\nabout things like Coach Price coaching\npricing and stuff like that I mean\nthat's just a challenge that we face so\nwe're this is also the cheapest thing\nthat we've ever offered and we're trying\nto really pack it with value so you\nreally get your money's\nworth\nokay that's a lot of streams overall yes\nit is so I will be spending about 30 to\n40% of my time every week working on\nmembership related\nstuff um will these lectures always be\nmember only I don't know is the short\nanswer so if we wanted to change that\none day we would ask the\nmembers\nis how I would I'm thinking about it now\nI mean I I don't know though I mean it's\npossible that after six months or\nsomething we'll release them I don't\nknow but there there are no plans to\nmake them publicly available at this\npoint\num yeah and then there's the emotes and\nstuff\ntoo yeah so there's someone from Brazil\nand stuff like that like we get that\nright so even\nthough we we get all kinds of you know\nwe try to do what we can and we've have\nyou know people in 121 countries\nincluding places like swasiland\nand Ethiopia and stuff like that so\nwe're doing what we\ncan\num there will be vods of the lectures\nthat we do for members there will be a\nVOD of this too\ntoday are you still doing interviews\nyeah I think we've got an interview\ncoming up soon\nhopefully let me\nsee\n[Music]\nokay there's Reddit review stream on\nADHD yeah looks like we're doing an\ninterview in about two\nweeks and maybe\nmore okay all right y'all thank you very\nmuch for showing up today thank you'all\nfor all the support um you know it's\nallowed us to build this kind of Runway\nand then the last thing about\nmemberships is y'all decide what the\nlectures are the first month we're going\nto do male mental health so we did an\ninformal poll with the community and\nthese were the topics that came up\nmanaging expectations as a man\ndeveloping healthy\nmasculinity emotions 101 for men and\ndeep dive into depression for men and\nthen y'all get to choose the rest of the\nstuff and I'm super excited about that\nbecause I'm tired of trying to imagine\nwhat yall need and what yall want why\ndon't youall just tell me and then I\nwill prepare a lecture about I'm super\nexcited because now I get to turn to all\nthe stuff and try to figure out answers\nto questions because secretly sometimes\nI'll I'll I'll only try to answer the\nquestions that I can come up with an\nanswer but I sometimes wonder what would\nhappen if I was forced to answer a\nquestion that I didn't have an answer to\nor didn't want to answer that'd be\ninteresting huh anyway so we'll see how\nit goes we're giving this a shot we\nreally hope yall will join us and I'm\nI'm super excited about being able to go\nin depth with the people who are\ninterested in it and being able to go\nlongitudinally for people who are with\nus for a while"
