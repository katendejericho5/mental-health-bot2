    "transcript": "hey y'all I'm excited to announce that\nwe're launching YouTube memberships and\ny'all may be wondering why on Earth are\nwe doing this well there are a couple of\ncore problems with the content that we\nalready make and I'm hoping that\nmemberships can actually fix this\nproblem so the first problem is that\nwe're growing really fast which is a\ngood thing right but about 2,000 people\njoin our community every single week the\nproblem that we experience with that\nthough is as new people join our\ncommunity they ask the same old\nquestions so I find myself answering the\nsame set of questions about motivation\nor depression or anxiety or meditation\nover and over and over again and that's\nonly fair because these people just\njoined and they sort of have some really\nbasic questions the second problem that\nwe run into is that we're at the mercy\nof the YouTube algorithm so if we want\nto be successful on YouTube we have to\nmake videos that are about 20 minutes\nlong and that anyone who's just joining\nor seeing us for the first time can\nwatch as new people continuously join\nit's hard to get into in-depth topics\nthat I really want to discuss and what\nthat sort of leaves behind is more\nactionable in-depth and academic stuff\nright now the way that we make content\nis we sort of think about okay what's\ngoing to be widely applicable that a lot\nof people can benefit from and what that\nmeans is that for every three videos we\nmake on YouTube we actually scrap s to\neight because they're way too detailed\nway too in-depth and may not apply to a\nparticular group of people so I actually\nreally liked it early on when HG was\nsuper small because we had the same\ngroup of people joining week after week\nafter week so we could explore Advanced\ntopics and go into depth with particular\nthings that may not appeal to a wider\naudience and that's exactly what we want\nto build with memberships so what we're\noffering with memberships is four extra\nlectures that are 1 hour in length which\nI'm going to prepare based on what y'all\nwant y'all get to pick the topic so if\nyou want an esoteric medit uh meditation\nlecture on how to do thric medit\nmeditation or you want a lecture on the\nNeuroscience of OCD or whatever Niche\ntopics that you want are the things that\nI'm going to prepare I'm super excited\nabout this because I actually get to go\ninto depth and use more of the stuff\nthat I've learned instead of staying\nright at the surface the other advantage\nof this format is that y'all tell me\nwhat direction the content goes with\nmemberships My Hope Is that yall can\ntell us hey Dr K we want four lectures\non these particular things or we want\none lecture on this one lecture on this\none lecture on this members will vote\nfor the lectures one month in advance\nabout mid-mon we sort of give yall\ntopics and whatever y'all want me to\nbuild is what I'll build and I'll build\nthose lectures and we'll sort of live\nstream them so there's also going to be\na live stream and Q&A component so this\nis the other thing that is ungainly to\ndo with our general content which is\nbeing able to answer questions so we're\nhoping with the membership model what we\ncan do is give yall space to ask\nquestions and we're also going to have a\nspecific kind of Q&A portion at the end\nof every month and so I'm excited about\nmemberships because it's kind of a\nmerging of two things so the first thing\nis that we sort of make content right\nbut we make content in general for\neverybody and the second piece is at\nhere at H we've got a huge Community\ncomponent but right now the problem is\nthat there isn't a clear way for the\ncommunity to influence content so we do\nlisten to the posts that people make on\nsubreddits and we like pay attention to\nyour comments and stuff like that and it\nkind of goes into the machine but it's\nalways shaped by things like the YouTube\nalgorithm or the fact that we've\nconstantly got a new audience and my\nhope is that with memberships we can\nkind of fix that y'all can determine\nwhat is the topic that you want us to\ntalk about and we can also dive into\nthings that are a little bit different\nas a result so if yall want me to go\ninto more detail in terms of actionable\nstuff applicable stuff or skills\nbuilding stuff hey Dr K we want you to\ndo two lectures on how to break up with\nyour significant other and not feel\nguilty that's absolutely something we\ncan build and so the point of\nmemberships is that y'all decide what we\ndo over the next month we're super\nexcited to be offering this new level of\ncontent via Channel memberships and\ncan't wait to hear your feedback so\nlet's get\nstarted"
