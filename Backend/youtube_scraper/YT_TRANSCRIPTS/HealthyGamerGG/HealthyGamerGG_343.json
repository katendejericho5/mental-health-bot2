    "transcript": "the situations that cause you to burn\nout what are things that you can do to\ndevelop habits in those situations\ninstead of exert willpower and the more\nthat you can do that the less burnt out\nyou will be just to give one example so\nI've worked with a ton of people who\nforget names so that they'll introduce\nthemselves and they'll forget names in\nsocial situations which make\nsocialization hard so just simply\npracticing I'm going to repeat the name\nthree times or I'm going to use the name\nin my response to thems wonders like you\nknow you'll introduce your as Michelle\nI'll say hi I'm and then I'll say it's\nnice to meet you Michelle and so when\nyou practice some of these habits and\nyou engage that habit circuitry it\nremoves the load because habits are\nautomatic and then that sort of\nincreases the battery that you've got\nfor other things and really helps with\nthe burnout"
