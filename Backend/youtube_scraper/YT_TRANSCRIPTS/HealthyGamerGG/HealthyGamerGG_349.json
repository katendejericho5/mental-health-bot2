    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nunlock 100% of your\n[Music]\nmotivation the frustrating thing about\nlife is that we know if we can get this\nperson to actually put forth 100% of our\neffort instead of half-assing it we\nwould do awesome and we know that it's\ntheoretically possible because there are\ntasks in your life where you've been\nable to give it your all and when you\ngive it your all things turn out so well\nthe problem though is that as we look at\nthe tasks in our life like maybe I have\nthis project for work I have to do\nsomething for school or my brother's\nbirthday is coming up whatever the task\nis we just can't put forth 100% effort\nand in those moments if you're like me\nyou start to wonder what would my life\nbe like if I could actually put forth\nall of my effort all of the time I'm\nsuper excited about this topic because\nthis is one of those cases where\neverything that I've invested in seemed\nto to click so my years of studying to\nbecome a monk or during doing\nNeuroscience research at Harvard or even\nyears of clinical practice because the\nproblem with motivation is that it's\nquite multidisiplinary we can sort of\nlook at the Neuroscience of it we can\ndiscover particular things but how do we\ntranslate that down into what you do\ntoday and so that's exactly what we're\ngoing to teach you and we're going to\nweave together some aspects of\nNeuroscience some aspects of clinical\npractice I.E working with people to get\nthem more motivated and lastly we're\ngoing to\nunderstand sort of this yogic or Eastern\nperspective to help you really unlock\nmotivation hey y'all if you're\ninterested in applying some of the\nprinciples that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday so let's start by understanding\nthe experience of one 100% effort so\nwhen you are in a situation where you're\nputting forth 100% effort what are you\nfeeling like what's your internal\nexperience so the first thing is that\nemotionally usually your emotions are\naligned with the task right so this\ndoesn't even necessarily mean good\nemotion so if you're really pissed off\nat someone and you're like I'm going to\nteach this person a lesson your anger is\nin alignment with yourself often times\nthis also means that or in other\nsituations you're excited right or\nyou're curious about something I really\nwant to learn about something so there's\nalignment of emotions with the task\nthat's number one the second thing is\nthat your energy level is pretty good\nright so when you want to do something\nyour energy level is good like you're\nputting forth a 100% effort which means\nyou've got enough energy to sustain the\neffort now let's look at the alternate\nscenario where you don't want to put\nforth 100% effort what are the most\ncommon experiences within your mind and\nyour body so number one thing that a lot\nof people will say to themselves is I\ndon't feel like it I just don't have the\nenergy today so if we sort of look at a\nlack of 100% effort what we're talking\nabout is not feeling like it or not\nhaving the energy to do it today right\nit's oh I'll have the energy tomorrow\nbut just today I don't have the energy\nso I'm not going to I'm not going to put\nforth 100% effort so let's understand\nwhat these subjective experiences in the\nmind actually mean in your brain when we\nsay I don't feel like it which part of\nour being does that relate to and it\nturns out that it's actually emotions\nright so you don't really Noti that you\ndon't have an emotion right it's kind of\nI just don't feel like anything you sort\nof feel emotionally neutral but at the\nsame time you're also using the word I\ndon't feel like it you're not saying I\nthink it's a bad idea or I've made a\nlogical calculation using the tools of\nAI available on the internet and I have\nnaturally concluded that I'm not going\nto do this task that's not that's not\nwhat happens what happens is I don't\nfeel like it and what is feeling feeling\nis an emotion and so now the question\nkind of becomes what determines your\nemotional state in response to a task\nright because if we don't feel like it\nwe have to cultivate the right kind of\nemotion well how do we do that so I'll\ngive you all a scenario okay let's say\nthat I go out with my friends for dinner\nand then they say afterward okay let's\ngo dancing or maybe I'm sitting there in\nthe restaurant and a dance floor opens\nup in the middle of a restaurant now\nwhat do you imagine my emotional\nreaction to my friends getting up and\nstarting to dance are well that depends\non you right so depending on who you are\nyou may say wow this is an amazing\nopportunity I can't believe that they\njust opened up a dance Lords time to go\nBoogie let's go or you could say oh crap\nI'm not very good at dancing I don't\nknow how to dance now all my friends are\non the Dance Floor I'm sitting here\nawkward alone oh my God so even though\nthe scenario is exactly the same our\nemotional response can change depending\non our perception of self okay so I know\nit sounds kind of weird but just hear me\nout so depending on how I think about\nmyself so if I think of myself as I\nenjoy dancing or I am a good dancer then\nmy emotions when it comes to dancing\nwill be positive in nature exciting in\nnature and if I think of myself as not a\ngood dancer I don't know how to dance\nthen my emotions will be negative and I\nwon't feel like doing it literally the\ndifficulty of getting on the Dance Floor\ndepends on the emotional response that I\nhave and the emotional response that I\nhave depends on my sense of identity but\nyou will say but Dr K hold on a second\nit's not just my identity it's not it's\nnot all in my head I am objectively a\nbad d answer like I never learned how to\ndance so it's not that it's my ego it's\nnot my sense of identity I literally do\nnot know how to dance TT I don't know if\nyou've met these people these people\npiss me off but these people who aren't\ngood at stuff and can still do it 100%\nhave you ever met these people these\n[ __ ] you know they're like the people\nwho like the first time you're like\nvisiting some tribe in the Amazon and\neveryone in the Amazon starts dancing or\nI see these people when I'm going and\ndoing like Indian dancing stuff like\ngarbar NRI if you'll ever seen this\nstuff it's a lot of fun so sometimes\nyou'll have like when we go to this\nFestival where there's a bunch of like\nth like literally thousands of Indian\npeople dancing and and stuff like that\nand then I'll sometimes like take my\nfriends who are Caucasian or of other\nethnicities Asian africanamerican\nwhatever and then when I take these\npeople there there's two kinds of people\nnone of them know how to dance they've\nnever been here before it's absolutely\ninsane but some of them are like super\nexcited it's like even though I don't\nknow how to literally do this skill I'm\nexcited to learn and I'm going to put\nforth 100% effort and there are the\npeople who are like I don't know how to\ndo this this makes me feel awkward I am\ngoing to look like an idiot y'all both\ngoing to look like idiots but one of\ny'all is okay with it and this is what I\nend up seeing is that out of the friends\nthat I take the people who are okay\nlooking like idiots are the ones who do\na good job learn how to dance and have\nmore fun so it's not about the\nobjectivity of whether you have the\nskill or not it's about your sense of\nidentity and the emotion that that\ncreates in response to that task and if\nyou're like me because I'm the one that\nwhen I you know go to things and I'm\nlike learning new stuff I have friends\nwith with me who are like Yay let's\nlearn and I'm like I feel like an idiot\nI'm not going to do that and I look at\nthem with envy and jealousy it's like I\nwish I could do that I wish I was\nwilling to make myself look stupid to\nenjoy and engage with life and then I\nwould learn so much more too because the\nother really frustrating thing about\nthese people is that they like learn so\nmany different things because they're\nliving life to the fullest we're going\nto teach you how to do that today the\nsecond thing to understand about when\nyou don't have maximal effort you can't\nput forth Max maximal effort is that you\ndon't have the energy for it so now we\nhave to understand the science of\narousal and what gives your body energy\nokay so we have this axis called the HPA\naxis the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal\naxis and this axis governs a lot of our\nenergy and arousal in life and so if we\nkind of think about it the level of\nenergy that we will kind of have when\ngiven a task fluctuates depending on our\nopinion of the task so I know it sounds\nkind of crazy but hear me out okay so if\nif we look at our energy level what we\ntend to see is that our energy level\ngoes like this okay and what this is is\nessentially our level of stress and what\nwe sort of discover is that in order to\nhave optimal energy for a particular\ntask you need a medium level of stress\nthis is something that we call you\nstress now if a task is not stressful\nenough I.E down here the stress level is\nreally low then our energy level is low\nthis is what we call being bored right\nso doing paperwork is not stressful at\nall it's just annoying and even though\nit's easy to do the level of effort\nrequired is super high because our\nenergy level is naturally low the task\nis easy but our energy is so in the pits\nbecause it's a boring task that it ends\nup being hard to do next thing to\nunderstand is when our stress level is\ntoo high our energy level actually tanks\nand this is what we call being\noverwhelmed so this is when our body our\nbrain is basically saying okay this task\nis too much for us to handle we won't be\nable to succeed in it therefore we don't\nwant to waste energy because it's too\nmuch it's too big it's too much it's not\ngoing to work it's going to be waste of\nenergy and our brain and body if there's\none thing that they're really good at is\nbeing efficient so this is when we feel\noverwhelmed our mind is like okay I have\n15,000 things to do I don't know where\nto start it's too much I and then\ninternally how do you feel when you're\noverwhelmed you feel energetically\ndrained so this is the key thing to\nunderstand is that when we we're talking\nabout putting forth effort we need to\nhave the right level of energy but\ninstead often times we are bored with\nthe tasks or we are overwhelmed by the\ntasks and now the question kind of\nbecomes okay well what do we do about\nthat right because can we control how\nstressed out we are about something it\nturns out yes we actually can and that\ntoo has to do with your sense of\nidentity so let's understand this so\ndepending on how you feel about yourself\nor who you think you are the the level\nof stress a particular task evokes will\nbe different so if you think something\nis beneath you then you will sort of\nstart to think it's kind of boring it's\ntoo easy you'll sort of slip into the\nlow stress category where everything in\nlife is boring and I used to be one of\nthese kids maybe you all know these kids\nthey're all over the internet where\nthey're like yeah I study quantum\nmechanics in my like free time and like\nI'm a philosopher stoic and like oh my\nGod Marxism and I'm so much better than\nyou like oh my God I can't ever apply\nfor a job ever like oh my God it's so\nboring I can't believe this this is\ncrazy and those people don't like\naccomplish much right they're just like\narguing with people on the internet so\nit is our perception of the self and if\nsomething feels too easy to us or feels\nboring then our energy level will\ndecrease on the flip side things that\nare overwhelming are not always\noverwhelming when you first engage with\nsomething it can feel overwhelming\nbecause you don't know how to do it and\nthat's what you'll tell you you're\nyou'll tell yourself right if someone\nelse was in this situation they would be\nable to handle this but I've never done\nthis before this is too much for me I\ndon't know how to handle this kind of\nthing and so it is your perception of\nself which tells you that this is too\nmuch for you to handle because if you\nwere different or you said to yourself\nyou know what even though I'm\ninexperienced with this I have faith in\nwho I am this is a challenge that I can\nrise to let me sort of give it my best\nshot it all has to do with the\nperception of so this is the really\ninsane thing when it comes to unlocking\n100% of your motivation there is an\nenergy component which is governed by\nour arousal system in our HPA axis and\nthere is an emotional component which is\ngoverned by our emotions and furthermore\nboth of these things our emotional\nresponse to a task or how stressful or\nengaging a particular task is how much\nit activates our HPA access\nactually has to do with your perception\nof self now science can get us this far\nbut now the question becomes okay from a\nperception of self standpoint what do we\ndo about it right so if I believe I'm\nall of these things like do I need to go\nthrough 15 weeks of psychotherapy to\nchange my identity you can absolutely do\nthat by all means some people will say\nshould I go do psychedelics and change\nwho I am I wouldn't recommend it but\nsome people have this is where we turn\nto yoga because yoga and meditation in\nthese Eastern Traditions they the ones\nwho sort of figured out from a\nsubjective standpoint how you can change\nyour sense of self and here's the basic\nthing that they figured out essentially\nall of the constructions that we have\nabout our sense of self are\nconstructions they're not really who we\nare they are intellectual conclusions or\neven emotional conclusions but they're\nsomething that we build up about\nourselves and this is precisely why\nidentity can change over time if\nidentity was like fixed and physical and\ntrue then it wouldn't be able to change\nover time really but if you sort of\nthink about your identity your identity\nis quite fluid based on the conclusions\nthat you draw and this is what we\nliterally do in like Psychotherapy for\npeople with like trauma is we will take\nan identity and we will literally\ncognitively reshape it into something\nelse it's absolutely possible and we're\ngoing to teach yall a very simple\npowerful technique that if you do over\ntime will change your sense of identity\nthis technique starts with this step so\nthe first thing to do is take a task\nwhere you can't put forth 100% effort\nonce you have that task you will notice\none of two things either you don't have\nthe energy or you don't feel like it and\nnow what I want you to do is take either\nof those things and try to trace that\nback to a sense of identity you can do\nthis with like a piece of paper you can\npull something out right now whatever\nyou want to do but start to think about\nokay what is it about me that creates\nthis emotional response so if I feel\nlike H I don't have the energy to do it\nor I I don't feel like doing it or I'm\nafraid to do it or I'm anxious to do it\nrecognize that other people would not be\nquite as anxious as you are right or\neven if they were anxious they would be\nable to handle that anxiety in a\ndifferent way so what is it about you\nthat makes you unable to engage in the\ntask and from an energy standpoint the\nsame is true what about this is\noverwhelming for you or or what about\nthis is boring for you and if you tunnel\ndown you'll discover some aspect of your\nidentity it doesn't have to be 100%\ncorrect you're we're not going to worry\nabout arguing with it or trying to like\nconvince it to be different you may sort\nof slip into that don't do any of that\njust notice some aspect of myself and\nthis could be something as simple as you\nknow I'm not good at dancing very simple\nI'm not good so the simpler it is the\neasier it is so make some statement\nabout yourself now comes the fun part so\nonce you have that piece of your\nidentity what I want you to do is sit up\nstraight so your spine needs to be\nabsolutely straight spine is straight\nneck is straight head is straight so if\nyou want to one of the things that you\ncan do is imagine that there is a uh\nlike a string or rope at the top of your\nhead and you're kind of pulling up on\nthat string and imagine what it would do\nto your spine that's how you can sit up\nstraight okay so you want your spine\nneck and head to be 100% straight now\nwhat I'm going to do is take a moment\ntake a deep breath You Can chant M three\ntimes if you want to that really helps a\nlot so you can do five minutes of oh\nchanting for for this practice that's\nideal you yall can check out Dr K's\nguide or some of our other YouTube\nvideos on instructions how to do that\nbut just use some kind of centering\npractice om chanting works really well\nand then what we're going to do is look\nwithin yourself for that attribute of\nyour identity right so notice your\nexperience of this moment what exists\nwithin you what are you you'll notice\nyou have certain physical Sensations you\nmay notice your breath you may notice\nsensory stimuli then you may notice\nthoughts and emotion but thoughts are\njust thoughts they're not real things\nthey're like literally thoughts right so\nI can think of a unicorn doesn't make\nthe Unicorn real a thought is an\nabstraction it's some not reality thing\nit is a construction of the mind and you\nmay have understood this very simply if\nyou thought you left your keys in this\nparticular drawer but then you open it\nup and the keys aren't there oh no\nthoughts are not reality so if you by\nall means you can notice thoughts\nthere's no problem with noticing\nthoughts in fact we want you to but\nnotice what actually exists and as you\njust notice what actually exists look\nfor that aspect of identity within you\nin this moment so if all you have is\nthis 60 seconds could you determine from\nyour experience in this moment that this\nthing is true is this a real thing\nwithin you and you may some of y'all\nwill get tripped up because you'll start\nthinking about it but as we already said\nthinking is not real right sometimes it\nmirrors reality but thinking is not a\nreal thing it's just what we think and\nwe sort of know that people can\nexperience psychosis which literally\nmeans they think particular thoughts\nwhich they believe are real which you're\ndistorted from reality thoughts are not\nreality and so as you look in yourself\nlook for this attribute of your identity\nand what you will discover is it is not\nthere because all aspects of your\nidentity are abstractions are\nconclusions and as you sort of look for\nthis part of yourself I'm not good at\ndancing I'm neither not good at dancing\nor not good at dancing or even if I'm\nnot good at dancing it's simply because\nI haven't learned yet right this vessel\nhas not been trained so be it and then\nas you cannot find this thing within you\ntake a deep breath in deep breath out\nand let that attribute of identity go\njust let it go it's something I believed\nabout myself but it isn't true in this\nmoment so I'm going to go ahead and let\nit go and as you do this practice over\nan extended period of time and you take\nthese attributes of your identity and\nyou start melting them away this is\nwhere someone would say you will unlock\nyour true potential right you will be\nable to accomplish things beyond your\nwildest dreams and that was true for me\nso the big difference between failing\nout of college and training and teaching\nat Harvard Medical School was a change\nin my sense of identity because I used\nto think I was a smart kid and then I\nrealized I am what I am I don't know if\nit's smart I don't know if it's stupid\nI'm just going to focus on learning I'm\ngoing to focus on becoming the best that\nI can the best person on the planet on\nunderstanding the science of\ncomplimentary and alternative medicine\nunderstanding the science of meditation\nand yoga and herbal medicines and then\nsuddenly that attitude is what allowed\nme to rise to the top and so this is\nwhere sometimes someone would say oh\nthis will allow you to accomplish your\nfull potential it's not going to do that\nwe're not here to have you accomplish a\ndamn\nthing we're here not for your\naccomplishments but to let you put forth\n100% effort and in order to do that you\nhave to let go of who you are and then\nthis vessel will have more energy and\nthe right kind of emotions to rise to\nthe\ntask\n[Music]\nhe"
