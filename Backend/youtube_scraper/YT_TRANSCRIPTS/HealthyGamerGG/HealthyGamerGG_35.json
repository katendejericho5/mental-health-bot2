    "transcript": "so when we enter a extremely stressful\nState and what we also know is that\ndissociation and depersonalization are\noften times associated with severe\ntrauma so basically what the brain does\nour brain has this protective mechanism\nwhere if the pain is too much we're\ngoing to unplug from our internal\nexperience of this the brain stops\ntalking to itself cuz normally the brain\nis all connected with itself it's like\nwe're going to talk over here we're\ngoing to talk over there we're going to\ntalk over there we're going to talk over\nthere and what we tend to find in in\ndissoci is that the way that the brain\ntalks to itself changes and it's not\njust that it entirely talks to itself\nless there are some parts will that'll\ntalk to each other more so dissociation\nis basically a compensation for when\nthings are overwhelming we're just going\nto unplug that's what dissociation is"
