    "transcript": "I think the other thing about making\nfriendships last is that there's this\nidea that friendships need to be\nsustained over long periods of time we\nkind of think about friendships as\nplants that you need to water every day\nto kind of maintain them but I think a\nlot of male friendships aren't like\nregular Plants they're a little bit more\nlike succulents or cacti that can go for\nyears without getting a single drop of\nwater I know in my male relationships I\nactually don't have to talk to people\nfor five or six years and we don't seem\nto lose any ground as friends so I think\nif you're trying to cultivate the right\nkind of relationships with men we have\nto change our framing a little bit about\nwhat it means to cultivate a\nrelationship the male friendship is one\nthat requires very little effort to\nmaintain very little maintenance over\ntime and very little effort to get\nstarted and I think that's just what\nmale friendships are like and that's\nokay"
