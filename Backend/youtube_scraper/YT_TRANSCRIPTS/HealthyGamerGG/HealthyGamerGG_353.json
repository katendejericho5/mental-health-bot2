kenoa\njust a reminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if you all have a question or\nconcern please go see a licensed\nprofessional um yeah so happy for those\nof yall that are in the United States or\nin North America and if yall celebrate\nThanksgiving a happy belated\nThanksgiving to you to the rest of y'all\nin the world happy\nFriday\num yeah I'm not sure what the intro\nmusic is I think maybe it was made by\nsomeone in our community I'm not 100%\nsure so um\nyeah\nso and also Black Friday right so I\ndon't know is Black Friday like worth\nstuff anymore is it still good like do\nyou still get good deals or is it\nbasically like a scam now what do you\nall\nthink it was your birthday happy\nbirthday\nD so today y'all we're going to be doing\nan interview with with Slicker um I\ndon't know exactly what we're going to\nbe talking about whatever Slicker wants\nto talk about is what we're talking\nabout um and and I understand there was\nsome you know controversy or something a\nlittle while ago I don't know the\ndetails of that that's usually how we\ntend to approach these things and we'll\njust talk about whatever we're going to\ntalk about\ntoday um yeah and so I encourage yall to\nso I I know it's it's challenging but\nsometimes we talk to people who maybe a\nlittle bit controversial and so I\nenourage yall to have the same open mind\nand compassion that we extend to all of\nour guests that's part of what we do\nhere right as we like try to talk to\neveryone and we try to hear their\nperspective on life and whatever and\nhopefully we can like learn something\nfrom it as the human race um and so\nthat's what we do here so I ask yall to\nyou know just extend the same courtesy\nto Slicker that you extend to everybody\nelse who's here we're not saying don't\nbe judgment free right so so I I know\nthat this also sounds a little bit\nstrange but I think it's fine to form\njudgments but like have some compassion\nso judgment is actually a natural part\nof the mind and like our mind is\ndesigned to form judgments and that's\nokay um and let's just try to understand\neveryone's perspective and who knows\nwhat we're going to talk about I have no\nidea if it's whatever was the\ncontroversy or\nnot but uh yeah so without further Ado\nlet's hop into our interview with\nslicker\nyo dude can you hear\nme oh yeah let me um I just had another\nproblem\nuh Source settings\nyeah\nyep\nuh\nokay let me

do\nthis okay yeah I'm sorry so um yeah I'm\nI'm good I'm good how have you been Dr K\nit's been uh it's been a couple years\nwhile yes it's been a while it's been a\nwhile I've always thought good about you\nman I missed you honest to God like\nseeing you and person one of the nicest\npeople I've ever met one of the genuine\nnicest people i' I was shocked cuz like\num if you don't mind me saying this cuz\nlike I don't know who it is was it was\nit you or someone else cuz I got a DM\nand they uh on the when it all happened\nand uh checking up on me and stuff it\nwas uh I'm sorry I'm a bit nervous I'm a\nbit nervous but yeah you checked up on\nme and I appreciate that a lot you know\num at that time and yeah man yeah I'm so\nsorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry it's I\ndon't know I don't know I don't know I\ndon't it's it's all good man I I have no\nidea what we're talking about today and\nit's kind of like open in that way so\nany anything in particular that you want\nto talk about or anything on your\nmind um yeah just basically a lot of\nthings really like uh just mainly\nbasically about the past and what\nhappened to me and you know uh what's\nthe best way on moving on in in my way\nof what I'm doing is is it correct or is\nit wrong or something like that you know\nso I don't know did you hear about what\nhappened with me sort of so I I I know\nthis is kind of going to sound kind of\nweird but I try my level best to not be\naware of like what is going on with\npeople um because I in my experience you\nknow we've worked with over 500\nstreamers at HG and like one of the key\nthings that we've learned is what you\nsee on the internet does not equal what\nis actually happening I mean it can at\ntimes and and the internet can be a\nuseful way for people to share stories\nand share information but we try our\nlevel best to like not be not judge\nbased on what we read on the internet so\nI actually don't know the details of of\nwhat you went through I just know that\nyou went through something and it it\nseemed bad bro that's all I know it's G\nme bad but um do you to long story or\nshort story uh whichever you prefer I I\ngenerally like long stories but um but\nonly only whatever you feel comfortable\ntalking about no no I mean I don't mind\nI'd like to say it because it would be\nnice cuz I've seen said it so many times\nand especially to the people that still\nwatch me I'll say it and I'll say it\nagain I don't mind uh basically around\ndo you know what Counter Strike is what\nnot\nsay Counter Strike counter stri yeah\nCounter Strike yeah so when that got\nreleased a year later you could buy\nskins you know like in game skins and\nstuff so I bought the uh I used to buy\nskins just to play the game cuz it was\nnice and it was was sexy and then they\nreleased a site called CS go lounge and\nit was like a betting site Esports\nbetting so like pro teams you just put\nyour skin on it so my skin could be like\n100 to 200 I place it on the game and I\ncould win or lose so basically it was B\nand I got addicted to it I'd\ncontinuously buy and buy and buy then\nthey St they shut down the site they\nshut down bet for Counter Strike and I\ndidn't realize you could do this with\nreal money until I watch Like a game of\nfootball and you see it on the banner\nand I tried it with real money I won I\nwon like Â£6,000 that was buzzing I gave\nit to my dad and then um I had spare\nchange gamble my own money would lose it\nall and then I'd like get into a fake\nargument with my parents and be like Dad\njust give me my money back he give it me\ngamble it lose all the 6K then what\nwould I want to do chase the lose chase\nthe the winnings is that correct s chase\nthe winning no try Chase back what I\nlost basically whenn it back right yeah\nsorry yeah and then um I would do that\nand I'd fail obviously get worse and\nworse and then my goal was to get the 6K\nback cuz my dad would be like where's\nthat 6,000 I was only like 18 or 19 so\nthis is a long time ago no sorry this\nwas 21 how old do I\nlook I don't know 29 years old 29 okay\nyeah um and I so this was like I started\nall like 10 years ago 18 19 I started\ngambling and then um I'd continuously\ngamble lose lose lose and it never\nstopped I couldn't stop but I wasn't\nthat bad I wasn't that bad it's because\nI would only use my money right and uh\nprobably i' would like reach out to like\nwhen I used to work at my store or my I\nused to do sale I was a sales advisor\nI'd go up to my managers be like hey\ncould you spare like a few 20 30 quid\nand then take their money gamble it but\nbecause they were in real life they\nexpect their money back in person then I\num after that I became a streamer\nstarted streaming started making a lot\nof money and yeah I kind of really got\ncrazy with that when did you become a\nwhen did you start\nstreaming late\n2018 okay so about five years ago five\nyears ago yeah and what kind of\nstreaming did you do oh sorry um I don't\nknow was uh you know Raj Patel yeah um I\nused to go on his shows a lot and I used\nto this is like this is\nand Austin yeah yeah yeah sorry um yeah\nAustin I used to go in his streams a lot\nand that he's the one that really made\nme and I used to play Counter Strike and\njust do like some interviews or\nsomething uh not interviews like streams\nwith like other the Austin shows or guys\nin the show from the show and then um so\nI can't speak I don't know um it's been\na while since I've spoken to someone\nfrom like the twitch community so I\ndon't know it's I don't know anyway you\nsound really clear to me\nthank you I appreciate that thank you\nand yeah I I didn't really gamble then\nbecause I was making good amount of\nmoney I thought what's the point in\ngambling you know I'm making good money\nI start I really did stop like late 2018\nand then until August\n2019 where I said you know what I got\nthis much in my bank account let me just\nthrow in a little joke lost it went\ncrazy lost all my lost over 10,000 in\nprobably like 2 days and then I was like\nI had the plan so I would be like let me\njust wait for my payment but I was kind\nof not patient at that point so I had a\nfew friends I knew that was like mulv M\nTrain Rex and um John zerker reached out\nto them and said is it fine you know I\nwas coming up with lies just pretending\nlike oh because my you know my bank\naccount got locked or something like\nthat you know I'd come up with li just\nto feed my addiction um and then yeah\nthat's where it really started going\ncrazy i' go when was this\n2019 uh August 2019 and then I would\nstart going crazy I I promis myself not\nto ask viewers and not to ask people I'm\nnot really close with after after those\nguys my friends I then I started saying\nyou know what okay it's fine I should\nask these other streamers and then I\nasked those streamers and then I started\nasking people that I was close to in my\ncommunity and then it went to everyone\nbasically I went to all my Subs I went\nto viewers I went to people that I\ndidn't really speak to um yeah and I\nwent crazy with it and I didn't really\nrealize how much I was really down by\nbecause I my brain ignored that and also\nI used to think what I was doing wasn't\na bad thing I don't know because in my\nhead like have you seen any of the\nvideos I would walk around be like yo\nKing can you keep it personal and stuff\nlike that like I was sending personal\nvideos just to prove to them that I\nwasn't\nhacked and then\num yeah I I'll just send it to them just\nso it would be proof and\nwhat what did you think you said you\ndidn't think it was bad do you remember\nlike what you're what was going on in\nyour\nhead I would\nwin that I was I was I don't know I was\nit it just in my head it was just like\nignore that you're going to win some\nmoney main thing is is like oh I'm\ntaking this money and I'm going to win\npositive 100% positive I'm going to win\nand when I play S I used to do Sports\nbet I didn't do uh slots I wasn't\naddicted to slots I would just do like\nsports B and sit down and do tennis and\num I'll just sit down uh it was my\nentertainment like Dr K I'm telling you\nit was wild like I don't know are you is\nthis uh wait before we do anything like\nam I allowed to swear is this like a\np just nothing that's a TOS violation\nbut I mean oh no no no no no um so it\nwas wild like I would even put up like\nbets and then I would like go on porn\nand like watch both right so it was it\nwas wild like I'd be watching it be like\ndamn she lost and then I'd stop get\nangry and then you know move on to find\nsomeone else and ask a message and yeah\nthey went to legit anyone that was close\nby like my family my mom my dad I would\neven lie to them and do the same story\nwith them\num my close friends it got to the point\neven people come to my house and stuff\nand is it okay if I ask you a couple\nquestions about this licker yeah sure so\nand and when you did lose do you\nremember what would happen in your mind\nthat I would I can't I can't say because\nI feel\nlike it started I started moving on I\ndon't know I don't know I if I'd lost it\nwould be\nlike I don't know I think it would be\njust like move on or something like find\nlike you continue don't stop you know\ntrying you're going to win no matter\nwhat one day you're just going to win\nbut like realistically listening to it\nnow I didn't really do big big big bets\nyou know it would be like Min the max I\nwon from betting was like\n14,000 and I was like and I was in M I\nwas in debt of so I eventually it um one\nof my viewers I asked one guy and then\nhe found out that I asked other people\nand he found it dodgy and you know he\nrecorded it and I was like it it came\nout it went out on live stream fails and\neveryone found out what I did and I\ndidn't know that I was in minus I knew\nit was in the 100 Mark 100,000 Mark but\nI didn't know it was that to that point\nof $300,000 oh my God that's a lot yeah\nwell it would be way more than that\nbecause but that's because some people\nprobably didn't want their money back or\nsomething but um so 300,000 is what you\nowed other people what you had borrowed\nfrom them I yeah yeah and over what\nperiod of\ntime um how long did it take to get to\nthat\nnumber\nfrom August 2019 oh no no uh 2020 early\nJanuary 20 um February 2020 um I'd say\nit was like that or late March I was\nstarting to do that and I would like\nyeah cuz like even I went to um like\nMiami and I stayed with my ex-girlfriend\nin her house and I'd tell her to pay for\nthe food for for me cuz on the side I\nwas like gambling my own earnings and I\nlike don't worry about it you just buy\nthe food I'll pay you it back that's\nwhen it started going crazy and I just\ncontinuously ask other people like on\nthe side and if uh if they could but\nthen\neventually um you know uh excus on\nLudwig they paid off the people that I\nwill no matter what I call them my\nheroes even if it's stingy or cringe I\ndon't care but these guys are my heroes\nthese guys uh which they didn't have not\nI know that they didn't have intentions\nof doing it for me but they did it for\nthe people that I owed um but they paid\noff uh the whole debt wow so I was yeah\num but there were a few people out there\nthat didn't want their money from Ludwig\nwhich I would understand from excusi and\nlwig they wanted me to work to pay them\noff so then uh of course when I got\nexposed me I was I thought like I I\nstill have a chance cuz I didn't I\ndidn't believe that what I was doing was\nwrong I genuinely didn't believe it I\nwas confident I was confident that these\nguys are going to get their money back\nthen then seeing it now obviously not\nbut then I was like oh these guys are\ngoing to get their money back no problem\nlet me just uh you know let me continue\nsending videos and you know oh can I do\nthis can you help me with this but like\nI was I I would realize a lot of times\nthat I'm doing what I'm doing is wrong\ni' A lot of times you I'd think of like\njust sit down gamble you're going to win\nthis when I lose I'd go\ncry my okay I'm not going to say I say I\nsaid that my mom's life a lot of times\nbut I would cry a lot of times like I'd\npunch my pillow punch the wall smack my\npunch my leg and even I'd go live and\ncome up with excuses like to ditch not\nstream I put no effort into the content\nI would create I would like watch my\nlike the tennis while I'm streaming and\npretend I'm paying attention to stream\nand then once they're losing or\nsomething I'll start pinching my leg\npunching my leg you know so no one could\ntell um I was in like Team Liquid you\nknow Team Liquid MH I was in Team Liquid\nI'd even ask them for money like I went\nto anyone I legit went to anyone um\nparents when when you said that you were\nlike upset would punch the pillow or\nwhatever like what were you upset\nabout like okay I was pissed because I\nwas pissed because I lost what were you\npissed\nat that I lost my bet and then oh and\nthen I'd have to go to another one and I\nI'd have to ask someone else but then\nwhen I'd ask someone else those emotions\nare gone and then I'd start thinking of\nyou know at at the same time I'd want to\nsay that weirdly weirdly weirdly it was\nwas a it pleased me like I know that's I\nknow it's weird it pleased me I enjoyed\nit like you enjoyed what gambling okay\nwell yeah I mean I think people do man\nno no like I mean like it it I would sit\ndown and watch it I'm like I don't know\nit wilded me up I'm like damn nice okay\nyou know and then I'd go out of my mind\nwhen they would lose a game I would I\nwould go into the people's Instagram\naccount like the tennis player go to the\nInstagram account and just scroll\nthrough the comments and read the nasty\nthings at them and I'm like good like it\nwas that bad I would go to the comments\nand be like you know that's good she\ndeserves that she rigged the game the\n or the male male or female you\nknow um I'll be like you know you\nfor throwing that game then obviously\neventually I'll be like damn that's sad\nand then at times I'd even I would cry\nand realize that you know I need to fix\nmyself I wish I could prevent this I\nwish I could be debt free I I wish I\ncould stop I'd cry about 30 minutes\nlater I'll go back and do it again so\nwhen you said you wish you could be\ndebt-free you you could fix this what\nwhat were you trying to what did you\nwish you could fix not being debt\nanymore paid everyone off that I owed\nthat was my that was it was really it\nwas my goal but then again I can say\nthat you know bet was something that I\nenjoyed doing as well so yeah I mean so\nI I I think that makes a lot of sense um\nand by the way Slicker thank you so much\nfor sharing this are you okay talking I\nmean I know you've been talking about it\nbut I just want to check in with you\nagain no I mean honest to God doing it\nwith you I feel more comfortable doing\nit with yeah I mean I I I think can I\njust share like a couple of initial like\nthoughts yeah yeah so the first thing is\njust listening to you um you know I've\ndone a fair amount of addiction work uh\nbut usually like substances and\nTechnology like not I haven't worked\nwith a whole lot of people who have\nstruggled with gambling um relatively\nspeaking of course so not like hundreds\nof people let's say but I I think the\nthe main thing that I'm kind of hearing\nfrom you is how not negative all of it\nis so I know it sounds weird like we're\ntalking about that it's like a bad thing\nbut as I listen to your experience I'm\nI'm sort of hearing you say okay I wish\nI could take this away and and what I'm\nsort of hearing you kind of say is like\nyou wish not that you I it's not clear\nto me that you understood you had a\ngambling problem at that point but that\nwhat you really wanted to take away was\nthe debt and when you ask people for\nmoney like you didn't even view it as\nbad because like you were going to win\nright I thought I was going to give it\nto them but absolutely right so like\nthat's kind of the yeah I mean but now\nbut you know that that's what happens in\nour mind our mind gets away from us\nright um anytime we're we're addicted\nand and maybe a little bit later we can\ntalk a little bit more about that\nbecause I I think um there's a lot of\nthings that you're describing which are\nreally consistent with what I've heard\nother people say and what I've read\nabout and stuff like that and maybe\ntowards the end we can kind of map some\nof that stuff out for people who are are\nwatching and and kind of like almost\nlike warning signs where if your mind is\ndoing this then maybe you should be a\nlittle bit more careful or or maybe\nthink about getting some help um but I\nyou know I I I'm still just struck by\nhow not negative your experience of some\nof this stuff is and by not negative I\nmean like okay you're like okay what I\nwant is to not be in debt what I I want\nto borrow this money but like I'm going\nto win and I'm going to pay it back I I\ndon't get the sense that you you thought\nyou were taking advantage of people or\nyou were trying to steal or anything\nlike that it was just it was just a sure\nthing that you were going to\nwin I was at the point where it was like\nit was bad though like no like I'll be\nlike I'm going to pay these people back\nbut it came to the point where I even\ngenuinely like my thought of scam wasn't\nthen I didn't think of it as a scam I\nthought I'm borrowing money I'm not\ndoing anything bad but eventually it\ncame to like even uh people like lari um\nand a few other people I would I found\nways of pretending to send that money\nback so what does that mean so on PayPal\nyou could do something called goods and\nservices I would pay someone with goods\nand services before before you keep\ngoing I I just want to make sure that\nyou're not going to I don't want to so\nwe always want to we don't want people\nto get hurt by coming on and talking to\nus so there's nothing you're going to\ntalk about here that would be confessing\nto a crime or anything like that right\nno no no no I uh I this was uh 200 and\nthis is last year September 17th 2022 it\nall came out at the start I was I was\nscared I was really scared I you know I\nwanted to do uh like I wanted to\ndisappear but um I couldn't it was just\nSuicidal Thoughts but then you know of\ncourse with lwig and xqc helping me out\npaying off everyone um you know it\nhelped me a lot I said you know what\nit's time to be actual man cuz I'm 28\nyears old doing this sort of immature\n and um you know as a grown asadon\nyou're not meant to do that but um you\nknow I I went out found a job worked as\na security uh officer at the\nairport and you know life was good cuz I\nactually started cuz the internet and\nreality is two different things you know\nknow like when you when you talk to the\ninternet people people when you look at\nthese people you only see them as\nbusiness associates you would think your\nthey're your friends but they're\nbusiness associates and then you know\nyou get to together together but then\nyou start separating yourself when you\nsee like a you know the viewer or the\naudience not with you and or something\nlike that that and then when you go\noutside and you you work in a real job\nit's a lot different that I told\neveryone what I did just so they don't\ntrust me in case I do something stupid I\ntold them all I told my manager I told\nthem I told the people I work well the\nfriends I had at work and they were like\nwe don't judge you you know you look you\nlooking at you you're coming here you're\ndoing work and you know it looks like\nyou want to improve yourself and I was\nlike damn that makes me feel good and\nthen uh it improved improved my\nconfidence working there but it also\nmade me I don't know this Al this is\nalso something I want to know from you\neventually like I could never watch any\nof the reactions I couldn't I couldn't\nwatch any of the reactions like you know\nasmin Gold's reaction was like saying I\nhope the I don't care if these guys kill\nthemselves and then you you got other\npeople like all these guys that doing\nthe the reviews and stuff like that it\nwas too hard I'd scroll down read the\nhate it was too hard and you're talking\nabout reactions about you\nreactions right and seeing seeing what I\ndid as well is something I couldn't even\ndo I couldn't even watch it was too hard\nand when I came out forward and cried\nand explained it to the internet um and\nthen eventually now my current stage is\nthat I see my past self as a joke I\ndon't know from your side if that's a\ncorrect way of moving on cuz I did go to\ntherapy I went to therapy at the start\nbut my job kind of like stopped me\nbecause like I was doing 12h hour shifts\nand I couldn't meet up with my therapist\nsince she does only weekends and at\ncertain times and then I stopped and\nthen I came back into I couldn't come\nback into streaming some of the victims\nthat I uh scammed they were like stop\nbeing a you know they would\nmessage me and stuff and they would like\nstop being a go live and stuff on\nI know it might not be uh not believable\nfrom them to say that to me but it is\ntrue I don't want to name them so so\nwhen when they said stop being a\ngo live were were they ask they were\nstill supporting you as a streamer they\nwere say I was I'm confused by that my\nthey were my friends they were there for\nme but they were also like scam they\nhated me they didn't want to talk to me\nbut eventually they started messaging me\nand I I was messaging them I play games\nwith them and stuff like that and then\nthey were like saying should press the\nlive button stop being a go live\nand stuff like that I genuinely didn't\nwant to do that I didn't want to do it\nat the start and then eventually went\nlive and I I started getting confident\nagain and started streaming during the\ntimes I was\nworking then I got sacked from work\nthat's something I that's something I\ndon't want to say why I got sucked for\num and then uh it wasn't good\num uh and then well okay now I'm not\nmaking myself any better cuz I said it's\nnot good let me give you a little\ninsight no you don't have to sh we're\ntotally fine not knowing like let's just\nkeep it wasn't illegal what I did it\nwasn't B it was not the same thing I was\ndoing it was just human faults human\nfaults we all have them so you were\nsaying people were messaging you yeah\nand then uh sorry yeah and then I\nstarted streaming and yeah I just went\npeople would just use it against me be\nlike look at this look at it La this is\nyou begging and um this and that and\nthen I just got used to it to the point\nwhere I just laugh at my past not to the\npoint where I scam but to the P of me as\na gambler I laugh at myself as so when\nit comes to a victim so um as a as a\ngambler I would laugh and be like this\nis not this is someone different I'd\nlook at this is not the same me I see\nmyself as and in order for me to posit\nlike for me to move on I'd see the parts\nwhere i' be like you know yoking can you\nkeep a person I'd laugh at myself and be\nlike this is this guy's a\nclown but at particular points where\nI'll be like if it's any victim I\nwouldn't I would not laugh at that cuz\nbut like for my past of my uh my\naddictions I would laugh at that I don't\nknow what if that's a positive way of\nmoving on cuz for me people would try\nand use that against me and I'm like\nokay all right if you want to use that\nthat's not going to affect me you know I\nknow I can better myself and I know I\ncan be a better human yeah so can you\ntell me you said like like something\nabout being an actual man what do you\nmean by\nthat oh\nokay\nwell um yeah I don't know about being an\nactual man still but I mean you know\nbeing\nresponsible what does that mean um so I\nwas uh you know like doing my own stuff\nyou know like uh laundry I I was basic\nI'm still I live at my parents house at\n29 so I mean uh you know I I would 50%\nof other people who are 29 by the way I\ndon't I don't care though I don't care\nif I live with my parents but\num like she would make me the food she\nwould uh clean my clothes she would uh\ndo my bed and all that stuff you know\nand then I I started realizing you know\nit's about time to for me to start doing\nthat myself and like know do my bed and\nuh uh you know good for you man well not\nnot the food but you know just put the\nfood in the plate for myself and stuff\nlike that you got start somewhere yeah\nand you know some of it like that and\nactually be responsible do something and\nwork and you know\nuh what is a man I don't know Define me\nwhat a man is uh Dr\nK you know like um being uh uh mature I\ncan't I can't that's something I can't\nbe can't be that I why can't you be\nmature\nboring okay you know I can't I can't I\ncould not hang around with someone\nthat's really mature I mean and I'm not\nsaying you you are definitely mature but\nI mean I'm saying like like someone that\ndon't crack up with you know small jokes\nor something like that so what does mean\nto\nyou um my father wait no that means\nactually I can't hang out with my father\nno no I take that back um no uh what\nabout your father makes him\nmature he's a man he's a man he uh he he\ndoes things like the light bulb switches\noff he's like okay he goes up he does it\nhimself you know and I'm there watching\nhim he's he's running the bills he you\nknow um plans uh you know sort\neverything out of the house you know\nwhich something I have no clue of and\nyeah that's someone a\nman a\nman someone who's responsible someone\nwho takes care of someone's responsible\nyeah there we go yeah depend someone\nwho's right right right someone like\nthat I'm not at that current stage still\nI would say that you know I'm very\nimmature sure and someone who doesn't\nneed to be bailed\nout correct exactly someone who works to\npay these people off which I I did I did\nyou know I I know not to be I'm not\ngoing to say oh I'm taking all credit on\nstuff I did work cuz there were a few\npeople that wanted their money back um\nsomeone took me to court um and I worked\noff paid that person back um a few of my\npeople from outside of my friendships I\nI owed um I worked paid them back um\nthere are a few people that are still I\nstill ow\num and uh I will work to pay them back\nas well and yeah how does feel to pay\npeople\nback it feels good I mean I'm not I\ncan't say I'm the the people that I ow\nright now it does feel good you know but\nI I don't want to I'm not going to take\nuh you know I'm not going to be like I\npaid them back you know I'm always going\nto be like these Guy excus and lwi\nbecause are the reasons for me to afford\nto pay some of these people I owe back\nsure you know but it does it it does it\ndoes feel it feels good like I can't lie\nthe life I had when I was streaming it\nwas beautiful I could go on holidays I\ngot free stuff and stuff but the life I\nhave now is a lot better than I did it\nwhen I was streaming back in the days\nhow\nso I it was depressing like I was I was\nfaking my ACT I was using people I\nwasn't investing my money I I used to go\nlive then put effort into my\nstreams and yeah I was just just\ngenuinely just a\nscumbug you used to go live and put\neffort or not put effort no no effort\nlike my viewers would love they wanted\nme to collaborate with other streamers\nthey wanted me to um do IRL streams and\nstuff but I never did any of those just\nso I could just like sit down and watch\nlike betting on my right screen or\nsomething okay so so you you feel in\nsome ways that your life now is better\nwhat's different\nnow that I'm in a safer place that\neveryone that\num everyone got their money\nback\num I'm not as I'm not as depressed I'm\nnot I'm grateful I'm grateful you know\nthat's a huge thing as well cuz like I\nwasn't grateful when I was streaming I'm\ndefinitely grateful um to be in a\nposition like this because you already\nknow like for what I did I could have\nbeen in a lot worse place than if not\nfor those uh for excusing l i could have\nbeen in jail I could have been uh I\ndon't know could have been uh 6 feet\nunder the ground Brave um I I don't know\nI I couldn't tell but um yeah definitely\nbeing grateful as well what are you\ngrateful\nfor\num I'm grateful for a lot of things so\nlike for being debt\nfree for having a few friends there for\nme still\nfamily um\ngiven a\nchance\n[Music]\num um I feel like I'm missing something\nand I can't think of it you know when\nyou I I I I I mean I think that's but I\nI think it's also so I everything you\nsaid makes a lot of sense to me and I\nthink sometimes it's interesting you say\nyou you're missing something I think in\na sense you probably are but I think\nthat sometimes we don't have the words\nto express what we're grateful for\nbecause you can feel gratitude without\nreally even knowing exactly what you're\ngrateful for um and one of the things\nthat I'm kind of getting from you is\nsort of like there was this alternate\npath to your life and some of the\ngratitude I'm feeling off of you is that\nyou're not on that path anymore and that\npath comes with all kinds of problems\nand honestly some nice things too\nbecause you're going on holiday and\nyou're getting free stuff and you know\nyou're streaming with big people and\nyou're a big person and so there's a lot\nof stuff that's alluring about that life\nbut I think what a lot of people don't\nunderstand looking from the outside is\nthat there's a lot of toxicity in that\nlife too Pro there's a lot of Fame and\nfun and and ego is that's annoy it's\nannoying because like I mean to be\nhonest look Dr K where I work there were\nego people over there as well like\nmanagers would like look at look down at\nyou and you know it's the same it's\nhonest to God it is the same though but\num yeah I mean it was also like you know\nwhen I went there people would be like\nwhispering to other people that guy did\nthis this guy did this this guy did this\nand like even at time even at a\nparticular point where I was like un\nbreak I come back and you'd always have\nto go to your manager because the\nmanager point you to go to like do your\nbags do x-ray or do something like that\nI went to my manager these two managers\nsitting down watching a video of me\ngetting exposed laughing on my life I\nwas in shock so I the girl that told him\nabout that I I I you know raged at her I\nwas like I don't get this how was this\nmeant to be funny you know but then the\ngirl didn't really know what I did they\njust opened the video they didn't have a\nclue what happened and she didn't know\nwho I was because people telling her and\nit felt like it was a it was a bit\nuncomfortable I didn't like it I didn't\nlike working with the people around me\nbecause they don't say it to you cuz I\nwould be okay if they came up to you and\nbe like okay this guy did this I'll be\nlike okay yes and it is me you know I'm\nnot going to say it's not I'm not going\nto be proud of what I did but um you\nknow uh they wouldn't do that they would\njust go behind and I'll be like who said\nthat who said that who is saying that\nyou know so I'd avoid speaking to them\nand and so Slicker you're saying you had\nsome questions about moving on so what\ncan you tell me a little bit about\nthat um I mean\ntoday I\nit's cuz I right now I've had like\nthrough after the whole thing I had my\nfamily supporting me and my\nex-girlfriend um throughout the whole\nthing they uh they supported me through\nall of it my sister prevented me from\nusing my card like she would you know\ntake ownership so whatever I'd pay it\nwould be through the uh the card she's\nholding so it was I was I was\nunder\num yeah I don't know the word for it in\nEnglish but basically they would they\nwould look at what I'm spending on stuff\nand they would spend it for me they saw\nall the bills they sort of the the debts\nand send it to the people I owe and\nstuff and wait what was the question\nwhat is what you said you're you're\ncurious about or you're trying to move\non and I was just curious yeah yeah yeah\nand what makes that hard so I feel like\nI don't know if I'm 100%\npositive if I'm confident if I've moved\non you know cuz I did that the same way\nback in the days and 2017 I mean the\nscam thing won't ever happen but\ngambling I don't know if that that will\never happen and to be honest when I say\nthat scam thing won't ever happen who\nknows if I ever go back to gambling I\ncould be still that same degenerate but\num I I for example like in 2016 I\nstopped gambling and I froze it I tried\nhelp and then I a month after I was like\nyou know what I'm okay took my card back\ndidn't gamble month later I saw a little\nbet said let me do a little cheeky\ntenner lost it and then lost and lost\nand lost I went back into it and never\nstopped um so you know like I'm\nwondering what\nyou know am I forever going to stay as\nan addict cuz I'm not confident today I\nhad a dream and then this is not a lie I\nswear to God I had a dream that I had $1\nin my account opened it I said you know\nwhat I don't do slots let me put it in a\nslot machine and this is a dream I won\n37k from a slot just from one spin from\n$1 and I was I was happy it felt so real\nI swear to God it felt so real because\nall the things I could just think of\nwhat I'm going to do with it and then I\nsaid you know what since it was\n37,8 167 I said let me SL let me slot\nwith the $7 I won\n$67,000 up 100 gave it to my dad woke up\nand I felt\nsad so I don't know is it inside of me\nstill do you think I can ever come to\nthe point where I can actually\nlike be confident with myself and not do\nit anymore you know like I I I don't\nknow I really don't know I'm not I don't\ntrust my myself either I don't trust\nmyself either Slicker so here's the\nthing this is such a beautiful question\nit's a question that people have been\nasking for hundreds if not thousands of\nyears and we're going to talk about\nanswers to the question but I don't I\ndon't know that there is one I think\nit's well we'll talk about it's a be I\nI'm excited because I I think when I was\ntraining to become a psychiatrist these\nare the kinds of questions that that you\nknow we would talk about not only with\nour patients but with my teachers so\nwhat does it mean mean when someone is\nan addict does it mean that they're this\nway forever and and what I'd love to do\nis just share with you kind of my\nunderstanding I don't know specifically\nabout you um but you know just what I\nunderstand about that question and how I\napproach it how I think about it what we\nknow about Neuroscience what we know\nabout\npsychology um and I think the dream\nstuff in particular is is is fascinating\nso I'm just going to make a note of that\nbut I've never had this before never had\nthis is today it was so Random\ntoday was random I don't know it's not\nrandom H it's not of course it's not\nrandom you said you've never had this\ndream before right from a over a year of\nBeing Sober yeah and\nit of course it's not\nrandom right so what else is happening\ntoday excuse me what else is happening\ntoday you said this is the first time\nyou've had this dream right okay you had\nit last night right so what was on your\nmind when you went to bed last night\nwhat was on your mind the day yesterday\nwhat was on your mind when you woke up\nthis\nmorning Dream by also abely yeah right\nso we're having this\nconversation right so you're mentally\npreparing okay that we're g to talk\nabout\nthis right right so I I don't think it's\na coincidence that you know it sounded\nlike you started betting at the age of\n18 or 19 and for 10 years you've never\nhad this\ndream today's what some magical\ncoincidence wow out of\n3,650 days this is the day you have the\ndream yep yep yep so there's good news\nSlicker which is that your mind operates\nbased on science based on some logic and\nit's my belief that the better you\nunderstand the way that your mind works\nand the rules of the mind you will find\nan answer to this question moving on and\nwhat you can do and what you cannot do\nright before we dive into that can you\njust tell me a little bit about what\ngrowing up was like for\nyou\num I had strict parents like and it was\nin a good way I personally I believe it\nwas not bad what they did but like you\nknow we they were strict we didn't I\ncouldn't use the internet certain times\num I was heavily well so I would go to\nschool I have ADHD okay and it was so\nhard to focus in school I failed all\nsubjects well except for maths um I got\na C that's the highest I I when I first\nwent to school um like in the end of\nprimary school I'd mess about and all\nthat stuff and they call in my dad many\ntimes i' get in trouble get grounded and\nthen eventually I went to high school\nand I again the same thing I would just\ndo stupid things um and yeah I was in uh\nwhat's it called the highest uh learning\nsupport I was in learning support the\nhighest one okay you know what learning\nsupport is it sounds like you needed\nsome kind of support to help you\none right so it basically does levels so\nif you're in the highest level you get\nthe best uh the hardest questions in\nmaths and English I was in the worst one\nI'm confused does that mean that you\nneeded more help or you were getting\nsuper challenging questions no I was uh\nneeded more I needed help okay yeah but\num you said you you did stupid stuff in\nhigh school like\nwhat um so there was these guys that\nthat used to kind of bully me uh yeah\nkind of but I would try and be on their\nside so there was this time there was\nunder the stairs and there was a fire\nalarm they were like yo yo go show us\nhow sick you are I was like what and he\nwas like yeah yeah punch that fire alarm\nI was like yeah yeah come then you know\nI was smiling all that so and I punched\nthe fire alarm and it went off and then\nthe head teachers came I ran upstairs\nand then I tried to do a reverse\npsychology and went to the head office\nand snitched on myself and I said I\ncried but it was a fake cry uh no no I\nwas actually crying I think was I I\ndon't know so I uh um no no I wasn't\ncrying then I wasn't but later on I was\ncrying uh I was uh I went up to them I\nsaid some guys actually you know forc me\nto do this and I didn't want to do it\nand they were like hm are you sure then\nthey show me the camera and they saw me\nsmiling in it um and then yeah so my\nparents came and I got suspended for\nlike two\nweeks from uh school and then uh I weird\nstuff I don't know even when I went to\nwork\nexperience uh uh year 10 uh I my uncle\nsaid you can work at hours and\nI'd i' go up to the frying pan and I'd\nspit now hold on don't worry I anyone no\none ate this but I'd spit in the the the\nwhat's the thing that you put the the\nburgers on the\ngrill I was testing you congratulations\nyou passed yeah the grill and it would\nsizzle the the the spit would Sizzle and\nI was like yo that's cool so I brought\nhim so I brought him my um my the the my\nuncle I said look at this spot and he\nlooked at me and smacked me I didn't\nrealize I don't know why but I didn't\nrealize it and then he sprayed did clean\nit I was like do you not know and I was\nlike\noh of course you put the burgers there\nso yeah a lot of times I've done a lot\nof stupid things I don't know I don't\nknow why\nwe question okay yeah that's very\nhelpful but that's um oh no sorry yeah\nand then you know like internet was\nstrict like we couldn't I couldn't go on\nthe internet when I'm home my dad would\nbe like read a book for one hour and\nthen um did you like oh hell no\nhell no no offense you know I'm kind of\ngetting to it getting into reading right\nnow because I'm inspired by Tupac you\nknow Tupac drk he actually made me feel\nlike a man I'm serious he's the one that\nmade me feel like because you\nknow you know he what he did was he was\na true warrior you know his background\nand what he did to his uh own kind and\nstuff and his messages in his songs and\nstuff so I felt like you know it made me\nfeel better it made me feel like I wish\nI could be like him\nwhat about his songs made you feel\nbetter it was like you know how you read\nbooks and you picture it me listening to\nhis lyrics was picturing it as well it\nwas like reading a book but I could\nvisualize it and it was so it was so\ngood and it was like I'm educating\nmyself with what he's saying and what it\nwas like in the back in the days and who\nto trust who not to trust I mean who can\nI say that to uh trust or not but I mean\nuh from his perspective and stuff it was\nit was good so then you know it made me\nfeel\nlike in some aspects it made me feel\nlike a man you know and it also made me\nfeel like you know what your weaknesses\nonly makes you stronger you know and he\nwas the same you know he also wanted to\nkill himself after he got shot which I'm\nnot comparing myself to him but he um he\nhe wanted to kill himself but all he did\nwas become stronger and stronger and he\nyou know started going all\nout yeah but um yeah sorry let's get\nback to the thing um books are just so\nthey are kind of boring I mean like I\nsaid I am kind of like reading some\nbooks inspired from what he would read\nlike The\nPrince uh uh and uh what was it other\none no just the prince I'm starting to\nread the prince um but I didn't really\nlike reading books cuz my ADHD was so\nhard it's so hard I'd read one hour of\num a book and in my head I'm thinking of\nCounter Strike like it was was creative\nI have I have a creative brain I could\nlike control my brain as if I'm playing\nCounter Strike so uh um well it wasn't\nCounter Strike it was a game called Ava\nbut\num yeah I was like oh sorry I'm talking\ntoo much you're not talking to you're\nyou're doing great dude I I you know\nwhen when and so let me let me ask you\ndo you have so I I understand your your\nmain question is okay like what does\nthis mean for my future how do I move on\nam I always going to be like this you're\nask you have these kinds of questions\nright\nand another one like if I like I'm not\nI'm not ready to get a woman but like I\ndon't think a woman would be okay\nhearing about my past you know like what\na great question yeah\nyeah give me give me all Slicker this is\nawesome dude like I I I oh you being\nserious I thought Oh I thought You' be\nsarcastic no oh I'm I'm sorry I'm sorry\ns but um yeah yeah like um stuff like\nthat like I'm not confident I'm not\nconfident speaking with a with a woman\nit's like there was this woman I was\nactually interested and she was like um\nbeautiful and then she was like you do\nknow I know you about your past I was\nlike yep I don't know this is awkward I\ncan't just move on okay you know so I\ndon't know other other thoughts concerns\nquestions other thoughts concern qu\nquestions other thoughts or concerns or\nquestions that you other other\num oh\num no okay can I think for a second\nSlicker absolutely I'm actually I'm\ngoing to need like a minute or two yep\nyep yep\nokay\nlet me ask you one other question do you\nhave a sense of so you said there there\nhave been periods of your life where\nlike this hasn't been a problem for you\nright like the gambling\nright um what do you mean by that when\nlike like there are times where you\nweren't\ngambling during the times when I started\ngambling yeah so like you you've been\ngambling off and on for like 10 years or\nmore than 10 years right yes yes yes yes\nyes yes yes but there are periods of\ntime when you're not gambling right\nright right what's your understanding of\nwhat's different about those\ntimes that English was so good I'm so\nsorry could you elaborate a bit like\nwhat what was that just that last\nsentence so what was going on when you\nweren't gambling what was different\nabout your life so that you weren't\ngambling I can't remember the time when\nI was at working at 3 I can't remember\nthat but when I was when I started\nstreaming I said there's no point for\ngambling you know like I'm making enough\nmoney there's just no point there's no\nneed I'm making enough money do you\nremember how you felt about streaming\nwas it mostly about the money or was it\nlike huh um no like as in I'm making\nmore money that there's no need to\ngamble you know like compared to when I\nwas working at 3 i' still make uh good\nmoney like 1,500 a month but I'd want\nmore like I'd want to hit 10K but when I\nwas streaming I was making a lot of\nmoney so so but then let me I'm a bit\nconfused right so once you start\nstreaming and you start making money why\nwould you start again why would you\nstart gambling at all\num cuz no it was just a little cheeky\nlittle cheeky for fun you know when\npeople gamble for a little fun you know\nso I just did it for a little fun I just\ncheck cheeky tener as he\nsaid right yeah I can't to be H it was\nprobably not even a cheeky T was\nprobably cheeky 500 or something like\nthat okay you know so um I was like yeah\njust thre it then I was like yeah just\nfor fun and that did not turn out to be\nfun cuz that was just when it all\nhappened again okay but it was good\nbecause like even when I was like I was\nable to like afford to go you know pay\nfor my own flights and stuff I'm sorry\nactually are you still collecting\nthoughts no no no you're good yeah it\nfelt good cuz like I was it was my own\nmoney I could spend it on this and I was\nsmart for like for once I was actually\nSP smart and saving my money which I\nnever did never did save I saved up like\n15K 15 to 20K in my bank that's the\nhighest I've ever seen in my streaming\ncareer from my own money and then um\nyeah sorry and when this stuff was going\non did your parents did your parents or\nfamily think yeah no they had no idea\nthey had no idea okay oh no no they did\nat one point when I won the 6,000 but\nthat was when I was young I said dad I\nwon this I won this from it here you go\nand he was angry he was like you don't\never do that again cuz he's his morals\nis he's he like hugely against um\ngambling anything that's Haram\nbasically well for me what's your\nethnicity Slicker Iraqi okay uh I don't\nknow what that is in ethnicity though\nwhite it's fine so okay so it's Haram\nright along with alcohol and pork right\nI mean I don't have a I have a mixed\nfamily so like one's my dad's not that\nreligious though so are you religious\nI believe in it I believe in the\nreligion but I just I'm not practiceing\nMuslim what do you mean by believe in\nthe\nreligion I believe there's Allah I\nbelieve uh their sins I believe praying\nI believe he's testing us I believe um\nyou\nknow that is the right and correct path\nbut I'm not doing it that makes like\nwhat's your understanding of why you're\nnot doing it\nlaziness and if you were less lazy what\nwould doing it look\nlike obviously\n[Music]\nbe with\nGod okay so H how how does one be with\nGod by uh following what it says in the\nQuran okay okay so observe what the\nQuran says right right you know like\npraying um being a you know a good\nperson uh not doing any Sins not\ndrinking not um doing any of those uh\nHaram stuff not masturbating which is\nhard for me as well Dr K it's hard it's\nhard for a lot of\npeople no I mean genuinely it's hard for\nlike I'm I think I don't know if it's an\naddiction but I I I remember a lot of\nnames you know go into detail like I'd\nknow a lot of pawn star names I see and\nyeah and I'd search them up by that and\nI'd do when I was young I would do five\ntimes a day and I'm 29 I'm doing twice\nwell not twice I do it like actually I'm\ndying out to be honest I'm doing it like\nthree four times a\nweek you used to masturbate five times a\nday oh yes hell yeah and it was weird\nlike I don't know if you want me to go\ninto detail with that Dr K but it was\nwild stuff like I would yeah I think it\nwould be better if we don't yeah let's\nlet's table that for now but I I I do\nthink that's actually like a\nsignificant detail Oh I thought you said\nsignificant\nImprovement well I mean that maybe too\nbut\num if you don't mind me asking Dr K how\nold are you\n41\nwhat that's CRA no you you do look like\nyou're in your early 30s that's crazy\ngood genetics I'm lucky yeah that is\ncrazy I wish I look like you when I'm 40\nthen cuz that's only 10 years soon\nthat's crazy and when did you get\nmarried if you don't remember me asking\nI got married at uh I want to say 28\nmaybe I'm 29 do you understand like\nit you know 29 and you was 28 you\nmarried definitely were mature then and\nlike I'm 29 I'm still bitchless no I'm\nso sorry like uh I apologize for saying\nthat word\nwomanless and what's your understanding\nof why that\nis\num not confident anymore really I'm just\nnot confident you know you know oh wait\nwait what was the correct answer there's\nnot there's a correct answer and I\nmissed out you tell no no I mean I think\nthat's a big part of it but I I think\nwhen your\ndefault when the words that naturally\ncome out of your mouth is\nbitchless right so that that means that\nthere's a there's a certain conditioning\nwhich I think could be getting in the\nway too trust I was really I was\nreally I was so respect I had an ex we\nwere dating for two years and we broke\nup because like you know she would tell\nme to stop gambling she knew I was\ngambling but she didn't know it was that\ncrazy and she was like stop or we stop\nyou know I was respectful I'm a\nrespectful man I I I believe you so but\nI think confidence is is a good place to\nstart but we can talk a little bit about\nyou know comparison and stuff like that\ntoo but let me just are you cool if I\nuse an iPad and draw on it yeah do\nwhatever you want you know yeah give me\na\nsecond\nwhy well we're gonna like we're gonna go\nto class\nslier okay all\nright I'm going to try my hardest to\nfocus I'm so sorry like I think it I\nthink it'll my my thought is that it'll\nmake it easy for you to focus and not\nharder okay but if that changes you let\nme know okay um sorry wait I have\nanother question as well for you please\nnow with addiction there was a okay I'll\ncome that come to that later with\naddiction right Sports bettting and Cass\nand Slots different addictions correct\nor not yes and no so that's why we're\ngoing to we're going to explain all this\nstuff okay so let's understand these are\nall honestly Slicker I'm not I don't I\ndon't think I've you know if I tell you\nthat I think something is a good\nquestion I'm not I'm not like trolling\nyou like I genuinely think it is a good\nquestion like I I'm not okay I I think\nyour questions are all awesome I think\nthere's by the way have you ever been\ntaught how to\npray yeah of course yeah okay yeah\nokay been my mom taught me how to prve\nwhen I was young and she would always\ntell me like just come back you know\nstop praying and you know believe and\nstuff I know I'll uh I know eventually\nI'll uh you know commit to praying and\nyou know soon but\nyeah so I'm gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna\ndo this hope uh\noh um give me a second okay yeah I uh\nmy hold\non oh I guess I can't do that here\ngive me one\nsecond take your time\nsir okay let's move this over\nhere I just want to say you know thank\nyou for doing this with me uh Dr K yeah\nof course thank you for coming on\nSlicker all right can can you see this I\nknow you can't right now Slicker but\nwe're going to fix that in a second so\nI'm going to screen share with you and I\njust want to check in with chat that\nthey can see what I'm I've got here can\nyou all see\nokay\nchat this is the only time I'm I I don't\nusually pay attention to chat no offense\nchat okay great all right so Slicker\nyou're asking can we move on all right\nso a couple of things\noh\nBluetooth connect\nconnect there we go okay so you're\nasking can we move on um first thing\nthat I'd say Slicker is that I I do\nthink you know this is absolutely a\nquestion you said you were seeing a\ntherapist for a little while and this is\nsomething that I strongly encourage you\nand everyone else we're going to learn\nsome basic principles today um and sort\nof like almost what I would teach if I\nwas teaching medical students or\nPsychiatry residents and they asked me\nhey can a\npatient recover from an addiction this\nis sort of the answer I would give does\nthat make sense\nSlicker patient recover from an\naddiction yes okay is that the question\nthat you were asking when you said can I\nmove on yes yeah okay so let's\nunderstand like why an addiction\nhappens like whether PE and then we'll\nwill'll be able to figure out whether\nyou can kind of quote unquote move on or\nnot so the first thing to understand is\nthat if we sort of like look at your\nhistory right you're someone who is\nimpulsive and how can I say\nthis\nvulnerable oh to\nhaving\nfun okay yes so like do you you kind of\nget what I mean it's like okay you're\ndown in the\nstairwell and someone is like hey\nSlicker you hit this fire alarm and\nyou're like yeah let's\ngo you're sitting there at your uncle's\nlike restaurant you know getting ready\nto make burgers or whatever you're like\nwow let me spit on this like let's see\nwhat happens it's like that's pretty\ncool it's it's\nsizzling so do do you see how like\nthings that other people would not\nconsider fun or even things that other\npeople would consider like foolish or\nstupid you actually kind of like enjoy\ndoing and and it's almost I I don't mean\nthis in a bad way it's it's almost like\nchildlike with the level of joy that you\nget if you really think about it like\nyou know watching if if you take a\nfour-year-old kid and they spit on\nsomething hot and the child enjoys\nwatching water Sizzle I don't think that\nthat's a bad thing you get what I'm\nsaying like there's just a simple joy of\nlike okay this is cool this is physics\nit's like water is evaporating like\nsomething gets lit on fire like oh let's\nhave a good time let's like so this is\nwhat I kind of mean there's like a\nvulnerability to having fun right\nokay um that's crazy I'm compared to a\nfour-year-old D no no no I I I I don't I\ndidn't mean it is an insult I don't\nworry about it I I believe I'm like a I\nact like a 10-year-old so to me it's so\nso there's a part of that that's true I\nactually think that there's a lot of\nalmost something to be aspiring to I'm\nnot trying to troll you here but I I\nthink actually a big problem in the\nworld is that we cannot enjoy things the\nway that you could enjoy them like I\nactually think watching something\nsomething Sizzle like watching water\nSizzle is not like a bad thing like it's\npretty cool and the world would be a\nvery different place if we could just\nappreciate like normal ordinary things\nlike watching water Sizzle and like what\nhappens if I you know light something on\nI mean I don't think we should go around\nlighting things on fire but like fire is\ncool right like it's cool to watch\nthings burn like we all love Fireworks\npoint is that there's I think that if we\nlook at the way that your brain kind of\nworks and this also consistent with\nhaving ADHD you don't really think\nthrough the consequences before you act\ntrue I don't think before doing stuff\ntrue right and so if you kind of think\nabout it what is it that if you don't\nthink about what's going to happen when\nyou do stuff what is it that drives you\nto do\nsomething um I don't know I don't know\njust uh just\nme instantly I no instinct I just\ninstantly do it okay I don't know\nanything I see you know like I don't\nknow that's crazy okay so so what you\ncall Instinct I'm going to call\nimpulsivity okay it's kind of the same\nthing but I think the other thing is\nthat what drives you is like this is\ngoing to be good do you kind of get that\nlike anytime you do something pardon me\nfor saying so but anytime you do\nsomething stupid you think that\nsomething good is going to come out of\nit like I'm going to spit on this thing\nlet's see what happens I'm going to hit\nthis firearm let's see what happens like\nthis is going to be lit it's going to be\ngreat right let me put a cheeky tenor on\nthis like let's just win some like let's\ngo baby like come on let's go you know\nthat kind of feeling that I'm talking\nabout of like let's go like let's have a\ngood time right\nokay\num now as a grown adult though at 29 to\ndo stuff like that is yeah that's bad it\ncan be but I also think that there are\nmany 40-year-olds who I think would be\nhappier in life if they did if they\nlived a little bit closer to the way\nthat you have lived in the past right\nsimple Joys okay right okay right so\nthis is we're talking about it like it's\na bad thing but I would also say that\nthis is simple\nJoys right okay yeah you kind of get\nwhat I'm saying there I don't think it's\nnecessarily bad I mean the way that yeah\nthe way that you engage with it has been\nharmful in the past yeah that I'll agree\nwith I don't think you should start\nputting cheeky tenders on things fine\nbut let's let's understand that what you\nhave is my goal with this is to explain\nthis to you and then for you to decide\nwhat is good and what is bad right okay\nokay okay all right so this is just kind\nof your makeup now there's a couple of\nother things to understand so when we\ngamble or other things so you mentioned\nlike\nmasturbation\ngambling okay and then there's also\nother things here like alcohol\nvideo games right right so like all of\nthese things in the brain are going to\nrelease\ndopamine in this part release dopamine\nhuh video games releases dopamine\n100% how what is dopamine great question\nso dopamine is a neurotransmitter so\nthat means that it's a chemical signal\nthroughout our body and brain so in in\nthe brain we have different\nparts of our brain that dopamine does\ndifferent things so we have this part of\nour brain called the nucleus accumbent\nand the nucleus succumbent is where we\nexperience\npleasure where we where we have\nbehavioral\nreinforcement y so I'll explain what\nthis means okay sorry my handwriting is\nterrible so when I do something and I\nhave fun I want to do it again right so\nif I like get a gift and then what\nhappens H what is when I have fun in\nreal life what is happening in my brain\nthat that experience of fun is governed\nby dopamine and the nucleus accumbent\nand then the reason that the brain works\nlike this is because it wants to\nreinforce behaviors that are pleasurable\nso this is why like if we look at like\nlet's say a thousand years ago 2,000\nyears ago when human beings didn't have\nthe food that we have today\ncarbohydrates sugars and fats led to a\nsurvival increase so if I just ate like\nvegetables all the time I wouldn't\nsurvive I would need to eat calorie\ndense food because calorie dense food\nhelps human beings survive okay like in\nnature we're talking about right right\nright right so then what happens is our\nbrain is like okay this food helps me\nsurvive leaves don't help me survive but\nfried potatoes help me survive so I'm\ngoing to release more dopamine in the\nnucleus accumbens when I have\nchips or french fries and because\nthat'll help me survive and then we're\ngoing to want chips or french fries\nagain so\npleasure and reinforcing a behavior go\nhand in\nhand okay so now we can look at these\nkinds of things so masturbation we feel\ngood right when you tug one out yep\nalcohol we feel good video games we feel\ngood like when you pop a head shot in\ncsgo it's like let's go right right it's\nlike hey I'm going to put in uh I'm\ngoing to bet $500 on this and when we\nwin it feels good you with me it's kind\nof the same feeling as when you like\nwhen you're 1v5 in csgo and like you\nthink you're about to lose but then you\nkind of reverse sweep them and you\nheadshot people you're out of ammo\nyou've got your knife left and there's\nstill two of them left and then you end\nup winning the match and you win with a\nknife without ammo it's like that's\npretty epic like it's great\nright so but dopamine also does other\nthings so it also does\nmovement so it's not just pleasure so\nfor example when I move my hand like\nthis like if you just move your hand\nacross your face that's governed by\ndopamine when we have a dopamine\ndeficiency we get like this thing where\nwe can't move our hands smoothly and\nstuff like that anyway that's it does\nmore than that okay right so the key\nthing here is that if we look at kind of\nthe way your brain is probably wired\nthis what we know about people who get\ninto problems with addiction is that\nyou're going to have problems with like\nmultiple things so sometimes you'll have\na quote unquote drug of choice but the\nbasic issue here is that you are\nvulnerable to having fun which is like a\nvulnerability to dopamine release in\nyour brain okay okay now we have to look\nat a couple of other things so this is\nkind of the way you're wired this is\nalso consistent with ADHD so people with\nADHD are more vulnerable to\naddictions um okay not your fault that\nyou didn't do anything wrong it's just\nthe way that your brain is wired so\nnow let's understand a couple of things\nso if we look at people who get addicted\nto stuff they have a couple of\nNeuroscience deficits and that doesn't\nmean you're stupid or anything these\nthings can be built but naturally the\nway that your brain grows it's wired in\na certain way and we need to work harder\nto wire other things so the first thing\nis a\nlack of\ninternal\nawareness so this is consistent you fall\nin what that means I'll explain okay so\nthis is consistent with just about every\npatient I've worked with who has\nstruggled with addictions so internally\nwe have all kinds of\nemotions we have an\nego and when these things are bad so\nwhen you're feeling like a lack of\nconfidence when you're feeling sad or\npathetic all right I'm going to actually\nuse like masculine language here when\nyou're feeling pathetic when you're\nfeeling\ndispensable because here's the thing to\nunderstand men experience emotions\ndifferently yeah and a lot of the\nemotional language that we use in\nPsychology and Psychiatry like we'll use\nthese words like sadness and shame and\nwhatever but in my experience that's not\nthe experience that men have I don't\nfeel sad what I feel is pathetic and\nthose are kind of the same things but we\njust have different language for it so\nwe'll feel sad we'll feel dispensable\nwe'll feel like a right so\nwhat is what like if I ask a dude like\nhow are you feeling today they'll say\nlike I don't know and I'm like are you a\n bro and he's like yeah man\nand but what is that that's what we call\nshame you you see what I mean like shame\nor guilt is going to make but that's not\nour experience of it guess we don't like\nwake up and we're like oh man I'm\nashamed of myself today you wake up and\nyou say like man I'm a loser\nlike why am I such a loser right\nthat's what our subjective experience is\nyou you f get what I'm saying yeah yeah\nyeah yeah so now your brain has an issue\nso it is vulnerable to having fun it is\nvulnerable to dopamine but it's not just\na vulnerability it's also an advantage\nbecause now your dopamine signal is so\nstrong that any of this stuff that you\nare feeling will disappear if you can\ntrigger\nthis so if we look at kind of like\nwhat's going on in in in people who are\naddicted can you move on well that\ndepends if this gets out of check\nyour brain knows that there's a 100% uh\nway to fix any of these problems you\nknow all these these\nlosers out here who whining\nabout their emotions and like oh man\nlike I'm so sad and like oh my God I'm\nso pathetic and your brain is like\nthat yeah we can make all that go\naway let's just place a little bet let's\nbe on top of the world you have a\none-way ticket all access pass to being\non top of the world any time you\nwant all you got to do bet some\nmoney right cuz when you your brain\nknows I have $1 left in my bank account\nif I place that bet what are you going\nto get son I've never played slots\nbefore so it ain't a problem I haven't\nhad a problem with slots and it's just\n$1 left in my bank account what am I\ngoing to do how am I going to fix my\nlife with $1 you can't do with $1\ncan't even buy gum yeah so what does\nyour brain brain tell you what do you to\ndo with that dollar\nSlicker I mean now in the\ndream oh obviously you know bet it bet\nit right because when you bet that\ndollar what's going to happen Slicker\nbecome a millionaire not a millionaire\n37,000 right so your brain is like it's\nnot crazy it's smart it knows that you\ncan't become a millionaire off of a\ndollar but you can win the\njackpot and then even then your brain is\nlike hey look we're smart we made all\nthis fight mistakes we've\ngambled away $300,000 we're not going to\ngamble we won $37,000 $857 or whatever\nright that's what you said something\nlike\nthat are you in your brain in your dream\ndo you gamble away the\n37,000 no no you gamble away the $7 we\ncan afford to lose that we can afford it\nright it's okay bro don't worry about it\nyou got this brv you feel me brv we can\ndo seven it's just seven quid brv we got\n37 ,000 in the bank come on\nman you you deserve it it's a little bit\nof fun let's\ngo\nright okay so so your your brain is like\nit's interesting we'll get to that in a\nsecond but the key thing to understand\nis that there's a lack of internal\nawareness and when there's a lack of\ninternal awareness negative emotions can\npile up okay so here's your negative\nemotions and the thing is your brain has\na really interesting way where it can\nget rid of all these negative emotions\nit can get rid of them through these\nthings over\nhere okay you kind of following me like\nthe masturbation the gambling playing\ngames whatever it just shuts off our\nnegative emotions and even if we ask you\nwhat was your experience when you lose\nyou'd smack a pillow a couple times\nyou'd rage you'd cry and then your mind\nrage up people I actually you rage up\npeople I'd rage up my viewers I'd rage\nup my you'd rage at these people who are\n throwing tennis matches because\nthey've taken this thing away from you\noh my God you were supposed to win don't\nyou remember you were supposed to win\nthat's how it was supposed to\nbe and these they took it away\n them they were rigged Dr K I'm\ntelling you they were all rigged but\nthey were rigged last time they're not\ngoing to be rigged next time this time\nit's going to work because how many\ntimes can tennis matches be rigged yeah\nokay so now we get to the third thing so\nthis is something you got to understand\ncan you move on well that depends I\nthink the more that you were aware of\nthis kind of\nstuff the better off you will be okay\nbecause if you can manage your internal\nemotional state so this kind of gets to\nI know my handwriting is terrible if you\ncan't read something let me know and\nI'll I'll explain it but but here here's\nthe thing to understand if we look at\nthe times when you weren't gambling I\ndon't think it's just that you had money\nin your bank account because you've had\nmoney in your bank account you've\ngambled and you've had no money in your\nbank account you've gambled as well I\ndon't think it's the money in the bank\naccount I think it's when you were\nmaking money your life was better in a\nlot of ways and were feeling emotionally\nbetter your ego was also better right\ncuz now you're making it right you're an\nimportant person it's not just the money\nit's that look at me like I'm on Austin\nshows like I'm on Raj Patel's whatever\nlike show and like all these other\npeople like we're collabing with people\nlike xqc and lwig and like I'm a I'm a\nI'm a big boy right I'm a man\nnow like this is this is what it is like\nI'm a streamer I've made it I had some\nchump\nlike look at how awesome I am so when\nyou feel good about yourself there's no\nneed to gamble but I don't think it's\njust the money in the bank account I\nthink it's the internal stuff which many\npeople so man are at a disadvantage to\nbegin with because we are not taught\nabout our internal emotional state and\nthen furthermore a lot of women aren't\neither but this is sort of the way that\nmen are raised but as long as you're not\naware of your internal emotional state\nyou're going to be vulnerable to this\nstuff because there's going to be things\nhappening in inside you that will be\ncontrolling your\nmind and then we get to something that's\nvery important we need to\nunderstand signs of an addict's\nmind\nso and you've got kind of a classic\naddict's\nmind give me a second no I'm not the F\nwhat about others though doctor so am I\nthe first person you spoke to that's got\nlike a gambling addiction no what so but\nhave they done the same thing that I\nwould do like ask other people a\nyeah dude every single one so okay I'm\nsorry just one thing who's I know it's\nmy fault and I take responsibility but\nwhen they ask if someone for example ask\ndo I do I jump and blame the addiction\nor do you understand what I'm saying\nlike yeah so so that's a great question\nso do you blame the addiction I would\nsay that the addiction is not your fault\nbut it is your\nresponsibility true no that makes sense\nright so if you ask I mean I and I think\nthat like I don't know that blame\nactually like matters so I I think the\nproblem is that a lot of people with\naddictions will absolve themselves of\nthe responsibility because there's an\naddiction so they'll say like you know\nlike oh and so I I think you're still\nresponsible it was you right and you\ncould have made a thousand other choices\nand a thousand moments in your life that\ncould have altered the course of of\nwhere you are\ntoday and at the same time we also need\nto acknowledge that you were dealt a\nlike pretty shitty hand so some people\naren't like the reason I'm not addicted\nto gambling is because my brain is\nprobably a little bit different from\nyours I don't get to take credit for\nthat right it's not because I'm like a\nbetter person and you made some\ncomparisons between me and you I got\nmarried at the age of 28 that doesn't\nmean that I'm a better person than you\nor more competent we'll get to this at\nmore at the end but oh\nare I disagree and we can talk about\nthat more right it it just means that my\nhand in life is different so you said\nyou believe in Allah right so like Allah\nmade you the way that he made you and he\nmade me the way that he made me\nright and I don't get to take credit for\nthat no but that only depends if you\ndon't believe in that\nthough I believe something close enough\nto where I I mean I think even\nscientifically we can all acknowledge\nthat each of us has a brain that we\ndon't get to control each of us has an\nupbringing that we don't get to control\nyeah so like we only really start\nexercising control in our life by the\ntime we're like maybe like 17 18 15 if\nwe're Super Lucky but so does that kind\nof make sense so I I think that like\npeople who\nare yeah so I mean I I I've just learned\nthat a lot of the stuff that people are\nimpressed\nabout when it comes to me I actually\ncan't take credit\nfor right like I know it sounds kind of\nweird like so I get to take credit for\nmy actions but whatever my IQ is\nwhatever however loving my parents were\nyou know my parents were also like\nfinancially very stable so like they\ngave me opportunities that I don't get\nto take credit for I was like failing\nout of college but like when they sent\nme to India they bought my ticket right\nso whenever they supported me like I had\nso much financial support it's like you\ncan't it's app\nAndes um anyway we'll get get to that in\na second let's talk about the addict's\nmind for a second\nso not my viewers so early on when you\nwere hitting people up for money what\nyour mind said was not for my viewers\nright huh so you talked about a period\nof time when you started borrowing money\nright\nyeah and when you so your mind is we\nneed\nmoney\nyeah let's borrow it\nright and then your mind said but not\nfrom my viewers for some time eventually\nchanged you get what I'm saying yeah so\nhere's how you know whether you have an\naddict's mind or\nnot is that your mind will give you some\nkind of justification but at the end of\nthe day you're still borrowing money\nright does that make sense so the the\nkey the Hallmark of the addict's mind is\nit gives you a\njustification but no matter what the\njustification is you're still going to\ngamble so at the beginning you said I'm\ngoing to use my own money I'm not going\nto borrow anything else but what is your\nmind telling you to do it's giving you\npermission it's saying go gamble Slicker\nit's okay as long as we don't cross this\nline so we're over\nhere let's say here's the gambling\nthreshold okay and then this is the line\nthat we're not going to cross this is\nother people and then what happens is\nyou borrow money from them and then this\nchanges to not my\nviewers I don't know if this kind of\nmakes sense but your mind will always\nlet you gamble but it'll give some kind\nof artificial rules but at the end of\nthe day it's saying okay like we've got\n$10,000 in the bank or we've got 50 you\nhad 50k and so what does your mind tell\nyou your mind tells you okay we can we\ncan bet a little bit right even in the\ndream even when you get to control\nthings says we can afford to spend seven\nso no matter what happens okay\n$7\ngamble not my\nviewers\nGamble and when it becomes your viewers\nlet's make personal\nvideos\ngamble so do you see that no matter what\nyour mind whatever whatever happens in\nyour mind your mind comes up with some\nkinds of thoughts but the behavior is\nalways the same yeah all roads lead to\nthis and I I I see this a lot maybe I'll\nuse an example because I I don't think\nI'm explaining this the best but I see\nthis a lot with people who smoke pot\nokay and when people use marijuana they\nsay hey it's not addictive right that\nmeans I can use every\nday or is it like I don't get high every\nday that means it's\nokay they'll whatever their mind will\nwill move into whatever position it\nneeds to to make it okay to you today\ntoday it's okay in the future I won't\nworry about it in the future this this\nthis is the line but like today like\nit'll give you whatever information to\nallow your brain to engage in whatever\nthe addiction is this is the Hallmark of\nthe addict's mind okay when your mind\nstarts twisting and turning and the\nanswer is always the same today is okay\nbut tomorrow will be will be different y\nI see yep true right so if your mind\nstarts doing that the answer is always\nyou can provide whatever justification\nthis thing will change this column will\nchange every single day but the end\nresult will always be the same oh as\nlong as my parents don't know it's okay\nas long as I limit it it's okay as long\nas this happens as long as blah blah\nblah blah as long as this person doesn't\nknow as long as I don't do this I'm\ngoing to and the thing is the the what\nis acceptable and what is unacceptable\nkeeps\nmoving right that's what happens as you\nsaid one day as long as I don't take it\nfrom my viewers it's okay okay and\nthen oh it's okay but as long as\nsomething like that happens like that\nthis is the Hallmark of the addict's\nmind is that if your mind is telling you\nif there's a part of you that knows that\nthis is a bad idea but then your mind\nsays it's okay if we use this kind of\nlogic it makes it okay today that's the\naddict's Mind does that make sense\nokay um\nso so the end goal is just gamble no\nmatter what\nexactly right so so and let me just go\nahead and move this over\nhere and then we're gonna I'm going to\nstop screen sharing with you and we're\ngoing to go back to\nthis so you kind of asked you know can\nyou ever move on so what I would say you\nknow if I was teaching a class so I\ndon't know specifically about you I\nthink that's something that it's\nworthwhile to talk to a therapist or\npsychologist and work through what your\nspecific limits are but I would say that\nyour brain is vulnerable to this\nprobably for a better part of a lot of\nyour life right so sorry vulnerable what\nwait what does it mean what does it mean\nfor vulnerable so that means that that\nyour brain is always going to have that\none-way ticket to feeling good okay okay\nthat that I don't think is going to\nchange okay\nbut the key thing is that there are\ncertain things that you can do to\nthere's certain armor that you can wear\nto protect you against that\nvulnerability so this is things like\nemotional\nawareness confidence yeah yeah like I've\nhad sometimes like I would be like\nthinking like oh I like I'd watch a\ntennis game and be like damn this game\nwhat was OD he actually lost oh my God\nthat would have been crazy imagine I\nwent for it but then I'd think and be\nlike yeah but if I done that what are\nthe bad things that's going to happen\nyou know I'm no M what I'm going to lose\nthe money\nregardless I'm going to lose the money\neven if I win big I'll start losing\nmoney and what happens if I lose the\nmoney I'm going to go back to the same\nthing that happened in the past I ruin\nmy life again very good so so what's\nchanged there so let's say 10 years ago\nyou did not think about the consequences\nyour brain just saw the upside and now\nif we literally look at your thoughts\nyou have new thoughts in your head which\nare no matter what this is going to end\nin shambles right this is not going to\nwork out the way that my mind tells me\nbut that's that that's that vulnerable\nto fun that's that kid who punched the\nfire alarm that's that kid who's like\n it let's\ngo right so that's going to that part is\nalways going to be there in some form so\nit can get better so there's evidence\nthat shows that you know some people do\ngrow out of addictions for sure but the\nreason that I'm saying that gen the\nreason I'm not emphasizing that is\nbecause every person who's listening to\nthis may have an addict's mind and\nthey're going to listen to this and\ndoctors Dr K says oh hey I can grow out\nof this addiction which means what is\ntheir addict's mind going to do if Dr K\nsays that they can grow out of the\naddiction what are they going to do\nSlicker not they're gonna start gambling\nyeah right okay right because yeah yeah\nso you're you're you're gonna like use\nit as an excuse hey Dr K said that I can\ngrow out of this yeah that means it's\nokay right it's okay today I can grow\nout of it I've probably grown out of it\nnow let's go Slicker come on just just a\ntener cheeky tenner let's\ngo that's what I was actually wondering\nthough about the casinos and stuff like\nI've been invited to him of course you\nhave no and sometimes I'm like what's\nthe problem if I do go but do you think\nit's similar could I get caught up cuz I\nwant to give you an example I did a I\ndid a I did a a sponsor for a casino\nspot slot it was boring boring never\ntouched it again I did the slots all\nthat it was boring jump back into\nsports my what I say to other people I\nsay that it's like a a weed and now I'm\nI'm going to be 100% wrong cuz obviously\nyou know um I but my thought is like a\nguy that smokes weed is addicted to weed\nbut if he tries heroin he's not going to\nbe addicted to\nheroin that's true so so and I I would\nsay that this is where like it's this is\nwhy it's kind of like an individual\ndiscussion so we do know that people\nwill sometimes have drugs of choice okay\nso what that sort of means is that you\nhave a certain vulnerability in your\nbrain you have a certain genetics that\nmakes you prone to be addicted to let's\nsay heroin but not Aderall or not\nmarijuana or not alcohol so we know that\nthat's absolutely\nthere I would still say though\nthat the the the question I think is not\nabout whether you can get away with it\nor not I think that because that's\nthat's what the addict's mind says and\nyou may be able to I'm it's that's it's\nvery individual but my question is\nwhat's the life that you want to live do\nyou want to take the chance true no\nyou're actually 100% right on that right\nI it's not about whether you can get\naway with it it's like what do you want\nyour life to be why should I even test\nmyself doing it exactly you know no true\nright and so you say can you move on I\nmean I would say that in a lot of ways\nyou have but this is the thing to\nremember is this is a big mistake that a\nlot of people make once they get sober\nthey think I am sober\nconfidence it's the circumstance that\nyou have right now that let you be sober\nif you change circumstances there's a\ndecent chance you'll relapse see\nsobriety is environmental this is\nsomething that we understand very well\nfrom the research this is why we send\npeople to Alcoholics Anonymous even\nPsychotherapy sometimes is not enough\nyou need peer support you need all kinds\nof other things so like I used to work\nat a drug rehab so people would come for\n30 days and they would be sober because\nthey're in a drug rehab I've\nbeen sober for 30 days the reason you've\nbeen sober for it's been easy easy\nbecause you're not trapped I mean you\ncan walk out anytime you want to but\nlike you basically don't have access to\nanything but once you start hanging out\nwith the same people once you start you\nknow going back to the\nstress of like your job or your marriage\nor whatever once the environment changes\nthe vulnerability will arise\nagain and so can you move on I mean I\nwould say it's possible that you would\nmove on but I think for a lot of people\nwho struggle with addiction it's not\nworth it to try has been my experience\nwith the majority of my patients right\nthis is just the way that your life is\nand you're trading one life for another\nlife and it's about choosing which life\nyou want do you want a life of high\nhighs and low lows because let's be\nhonest the life that you had was pretty\n epic in a lot of ways this is\nsomething you don't say enough everyone\ntalks about addiction like it's a bad\nthing and I think on balance it's a bad\nthing but oh my God while it's good it's\nso good in ordinary life cannot\ncompete that feeling of winning $6,000\nlike you're going to get some check in\nyour bank account for 400 quid because\nyou worked a hard week like that can\nfeel good and manly in some ways but to\nmake $6,000 or quid or Pounds or\nwhatever like in 6 seconds is there's\nyou just you're going to lose that part\nof your life you just can't win like\nthat\nyep yep you got to work for it that's my\nalso my brain is like you know you're\nworking for that money you're just\nthrowing it away no matter what\nregardless you know yeah and and and\nthen this is the other thing right so if\nwe look at the addict's mind when you\ngamble you weren't going to lose you\nwere going to win and so what does that\ntell all all roads lead to one place\nit's okay to do it today yeah you're\ngoing to win oh last time it was\nrigged she threw or he threw in the\nsports match this time it's going to be\ndifferent and conclusion Gamble and\nconclusion Gamble and whatever it's\ngoing to come up with it's going to be\nso\ncreative yeah you're you're an artist\nSlicker your mind is Leonardo Da Vinci\nof coming up with excuses to let you g\nno you're not wrong unfortunately in the\nbad way though absolutely yeah so this\nis the problem with addiction is that\nthe power of your mind is turned against\nyou yeah this is why it's so hard to\novercome because you're not fighting the\naddiction what you're really fighting is\nyourself it's like one of these I don't\nknow these like animes or video games or\nwhatever where you got some parasite in\nyour head that takes control of\nyou and and this is what a lot of people\ndon't understand people think oh I'm\naddicted I'm stupid you're not stupid\nthe problem is you're brilliant\nthe problem is that you're gifted and\nthe problem is that mind is being turned\nagainst you well very weak very weak I\nfeel like it like I'm very weak to not\nable to control my myself at those\nparticular points that you are weaken\n100% so you have a powerful mind but\nyour ability to control it is weak yes\nso this is like I'm going to go for a\nwalk and on the other end of the leash\nI'm going to have a grizzly\nbear this is what it's like to be\naddicted and then you're not taking the\ngrizzly bear for a walk the grizzly bear\nis taking you for a walk hey\nright right and the goal is to turn the\ngrizzly bear into like a mouse right for\nyou to get so big and and we could talk\nabout how to do that for you to train\nyourself and that's where the emotional\nawareness comes in and the confidence\ncomes in because the more confident you\nbecome and the more aware you become of\nyour internal emotional state that's how\nwe make the grizzly bear smaller and\nthat's how we make you\nstronger and so as you develop\nconfidence in yourself and there are\nother tools that we can use so one of my\nfavorites is viraga which means\nDetachment okay I'll expl\nViagra not that's another favorite tool\nbut for a different\ndifferent Vaga is Detachment so that\nmeans that for you to be able to take a\nstep back and say you know what I don't\nactually want this Joy it's okay for me\nto not have this Joy it's okay for me to\nhave a life that is less than perfect I\ncan learn to be content with what I have\nI've got a nice cup of tea and I can\ndrink this and the joy and pleasure from\nthis is enough yes there's a a lot more\nfun over there and this happens to me\nlike almost every day there's a part of\nme you play any mobas League of Legends\nor Dota or anything yep\nunfortunately yeah League of Legends I\nplay DotA and almost every day I have\nthis desire to play DotA right and one\nday like I'll crack and I'll play some\nDOTA and the thing is I suck\nright because like unless you practice\nyou you're bad and I'm like I I'm tired\nof being bad like I don't want to lose\nlike I want to win and then I think to\nmyself okay like now I'm going to get\nserious I'm going to start like\npracticing saying like I'm going to like\nget good at this game and then cuz I\nreally want that then I take a step back\nand I ask myself is this really what I\nwant do I want to spend like I could\nliterally I could write a book or I can\nget good at Dota 2 that's it's the same\namount of effort honestly you're like\nliterally write a book or I could get\ngood at DOTA\nto and so we have to learn to detach we\nhave to learn to take a step back from\nokay this joy in life is like not mine\nlike it's okay let me like learn to be\nwith what I have because if you really\nstop and think about it your joy in life\nis actually can be pretty high you won't\nget that same level of dopamine but you\ncan enjoy taking a piss man like one of\nthe most Blissful activities is if\nyou've been like you know you've been in\na car for a while and you're waiting for\nthe bathroom and like oh my God just\ntaking a piss yeah true right there's\njoy everywhere in life we just don't\nknow how to look for it we don't need\nany of that\nstuff so can you move on I think the\nanswer is maybe can you get away with\ngambling in a casino maybe I think the\nquestion is what kind of Life do you\nwant to live and do you want to risk it\nis it worth it right yeah y y that's not\na question I can answer for\nyou yeah it's of course I'm the one that\nhas to answer that and like no you're\nright cuz like I do I used to think of\nthat as well a lot like when I was\nstreaming I was like what I was so I\ndidn't think of it like that during the\ntimes when I was uh streaming I was mess\nmessaging a girl thinking of getting\nmarried to her well I'm but I didn't\nthink of my\nminus I was just thinking no I'm going\nto marry you you know but to realize it\nwhen you actually Rock Bottom you\nactually come to realize so you know\nwhat what happened what you did and you\nknow who may have affected cuz I didn't\nthink of when it was me when I was\nstreaming and I was doing it I was like\nI'm suicidal thoughts and I want to do\nsuicide but I didn't really think of the\npeople that took money from cuz they\ncould have had Suicidal Thoughts From\nwhat I was doing to them you know that\nall came in when I you know was actually\nstarted working and you know when I got\ncaught and you know it really started\nmaking me realize more and more so let's\ntalk about this so this is another thing\nso there are six\nneuroscientists this is kind of my\ntheory but in my opinion there are six\nneuroscientific deficits in people who\nhave\naddictions uh you've stumbled on a\nsecond one which is a lack of empathy so\nwe don't our brain is not wired it's not\nyour fault right this is very important\nto understand because empathy is a skill\njust like anything else it's taught to\npeople so if you have parents that were\nvery empathic and it sounds like your\nparents were not very empathic but it\nsounds like your your parents we haven't\ntalked too much about it but I would\nguess that there were times when you\nwere young when you wanted something and\nyour dad was basically like no he didn't\ngive a what you wanted he didn't\nthink about you there's right and\nthere's is wrong if you do right you're\nokay if you're I don't give a about\nyour opinion and your feelings bro like\nyou know yeah yeah so so when we're\nwe're we're raised with strict parents\nlike that they don't teach us empathy\nour parents your dad wasn't like oh\nSlicker beta I'm so I know you want to\ndo this and beta I love you so much but\nwe cannot beta he's like pop yeah Bamboo\nSteak no PO I I would be lucky with that\nwas a bamboo steak right you\nyour hour I don't care that you have\nADHD I don't care that your mind\nliterally cannot concentrate I don't\ncare about any of that when I tell you\nto do something you do it I\ndon't care about your feelings I don't\ncare about what you think I don't care\nabout anything that's going on inside\nyou your internal environment is\ncompletely useless to\nme and when you grow up in a household\nlike that how are you supposed to learn\nas a seven-year-old child to think about\nother people what you're taught is that\nthere's right and there's wrong Haram\nor Halal right two things yeah right and\nwrong we don't care about your feelings\nand when you're raised like that I'm not\ntrying to be anti-muslim or my parents\nwere like that and Hindus are like that\nChristians are like that it's it's\ndifferent parents it's not religion\nspecific which is sad but anyway um you\nknow so I I I think that that that's\nlike another thing where you don't you\ndon't know how to think about other\npeople and that's not your fault but you\ncan start right you can start by sort of\nthinking a little bit about okay how\ndoes this person feel like what what\nwill this and you can listen to other\npeople and this is where we get to your\nquestion you asked the question about\nwomen would a woman be okay with\nwhat uh you ask some question about\nwomen like would they be okay with my\npast yeah so you know like how awkward\nthat be oh I scammed uh dur e you know\nthat's the first so so I know it sounds\nkind of weird but like would a woman be\nokay I have no\nidea understand that women just like men\nare individuals and some will be okay\nwith it and some will not be okay with\nit and I would bet I would bet money\nthat okay more of them will be I don't\nknow I don't even know I'm not saying\n51% but I think as compared to you not\nhaving a gambling problem I think more\nhumans would be okay with that yeah\nright but I think this is the cool thing\nis that I I think\nhuh no\nhow what do you mean how would they be\nokay with it though how would anyone be\nokay with it yeah but you said 51% no so\nI'm not saying that 51 I don't know what\nthe percentage is but I'm saying if if\nyou take two human beings one who has a\ngambling addiction and one who doesn't\nhave a gambling\naddiction I think more people would be\neasily accepting of the person with no\naddiction oh sorry yeah right so so no I\ndid a bad job of explaining it so I I'm\nwith you that it's it's it's another\nuphill battle that you have to fight or\nclimb and at the same time I think that\nlike my experience working with people\nwho were addicted is that like love is\nlike pretty powerful man and I\nthink the main thing is that you know\nyou kind of say that you've grown from\nit and like I've seen so many healthy\nrelationships come out of recovery from\naddiction because when you're addicted\nto something you have to learn about\nyourself in a way that the average\nperson doesn't you have to work so hard\nto be normal and that work ethic that\nself- understanding is actually makes\nyou better at\nrelationships yeah so if you've never\nbeen addicted this internal emotional\nawareness this ego all this kind of crap\nlike you've done a lot of soul searching\nSlicker you kind of get what I'm saying\nyou're still in the process but even\nsimple like so many women will\ncomplain because their boyfriends don't\nmake their bed and do their\n laundry and are not like cuz\nthey've got Mama right right especially\nif you're I mean is your mom Iraqi too\nyep God damn right so like and US\n Middle East South Asian like\nthat's the\nworst yeah like women in the audience\nknow what I'm talking about if you date\nlike an Indian boy or Pakistani boy or\nlike Iraqi boy like you know their masas\nwill wipe their ass when they're\n45 I was getting when I was like 15 my\nmom used to dry me wait no it\nyeah I know I don't know that's our\nthat's our culture we infantilize 10 10\n10 10 we we infantilize our kids in in\nour cultures right oh my God Slicker is\nsuch a good boy such a great boy like\ndon't ever leave s like don't you're\nworried about women not accepting you\nbecause you have a gambling addiction\nyou need to worry more about what your\nmom is going to do with your girlfriend\nand vice versa Oh my days oh actually\nshe did accept her to to be honest I was\nshocked I was my got yeah very but um\nyeah no you're right though so so I I I\nthink you give people a chance right and\nI think you recognize that I mean I'm\nnot saying that your life would be\nbetter if you didn't have a g I mean I I\nthink if you didn't have a gambling\naddiction I think you can easily say\nthat your life would have been better\nbut I think that you've got to also\nunderstand that the way that you're\ngrowing out of this I think will make\nyou a healthier partner for a\nrelationship and some people are willing\nto that and some people aren't and\nthat's okay I've seen enough people who\nare married to and have healthy\nrelationships with recovering addicts to\nwhere I wouldn't I mean is it a\ndisadvantage yes but I don't think it's\ninsurmountable I feel like um it was\nlike I paid less attention to her and\npaid more obviously more attention to\nGamblin like it would it was I even like\ntimes where it was important I wouldn't\neven buy her stuff spend it on myself\nand go all in on a game yeah so I think\nif you want to have a good girlfriend\njust don't be a shitty boyfriend right\nno facts facts yeah right so I I I\nwouldn't worry I mean like it's it's a\ndisadvantage and I'm people will judge\nyou for it Slicker they will and I wish\nthat weren't the case but and and that's\nwhy I say I move on and I look at my\npast and if anyone tries to attack it\nwith me I'm like you know what that\nain't me anymore so I'm going smile at\nthat as a as a it was a joke it was a\njoke of a past does that make any sense\nyeah I think that's your way of\ndeveloping a narrative around it right\nlike you disrespect someone else\ndisrespects the person you used to be\nand you disrespect the person you used\nto be that's not even\nunhealthy that person was a joke and I'm\nno longer going to be that person y that\nsounds inspirational to me I even made\njokes about it like even for my tweet I\nmade a joke now you tell me if that's\nokay or good should I send it to you or\ndo you want to like should I just\nexplain it explain I\nI'll explain it so basically I went I\nwent to London saw a Lamborghini took a\npicture in front of it and I tweeted out\nsaying guys so just uh one big in sports\nbut and like you know thank you for\neveryone who's been there for me as a\njoke you know and you know people are\nbelieving it but I put like hashtags\nsaying like this is sarcasm and stuff\nyou know that's what I want to do I want\nto like look at it and just be like you\nknow what just laugh I think that is a\nway for me to move forward you know not\ntake gambling too serious and just be\nlike you know it'll be like it's a joke\nso I think that that is seems consistent\nwith who you are right that's the kid\nthat's the way that the kid who punches\nthe fire alarm is going to grow out of\nthis and at the same time Slicker I\nthink you've got to understand that for\nthe people who you scammed money from\nfor you to be joking about it it's going\nto hurt it's not going to be received\nthe best from some people I'm not saying\nit's right or wrong that's not it's not\nmy place to judge right or wrong say I\nunderstand that true true true and I'd\nnever want to disrespect them I'd never\nwant to disrespect them it's just I know\nthe audience that's out there like if\nthey message i' I've reached out to a\nlot of them and I've just checked up\nthem hope they're okay and stuff like\nthat you know and they kind of some of\nthem know I'm kind of like un streaming\nand stuff like that and then of course\nif anyone is offended like if Ludwig or\nany of those people said like what the\n are you doing I'm like I'm sorry\nyou know I apologize and I think you've\ngot to figure out what's right for you\nbut I think that it's very common\nfor human beings to use humor to\novercome hardship okay yeah there right\nthere's even some interesting like\npapers about Jewish people and I'm\nhopefully I'm not getting canceled here\nthis is not disrespectful hopefully but\nyou know the Jewish people are very\nfamous like even Jewish comedians will\ntalk about their predisposition towards\nhumor and it's because they've gone\nthrough so much hardship that it's\nalmost become culturally a part of the\nculture to be funny and if that offends\nanyone I apologize but like that that's\nwhat we just sort of know is that when\nwhen cultures and families and stuff\nlike that when human beings go through\ndifficulty we laugh and that's one of\nthe ways that we move past it move but\nit's it is wrong it is wrong it is yeah\nno I that's like I said that's for you\nto decide I'm not saying that it's right\nor wrong like no matter what I will\nnever be able to escape from it it's\ngoing to be there for the rest of my\nlife so that's why I say like for myself\nI could use that and just show that you\nknow like you every time I tweet are\nyou're that begging guy or that scumming\nguy so all I can say is that I'm going\nto have to start like showing that\nthere's no you whatever you say ain't\ngoing to hurt me in a way yeah no uh so\nI think there's a couple things there so\none is one is that like I think it's O I\nthink whatever you say ain't going to\nhurt me is\nvery reflect like I don't think it's bad\nbut I also think like it's okay for\nthings to hurt\nyou being hurt is not the end of the\nworld right being able to handle the\nhurt being able to process the HT it\nlacks\nconfidence what for what was that what\nlacks confidence myself I lack with\nconfidence when I'm like okay I'm not\nI'm scared to tweet I'm scared to say\nsomething I'm scared to do this and that\nyou know I'm going to get this response\ngoes to you know I show these guys like\nokay you go try ahead and attack me with\nit but I'm not going to but any of the\npeople that are scammed of course like\nagain like I will not want to disrespect\nthem yeah yeah so I I see what you're\nsaying about using humor to kind of\nbuild up your confidence but I would say\nthat there's even a level past that\nwhich is like I don't know if this makes\nsense but to be confident in yourself as\na flawed person to where you don't need\nto\nflex no that's a\nman right so you want to know you asked\nme a question what do I think a man is I\nthink a man is someone who doesn't need\nto flex okay which is interesting\nbecause most of the alpha males out\nthere are doing the exact opposite yep\nyep yep true and they're and maybe I'm\nwrong right so this is just my opinion\nyou ask me what I someone who doesn't\nneed to flex right you're you you're\nflawed you're not better or worse than\nany other human being you can be better\nat some stuff and worse at some stuff\nthat's all fine but just someone who\ndoesn't need to flex and for the record\nI mean I don't think that that's just a\nman I think that's all human beings\nright okay yeah but I I think when it\ncomes to like healthy masculine\nlike I think a big part of unhealthy\nmasculinity is when we\nuse see healthy masculinity should come\nfrom like a place of stability or\nTranquility not a place of how can I say\nthis not a lack or something that's\nmissing so if I if I lack confidence in\nmyself and then I like if I flex to show\noff and stuff like that that that don't\nI think is healthy it's it's what\nwhatever is stable and tranquil within\nyou should that's where masculinity\nshould really come from okay so if\nmasculinity is trying to solve some\ndeficiency about yourself like if I feel\nlike I'm not attractive or if I feel\nlike I'm a loser and then I'm going to\nbecome an alpha because I'm no longer\nLos I don't think that that's healthy it\ncan be actually can be healthy it can be\na stage of healthiness so it can be one\nstep forward now that I think about it\nbut especially like if you do get hate\nthough I feel like you know like for me\nit's true what you're saying because\nlike for me I actually want to do the\nonly one person I actually want to\nimpress right now is myself I want to\nimpress myself I want to improve myself\nyou know and of course to be honest even\nmy family and stuff but that's going to\nbe hard but um you know for my right now\nI'd want to improve myself and impress\nmyself you know and trust myself so yeah\nso that I think is beautiful I mean I\nthink the goal here should not be I\nthink the goal is you should become\nsomeone that you can be proud of yeah\nit's not to be proud of yourself how do\nI develop confidence how do I develop\nPride that's the wrong question become\nsomeone that pride is\nnatural that you don't have to try\neveryone's asking you how do I become\nconfident become just be the person who\nis confident right so think about\ntreating yourself with respect that\nmeans being careful about what you put\ninto your body that means being careful\nabout how you take care of yourself it\nmeans prioritizing yourself valuing\nyourself that's where confidence comes\nfrom y here we are like going externally\nand trying to say okay if I do these\nfive things I will develop confidence\nbut internally like you're not worth it\nyet so start to prioritize yourself this\nis\nbeautiful\nyep yeah it's still like I want to I\nfeel\nlike it's I don't want it to crawl back\nI don't want it to crawl back into my\nlife like that's one scary thing cuz I\nknow I know 100% one little touch and\nI'll be back back into it I got offered\na contract uh of uh casino\nslots no uh CS go gambling so what not\nwhat originated my gambling cuz that was\nEsports they offered me case openings\nyou just click open cases and stuff like\nthat and it was going to be a good\namount cuz I'm actually un I am jobless\nright now so you know I just basically\ndo streaming uh entertainment I'm I'm\nnot going to lie you know side money I\nmean everyone loves that you know and uh\nyou know and when they offered me I was\nlike wow this could you know keep me get\nback get me back to where I was but what\nis the outcome now for my mind is right\nnow is like I see dirty money and when I\nwas streaming when I used to make good\namount of money I used to be like I want\nto kill myself if I ever drop back to\nlike the minimum wage you know it's not\nnice to say or use the word or play\naround with the world kill yourself but\nlike um I used to be like I don't want\nto live anymore if I'm going to go back\nto a normal job what happened with\neverything when it all came out that's\nwhere I said I was grateful I was\ngrateful to work a normal job and make\nan actual good amount I didn't really\nthink of money I just thought of like\nyou know improving improving as a person\nbeing grateful uh thankful having my\nparents by my side having another chance\nin life you know that's beautiful and I\nnot a lot of people get that and that's\nAl another thing where I should be very\nextremely grateful is that there is not\nexcus or Ludwig for a lot of other\ngambling addicts out there you know and\nI feel like they're not to be hated cuz\nI also I also think and I feel for them\ncuz I know there is a lot of people that\ngo crazy for this and you know get angry\nand all that stuff and you know I don't\nknow you know like when I went to\ntherapy it was I thought it was it was\njust honest to God I thought it\nwas when I went in until\nuntil oh because I was like how can you\nchange me when I need to change me what\nare you going to do give me a drug\ninsert something inside of me and make\nme a different person no but when I went\nI got to speak to someone you know not\nlike the internet oh you're you know\nyou're a piece of you know those\nare not the people I should be speaking\nto at that at that point the therapist\nyou know oh hey you know it was someone\nI could feel comfortable to come out\nwith and explain it and then she was\nlike you know a friend and she was um\nshe gave me a paper she said what are\nthe fun things you like about gambling\ngave you a few what are the bad things\nabout gambling gave her a lot what do\nyou do when you're not gamble what do\nyou do it was a lot and it that went\ninside my head and that's where I\nexplained it to you I was like oh okay\nyou know this really this is the reason\nwhy I shouldn't do it and this is the\nreason why what is the point in doing it\nyou know cuz I can actually smile now I\nknow I know I shouldn't be but I can't\nkeep saying that you know I'm just going\nto be like I can actually smile now you\nknow I can\nactually hopefully see a future I don't\nknow to be it's I still don't\nsee you know a future because like that\nis me me but until I get a woman or\nsomething maybe I can or and until I pay\nthe remaining enough then I can have a\nfuture you know yeah I I and I I think\nthat's that sounds super reasonable to\nme man like I I think you're just you're\non your journey\nand I think it's appropriate for you to\nnot see a future but also to acknowledge\nthat just because you can't see it now\ndoesn't mean that it won't come right\nright so this is the other tricky thing\nabout a future is like whether you can\nsee it or not there's only one direction\nto move in life which is forward\nyeah so everyone's talking about like I\nthink this is a big problem we have in\nsociety where everyone's like okay I'm\ntrying to build towards this future\nwhat's your 10 year plan what's your 20-\nyear plan like I mean no one can\nsee the future everyone's so caught up\nin 10 or 20 year plans instead what we\nshould be caught up in is like what's my\nlike today plan what's my five minutes\nfrom now plan like what's my like what\nam I going to put into my body today Y\nis it going to be like a banana or is it\ngoing to be a\ncookie and and we can make and this is\nthe the interesting thing is that that a\nfuture is not built up when you plan for\nthe future a future is built up through\nactions today that's the only way that\nfuture is\nbuilt and so I I you know I I I think\nyou're on your journey it sounds good\nwhere you are it sounds like you have\nbling a blessing trust me a blessing\n100% a blessing I'm me been able to\n click the live button you know\nlike have a have even when I started\nlike when I went live I was like I'm\ngoing expect 200 viewers or\nless get to 300 400 I'm like I'm blessed\ngrateful more and more that's I feel\nlike you know through mistakes could\ncome good things in the worst way of\ncourse that's not nice and you know but\nlike everyone does mistakes no one's\nperfect that's what I believe you see\nall these people out there you know like\neven in a streaming world they're like\nyo that's where you was mentioning about\nego you think you're all it you think\nyou're special and you think I will\nnever be like that guy cuz I used to do\nthat I used to see gamblers even though\nI was guming I was like look at this\nidiot imagine oh why would you do that\nbro I would even be like some streamers\nlike why would you spend your money like\nthat why are you being an idiot you're a\nstreamer you have a future B that came\nout to be me that came out to be me and\nuh you know you know the the tricky\nthing there is it's it's when we believe\nwe have a future it's when we're assured\nthat we have a future it's when the\nfuture is guaranteed that we actually\nmake the worst choices yeah oh cuz I\nhave a future it's guaranteed I can\nafford to around I can afford to do\nthis I can afford to do this because oh\nlike the future is bright you know so I\nI think we get scammed by the future all\nthe\ntime\nlike yeah I don't\nknow I try and\nuh I won't ever forget for what I did\nthough I won't good like it's yeah like\nand I shouldn't I shouldn't forget for\nwhat I did in the especially to the\npeople and you know I'm always of course\nyou know these people I'll always look\nup to you know\nbut I don't know I don't know for myself\nI don't see I don't know it's so awkward\nwhen I see it like as in the I do speak\nto quite a few women and that was the\nmost awkward thing when she said that to\nme she was like H I do know what you did\nin the past I was like yeah I cut off\nbut I don't know where to go with that\nleading conversation I don't know how\nyou yeah that is me and what you're\ngoing to do by it you can't say that I\ndon't know yeah so would you like some\nhelp with that please okay so now let's\nget concrete sure okay so I mean you\nknow I think when someone acknowledges\nit like you can\nsay I mean so there couple different\nmoves here so one move is to be humorous\nright you can say well like honestly\nthat's great because you save me the\ntrouble of like you know being who I am\nI never know when to tell someone\nbecause it's awkward right right\nright right hi my name is slicker I'm a\ngambling addict do you tell people on\nthe first date do you tell people on the\nsecond date do you tell like when do you\nbreak the news so you know you can just\nkind of joke about it you can say like\nlook I'm glad you know saves me the\ntrouble of telling you laugh it off you\nknow also I think sends the right kind\nof\nenergy um that's one\nthought I\nthink another thing that you can do is\njust kind of own it right you can say\nlike yeah that was a really dark period\nof my life and like I'm really trying to\nmove on and I made some progress and\njust kind of own it right and it's like\nsomething that I work on every day like\nyou don't know what they're thinking of\nthey're like you know that's the thing\nthat's what comes into my thoughts like\nno she knows about that she probably\nlike he might scam me no no no no but\nSlicker you don't know what they're\nthinking\neither right so you've got to be careful\nabout your mind so when you feel a lack\nof confidence you will project that lack\nof confidence into the thoughts of\nothers I don't know what they're\nthinking and you don't know what they're\nthinking it's not your job to make them\nthink a certain way if you really want\nto have a relationship with another\nhuman being you're not trying to this is\nwhat's so up is we're so\nmanipulative for people's thoughts if I\nsay this they'll think this and if I say\nthis they'll think this we're sitting\nthere trying to control people's\nthoughts all the time so we shape what\nwe say to control their think about us\nit's\nmanipulative instead speak your truth\nand let them judge it's their right to\njudge right and if people want to judge\nyou ill for it that's not someone that\nyou want a relationship with\nanyway why are you going to go chasing\nthem down and that's their choice right\nthey have they have every right to not\nwant to be your friend 100% 100% so just\nlet that go you're walking your journey\nand you're going to represent yourself\nas authentically and positively as\npossible and let people judge you the\nway that they're going to judge\nyou it's it's it's all right though my\nmom said that we I'm going to be getting\nmarried to my cousin soon so that's all\nright I'm joking I'm joking I'm joking\nI'm joking that's it's wait you not\nsurprised I was actually joking no no no\nno yeah yeah that's I was I was\ninternally I was debating whether I\nwanted to joke back with you about you\nknow who's going to get you ready for\nyour wedding night is your mom going to\nbe there and towel you off after and\nlike all you know\nif I told you something it would be even\nweird like actually I don't want to say\nit here I I don't want to say it yeah oh\nmy God I keep ruining it CU I say it's\nbeen all right there are people in my\nfamily that\nare cousins so maybe that's my outcome\ncame like\nthis yeah we're not going to touch that\nwith 10 foot pole\nbro yeah no we um I don't know yeah I\nmean you know that's a little bit more\ncommon in some cultures and true is it\nis is it coming in uh you do apologize\nyou're Indian correct yeah yeah yeah\nright is it coming in\nIndia I want to say no but there is\nthere is certainly like some kinds of\nrestrictions and things like that so\nlike uh it's changed a lot now but you\nknow when my parents got married they\nwere of different\ncasts and so cast like spells and stuff\nno no no so so in in India there's like\na cast system so there's like categories\nof people\nright so there's like the the priest\ncast and then there's like the warrior\ncast The Merchant cast and the laborer\ncast and so you normally would marry\nwithin your cast but the cast is pretty\nbig okay okay okay okay so like you know\nmy grandmother like for example would\nnot you know back in my Village which\nhas like 300 people like what would\nhappen is we'd go like one or two towns\nover to find like a\nspouse and and so you don't you're not\nmarrying like within the family but you\nalso like want to be careful you want to\nmarry someone who you have some\nrelationship with so you know that\nthey're from a good family or bad family\nand there's all this kind of stuff but\nthings are changing now do you think\nit's wrong to do that I'm not doing that\nthat's I'm not do do what cin cin\nmarriage I mean I think genetically it's\nnot a good idea you know cuz like I feel\nlike I have a power and I'm not even\njoking with you I actually believe I've\ngot I can I don't know it's like I'm\ncreative not in okay people going to\nlike yeah you're going to say the you\nknow the scam way but not just even then\nscam it like even in games Dr K like\nit's I'm the brain is like 5D I'm\nusing but what does that have to do with\nmarrying\ncousins cuz my mom and dad are cousins\nokay you know so like they created it in\ndoes that mean I'm an\ninbred no way I'm so I I don't know what\nyou like okay so look here's what we\nknow okay my parents for my G\naddiction if you want to so so here's\nhere's just what we know about genetics\nokay so we have two kinds of genes we\nhave autosomal do we have dominant and\nrecessive genes okay the problem is that\nsometimes if you have a recessive gene\nand you've got two copies of it you can\nget some kind of problem usually so the\nproblem is that The Closer you are\ngenetically right like the greater the\nlikelihood is that you'll get two\nrecessive genes and then you end up with\nsome kind of uh like so you're basically\ngiv information of me I see I but but\nbut I mean I think cousins are I mean we\ncan map this out it's been a little\nwhile since I took genetics let's\nunderstand what the so you're 50% with\nyour parents right and parents are 50%\nwith each other and then their kids\nshare\n50% so I mean I I think it's like maybe\nthey share like 1/8 of their genetic\ngenc material or\nsomething I mean it's it's still high I\nI wouldn't biologically it's not the\nbest bet but I think the other thing we\nhave to understand is that in these\ncultures where you do have like closer\nfamiliar marriages there are all kinds\nof other societal pressures so I think\nthe cultures that do this kind of thing\ndo it for a reason like generally\nspeaking when you know whole cultures\nare doing something there's some kind of\nevolutionary Advantage but generally\nspeaking what we want to do is like mix\nour as much as possible with like\nforeign people because that's when you\nget positive dominant traits from\neverybody else y y yep I'm I don't you\ndon't need to worry I'm not going to be\ndoing this anyway okay I mean yeah I'm\nit's your life bro and you do what you\nwant to do y no no no it's like that's\nnot my type like to do stuff like that\nwith my cousins but um yeah man I don't\nknow I don't know but it does make sense\na lot of what you said Dr Ken I really\ndo appreciate you a lot of us a lot of\nthe streamers do app we need people like\nyou you know like we don't have we well\nI'm not going to label myself as a\nstreamer but a lot of the streamers or\neven when I was a streamer we needed\npeople like you it's not it's just we\nwere just so hypnotized to our chat we\nwould believe whatever they would say we\nlike yep you're right I'm so sorry yep\nplease sorry but then when we talk to\nyou were like listen to you more and\ndon't listen to\nthem yeah I also made me like obviously\nI started learning that more often when\nI was working at doing a normal\njob so I mean Slicker I I honestly I I\nappreciate that and I think one thing\nthat I want to highlight is that I can't\ndo what I do without\nyou so this is what a lot of people miss\nright is it's not me it's us right and\nand like the reason we we do interviews\nlike this is because I I it's not even\nabout streamers it's like bro do you get\nhow many people out out there have\ngambling\naddictions well I know it and even the\npeople that because I pretended a lot\nyeah and and the problem is that we\ndon't you know when when people discover\nthat they're addicts or whatever like\nthere's someone who's going to be 18 19\nwho's watching this right now and\nthey're starting the path that you're on\nand the problem is when you were 18 or\n19 no one had done an interview like\nthis no one had talked to a gambling\naddict about what was your life like\nwhat was your story like it's\nembarrassing absolutely right and so\nwho's taken\nI mean here we are talking about\neverything we're talking about your life\nit's not it hasn't been like sunshine\nand rainbows right it's been like the\nworst parts of you and the parts of you\nthat hurt other people and got you\ncancelled and all this kind of I\nmean it takes balls to do that but when\nyou do this other people hear it it\nmakes it less Ian it makes it more okay\nto have a\nproblem we all I'll talk about\ndestigmatizing mental illness and\ndestigmatizing right I'm not saying\nyou're mentally ill or not mentally ill\nthat's for you and your therapist to\ndecide what I'm saying is that as we\nstruggle we have to have these\nconversations because when we have these\nconversations people realize oh maybe I\nhave a problem if anyone out there is\nlistening to this and is like oh\nthis sounds like me maybe you should go\nsee a therapist right go and get help\nand we heard from you how helpful it was\nand how you thought it was at\nthe beginning like that's incredibly\nvaluable too there are times when I feel\nlike therapy is a and I do\ntherapy there's times it is\nwe're pretending to do therapy instead\nof actually doing therapy but that's\nconversation for a different\nday so thank you for coming on and and I\nappreciate your appreciation I'll take\nit yeah no it's a blessing I appreciate\nyou so much thank you I was uh you know\nit was good meeting you as well in the\nthe stream Awards nice guy I swear to\nGod I kind of I was kind of drun though\nthat time uh yeah but I uh yeah I do\nrecord we talked for like less than five\nminutes\nright I think I was I think I was you\nknow the most immature way to say this I\nthink I was dick riding you a lot Dr K I\ndidn't I didn't perceive it that way I\nmean I I I I think you were just\nexpressing appreciation which like\nthat's not dick writing bro like that\nthat is one thing that needs to change\nright we can express appreciation a dude\ncan express another appreciation for\nanother dude without it being dick\nwriting true true true so everyone calls\nme a dick riter for my idol but yeah\nwho's your father who's your uh Role\nModels would you\nsay who are my role\nmodels you used to listen to Tupac Back\nin the Days uh I like\nchanges so you like the mainstream music\nyeah I I ain't I ain't I ain't cool like\nyou are man I'll be the first to admit\nit I'm not gonna say I'm cool but I mean\ndo you do you what what's up of do are\nyou into hip-hop or are you cuz you\ndon't give me that Vibe not to be rude\nyou just don't give me that Vibe of\nhipop I can't see like yo first off\nthe and the you know you look like\nthe sort of guy that's like you know got\nthat classical music on you know I I\ndon't care for I mean honestly dude I\nlisten to a lot of instrumental music um\nokay but I I also like video game music\nlike I'm no same same 100% yeah so like\nI I like uh you know like yeah I I\nlisten to videos your three music huh\nWitcher 3 uh I mean I liked Witcher 3\nbut I usually when I listen to it's like\nit's all over the place so I like a lot\nof Street Fighter 2\nremixes um Devil May Cry I haven't\nplayed Devil May Cry but Final\nFantasy I've never played that metal\ngear solid uh yeah I like some metal\ngear solid stuff there's a lot of really\ngood music there so I I usually listen\nto music that I I play but then I also\nlisten to a lot of like EDM kind of\nstuff\nrecently EDM the heavy Dr music yeah it\nit it's making it's it's making me\nreally wonder about doing drugs and now\nI'm like wondering like should I go to\nlike some Festival in Europe and and you\nknow Dr I'm here for you I'm here for\nyou you can get a call I can help you\nout you can explain it to me I got you\nDr\nk um so so yeah I mean but I I listen to\na lot of stuff that has a little bit of\na beat but not a whole lot of\nwords and it helps me like write and\nstuff right um but then I I've also\nstarted to appreciate I mean silence\ntoo like I like\nsilence which I think fits with what you\nyour impression of me is which is I'm\nI'm not you know listening to Hip Hop\nvery often and stuff like that but you\nknow I it's interesting I've started to\ndiscover a little bit more uh I think\nalso since like having kids and stuff\nlike because I think they listen to\nmusic and how many kids I have two\nkids yeah man that's some I wish I could\nhave you know being a responsible father\nor something be nice you know I mean but\nlike also this is another thing imagine\nmy kids I have kids Daddy what do you to\ndo uh nothing hey Daddy you scam this\nmuch you know what I'm saying like you\ndon't I can't be a father like that of\ncourse you\ncan why not I don't know that's not sort\nof Father you would want you don't want\na kid to have a father like that you\nknow a\ncriminal see I'll see no I'll see I'll\nsee what you try to yeah I mean so so\nlike so look no father's going to be\nperfect right and I\nmean I think that I think your kids may\nbe better off than many other kids so if\nyou've got an active addiction while\nyou're raising kids that's certainly bad\nfor the kids yeah oh there's no question\nabout that but I would say that if\nyou're someone who's in\nrecovery like having a dad who knows\nwhat addiction is is probably a pretty\nbig Advantage for your kids to be able\nto teach them about hey like this is\nwhat happened to me and make sure you\nand I am going to teach you and prepare\nfor a world that is becoming more\naddictive where there are more designer\ndrugs coming out where video games are\ngetting more addictive gambling sites\nare becoming\nmore\naccessible where we are breeding strains\nof marijana that have higher THC\nconcentrations y right the world that\nwe're that your kids are growing in like\nif we're talking about character\ncreation here and having a dad who's a\nformer addict like that could help them\na lot I mean I was addicted to\nvideo games and I think it helps my kids\na lot in terms of the way that I teach\nthem about video games and Technology I\nmean I like literally wrote a book\nabout it and and like you know someone's\nchosen to publish it that's crazy and I\nwouldn't I wouldn't have been able to\nwrite that book unless I struggled\nmyself with addiction and my parents\ntried everything and they just didn't\nknow what they were dealing with because\ntechnology is different see here's the\nthing you got to understand about it's\nhard for parents\nnow so used to be that you had to worry\nabout addiction when your kid hit\nteenage years right that's when you're\nlike you start talking to them about oh\nlike alcohol is Haram beta no no alcohol\nright but now I mean kids are getting\naddicted at 2 years old 3 years you walk\nyou go to the grocery store you just\nwalk around you'll see like half the\nkids in the grocery store are going to\nbe sitting in the cart on on their\nparents' phone y y and I I don't know I\nmean I I would I would say Slicker I I\nget what you're saying that you would\nwhat I'm hearing is that you actually\nfeel like ashamed that your dad used to\nbe a\ncriminal but I mean so like if you had\nkids right so you're like man like I\ndon't like you know that's\npathetic like to have a dad who's a\ncriminal but I I\nyou are who you\nare and hopefully you I can do the thing\nis it's true because I could do what and\nprevent them from doing it like I'm not\ngoing to blame my dad I'd never my dad\nwas you know the best father I could\never ask for and that's what they're\ngoing to think about you too yeah and\nlike you know I could be like the one\nthat would be money managing well but\nthey can I could be like money managing\nthem and wait me money managing I\nthought yeah I have to call my sister or\nsomething manage their money but I mean\nlike you know I could prevent them from\ndoing what I did I mean I would hope so\nthat's what we try to do as parents\nright we try to we try to help our\nchildren make different mistakes from\nthe ones that we made oh yep yep\nlike nowadays is easy to access gambling\nyou know even need verific well do you\nthink it's all right for gambling sites\nto be available or do you think it\nshould be\nillegal um\nI think we\nuse\nlaws to try to Band-Aid a lot of more\nfundamental problems in our society so\nlike the approach I've taken I don't\nknow whether they should be legal or not\nlegal uh but I think that the basic\nproblem that we have with gambling sites\nisn't whether they're legal or not legal\nit's that we have not trained people to\nunderstand how their mind works that's a\nfar bigger problem in my opinion right\nright so every child should learn\nemotional awareness\nempathy understanding where your desires\nare coming from what an addict's mind\nlooks like yeah no and literally what\nchanged with me I was the same\nkid who failed out of school and was 10\nyears later was teaching not 10 maybe\nlonger but you know was teaching at\nHarvard Medical School same kid the only\ndifference is someone taught me c only\ndifference is someone taught me how my\nmind works how do you get into hover\nthen you used to like it took a long\ntime Harv's the best right in the\nworld I think it depends on what you're\ntalking about but I I think there's a\nlot of places give Harvard a run for\ntheir money for sure right I thought it\nwas awesome I think it's a great place\nit's a wonderful institution to learn at\nI had a very positive experience but is\nit the best I don't know I didn't you\nknow I didn't go to other places so I\ncan't compare yeah that's the difference\nis just understanding how your mind\nworks yeah I\nmean no you're right I just want to I\njust I skipped school me I'm I'm not\nproud but you know like I I just didn't\nsee myself in it was too hard I did\nGraphics design yeah I did Graphics\ndesign and it was just even when I went\ninto like applying for the job I mean\nthe for University like are you sure you\nwant to do this I was like why they like\nbecause getting a job out of this is not\neasy I'm like what the hell are you not\ntrying to get me in or something yeah\nand I I think that's the challenge right\nis you probably the reason you did\nGraphics design is because it sounds\nlike you had undertreated ADHD in school\nand you couldn't do you couldn't do\nschool the way that normal kids can do\nschool neurotypical kids that's not your\nfault Y no right yeah no I think the\nonly the only thing that's really\ngetting in the way of you having being a\ngood father is you got to stop riding my\ndick man that's not going to get your\nkids no no I mean if I do have kids I'll\njust make sure they like educate\nthemselves on Tupac and stuff you know\nat the age of three\ngreat I mean I I think he's a he's a\nhe's a force for a reason I mean Tupac\nis who he is for a reason 100% 100% he\nuh I love him to I love him to bits I\nswear to God\nI I don't even want to say that but say\nif like for example say if your kids\nbecame a pro like was grind in a lot of\ngames would you would you be okay with\nthat it would depend\nokay so so now nowadays you can see it's\neasy to make money off the internet and\na living from the internet but would you\nwant them to be in that life because\nthere's a lot of toxicity in that life\nyeah so so that's where like I it's I I\ndon't accept that the life is fixed\nright so I think the way that you\nprepare someone to live that life it\ndetermines whether they can handle the\ntoxicity or not so I want them to do\nwhatever they want to do and I view my\njob is preparing them to be able to do\nit in the healthiest way\npossible right so if they said hey I\nwant to become a pro gamer I would say\nokay fine but we're not going to let you\nbecome a\ndegenerate okay right so like if they\nwere you know so like you still have to\nwake up every day and you have to like\neat healthy food and stuff like that the\ninteresting thing is if you really want\nto be a Pro Gamer and even I don't know\nabout streamers but I think what we also\nknow is like taking care of your health\nand your mental Wellness like with\nstreaming as well and pro gaming\nactually correlates with better success\nthis idea of like a degenerate streamer\nor degenerate gamer I think is like\nthat's\ndecreasing so we I mean we found that\nwhen you support we've had a sample size\nof about 400 now so when we work with\nwe've worked with 400 streamers and\nhelping them with their mental and like\nhelping them with their motivation and\nkind of like eating healthy and sleeping\non time and like that that actually\ninrees their like follower count sub\ncount view count by\n171% being a\ndegenerate the internet may love you for\nit but long term it's not a good\nstrategy not a good y true\ntrue anyway any last thoughts or\nquestions Slicker before we wrap up for\nthe\nday um no the thing is you know what it\nis when you want to think and you really\nhave that thing inside your head you\njust can't remember it but you just yeah\nthat's me I have something always in my\nhead and it just I don't I just can't\nremember it I feel like whenever you ask\nme questions I feel like I'm being\nchallenged it's like your police asking\nme questions I'm like I'm sorry I don't\nI don't remember you know so I'm panic\nand Russian so I can't know that's okay\nI'm sorry for making you feel that way\nand I think that that too is not your\nfault that that's something that\nactually so this is important Slicker\nthat happens a lot with kids with\nADHD so what happens when you have a kid\nwith ADHD is when you're in a classroom\nand your teacher asks you a question you\nhaven't been paying\nattention and you get punished for it\nyeah so your brain Associates tells you\nyou learn this lesson this is really sad\nactually that getting asked a question\nmeans we're in\ndanger that's your response it's\nbeautiful that you're self-aware enough\nto recognize that very few people will\ndiscover that yeah yeah I've always\nnoticed that it's\n right we getting called on is\nthe most terrifying thing in the world\nand here I am asking you questions\nyou're like oh and that's because\nit's baked in when you were 6 years old\nand S years old in school your teacher\nwould call on\nyou yeah and then everyone in the\nclassroom would laugh because you\nweren't paying attention or you'd get\npunished or the teacher would shake\ntheir head or your parents would ask you\nquestions and you wouldn't be paying\nattention and then the\nbamboo\nyep life of ADHD yep\nit's tough I appreciate you though I\nappreciate you man thank you man thank\nyou so much I appreciate you coming on\ntoday and sharing your\nstory um you know I'm sorry that you've\nhad such a rough go of it but honestly\nI'm optimistic for you man I I have a\nfeeling I'm hopeful I can't see the\nfuture but I'm hopeful that in a year or\ntwo you're going to be I hope you'll be\nvery happy with where you are and\nhopefully you'll be in a\nrelationship yeah well maybe I get a\ndream another $1 or something who knows\nwell n no no no but seriously give give\npeople the one piece of advice if I can\ngive that is give people the chance to\nreject you don't do it for them oh I've\nbeen rejected a lot of times good so far\nyeah and I mean it helps a lot but yeah\nI'll uh I'll take that to know a lot of\nthings you said as well definitely like\nit made a lot of sense you know I'm\nsurprised don't really listen in class\nit was a bit hard when you was writing\nthat stuff down because it was like I\nwas in class again but you know it\neventually CED to me and it made a lot\nof sense you\nknow but yeah I appreciate you though\nthank you so much likewise take care my\nfriend and good luck with everything\nthank you so much take it easy take care\nman bye bye bye\nbye all right so we're going to talk\nabout this for just a hot second before\nwe wrap up for the day so this is\nimportant see when we lose\nconfidence we save people the trouble of\nrejecting\nUs by rejecting\nourselves we think to ourselves oh this\nperson would never want to hang out with\nme this person would never want to date\nme so I'm not going to bother now why do\nwe do this it's not because we're idiots\nit's to protect ourselves right because\nwhere did we learn that people reject us\nbecause people reject us so we get stuck\nit's really terrible we get stuck\nbecause we've tried to connect with\npeople and we get\nrejected and then we feel bad about\nourselves and then we see this version\nof ourselves who is a reject and once we\nstart thinking of ourselves as a reject\nwe do the work for them we're going to\nskip that step where they reject us\nwe're going to skip it because I'm a\nreject it's\nfixed so one of the biggest things that\nyou can do for yourself for your\nconfidence and for your relationships is\nto give people the chance to reject you\nshare share who you\nare and will it hurt absolutely but then\nwe get stuck cuz we have a choice\nbetween a coin flip of them rejecting us\nor not rejecting us or US taking the\ndecision away from them and pre-\nrejecting ourselves all the time so you\nhave a less than 100% chance of\nrejection if you give someone else the\noption but if you're running the show\nThe Chance is going to be\n100% pre- rejected it's not a\npre-approval for a a loone it's a pre\npre rejection for a\nrelationship and that pre- rejection is\n100% CU you're the one doing\nit really tricky now I'm not saying it's\neasy because the other thing about\nrejecting ourselves is we're good at it\nwe're a little bit Kinder right we give\nourselves a pat on the back oh you're\nlike you're a loser but\nlike you do it with compassion towards\nyourselves hopefully but when someone\nelse does it it hurts\nmore right because we open ourselves up\nto being accepted and oh my God it\nhurts so be careful about\nthat right give other people the chance\nto accept or reject you which is the\nscariest thing I'm not saying it's easy\nrequires a lot of fortitude and the\nreason that we don't have the fortitude\nis because we've been rejected already\nand now we let confidence in in\nourselves so then the world becomes a\ndangerous place and then it's hard to\ngive people the\noption y'all get\nthis so the other problem that we run\ninto when we don't let people reject us\nis we become manipulative and we create\nrelationships that are doomed to fail\nwhat do I mean by\nthis so if I don't don't want to give\nsomeone the chance to reject me what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm going to hide\nsomething right oh yeah that's not\nreally me or I'm not going to share this\nlittle tidbit because if I share this\nthey could reject me they may like it\nthey may not like\nit but then what happens is you create a\nrelationship that's based on a\nlie and then what happens is now like\nyou've got to cover this thing up and\nthey can never find out and you're\nplaying this game that if they if I can\nforce\nthem or trick them into investing a lot\ninto the relationship when they\neventually find out there's so much in\nthe relationship already that I'll be\nable to write it out not a good\nstrategy give them the choice to reject\nyou I know it's hard but your\nrelationship will actually be healthier\ninstead what's going to happen is you'll\nbuild something up for a while and then\nthey're going to feel betrayed\nso now there is a possibility of\nrejection and there is a guarantee of\nbetrayal so I know it's I know it's\nhard but you got to give people the\nchance to reject you because that's\nwhere like respect comes\nfrom you got that it's\nhard yeah so someone's you miss 100% of\nthe shots you don't take Wayne Gretzky\nand Michael Scott beautiful I think it's\na beautiful quote but what people don't\nadd is\nthat a missed shot hurts a lot more than\na shot not\ntaken right the individual shot that you\ntake when you get rejected hurts more\nthan not taking the shot at all the\nproblem is that\novertime getting rejected 50 times or\nnot taking a shot a 100 times you're\ngoing to be worse off if you never take\na chance\nbut in an individual moment to moment\nit's harder to take a chance that's why\nwe don't do it right so like if you kind\nof think about it oh I've I've never\nI've never dated anyone and I'm 25 years\nold how did we get in this situation we\ngot in this situation not because you're\nstupid or anything like that we got in\nthis situation because every opportunity\nyou\nhad it would hurt more to take a chance\nthan to not take a chance and so one\nyear went by two years went went by 3\nyears went by and now you find yourself\nhaving never taken a chance or maybe you\ntook a couple got rejected and now the\nfive years and no relationship hurts\nmore than any individual chance this is\nthe\nproblem but on any given day very easy\nit's the right move to say not today\nit's the right move to say I don't want\nto take a\nchance don't get too personal the only\nreal failure is the failure to try\nthat's beautiful\ntoo but that's not\ntrue right I'm not trying to disagree\nwith this person but like let's be\nhonest trying and failing still hurts a\nton I'm with you in sentiment I think\nthat's the right place to end up smile\nand wave like I love these comments\nbecause you're right and we should get\nthere but let's acknowledge that\nthe try and fail is also a failure and\nalso hurts and sometimes the weird thing\nis can hurt even\nmore cuz what hurts more half assing it\nand failing or full assing it and\nfailing I gave everything I gave 100% I\ngave 110% I gave one year of my life\nfive years of my life and to get\nrejected or fail then hurts way\nmore\nand since it hurts way more than half\nassing it we half ass it we half ass it\nto protect\nourselves from the hurt of full assing\nit and the real challenge there is that\nwhen we live a life like that we've shot\nourselves in the foot exactly what was\nsaid\nearlier It's\nTricky it's so when we're talking about\nexpending effort the thing to understand\nis it's the wrong move for the right\nstrategy over time but on any given day\nit's easier to not do things it's\nprotective to not do things it's\nprotective to have asset because then\nwhen you fail you've got some excuse\nright and if you've got an excuse you\ndon't have to feel bad about\nyourself I tried my hardest and I didn't\nwin that means that there is a better\nhuman being than me on the\nplanet\nversus I half asked\nit and then if I don't lose at least I\nhave this refuge in my mind if I had put\nforth a 100% effort then I could have\nwon and you can beat yourself up about\nthat but at least you you didn't give\n100% lose to give 100% lose is the worst\nfeeling in the\nworld because that's when you really\nrealize you've got good evidence that\nyou're\ninsufficient it's not enough even if you\ngave it your\nall\num uh Lucas asking don't you think that\nthere are points where you should weigh\nyour options though and not put all your\neggs in one basket because then\nindirectly the rejection will hurt long\nterm I don't quite follow the question\nbut the answer is undoubtedly whatever\nyou think I'm\nserious so I I don't think it's like all\nyour eggs in one basket and and yeah I\nmean you should be more nuanced about it\nfor sure it's kind of what I'm reading\nfrom the question\nyeah half-assing is a protection\nmechanism you're yeah that's the one\nthat screwed my life so hard for so many\nyears okay what happens if I spend my\nentire life trying and failing I want to\ndo things but I know I can't do them as\nwell as other people or even I would\nlike\nto great question so\nthis question the answer is in the\nquestion\nitself what happens if I spend my entire\nlife so already we're we've divorced\nourselves from reality we've entered the\nrealm of hypothetical and you've already\nsaid my entire life this is what the\nMind does we got to be careful because\nyou can't spend your whole life trying\nand failing I mean I guess theoretically\nyou could but that's not the actual\nsituation second thing to understand I\ndon't know if that made sense but I want\nto do things but I know I can't do\nthem hold on a second how do you know\nthat you can't do it well I haven't done\nit before I've tried before and I failed\nI can't do something is different from\nI've tried consistently and I failed in\nthe\npast right so I'm not saying that you\ncan do anything that you put your mind\nto I think that's ridiculous but I think\nthere's some wiggle room\nbetween trying your whole life and\nfailing which is like on the black end\nof the spectrum and on the white end of\nthe spectrum is you can put anything\nyou can do anything that you put your\nmind to the problem in this scenario is\nthat it's black and\nwhite and I think both of them are wrong\nthe right question is the next time you\ntry what can you do to increase your\nchances of success that's the question\nyou should be\nasking any question that starts with\nwhat if what if I do this and this\nhappens you are trying to solve for a\nproblem that literally does not\nexist that's what makes it a\nhypothetical\nfocus on the problem that does exist\nsolve that one first and then worry\nabout tomorrow\ntomorrow right and there's a good reason\nthat our brain thinks about hypothetical\nI'm not saying ignore all hypotheticals\nbut when it comes to your life think a\nlittle bit about where is the balance of\nyour thinking do you spend more time\ntrying to solve the hypothetical\nproblems of tomorrow or more try time\ntrying to solve the problems of today I\nthink the real mistake that a lot of\npeople make is they spend 51 plus per\nsolving hypothetical\nproblems or not even hypothetical\nproblems the other 40% is problems from\nthe past that I can do nothing about man\nthat guy made fun of me in the locker\nroom I'm going to spend a couple days\nthinking about what the right comeback\nwould have been and I'm going to own\nthem if only I had done this we spent\nall of our time solving hypothetical\nproblems in the past and rewriting\nhistory retconning\nour way to Pride and\nconfidence instead of solving the\nproblems for\ntoday and I I don't say this to make fun\nof y'all this bro I did this too\nI did it for 10 years that's why I'm\nsaying\nit and then one day I was like you know\nwhat this is dumb I'm an idiot why don't\nI focus on what I can focus on\ntoday and that's the difference between\nsuccess and failure for me is focus on\nthe problems that you can solve instead\nof worrying about the ones that you\ncan't and I'm not saying ignore all\nthose you absolutely have to think about\nhypotheticals but like you know what can\nyou do today what can you do differently\nbecause that's the only thing you can\ndo and then when you start focusing on\nthat it may not work out right away in\nfact it's not going to work out right\naway I mean I was so stupid I applied I\ngot rejected from 119 medical schools\nbefore I got accepted to one\nright so I'm not saying that like oh if\nyou do this like three times the fourth\ntime you will\nsucceed no I'm telling you like you're\ngoing to get rejected a\nton like that's what's going to\nhappen I tried to date so many\npeople catastrophic failure after\ncatastrophic\nfailure it took a couple\nyears\n120 not 190\n119 right so it's not it's not close to\n200 but it's like that's that's what\nlife is and we get so caught up about\nlike what does work or what doesn't work\nor will it work or will it not work and\nlike this is what I don't know\nsomething's going on something weird is\ngoing on to our in our brains with like\ntechnology and how it's affecting the\nway that we see\nthings\nand you know I I don't know it's weird\nit's like this is a problem that\neveryone faces nowadays and I don't know\nwhy like I used to be the minority y'all\nget that like this kind of problem that\nI had which is has become every day for\npeople that's why the world is so hard\nlike something has become fundamentally\nharder I used to be the outlier and now\nit's the\nnorm so just take the plunge and adapt\non the Fly it's a great place to start\nright but even then like the attitude\nthe plunge why are you using why are you\nsaying just give it a shot right think\nabout it a little bit and then give it a\nshot that's what I would say and then\niterate same thing but do you all see\nthe attitude difference just take the\nplunge and adapt on the Fly that's the\nway you need to conceptualize it go for\nit another way to think about it is\nthink think about it a little bit and\nfigure out what you're going to do\nwithin the next hour and give that a\nshot and learn from it same\nthing\nso keep going full speed like David\ngogin if you're David gogins go for\nit right so I ain't no David goggin so\nI'm gonna say keep going but take breaks\nand you can reduce your speed from time\nto time give it 100% when you can but if\nyou can't don't stop that's the only\nthing take a break fine but don't stop\nand then if you guys are if y'all are as\nmiraculous as David goggin then by all\nmeans if you can go Full Speed Ahead of\n100% of the time I think it's great go\nfor\nit okay so bopy the fox is asking how\ndoes one ease themselves of the anxiety\nof just trying this is another problem\nthat has started to happen in our\nsociety we try to ease ourselves of\nnegative\nemotions the real answer if you really\nwant to conquer just do\nit it's that you have to accept that\nanxiety is going to\nhappen so I want to think about this\neveryone nowadays and this is happening\nincreasingly more and more and more we\nare\nOutsourcing the control of our negative\nemotions to the external\nenvironment so we are saying things like\nthis thing this thing that this person\nsaid hurts my feelings therefore they\nneed to stop and this can include\neverything from hate speech which I\nthink is pretty reasonable to this\nperson lost weight and looks better than\nI do and showed up to my party and\nis upstaging me in front of my friends\ntherefore they need to be uglier so\nreasonable things and unreasonable\nthings in my\nopinion but the one thing that's\ncertainly happening is that we are\nOutsourcing the responsibility of our\nemotional state to other people in the\nworst cases we also do this in\nPsychiatry where we will sometimes at\nproblems away right we're not going to\nfix this we're going to numb it which\ncan sometimes be useful by the way\nbecause you can't fix everything all the\ntime sometimes the body and brain need\nnumbness to get through a couple cycles\nof rotation of the earth so that you\nhave enough energy to actually fix a\nproblem but I think the real answer if\nyou really want to control your life\njust be able to accept negativity don't\nease the anxiety the anxiety is there\nit's going to be there it doesn't have\nto control me what is anxiety it's worry\nit's uncomfortable up here it's\nuncomfortable in here sometimes it can\nbe dangerous but almost never right\nthere are cases where anxiety can be\nlife-threatening but usually it's just\ndiscomfort and so imagine what your life\nis like what would your life be like you\neveryone's talking about how do I fix my\nanxiety what would your life be like if\nyou didn't need to fix it if you could\nact in spite of your\nanxiety\nso that I think is the real if you guys\nwant like a Magic Bullet to make your to\ntransform your life that's it it's the\nability to embrace or at least not run\naway from negative emotional\nexperiences if you can do that\neverything\nchanges okay you started talking about\nthe six neurological deficits in\naddicted people but only covered one one\nof them what are the other five what a\ngreat question um I will do a lecture on\nthat working on it actually but let me\nsee if I can pull something for y'all in\nthe short\nterm let's\n[Music]\nsee\nI think this is the\none\nGH hold on\nchat\nyeah\nokay let me see if I got this\nokay hold\non I don't know if this has it 100% but\nwe'll give it a\nshot all right\nso this is mindfulness training for\nsubstance use disorder clinical staff at\nmlan\nhospital is this the right\n[Music]\none\nokay\nso this doesn't have it 100% but this is\nsort of an answer and I'll give youall a\nbetter answer okay so there's a couple\nof different these are the deficits here\non the outside so the first thing that\nwe talked about is increases awareness\nof internal State and Cravings so the\nproblem with a lot of people who have\naddictions is that they don't know when\nthey're craving something the craving is\nthere and builds and builds and builds\nbut you're blind to it and since you're\nnot aware of your craving until it\nbecomes overwhelming that's when you\ncrack because if you realize that the\ncraving is developing then you can\nactually like get rid of it while it's\nsmall okay so a lack of in awareness of\nyour internal emotional\nstate second problem that people have is\nthe ability for them to regulate their\nnegative emotions once they arise so we\nknow that people with ADD\nhave a reduced cortical inhibition of\nthe limic system so the limic system is\nwhere we experience emotions the amydala\nthe uh hippocampus partially and we know\nthat our frontal loes normally regulate\nthat right so when I'm feeling emotional\nlet's say I get angry there's a part of\nmy brain that's like okay calm down\ncontrol yourself in this moment that\ncontrol that ability to control yourself\nby yourself what is the you and what is\nthe yourself what does it mean when you\ncontrol yourself that means that your\nfrontal loes their capacity to\ncontrol your limic system okay that's a\nsecond\ndeficit\num second thing is that the ability to\ntolerate negativity is worse in people\nwith\naddictions so when I feel bad do I need\nto fix the\nproblem and what we find in people with\naddictions is that their ability to\ntolerate feeling bad is worse than\nsomeone who's not suffering from an\naddiction now this doesn't mean that\nthey're weak because we also know that\nthe negative experience that they have\nis objectively worse than someone\nwithout an addiction so for example\npeople who are vulnerable to addictions\nliterally feel more pain than someone\nwho doesn't and their ability to\ntolerate pain is lower so we have to\nlearn how to tolerate pain suppress\nemotions control emotions become\ninternally aware of cravings and then\nthere's also just basic executive\nfunction which is the ability to set\nyour mind to something and execute on it\nso reduced empathy is another one and\nI'm blanking on number six so I will\ngive yall a better answer I just need to\nrevisit some of that research actually\ngive me a second let me see if I\nhave oh here we\ngo oh\nboy\nyeah yeah I'll I'll put something\nbetter I'll put something together that\nis better that's the closest thing I've\ngot right\nnow\num Omar Omar is saying first time seeing\nDr K live welcome my\nfriend can we see this resource in our\nDiscord resources bro that's a poster I\nput together when I was like at mlan\nhospital like five years ago I don't\nknow that it's worth\nseeing but I will give you this for\nsure um so if somebody wants to if you\nguys want a better resource than this\nthere was actually a great post on our\nsubreddit recently that like Dr K you\ntalk about all the sence but you never\ncite sources which you are right I do\nnot it's just there's a procedural\nproblem we have which we're trying to\nfix and thank you for reminding us that\nwe need to do that but here's references\nif anybody wants to take a screenshot um\nthis is an awesome paper by the way so\nretraining the brain a review of\nhypothesized neurobiological mechanisms\nis great where is\nuh these\nsorry oh\n okay um these are the two\nreferences that yall should check\nout I mean this one's pretty good too\nbut it's not uh these are the two that\nare good okay so to the person if if\nyou're here and you're watching there's\nmy reference for what I just said\nthey're always at my fingertips it's\njust we got to get to them\num any tips for embracing negative\nemotions what a great question let you\nthink about\nthis all\nright so everyone's talking about\nembracing your negative emotions or\nsitting with your negative emotions what\nthe hell does that mean what does it\nmean to sit with or embrace your\nnegative emotions so I know I know it\nsounds kind of crazy but that's exactly\nwhat it means so here's the problem when\nwe experience emotions we tend to deal\nwith them okay so\nthere's an interesting study that showed\nthat emotion focused\ncoping results in poor outcomes in life\nokay and I will pull up a reference at\nthe end because I I know where this\npaper is so what does that mean that\nmeans that when I have when I feel bad\nif I cope by making myself feel better I\nwill actually do worse in life so let's\nsay I feel bad I feel anxious let me\nhave a beers to calm myself\ndown I feel sad let me play a video game\nto cheer myself up so if the focus of my\ncoping is to alter my internal emotional\nstate I'm feeling angry and frustrated\nwith my life let me go yell at my\nyounger sister to make myself feel\nbetter or y'all may have parents who did\nthis and you may have noticed that when\nyour parent is having a bad day the way\nthat they make themselves feel better is\nby making your day worse this is called\nemotion focused coping and what it means\nis literally acting in some kind of way\nthat makes the emotion feel better to\nembrace or sit with the\nemotion the tip is first of all to do\nabsolutely nothing what you are doing is\nnot doing anything take no\naction\nnone and literally what you can do is\nsit go and find a nice place to sit and\nsit down and close your eyes and let\nwhatever is there just be\nthere you may find that when you do this\nwhatever the emotion is\nintensifies Let It Come tears can start\nto come come you can start to feel very\nangry your breathing will change and you\nare just going to sit the only thing you\nare going to do is nothing this is\nsomething that y'all should be\nexperts at by\nnow right this is our audience this\nisn't the normal people who are out\nthere winning Nobel prizes this is us\nwe're good at doing nothing don't\ndistract yourself just sit and do\nnothing now here's the beautiful\nthing our brain has this capacity for\nsomething called\nhomeostasis which means that no emotions\nlast\nforever\nliterally right my favorite example of\nthis is happiness from a wedding\nday I have seen so many people start\ndivorce proceedings based on what\nhappened on their wedding\nday because they want the perfect\nmarriage and the perfect they want\nforget it sorry not the perfect marriage\nwhat they want is the perfect wedding\nday and they think if I have a perfect\nwedding day then I will have a perfect\nmarriage and since I have less than a\nperfect wedding day I will have an\nimperfect\nmarriage but here's the problem with a\nwedding\nday the happiness from it does not last\nforever because our mind comes to\nhomeostasis this is why we play video\ngames and eat cookies every day because\nthe happiness of the Cookie doesn't last\nforever it goes\naway so here's the cool thing negative\nemotions go away too\nnow you may say but Dr K hold on a\nsecond when I sit down and I\nstart I sit with my negative emotions\nthings get\nworse my mind starts looping the anxiety\nintensifies so now we get to a advanced\ntechnique for sitting with your emotions\nwhich is that mental engagement is an\naction this is something that Western\nSciences just on the cusp of but yogis\nfigured out a long time ago to sit with\nan emotion is not to engage with it and\nthis is what I mean so if you sit with a\nnegative emotion you'll notice that your\nmind wants to like circle jerk you into\na bad place this means this and this\nmeans this I'm feeling sad I got\nrejected today this means I'm going to\nbe rejected forever these people don't\nlike me these people don't like me these\npeople don't like me these people don't\nlike me that is not sitting with the\nemotion that is actually an action of\nthought it is a mental\naction and if you circle jerk your your\nway into thinking in this line observe\nyour thoughts and notice how much your\nmind wants to engage with it it wants to\nthink about what next what next what\nnext what next and with each of those\nthoughts comes a strengthening of the\nemotion and then we're left with no\nchoice but to use emotion Focus coping\nwe have to break the\ncycle so notice don't think just feel\nfeel feel feel feel feel do not think if\nthoughts come let them come and let them\ngo but don't engage with them don't\nfollow them don't challenge them don't\nencourage them don't do any of that\nstuff and that's why we use the\nbody so the second thing to understand\nthird thing whatever whatever number\nwe're on about how to sit with your\nemotions is literally sit with them\nwatch them let them be there oh feel\nwhat you feel in your body use your body\nas a grounding technique to get away\nfrom your\nmind if you want to breathe you can do\nthat but just feel okay where is the\nsadness in my body ask yourself this one\nquestion\nwhere is this emotion in my body where\ndo I feel it and whatever you feel you\ncan move in slightly the opposite\ndirection if you feel tension in your\nshoulders let your shoulders relax if\nyou're breathing shallowly let the\nbreathing be\ndeeper if you're hunched\nover\nexpand and this is how you start sitting\nwith your emotions and then something\nbeautiful will happen it's going to be\ncompletely op it sucks for a while and\nthen it starts to get better and then\nyou haven't done anything but it's\ngotten better on its\nown and now here's the\nproblem the problem with emotions is\nthat when we feel bad what we do to fix\nit screws us even more so when I'm\nfeeling sad about my day let me binge\nwatch something and now not only do I\nlose one hour to sadness I lose 5 hours\nto watching something and now 6 hours\nhave gone by and this sadness instead of\ncosting me one hour is costing me six\nhours this is why we get stuck in\nlife because the things that we do to\nsolve our problems create more\nproblems in the East they called this\nthe cycle of karma that no matter what\nyou do you get bound\nfurther any problem that you try to fix\ncreates more\nproblems and so the beautiful thing is\nthat the yogis of ancient India they\nwere us one of us us and they said do\nnothing they're so degenerate they're\nlike do\nnothing and but the thing is why doesn't\nthat work for us because they figured\nout that doing nothing means doing\nnothing up here as well you be\nempty-headed you need to be low MMR go\nback to the bronze tier embrace the\nbronze tier up\nhere stop being this foran amateur\nQuantum physicist\ngenius and be\nstupid do nothing\ndelay this will be this will be the\nthing that sets you\nfree oh yeah I think I've unlocked a new\nability by doing nothing I'm going to\ntell you all a\nstory the most important lesson that I\nlearned in medical school was do nothing\nthere are just as many problems that we\nhave in Medicine by doing too much as\ndoing too little even\nmore because the problem with medicine\nis that most of our treatments screw\nsomething up in some way so the real job\nof a doctor the real reason that like\nalgorithms may not be ideal is because\nyou want to do the minimum amount of\nwhatever you can do because\nfundamentally any kind of medicine that\nwe practice in the west is going to be\nworse off than your body\nso any basic thing like our ability to\ncontrol your blood pressure is not\nnearly as sophisticated as your body's\nability to control blood pressure hell\nthink about this for a second a lot of\nhuman beings will go the first 60 years\nof their life without a doctor touching\ntheir blood pressure and everything just\nworks this is how beautiful the body is\nso when I was on my surgery rotation I\nwas thinking about being a surgeon for a\nlittle while 5%\nchance so one of my one of the fellows\nof vas ular surgery fellows\nbrilliant told me that the first 10\nyears of being a surgeon all this was\nthe attending I think first 10 years of\nsurgery you learn when to operate and\nthe rest of your life is spent learning\nwhen not to operate how not to operate\nand that as a surgeon the worst thing\nthat you can do for a patient is to\noperate so you should only do it when\nyou absolutely need to because cutting\nsomeone open which we don't even do so\nmuch in surgery anymore is generally\nspeaking not a good\nidea so to do nothing is one of the most\nunderstated skills it's the whole Zen\ntradition is based on\nthis and if we sort of think about all\nthe problems in our life where do the\nproblems come from they come from doing\nsomething not doing nothing and people\nsay oh Dr K what are you talking about I\ndo nothing for the last five years I've\nbeen doing nothing\n you've been doing a lot of\nempty something that is is not doing\nnothing sitting on your ass and playing\nvideo games is not doing nothing it is\ndoing an empty\nsomething so we fill up our days with\nempty something rather than do\nnothing for those of you that say that\nyou've done nothing I challenge you to\nactually do nothing you won't be able\nto we had a brilliant exercise that we\ndid in our community a couple years ago\nstare at a wall for an hour that's it\none of the most transformative things\nfor like 5% of our community people\nstarted crying people felt really\nuncomfortable people had catharsis\npeople went insane just stare at a wall\nfor one hour no distractions just let\nyour mind run wild one of the most\npowerful things you can\ndo when I do nothing I start launching\ninto Daydreams you're damn right you do\nbut let's understand this even better\nyou don't launch into Daydreams your\nmind starts daydreaming why because your\nmind doesn't know how to tolerate\nnothing so remember when we talked about\nemotion focused coping and how people\nwho try to control when their coping\nstrategy is to alter their internal\nemotional state these people do poorly\nin\nlife so there is one beautiful way to\nalter your internal emotional state that\nrequires nothing externally which is to\ndaydream\nbecause when I daydream ah I'm exploring\nthe\nuniverse I'm living a beautiful\nlife right so don't engage with those\nthoughts stare at the wall let the dayam\nDaydream go it'll take practice it'll be\nhard if you're someone who's got\nmaladaptive daydreaming it's going to be\ntough uphill battle for\nyou but same thing daydreaming is\nemotion focused coping like literally\nwe've got papers about this now since\nwe're working on\nreferences let me pull those up real\nquick I said I I have two references to\nshow youall\nright let's pull them\nup give me a\nsecond um so this one\nis oh\nI have to find it chat hold\non no I want all of them yes open 18\ntabs don't think it's this\none\nyes\nh hold on\nchat don't\nleave Hold\nOn\nEmotion damn\nit I'm not able to find\nit ah can't find this paper okay I I'll\nI'll find it and show it to youall what\nwas the other one I wanted to show you\none thing was about emotion focused\ncoping so oh no no here it is here it\nis can you all read this\ndevelopment of maladaptive coping a\nfunctional adaptation to Chronic\nuncontrollable\nstress okay this is the reference so it\nis Mary E Wadsworth hold on now that I\nknow what I'm looking\nfor ha locked out printed a paper\nchat oh\n okay here's the paper this is the\none okay I just don't know if it's in\nthe public domain right have to use my\nlogin but um the origins of maladaptive\ncoping let me see\nokay\nuh so moreover while avoidance generally\npredicts poor\n[Music]\nfunctioning yeah this is the page that\nit's on but this is a this is a paper\nthat talks\nabout healthy and unhealthy coping\nskills so there's one reference what was\nthe other reference that we wanted\nno way you read all of\nthat that's funny Chad that's very\nfunny I read like two like yeah printers\nare still so that's the thing so I used\nto read things online and once I crossed\nlike 150 Pages a week I started printing\nsome stuff out so I'll read like I I\nprint out about 30% of papers that I\nread and I I'll print like 50 pages a\nweek um why not take a picture with the\niPad and screen share yeah we could do\nthat but I wanted to show youall one\nother reference oh a\ndaydreaming\nperfect well you guys know we did a\nwhole video about daydreaming where\nis\nthat we should add that there's a\nthere's a stuff about maladaptive\ndaydreaming and then we're going to wrap\nfor the day how come you print them\nbecause it's easier to\nread so there's also something else that\nyou all should be a little bit aware\nof so a growing number of\nopthalmologists that I know are getting\nconcerned about these oil glands in the\neyes that will essentially die out\nbecause people are not blinking often\nenough so when you play video games or\nlook at a screen the rate of your\nblinking actually goes down and if you\ndon't blink enough your eyes will dry\nout and the consequence of your eyes\ndrying out is actually that there's\nthese little oil producing glands in\nyour eyes that will actually stop\nfunctioning and so there's a growing\nnumber of people who like require eye\ndrops and stuff and external lubricants\nbecause this is happening it all has to\ndo with your blinking rate so I try to\nminimize my screen time even when it\ncomes to things like reading so um I\ndon't I don't we don't know a whole lot\nof data on like what really causes this\nor how bad it is or I don't know that\nbut these are friends of mine who are\nopthalmologists when I talk to them\nabout hey I'm working on like video game\naddiction these are friends from med\nschool you like see them after 10 years\nand you're like hey what are you up to\nnowadays and I'll be like Oh I'm doing\nthis stuff on video game addiction and\nthey're like oh I've seen this problem\nrecently I've heard it from like two or\nthree people so blink chat when you play\ngames Dr K I think we need a Discord\ntutorial for the HG Community the server\nis huge you are right we've also heard\nthat from our Discord people so we have\na lot of Discord leads that were telling\nus that we need to like Orient yall to\nour\nDiscord um because there's the dude the\nDiscord is epic like it's so good\nthere's like people who do Fitness stuff\nso one of the fitness leads I was\ntalking to a couple of the fitness leads\nand one of the fitness leads was like I\nwas like how do you you know what kind\nof workout stuff do you do and he's like\nhonestly it's mostly\nmental and he's like most of what I do\nis like encourage people and help them\nfeel good about themselves so that they\ncan start working out and I was like\nholy dude that's so epic see we\ndon't understand this but I have a hot\ntake you guys want a hot take about\nmedicine half the diseases that we have\nare mental in\nnature obesity\ndiabetes these things have a huge mental\ncomponent and if we can change people's\nbehavior we can fix those things so we\nhave like type two diabetes for example\nis like quite fixable for many people\nwith behavioral change and where does\nbehavioral change happen it starts in\nthe mind so the problem is that we have\nan industry that\ndoes not\nreward helping people become\nhealthy so we don't do\nthat who can blink manually while doing\nanything I don't know can you blink\nmanually it's hard that's not a hot take\nokay um all right y'all so we've been\nstreaming for 3 hours and 15 minutes I\nmissed y'all that's why I stayed so long\nbut I have stuff to write and things to\ndo and I have a lot of stuff that I need\nto get working on and I encourage yall\nto work I'm going to be working all\nweekend I think y'all should too don't\nprocrastinate work hard\nchat do your nothing very mindfully and\nthen when time comes get your asses up\nand do some\nwork\num so ventti is saying I'm morbidly\nobese I'm only myself to blame I\nrespectfully disagree so if you all took\none thing away from Slickers talk today\nrecognize that if you suck at something\nin life you're not the only one to\nblame this is very important to\nunderstand because most of what we do\nespecially if we look at something like\nobesity seriously it's not your fault\nit's your\nresponsibility who eats\nhealthy people who are taught to eat\nhealthy that's\nit right and you can teach\nyourself question number two what's way\neasier someone else teaching you\nsomething or teaching yourself cut\nyourself some\nslack recognize that 90% of your food\nbehaviors are based on the upbringing\nthat you had this is what became\nhabitual for you this is the way that\nyour neurons were wired this is the way\nthat you're\nconditioned so it's an uphill battle and\nyou can change\nit the problem is a medical industry we\ndon't support you in that\nthat's not our first choice right what's\nour first choice nowadays\nOIC because it works well and hey you\ndon't have to do anything up here you\ncan just take\nOIC not brought to you or sponsored by\nOIC it's just I've heard really good\nthings about the medication I don't do\nweight management or anything like\nthat right and so cut yourself a little\nbit of slack and recognize that here as\na community we are here to support you\nand that just starts with an awareness\nthat starts with a little bit of self\nforgiveness and then it also starts with\nwhat are you going to do\ntoday right so if you're morbidly obese\nand you're listening to\nthis what are you going to do\ntoday you don't have to fix everything\noh my God I'm not going to be able to\neat like this for the rest of my life\ndon't eat like this for the rest just\ntoday do something today then tomorrow\ndo something today and then tomorrow do\nsomething today but it's never going to\nchange it's always going to be do a\nlittle bit today little bit tiny\nbit\nokay and that's what I'm saying is like\na lot of people like Slicker was like oh\nmy God like you're so good and I'm so\nbad no dude it's just I was given the\nright kind of guidance that's the\ndifference yall realize how lucky I am\nthat that's the only difference it's\nluck so he calls it Allah I call it\nkarma call it whatever you want to\nRNG we're all different we're given a\ndifferent hand of cards and it's just\nabout the way that you play them and you\nhave to play the hand of cards you're\ndealt there's no use worrying about what\nother people have in their\nhand apple a day is delish because it's\nthe\nseason will an apple a day keep the do K\naway\nprobably how how to start things you\nhave been procrastinating for months and\nhave almost given up on we have a great\nvideo about multiple kinds of\nprocrastination we also have have um so\nthat's on YouTube let me see if I can\nfind\nit\nuh hold on there's oh there's a new\nvideo on YouTube I watch your videos but\nnothing\nchanges that's great dude oh my God\nthat's so\nepic man I I love it when people post\nstuff on the subreddit about like hey\nthis is like what's going on by the way\nI read a lot of stuff on the subreddit\nokay it's like a lot of inspiration for\nvideos so if yall ask questions on there\nit's very helpful if you're like hey\nhere's my situation and if you give some\ndetail like I'm not saying I can respond\nto all of them right because we make at\nmost three videos a week but I read all\nof it not all of it actually that's not\ntrue I read a lot of it and I try my\nbest to like file everything away and\nI've got like all these different ideas\nI'll read papers and I'll be like okay\nlike this is paper is interesting and\nbut then if I've got a case or something\nit really helps a lot so thank you all\nvery much for participating in that way\num\nand hold\non so I would start with uh this uh oh\nyeah okay this is great how to stop\nprocrastinating four years ago okay\napparently I said something four years\nago about it how to stop procrastinating\nand finish projects two years ago yeah\nso mental health boot camp is the one\nthat I would recommend even though it\nhas the fewest views and is the most\nscuffed but apparently I said something\npretty damn good four years ago about\nit\nI don't I don't know I don't remember\nwhat I said but I said it back\nthen so check it\nout um is that a re-upload no I don't\nthink so they're different lengths but I\nthink the boot camp is the best but it's\nlike\nlonger which a lot of people don't have\nthe you know you got procrastinating D\nyou can't watch a 50-minute video on\nprocrastination what is the best way to\njoin the community join Discord\nthank you so much\nCrow much appreciated my\nfriend I meant to watch that video on\nprocrastination four years ago but I\nhaven't gotten to it that's why we made\na F minute one so literally we're here\nwe're holding your hand no matter what\nyou're doing we're here for\nyou and if a 50-minute video is too much\nto watch watch the one that's 5 minutes\nand 47\nseconds do you have have something on\nrepression not so much but maybe we'll\nmake\nsomething okay yall take care I'm going\nto head out otherwise my voice is going\nto be shot and then I won't be able to\nwork tomorrow\nso for those of you all that celebrate\nThanksgiving Happy Thanksgiving for\nthose of youall that don't celebrate\nThanksgiving Happy Friday and happy\nweekend and thank you all very much for\ncoming today by the way thank you very\nmuch for being respectful to Slicker I\nreally appreciate it um we heard\nfirsthand from the dude about how he is\nnot the best human being on the planet\nand so that's okay right that's what\nwe're here for we're here for all of\ny'all that are not the best human being\non the planet we're here for all of\ny'all that have screwed up in some way\nand want to do better that's who we're\ncommitted to so thank you very much for\ncoming today thank you very much for\nbeing here if y'all um you know yeah\nthat's it I got nothing else"
