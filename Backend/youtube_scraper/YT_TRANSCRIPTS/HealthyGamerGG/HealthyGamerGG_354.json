    "transcript": "hey I think this is wrong therefore\nscrew them downvote cancel them we never\nquestion our own beliefs and this is how\nwe create Echo Chambers and this is how\nwe stay\n[Music]\nstuck my ex consumed a ton of Dr K\ncontent and got a false sense of\nWellness just ah heads up my\nex-boyfriend had a huge mental health\nslide and became less and less well\nI was really worried about him but he\nfelt he was past needing therapy and\nabove getting an intake or any help of\nany kind yet he consumed a lot of Dr K\ncontent he even recommended that I watch\nDr K because my anxiety was getting\nworse actually I got therapy and it\nturns out that my anxiety was almost\nentirely to do with my ex our\nrelationship and my growing codependency\non trying to fix him well done\nunfortunately I think it gave him a s\nfalse sense of being on top of his\nmental health however it continued to\nget worse eventually I uncovered a very\nserious drug addiction issue not to\nmention other addictions over time such\nas gaming work shopping consuming\ncontent Etc one of the biggest things he\nis he obsessively watched the content\nbut never took any of the advice or put\nit into practice for example binge\nwatching the content on sleep hygiene\nlate at night and continuing terrible\nsleep habits after that while I did\nwatch some Dr Kane found it useful\ntaking notes Etc please be mindful that\nthis is not a substitute for real\nprofessional help journaling meds\ntherapy Etc I assume that this is\nprobably obvious yeah we say that at the\nbeginning of every stream and every\npiece of content that we put out and\ndon't think anyone has been misled thank\nGod however I saw the subreddit today\nand thought I'll leave a message before\nparting thank you so much for doing that\nlet's talk about the problems of\nwatching Dr K's content and the false\nsense of well-being that it provides so\nthis is something that we've got to\nunderstand okay so this is a case of of\nsomeone whose partner was addicted to\nwhat sounds like substances of some kind\nhad some pretty bad bad addictions and\nthen consumed mental health content on\nthe internet as an excuse to not do work\nas much as I love to bash Dr K's content\nI don't think we can really take the\nblame for this and here's the reason why\nhey y'all I want to take a second to\ntalk about HG coaching and y'all may be\nwondering oh my God bro like I don't\nwant to talk about coaching I just want\nto watch YouTube videos because there's\na part of your brain that recognizes\nthat you need to do better in life but\nyou don't actually want to invest the\ntime in energy you just want to sit\nthere and watch another YouTube video\nwhich is exactly why I developed a\ncoaching program because I realized the\nproblem that we have today is not that\nwe don't know what to do it's that we\ndon't really understand how we work and\nhow to get ourselves to actually do\nthings and the reason I developed a\ncoaching program is so that 12 weeks\nfrom now you can actually have made\nprogress we've shown that people improve\nin their sense of life purpose by about\n58% and a 25 to 45% reduction in\ndepression and anxiety the reason we\nmade a coaching program isn't because\nyou can't DIY it it's because if you\nwant to have made significant progress 3\nmonths from now you're going to need\nhelp doing it so if you're interested\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow and if you're still not ready yet\ntotally fine that's why we literally\nhave 800 YouTube videos so there's\nsomething we've got to understand about\nthe consumption of mental health content\nwhich is actually spiraling out of\ncontrol right now on the internet which\nwe are a part of okay and I'll tell you\nall what we're doing to to deal with it\nso the first thing to understand is as\nsomeone struggles with their mental\nhealth they recognize that their mental\nhealth is struggling and then what\nhappens is our mind does something\nreally really slippery which is it\nrecognizes okay I need to do something\nto fix this problem but then the problem\nis that there's a part of our mind that\nlooks at what it takes to fix a problem\nand decides that it doesn't want to do\nthat because fixing problems is\ndifficult fixing problems require\nrequires sacrifice fixing problems is\nsometimes painful and requires things\nlike accountability and the mind does\nnot like that so sometimes what the mind\nwill do is it'll look for something that\nis almost like virtue signaling for\nimproving our mental health it'll look\nfor something that says okay if I do\nthis thing then I'm checking the box of\nimproving my life and if I'm checking\nthe box then here's the key thing I can\ncontinue with the degenerate Behavior I\ndo not want to give up degenera is maybe\na little bit unfair like if people are\nstruggling with an addiction that's the\nslipperiness of the addiction mind this\nis what I learned as an addiction\npsychiatrist some people will show up\nand will talk the talk and now what's\nhappened is we have a plague of mental\nhealth content on the internet of which\nwe're guilty and here we are trying to\nhelp people with their mental health but\nthere's something really slippery that\ngoes on which is that watching our\ncontent is not going to be sufficient to\nchange your life\nright and I hate to say it but that's\nhow it is so this is what we actually\ntry to do with our content so I'm going\nto explain this I don't know that we'\nwe've ever explained this but so here's\nthe thing if someone is not reluctant to\nengage in in mental health support or\nImprovement what you basically have to\ndo is meet them where they're at which\nis precisely why we do what we do right\nso we try to create content that is\nengaging for people where they're at so\neven if someone doesn't actually want to\ndo anything about their mental health\nwe're actually okay with that and we're\ngoing to try to engage you in a way that\nsort of brings you in right makes things\na little bit entertaining a little bit\nfun a little bit humorous and hopefully\nby the end of it over time you will\nstart to make some changes and this is\nwhat we've seen in our community time\nand time and time again it's not like\npeople show up on day one and then they\nwatch one video and they're like oh crap\nI'm going to transform my life because I\nwatched one YouTube video by this guy\nand then I'm going to transform my life\nit's actually the people who do do that\nend up not sticking with it right and\nsometimes like this even consistent with\nthings like Mania where I've seen a lot\nof people you know clinically who are\nManic and they like watch one video and\nthey're like oh my God this transforms\nmy life so if you're someone who is\nwatching One video and you're like this\n is transforming my life unless it's\nthe gifted kids video that one is fair\ngame or maybe why yeah we've got a\ncouple that I think is fair to transform\nyour life to be honest we've heard that\nfeedback like time and time and time\nagain so maybe maybe maybe maybe like\none or two percent of yall you can be\ntransformed by one video we'll conce\nthat point but 99 to 98% of people let's\nbe honest one video is not going to\nchange your life and so then the\nquestion is if you're chain watching Dr\nK's content we see this a lot where\npeople will binge watch it right the key\nthing to understand is that information\ndoes not necessarily create behavioral\nchange there is a second component to\nthis which is the application of the\nstuff in your life and that's also why\nwhen we make content we don't just say\nhey here's what's going on we try to say\nlike okay here are one or two things\nthat you you can do to apply this\nprinciple to your life and that's where\nthe rubber meets meets the road right\nand this is true of other parts of like\nwatching content as well like you can\nlook at exercising content or if you're\nlike me you can watch cooking videos on\nYouTube but watching cooking videos is\nnot the same as learning how to cook and\nour content is no different so what I\nwould strongly encourage you all to do\nis pay attention to your mind right and\nhere's one really simple test that you\ncan do and be honest with yourself what\nam I watching this content for and there\nare a couple of reasons that you can\nwatch it number one is I'm watching this\ncontent in order to get ideas so that I\ncan make try to make some kind of\nsubstantial change to my life I'm\nwatching this in order to apply it okay\nthat's number one and if that's what you\nreally want to do what you should do is\ntry the thing in the video before you\nwatch the next video right try it the\nsecond thing that you can do to make our\ncontent more worthwhile is manipulate\nthe information so now we're going to\nteach you all some stuff about how\ninformation changes someone's behavior\nand this is the crazy thing it doesn't\neven require you to attempt to do\nsomething the key thing that has been\nshown scientifically to result in like\nunderstanding and behavioral change is\nthe ability to manipulate the\ninformation so for example if we have\nwhen we're working in the hospital right\nso I'm a psychiatrist so sometimes we'll\nhave someone in the hospital who wants\nto leave the hospital against medical\nadvice so this may be someone came in\nwith a heart attack and they are\naddicted to alcohol or opiates and so\nwhat happens is on day two of the\nhospitalization they had a small heart\nattack they're sitting in the ICU\nthey're starting to like want their\nsubstances they're starting to withdraw\nand they're like I want to leave and\npeople are like you can't leave you just\nhad a heart attack and then the patient\nis like no I want to leave and so then\nis a and then what happens is the\ncardiologist calls the psychiatrist\nright and so then I get a page and I\nshow up at like 2 in the morning because\nthere's a patient who's 2 days postm who\nwants to leave the hospital and now this\nis where we get into a really tricky\nthing as doctors because on the one hand\nwe're here to um help patients but we\nalso want to respect their autonomy and\nso what we do is something called a\ncapacity evaluation and a capacity\nevaluation involves checking a couple\nthings to make sure that this person is\nwell within their mental frame to make\ndecisions to leave the hospital and one\nof the key aspects that we rely on that\nsort of demonstrates that this person\nreally knows what they're doing is\nability to manipulate information and so\nif yall are watching our videos and even\nif you don't say you say Dr K says okay\nlike you should meditate one one every\nday for one week and you're like I can't\ndo that that's totally fine what you\nshould do though is manipulate the\ninformation play around with it in your\nhead what this means is challenge the\ninformation right so Dr K says this and\nI think he's wrong because of this\nthat's actually good tell me why I'm\nwrong right do it in your head or I\nguess post second thing that you can do\nis try to think about okay even if you\nthink that this is wrong and this is\nreally huge if you think a piece of\ninformation is wrong and you're\nlistening to someone else and your mind\nis reflexively challenging it if you\nreally want to learn and change what you\nshould do is try to understand how that\ninformation could be right so try to\ntake the other person's point of view\nand question your own beliefs right so\nthis is something that the internet\ndoesn't do the internet is like hey I\nthink this is wrong therefore screw them\ndownvote cancel them we never question\nour own beliefs and this is how we\ncreate Echo Chambers and this is how we\nstay stuck so if you are someone who\nconsumes some kind of content this is\nreally common by the way right so we see\nthis a lot with like people who are\nconsuming content that they disagree\nwith and this is like Pol this is going\nto be political where I'm going to watch\nvideos of people who I politically\ndisagree with and I'm going to just poop\non them in my head and I'm going to feel\nbetter about myself or we see it with\nthings like gender Dynamics where I'm\ngoing to consume stuff that has a view\non gender and relationships that I\ncompletely disagree with and I'm going\nto consume that content and then you\npeople are really confused they're like\nI don't understand why the algorithm is\nserving me this toxic content it's\nbecause the algorithm understands that\nyou actually really enjoy engaging with\nit right and then you watch this crap\nand you're like these people are wrong\nhaahahaha all these people are idiots\nthey're all dumb asses so this is what\nour mind reflexively does so if you want\nto learn something I know it sounds\ninsane but try to understand the other\nperson's perspective okay this is the\nsecond way you manipulate information\none is to challenge it and the second is\nto try to support it try to figure out\nwhat is this person thinking and in what\ncircumstances could this be true because\nhere's the crazy thing is if you\nunderstand that side of things you will\nunderstand so much more and you may grow\nyourself as a human being okay so that\nwhat you really need to do is manipulate\nthe information the third thing that you\ncan do is engage with the information\neither through conversation like you can\npost like we see this a lot where you\nknow we'll have like um video based\ndiscussions on our subreddit or talk to\npeople on Discord or talk to people\nabout you know what they think about\nthis particular thing these are all ways\nto manipulate information and for those\nof youall that are kind of lazy right\nyou're like eh I don't want to do\nanything I don't want to do anything I\ndon't want to like meditate I don't want\nto wake up I don't want to do yoga I\ndon't want to journal at least think\nabout it and that's one step forward in\nterms of like applying the content to\nyour life and this is something that I\nthink we\nundervalue in our society today so right\nnow we get bombarded with so much\ninformation and so many opinions that we\nstop thinking for ourselves and people\nare kind of like wondering they're like\nwhy on Earth do people listen to\ncelebrities and their opinions on like\ngeopolitics or the economy like what\ndoes a celebrity know about this\nparticular thing and why do we do that\nwe do that because we as human beings\nand in this society today we have\nsurrendered our capacity for critical\nthinking and this is where there's so\nmuch information but why isn't the whole\nworld becoming happy and successful\nright there's all the side hustle people\nout there the finance Bros and maybe\nFinance ladies who knows who are like\nyou should side hustle and you should do\nthis and crypto and like why isn't\neveryone a millionaire like what\nhappened like how is this there's so\nmuch good information it's because we\ndon't think about it we've stopped doing\nthe thinking for ourselves and so this\nis the key thing to understand about\nconsuming our content first of all\nyou've got to be careful that there is\nnot a part of your mind that is using\nour content as a substitute for Progress\ndo you all understand that what this\nmeans is that you think okay if I watch\n10 Dr K videos my life will get better\nright and so then you're like passively\nwatching Dr K videos because like if you\nwatch enough Dr K videos your life will\nget better right there's some data so\nwe're doing an internal study and we\nhope to kind of formalize it and stuff\nlike that so we have some initial data\nthat watching our content can improve\nmental health by about like 8 to 11%\nliterally like it may actually help just\nas a frame of reference you know some\nstudies show that medication improves\nthings by maybe about 30 to 50% right so\nsome studies say 50 or 60% chances are\nthat further data really shows that that\nnumber is way smaller than we thought\nand it's probably closer to 30% so hey\nlike I'll take watching YouTube or\ntwitch or whatever for a 10 like you\nknow being a third of the the value of\nan SSRI like I'll take that right so\nthis this data hasn't been third party\nchecked or we haven't done a formal\nstudy or anything like that yet we've\nseen a signal that is now like okay we\nshould really study this do something\nthat's a little bit more controlled\nreally analyze the data and see how much\nit helps people but this is also what we\nsee kind of like on on you know when\npeople in our community say hey you've\nhelped me a lot right so I went to the\ninternational last week and that was fun\nand like literally hundreds of people\nwere like hey your content has changed\nmy life so when people walk up to me and\nthey say that I'm like okay like maybe\nwe're doing something right but the key\nthing here is that you've got to be\ncareful because sometimes your mind will\ndelude you into thinking that you're\nmaking progress by doing something that\nis very very hands-off that's not hard\nso be careful about that binge watching\nour content like if you want to go for\nit right I'm not going to say no but\nalso recognize that there's a majority\nof people in our community who will say\nhey it helped a lot more when I slowed\nit down so watch out for that second\nthing is if you want to make it\nworthwhile just do the stuff that we\ntell you to do easy that's why we tell\nyou to do it right give it a shot I'm\nnot saying you have to do it 100% give\nit a shot the whole point is for you to\nlearn about yourself because I know it\nsounds crazy as brilliant as I am a\nstranger on the internet is not going to\nbe able to give you the perfect advice\nthe whole point of this channel is to\nteach people how to understand\nthemselves it's to teach you how to\nunderstand yourself so what we're going\nto do is we're going to give you like a\nheads up I mean sorry a head start right\nwe're going to give you we're going to\nlay things out so that you don't have to\nfigure everything out but you should\ntest it and apply the concept yourself\nand the last thing is even if you're not\nwilling to do anything that's okay try\nto manipulate the information challenge\nthe information try to understand for\nthe parts that you disagree with why is\nyour perspective different from this\nperson's perspective that's really\nhealthy and the fourth thing which we're\ntotally for is if you look at addiction\nPsychiatry change doesn't happen\novernight and so this is the fourth\nthing that we we really focus on and I\ndo this quite intentionally is I\nrecognize that not everyone is willing\nto make a change today when they watch a\npiece of our content they're not willing\nright so y'all in the audience you may\nnot be willing to change that's actually\nokay but as long as you stay around over\ntime what we tend to see is that people\nare more and more willing to change so I\nwouldn't say binge watch everything and\nthen disappear for a month what I'd say\nis like watch a couple videos a week and\nthen like over time like your desire to\nchange will increase and that's actually\nwhat we see too which is that I I I\ndon't think that you know I I don't\nthink that people find drastic change in\na short amount of time I think what\nhappens is people who are members of our\ncommunity their Mental Health both will\nimprove over the course of months to\nyears and so that can work and it's okay\nif you're not ready to change today\nwe're going to try to send you something\nentertaining but I think the unfortunate\ntruth is that a lot of people will use\nour content as a substitute for making\nprogress in their life they'll start to\nthink like okay if I watch enough\nYouTube videos I will be better and\nthat's just like saying look you can\nwatch enough YouTube videos about\nworking out Ain't Gonna Make You swole\nand I hate to say it mental stuff is a\nlittle bit different right because\nhopefully you can shape your thoughts\nand that's a part of being mentally\nswole but at some point you got to do\nsomething and so be careful about that\nfor yourselves and other\n[Music]\npeople"
