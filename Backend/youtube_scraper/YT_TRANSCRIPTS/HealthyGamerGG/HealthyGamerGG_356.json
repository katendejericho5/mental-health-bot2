    "transcript": "it turns out that wanting to be the best\nis stupid so the first thing to\nunderstand is that you can't be the best\nthe best is an abstraction of the Mind\nin nature there's no such thing as the\nbest and if we really look at it like\nwhat does the best even mean does the\nbest mean like in this group of people\nthat you know does it mean in the\nhistory of humanity does it mean the\npeople that you kind of see on social\nmedia like how do you even measure the\nbest so the crazy thing about being the\nbest is that it actually sabotages your\nmotivation it actually pushes you to\ngive up because unless you hit your\ntarget which is going to be really hard\nif you're starting from straight FS\nyou're actually shooting yourself in the\nfoot and it's not going to work so the\nfirst thing that you've got to do is\nabandon being the best because being the\nbest is actually rooted in insecurity\nyour attempt to be the best is your\nattempt to actually fix the shame that\nyou feel and it turns out that if we\nmetabolize that shame if we kind of\nacknowledge that hey like I screwed up\nlet's focus on doing better that's the\nright attitude to actually end up as\nawesome"
