    "transcript": "so there's actually good data that\nsuggests that gaming actually makes\npeople better at real life so the first\nthing is that in 2015 the United States\nDepartment of Defense did a study on\nadvantages of video gaming and what they\nfound is that the soldiers who played\nvideo games actually have a 20% higher\nfluid IQ than soldiers who don't now\nfluid IQ is a general IQ Dimension that\ninvolves problem solving so what we sort\nof know is that people who play lots of\ngames are actually much better at\nproblem solving than the people in the\naverage population so if you sort of\nthink about a video game what is a video\ngame it's a new set of rules with new\nchallenges every time you pick up a new\nvideo game the rules have changed the\ngoals have changed and the tools that\nyou have at your disposal to accomplish\nwhatever those goals are has changed so\nGamers get really really good at problem\nsolving there's absolutely an element of\nhand eye coordination that's really\nreally important"
