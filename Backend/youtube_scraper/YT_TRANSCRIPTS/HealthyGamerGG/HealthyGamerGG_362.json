to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is allo kenoa and I'm a\npsychiatrist who's devoted to helping\nthe digital generation fix their mental\nhealth so we here at healthy gamer do\nmore than make content we develop a lot\nof resources and we have a ton of help\nfrom amazing people and today we're\ngoing to give you all something a little\nbit different so usually we create\ncontent on the internet and we try to\nteach yall stuff and provide you with\ninformation the problem is that\ninformation doesn't always create\nbehavioral change and that's exactly why\nwe developed a coaching program so today\nyall are going to see a little sample of\nthat we're going to do this awesome\nevent that we usually run on our Discord\ncalled ask a coach and this can give\nyall a clear idea of what our coaches\nare like how they approach problems so\nthat you can decide if this is something\nthat you want to do the basic problem\nwith information is that we don't\nnecessarily know that after watching\nthis video you will change your life and\nthat's why we've developed a coaching\nprogram that is actually evidence-based\nnon-clinical and has been shown to help\npeople find a sense of purpose in life\nincrease their motivation and even\ndecrease feelings of anxiety and\ndepression a couple of other things to\nkeep in mind is we have a ton of\nresources at healthy gamer. and one last\nthing to keep in mind is that just like\nall of our other streams what we're\ndiscussing to is for educational and\nentertainment purposes only so nothing\nshould be taken as medical advice and

excited\nactually let me\nquickly cool while I set up y'all's name\ntags on stream do we want to go around\nintroduce ourselves maybe start with\npacks in the corner okay uh yeah I'm Pax\nuh I've been coaching with healthy Gam\nsince the program launched in like 2020\nI love doing that I love coaching it's\nvery fun uh and I think my favorite part\nabout it is just all the people I get to\nmeet um from all around the world and\njust the fact that uh I don't know it it\nto to see to see someone go from one\nplace to another and that other places\nwhere they want to go is very uh\nsatisfying um and so I think that's the\nthing I think at the core of it that's\nlike the fun part but um yeah also I\nlike fighting games so you know see me\nstre Street\nFighter\nawesome Julia do you want to go next\nyeah sure uh I've been coaching at HG\nfor just over two years now um and\nsimilarly to PA I just love talking to\npeople love hearing what's going on in\nyour lives and uh the more I talk to\npeople and the more I see them in\ndifferent scenarios it like helps me\nunderstand a little bit more what it\neven means to like be a person and I\nkeep having my my faith in these\nindividuals restored over and over again\nseeing y'all like go through it and then\nlike come out the other\nend\nawesome Alan do you want to\ngo hello my name is Alan also known as\nzzz1 143 either will do um I am part of\npax's cohort um so been with HG for\nabout three years now or a little over\nthree years now actually time flies and\num I think the part of coaching I like\nthe most varies a little bit um we've\ngot a few different stages of coaching\nso we've got like the emotional phase or\nunderstanding phase that I think about\nis uh connecting the the mind to the\nheart um and then connecting the mind to\nthe body in the action phase and then\nall the other Connections in the\nintegrative phase how do we really keep\nit together the Mind heart and body is\njust not obvious so that's my favorite\nphase lately is the integrative phase\nbecause it's like connecting the mind to\nthe heart well that has a lot to do with\nempathy but connecting the heart to the\nMind Body to the heart heart to the body\nit's like that's not obvious at all it\nvaries so much from person to person and\nthat's where I've lately been seeing\npeople discover uh the most truth about\nthemselves but yeah it's fun to\ncontribute to people's\nlives awesome all right last but not\nleast B do you want to go\nnext sure um so I feel I'm going to\nrepeat my colleagues here a little bit\nbut we're coaches because we love\nhelping people like I I feel like like\nthat's true for every single H coach um\nin addition to that for me I feel\nthere's two aspect to coaching that make\nit very worth worthwhile for me one of\nthem is the puzzle like okay what do you\nneed I'm going to be there to find it\nout with you and the second part is the\ncollaborative nature nature of it it's\nlike I'm not going to just go there and\nsolve the puzzle for you we're going to\nsolve it together I'm going to work with\nyou and we're going to solve your puzzle\nand damn it I'm going to there with you\nevery step of the way so for me is that\nmix of helping and figuring out the\npuzzle together is what really this is\nthe job for\nme\nawesome\ncool um yeah so I think uh the format\njust so chat sort knows what we're kind\nof doing here the format here is we're\ngoing to ask questions that we Source\nfrom y'all um and we're going to ask the\ncoaches those questions and we'll sort\nof go around the room get some answers\ndifferent answers same answers we'll see\nand yeah just sort of an opportunity to\nmeet the coaches and we'll see how it\ngoes um I think maybe just to kick off\num do you all want to just talk about\nwhat coaching is and like when should\none get\ncoaching we can start with whoever feels\ncomfortable taking that\nfirst I still have to explain this to my\ndad every now and\nthen what's yeah what's what do you say\nto your dad I'm super hat\nI oh sorry no no go ahead no no go for\nit go for it I I've just visited some\nfriends and one of them is like yeah\nwhenever people ask about about you\nthey're like what does he do and I'm\nlike he's like a therapist and I have to\nlike tell her I'm like no I'm not but no\none else knows how to explain what we do\nin a way that is convenient and and\nimmediately understandable and it drives\nme crazy and so I think that's why this\nquestion still\npersists definitely not not\ntherapy yeah my my favorite analogy is\num one that Dr K's Used where we're like\nphysical trainers but for the mind so\nwe've got like doctors for the body and\nthen they can kind of give medical\nadvice do surgery on people's knees and\nstuff like that and then there's\nphysical trainers who can you know\nsometimes give advice although coaching\nis not as much about advice um and do\nthings that will improve your health\nyour physical health but it's not\nmedical treatment there's not diagnosis\nthere's not a focus on pathology um\nthere's not uh kind of the treatment of\nthe illness and so that that's what I\nkind of think about as says it's like\nphysical Trainers for the mind and you\nknow some people are here to like take\ncare of their mental health really you\nknow optimally like pedal to the metal\nand then like fully like deep into the\nintegrative phase for years and then\nother people they get through the\nemotional phase and the action phase\nthey kind of reach their natural\nendpoint I think both are\nfine yeah piggy backing on on what Alan\nsaid um if you go to the doctor and you\ntell a doctor hey can you help me get\nfit the doctor's going to be like just\ngo to the gym right so that's what we\nare we are gym Trainers for the mind but\nI feel coaching goes beyond mental\nhealth we also get into the meaning of\nlife like we get we go on the edges of\nphilosophy of life as well which I feel\nkind of transcend mental health or at\nleast is part of it like on the more\nmetaphysical level if that makes\nsense yeah I it's a big part of the\nunderstand phas is understanding what\nyour view is of yourself which a lot of\npeople just don't have time to think\nabout or they've had to adapt by not\nthinking about it so I'm going to use\nkind of a video game analogy here um so\nI play a lot of OverWatch and there are\nOverWatch coaches and the the the\ncoaches\ndon't like sit with you and like tell\nyou exactly how to play the game while\nyou're playing it what they do is they\nget you to like say your thought process\nas you're going along and playing the\ngame and then they'll tackle maybe some\nof the thought process along with you\nand part of that is like vaud review so\nlike you go back and you watch your\nmatch and you're like oh that was weird\nI used my like on a nade here and like\nmaybe I didn't need to and like resource\nmanagement and like all this kind of\nstuff so they they help you tackle that\nrather than kind of spoon feeding like\nhere is exactly what's wrong and here is\nexactly what you need to do\nso in terms of when you get to that\nphase it's like oh hey so I'm like\nplaying comp and I'm not climbing and I\nliterally do not understand why like\nwhat is like is it like I I don't know I\nget stuck in this like mindset I'm just\nblaming all my teammates or like it just\nseems like\nlike the the matchmaking is against\nme can I add one more metaphor that's\nthat's different from what Julia said\nbut also kind of adds to the message\nthat she was trying to move away I'm a\nbig Lord of the Ring fans so I usually\ntell clients I'm the same to your fro I\ncannot carry the ring for you but I can\nbe here I can support you while you\ncarry the ring and if you're having\ndifficulties carrying the ring I'm going\nto be there and I'm going to you know\ncurse at the ring with you together\nwhile I also encourage you to take the\nnext step to destroy the ring\nbasically\ncool um already a great question from\nchat um more focus on group coaching um\ncan we please get an introduction to\ngroup coaching as in how does it work or\nhow is it helpful and yeah what's it all\nabout anyone can take this\none I feel like what like the ideal\ngroup coaching scenario is like like the\nwhole point at least in my mind and I\nhaven't done it in a while but like is\nto take a group of strangers uh from\nmore than likely lots of different kinds\nof backgrounds but all suffering in\nsimilar enough ways take that group of\npeople teach them how to openly and\nauthentically and compassionately\ncommunicate with each other about what\nthey're struggling with teach them how\nto not give advice teach them how to\nopen up space for other people to talk\nteach them how to restrain themselves if\nthey talk too much and then give them a\nweekly hour and a half to actually get\ntogether and talk about whatever it is\nthey want to talk about and see what\nthat group of people like how things\nlook for them like three months down the\nline six months down the line a year\ndown the line the the ideal for a group\nuh uh in coaching is like they get to a\npoint where they don't even need the\ncoach there because like they understand\nthe rules well enough to be\nself-perpetuating like and to just have\nlike I think you could start a group at\na healthy gber and if it goes well if\nyou hit that like ideal like you'll just\nhave that group for as long as the\npeople in that group want it to be alive\nlike you don't even need HG for that um\nwhich I think is really cool and I think\nmore than anything at the core of that\nis like a sense of belonging and being\nunderstood and having your people even\nthough you just met them you're not\nrelated you're not even really friends\nwe actually have restrictions around\nthat like on sort of forming friendships\nlike not in the sense of like hey you\nknow if if you and this person are\nplaying like Final Fantasy outside of\nsessions well now you two are getting\ncloser when the rest of the group isn't\nand so we don't we we say like please\ndon't do that because we want you all to\nbe on the same page and eventually what\nyou get is like this like cohesive Unity\nthat just it it's a beautiful thing to\nwatch and it's it's one of the most\nfulfilling things I've seen uh in\ncoaching is like seeing a group do\nreally well um and I think that's like\nthe goal for a lot of them in my\nmind in a nuse shell like I think the\nsingle most powerful line I've ever\nheard about group came from Dr K he\nsaid\ngroup is a reflection of what happens\noutside of group so if you're a member\nand you come to group and you present\nyourself a certain way and you\ncommunicate a certain way with the\nmembers and the and the coach that\nprobably mirrors what happened outside\nof group in your real life so for that\nreason I feel groups are especially good\nfor people who have trouble socializing\nsocial anxiety lonely\nand and maybe they want accountability\nfor for the goals and and a place to\ncheck in like to make sure that they are\npursuing the goals and getting the\nsupport that they need to accomplish\nsomething difficult every week\num is the perfect training I feel group\nis the perfect training ground for\nwhatever you want to accomplish outside\nof group and it's a place that is safe\nto train is safe to speak your mind\nfreely and you know you'll be supported\nand challenged\nbut you're always from a place of\ncompassion and understanding from both\ncoach and members and where you also\nlearned we have a little portion of a\nskills teaching by the coach on the\nfirst during the first weeks during the\nfirst portion of the program so you'll\nbe learning skills that are good to\napply in group but that you can totally\napply them outside of group as well in\nyour relationships which I feel is\nfantastic and most of our members report\nthat they love that portion of the\nprogram because they get to apply that\noutside of group as well so in that\nsense it's like a fantastic training\ngrounds for for\nLife yeah I would say that part part of\nwhat makes it the perfect training Dr\nground is because of those boundaries so\nbecause you're this person that you're\ntalking to in group is not your boss or\nyour friend or your romantic partner you\ncan experiment and take risks because\nlike one of the Val or three of the\nvalues in um group are being\ncompassionate authentic and present well\nhow do you balance compassion and\nauthenticity that's not obvious you\ncan't really like put it into a formula\nand I wouldn't yeah I would say it's\nit's enough of an art not just a science\nthat really takes some kind of personal\nexperimentation with people and we don't\nreally have spaces for that outside of\ngroup the world's not set up to account\nfor like well you all know what I'm\nsaying but I think what you were gonna\nsay yeah the the the experimentation\naspect is massive so well the first\nthing I'll say\nis the the clients that I've heard that\nreport the most success from group are\ntaking those core skills and then\nthey're mustering up sort of the courage\nthrough that\nexperimentation Zone to use it with the\npeople that are actually going to be\npermanent in their lives and then it's\nlike oh I've learned how to help people\nand I've learned how to help myself and\nI've learned how to ask for help from\nother people because for whatever reason\nmaybe I felt like undeserving of help or\nwhatever it is like this whole getting\nhelp thing has been really hard for me\nso now now I've learned what it looks\nlike for life to be a little bit more\ncollaborative and a little bit more\nrelationship focused rather than like I\ngot to power through and do it do it all\nby myself um and then the other the\nother thing that's really cool with the\ngroup is like of course you're talking\nabout yourself and your problems and\nyou're bringing that stuff up to the\ngroup you're also learning how to\naddress relationship Dynamics on a meta\nlevel in real time and looking\ninternally and being like oh this person\nsaid this thing and like I feel some way\nso what is that mean to communicate that\nto them and then sort of Workshop this\nconversation in real time again in a\nsafe environment where you're not going\nto like burn Bridges the understanding\nis that like for the most part they're\ngoing to come back and like you're going\nto continue to try to Foster these\nrelationships within the\ngroup\ncool there's another followup question\nto that so is there H how do coaches\ncreate a safe space in group coaching is\nthat something that we\ndo yeah we do yeah we do\nthat sorry go ahead B no I was just\ngonna say yeah yeah we do do that so we\nwant a place where people can feel safe\nand also a space where people can be\nchallenged so people can disagree in\ngroups\num there's even moments in my groups\nwhere people might say some judgment and\nin that case what I try to do as a\nfacilitator is try to try to dig\nunderneath that and say like okay how\ncan we understand this as a group and a\nlot of that um my sort of bias as a\nfacilitator is checking in with\nempathetic capacity and trying to get a\nsense of how much capacity do people\nhave to be compassionate authentic and\npresent and if someone's low in empathy\nthey're not necessarily going to have\nthe capacity to hear what the other\nperson is saying um so sometimes that\ninvolves stepping in and uh requiring\nsome kind of mediation and then it's the\nkind of the call of the facilitator to\nsay you know is somebody far enough out\nthat they might not be the best fit for\ngroup y the the safe sorry\nviia the yeah the safe space like it's a\ntricky question because like I want to\njust be able to say a blanket yes but\nthe the fact is you're getting in with a\ngroup of seven strangers and like you\ncan't from the get-go guarantee that\nevery place is going to be safe what we\ncan do though is like what Alan said is\nreact in the moment and try to make sure\nit doesn't get so out of hand like part\nof the space being actually a little bit\njudgmental and a little bit quote\nunquote unsafe is like okay so how are\nwe going to manage that and how are we\ngoing to deal with that like is this\njust the whole group is going to explode\nnow or is this like we're going to try\nto move through this like there are\nknown phases that we've like observed in\nour groups where the group is just like\nyo we're going to fight each other like\nwe're going to kind of like battle it\nout we're testing these boundaries a\nlittle bit we're trying to try to see\nhow far I can go and how blunt I can\nkind of be before people are like hold\non wait a second and try to figure out\nwhat that what that looks like um but\nbut the safety really like the the for\nme the fundamental aspect of the saf\nis we have those three presence\nauthenticity compassion pillars like you\ngot to have all three that's the one\nthing and then the second thing being\nthat there's no real life consequences\nis like we've tried to design it so much\nso that you can't like your your life is\nstill your life you walk out you log off\nand you go and like it might feel\nhorrible but you haven't destroyed your\nlife by having conflict yeah like those\npeople the rest of members don't bleed\ninto the rest of your life you're not\ngoing to see them at the office you're\nnot going to see them on the street or\nthey're not your neighbors right but\npiggy bagging on on what both Alan and\nJulia said what does safe mean in this\nquestion that we were asked right like\nsave doesn't mean oh rainbows and\nunicorns and everything's fantastic all\nthe time um discomfort it can be part of\nsafe like that that that space is safe\ndoesn't mean there's no discomfort in it\num if the person who asked the question\nby any chance is concerned like about\nextreme situations or something we have\npolicies to like keep that in check so\nto not not ruin absolutely ruined the\nexperience for all the other members\njust because one of them is doing\nsomething crazy right but um that\ndoesn't mean that discomfort is not part\nof group which because he usually is and\nthere's a lot of growth and benefits to\ngather from it by everybody\ninvolved yeah there's a huge amount of\ngrowth from whatever the the conflict\nmay end up being um and at the end of\nthe day like if you're really\nuncomfortable with it you're really not\nfeeling it like you know clients always\nhave the option to direct message their\ncoach like privately and be like hey\nwhen so and so did this I didn't say\nanything I didn't like it you know I\ndon't want to talk about it myself in\ngroup next week can you talk about it\nand like yeah like that's something that\nyou can always do like if you don't feel\ncomfortable with something and you don't\nfeel comfortable addressing it like just\nreach out to your coach and they'll know\nwhat to\ndo or they won't but they'll figure it\nyeah they'll ask other coaches and then\nfigure\nout yeah do you want to talk about like\nall the support you know support\nstructures that are in place for\nthat oh dude I don't know how I'd do\nanything without it even though I I\ndon't use it that often these days the\nfact that it's there makes me very\nsecure it it really helps me feel like\nwe're chilling because we have uh I mean\nI don't know how much I mean we have\noffice hours we have uh uh we don't call\nit supervision anymore we call it\nsomething else case management uh case\nreviews case reviews case review that's\nright uh we have case reviews we have\noffice hours we\nhave we have like events and stuff that\nare educated we have like clubs we have\na lot of stuff to help people out with\ncoaching specifically though and whether\nit's run by other coaches who are really\non their aame and know what they're\ndoing or if like in case reviews where\nit's run by um our uh uh mental health\nprofessionals that we consult with um\nlike that's every week multiple times a\nweek you could just come in whenever you\nwant to or not it's just there you can\ntalk out whatever problems you have\nanonymously with people who want to be\nhelpful um and it's insanely valuable\nlike it it just it makes this job so\npossible and I say one of the main oh\nsorry I just was gonna\nsay you go\nyeah go Al Alan it's\nokay I'll be quick I was just going to\nsay that the main support that we have\nis all the coaches we are Global there's\nalways someone awake like on the other\nside of the world always we're like\nawake like AG Community is awake 247 so\nwe have channels where we can contact\neach other and it's like I'm having\ntrouble with this and there's always a\nfellow H coach that's going to go and\nhelp you give you materials give you\nsupport all sorts of things so um I feel\nlike my co-workers are like a huge\nsource of support in addition to case\nreviews and office hours and and all the\nother additional amazing support that we\nget sorry Alan you go yeah so um I would\nsay that this this is what makes HGH HG\nis listening and and empathy that's kind\nof the core of what we do and we listen\nto each other as coaches it's not just\nDr K's ideas or individual coaches ideas\nit's um Dr K and mental health\nconsultants who are licensed\nprofessionals who can kind of give us\nmore context even though we're not\nproviding medical treatment it kind of\nhelps us be safe and um we've got office\nhours run by um coaches and we've got\nwater cooler and more social events and\nthen we also have y'all so each time\ny'all fill out a survey or give us\nfeedback or if someone drops coaching\nand then they get a call and then we try\nto ask like hey what what's going on\nwhat went well what didn't go well and\nthat collection of data is our most\nvaluable source of information we've got\na great research team that goes over it\ntoo and then that research is kind of\nsynthesized then kind of um spread out\namong all the other coaches so we're\ngetting better and better as time goes\non cool awesome um let's get to one of\nthe questions that we have from our\nYouTube\nCommunity um this was actually the most\nup footed question so going to go over\nit first um this person asks um so this\nis more in the context of coaching how\nwould a coach sort of approach this\nsituation if a client came with this\nproblem but they're asking how can you\ndeal with triggers in a relationship\nsometimes people are scarred from bad\nexperiences which makes them react more\nextremely in some situations because it\ntriggers the old pain how should you\ndeal with this as a triggered person as\nwell as a romantic\npartner\nI have thoughts about this yeah me too\nsorry Alan I want to hear your thoughts\nfirst I'll just start with some some\ngeneral disclaimers so one is that when\nwe say triggered so sometimes that\nrefers to um a a package of emotional\ncognitive data that's just stored in the\npast and that's not necessarily a\nclinical issue and then on the other\nhand there's trauma that rises to\nclinical threshold and in those kinds of\ncases if you're kind of unsure you have\na clinical concern the answer is to see\na licensed professional to make sure\nbecause sometimes talking about it or\ndoing a lot of the things we might\nrecommend as coaches isn't necessarily\nthe best way to deal with trauma that\nrises to a clinical threshold and that\ndoesn't necessarily mean when I say\nclinical threshold that doesn't\nnecessarily mean you're diagnosed with\ncomplex post- tromatic stress disorder\nor post-traumatic stress disorder it\njust means that it's trauma that's bad\nenough that you would need licensed\nprofessional in order to navigate it in\na safe way but most of the time when\npeople say trigger I I take it you're\nnot using it in the technical sense\nyou're just kind of using it in the more\ncasual way where people just sort of get\nactivated and in those kinds of cases\none of the things that we start to focus\non first is listening which is the most\nimportant part of communication where\nyou're like what what exactly when the\nother person says something triggering\nwhat does that activate in you if you're\nresponding are you responding it kind of\na more empathetic way or a sympathetic\nway and these are things like so if you\nwant a good example of this um if you\nwatch the first 30 30 or 40 minutes on\nstream Dr K is not problem solving and\nhe's not reassuring he's just kind of\nreflecting back what the other person\nsays as a kind of mirror and asking\nopen-ended questions so not multiple\nchoice and not um uh not kind of yes or\nno questions most of the time and in\naddition to that if the other person is\nkind of resistant if that that inspires\nsome more like strong emotions or kind\nof active ego we can talk a little bit\nabout what ego means he's still doubling\ndown on that kind of understanding now\nif you find yourself triggered and you\nfind yourself unable to understand you\ncan kind of decrease the amount of\ntriggers you have but I don't know that\nit's possible to eliminate all of them\nand there's some you know monks who\nmight disagree with that but I think\nthat um uh sometime I I think about\nempathy as something that's a little bit\ndifferent than love where with love with\nwith our meta meditation you kind of\ngive it and then you you kind of get\nmore of it and like you you imagine\nyourself loving a an an enemy and then\nyou're loving someone you respect and\nthen it kind of grows and grows and\ngrows whereas for for empathy you really\nneed to kind of receive some of it in\norder to get it so sometimes if you're\nhaving trouble um communicating with\nother people you need to be kind of\nlisten to yourself and that's a lot of\nwhat we do as\ncoaches and there's so much like\ngroundwork like within that because like\nthere's so many like foundational\nprinciples to help understand the\nscenario that I think like need to be\nunderstood on some level like it's\nexhausting um but my my go-to is always\nlike you know if and because I've\ncoached enough people who are having\nrelationship issues where like I tell\nthem all the same thing at the top of it\nwhich is like you know if I could talk\nto both of you that'd be great but I\ncan't that's not how this works and you\nknow which is why I always recommend\nlike a couple's counselor or something\nakin to that someone that you know\nobviously you don't just go with anyone\nbut like try them out get a consultation\nfind someone you trust that you like but\nlike that's always my preferred goto\nrecommendation right off the bat is\nbecause like you need someone who can uh\nbe objective about both of you um but\nbeyond that it's\nlike was this question from the person\nthe perspective of the person getting\ntriggered or from the perspective of the\nperson dealing with the the person who\nis experiencing that I think they ask\nabout both\nyeah yeah okay um but yeah I mean Alan's\ntotally right it's like listening is\nessential and like you need to but not\nonly listening to your partner but also\nlistening to like internally like what\nwhat is screaming within you in that\nmoment that is not uh you know defensive\nor or deflective but is actually like\nyou know what learning how to understand\nyour own pain which like you would think\nlike oh it's my pain I know it and it's\nlike do you maybe like when was the last\ntime you like sat with it and didn't try\nto distract yourself from it and really\nobserved it and like noticed where it\nwas like coming from um the more clarity\nyou can get on that the more you can\neffectively communicate to your partner\nand understand what your triggers are\nsort of how they affect you why they\naffect you in that way you don't even\nhave to honestly always communicate that\nor even understand that but it's the\nfact that it's there um and then your\npartner hopefully ideally uh you know\nthe the way I like to think about it now\nis like okay we're two human beings who\nare up against our own like internal BS\nand we're trying to create this like\nthing outside of ourselves that is like\ncohesive between the two of us so it's\nus against our own internal BS to make\nthis thing and which means observing\nthat stuff understanding that stuff\nwhere it comes from and like just\npointing it out as it happens and\nchecking in then like learning not how\nto learning how not to feed the beast\nwhatever that Beast may be so like if\nyou have been cheated on and you you\nhave a lot of trust issues and you feel\nlike compulsive needs to check your\npartner's phone having that\nunderstanding that you have that and\ntelling it to your partner and then like\nletting your partner know like hey I'm\nfeeling like I want to check your phone\nand then your partner could be like do\nyou you can if you want to like give\nthem that choice if they refuse like\nthey're not feeding the Beast they're\nmaking that sun scar a bit smaller it's\ngoing to be easier next time to deal\nwith and if they give in it's not the\nend of the world like you know we we\ntake it one day at a time some days\nyou're a lot stronger than others um and\nso it's a long process and it requires a\nlot of understanding a lot of listening\nand a lot of patience um but yeah no I\nrealized we're only supposed to limit\nour answers like 2 minutes so I don't\nwant to take up too much\ntime um So to avoid adding too much to\nwhat these two BS were talking about\nsomething um something that can be\nhelpful to go through in coaching is\nlike okay what's the thing that hurts so\nlike what's the event then what's the\nemotion so understanding the emotional\nreaction and and then understanding our\nreaction to that emotion so like what's\nthe behavior that follows that and so a\nlot of people would be like oh this like\nsomeone says this and then I get like I\nget angry and then I feel guilty that\nI'm angry and then I feel like a\nhorrible person and a horrible friend a\nhorrible daughter a horrible partner and\nthen I hate myself and then I go\nand decide that I'm Unworthy of\nrelationships you know like something\nlike that there's like a series of\nevents it's it can feel like 0 to 100\nbut like breaking down what's actually\ngoing on in between all of that and\nfiguring out like oh okay so like\nthere's a pattern we tend to feel bad\nwhen people insinuate that I'm\nincompetent or like we tend to feel bad\nwhen people it seems like they might\nabandon me any of these kinds of things\num which might might actually pop up in\nthe coach client relationship especially\nin group and then you can kind of\nWorkshop that in real time which is\nreally helpful uh and then having some\nkind of stop Gap in place where it's\nlike okay so given that this is how you\ntend to feel we're going to make a space\nwhere it's okay and understandable and\nmakes sense that you feel that\nway even if you feel like you're not\nallowed to feel that way however that\nbeing said the reaction you have now to\nthe feeling and like the behavior that\nfollows this is now up to you hopefully\nto be able to have some idea of how you\nmight want to move forward with and like\nhow you might want to control your\nreaction without suppressing the emotion\nitself I want to add that um well I want\nto like I want to reemphasize the two\ndis glimmers that my fellow coaches did\nwe do not coach couples we we get\nrequested that of often when there's\nrelationship issues but we do not do\nthat at healthy gamer at present and um\nwe are not equipped as coaches to\nexplore trauma that's a that's in the\nrealm of therapy um but what we can do\nis we can accompany and help raise\nawareness and develop healthy coping\nmechanisms for the result of those\ntriggers for whoever our client is\neither the person who's being triggered\nor the partner of the person who gets\ntriggered because sometimes like we\nusually think of the person being\ntriggered suffering which they do suffer\nbut the partner of such person also\nsuffers so sometimes they also need to\nthey also need tools to tolerate their\npartner being triggered emotionally\ndeveloping their patience understanding\nempathy forgiveness as well as how to\nhelp that partner deal with the triggers\nof their's partner when the other\nperson's triggers or like work with the\npartner to come up with an agreed upon\nplan about what is your\nrole when they are triggered type of\nidea right and and to let that person\nalso know that it's okay for them\ncommunicate how they feel about the\nother person being triggered being\nauthentic from a place of compassion in\norder to avoid later resentment by\nexpressing yourself to your partner\nbecause that can be really hard like\nseeing a partner suffer through triggers\nthat you may be a part of that can also\nbe a very hard place to be in and that's\nif your client is the partner of the\nperson being triggered and if our client\nis the person that has the trigger then\nwe will explore okay like let's raise as\nmuch aware awareness as possible about\nthe specific triggers that you have\nmaybe an idea why do I react like this\nwhen this happens and then we can help\nyou uh manage those triggers at both an\nemotional level and at a practical level\ntoo and to decrease the emotional\nreactivity as well as to how can I\ndevelop self sothing techniques healthy\ncopy mechanisms um and on regardless of\nwho of these two people is our is our\nclient working on improving their\ncommunication skills so that they can\ncommunicate with their partner whoever\none of these two is or client because at\nthe end of the day you have a rtic\npartner and one of you is triggered both\nof you need to communicate through that\nso we can help with that as\nwell and and all of that gets Amplified\ninto high tier endgame rating when you\nhave one partner gets triggered by\nsomething and then the fact that they\ngot triggered by that thing triggers the\nother person and then they do something\nthat triggers this person and then you\njust have this it's a it's like dude\nbeing a human is so hard um but it's fun\nit's worth it you just got to figure it\nout chain reaction for\nsure yeah\ncool all right um in the meantime there\nwas a question that I can take actually\nreal quick could I start coaching\nimmediately or is there a weight list we\ndo have a number of spots right now\nthere's no weight list at the moment but\nbut spots typically tend to go fast so\nif you do want to sign up now is a good\ntime um cool all right next one how do I\nget rid of the fear of being judged\nespecially when meeting new people as a\ncoach what would you sort of work with\nsomeone how would you work with them on\nthat well the first this is a trap\nquestion yeah\nwhat were you thinking\nAlan I'm curious for your thoughts\nfirst okay\nwell the the the when I hear get rid of\nX emotion then I kind of like have alarm\nBell go bing bing bing bing bing okay um\ncuz how do you get rid of being afraid\nof being judged is you like hide in a\nhole and like never emerge like I like I\ndon't I don't I don't know what being a\nhuman looks like and not having some\nfear of Judgment at some point so uh the\nthe question like the line of\nquestioning I might go down is is maybe\nabout that like about the tendency if\nthere is a tendency this is like a big\nif to want to hide away from negative\nemotion and like being unable to move\nthrough so it's like I'd rather not feel\nthe fear and and maybe an understanding\nof what confidence looks like does\nconfidence mean I don't feel scared or\nlike there's that feel the fear and do\nit anyway is kind of the first thing\nthat came to my mind but that feels\nreally like read this book called fear\nthe feel feel the fear and do it\nanyway yeah so so I I would want to ask\nabout that the relationship with those\nkinds of emotions with fear with\njudgment\nwhat does it look like what does it feel\nlike what's it like to be vulnerable in\nthat sense and be in front of new people\nand what are we afraid of them thinking\nwhat are the main things that we assume\npeople are thinking about us and like\nwhat's up with that where does that come\nfrom please flush out what I've said\nother people so I I I don't know how\nmuch I can flesh out because I think\nthat's really the core of it um I will\nsay sometimes I can be a little bit of a\ntroll so\nsometimes uh I might say um well you\nknow there is a solution to getting rid\nof the fear of judgment if you're\nworried about something someone judging\nyou is you can kill them because studies\nshow that dead people are not able to\njudge\nyou so but I think that uh there is no\nstudy that says that I that's cap I\ndon't stud I'll I'll I'll send I'll send\nyou some uh some sources later we try to\ncite our sources at HG um but uh I think\num yeah I I I would try to ask some big\npicture questions as well of like you\nknow what's important about getting rid\nof the fear of being judged like what\nwhat are some of the goals that that's\nconnected to that you want to accomplish\nand kind of especially because people\ntend to ask questions like that during\nthe first few sessions and a lot of the\ntimes the coaching goals that they have\naren't necessarily all that fleshed out\nyet so we'll try to tie it into\nthose\nyeah\nwell I like what everyone's saying oh\nokay B I was waiting for okay yeah go go\nB and then\nI'll I was just gonna flush uh this just\nyou know on in the same line as Julian\nAllan so basically if you have a fear of\nbeing judg right\nlike analyzing what contest or\nsituations make you feel judged and then\nI would probably challenge you how do\nyou know you're being judged and what\nkind of judgment do you perceive you're\nyou're getting because he's like hey\njudgments can be positives but you're\nprobably not thinking of those right\nyou're probably thinking oh I'm very\nvery negatively judged in some way um I\nwould also as a coach validate even if\nyou have no proof for I'm actually being\njudged it feels like that and that feels\ncrappy so I'm going to validate that\nregardless of whether you have proof for\nthat or not right and um but then at the\nend of the day what we want is to get\nyou from a place of understanding to a\nplace of management of those fear\nemotions of being judged when they\nhappen and also is the fear preventing\nyou from doing things that you want to\ndo in your life right so how can you\nstill go and accomplish what you want to\naccomplish well without being uh uh\nblocked by your fear of being judged\nright so understanding and um awareness\nof that would be the first step and then\nas we gain more understanding because\nthe source of this can be very different\nfrom from person to person so answering\nthis in the abstract it's kind of\ndifficult I guess that's why we're kind\nof repeating the same ideas as coaches\nnow because we don't have a particular\nexample right\nyeah and just to give a better sense of\nthe structure of how it might go in a\nsession I might ask the person like if\nthey prefer teaching or me to kind of\nlike ask questions I'm one of the\ncoaches that tends to rely a little bit\nmore on teaching sometimes though most\ncoaches don't um and if someone's unsure\nthen I'll just keep asking questions but\num there's a lot of great questions\nabout like what our relationship is um\nbest to have with fear right because\nwhen we think about just like the idea\nof an emotion in general there's no\nconsensus among psychologists among like\nwhat an emotion even is so a lot of the\ntimes when we're asking these questions\nwe're not trying to be Socratic we're\nnot looking for the right answer we want\nto see where your intuitions are first\nand how you came to your\nconclusions yeah as part of the coaching\nprocess\nclient intuitions and ideas and inklings\nare super valuable it's not that we\ncoaches all all the almighty answers and\nclient knows nothing and here client his\nor wisdom is not like that client holds\na lot of wisdom we're just helping them\ntap into it so whatever inkling they\nhave if they bring it to the table\nthat's going to be probably the best to\nmake like to make results\nhappen\nyep we we we're pretty good at doing\nstuff if we let ourselves have a chance\nto do it and like use our own Insight um\nand all I was going to add to all that\nis like I think ultimately the place\nwhere after you do everything everyone\nsays like the place you want to get to\nin that scenario is like going from that\nquestion to all right now the question\nis how do I go meet new people while\nbeing afraid of judgment like how do I\ndo both of those things and like that's\nwhere we ultimately I think want to get\nto is like operating within that fear\nwhich Julie alluded to that's\nall yeah avoiding some sort of like\nsocial perfectionism like being\nuniversally liked and never being\nnegatively judged and having absolute\ncertainty that that's the case that's\nnever going to happen so it like it like\num we can of promis Miracles as coaches\num so the best we can do is help you\nnavigate and operate within within the\nfear and hopefully decrease um the\nintensity of it so that you can go and\ndo the things that you want to\ndo cool um there's a really good\nquestion in chat how is coaching usually\nstructured will will goals be set on the\nfirst session to Benchmark later or how\ndoes it\nwork yes to all\nI mean I try I I try my darnest to get\ngoals set up in the first session but it\nrarely pans out that way um and that's\nnot because people are bad at it but\nit's because it's just not a lot of the\ntimes people come into coaching so\nthey're like something's wrong things\ncould be better I can point vaguely at\nsome things maybe I'm super certain\nabout one thing um but a lot of the\ntimes it's kind of wishy-washy it's just\nlike I don't know life kind of sucks and\nit's like okay so let's talk about that\nand as we talk about that um goals\nbecome apparent over time uh as as pain\npoints become apparent over time um and\nreally I would say if there's the the\nbiggest structure to coaching is that it\nis a conversation um and it's not so\nmuch well how do I\nsay if if there could be a winning\nstructure and I I tell this to all our\nCL it's like if there is a winning Str\nstructure to this it's that you come\ninto every session with like an idea of\nsomething you want and then we explore\ngetting there um whether it's wanting\nunderstanding about something about\nyourself wanting Clarity on something or\nwanting to know how to go somewhere or\njust being like okay I have this goal\nI'm not really sure how to get there um\njust having that intention beforehand\ncoming into it I think makes a huge\ndifference um you don't need to to have\nsuccessful sessions by any means but I\nthink it's in your best interest as a\nclient um to put in that little effort\nuh same with like journaling every day\nlike that helps to well now I'm getting\ninto a different topic which is like how\nto be expeditious in your coaching\nexperience um but yeah I would say\nthere's no like\nset structure to it though it's really\nevery Coach Works a little bit\ndifferently from each other every client\nWorks differently from each other\nobviously and so with all those\ndifferent factors it's like no coaching\nsession is going to really look exactly\nthe same as another but the fundamental\nprinciples that we operate on that we\nwere trained on are ultimately The\nGuiding Light through all of that and\nthat's really the essential part as\nopposed to I would say any structure is\njust\nyou know you showing up as a client\nbeing vulnerable um being expressive and\nthen us showing up as coaches and using\nour skills to the best of our abilities\nto help you get whatever you're looking\nfor I compare goals to a compass not to\na map a map has like detail instructions\non how to get to from place a to place B\nbut I feel the the goals that clients\nbring are more like I want to go north\nbut who knows what's North right so they\nbring that on the first session and\nwe're like let's start walking towards\nwhatever North is and maybe along the\nway we're like wait a minute like let's\ngo east now and then we go east and then\nit's like hey let's go back North and\nnow let's go south a little bit so goals\ndefinitely transform over the course of\ncoaching and I I wanted I I want to ask\nmy colleagues here but my most common\nexperience with goals is we always ask\nabout goals in the first session just to\nget an idea of what the client wants and\nwhat they want to accomplish um at some\npoint could it be mid one3 into the\nprocess who knows depends on how long\nthe client stays um in coaching with us\nwe reassess those and then whenever they\nwrap up and we ask like I always ask\nlike hey remember the goals from the\nfirst session I'm going to read back\nfrom the notes that we take and read\nthose back to you how do you feel most\nof the times they're like I have not\naccomplished that but for some reason I\ndon't care so much about that because\nnow I have accomplished this and I've\nnoticed that that was the real goal all\nalone I just didn't know in the first\nsession so that's the most common\nexperience and I feel those are the most\nsatisfied clients like they're they're\nopen to I bring some goals but I live\nwith something else and that makes the\nfirst goal kind of it was kind of\ndisguising the real goal that's common\nsometimes the first the goal in the\nfirst session is the actual goal and\nthat's what we work on and that then\nthey accomplish that at the end of of\ncoaching sometimes that also happens but\nthe other scenario I feel is more\nComon yeah to add to add to that and to\nconnect to something you said Julia like\nin the sense of like coaching is like\nVOD review which I totally agree um like\nsometimes client will come in and be\nlike how can I get like you know my\nWidowmaker like head shot percentage up\nto like 70 and it's like that's a\nterrible goal to have not because 70 is\na bad number but because that's not\nactually important to winning the game\nlike your statistics don't actually\nmatter but people come to coaching with\ngoals like that all the time and then\nover the course of culing their their\ngoals actually adjust to something that\nis actually usually more useful to them\nwhich is like you know how do I be a\nbetter team member um and and so that\ntransformation happens all the time yeah\nthe the thing that I was going to say is\nis where I notice the goals transform\nthe most is where they start as some\nexternal Ben like we heard the word\nBenchmark like it starts as a benchmark\nin the client's mind of like I hit this\nor I don't I fail it or I pass and then\nthat gets through the coaching process\nlike part of what I do is like question\nthe goals heavily not like a mythbuster\nlike I'm trying to do a gacha like haha\nyour goals were fake all along but it's\nmore like what's important about the\ngoal and sometimes the goal is\nrepresentative of something else it's\nlike oh I want to feel accomplished or I\nwant to feel like I have a place in my\nfriend group like I want to I want to\nfeel loved I want to feel appreciated I\nwant these kinds of things for myself\nlike I don't I don't know who I am like\nI want to discover even what what's up\nwith me would have\nlike I I don't know what I want and um\nyeah so so often it transforms into\nsomething a bit more I guess personal I\nwould say internal rather than kind of\nan external uh Benchmark so yeah that's\nwhat I have to say on\nthat um yeah so sometimes I will troll\npeople and say haha the goals were fake\nall along because a lot of the times\nthey are I think in um the when when\npeople haven't gone through in emotional\nphase yet our emotions are a really\nimportant part of our thinking and if we\ncan't really think very clearly a lot of\nthe goals that are imposed on us are um\nnot uh just not real doesn't exist it's\nfiction um but uh I I think that I see\nthem often change when they leap from\none phase to the other so if you go to\nthe emotional phase the action phase\nthere's normally some change and I see a\nlot of substantial change from the um\naction phase to the integrative phase\nand I would say the emotional phase um\nunless things have been updated normally\nlast somewhere between 8 and 16\nweeks can I ask what what Pax was\nlaughing at because Allan said it's\nfiction and you're like Frakes from uh\nuh what's that show called beyond belief\nfact or fiction I love that show anyway\nsorry brilliant I knew there was some\nundercover reference I was not\ngetting that show was incredible by the\nway I I think it's free somewhere I\ncould wrong I I won't do advertisements\non stream I'm sorry I apologize you're\ngood we pardon\nyou cool um actually two or three really\ngood questions in chat more I think\nabout the logistics of coaching so what\nif you don't Vibe with your coach what\ndo you do then can you switch them Swit\nswitch coaches what\nhappens uh so you can switch coaches I\nthink the best thing to do when that\nyou're not vibing or things aren't\nworking well is to actually like tell\nyour coach so the reason we have a lot\nof supports is so that we can handle it\nwhen y'all tell us things that are like\nnegative feedback um or positive\nfeedback sometimes the positive feedback\nis harder to deal within the negative\nfeedback but it's another\nstory yeah yeah talk you know i' say at\nleast as a first step unless you find\nyour coach for whatever reason is doing\nsomething horribly egregious uh is it\ntalk to your coach about it oh yeah and\nI uh wanted to say if there is something\nhorribly egregious like we've got an\nethic hotline um so we do a lot of\nsafeguards to make sure that people are\nsafe and because we are in a position of\npower in these um in these coaching\nroles yeah there's nothing going on oh\nsorry go ahead be no no you go please uh\ntalking to your coach about it\ndefinitely helpful because your coach\nmight be doing something that they don't\neven realize is like bothering you or\neven triggering you um and so telling\nthem or uh I've had that before where\nlike someone was doing therapy the same\nday as coaching so they would come into\ncoaching after therapy like being super\nexhausted and they're like maybe\ncoaching is not for me and I'm like well\nactually hang on maybe we could do a\ndifferent day and then things are\nusually better then or maybe it's\nsomething like you do need to switch\ncoaches because maybe I remind you of\nyour dad and that's a problem and I\ncan't control that right there's nothing\nto be done and so you just got to get\nsomeone new which is totally fine\ntotally\nunderstandable yeah yeah I'm just going\nto add to that then unless something\ncrazy is going on in which case the\nethics uh line um if it's just a fit\nproblem first I would recommend give\nyour coach a little chance like don't\ndecide that after the first session like\nyou don't know your coach yet um Rapport\nneeds to be built for both of you so if\nafter the first session you're like H\nI'm not too comfortable give your coach\na chance because we're all pretty\nadaptable so if you commun like like my\ncolleague said here if you communicate\nwhat you feel is not working and you\ntell your coach that we there's a high\nchance we may be able to like switch\nthings around and and work with you to\nmake it work and if after a little bit\nwe still kind of make it work or we\nremind you of your dad or something then\nwe can consider the transfer no\nproblem yeah or your coach will say you\nknow what you're entirely correct this\nis not a good fit like good on you\ncalling that out let's switch it up\nright now yeah like let's I'm going to\nput out a notice and like I'm going to\nbe specific with the the type of coach\nthat you might want to request\nyeah because what if the client reminds\nus of our\ndads or people it could happen to you it\ncould happen to\nanyone cool next question is super\ninteresting I think we have time for\nmaybe one or two more how many sessions\nto fix the\nissue what's the issue\nyeah that's\nit another trap question yeah so the way\nwe normally deal with trap questions is\nuh you know what would it mean to you if\nit took X number of sessions what would\nit mean to you if it took you know if we\nwere able to fix it in five minutes um\nhow fast would you like to fix it how\nfast do you expect to fix it\ny cool there's a demonstration for CH\nsome sometimes people will say things\nlike yeah I'm in academic triage mode\nI've been met I'm like on academic\nprobation I have very limited time and\nthat's actually kind of I'm like well we\ncan try like we can try to put it to the\npedal medal see what we can do but you\nknow we can't control the outcome all we\ncan control is the actions and our\nprocess yeah yeah like I get students\nwho who like I always like someone who's\nlike a student who's like failing and\nthey're like I need to get my\ntogether or like some or someone who's\nin a job where they're like afraid\nthey're about to lose it like I get\npeople in these scenario sometimes and I\nalways tell them I'm like hey you know\ncoaching is not like a crisis service\nlike if you need me on call like I can't\ndo that like we meet once a week my dude\num and I don't think coaching is the\nbest place to like save an immediately\ndrowning ship um because we only have so\nmuch access to each other it's very\nlimited um but you know for something\nmore sustainable long ter like I'm\nalways down to try like Allan said it's\nlike you know we could give it a shot\nbut I'm going to let you know I can't\nguarantee anything here and that's TR\nlike we we don't like we're useful and\nwe don't fix things which I think\nis hard to describe at least for me\npersonally it's like we don't fix\nanything but we are there and then\nthings get better and it's it's science\nsomehow and it's true um but anyway\nthat's all I have to say on\nthat sence yeah I feel\nlike I feel like um whenever someone\ncomes with like a deadline like hey I\nneed to pass this exam and you know I\njust came to coaching today's the first\nsession and and I need to pass in two\nweeks and I have been procrastinating\nfor six months and now come on Chop Chop\ntwo weeks we need to pass this exam\nright um like my like Alan and and and\npack said like I would give a shout it's\nlike sure sure dude two weeks big\ndisclaimer I do not perform Miracles but\nhey can drown you in resources here's\nlike all of the resources but I I cannot\nguarantee that you're going to have time\nto process them basically because like\nwe have two weeks and sometimes I've\nbeen working on this for months with\nother clients that are not in such a\nrush so I can draw your resources if you\nwant if you want techniques hey I can\ngive you the techniques but if they\ndon't work because of the time\nconstraint that canot be on\nme cool um I think last question just to\nwrap up what's the difference between\noneon-one and group and when should you\ndo whichever one you choose to do how do\nyou\nchoose I just I want to throw out a\ncaution okay because I and I understand\nwhy this happens I want to caution\npeople against thinking of group as a\ncheaper replacement to personal because\nthey're different and yes one is less\nexpensive they're not the same so I'll\nI'll let others kind of fill in some\ngaps there but that's my\ncaution super true if you have a ton of\nstuff uh to work through that like if if\nyou're if you go in a group and every\nweek you're like man I didn't really get\nto talk about my stuff you probably need\nto be in personal like because you're\nnot going to get to talk about your\nstuff every week in group um a lot of\nthe times it ends up in this like\nSpotlight style where one person goes\nand then next week someone else goes\nthen the next week someone else goes and\neveryone's just there to support them um\ndoesn't have to look like that but if\nyou have a lot on your plate that you're\ntrying to get through like yeah personal\nis um you can't really replace it group\nis like this sort of magical offshoot\nthat has similar things going on but is\nultimately there to help you teach\nsomething very specific and learn learn\nsomething specific and work through\nthose things um as this group of\nindividuals uh learning how to work\ntogether it's just it yeah they're not\nthe\nsame yeah if you go to group and you\nfeel every session you need the floor or\nelse you feel the session was a waste\nbecause you didn't get to like take the\nspot like every single week then group\nis not for you because you need to go to\ngroup with the understanding sometimes\nthe exensions of me all the times I'm\nthere to support others you need to war\nthat a little bit yeah you need to want\nto to be that person for another fellow\nhuman being several fellow human beings\nand if you just want your own problems\naddress but you don't want to take care\nof other people's problems or you don't\nwant to do the extra step of looking at\nyour own problems through the lens of\nsomeone else's by listening to someone\nelse's if you don't want to do that kind\nof work then group is not for you and\nand one one\nis yeah I've had a fair amount of\nclients who have done both and um the\nway they tend to describe it uh is that\npersonal coaching is in a way sort of\nthe easy mode I mean it's a challenge\nit's something that you know requires a\nlot of effort to get a lot out of it um\nbut who's responsible for change in\npersonal is the the coach and the client\n5050 and it can be actually a problem if\ncoaches feel like they're putting in\nlike 90% for group um everyone in the\ngroup is responsible for change\nhappening in the group and there's all\nkinds of different complications that\ncan come up so I I uh almost think about\ngroup as a kind of advanced form of\ncoaching it can be more fulfilling and\nmore rewarding for people in a lot of\nways um I think that hearing feedback\nand perspectives from a group member is\na lot different from a coach who's like\npaid to be there and to like be\nsupportive um so there's definitely\nbenefits to doing it but uh uh yeah I I\nI would Echo Julia's caution just\nbecause it's cheaper doesn't mean it's\neasier\num it's different easier or you'll get\nthe same benefit or the same sort of\nthings out of it yeah but you also get\nbenefits that you don't get from one one\nlike I've seen some growth in group that\nI would have never imagined would be\npossible in one\nonone yeah yeah there's just's something\nabout groups when there's this\nCollective uh like like everyone in the\ngroup is crying about like the same\nthing and that's that's different and\nthat's special and that's like wonderful\nand I think that sometimes there can be\num more more palpable sense of change\nfrom that sort of environment than there\nis from just kind of like duoing it with\na with a coach the when I've seen people\ndo both is where I've seen in personal\nit's like the day-to-day okay\nunderstanding myself how do I Walk\nThrough This World thing and then I'm\ngoing to go to group now and now that\nwe've talk spoken about these Tendencies\nI'm going to actually try it out in\ngroup because I I realize there's been\nthis thing I've been afraid of saying or\nwhatever and then now I'm going to try\nto say it to the group and like see what\nhappens um just as an\nexample yeah I'm not an expert on it but\nmy understanding is there is some\nresearch that suggest the most creative\nideas isn't really that related with\nsomething like IQ Beyond a certain level\nlike 104 that it's about the fruitful\nexchange between the center and the\nperiphery however you want to define\nthose and you get a lot more of that\nfruitfulness in group I think when you\ngot seven heads talking instead of just\ntwo the the critical hits in group are\nextraordinary compared to individual um\nthere's nothing like it it's just very\ndifferent um but again it's like an\nadvanced version of coaching it's it's\nkind of there big\ndifferences yeah group gr group also\ntends to take a little bit slower to\nramp up I think compared to person notot\na lot of first few sessions people are a\nlittle bit confused and they're kind of\nlike what is this and that's that's\ntotally\nnormal yeah if you sign off for group\nplease be patient it does take a little\ntime to take\noff\ncool um I know we're tiny bit over time\nany final thoughts before we wrap\nup\nnothing really comes I just\nfeel yeah I was just goingon to say\ngroup group is my favorite\nso I love Gro like I love group so\nmuch I I I don't know I don't have\nanything else I I'm just happy to be\nhere man awesome well thanks so much for\nyall's time this was awesome I hope chat\nalso liked it um and yeah thanks so much\nfor your valuable\nperspectives thanks for hosting thank\nyou for sure you take thank y all take\ncare bye thank\nyou all right\nchat how are\ny'all what did y all\nthink\nyeah so I I saw a bunch of questions in\nchat um just general logistic stuff\nabout coaching if youall want to sort of\npost them again I could take a quick uh\ncrack and answering them um so someone\nwas asking just how often coaching\nhappen so it's week to\nweek\num and yeah uh personal is 50 minutes\ngroup is 90 minutes um cuz there's more\npeople\ninvolved\num\nyeah cool let's\nsee I'm yet to know if this is for me or\nnot that's totally fine so this is not\nmeant to be like a hey you have to sign\nup for group no this is meant to be like\nhey this is this is a way to sort of\nwork on things you want to work on if\nyou want to work with someone and want\nto do it in lesser time then likely it\nwould take if you were to sort of go It\nAlone um yeah totally rad is asking is\nit weird to get one-onone in uh creative\ncoaching if you mean Creator coaching\nthey're both one-on-one types you get\nthe Creator expertise from Creator\ncoaching that's so that's the\ndifference is there specific age you\nhave to be an HG coach um I believe you\nhave to be at least\n18 but I'm not entirely sure about\nthat\ncool is there a Matchmaker processor to\nget a coach or is at random it's based\non your availability especially um yeah\nit's based on\navailability yeah coaches go through a\ncurriculum that's designed by Dr k um\nand has been sort of vetted by our\nmental health professionals that we have\non board as well and we have like office\nhours case review so coaches get a lot\nof\nsupport how do you determine if a client\nhas successfully completed\ncoaching um the client determines that\nif they feel that their goal has goals\nhave been met they're welcome to sort of\nfinish up and they're also welcome to\ncome back if they have other goals in\nthe\nfuture can I change from one-on-one\ncoaching to group without finishing the\npackage yes if you feel like a\nparticular coaching type isn't a good\nfit or you want to try something else\nyou can um sort of request or refund on\nyour unused sessions and switch to
