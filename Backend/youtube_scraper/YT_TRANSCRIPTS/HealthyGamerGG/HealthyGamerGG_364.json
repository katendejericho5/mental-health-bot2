    "transcript": "today I'm going to teach yall how to\nthink your way to\nhappiness now this may sound absolutely\ninsane because you may have heard\nresearch about what determines whether\npeople are happy so for example there\nare studies that show that if you make\n$100,000 a year or more then that\ncorrelates with happiness people who are\nin sexually fulfilling relationships are\nmore likely to be happy but there's a\nbig fundamental problem with the\nresearch we have on happiness which is\nthat it tells us who is happy not how to\nbecome happy so if you're sitting there\nreading this research right that says\nokay I need to make six figures and I\nneed to have a sexually fulfilling\nrelationship you can't really wake up\none day and say hey I'm going to make\nsix figures today and I'm going to find\na sexually fulfilling relationship the\nproblem with the research on happiness\nis it doesn't show us how to actually\nbecome happy and that's what I'm going\nto share with youall today hey y'all I\nwant to talk for a second about HG\ncoaching a lot of people wonder why do I\nneed to sign up for coaching can't I\njust DIY it can't I watch another\nYouTube video and you're right you can\nabsolutely do those things which is why\nwe offer those resources but one thing\nthat I found is that people who try to\ndo things by themselves take a really\nlong time to do it and my experience has\nbeen that the earlier that you get your\nlife together the better your life will\nbe so coaching is designed to not help\npeople treat Mental Illness but discover\nthings like what you want out of life\nwhat's holding you back how to conquer\nprocrastination and how to find\nmotivation and I have worked with each\nand every one of our coaches I work with\nthem for 8 weeks to make sure they're of\nthe highest quality and they really\nrepresent what we offer at HG so if yall\nare interested check out the link in the\ndescription below now it may sound kind\nof bizarre but it turns out that the\nmost important thing that you can\ncontrol for your own happiness is\nactually your thoughts now this may\nsound surprising because isn't happiness\nabout emotions because if I'm depressed\nand sad all the time and I wake up and I\nfeel ashamed of myself and I'm so\ndepressed and it's hard to get out of\nbed it's hard for me to be happy right\nthat makes perfect sense so isn't it\nabout emotion well it turns out that if\nyou look at research on Psychiatry and\nPsychotherapy that emotions are a big\npart of it but if you really look at\nwhat we do in Psychotherapy it's not\njust fixing emotions in fact the goal is\nto decompress emotions so that you can\nhelp your patient start to think clearly\nand the real change that we see happens\nwhen our patients start to think clearly\nand think in a healthier way now that\nmay sound kind of confusing because\nyou're kind of saying what does that\nmean to think in a healthier way how do\nI do that so let me give you all just a\nsimple example let's say I go through a\nbreakup this is a fact and since there's\na breakup my body has all kinds of\nphysiological attachments there's less\noxytocin maybe I get a drop in my\nserotonin level all kinds of stuff is\nhappening to me physically and\nemotionally but whether I'm happy or not\nafter the breakup depends on my thoughts\nso if after the breakup I start to think\nto myself oh my God I'll be alone\nforever my partner will be able to move\non because they're better looking and\neveryone is interested in them but I'm\nsuch a POS and no one's ever going to\nwant me those thoughts are going to keep\nus in a very unhappy place on the flip\nside if I am resilient and if my mindset\nis different and let's remember what is\nmindset it's actually thinking if my\nmindset is thinking I can think things\nlike hey you know this relationship was\nreally important to me it's sad I'm\ngoing to grieve and it's going to hurt\nfor a while but we grew up into\ndifferent people we've been dating for\nfour years and we have different views\non life so it's like it's okay for it to\nend now I appreciated it why it while it\nhappened and while it hurts it's\nprobably best for me in the long run\nsame situation same physiologic response\ntwo different modes of thinking and if\nwe look look at the evidence-based\npractice of psychotherapy what we find\nis that cognitive reframing which is\nliterally changing your thoughts is the\nmost effective or one of the most\neffective coping skills that you can\nteach someone as a\ntherapist just to contrast that people\nwho Focus exclusively on emotions tend\nto actually stay stuck so we even have\nresearch that shows that people who\nfocused on emotion focused coping which\nmeans that I'm going to just manage my\nemotions all the time I'm going to\nmanage my emotions all the time don't\nactually fix their problems it's the\npeople who are able to make cognitive\nshifts and look at the world in a\ndifferent way that are able to fix their\nproblems as well as become happier and\nfor some reason as a society we've sort\nof lost sight of how to think and how\nimportant thinking is so we're going to\nteach all a little bit about how to\ncultivate the right thinking so let's\nstart by understanding the precise\nsequence of thinking emotions and being\nunhappy\nso thankfully we have research on this\nwhere people have done even things like\nbrain scans and what we've sort of\ndiscovered is that the sequence of\nevents that lead to unhappiness start\nwith thoughts so what usually happens is\nI have a thought so the cognitive\nthought happens first and following the\nthought is an affective change which\nmeans an emotional response so I will\nthink to myself oh no I going to be\nalone after this breakup and the second\nI have that thought I will feel an\nemotional reaction\nthat thought will bring the sadness out\nand if you pay attention to your own\nexperience you'll find that usually\nnegative thoughts start first and then\nthey will activate emotions and then the\nemotions will spur more thoughts now\nthis is when we get into things like\nthought Loops right so I start to think\nto myself oh I start with I'm going to\nbe alone forever and then I feel sad and\nthen the sadness breathes more negative\nthoughts I start St stalking them on\nsocial media I start you know sitting\naround and like listening to sad music\nand there's some kind of like affective\nchange emotional change that then\npropagates further thoughts and youall\nmay have experienced this negative\nexperience of a thought Loop where you\ncan't stop your mind from thinking and\nwhen I worked with patients who have\nthought Loops like this what they want\nmore than anything else is to just stop\nthinking and instinctively they know\nthat the thinking is the problem and\nthis is why they reach for things like\nsubstances or video games or technology\nor whatever any kind of distraction to\nshut off the thoughts this is why people\nwill drink a lot of alcohol before they\npass out because I need to stop the\nthoughts I need to stop the thoughts and\nwhy do we reach for those kinds of\nthings because we haven't been trained\nat how to cultivate the right thoughts\nand it turns out that the scientific\nevidence mirrors people's experiences\nthat if we really look at the origin of\nmental illness it starts with a thought\nthen there's an emotional response and\nthen there is this really important step\ncalled a per peration or a rumination of\nthoughts and when the perseveration and\nrumination which means we keep thinking\nthe same thing Rises and Rises and Rises\nthat's what eventually leads to\nPsychopathology or mental illness so\nthought emotion more thoughts that we\ncan't break out of mental illness and so\nhow do we fix this situation it turns\nout that we've got one really\ninteresting option which is if you look\nin the history of the world in my\nopinion and I'm not an expert in all\nhistorical you know things everywhere I\nthink the yogis did a really fantastic\njob of figuring out how to cultivate the\nright thoughts so they came up with this\npractice called Mantra or Mantra and\nwhat they would do is they would engage\nwith a particular thought over and over\nand over again now mantras traditionally\nwere chanted but it turns out that\nchanting a mantra actually weakens its\npower if you look at some some of these\nold texts on Mantra what you'll find is\nthat the yogis will say any mantra\nthat's chanted if it is whispered under\nyour breath the power of the Mantra\nincreases tfold so instead of saying\nthings out loud we actually want to\nrepeat Them Softly to ourselves this is\nwhat the science of montra says and it\nturns out that there's a very\nfascinating neuroscientific correlation\nfor this so when we say things out loud\nthis is something called phenotyping and\nit actually happens from the cerebellum\nso it actually happens in a primitive\nstructure of our brain kind of in the\nback of our brain and if you look at\nsort of the subjectivity of saying\nthings out loud what you sort of find is\nwhen you're speaking you're not really\npaying attention right the two are sort\nof opposite you can go up and give a\nspeech and you're not really paying\nattention or listening to what you're\nsaying you can't listen and speak at the\nsame time which is what makes\nsocializing so damn hard because you'll\nsay something and hey did I say this\nalready did I not say it I wasn't really\npaying attention and that's literally\nbecause the cerebellum where phenotyping\nhappens where speech kind of\noperates is sort of short-term memory\nand so the the point of that part of our\nbrain is we're going to put some\ninformation in and then we're going to\nsend it out for the purpose of\ncommunication so here's what's really\ninteresting when we subvocalize which\nmeans we say things under our breath it\nactually activates a completely\ndifferent part of the brain and serves a\ncompletely different purpose it\nactivates our frontal loes especially\nour orbitofrontal cortex now this is\nkind of weird right so when we say\nthings out loud we're activating this\npart of the brain and when we say things\nsubvocally we're actually activating a\ncompletely different part and what is\nthis part responsible for so the orbital\nfrontal cortex and our frontal loes are\nresponsible for directing our Behavior\nthey're responsible for controlling the\nother parts of our brain and so it's\nkind of interesting but when we\nsubvocalize things it's not temporary\nand short term and go kind of goes out\nof the mouth and doesn't accomplish\nanything when we subvocalize things they\nactually sink deep deeper within us and\nso if you think about the people that\nyou know that are very vocal about their\npositivity and their thoughts right\nthey're like he like I'm going to be\npositive and the world is great and I'm\ngoing to advertise on social media I'm\ngoing to tell everyone be positive be\npositive be positive they all turn into\npassive aggressive narcissistic\nlike content creators and influencers\nwho are talking crap all the time about\npositivity but the moment they get upset\nby something and I guess I'm guilty of\nas well they rail at everyone else and\nall the positivity goes out the window\nyou may know these people who have all\nthis false positivity that they're\nadvertising all the time we even have a\nterm for it which is virtue signaling\nI'm going to signal to the rest of the\nworld that I am good in some way and\nthat will be a substitute for actual\nvirtue and it turns out that the yogis\nwere spoton that when we subvocalize it\nactually sinks into our mind and starts\nto shape our thoughts more and and you\nmay have sort of notied this when you\nmutter something under your breath who\nare you really talking to you're talking\nto yourself and it's kind of sinking\nfurther in and it turns out that when we\nsubvocalize it actually shapes our\nthinking much more profoundly than\nsaying something out\nloud now the next question kind of\nbecomes okay so even if we use this\ntechnique of subvocalization to implant\nthings into our mind how do I go about\ncognitively reframing how do I start\nthinking different things things for\nmyself and so this is a simple exercise\nthat I give to my patients and I can\nshare with you as well so the next time\nyou're in a situation which feels bad\nand your thinking is in the wrong kind\nof space what I want you to do is\npretend that you are talking to a friend\nof yours or a younger sibling or\nsomething like that and try to be as\nencouraging and compassionate as\npossible what would you say to this\nperson if they were going through the\nsame situation you were going through\nand this is where you know you'll you'll\nmuch more likely to be more forgiving be\nmore encouraging and be more\ncompassionate so you can even write down\nwhatever you would say to that person\nand kind of make a list of it or think\nthrough what you would say now this is\nwhere we're not really taught how to\nthink and this is where a lot of people\nwill trip up because when you try to say\nthe alternative the other part of your\nmind that is thinking negative thoughts\nwill start to fight it right so then you\nget this battle between your mind where\nthere's a part of you that's trying to\nbe positive and a part of you that is\nconsisting in negativity and then\nthere's conflict and then you kind of\nend up losing right because if it\napplies to you this kind of how this\nlooks so you'll let's say you got dumped\nright and so you tell your friend hey\nlike y'all grew into different people\ny'all grew apart it's okay you're a good\nperson you'll find somebody else that's\nyou'll say to someone else but then your\nmind will be like nuh-uh right that's\nfor other people in our case I'm\nsocially stunted I've been with this\nperson so long I don't even know how to\ndate I've gained 20 pounds and now I'm\nunattractive and I don't have an online\ndating profile and your mind starts\narguing with you and then what we try to\ndo is we try to fight that argument we\ntry to have the positivity win this the\nwhole thing is completely stupid and\nidiotic and we don't need to do it at\nall we can bypass the whole damn thing\nthrough subvocalization so this is the\nmain thing that we forget or we miss is\nthat you actually don't have to argue\nwith yourself you don't have to convince\nyourself of anything you don't have to\nsay anything to the negative part of you\nyou do not have to win with these\nthoughts all you need to do is\nsubvocalize them and this is how we\nliterally inject positive thoughts into\nour mind where they will start to live\nthis is what subvocalization does now\nthis may sound bizarre because you're\nsaying well hold on a second but I have\nall these experiences and I have all\nthese thoughts are you saying that I can\nkind of sub vocalize and literally\nchange my mindset honestly in the best\nexpertise that I have and based on all\nof my understanding of the literature\nyogic practice for about wow 20 years\nnow I think that's what's going to\nhappen and there's some really\ninteresting clinical evidence to support\nit and that comes from schizophrenia so\nthis is a little bit heavy but I want\nyouall to understand this when someone\nhas\nschizophrenia the thoughts in their head\nbecome a reality right so they have\ndelusions so what is a delusion is a\nthought in my head which I think is real\nbut it's not real and so I've had\npatients with schizophrenia literally\njump out of third story Windows because\nthe thoughts in their head were so\npowerful that that's what they thought\nthey needed to do to survive so I know\nit sounds kind of heavy but what we sort\nof know is that in schizophrenia the\nthoughts that they have are very shaping\nfor their lives now here's the Wild\nThing people with schizophrenia sub\nvocalize all the time there are studies\nwhich will analyze the electrical\nactivity of the tongue in patients with\nschizophrenia and what they found\nbecause when you subvocalize is you have\ntongue movement that's very very minor\nso you're speaking under your breath so\nit's not rapid tongue movement that's\nhow you can tell if someone's sub\nvocalizing you can measure tongue\nmuscles and so when these researchers\nactually looked at subvocalization in\nschizophrenia what they found are a\ncouple things people with schizophrenia\nsubvocalize a ton and furthermore the\nmore that they subvocalize the more\npowerful their distortions of reality so\nliterally there is a correlation between\nhow much people with schizophrenia\nsubvocalize and how much their thoughts\nwill shape their reality now the good\nnews is that this is true of all human\nbeings that as we subvocalize we\nactivate our orbitofrontal cores we\nactivate our frontal loes we take\nwhatever those thoughts are and we start\nto implant them and the other thing to\nkeep in mind is it's not about an\nargument and letting logic rise to the\nthought top that's not what we're\ntalking talking about here what we are\ntalking about is the implantation of\npositive thoughts so I know it sounds\ninsane but it turns out that our\nthoughts are actually the source of our\nhappiness the very first thing that\nhappens is a thought which then triggers\nan emotion which then triggers a thought\nLoop which then leads to mental illness\nand it turns out that you can implant\npositive thoughts fingers crossed here\nthrough this technique of sub\nvocalization definitely works for manra\nand me and the people that I've taught\nit to In terms of chanting this and that\nsort of changes their mindset it changes\nthe way that they look at things and\nonce you change the way that you look at\nlife it allows you to live life in a\nhealthier way so as crazy as that sounds\nI strongly encourage youall to try it\nand check it out and don't give up on\nthinking as a source of of happiness\nbecause if you stop and think about it\nwhat you really find is that when we\nstopped trying to think our way to\nhappiness is really when we've like lost\nthe the opportunity to think our way to\nhappiness right because we gave up on\nthat battle and that's why people are so\nunhappy today because we've surrendered\nour most powerful tool which is our\nthoughts now if y'all are interested in\nmore stuff like this different kinds of\nyogic and meditative thought control\ntechniques highly recommend youall check\nout Dr K's guide there's a guide to\nmeditation which will teach you some\nthere's a guy to ADHD and doing stuff\nwhich also teaches a lot about thought\ncontrol and how to cultivate the right\nright thought in the mind so yall can\ncheck that out for more info if you want\ngood\n[Music]\nluck"
