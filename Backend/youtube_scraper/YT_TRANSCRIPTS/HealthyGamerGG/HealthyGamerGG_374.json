    "transcript": "men are allowed to feel emotions except\nfor anger because when you feel anger\nyou're a toxic man what about shame oh\nas a man I feel pathetic I don't know if\nthis is ever going to work out I'm so\nsorry oh my God this guy is so\nemotionally needy I can't handle\n[Music]\nthis I'm Alice a 25 years old funloving\nand adventurous girl seeking a partner\nin crime to travel the world with and\nmake Unforgettable memories if you are\nnew here let me explain a few things you\ncan chat with me as much as you want and\nI'd be more than happy to learn more\nabout you and please you in any way I\ncan oh my goodness if you want me to\nsend you a photo you just have to ask it\nin the chat like hey Alice can you send\nme a picture of you and I'll be more\nthan happy to send you\none but of course to bump up from\ntexting to more voice chat as well as\nreceiving sexy and well other sorts of\npictures Alice asked that we become a\npremium member for $9.99 a month wow so\nwe bid her farewell but there are many\nwho are engaging the hill recently\npublished a piece by my next guest data\nscience Professor Liberty Vitter under\nthe headline AI girlfriends are ruining\nan entire generation of men she wrote\nThe Following apps have created virtual\ngirlfriends that talk to you love you\nallow you to live out your erotic\nfantasies and learn through data exactly\nwhat you like and what you don't like\ncreating the perfect relationship and\nthat young lonely men quote are choosing\nAI girlfriends over real women meaning\nthey don't have relationships with real\nwomen don't marry them and then don't\nhave and raise babies with them as I've\ndiscussed here before we're living in an\nepidemic of loneliness among young men\nProfessor Scott Galloway told me that\nfailing young men he perceives to be an\nexistential crisis for the country why\nwell Pew found that 63% of young okay so\nlet's pause for now so the first thing\nto understand is that people will say\nthings like this they will say AI AI\ngirlfriends are ruining a generation of\nmen oh my\nGod first thing to understand is they're\nnot ruining the generation is already\nruined that's why AI girlfriends have a\nare in the market yall get that this is\nnot causing the damage this is the end\nstage of renal failure right this is\nlike the end we're already there the\nruining is already happen which is why\npeople are vulnerable to this this is\nthe other crazy thing I don't know if\nyall saw this but this AI I want y'all\nto pay attention Okay so this is going\nto be crazy I want you to look up here\ntell me what you see in the domain name\n cupid. A with a\nK so let me ask y'all a question\nchat if this domain name is cupid. a\nwith a K why isn't it cupid. a with with\na\nc what do youall think it's because\nthat's right someone else reserved that\ndomain name and has a competing product\nso if you have something in the market\nlet me explain something to y'all the\nthing in the market is not usually\nruining something it is fulfilling a\nmarket need that exists that's how like\nproduct development works right we're\ngoing to look for a market need and so\nwhat people have discovered is that oh\n there's a general ation of lonely\nmen who are\n right so we're going to get\nthrough some statistics with this guy\nand we'll see exactly how and why and so\nthe first thing to understand is that AI\nis not ruining a generation of men the\nruining is already happened they're\nalready ruined hey y'all I want to take\na second to talk to you about HG\ncoaching when I started streaming I got\nthousands of requests every month for\npeople to want to work with me\npersonally and I felt so overwhelmed I\nwent to a friend of mine who was also\npsychiatrist and said I don't know what\nto do about this and they jokingly said\nwell the only thing you can do is\nduplicate yourself and that's exactly\nwhat I tried to do with our coaching\nprogram I took the essence of everything\nthat I learned in India and all of my\nunderstanding of yoga and then combined\nit with the latest evidence-based\ntechniques on behavioral change and\nthat's how our coaching program was born\nI do my best to work with each one of\nour coaches for a period of 8 weeks to\nmake sure they understand really what\nwe're trying to teach and how we're\ntrying to help people so if you're\ninterested in working with someone who's\ngoing to understand who you are\nunderstand your barriers and help you\nformulate a plan to overcome yourself\nand build the life that you want\ndefinitely check out our coaching\nprogram the link is in the description\nbelow and good luck one in five American\nmen who are unmarried and not in a\nromantic relationship report not having\nany close friends and according to Pew\nthere's a decline in the number of\nsingle men actively seeking\nrelationships or even casual dates\ncurrently around 50% so let's pause for\na second and address this too so let's\nunderstand like okay what's going on\nwith the ruining of men so what is this\npromise of the AI the promise of the AI\nis oh my God if you try to communicate\nwith me I will communicate back so\neveryone is like oh my God there're\nnudie pics I don't know if yall get this\nI don't know if y'all been to this place\ncalled the internet but finding a\npicture of boobs or penis or whatever\nyour flavor may be is not that difficult\nthere are in fact I know it's shocking\nentire\nwebsites that have more pictures of\nnudity than you can literally look at\nfor the rest of your life there is more\nnakedness out there on the internet on a\nsingle\nwebsite then you will like you can\nliterally look at that every second of\nevery day for the rest of your life\nyou'll never watch it all so everyone's\nlike oh my God they're just going to\nsend nudie pics oh my God that's with\nruing men cuz men pivots no what does an\nAI girlfriend do oh my god oh oh\n it's ruining men what do the AI\ngirlfriend do she\nresponds oh oh there's\nactually something out there that is\ngoing to\nrespond when someone says something\nSociety is going to fall\napart like what the\n this is how bad things have become\nright because what is it that men are\nlooking for what is it they don't get\nand this this guy did a good job he's\nlike 50% of men I guess are not even\ntrying to date we'll get to that in a\nsecond and like why not it's\nbecause it doesn't work it's because\nit's painful it's because people aren't\ninterested right so like what am I going\nto do I'm going to throw in the towel\nand here comes the cupid with a k.\na offering\nthe forbidden fruit which is interaction\nwith a digital entity because I can't\nget interaction with a human entity and\nif I can't get that then like hold on a\nsecond I wonder like where what what\nexactly is ruined so not to be puant at\nthis time of day but are all the needs\nof these young men able to be\nfacilitated taken care of by AI avatars\nwell you have to think about this word\nAI that is in this it's not a virtual\ngirlfriend it's an AI girlfriend so it\nlearns from you it learns what you like\nand what you don't like what kind of\npictures you like what kind of pictures\nyou don't like and well not oh my God\nshocking hold on a second chat let's\nmake sure we understand this\nproperly what is so Insidious about the\nAI\ngirlfriend the Insidious thing about the\nAI girlfriend is that it pays attention\nto\nyou it may give you things it learns\nwhat you like and it adapts oh my God\nthe world is coming to an end because it\npays attention and it does things that\nyou will\nlike oh my God that sounds devastating\nnot all needs are met that is the next\nstep is actual physical girlfriends uh\nAI ones for that matter and so the next\nstep or the next Frontier is one that\ncan meet all of your\nneeds so there's going to be\nsome type of pairing between what I've\nalready shown to the CNN audience and\nsomething 3D that's going to be living\nroom or bedroom yes I mean that's that\nis the world we are moving into and as\nyou said it's enabling this entire\ngeneration of young men to continue in\nthis loneliness epidemic it's it's\nreally the enabler for this to continue\nhold on a second so this we got to talk\nabout so let's understand this\nokay I think technically it's a correct\nstatement but hold on a second how did\nwe get here in the first place right so\nthis this epidemic was not created by AI\nit may further whatever the problem is\nwhich I think is a fair take it's not\nsomething that I necessarily agree with\nbut how do we get here in the first\nplace because the real root of the\nproblem is how we got here in the first\nplace which is that apparently it is\nridiculous for a man to\nbe responded to and also for an external\norganism whether that be an artificial\nintelligence or human being to pay\nattention to what they like and offer it\nto them to adapt right this is these are\nthe two big draws Professor what's going\non with young women if this is a trend\namong young men is there something\nsimilarly taking place with the ladies\nwe don't see that you know with with as\nyou saw it's two to one the ratio of\nsingle men to single women young women\nare marrying older men because they want\nto have children they have a biological\nclock and so you see them them being\nwith older men and that is obviously\ncausing huge issues with birth decline\nwe've had a 50% decline over the past 60\nyears because women go with older men we\nalso see psychological wait I don't know\nthat a 50% birth decline has to do with\nwomen choosing older men that doesn't I\nthink it probably has to do with the\ndevelopment and spread of birth control\nand women choosing not to have more\nbabies that younger women they have more\nclose friends they have wider groups of\nfriends and they are not being nearly as\naffected as young men in this sort of\nSilent epidemic of loneliness I don't\nthink we're in a silent epidemic of\nloneliness I think the reason we call it\nsilent is because no one is listening to\nthe\nscreaming there's a big difference\nbetween\nsilence and turning down the volume on\nsomebody screaming I think we've seen\nthis epidemic for quite a while and it's\nfar from Lonely the only problem is we\njust don't pay attention to it right am\nI crazy there that this is not like\nsilent like am I crazy here that we have\nlike studies and and things like you\nknow the pre PR Research Center and\nwe've got lots of information about how\nmen are lonely am I crazy here that like\nif you look at Tinder\nstatistics we know that you know you\nhave to look at 10,000 people to get\nlike one date if you're lucky like I\ndon't think this is silent I think we\njust haven't been paying attention or\nwhat's actually more Insidious which is\npart of the reason that I think a lot of\ndudes have pieced out is that it's we've\njust been ignoring them and so like at\nsome point you're going to stop talking\nright guys who are angry about it I\nthink their argument is that women today\nare less approachable has something\nhappened has something shifted in terms\nof the Dynamics the power dynamics\nbetween young men and young women I\nguess that's my question I think there's\ncertainly an argument there that I mean\nif you look at college campuses there's\nmore women than men women are having\ncareer years they're having children\nlater so there might be an argument that\nmen need to adapt to this change in\nwomen but uh calling it women's fault I\ndon't think is probably the right way to\ngo yeah so I think that's a great\nstatement I didn't really interpret that\nas calling it women's fault but let's\nunderstand something okay so for the\ndudes out there change in expectations\ncompletely agree but something has very\nimportant which I think for the most\npart is positive has happened with women\nover the last 50 years okay and maybe\nI'm about to get banned but let's see so\nwhat's happened is that in the past if\nyou were a woman living in this world in\norder to have your needs met you had to\nbe in a romantic relationship okay same\nsame was true for a man so like human\nbeings were more dependent on each other\nso this isn't even specific to women so\nwhat's happened as any part of society\nbecomes more independent and therefore\nless dependent on another part of\nsociety now the whole equation changes\nit's not I don't need you to make me\nhappy anymore now the question is does a\nrelationship at all or relationship with\nyou is it more trouble than it's worth\nso I think one of the biggest problem\nthat a lot of men don't get they're like\noh my God like women won't give me a\nchance and it's like no I think women\nfrequently will give men lots of chances\nit's just sometimes they end up dating a\nlot of Manchild and it's just not worth\nit like it's just not worth it to be in\nthis relationship I do not get more out\nof it than I put in the amount of stress\nthat I have to deal with is not worth\nwhat I get out of it now this equation\nused to be really different when we had\nsort of more divided gender roles and\nyou kind of like needed the man to make\nmoney right so that's what the man\nbrought to the relationship so now the\nequation has changed it's not she's not\nlike cuz the the thing is this what's\nreally wild this is what's really scary\nfor a lot of men is that I think a lot\nof women are actually okay being by\nthemselves so now the question becomes\nif you want to be in a relationship you\nhave to like offer something substantial\nright and and that's like it it's kind\nof weird but it's not like one person is\nto blame or one gender is to blame or\nanything like that I think that's very\nharmful like because that's not how it\nthat's not how a relationship Works a\nrelationship is between two people and\nso anytime you blame the other people oh\nmy God women I don't is there an\nepidemic of loneliness absolutely is it\nsilent I don't think so has this been\ngoing on for a while yeah do men get\nscrewed in a lot of ways absolutely but\nI don't think it's the fault of women\nthat is a logical step which I think we\nneed to be very careful about making if\nyou really want to know what's going on\nthe world is changing and the basic\nproblem is that the expectations that we\nhave for men are not changing so if you\nlook at the research on perfectionism\nperfectionism has increased by about 30\nto 40% in the last 30 years\nperfectionism has increased in men more\nthan women and the perfectionism that\nmen experience is this very specific\nkind of perfectionism of I am going to\nbe unable to live up to the standards\nthat are expected of me this is a\ngigantic epidemiologic shift a 30 to 40%\nincrease of human primarily men who\nbelieve that I can no longer fulfill the\nexpectations that the world sets on me\nand that's true right why do people feel\nthat way because it's usually people\nfeel away because there's some truth to\nit so I'll give you all a simple example\nso women have started earning more good\nthat's a good thing we want equality\ngenerally speaking I'm in favor of that\nokay now here's the interesting thing is\nthat there's an attitude that I want my\nmale partner to make more than me so if\nyou ask I think the majority of women\nthey will say that now things are a\nlittle bit tricky because there more\nwomen in college more women get Advanced\ndegrees there are more women in medical\nschool right so a lot of these women who\nwant to marry doctors like the pool of\nmale doctors is shrinking so now the\nquestion becomes do you want to adjust\nyour expectations and this is the\nproblem that men are experiencing is\nthat there's no adjustment of\nexpectations even though the world has\nchanged so I'll give you all another\ngood example of this people are saying\nlike Okay like men need to be\nemotionally available number one thing I\nsee when I'm trolling around on my\nsingle friends dating profiles of what\nwomen are looking for top things that\nfloats to the surface maybe this is just\na subset of people I hang out with is\nemotionally available men right cuz men\nshould get in touch with their emotions\nbut if you really look at how we judge\nmen for getting in touch with their\nemotions it's not very good and you may\nsay no Dr K like no we're like totally\nfine accepting men's emotions no we are\nnot we are okay accepting one emotion\nfrom men which is sadness now thankfully\nin the last 30 years it's okay for a\ndude to cry but do we accept a a man's\nanger no that's what we call toxic\nmasculinity men are allowed to feel\nemotions except for anger because when\nyou feel anger you're a toxic man toxic\nmasculinity bad man for feeling anger\nyou should be crying instead how dare\nyou get upset what about shame oh as a\nman I feel pathetic I don't know if this\nis ever going to work out I'm so sorry\noh my God this guy is so emotionally\nneedy I can't handle this it's not my\nresponsibility to patch up this man and\nthe crazy thing is you're not wrong\nthere right if that's what you're saying\nit isn't your responsibility no sing\nsingle human being is responsible for\nfixing another human being and this is\nwhere we come back to is it worth it for\na woman to be in a relationship or not\nbecause a lot of times what\nrelationships for women mean is since\nwe've got a society of screwed up men\nwhat that means is that there's a\ncertain amount of like you got to play\nmedic right so if you're like a woman in\na relationship because of something\naround parenting and we'll get to some\nof these macro factors in a second it's\nlike you got to be 50% medic and 50%\ngirlfriend and some women especially now\njust don't want to sign up for that\nright like there's some of y'all that\nwant to be a savior and and heal someone\nwhich is cool also leads to problems in\nrelationships but this is a problem so\nwe're okay with men being sad thankfully\nbut we're not okay with them expressing\nother emotions because those are those\nare weak those are toxic masculine\nespecially the anger one that one's the\none that's the craziest it's also the\nemotion that men have the most access to\nso when we say we're going to\nemotionally accept men we're going to\nemotionally accept a minority of your\nemotional experience right so just to\ngive you all an example if you have a\nrelationship with there two people and\none person gets angry and one person\ncries what is the Judgment that we place\non those negative emotions what we\nalways do is we value the sadness over\nthe anger we don't say that you have a\nright to be angry if you're angry and\nthis person is crying you did something\nbad we place a value on sadness that is\nabove anger and if two negative emotions\nCollide sadness always wins and then if\nwe look at differentials in the way that\ndifferent genders Express emotions women\nare more likely to cry and men are more\nlikely to get angry and this is why men\nare scared to go to coup's therapy\nbecause they are outgunned because we\ndon't treat all negative emotions the\nsame we treat the ones that are\nmasculine more predominantly masculine\nas negative and this by the way also\nscrews women because the worst thing\nthat you can be is a woman who expresses\na masculine emotion that's the worst we\ntreat men harshly for it but we treat\nwomen even worse because now suddenly\nyou're a cold at work because you\ngot pissed the same way that a male\ncolleague did we do not allow women to\neven express anger right and if you're\nlike a woman and you get mad at someone\nand someone else starts crying and it's\nlike oh my God how heartless are you oh\nmy God there's a word right we we we use\nthe word we use the word cold we\nuse the word heartless there's a\nparticular idea that we have around\npeople and so this isn't like anti-men\nor anti-women or anything like that like\nI don't think that that's productive\nlet's understand what's actually going\non but this is where we get to this this\nissue of expectations because if we're\ntalking about equality equality means\nequality equality means are you okay\nwith the stay-at-home dad are you okay\nbeing the sole bread winner and working\ntwo jobs and doing overtime while your\nhusband goes to the gym and takes care\nof your kids as a dude can you put that\non your dating profile not interested in\na career not interested in financial\nIndependence I'm looking for someone to\ntake care of me because I am beautiful\nand I deserve it like I'd love to see an\nexperiment where someone actually did\nthat and we'd see what happens but but\nthe basic problem is that the world has\nchanged but our expectations of men have\nnot and as a result there's a gap that\nmakes it impossible for men to live up\nto expectations and then we have this\nother parallel thing going on which is\nthat it you and this is where things\nkind of get connected so let me just\nexplain right so hopefully I'll see this\nbut in this whole point about what do\nyou bring to the relationship so what\nmen you need to bring more to a\nrelationship now than you used to\nbecause the woman doesn't need 50k a\nyear because she can make 50k a year\nherself can to add value to the\nrelationship you need to bring 100K you\nneed to bring emotional availability you\nneed to bring all this other stuff that\nwe were never taught how to bring that's\nthe other thing right so as men like\nwhat are we taught we're taught that hey\nif you feel bad the only thing you're\nallowed to express is anger you can't\ncry that's shameful you know and your\nvalue is determined by what you bring to\nthe table right 6 feet 6 in six figures\ntwo of those you probably can't control\nso you focus on money and this is a\nproblem that women had worse I think a\ncouple years ago so back when like and\nwe still see it like women in finance\nwho are having babies later because they\ncan't afford to have them earlier\nbecause they have a boss who's also a\nwoman and I swear most of my female\npatients most of the gender\ndiscrimination based on my small sample\nsize I'm not citing this scientifically\nthe majority of gender-based\ndiscrimination that my Pat my female\npatients have experienced in the\nworkplace is from other women and at the\ntop of the list the most resentful piece\nof gender-based discrimination that I\nhave seen against women in the workplace\nthe most toxic is I had to wait until 36\nbefore I had my first child how dare you\nthink about having a child at the age of\n25 you don't get to do that I made the\nsacrifice and since I made the sacrifice\nyou're going to make it too so toxic the\nwhole point is that we were supposed to\nmake things better for women so that\nthey could make different choices it's\nnot to propagate the cycle of abuse\nright and if if those of y'all I know\nlike 70% of our audience is dudes this\nis something that y'all need to\nunderstand right like yeah we're\nas dudes because of loneliness but it's\nnot like women have it easy they made\nprogress but it's not like they have it\neasy I don't think anyone in life has it\neasy I mean maybe some people do who\nknows I'm sure objectively people have\nit easier I don't think it's helpful\nWe're All in This Together the next\nthing to understand is why are men\nlonely in the first place like what\nhappened so I think this has a couple of\ninteresting things the first is at some\npoint I really think the root of this is\nreally bizarre is when we started\ndemonizing\nhomosexuality so when I was growing up\nin the ' 80s and '90s\nthe biggest insult you could get was to\nbe called Gay it was like oh my God and\nso when we started demonizing especially\nhomosexuality what started happening is\nmen stopped being able to touch each\nother right which even if you're\nlistening to this now if you had an like\nan instinctive reaction dudes touching\neach other dick if you had that kind of\nreaction you're conditioned just like I\nam right it's a completely benign\nstatement there's nothing sexual about\nit but we sexualized it we sexualized\nall Manon man contact and that too man\non\nmen right I can hear the thoughts in my\nhead as I react to them as I say these\nthings so now men become dependent on\nwomen for touch and Men start isolating\nfrom each other that with the\ndestruction of third spaces right so\nthat combines with technology to where\nnow we're doing everything online so we\nhave even less connection with other\npeople especially men and then somewhere\nin that vein we also saw a loss of\npositive male role models so if you look\nat this is kind of a stretch but it's\ncool research so here we go so if you\nlook at delinquent Behavior amongst male\nelephants cuz male elephants who are\nadolescence can be real the\nnumber one thing that shapes whether\nthat male elephant learns how to behave\nproperly is the presence of a senior\nmale the older men put the young men in\ncheck this has disappeared from our\nsociety I don't know why but positive\nmale role models I have all kinds of\nideas watch why so one thing is that\nonce again we're very very quick to\njudge men I know this sounds crazy who\nare like who will touch a child right so\nlike when I go to a playground if\nthere's like a six-year-old boy who's\ncrying I can't pick him up and hug him\nand give him a kiss on the head even\nthough that's what my parental instinct\ntells me to do so we don't allow men to\ntouch boys which there may be good\nreasons for but even if there are good\nreasons for that we still have to deal\nwith the consequences of making that\nchange right because sexual predation is\na real thing and\nmost of the sexual predation that was\nhappening that was not we were not aware\nof I don't know about most but was\nespecially like we're talking about\ntaking advantage of young boys and and\noften times adult men doing that so like\nthere's a reason why we're worried about\nthat right that's not we're not making\nthat crap up and so what happened is as\nmen is we we stopped having solid\nrelationships with like role models we\nstopped being physically in touch with\neach other or emotionally in touch with\neach other and there's some amount of\nequality that has happened which have\nmade made women less dependent on us so\nnow what happens if you're a dude is you\nreally have to bring something to the\ntable you can't autopilot that\n anymore that on top of unrealistic\nexpectations which have not adjusted\nresults in the crisis of men that we\nhave today which is that I can try my\nhardest and it won't be enough I'm doing\nit alone because I can't connect to\nother people I have no place to connect\nto other people and the primary result\nof this is too much internal emotion and\nthat internal emotion is not something\nthat I'm allowed to share and that's\nwhat the problem is and now you take a\ndude like this and you offer him an AI\ngirlfriend and what do you expect him to\ndo so I'm alone people don't respond\nwhen I communicate with them oh my God\nso addictive someone responds back\npeople don't adapt to what I'm saying\nthere's not a silent epidemic on\nloneliness we've been screaming for a\nwhile and no one has been paying\nattention male suicide rates have been\nfour times what women female suicide\nrates are for like at least 100 years\nhow's that silent and what we end up\nwith is someone who wants nothing more\nthan someone to respond and someone to\npay attention and heaven forbid adapt to\nwhat I want in life and when we say that\nthis is going to enable or ruin men it's\nnot going to enable a ruin I mean maybe\nit'll enable some but the ruining is\nalready happened we're already here\nthey're already this desperate for a\nconnection to anything out there that\nthey'll take something digital and fake\nthis is how bad we are and so the\nquestion is like okay even if you say\nthat AIS are going to enable it what are\nwe going to do are we going to stop\ndoing AIS are we going to fix the\nproblem well that's the that's the\nreason the problem hasn't gotten fixed\nbecause no individual person is\nresponsible for it right if a man is\nangry I don't need to listen to them I\ncan block them if a man is ashamed of\nthemselves I'm not responsible for\nfixing it if you are a woman who's in\ntheir late 20s there is a decent chance\nthat you have already had one child even\nif you've never had a kid you've had a\nbaby brother you've had a dad you've\nbeen parentified because your dad is\ninfantilized Right you've already been a\nparent and what you want in a partner is\nnot another kid but here's the thing\nit's not the man's fault that they're a\nchild totally fair it's also not your\nresponsibility as a woman to fix them\nalso totally fair so now the question is\nwhat do we do and this is where what I\nthink we need to do as a society is\neverybody needs to take responsibility\nthe men need to take responsibility the\nmen who are not alone need to take\nresponsibility and women need to take\nresponsibility non-binary people\ngrandparents whoever the because\nwhen there is a part of our society that\nis suffering one thing that makes me\nproud to be human is thankfully human\nbeings usually are involved in helping\nthe people who are downtrodden the story\nof our race right if you look at the\nEqual Rights Movement if you look at the\nCivil War in the United States you had\npeople on the opposite side supporting\nyou had men supporting the Civil Rights\nMovement you have men who are feminists\nthese are good things this is how it\nshould be any part of our society that\nis downtrodden or neglected should get\nthe help of everybody else even though\nit is not their responsibility this is a\nchoice we have to make and the crazy\nthing this is what I think really puts\nthe pin in it is that there's one class\nof people who we societally expect to\nfix their own problems without help and\nthat is men and that is the root of the\nproblem because everyone else deserves\nhelp but right now there is a dialogue\ngoing on that since men are privileged\nin some ways which is true by the way\nright there are real scientific evidence\nthat people that men are privileged in a\nlot of ways but since they are\nprivileged they don't need our help and\nso you can look at like the percentage\nof white men in the United States who\nare CEOs but they're also like 99% of\nbrick layers are like white men the\nmajority of people who suffer workplace\ninjuries are men there are all kinds of\nother things like the privilege is there\nand even if you take a poor white dude\nwho gets pulled over by a cop compared\nto a poor black dude the poor white dude\nI believe I'm not an expert on the\nresearch so correct me if I'm wrong here\nbut I think the poor white dudee is\ngoing to have better outcomes that\nexists but that doesn't mean that that\ndude's life is easy right and this is\nthe key Nuance that I don't think we see\nenough of that you can have some\nadvantages in life and still need help\nthat advantages in one area of your life\ndon't make it easy in other areas of\nyour life and it's true of women as well\nso there are for example womenonly\nscholarships and yet women are already\nmore than 50% of people who go to\ncollege and just because that is true\nand that women may have an advantage\nwhen it comes to admissions scholarships\nor whatever doesn't mean that it isn't\ndangerous to be a woman so if you want\nto talk about a real big source of male\nprivilege it is the sense of safety so\njust being existing as a woman in the\nworld today there is a fundamental\nunsafe about it which is just what I've\nobserved right so I'm not a woman so I\ndon't really know but I just kind of\nnoticed that when I have male patients\nand I have female patients the male\npatients like aren't worried about being\nsexually assaulted on a day-to-day basis\nthey don't get worried about being\nsexually assaulted when they're walking\ndown the street and it's dark at night\nand those fears are real and so this is\nthe problem is we don't really\nunderstand that like you know we're not\nwe're not like it's not a video game\nwhere everything balances out and you've\ngot 40 points to distribute into various\nadvantages and disadvantages that's not\nhow it works and it's not like some\npeople just have it I mean some people\ndo have it better I think when we're\ntalking about classes of people everyone\nsuffers in a particular way and what we\nreally need to do is instead of making\nit a competition where like you know men\ndie more in workplace injuries so\ntherefore this thing about women we\nshould not take seriously that needs to\nstop we need to stop trying to combine\nall the issues into one equation that\ncomes to like perfect equality and\ninstead what we need to do is listen to\nwhoever is saying I'm having a hard time\nand take that person seriously right and\nthat's where like believe women and me\ntoo came from because for a long time by\nthe way there was not a silent epidemic\nof sexual assault towards women the same\nway that there is not a silent epidemic\nof loneliness there's been screaming\nfrom the rooftops we just chose not to\nlisten and now the real test of Society\nis going to be can we take all the\nlessons that we have learned from the\nprogress of women and apply those things\nto men that's the real question that I\nsee today because thankfully they've\nactually they did the hard part they\ntrailblazed and fought for equality so\nnow we know what equality looks like and\nare we going to continue to apply\n[Music]\nit\na"
