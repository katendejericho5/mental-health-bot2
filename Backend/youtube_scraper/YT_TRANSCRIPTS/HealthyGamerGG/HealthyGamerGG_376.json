    "transcript": "so we know for example that breath has a\nreciprocal relationship with emotion\nwhen I start feeling a particular way I\nwill start breathing a particular way so\nif I like start breathing like\nthis what do you all think I'm feeling\nright now and on the flip side I can\nstart breathing like\nthis and if you start hyperventilating\nhyperventilate with me for a\nsecond you start to feel like really\nuncomfortable right you can induce that\ndiscomfort fort with your breath and the\nflip side of it is also true that if you\ntake a long deep breath and what we\nreally want to do is focus on long\nexhalations if you change your breath\nthe emotions will change with it so if\nyou're feeling overwhelmed you can even\nsee pay attention to my voice right I\ncan feel myself calming down with a\nsingle breath my voice is changing my\ntone is changing and it's literally that\nsimple the more you practice it the\nbetter you'll be"
