    "transcript": "do you think we're bad people because of\nuh when we stream like we're narcissists\nso let's understand something so if we\nlook at the emergence of narcissism\nnarcissism is a defense mechanism and\nwhen you are a human being who doesn't\nget to be a human being and you're\nconstantly judged there's literally like\na number right now that determines how\nvaluable you are right and that number\ngoes up and that number goes down and so\nwhat happens is like the more that your\nlife is tied to the streaming like your\nsense of identity is solely based on\nbeing a content creator and then as that\nnumber goes up or down like it sort of\ncreates this like narcissism because you\nfeel like you're a good person or not a\ngood person depending on how well you're\ndoing but can't that be said in the real\nworld where people have to their jobs\nmaybe it's because it's a little more\nstrict maybe it's like anyone in\nentrepreneur like entrepreneur yeah so\nso I think the big difference is that if\nyou look at what not not to be rude but\nno be as rude as you want what what else\ndo you have in your\nlife"
