    "transcript": "today we're going to learn how to take\nthe curse of perfectionism and turn it\ninto a\n[Music]\nblessing so we have to start by\nunderstanding where perfectionism comes\nfrom and usually perfectionism comes\nfrom very very high or unreachable\nstandards when we're growing up so this\ncan look like parents who want you to be\nperfect all the time and won't settle\nfor anything less than 100% sometimes\nthis also looks like a situation\nof Golden Boy syndrome or even having an\nolder brother who's a golden boy or\nGolden Girl your older brother or sister\ndid a great job at this went to Harvard\nwas valedictorian did this got married\nat the right time had kids at the right\ntime and so you've got really big shoes\nto fil and so what is a child in that\nsituation learn how does the brain adapt\nto that that situation what the brain\nlearns is to avoid the pain of falling\nshort hey y'all I want to talk for a\nsecond about HG coaching a lot of people\nwonder why do I need to sign up for\ncoaching can't I just DIY it can't I\nwatch another YouTube video and you're\nright you can absolutely do those things\nwhich is why we offer those resources\nbut one thing that I found is that\npeople who try to do things by\nthemselves take a really long time to do\nit and my experience has been that the\nearlier that you get your life together\nthe better your life will be so coaching\nis designed to not help people treat\nMental Illness but discover things like\nwhat you want out of life what's holding\nyou back how to conquer procrastination\nand how to find motivation and I have\nworked with each and every one of our\ncoaches I work with them for eight weeks\nto make sure they're of the highest\nquality and they really represent what\nwe offer at HG so if y'all are\ninterested check out the link in the\ndescription below if we look at the\nbrain there are actually two kinds of\nperfectionism there's personal standard\nperfectionism which is sort of the\nstandard that you set for yourself and\nalways wanting to be better and then\nthere's also something called external\nconcern perfectionism so this is\nperfectionism that is rooted in the\nopinions of others everyone around you\nexpects you to be perfect or you want to\nbe perfect for their sake in an order to\nmake them happy and it's this ECP this\nexternal concern perfectionism that is\nusually damaging and sabotaging and in\norder to understand how we have to sort\nof come back to the roots of\nperfectionism so if you're highly\nperfectionistic chances are you grew up\nin a situation where there were\nunrealistic standards so this can look\nlike harsh narcissistic or tiger parents\nwho expected you to be perfect and no\nmatter how hard you try they were always\ndisappointed or if you did perfect\nthat's the norm so if you were at the\ntop of your class that's just what they\nexpect that's the Baseline and so if you\nsort of think about perfectionism you\ncan either do normal or you can\ndisappoint there's no way to make your P\nparents proud if they're expecting you\nto be at the top of the class all the\ntime sometimes this also happens in a\ncase of like Golden Boy or golden girl\nwhere you have an older brother or\nsister who did awesome right so really\nharsh parents really high expectations\nand your sibling knocked it out of the\npark which means now you're expected to\ndo it too because your parents have\nunrealistic expectations but they were\nable to pull it off so now you should be\nable to pull it off the end result\nthough is that you grow up in a\nsituation where you can't win the best\nyou can do is break even or lose and\nwhat does that do to the brain it turns\nout that personal standard perfectionism\nand external concern perfectionism\nactually live in different parts of the\nbrain external concern perfectionism\ncomes from this part of our brain called\nthe medial frontal gyrus you don't need\nto worry about where the neuro Anatomy\nis the important thing is what the\nmedial frontal gyrus is for in what it\nactually does so this is a part of our\nbrain that redirects attention it\nactually shifts attention away from what\nwe're doing right now to something else\nnow this may sound kind of weird but\nthis is where thankfully we've got good\nscientific experiments that explain how\nthis works so a group of researchers\ntook a group of people who were high in\npersonal standard perfectionism or PSP\nversus people who had high ECP and then\nthey gave them a task in which you make\nmistakes and then they measured the\nbrain activity for both of these groups\nof people when they were making mistakes\nand here's what they discovered so when\nsomeone who is external concern\nperfectionism is high right you've had\nthese crippling parents who were always\ntrying to you to be perect and you could\nnever do good enough what these people\nend up doing is anytime they make a\nmistake the medial frontal gyrus\nactivates and stops thinking about the\nmistake that you made because remember\nwhen you were growing up nothing you can\ndo is ever good enough so anytime you\nfall short what did your mind do and you\nmay have noticed this in your own life\nthat anytime you had to tell your\nparents that you got to be you just\nretreated mentally from the conversation\nyou like knew ahead of time that you\nwere screwed no matter what so you just\nstarted distracting yourself you told\nthem hey here's the report card or if\nyou're like me you actually walked out\nto the mailbox and took the report card\nout of the mailbox so that your parents\nwouldn't see it and your parents are\nlike Hey where's the report card and\nyou're like I don't know maybe they made\na mistake you just avoided the situation\nentirely and even when they found out\nyou mentally checked out you became numb\nand it didn't really hurt because it\nhurt too much instead of focusing on our\nmistakes this part of our brain\nactivates and shifts our attention away\nfrom our mistakes in order to protect us\nin doing so it fcks us because now we\ndon't actually repair our mistakes and\nthis is the curse of perfectionism which\nis that you want to do a great job you\nwant to do a great job you want to do a\ngreat job but anytime you screw up you\ndon't have the resilience to actually\nfix the problem you just end up beating\nyourself up you end up numbing yourself\nout out you end end up feeling like\nthere's nothing you can do to win this\ngame and the reason you feel that way is\nbecause literally the part of your brain\nthat learns from mistakes is handicapped\nby the MFG medial frontal gyrus and the\nmedial frontal gyrus starts thinking\nabout other things why does it do that\nbecause when you were growing up that's\nall it could do because you had parents\nwho could never be made happy so if you\nthink about it if you have parents who\nare never going to be happy the only\nadaptation your brain has is to numb\nitself out because there's no way you\ncan make them happy so solving the\nproblem doesn't work and so literally\nyour brain stops solving the problem now\nlet's look at personal standard\nperfectionism so these are people who\nhave a high standard for themselves so\nin personal standard perfectionism a\ncompletely different part of the brain\nactivates and a completely different\nthing happens so the anterior singulate\ncortex or the medial singulate cortex\nsome different part of the brain\nactivates and what these people do when\nthey make a mistake is they slow down\ntheir thinking and they actually pay\nattention to the problem\nliterally their cognition slow down so\nwhat we see when we give these two\npeople tasks in which they're supposed\nto make mistakes is that the person with\nPSP makes a mistake once slows down\ntheir thinking and then improves with\nthe task over time makes fewer mistakes\nwhereas the person with the external\nconcern perfectionism avoids whatever\nthe task is as soon as they figure out\nthey've made a mistake and starts\nthinking about other things so they\nactually don't improve over time the\nproblem when we struggle with\nperfectionism is that the advice that we\nget sucks because people out there will\ntell you oh just do less good or just\nstop caring what other people think or\njust learn how to S set boundaries cut\nout these toxic people from your life\nbut if you are perfectionistic you know\nthat you carry that perfectionism With\nYou from One relationship to the next to\nthe next and the whole point is that\nwhen you are perfectionistic the your\nbrain is like different from somebody\nelse's brain you've been wired to care\nabout what other people think whereas\nthese people with personal standard\nperfectionism they're actually okay\nignoring the rest of the world but the\nreason they're okay with that and the\nreason they give you that advice is\nbecause their upbringing was different\nwhere they could afford to not care so\nnow this is where things get really\ninteresting because how do we solve this\nproblem and this is where we're going to\nactually show y'all okay so let's take a\nquick look so over here we have\npersonal\nstandard\nperfectionism or\nPSP over here we have external concern\nperfectionism or\nECP and now what we know is that you can\nhave high or low of each of these\nquantities okay so if I have high\nexternal concern in low personal\nstandard okay so this is where you are\nchances are if you're perfectionistic\nthis is where you are which means that\nyou want to be perfect for other people\nbut you don't expect a whole lot from\nyourself now here's the problem if we\nlisten to all these fers out there who\nare like just care less about what other\npeople think what we'll actually do is\nmove into this column so not only do you\nnot give a about what other people think\nbut you don't give what you think to\nbegin with so now you're over here and\nyou give no right so there's like zero\nconcern and this leads to the worst\noutcomes these people do the worst in\nlife they don't care about themselves\nthey don't care about anyone else maybe\nyou're down here and if you're down\nthere my heart goes out to you now\nhere's the really interesting thing\npeople may think that being in this\ncolumn is the best high personal\nstandard I care about what I think and I\ndon't care about anyone else I'm going\nto live my life according to my rules\nand other people's disrespect or\ndisappointment me I don't really care\nabout that doesn't bother me I'm happy\nand that's what's important these people\ndo better than these people so these\npeople do the worst these people which\nis probably all do bad these people do\nokay but here's the cool thing these\npeople do the best and so the wild thing\nhere is we don't want to move you from\nhere to here because it's really hard to\nchange that wiring it's really hard to\nstop caring about what other people\nthink when you grew up in an environment\nwhere your survival and happiness\ndepended on what other people think\nwhat's actually way easier is for you to\nmove this way so instead of stopping to\ncare about other people and the cool\nthing there is that in the same way that\nthe personal standard perfectionism\npeople it's hard for them to start\ncaring about what other people think if\nyou can make this shift into setting a\nstandard for yourself in addition to\ncaring what other people think because\nwe can't change that you will actually\noutperform the person who doesn't give a\nsh about anyone else and it's actually\nhard for them to start caring about what\nother people think it's hard to move on\nthe ECP axis it's easier to move on the\nPSP axis okay I know that's kind of\nconfusing but the tldr is that we don't\nwant to change the way that you think\naround other people that's not how we're\ngoing to harness perfectionism we're\ngoing to leave that there because you've\ntried to fix it and it hasn't really\nworked so far and what's actually easier\nis harnessing the personal standard\nperfection\nand what that literally means is\nlearning to set a standard for yourself\nso there are two things that you can do\nto boost your PSP the first is when you\nmake a mistake slow down remember that\nwhat we learned from kind of these\nstudies on mistakes and ECP and PSP is\nthat when someone makes a mistake and\nthey have high ECP their medial frontal\ngyrus activates they distract themselves\nwhereas the PSP person slows down so\ninstead what I want you all to do the\nnext time you make a mistake catch\nyourself there's going to be a a part of\nyour mind that feels very squirly it's\nlike it's going to try to move over here\nit's going to try to move over there\nit's going to try to do anything but sit\nwith the feeling or the thoughts or\nwhatever you have in that moment so what\nyou need to do is don't distract just\nslow down the good news is you don't\nhave to fix anything right that's where\nthe perfectionists fall into this this\ntrap which is like how do I fix it how\ndo I fix it you don't have to fix it all\nyou have to do is pay attention to the\nproblem that'll disable the medial\nfrontal gyrus and then thankfully the\nrest of your brain will start to act so\njust slow it down anytime you make a\nmistake tip number one second thing that\nyou need to do is develop a standard for\nyourself so if you have a high level of\nECP and you're very perfectionistic\nanytime you approach a task you don't\nthink about you you never ask yourself\nthe question what would I be happy with\nwhy because it's a dumb question who\ncares what I would be happy with it\nmatters what other people think and why\ndo you think that way it's because you\nused to have an opinion when you were a\nkid and your parents didn't give a\nso you stopped giving a about your\nopinion that needs to change so anytime\nyou're faced with a task notice that\nyour instinctive response is to think\nabout how to make other people happy how\ndo I succeed how do I be perfect and\ninstead ask yourself what would I be\nhappy with pretend the rest of the world\ndid not exist would a b be okay for me\ndo I need to get an A or an A+ do I need\nto be at the top of my class what would\nmake me happy and then hopefully what\nyou're able to do is as you perform you\ncan hold both of those things at the\nsame time other people may have been\ndisappointed in you but at least you can\ntake some pride in your performance and\nthe beautiful thing is that if you do\nthis if you literally just slow down\nanytime you make a mistake you don't\nhave to fix it you don't have to make\nanyone happy you don't have to make\nyourself happy literally just slow down\nand you start to develop personal\nstandards for yourself you will actually\nshift into the high PSP and high ECP\ncolumn and if you're able to shift into\nthat column you will actually\noutperform all of the people who are\njust doing whatever they want to in life\nand just hold themselves to their\npersonal standards you will actually be\nable to outperform all those hyper\nindependent people that you wish you\ncould be like all these people that are\ngiving you this crappy advice of just\nstop caring about other people if you\nreally look at things like median income\nand performance in life what you'll\ndiscover is that high ECP can be a\nblessing if you can inject some of your\npersonal standard perfectionism feels\nlike a curse because no matter how hard\nwe try we seem to always disappoint\npeople and the good news is that that\ndegree of striving for Perfection can\nactually allow you to achieve the best\nthings in life all you need to do is add\nsome of that personal resilience in\nthere add some self-respect and add some\nexpectations for yourself for your\nbenefit and it's not so much about\nfixing the perfectionism or wiping it\naway or becoming someone else because\nthat's hard what it's really about is\nadding this additional component which\nwill allow you to outperform everybody\n[Music]\nelse"
