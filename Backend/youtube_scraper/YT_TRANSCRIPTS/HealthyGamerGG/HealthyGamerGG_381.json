welcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream just a reminder that my name is\nAlo kenoa and just a that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly um if youall have a concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional hello my friends how's\neverybody doing today we doing good we\ncrushing it yall doing well um we do\nhave a special announcement at the end\nof stream today and uh unfortunately it\nis not that I writing a movie I\nwish um and I think that many of you may\nbe right about what the announcement is\nbut I also expect some of y'all to be\ndisappointed and this is just a\num yeah just a reminder that uh yeah\nthat's that's\nlife oh no people people are aware that\nI am\npregnant um no I I am not pregnant that\nis not the announcement\num yeah so welcome everybody hope yall\nare doing well so let me just see if we\nhave other\nannouncements um yeah so we we we'll do\nour announcement probably at the end but\ntoday we're just going to be looking at\nsome leddit\nposts posts from leddit just to discuss\nvarious things that are relevant to our\ncommunity and yeah we're going to talk\nabout it maybe we'll do like a lecture\nor whatever like we'll see how that goes\num ah yes as people are\nsaying uh yeah it's not 12 rules for\nlife and it's not a\num I saw some other good\nones um I'm not coming out as bisexual\nbut I love I love these uh I I love the\nenthusiastm\nchat you know what we should do is back\nbefore we became decent human beings we\nused to be internet trolls and so what\nwe should do is actually you know what\nwould be a great idea is if we just said\nhey we're making a special announcement\nwe're going to be announcing the thing\nthat we should that many of yall have\nsaid we need to do the most and then\nwhat we should do is use some kind of\nlike AI to scrape the comments and try\nto figure out what people think we're\ndoing and then we should do that thing\nhow does that sound chat does that sound\nlike a good idea we're not actually\nwe're just going to we're going to use\nthat as a way to collect\ninformation um man so many good ideas\nRetreat and someone else is saying 13\nrules for life right extra\nrules um and then we can we can do\nmicrotransactions with that each rule is\n299 we can follow the video game\nindustry and and do MTX\nbaby um no so actually we're going to go\nahead and and do it\nnow we are going to announce a\ncryptocoin we are starting a cryptocoin\nweb 3.0 whatever and the cool thing\nabout this coin is that when youall\npurchase the coin which is called HG\ncoin as your mental health improves the\nvalue of the coin goes\nup and as we not I don't even know how\nthat\nworks the more mentally healthy people\nget the more the cryptocoin is valuable\nand so what that means means is that if\nyou buy it today it'll tank in value\nover time so then what we're also going\nto do is there's one coin that we're\nlaunching which is called HG coin which\nit the value of the coin is dependent on\nthe mental health of the world and then\nwhat we're also going to do is we're\ngoing to launch a dank HG coin which\nwhich is the value is inversely\nproportional to the normal HG coin so\nwhat y'all can do is y'all can buy the h\nG coin if you have faith in mental\nhealth or what you can do is buy the\nDank HG coin and you can essentially\nshort our own crypto and so the cool\nthing is you win either way and then\nwe're going to make a third crypto coin\nwhich is called combo HG coin which is a\nan index that combines the other two\ndoes that make sense yall excited about\nthat would you would you buy an HG\ncryptocoin\nthat right and and that's what we're\ndoing we're we're selling out that's\nwhat we're doing we're we're starting\nour crypto Empire let's\ngo um yeah if only you could short World\nmental\nhealth so yeah to the Moon how about to\nthe depths of the marianus\ntrench okay so make sure to rug pull\nthere's no rug pole it's just a pit and\nyall can just jump into it right cuz\nhere at a G we make decisions with eyes\nopen is this a joke that's a joke it's a\ntasteless\njoke it's a bad\njoke I'll I'll be the first to admit\nthat we're not launching a cryptocoin\nchat but but if anyone here knows web\n3.0 and is into launching cryptocoins\nreach out because we're not\ninterested um no there's a real\nannouncement at the\nend um tequila brand yeah sure let's do\nthat Miss gruy I think she just wants\nfree\ntequila\num yeah\nso I would if y'all have any questions\nabout Discord message a\nmod um\nyeah you know I actually did hear\nsomeone sent me a link to a a strand of\napparently some some people are selling\na a version of marijuana or something\nthat's actually called Dr\nK I discovered this someone sent me a\nlink and they're like is this you and I\nwas like no it is not\nme\num what general topics let's see so\nhere's here's yall want to hop into\nposts and\nstuff\num ah so people are saying they're going\nto invest their life savings into our\ncryptocoin jokes on you Dr K my life\nsavings is\nzero don't think that I can't read\nthrough\nthat\num\nyeah okay Sabaton nope no\nsubathon but but great we we'll get to\nthe announcement so let's go ahead and\nuh um okay let's do posts yall want to\ndo this let's take a look can uh okay I\nguess we'll just take a look and then I\nwill listen Okay\nso my ex consumed a ton of Dr K content\nand got a false sense of Wellness just\nah heads up my ex-boyfriend had a huge\nmental health slide and became less and\nless well I was really worried about him\nbut he felt he was past needing therapy\nand above getting an intake or any help\nof any kind yet he consumed a lot of do\nK content he even recommended that I\nwatch Dr K because my anxiety was\ngetting worse actually I got got therapy\nand it turns out that my anxiety was\nalmost entirely to do with my ex our\nrelationship and my growing codependency\non trying to fix him well\ndone um unfortunately I think it gave\nhim a s false sense of being on top of\nhis mental health however it continued\nto get worse eventually I uncovered a\nvery serious drug addiction issue not to\nmention other addictions over time such\nas gaming work shopping consuming\ncontent Etc one of the biggest things he\nis he obsessive watched the content but\nnever took any of the advice or put it\ninto practice for example binge watching\nthe content on sleep hygiene late at\nnight and continuing terrible sleep\nhabits after that while I did watch some\nDr Kane found it useful taking notes Etc\nplease be mindful that this is not a\nsubstitute for real professional help\njournaling meds therapy Etc I assume\nthat this is probably obvious yeah we\nsay that at the beginning of every\nstream and every piece of content that\nwe put out and don't think anyone has\nbeen misled thank God\nhowever I saw the subreddit today and\nthought I'll leave a message before\nparting thank you so much for doing that\nso let's talk about why it is a bad idea\nto watch Dr K's content let's talk about\nthe problems of watching Dr K's content\nand the false sense of well-being that\nit\nprovides so this is something that we've\ngot to understand okay so this is a case\nof of someone whose partner was addicted\nto what sounds like substances of some\nkind had some pretty bad add\nand then consumed mental health content\non the internet as an excuse to not do\nwork as much as I love to bash Dr K's\ncontent I don't think we can really take\nthe blame for this and here's the reason\nwhy so there's something we've got to\nunderstand about the consumption of\nmental health content which is actually\nspiraling out of control right now on\nthe internet which we are a part of okay\nand I'll tell you all what we're doing\nto to deal with it so the first thing to\nunderstand is as someone struggles with\ntheir mental health they recognize that\ntheir mental health is\nstruggling and then what happens is our\nmind does something really really\nslippery which is it recognizes okay I\nneed to do something to fix this problem\nbut then the problem is that there's a\npart of our mind that looks at what it\ntakes to fix a problem and decides that\nit doesn't want to do that because\nfixing problems is difficult fixing\nproblems requires sacrifice fixing\nproblems is sometimes painful and\nrequires things like accountability and\nthe mind does not like that so sometimes\nwhat the mind will do is it'll look for\nsomething that is almost like virtue\nsignaling for improving our mental\nhealth it'll look for something that\nsays okay if I do this thing then I'm\nchecking the Box of improving my life\nand if I'm checking the box then here's\nthe key thing I can continue with the\ndegenerate Behavior I do not want to\ngive up degenerate is maybe a little bit\nunfair like if people are struggling\nwith an addiction that's the\nslipperiness of the addiction mind this\nis what I learned as an addiction\npsychiatrist some people will show\nup and will talk the talk and now what's\nhappened is we have a plague of mental\nhealth content on the internet of which\nwe're guilty\nand here we are trying to help people\nwith their mental health but there's\nsomething really slippery that goes on\nwhich is that watching our content is\nnot going to be sufficient to change\nyour life right and I hate to say it but\nthat's how it is so this is what we\nactually try to do with our content so\nI'm going to explain this I don't know\nthat we've we've ever explained this but\nso here's the thing if someone is not\nreluctant to engage in in mental health\nsupport or Improvement what you\nbasically have to do is meet them where\nthey're at which is precisely why we do\nwhat we do right so we try to create\ncontent that is engaging for people\nwhere they're at so even if someone\ndoesn't actually want to do anything\nabout their mental health we're actually\nokay with that and we're going to try to\nengage you in a way that sort of brings\nyou in right makes things a little bit\nentertaining a little bit fun a little\nbit humorous and hopefully by the end of\nit over time you will start to make some\nchanges and this is what we've seen in\nour community time and time and time\nagain it's not like people show up on\nday one and then they watch one video\nand they're like oh crap I'm going to\ntransform my life because I watched one\nYouTube video by this guy and then I'm\ngoing to transform my life it's actually\nthe people who do do that end up not\nsticking with it right and sometimes\nlike this even consistent with things\nlike Mania where I've seen a lot of\npeople you know clinically who are Manic\nand they like watch one video and\nthey're like oh my God this transforms\nmy life so if you're someone who is\nwatching One video and you're like this\n[ __ ] is transforming my life unless it's\nthe gifted kids video that one is fair\ngame or maybe why yeah we've got a\ncouple that I think is fair to transform\nyour life to be honest we've heard that\nfeedback like time and time and time\nagain so maybe maybe maybe maybe like\none or two percent of yall you can be\ntransformed by one video we'll concede\nthat point but 99 to 98% of people let's\nbe honest one video is not going to\nchange your life and so then the\nquestion is if you're chain watching Dr\nK's content we see this a lot where\npeople will binge watch it right right\nthe key thing to understand is that\ninformation does not necessarily create\nbehavioral change there is a second\ncomponent to this which is the\napplication of the stuff in your life\nand that's also why when we make content\nwe don't just say hey here's what's\ngoing on we try to say like okay here\nare one or two things that you can do to\napply this principle to your life and\nthat's where the rubber meets meets the\nroad right and this is true of other\nparts of like watching content as well\nlike you can look at EX sizing content\nor if you're like me you can watch\ncooking videos on YouTube but watching\ncooking videos is not the same as\nlearning how of cook and our content is\nno different so what I would strongly\nencourage you all to do is pay attention\nto your mind right and here's one really\nsimple test that you can do and be\nhonest with yourself what am I watching\nthis content for and there are a couple\nof reasons that you can watch it number\none is I'm watching this content in\norder to get ideas so that I can make\ntry to make some kind of substantial\nchange to my life I'm watching this in\norder to apply it okay that's number one\nand if that's what you really want to do\nwhat you should do is try the thing in\nthe video before you watch the next\nvideo right try it the second thing that\nyou can do to make our content more\nworthwhile is manipulate the information\nso now we're going to teach youall some\nstuff about how\ninformation changes someone's Behavior\nand this is the crazy thing it doesn't\neven require you to attempt to do\nsomething the key thing that has been\nshown\nscientifically to result in like\nunderstanding and behavioral change is\nthe ability to manipulate the\ninformation so for example if we have\nwhen we're working in the hospital right\nso I'm a psychiatrist so sometimes we'll\nhave someone in the hospital who wants\nto leave the hospital against medical\nadvice so this may be someone who came\nin with a heart attack and they are adct\nEd to alcohol or opiates and so what\nhappens is on day two of the\nhospitalization they had a small heart\nattack they're sitting in the ICU\nthey're starting to like want their\nsubstances they're starting to withdraw\nand they're like I want to leave and\npeople are like you can't leave you just\nhad a heart attack and then the patient\nis like no I want to leave and so then\nis a and then what happens is the\ncardiologist calls the psychiatrist\nright and so then I get a page and I\nshow up at like 2:00 in the morning\nbecause there's a patient who's 2 days\npostm who wants to leave the hospital\nand now this is where we get into a\nreally tricky thing as doctors because\non the one hand we're here to um help\npatients but we also want to respect\ntheir autonomy and so what we do is\nsomething called a capacity evaluation\nand a capacity evaluation involves\nchecking a couple things to make sure\nthat this person is well within their\nmental frame to make decisions to leave\nthe hospital and one of the key aspects\nthat we rely on that sort of\ndemonstrates that this person really\nknows what they're doing is their\nability to manipulate\ninformation and so if yall are watching\nour\nvideos and even if you don't say you say\nDr K says okay like you should meditate\none one every day for one week and\nyou're like I can't do that that's\ntotally fine what you should do though\nis manipulate the information play\naround with it in your head what this\nmeans is challenge the information right\nso Dr K says this and I think he's wrong\nbecause of this that's actually good\ntell me why I'm wrong right do it in\nyour head or I guess\npost second thing that you can do is try\nto think about okay even if you think\nthat this is wrong and this is really\nhuge if you think a piece of information\nis wrong and you're listening to someone\nelse and your mind is reflexively\nchallenging it if you really want to\nlearn and\nchange what you should do is try to\nunderstand how that information could be\nright so try to take the other person's\npoint of view and question your own\nbeliefs right so this is something that\nthe internet doesn't do the internet is\nlike hey I think this is wrong therefore\nscrew them downvote cancel them we never\nquestion our own beliefs and this is how\nwe create Echo Chambers and this is how\nwe stay stuck so if you are someone who\nconsumes some kind of content this is\nreally common by the way right so we see\nthis a lot with like people who are\nconsuming content that they disagree\nwith and this is like Pol this is going\nto be political where I'm going to watch\nvideos of people who I politically\ndisagree with and I'm going to just poop\non them in my head and I'm going to feel\nbetter about myself or we see it with\nthings like gender Dynamics where I'm\ngoing to consume stuff that has a view\non gender and relationships that I\ncompletely disagree with and I'm going\nto consume that content and then people\nare really confused they're like I don't\nunderstand why the algorithm is serving\nme this toxic content it's because the\nalgorithm understands that you actually\nreally enjoy engaging with it right and\nthen you watch this crap and you're like\nthese people are wrong haahahaha all\nthese people are idiots they're all dumb\nasses so this is what our mind\nreflexively does so if you want to\nreally learn something I know it sounds\ninsane but try to understand the other\nperson's perspective okay this is the\nsecond way you manipulate information\none is to challenge it and the second is\nto try to support it try to figure out\nwhat is this person thinking and in what\ncircumstances could this be true because\nhere's the crazy thing is if you\nunderstand that side of things you will\nunderstand so much more and you may grow\nyourself as a human being okay so that\nwhat you really need to do is manipulate\nthe information the third thing that you\ncan do is engage with the information\neither through conversation like you can\npost like we see this a lot where you\nknow we'll have like um video based\ndiscussions on our subreddit or talk to\npeople on Discord or talk to people\nabout you know what they think about\nthis particular thing these are all ways\nto manipulate information and for those\nof youall that are kind of lazy right\nyou're like eh I don't want to do\nanything I don't want to do anything I\ndon't want to like meditate I don't want\nto wake up I don't want to do yoga I\ndon't want to journal at least think\nabout it and that's one step forward in\nterms of like applying the content to\nyour life and this is something that I\nthink we\nundervalue in our society today so right\nnow we get bombarded with so much\ninformation and so many opinions\nthat we stop thinking for\nourselves and people are kind of like\nwondering they're like why on Earth do\npeople listen to\ncelebrities and their opinions on like\ngeopolitics or the economy like what\ndoes a celebrity know about this\nparticular thing and why do we do that\nwe do that because we as human beings\nand in this society today we have\nsurrendered our capacity for critical\nthinking and this is where there's so\nmuch information but why isn't the whole\nworld becoming happy and successful\nright there's all the side hustle people\nout there the finance Bros and maybe\nFinance ladies who knows who are like\nyou should side hustle and you should do\nthis and\ncrypto and like why isn't everyone a\nmillionaire like what happened like how\nis this there's so much good information\nit's because we don't think about it\nwe've stopped doing the thinking for\nourselves and so this is the key thing\nto understand about consuming our\ncontent first of all you've got to be\ncareful that there is not a part of your\nmind that is using our content as a\nsubstitute for Progress do you all\nunderstand that what this means is that\nyou think okay if I watch 10 Dr K videos\nmy life will get better right and so\nthen you're like passively watching Dr K\nvideos because like if you watch enough\nDr K videos your life will get better\nright there's some data so we're doing\nan internal study and we hope to kind of\nformalize it and stuff like that so we\nhave some initial data that watching our\ncontent can improve Health by about like\n8 to\n11% literally like it may actually help\njust as a frame of reference you know\nsome studies show that medication\nimproves things by maybe about 30 to 50%\nright so some studies say 50 or 60%\nchances are that further data really\nshows that that number is way smaller\nthan we thought and it's probably closer\nto 30% so hey like I'll take watching\nYouTube or twitch or whatever for aend\nlike you know being a third of the the\nvalue of an SSRI like I'll take that\nright so this this data hasn't been\nthird party checked or we haven't done a\nformal study or anything like that yet\nwe've seen a signal that is now like\nokay we should really study this do\nsomething that's a little bit more\ncontrolled really analyze the data and\nsee how much it helps people but this is\nalso what we see kind of like on on you\nknow when people in our community say\nhey you've helped me a lot right so I\nwent to the international last week and\nthat was fun and like literally hundreds\nof people were like hey your content has\nchanged my life so when people walk up\nto me and they say that I'm like okay\nlike maybe we're doing something right\nbut the key thing here is that you've\ngot to be careful because sometimes your\nmind will delude you into thinking that\nyou're making progress by doing\nsomething that is very very hands-off\nthat's not hard okay so be careful about\nthat binge watching our content like if\nyou want to go for it right I'm not\ngoing to say no but also recognize that\nthere's a majority of people in our\ncommunity who will say hey it helped a\nlot more when I slowed it down so watch\nout for that second thing is if you want\nto make it worthwhile just do the stuff\nthat we tell you to do easy that's why\nwe tell you to do it right give it a\nshot I'm not saying you have to do it\n100% give it a shot the whole point is\nfor you to learn about yourself because\nI know it sounds crazy as brilliant as I\nam a stranger on the internet is not\ngoing to be able to give you the perfect\nadvice the whole point of this channel\nis to teach people how to understand\nthemselves it's to teach you how to\nunderstand yourself so what we're going\nto do is we're going to give you like a\nheads up I mean sorry a head start right\nwe're going to give you we're going to\nlay things out so that you don't have to\nfigure everything out but you should\ntest it and apply the concept yourself\nand the last thing is even if you're not\nwilling to do\nanything that's okay try to manipulate\nthe information challenge the\ninformation try to understand for the\nparts that you disagree with why is your\nperspective different from this person's\nperspective that's really healthy and\nthe fourth thing which we're totally for\nis if you look at addiction Psychiatry\nchange doesn't happen\novernight and so so this is the fourth\nthing that we we really focus on and I\ndo this quite intentionally is I\nrecognize that not everyone is willing\nto make a change today when they watch a\npiece of our content they're not willing\nright so y'all in the audience you may\nnot be willing to change that's actually\nokay but as long as you stay around over\ntime what we tend to see is that people\nare more and more willing to change so I\nwouldn't say binge watch everything and\nthen disappear for a month what I'd say\nis like watch a couple videos a week and\nthen like over time like your desire to\nchange will increase and that's actually\nwhat we see too which is that I I I\ndon't think that you know I I don't\nthink that people find drastic change in\na short amount of time I think what\nhappens is people who are members of our\ncommunity their mental health will\nimprove over the course of months to\nyears and so that can work and it's okay\nif you're not ready to change today\nwe're going to try to send you something\nentertaining but I think the unfortunate\ntruth is that a lot of people will use\nour content as a substitute for making\nprogress in their life they'll start to\nthink like okay if I watch enough\nYouTube videos I will be better and\nthat's just like saying look you can\nwatch enough YouTube videos about\nworking out ain't going to make you swo\nand I hate to say it mental stuff is a\nlittle bit different right because\nhopefully you can shape your thoughts\nand that's a part of being mentally\nswole but at some point you got to do\nsomething and so be careful about that\nfor yourselves and other\npeople\nquestions\noh my God something something's\nslowed\ninteresting\nstream someone's saying I\ndisagree um okay interesting give me a\nsecond let me let me look into this if\nstuff is\nuh\nrestart\nPC okay was that the special\nannouncement\nno um so someone's asking when you said\nwatching your videos helps 10% is that\nwith practice or just watching we're not\nsure so remember that this is a\npopulationbased\nmeasurement so what that means is that\nif I take a thousand people there is a\n10% Improvement on average what is much\nmore likely is that there is a\nvariability of how people improve so\nthere's a much more likely that 20 C 20%\nof people improve by\n50% 50% of people improve by 0% and 30%\nof people improve by 30% that's probably\nwhat we're looking at right so that\naverages out to about a 10% Improvement\nbut I would bet money that there's all\nkinds of subpopulations at play\nhere okay thank youall very much mods\nlet's move on to the next one yeah but\nthat happens like people will get a\nfalse sense of security if they're you\nknow watching our\ncontent\nokay according to a lot of people this\nis what therapy feels like to them I'm\nglad you decided to keep going to\ntherapy shall we\nstart okay there you go see you next\nweek okay so this is a great Meme and is\nsomewhat true\nthere's a part of this that's true and\nthere's a part of this that I think is\nreasonable\nokay so let's understand when we go to\ntherapy what's going on so the biggest\nproblem in therapy today is that it's\nhard to tell if you're a patient whether\nyou have a bad therapist who is not\ndoing a whole lot\nor you're doing it right and it just\ntakes time this is the core problem in\ntherapy okay so I had a\npatient\nwho was in the clinic that I was working\nin for 20 years and this was when I was\nlike training to become a resident so\nthis patient had been in the clinic for\n20 years and what that means is one\ndoctor one resident will take care of\nthem for about three years and they get\npassed to another P doctor passed to\nanother P doctor because when you leave\nthe training program right so you finish\ntraining and you're done at whatever and\nso then you pass on your patients to\nlike people who were coming in this\nperson has had five or six therapists or\npsychiatrists over the course of 20\nyears and I'm number six this person\ncomes into my office and and then we\nlike I I do therapy with them okay and I\ndo therapy with this person I do I'm a\nsecondy year Psychiatry resident right\nat the Harvard Medical School so like oh\nlike yeah like I'm brilliant come on\nlet's go so I do therapy with this guy\nfor a while and then like you know a\ncouple months in something about this\njust ain't feeling right right so I'm\nsitting there and I'm doing therapy I'm\na second like I started doing therapy 6\nmonths ago so 6 months in I kind of talk\nto him I'm like bro are you getting\nbetter and he's like I don't know like I\ndon't really what do you mean by getting\nbetter AR aren't I doing a good job\nthat's actually what he asked me he's\nlike am I not doing a good job and I was\nlike I don't know like you kind of come\nin and you talk about your\nfeelings right but like it seems like\nyou just come in and you're just like\nsad all the time and six months have\ngone by like I don't know that you've\nactually gotten better like do you is\nthis are we doing this right right cuz\nI'm like I'm a second year resident like\nI I don't know how to do this and he's\nlike no I mean I I don't I don't think\nlike much has changed and I was like\nthat's kind of crazy right like you've\nbeen doing this for 20 years have you\ngotten better and he's like no I'm like\nwhat the hell are we doing so we sort of\nlike started with that conversation so\nthe first thing to\nunderstand is that there are a couple\ndifferent kinds of therapy so sometimes\ntherapists are sort of trained in a\nparticular area right so if you're in a\nCommunity Mental Health Center with\nwhere people who are like really\nstruggling sometimes as a therapist your\njob is to bail water out of the boat so\nimagine there's a boat that's taking on\nwater because there's holes inside and\nthe boat is sinking and every week what\nyou do as a therapist is you just get\nrid of all of the negative emotions from\nthat week because without bailing water\nthe boat would sink sometimes therapists\ndo this kind of stuff where they don't\nreally like focus on making change over\ntime and this is what sort of frustrated\nme with the field of psychiatry in\ngeneral is I had these like brilliant\npsychoanalytic supervisors who were like\nyeah it takes years and years of\npsychoanalysis years of psychoanalysis\nwhat does that mean that means five\nyears of meeting four days a week for\none hour four hours a week and I'm not\ntrying to bash psychoanalysis I think\npsychoanalysis can be really fantastic\nbut I'm I'm trying to wonder like what\nare we doing here and so this is a huge\nproblem in the field of therapy because\nif you really think about\nit how does a therapist know whether\nthey are doing a good job or a bad\njob right because if I'm a\ntherapist and my patients aren't getting\nbetter maybe they're just severely\nmentally ill right so if you also look\nat places like Massachusetts General\nHospital and you look at their surgical\noutcomes so this is also like MGH and\nHarvard right so some of the best\nsurgeons in the world are at MGH and\ntheir mortality the mortality rates for\ntheir patients can be high and then the\nquestion is wait hold on a second if\nthese are supposed to be some of the\nbest surgeons in the world why are their\nmortality rates high it's because the\nhardest cases come to the best surgeons\ny'all get that so now if I'm a therapist\nlike how do I know if I'm doing a good\njob or a bad job I don't know and if we\nlook at the field of therapy B oh no F\nwhat\nhappened press play again saved okay we\nback so if we look at the field of\ntherapy we do not check the quality of\nthe therapy that we provide right so if\nyou sort of think about it therapists\ndon't watch other therapists do therapy\nand we don't watch them and we don't\ncollect data on them when we don't say\nhey you're not doing this you're good at\ndoing this you're bad at doing this this\nis what we do in the other parts of\nMedicine by the way so if you look at\nsome of these institions like the\nCleveland Clinic or like the martini\nclinic in Germany so the martini clinic\nin Germany is really fascinating this is\na clinic that only does weight loss\nsurgery but man they measure everything\nand they develop this\nprogram where if your outcomes dip\nbeneath a certain point you have to go\nback to a remedial\ncourse and the second I think the chief\nof surgery are the second person in the\ndepartment not the chief but the second\nperson their outcomes this is the number\ntwo in the whole\nHospital their outcomes\ndipped beneath like what they're\nsupposed to be and they sent his ass\nback to school because it doesn't matter\nwhether you're you're at the top of the\ndepartment or the bottom of the\ndepartment outcomes are outcomes we do\nnot have this in the field of therapy we\ndo not measure outcomes for therapists\nand say hey your patients are not\nimproving as much as other patients\ninstead what we have in therapy and this\nis like I'm dissing the field but\nhonestly this is sometimes how it is is\nwe have something called peer\nsupervision okay and what we do in peer\nsupervision is a group of therapists get\ntogether they talk about their patients\nno one ever ask the patient by the way\nit's just therapist talking to therapist\nand the therapist will say I'm\nstruggling with this and then people\nwill say like oh you're doing a great\njob right because it's like supportive\nno one's ever like yeah like I've never\nheard anyone say in peer supervision\nyeah I think you're one of the worst\ntherapists that I've ever met which\ntechnically has to be true for some\npeople in there because if we look at\ntherapist ists there's a bell curve and\nsome of them are the best and some of\nthem are the worst and now if you're a\ntherapist who's listening to this you\nare going to take issue with that\nstatement because you're going to say\nall this kind of crap like and it's true\nby the way I'm not saying this is wrong\nthis is correct that different\ntherapists work well for different kinds\nof people right you can't it's not one\nscale of therapy there's like CBT\ntherapists and DBT therapists and\npsychodynamic therapist there's so many\ndimensions you can't measure people but\nI want you all to think about the moment\nwe say something like\nthat what have we given up we've given\nup the ability to objectively measure\nthe quality of a\ntherapist yall get that it's like oh\nyeah like your food is [ __ ] it's like\nwell different people like different\nthings so I'm going to keep making [ __ ]\nfood right like this is crazy that our\nfield has done\nthis that we don't measure outcomes and\nif you're a therapist who's listening to\nthis by all means correct me but I I\nwould ask you do you measure the\noutcomes of your patients do you collect\nfeedback from your patients and this is\nwhere therapists will say yeah of course\nI'll ask my patients how the therapy is\ngoing well let's think about that for a\nsecond right because we're\ntherapists and when you ask your patient\nhow the therapy is going what is the\nlikelihood that you will get a legit\nanswer because your patient likes you\nthey want respect and your patients\ndon't want to tell you that you're doing\na crappy job except when they do tell\nyou that you're doing a crappy job and\nwhen they tell you you're doing a crappy\njob what do you do as a therapist oh my\nGod this person is so not ready for\ntherapy oh my God this person is drug\nseeking and they're an addict and this\nis part of their personality disorder\nand they have all these kinds of\nattachment issues and they're doing some\nkind of projection onto me and so what\ndo we do as therapists we're [ __ ]\nlike Neo in The Matrix dodging any kind\nof feedback like oh my God my therapist\nis my patient is telling me I'm doing a\nbad job like oh no oh no I'm going to\nrationalize that away by saying oh my\nGod this person is projecting on me\nbecause I can't I can't be doing a bad\njob this is\nridiculous the problem is with the\npatient this is what we do and if you're\na therapist out there who does not do\nthis right and by the way I was taught\nby by people who don't do this right so\nthere's awesome therapists out there I'm\nnot saying all of it is bad what I'm\nsaying is that we have a\nsystem that does not\ncorrect the therapists who are doing a\nbad job we have no way of measuring it\nit's not like the medical board is like\nHey we're going to pull your license\nbecause your outcomes are bad as long as\nyou don't sleep with your patients or\nlike take their money for your crypto\nstartup like you're fine there's no\nquality control in the field of\ntherapy it's\nbizarre so the challenge with therapy\ntoday is you don't know whether you have\na bad therapist or not and this is a a\ntragedy for people because what happens\nis if you go in and you have a bad\ntherapist okay and then it doesn't work\nfor you what do you conclude you\nconclude therapy doesn't work for me you\ndon't conclude that the problem is over\nthere cuz you're the one who's busted\nand then you ride off the field of\ntherapy right so this is the the problem\nwith therapy is that when you go in\nyou're like I'm here all the time and\nlike this feels insufficient and what I\nencourage you to do is take that feeling\nseriously and if it feels like you're\nnot making any progress talk to your\ntherapist about it because the good news\nis that there are a ton of awesome\ntherapists out there and I want to say\nmore than 50% of them are fantastic I\nwant to say that 70% of them are pretty\ngood that's my gut check okay so like\nand then talk to them because here's the\nother thing that people don't understand\nokay I know it's crazy but we're not\ntelepathic as therapists and since we\ndon't measure outcomes and stuff like\nthat we rely on y'all as the patients to\ntell us something isn't\nworking and when my patients tell me\nsomething isn't working that's the best\nthing to move therapy\nforward right so we can blame the field\nof therapy as much as we want to because\nI love doing that oh my god let's bash\ntherapists but here's the crazy thing\nthat we never do in medicine\nwe never blame the\npatient no how dare you blame the\npatient because a patient did do\nanything wrong well hold on a second\nlet's think about\nthat if we don't accept that the patient\nhas some\nresponsibility how are we going to like\nEmpower them as patience like power\ncomes with responsibility the two come\nthe same and sometimes there are bad\npatients it happens right we don't say\nit like oh my God they're not bad\npatients right and I think it's really\nimportant to treat quote unquote bad\npatients with compassion so we're not\nsaying that if you're a bad patient you\nneed to be kicked out of the practice I\nthink that's\nbad but I think that like there's people\nwho like bring you cookies on your\nbirthday and there's people who tell you\nto go [ __ ] yourself every time you see\nthem that's a difference right in in our\nexperience as medical professionals like\nthere's some patients who are nightmares\nand we all say it to each other but we\nnever say it out loud\nand it's like I I don't know how to\nunless we're we hold patients\naccountable for their behavior I don't\nknow how to like improve this situation\nso make sure that you're doing\neverything right and I think for the\nrecord by the way it's okay to like blow\nup at your therapist I don't think you\nshould be abusive but like sometimes if\nyou're going through withdrawal like\nI've had this happen to me where it's\nlike you know day four of opiate\nwithdrawal and like my patients are\ntelling me to go [ __ ] myself like over\nand over and over again and then like\nthat's part of the withdrawal right it\ndoesn't make them a bad patient just\nbecause your suffering does not make you\na bad patient if your narcissistic\ndefense mechanisms are Full Throttle\nright now doesn't make you a bad patient\neven if you do bad things in my opinion\nthere are good reasons why patients\nbehave\nbadly\nbut that stuff usually improves over\ntime right so once the withdrawal is\nover people will be like hey man my bad\nand I'll be like don't worry about it\nthat was the withdrawal\ntalking right so if y'all want to take\nadvantage like if if this if this is\nyour experience where therapy is\ninsufficient the first thing to\nrecognize is that your therapist may not\nbe very good or what's much more what\nsafer to say right won't won't get me\ncanceled is that it and this is legit by\nthe way I'm not just saying this is a\nmeme so therapy is a lot about fit so I\nI've had so I'll give you all an example\nso I was talking to a couple friends of\nmine who\nhad Obstetricians okay so these are\npeople who manage\npregnancy and so I've had some friends\nwho will say like okay like my\nobstetrician was awful and I'll say oh\nwhat made them awful and they're like I\nwould ask them what should I do and\nthey'll say well you can do this or you\ncan do this or you can do this what do\nyou want to do and they're like I don't\nknow you tell me you're the doctor and\nthe the obser with the Obi was like like\nwhat however you want to do your\npregnancy you can do your pregnancy this\nway you can do it this way like whatever\nfeels right for you right you can eat\norganic you can not eat organic like\nwhatever you want to do like I'm here to\nsupport you no matter what like you tell\nme what you and I'll make it happen\nthese people like I want you to tell me\nwhat to do and on the flip side we have\nobies who are like yeah you shouldn't do\nthat you should do this you should do\nthis you should do this and then we have\npatients who are like oh my God this\ndoctor is not considering my view\nthey're just telling me what to do\nthey're so\npaternalistic right even if they're\nwomen\nOB and so this is the thing like some\nOBS are like super Hands-On and\ndirective and some OBS are like super\nhands off and it's like power to the\npeople and like both of them are good\nobese it's about fit which is absolutely\nthe case with therapy\ntoo there's some patients who I have who\nare like you talk too much Dr K and some\npeople were like man it's refreshing to\nhave a therapist who actually talks in\nthe\nsession I've had both\nright and so fit is important doesn't\nmean that they're objectively bad but\njust because they're not necessarily\nobjectively bad we can't forget that\nthere are some people out there who\nobjectively bad and the third thing to\nis that you as a a patient should really\nadvocate for yourself and say hey this\nthis feels to me like I'm getting a\ncouple of drops of water on a blaze\nthat's out of\ncontrol and the last thing to\nconsider is that sometimes this is the\nway that therapy does work that you come\nin and you feel overwhelmed and it\nfeels like there's very little being\ndone from a week to week basis but you\ngive it three months you give it six\nmonths you give it nine months you give\nit a year and suddenly like now you're\nnoticing a difference because here's the\nbig problem with change in\ntherapy so if you look at change in\nhuman beings the worst person to measure\nchange is\nyou so if I look at myself in the mirror\nevery day I look the same as I did\nyesterday right not much of a change but\nlook at a picture of yourself 3 years\nago holy crap where did that person go\nand change in therapy is the same way we\ndon't realize it's happening CU every\nweek we go in and we're like oh my God\nI'm overwhelmed oh my God I'm\noverwhelmed oh my God I'm overwhelmed\nbut over time you start to set\nboundaries and you start to get\noverwhelmed by bigger and bigger stuff\nit's like the small stuff is no longer\noverwhelming so now your mind is like\nokay now we're going to get overwhelmed\nby big things and that's like that's\nokay that's normal so that's the real\nchallenge right and then the question\nbecomes how can we tell the difference\nand I don't know I don't know if you've\ngot a good therapist I don't know if\nyou've got a bad therapist I don't know\nif it's a good fit or a bad fit you\nshould absolutely advocate for yourself\nand sometimes things take time and all\nthat is\ntrue got\nit um Okay so we've got uh a comment\nfrom DED so I discovered a healthy gamer\nabout two months ago and it led me to\nseeking professional psychiatric help\nand I'm now on a road to better mental\nhealth and improving my life thank you\nfor doing this props to you my friends\nfor all y'all who are actually\num\nuh okay yes thank you all so much for\ngoing and getting help\nright therapists usually don't bite you\nhave to pay extra for\nthat\num okay so someone said my therapist\nsaid stop abusing yourself and just\nleave the past it in the never went back\nto therapy okay well\nyeah I mean I unfortunately that happens\nsometimes we'll get therapists who will\nsay like just\nstop and I don't know if that is\nhelpful it's\nchallenging um what makes a therapist\nbad what a great question so let's talk\nabout this in my opinion okay and I'm\nnot okay so we got to also dispel a\ncouple things I'm not an expert in\ntherapy okay y'all understand that like\nI'm a decent psychiatrist I think I do\npretty well I measure outcomes for my\npatients but I'm by no means an expert\nin therapy there's a billion people out\nthere not a billion but there are\nthousands or tens of thousands of people\nwho know more about therapy than I do so\nlet's just remind ourselves right the\nonly difference is like I'm more\nnotorious than they are more people\nlisten to me but just because y'all\nlisten to me doesn't make me more\nknowledgeable can we acknowledge that\nfor a\nmoment so here's my experience okay\na good therapist\nlistens a good therapist adapts to your\nneeds so what we mean by listen is as a\ntherapist it's your job to take\neverything that you've\nlearned and not apply 90% of it to your\npatient this is the difference between a\ngood therapist and a bad therapist the\nbad therapist in my opinion are the ones\nthat have learned a lot of stuff and\nthey come in and they say oh look at all\nthe stuff that I know I will apply it to\nyou we're going to make you a standard\nfast food sandwich with no customization\nbecause this is what\nworks good therapists are the ones that\nrecognize what parts of their knowledge\ndon't apply to this person which parts\nof their knowledge need to be adapted to\nthis\nperson and for me for example like in\nthe first one or two sessions I try to\nfigure out what percentage of talking\nshould I do in the session\nso I've had some therapists who should\nsay you should talk as little as\npossible right and that just doesn't I\nmean I think that probably works back in\nthe day but nowadays I don't know if\nyou'll get this but like y'all ain't in\nthis for the Long Haul like y'all don't\nhave time for that you don't have time\nfor three years of therapy like your\nlife is today you're 28 years old you're\nsingle right 3 years from now you're\ngoing to be over 31 you got to fix this\n[ __ ] now so that you can start a\nrelationship before it's too late and\nall the good ones are taken all those\nother doomsday thoughts\nlike your life is passing you by and I'm\nsure this has caused problems for me in\nthe past but what I really think about\nis like this person needs help a year\nago and the clock is ticking and so to\ntry to really adapt yourself to help\nthis person as quickly as possible now I\nhave had supervisors who have told me\nwhy that's a bad idea and I'll\nacknowledge that there's some parts of\nthat that's bad because it's my own\nurgency and I'm like change change\nchange change faster change faster don't\nyour life\nlife right and they're right that's like\nme projecting right so that's what I\nrecognize that and I sort of like tone\nthat down and like what is this person\nneed does this person need urgency from\nme or not and sometimes people don't\nneed urgency from me and so the main\nthing is that I have to pay attention I\nhave to listen to them and I have to\nadapt what I do this is the difference\nbetween a good therapist and a bad\ntherapist now there's some caveat to\nthis because if you're looking at\nsomething like manualized therapies or\nprotocolized therapies like CBT you kind\nof follow a\nprotocol so there's some\nless adaptation there but I that's what\nI think it is like listen and\nadapt and who knows I mean y'all may be\nthinking that I'm a great therapist but\nwho knows if like y'all were my patients\nmaybe you'd be like this guy's a [ __ ]\ndumbass fair enough\nright I mean could be true I don't think\nit is I hope it's not\nbut um\nokay\nall right I wish I was a 10 out of\n10 most people tell me that I'm average\nand I know that this is a dumb thing to\ncomplain about but I get extremely\nenvious of people who are actually\nhandsome I often worry that as soon as I\nget into a relationship I will be\nreplaced by a more attractive man I also\nhate that I get invisible as soon as a\nmore attractive person enters the room\nand I also hate being attracted to\npeople out of my league especially if\nyou like them for their personality but\nyou know you will never have a chance\nwith them because of the looks barrier\nin those instances I often wish the\nwomen I like were less attractive\nphysically so I could actually have a\nchance with\nthem boy do I feel this\nokay\nso it is completely\nnormal for you to be an average looking\nperson and wish that you were more\nbeautiful to wish that you were the most\nbeautiful person in the\nworld right to be in a room and be\ntalking to someone and someone sexy\ncomes in like you're talking to this\nperson who's like maybe like maybe\nyou're a five you're talking to like an\neight but you're on today baby you're on\nlet's go you're\nfunny they're into this like whole\nIsrael Palestine conflict and they have\na particular View and you're on the same\nside of the view so you're like yeah\nbaby let's go\nlike a seven and a half maybe an eight\nyou're like a five and you're like I've\ngot a shot let's go\nbaby and then a 10 walks in and they\nlike they stop talking to you and they\nlook at that person they're\nlike right and then you're like\n[ __ ] so easy for\nthem\nso the truth of the matter is that if\nyou're a five out of 10 you're probably\nnot going to be a 10 out of 10 at any\npoint\nbut the real tragedy here is that you\nnever needed to be a 10 out of 10 so\nwe're going to take a look at this post\nand I'll explain to youall what I\nmean so if I were to say like you know\nobjectively if you're a five out of 10\nyou're not a 10 out of 10 and this is\nsomething that's not in your control\nmaybe you can what what's it called\nlooks maxing or something glamping up or\nglamming up or whatever Glam up I don't\nknow what the kids on Tik Tok nowadays\nare\ndoing and so maybe you can pump yourself\nup to a six or a seven okay like you can\ndo that but here's the key thing to\nunderstand if you feel like you're\nunattractive you have to be super\ncareful because while that is while\nyou're averagely attractive and that may\nbe\ntrue the associations with that are not\ntrue but the problem is we believe that\nthey're true and it's the thoughts and\nattitudes that we have that ultimately\ncontrol our Behavior more than our\ngenetics okay so I'll give you an\nexample\num I know this is a dumb thing to\ncomplain about but I get extremely\nenvious of people who are actually\nhandsome I often worry as I get into a\nrelationship I will be replaced by a\nmore attractive man so let's understand\nthis so this is not a truth this is an\nanxiety and then what happens if you let\nthis anxiety control your life you will\nbe replaced by a more attractive man but\nit's not because they're more physically\nmore RVE it's because you're anxious and\nyou're with a partner who wants to be\nwith you but you're like oh you're going\nto leave me oh you're going to leave me\nand then like you see that they're\ntalking to someone else and so then you\nstart freaking out right and you're like\noh my God like they're talking to\nsomeone who's more attractive than me\nand they're laughing at their jokes and\nthis means I'm screwed and so then\nyou're\nlike and they're like what's wrong and\nyou're like\nnothing\nnothing\nnothing you're like I don't understand\nwhy you're upset I'm not upset it's fine\nit's whatever you know whatever and then\nlike you become this emotionally needy\npile of whatever and then they're your\npartner right so they like try to help\nyou feel confident for a while but as\nlong as you keep worrying as long as you\nkeep worrying cuz here they are\nsignaling to you that I'm actually okay\nwith this\nrelationship but if you have\nto keep on like making them do that\nwhere you can't velop confidence in\nyourself you can't hear what they're\nsaying then it becomes emotionally\nexhausting for them and this is really\nimportant to understand if you are in a\nrelationship where you feel unattractive\nand the way that you manage that\ninsecurity is by Outsourcing it to your\npartner your partner is screwed cuz\nthink about this your security is now\nthe emotional weight of your partner and\nif youall have been in a relationship\nwith someone like this you know exactly\nwhat I'm talking about it's emotionally\nexhausting\ncuz every time they feel anxious what is\ntheir coping mechanism they come to you\nthey do some weird passive aggressive\n[ __ ] they start crying in a corner\nand when you ask them what's wrong they\ndon't tell you right away and then\nyou're like all right whatever and then\nthey start crying a little bit louder\nand then you're like seriously what's\nwrong and they're like nothing if you\ndon't know nothing and then you're just\nexhausted by this right and then if\nyou're in that relationship you kind of\nget manipulated by these people right so\nthis is the other thing we don't realize\nthat there's a lot of manipulation going\non cuz they're like you're going to\nleave me they're like no babe I won't or\ndude bro homie I don't know what you\ncall if you're a woman I don't know what\nyou call a dude that you're\ndating honey maybe I don't know and so\nthen this this emotional manipul you're\ngoing to leave me because this person is\nmore attractive you're like no like I'm\nattracted to you like I want to be in\nthis relationship and then what happens\nis they keep on like telling cuz they\nfigured this out okay they keep on\ntelling you that if you tell someone\nthat they're going to leave you and then\nthey actually want to leave you cuz\nyou're driving them [ __ ] crazy\nthey'll feel guilty and they'll stay in\nthe relationship out of guilt and then\nyou end up in this like 2year toxic\nrelationship where you said promise me\nyou'll never leave promise me you'll\nnever leave promise me you'll never\nleave and the other person is like I\npromise I promise I promise and then\nthey want to leave but then they feel\nguilty so then they stay and you figured\nthis out you figured out that the more\nyou make a promise the more guilty\nthey'll feel and the more guilty they'll\nfeel the more you'll trap them and if\nyou trap them they can't leave and the\nmore unhappy they become and then\nfinally it's too much for youall to\nhandle and then you break\nup and then once you break up you're\nlike oh see I knew it all along this\nperson was going to leave then you start\nthe next relationship and now you've had\none more person who has abandoned you\nand so now promise me you won't leave\npromise me you won't leave but more\ndesperation more\nhunger so you've got to be super careful\nabout being worried that you're going to\nbe replaced and the antidote to that is\nto work on it in here metabolize the\nworry right where do I get this idea\nwhere does this come from that's just\nthe tip of the iceberg there's also\nother\nthings um I hate I also hate that I get\ninvisible as soon as a more attractive\nperson enters the room how do you know\nyou're\ninvisible right think about that that's\nan emotional reaction you don't\nliterally become invisible that would be\nthe most OP power in the world the\nmoment that someone more attractive\nenters the room I become I go in Vis\nthat's what we feel like because what\nhappens so this is literally\nNeuroscience okay chat is important to\nunderstand so people who feel a lack of\nconfidence in\nthemselves have a\nfiltered perception they have a\ncognitive bias where you will filter out\nliterally you will filter out all the\npeople who are paying attention to you\nand you will Zone in on the few people\nwho are not paying attention to you\nright and then what happens is there's a\nchain\nreaction because here you are people are\ntalking to you there's two people you're\ntalking to one is more attractive one is\nless attractive someone attractive walks\ninto the room this person more\nattractive person stops paying attention\nto you but less attractive person is\nstill paying attention to you and you\nignore that person and so now let's move\nthink about that person because now that\nperson now like you're not paying\nattention to them so they feel bad and\nthey look at the attractive person who\nentered the room and all your focus is\non that attractive person and now you're\nignoring this person but we don't think\nabout that you all make\nsense so I know it sounds crazy but\nthere's actually a cognitive bias there\nand it doesn't mean\nthat you become invisible like that's\nridiculous I mean it's it feels real and\nI'm not saying that people don't pay\nmore attention to Attractive people but\nyou don't become invisible it's not so\nblack and\nwhite I also hate being attracted to\npeople out of my league especially if\nyou like them for their personality but\nyou know you will never have a chance\nwith them because of the looks barrier\nwhere do you get this y'all where do\nyouall get\nthis right so I\nmean this is what's the most defeating\nis that I know I'll never have a chance\nwith them because of the looks\nbarrier like once you know that that's\nwhat gives you zero\nshot okay so this is like this is human\nPsychology 101 Placebo and nobo effect\nif you don't believe you've got a shot\nthat reduces your chances of\nsuccess and I I don't think I mean like\nI think that generally speaking if you\nlook at data on average people date\nwithin the same\nballpark but this is crazy but I I know\nthat like I know this sounds insane but\noften times people will end up with\npeople who are of a different\nattractiveness and why is that it's\nbecause if you look at Attractive people\nthey get so many advantages from being\nattractive that they do not have some\nkind of evolutionary pressure on their\nother qualities so if you an averagely\nattractive\nperson you're sort of forced to become a\ndecent human being but if you are\nhot there's a decent chance I don't want\nto say 50% it's probably less than 50%\nyou can get away with being an [ __ ]\nand if you can get away with being an\n[ __ ] you're more likely to be an\n[ __ ] and then what happens is you\nhave people who are attractive and\n[ __ ] I'm not saying everyone who's\nattractive is an [ __ ] I don't believe\nthat\nokay and so then it's kind of like like\nthink about it right because then and\nthen some people don't want\n[ __ ] and so you hear you are\nthinking okay I'm less attractive in\nthis person I can see this person's\nadvantages but I can't see their\ndisadvantages that's the whole point of\nAttraction and so here you are thinking\nthat the game is already\nover when you're only looking at one\nslice of the\ngame and so I've seen I mean hell I\nwould even venture to say that I was in\nrelationship where like my partner was\nway out of my\nleague right like I was\n26 no money no job job prospects no\nnothing\njust graduated from college a couple\nyears ago and hadn't done anything yet\nand I you know I consider my wife to be\nrelatively attractive I mean I think\nshe's super attractive so I was like\ndamn she's like out of my league and I'm\nlike a loser and I'm sure that there I\nmean actually I don't know if her\nfriends ever told us this but like you\nknow you should you can do better than\nthis and this is the crazy thing that we\ndon't understand about relationships so\nyouall want to know what the problem\nwith relationships\nis the problem with relationships is\nthat you think you can find something\nbetter big problem with\nrelationships right so when if you look\nat dating apps we're looking for a\nfinished product something off the shelf\nthat's perfect for\nus right because there's this attitude\nthat like I don't have to change for\nanybody I'm me and they have to accept\nme for who I am\nright cuz like that's the attitude so\npeople have to accept me for who I am so\nif you don't accept me for who I am you\ncan go screw\nyourself and I'm looking for the perfect\nperson because no one's got to change\nbut everyone needs to fit themselves to\nmy criteria because here's all my\ncriteria so like like let's think about\nthat like how does that if neither side\nis willing to compromise like what\nwhat's going to\nhappen so here's the crazy thing to\nunderstand okay and this something that\nfor some somewhere along the way like\npeople didn't people got this is that a\ngood relationship is cultivated not\nfound so everyone's like I need to find\nthe right person you don't find the\nright person they're not the right\nperson when you meet them they become\nthe right person over time that's been\nmy experience with my relationship and\nit's what I've seen in the majority of\nsuccessful relationships I've seen as a\npsychiatrist people grow into the right\nperson the problem right now is that no\none is willing to give someone a chance\nto grow and furthermore we've been LED\nthis this pile we've been fed this pile\nof [ __ ] that I don't need to change\nfor anybody I'm me I'm perfect the way I\nam they can take it or leave it and\nthat's why everyone's [ __ ] leaving\nit okay so if you want a relationship\ntwo things to consider number\none consider accepting an unfinished\nproduct instead of something that's\nperfect it's not about whether you can\nfind something better out there I have\nno idea it's are you with a person who\nis willing to make\nchanges and the second side of that is\nyou should be willing to make changes\nbecause I know it sounds kind of\ninsane but if you are with a partner who\nwants you to change there's a decent\nchance I want to say upwards of 50% that\nyou changing is a good idea for\nyou it's not about like\nbe I mean sure like there's a partner\ncomponent to it but most of the time\nwhen Partners want you to do stuff like\nit's good for you like hey like you\nshould really be more professionally\nambitious and it's like\nno I don't want to make more money I\nwant to be at the bottom of the tot pole\nfor the rest of my life or someone's\nlike hey like maybe you should start\neating healthier you're like N I want to\nkeep on eating [ __ ] day after day how\ndare you tell me to\nchange hey maybe you should like be a\nlittle bit more financially stable and\nFrugal with your money N I want to be in\ndebt\nn and the problem is that we get so e\nour ego gets hurt because we know that\nour partner is right that we rebel\nagainst it and then we log on to\nwhatever shorts platform you have and\nthere's all kinds of people up there on\npodcast telling you you don't have to\nchange for anybody if she doesn't accept\nyou you got a plates and you got to do\nthis and like this is how you get her to\nstay even if you're a loser and you\ndon't want to change like you don't\nchange for anybody that means you're\n[Music]\nwhipped it's like what what are we doing\nlike no wonder like relationships are so\nscrewed no one's willing to change for\nanother human being but we accept them\nto CH expect them to change for\nus if you can't handle me at my worst\nyou don't deserve me at my best which\nmeans I'm G that's code for I get to be\nan [ __ ] without\nconsequences you know\nso a friend of\nmine was upset because their ex started\ndating someone and then they found they\nthey they were stalking him online and\nthey were like oh\nwow they started feeling really good\nabout themselves because the person\nthey're dating now is less attractive\nthan they are they're like\ndowngrade this person totally downgraded\nI'm so much better\nlooking I didn't have the heart to say\nit but I was\nlike maybe they discover that there's\nmore to a relationship than looks\nbecause they seem really happy right now\nand there's more to a relationship than\nlooks cuz like sure there's like looks\nbut then at some point you know if you\nwant a relationship like I I think it's\nfine if I guess if you're in a\nshort-term kind of thing but even a\nshort-term kind of thing like having one\nstand with an [ __ ] still means that\nin the morning you wake up next to an\n[ __ ] so you know I think for those of\nyouall that are like okay like I'm not a\n10 out of 10 I'm average like don't give\nup because that's when you lose the game\ny'all get that when you GG out is when\nyou\nlose and you think that losing is\ninevitable so you never start playing\nthe game of life and then it becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy oh I'm destined\nto lose I'm destined to lose like like\noh my God\nlike why is life so\nhard right it's like that Meme of of\nlike the the dude who's like sticks the\nstick in the bicycle and is like or the\ndude who like shoots the dude in the\nchair and he's like why would you do\nthis to my life it's like you're the one\nwho's in\ncontrol and you've somehow learned that\nyou're not in control and that all these\npeople will only date other tents Ain't\nTrue by the\nway I want to say there's like a two to\nthree point swing okay so if you Glam up\nfrom a five to a six and a half and you\nluck out with sort of like a 2.5 kind of\nSwing you can end up with someone who's\nnine doable seen it thousand times\nokay yeah the Eric Andre\nmeme okay so like I totally get the yall\nwish that you were attractive I mean I I\ndo too like who\ndoesn't and the\ndifference is that and I I know it's\nlike I'm I'm making you know I I don't\nwant to make fun of y'all so apologies\nfor that but I think there's a big\ndifference like why do I believe the way\nthat I believe it's because I got really\nlucky and I ended up dating someone who\ngave me a\nchance I end up dating someone who is\ndecent and had faith in me and we look\nat this and like I'm a dude Okay so like\nI can't entirely speak for women here or\nso it's not my place to say this applies\nto y'all as women as well cuz I just\ndon't know but here's what I would\nsay a perfect man is not found a perfect\nman is made with like the faith and\nsupport of a partner right in my case\nI'm a heteronormative relationship so I\ncan't I mean I don't know what the\nDynamics of open relationships or gay\nrelationships I I don't know what I I\ncan't speak to that but what I can say\nis that like my success as a dude has a\nlot to do with the support of my\nwife and that's what that's night and\nday right and so the problem right now\nlike the reason that we have people who\nare struggling right left and Center is\nnot because we as the humans have\nsuddenly started sucking at life it's\nbecause we've stopped receiving\nsupport it's because we live in a\nsociety where people don't give you the\nbenefit of the doubt they don't give you\na chance to improve they expect you to\nbe perfect right off the\nshelf\nand so I strongly encourage yall to like\nif there's someone who you have a spark\nwith and they have red flags it doesn't\nmean that you can't have a relationship\nwith them the most important thing is is\nthis person willing to grow and are you\nwilling to grow because now we're in a\nsociety where no one wants to compromise\nand so like this is what\nhappens\nall\nright yeah so well said y'all deserve to\ngive yourself a chance and you deserve\nto give other people a chance and now\nwe're going to say the thing that's\ninsane other people you deserve to be\ngiven a chance by other people the first\ntwo everyone is like yeah Dr\nK like I deserve to give myself chance\nyeah let's go like believe in yourself\nother people Des deserve to give you a\nchance oh my God that's crazy I don't\nhave to give anyone a chance no like you\ndeserve to give people a chance like you\nowe it to them give them a\nchance how many chances as many as you\ncan\nmuster which red flags are run away\nversus I can fix\nhim there's only one red flag\nwhich I think is run I mean I'm sure\nthere's more but here's what what comes\nto my mind I can fix him is not the\nright attitude I can help him fix\nhimself is the right\nattitude that's the\nattitude right because you can't fix\nanother human being against their wishes\nnot going to work you can support them\nso a lot of compassion a lot of\nforgiveness a lot of Second Chances a\nlot of patience because here's the thing\nto understand\nif you try to fix\nsomeone what are you actually teaching\nthem I'm going to fix you what am I\nimplying about your capacity to fix\nyourself if I'm going to fix you subtly\nwhat you're doing is you're saying hey\nyou can't fix yourself so I'm going do\nit for you I know better you're not\nempowering that person by fixing them\nand this is what ends up like when when\nyou have like women who end up with you\nknow husbands and or vice versa right\nhusbands who end up with wives or I\nguess husbands who ends up with husbands\nwhatever where one person is fixing the\nother person you get one person who's a\ndoormat and one person who's\ndominant and that may work and this is\nwhere we say like oh like relationships\nshould be 50-50 like honestly in my\nclinical experience like I've never seen\na 50-50\nrelationship I think it's a great ideal\nto strive for but if y'all are in\nrelationships you know what I'm talking\nabout like it's not\n50/50 it's something you should strive\nfor\nbut come on what relationship is 50/50\nthis ain't a math equation okay this is\nlife and things aren't just divisible\ndown the middle and the the\nrelationships that are forcibly made\n50/50 are the ones that\nfail okay what I'm going to start doing\nis I spent 687 for groceries you spent\n529 for groceries so you owe me a13\ncents or whatever the [ __ ] I can't do\nmath 50 something cents right 58 cents\nlike that's not that doesn't work it\ndoesn't\nwork I forgot what I was talking\n[Music]\nabout yeah so I don't know I guess we're\ntalking about so here's another thing so\nI was I was at at TI and I it was fun to\nbe at TI because I got to be like a\nnormal person and so I was just talking\nto people about their lives and man like\ndating is is screwed\ndude it's y'all are y'all are in trouble\nbro I'm going to do what I can but this\nis where I need y'all's\nhelp so huge props to the people who\nposted\num\nokay why am I the hardest worker when\nI'm on the the clock but can't do\nanything for myself in my free time at\nthe various jobs I've undertaken I'm\nalways the last one who wants to quit\nI'm the one who leaps up to take the\novertime when everyone else wants to go\nhome I'm the one who volunteers to work\nSaturdays when everyone else is too busy\nI'm the one who takes the dangerous jobs\nthat no one else is willing to do I'm\nthe guy you go to when you need a\nwheelbarrow loaded with 5 80 lb blocks\npush through 25 me fud blah blah blah\nI'm the guy who basks in 100° heat and I\nthink it's great\nevery day is beautiful I'm the guy who\ncomes in to shovel snow on Christmas Eve\nbasically when whenever there's\nsomething that no one else wants to eat\nnone of the other men want want to man\nup and take a bite I come forward to\ntake the biggest bite that I can but\nwhen I am at home and tell myself to\nstudy a certain subject because it's my\nlifelong passion because it's the dream\nthat my entire future hinges on because\nit's necessary that uh necessary work\nthat needs to get done I just can't do\nit this has been going on for my entire\nlife for a little while this summer I\nwas studying for 30 minutes a day\npathetic TBH but it was all I could make\nmyself do okay this goes on for a while\nokay so we'll take a look at it maybe\nmore of it later\nbut\nso you're the hardest\nworker when it comes to other people but\nyou can't do anything for yourself when\nthere's a hard job to be done you're\ngoing to volunteer when there's overtime\nyou're going to do it when someone like\nwhen someone needs someone to do\nsomething you can do it but when you\nneed to do something for yourself you\ncan't so there's a couple of core things\nhere the first the core reason why we do\nthis is because we value other people\nover ourselves this is the root of the\nproblem the root of the problem because\nif someone else needs a sacrifice you're\nwilling to make it for them but you're\nnot willing to make a sacrifice for you\nlet's understand that it's very simple\nother people are worth more than you\nare it's not rocket\nscience\nright oh someone else is\nsick and they need like freshly cooked\nfood like okay I can make it for\nthem but if I'm sick ah all order to\ntake out like maybe you're sick and\nyou're not you know you're low energy so\nmaybe not the best example but the core\nreason that we're willing to bend over\nbackwards for other people and do\nnothing for ourselves is because we\nvalue other people more than we value\nourselves now how does this happen it\nusually starts with a sense of\nidentity that is dependent on the\napproval of others so this can be a\ntrauma response it can be all kinds of\nnot necessarily strict trauma but just\nif you think about your life what were\nyou applauded for were you taught that\nyou have intrinsic value or were you\ntaught that your value is dependent on\nwhat you give to others what have you\ndone for me\nlately if this is the upbringing that\nyou had or if this is the Social Circle\nthat you have now this is going to be a\nhuge problem for you because you can\nsacrifice for other people and why is\nthat because let's think about it right\nso if you're worth less than someone\nelse if you're not worth a whole lot you\ncan sacrifice yourself you can give\nyourself up right cuz it's not worth a\nwhole\nlot so it's\nworth an hour of my time to go to the\nairport and pick my friend up and an\nhour of my time to drop them off at\ntheir place and an hour of my time to\ndrive back to my\nplace to save them money right I'm going\nto spend three hours to save them $40\nbecause that's what you do when you're a\ngood friend my time is fundamental worth\nless than others and this becomes a\nvicious cycle because how do you start\nto devalue yourself it's because you're\ntaught early\non that you're not worth it and if\nyou're not worth it why bother investing\nin\nyourself right so on the weekend you're\nlike oh like I should do this but what\nare you worth why should you do that\nit's just for you and your time isn't as\nvaluable as other\npeople's and it comes down to Ego and\nconfidence\nbecause once we have an\nidentity okay so here's the other\nproblem is once we have an identity of I\ndon't have a lot of value as a human\nbeing now what happens is we become\ndependent on the responses of others to\npump ourselves\nup so on a weekend if I spend three\nhours doing something for myself versus\nspend 3 hours picking up someone up for\nthe airport and then that that friend\nfrom the airport which by the way they\nnever give me a ride which is okay right\nbecause I'm okay making\nsacrifices that's worth more than our\nfriend says hey thanks so much for\ngiving me a ride today you really helped\nout you're like\noh my God that feels so good oh my God\nso good oh my God give it to me tell me\nI'm good tell me I'm worth something I\nneed it from you because I can't get it\nfrom\nmyself and then when they don't\nreciprocate\nwe feel bad and what do we do\nto counter that feeling of Badness we\nconstruct this identity of like I'm\ngoing to sacrifice and a man sacrifices\nand that's what makes it okay so when\nother people walk all over me I'm going\nto cognitively reframe that as sacrifice\nand then I'm going to feel good about\nmyself and then think about what you've\ndone you've created a dynamic where\nwhere for you to feel better about\nyourself someone has to take advantage\nof\nyou think about\nit I feel\ngood when I sacrifice for someone else\nso this is really interesting okay maybe\nI'll pull up this paper let me see if I\ncan find\nit there's an interesting subtype of\ndepression called altruistic\ndepression okay altruistic depression is\nreally interesting\nit is when someone feels depressed\nunless they are doing something\nsacrificial for someone else when I'm\ngiving something up to someone then I\nfeel good about myself but the moment I\nstop being\naltruistic I start being\ndepressed and so what these people will\ndo people with altruistic depression\nthey will find lost\ncauses why do they find lost causes\nbecause if a cause is going to be fixed\nat some point then I don't need to make\nany more\nsacrifices think about it right this's\nliterally there's let me see if I can\npull this\nup give me a second\nchat no I know I have it somewhere I\nthink it's\nthis give me a second\nchat\nuh\ncan I can I look for something real\nquick\nnope\nyes yes found\nit okay let's y'all want to see like you\nguys want don't believe me let's look at\nscience nah come\nscience let's\nlook\nokay personality disorders\nRevisited all right a newly proposed\nmental\nillness so this is a subcategory of\ndependent personality disorder all right\nso these are people who are dependent\nall right but there's a very specific\nkind of dependence which people don't\nrealize because it's not like they're\nweak so when we think about dependent\npersonality disorder we think about\npeople who are like oh my God I can't\nmake decisions and like I need you to do\neverything for me no no no this looks\nvery different these people are very\nstrong they're very commanding but they\nstill have dependent personality\ndisorder\nokay um the case study reported a\npatient with suicidal ideation offered a\nnew type of dpd to advance personality\ndisorders research the new subtype of\ndependent personality disorder has a a\nfew key\ncharacteristics of the traditional\ndisorder yet reveals features that\nmirror nearly the opposite symptom\ncriteria making it unique as a distinct\nsubtype or possibly a separate\npersonality disorder of its kind the\ncase study patient report proposes a\ncomorbid diagnosis of blah blah blah and\ndependent personality disorder\naltruistic type so let's take a look at\nthis\nokay\num here we go so\nhere's\nokay let's find\nthis\nH okay hold on hold\non where's\nthe\nokay dependent personality disorder\naltruistic depressive subtype also\nreferred to as altruistic personality\ndisorder or adjustment disorder\naltruistic depressive type a mental\ncondition where patients have a\ndepressive mood when separated from the\nact of helping others the need to help\nothers fills a void or emptiness within\nthey have an excessive need to help\nothers or have others dependent on them\nwhen detached from the self-initiated\ndependent relationship self-initiated\ndependent right so you initiate\ndependency of other people onto you fear\nof loneliness and excessive depressive\nmood occurs that quickly resolves when\nreplaced by another attachment or\ndependency\nrelationship now we really don't\ndiagnose or treat something because\nthere's all kinds of diagnostic criteria\nthat you have to run through and stuff\nlike\nthis but this is what's what's going on\nright is there's a group of people out\nthere who are altruistically depressive\nthere's a group of people out there who\nderive\na sense of self and pride out of\nsacrificing to other\npeople and then what it results in is\nlike you're just not worth it so you\ncan't do anything for\nyourself right you can do everything you\ncan move mountains for another human\nbeing but you can't do anything for\nyourself and in my experience of working\nwith these people it comes down to Ego\nit comes down to this idea so the place\nto start with this first of all if you\nthink this fits go see a therapist\nnumber one right see if you meet these\nclinical criteria I mean I know we\ntalked about we just read one or two\nsentences that's not the same as making\na diagnosis right so a diagnosis is like\nall kinds of other\nstuff but then to to think about when\ndid you start believing that you're\nworth less than other\npeople right when did you when did you\nlearn that even doing anything for\nyourself is considered selfish and\nshould be\navoided and if you want to break this\ncycle you have to start valuing yourself\nmore and now if I tell you to do that\nit's not that easy it's hard right so\nnow what I want you to pay attention to\nis if I say start valuing yourself more\nwhat your mind will naturally do is come\nup with all these kinds of\nobjections but but but and we're not\neven going to argue with the objections\nit's not going to work instead what I'm\ngoing to ask you to do is ask yourself\nwhere you learned this where how did you\nstart believing all this stuff that's\nthe question you should ask\nyourself right how did I get to believe\nI'm not saying that it's not true or\ntrue or whatever I'm not arguing with\nyou if you tell me that other people are\nworth more than you fine I'm not going\nto argue but just ask yourself how did\nyou come to that\nconclusion right every other human being\non the planet is equal but me I'm less\nthan everybody\nelse right look at that it's absurd and\nstill you believe it fine you're right\nI'm wrong fine fine I'm not going to\nargue with you just ask yourself how did\nyou learn to believe this and chances\nare somewhere along the way somewhere\nearly on you were taught that others are\nmore important than you you were taught\nthat your value as a human being this is\nespecially true of men by the way also\ntrue of women but I I guess it's not\nespecially true of men I'm just thinking\nabout a couple of men and then I started\nthinking about a couple of women so\nlet's give you all one example of\neach so I was working in a\njail and I met a 19-year-old kid who was\nin jail for their third or fourth drug\ndealing offense so I was like you know\ntell me about your life and I asked them\nyou know why did you start dealing drugs\nand they said that I have three older\nsisters and then our our dad\nleft and so Mom was out of the picture\nand so then my sisters came to me and\nsaid a man\nprovides and I was 14 and so I started\nselling drugs because that's what a man\nis supposed to do\nokay now some of y'all are going to\nlisten to this you'll be like oh my God\nwomen are evil no they're not evil these\nthree women may have been evil but\nhere's another example of a woman right\nso young\nwoman mom passes away gets parentified\nby her\ndad so Dad suddenly she's like the woman\nof the house so instead of like she's\nlike 16 has to start cooking has to\nstart cleaning has to start doing all\nthis stuff like you know\ndoes one year of college dad says\neverything is falling apart Here Without\nYou doesn't actually explicitly say that\nbut like doesn't learn how to take care\nof himself so she feels guilty quits\nafter about 8 months makes it through\none semester a couple months into the\nother one then comes home to take care\nof\ndad he's not quite as explicit about it\nbut he's like doesn't take any\nresponsibility for selfcare so then she\nhas to do\nit this is what happens so what does she\nlearn in that moment what does he learn\nthe needs of others are more important\nthan\nmine I'm worthless it's okay for me to\nsacrifice my future if it takes care of\nmy dad it's okay for me to wind up in\njail for the third time if it means\npaying the bills for my sisters because\nthis is what a good man or woman does\nthat we make\nsacrifices and then we become less than\nthose around us and if we ever try to\nadvocate for ourselves if we ever try to\ndo something for ourselves here's the\nother thing to look at you will feel a\ntorrent of\nguilt the moment that you think about oh\nmy God like maybe I should finish this\nyear of college you'll feel this like\nwall of guilt that'll come crashing down\non\nyou and this is what you've taught and\nthen what happens is we become\nintolerant of our\nguilt because if we're guilty that means\nwe did something wrong\nso here's something to understand about\nguilt in the\nbrain you do not feel guilty when you do\nsomething wrong you feel guilty\nfirst and then the limic system and a\nMIG not so much amydala but lyic system\nprimarily goes to the analytical parts\nof your brain and says we feel\nguilty give us\nreasons why what we're doing is wrong\nthe immoral Behavior doesn't come first\nthe guilt comes first and then your mind\nreverse Engineers Engineers that you did\nsomething\nwrong which is precisely why if you talk\nto someone who feels guilty and it's\nlike very tough and concrete you can try\nto logic with them that they didn't do\nanything wrong but it doesn't work right\nthey're like no like you don't\nunderstand and other people have tried\nto logic with you but they're like\nyou're like no they don't understand no\none's going to be able to take care of\nhim\nand so if you're overwhelmed by guilt\nwhen you start taking care of yourself\nthis is something that you've got to\nwork on you've really got to dig into\nhow did this\nhappen therapists can definitely help\nwith this kind of stuff by the\nway great question does every emotion\ncome first almost\nalways although there's contrary\nevidence to that but let's just say yeah\nfor\nnow\nokay\nokay it's an interesting\nquestion um so someone saying guilt\nhelps the grind might be useful okay\nhold on a second hold on a second hold\non a second we never said this wasn't\nuseful in fact you're brilliant for\nrealizing that this is useful so when we\nhave when we're someone who sacrifices\nfor everyone around us that enhances our\nrelationships in many ways in fact the\nreason we develop this way of thinking\nis because it's\nuseful right so if you're a 14-year-old\nboy and your sisters tell you a man\nprovides if you say no what happens to\nyou your dad has disappeared mom is out\nof the picture it's just you and your\nthree sisters if you say because you're\n14 you say no I ain't a man I'm a boy\nyou can't say\nthat right like you can't do that so\nguilt is absolutely useful guilt is one\nof the most useful emotions that we have\nit is the most powerful change well\nguilt not necessarily shame is stronger\nbut guilt is one of the most guilt is\nthe signal that our brain gives us to\nallow us to conform to other\nhumans guilt is critical for the\nmaintenance of relationships it's very\nuseful incredibly useful which is why\neveryone feels it youall get that it's\nnot a bug it's\nfeature right so it's it's very use\nuseful it's just out of control so\nremember that all of your emotions are\nuseful whether they're damaging or\nhelpful on balance depends on who's in\ncontrol are you in control or is the\nemotion in control so emotions are\nprimarily serve two positive functions\nin my mind this is how I break it down\nan emotion is a source of information\nand a source of\nmotivation and if you are not in control\nof those two things so when you feel an\nemotion the first thing you should do is\nask yourself what is this emotion\ntelling me because here's the thing\nabout an emotion your brain is\nprocessing all kinds of information that\nyou're not consciously aware of so an\nemotion is basically a tldr for a\ngigantic pile of information I'll give\nyou all just a great\nexample so let's say that I walk into a\nroom of my\nfriends and one of my friends says yo it\nsmells like up\ndog and everyone's looking at me right\nand I don't quite understand what's\ngoing on and I walk in and I'm like hold\non a second something's weird is going\non right so I don't know if yall have\never walked into a room and your brain\nis like be on guard you're in danger and\nyou start to feel\nanxious and then like you see that\nsomeone's like trying to suppress a\nsmile and they're like yeah it does\nsmell like up\ndog and they like everyone's like\nlooking at you you're like\noh my God what's going on right so then\nyou feel anxious that's your brain\ninterpreting all these tiny little\nsignals this very flattened affect that\neveryone has where they're not smiling\nso they're not relaxed because normally\nwhen you walk into a room with your\nfriends they like yo dude what's up but\nthey don't say that everyone's like\nwatching you and they're\nlike not smiling and then you start to\npanic a little bit right so that's ask\nyourself what is this what is this\nemotion telling\nme the second thing is what is this\nemotion d driving me to do and then to\ntake a step back from your default\nreaction to the emotion that's when it\ncontrols you when you react to the\nemotion without thinking it through and\ninstead take a step back and ask\nyourself okay in this situation\nobjectively what do I want to do not\nwhat do I feel like doing and then what\nyou want to do is use that emotion as\nfuel right so just to give you all an\nexample if I get like a c on a test and\nI feel ashamed of\nmyself I feel shamed so bad oh my god\nI'm an idiot I'll never be able to do\nthis and then my mind tells me let's\ncheat bro cuz you're not going to be\nable to get an A and we really need to\nget an A and it's really important to\nget an A this isn't good enough so let's\ncheat and so the emotion is driving you\ntowards performance\nImprovement but if you listen to it and\nyou end up cheating then you're going to\nbe in trouble right so you still want to\npay attention to what's it telling me\nit's telling me that this is important\ndo I actually want to cheat it may be\nwhat I think think is the best but the\nmore I think about okay I really need to\nspend more time on this and try to come\nup with some alternative to what your\nmind tells you to do when you're feeling\nemotional oh my God I want to break up\noh my God I want to get back together\nhold on a second yall know what I'm\ntalking about it's the yo-yo oh my God\nwhy did I get back together with this\nperson don't yo-yo just pay attention\nokay what is it that you want well I'm\nfeeling lonely I'm feeling unloved okay\nwhat can I do to build something that\nwill satisfy that and that's really how\nyou utilize\nemotions okay all\nright let's do some other stuff real\nquick how do I fix my son's gaming\naddiction he is going to repeat the nth\ngrade my son is 15 years old and he is\ndiagnosed with ADHD and autism he spends\na lot of his time playing World of\nWarcraft which his dad also plays and\npays for the game nice\nI put a strict schedule on him daily\nwhich includes homework first before\nscreen time and gaming and gaming is\nrestricted to 2 hours per day or until\n800 p.m. when dinner is ready after\nwhich he showers brushes his teeth and\ngoes to bed at 9:30 trying to get a\n15-year-old to shower and breath his\nteeth is a daily struggle w w I didn't\nthink much of it until I have received\ncomplaints from his teachers about him\nnot engaging with class misbehaving and\nnot doing his school work I also\nreceived a call from the school stating\nhis grades are so bad that he is going\nto stay in nth grade next year I\nimmediately told my husband to cancel\nthe subscription and uninstall all of\nthe games on the family computer I set\nit up so he cannot install anything on\nit without my password I've not seen the\nsub subscription on our joint account I\ndid not realize until later that he\ncircumvented the\nboundaries that's my 15-year-old boy\nwith autism in ADHD let's go I placed on\nhim by lying and saying he has no\nhomework so he can game he snuck our old\nlaptop in his in his room to play in the\nmiddle of the night past bedtime and he\nhas been cutting school to play the game\nin the library I received a phone call\nlater that day telling me that he hasn't\nbeen in school he was grounded\nimmediately I took away his switch\niPhone and remove the keyboard and mouse\nfor two weeks and he is expected to be\nhome right after school and that the\npunishment will be expend extended for 2\nweeks after he is not back by 3:30 for\nthe most part he complied after\nrealizing that he's going to repeat the\nninth grade the confiscation will be\nindefinite I enrolled him in summer\nschool and told him he he will get his\nstuff back if he passes summer school\nand have a minimum grade of level of C\non all the classes consistently next\nyear ever since I confiscated his games\nin the computer he has been snapping at\nme giving me and his father a bad\nattitude when I tell him to do chores he\nbarely finishes them and does it most\npassive aggressive Manner and\nhalfast he has been getting into\nperiodic temper tantrums and breaking\nthings like a 2-year-old he will become\nhas become extremely disobedient the\nlast straw was when I found a 6 day\nsubscription card in his room which he\nused his allowance to pay for behind my\nback and sneaking into the library to\nplay the game and sneaking a laptop I've\nalready hid into his bedroom to play\nI've stopped giving him money and I have\nasked my husband to do the same I'm at\nmy wits end with him and I have no idea\nwhat to do I've tried finding other\nactivities for him to do but everything\nthat I that everything but that stupid\ngame bores him even Netflix doesn't\nsatisfy him he's very easily bored and\nwhen he's bored he gets incredibly\nobnoxious I spoken with his doctors who\nincreases Aderall dose nice throw more\nAderall at the problem and have given\nhim additional medication ooh additional\nmedication I'm only seeing a small\ndifference parents help all\nright\nso sometimes we have\nchildren who like to play video games\nand then as parents we stop them from\nplaying video games because the video\ngames are harmful so I will stop it\nbecause we can't afford to have you\nharmed and then we get into this what I\ncall is kind of like it's an arms race\nokay parent institutes\npunishment kid levels up his stealth\nbypasses parent institutes more\npunishment child develops hacking skills\nbypasses\nit right so this is like it's an\nescalating arms race of punishments\nfollowed by\nbypassing so if you're in this situation\nright and if y'all are like me you've\nbeen the child in the situation where\nyou figured out cuz here's the thing you\nknow Tech better than your parents\ndo you're going to win this game right\nand then Parents try to force you to do\nsomething and what do you do you're\ngoing to half ass it because it's about\nthe letter of the law right because as a\nkid you're not bought in you don't agree\nwith this crap so you will check the Min\nthe boxes you will do the minimum\nrequired to get the game back because\nthis is a war where parents are taking\nit away and you're going to take it back\nthis is what\nhappens so how do we fix this so this is\nthe first thing that we say in HG right\nso first of all it's healthy gamer it's\nnot no gaming no gamer that's not what\nwe say healthy\ngaming so when you're dealing with\nsomeone who's got an\naddiction you can't make them sober\nfirst thing to understand impossible\nto be sober for someone else you can\nrestrict as much as you want to as a\nparent and this is what changes when\nyou're talking with 15y olds right so\nlike you it's easier to restrict when\nyou have a 9-year-old harder to restrict\nwhen you have a\n15-year-old because they're going to\nbypass you then they're going to go over\nto a friend's house and they're going to\nplay there right cutting class so when\nyou took the game away at home what did\nyour child actually do they started\ncutting class and going to the library\ntheir grades got worse your\ninterventions are having the opposite of\neffect and that is always going to\nhappen when it is you against your\nkid because they're not bought\nin the other problem that I frequently\nsee is if we look at this post\nokay I put a strict\nschedule I didn't think much of it I\nalso received a call I immediately told\nmy husband sounds like husband listened\nI have not seen the subscription I did\nnot realize I when I tell him to do\nchores he barely finishes I've stopped\ngiving him money I've asked the husband\nto do the same I'm at my wits\nend so when it comes to Parenting a kid\nwith video game\naddiction you need parents on the same\nteam and it sounds like Dad is not\nopposing mom but it also sounds like Dad\nis not\ninvolved so what does the kid think in\nthe\nsituation dad's a\ndoormat dad and kid used to play\ntogether and now the dad is listening to\nMom so now what's actually happened is\ndad is being bullied by Mom and the kid\nperceives it this way so now like the\nreason that this parent is at their\nwit's end is because there's actually\nit's not one-on-one it's Dad and kid\nagainst Mom but Mom is saying but he's\ndoing everything I'm asking but he's not\nactively involved so let me ask yall a\nsimple question okay so y'all are Gamers\nright if you've got one parent who plays\na game with you and Y all raid together\nand you've got another parent who takes\nthe game away or tells you that you\nshould stop playing which parent are you\nmore likely to Listen to If the parent\nwho raids with you comes and says hey\nbro you should really do your work and\nthat's more important than rating right\nnow like who are you going to listen to\nthis is the\nproblem so in any kind of of gaming\naddiction kind of scenario the goal is\nnot restriction the goal is to teach\nrestraint the goal is Independence what\nis your job as a parent it is to prepare\nyour child for the world and I hate to\nbreak it to you but if you force them\ninto passing\nclasses\nwhile creating this arms race and\njacking up your military might in terms\nof Parental enforcement what do you\nthink is going to happen when the kid\ngoes to college what do you think is\ngoing to happen when kid has a job what\nare you going to do are you going to\nforce them to study you going to move in\nwith them when it goes to college are\nyou going to make sure that they have\ntheir morning Monday morning huddle\nready when they're in year or two of\ntheir job how long are you going to\nparent and this is the problem this is\nthe problem with parents right we're not\nwilling to let our kids repeat the ninth\ngrade like oh my God this is a disaster\nwhat does the kid want to\ndo right so this is where I would\nstrongly recommend you have a\nconversation with your child about what\ndo they want what do they want out of\nlife what do they think about failing\nthe ninth\ngrade because you you\ncan't you can't for like you can force\nthem but only so\nfar and I think at some point you know\nlike you can try to set as many limits\nas you can to protect them from failure\nbut then what you end up doing is you\nbecome the\nenemy and like they detest you for it\nand they end up bypassing you and\nfailing anyway so they can fail with\nyour help or they can fail without your\nhelp the failure is still the\nsame and so I think it really starts\nwith a\nconversation which is what we're all\nabout here at H it's like a conversation\nwhere what do you want from your life do\nyou want to stay in the ninth grade for\nthe next three years would you rather\njust drop out of school like what do you\nwant to do what do you want from your\nlife and we as your parents like this is\nwhat our responsibility is this is what\nour job job is if you want to play games\nlike we want to support that but you\nneed to be doing this other stuff\ninstead as well what gets in the way of\nthat these are the kind of conversations\nthat you you need to have because you\ncan't make someone be\nsober now this is this this issue is\nfurther complicated because the kid has\nautism so there's data that shows that\nthe worst kind of games for someone with\nautism to play are MMO RPGs like World\nof\nWarcraft mmor RPGs have the highest rate\nof tantrums and other kinds of\nbehavioral disturbances in autism games\nare highly addictive and something about\nthe neuroatypical mind for a kid with\nautism it can be very very satisfying to\nplay WoW and here's the thing to\nunderstand when you have a kid with\nautism they're playing the game of life\nand no one explains the rules and\nfurthermore they have certain empathic\ndifficulties have difficulty doing\nthings like making eye contact forming\nsocial connections reading between the\nline lines so they're playing the game\nof life with like either the mouse or\nthe keyboard or the monitor\nunplugged so life is\nhard and this is why they Retreat into\nvideo games because they're they don't\nknow how to play the game of life and\nthat's not their deficiency it's that\ntheir brain is different in some ways\nthat makes it hard for them to play a\nnormal game of\nlife now Along Comes World of Warcraft\nwe have Community we have challenge we\nhave a character that I can\ncustomize we have an endless amount of\ncontent\nand suddenly the most important thing is\nwe have something where the rules are\nclear so why would I want to play this\ngame where I get made fun of it's hard\nfor me I don't understand how everyone's\nable to do this when I can play this\ngame over here that makes me feel good\nabout\nmyself and these are the kinds of things\nwhere if you have a kid with autism you\nknow and hopefully if yall have autism\nyou had parents who were able to do this\nwhat you really have to do is help them\nplay the game of\nlife and the more that that you're able\nto help them engage it's not about\ntaking the game away this is where\nparents trip up they think the game is\nthe problem the game the game is\nabsolutely contributing but you take the\ngame away but you're not giving them\nsomething to replace it\nwith right it's it's about encouraging\ntheir engagement with life through\nconversation through understanding and\nsometimes through\nconsequences and you say okay the\nconsequences I took the game\naway and then your kid started cutting\nclass so now I'm going to take the money\naway I'm going to take everything away\nI'm going to take everything away until\nthey can't ever play the game and do you\nthink suddenly if you take everything\naway they're going to wake up one and be\nlike yay I love school I'm going to get\nstraight\nA's they will do the minimum required to\nget access to the game again and now\nwhat have you done as a parent you've\nmade all of the thing about the game do\nyou guys see that the game is the only\nthing of value you've actually worsened\nthe problem because everything that they\ndo is in service to the game the game\nbecomes their God and anything that\ngives me access to the\nDivine instead of creating other things\nin their life through punishment you\nmake it more and more and more about the\ngame if I do this do I get the game if I\ndo this do I get the game if I do this\nso the only thing in their mind is the\ngame it's become the\nultimate so this is a problem with\nrestriction you're actually valuing that\nthing higher so I think if you're a\nparent who's stuck in this situation I\nwould talk to your medical professionals\nabout psychotherapy instead of throwing\nmedication at the\nproblem I think it also requires to to\nparent and not a general and a soldier\nand also to understand that like if\nyou're in this situation where you have\na you know a parent who plays games with\nthe kid setting limits is going to come\nway better from the parent who plays\ngames right so like let's say I've got\ntwo friends one of my friends is a\ndrinking buddy and one of my friends is\nsober and vegan not that the two have to\ncome together but for some reason I felt\nlike tossing that in nothing wrong\nagainst veganism and then if you're\nvegan sober friend is like bruh you\ndrink too much or girl you drink too\nmuch you're less likely to if you've got\nsome degenerate guy who's like you know\ngoing drinking with you or we're Gamers\nright so forget about drinking let's\ntalk about games let's say you've got a\nfriend\nwho\nplays City skylines 2 and you've got a\nfriend who's been queuing up with you in\nLA or doter MOA of choice for the last\n15\nyears and one of your friends is like\nbro you should stop playing that MOA\nyou're like yeah you don't know what\nyou're talking about but if your friend\nwho plays mobas with you is like hey I\nthink mobas are ruining your life who\nare you more likely to listen\nto right when you're degenerate friend\nis like hey you're playing too much who\nare you more likely to listen\nto so parenting a kid who's got a\nproblem with games is not a solo job and\nthis is where like the problem is that\nyou're at your wits end\nbecause your partner is not\ninvolved you're doing the work of two\nand then you're going to run out of\nwit right and have a conversation with\nkid what do you want from your life what\nare you excited about what are you not\nexcited about you're 15 just because\nyour kid is has ADHD and autism doesn't\nmean that he's not attracted to someone\nmen women something in between who knows\nright like what do you think W how do\nyou think wow is going to work for your\nRo rtic relationships is that something\nthat's important to you is friendship\nimportant to you is Success important to\nyou is money important to\nyou have these kinds of conversations\nand get them on your side because when\nwhen y'all can find some common ground\nwhen your kid comes to you and says this\nis important to me and then you say okay\nI will help you achieve your goals but\nas a part of that I think we're going to\nhave to be careful with the gaming I'm\nnot saying you don't have to play I'm\njust saying if you want to have a\ngirlfriend one day like you may want to\nstart going to the gym right so like I\ncan take you to the gym three days a\nweek if you\nwant right and someone's saying found my\nhusband in wow absolutely dude two of my\nfriends got married who played wow\ntogether and wow brings people together\nI've even seen like weddings in World of\nWarcraft so it's not that's that's my\npoint is that the game is not evil right\nit's it's the lack of relationship with\nyour kid it's the lack of okay what do\nwhat what do we want from life and if\nthe game is gives us what we want then\nthat's\nfine but it doesn't give us what we want\nthen we need to find that common ground\nand that's how we build\nwith okay\nnext\nuh I was the ADHD gamer child who whose\nparents blamed video games ah this is\ncool now that I'm older with resentment\nand Trauma I want to mend\nthings posted by dingdong\nshalong one of us chat literally one of\nus all right shortly before I went into\nMiddle School my mom started a business\nshe didn't have the time to constantly\nbe there for me anymore and my father\nwas more of a distant mediator wow chat\nsound familiar she would get home from\nlong hours at work find that I was Miss\nI had missing assignments and we would\nget into fights every other night I used\nMinecraft to cope with my unstable home\nlife and emotions so my mother ended up\nblaming video games for being evil\naddictive influences she pulled a\nclassic move of turning off the internet\ntaking them away requiring them to be\ncertain places at bedtime\nEtc every time I told her that I wasn't\naddicted she wouldn't listen because I\ndid play video games a lot but it was\nactually that I was using it as a form\nof escapism and had horrible mental\nhealth I was also diagnosed with ADHD\nbut by the time my mom backed away and\ntried to get me\nhelp I hated her for all the stress\nfights and ruining my mental health in\ngeneral as if I wasn't struggling by\nmyself enough when I started thriving in\nlife at school by my own valtion she\nstill refused to let me play video games\nso I talked with my dad and he bought a\nNintendo switch behind my mom's back ah\nnow it's fun right so now we've got Mom\nand\nDad fighting doing things behind each\nother's back this is a recipe for\nSuccess she found it from snooping in my\nroom ooh snooping sounds like we're in\nan arms race again and freaked out so\nthis hatred towards video games\npersisted after I was getting A's and\nmaking friends like a grudge now I am 20\nmy parents divorced a year before I\ngraduated high\nschool who's I that's would be cynical\nto say who's surprised that's mean so\nwe're not going to say that and then now\nthat I'm in college I look up to my dad\nwhile I still resent my mom remember\nchat we this is like a mirror of this\nother one I wonder if this is the same\nsituation recently my mom has been\nbreaking down at family gatherings like\ndinner or holidays about how she is\nsorry and she wants to fix things yet\nshe still doesn't listen to me she still\nmakes snide comments about how video\ngames are evil just the other night at\ndinner my brother an extremely\nsuccessful and ambitious person tried to\ntell her that he was excited about\ncreating a video game and he said wow as\nif there's not enough of those in the\nworld with a passive aggressive smile my\nbrother called her judgmental and she\ngot defensive she says she is sorry but\nis unwilling to listen for the first\ntime I actually chimed into this\nconversation I said that she needs to\nwork on herself before I actively want\nto spend time with her or text her she\nsaid she's sorry and she loves me but\nthat doesn't help she refuses to be\nsorry for all of the little things and\nshe she did and refuses to listen when I\ntell her what what I think I don't want\nwant a general apology I know that she\nunderstands she is somehow at fault for\nmessing our relationship up and I know\nit was out of care for me but that isn't\nthe problem the problem is that she\nstill she somehow still makes\nconclusions about me like the video\ngames were the reason I was doing poorly\nin school and refuses to accept that\nthese are wrong I know what she did\nwrong she just refuses to listen my\nopinions are an attack on her she says\nshe's sorry and she loves me over and\nover again but if she's unwilling to\nlisten to my perspective then I don't\ncare I already know she loves me saying\nthat doesn't help and is beginning to\nsound like an excuse for her\nactions however I know that going no\ncontact with her would crush her she is\nstill human and still my mother I'm not\ngoing to leave her behind and abandon\nher because I also think that some part\nof me will be forever unsettled without\nresolving things with her what can I do\nwhat a fantastic\npost\nso I'm so proud of this community for\nlike doing posting stuff like this so\nlet's understand a couple of things\nthe first thing to understand is that if\nyou're trying to repair a\nrelationship saying I'm sorry which can\nbe\ntrue and saying I love you which can be\ntrue is not necessarily sufficient for\nrepair right so let's understand this\nwhen someone says I'm sorry I have no\ndoubt that this person's mother when\nthey're at family gatherings is filled\nwith regret and when we're filled with\nregret we say I'm\nsorry and then we love them right we say\nI'm sorry and I love you because these\nare things that we feel In This\nMoment The key thing about sorry that a\nlot of people don't understand saying\nI'm sorry doesn't fix\nanything right I don't know if you've\nseen these like non- apologies apologies\nI'm sorry you feel that way this is\nsomething we do really well as\ntherapists and sometimes it's reasonable\nright because people are projecting but\nI'm so sorry that you feel that way I\ndidn't say I did anything wrong I'm just\nsorry that your stupid ass feels this\nway because you're so narcissistic and\nyou\ndidn't right we got to be careful about\nthat so here's the main thing so if\nsomeone keeps on saying I'm\nsorry and they don't listen to you what\ndo you do so here's the question I would\nask\nthem what are you willing to\ndo if you're sorry what is your sorry\nWorth right what changes can I expect\nfrom you I understand that you regret it\nand I see that that's genuine but going\nforward how do you plan on changing\nthis so this is what because for them\nthey don't realize that saying I'm sorry\nisn't enough right so you ask them an\nopen-ended question and put the ball in\nyour court what is your sorry\nworth what's your understanding of what\nI'm upset\nabout what what did you think you did\nwrong because what we see here is\nactually something really subtle which\nis sort of a self-centered\nparent because the parent thinks a\nparticular thing I don't care what you\nthink I don't care about your beliefs\nand I'm not going to listen to you and\neven now with all of their sorries\nthat's just as self-centered because I\ndon't care what you think I'm sorry I'm\nsorry it's about me it's about my regret\nmy love for you my regret my love I\ndon't care about your feelings I'm not\nlistening to your feelings my regret my\nlove I'm crying I'm hurting me me me me\nme and then what happens this is what\nhappens right so when people are kind of\nself-centered like this and things start\nto go\nwrong we look for something to blame\nbecause as long as I can blame video\ngames then I don't need to take\nresponsibility as a parent it's not my\nfault it's the video game's fault y'all\nsee that so now this person is running\nit and if y'all are working with someone\nwho's kind of self-centered like this\nyou got to be super careful because in\norder for this person to admit that\nvideo games are not the problem that\nmeans something else has to become the\nproblem and that means that I have to\ntake responsibility and I don't want to\ndo that because if I if your life is\nscrewed up and this is what's hard for\nparents right the hardest thing for a\nparent to do is to admit that we did\nsomething bad for our kids\nthe hardest thing to\ndo is I hurt my kid I screwed up the one\nthing that I'm supposed to do well that\nis the most important thing I screwed up\nand I screwed up because I was\nnarcissistic and I didn't\nlisten hard to do that which is why it's\nso hard for them right so that now I've\ndemonized the games and the games are\nevil and so I I think really like\nliterally like what you do is you ask\nthe parent what kind of changes are you\nwilling to make I understand that you're\nsorry I accept your apology and this is\nwhere you got to be subtle right I\naccept your apology going forward I\nforgive you for whatever you\nregret going forward how I engage with a\nrelationship with you basically depends\non whether you're going to repeat the\npast or not so I understand that you\nregret it what are you willing to change\ngoing\nforward and that's where like they're\ngoing to get\nsquirly\nlike they don't no I'm just supposed to\nsay I'm sorry I don't need to change I\ndon't have to do\nanything right so you just ask them\nwhat's your sorry worth what does this\nmean for us going forward that you're\nsorry help me understand like what does\nthis mean is this are you going to\nchange the way that you you talk to me\nI'll do\nanything\nokay\nlisten what are you hearing me say so I\nwould I would start not by convincing\nhim just asking lots of questions\nopen-ended questions what do you think\nabout my gaming what do you think I\nstruggled with why do you think I was\ngaming so much CU they're\naddictive and that's when you can say\nlike so when someone has a particular\nView and they say they're going to\nlisten this is the technique that you\ncan use to see if they're actually going\nto listen you can tell them I'm about to\ntell you something that is different\nfrom what you think let's see if you're\ncapable of\nlistening the games weren't the problem\nmy emot Health as a teenager was the\nproblem the games were an\nantidote they were a symptom not the\ncause what did you hear me\nsay right and they're going to be like\nthe games are the problem but blah blah\nblah and that's when like you give him a\nshot and then you can say I hear that\nyou said you were going to listen but I\ndon't hear you actually listening I hear\nyou sharing your opinion again and not\nreally listening to mine you're allowed\nto have your opinion I have no problem\nwith it but going forward I just don't\ndon't want to engage in this\nrelationship\nbecause it's falling on deaf ears I'll\nsee you at holidays and stuff like that\nI love you I'm grateful that you're\nsorry and I forgive you for that I still\nlove you I'm grateful that you love me\nat the same time I don't see that you've\nactually changed much so I just you know\nyou were part of the problem back then\nand you can say that if you want to let\nhim have it right you're part of the\nproblem back then and I I just can't\nhave you as a huge part of my life until\nyou're able to change this\njust say it to\nthem and they're like oh my God I'm so\nsorry okay what am I\nsaying I don't know what do you want me\nto say they'll say that I don't want you\nto say anything I want you to listen and\nthen you kind of peace out you can say\nwe can try this again in a\nweek so this is the other thing to\nunderstand when dealing with people like\nthis you don't want to go 10 Rounds all\nat once you want to go one round and\nthen you pull out and then you give it\nanother shot you want to go 10 Rounds\nover 10 weeks not 10 Rounds all at once\ncuz they'll keep going circular they'll\ndo as many rounds as you want to right\nnow and we'll go nowhere it's like we're\ndriving on a racetrack that's a loop and\nthey're like we'll do as many laps as\nyou want to but we won't end up\nanywhere so what you got to do is pull\nout of the conversation and give some\nthem some time to think about it you\ndon't have to cut them off right so\neveryone the internet's like cut them\noff cut ties\ngo no contact go low contact like no\ncontact no contact no\ncontact and it's really easy for people\non the internet to tell you to go no\ncontact because they feel like yeah [ __ ]\nthem but you're the one who actually has\nto deal with the guilt you're the one\nwho has to deal with your family calling\nyou texting you why don't you call your\nmother I can't believe that you didn't\ngo home for the holidays don't you know\nthat she carried you around for 9 months\npopped you out of her uterus and\nbreastfed you for so long\nand you have no heart\nyoung it's like the people on the\ninternet aren't Fielding those phone\ncalls and sometimes the people on the\ninternet are they're not wrong right\nbecause sometimes it it requires a lot\nof encouragement to go no\ncontact and they say like it really\nworked for me and this is the only way\nto do it because this is what worked for\nme so like their heart is in the right\nplace I think I hope some Merit to it\nbut as we said like often times we don't\nwant to cut off our family we want to\nrepair things with our family and\nsometimes that involves going no contact\nfor a while and then trying to get back\ninto things but this is literally you\nknow what you do is you talk to them and\nyou see if what their understanding of\nwhat does sorry mean to you once someone\nsays they're sorry what does that do to\nthe\nrelationship and the more that you kind\nof get them thinking and engage with\nconversation like the better off you're\ngoing to be and don't try to do it don't\nspeedrun it don't speedrun the\nconversation this is something that is\nthis is we're talking like grinding okay\nokay for like not even grinding but like\ndoing your dailies like instead of\ngrinding 10 hours all at once just do\nyour dailies\ntoday get whatever like your quest\nrewards are and then like don't grind\nfor diminishing returns that's the\nattitude that you want to take when it\ncomes to like maintaining relationships\nyou put in a little bit on a daily basis\nor a little bit on a weekly basis over\ntime is going to be worth way\nmore than like 10 hours all at\nonce so do your dailies with your mom\nall\nright\nokay so now we are going to make an\nannouncement\num wait how do I hold\non there we go okay so hold on hold on\nchat hold on calm down calm down\nchat all right\nso\nokay so we have a announcement to make\nso for a while\nchat y'all said I should write a\nbook and I have done that and this is\nour first\nbook um and it is how to raise a healthy\ngamer so I know it sounds kind of\nweird\nbut this\nbook is for th this book is what should\nhave been written 20 years\nago and this community would be in a\ndifferent place if this book was written\n20 years ago so when I look at the work\nthat I\ndo\nokay I try to help y'all and if if we\nlook at like why I do what I do so why\ndid I leave my job and you know quit my\nacademic position at Harvard and all\nthat good stuff when I was finishing\nresidency I had some amazing teachers\nwho gave me some amazing job\nopportunities so someone even said hey\nwe'll like build a video game Addiction\nRehab for you and you can you can run it\nand we'll like put up the capital and\neverything like we believe in the work\nthat you're doing and stuff like that\nand my problem was that if we look\nat\nwhat y'all need I don't think that y'all\ncan\nwait for me to become a researcher and\ndo 10 years 15 years become the world\nexpert in video game addiction or\nanything like that like there are all\nthese options out there and then it\nleaves so many people\nbehind and so the problem that we face\ntoday as Gamers is only getting worse\nparenting is getting harder so the rates\nof autism in ADHD are on the rise which\nmeans kids brains are more prone to\nvideo game addiction and if we really\nlook at like what are we going to do\nabout this problem I know that I'm here\nto help yall and I help yall most I mean\nmost of my time has spent thinking about\ny'all but if I really think about what\nwould have the most impact if I had to\nwrite one book before I die and this is\nthe way that I thought about it what\nwould that book be it would be to help\nthe next generation of kids to help\nthose of y'all that are becoming parents\nand honestly it was inspired by my own\nbeing a parent right so I'm I'm a parent\nto two kids and they're awesome and\nthey're fantastic and what I realize is\nparenting is way harder I me we talk\nabout like problems with relationships\nwe talk about the economy all that stuff\nis true for us right we're\nstruggling adding parenting as a layer\non top of that when you have billion\ndooll\ncorporations that spend tens of millions\nor hundreds of millions or even billions\nof dollars a year to take a 9-year-old\nor 5-year-old or 2-year-old and get them\naddicted to a device we're seeing the\neffect of it already with\ny'all right you can't stop using a\ndevice it's like you know what we should\ndo as a\nsociety is part of toilets the next\nupgrade for toilets is not some fancy\nbedet or seat warming or something like\nthat it's putting a phone charger into\nthe side so that you can charge your\nphone while you're on the toilet I\nguarantee you the charger that is used\nthe most often will be the phone toilet\ncharger right it's building Wi-Fi hubs\nin toilets\nscreens touch screens on toilets that's\nthe next thing because that's we we take\nit\neverywhere right someone saying I\nalready have\nthat so I I wrote this book and I I it's\nit's based on our work we've been\nworking with parents for about four\nyears now and many of yall may not know\nthis and honestly the reason is because\nparenting is hard like it's getting\nexponentially harder like it's hard to\ndate right now that's getting\nexponentially harder but it's like your\nkids minds are being pulled by this\nstuff right it's crazy like what they'll\nend up doing if you let them and I think\nthe problem is that most parents don't\nknow what to do about\nthis because they try to it's just like\nthe parent that we saw from today like\nthey try to restrict they try to take it\naway because you can see as a parent\nlike this thing is screwing with your k\nso what do you do naturally as a parent\nyou take it\naway when your when your kid is playing\nwith a\ncactus and they have like all these like\nCactus spines like in their hand and\nthey're hurting and crying what do you\ndo as a parent you're like remove the\ncactus take the danger away that's our\nparental\nInstinct this is the first problem that\nwe've really had in human history I\nguess other addictions kind of qualify\nbut they're not as pervasive as\nthis where you want to take it away and\nyour kid wants more of it that's what's\ndifferent right cuz it's not like every\nkid grows up smoking like so once the\naddiction starts that's fine we're\ntalking about 2-year-olds\nthree-year-olds I don't know if yall\nhave walked down the grocery store aisle\nyou'll see kids are on their phone\n2-year-old is on the phone in the car on\nthe\nphone at school it's a mess and then all\nthese problems kind of come out of it\nlike all these like Echo Chambers\nforming and all this kind of stuff and\nlike things just get worse and worse and\nworse and the problem is that the\nparents are\noutgunned because what are you supposed\nto do as a parent you were never taught\nhow to do this your parents didn't have\nto deal with this\nstuff so what are you supposed to do\nthere's a whole generation of kids\nthat's going to be more screwed than we\nare and I know that the majority of the\npeople in our community are not parents\nbut that number is changing with each\npassing year and the reason it's\nchanging with each passing year is\nbecause people in our community are\nstarting to be more compassionate\ntowards each other they're improving\ntheir social skills they're getting into\nrelationships they're using WOW to get\nmarried and then they're getting laid\nand having\nkids good\njob and as our parent as our community\nturns into parents and I think the\naverage age of someone in our community\nis like over 30\nnow right like we need to help them\nthere's a whole generation of kids that\nwe need to\nhelp and I really think that's that's\nwhat it is\nnow I'm already thinking about number\ntwo and number two won't probably won't\nbe apparent book I've got a couple good\nthings in the pipeline but this is our\nfirst book you'll ask me to write one\nI've been working on it for a couple of\nyears and it's going to be published\nsoon so y'all can use exclamation point\nbook\nto get uh I guess pre- I don't know just\nlike get access to it um and you guys\ncan basically find the book anywhere\nwhere that books are sold so we're going\nto show you all the cover one more time\nbut it is how to raise a healthy gamer\nnow the other thing is for those of\ny'all that\nare are you serious what what it's\navailable for pre-order it is available\nfor\nokay look I wrote the thing okay I know\nbut\nit's okay it's available for pre-order\nthat's corrected they know that now okay\nI I just write the thing I don't know\nabout all this stuff all right know okay\nso one other thing that I will say even\nif y'all are not\nparents\num the the one thing that I will say is\nfor those of you that are interested in\nrelationship building and\ncommunication this is the book there\nthere are sections of this book so like\njust to like explain a little bit about\nit this is all about how to develop a\nrelationship with your child and the\ngood news is that the skills in this\nbook are going to apply to basically any\nrelationship building okay so even if\nyall aren't parents and y'all are\ninterested in like okay I want to learn\nhow to communicate the way that Dr K\ndoes I want to learn how to Foster\nrelationships the way that Dr K does I'd\nstrongly recommend youall check check\nout the book and apparently it is\navailable for pre-order okay um you can\nfind it basically anywhere books are\nsold and uh yeah so that's our\nannouncement book number one is complete\nis coming out I think in February or\nMarch I'm not 100% sure and then\num yeah and so I'm yeah I I I wrote it\nbecause I'm trying to help all the\npeople that will grow into you I wrote\nthis book for cuz I was thinking about\nwhat could I have done like what would\nhave changed the course of your life and\nI think honestly it's your parents\nreading this book little late for that\nbut we're going to fix we're going to\nfix it with the Next\nGeneration\num yeah spoiler the content yeah I\nmean so it hopefully will help yall with\nrelationships in general because that's\na big part of it right so a big part of\nit first thing is to understand how\ngaming affects brains and so if you all\nare strugg struggling with like gaming\nas well it could absolutely be useful to\nyou it's geared a little bit more\ntowards parents and then it's it's more\nabout there's like mental health\nintersections with gaming so ADHD and\nmarijuana and stuff like that but mostly\nit's it's giving a parents like a\ntoolkit and a plan to fix the situations\nthat we talked about right it's to teach\nparents how to listen because the the\nnature of listening has\nchanged how to reconnect with your kid\nlike that's what it's really about it's\nabout repairing your alliance getting on\nthe same\nside\nokay uh Dr K is the book good for self-\nreparenting honestly probably\nnot and maybe gruy will come in here and\nsay no don't say the book isn't perfect\nfor everything it that's not what the\nthat's not the intended audience if\nyouall want to learn how to Foster\nrelationships and you want to learn\nabout how video games affect your brain\nand mental health that it's good for\nthat I think is appli to everybody but\nthe specific like regimens in there are\nreally designed the audience's\nparents\num yeah so for those of youall that\nwanted it for other things don't worry\nwe're not done this is the beginning not\nthe end okay hi hi can you please shout\nout happy Z 17 he used an audible credit\nto purchase the audio version okay so\nhack7 hacki Zak 17 has used an audible\ncredit to purchase the audio version\nalready so hacki act 17 you may be the\nfirst purchaser of our first book\nyeah thank you very exciting very\nexciting do they know that you're\nnarrating the audio and I'm narrating\nthe audio so you're going to hear me\ntalking to you for hours and hours and\nhours\nokay\num yeah so so definitely itely check it\nout y'all uh it's it's a book that was\nis made with love um and here's the\nother thing so I wrote this book not\nbecause I'm an expert parent I wrote\nthis book because I'm one of y'all so\nthis is the thing you know everyone says\nwe we saw it today but everyone says\nlike you know my parents don't\nunderstand my parents don't understand\nmy parents don't understand I wrote this\nbook from your shoes not your parents\nshoes because the thing is the the\nparents today like we don't know how to\ncommunicate with them in order to listen\nso I kind of like took y'all's side if\nthat makes sense the reason I think the\nbook is so good is because it shares\nwith the parents the stuff that they\nnever think\nabout when it comes to gaming in their\nkids it shares with them all the stuff\nthat I wish my parents had known as I\nlisten to y'all over and over again in\nthe problems that you struggle with I\ntry to represent those problems right so\nwhether it's marijuana use or or ADHD or\nAutism like explaining like okay why\ndoes a kid with autism you can't just\ntake away his game so I'll just give you\nall just one example\nokay so one of the things that we\nexplain in the book is that games are no\nlonger games parents don't understand\nthis we call them video games they're\nnot games these are careers they're\ncommunities they're friendships they're\nromances and so what parents don't\nunderstand is when you take a child's\ngame away you're not taking away a game\nit's not entertain\nyou're taking away their future you're\ntaking away their connections you're\nisolating them you're forming you're\nmaking them more lonely you're also\nsabotaging their social relationships\nbecause when you take away a kid's game\nwhat happens the next day at school you\ngo to kid all your friends are you go to\nschool all your friends are like yeah\nthat was awesome last night when we\nplayed this guy and we like I can't\nbelieve we won and we made like a you\nknow a comeback at the last second and\nthen you don't get to participate in\nthat what are yall doing this week\nweekend oh let's all hop on and we'll do\nthis and like this this DLC just got\nreleased let's all play you don't get to\nparticipate in that so I don't think\nparents understand the impact that games\nhave on\nkids positive impact and so to help a\nparent really understand these kinds of\nthings and really help the kid to listen\nto what a child wants from their life\nand it's kind of like what we try to do\nwith y'all we try to listen to okay what\ndo you want us to help you with tell us\nwhat you want your life to be and we\nwill do the work to smooth the path for\nyou we'll make it easy for you we'll\nbuild a guard rail we'll build stairs\nwill help you climb to the top you tell\nus what you want out of life and we'll\nhelp you build it and what we really try\nto do in this book is share that\nphilosophy with with the parents which\nis what the which is the philosophy that\nthe parents have themselves right that's\nwhat they know they're supposed to do\nthe problem is they see you playing the\ngame and then suddenly it's like\nah and it's it's not even their fault\nbecause the parents are like like I\ndon't think they it's so hard because\nyou see if you're a parent you see your\nkid getting sucked into this stuff I\nmean we we heard of a case today where\ncancel the wow subscription kid finds a\nlaptop starts skipping class goes to the\nlibrary uses their allowance to buy game\ncards right kid does so many things and\nthen what are you going to do as a\nparent you're going to panic oh my God\nthis kid is not thinking straight he's\nfailing out of school he's cutting class\nall because of this game\nand so their reactions are completely\nnormal and they don't\nhelp and so we're trying to do I know\nthat there's a lot of stuff a lot of\npeople in our community struggle because\nof the relationship that they had with\ntheir parents when I really think about\nwhat is the largest amount of impact\nthat I can have with in this\nworld it's not actually focusing on\ny'all it's trying to help the next\ngeneration of people cuz when I think\nabout what if your parent was different\nwhat what would this community look like\nif every parent in this community every\nevery person in this community their\nparents listen to them more help them\nbecome the person that they wanted to\nbe because what I hear from y'all over\nand over and over again is like my\nparents were this way am I\nscrewed and my first instinct was no\nyou're not screwed and here's how you\nfix it but in the back of my mind I was\nthinking what's the problem here the\nproblem here is that the parenting\nwasn't good and not wasn't good but you\nknow could be\nimproved and Travis is saying I'm\ndestroying my consumer base you're damn\nright I am you're damn right I am my job\nis to destroy my consumer\nbase in Dota Get Wrecked noobs no but\nseriously that's our mission our our\nmission here I'm saying this from the\nbottom of my heart may not be good a\nbusiness model maybe gruy will come in\nin a second but the mission from the\nbottom of my heart is for yall to no\nlonger need this this this channel our\nwork is done when our viewer count to\nzero that's when our work is done that's\nthe goal it's Independence\nseriously I want to play games\nchat like seriously when y'all can take\ncare of yourselves then I get to go on\nvacation I'm not\nkidding I can go back to practicing\nclinical medicine and seeing patients\nand you know whatever playing video\ngames and maybe go back to working with\nEsports teams or like whatever like that\nthere's tons of stuff for me to do\nbut I can't do that yet because we're\nnot\ndone okay so with that from the bottom\nof my heart I love yall thank you so\nmuch for coming today and by all means\ncheck out how to raise healthy gamer how\nto raise a healthy\ngamer um and you can pre-order it with\nuh exclamation point\nbook I got to bounce but y'all take care\nwe'll see y'all this week sometime okay\nthank you all so much
