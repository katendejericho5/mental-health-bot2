    "transcript": "ventilating our emotions can be helpful\nbut what's really really important is\nprocessing our emotions and I've seen\nthis mistake be made by therapists as\nwell where there's some therapists that\nI've worked with and some therapists\nthat I've learned from that sort of will\nsay things like yeah you know therapy\njust takes time and we're going to sit\nthere and we're going to let the patient\nfigure things out I'm going to take a\nmore passive role and I had one Mentor\nfor example who told me that it took\nthree years for the patient to make a\nbreakthrough and they hadn't really made\nmuch progress then and then what I was\nsort of wondering is like what the hell\nwere you guys doing for the first 2 and\n1/2 years so sometimes therapy is not a\npassive experience of just ventilating\nyour feelings because as you all know\nsometimes those feelings can keep coming\nback over and over and over again you\ncan feel sad every day for a year and\nit's not like journaling that sadness\nout necessarily makes it better"
