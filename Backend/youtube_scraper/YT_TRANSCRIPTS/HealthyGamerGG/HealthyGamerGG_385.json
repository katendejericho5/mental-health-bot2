    "transcript": "technically entering the flow state is\nimpossible and today we're going to\nteach you how to do\nit there are a lot of productivity Chads\nout there talking about the Flow State\nand if you look at stuff like Harvard\nBusiness Review in like Huffington Post\neveryone's like oh my God like the Flow\nState the Flow State everyone should\nenter the Flow State once you get into a\nflow State you can do this if you want\nto be more productive and have a side\nhustle learn how to enter the Flow State\nand yet there are very few resources is\nthat actually tell you how to\nconsistently enter the Flow State and\nthe reason for that is because\ntechnically entering the flow state is\nimpossible and today we're going to\nteach you how to do it so let's take a\nstep back and understand exactly what\nthe flow state is because that'll tell\nus why it's impossible to enter one and\nalso how to enter one the first thing to\nunderstand is that the flow state is a\nstate it is not an action it's not a\nverb so as human beings we can do things\nthat are verb BBS I can for example read\na book I can hold up a pen I can smile\nand wink these are things that I can do\nbut the flow state is a state of mind\nyou cannot do a state of mind a state of\nmind is something that happens to you so\nthis is a really critical discovery that\nyogis in Ancient India made a couple\nthousand years ago is they sort of\ndiscovered that you can't actually go to\nsleep it is technically impossible to go\nto sleep what you can do is go to bed\nyou can lay down and then hopefully if\nyou're lucky the state of mind that is\nsleep will happen to you and this is\nsomething that you may actually be very\nvery familiar with because if you're\nlike me there have been times in your\nlife where you try to go to sleep and\nyou try really really hard to go to\nsleep you get into bed and you're like\noh my God I need to go to sleep I need\nto go to sleep oh my God it's so late\nI'm going to be so tired tomorrow oh my\nGod sleep sleep now sleep now dumbass\nsleep sleep and then the harder you try\nthe harder it is to actually attain\nsleep and the flow state is exactly the\nsame way where it's not something that\nyou can do the good news is that much\nlike actually falling asleep there are\nmany things that you can do that will\nfacilitate the state of flow and yogis\nare able to consistently enter a state\nof flow or stay in a state of flow for\nhours if not decades at a time so let's\nunderstand what's involved the first\nthing that you need to enter a flow\nstate is a state of UST stress so by\nstress I mean EU the prefix that is\nmeans good stress so we're all familiar\nwith distress which is what we sort of\ncall stress nowadays we refer to it as\ndistress which is stress that is bad\ncauses me problems and in order to\nattain a flow State we need a healthy\namount of stress so if we're trying to\ndo a task and the task is too easy what\nthat does is induce boredom on the other\nhand if the task that we're trying to do\nis too hard that will induce distress\nand will feel overwhelming in both of\nthese situations it leads to a Wandering\nmind so if I'm bored by a particular\ntask at hand what's going to happen with\nmy mind I'm going to start thinking\nabout other things but what about the\ncase of being overwhelmed so if I'm\noverwhelmed about writing this paper\nthat needs to be written by Monday at\n8:00 a.m. then what's going to happen is\nin addition to focusing on the paper my\nmind is going to be thinking all kinds\nof other things like what if I don't\nwrite the paper fast enough what if it's\nbad I should have started earlier should\nI ask for help should I email an\nextension what will the the professor\nthink if I email them for an extension\nwill they give it will they not give it\nwill they think I'm pathetic so if you\nthink about the the state of mind when\nyou're overwhelmed you're not just\nthinking about the task at hand you're\nactually thinking a lot of other\nthoughts so instead what we want is a\nstate of something called UST stress\nwhere our attention is going to be\nengaged and focused so if we look at the\npart of our brain that governs you\nstress it's the this part of our brain\ncalled the reticular activating\nformation so the RAF is actually a\nprimitive circuit kind of in the back of\nour brain that sort of governs our\nability to be awake and alert and\nfocused on a particular thing and it\nturns out that the RAF is uniquely\nsensitive to cortisol which is a stress\nhormone and by uniquely sensitive what I\nmean is that you require some of it to\nactually activate the RAF but if it's\ntoo much it sort of causes problem in\nthe RAF and if it's too little the RAF\nis kind of like half assing it so we\nliterally need a decent amount of stress\nchemical and so if you're struggling to\nactivate the RAF you're if you're\nstruggling to get engaged with a task\nthere are two things that you can do to\nput yourself in the US stress State the\nfirst is that if you're bored what you\ncan do is change the frame of the task\nto make it more challenging so this is\nsomething that like I used to do so I\nused to be pretty good at RTS games\nand then eventually like when I played\nwith my friends like I'd always dumpster\nthem right cuz I'm Dr K right\nhere son and so what I would start to do\nto like make things interesting for\nmyself and you know this if you're a Pro\nGamer is you'll like start to restrict\ninternally the limits that the units you\ncan use right so I I was playing\nStarcraft and I would go like all\nfirebat so I'd like pick some lame\nstupid unit that like isn't that good\nbut I'm going to see if I can challenge\nmyself and LOL if I can crush them with\nonly firebats it will make me an even\nmore epic gamer and this is also\nsomething that I use for people who are\nbored by school which is that I'll tell\nthem okay instead of like trying to\nlearn the material pretend that you\ngoing to teach the material a week from\nnow or pretend that you are going to\ntutor in the material a year from now\nand so by sort of increasing the\ndifficulty of the task internally it'll\nactivate more cortisol recruit your RAF\nand keep you engaged on the flip side if\nthe task is overwhelming there are a\ncouple of things you can do to bring\nthat stress level down so generally\nspeaking when we feel overwhelmed we\ndon't feel overwhelmed because of the\nactual tasks at hand the reason we\ntechnically feel overwhelmed is because\nof an emotion so if we look at sort of\nthe sensation of being overwhelmed in\nthe psychology like the cognition of\nbeing overwhelmed it's actually driven\nby emotions because even if you have a\npaper do in 48 hours if you can sort of\nground yourself emotionally sort of calm\ndown and sort of develop a plan of\nattack you can sit down and actually\npound that work out so if you're feeling\noverwhelmed the primary thing you need\nto do is actually metabolize the emotion\nthere are a couple of simple ways to do\nthat one really good way to metabolize\nemotion or calm down emotion is through\nbreath so we know for example that\nbreath has a reciprocal relationship\nwith emotion so when I start breathing a\nparticular way or sorry when I start\nfeeling a particular way I will start\nbreathing a particular way so if I like\nstart breathing like\nthis\nwhat do youall think I'm feeling right\nnow right and on the flip side I can\nstart breathing like\nthis and if you start hyperventilating\nhyperventilate with me for a\nsecond you start to feel like really\nuncomfortable right you can induce that\ndiscomfort with your breath and the flip\nside of it is also true that if you take\na long deep breath and what we really\nwant to do is focus on Long\nexhalations\njust stop breathing close your eyes for\na\nsecond if you change your breath the\nemotions will change with it so if\nyou're feeling overwhelmed you can even\nsee pay attention to my voice right I\ncan feel myself calming down with a\nsingle breath my voice is changing my\ntone is changing and it's literally that\nsimple the more you practice it the\nbetter you'll be there are other kinds\nof emotional metabolism techniques you\ncan use you can Journal you can write\nthings out you can talk to to a friend\nbut literally breath is the most\npowerful and sudden thing that you can\nuse to lower your stress levels and feel\nless overwhelmed so now we have the\nfirst of three things that we need to\nenter a flow state which is a level of\nuse stress and so our brain needs a\ncouple of other things to enter a flow\nState what we know about flow States is\nthat they involve a synchronicity of\nactivity across the brain so it's not\nthat one part of your brain is active\nand another is inactive it's is actually\nthat all parts of your brain are kind of\nuniformly active so what are the other\nthings that we need to capitalize on the\nsecond thing that we need to enter a\nflow state is a lack of ego so when\nyogis were sort of studying the Flow\nState they discovered a couple of things\nstep number one is when I meditate on an\nobject let's say I'm meditating on a\ncandle or something like that there's me\nin here and there's the candle out there\nso what I'm going to do is I am going to\nlook at the candle and I'm going to\nfocus the attention of my mind on the\ncandle and then if I focus the attention\nof my mind on the candle long enough\nwhat will actually happen is the eye\nwill dissolve and if you enter a flow\nState you kind of know what I'm talking\nabout where you sort of lose sight of\nyourself as an entity you kind of become\none with the thing that you're doing you\nbecome sort of like an elemental like a\nan elemental of the task at hand right\nwhere you're one with writing you're one\nwith playing the game you may even felt\nthe sort of the Zone when you're playing\na game where you become sort some sort\nof like channeling the Divinity of this\nvideo game where the gods of DOTA League\nof Legends or valerant are coming and\ninhabiting your body and you are playing\nat a level that is beyond what humans\nare capable of and this is what happens\nin the flow state is that if we\ntechnically look at it the ego actually\ndissolves and what the yogi sort of\ndiscovered is that once we focus on\nsomething we enter this second state of\nmind which is basically like the Flow\nState called called and this is where\nthe object and the subject become one so\nhow do we sort of keep our ego from\nentering the picture because as long as\nthe ego is active we will not attain a\nflow state so we can look at a couple of\nthoughts that result in ego or that come\nfrom ego so one is any thought of\ncomparison this is rooted in the ego\nbecause I can't make a comparison\nwithout there being an I right if I say\nthis person is smarter or stupider than\nI am I have to have an intell that I'm\nkind of aware of so as long as a\ncomparison is being made all comparisons\nrequire a sense of identity I'm talking\nabout comparisons between you and other\npeople they require sense of identity\nand as long as you're making a\ncomparison in your mind you won't enter\nthe Flow State and that makes perfect\nsense right so if I'm like trying to\ncram for a paper that's due in 48 hours\nif I'm thinking oh my God I wish I was\nmore disciplined like this other person\noh man I should have started like this\nother person why am I like this why\ncan't I be disciplined like my older\nbrother like like my older sister who\nalways gets straight A they're The\nGolden Child why am I such a screw up as\nlong as your mind is making comparative\nthoughts you will not enter the Flow\nState so this is the one thing that you\nshould really really steer away from do\nnot indulge those thoughts at all so if\nyou're trying to enter a flow State and\nyour mind is making a comparison or\nmaking a judgment about who you are I'm\nso pathetic I'm so this I'm so this\nbreathe breathe in feel that cold air\ncome in and let all of those thoughts\nliterally go out with your breath and\nreturn to the task at hand and now we\ncome to the third thing that you need to\nenter a flow state which is a focus\nlevel of concentration this is actually\nthe first step that the Yogi's\ndiscovered which is the which is called\nDar so this is the one thing that you\ncan actually do which is to focus your\nattention on a particular task for an\nextended period of time so you don't\nrandomly like slip into the flow state\nright so if I'm just like walking down\nthe street LA la la la I don't like slip\ninto a flow state of writing my\nbeautiful amazing fiction novel what you\nactually have to do to enter a flow\nstate is to start the task at hand and\nthen you require a sustained attention\nfor that period of time and this is\nwhere I would actually recommend formal\nmeditation practice to literally level\nup the skill of focus so I really like\ncertain practices like bratara practices\nwhich y all can find in Dr K's guide but\nI'll give you all a simple example of\nthis I really like fixed Point gazing as\nthe most direct meditation technique\nthat will prepare you for a flow state\nso fixed Point gazing is literally that\nhey just a quick note a lot of people\nwill ask us what do I do next and that's\nwhy we built Dr K's guide It's a\ncomprehensive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience both as a\nmonk and as a psychiatrist and it's\ndesigned in a way that's tailored to fit\nyour needs so if you're interested in\nbetter on understanding your mind and\ntaking control of your life check out\nthe link below so what we're doing is\nwe're looking at one particular Point\nwithout blinking for as long as we can\nnow I like this technique for a couple\nof reasons the first is that it's hard\nand so remember that when we do a\nmeditation technique that is easy like\nobserve your breath oh like pay\nattention to the breath see all of the\nBeauties in the breath oh my God the\nbeauty the universe the life\neverything's in the breath you sit there\nand you're like okay I'm\nbreathing this is boring I'm going to\nstart thinking about something else so\nwe need a technique that is challenging\nto once again engage that RAF so that\nour mind stays focused this is why I\nlove fixo gazing because what we're\ngoing to do is stare at something for 30\nseconds 45 seconds 60 seconds without\nblinking and the harder it becomes the\nmore you kind of engage it and then over\ntime you will kind of get better at it\nand so this will all strengthen your\ncapacity for darh so what I would sort\nof recommend is a a candle gazing\ntechnique this is calleda where you're\nbasically like with a half LED gaze\nlooking at a candle for an extended\nperiod of time you can see we we've got\nYouTube videos about it you can check\nout Dr K's guide if you want more\noptions and stuff like that they're both\ngreat but basically you should practice\nthis technique called draa this is the\none thing that unfortunately you're\ngoing to have to practice I'm sorry that\nsometimes if you want to learn how to do\nstuff like consistently enter the Flow\nState you got to actually practice stuff\nokay what I've done is I've done my\nlevel best to reduce the amount of\npractice that yall need to do so that\nyou can have a high yield meditation\npractice that will engage you and force\nyour concentration because as you do the\npractice your mind will start telling\nyou hey we need to Blink we need to\nBlink we need to Blink and so literally\nwhat you're doing is restraining your\nnatural impulses and putting all of your\nfocus into not blinking now I'm not\nsaying that you should go without\nblinking for like 10 minutes at a time\nyou want to work your way up right so\nstart it with 15 seconds 20 seconds 30\nseconds but when it starts to feel to be\na little bit too much go ahead and blink\nand close your eyes even and then let\nthat sort of relief kind of wash through\nyou it's going to feel amazing youall\nshould definitely try it okay and so\nkind of coming back to the Flow State\nwhat it turns out is that if you want to\nenter a flow State consistently it's not\nsomething that you can do which is\nprecisely why there's such crappy\nguidance about how to consistently enter\nthe Flow State the good news is that the\nyogis BAS basically figured out how to\nenter the Flow State on their way to\nsort of these psychedelic spiritual\nexperiences and this is where like the\nreason the yogis care about the flow\nstate is they didn't care about\nproductivity danana is the flow state is\none of the steps on the way to something\ncalled samadi which are these\npsychedelic experiences in meditation\nwhere you feel one with the universe and\nyou see your past lives and you can\ntravel through time and like all this\nkind of you can feel the Infinity of the\nuniverse and you feel connected with all\nthe other human beings like this all the\ncrap that even there you know fmri\nstudies that show that this stuff does\nweird things to your brain and so they\nsort of figured out that okay if we want\nto have these cool psychedelic\nexperiences we got to learn how to enter\nDeon consistently and what they sort of\ndiscovered is there three things you\nneed you need some level of you stress\nright so your reticular activating\nformation is engaged and you're focused\ncan't be overwhelmed can't be bored\nsecond thing that you need is you need\nan absence of ego because literally the\nflow state is the dissolution of the\nself and the merging of with the task at\nhand and the third thing that you need\nis you need a mind that is strong enough\nto be able to sustain your focus on a\nparticular task and the reason that's\nimportant is the longer you can stay\nfocused the greater the probability that\nyou will enter the Flow State at any one\nof those moments and so the other kind\nof last analogy that I'll use is if we\nsort of think about going to\nsleep if I can stay in bed for long\nenough eventually I will fall asleep I'm\nnot going to fall asleep walking around\nso if I really want to give myself the\nbest chance of entering the state of\nsleep what I really need to do is try to\nstay in bed as long as possible and\nthat's what Thea does so hopefully with\nthese three things y'all can\nconsistently enter the Flow State and\nonce you're able to do that like trust\nme it's awesome like it really makes you\nso much more productive it's how my lazy\nass got into Harvard Medical School I\ndidn't like suddenly become disciplined\nwhat I did is I was able to enter the\nFlow State I was able to study for 2\nhours a day when all my colleagues were\nlike friends were studying 10 12 hours a\nday and since my state of mind was so op\nlike everything just kind of sank in and\nlike I did pretty well in med school so\nyou all should absolutely do this and\nhopefully it'll\n[Music]\nhelp"
