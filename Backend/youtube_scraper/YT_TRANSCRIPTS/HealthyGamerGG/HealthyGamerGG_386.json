    "transcript": "you know everyone's worried about the\nimpacts of AI on mental health and there\nare definitely cases where people have\nlike emotionally leaned on AI to the\npoint where things get kind of crazy\ntowards the end and there's evidence\nthat shows that basically the The More\nYou Talk to an AI the deeper you go into\na conversation the weirder the AI\nbecomes so the first five questions that\nyou ask in AI about your mental health\nwill be like pretty okay but then if you\nask 50 questions 52 questions 53\nquestions the deeper into a conversation\nyou go the less data the AI has because\nall these AIS are trained on the\ninternet and the internet is usually\nsurface level conversation so people\nwill sort of worry about that but\nactually the the impact that I'm the\nmost concerned about in terms of AI and\nmental health is not some hypothetical\nimpact but is the very real impact of\nhow AI affects people's jobs and\nlivelihoods"
