    "transcript": "the last thing to do if you plateau in\ntherapy is simply find another therapist\nthis is something that I've done a lot\nactually with my patients where if we're\nstalling for a while we'll sit down and\nI'll say okay like we're stalling it\nseems like you're not making much much\nprogress let's think about how we want\nto approach this we can try this we can\ntry this we can try this and we'll do\nsomething like come up with a six-month\nplan and at the end of those 6 months\nwe'll re-evaluate because not every\ntherapist knows everything and each\ntherapist has their own strengths and\nweaknesses that they bring to the table\nthey have particular problems that\nthey're good at dealing with and\nsometimes actually the best thing to do\nif you're plateauing in therapy is to\ntry a different kind of therapy or try a\ndifferent therapist"
