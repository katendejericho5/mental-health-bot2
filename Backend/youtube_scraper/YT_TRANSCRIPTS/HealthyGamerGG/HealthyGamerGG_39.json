when when we say work on\nyourself that involves all kinds of like\nthings about moving your life forward\nand they struggle with motivation in\nthese things\nit's because when I don't think I'm\nworth\nit I'm not worth fixing\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\noh\n[Music]\nwhen you develop empathy and compassion\nfor other\npeople there's going to be room for\nsomeone else in the\nrelationship and then this in turn is\ngoing to reduce the feeling of being an\nobject now two people can\nconnect and now it's not about getting\nyour needs met in\nStarvation it's about two human beings\nforming a relationship\n[Music]\nhello\nchat how are we doing today happy Friday\neverybody welcome to another healthy\ngamer GG stream my name is Dr Alo kenoa\njust a reminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly and um yeah so here is what we've\ngot um so today we have an interview\nwith danant TDM who is an amazing\nYouTuber who's got like almost 30\nmillion subscribers which is insane so\nmakes awesome awesome content we are\nlucky enough to be talking to Dan today\nabout whatever he wants to talk about so\nuh for those of y'all that don't know we\ngo into this stuff relatively blind\nwhich is what we do on purpose so we\ndon't do a whole lot of research on\npeople sometimes I've heard of people\nI'm aware of who they are vaguely\nbut we tend to find that we get the best\nconversations when we don't bias\nourselves based on the opinions of the\ninternet um we are yeah so I I know it's\nbeen a little bit since we've streamed\nand stuff we kind of took a break um we\nmade a ton of content in May so we were\nstreaming like three times a week and in\naddition had um uploads that were going\nup on our YouTube channel so we did did\neverything from Deep Dives to interviews\nto you know lectures to Q&A to like more\nfun stuff um we also had some uh content\non the membership side so we were sort\nof producing a 3X rate uh and then yeah\nso we took a break for a little while um\nbecause we definitely needed it uh we're\ngoing to be traveling a little bit next\nweek um and then I'll be taking a little\nbit of time off in July so we don't want\nto get burnt out and all that good stuff\nbut we we still do have I think a lot of\nlectures that will be uploading for you\nall to check out I feel very very\nconfident in many of them um I think\nthere's a lot of really cool stuff\ncoming down the pipeline so stay tuned\nbut just wanted to let yall know that\nyou know it's been a little bit of a\nbreak we recognize that we all need a\nbreak after Mental Health Awareness\nMonth um yeah\nso I think uh we can actually hop into\nthe interview so let me just see if Dan\nis around yall doing okay chat we doing\nokay um let's see if Dan is ready\nuh okay cool Dan is here so we are just\ngonna hop right in so let me do\nthis um and then I got to do this hey\nDan hello hello okay let me can you just\ncount to 10 for me yes one two three\nfour 5 six S 8 9 10 perfect I think\nwe're my first test we're set let me\njust go to this and hopefully this will\nwork no GG give me a\nsecond\num okay and then let's go here there we\ngo there you are lovely hello\nhello welcome how are you I'm doing well\nman how are you yeah I'm doing good too\nyeah yeah so C can you start by just\ntelling me what do you what do you go by\nwhat do you prefer to be called uh just\ndone is fine cool\nand um it's a pleasure to meet you Dan\nthank you so much for coming I\nunderstand you have a gigantic YouTube\nchannel yeah it's pretty yeah it's\npretty big yeah what's up with that\nman literally like I ask myself the same\nevery day to be\nhonest yeah it's like yeah we're closing\nin on we on 29 million soon I guess but\nyeah it's it's crazy and and how long\nhave you been making content on YouTube\nit will be I think it's 11 years soon if\nit's not already passed but yeah just\nover 10 years wow cool and how did you\nget\nstarted I started making YouTube videos\nfor so I'm obsessed with Pokemon cards\nokay and I used to play the game like a\nlot of people collect but don't actually\nknow how to play the game but I used to\nplay the game and there was a small\ncommunity for that it's massive now but\nit used to be much smaller and I started\na channel called Pokemon Dan level 45\nwhere I would go over like strategies\nand stuff and that grew to a decentish\nsize for the hobby it was maybe like\n10,000 Subs something like that but it\nwas enough to fund basically self fund\nthe hobby so I got a sponsor from like a\ncard shop and then and that's how I got\ninto YouTube and then for the gaming\nside I used to watch when Minecraft\nstarted like blowing up on YouTube I\nused to watch like the yogs cast Captain\nSparkles all of those people um I was\nlike you know what I already make videos\nI started recording some of the Pokemon\ngames for the Pokemon channel so I'd\nalready kind of figured out the\ntechnical side of it which is way\ndifferent back in like 10 years ago uh\nso I kind of was like you know what I'm\njust going to try this on the side why\nnot and then the side Channel became the\nmain Channel it just absolutely blew up\nI think it took like a less than a year\nto go absolutely crazy so wow and what's\nyour understanding of why it blew up so\nfast\num actually I think it was just I've\nseen what other people were doing so it\nwas like the first wave of YouTubers\nwe're saying like uh like yogar Captain\nSparkles skyers Minecraft that kind of\nthat kind of group and\nthen I was part of maybe like the second\nwave I guess where I'd seen what they\nwere doing and then felt like I could do\nthe same but then got into like story Le\ncontent like solo story Le content which\nnot many other people were doing so it\nwas taking Minecraft applying stories to\nit and being able to upload that like\nevery day pretty much okay so it sounds\nlike consistency was really important\nwhat do you mean by story Le\nMinecraft so mod reviews were a big\nthing and they're a bit more the old\nones were more like tutorials so mods\nwere coming out like every day like so\nmany mods were coming out every day not\nlike now and so there there was content\nall over the place and\nusually people would download the mod\nand then go through it tell the user how\nto use it so it was way more tutorial\nwhereas I would have these characters\nwhich would experience the mod with me\nso I'd still tell people how to use the\nmod but it was more from like a story\nperspective than tutorial perspective so\nit's a bit more fun and then from that I\ntook all the stuff I learned from these\nmod reviews and buil like my own mod\npack basically to tell stories like I'd\nliterally make my own stories in the\ngame so you could only really get that\ncontent from me basically so that that's\nwhen stuff really went crazy yeah that's\nsuper cool man and and so you you still\nmake Minecraft\ncontent I stopped for a while uh there\nwas a por there's a I can't remember\nwhat year it was but there\nwas there was a time on YouTube where\nMinecraft just fell off a little bit and\nI probably didn't play it for like two\nor three years\num and at that point I kind of\ntransitioned into just general gaming\nand that's another thing that I think\npropelled the channel even more so there\nwas like the Minecraft explosion but\nthen I managed to transition into just\ngeneral gaming as well which which\nworked out really well I ended up just\nbeing able to play whatever I wanted\nbasically which was awesome and what are\nyou playing\nnowadays so I recently in the last month\nor so started Minecraft again because I\ntook a long break from that Minecraft 15\nyears is out so they're doing loads of\ncontent around that the new update just\ndropped as well so it was a good time I\nfelt to like come back into Minecraft so\ncool that's what I've been doing and\nI've been taking a lot of time off\nso how's that been it's uh great\nactually yeah really really good I was\nme to take January off I said to myself\nI take January off and that turned into\nFebruary and then oh wow March April May\nso I I started uploading regularly again\nlike about a month ago really okay cool\nhow does that work taking time off cuz I\nmean I hear a lot of people really\nstruggle with taking time\noff yeah it's a bit of a challenge cuz I\nmean I when I started YouTube I was\ndoing two videos a day then went to one\nvideo a day and then when I had my first\nson which was four years\nago I that transition was hard because\nobviously you have like to prioritize\ndifferently my main priority for a good\nlike six years was YouTube that was\nliterally it I'd wake up make videos go\nto sleep rinse and repeat every day how\nmany hours a day would you\nwork like my entire working my waking\ntime I would just work from like maybe\n10:00 a.m.\ntill 5:\nprobably but every day we're talking so\nlike Saturday Sundays yeah yeah yeah and\nthen in the middle of that are doing\nconventions so if I went to a 3-day\nconvention I would have to double the\nvideos as well so I'd make six in\nadvance which means some days I'd be\nmaking three or four a day or just do\nsuper late nights till like 1 2 a.m. I\nedited them all myself I did all my\nthumbnails for a long time\num yeah I don't really know how I did\nthat to be honest when I it's crazy like\nthat's I I I I know the feeling I think\nthat's something that a lot of people\nI've been really feeling that recently\nwhere um so the weird thing is is kind\nof like you mentioned like so I'm I'm\ntaking a a work trip next week for\ncouple like two days 3 days but you know\nthe the uploads have to continue yeah\nand then I'm going to take some time off\nin in July but I have to do all the work\nbefore that time off which is\ninteresting double it up yeah and it was\nit was interesting because in in\nmedicine you know it's actually the\nopposite like I think in in medicine\nwe've done a really good job of like\ncoverage so when you like leave the\nhospital like a different doctor takes\nover and then like they're responsible\nfor everything so you really do get to\nmentally check out it didn't used to be\nlike that but the field I think has\ngotten better in in that way um yeah\nthat's good and is there something in\nparticular that you wanted to talk about\ntoday or anything you're kind of curious\nabout\nor um I'm happy for you to lead I mean\nI've been quite open about mental health\nand stuff that I've dealt with including\nlike why I take breaks and why I take\nlong breaks um which has been very\nbeneficial so I have lots of material\nout there on mental health and I tried\nmy best to deal with it I'd love to hear\nabout that um okay um I guess my biggest\nmental challenge was the transition from\nno kids to one and\nthen having a newborn into pandemic that\nwas a massive challenge that was\nprobably my hardest challenge ever and\ncombining that with like having\nto juggle like the content as well at\nthe same time so you've got pandemic\nnewborn and trying to transition from\nhow am I going to run the\nchannel like do my day-to-day job with\nall these extra responsibilities I guess\nyeah so that was super challenging\nsounds like it what was challenging\nabout\nit I think the the isolation was the\nmost challenging because like when\nyou're a new parent you know nothing\npretty much you can prepare as much as\nyou want but it's it's still super hard\nand then not having the the ability to\nhave your parents around have well\nanyone round basically what you can do\nis zoom calls is extremely difficult you\ncan't even have like professional help\nreally like if you wanted to hire a\nnanny or or anything like that that you\ncouldn't do that during that time that\nwas just not possible yeah so it's nuts\nman yeah it was really challenging and\nand so you know you said you can you can\ntry to prepare did you try to prepare\nfor\nParenthood yeah we did these like um me\nand my wife did these parenting not\nparenting classes it was more like\nfocused on pregnancy birth and then a\nfew weeks after that like over here\nthey're called NCT classes we did those\nwhich prepares you a little bit but then\nthe birth can be completely different\nand then you're throwing all these new\nlike scenarios which are highly\nstressful and as the male in the\nscenario there's not a lot you can\ndo\nso that was like a a massive shock to\nthe system as well\num so I'm so curious about that so a\ncouple things one is you said in this\npart in this part of the world so I\ndon't want to dox you so don't give me\nspecifics but what part of the world are\nyou in oh I'm I'm from England the UK\nand and you said that like the the these\nclasses prepare you for some things like\nwhat like what what is it like I I've\nnever been to one of those classes oh\nokay um so they do\nlike the end of like pregnancy preparing\nfor birth and then what to expect to the\nhospital hospital but then they can't\ncover the there's so many variables when\nyou go to hospital for someone giv birth\nthat just does they don't hit everything\nand if they try to then there's not\nenough detail but there's just so much\nthat could go right so much that could\ngo wrong then just shoved into this you\njust have to experience it and get\nthrough it basically um so they do that\nthen there's like feeding the first few\nweeks after having a newborn but again\nevery child every newborn is is so\ndifferent like you can't you can't cover\neverything and then you you doing things\nwrong like it's yeah yeah they tried to\ncover all that stuff but I think it's an\nimpossible task to be honest what was it\nlike for you to you know have a child\nand then it sounds like you were worried\nI think it's very reasonable I've been\nworried too that you're doing things\nwrong and even med school doesn't\nprepare you\nsufficiently it's crazy for all the per\npatients it's like I've literally\ndevelop uh delivered babies and still\ninsufficient preparation cuz I delivered\nlike three that's mad and then there's\nlike you know people who do this every\nsingle day and will deliver like four a\nday for their whole career and they're\nsufficiently\nprepared yeah so what was it like for\nyou to go to those classes and and what\nwas kind of the process of you know\npresumably it was your wife was the one\nwho gave birth yeah\nMH um I think I was I'm a very like go\nof the flow kind of person so I was like\nyeah I know this stuff now I'm also have\na terrible memory so as soon as I'm in\nlike a stressful situation my mind's\nlike blank it's like wiped everything so\neverything I learned in that class\ndefinitely went out the window that day\nbut um oh my TR up thought I was going\nto say what was the question again I was\njust what was your experience like of\nyou know going through the the birth\nprocess and the period after what's it\nlike to become a\ndad it's great like it really is like\nseeing\nsomeone give birth is just the most\nincredible experience I know a lot of\npeople say that and they say that to you\nbefore you've experienced it yourself\nbut it is an insane experience I can't\neven put it into words unless you do\nexperience it yourself that whole\nprocess\nis crazy\nlike and then you're just left to look\nafter the human it's it's it's actually\nnuts like we were in the hospital a few\ndays he wasn't feeding properly but\nstill after four days they're like okay\nyou can go home now and\nthen you just got to do it I guess W\nresponsibility that sounds scary\nespecially if you know you you were\nthere for a couple days and something\nwasn't going perfectly I can imagine\nthat when you go home you're worried\nlike what if something else doesn't go\nperfectly like what do we do yeah and\nnow we've had two you can kind of like\nwith your second you're like oh yeah\nthis is fine this is fine it's okay yeah\nbut the first one you I think everyone\nis like proper on edge about doing\neverything wrong they're so they seem so\ndelicate and like fragile which they are\nbut then you realize that not everything\nhas to go perfectly well yeah but first\ntime round you're you're worried that it\nneeds to that's interesting so you you\nsaid that the process of watching\nsomeone give birth you said it was like\namazing well okay\nso incredible incredible yeah so tell me\nwhat you mean by that because I was\nwondering if we've actually had pretty\ndifferent experiences what do you mean\nby incredible\nokay so the first time was less\nincredible cuz it was in hospital there\nwas lots of uh like doctor involvement\nit wasn't just like Midwife and just let\nthe process happen uh there was lots of\nthat was a scary time because I can't do\nanything like there's nothing I can do I\njust have to sit watch hope everything\ngoes fine Second Time Around we had home\nbirth and that went literally the\nsmoothest possible so that that was an\nincredible process cuz as well you don't\nyou don't enter like midwives come to\nyou you have two midwives and\nthen the whole process\nhappens and then you just like left at\nhome which is actually really nice\nbecause you you're not in an unfamiliar\nenvironment you just kind of go back to\nyour day today\num more relaxed\nand chilled out I guess about the whole\nthing even though you've now got two\nkids to look after you you you start off\njust on a much better foot so I would\nsay yeah F first birth was less smooth\nbut second was I don't think we could\nask for any better to be honest it was\nit was so incredible to watch yeah so so\nthat's interesting because he use the\nword incredible I remember like my\nexperience of of delivering my first\nbaby um and how absolutely like\nterrifying it was and I remember going\nhome that day and I don't know I guess I\nwas married at that point and telling my\nwife like you should never have\nkids that was just like it I mean just\nhow intense and scary and there's just\nintense is a good word yeah and I was\nlike um I think I had done surgery\nbefore I did OB and so I was like I\nthought I was prepared after doing like\nsurgery for 3 months like okay like I\nknow what the operating room is like I I\nknow you know humans sometimes bleed but\nthe amount of blood and surgery is like\nmilliliters and okay and the amount of\nblood in delivery is like liters\nyeah it's it's just there's just so much\nmore of it and it was like I was\nterrified um I almost passed out one day\nwhich is interesting but anyway um I'll\njust part of the process of getting used\nto it so when you were like oh it's like\namazing I'm\nlike you know I know people describe it\nthat way but it's it's very intense and\nIncredibly scary or it can be incredibly\nscary and it's also interesting cuz our\nour second kid was I I guess in some way\nsimilar to yours we did we did Hospital\ndeliveries for for both of them um but\nit was just like so much easier and then\nwe were kind of like yeah we're time\naround you're just so more relaxed in\ngeneral yeah and I I think also so\ndifferent like like oftentimes you know\nit's interesting I remember when I was\num delivering babies in in in med school\nmy second delivery I was somewhat scared\nbecause I had had such a traumatic\nexperience with the first one I mean\nnothing went wrong but it was just and\nso the the patient that I had I think\nshe was having her fifth or sixth child\nand she was the one that was like\nreassuring\nme and she explained to me she's like\nyou know my body knows what to do now\nand it was over in like 15 minutes it\nwas like you know yeah just like went in\nand then like the labor started she's\nlike yeah the kids's coming and then it\nit's easier the second time around for\nif you're lucky anyway so that's that's\nso interesting and and so sounds like\nthe pandemic was super challenging for\nyall like in what way yeah\nso uh I can't remember how much\ndifferent each country's approach was um\nbut the UK shut down for like 3 weeks at\nleast that was when you just couldn't do\nanything you had to stay inside you\ncould get food but that's that's it and\nbut it seemed to just then get extended\nI think it got extended to like 6 weeks\nand then even further and then even\nfurther it felt like a good 3 months\nthat you just weren't allowed to leave\nyour house and as someone that lives at\nuh works at home as well I didn't even\nhave just we were just in our house for\n3 or 4 months with a newborn trying to\nlearn all this stuff and there's a lot\nof research about like the village\nmentality and support network of having\nchildren like what we used to do years\nand years years years hundreds of years\nago you have a family and\nthen I guess like kind of tribal that's\nthe best way to describe it you have all\nyour relatives around and the the whole\ntribe look after the family that's kind\nof relevant today as well but we didn't\nhave that like no support whatsoever No\nRest bite no no nothing and then I don't\neven know what particular I guess I was\nmore worried\nabout was I doing everything right we\nhad a lot of troubles with feeding Asher\nas well so there was a lot of stress\nwith that going in and out of hospital\nand then I think my mental health just\ntook a a massive decline like by the\nprobably the second month of the\npandemic I was probably my my lowest\nI've ever been to be fair how so\nuh I don't want to be here anymore I was\nI was done yeah that's super\nscary very yeah it got to the point\nwhere we\nhave uh like a charity called Samaritans\nover here which is like uh Crisis Line\nbasically so I looked at that online I'm\nnot someone to call so I never called\nthem but they had this thing where you\ncould it was like a journal app which\nwas quite interesting it was basically\njust like a that they created and I only\never used it once and it was on that day\nI remember it very\nspecifically where I\nhad downloaded the app gone through it\nand I was like trying to almost search\nfor like a Lifeline basically but like\nwhat can turn this around and all it did\nwas prompt you to write how you were\nfeeling on that day and I wrote exactly\nhow I felt and that day looking at it\nwriting out was one thing reading it\nback was another and then that was the\npoint where I was like oh yeah this is\ncrazy we need to change this like right\nnow and then that's when you start the\nprocess of like then talking to my wife\nabout it cuz I was not doing that cuz we\nwere already in a very stressful\nsituation\num trying not to worry her and stuff and\nthen not talking to my family about it\nand then eventually getting to the point\nwhere I go to the\ndoctor\num and a year or so later starting\ntherapy stuff like that so that really\nwas a turning point for me wow I'm so\nhappy to hear that things turned around\nfor you cuz it sounds like things are\ngoing well now um are you comfortable\nwith me asking you like a couple more\nquestions about that experience of yours\nCU yeah sure um would you like context\nfor why I want to\nknow uh can do yeah I'm sure that' be\ninteresting so just as a psychiatrist I\nthink that\nlike um I think the hardest part of this\njourney uh for many people especially\nmen is like is actually before you show\nup in the doctor's office mhm so you\nknow I think once people like show up in\nmy office like in some ways like the\nhardest battle has already been fought\nand\none yeah and I think we have a lot of\nguidance or we have a lot of ideas about\nokay like once you show up in the office\nwhat do we do right so we have things\nlike medications and we have these like\nevidence basy therapies and things like\nthat but like I I think the the biggest\nchallenge is actually like even getting\nthere and there's so many things that\nyou said that I would love to hear more\nabout because I think that there's a\nthere I we know datawise there are a ton\nof men and women and nonb binary persons\nwho are going to be like going through\nexactly what you're going through and\nit's something that we don't hear about\nwe don't talk about and it's even\nsomething that as as medical doctors\nwe're actually blind to if that makes\nkind of makes sense right so we're like\naware of what happens once you step into\nthe office but it's all that stuff that\nbefore that getting there that's\nactually like I think can be incredibly\nhelpful for people to understand so I'd\nlove to ask more about it but if you're\nnot comfortable sharing any piece please\nlet me know okay no no I'm I'm fine with\nit you so the first thing you said is\nthat uh there's this this thing called\nSamaritans and they have a number that\nyou can call and you said I'm not\nsomeone to call or like I'm not someone\nwho calls right can you tell me about\nthat that okay that's more of like a\nanxiety thing like I hate phone calls\nnormally like in which is weird because\nwe're doing that now but like when it's\nin context of my job it's way easier or\nif it's in like a DanTDM context I find\nit way easier but in general I have a\nlot of anxiety like social anxiety so\nit's not something I would especially in\nthat scenario as well that's got to be\nlike I can't even imagine how that phone\ncall would go like I wouldn't know how\nto say it from my mouth but being able\nto write it down is way easier I think\nthat's the approach that's kind of what\nI meant by that okay so when you say I\nhave a lot of so like anxiety what does\nthat mean like what do you\nexperience what makes it hard for you to\ncall I don't I'm an overthinker I think\nso before a call I will like try and\nplan out the whole conversation like\nwhat are they going to say what do I\nreply how do I say this and then I know\nI'm not the best um I'm not the most\neloquent person in the world so I take a\nlot of time to think about what I'm\ngoing to say sometimes I have long\nbreaks in the way I think and I\njust yeah like now like I'll just go\nblank sometimes and not know how to\nfinish the sentence I have lots of\nanxiety over that I'm thinking like what\nare they thinking about me usually if I\nplanned out even something like ringing\nthe Vets or something for my dog I'll\nthink about what I'm going to say and\nthen plan it out when they answer the\nphone I've already forgotten it and then\nI just like stumble I have loads of like\nsocial anxiety over that in person as\nwell I'm not the most I'm not like good\nat small talk stuff like\nthat what's your understanding of why\nyour mind goes\nblank I think that's a it's like a panic\nthing like I've done probably not enough\nbut I've done decent amount of therapy\nwhere that would come up and it's\nlike because I'm trying so hard to think\nof what to say it just like my mind is\njust gone it's like blank like even\nthings like when I take Asher to an\nappointment for example and they ask his\ndate of birth I'm like oh have a a\nmoment of self-doubt and I've just\nforgotten it like obviously I know it\nbut in that moment I can't recite it for\nsome reason it's it's it's weird yeah\nit's that is go ahead I was going to say\nI think that is like a side effect\nof anxious thoughts I guess being\nanxious so so sounds like you've can you\ntell us a little bit about what you've\nlearned in therapy about how to deal\nwith\nthat I mean I should probably do more\nbecause I'm still it's still something\nI'm yeah dealing with everyone can do\nmore I can do more\nbro yeah\num I think it's more I think of these\nscenarios I think of worst case\nscenarios all the time like my thing is\nprepare for the worst and it won't\nhappen which isn't necessarily true\npregnancy is impossible man no\nwonder\nexactly sorry does profanity bother you\nuh\nI no but I don't normally we we'll steer\nclearer that okay okay cool thank you\nlittle bit slip out but hold work better\nno you're good this is your platforms\nyeah I don't want to dictate\num yeah so that's so think that\nparticular statement is what we worked a\nlot on in therapy is if you're always\npreparing for the worst to happen you're\ngoing through maybe like like four\nhundreds of scenarios at the same time\num in your brain and you can't you just\ncan't do that it's impossible which is\nwhy you\nthen the thing you're anxious so the\nthing I'm anxious about is speaking\nbasically so if I'm going over these\nhundreds of scenarios in my head and\nalso trying to form a sentence out my\nmouth I'm actually\ncausing the thing that I'm anxious about\nif that makes sense so it's a lot about\ntrying to rationalize your own thoughts\nand rationalize what maybe like other\npeople are thinking about you as well\nsomething that I find helpful is\nswapping perspectives so what if if I\nwas the other person in whatever\nscenario what would I be thinking and\nthen that\nshould that brings me a lot of clarity I\nthink yeah I I think we know um if I can\njust kind of like offer a couple\nthoughts about that mhm um the first is\nthat we know that people who are anxious\ntend to do something called ruminate\nwhich means they kind of like spin\naround in their own head with their own\nthoughts yeah and um the more that they\ncan step out of their mind so often\ntimes people who are anxious on the one\nhand they think a lot about what other\npeople are thinking but they don't\nactually receive reassuring signals from\nother people so like if someone else is\nlike laughing at your joke that won't\nreassure you because you're kind of\nstuck in your own\nhead yeah and so there's there's even\nit's it's so interesting because what we\nthere's an evidence-based technique\ncalled mentalization based therapy which\nis specifically training people to step\nout of their heads and step into someone\nelse's shoes and it can really help with\nthings like\nrumination um interesting the other\nreally interesting thing that you you\nkind of like are talking about is that\nyou know speaking is a very natural\nthing and so I don't know I mean one\nthing that I did just very little\nbecause I don't practice a whole lot\nanymore but I started doing towards the\nend of my practice is asking people to\ndo um Natural Things intentionally so a\ngreat example of this is like walking so\nif you try to like control each muscle\nwhen you walk you can't walk right it's\nlike okay now let's lift my leg now\nlet's bend my knee now let's bend my\nankle now let's put my foot down now\nlet's straighten my leg and it just just\nbecomes an absolute train wreck and and\nwhat happens with people who are who are\nanxious is they do that for speaking\nright so instead of just speaking you're\nthinking like okay I have to say this\nand then they're going to think this and\nthen they're you're playing through so\nmany scenarios and it does absolutely\nnegatively like it becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy which then\ndamages your confidence and then you\nkind of yeah it's like a vicious cycle\nyeah yeah so I I think it's great that\nyou've you know made some progress and I\nI think it's like you know you can\nalways make more progress dude yeah yeah\nyeah um the other crazy thing that I\nremember learning is that so your your\nCo your stress State I don't know how to\nsay this so I'll tell you a story if\nthat's okay um I was working with\nsomeone who's an orts professional and\nhe used to like party quite a bit and so\nwhen he was like\npracticing what would happen is he would\nbe like hung over the next day and then\nhe would like go to scrim matches and\nthings like that and then like he would\nlike actually like do pretty well and\nthen when the the actual tournament came\naround he would you know his coach and\nstuff would be like you can't party now\nright so it's like it's like the Live\nMatch and there's millions of dollars on\nthe line so he would like stop partying\nand his play actually got\nworse and so it turns out that like he\nactually plays his best when he cuz he's\ntrained he's practiced so much when he's\nlike hung over or maybe even like after\ngoing clubbing for a night he'll like\nshow up in the practice room and like\nplay after not sleeping that's actually\nwhen he plays his best and so there's\nsome really interesting research around\nhow whenever you\npractice the state of mind that you're\nin is the state of mind that you need to\nbe in when you like recall so when\nyou're studying if you are not staying\nup all night and then you pull an all\nnighter before the test your Co like\nyour brain is in a different state and\nit's actually harder to access the\ninformation so you try to duplicate that\nkind of as much as possible and stay\nkind of consistent which is really weird\num but you know it's it anyway so so\ngoing back to this so you were saying\nthat you know you're pretty socially\nanxious you're not someone to call um\nand then you you also said that you\ndidn't know what to\nsay Can can you tell us a little bit\nabout\nthat do you mean like in the context of\nif I did call I know what to say I think\nit's more just like even now I would\nthe way I've\nexplained uh like the scenario that I\nwas in I can't say the specific words of\nwhat I want to say so even now I can't\nsay it I have to say it in like some\nkind of\nuh oh what the word like a cryptic kind\nof way like you all know what I mean but\nI can't say it like I just can't yeah\nwhat's your understanding how does that\nwork what do\nyou I don't know it's just like cuz it's\nadmitting\nI mean it's just admitting that you're\nin that state I don't know what is that\nstate yeah I I don't know C can you hold\non a second I want to show you something\nokay let me just make sure I can find\nit\num so give me just one second okay yeah\nno worries or are you feel like am I\nstressing you out or making you feel\nnervous or anything by no no no this is\nthis is all good um what I'm going to do\nis screen share with you and then I'm\ngoing to change this is going to like\ntake me a second okay so what I'm going\nto do is we're going to\ndo uh how did I figure this out I\nthink do we\nhave\nthis so I'm going to SC share with you\nI'd like to show you\num a scientific paper if that's okay\nokay okay so can you see my window yeah\nyeah I can see it\num it's it's hilarious I was like\nliterally reading this stuff today oh\nreally um so what is the impact of men\nnot this one Boys Don't Cry not this one\nwhy didn't you just ask yeah\nright underestimating the discomfort of\nhelp\nseeking this is the one okay so\nmeasurement of\nno did I miss this no this is hold\non here we go role of masculinity and\nhelp seeking so let me find\nthis\num here we go difficulty\ncommunicating I'm going to just show you\na quote okay here we go\ndifficulty communicating so the notion\nthat men are socially conditioned not to\nengage in emotion-based communication\nand consequently experience difficulty\nemploying such language was a recurring\ntheme in\n82% oh wow of qualitative studies um it\nwas suggested that help seeking is often\nhindered by limited emotional vocabulary\nin men which is maladaptive and\ntherapeutic contexts so like this is\ncrazy right so uh participants\npurportedly contradicted the influence\nof male ideals with with participants\nnot identifying is depressed and instead\nusing terms like stressed or overwhelmed\nso this is just like super wild but I\nwas thinking about um you know just what\nyou were saying about like I wouldn't\nknow what to say and it's crazy but like\n82% of studies that look at men and why\nthey don't ask for help\nsuggests that like literally we do not\nknow the words to use yeah 82% is so\nhigh it's it's that's 82% of studies so\nthe number of subjects that they were\nlooking at was like you know hundreds or\nthousands you know but it's like such a\ncommon experience that we just don't\nlike we literally do not know what to\nsay like I don't know like if if someone\nand and you know it's not\nlike and and and I think it's it's so\ninteresting I I really wonder about the\nfact that Samaritans had an option for\nyou to\nwrite yeah what kind of it wasn't even\nit was interesting sorry to interrupt\nbut what was interesting about that is\nit wasn't it wasn't even writing to\nsomeone it was just a journal it was\nliterally something I could have just\ndone by grabbing a book but and just\nwriting in it but I didn't it was yeah\nit was a really interesting way of like\nself-reflecting on your thoughts yeah\nand and are you okay sharing a little\nbit of what you wrote that day uh like I\nsaid I just I just can't say it out loud\nI don't know why I know what I wrote and\nI alluded to it earlier but I can't say\nI just gone okay that's okay yeah right\nso so like let me ask you this if if\nyou're okay with and let me know I'm not\ngoing to ask you again what you wrote\nbut sure which part of you can't say\nit\num does that question make\nsense not so is it that you can't come\nup with the words or there's something\ninside you that's keeping you from\nsharing oh no no I know the words it's\njust something it just can't I just\ncan't say out loud yeah it's weird right\nyeah and so that that's so like yeah I\nmean that's very common um I can screen\nshare another piece that that relates to\nso one is not knowing the words and then\nthe second let's do it are you okay with\nthat yeah yeah sure can can we can we\ntake a look at um so let me do this\nsame paper this is a great paper by the\nway\num we don't have to these are all the\nstudies that they looked\nat ah let me see if I can maybe a\ndifferent\npaper\num yeah\nokay so\num so finally those men that had sought\nhelp described experiences of limited\ndisclosure minimizing the severity of\nsymptoms and the magnitude of need in\norder to maintain a masculine status so\nlike this is let me see if there's more\nabout limited disclosure there's a\ndifferent paper that goes into it more\nokay I can't I don't know which paper it\nis but so there's another big theme here\nwhich is that um men especially are like\noh I I guess I didn't screen share with\nother people but or they didn't see that\nbut um so men especially are like the\nbiggest thing is that we want to limit\nour\ndisclosure so like even if we do tell\nand maybe this resonates with you maybe\nit doesn't but even if we do say\nsomething or we ask for help we don't\nask for everything that we need we ask\nfor this tinyest slice of what we need\nright what I I actually like I I want a\nmeal but instead I'll be like yeah I'll\ntake can I can I have two bites or I\nneed I'm a little bit hungry can I have\na tiny little whatever yeah yeah and and\nand so that there's something really\npowerful right so and I I think we're\nkind of seeing it here um which is that\nlike even though you know what to say\nyou know I think cognitively on some\nlevel you're comfortable with this\nconversation like we talked you know\nbefore and stuff about what your\nboundaries are and all that good stuff\nand so even though there's\nlike and and this is that part of the\nconversation where we're going to steer\nclear of it right so there's a part of\nyou that still like you just can't say\nit it's like crazy like yeah I it's I\nthink it's you I can't say in an\nexplicit sense but I said like I said\nearlier I didn't want to be here anymore\nthat is saying it but not directly like\nthat's not how I felt in that moment as\nexplicitly as I would would have said it\nin that moment and I think every person\nwho's watching knows exactly what you\nmean yeah right but I can't say that\nI've only said those words to one person\nand that would be my therapist yeah\nright so it's crazy like not even your\nwife Not In That explicit\nyeah sentence no are you comfortable so\nnow so now is the point in the\nconversation where I think we should\nlike re-evaluate our boundaries about\nwhat's okay to talk about what's not\nokay to talk about so you got to let me\nknow okay because earlier we said\nnothing but now I think there's\nsomething and we have to respect that is\nthat fair okay right yeah yeah fair so\num are you comfortable exploring a\nlittle bit about what why it's hard to\neven tell your wife or maybe that's the\nhardest person to talk\nto uh I think part of it was maybe the\ntime like we just had a baby she just\nbeen through this pretty traumatic birth\nand she was new parent I was a new\nparent and it was it seemed almost\nburdensome almost yeah burdensome or\nselfish even to be like I really need to\nI need I need help now yeah yeah that\nwas why I'm like I'm someone who doesn't\nlike to\nbother other people like another recent\nexample is I I had to have my appendix\nat recently and it took me a lot to ring\nan ambulance when I was when it was\nflaring up like it's that it's that same\nkind of mentality I'm\nlike there's people that are worse than\nme kind of thing like people that have a\nway worse scenario way worse life than\nme so why why do I feel this way surely\nI can just get out of it myself kind of\nkind of mentality and I don't want I\ndon't want to bother people I don't want\nto seem extreme maybe it's not that or\nanything like it's that same kind of\nmentality like oh is it can I get over\nthis pain or do I do I really need help\ndo you really need help right is there\nany way is there like H like maybe I can\nget through it yeah exactly and so what\nI'm curious about like you mentioned\nearlier that you know sometimes you'll\nstep outside of your your head and into\nsomeone else's shoes and if we were to\ndo that for a moment and someone else\nneeds their appendix out you know and\nI'm guessing that you had right lower\nquadrant pain that was\nexcruciating yeah yeah on the floor\ncan't move cramped curled into a ball\nhorrific yeah what would you say to that\nperson bringing\nambulance so what's different what's\ndifferent about you right why do you get\nsuch special treatment what do you think\nwhy are you less deserving of help than\nother\npeople I have no idea like that is\nthat's it isn't it I guess you want you\nwant less deserving well I mean\nsomewhere you learn that right do you\nhave a sense of like how long you've\nstrived for Independence and being kind\nof like not needing help from somebody\nelse I I guess I'm just someone who\ntries to do everything myself like in in\nanything I mean even if you chalk it\ndown to YouTube like I did YouTube\nmyself\nfor I don't think I got an editor until\nI hit like 15 million or something like\nthat sub mentioned you were doing your\nown thumbnails and everything thumbnails\nedits literally everything like I just\nI'm just not someone who who asks for\nhelp that often I guess that spills out\ninto other things that are probably more\nimportant to ask for helpful yeah and\nand and but do you have a sense of how\nlong so it sounds like this was before\nbefore so this was already there when\nyou started\nYouTube right yeah so do you\nremember how long like like when you\nwere a kid was it okay not okay to ask\nfor\nhelp uh I probably didn't no I don't I\ndon't even know the reason why like I\nwouldn't ask for help it's just\nsomething that I've always been like I\ncan do this like I'm I'm someone who\nwould be\nlike I'm trying to think of an example I\ncould watch someone do something like a\ncrazy drum solo I don't play drums but I\ncould be like I could do that eventually\nI could do that so I think about that in\nlike every sense or if\nlike I had the ambition to make a game\nmy first thought would be I will learn\nhow to do it myself rather than let's\nhire people who already know how to do\nit to and make a game together I'm\nsomeone who would just be like I'll just\nlearn it myself and try I'll fail but\nyeah it sounds on the one hand so\nrespectable right yeah yeah on the one\nhand it's actually I don't think that's\na healthy mindset\nbut on one hand it's actually benefited\nmy career basically yeah and on the\nother hand it sounds really\nisolating yeah yeah true and what else\nwould you say is unhealthy about it\nthat uh yeah the isolating is a big\nthing CU you don't even have like a team\nto talk to I mean I do now like I have\nmanagement\nand my close team took you a while it\ntook me a while yeah 15 million it's\nlike oh maybe I should hire someone at\nthis point I mean do you know what even\nnow I don't have fulltime editors\nbecause I dip in and out of making\nvideos like I\ncan't I I don't want the responsibility\nof hiring someone and then be like yeah\nI'm not making videos for like 5 months\nby the way um yeah so even then I don't\nhave like a in terms of video creation I\ndon't\nhave a permanent team I have editors\nthat I can trust and hire as I go as\nI coming and out of breaks\nbut yeah I don't know I just always felt\nlike I can do\nthis what's it like to not be able to do\nit\num I don't I don't think that that often\nwhich is probably why it was so hard to\nask in terms of like my mental health so\nI i' still always convinced that I can\nlike even now I I if we take the\ncreating a game example which is very\ndifferent but I think leads along the\nsimilar mindset I still believe now that\nI could learn and eventually create a\ngame I reckon I could do that but I\nreckon you could\neventually but there's only so much time\nin the day like you just can't you can't\ndo everything but then when it comes to\nsomething as serious as like a mental or\nphysical health then you can't necessar\nyou need become a point where you have\nto admit that you can't how did you get\nthere\nuh I with the mental stuff it was that\nmoment of reading back probably taking\nmyself out of my own brain and reading\nit from like a third person perspective\nbeing like Oh if I read that from\nsomeone else it was literally in that\nmoment it almost felt like I did leave\nmy body and read it as if someone else\nhad written it and be like\noh yeah you should you need help you\ndefinitely need help CU if anyone else\nshowed me that that's the response I\nwould give okay what was your so did it\nalmost sounds like a touch dissociative\nlike you kind of stepped out of yourself\nfor a second yeah and what would be the\nresponse that you would give to someone\nelse\nthat I'd like to feel like I'm a good\nlistener so it be something that I like\nwell what is making you feel this way\nand then realize it is as serious as it\nwas and then you have to reach out for\nprofessional help that's that's how you\nget there I was also a\nbit naive when it came to like therapy\nand stuff like i' never used therapy\nbefore never experienced it never really\ntalked about it and I was very skeptical\nof therapy I was like well how can they\nhelp you they they don't know you but\nactually that's that's the positive so\nAfter experiencing therapy I felt a bit\nsilly that I'd been so negative in my\nown mind about how therapy can benefit\nsomeone yeah so you said that they don't\nknow you right so I think that's a very\ncommon concern\nby the way how are we doing is this\nconversation okay yeah this is good fine\num and we'll both keep track of if it's\nnot okay okay yeah yeah um so\nso what is the advantage of someone not\nknowing you I think it's a\nbeautiful uh yeah the advantage is\nthat's\neloquent yeah the advantage is just\nfresh perspective they literally don't\nknow you they don't know anyone this is\nyou telling them all the information\nfresh they don't know any of your family\nanyone in the situations you're talking\nabout then it's private huh it's yeah\nit's 100% it has to be private and\nespecially in like a job like mine I've\nbeen very protective over my privacy too\nlike I feel like I don't have any\nsometimes so coming down to a situation\nwhere it literally has to be private\nthen\nthat's the only place I felt kind of\nlike safe to fully open up I guess and\nand do you like so I mean I I I think\nI'm going to ask you a question that we\nall know the answer to but so I imagine\nthat it's easier to talk to a therapist\nthan it is to talk to let's say like the\nperson you're closest to like your wife\nfor example what what makes it hard to\ntalk to people that are close to\nyou I think it's because there could be\nconsequence to it if you tell\nsomeone I don't like if you don't want\nto be here anymore then they could\nthere's part of my brain that's like oh\nwould they find that offensive like am I\nnot worth being here for kind of thing\nso it's that small element of risk puts\nme off of doing it completely whereas in\na a therapist situation there there\nisn't that risk yeah and and so I was a\nbit confused what is the risk that\nyou're worried about so you're anxious\nbrain\ncatastrophizes right that someone would\nalmost be\noffended that yeah you're that I want to\ngo and help me understand that how how\ncould someone be offended if you were\nsuffering so\nmuch and I know I'm my worst case yeah\nmy worst case scenario brain would be\nlike oh if I don't want to be here\nanymore then like they're\nnot worth enough for me to stay does\nthat make sense yeah I that would be\nlike what my brain would think they\ncould think if there's a small\npercentage chance that they could think\nthat then yeah I'm not going to say if\nyou loved me more you'd want to\nlive kind of yeah kind of yeah it's\nlike no profanity it's scary like am I\nyeah am I not good enough to be here\nyeah it's it's I think it it\nsounds on the one hand crazy and and I\nuse that word\ncarefully and on the other hand like it\nkind of makes perfect sense right that\nmind that you're kind of wrapped in a\ncertain way of\nthinking and and I think you did a\nbeautiful job of sort of saying when my\nbrain is you said something like when my\nbrain is in its worst state mhm help me\nbecause that help us understand that is\nyour brain not always the\nsame I don't think so I feel like I go\nthrough like waves of mentally stable\nand then feeling less\nstable uh\nI the way I explained it before doing\ntherapy is like imagine you're on a road\nand it splits off\ninto 20 different directions and you've\ngot to choose the right\none but the fog is very thick so you\ncan't actually decide the correct one\nyou're just kind of picking one and\nhoping whereas as I continued the\ntherapy process that fog would slowly\nlift so you can you can see the the\nnatural like the way you should\ngo that's how I imagine it visually yeah\nso so um I I think that's beautiful by\nthe way you're very\neloquent thank\nyou you know I I I think maybe not in\na precise engineering sense but it's\nvery like Artful like I I can almost\nlike get the storytelling Vibe as\nopposed to like the precise Vibe if that\nkind of makes sense yeah I appreciate\nthat cuz I I'm a very visual person like\nas I explain something I'm explaining in\nan image in my head like I can see the\nroads and stuff so that's why I explain\nit that way I guess so here here's what\nI got from that and and you let me know\nif this feels right to you or not but\nlike you know it's not even that I mean\neach of those roads is kind of like a\nvalid Road right so like even the less\nhealthy ways of thinking are like a way\nto go down a path yeah that's I tried to\navoid saying that when I was explaining\nit cuz I know my therapist would be like\nthere is no there's no wrong yeah right\nso so it's interesting it it feels valid\nand you're you know you don't know which\nway like and so it's kind of weird but\nlike even some of the thoughts that we\nwould think are negative can actually\nlead us in the right\ndirection so even being able to like\narticulate and put into this journaling\napp or whatever and being able to read\nit like even like and if you look at\nthat road at the very beginning it looks\nreally dark right because it's kind of\nengaging with your negative thoughts and\nso there's a part of us that maybe\nthinks like oh you know we shouldn't go\ndown that road but it turns out that\nsometimes like those roads and you don't\nsee that that's the road that you need\nto go down until the fog lifts yeah\nthat's true yeah you're right and and\nand so on the flip side there are some\nroads that look really tempting when\nthere's a bunch of fog and so you know\nlike oh like I don't want to be selfish\nlike come on Dan you don't want to be\nselfish your wife just had a difficult\nbirth there's a newborn no one's\nsleeping you know like you like like a a\nbaby and there's your wife and she just\nlike had this kid like you don't want to\nbe selfish like you're not here to be\nselfish you're here to be the\nopposite yeah exactly and you're going\nthrough all this stuff but like it's not\nlike you just gave\nbirth that's too yeah and so it's almost\nlike you don't deserve\nto it it it doesn't make sense that you\ndon't need that you should need this\nmuch help and if you need this much you\ndon't deserve to feel that way basically\nyeah right you shouldn't feel that way\nshouldn't yeah yeah mhm and and so that\nthat makes a lot of sense like I mean I\nthink if we ask you know a 100 people\nlike who do you think deserves more\nhelp when someone just has a baby the\nhusband or the wife like I think a lot\nof people will say like clearly and\nhusbands and wives will all agree that\nyou know the wife needs more help it's\nvery reasonable and yet somehow that\nroad looks reasonable for the first\ncouple steps but because of the fog can\nactually be a little bit you know not\nright yeah and I I thought it was a\nbeautiful analogy I think it really\ncaptures a lot of that experience of of\nand you know does it what does what I\nsay make sense to you I mean you know\nthat's what I heard in that yeah yeah\nEnvision it yeah I I thought it was it\nwas beautiful dude um thank\nyou yeah so so it it sounds like you did\nget help MH and and what was that help\nand what what actually what did your\nwife understand about like what was\ngoing on because you must have\ncommunicated something to\nher yeah I\nmean not fully but she knows there's\nsomething wrong like it's hard you can't\nreally hide that you can do your best\nbut your whole you can do your best\nright you did your best yeah but it's\nstill very obvious like she would say my\naura was just bad like there was just a\na dark Cloud over my head the whole time\nwow that\nperceptive yeah exactly and then I think\nIAL I can't even remember the exact\nmoment I think there was a time where I\nexplained it but\nnot it was like skirting around the\nsubject basically I I tried to tell her\nbut dampen in it a little bit like this\nis not as Extreme as it sounds but I do\nneed a bit of help basically so she\nfound me a wasn't a therapist it\nwas a it was someone you could go to to\ntalk to basically but they wouldn't\nnecessarily offer any techniques or\nadvice it was someone just sound your\nthoughts to basically and then that was\nbe that was actually\nbefore kind remember what that was but\nit went to like from iners to phone\ncalls and then to phone calls I found\nvery different and inefficient okay\ninteresting but before we get into that\nI'm a little bit curious about what she\nunderstood so it's sounds like you kind\nof like any good classical research\noriented man you limited your disclosure\nright and you downplayed things but what\ndid what's your sense of what she\nheard um I guess I've never\nreally never really asked\nbut I think maybe H was from more of a I\nmean I don't want to speak on her behalf\nbut it was more of of a perspective of\nlike if this carries on we just can't\nwe can't work this out like we can't\nlive like this\nit's with me being in the state that I\nwas are it was damaging the relationship\nI guess to the point where she's just\nlike this isn't a relationship at the\nmoment like you're you're that dark\ncloud all the time every\nday yeah that sounds\nBleak yeah right right so like I I don't\nknow if you hear it but but I hear a lot\nof residual self\njudgment like this is not a relationship\nlike whoa that's like heavy right yeah\nit was to the point where I was like\nthat every day but yeah so so I you know\ni' I'd be I'd be honestly a little bit\nsurprised if she saw it that that\nseverely like I'm not disputing you know\nI mean you know I've never met the woman\nand I've known you for a solid 30\nminutes at this point but you know but\nlike like I I I just want to kind of\ncall attention to like you know\nhow I mean you know we're talking about\nher perception but I think that's your\nperception of you yeah I think you're\nright yeah yeah maybe is right it's\ninteresting like like because I I don't\nthink that she was like we don't have a\nrelationship right now like whoa bro\nyeah yeah you're right I mean you're\nyou're too nice and good of a guy and\ncaring and and I'm sure you were you\nknow changing diapers and\nwhatnot yeah plenty of those so so I I\nthink that's those are that that's the\nthat's the Dark Cloud talking mhm um but\nanyway so it sounds like but she she\nunderstood that something you know\nneeded to be done and it sounds like she\nwas\nsupportive yeah yeah she initially found\nme the help and told me where to go\nbasically she's I can't remember the\nexact word but yeah not a therapist it\nwas I can't remember the other word but\num someone I could go to that was at\nlike a hospital environment they want a\ndoctor you could just a peer support\nspecialist\nyeah something like that I can't\nremember the exact word but something\nsomething like that yeah\num and then that was\nokay good to actually learn how to say\ncertain stuff out loud I guess which I'd\nnever done before then it moved from\nface to face the phone call again to do\nwith pandemic stuff and I found that\njust way less um like it wasn't even\nFaceTime it was just purely voice find\nthat way less effective cuz you\ncan't I don't know it's I guess is the\ndifference between doing like a work\nmeeting over Zoom than face to face it's\njust not as\nconstructive so I stopped that for a bit\nthen it started get worse again and then\nI actually went to like a GP to to get\nhelp so I was like that I don't know\nwhat else to do so I'll go to a GP\nsounded that out and what did you say to\nthe\nGP\nI and if you can't say that that's fine\ntoo it's just like no no no I don't even\nknow if I said that\ndirectly I can't remember the\nconversation so so you know why I'm\nasking what your words were Dan like I\nhave a very specific reason because like\nI think there's a lot of people who are\nlistening who do not know like literally\nthey don't know the words sure and if we\ncan get and I don't even know the words\nright because I'm on the other side of\nthe table yeah where and because I'm a\npsychiatrist I'm not a\nGP so what happens is like GPS send me\npatient and then we know what you're\nhere for right show like we know what's\ngoing so I I think it's it's crazy cuz\nwhen you know I was reading this\nresearch about like like especially men\nbut this by the way this gender gap is\nshrinking it's scary MH um but like\nliterally people do not know what to\nsay yeah um yeah I think when I went in\nthere I think I even said the word Like\nMy Chosen phrase is I didn't I don't\nwant to be here anymore that that's my\nphrase and I probably cried as well cuz\nI was just very teor at that point point\nand they're like oh yeah that's I think\nthat's the main few like points they try\nand find out is are you at risk and te\nall the time like there's certain boxes\nyou have to tick basically and looking\nback I don't know if it was the right\napproach but I basically went straight\nonto anti-depressants for okay N9 or 10\nmonths and what makes you think that\nthat may have not been the right\napproach because now that I have done\ntherapy I would much rather have done it\nthe other way around\nand anti-depressants are they good but\nthere's also like side effects that come\nwith it it's quite a quite an\nundertaking I think and I'm someone who\nwould rather not put something in my\nbody to fix something I'd rather try\nanything but basically so in hindsight I\nwould rather have tried the other way\naround but at that time it helped so I\ncan't complain I think I I know this may\nsound weird as a psych but I too am not\na huge fan of\nanti-depressants yeah and at the same\ntime I think they can be incredibly\nhelpful especially kind of early on but\nlike I don't think they're a permanent\nsolution for many people I think so\num but kind of going back to so what\nwhat would you say was the difference\nbetween like anti-depressants and and\ngoing to\ntherapy in my experience I'm sure other\npeople feel I mean it's so individual\nlike for some people long-term\nanti-depressants will work yep some\nwon't but personally yeah for me\npersonally it felt more of like a just\nputting a plaster over something like\nnot\nactually yeah that's the best way I can\ndescribe it putting a plaster over\nsomething and then when you stop taking\nthe anti-depressants you for me I it was\nover 10 months so I had come out of like\nthat newborn fog anyway we were allowed\nto go out now because the pandemic was\nnot over but you're allowed to do stuff\nso\nI wouldn't have said all those thoughts\nwere dealt with but life had got better\nsince so it was easier when I came off\nthe anti-depressants to just kind of\ncarry on got it so so what I'm sort of\nhearing and I think a plaster is a is a\ngood way to kind of describe it so so\nthere's you know some people who some\npsychiatrists who really believe that\nthe primary function of anti-depressants\nis emotional\nnumbing yeah that yeah and you know\nthat's really what they do I I've seen\nvarying you know I don't think it's one\nor the other I think there's highly\nindividual\nresponses um but what I'm also hearing\nis when you stopped the anti-depressants\nthe actual like objective stress level\nand your circumstances were somewhat\nbetter so even though nothing was fixed\nkind of your support system was maybe a\nlittle bit more robust MH or just you\ncould leave the house which sounds like\nis an important part of yeah yeah you've\ngot a little controller or whatever yall\ncall him in in the UK but um what what\nwould you all call is it the thing that\nyou pram we call it a Prem pram right so\nyou've got a pram and you're pushing the\npram down in the park or whatever\nexactly and um and then what was can you\ntell us a little bit once again if you\ndon't want to totally fine just like\nwhat was your experience of therapy and\nhow it helped\nyou yeah I tried therapy maybe like a\nyear or so after I came off\nanti-depressants and what prompt I\num we had another\nbaby okay so we had another baby much\nbetter experience but there was again\njust more of\na more stress I guess more stress more\nworries and then\nbecause this might not be the case but\nthe way I feel is like the\nanti-depressants\nkept it hadn't dealt with kind of like\nsay 80% of my brain space so then when\nyou add something like a stressful life\nevent and add that 20% you're at 100 so\nright you're back where you were before\nit was nowhere near as bad but I I\nnoticed kind of like the warning signs I\nwas like okay I need some help here and\nthen actually again my wife found me a\ntherapist basically found\nMEAP just kind of\nlike one of my main things\nwas sleeping like I would just the only\nthing I'd want to do is sleep because my\nbrain's turned off so I can sleep if I'm\nnot if I'm not awake I'm not thinking so\nI'd rather be asleep so as soon as like\nkids were in bed or anything I wouldn't\nwork or make videos I would or do\nanything any of my hobbies I would just\nsleep because it's a way of not being\nhere the brain was off like a standby\nbutton yeah yeah\nexactly um and and did did she notice\nthat something was off and did she kind\nof prompt that conversation or did you\nsignal to her in some way that you\nneeded help a bit of both I think like\nwhen I said I needed help she's like yes\nokay obviously\nyeah so um that was that yeah I think as\nwell just like again the aura changed\naround me like I'm a very easygoing guy\nnormally like I'm very I feel like I'm\nvery down to earth just easy going easy\nto get along with so when the when I'm\nnot that it's quite obvious like I\nwouldn't\nentertain much conversation I wasn't\ndoing the stuff that I love like if I'm\nnot doing like YouTube for example\nthat's something that I've loved so long\nthen there's something not quite right\nwith my balance I wasn't doing\nanything fun because I just didn't want\nto so she noticed that we know each\nother so well we've known each other for\nso long that she noticed that\nand helped me take that step that I\nwouldn't have taken mhm because I know\nwhy I just yeah was about from the the\nthings we were talking about earlier\nyeah it's a big task a big step to take\nso she helped me take that step and then\nyou would have wanted to figure it out\non your\nown yeah pretty much yeah how how did it\nfeel to take that\nstep it felt I was super nervous like\nagain I was still quite skeptical to\ntherapy but I was like you know what I\ndon't I don't want to go on\nanti-depressants again because of\ncertain side effects so I was like you\nknow what let's just try this let's\nlet's try it's not as bad as before but\nlet's try it then as I started therapy\nthere was actually way more below the\nsurface that I needed to untangle and\ndeal with to be able to bring just like\nmy base thinking level like my base\nthinking rate just down like I always\nfelt like my brain was running at 100%\nall the time so if there's if there's\nanother stressful event then you're\nabove you're at capacity already whereas\ntherapy allowed me\nto decode all the stuff even from like\nchildhood and onwards to then set my my\nbrain at a much lower level so I can\ndeal with the more stressful stuff much\neasier and in a much more logical way\nonce again just be beautifully eloquent\nman so so like there's a lot of stuff\nhere that I I love which I'm going to\ntoss back at you so the first is I I I\nlove the way that you describe it as\nlike not even like I mean you said you\nknow some stuff from your childhood but\nI I think often times we kind of think\nabout like therapy actually in a very\nlike feminine way which is like you know\ntrauma and\nfeelings and and then but I I think it's\nit's actually really cool how you kind\nof talk about just the this pace of your\nmind like you talked about slowing down\nyour Baseline\nactivity and then what happens is you\nbuild Reserve like that's what I'm\nhearing is that you're so close to like\nthe edge of the cliff right that just a\nlittle push like kind of pushes you\nreally close to the edge and then you're\nkind of hanging on and then you're kind\nof falling off and that that you're\nyou're always close to the edge like\nyou're always like kind of at maximum\nstress MH you know I mean I think about\nthis is almost like there's a difference\nbetween like walking and then you can\nrun like you can increase how fast you\nmove if there is a period of stress but\nif you're kind of huffing and puffing\nand then like a bear shows up and you're\ngetting Chase like you got you can't run\nany faster like you're already at your\nlimit that's exactly it yeah\nand and I I think it's cool how you sort\nof describe like therapy is is not I\nmean I'm sure there's talking about\nfeelings and you mentioned there was\nlike you know some stuff like in there\nbut really the way that you view that is\nthat it sounds like you were kind of\nsitting with a lot and really using up a\nlot of your Reserve at\nBaseline yeah and sometimes even stuff\nyou don't even realize like just stuff\nthat has happened to you before and then\nit's taking\nup it changes the way you think and deal\nwith stuff which is then increasing your\nmental load whereas if you unpacked it\nproperly and then changed the way you\nthink about certain situations your\nmental load is or you're then working\ngetting your brain to work at that lower\nBaseline yeah so I think this is too\ngood of an opportunity to pass up so I\nhave to ask can you give us an example\nlike and if you don't if it's not\ncomfortable that's totally fine but like\nI I love the way you're mapping out this\nprinciple and okay I want people who are\nlistening to if you're comfortable with\nit have the opportunity to like see what\nyou practically mean right cuz I I I\nlove it so much as a therapist I love\nthe way you're describing it right okay\nyeah I can think of one example the main\nexample in my life is when my parents\ndivorced so that is pretty much me and\nmy theist work together and they're like\nthis is where this prepare for the worst\nand it won't happen kind of thing that's\nwhere that stems from because as a kid I\nwas very the illusion that my family\nlife was fine like everything was okay\nand then all of a sudden bam like\nthey're splitting up and then we had to\nmove to a different place and then\nwouldn't see my dad every day and then\nsee him like every other weekends like\nthat was a\nhuge felt catastrophic at the time and\nthen that is just and I didn't realize\nit until I went to therapy that how how\ncatastrophic that was for my mindset\nmoving forwards like that's a huge\nreason as to why I think or prepare for\nthe worst at any moment because that\nseemed to come out of nowhere obviously\nit didn't and they were just they were\ndealing with it my parents were dealing\nwith it by themselves and not like\nbothering me of that information then\nwhen it all came out at once that just\nlike completely uprooted my world so so\nwhat was what you said it was\ncatastrophic for your thinking how\nso I think because before that point I\nwas very\nI didn't think about that stuff and then\nyou realize after all this time like\nit's been maybe like a year or so of\nthem really maybe even longer I don't\neven know but what you thought was okay\nthe whole time actually wasn't that in\nmy mind was like oh so what else am I\nmissing that seems okay but actually\nisn't yeah and then as you then grow as\na person adult it just it's a recurring\ncycle you just don't get out of that\ncycle way of thinking yeah so so if I'm\nif I'm hearing you right and you know\nI've seen this a lot it's kind of like\nyou know if you assume that something is\nstable and your mind is like we don't\nhave to worry about that and then you\nwake up one day and it's like oh crap we\nwere wrong this thing that we thought we\ncould be calm about we can't be calm\nabout yeah and then that creates a yeah\ngo ahead I was going to saying it wasn't\nsomething it wasn't something smaller\nlike my car broke or something it was\nlike parents completely separate and we\nhave to move to completely different\nlocations and the whole way your life\nworks at that time everything is going\nto change literally everything so it's\nwas\njust that kind of mindset compared um\ncombined with the severity of the impact\non my life just yeah yeah so so I'm\nhearing that you were blindsided by\nquite the\nuprooting M yeah and then if you really\nthink about it right so if it's like\nit's like waking up one day and and\nrealizing oh gravity is flipped upside\ndown it just completely messes up your\nlife and then the other really\ninteresting thing I mean I think we see\nthis this is you know common is that you\nget trained for anxiety because now you\ncan't rely on reassuring signals because\nwhat if you're wrong yeah right like we\ndon't want this to have like this we got\ncaught off guard once it completely\nuprooted our life we cannot not get\ncaught with our pants down again mhm\nexact so you're constantly\nquestioning even when things are okay\nyou can't leave it alone yeah it's like\nyour there's a song I I used to listen\nto where it's like I'm terrified it's\ngoing good and that's always stuck with\nme because you're like oh you know what\nlife's pretty good right now when does\nit go wrong yeah\nno so well said man cuz like that's\ncrazy I mean one of the things that I\nsee a lot with people that I work with\nis like you know things that are going\nwell become sources of\nfear and when things going well become\nsources of fear There's No Escape for\nfear bad things are scary and good\nthings are scary which means that you're\nconstantly scared yeah and then you have\nit comes back to that when bad stuff\ndoes happen which is going to happen at\nsome point you you don't have the space\nto deal with it like you're you're\nalready operating it completely\neverything's bad mindset so yeah if you\nif you haven't enjoyed the good time\nyou're not going to be able to deal with\nwhatever bad stuff happens so well said\nright because you're you're stressing\nout about everything going well you've\ngot no you've got no bandwidth left at\nyour limit yeah um I think just one\nother thing that I thought was\ninteresting so it sounds like your\nparents didn't burden you with what was\ngoing on in there yeah so maybe that's\nwhere you as soon as I said that I I\ngot this is a guy who's been to therapy\nit's like yeah you you got it too right\nyeah those are actually some of my\nfavorite moments in therapy CU as you're\nsaying it it comes out your mouth you\nfigure it out before they've even\nresponded I used to love that cuz that I\nthink that shows you're making progress\nbut also you're\nlike you already knew it almost\nsometimes like the information was there\nyou could connect the dots you just you\njust need someone to guide you at the\nsame time well I I I think that that you\nknow I would modify that a bit I I think\nyou're right that the information is\nthere but you couldn't connect the dots\nso I I think I think you're a very good\nexample of how putting things outside of\nyour mind either through written stuff\nlike journaling or whatever prompt you\nfilled out or even saying it out loud so\nit's really interesting how this works\nin our brain but you know when we speak\nit engages our auditory cortex so when\nwe speak this actually becomes an input\nthat our mind reflects on I don't know\nif that kind of makes sense but like\nliterally like there's this part of our\nbrain called the thalamus and the\nthalamus is what brings in stuff from\nthe\noutside and when we bring in stuff from\nthe outside we evaluate it with certain\nCirc there's certain like evaluation\ncircuits that apply to sensory\nstimuli those same evaluation circuits\ndo not activate when we're\nthinking because it's not we're not a\nit's like our own thoughts so like it\ndoesn't go it's like literally like a\ndifferent input in our brain and and so\nwhen we say something out loud like you\nconnected the dots right like I\nconnected the dots I'm sure you know\npeople who are familiar with this who\nwere listening also connected the dots\nbut that's really what it lets you do is\nit lets you connect the dots in a way\nthat it's very hard to understand you\njust can't do that in your mind in the\nsame way yeah and it's literally because\nthe brain circuits for thinking and\nreceiving information from the outside\nare different and when we receive\ninformation from the outside our brain\nprocesses it in a different way so yeah\ncool\num yeah so so it sounds like you know\nyou made a lot of\nprogress um you know it sounds like\nyou've gotten better at understanding\nyourself you really like worked on some\nof that stuff so you've got a lot more\nbandwidth um yeah and and you said\nsomething like\nuh you know now you really understand\nthe importance of breaks it sounds like\nyou took an extended break like how did\nyou get to where you are now with\nthat uh I was trying to think earlier\nwhen you asked me about introducing\nbreaks where I took my first like jump\nwhere I was like oh I'm just going to\nnot make anything cuz I've never done\nthat uh I can't remember when it was it\nmust have\nbeen I can't remember when the first\nextended break was but that was probably\nonly like maybe a month or so and then\nbut I've never taken one this long\nbefore like from what was like January\nto May pretty much\num but I think the main difference is\njust having my kids like if I I don't\nwant to sit in this room this dark room\nmaking videos when my kids are upstairs\ngrowing up like this is the early parts\nof their life like I I'm lucky enough to\nbe able to do what I want when I want\nbasically so I need to take advantage of\nthat and actually be there for my kids\nand and watched them grow up and that\njust I just wanted to do that more than\nmaking videos really yeah that's that's\nputting it simply I just wanted it to be\nthere would that have been hard for you\nearlier yeah 100% And that that was one\nof the big struggles that came\nwith having a baby in the first place\nlike our first is you have I spent 6\nyears or so only doing YouTube like that\nthat's it YouTube was everything like\ncontent that's all I think about that's\nall I would do so then going from that\ndown to one video a day from two was a\nbig jump and then the other jump was\ngoing from one video to a different\nschedule like one video a day leaving\nout days was just like oh I'm going to\nruin the consistency it was such a big\nthing of my growth that if I'm not\nconsistent it's just going to ruin\neverything but again that's probably\nwhere the the worst case scenario I'm\nlike oh if this happens I'm yeah the\nworst that can happen look at you\narticulating things and making\nconnections that thalis is firing baby\nlike it's well done therapy is\ngood and one of thing I just want to\npoint out I I I can't leave this un\naddressed but we should go back to I\nthink it's really cool because this is\nwhat I love to see when I work with\nsomeone is the goal of therapy is to no\nlonger need therapy and and some people\nsort of like in a sense need it their\nwhole life which I think is okay I don't\njudge that um think that just has to do\nwith the hand that you were dealt more\nso than your capability yeah but but I I\nthink what I really like about being a\ntherapist is like when I work with\npatients and they're able to do exactly\nwhat you're doing which is like you\nteach skills and the goal is actually\nIndependence MH um and I think we can\nsee it like it's so beautiful to see in\nreal time and I don't know who your\ntherapist was but they're clearly they\nwere awesome and you put in the work and\nand you can really see it but so it\nsounds like you were I just I thought it\nwas cool to see like it makes me happy\non the inside to see you kind of connect\nthose dots nice it's fun it's fun way\nyeah go ahead I was just going to say\nthe way I um again visualize the way\ntherapy works is someone they like hand\nyou the manual for your brain almost and\nthat's how we don't get given one of\nthose but going through therapy you kind\nof learn that that's that's how I\nthought about it is you're learning how\nyour brain makes those decisions and why\nthey have depending on what has happened\nto in your life\nor good or bad and then you get that\nmanual to deal with your specific brain\nthat's\nhow that's how I think about it yeah I\nthink I think it's it's beautiful like\nso I completely agree that we're not so\nthat's part of what we try to make in\nterms of our content is we try to teach\npeople you know so so the the papers\nthat I showed you today I'm I'm working\non a video on or a lecture on why men\ndon't ask for help yeah and and there is\na there is a manual to that there are\nreasons that this is like a uniform\nexperience especially for men um or the\nthe male type is different there are\nadditional reasons why women don't ask\nfor help and there are many reasons why\nno one asks for or there are many\nreasons why everyone doesn't ask for\nhelp\nso um and and you're right that there\nare manuals that we can learn about and\nthen like there's a specific there's\nlike the general manual and then there's\nlike for our model and both of those are\nI think one we can do through a lecture\nthe general model but then the the model\nthat's specific to you your particular\nlimited edition Dan you know you need to\nwork with an individual often times um\nyeah and and so it sounds like you were\nable to so but how how were you able to\nfor someone who's worked so hard are you\nkind of aware of the process of like\nwhat you had to do internally to like\ntake a\nbreak uh I think so it's I just kind of\nbit the bullet I guess there's there's\nalways that especially specific to\nYouTube It's a common thing that I spoke\nto lot of other content creators about\nis is will I be able to come back I'm\nalready I'm consistently doing my thing\nnow if I take even just a week's break\nsometimes for some people or even yeah\nfor me back in the day saying take a\nweek's break I be like no cuz it just\nupsets the rhythm of everything and then\nyou're like well if I do that to take my\nweek's break then cool but what if then\nI can't come back to it like I've ruined\nit the whole the whole thing that's\nreally common kind of mental mentality\nin in YouTube and content Creation in\ngeneral so for me I do feel lucky that I\nhave people that care enough about me\nand my videos for me to be able to come\nback yeah especially like my most recent\none where I came back made a Minecraft\nvideo after like a year at least of not\nmaking Minecraft videos and for people\nto be like this is awesome we missed you\nkind of thing I am very lucky to be able\nto do that cuz I know a lot of people\nlike some people just can't I I don't\nknow why that is but that is always a\nvery big concern for people on taking\nbreaks which is why we get this\nunhealthy cycle of just having to pump\nout content all the time but then at the\nsame time you can't make your best\ncontent unless you take breaks so yeah\nagain with the space thing like you\ncan't you can't be creative if you don't\nhave the space for it or if you're\nforcing it\nthat's you can't do that I I think you\nused a great word pump out right there\nthere's a difference between making\ncontent or like creating\nstorytelling and pumping out\ncontent yeah you know I worked with\nsomeone once who told me that they\nreally hate the word\ncontent because it's so lifeless it's\nlike what is it is it written is it\nvideo is it music it's it's like such a\nlifeless generic you know kind of term\num and and so that yeah that's that's\nsuper cool and I I think you know I\nthink we sometimes underestimate the\npower of\ncommunities and like I think there's a\nvery one-way\nperception of content creation which is\nlike there's the content creator and\nthen there's the audience but like I\nthink that there's a very back and forth\nand that like the audience like matters\na lot like the the community matters a\nlot and what is created is really like a\nlot more organic between two entities\nthan just like one person who's\ndisseminating and one person who's\nreceiving or a group of people who yeah\nI think you're you're right I guess\nthere is a difference between say if\nyou're a content creator that does just\npump out content and then there's none\nof that Community Building then if you\ndid take a month break you won't be able\nto come back because there's no\nCommunity for you to be excited about\ncoming back whereas I guess for for a\nlong\ntime I developed a community of of\npeople that do want to see what I make\nregardless of how long it takes for me\nto make that content whether it's\nthrough just making videos or then doing\nthe extra stuff like the touring and the\nthe meet and greets that I used to do so\nmuch that people really connected with\nso yeah I think you're right there is a\ndifference between the type of content\nthat can\nmaybe take long established breaks and\ncome back and not just in the way that\nyou approach it I it's interesting so\nfor me my phalus just connected those\ndots that that I wonder if so when I\nwhen we work with content creators we\nhave like a content creator coaching\nprogram so we worked with about 500\ncontent creators um and and of all sizes\nand and I a lot of a very common problem\nis like people feel like they can't take\na break and one of the things that we\nhaven't quite looked into yet but I\nthink I'm going to now very actively is\nlike understanding that your capacity to\ntake a break depends on\ncommunity and the bigger your or not the\nbigger but the the better your\nrelationship with your community the\neasier it will be to take a break yeah\nagreed\num yeah\nso I'm kind of\nlike let me just take a quick look\num I think everything that I have\nthought about to ask you I've asked at\nthis point I think we've been doing this\nfor about 90 minutes we kind of started\nlike kind of right on time um so I I'd\nlike to leave some space for you like I\nI think it's a beautiful story that\nyou've told us and like it feels\nsomewhat complete to me like we started\noff with like yeah I haven't taken a\nbreak in a long time and then we like\ntalked about this and then we talked\nabout this and you had kids and by the\nway the other thing that you could have\ndone in addition to uh potentially\nmedication or therapy cuz what triggered\nyour you know your second challenge is\nyou had another baby so you could you\nknow just avoid doing that you could be\nsalabit and that could have fixed your\nproblems too\nright but yeah so I I I it feels like\nthe story is kind of like at a decent\nstart and an end to me it doesn't mean\nthat the conversation has to be over but\nI I want to give you space if there's\nquestions that you have or things that\nyou wanted to talk about like I feel\nlike I've been driving for 90 minutes\nand I want to give you a chance to drive\nif you want to or we can kind of wrap up\nwhatever you feel comfortable with um\nyeah I don't I'm not sure if like I like\nyou said I think we've covered\neverything i' i' wanted to have talked\nabout I guess one thing would be we've\ntalked a lot about therapy and how\nbeneficial it is but obviously it's\nnot it's not that accessible for a lot\nof people that maybe do need it so what\nkind of approach could people take that\ncan't afford it I guess can't afford\ntherapy when it is something that is so\nbeneficial what are the steps you could\ntake like over here we have the NHS but\nat the same time it takes a couple years\nto get even looked at for for therapy\nand stuff like that so what advice would\nyou give to people\nthat feel like they need that extra help\nbut can access it I guess yeah so I I\nthink that um that's a great question\nand that was the question that got me\ninto what I do today oh wow okay cool so\nso like as a psychiatrist what I saw was\nlike you know I can help the people in\nmy\noffice but what I quickly realized is\nthat the number of people who need help\nfar outweighs the number of people who I\ncan see in my office oh yeah so a\npsychiatrist works I mean if you do\ntherapy like like I do and you know if\nyou do like 15minute medication visits\nthen you can see a bunch of people but\num you know I I would work with maybe\nabout 30 to 50 patients at a time when I\nwas like a full-time clinician and and\nso I was just like doing the math right\nso if I'm working with like 50 people at\na time I see you know I work with them\nfor about a year if I work for 40 years\nthat means I can help 2,000 people yeah\nand like more than 2,000 people need\nhelp so there's even um you know\ninstitutions like the NHS the United\nNations um even like the US Department\nof Public Health and and things like\nthat we all recognize that mental health\nin some way is a labor problem there is\njust there are just not enough people\nout there and that's just in developed\ncountries so this this is not even\nincluding places like erria\nEthiopia um Zimbabwe the Philippines you\nknow Laos Cambodia like there there are\njust so many parts of the world\nArgentina where you don't have like it's\nnot just that there aren't enough it's\nlike there are none or very very few so\nthen the question becomes what do we do\nand and I think like my answer is\nexactly what we're doing here so the\nfirst thing is that I think that you can\nteach people the manual the generic\nmanual so I I I think that we haven't as\na society taught people like how they\nwork so that's why we try to have all\nthese like videos and stuff like that\nthere's a very\npreliminary retrospective data analysis\nthat we did so if you look at medication\nor therapy it it leads to somewhere\nbetween a 30 and 60 30 to 60%\nImprovement is kind of what you get okay\nso we did a very preliminary analysis um\nand it's not like a a formal study that\nwe've run we're trying to structure a\nstudy to see if this initial finding is\ncorrect so I want people to take this\nwith a big grain of salt but even\nwatching our content can lead to like a\n10%\nImprovement oh wow so so and and chances\nare that the Improvement is much higher\nin some people and much lower in other\npeople but like I'll take it right so so\nso we we'll do that one of the things\nthat I'm really proud of is that we do\nhave um like clients in 121 countries so\nwe're reaching those corners of the\nworld where there's like nothing else\nand like that's the power of things like\ntwitch and YouTube is like you can get\nto places where there is no\ninfrastructure yeah so I would say um\nand then the third thing that that we\nall and this is the reason that we did\nit is is we started a peer support\ncoaching program and the reason that we\ndid that is that like you know the\nnumber of years it takes about eight\nyears to train a psychiatrist it takes\nabout five to six to train a\npsychologist you can work with like a\nlicensed clinical social worker and like\n3 to four so\nif you look at some of these things like\nmaybe that first person that you talked\nto because you said they weren't a\ntherapist right so that that's like\nusing the peer support model that model\nhas been shown to be incredibly\neffective alcoholic synonymous is a\ngreat example of that model where you\ndon't have to have a formal Workforce\nthat's been training for almost a decade\nin order to help people human beings can\nhelp other human beings I think you even\nalluded to this when you were kind of\nsaying you know when I had a kid it's a\ntribe it takes a it takes a village to\nraise a kid takes a vage yeah so there's\na lot of stuff like that um so I I think\nwe're actually that's like literally the\nwork that we're doing because I agree\nwith you that some people are very lucky\nand they have access to resources but\npeople who are not lucky like how do you\nbridge that Gap that's what we're trying\nto do this is the best answer that I've\ncome up\nwith it's it's a great thing that you're\ndoing for sure yeah I I'd like to think\nso you know we'll see um but you know\nwe've run a couple of studies and and\nthings like that and it looks like our\noutcomes are good but I I I think it\nkind of goes back to what you were\nsaying is that a lot of this is just we\ndon't know how to deal with it so if you\ndon't have access to a therapy I I think\nyou're a great great example of the\ndifference\nbetween when you know what the manual\nsays and when you don't know what the\nmanual says and that therapy I think is\na very fast way to learn it if you find\na good therapist but then like also some\nof these principles you don't have to\nlearn through therapy\nyeah um so for me for example I spent a\nlot of time studying to become a monk\nand I think I got a lot of this stuff\nthere um I I've done therapy for a\nrelatively brief period of time as part\nof my training but I think it's like an\nimportant thing to do even as a\ntherapist um so you kind of get both\nsides of it and like that was still\nincredibly useful like despite the fact\nthat I studied in India to become a monk\nfor a while and then like I came back\nand working with a therapist like helped\nme a lot too um and so I think that\nwe've got to learn the manual like we've\ngot to disseminate the manual and that's\nlike a great place to start but I I I\nwould not discourage anyone who has the\nopportunity for therapy to like go see a\ntherapist I don't think yeah and there\nare some people who are who have had\nnegative experiences with therapy and I\nthink it is important to keep in mind\nthat it doesn't work for everyone or the\nparticular set of therapists that people\nwill see don't work for them and I do\nthink there are a lot of things that can\nimprove our mental health that don't\nhave to be talk therapy so there's even\nresearch about this that if you look at\nlike studies on trauma like a lot of\nthis stuff is actually quite\nphysical um so I think we we\nunderutilize the body as a way of\nprocessing emotions and healing the mind\nor we think about emotions as mental but\nthey're not they're like at least 50%\nphysical so there are a lot of these\ntechniques that are kind of like\npseudoscientific like some of them now\nhave research support but they\ndefinitely started off as pseudo science\nthings like emotional Freedom technique\nand even things like yoga and taii these\nthings used to be considered pseudo\nscience right okay but I think\nespecially for dudes like we can use our\nbody like you know the the advice that\nwe'll get is if you go through a breakup\nlike hit the gym bro the gym yeah and I\nthink there's a reason that for that\nright there's some some people have\nfigured out that this is somehow\ntherapeutic and so I think we have a lot\nto\nlearn yeah I think I almost bought the\npoint up earlier when you were saying\nabout how when something comes out of\nyour mouth rather than even if the same\nthing you've been thinking about in your\nbrain it just changes the way you think\nabout it so I know we always like a lot\nof people say just talk like I I feel\nlike we don't do that still like people\nsay to do it but they don't they don't\nactually and I'm guilty of it too where\nyou just don't want to burden people\nwith your your issues but it does it\nhelps so much if you have a trusted\nperson that you can just talk all your\nall your thoughts about or talk all your\nthoughts about too yeah absolutely and I\nthink the last thing that we also did\nwas like so I think another big part of\nthis solution is is like I don't know if\nthis kind of makes sense to you but I'm\nlike super optimistic for your kids so\nfor your kids to have a dad like you I\nthink is like topnotch so I think a lot\nof mental health stuff I seriously I I'm\nnot saying it to you know glaze or\nwhatever whatever the kids say nowaday\ndays it's not because of your is um but\nbut really I I think that there was you\nknow it's not that parents are like so\nit sounds like your parents weren't\naware of the impact of their divorce on\nyou I'm not saying they're bad by any\nmeans so please don't hear that it's\njust you know they hadn't read the\nmanual yeah and so the first book that I\nwrote may sound kind of weird because\nthe majority of our audience is like\npeople and they're like late 20s maybe\nthat's the average age now but you know\nI wrote a book on raising children\nespecially with like technology so how\ndo you raise children to have a healthy\nrelationship with technology and I think\nthe single most impactful thing that I\ncan do is Empower\nparents to protect their children from\nthe harmful effects of Technology\nbecause that will work at a generational\nlevel yeah 100% um and and I I think the\nmethodologies in the book are really\ngood I find that often times um you know\npeople who are like familiar with gaming\nsort of like they don't need the book\nquite as much as like parents who don't\ngame as much but it it teaches a lot of\nreally solid like communication skills\nuh which especially like dads I think we\ndon't have great like we don't always\nknow how to speak and how to listen and\nit sounds like your wife did a\nphenomenal job of like taking what very\nlittle you said and really understanding\nwhat you meant and so it's it's really\ntrying to teach some of those\nskills um and so I think that's really\ngood the really interesting thing is we\nwe've heard a lot of positive feedback\nfrom people who don't even have kids\nthat some of the core communication\nskills in the book are very helpful at\nlike dealing with husbands who play too\nmany video games or wives who play too\nmany video games or siblings who play\ntoo many video games and just like it it\nteaches people like some of the manual\nof like communication and healthy\nrelationships with technology so that's\nthe last thing yeah it's interesting you\nsay that cuz like a lot of the stuff\nthat you go over over in therapy is\nsimilar to uh we G it's called like\ngentle parenting for for kids and I mean\nmy wife was the the\nbiggest I've learned a lot from my wife\nabout that and that's how we've taken\nthe approach to raise our kids but then\nyou go into therapy you're like this is\njust gentle parenting like myself yeah\nthere's a lot that there's a lot of\ncrossover there I found really\ninteresting yeah so I I think gentle\nparenting is fantastic I think the\nbiggest problem with it is that it\ndoesn't mean the same thing to everyone\nyeah I think you're right yeah so so\nit's not very well defined which is why\nlike we're not actually sure like how\neffective some of this stuff is because\nit means all kinds of stuff especially\nif you get your gentle parenting tick\ntips from Tik Tok um which can be wildly\nvariable but yeah I I think that's yeah\nwell said and they parts of it that are\nvery difficult to implement correctly as\nwell I think and my wife is very very\ngood at being able to study and\nunderstand that side of parenting and\nthen pass the info to me whereas I'm I'm\nnot I'm not great at that\nso but what I have learned is is\nimplementing that can be very difficult\nbut if you get it right then it's very\nbeneficial same in the same way that you\nthink about yourself in therapy and the\nway you treat yourself basically yeah\ncan you give me an example of something\nthat was hard to implement but you found\nto be very beneficial\n[Music]\num trying to think of a specific\nexample I think when you're dealing with\nkids it's more I mean it's same thing\nkind of taking yourself out of that\nsituation and putting them yourself into\ntheir shoes especially at an an age of\nlike three for example like their brains\nare completely different to ours I think\na lot of people do forget that yeah even\nthough um my son seems to be I mean he\nis he can perfectly communicate anything\nhe's he's a little human he's fully\noperational but he's four so you need to\nunderstand that his emotional\nand like his emotional development is\ncompletely different to us so the way we\nsee a situation is so different so\nthat's something that's helped me\nmassively in dealing with certain\ndifficult parenting situations it be\nlike okay let's think about it from his\nperspective like why is this s important\nto him even if it seems very unimportant\nto an adult is that making sense yeah I\nthink it makes a lot of sense so I I\nthink um with your standard\neloquencer is when parents treat\nchildren like miniature\nadults yeah so they're not miniature\nadults they're\nchildren and um you know one example\nthat I can think of is like often times\nparents don't realize when their child\nis tired so we'll like focus on\nbehaviors like if a child does something\nmean or hits you or throws something or\nthrows a temper tantrum like you know\nwe'll say like it's not okay to throw\ntemper tantrums and therefore we'll\npunish the child when the child does\nsomething bad which on the one hand is\nlike kind of okay but often times we\nforget as parents that the child is\nfatigued like their brain doesn't have\nthe same stamina that our brain has my\nability to not throw a temp P tantrum at\n6:00 p.m. when I am okay with 8 hours of\nsleep at night is different from a\nbaby's like you know a child's brain\nwhich just gets fatigued and they just\ndon't have like they've got nothing left\nin the tank to regulate their own\nbehavior yeah and that has to be\nbalanced with a child still has to learn\nhow to regulate them they can't you know\nyou they they're not always going to be\nwell rested so they have to learn how to\nrestrain themselves even when they're\nfatigued but I think that's like a\nreally good kind of nuance to that that\nI would say I kind of complete agree\nwith sounds like your wife is super\nknowledgeable and she is she's\nincredible\nyeah I think as well when it comes to\nthat like development thing like when\nthey're super young like my son like\nmiles he's one and a half so he's\ngetting into that frustrated age I think\na lot of what adults see kids as is as\nbeing naughty is like not it's actually\nexpression so if he's if he's frustrated\nand throws something and it hits you\nthat's that's him expressing himself in\nthe way that he understand he doesn't\nyeah exactly yeah so I think there's a\nlot of uh learning that needs to be done\nin that kind of relationship I think\nit's maybe just a generation above\nwhereas like my parents would probably\nview that as like naughty behavior when\nactually if you try and understand it\nfrom their level it's completely\ndifferent yeah most of the time well\nsaid well said yeah so I I I think I I\ncompletely agree with you I mean that's\nwhy it's it's kind of weird because even\nthough you know our main audience is not\nparents like that's what we chose to\nfocus on precisely because there are\nespecially the way that technology\ninterferes with children's brains and\nyou know teenagers brains and stuff like\nthat is like there's a whole different\nlayer of like now this is this weird\npart of the manual where we've got like\na flat tire you know it's not regular\noperation um and yeah that's going to be\ntough like when they get to like Teenage\neven when I was a teenager there wasn't\ninternet on your phones like\nthe uh the development of technology in\nthe time that I've been from teenager to\nNow isn't that long but it's been\nridiculous yeah so trying to navigate\nthat when they're already is going to be\ninteresting as someone who has an\nexperience like technology in the\ninternet like that as a teenager so\nthat's going to be that's going to be\ntough yeah so I I think there's some\nmovements so the the Surgeon General of\nthe United States just had a really\ninteresting oped where they were talking\nabout\num putting like a warning label on\nsocial media platforms kind of like what\nwe have on like cigarettes there are\nsome people who advocate for like ban\npeople are now trying to ban cell phones\nin school and and like yeah I think yeah\nI think we have that over here if not\nnow soon it's yeah so I I think we're\nstarting to wake up to some of these\ndangers and and so what we really tried\nwhat I tried to do is like I can't I'm\nnot the\ngovernment so I just wrote a book for\nparents and um yeah you know so we're\ndoing what we can but that's that's\nawesome do your play do your kids play\ngames uh so not currently\num Ash's personality type is very he\nwill fixate on a screen so if he sees a\nscreen like the rest of him is turned\noff like there's no other it's just\nzombie mode basically and he played like\nMario Kart for a bit then then we saw\nsome unhealthy behaviors is where he was\nlike he really wants to play Mario Kart\nso we just slowly phased it out now he\ndoesn't miss it like he doesn't he does\nother stuff like play outside or it was\nlike an educational game he was playing\ntoday but there's no extended amount of\nyeah switch time for example because we\njust saw an unhealthy behavior and he's\nstill young like he doesn't he doesn't\nknow how to operate it properly all of\nthe marioart stuff is all automated so\nis he really operating it anyway I don't\nthink he's old enough yet but we will\nhave to cross that bridge at some point\nespecially when his dad plays video\ngames every day so yeah yeah so I I\ntried to teach my older daughter how to\nplay Mario Kart when she was two and a\nhalf and didn't really work out now\nthey're they're solid healthy Gamers so\nthey'll they'll play for a couple hours\na couple times a week and we tend to\nhave fun with it and that's they're good\nthey're good with it so but we'll see I\ncaught my kid playing switch when she\nwasn't supposed to be like yesterday\nafternoon but then she told told me that\nshe got permission from another\ncaregiver in the house so that turned\nout to be okay I was like you're not\nsupposed to be doing that no but she's\nlike ah I got permission I was like okay\nfine nice the SM way yeah so that's\nawesome man thank you so much for coming\nany other questions before we wrap up\nfor the day I think that's it yeah um I\nreally enjoyed this conversation thank\nyou for having me on it's been it's been\na pleasure yeah I mean I I really I know\nI know it's hilarious I mean not\nhilarious I I totally get where you come\nfrom in terms of like not feeling like\nyou're eloquent but I absolutely loved\nthe way that you described your\nexperience thank you so much for sharing\nthat because I think it'll resonate with\nso many people I can guarantee you that\nthere are people who are going to watch\nthis and be like I'm like that um and I\nsay as someone who like I was like that\nright like I I mean I didn't even we we\ndidn't go into that we didn't need to\nbut you know I think often times we\ndon't know what we're experiencing we\ndon't really know when we need help we\nfeel like we have to be able to handle\nit on our own especially For Men We view\nasking for help\nso we think that there's independent\nindependent and we think that asking for\nhelp is not a part of\nIndependence yeah right so like if I'm\nasking for help I'm not independent the\nreally fascinating thing is if you look\nat the research people who ask for help\nbecome more independent over\ntime and when you ask for help it is\nactually a problemsolving behavior that\nallows you to achieve a\ngoal and and so it's it's really\nfascinating but thank you so much for\ncoming today Dan good luck with you know\nparenting and all that good stuff thanks\nyou too you know I think they're\nseriously your parents are lucky I mean\nyour kids are lucky to have parents like\ny'all um that's very kind of you thank\nyou and welcome back to making content\nand looking forward to what you back\nthanks all right take care buddy yeah\nyou too thank you very\nmuch um oh yeah we should probably send\nhim a copy of the book let me hold on\nlet me see if we\ncan\num hold on a\nsecond should probably do that I should\nhave said that before I kicked him off\nanyway okay so that was\nfun um yeah so if you guys you\nknow are young parents and youall want\nto know what to do with tech definitely\ncheck oh okay he's got one\nokay\num uh so it looks like he already got it\ninteresting maybe he purchased it\nfascinating then we should have asked\nhim what he thought about it but anyway\nthat's all whatever okay so thank you\nall so much for coming today I I think\nuh hopefully that was helpful for y'all\nI absolutely like amazing dude amazing\ndude um a couple of things that I just\nwant to kind of highlight the first is\nthat one of the things that we know\nabout illness in general so I was about\nto say Mental Illness but it's true\nphysical illness as well so there are\ncorrelations between socioeconomic\nstatus and illness so generally speaking\nif you are poor if you're an ethnic\nminority if you have fewer resources you\nare more vulnerable if you're an\nimmigrant you are more vulnerable to\ncertain kinds of ill\nand this is true of just about\neverything but the key thing to remember\nis that illness is\nnot just because there is an overall\nGlobal slightly increased or in some\nways in some cases a large increase in\nrisk factors being successful in some\nway does not protect you definitively\nagainst illness I've seen people who are\nrich and people who are poor both get\ncancer I've seen people who are good and\npeople who are evil both get cancer same\nis true of mental illness so mental\nillness is something that people\noftentimes think if my life is\ngood then I shouldn't be depressed but\nthe Hallmark of clinical depression is\nfeeling bad about your life when you\nhave no reason to this is why we call it\na pathology right so there's something\ncalled adjustment disorder which is when\nyour life is going to crap and you feel\nbad about it that is actually\nnormal but for to to qualify for a mood\ndisorder one of the key crit IIA is that\nthe way that you feel is like maybe\nsomewhat triggered by stress but then\nhas a life of its\nown so in Dan's case they just had kids\nso it's very stressful no one's sleeping\nit's the pandemic very stressful but\nthere is something that sort of develops\na life of its own that transcends the\nsimple stress that you're going through\nand mental illness does not\ndiscriminate right so even though\nthere's some data that there risk\nfactors and protective factors the risk\nfactors are not like they're not\nInvincible right so they don't guarantee\nthat poor people are going to get sick\nand rich people aren't going to get sick\nand the really devastating thing about\nthis stuff is\nthat when we blame ourselves for feeling\na particular way I shouldn't feel this\nway when I when we invalidate ourselves\nand we blame ourselves that just\naccelerates the problem it's a huge\nproblem right so I don't care who you\nare where you are how old old you are\nhow privileged you are how\nunderprivileged you are if you are\nstruggling it's okay to struggle and do\nthe best that you can to get help we\nbuild what we can here and I thought\nDan's question was great like what do\npeople do if they can't see a therapist\nI think the right answer is the right\nanswer the fact that circumstances make\nit difficult does not change the right\nanswer right if I get like a bacterial\ninfection and I need antibiotics the\nfact that I don't have if I'm on the\nMoon by myself that doesn't change the\nfact that I need antibiotics\nso medical treatment for mental illness\nis the right\nanswer and at the same time if you don't\nhave access to it or even if you have\naccess to it what we've tried to build\nhere is something that supplements the\nmedical\nsystem it's a public health intervention\nnot a medical one right and this is\nsomething that I know we have this\ndisclaimer where it's like it's not\nmedical advice and it's really\nnot it's recognizing that in order to\nlet's say if we want to tackle obesity\nas a medical problem we can start things\nlike medications we can even have\ngeriatric surgery and there is Diet\nthere's exercise there's confidence\nbuilding there's mental stuff there's\nstress reduction there's meditation\nthere's yoga there's ta Chi there many\nthings that you can do for your health\nthat are not medical treatment which are\ntherapeutic and that's what we encourage\nyall to take advantage of that's what we\ntry we try to bridge that Gap because\nit's way more available for our physical\nbody there are gyms on every street\ncorner but there are not meditation\ncenters on every street corner right\nthere are like these smoothie places\nwhere you can have a healthy\nsmoothie instead of a processed meal and\ndepending on the smoothie place it will\nbe loaded with sugar and be very\ndiabetogenic right but it's healthy huh\nit's healthy diabetes healthy diabetes\nwe are putting a scoop of super food\ntherefore it is healthy no it tastes\ndelicious oh that's just because it's\nhealthy cuz healthy things taste\ngood so the last thing that I want to\nsay is well is probably not the last the\nnext thing I want to say is Dan was\nspoton about community and like I love\nthis man this is great I love being able\nto be here with y'all it's a Friday\nafternoon technically I'm working but\nthis feels awesome this is what how\nlucky can I get and can I mean hopefully\nall are lucky to um and and yeah like\nthis is great we do this because of\ny'all y'all are the energy that keeps us\ngoing so we're grateful for that right\nand so thank youall very much for coming\nand being here we want to share one last\nthing which is sort of like a\ninteresting Community win um so someone\nposted something a couple days ago and\nwe just wanted to share that with y'all\nand this is maybe a little bit of Obama\ngiving himself a medal if you guys know\nthat one we're going to Google\nthis\num right so if you guys have no what\nthis is not Obama giving himself medal\ndoes Google not\nknow\nwhat this is\ncrazy there we go so this is maybe just\na little bit of this\nbut um incredible massive thank you to\nto healthy gamer so the amount of\ncontent that HG has churned out in 2024\nespecially mental health May has been\ninsane all the live streams from the\npast 5 months but especially since\nmeaning purpose motiv\nbased stream I don't even remember that\nhad been straight heat for me so many\nideas have clicked and tied together Dr\nK stream several times a week in May\nalong with reading over 200 papers every\nother week um and if you guys want to\nsee what I'm reading today not this week\ntoday these are the papers we're reading\ntoday okay so this is like an ongoing\nthing um\nso uh releasing one book writing more\nbooks and doing administrative work with\nHG is massively appreciated the members\nchannel has also been fantastic one of\nmy favorite Parts being Karma part one\nthe idea of aami karma where our\nthoughts are seeds that sew future\noutcomes in the concept of each action\nwe we take like a deck building game was\ngamechanging for me and I paired with\nnoticing that over 90% of thoughts were\nreally really are vasas mental habits\nand there's the Neuroscience axium that\nneurons that fire together wire together\nto me this supports the idea of vasas\nquite a bit\nI'm also really I I've also really\nreally enjoyed the meditation streams on\nthe member side I'm hoping to do more\ntantric practices in the future I'm very\ngrateful that those ideas were shared I\nhaven't made my way through the trauma\nguide yet but I attended the workshop\nlast October and that was a 10 out of 10\nso I'm super excited Dr K's trauma\ncontent is among the strongest on the\nchannel and I can see the passion\nbleeding every time he talks about it to\nme the trauma content is the highest\nyield stuff on the channel and I really\nloved what was said during either the\ncptsd or dissociation streams where the\nYoung Generation is dealing with smaller\nforms of the emotional disregulation\nidentity fragmentation and physiological\nrewiring that is present in a full-blown\nPTSD diagnosis but the methods of\ntreatment are the same someone has been\npaying attention\nchat gy deserves a massive shout out\nbeing the CEO of a rapidly growing\nmental health company that isn't\nbeholden to investors or advertisers\nsounds incredibly difficult while Dr K\nmay be the primary face of the company\nthere's a massive ount of work happening\nbehind the scenes too coaching program\nseems like a big success and I'm really\nhyped for the HG Institute I've shadowed\nseveral psychiatrists in my area and I\nthink they would absolutely benefit from\nthe continuing education courses that\nthe HG Institute may\nhave any videos to change the public\nschool system would be awesome we're\nworking on that by the way I'm picturing\nsome cohort study where these ideas are\ntaught to certain grades and then\ntracking their outcomes to see if they\noutperform other classes I would love to\ndo that that takes millions and millions\nand millions of dollars which we do not\nhave all the editors graphic designers\nHG science board all contributing to an\nawesome Vision completely agree there's\na much longer HG appreciation post that\nI've been meaning to write for some time\nabout how my communication has greatly\nimproved and subsequently helped my\nfamily not be be fighting all the time I\nalso want to write about how the sscar\ntrauma Concepts have been lifechanging\nalong with the meditation and emotional\nawareness in the past I've had enormous\ndifficulties with studying due to\nemotion disregulation issues avoiding\nshame being stuck on the social media\ndopamine train feeling unconfident in my\nstudying operational avoidances and many\nmore reasons with a lot of work studying\nis now becoming much easier and even\nenjoyable when I do it first thing in\nthe morning before I squeeze my dopamine\nlemon juice with social media from the\nbottom of my heart I'm deeply grateful\nthank you all so much I saw a members\nannouncement that Dr K will be taking a\nbreak in July I'm really happy to see\nthat please don't burn out on us\nhaha I do hope everyone is able to take\ncare of themselves so y'all are welcome\nI think we share sometimes we share wins\non the channel but part of the reason we\nwanted to highlight this is you know\nfirst of all Obama giving Obama a medal\nbut I I think that this person really\ndid a fantastic job of first of all like\nthis is why we do this this is sort of\nthe poster child of our audience so we\ndo this stuff to help people\nright it is not all for the greater\nglory of Dr K some of it is but not all\nof it we're really here to help people\nbecause this is the thing is like like\nthis person was saying technology is\nshaping our brains and it's not just\ntechnology it's that people like Dan and\nlike yourselves and like everyone else\nwho's come on on the stream and posted\nin our subreddit life happens to us but\nwe don't know how to navigate it we\ndon't know what the impact of our\nparents divorce on our anxiety is we\ndon't know why it's so hard for us to\nshare with other people that we are\nstruggling we literally know the words\nto say and we cannot bring ourselves to\nsay it we don't know why we keep on\navoiding studying when all we want to do\nis is study this topic and and do this\nthing I'd bet that this money is I'd bet\nmoney that this kid is a pred has pred\nwritten all over him or\nher and and we don't know right we don't\nknow how we work and we're here to help\ny'all understand that because the way\nSociety is going if you all do not\nunderstand yourselves we're\nscrewed because other people outside of\nus understand us better than we\nunderstand ourselves and those people\nare using that knowledge not for your\nbenefit they're using it to gain your\nattention to sell stuff to advertisers\nand to make\nmoney they understand you so well see\nall you need to do is look at your cell\nphone to understand\nthis why is the icon the color that it\nis why did people develop things like\nBiometrics and face ID why did they\ndevelop notifications why is every\nfeature of an app or something on your\nphone or the internet from that matter\nthe way that it is and I don't think\nthat these companies are necessarily\nevil a lot of people will be like oh my\nGod they're evil I think they have a job\nto\ndo right they have a job to do just like\nanyone who makes a sandwich their job is\nto sell that sandwich then and hopefully\nthey they use quality as their main\nreason and it's not necessarily that\neveryone out there is evil but the those\ninfluences are still there right we can\ncreate a society that is not\nintentionally evil that can still be\nharmful parents can go through a divorce\nbecause it's the right thing to do for\nthem and even for their family because\nstaying together is untenable will\ncreate a toxic household and it has\nnegative consequences for the\nchildren so this is the way that life\nis not all damage has to be through\nmalice in fact I would say the majority\nof what goes wrong in life is not driven\nby\nmalice right I don't know that a virus\nhas malice when they infect you and give\nyou\ncovid life is just the way that it is\nand to avoid the problems in life it's\nnot that we need a society that is\npristine and good and hyperoral and\nperfect in that way what we need is to\nunderstand the system of\nlife science has given us so much\nprogress science is not about morality\nit's not about right or wrong science is\nabout understanding the\nhow that's what we need more than\nanything else is the science of how you\nwork so then you should be in control\nand you do with that whatever you want\nright so it'd be nice if you did a good\nthing but it's ultimately it's your\nchoice right nuclear energy can be used\nto make a nuclear power plant or a\nnuclear bomb I think one is better than\nthe\nother but that's the the way of\nit and so the last thing is that this\nperson was giving a lot of people shout\nouts the last shout out which always\ngets forget forgotten is\ny'all this is where the biggest shout\nout\nwhat is Dr K without y'all\nnothing what Dr K is is maybe he's Dr\nkogia but that's a different person\nright that's a dude sitting in an office\nseeing patients and maybe he's doing\nsome good in the world I won't deny\nit but y'all are the lifeblood that\nkeeps this going as the person said we\ndon't have investors we don't have\nadvertisers occasionally we'll take\nsponsorships and we're going to slow\nthose down a little bit by the way we\nhad more sponsorships in May because May\nis just we just do more of\neverything but y'all are the lifeblood\nright y'all are the ones that show up on\nstream y'all are the ones that show up\nin chat yall are the ones that teach me\nwhat Riz is teach me what glaze is teach\nme what ligma is where would I be\nwithout that and y'all have also\nrecently taught me what gooning\nis y'all the ones who post the questions\ny'all are the ones who ask the questions\ny'all are the foundation really it's\nwhat what\nwhat\nis this live stream without chat it's an\nit's a dude talking to an empty\nroom that is nothing\nsignificant y'all are also the ones that\nsupport us so this person signed up for\nthe trauma Workshop I you know it's the\nbig irony there is it's one of the best\nthings that we've probably ever done why\ndidn't we do another one because it's\nvery expensive for the people who who\nsigned up right it was awesome we'll\nprobably do them more in the future but\nwe wanted to make something more\naccessible sold out in 24\nhours everyone loved\nit right and so y'all are the ones that\nthe only way reason this works is\nbecause of y'all y'all are the ones that\nask the questions y'all are the ones\nthat sign up for Stuff y'all are the\nones that show\nup and you know it doesn't the healthy\ngamer doesn't exist without you and\npeople on the people like this posted\nthis thing and therefore that is the\ncontent that that's what I read out loud\nis is\ny'all and so you know the only way this\nworks so Dan said you know it takes a\nvillage to raise a child I think it\ntakes a community to like Save the\nInternet and I I see so many things\nsomeone was talking me today to today\nabout women who date men who are\nbecoming increasingly misogynistic\nbecause of the social media content\nalgorithms and this is where there's a\nlot of people will say like oh yeah you\nknow this person is like descending into\nmisogyny just break up with them I I\ndon't you know that's\nnot I don't like that I think that when\nsomeone is doing something wrong we\nshould make a full faith effort to try\nto bring them back onto the right path\nand who are we to decide what's right or\nwrong I don't really know right so I\nthink that there's so many problems the\nproblems are emerging they're evolving\nthey're evolving faster than we can keep\nup with\nthem and someone's got to do something\nabout this like the right now the\nproblem in the dating world is it's so\neasy to dump someone it's so easy to go\nsomeone no one makes an effort to help\nsomeone else no one tries to pull\nsomeone else in it's all my way or the\nhighway I don't like\nthat\nright and so we're going to do what we\ncan but we can't do it on our own we\nneed you yall are actually the lifeblood\nI'm just the\nface and so a huge thank you thank you\nto y'all for making Mental Health Health\nAwareness Month as possible as it was to\nmake it as big as it was yall are the\nones that are clicking on the thumbnails\nshowing up at the live streams and\nwithout that I would be working in an\noffice so huge thank you to\nyou and we're going to continue to need\nyour help and the rest of the world\nneeds your\nhelp when Dan does the work that he does\nit's not just about his benefit it's\nlike now their dad has gone to therapy\nand imagine what your life would be like\nif your parents had gone to therapy if\nyou're lucky enough to have parents who\nwent to therapy hopefully that was\nhelpful for\nyou right so this is the last thing that\nyall really need to understand it's not\njust about me and healthy gamer and you\nand oh my God he's glazing on the\ncommunity oh my God no y'all are a h\neach and every one of you is a human\nbeing and you will impact hundreds and\nthousands of\nlives your goodness your assholery will\nimpact other human beings\nand the whole problem with the world\ntoday is that people don't really\nappreciate that right if you look at the\npeople who hurt you in life how much are\nthey aware of the power that they have\nto shape your\nlife whether it's someone who doesn't\nanswer your text someone who ghosts you\nsomeone who makes fun of you someone who\nbullies you someone who cheats on\nyou people don't quite understand the\nresponsibility that they\nhave and you all have a big\nresponsibility as\nwell right and I'm not saying that\neveryone can be perfect all the time or\nthat everyone can even be good all the\ntime sometimes life makes us do things\nthat can be damaging or hurtful to other\npeople and even if we have to do that so\nfor example there are times where like\nfor I've like fired a patient right a\npatient I'm their doctor and then\nsomething is not working out and I'm not\nable to help them or what's much more\ncommon is people ask me for help and I\nsay I'm sorry I can't help you that\nhappens very\ncommonly so when I started streaming you\nknow I was getting between 5 and 10,000\nrequests per month in my private\npractice no way I can help all of them\nbarely any of them almost none of them\nso I had to say no and that's hurtful\nfor to someone I don't have a choice I\njust can't see 10,000 people a month\njust not physically possible and so\nsometimes times in life we have\ncircumstances that Force us to take\nactions that can be hurtful to other\npeople but even then at least have the\nawareness of it do whatever you can to\nsoften the\nblow and in the situations where you\nmake mistakes learn from those mistakes\nand then next time around try to soften\nthe blow even\nmore right this is what we have to do\nit's the only way that this is going to\nwork y'all like we're responsible for\nthis world it takes a village it takes a\ntribe it takes a community to try to fix\nthis\nplace and the real tragedy of humanity\nis one person can screw things up way\nmore than one person can fix\nthem way easier to break something is to\nto make\nsomething and since I've been gaming\nrecently it only takes one player on\nyour team to throw your game that you\nshould\nwin but it takes all of y'all working\ntogether to make a\ncomeback it only takes one to throw but\nit takes everybody working together to\nundo a throw you just need one Noob to\nfeed you just need one toxic person to\ntilt everyone else on your team this is\nthe world that we live in this is why\nit's so frustrating to play multiplayer\ngames right this is the life that we\nlive\nin so we're going to do the best that we\ncan I'm doing what I can I'm done for\nthe day I'm going to play something I'm\nnot going to play Elden ring because I\ncan't get that started I have too much\nwork to do so part of me being a healthy\ngamer is going to be waiting until I'm\ndone with all of my work and have a lot\nof work done and then I'm going to have\nsome\nbandwidth but I will play maybe a little\nbit of star sector maybe a little bit of\nDOTA we'll see and I hope you all have a\nwonderful weekend thank you so much for\ncoming not just to today but for the\nlast 4 years honestly from the bottom of\nmy heart thank y'all for being here and\ncoming every day with y'all do cuz we\nwould be nothing without you and the\nworld would be not to say that we're\ngoing to fix the world but the world\nwould be dare I say more screwed without\nwhat we're doing here so this is really\nimportant and thank you so\nmuch I'm going to go feed and maybe lose\nsome MMR we'll see and y'all have a good"
