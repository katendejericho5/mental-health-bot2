    "transcript": "let's remember that negative emotions\nare drivers for positive change so if I\nget angry at someone because they steal\nfrom me instead of like processing that\nanger with a therapist I can use that\nanger to set boundaries with them and\nblock them right the other thing is if\nwe look at emotions like guilt and shame\nlike we can go into a therapist's office\nand we can metabolize them with the\ntherapist but why do we feel guilt we\nfeel guilt because sometimes we do the\nwrong things and guilt is an emotion\nthat helps us do the right thing that's\nhow we know the difference between right\nand wrong if we didn't have guilt we\nwouldn't have an internal moral compass"
