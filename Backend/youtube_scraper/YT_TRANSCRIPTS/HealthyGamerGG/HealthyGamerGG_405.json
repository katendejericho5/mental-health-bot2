started welcome\nto another healthy gamer GG stream my\nname is all kenoa just a reminder that\nalthough I am a psychiatrist nothing we\ndiscuss on stream today is intended to\nbe taken as medical advice everything is\nfor educational or entertainment\npurposes only holds especially true\ntoday because we are talking to the one\nthe only the\ndestiny about stimulants I think I think\nhe's got some questions about stuff um\nso we'll kind of hop in with him in a\nminute and uh you know I I think that\nwhat we're going to be talking about\ntoday we'll talk to him a little bit\nmore and just make sure we're all on the\nsame page is I think there's a lot of\nlike information about stimulant use and\nwhat to expect and how to think about it\num when I teach like Psychiatry\nresidents and medical students about the\nsubject which it's been a little while\nsince I've done that um but there's just\na lot of consideration so I think it's\ntotally fine to share you know that kind\nof information but we will not be\ndispensing any medical advice and if you\nall have a concern or question and you\nthink that something we're talking about\nis relevant to you and hopefully we'll\nexplain this over the course of you know\nour conversation with Destiny please go\nsee a licensed professional because it's\nabsolutely true that um you know as as I\nhopefully will demonstrate like I think\nit's a very individual choice that\ndepends on what's kind of right for you\nand figuring out what's right for you\nusually involves talking to a medical\nprofessional because they may have all\nkinds of questions that people don't\nreally think\nabout when they're sort of like learning\nabout medication especially stimulants\nso we'll share some of those\nconsiderations but I really think it\nthere it's important to have some solid\nback and forth and have someone who\nknows you well understands what your\ngoals are um so that you can make the\nright choice or they can make they can\nhelp you make the right choice for\nwhat's what's good for y'all\num anyway so a couple of quick\nannouncements before we uh hop\ninto um our call with Destiny so we're\ngoing to be talking I assume today about\nADHD so if y'all are interested in more\ninfo on that we have a whole guide to\nADHD for people who are interested in\nmore in-depth\ninformation um and so if y'all are\ninterested in understanding a little bit\nmore about the clinical perspective and\nthe guides are sort of designed to\nbe um they kind of mirror what the\ninformation that I share with people\nthat I work with so sort of like what's\nsome of the clinical fundamentals it's\nnot a substitute for medical treatment\nbut the guide to ADHD and doing stuff\nalso has a lot of like really strong\ntechniques around helping yourself\norganize helping to train your mind to\nfocus and concentrate so if you\ninterested check that out um we actually\ndo have some coaching spots available\nfor like the first time in a while so if\nyall are interested in getting getting\nsupport around figuring out um you know\nwhat you're trying to do in life how to\novercome challenges and make progress\ndefinitely check out\ncoaching I see we have a question hey Dr\nK why do you always take the side of\nwomen you were doing it all day\nyesterday I think I take the side of\nhumans and what I'm curious about is\nlike if we're saying take the side of\nwomen who's on the opposite\nside right that's what I'm I'm confused\nabout so like who's on the opposite side\nso if we take the side of women who's\nwho's on the opposite side\nseriously like I'm\ncurious right because like even that\nstatement implies a certain antagonism\nright that there's someone I mean I\nthink like I'm on the side of humans and\nI think when it comes to gender Dynamics\nlike it's\ncomplicated and you know everyone in\nthis world every single person in this\nworld suffers for a different reason and\nmy my goal is to try to have compassion\nfor everybody I'm not saying that I'm\ngoing to do it right because I'm human\nand at some point someone's going to\npiss me off or I'm going to get offended\nor triggered or whatever to the point\nwhere I'm going to be like no compassion\nfor you it'll happen one day it's\nhappened in the past for sure there are\nlike two or three people that I really\ndislike in this\nworld um but I I I think that you know\nhopefully it's good that I'm taking the\nside of women but then I also have a a\ncon like I have another objection to\nthat characterization which is the side\nso I don't think women are like a\nhomogeneous group I think it's okay to\ntake the side of some people but not\nother women and it's not like they're\nall on one team against somebody else on\nthe other team that's just not how I see\nit now you may see it differently and\nfor the record I may be wrong like you\nmay say hey look you're wrong and here's\nwhat's going on and by all means I'm I'm\nall ears right so like I'll be the first\nto admit that when it comes to gender\nDynamics especially on dating I don't\nknow much about that because it's been a\nlong time since I went on a date and\nI've never used a dating\napp um but I appreciate your comment and\nI tried to address it the best way that\nI could and if you know yall have other\nconcerns or objections please let me\nknow\nbut really who's on the opposite\nside that's what I'm wondering\nabout um let me see if I can get this\nactually\nworking while we're\nwaiting uh let's see if I can get this\nokay let me see oh looks like I can't do\nthat on YouTube but so be it we'll mess\nwith it in a second when Destiny's on\num okay so uh we also have\num jaquelin saying uh stop vaping and\nsmoking weed your big reason is to why\nthank you Dr K you know that's great\njaquin like I I really think um you know\nwhen it comes to like weed and\nnicotine I think it's really hard to\ntell um\nhow that stuff affects us when we start\nusing it for a long time so I I shared\nthis stuff I think recently on stream\nthis week but you know one of the things\nI've noticed is like working in\naddiction Psychiatry is like when I work\nwith people especially who let's say use\nalcohol what they sort of find is that\nthere's you know they drink every day or\nthey drink regularly and they like they\nthink that this is like what it like\nwhat's what it's like to be normal right\nthey have sort of this idea of a normal\nlevel of consciousness and when we have\nthis normal level of Consciousness I\ndon't think we really realize that what\nwe\nreally what our Baseline level of\nConsciousness is is actually different\nso I'll see people who don't really feel\nthe full effects of sobriety until 3\nmonths 6 months out so just to give you\nall an example about alcohol so alcohol\nhas multiple effects on your State of\nConsciousness it has an acute effect of\nthe substance floating around in your\nbrain it has a tolerance effect of when\nwe have alcohol regularly we develop a\nsense of tolerance so then in the\nabsence of alcohol those neurological\nadaptations still exist it Tak some time\nto develop tolerance and some time to\nget rid of Tolerance this is what we\nkind of call withdrawal when people are\ngetting rid of their\ntolerance and then there's even more\nDownstream effects that are 3 six months\nlater because we know that alcohol is\ncytotoxic to white matter which means\nthat it\ndamages the supportive structures in our\nbrain the supportive cells and when it\ndoes\nthat that takes time to heal like months\nyo\ndude give me just a\nsecond count to 10 for\nme are you say oh [ __ ] okay hold on\nwonder if I'm screwed up say something\nagain okay I think uh is it me is it\nyou um I can't hear you but it's me it's\nme\nokay I don't oh that's\ninteresting hold on we are going to\ndo Tex\nsupport output devices\ndefault so let's check okay this is\nworking mic test\nsoundboard test video\ndefault testing testing\ntesting\ntesting oh yeah you're\nright hold\non give me a\nsecond that's so\nweird\ngive me a second hold on chat technical\ndifficulties\nokay I'm trying to test desktop stuff\nbut I and you're sure it's not you\nright because I other stuff works I\nwonder if it's a problem on\nDiscord um I can't hear\nyou you uh you're pointing\ndown\ndefault you want to type oh look at what\nyou're typing look at what you're typing\nI figured I got you I got\nyou okay it should be coming yeah you're\nright so green box is lighting up you\nright okay let's do this though but I'm\nso confused about\nwhy hold on\n[Music]\noh I'm I'm with you that the green box\nis lighting up which usually means it's\nmy\nproblem uh let's fix this real\nquick okay so this\nworks hold\non all right good enough uh and then I\ndon't know why Discord isn't\nworking\num hold on\nyeah you are lighting up\nright okay so speakers are set to\ndefault\nokay hold on one\nsecond I'm going to drop out of the call\nfor a second\nokay\num let me see if I can test with\nsomebody\nelse I don't know\nwhy give me a second\nchat okay that works you guys heard that\nright let me see if there's somebody\nelse I can hop on in with\nnope um\num I'm so\nconfused voice and\nvideo voice\nactivity yeah y'all are right I don't\nhear a um you should hear a little beep\nwhen you change your output device\nright that's so weird\nyeah I usually I hear a a\nbite wait did y'all hear a a\nping nope no ping on desktop\naudio so it looks like it's on my end\ntesting testing\ntesting\num\nI don't\nknow it's\nweird let me try restarting\nDiscord\nokay nope I don't think that I think\nDiscord doesn't\nclose okay now it looks\nclosed now let's\ncheck try blowing on it try different\nyeah so so you know I have my default\nWindows audio output and then I\nhave hey Tech\ntell yeah I have a problem with my\nDiscord output for some reason it's not\nworking um and I have no idea why\nbecause this was working fine like\nyesterday\nbut y'all can't hear Tech tell\nright\num I can't hear you oh oh I I can okay\nokay okay okay I can hear you y'all can\nhear Tech\ntell wait did y'all hear texal\nthere testing\ntesting testing okay I can hear you chat\ntesting one two testing testing one two\nthree\nokay okay I can't hear\nyou\nuh but okay don't worry about that let\nme hop on with Destiny I'll ping you in\na\nsecond all right\nDestiny brauh\nplease tell me you can hear\nme can you hear me now hello hello we\ngot it can you hear\nme um yeah can you hear me yes okay\nwe're\ngood sorry about that I have no idea\nwhat\nhappened well the only thing that\nmatters is we're here now so yes that's\nyou know it terrifies me because like\nthe stuff is just set up you\nknow um what do you mean by I don't that\nwas a very vague statement what do you\nmean the stuff is just set I mean like\nso so like if you configure\nDiscord and then you close the program\nand then you open the program and you\nhaven't changed any settings and it's\nworked like a thousand times before it\njust sometimes stops\nworking yeah audio is weird you know\nyeah it's weird like that and I didn't\neven I just closed Discord and reopened\nit and didn't change any\nsettings so turning it back on off and\nturning it back on again seems to work\nwell I'm going to be honest my level of\nexpertise with tech is quite High and\nthe number one troubleshooting thing I\nstill do personally is also turning it\noff and on again that's probably how I\ntroubleshoot like 80% of my problems or\nunplugging it and plugging it into a\ndifferent slot especially with USB um\nfor some reason some USB slots are just\nreally weird so hey you know that's a\nlegitimate form of troubleshooting yeah\nI I mean because all the stuff you were\nsaying I usually walk people through\nstuff because I have leveled up my\ntroubleshooting skill in life mhm um but\nanyway thanks for thanks for talking\ntoday\nman yeah what's up um you tell me bro\nhow have you\nbeen\num uh let me hold on let me I want to\nfocus on this I have one quick thing um\nokay um how have I been um good I think\nit's like a busy uh UST stress like lots\nof stress but there's lots of stuff\ngoing on there's lots of activity it's\njust it's a lot of stuff it's always a\nlot of stuff that's cool what kind of\nstuff are you you\ndoing um well I had there was an\ninteresting weird legal situation with\nmy wife where they were because of how\ncomplicated the international taxes are\nSweden thought that they were cooking\nher books which is ridiculous but uh I\ncame here to Sweden to be with her for\nher Court thing seems like it went\nreally well she finally got her passport\nback so that's good um I have then going\nwith my parents where I kind of like\nmade a deal with them that because my\nmom has Alzheimer's disease and it's\nstarting to advance more noticeably uh I\nmade a deal with my dad that if long as\nas long as they close all of their\ncredit cards and they get rid of all\ntheir credit and they freeze their\naccounts I'll pay all their debt offs so\nthat my dad can retire early um and then\nthat's been a thing I've been kind of\nworking on in the background um\nobviously as my platform has gotten\nlarger and I've like expanded to more\npeople I'm trying to like manage like my\nstreaming my traveling and being on\nother podcasts my responsibilities being\nlike a political guy and and like\nfinding like what my bearing should be\non all of that especially in of red pill\n[ __ ] um I've had this huge thing\nrecently about uh the medication stuff\nthat I reached out to\num I yeah I've got yeah there's a\nmillion things there's always a million\nthings I've hired a lot of new employees\nI've got a podcast that I hope I'm\nfinally starting um yeah just yeah just\nlike a million things yeah wow so I'm\nI'm I am hearing a million things so\nlike personal stuff on several fronts um\nprofessional development stuff but also\nlike it sounds like\nyou're uh not doing I'm I'm getting the\nsense that you're juggling different\nkinds of balls than than you used to um\nyeah a little bit Yeah more personal\nstuff now I think maybe yeah well even\neven I mean so I when I think about\nlet's say three years ago and in the\nkind of work that you you did you were\nmostly streaming and and now it sounds\nlike you're doing a lot of other\nstuff yeah well still trying to do\nmostly streaming yeah trying yeah like\nmy audience makes fun of me for never\nstreaming anymore but like last month I\nstreamed 170 hours and that accounts\nthere no streaming for them so wow but\nlike yeah yeah so yeah it's a lot of 170\nhours that's a lot lot\nman yeah I try but they're used to me\nway back in the day I would stream like\n300 hours and then they're probably more\nused to like 200 to 250 and then 170 or\n160 from there seems like nothing so\nyeah that's crazy\nman so you I think so and you mentioned\nsomething about um you had some\nquestions about like stimulant\nmedication or\nsomething yeah basically or maybe even\nmore broadly like mind or maybe any type\nof I guess like enhancement medication I\nguess okay yeah talk to me about it\nlet's you you want to you want to hop in\nor you want to talk about other\nstuff um well tell me how you're doing\nreal quick I'm curious because I see you\npopping up we I don't know if you've\nnoticed this I think I Reet you we are\nwe have missed each other like two or\nthree times in incredibly random places\num I did a show with Charlie the guy\nfrom Charisma on command and I yeah I\nthink I was in his house like 4 hours\nafter you left I no idea I I remember\nyeah I remember that that Co yeah I I do\nthink we're like popping up in similar\nplaces um you know I I think uh I think\nI may be I'm yeah I'm going out to sfla\nand in Las Vegas probably in a couple of\nweeks to do things that I'm sure you're\nyou have done or will be doing or or\nsomehow affiliated with um but yeah we\ndo keep\non we're like ships passing in the night\nbut the cool thing is that we can you\nknow connect about\nstuff yeah um yeah so you're stuff is\ngoing good um you're are you happy with\nhow I guess where you guys are with all\nof your online stuff with the expansion\nof your platform and talking to other\npeople or how's that been how do you\nfeel like that's been going yeah so I\nthink it's been going well but but also\nit's like very confusing because um I'm\nnot quite sure what direction to go\nbecause we've got a lot of different\noptions uh and and just trying to figure\nout like what do people need and what's\nthe best way to deliver it um so we\nrecently started a a channel for par\num and and so like that's something that\nis a very different demographic but I\nwas kind of thinking about it like okay\nlike where do most of the problems in\nour community originate from I think it\noriginates from upbringing so if you\nwant to have the largest impact on\nMental Health um I think helping\npeople's upbringing in their sort of\nformative years as humans is probably\nlike the biggest thing that you can do\nand I think a lot of the problems that\nwe see today are because the world world\nthat parents are growing up in is\ndifferent and the parenting skills that\nthey have are no longer sufficient for\nlike the digital age so we're trying to\ndo something there we'll see how that\ngoes um but that's not the place that we\nget the most\ntraction um but you know I think just\nwhat you said there that's that's so\ninteresting because I like I grew up as\na probably more online than most but my\nI kind of had a foot in both worlds just\nbecause of my age right I'm 34 cell\nphones didn't really exist until like\n2007 with the iPhone everything before\nthen was like questionable um and even I\nhave like a really big difficulty with\nmy son like trying to set like what's an\nappropriate boundary how should he\ncommunicate with people online it's\nreally hard when children are\ncommunicating online because as an adult\nif somebody messages me like I know how\nto verify people's identities do you\nhave social media where do you post or\nwhatever but when Nathan is\ncommunicating with you know a\n12-year-old you know boy or girl\nverifying all of that or making sure you\nknow who's who is way more difficult and\nI I would expect that me being like the\npermanently online streamer like I'll be\nable to do this no problem but it's\nreally challenging out there and I am\nnot envious of the parents that have you\nknow almost no Tech background trying to\nsort through you know their child being\nin these new crazy online environments\nthat are so unprecedented they they have\nno you know experience with yeah yeah I\nmean exactly so so you know I think that\nit's just it's it's getting harder\nbecause technology I think is becoming\nmore invasive I think as platforms\ncompete against each other for our\nattention span\nthe one person that definitely ends up\nlosing our attention is ourselves right\nso if like Tik Tok and YouTube and and\ntwitch if everyone's competing for us\nInstagram and as they get better at\ncompeting against each other like the\none person who loses time is is\nus um and and so I I think that there's\njust a lot of work there to be done and\nwe'll see kind of how that\ngoes yeah yeah yeah I agree um okay well\nso let's let's talk about yeah so what's\ngoing on\nman so um I'll do I I I'll do from a\npersonal perspective first um and\nactually maybe even you can help me sort\nthis like personal thing I'm curious how\nyou how you decide this I have a really\nhard time in my life sorting out um what\nis like an\nappropriate uh like like where do you\ndraw lines on a spectrum for some things\nso for instance maybe for a relationship\nright like the best partner would be a\npartner that had all the same Hobbies\nsimilar communication Styles uh you know\nsimilar age like all these things but in\nthe real world we kind of have to like\nmake some um we make some compromises\nYou're Not Gon have like the most 100%\nperfect person or when it comes to like\nmy I think for my free time uh sometimes\nI look at the time that I have and I'm\nthinking like I could be do I always\nfeel like I could be doing so much more\nlike I'll wake up and maybe I you know\nI'm in bed on my phone for 30 minutes um\nmaybe I you know yeah it's usually it's\nlike Reddit or thank God I don't have\nTik Tok um maybe it's like sitting in my\nchair and like reading chat instead of\nlike going to the gym immediately like I\nlook at all of these little points in\nthe day where I'm losing time and I know\nyou know as like an online person\nthere's a million other things you can\ndo um what what do you think is like at\nwhat point do you draw an appropriate\nboundary where like you should be\npushing yourself 100% or 50% or 80% do\nyou have any like how would you even go\nabout figuring that out I guess yeah so\nI I would um I I would so personally uh\nnot personally but personally and\nprofessionally I think that the premise\nis flawed so so when you kind of said\nthat there's like this perfect partner\nwho has a c d like that's what how you\nfind the perfect relationship I don't\nthink that's actually what constitutes a\nperfect relationship so a perfect\nrelationship isn't about finding 100%\nit's about the interactions that you\nhave you don't need the same\ncommunication style you need investment\nin reciprocity as usually or some degree\nof balance right which you could say\nthat's the that that's what's on the\n100% but I think in in order to answer\nthis question of okay I could be doing\nso much more right like that's your\nquestion like how do you\ndecide how much to push\nyourself and how much to kind and and I\nwould start with like why do you need to\ndo\nmore um from a well from a from a\nsocially responsible point of view I\nfeel like I have I make a ton of money\nnow and have a ton of influence and the\nonly reason why I've gotten to where I'm\nat is because people that had the means\nto do so invested a lot in society prior\nto me whether you're talking about\nscientific researchers whether you're\ntalking about really inspirational\nteachers whether you're talking about\nrevolutionary Fighters George Washington\nwhoever like all of these figures have\ninvested in into kind of like mankind\nbecause of the gifts and talents and\nopportunities they've had and I feel\nlike I kind of owe it to pay it forward\nso on a societal level I feel like I\nthat obligation exists with everybody to\nsome extent um and then from a from a\npersonal development level I just see\nthat like let's say like let's say that\nI spend like an hour on Reddit every day\nright I think I could very easily cut\nout 30 minutes and like practice guitar\nand if I look at where I'm at one year\nlike retrospectively my life is a\nmillion times better I know that it's\nlike a way better like I could probably\nuninstall Reddit for my phone and my\nlife would probably be better for it you\nknow even if my day-to-day instant\ndopamine hits aren't there the\nFulfillment I'll feel at the end of the\nyear is just going to be better and I\nhave a hard time not like reductively\napplying that same thought process to\nevery single area of my life like I\nremember there was one week where well\nit was just now we'll get into the\nmedication thing want I so the\nstimulants where I would wake up at like\n9:00 a. and like my goal was to be like\non the treadmill in the gym at 9:05 okay\nI wanted to wake up like throw my pants\nand everything on grab my phone so I can\ncheck my emails but I'm only doing that\nlike on the treadmill and when I started\nto live days like this I'm like holy\n[ __ ] like I'll have like gym and like\ntwo errands done by like 11:30 a.m. and\nI'm like this is way better um but then\nobviously yeah I mean you can't burn\nyourself into the ground so I don't know\nlike what what is like the appropriate\nway to draw lines there or something\nthat's that's how I view it I guess\nsorry that was a long answer but yeah no\nI mean I I I think that think the\nappropriate way to draw lines has to do\nwith what's important to you right so so\nI think like once again I mean you you\nI'm all for being more efficient but and\nyou talk about these like big people\nright who have made big\ncontributions and I mean how much do you\nowe the\nworld um as much as you can give I I\nwould say I would think so\nbut\nwhy um I I feel like um the the way that\nlike Humanity kind of works the way that\npeople work is there is something about\nus that's greater than the sum of our\nparts like if you would use a really\ncrude calculation of like how much\nhappiness can one person produce maybe\nit's like 10 units but if you take two\npeople and you put them together\ntogether they might be able to make 300\nunits that Society civilization our\ninstitutions all of this Collective work\nkind of like Builds on itself to create\nsomething that's so much more than the\nsum of its parts and for in order for\nthat to work going forward I think it\nkind of requires people to uh you know\nlike rise to a calling or pursue certain\ngifts that they have in certain ways to\nI guess like better Society or the\npeople around them at least I would say\nokay how do you feel when you do two\nerrands and you go to the gym by\n11:30 you're really good obviously yeah\nreally good in what way like what part\nof you it\nfeels um what part of me my brain uh I\nmean if I feel I feel very productive\nlike I done something that I know is\ngood for me I've done something that I\nknow I had to do like workwise I've\nstill got a lot of time in the day I\njust feel like I'm very effectively\nallocating my time and that feels really\ngood like ineffectively allocating my\ntime feels really bad like so bad that\nit can ruin days yeah go ahead what\nfeels bad about\nit um man I don't know like if I I'm\nsure some people I'm sure people can uh\nVibe with this Vibe with this if you\nwake up at 9: and you're on your phone\nin bed until like 11:00 and then you get\nout of bed it just it feels like you\nwasted like there's two hours of my day\nthat I could have done bettering myself\nthe people around me financially there's\nlike a million better things I could\nhave done with my time but I did nothing\nand now that time is just wasted and it\nfeels if I say inefficient it sounds\nrobotic but um it just feels like\nthere's so many other better things yeah\nI do with my time I would just be like a\nbetter person how do you feel about\nyourself for wasting\ntime you bad stupid like dumb like I\nknow I'm smart enough to know that this\na stupid use of my time is sitting here\nlike on my [ __ ] phone like an idiot\nyeah that sounds me I mean but like they\ndo feel that way yeah\nyeah what do you think about\nthat uh disappointing I guess that I I\nknow I can do better so so so\nokay here's you wasting time okay here's\nyou reacting to you wasting time so this\nperson is disappointed what do you think\nabout this diad this interaction between\nyou and\nyourself um like the distance from my\ncognition to my metac cognition or is\nthat like what do you think about the\nrelationship between your cognition and\nyour metac cognition because there's a\nrelationship there right uhhuh um I mean\nsometimes the the tether is very short\nand sometimes it's very very far away um\nthis has been something that I've been\nstruggling with that kind of leads us\ninto into the um into the I guess like\nthe the ADHD and the medication talk so\nI've tried stimulants now for about two\nweeks after getting a diagnosis and I\nfeel like these two things have like\nbecome one basically do that to where as\nin like before I might wake up and it's\nlike I should get out of bed and what'll\nkind of check Reddit and I see what's\ngoing on it's already 30 minutes blah\nblah blah like that's kind of like how\nit's going I know I should probably get\nout of bed whereas now like if I um if\nI'm throughout the day if I need to do\nsomething it's like I need to do this\nand then I go and I do that because I\nknow I need to do it and it's like\nobvious like I need to do this let's go\ndo it um rather than like sitting down\nchecking my computer doing a bunch of\nother random stuff like I can think I\nneed to do something and then go do\nsomething so I feel like those two\nthings have have shrunk significantly\nokay but so so it it seems like you you\nwere further able to meet your\ngoals since you've started stimulant\nmedication yeah and okay so let's just\noffer just a couple of quick uh ground\nrules boundar\nsetting so I'm not going to dispense\nmedical advice and let's just be clear\non what that is so I think it's\ncompletely fine to have a conversation\nlike an existential or philosophical\nconversation\nabout performance enhancement stimulants\nwhat do we want to do in life\nEtc what usually medical advice around\nstimulants looks like involves a\nthorough diagnostic process right so\nI'll ask you a thousand questions that\nI'm not going to ask you today and then\nas well as like discussing different\ntreatment options the process of\ninformed consent um these are the things\nthat constitute the practice of medicine\nand developing a treatment plan so I'm\nhappy to share I've had these\nconversations with mentees of mind\nbecause people are wondering right like\nthis is a very common conversation to\nhave so I think it's totally fine but\njust so we're on the same page I'm not\ngoing to be diagnosing you or treating\nyou with anything or saying you should\nor should not take stimulants because in\norder for me to say that I have to know\nmedically diagnostic information are we\nclear on that yeah I'd make a joke but\nbeing very serious I 100% understand\nthat yeah yeah\nso I mean Destiny I I think\nuh okay so so you feel good about\nyourself after you have started taking\nstimulants because you're more\nproductive well hold on that was a much\nthat was a much larger statement I feel\ngood when I can do the things that I\nneed to do immediately um do I feel good\nabout myself in a broader sense I guess\nthat's kind of like the The Dilemma or\nthat was for a while that was like the\nissue yeah so what in what ways do you\nnot feel good about yourself right\nbecause you're so so you started\nsimulate medication so you could get\nmore stuff done and it it seems like you\nknow it it sounds like you you went\nthrough a very legitimate process of\nseeing a medical professional\nprofessional um you know AR get a\nreasonable diagnosis and a reasonable\nstimulant I mean treatment plan that\nincluded stimulants is that fair to say\nokay yeah so and why did you do\nthat um what was your\nmotivation yeah I want to say like I\nthink it was six years ago uh my son had\nmajor issues in the classroom um like\nsuch that we went through so many\ndifferent I think they're called IEP for\nclassrooms you have yeah um we had him\nlike crawling through resistance tunnels\nto burn energy we wondered if he had ASD\num we were trying to figure out like\nwhat was going on and eventually we kind\nof settled on um ADHD and then we tried\nto manage that a few ways and then I had\nto do a lot of reading about drugs\nbecause um I'm I won't say toxically\nmasculine but I grew up very\nconservative I've had like four ibpr for\nmy life I'm not like a pill guy at all\nand the idea of having my um Jesus what\nhe would have been like what seven-year\nold son like on you know uh you know\namphetamin is like Jesus I don't that's\nor methal or metha meth whatever the\nother one was called um that was a big\ndeal to me so I did a whole bunch of\nreading a whole bunch of research and in\nthe course of all of that reading and\nresearch because I kind of wanted to\nknow like is like I don't want to say I\ndidn't believe that ADHD was a real\nthing but I'm like a big again I grew up\nconservative I'm a big like you know if\nyou want to do it get it done you know\nit's all about you forget excuses or\nanything else um I started to see a\nwhole bunch of things prop up when I was\ndoing research that I didn't know were\nADHD typical behaviors and then when I\nwent back and I mapped them onto my life\nI saw that I had a lot of\nexceptional um so one thing was the the\nconcept of starting a project with a\nwhole bunch of focus pouring an inorder\namount of time into it and then never\nbeing able to pick up a project again I\ndidn't know that that was like typical\nof ADHD people um that's one thing um\nthe idea of not being able to manage\nhomework regardless of academic\nproficiency uh for I think three or four\nyears I think in grade school I was the\nonly kid in my class that had to have my\nassignment notebook signed off on by my\nteachers and my parents I couldn't do it\nI remember times growing up where I\nwould cry doing homework I just didn't\nwant to do it it was so horrible um I\nremember behaviors relating to oh the\naddictiveness that ADHD people have with\nregular dopamine scheduled things like\nvideo games um some people call this\nhyperfocus but basically if you can find\nsomething with a common reward system\nyou could do it 16 hours a day stuff\nlike that I was a pro Starcraft 2 player\nI I did that um\nyeah I started to see a bunch of these\nthings crop up and then I and and then\njust the general issue with executive\ndysfunction and a lot of these things I\ndidn't really associate with ADH I\nthought ADH was just like you're hyper\nand you're running around everywhere and\nthat wasn't me I sat at a computer and I\nplay computer games but fast forward\nfrom all of that I you know I had my son\nstarted the medication it's been really\ngood for him thankfully um now as as my\nfuture has continued there was a um I\nwould never advocate for anybody to do\nthis ever and I don't Advocate you know\nillegal drugs and blah blah blah but um\nI had the opportunity to try a stimulant\nmedication from a friend and you know\nthey made a joke they like oh yeah\nyou're going to take this you're going\nto be bouncing up and down the Walls\nit's going to be crazy blah blah blah\nand I was like okay [ __ ] it you know um\nand I tried to stimulate medication for\nthe first time in life I want to say I\nthink it was like about a year ago and\nit was the calmest chillest most focused\nrelaxed day I think I'd ever had in my\nlife and I was just super like I could\nchoose to do something I could whatever\nand then fast forward like seven or\neight months later I've had a lot of\nconversations with friends I finally get\na formal diagnosis and then I'm like\nokay okay well let's try medication and\nlet's see how my life changes and then\nif this is something I want for the\nbetter or not I guess sorry I was like\ntry to the reader digest version of that\nbut yeah that was that was fantastic\nthank you so much for sharing that um\nokay and and so what's what's your\nhangup so you started the medication it\nsounds like it allows you to do what you\nset it out to do so where's the\nrub yeah I guess the hangup is before I\nstarted it so I got the diagnosis and\nthen I got the prescription and then for\nlike seven days like my issue is always\nthat when it comes to issues of the mind\nI'm thinking like why not just be less\nof a lazy piece of [ __ ] that's what I\nfeel like so like when I get out of bed\nthere's not a guy there that's like\npunching me to stay in bed and to be\nlazy you know there's not a guy like\nholding a gun to my head saying read\nyour [ __ ] phone for three hours like\nI can just choose not to do it and there\nare days where if I have like\nexceptional you know mental tenacity and\nexceptional Focus like [ __ ] it I am\ngoing to do all this [ __ ] today I've\ndone it before but I I don't know why\ncan't do it every day so then it feels\nat some point like is this a copout to\nbe like I'm I'm neurodivergent I'm like\nexecutively stupid and I'm going to take\nlike a [ __ ] pill and I'm G to pop\nThis and like oh cool it fixed all my\nproblems like does that say something I\nguess about my character does that yeah\nwhen you say does that say something\nabout your character what do you\nthink uh I mean intuitively yeah what\ndoes it say about your\ncharacter uh that you need some sort of\nexogenous or external like physical\nmotivator to do something that you\nshould be able to do on your own this is\nsomething you should be able to motivate\nyourself for on your own and the fact\nthat you require something external\nespecially when it comes to\nneurotransmitters is like something is\nbroken with you and I don't even know if\nit's broken it's something you're not\nwilling to fix or not willing to put the\ntime or effort into fixing yeah\nokay and how do you feel about yourself\nfor not putting in the do do you do you\nthink it's theoretically possible for\nyou to achieve what you want without\nstimulants\num I think\nso the so um anytime I have dilemas like\nthis I solicit uh I asked my fans I'm\nlike what do you guys do I'm curious\nwhat your thoughts are so I got a lot of\nfeedback one thought that stuck with me\na lot is a person emailed me and they\nsaid you've been talking about like\novercoming your ADHD and all of this for\nlike five years basically ever since\nNathan was diagnosed and then you know\nlook back in your life in 5 years did\nyou do it it's like no not at all and\nit's like if I could have lived the last\nfive years of my life on stimulant even\nif I do take the hit to my moral\ncharacter because I'm not you know\nworking as hard on myself every single\nother part of my life improves tenfold\nI'd be healthier because I'd be going to\nthe gym more often um I would be\nprobably eating better I would be uh\nmore focused on my research for my\nstream so I'd be a better debator I'd be\na better advocate for my ideas I'd be\nmanaging extra time better for like\nHobbies or extracurriculars like\npracticing an instrument you know doing\nrock climbing whatever the [ __ ] that\neven if it was the case that at the end\nof those five years maybe my moral\ncharacter slightly diminished the games\nthat I would make in every other part of\nmy life would be so appreciable it\nwouldn't even matter I wouldn't even be\nthinking about\nthat so what's the\nproblem\num well I mean when I first messaged you\nI was like uh spiraling hard but now\nI've gone through a lot of emails and I\nthought about it a lot and I've kind of\num yeah I mean I thought about it more\nand I I I think I feel pretty good but\nit's it is a very weird feeling like\nstanding in line at a pharmacy or waking\nup and taking a Hill like that's just\nnot my the type of person I guess I've\never been in my entire life um can and I\nalso feel like a lot of other people\nyeah go yeah can I just think yeah oh go\nfor\nit\nokay got a question for\nyou what do you think is so what I'm\nhearing is that on paper stimulants are\na good idea for you yeah yeah and in\nactuality they may be a good idea for\nyou I'm hearing that you judge yourself\nquite heartly quite harshly for\nneeding them utilizing them taking the\nshortcut fair oh was it yeah yes I don't\nyeah that's\ntrue where do you think is the origin of\nthat\njudgment um there's the origin of that\njudgment is the origin of the Judgment\nlike are you asking like why I feel like\nI need them or I would judge myself for\ntaking them the\nladder the ladder um former is important\ntoo but let's start with the\nladder\nsure because I feel like\num maybe I need to go deeper you can\ntell me but like it feels like I'm\nshortcutting a process that I should be\nable to work through and where so that\nthere's a value there's a value judgment\ninherent in that right that taking the\nhard way is superior to taking the easy\nway that you should be able to do\nthis yeah should be able to do this\nbetter sure and then and then that\nshould is um it's a it's a comparison of\nwhat everybody else around me is like\nessentially that I I my understanding is\nmost people can decide to do something\nand do something and that's not a huge\nissue for a lot of these people whereas\nI seem to struggle with it sometimes\nexceptionally\nso I should be able to do it yeah most\npeople do yeah go and what I'm hearing\nfrom you is like okay so like between\nthis tension right so on the one hand\nyou can do\nit the hard way which is like meditate\nand do whatever else we can talk about\nthat in a second like you can kind of\novercome your ADHD as if it's an\nobstacle and there is data to suggest\nand I don't know if this is kind of what\nyou found but that you can do that right\nthere outcomes from things like\nPsychotherapy are equivalent to\nstimulant medication um we can talk\nabout that dat in a second but um okay\nand so there's a tension between kind of\ntaking this shortcut and then I almost\nhear you like making justifications to\nyourself right that like okay like\nobjectively if I do this so I've been\n[ __ ] around for 5 years now I'm kind\nof done objectively like I could have\ndone so much more now that I'm on it I\ncan accomplish so much more why do I\nneed to accomplish so much more because\nof this like complicated or maybe not\ncomplicated because of this\nmeaty worldview about like social good\nand paying it forward and and existing\nfor the benefit of humanity and all this\nkind of stuff right so there's like all\nthese like big\nreasons for stepen to take stimulant and\nthose big reasons fight against well I\nshould be able to do it without\nit and what I'm hearing you ask is how\ndo I find the balance between these two\nthings when is it a cop out when is it\nnot a cop out when is it the right move\nwhen is it the wrong move and so you're\nstuck between these two\nthings yeah from like a I guess from\nlike a um like a normative ethics point\nof view it's like there's like some\nvirtues that I think are worth aspiring\nto but then there's like some like\nconsequential attitudes that are\nundeniable so like for instance if I\ncould take a pill right now and have the\nideal Flawless perfect body composition\nblood levels and everything like I feel\nlike I shouldn't take that pill uh but\nat some point you do so much math where\nit's like well you know or you do so\nmuch utilitarian calculus you're like\nwell I probably should do this it would\nmake sense not to like I almost wonder\nif I got diagnosed as like a type one or\ntype two diabetic would I think that\nlike well do I really need insulin or\ncan I just do like a keto diet and never\neat anything on the glycemic index it's\nabove like a 10 ever and I'll be okay\nyeah it's that kind of thing I guess\nokay it's balancing out like that that\nthat virtue with the yeah I guess with\nthe consequentialist idea whatever yeah\nuh and do you prefer if I call you Steve\nSteven Destiny what do you prefer\nSteven's good okay so Steven I I I think\nI know sounds kind of weird but I mean\nyou're asking me what my opinion is so\nI'm going to say I think you're\napproaching it wrong so I think the real\nanswer to this is not so so it's not\ngoing to work basically so you have\nyou're kind of fighting like an\nintellectual I'm going to call it\nintellectual it's not quite intellectual\nbut you're fighting a battle and trying\nto figure out what the right answer is I\ndon't think that's what works well I\nthink what works really well is\nis understanding your relationship with\nyourself understanding the origins of\nthe different pieces and then even\nresolving some of the fuel behind your\nbeliefs so you can have two beliefs that\ncan but heads and then you can logically\ntry to decide which one is right but\nwhat I find is far far far more\neffective and this is like more of a\npersonal value system is to understand\nlike the way that you relate to things\nmhm so so I'm I'm going to just toss out\na couple of things okay the first is\nthere's this interesting concept which I\nloved learning about and love teaching\nabout even though I'm not very good at\nit is the\npsychodynamics of\npsychopharmacology so the psychodynamics\nis kind of like the like psycho dnamic\nPsychotherapy is like sort of based on\npsychoanalysis so it kind of has this\nidea that like we have all these like\nassociations and meanings and\ninterpretations and the way that we\nrelate to different stimuli in our\nenvironment we can dig into that and\nthere's like a whole way to understand\nokay like my mom didn't hug me and what\ndoes that mean to me and how does that\nhave a subconscious impact all that crap\nthat we sort of think of is like\nFreudian psychoanalysis all that sort of\nstuff is like the way that we relate to\nthings there is a whole Rich exploration\nof the way that we relate to taking a\npill so I think this I don't know if\nyou're you're doing psychotherapy but I\nthink sort of like doing Psychotherapy\naround this can be very helpful for\npeople with ADHD like what does it mean\nto you to take a medication because the\nanswer is not should you take one\nobjectively or not objectively that's\npart of your treatment plan and you and\nyour provider will decide based on\nevidence-based outcomes and all that\nkind of stuff but like what does it mean\nto you to take this pill that's a very\nimportant exploration and I think that's\nultimately what's going to fix the\nproblem it's not like the the cookie can\ncrumble either way right because you can\nmake a good logical argument either way\nso it's not like there is a right answer\nor a wrong answer both of them are\njustifiable\ncourses the real issue the real rub the\nthe tension that I'm I'm seeing in you\nand the struggle that I'm seeing you has\nnothing to do with the right answer or\nthe wrong answer it has to do if you\nreally want to fix that you have to\nunderstand your relationship to the\nthing now this is where things get you\nwith me so far yeah this is where things\nget interesting so let's just talk a\nlittle bit about outcomes stimulants and\nall that kind of stuff so it sounds like\nyou did a lot of research on your kid or\nnot your kid but kids with ADHD and what\ndid you\ndiscover um well now I'm a little bit\nworried because maybe I was looking at\nthe wrong stuff for most of the I was\ngoing to say for most of the ADHD stuff\nI had a really hard time finding um\nmeditation or other sorts of\ninterventions in larger studies showing\nto have positive outcomes um similar to\nmedication the only reason why I finally\nbroke down and got the diagnosis for\nADHD is because it felt like uh\nstimulant based medication was like some\nof the only stuff that showed really\ngood outcomes related to people that\nwere like super into the ADHD thing but\nI I might have missed out somehow I\nmight have yeah\nno don't yeah uh okay we're going to get\ninto the phrase broke down in a second\nbut um so so so let's just understand a\ncouple things about stimulant medication\nokay a lot of people don't realize this\nso the first thing is that if you give a\nchild a stimulant it has very very good\noutcomes generally speaking for adults\nso this is what's really kind of\nconfusing so let's just illustrate with\none example so some people think that\nsince stimulants are\nabusable that and we also know that\nexposing developing brains to substances\nof\nabuse will increase the risk of\naddiction as they develop so when I have\nmy nucleus accumbens and my dopamine\nreward circuitry that is developing and\nI give it highly dopaminergic stuff it\nwires in a different way to where I'm\nsensitive to substances in the future so\nwe actually have decent evidence that\nmarijuana is actually a gateway drug\nlike that is not it's not some\npropaganda or anything I mean there may\nbe propaganda around it but basically we\nknow that if you start using marijuana\nin your teenage years you are more\nlikely to develop a neurochemistry that\nis sensitive to other dopaminergic or\naddictive\nsubstances okay so people were worried\nright because we've got this pile of\nevidence and if you give a\nseven-year-old oh my God an\namphetamine that is dopaminergic will it\nincrease his risk risk of of addiction\nthe answer is almost certainly not and\nthis confuses the hell out of all kinds\nof people because we were like wait a\nsecond because this stuff is highly dope\nand energic what we actually find is\nwhen you give a child with ADHD a\nstimulant their risk of addiction goes\ndown over the course of their\nlife now that's really because of a\nchange of behavior or great question so\nthe answer is complicated the first\nthing is to understand what a stimulant\ndoes okay mhm so a stimulant medication\nworks on the frontal loes of our brain\nso the part of our brain that it\nactually stimulates is our the breakes\nso the ability of our brain to restrain\nother parts of our brain so if we look\nat what predisposes people to addiction\nit's things like emotional disregulation\nimpulsivity these are both big risk\nfactors for addiction so when you\nstrengthen the brain and you are no\nlonger as impulsive and you can regulate\nyour emotions you become less vulnerable\nto the benefit of\nsubstances does that make sense yeah\nthis was in a in a kind of a roundabout\nway um for some of the I'll stay on this\ntopic in particular one of the emails\nthat I got was uh it was an interesting\nquestion of like what do you think\ndamages your brain more in the long run\nhaving these you know amphetamines that\nare causing these dopic effects in your\nbrain dopa dopa wait say that word again\ndopaminergic dopaminergic effects in\nyour brain do you think that hurts your\nbrain more than playing video games and\nwatching porn for 18 hours a day for\nyears and years and years um and if one\namphetamine can help you not engage in\nall of that other horrible Behavior it\nmight be the case that the your brain\nputting the breakes on some forms of\nlike dopamine seeking Behavior do is\nactually more beneficial in the long run\nfor Addictive Behavior than you know\nyeah which seems paradoxical but yeah\nyeah so so I I think the the the spirit\nis spot on but I think there are a\ncouple of important nuances specifically\nwith the the general principle is true\nand that'll apply to everything else I'm\nabout to say but specifically with the\ncase of stimulants there's some parts of\nour brain that are vulnerable to\naddiction and what the stimulant\nmedication does is buffer those parts of\nthe brain right so like and this is what\nand now we get to the so the first thing\nis that it's interesting because\nbasically several Studies have shown\nthat there is certainly not a increased\nrisk of addiction with stimulants the\njury still out on whether there is a no\nrisk or it's like neutral or it's\nbeneficial and there's complicated\nthings that get into that which we're\ngoing to get into in a second but the\nkey thing to understand is that's number\none here's the other big big big big big\nthing about stimulant medication in kids\nnow I think so this is going to sound\nkind of weird I think that stimulant\nmedication for kids is not\nneurodevelopmentally good or healthy\nokay this is going to sound kind of\nweird because if we just look at\ndeveloping brains we basically know that\nany kind of psychoactive\nsubstance does not really help like it\ndoesn't help the developing brain that's\njust something that we know whether it's\ncaffeine whether it's nicotine alcohol\nopiates whatever whatever so then but if\nwe look at outcomes of kids with ADHD\nwho get medicated the outcomes are good\nand in fact there are studies that show\nthat early use of ADHD medication with\nhigher doses leads to better outcomes as\nan\nadult okay like we're talking like\nseven8 years we can look at a population\nof like 12 to 15 year olds and then look\nat them 8 years later and basically like\npeople who got a lot of stimulants early\non did better there's some confounding\nfactors there because those people may\nhave had a more severe illness and other\nthings like that but I think this is\nwhere a lot of people misunderstand one\nkey point which I think could be\nrelevant to\nyou so I'm going to which is that\ngrowing up with untreated ADHD is\ntraumatic so if you look at\npopulations of people who have\ndepression and ADHD\nokay and then you ask if you got\ndiagnosed with depression first what is\nthe likelihood that you will get\ndiagnosed with ADHD later it is\n3% if you get ID diagnosed with ADHD\nfirst what is the likelihood you get\ndiagnosed with depression later in life\n70% there is a very clear positive\nimpact and this is by the way what we\nsee with you right so you're like like\nyou beat yourself up and all this self-\njudgment of and we come down to it's\nit's comparison like where does that\nthought come from it's because when you\nwere in second grade you understood that\nyour IQ was the same as everybody else's\nbut for the life of you you could just\nnot understand why you could never do\nhomework I mean if you think about even\nwhat you've said the memories that you\nhave are so profound because you recall\nthem to this day you were the only\n[ __ ] kid in the class who had to have\nyour homework get signed off by your\nparents and your teacher and so what\nhappens to that child the child starts\njudging themselves very harshly why are\nyou so stupid why can't you do what\nother people can do this is a sign of\nyour weakness you have this fundamental\nBrokenness very common yeah this was the\nwhen I was doing research for Nathan\nthis was the thing that ultimately\npushed me over on to do the drugs I feel\nlike my obligation as a parent is to\nmake sure that his like growing years\nand everything in grade school are\nbecause he's already in a split parent\nhousehold which has a whole bunch of\nnegative things associated with it so I\ncould tell him you know go to school\nfight through this and do that but then\nto do that on top of everything else I\ndon't want to be in a situation my kid\nis like 18 you know he either doesn't\nqualify for college or he sucks at high\nschool he's like Dad why the [ __ ] didn't\nyou just give me like simulant when I\nwas in second grade and then we could\ndeal with whatever negative things but\nnow you've like ruined my whole life\nbecause of some weird feeling that you\nhad about medications so yeah that was\ndefinitely the thing that that pushed me\nin that direction yeah yeah I and and so\nlike I think the key thing that you've\ngot to understand is when when I see\nthis conflict I don't see actually like\nan intellectual conflict I see like an\nemotional self-judgment fueled\nconflict uhuh and I think the solution\nto this is not like is it good or is it\nbad it's to actually heal whatever the\nhurt is that you had with growing up\nwith undiagnosed ADHD and what that's\nmeant for your life cuz like that that's\nthe thing and even the way that you\ninter the way that you talk about your\nchild's regrets are like your\nregrets yeah of course yeah right so\nlike I mean it's it's like one to one\nbecause what what caused you to change\nyour mind you were like well someone\nsaid 5 years ago if you had started\nwhere would you have been now so now we\nget to another problem which is\nregret and this is where like now if we\nreally want to go off the rails like\nI've seen this a lot like why are you\ntrying so hard I I I mean sure you can\nconstruct this whatever social goodness\nkind of stuff and like that's good stuff\nI'm not saying it isn't you know I I do\nthat stuff too for social good and all\nthat jazz but I think that there's a\nfuel here that is has nothing to do with\nthe social good the fuel has to let me\nknow if I'm wrong here but I I think\nlike this regret in the sense of I get\nthis pressure from you about\ntime like Stephen Are You Afraid Of\nDeath I mean sometimes when I'm driving\nbut um uh no not I don't think not in\ngeneral no I don't think so do you feel\nlike you've regretted or Wast a part of\nyour\nlife I think\num I'm trying to think um usually what\nI'll do just as a quick thing I'll have\nlike a feeling and then I try to\nintellectualize it and then I try to\nslowly um if I can think about a thing a\nlittle bit differently the feeling\nchanges over time essentially like a\nbastardized version of CBT I guess but\num the way that I try to view my life is\nas long as I feel like I'm on a good\nroad and I feel like I'm happy with\nmyself right now and and the road that\nI'm heading on I try to view my life\nwith having no regrets because any\nparticular bad thing that might have\nhappened might have been a contributing\nfactor to who I am now so I view it all\nlike pretty favorably so I might have\nhad like things that were I'll say\nsuboptimal um relating to upbringing or\nearlier in my life but like I view it as\nall kind of like these are all part of\nthe Stepping Stones to who I am now and\nwhere I'm going and I feel really good\nabout those two things who I am and\nwhere I'm going so yeah so that is both\nreally good and really\nproblematic okay so I think it's very\nvery adaptive and it's exactly what you\nshould be doing right you've positively\ncognitively reframed and all that stuff\nyou bastardized internal version of CBT\ncall it whatever you want to but you're\nessentially taking your intellect and\nyou're molding your emotions with it but\nI think there is more to be gained from\nunderstanding where those emotions come\nfrom in the first place so from an\nAdaptive standpoint or functional\nstandpoint makes perfect sense that what\nyou want to do is like those emotions\nare negative let's cognitively reframe\nadapt\ngrow work with this negative regret try\nto get this get rid of this negative\nregret but I think the next step and\nthis is kind of where I see you and this\nis why I think you're running into\ntrouble because I think your tactic\nwon't work for these problems is my\nsense so like like you can logic your\nway to a functional life where you get\nup every day you're optimizing things\nyou're progressing you're doing well\nright and and this is where like when\nI've worked with people in the past I I\ndon't think this is a problem I mean\nthere maybe psychological problems\nrelated to trauma of growing up with\nADHD but that's between you and your\nprovider and your therapist and all that\ngood stuff we can talk a little bit more\nabout what that looks like in\nnon-pharmacological approaches if you\nwant to but I I mean I I think this this\nsounds to me like a spiritual crisis\nmore than anything else like that's what\nit feels like and and these are these\nare like bigger deeper questions of sure\nyou can justify which is what you always\nend up doing right there like you can\njustify this as okay like this was part\nof my path and it's made me who I am and\nlike I'm doing okay in life so like I\nshould not regret the past but what I\ndon't actually hear you doing is\nmetabolizing the regret I don't hear you\ngetting to the source of that and trying\nto figure out like like and I think\nthere's like a tear Above This which\nis there may be some problems to me\nsaying that but which is like\nunderstanding that you do regret and\nthat it is okay to regret and that you\ncan still be happy with what you've\naccomplished but I think that's like\nvery hard for you because of like that\nself- Judgment of of you know I should\nhave been perfect well I I I I I\nunderstand what you're saying um the\nspiritual crisis was definitely like\nprobably a year and a half ago I think\nis when I was trying to think of like do\nI want to just sit online and kind of\nyou know move sideways do decently or do\nI want to be more aggressive with my\ncareer and then that's when I kind of\nthought more about like obligations to\nsociety and all that and I feel like I\nmean I'll say that was spiritually\nsolved but obviously there's still other\nissues that I'm trying to figure out\nlike medication right um and that was\nwhy in the past year and a half of my\ncareer I've been way more aggressive in\nterms of doing other things um I do\nagree with you about what you're saying\num you call it metabolizing your regret\nbut um I'm just I'm trying to say in\nother words what you're saying so we can\nmake sure I understand um I think\nthere's a negative thing that people\nwill do where uh say you have an abusive\nparent where somebody will say something\nlike you know actually that abuse was\ngood for me and my life is so much\nbetter because of it and in a way that\nmight be better than walking through\nlife being completely traumatized by it\nbut like the next would be saying well\nactually that abuse was really bad for\nme but I understand that I've made peace\nwith it and then I've overcome it and\nI'm moving in a forward Direction I yeah\nI feel like for the most part like there\nthere are definitely things in my life\nwhen I when I say I have no regret I\nguess we could dig a little bit more\nmeteor into that um obviously there are\nthings that have not gone as I would\nhave liked it and there are things that\nkind of suck in terms of my upbringing\nbut like I made peace with those things\nI don't think that they I don't let them\ndrag me down um obviously if I could\nhave chosen different types of things in\nmy upbringing I would absolutely like\nchange the way that some things are but\nI think everything's going okay now so I\ndon't let those like weigh on me I guess\nyou know it's not like I've yeah yeah so\nso you know I like even in your language\nI think there's like and this is what I\nthink is really where there's\nopportunity for progress is like\nactually has nothing to do with whether\nyou should take stimulant medication or\nnot this is l a fantastic opportunity\nfor you to understand the different\ncurrents within yourself right so what I\nget the sense that that you're focused\non is when you have conflicting currents\nyou have a pretty rigorous process of\nlike getting all the troops in line\nright so like you'll and that's good I\nmean you're good at that you're gifted\nat that it's a useful thing to do it's\nadaptive it's cognitive reframing it's\nwhat we try to do in CBT but there's\nlike you're spot on that there's another\nlayer of this which is which is to ask\nyourself like why do I feel this way in\nthe first place right why like what is\nthe origin of this judgment because\nimagine if you could get rid of the\nJudgment entirely not get it in line but\nyou could understand that and this is\nwhat I think happens is you can\ncognitively reframe but basically if you\nlook at sort of this yogic model of the\nMind what happens is when we have\nnegative emotional experiences those\nemotions get stored up and they sit in\nour subconscious mind or our unconscious\nmind as something called a sscar and\nthat those emotions will trigger and\nactivate in current\ncircumstances and so in a situation like\nyours what I'm what I'm hearing is an\nof the comparisons that you used to make\nin this idea that you should be able to\ndo what other people are able to do that\nis like a core part in CBT we may call\nit something like a core belief right\nand so as long as you have that piece\nyou really need to understand like why\ndo I think that way about myself because\nif you sort of think about it like\nlogically right I mean everyone's unique\neveryone and I know you do this process\nthis is the part that you're good at\nright everyone's unique like you can't\nalways make comparisons and everyone has\nadvantages and disadvantages we get a\ncertain amount of stat points to\ndistribute on our character sheet and\nthat's how it is I took the ADHD thing\nfor an additional feat at level one and\nthat's just how it works and I got\ndebating proficiency whatever right so\nthere's there's whatever breakdown that\nyou have which you can kind of logically\nunderstand but I think now the question\nis like you know why do you feel this\nway about yourself why is your worldview\nsuch that like you should be able to do\nit without\nit right and that I think will go back\nthat I think will go back to like if you\nreally pay attention to your early\nexperiences in childhood which by the\nway is another thing that I just\nconnected the dots on I was really\nconfused the first time we talked\nbecause you play games while you're\ndebating with people right well I\nhaven't for the past two weeks while\nI've been on amphetamines but yeah I\nunderstand what you're saying I used to\na lot yeah yeah so I think that that is\nnot a coincidence that you've stopped so\nthere's a good evidence that no I don't\nthink yeah not at all there's good\nevidence that doing a cognitively\ndistracting rot task allows people with\nADHD to focus so when I'm doing group\nPsychotherapy with people with ADHD I\nwill often times what what I learned at\none of the the hospitals I worked at is\nknitting that if they do some kind of\nroot or even cognitively mildly engaging\ntask they it actually helps them Focus\nbecause they have like too much kind of\nmental energy and like dispersing some\nof it allows them to actually Focus this\nis also why people with ADHD sometimes\nmeditate better with their eyes\nopen okay\nso you need some kind of stimulation\nwhich is something that's interesting\nand also if you stop started stimulant\nmedication it would make sense that you\ntracks yeah yeah um so where are you\nright now what are you what are you\nthinking thoughts\nquestions\num I'm I'm I'm writing down like big\nConcepts I guess to keep track of the\nfirst question of like what does it mean\nto take a pill I think that's a good I\nthink there's a lot of room for me to\nthink about and explore how I feel about\nthat CU all of my feelings related to\nthat are negative and most of them are I\nthink really stupid they're rooted in\nstupid things like I know that looking\non it intellectually um and then the\num why did I write this down I WR you\ntalking I wrote judgment in big caps oh\nwhy do I judge myself I guess or against\nlike what standard do I judge myself um\nI mean I feel like judgment is probably\na necessary part of or you were G to say\nyeah I think you're you're you're okay\nso let's talk about pills for a second\nso why do people have stupid beliefs\nStephen um for all sorts of different\nreasons um I mean they could be\nmaladaptive um it could be uh they learn\nlike why do people develop stupid like\nso you said okay I have all kinds of\nattitudes towards medication that are\nstupid then why do you have that\nattitude where does that attitude come\nfrom uh it's probably an inherited\nbelief that's largely unexamined because\nit doesn't come up much in daily life\nbasically yeah okay so I think that's\none way to put it I would chalk it up to\nan experience which could be an inher\nwhat you call an inherited belief I\nthink could be an experience my dad and\nmy grandpa were like I don't believe in\nmedicine I don't care about this and\nthen now I'm like if I get a headache I\ndon't like to take ibpr or adva which is\nstupid but it doesn't come up that much\nso I don't examine it that much yeah\nyeah so I mean I I don't I I don't think\nit's an inherited belief I think it's a\nlearning is what I would call it so even\noh sure when I say inherited I mean like\nyou learn it but you're right yeah learn\nso you had you had some experience early\non in life where like you like maybe you\nwere sick and like the doctor\nrecommended that you take I proen and\nyou were really hurting and you were\nlike Dad should I take the ibuprofen\nhe's like ibuprofen is for sissies you\ndon't take Ibuprofen and then you felt\nguilty or bad because you really wanted\nit and the doctor said but you didn't\nwant to be weak right and then like that\nwhole thing starts I mean I have no idea\nif that's actually what happened but\nthat's an example so I think one thing\nto understand anytime you examine your\nstupid beliefs is you can do the\ncognitive reframing stuff but I have\nfound it to be very very\nhelpful to understand understand the\norigins of your experience and why that\nbecame a truth for you and how that\nbecame a truth for you because at some\npoint it was a it was learned that's why\nyou believe it right um second thing\nabout judgment\nis I think exploring the origins of your\nself- judgment are very\nimportant and so if you really want to\nbecause right now what's happening is\nyou have a clash between like a\nself-judgment and a\nlogic right\nokay can we let me can I give you my\nidea about judgment first so we're AR\nusing the same words yeah um so I feel\nlike judgment is a necessary part of\nyour self analysis because it allows you\nto more closely align yourself with\nwhatever your idealized version with\nyourself is so for instance let's say\nthat I think I should be somebody that\nis truthful to my friends around me and\nthen let's say that in the past I lied\nor I lied to somebody then I would want\nto judge myself as failing to meet those\ntypes of expectations that would have\nfor a more idealized version of myself\nthat would be what I would consider like\na judgment not necessarily like yeah\ncoming but I just want to make sure\nwe're using the word in the same way so\nyeah you can tell me that yeah yeah but\nI mean so so I think the problem is that\nthe the direction of the judgment and\nthe idealized what the target is it can\nbe based on bad stuff okay right so\nyou're right that judgment is a\nself-correcting we have this part of our\nbrain that does something called\ncounterfactual thinking which is and\nit's kind of a weird term but when we\nmake a mistake there is a factual\nrepresentation of what happened and we\nhave a part of our brain that thinks in\na counterfactual way so you could think\nabout it as hypothetical but our brain\ngoes back and rewrites history outside\nof the facts and that is one of the ways\nthat we learn from our mistakes and\ncorrect our Behavior so you're right\nthat I think judgment is uh it's a\njudgment that you place that has the\ndirection towards an ideal self but the\nproblem is that that idealize self and\nthat judgment can come from unhealthy\nplaces to begin with so what I'm say I\nagree that's what needs to be\nexamined right and that's then I guess\nthe question would be like is the ideal\nthat you're aspiring to unhealthy to\nsome extent I feel like that's what the\nyeah okay yeah yeah and then and then\nthen we get to the the big big problem\nof like I think like so I think you've\ncome up with a very intellectually sound\ndhic ethical utilitarian approach to\nwhat you want to do with your\nlife but that's all coming from up here\nand what I'm really hearing you need to\ndo is integrate that with like the other\nparts of your\nmind yeah of course right because I\nthink that's where you're going to find\nyour balance because right now there's a\nconflict which means that one side is\ngoing to win and one side is going to\nlose or well ideally one side is\nintegrated into the other if there's if\nyou run into a huge in congruence with\nthe the mind and the feeling at some\npoint you have to examine why and then\nbring one of them into alignment with\nthe other at some point right yeah so I\nthink in that integration process one\npiece is going to\nlose\nokay I disagree or let's talk about that\nactually yeah because I feel like I\ndon't agree with that 100% um I'll give\nan example then you can talk me through\nwhy you think that I'm curious um so\nlet's say that um let's say that I feel\nlike uh I\num shoot I don't want to use like well\nno we'll say negative thing okay\num let's say that I want to play video\ngames for 16 hours a day but like\nintellectually I know that it's probably\nnot healthy to play video games for 16\nhours a day but I really like playing\nvideo games so at some point um I ration\nthis out to like well I think playing\nlike one or two hours a day maybe that's\nhealthy like I would view that as a sort\nof compromise where I don't know if I\nwould say one side is lost or not but\nmaybe you would frame it as like one\nside is lost like the emotional side of\nwanting to play for yeah go ahead\nabsolutely right because one side of you\nwants to play for 16 hours a day MH like\nif we maybe the intellectual side wants\nto play for like zero hours a day like\ndon't play video games at all compromise\nanytime you integrate or compromise both\nsides lose right okay that's how you\nokay sure okay gotcha right so so my\npoint is that there there's a different\nway and I think it's fine what you've\ndone is awesome like I'm not trying to\nyou know I think like the higher you\nclimb on the MMR scale the harder things\nget and the more subtle they become okay\nso I I think there's there's another way\nto go about this which is to metabolize\nthe root of why do I want to play 16\nhours a day in the first place it's not\nabout reconciling two parts it's about\ngetting to the source of like what is 16\nhours a day mean to me what's important\nabout\nthis okay and then as you get down that\nroad something cool happens which is\nthat the desire kind of melts away and\nthen you're sort of left without either\nside and then you're kind of like you\ncan just sort of make a choice and\nyou're not being like driven by these\ntwo different\nthings sure can you um expand on that\nwhen you say the desire melts away like\ncan you think your way through wanting\nto ever play video games yeah what do\nyou mean by that can you expand on that\ntheoretically you can think your way\nthrough that um there is a there is a\nsubset of the practice of yoga I'm not\ntalking about the postures I mean like\nthe traditional meaning of the word yoga\nwhich is like paths to enlightenment\ncalled Nani yoga which is the yoga of\nknowledge so one major text of that is\nthis text called the Brahma Sutra which\nis like a text that talks about logical\nargument so it it talks it's like a text\non argument basically but there are\ntheoretically it is possible it it's\nmore it's not logic it's more\ncontemplation and then like if you kind\nof think about uh so so theoretically\nmaybe it's possible it's something that\nI when I was learning I was taught that\nthis is the hardest path of yoga of\nwhich there are very very few true yogis\nwho like really know how to do this\nanymore um because it's not logic it\nit's contemplation but the other way\nthat I would think about it is um so\nfirst of all does that answer your\nquestion or or what was your\nquestion um what do you mean when you\ntalk about like the dissolution of\nDesire I guess I I kind of thought it\nwas going to be I didn't know if there\nwas like a oh well when you just do this\nbut I've heard of like the the far more\ncomplicated ones right yeah go but but\nbut yeah but there is absolutely a\ndissolution of Desire so like this this\nis where things get kind of cool which\nis like the more that you explore the\norigin of whatever your desires are the\nmore you will discover that there is\nnothing at the\nbottom okay right so we we assume that\nthe things that we want are like real\nbut like once you realize the origin of\nthe want you realize that oh this is\nlike not a real thing it's just so like\njust to give you a simple\nexample um let's say I want to play a\nparticular video game so I've been on\nthe fence about buying Starfield because\nokay I don't know right and so if I\nreally look at okay do I want to buy the\ngame do I not want to buy the game I\ndraw a logical argument about reasons to\nbuy Starfield reasons to not buy\nStarfield and I can go back and forth\nbut the real antidote to that is like\nwhy do I want Starfield in the first\nplace what am I looking for and the more\nand more I go into myself the more I\nrealize okay like what is the origin of\nmy desire for Starfield I saw an ad\nabout it what is the origin of my desire\nI saw people talking about it what is\nthe origin of my desire oh like I I\nenjoyed playing morrowwind and Oblivion\nso much that I long for that experience\nagain and then as I sit down and I\nengage in some degree of like reflection\nand contemplation okay so like I've had\nthings that I enjoyed in the past do I\nwant to hold on to that I don't need to\nthat was I can just appreciate that\nexist that that for what it is and it's\nkind of weird but like the end of that\nprocess there's just nothing there is\nthere is it necessarily good to dissolve\nall of your desires I don't know for how\nBuddhists we getting but like the the\nthe counter claim I'm going to say is\nlike what if you have a desire to be\nlike a good father or a good parent like\nyou want to drill down and yeah it\ndepends on what your goal is so when you\nsay good how what how are you defining\nthat end\nzone good um normatively morally like it\nsounds like dissolving a desire to\npartake in a vice is tautologically good\nbecause vices are bad and if you can\ndissolve your desire to have a vice\nyou've something good right we move away\nfrom Vice and towards virtue um that's\nwhat I'm thinking good you've made\nyourself a better person improved your\ncharacter I guess so I'm going to say so\ncouple things the first is that there\nare there's a subset of of spiritual\npractitioners called agori Babas Gore\nmeans fear aore means lack of fear so\nthese are people who intentionally\nengage in Vice likee behavior is part of\ntheir spiritual\nprogression now okay in this case Vice\nlikee Behavior includes marijuana eating\nof meat even cannibalism in some cases\num and and they actually intentionally\nexpose themselves to negative things to\ntry to transcend this like tological\nidea of like good and bad okay so they\nthey they drink alcohol and get high and\neat fish and meat and sleep in\ncemeteries and and stuff like so there\nthere's a spiritual path that kind of\ndoes that but then the goal there is\nthat this this idea that this tautology\nbetween good and bad is actually like a\nhuman construction and that it's it's\nnot a real thing that there that it's\nkind of this non non-dualism which is\nlike a philosophical view that most of\nthe yoga practitioners kind of take it's\nthe dominant school that has emerged\nhistorically okay so\nso first thing is that there's a\nperspective that to topologically good\nand bad is not a real thing and it's\njust these are judgments that we make\nright and we know that good and bad\nchanges over time because people used to\nthink something is good now they think\nit's bad so what's really good or bad\nsecond thing is from a more practical\nperspective I think that for 99% of\npeople moving on this path will improve\ntheir life in a significant\nway but if you really look at the\nPrecision of\nit abandoning desire makes you not a\ngood citizen in the world of life so if\nyour goal is to break free of the cycle\nof suffering and to become enlightened\nand Achieve whatever your highest human\npotential is which can be viewed as\nvirtuous and there's a whole fun angle\nthere right so like but as you become\nmore and more enlightened like you don't\nbehave the way that a normal person will\ngenerally speaking I think that like I\nsaid for 99% of the times that's good\nbut let's remember that like when Buddha\nstarted his journey on his Enlightenment\nand also became enlightened he he basic\nphysically abandoned his wife and child\nand Kingdom and pursued something\nelse I think most people don't get there\nbut technically if you want to really\nget get to it like you could say okay\nthere yogis in the Himalayas who have\nbeen meditating in caves for 40 years\nwhat good are they doing in the\nworld who\nknows okay that's my answer I don't know\nif that answers your\nquestion um what was this originally\nabout what it means to dissolve your\ndesires okay it was okay right so so I I\nI think it will lead to less suffering\nbut the interesting thing the reason\npeople get scared about it is because as\nwe dissolve our desires we also lose\nsome things that give us a compass in\nlife like\nambition sure I think I probably would\nagree with that that like people people\nreframe a lot lot of things negatively\nthat are probably actually important\nparts of society so for instance like um\nfeeling negative when your peers judge\nyou or feeling competitive or a pressure\nto do something socially is probably an\nimportant part of the human experience\nin terms of like building societies\nbecause we want to feel like we can\npressure people to act in certain ways\nstuff like that right oh yeah I mean\nabsolutely I think one of the biggest\nmistakes we make in our society is that\nassuming that negative emotions are bad\nlike there's a reason why every human\nbeing feels anger feels shame fears\nguilt feels\nguilt um\nand and it's it's fascinating because as\npeople move away from their negative\nemotions that's actually when they get\nstuck because if if you kind of think\nabout it like um I did a YouTube video\nabout this but it's a fascinating\nconcept that like everyone avoids shame\nbut shame is the most powerful\ncorrective motivating force in you as a\nhuman being and so when you start\nsuppressing shame you you literally\nneuroscientifically lose out on the\nability to learn from mistakes and adapt\nto\ncircumstances yeah I agree there's a\nquote that I had when I was a Starcraft\n2 player 13 years ago but the quote was\nlike to achieve Perfection is to\nsacrifice growth and the idea is that\nlike if you don't feel an impetus to\nchange or to improve or do something\nthen you've essentially like cut\nyourself off from any yeah motivating\nforces to actually change or be better\nso yeah I think I would agree with that\nso the interesting thing is that as you\ndissolve more desires you become more\nfree and you can end up choosing to act\ncompassionately which is usually what\nhappens\nthat's\ngood so I I think getting rid of\nambition is only scary until you\ndiscover that there are other compasses\nand most people want the compass instead\nof ambition because ambition is like\nRelentless and it kind of drives you as\nopposed to you controlling\nit and and the\nfreedom yeah not the freedom to choose\nis liberating and often times when\npeople are truly free to choose they\nmake the right choices\nokay my second monitor is here so I'm\nlooking at you but it looks like I'm not\nlooking at you just so you know the\nyou're right there yeah yeah\num okay did you want to walk down this\nroad anymore do you want to move to\nanother area or well I did I answer your\nquestion\num something that would this is very\ndifficult for me um I think something\nthat would help push me along a little\nbit it's very hard for me to find Role\nModels since my job and everything I do\nis like so unique it's really hard to\nfind people in the world that I would go\nlike oh this guy's doing something I\nwant to be more like him um I think that\nwhen you give me this kind of\noverarching like uh dissolution of\ndesires the freedom to choose better\npaths often times the path that you\nchoose post dissolution will be better\nthan the you know the more Hardline Road\nyou run prior to that it would be\ninteresting if there were people that I\ncould look at that were achieving or\naccomplishing in my Arena those types of\nthings that had made those decisions\ndoes that make sense so for instance\nsomething you're telling me um is the uh\nthe the ambition driver the ambition\nengine might feel good because it pushes\nand pushes and pushes but that if you\ncould dissolve everything underneath\nthat and then make other choices that\nmight be better but I mean obviously\nintellectually and I'm very tied to that\nambition engine and it's hard for me to\nI'm hearing what you're saying but\nthere's a lot of disbelief without me\nbeing able to find somebody in the world\nand go like oh that person did that and\nI see they're doing like I aspire to\nthat I want to Aspire to that so it\nwould push me in that direction does\nthat make sense what I'm saying yeah but\nso so do you I'm I'm getting kind of\nthis tacit idea that I need someone to\nnot need\nbut if I set a role model for myself it\nhelps motivate my\nbehavior\nit could or like um if there's a\nparticular habit that's good I like to\nsee the proof of concept of that I guess\nso like if somebody tells me something\nlike oh like um you met me a year ago\nand I told you that I was going to read\nyou know one book a week and then they\ntalked to me about you know the 52\ndifferent books they read last year just\nbecause they found some like novel way\nto work reading into their schedule um\nlike maybe they read like two pages\nafter every League of game if I see that\nthen in my life i' be like holy crap\nthis guy has a really good outcome he\nhad a really cool process for doing it\nI'm going to copy that that's such a\ngood that's kind of what I'm thinking\nyeah I mean when you're talking me about\nthe dissolution thing I'd be curious\nyeah I don't I don't know who you would\nconsider a good role\nmodel um I don't think that so all like\nthe only thing that comes to my mind is\nmy own experience with my own Journey\nbut I don't think that I am an\nappropriate role model for you I think\nwe're colleagues and I'm happy to share\nwhat that experience looked like for me\nand the reason that I'm advocating for\nit is because I think it has been\nprofoundly positive in my\nlife okay um I can you actually so then\nI'm kind of curious for however much\nyou're obviously comfortable sharing um\nyou have from everything that I've seen\nyou've got an awesome family you've got\nan awesome like company and you do\nreally cool stuff online how do you\nbalance out um yeah how do you balance\nout what emotional decision somebody\ncomes to you with a with an offer uh or\nan ability to expand your business you\nknow twofold you've got an opportunity\nto do this but it might come at like\nsignificant cost to your family what do\nyour what does the process look like for\nyou how do you even begin to have that\ninternal dialogue yeah so I I I can\nshare my own experience um so to begin\nwith like I wanted to be big when I was\ngrowing up like I wanted to be an\nimportant person I grew up Indian um an\nIndian diaspora in the United States\nmeans that you've got a couple of career\nchoices uh you know there's a there's a\nvery strong founder effect so there's\nlike serious brain drain so all the\nIndian kids so I grew up in a city where\nthere were five people my age in the\nwhole city there were five Indian people\nin my grade in the whole city three of\nus became doctors right so that's like\nit's just\nstaggering um so I grew up with this\nculture that was very\nlike education focused achievement\nfocused not tiger parents but that's\njust kind of the culture like my parents\nwere very loving and supportive um and\nso I grew up and like you know when I\nwas 15 or 16 I told people I wanted to\nbe a doctor and they got impressed with\nthat because oh I aluk is such a smart\nboy right and then that fed my ego and\nthen when I went to UT um I was a\nfreshman and I majored in Premed and I\nwas like I'm a be at the top of my class\nand where did I want to go to med school\nI wanted to go to med school at Harvard\nbecause that's where all the Indian kids\nwant to\ngo and so when that\nambition was my primary driving force I\nfound that it could not conquer the\nother parts of myself because there was\na part of me that wanted to play for 16\nhours a day and so those two PES Parts\nwould fight and because of whatever on\nsome days I would study and on some days\nI wouldn't and certainly not good enough\nto get into any medical school for that\nmatter so that changed when I went to\nIndia and I sort of discovered a\ndifferent way of\nlike looking at myself and like\nunderstanding like where my ambition\ncomes from can you real quick how old\nwere you when you went to India 21 21\nokay cool okay go ahead and then so I I\nthen decided to become a monk and then\nbut that too was like actually the same\ndriving forces what I later discovered\nis that I had concluded logically that\nlike I can't compete with these kids\nlike there's no way I'm going to be able\nto achieve my goals and what I want and\nI'm basically a failure at life so what\nI did is I did this really interesting\nego trick where I started devaluing that\nwhich I could not\nhave okay right so oh like all these\nkids are materialistic and they're\nshallow and they all want to you know\nmake lots of money and drive fancy cars\nand things like that I'm going to rise\nabove that and become spirit ritual so\nI'm going to have this super common huh\nI was going to say that's super common\nyeah that when somebody can't have\nsomething they start to say well\nactually that sucks anyway and this has\nbeen way better and blah blah blah I\nforgot so so I I kind of went down that\nroad and then thankfully my teachers\nrecognized that my desire to become a\nmonk was not like genuine it was\nescapism so they didn't take me but they\ncontinued teaching me and then you know\nthe big irony is at one at some point I\ngave up on my dreams\nright I was like there's no [ __ ] way\nI graduated with a 2.5 GPA applied to\nmed school for two years got 110\nrejections sorry 80 something rejections\napplied my third year got another 20 30\n40 rejections and at that point like in\nthat after my second year I had kind of\nthis formative moment where I started\nthinking about okay like what do I want\nand then I changed the way that I\nstarted look it's not about desire or\nanything like that like I kind of let go\nof all that stuff and I was like my\nteachers told me to do something so I'm\ngoing to do it out of like faith not out\nof personal desire or ambition or\nanything like that I trust these people\nand they said do this so I'm gonna do\nthis and even when everyone else\nquestion about that yeah so you coming\nfrom the US and you being really\nambitious and then you kind of like\nchanging your Ambitions to different\nthings why were you in a state where you\nwould trust those teachers or what do\nyou think made it that you were like you\nknow what I'm going to put aside my ego\na little bit and trust these guys\ninstead of just like you know what screw\nthese guys are dumb I'm going to go back\nand follow my own\nstuff so I would say that if you are a\nGSL champion in\nStarcraft and you queue up against\nsomeone who just installed the game this\nis what my interactions with them were\nlike they just crushed I mean it wasn't\ncompetitive but they just bodied me like\nevery every single time they understood\nso much about me that I did not\nunderstand and they taught me all of\nthat stuff about\nmyself okay so they basically bought the\nthey'd earned their respect with their\nAB the knowledge and the ability right\nso they like helped me understand like\nhow to live like these fundamentals\nbecause we don't teach that we don't\nteach people how their mind works and\nthen the other cool thing is they never\nasked me to have faith or trust in them\nwhat they my teachers were good they\nalso recognized that what I needed was\nquestions not answers uh they also did a\ngood job of answering whatever questions\nI had which in many spiritual Traditions\nis like not very good so it didn't\nmatter how hard the question question\nwas that I asked they like basically\nalways had a good\nanswer okay um and and so based on that\nI was like okay these people know what\nthey're talking about and I think\nthere's a lot of legitimacy to this I\nalso in that process started to trust\nmore into it because I started looking\ninto the science I was very skeptical of\nall this meditation stuff when I started\nI didn't believe it I thought it was all\nBs and then I I got my first research\nposition uh studying complimentary\nalternative medicine and that was a very\nformative experience for me too this is\nall roundabout way of saying like as I\ngave up on my ambitions and just focused\non let's call it being a better person\nor accomplishing whatever like different\nkind of internal Compass I actually\nfloated to the top of like the\ncompetitive\npool okay and then my ambitions\nreemerged when I actually started uh so\nI did medical school at tfts and then I\nmatched at Psychiatry for at Harvard and\nMass General in mlan which were like the\nbest programs in the country um I'm sure\nother people will disagree UCLA is\nreally good Stanford's really good y's\nreally good Hopkins is really good um a\nlot of great a lot of great programs but\nbased on the academic status ladder\nwhatever that those were the the top\nprograms in the country um okay and so I\nkind of found myself there and then one\nthing that I quickly realized is I\nactually like I'm not like these people\nso I remember like being\nin the line to get coffee at 400 p.m.\nwith a fellow intern of mine and he was\nan internal medicine intern in man like\nI was just talking to him about like\nmedicine and like what he knew was just\nmindboggling like he was just so\nbrilliant and that was my experience\nthere is that people here are just like\nabsurdly\nbrilliant okay and I didn't even have\nimposter syndrome I think it would have\nhad I would have had imposter syndrome\nif I didn't understand how to do this\nstuff with my mind so I was like all\nright I ended up here anyway so like\neven if I don't belong whatever and then\nI actually like once again sort of\nleaned in on a different kind of compass\nof okay what do I want and then my\ndesires started emerging again because I\nstarted to get prominence um I started\nto achieve things there I started to\nfloat to the top in some places uh even\nin those\ninstitutions and then I started to get\nambitious and then I started a private\npractice and I had people coming to my\noffice for my help who were CEOs of\nmajor companies and billionaires and\nthings like that and I was like all\nright this is what the goal is right\nit's to like become an expert become the\nbest in the world at something and have\npeople come to your office and pay you\nor\ncompanies pay you piles of money to go\nout there and and share your wisdom\nwhich is like exactly what I wanted to\ndo and then I sort of realized a little\nbit after that that this is silly like\nthis is the same stupid ambition and\nthat there's actually a class of people\nout there that need help just as much or\neven more who no one is helping no one\nis even listening to No One Is even\ntalking to and those are degenerates on\nTwitch yeah okay before we move here can\nI ask you a challenging question curious\num so my interactions with you are\nfairly limited but I've seen a lot of\nyour stuff we've spoken a lot um my\nperception of you is you're an\nincredibly intelligent individual um I'm\nsure part of that has been through your\nupbringing part of that is probably uh\nyour parents are probably smart um I'm\nsure there's a mixture there do you\nthink that um you went through the the\npath that you did and rather than kind\nof like gunning for the top and being\nUltra ambitious and being obsessed with\nthe prestige you did a lot of work to\nkind of like discover or build yourself\nup as a character and then the other\nstuff kind of came as a byproduct of\nthat self-improvement that mental like\nself-improvement do you think that the\nsame process would work to make most\npeople successful if they weren't\nexceptionally bright or intelligent so\nsay you take a kid absolutely okay yeah\nyeah go okay yeah you think so give me\ngive me your example yeah I was going to\nsay say you take a kid who you know\ndrops out a I'm giving you an extreme\nbut 16 17 um reads at a you know fourth\nor fifth grade reading level not very\nbright doesn't have very many interest\nor hobbies and this kid's like you know\nwhat I'm going to go discover myself\nmentally do you think that this person\nwould benefit in the same way that you\ndid from that type of yeah mental self\ndiscovery I am I I do not think anything\nis 100% but I feel 100% confident in\nthat strategy and here's why so you're\nyou're what do you think I gained in\nthat process so if I have a character\nsheet what do you think that got me do\nyou think it got me XP do you think it\ngot me skill proficiencies like how do\nyou conceptualize what I went\nthrough because you're saying like what\nI'm hearing you say is like okay is it\npredicated on your inborn talent we'll\nget to that in a second that's kind of\nwhat I'm hearing your\nquestion a little bit Yeah the the way\nthat I would frame it is or the way that\nI would see it is we kind of I think as\nwe grow up in a society um even like to\nBumper bowling I imagine right what does\nthat me do do you know what bumper\nbowling is never mind I'm so sorry but\nlike a lot of people have kind of like\ndifferent rails or different\nrestrictions on them it's it's where you\ngo bowling but instead of gutters\nthey've got bumpers there for like four\nyear olds so you can't go on the gutter\nBas yeah not irrelevant but um yeah that\nyou grow up you've got a lot of\nrestrictions you've got kind of you get\na lot of thought patterns from society\nyou get a lot of like direction from\npeople around you and I guess going to a\ndifferent environment with these guys\nallowed you to kind of like shed a lot\nof those societal expectations a lot of\nthose dispositions you had and just like\nyou really explore and build and work on\nyourself and then once you kind of like\nfully fleshed out and understand\nyourself you're able to re-engage with\nsociety and then explore those things\nyeah that would be yeah perfect right so\nnow my question to you is so like we all\ngo through life with the\ninstrument of our body our mind and I'm\ngoing to toss this word out there\nbecause I think it's complete we can\ntalk about this if you want to and our\nsoul okay okay so we go through the\nworld always with\nus uhuh like you're OCC like when when\nyou're you're playing a first person\ngame here uhhuh and you can't ever zoom\nout of it like you're you're you and so\nwhat I learned in India and why I think\nit doesn't matter what your IQ is and\nI've got evidence of sorts but we'll\ntalk about that in a second is that all\nI Learned was how I\nwork so it's like if you don't know how\na keyboard Works how effective are you\ngoing to be at typing if you are blind\nto a keybo board if you are numb to your\ninternal environment and there are\nstudies that show that there there's six\nor seven neuroscientific deficits that\nlead to addiction and one of them is a\nlack of awareness of your internal\nenvironment and what this clinically\nlooks like is someone will say I don't\nknow what happened I slipped up no\nthere's a whole series of subconscious\nstressors pressures willpower\ndegradation lack of sleep there's a\nthousand things that are going on which\nis responsible for your behavior on this\nparticular day we're just blind to it\nsure so I I think that you know anytime\nwe're numb or blind to and think about\njust think about this for a second if I\nam numb or blind to the driving forces\nwhich doesn't mean they stop driving it\njust means I'm not aware of them yeah\nright and then what happens is is\nactually exactly what you did with this\nconversation which is I have this\nconflict between these two things and\nI'm not trying to [ __ ] on you here but\nit's a great example\nthese two things and what is theic\nanswer but the answer that I'm offering\nbecause this is my perspective it's my\nbias it's my experience is that if you\nunderstand the origin of those two\nperspectives it's not about which one is\nright it's about where does this come\nfrom and that that has very real\nutility and this is where if you want to\ntalk about evidence so like from an\nanecdotal perspective this is what I\nadvocate for people like my patients and\nmy clients and things like that it's\nwhat I advocate to my kids and I think\nthat those people tend to be pretty\nhappy um they tend to have good outcomes\nsometimes those outcomes are scary like\nmakes me wonder whether I'm making a\nmistake and I've sought supervision\naround that so for example like 30% of\npeople who come into my office within 12\nto 18 months will change their job and\nso I started getting scared about like\nam I biasing these people and pushing\nthese people to to make a change because\nthat shouldn't be happening\nand then what I sort of ended up\nconcluding is that as we start this\nprocess what people realize is they\nstart shedding their conditioning or\ntheir socialization or living a life of\nshs and start gravitating towards what\nthey want they start changing their jobs\nand they tend to be like predominantly\nhappy after that process and oftentimes\nparadoxically even more\nsuccessful okay and then there's also I\nmean if you look at now we can talk\nabout real evidence because my anecdotal\nexperience ain't worth much honestly we\nlook at it scientifically we look at\nreal\nevidence we can look at studies on\nmindfulness on meditation on developing\nnarrative on healing trauma and and\nthere isn't I I haven't seen you know\nany evidence I maybe that it's out there\nbut that that this only works for people\nwho are very talented in fact the whole\npoint of mindfulness and the reason that\nwe have it as an evidence-based\nintervention as a part of psychotherapy\nis it works for people on the autism\nspectrum it works for people with Down\nSyndrome it works people with low IQ\nhigh IQ men women old young it works for\neverybody because it's a it's a\nfundamental facet of like our wiring and\nit's how our brain works and when we\nstrengthen our frontal loes it helps us\nwith impulse control right that's like a\nneuroscientific fact so I don't think\nthat I mean I'm happy to be challenged\nuh I think it's a great question but I I\ndon't think it's specific to\nme okay yeah no I was just curious what\nyour answer would be I I mean I think I\nprobably agree I I think if you take a\na person that is underachieving at\nschool and then they become more\nintrospective self-reflective and get a\ngreater understanding of themselves it's\nharder to imag or it's hard to imagine\nthat their life doesn't also\nsignificantly improve in other ways\nbecause my my guess would probably be\nthat those people that are in those bad\nsituations are probably more inhibited\nthan an average person when it comes to\nthose introspective things so opening\nthat up would help them probably that's\na that's a brilliant assumption that\nyou're making because that's like\nliterally that's what happened in my\ncase what we see a lot right so the\nworse your situation is if we think\nabout what is the effect on a human\nbeing of a bad situation it hurts and\nthen our instinctive response when\nsomething hurts is to numb it because we\nhaven't been taught how to fix it so\nthen we ignore it and then what we\nactually see is people in bad situations\nare more introspectively\nblind I don't have let me think about\nthat I don't think that's an\nevidence-based statement but that's my\nopinion sure I can imagine it being the\ncase that depending on the negative\nsituations you grow up in you examine\nnegative behavior it becomes normalized\nand then you unleash that behavior into\nthe world and you lose the ability to\neven analyze introspectively if it's\ngood or bad in the way because it's just\nwhat you've always seen or something\nsomething like that\nsure okay yeah I mean I I think it's\nworked for me now I I think there's\nthere's also like a couple things to\nnotice I I mean the path that I'm on\nis financially less than the path that I\nused to be on right so there are costs\nand then in terms of how do I navigate\nthat I really think about what's the\npoint of money uh and you know it's not\na way of keeping score it's I mean sure\nlike I could buy more stuff but like you\nknow I\ndon't I mean I'm I'm a degenerate gamer\nlike what do I need money for yeah I\nknow like some amount of security and\nstuff is really important right so and\nand that's also where when I sort of\nthink about it like being freed of my\ninternal drivers I can kind of make a\nlogical decision about how much do I\nwant to do for\nfree um so even if you look at like the\npricing in my private practice there was\none point where there was a one point 50\nto 70% of my patients were free care and\nit was my financial situation was fine\nbecause I charged enough to the other 30\nto\n50% and I had a uniform Financial policy\nwhich was\nyou know this is what my rate is pay\nwhat you\ncan okay so the I think some of those\nkind\nof the the dust kind of settles I don't\nknow how like once once your internally\nlike your compass is is set then you\nsort of like can logically think through\nstuff and it kind of\nsettles okay that makes sense I think um\nI have like a similar idea I don't know\nhow well I follow it but I have a\nsimilar idea kind of to what you're\nsaying I think in the business world\nhave you ever heard the term like first\nprinciples I've heard the term I don't\nknow what it means yeah just basically\nlike how like what are you orienting\nyourself towards like what are you about\nlike what are you trying to do yeah and\nwhat you're saying is like anytime\nsomebody would come like for advice like\nI don't know where do I want to go to\ncollege what do I want to do for a job\nblah blah blah kind of like what you're\nsaying like those questions are never\nreally important the important question\nis like well you know what do you want\nto accomplish or who do you want to be\nin like five or 10 years or whatever and\nthen once you have like those like very\nfundamental questions figured out all\nthe other questions become pretty simple\nso I think kind of what you're saying\nabout like um figuring out of like the\ninternal area of like what does it mean\nto you know take a pill or where to self\njudgment come from or anything like that\nthen once if I've like figured out those\ntypes of things then the questions about\nlike medication that are really\ndifficult questions at all they kind of\nfall into line very simply is yeah yeah\nand I think that that's so there's like\nscientific support of that so like even\nso part of the reason I started a\ncoaching program was\nbecause I thought that there some of\nthese things like coming down to First\nprinciples were not emphasized in the\nmental Health space so just one example\nof that is the number one variable that\ncorrelates with vulnerability of\npornography addiction is meaninglessness\nin life in life okay so but if we sort\nof think about it we actually have\nevidencebased approaches to cultivate\npurpose and meaning and Direction which\nare all\nintrospective okay but and so what what\nhappens if you look at the literature on\npositive psychology when you cultivate\nintrospection the rest of the stuff\nfalls into place and the the whole\nreason behind purpose and this is why we\nteach so much about Dharma or or Dharma\nright is once you have that North Star\nthen stuff starts to fall in place and\nthe more important thing is that yeah\nand and then we just have we see these\nscientific benefits which is that even\nthough we're not treating pornography\naddiction you just have to have a reason\nto not watch pornography like you have\nto have something in your life that is\nguiding you pushing you because what\nwhat happens with pornography addiction\nor video game addiction is it just fills\nup the empty space in your life and it\ndrags you down sure I think there's a\nlot of um antisocial behavior that falls\ninto this like when you ask like a like\na prep school kid you know like what did\nyou have to do in your life to not\ncommit armed robbery they don't really\nhave an answer because they were going\nto school in the morning for band\npractice they were doing football\npractice after school their mom and dad\npicked them up they were like there\nthere's not even a question of why you\nwould do that because that kind of like\nthing in your life is filled by so many\nother things so that that seems to track\nfrom what I understand yeah yeah\nokay did we get to your original concern\nabout I mean do you want to talk more\nabout stimulants and kind of outcomes\nand what to expect and how to think\nabout it sure I have one more big\nquestion on that if sure yeah if you\nwant to and then you can go from\nwherever yeah um so um another thing\nthat's difficult for me okay we're Chang\nyour gears significantly okay so um pre\nversus post taking some kind of like\nmind altering\nmedication um something of that's very\ndifficult for me is how do you figure\nout what is a positive effect of a drug\nthat's helping you live a better life\nversus what's just like you being high\nand like having a good time uh so some\nsome real examples I'll give of this is\num there's a lot of things that seem to\noverlap in terms of like getting high\nand then also like uh not having ADHD so\nI don't know how many of these things\nare true but I've read something that\nlike if you sometimes overeating can be\nlike a fact when it comes to ADHD people\nthat if you have like a bag of cookies\nevery time you walk by you want to grab\none even if you're not necessarily\nhungry and then I noticed that like if\nI've had amphetamines I can have\nanything in the house and I just won't\neat it because I'm not tempted to but\nlike am I actually making the choice\nmaking a better choice to not do that or\nam I just too high to want to eat and\nthere's a lot of I there's like neither\nneither neither so so let's understand\nthe neuroscientific mechanism be beh\nbehind why you eat cookies when you have\nADHD okay I mean this is generality this\nis great this is like a med school\nquestion so let's understand this right\nso why do you eat cookies if you're not\nhungry so people with ADHD are impulsive\nwhich means that they engage in\nimpulsive behavior so if you look at\nlike even the packaging on a cookie the\npackaging on a on a cookie is designed\nto evoke an Impulse so you have I'm not\nsaying corporations are evil or anything\nlike that but it's not my area of\nexpertise but you we all know that\ncorporations designed cookie companies\ndesign packages to evoke impulses and\nthen you have a brain that is vulnerable\nto\nimpulses in a way that is so normally\nwhat happens in the brain is we have all\nkinds of integration of\nsignals okay so you have for example\nlike a glucagon level and a leptin level\nand a gin level and all of these like\nlevels insulin glucagon leptin and gin\nare all in some [ __ ] Tango to tell\nyou when to eat a cookie\nokay\nmhm so what happens in the case of ADHD\nis it's kind of like an impulsive\nbehavior since it's around and there's a\nenvironmental trigger in a sensory input\nbefore you even realize what you're\ndoing and you don't even realize it's\nnot a conscious Choice it's just an\nImpulse that you give into because your\ncapacity to restrain impulses is low so\nthis is why for example like uh you know\npeople with ADHD benefit from cool uh\nclean areas\nbecause what you really want to do\nis\nextend so so the key thing about\nimpulses is let me just think about how\nto say this yeah sure so if you're\nsomeone with ADHD and you're struggling\nwith impulsive behavior the main thing\nthat you need to understand is that the\nimpulse is not sustained it's an Impulse\nso what you really need to do if if you\nget distracted is you need to ride out\nthe impulse so what's happening the\nreason people in in our society are\ngetting [ __ ] right now by ADHD\nis because our society\nis greasing the wheels for impulsive\nbehavior so this used to have a lock\ncode and now it has a thumb print now it\nhas face ID so if a impulse lasts half a\nsecond I can pick up the phone and the\nphone remembers which website now I have\nan a notification too so I have an\nImpulse for one second and in that\nsecond what can happen I can look at the\nphone the phone Auto unlocks I don't\neven have to try to unlock it I just\nhave to point the phone at my face and\nthen it auto unlocks I see a\nnotification I click on the impulse\nthere go 30 minutes mhm so what happens\nwith stimulant medication is we are\nrestraining the\nimpulsiveness okay which I don't think\nthat you're making you weren't making\nconscious\ndecisions in either case right your\nbrain is processing that a cookie is\nthere it just the impulse is controlled\nby whatever other directed Behavior you\nhave\nGoa\nokay that's it's hard to emotionally\nit's hard to process that but I mean\nintellectually it makes sense yeah yeah\nyeah so what makes it hard for you to\nintellect emotionally process that this\nis great things are coming full\ncircle um well because intellectually\neverything you're saying makes sense um\nI I I feel like as people I I think we\ntend to think of ourselves as being more\nthan we actually are so things like\nimpulses don't like fit into our\ncognitive understandings of ourselves\nlike why would I do something on an\nImpulse I'm choosing to do every single\nthing I'm doing so the idea that like\nnow I'm not making a really bad choice\nbut it's not a choice it's just an\nImpulse that I'm not acting on that's\nlike it's just a hard thing to\nemotionally into it for me I guess yeah\nthat make sense yeah it makes a lot of\nsense but I think it like so let me tell\nyou what I heard okay you said is this\nam I not eating because I'm high yeah\nversus the ADHD so like what is the\nemotional veilance of each of those\noptions does that question make sense\nwell it's yeah it's full circling back\nto the um to the original question of um\nI guess of like the character question\nkind of or am\nI so so let's let's say one of those\nthings is true how how do you feel about\nyourself yeah there's a different\njudgment like absolutely not eating yeah\nexactly yeah both cases it's a negative\njudgment\nwell you see that cuz on on the one hand\noh yeah oh [ __ ] right [ __ ] Steven is\ngetting taking his [ __ ] high pills\nand sure he's not eating cookies which\nwould be progress but why aren't we\neating cookies because we're [ __ ]\nhigh you see that well there's one so\nlike the the yeah I understand what\nyou're saying um I slightly just but I\nunderstand what you're saying the\ndifference here is I think I largely\nhave kind of sort of made peace with\nmyself in terms of like taking the the\ndrug but the the rationalization in my\nmind is that like I think taking the\ndrug is okay as long as I'm elevating\nmyself to just a baseline level of\nimpulse control so if it is the case\nthat I'm doing the medication\nappropriately and I'm at a baseline\nlevel of impulse control I'm not doing\nthis that's good but if I'm like\novershooting and I'm just like abusing\nDrugs That's the bad part right so but\nwhat I'm saying is like think about like\nso this is a the study is rigged like I\nknow that you've reconciled it that's\nfine but what I'm saying is this [ __ ] is\nstill lurking because\nwhat was so when when you gave me okay\nyou gave me two options right option\nnumber one is like I've got ADHD and\nthat's why I'm eating cookies and option\nnumber two is I stopped eating cookies\nbut why does your mind generate such a\njudgmental hypothesis for option\ntwo um well if it's because I'm just\nsuper high then it's just because I'm\nabusing drugs to shortcut like the\ngrowth in character that I should have\ndo you see how like out of the thousand\nthings that you could have said there's\na thousand there's a differential\ndiagnosis there are a thousand\nhypotheses why you're not eating the\ncookies which one does your mind settle\non well obviously the drug right right\nso that's coming from you do you see\nwhat I'm saying like that thing is still\nactive well but I mean I am doing it\nright that's like like so but that's\nwhat I'm kind of saying is you're doing\nit and you've reconciled on an\nintellectual level but that part of you\nthat is frustrated with yourself for\nbeing weak which by the way is if I had\nto bet money right so this is most\ncommon thing if you look at research on\nthis people with ADHD have harsh self\njudgments and so the way that the self\njudgment manifests in your mind is by\nit's like a it's like a study bias like\nthe options that it generates for you\nare\nrigged the reason am I too high to no\nyou're not too high I mean I don't think\nso right so we also know for example\nthat the stimulant medication uh\nsuppresses appetite one of the major\nconcerns about giving it to kids is that\nit can interfere with like things like\ngrowth and stuff like that which\nthankfully it's not too bad um but but\nyou know there could be a\nneuroscientific but I I wouldn't I\nwouldn't characterize it as high but\nthat's what I mean is like you pick you\npick such a judgmental characterization\nas an option which I think is\nsignificant sure I guess it's just\nbecause that's the thing I'm trying to\navoid because I know that um taking said\nmedication is going to improve my life\nin these ways but like if it's too much\nit's\nprobably yeah right so so the the things\nthat you're anxious or worried about\nright that's that emotional energy and\nthat when you say it's it's a brilliant\nInsight that this is emotionally not\nsitting with me and then the question is\nwhy it's\nbecause you're emotionally in the\nopposite\ndirection well like let's say so\nhypothetically let's say I I like let's\nsay that I fix this okay what's what's\nto um what's to prevent me from say okay\nso like here talk me down from this one\nand I'm not saying I'm doing this and\nthis is all hypothetical sorry I'm not\nasking for medication advice but like\nlet's say theoretically like I solve all\nthese issues I fig you're like I don't\nhave any negative judgments whatsoever\num you know forget these things I'm just\ngoing to do you know 100 milligrams of\nmethamphetamine every day because I have\nno judgments about this anymore it\nimproves my life in all these different\nways I'm doing so better here like\nwhat's the back away from the cliff\nthere as opposed to right now where\nyou're saying probably too far in the\nother direction of being too judgmental\nlike how would you I would say it's just\nlike any other\nmedication right so like you would have\na relationship with your stimulant the\nsame that you do with like say a\ncholesterol\nmedication or disagree with this I want\nto hear you yeah rationalize this for me\nbecause I have a hard time figuring this\none out in my mind I have like um\nbehavioral modifying medication that\nworks on your brain I I separate that\nway differently than\nlike second because what was the premise\nthat we started with that we dissolved\nthis stuff right okay so when we\ndissolve that stuff it's be it's\nBehavior modifying so what there's no\nemotional energy behind that I need this\nmedication in the same way that I need\ncholesterol\nmedication there's no judgment or yeah\nbut I feel like but I feel like I feel\nlike the difference is that like I can't\ndo anything mentally about like my\ntriglycerol levels or trig I can't do\nanything mentally about my HDL LDL like\nI can't think these away yeah\nso that that's that's your hypothetical\nis flawed because you're injecting your\njudgment into the\nhypothetical because look at look when I\ntell you then it becomes just like any\nif if we don't attach any judgments to\nstimulants if we we've dissolved that\nthat judgment we don't no longer judge\nthings then what happens is then it's\njust like any other medication that's\nlike you follow that\nlogically I mean I follow logically what\nyou're saying but it feels like it\ndoesn't so like for instance I could\nlive a day I could have a day where i'm\nvery focused and I could do everything I\ncould do on my ADHD medication like\nnormally but I couldn't have a day where\nI don't take my insulin as a type one\ndiabetic right that one of those worlds\nis possible one of them is not those\nthings and the reason that you you are\nso so let me let me give you a different\nexample okay so let's say\nlike cholesterol medication now there\nare people who can get really upset\nabout their cholesterol medication and\nhaving to take it every day can you\nimagine\nthat no I I might got a family of\n[ __ ] diabetics and sometimes they\ndon't even take their [ __ ] insulin so\nI'm very aware of that I people people\nare like you know like oh like I should\nbe able to do this through\ndiet like their body image issues this\nis the psychodynamics of Psych ology we\nhave all kinds of attachment to a\nparticular pill and what you're saying\nis this pill I can understand how you\nwould not have an attachment to but this\nother pill logically has attachments for\nthese reasons no bro it's not logical\nit's emotional it's based on your\nattachment to that particular pill and\nwhat that pill means to you it's not\nbecause of the neuro it's not because of\nthe physiologic thing that's just what\nyour mind says right because what you're\nworried about and this is true of all\nmedication is like this is the part of\nmy body that's\nweak\nyeah but I feel like\num I I I feel like we don't I feel like\nwe don't view our brains as our bodies I\nthink that's like the fundamental\ndifference here like if my heart isn't\ndoing something I take a medication for\nmy heart if my you know lungs if my\nkidneys I I take a medic but but but you\ndon't view yourself as your brain that's\nlike you right I feel yeah that's the\ndifference God yeah so but I mean when\nyou say we who is in that\nwe well I was speaking we as and humans\nin general I think we view ourselves as\nbeing our brain rather than like our\nbrain is an organ in our body that we\ncan medicate do you view yourself that\nway I probably do and yeah right so I\nthink this is where where like because\ni' I'm telling you man I have worked\nwith plenty of people who do not\nidentify with their brain and identify\nwith their body\nmore that's really interesting I almost\ndon't believe that that's crazy but okay\nthat's that's really interesting to me\nyeah okay right so like you can take\nanyone with body image issues who I am\nis determined this could also be because\nyou're a dude and I'm a dude so like we\ndon't get as judged as harshly on\naverage I'm not saying that we don't get\njudged and this is balancing out right\nso like it used to be that women had\nbody image issues way more than men do\nand when I work with women who have body\nimage issues they like you know a lot of\nwho they are is tied up to their body\nand working with and that that's not\njust one reason for that I mean there\nthat's evening out by the way I think\nwith social media but then there's like\nother things that biologically women go\nthrough that men don't have an\nequivalent like pregnancy and child\nbirth so when you go through pregnancy\nit makes permanent alterations of your\ndiabetes your fat\ndistribution um you know the the change\nto breast tissue is\nprofound right like when when they swell\nand you've got all this stuff like I\nmean so like there there's definitely\npeople can identify with the body I\nthink you're quite\nintellectual and I think that you would\nbe a afraid you would you would fear\nlosing a chunk of your brain way more\nthan you would fear losing a piece of\nyour hand yeah of course right but if\nI'm a professional\nwrestler like it could be the other way\naround so I think the key thing here is\nyour attachment to it which is the\nproblem that's my point and so the\nproblem here is that once you dissolve\nthat attachment the conclusion that you\nassume disappears because the reason you\ninfer that is because of your attachment\nto your brain over your body I don't\nknow if I lost you there\nbut a little bit or or not not not you\nlost me a little bit but I follow you a\nlittle bit or I guess that would mean I\ndid lose a your um in your world the\nlike the the brain and the body and then\nlike the spirit or the soul or whatever\nthese things exist all kind of\ndifferently from one another and\nmedicating your heart or medicating your\nliver or medicating your brain are all\nessentially the same thing but I'm\ncoming in with a normative judgment that\nloads brain medication differently so\nall my questions are kind of\nfundamentally poisoned as soon as\nexactly right because I say then it\nbecomes just like a cholesterol\nmedication and what's your response you\nsay no it doesn't and then I ask you why\nis it different and then you're like\nwell because I'm my brain is different\nfrom body and I'm like well hold on a\nsecond that is where you're inserting\nyour\njudgment right so if we're if we're\nreally presuming that you've metabolized\nthis stuff then it then it does become\nthat and I've seen that process many\ntimes by the way right so like when work\nwith the psychics of psychopharmacology\npeople like taking their SSRI or their\nanti-depressant medication there's all\nkinds of psychotherapy that you have to\ndo around that what does it mean to take\nI'm dependent on this medication for my\nfundamental happiness in life oh my God\nI don't want to take happy pills like\nthis isn't like ADHD where we know that\nthe brain is different like this is just\ndepression right with ADHD these people\nare neurodivergent their brain is wired\ndifferently but me I was fine for the\nfirst 25 years of my life and then\nsomething happened and I became\nweak right even those people will say\nADHD medication is okay but depression\nmedication isn't so it all has to do\nwith your attachment to the by\nattachment I'm using it in an Eastern\nsense like the the meaning that you\nassociate with that\nthing and and what I'm hearing through\nand through is that you associate a lot\nof meaning and you you adapted\nbeautifully and cognitively reframed\nbeautifully and you're whoever's\nprescribing the [ __ ] did a great\njob right because you're taking it\nsounds like you're adherent you're doing\ndoing with all this other stuff and by\nthe way there's a very simple answer to\nyour question of like how do I\nknow I think you asked a question\nsomething about\num I see a lot of really positive\noutcomes and I don't know like is this\nlike the medication is working and now\nSteven bonell I'm making good choices or\nam I just really high and now like I can\ndo problem solving really yeah so so\nthat's where from from like if I'm\nteaching a med student class like\nthere's a really simple answer to that\nthat's why we have measurable scientific\nvalidated\ninstruments right for yeah yeah so so\nlike for example we we will track\nsymptoms so how do we know if it's the\nmedication that's working or you're\nmaking good choices well first of all\nyou have to remember that making good\nchoices is a complex neuroscientific\nprocess which the medication working\ncould mean could it helps people make\ngood choices that's literally what the\nmedication does right it corrects\nwhatever weaknesses or supplements\nwhatever weaknesses there are in the\nbrain that prevent these people from\nmaking good choices now there's a whole\ncomplicated thing there so some people\nwill consider ADHD medication to be like\nglasses it doesn't fix the problem but\nas long as your glasses are on your\neyesight is normal I think it's a good\nanalogy but I think there's all kinds of\nproblems with that\nperspective so and if you look at the\ndata on ADHD medication there's some\ndata that shows that the effect l\nlingers for 3 to 6 months after you stop\nthe medication so there are other things\ngoing on with taking the medication that\ncould have to do with things like\ndeveloping healthy habits habits yeah\nthat's a big thing yeah that I read yeah\nright so so and that's because the the\nhabits I mean the neurotransmitters for\nthe Habit circuitry and the location in\nthe brain are completely different the\nreal tragedy in ADHD is that since you\nare impulsive you never get the ability\nto develop habits which is a real\ntragedy because the one thing that can\nprotect you against your ADHD is the\nEndo avonoid system that is habits\nyeah yeah\nokay other\nquestions\num no I don't think so okay I wanted to\njust share one or two things yeah\nwhatever you want yeah\nso when people think about ADHD like I\njust wanted to like share how I\nunderstand what is effective about ADHD\nmedication what it does and what it\ndoesn't do okay so if we look at ADHD\nmedication we have to understand that\nthe problems that people with ADHD have\ncome from two places they come from the\nneurode Divergence of the brain let's\njust call it that and they come from\nliving a\nlife with neurod Divergence so there are\nthese social impacts that come from\nbasically having untreated or\nundiagnosed ADHD so um you know my\nfavorite statistic about this is that\noftentimes people won't have friends so\nlike kids with ADHD by the time they hit\nthe second grade they stop getting\ninvited to birthday parties so they have\ndifficulty\nsocializing um you know because they\ncan't function well in school their\nacademic achievement goes down this is\nwhy there is a causitive impact in terms\nof depression later in life it also\ncreates the things that you know I kind\nof see a lot of people which is a lot of\nharsh self judgment a lot of I should be\nable to do this this medical illness is\ndifferent from all the other medical\nillnesses and let me give you all the\nlogical reasons why right you can't\ndirectly interact with your heart you\ncan't directly lower your triglycerides\nlevel by the way you can but that's\nconversation for a different day when I\nwhen I said do it I mean like think it\ndown that's what I meant yeah you can\nthink it down oh boy okay well never\nmind okay I believe you go ahead um so\nso it's wild man\nokay so uh and anyway it doesn't disable\nyour point it's just you know yeah I\nunderstand yeah and so when we're\nthinking about ADHD medication like\nwhat's the goal here and that's where\nlike I think we've got to understand two\nthings one is that even some of the\ntrauma induced consequences of growing\nup with ADHD will create ADHD symptoms\nimpairment and concentration difficulty\nfocusing um difficulty with emotional\nregulation if you you look at the the\nsymptomatology of trauma and the\nsymptomatology of ADHD they overlap and\nthe real problem that we see with ADHD\nis when you grow up with ADHD and you\nget traumatized because you recognize\nyou're just as smart as everyone else\nbut you can't [ __ ] do it it's so easy\nthey're just sitting there and looking\nat a book and reading it that's\nliterally what reading is it's just\nlooking at a book you can [ __ ] sit\nthere and look at a book but you can't\nread the words and so you feel\nincompetent and as you grow up with that\nADHD\nyou start to experience various micr\ntraumas or even macroscopic traumas\nparents getting mad at you why are you\nlike this like you know you just need to\nstudy you need to try harder I used to\nget called into my you know teachers\noffice once a semester for my parent\nteacher conference and they'd say if he\njust applied himself he'd do so well\nhe's got so much\npotential and so that kind of stuff\ncreates its own kind of trauma induced\ncognitive deficits and then if we look\nat treatment of ADHD stimulants can\ncorrect neuro Divergence but all that\nother stuff is not going to get\ncorrected with\nstimulant and some of those things some\nof the other consequences that happen\nwhen we grow up with ADHD is we develop\nwe fail to develop adaptations so we get\nworse at developing like emotional\nregulation techniques and things like\nthat and the adaptations that we do\ndevelop growing up as a neurode\nDivergent kid in a neurotypical world\nbecome maladaptations later in life\nwe're also more vulnerable to things\nlike and Stu like that so when we look\nat stimulant medication a lot of it\ndoesn't get fixed which confuses a lot\nof people a lot of it does if we look at\nstimulant medication most of the\nresearch of the metaanalyses suggests\nthat starting it early to prevent all of\nthese psychological impacts will be\nprotective in the long run and lead to\nbetter outcomes in terms of lifelong\nachievement academic success etc etc\nright because this this is what you got\nto understand is you can have ADHD with\ncertain cognitive deficits and untreated\nADHD plus cognitive deficits plus\nfailing out of school what does that do\nto someone's psychological trajectory\ntheir life trajectory there's recently a\nstudy that showed\num that the majority of reasons that\npeople are depressed today have nothing\nto do with like internal feelings or\ntheir relationships they have everything\nto do with circumstances in their life\nlack of financial stability living at\nhome whatever other kinds of things\ntheir life objectively\nsucks and so when we're thinking about\nADHD medication and whether to do it or\nnot do it I think this is what you\nreally need to think about is that it's\nnot going to fix everything but it'll\nprevent a lot of damage is which is\nusually why we will medicate kids with\nADHD if we choose to um and that even if\nyou start medication as an adult it's\nnot going to fix everything because\nthere are the consequences of growing up\nwith ADHD that need to be\naddressed the last thing to consider is\nthat the effect size of ADHD medication\nis basically the same or slightly\ninferior to\npsychotherapy and this kind of circles\nback to like can I do it without\nmedication the answer is probably yes\nbut it takes a concerted effort which a\nlot of people don't have the bandwidth\nfor and there's also data that shows\nthat medicating someone with ADHD makes\nthe effect of psychotherapy better so\nwhen you have someone who can pay\nattention in Psychotherapy they get a\ngreater effect size the other cool thing\nis that the effect of psychotherapy\nlingers for years after the completion\nof treatment compared to months for ADHD\nmedication\num so this is kind of all roundabout way\nof saying you know I I still think that\nwhat you got to do what's right for you\nand everyone's got to do what's right\nfor them uh I think that there's a lot\nof very\nreal shame and judgment that kids with\nwith ADHD develop and then carry into\nadulthood and that if you really want to\nconquer this\nproblem\num I think it's usually like a\ncombination of like all the above so\nmedication if that's what works for you\nPsychotherapy if you have the time and\nenergy for it and just as a prescriber\nmyself the primary reason I prescribe\nmedication is when people don't have\ntime to do everything else that's really\nbecause I I think there are very few\ncases or at least in\nPsychiatry we really need\nmedication like most in most cases\nPsychotherapy is just as effective as\nwhatever we're\nprescribing okay um so I think those are\njust a couple of\nconsiderations okay cool um yeah thank\nyou so much for coming on today yeah\nthanks for having me it's always fun to\nchat yeah likewise and good luck with\nall of your ende ever s and\num yeah I I really encourage you to\ncontinue exploring down I'm sure you\nwill but but really like trying to get\nto the root of this stuff and and I I'm\nI'm so curious about your personal take\non spirituality and stuff like that\nbecause I I think it's I think you're\nPrime for it more so now yeah more so\nnow than before is absolutely true but\nthat might be from like one to six out\nof 100 but maybe yeah um yeah okay yeah\nmore Prime than before are you just car\nyou going to twitchcon or do you not say\nthat publicly uh no I'm not going to\ntwitchcon oh okay well never mind are\nare you going to twitchcon yeah\nokay yeah I'm I'm not going this year\nI've got other stuff I'm doing um I\nthink one\nthing uh it's NE next week\nright uh the 20 20th to the 22nd I think\nyeah yeah I'm actually going on a spirit\nual Retreat oh well good for you yeah so\nmuch better than the rest of us wow I'll\nbe enjoying my vanity and Vegas no\nyou're good okay that's cool well good\nfor you yeah wait when you do those do\nyou normally do those with your do you\ntake any family members with you or is\nit you your wife or is that like always\nlike this time I'm going alone and this\nis the first time that I've gone in 12\nyears wow how long is a retreat for five\ndays\ncool so it it's been I thankfully I got\nenough to I mean I have a spiritual\npractice that's pretty set always\ninterested in learning more but um it's\njust with medical training and and\nstreaming and all that kind of stuff\nlike that kind of took a step on the\nback burner and now I've got enough time\nto do that kind of thing when you do\nyour spirituality stuff do you get to do\nyou ever M uh maintain contact with the\npeople that you felt like helped you in\nyour early 20s the guys that you said\nyou went over and studied with or are\nyou kind of like not talking to those\npeople anymore uh I'm not talking to\nthose people anymore um for the most\npart I uh it's interesting so I think\nthe person who's the closest to what I\nwould describe as a guru um I basically\nonly had contact with them for two years\nand for a while it was very hurtful\nbecause it kind of felt like they\nghosted me and I don't know what\nhappened but gotcha you know\nwhatever okay yeah cool all right cool\nwell yeah hey I appreciate the talk do\nyou want to yeah I I say shout yourself\nout I think most your my audience knows\nwho you are but yeah where can they find\nyou if they're looking for more cool\nstuff or a project you're working on or\nif you could direct people to one link\nor one thing where would you send people\nyeah so I think since we're talking\nabout ADHD we have um so like part of\nwhat we built at HG we build different\nkinds of resources and stuff we've got a\nton of videos that I think are pretty\ngood on on YouTube about ADHD but we\nalso have like a guide where I go\nthrough kind of like in a more\ncomprehensive way like\npractices uh meditation techniques and\nthings like that to specifically\nunderstand the different parts of ADHD\nand how to really overcome them um so\nthey can check check out Dr K's guide\nand then I stream on YouTube and\ntwitch um and yeah check us out at\nhealthy gamer G and likewise where can\nwe find you Stephen Destiny uh Destiny\nyeah on Youtube kick maybe twitch again\nsomeday and uh Instagram so yeah and\nthen is there is there anything that\nyou're going to be doing uh coming up\nthat we should tune into anything that\nyou're excited about in terms of\npodcasts or collabs or debating anyone\ncool yeah my my most exciting thing is\nfinally uh I think it's the 20th or the\n21st next month I finally do my Ben ship\nhero debate that should be fun oh wow\nthat's awesome man yeah yeah that's\nthat's uh I'd love to do you said 20th\nof next month so November I think the\n20th through the 21st show that where is\nthat going to be um do you know where\nwhere we can is it I assume it's gonna\nbe live and stuff right in broadcast I\nhave I have no idea yet I think Le\nFreedman wants to do it in a studio so\nit might be like all pre-recorded we\nmight do it live I'm not sure yet so\nyeah I'm just trying to figure out where\nI find a watch party yeah that'll be\nit'll be it'll make the rounds I'm sure\nso all right cool man um well good luck\nto you on on your debate I look forward\nto it and thanks for coming on today\ntake care man thanks for shing with me\nyou later\nbye um all\nright that was\ngreat questions\npeople\nyeah so I you\nknow Destiny's great I think he's uh you\nknow I I know that not Everyone likes\nhim which I think is completely fair I\nthink it's fair to criticize people\nright and to not like certain things\nabout him I I appreciate how I mean in\nmy conversations with him he comes\nacross this quite open-minded and\nwilling to consider alternative\nperspectives um and so I I respect that\nI I I like talking to them which is fun\nand I like talking to a lot of different\npeople and part of I think what we try\nto do here is as far as I can tell we\ndon't support a particular political\nphilosophy\nor um I know sometimes people think we\nsupport one gender like\ntoday I mean I'm pro-human for what\nthat's worth but I'm sure that everyone\nwho supports a particular political\nideology or has a bias says the same\nthing right I'm objectively fair and\neverybody else is biased in Pro\nsomething so if you all see some kind of\nbias or whatever in the work that we do\nplease let us know and we've actually\nseen that a lot especially around gender\nDynamics the big irony there is that if\nwe do stuff that is geared towards\nmen um women in our community get upset\nand if we do something that's geared\ntowards women men in our community get\nupset and we're going to try to help\neverybody that's just part of our\nethos um\nI'm anti-an animals I don't think so\nright so that's the other thing is I\ndon't know like we're being pro\nsomething defaulted to becoming anti-\nsomething right and when it comes to the\ngender stuff like I I think men\nunderstanding women is very important\nfor men and I think women understanding\nmen is very important for\nwomen in\ngeneral how do you understand the\nrelationship with virtue and emotional\nregulation I consider them to be\nsomewhat\nindependent but if we look at some of\nthese virtues like if we say patience is\na virtue and duty is a\nvirtue often times pursuing those\nvirtues will train Us in important life\nskills like emotional regulation so I'll\ngive you all a simple example of\nthis so we all know that willpower is a\ngood\nthing and then what happens is people\nwill kind of say like okay if willpower\nis a good thing and I need to be more\ndisciplined and I need to have more\nwillpower how do I actually do that\nright so when I was growing up my\nfavorite examples my mom would say Alo\nyou need to be more\ndisciplined and then I was like okay she\nstart waking up at 7:00 a.m. every day\nand you will be more disciplined and I\nwas like wait a second but like if I\ncould wake up at 7:00 a.m. every day\nthen I would be disciplined like I don't\nunderstand you know it's like a chicken\nor egg thing like isn't how do you\ndevelop\ndiscipline so the the very practical\nskills that we want to develop around\nemotional regulation patience discipline\nwillpower we don't know how to develop\nthose and people will say things like oh\nyou got to take cold showers so if you\nlook at the science of this what you\ndiscover is that taking cold showers\ndoesn't make you generally speaking have\na stronger willpower than other people\nbecause what happens is the first couple\ntimes you do it it requires willpower\nand then your body habituates to it and\nno longer needs to exert willpower\nbecause it's used to it that's what our\nbody does so these willpower boosting\nexercises don't really work that\ngreat so what does work and this is\nwhat's really interesting so if you look\nat the practice of yoga the practice of\nyoga starts with two things Yas and Nas\nyamas are personal observances and Nas\nare societal\nobservances and my favorite example of\nthis is Satya which means\ntruth so when you develop a virtue the\nreally interesting thing is that you\nwill develop all kinds of cognitive and\nneuroscientific skills as a con\nconsequence of The Virtue and people may\nbe kind of confused by that like how\ndoes that work so we don't know how to\ndevelop willpower it turns out the way\nthat you develop willpower is not by\ndeveloping willpower the way that you\ndevelop willpower is by committing to\ntruthfulness you will say well hold on a\nsecond what do you mean does that mean\nthat people who are honest are better\nlet's understand it neuroscientifically\nso if I commit to not\nlying what does that mean about my\nlife if I can't lie let's say\nscientifically I was no longer capable\nof lying how would it change what I eat\nhow would it change what I do how would\nit shape my life if I could not lie and\nsomeone asks me hey what do you have for\nlunch today oh I had\nMcDonald's I feel embarrassed saying\nthat I can't lie and I don't want to say\nthat so what do I end up doing I'm going\nto eat something healthy so that when\npeople ask me when I go into lunch today\nwith my colleagues and everyone's like\nwhat' you have for lunch today I I have\nto tell the truth if you were forced to\ntell the truth what kind of Life Would\nyou\nlive and when you commit to truthfulness\nyou\nstart shifting your life to accommodate\nfor that because you can't lie anymore\nand in that shift is where you develop\nall the emotional regulation the\ndiscipline The Willpower because you\ncan't lie\nanymore it's a beautiful technique and\nthey figured it out so subtly that when\nyou set your North Star towards a\nparticular virtue\nin order to achieve that you will\nautomatically start leveling up the\ncognitive and neuroscientific skills\nthat are necessary to improve your life\nthis is why the pursuit of virtue leads\nto Improvement this is sort of a\nspiritual perspective now in some cases\nthis this gets screwed up because at\nsome point this stuff gets codified into\na\nreligion and then what happens is people\naspire to that thing but they have like\na rigged version of it right they have a\nvery selective interpretation of\nwhatever text they they have instead of\nlike committing to the particular\nvirtue and then in doing so their ego\ngets involved and then they don't build\nany of the cognitive skills and stuff\nlike that so what that really means is\nyou can't fake it you can't pay lip\nservice to it you have to really commit\nto\nit and so another good example of this\nis Aima nonviolence\nso in order to commit to\nnonviolence to do your best to not hurt\nanother human being or any living\norganism as best as you can how does\nthat require you to change your\nlife right so it in some cases a himsa\nmeans\nvegetarian and so what would be required\nfor you to not eat meat for 24 hours it\nwill require you to exert willpower\npower and the whole point is since it's\nso Dynamic right and this is what I\nthink people sort of evolutionary\nfigured out since we have nonviolence\nand truthfulness and things like that\nthey're such Dynamic objectives that\nit's not the repetition of the same\nbehavior because being truthful or\nhonest is going to change in different\ncircumstances and it's honestly it's\nlike a cheat code for leveling up the\nimportant skills in life is to commit to\na virtue and I challenge you to do\nit right and then sometimes people will\nbe like not only like so commit to\ntruthfulness for one week no\nlies not allowed to lie not a single one\nwell what about lies of omission if you\nreally want to commit to the spirit of\nit it's not about the letter of the law\nit's like no more lies of omission\neither you don't want to be like\nbrutally honest or whatever the [ __ ] be\nan [ __ ] but if someone asks you a\nquestion no\nlike did you have\nlunch what' you have oh the usual you\nknow what I'm talking about you know\nwhen you're being sneaky and when you\nnormally would say more but you're\npurposefully not saying it so I'm not\nsaying walk around and tell everyone\nexactly what you think about them don't\ndo\nthat but commit to truthfulness for one\nweek and see what happens see how it\nshapes your behavior not allowed to\nlie right so there's one other\nthing since we're talking about\nnonviolence and\nSATA sorry nonviolence which is a himsa\nand Satya which is truthfulness one\nthing to understand while we're on this\npath of truthfulness is we always want\ntruthfulness to be subject to\naimsa so you should be honest but\ncompassion should reign\nsupreme right so you should not let your\ntruthfulness harm another human being as\nbest as you\ncan and so this is kind of the\ninteresting thing is we talk about motiv\nuh meditation as a discreet practice\nthat you do for 5 or 10 minutes if you\nreally want to understand so if you look\nat yoga right so this path of meditation\nthat leads to Enlightenment that's what\nRaji yoga is and the first step is Yama\nand NY second stuff the personal\nobservances and the societal\nobservances so if youall want a societal\nobservance\ncleanliness commit to cleanliness for\none week how does that change your\nlife and this will become a meditation\nthat you do all day long it requires you\nto be in a meditative State all day long\npeople ask me do I meditate every day\nand the answer is sort\nof I will do a formal sitting meditation\nbut some of this stuff I do\nconstantly because what does that mean\nif you're committing to truthfulness no\nlies that means you got to be paying\nattention every moment you're awake\nand to force yourself to pay attention\nand catch it will strengthen your\nfrontal loes it's literally what it is\nright you're meditating for 15 minutes\nI'm giving you a meditation practice\nthat you can do for seven days\nstraight commit to\ntruthfulness as best as you can and this\nis where it's like we're not so the\nmoment you fail you can restart right so\nonce you fail once the game is over you\ncan start another game but it's not like\noh I lied three times in one week no you\nlied once game over start over\ntomorrow\nokay um what can I do about skin picking\ndisorder and other body focused\nrepetitive behaviors have you spoken\nabout it before no we haven't done too\nmuch on it we've done a couple of\nlectures on things like\nOCD um but I'd strongly recommend I mean\nso that's where there's there's good\nlike OCD treatments if it's OCD related\nwhich is my understanding of it\nusually but I think get OCD treatment is\nnumber\none is there any correlation between\nADHD meds and\nburnout you know I haven't seen studies\nabout it but my my guess is damn right\nthere\nis so two things on the one hand ADHD\nmedication May reduce burnout because\nthey make you more effective at\nrestraining impulses and things like\nthat on the flip side ADHD medication in\nsome cases May promote\nburnout\nbecause how can I say this when you've\ngrown up with ADHD and you're not able\nto accomplish\nmuch the limiting factor on your success\nis never stamina or\nendurance right you don't ever get a\nchance to spend a 100% because you get\ndistracted you can't focus whatever so\nwhen people start to focus\nwith things like ADHD\nmedication they sometimes don't realize\nlike what their limits are because\nthey're able to work for now six hours\nat a stretch so cognitive fatigue can\nkind of set in and I see that a lot\nwhere there's a real adjustment to the\nmedication meditation strengths frontal\nloes\nyes okay so thank you all very much for\ncoming today I got to run it's been\nawesome streaming four days this week we\nare going to be maybe streaming once or\ntwice next\nweek um and\nthen oh yeah uh and then so we've got a\nquestion can you explain what Dharma is\nI I heard you mention it when I came in\nyeah so for those of you that are\ninterested in more resources like this\nso first of all we've got a glossery of\nterms and stuff like so you all can\ncheck out our website but we have Dr K's\nguide to meditation as well where we\nexplain what Dharma is how to cultivate\nit what practices to do so part of the\nreason that we have the guides is\nbecause there are common questions for\npeople who are new and so if yall want a\nbasic course if you want to re\ndistill you know the majority of like Dr\nK's stuff into like 12\nhours then check out Dr K's guide that's\nwhy it's there so we have a challenge\nwhen we stream which is that we either\ngo over the basic stuff over and over\nand over again because there's always\nnew people because we're always growing\nit's a good problem to\nhave but if we want to get to Advan\nstuff we need everyone to be able to\ncatch up and what Dr K's guide is is\nit's a place for youall to understand\nthese Core Concepts and how to apply\nthem to your life understand kind of my\nperspective on depression on anxiety on\nmeditation and\nADHD and how can you break apart what's\ngoing on there the Neuroscience the\npsychology the science the spirituality\nall kind of rolled into\none and then we also have coaching spots\navailable if yall are interested so as\nwe were talking about with Destiny like\num so I don't know if this kind of makes\nsense but you can treat a problem like a\npathology like let's say a mood disorder\nor an anxiety\ndisorder or you can build something that\nprotects against it and you can build\nsomething that can protect against it so\ngood example of this is I can give\nsomeone treatment for let's say high\ncholesterol or\ndiabetes and they can do something like\nexercise if they do something like\nexercise it is going to lead to health\noutcomes in a variety of\nDimensions even though it is an\nautomatical treatment they're going to\nsee Improvement in blood blood pressure\ncholesterol diabetes mood all of those\nthings get improved with\nexercise and so what I sort of did is\nwhen I was looking at the emerging\nproblems of the digital age these\nproblems like pornography addiction and\nvideo game addiction and social media\naddiction and I tried to figure out why\nis this stuff getting so bad and what I\nfound found was that they can be\nclassified as discret pathologies but\nthere are some core aspects of life that\npeople are behind on like purpose\nbecause it's hard to find purpose in\ntoday's\nworld because the establishment and I'm\nnot like anti-establishment or anything\nthey're just flaws right the establish\nestablishment is saying go to college\nget a job and if you're you're in the US\nyou end up with a bunch of debt and jobs\nor whatever you can't afford a house\nlike there's a certain prescribed\nformula for Success that doesn't work\nanymore and so we need to find a new way\nto discover those things that give us\npositive momentum in life and once we\nhave that positive momentum just like\nexercise once we have purpose motivation\nDirection then what we see is the mental\nhealth outcomes\nimprove right so\npurpose is inversely correlated with\npornography\naddiction the more purpose you have in\nyour life the less likely you are to be\nhave problems with pornography that's\nwhat that's what our focus is on it's on\nfocusing on these core aspects like EQ\nemotional awareness communication skills\nlike these are the things that lead to\nGlobal improvements and that's why we\nsee 25 to 45% reductions in depression\nand\nanxiety even though it's not a treatment\nit's just you know once you start\nsetting boundaries with people you start\nadvocating for yourself you actually\napply for that promotion\nyou ask your boss for a\nraise you break up with someone that you\nshould have broken up with a long time\nago or what's more common nowadays is\nyou don't go back you learn how to\nresist going back to your\nex that's what I've seen more recently\npersonally it turns out that it improves\nyour\nlife in resisting your ex may lead to\nimprovements in depression and\nanxiety right so if yall are interested\nin that definitely Ely check out our\ncoaching\nprogram um so thank you all very much\nfor coming today hopefully you all enjoy\nthe talk with Destiny and then we also\nhave so for things that are a little bit\nmore Niche like gifted kids or emotional\nregulation for those topics yall should\ndefinitely check out our resource packs\nso what we did is we took some of these\nother topics that are not quite as\ncomprehensive as like depression and\nanxiety and meditation that we didn't\nwant to build a good guide for that\nwe've actually done a lot of free\ncontent on\nand those resource packs are\navailable um so take care everybody and\nhave a good week"
