    "transcript": "so if you want to change your\npersonality it turns out that you\nactually can and the main thing that you\nneed to focus on is instead of trying to\nfix your life fix the way that you\ninterpret and draw conclusions from Life\nevents because the real tragedy of life\nis that we spend a lot of energy trying\nto fix things that involve other people\nwhich means fundamentally they're not\ncompletely but at least partially out of\nour control and then what we end up\ndoing is we ignore all of the\nconclusions that we draw about ourselves\nwe don't think about it we don't work on\nit we don't craft the conclusions that\nwe have about ourselves and so those\nthings develop automatically and then\nthey determine our personality and once\nthey determine their person your\npersonality then they'll DET determine\nthe way that literally interactions get\ninterpreted by your brain they'll\ndetermine your emotional reactions to\nsituations they'll control the way that\nyou behave so if you want to forge a\ndifferent Destiny you need to become a\ndifferent person the good news is that\nthat's actually a lot easier or at least\nmore possible than we realize"
