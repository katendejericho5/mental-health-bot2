    "video_title": "Men Communicate Differently",
    "transcript": "so my favorite example of how men\ncommunicate differently is the negative\nexpression of a positive affection so\nwhen we like someone and we're proud of\none of our homies or our Bros we don't\nsay that to them right in fact what we\ndo is we kind of dog them about it if my\nfriend has been single for a while after\na bad breakup and starts dating someone\nelse and I feel really proud and good\nabout that I don't say hey friend I'm\nreally proud of you and I'm proud that\nyou've been able to find someone who\nsees The Lovable qualities within you\nthat I see I'm proud that you found\nsomeone who treats you the way that I\nthink you deserve to be treated in the\nhistory of humanity I do not think that\nsequence of words has ever been spoken\nby a single man that's not what we say\nwhat do we say we say brah GG Noob\nyou're whipped I guess we'll never see\nyou again and we're smiling the whole\ntime we're not like I know you haven't\nbeen texting me I feel hurt instead what\nwe do is we actually dog on this guy\nwe'll say all this like misogynistic\ncrap but the whole time we're like\nexpressing appreciation and smiling at\nhim"
