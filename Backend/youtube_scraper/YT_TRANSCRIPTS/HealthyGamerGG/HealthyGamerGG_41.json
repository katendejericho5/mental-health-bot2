    "transcript": "people who are frequently the butt of\njokes very frequently do engage in\ncertain kinds of behaviors to keep\nthemselves in that position so you would\nsay hey guys like make fun of someone\nelse you would say something or do\nsomething to stop the behavior if you\nwere unhappy with it and other people\nwill sometimes even do things like make\nfun of themselves or like other kinds of\nthings the interesting thing is I don't\nthink they like it often times they are\nafraid of what happens if they try to\nstop it so if you're insecure and you're\nin a friend group trying to challenge\npeople who are making fun of you can\nsometimes come at a high cost and often\ntimes these people engage in this kind\nof stuff even if like your friends\naren't going to bully you further like\nif you said like hey lay off most people\nwill be pretty nice to you but often\ntimes this comes from like places where\nthey tried that and it didn't work or\nthey're afraid that if they try to set\nlimits like people won't invite them to\nthings anymore and people will ostracize\nthem and stuff like that so they kind of\nfeel like they can't rock the boat and\nso they kind of tolerate a lot of bad\nbehavior"
