    "transcript": "early on I was an intern so fresh out of\nmed school I was seeing a patient in the\nemergency room and they told me that\ntheir parent had just passed away and I\nsaid I'm so sorry for your loss and they\nlooked at me like I was Medusa and they\nsaid my parent had been physically\nabusive my entire life when they passed\naway a week ago it was the most\nrelieving thing I've ever experienced\nand I was like holy CRA that never\ncrossed my mind we assume that all\nparents are good parents and everyone\nmisses their parents when they die\nbecause it's very common right but what\nI learned that day is that everyone's\nexperience of life is different and just\nbecause your life existed a particular\nway does not mean that other people's\nlives existed that way and why do we\nassume this stuff because we don't hear\nor listen the other the experiences of\nother people's lives and that's what\nwe're here to combat and we think that\nbringing the world and the internet\ntogether happens through dialogue and\nlistening"
