    "transcript": "the other primitive part that fomo sort\nof accesses is this desire not to be\nostracized so the world has changed a\nlot but our brain did not evolve for the\nworld that we live in today so as an\nexample you know in the past we lived in\nlike communities of maybe 200 or 300\nhumans these were like tribal\ncommunities or even smaller packs we're\ntalking about like for millions of years\nthis is what humans used to do and so if\nyou sort of think about the price of\nbeing left out or the price of\nostracization it was really really\nsevere right if you kind of fall out\nwith your tribe it's not like you can\njust meet new people on the internet\ntoday you can't just block one person\nand then find a new person tomorrow you\ncan now but you didn't used to be able\nto so what happens is our brains sort of\nrealize that okay being ostracized from\nthe pack like a wolf that gets\nostracized from the pack is basically\ngoing to die"
