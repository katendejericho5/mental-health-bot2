    "transcript": "tldr everybody else seems to be doing so\nmuch more with their life and still have\nenergy left at the end of the day I'm\ntrying my best but it feels like 10% of\nwhat others do and yet again I feel like\nI could sleep for 6 months straight I\nwant to do more help more work more\nsocialize more but I feel like I'm\nrunning on the battery of a small alarm\nclock from the early 90s 30-year-old M\nmale here have been diagnosed with ADHD\nwhen I was 10 um for people forgot about\nit life fell apart struggled all my life\nwith depression and anxiety had therapy\ngot rediagnosis\nnobody here could definitely tell me\nwhat is going on but apparently I still\nhad the impulse to\nshare so yes I have a lot of stress with\nmy studies at the moment I don't\nremember the last time I had a proper\nbreak in the sense that I had no oh I\nhave to do XYZ until XYZ or I'll get in\ntrouble I've checked everything else I\nsleep all right rather active cycle\nevery day go for long walks have stuff\nto do surrounded by people everyday\nrelationship is going well no Financial\nstress or any\nanything blood has been checked lately\nand everything seems fine\nawesome um I might just be stressed but\nthere are so many people around me that\nseem to be doing so much more than I'm\ndoing I know it's hard to compare\noneself to other people but I just feel\nlike what I'm doing every day is so much\nless\nat the end of the day many people even\nseem to have time and space left to\nsocialize hell my battery is drained\nafter 3 hours of interaction oh\ninteresting\ninteresting I\nwonder\nif there is research around\nthis huh predict mental depletion after\na 3-hour delay\nfascinating after 3 hours of interaction\nI would love\nto um or have the feeling that I should\ntake care of connecting with friends\nmore but honestly I just want to be\nalone with my girlfriend at the end of\nthe day and make some music or go for a\nwalk what's wrong with me am I doing\nsomething wrong should I be doing more\nI'm not doing enough I'm I am not enough\nyou know the\ndrill okay so this is a case of a\n30-year-old person diagnosed with ADHD\ndid not get treated started getting\ntreated 26 now they're doing well it\nsounds like they're in a relationship\nthey're advancing in either with work or\nstudying they're in a high stress\nsituation so there isn't a day that goes\nby where they don't think about okay I I\ngot to do this there's a deadline coming\nup etc etc and they feel like they have\nno energy left and other people around\nthem seem to be doing the same amount of\nwork but have energy left at the end of\nthe day so why is this hey y'all if\nyou're interested in applying some of\nthe principles that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday lot of things going on here so\nlet's start with this the first is that\nif you have\nADHD it takes you more effort to do one\nthing than it takes a neurotypical\nperson until you train yourself\notherwise so if we look at the nature of\ndistractability I've got to work on a\npaper open up a Word document start\ntyping and then I get distracted oh I\nneed to find this thing I need to I pull\nthis thing out I start reading it okay\nthis paper is over here I don't\nunderstand what this means I'm going to\nlook at something on Wikipedia once I'm\non Wikipedia on the computer I'm going\nto alt Tab and watch some YouTube highly\ndistractable so if you look at the\namount of time it takes to complete a\ntask it takes one hour of\nwork for a neurotypical person and one\nhour of work for an ADHD person the\nproblem is that the person with ADHD\nspends 4 hours doing one hour of\nwork and so what happens is at the end\nof those 4\nhours you've been like your machine has\nbeen running for 4 hours but you only\nhave a 1H hour yield to show for it so\nif we look at it from an objective\nperspective until people with ADHD learn\notherwise and we'll get to\nthat it literally takes them more effort\nto do the same amount of work so this\nperson is not\nwrong but there's way more to the\nstory the second thing that tends to\nhappen and I see this a lot with people\nwith\nADHD is people tend to flounder for a\nwhile and something happens at the age\nof 26 very common adult ADHD is an\nincreasing diagnosis so it gets missed a\nlot in childhood why because kids with\nADHD are smart if you a smart kid with\nADHD you develop compensatory\nmechanisms so that the ADHD does not\naffect your life as\nmuch and so you actually don't get the\nhelp that you should get if you are\nfailing completely so you're able to\npull off C's instead of straight FS\nbecause even though it takes you 4 hours\nto do one hour worth of work you're so\n smart that you can take that\nhour and you can actually turn it into\ntwo so the ADHD diagnosis gets missed\nthen what happens is as it gets\ndiagnosed later in life and people start\nputting their lives together they enter\nthis period And I want to say it's like\ntwo to four years in like really three\nfour years in where they start to feel a\nton of fatigue and why is that it's\nbecause they're ramping up to a regular\nlife so I don't know if this kind of\nmakes sense\nbut\nyou know when you first start college it\nfeels overwhelming and then you ramp up\nto it right suddenly like you're not\nforced to go to class so you have to\nlearn time management you have to like\nyou only go to class three days a week\nor whatever you have there's a lot more\nlike optional stuff so there's like this\nadjustment\nperiod when I started med school there\nwas one hell of an adjustment I just\nfinished college and then suddenly you\nare learning five times as much\ninformation per week and there's one\nhell of adust m in your first year of\nmed school and then they ramp it up in\nyour second year and now you're learning\n10 times as much as you did in college\nand then they ramp it up more in third\nyear because now in third year you're\nworking in the hospital you don't have\ntime to read all day but you're expected\nto know all of this stuff and that's an\nadjustment so life is a series of\nadjustments and what happens with people\nwith ADHD is since they're so behind in\nlife as they start to catch up and they\nbecome somewhere on the level of normal\nhuman beings if you compare yourself to\nyour peers like they've gone through\nthat adjustment phase and you're still\nadapting so it can feel like it's really\nreally really hard for you to like\nsurvive even though you're surviving it\nfeels very exhausting that will get\nbetter and I see this really with people\nwith ADHD like in year three or four of\ncollege where now they're like they're\nlike playing in the big leagues with\neverybody else and that's just tiring in\nand of itself the third thing that's\ngoing on here is stress so if you sort\nof think about your third or fourth\nyears those are objectively harder than\nyour first or second years in a lot of\nways right advanced\nclasses more intensive\nmaterial you're writing thesis things\nlike that there's like other like like\nkind of advanced stuff generally\nspeaking it can be easier for a lot of\npeople because you enjoy it more\nhopefully but the workload is\nobjectively higher and so when you're in\nthis position of I think this person\nputs it this way I have a lot of stress\nwith my studies at the moment yes I\ndon't remember the last time I had a\nproper break in the sense that I had a\noh I have to do XYZ until X until XY Z\nI'll get in trouble so what I'm hearing\nfrom this person is this person has\nconstant deadlines and hasn't been able\nto take a break so how does that affect\npeople it affects them through the\ncortisol system so what cortisol does is\nbuys me 24 hours of high productivity\nfor a week of exhaustion afterward\nthat's literally what\nhappens so what what cortisol does is\nincreases cannibalizes our things like\nmuscle tissue to give us energy over the\nuh 24-hour period so what we're doing is\nwe're chopping down a wall to get\nfirewood to survive for the next 24\nhours so when you're in a chronic state\nof stress because normally what happens\nis human beings would recover right if\nI'm like hunting in the jungle and I get\nattacked by a pack of hyenas I fend off\nthe hyenas I run away my tribe comes to\nsave me we move a little bit and then\nit's not like there's another pack of\nhyenas there the next day then I like\nrest I relax I catch up on my sleep I\nrecover but in modern society we don't\nget those times we have chronic\nstress so every day I don't my my body\nhas the system that activates that helps\nme get through the next 24 hours but\nthen I don't rest for a week\nafterward and so over time that depletes\nyour ability to do work so why are you\nmore fatigued than your colleagues\nbecause\nliterally you're your body has been\nchopping down walls to for firewood and\nthen you're wondering why am I getting\nmore cold because your walls are gone so\nthis is the next thing that's going on\nthe last thing that goes on with ADHD\nwhy people people feel so\nexhausted is\nthis what is wrong with me am I doing\nsomething wrong should I be doing more I\nam not doing enough I am not enough this\nis the other problem so why is it that\nsomeone with ADHD cannot realize that\nthis is not me why do they assume that\nthe problem is within me instead of yeah\nI'm in advanced courses I'm working\nreally hard I actually object L have a\nlot on my\nplate why don't they think that\nway so if you look at a population of\npeople who have ADHD in\ndepression what you discover is that 70%\nof the people who have ADHD first will\ndevelop depression later in\nlife 3% of the people who have\ndepression first will develop ADHD later\nin life ADHD has a positive effect for\ndepression why is\nthat when a child grows up with ADHD\nsomething very important happens they\nrealize that I'm just as smart as my\nfriends they realize that I'm no\nstupider than anyone else but they also\nsee when they're in the first grade the\nsecond grade they're 6 years old seven\nyears old they start to realize that I'm\nnot able to do what they're able to do\nit's way harder for me to pay attention\nI forget my homework I forgot I had a\ntest I'm just as smart as they are but I\ncan't remember having a test when I sit\ndown to study just like they do I'm just\nas smart as they are but I can't\nactually read the words on the page they\ndon't even realize that right they just\nhave the textbook open in front of their\nmind is all over the place they just\nrealize I can't do this and no one ever\nexplains to them that this is like a\nproblem because you have ADHD your\nattention is different from other kids\nyou're there's nothing wrong what what\nwhat is is wrong with you what's\ndifferent is your attention so what does\na six-year-old\nconclude in the absence of a diagnosis a\ncompassionate diagnosis and some amount\nof explanation there is something wrong\nwith me fundamentally something's busted\nbecause I'm just as smart as they\nare but when I put in four hours I get a\nb and when they put in one hour they get\nan A there's something fundamentally\nwrong with\nme this belief starts at the age of 5 6\n7 remember that often times kids by the\nthe by the age of seven or so with ADHD\nmany of them will not get invited to a\nsingle birthday party and why is that\nit's because they don't wait their turn\non the playground because they're\ndistractable and\nimpulsive so they don't get invited to\nplaces and then there's social\nisolation and then we're also proud of\nkids for what for doing well in school\nso we're not proud of those kids in fact\nwhat happens is those kids like myself\nget taken to teacher conferences and the\nteacher would say you know\nwhat Alo is so smart he just needs to\napply\nhimself if he just tried harder then he\ncould do so much\nmore and so what does the kid feel\nwalking out of that school conference it\nmeans that there's not something wrong\nwith me it's just a lack of my effort\nI'm just like I'm not\nmy IQ ain't low but I'm just\nstupid for not applying\nmyself they don't understand that I'm\nactually applying myself as hard as I\ncan and so the feedback that these\nchildren\nget essentially results in this look at\nthis statement this is\ndamning I am not\nenough I am not enough and when you\ncarry this within you then it shapes how\nyou look at everything else you don't\nconsider the stress objectively because\nin the back of your mind you're not\nenough so it's not the stress or the\nexternal circumstances even though this\nperson intellectually knows that it's\nthe circumstances you guys see\nthis like\nlook intellectually in their post they\nsay I have a lot of stress I don't\nremember the last time I had a proper\nbreak even though they know that they're\nunable to connect those dots one part of\ntheir mind is connecting those dots hey\nthe reason you're tired all the\ntime is because you haven't had a\nbreak they even went and got blood\ntested maybe something's wrong with you\nokay nothing's wrong with me let me just\ncheck there's a part of your brain that\nknows there's nothing wrong with you the\nproblem is that for 26 years of your\nlife you've learned that there's\nsomething wrong with\nyou and those two things\nclash and that's why people with with\nADHD continue to blame themselves even\nthough they're doing a good\njob so if you are in this\npickle couple of things that you can do\nthe first thing that you can\ndo is understand how to be better at\nworking so if you look at\nPsychotherapy for ADHD versus medication\ntreatment for ADHD both of them improve\nADHD the same amount I can someone to\nsend someone to a psych therapist or\ngive them Aderall or a stimulant and I\ncan improve their focus by the same\namount I can improve their outcomes by\nthe same\namount the difference is that if the\nmedication stops the effect goes away if\nwe stop Psychotherapy the effect lasts\nfor 2\nyears after stopping\nPsychotherapy why so what\npsychotherapist will do is teach people\nwith ADHD how to function in this world\ndespite having distractable attention it\nmeans things like get really good with\nyour\ncalendar make a to-do\nlist so one tip that I'll give people is\nthat if you're working on a project find\nall of your materials first and assemble\nthem don't go and look for materials in\nthe middle of your work so if you've got\nsome stuff on Google Drive or\nDropbox open it all up and set it to the\nside or print those papers out and keep\nthem there because if you open up a new\ntab and start hunting for stuff on the\ninternet when you are trying to H write\na paper and you have ADHD you're screwed\nall of your work materials need to be\norganized calendar alarms all kinds of\nstuff you can set up a system that will\nessentially protect you from your\nADHD we dive into this super super deep\nwith Dr K's guide to 8 PhD and doing\nstuff it's a guide about what is the\nscience of doing stuff what are the\ntechniques that you need to understand\nthat will help you do stuff and this is\neverything from like understanding\nemotional blocks to organizational\nsystems so you can get some of that from\ntherapy you can get some of it from the\nguide second thing that you need to work\non with ADHD is your sense of confidence\nor the person that you believe that you\nare essentially the untreated\nof ADHD of growing up with ADHD that's\nundertreated CU then you will form\nconclusions about yourself that will\nsabotage your efforts to do better in\nlife this is something that a\npsychotherapist will help you with and\nwhen I when I work with a a patient with\nADHD what I basically do I have a onew\npunch so I'm going to help with all\nthese organizational skills and I'm\ngoing to work on their confidence so I'm\ngoing to treat this patient as if they\nhave\ndepression\nand if I can get them to believe in\nthemselves again it'll change the way\nthat they look at the\nworld so this is like the key thing to\ndo right so you need to learn the\norganizational tools that will protect\nyou from your\nADHD meditation is also great you can\ntrain your executive function and stuff\nlike that that's what we cover in the\nguide and absolutely go see a therapist\nthird four things you can do you can\nabsolutely like you know go get your\nhormones checked go see a medical doctor\nstart medication if that's what you want\nto do\nbut the beautiful thing is I worked with\na ton of people who have adh2 who are\nvery successful and did not start out\nthat way there is absolutely a\nmethodology to this in this case is\ntextbook and if you're\nsomeone who struggles with this where\neven though you're doing better in life\nit feels so\nexhausting and other people seem to be\nplaying life on easy mode and you're\nplaying life on hard mode you can still\ndown the bosses and beat the level but\nit costs you so much much\nmore and you carry around this idea that\nlike I'm not enough in some way this\nneeds to be fixed both of them can\nabsolutely be fixed with some simple\norganizational skills and like workflow\nkind of stuff you can learn how to study\nwith a distractable\nmind and work on your\nconfidence that's what will ultimately\nhelp you realize like okay I can do just\nas well as someone who's typical in this\nworld I just need to play the hand that\nI'm dealt instead of copycatting\nneurotypical kids that's where ADHD kids\nget\nscrewed"
