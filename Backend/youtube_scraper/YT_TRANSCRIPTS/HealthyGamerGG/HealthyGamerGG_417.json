    "transcript": "and so this is exactly what we're\nmissing in today's world because in\ntoday's world we have a new way of\navoiding shame a way of avoiding shame\nthat does not involve fixing the problem\nand that is the internet right because\nnow if I feel ashamed about something I\nnever have to go back to those people\nright if I feel mortified because I said\npenis instead of weenus at a grocery\nstore I can just go to a different\ngrocery store or I can use grocery\ndelivery and I never have to interact\nwith anyone if I do something stupid in\nmy class it's really easy I can just\nskip class and watch the videos or I can\neven drop the class so now what's\nhappened is our society is structured in\nsuch a way where if we feel shame in a\nparticular situation we don't actually\nhave to correct the behavior to avoid\nthe shame we can just avoid the\nsituation entirely this is exactly the\nproblem that you run into if you don't\nknow how to harness shame"
