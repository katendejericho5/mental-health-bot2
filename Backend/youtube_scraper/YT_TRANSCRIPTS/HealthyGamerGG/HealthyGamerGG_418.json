    "transcript": "so if you really look at the science of\nburnout what you find is it is\nrelational it is a connection between a\nperson and a workplace my boss texts me\nat 10 o'clock at night and asks me for\nstuff this is burning me out then we ask\nour client what do you do when they text\nyou do you set limits with them and do\nyou say hey it's after hours I'm happy\nto get to it first thing tomorrow\nmorning no I don't say that why don't\nyou say that because I'm conflict\navoidant and I'm afraid of what they're\ngoing to think of me and I want to be\nseen as a team player so you never and\nthen how is your boss supposed to know\nthat you're bothered by this because\nsome people aren't so this is the reason\nwe learned this stuff is we started\nworking with creators and we realized\nburnout is a huge problem it's not\ndepression it's not anxiety but what we\nrealize that there's some internal\nthings some internal vulnerabilities\nwhich will intersect with a particular\nenvironment whether it's content\ncreation or a corporate job or even a\nfamily and this is what leads to burnout"
