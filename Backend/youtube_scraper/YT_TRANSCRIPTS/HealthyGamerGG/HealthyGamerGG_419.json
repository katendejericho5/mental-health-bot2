    "transcript": "and the real tragedy here is that if you\nthink about how you go about trying to\nimprove your life what you actually do\nis try to control the circumstances of\nyour life right I want to get a job I\ndon't want to be alone anymore I don't\nwant this person to break up with me and\nwhat we actually don't control at all is\nthe conclusions that we draw from what\nhappens in real life literally the only\nthing that you can control in your life\nis the stuff in here we can't actually\ncontrol whether someone promotes me or\ndoesn't promote me breaks with me or\ndoesn't break up with me but that's\nactually where we spend all of our\ncognitive energy and this is exactly why\nwe end up stuck in life because we put\nall of our energy into fixing things out\nthere because that's really what we want\nright I want to get promoted I want to\nget married I want all of these things\nand that's where we put our energy but\nthe real tragedy is that we don't\nactually pay attention to how those\nevents affect us up here it's the way\nthat we are up here it's our personality\nthat actually determines our destiny"
