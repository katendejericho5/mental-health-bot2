    "transcript": "a ton of the people that I've worked\nwith patients clients even friends who\nare getting married for example will get\nmarried a year from now but they will\ncommit to having a particular suit size\nor dress size that is one or two sizes\nsmaller than what they're wearing right\nnow so they're sort of forcing\nthemselves to have a wedding dress that\nmay not fit them and the shame of not\nbeing able to fit into your wedding\ndress actually motivates you to get into\nshape and this is the key problem is\nthat we've stopped utilizing shame so\nwhat I want you all to do is pick\nwhatever it is that makes you ashamed\nand then try to pick a Target 30 days\nfrom now where you are going to do that\nthing and then ask yourself okay if I'm\ngonna do this or I'm going to do this 30\ndays from now what can I do between now\nand then that would make me feel less\nashamed about myself what can I do\nbetween then and now that will help me\nget good and feel less of that shame and\nharness that motivation that fear of\nshame because it hurts so much to\nactually make progress towards your\ngoals"
