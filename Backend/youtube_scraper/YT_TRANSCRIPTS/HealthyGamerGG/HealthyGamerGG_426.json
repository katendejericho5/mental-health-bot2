    "transcript": "the real antidote to fomo the real way\nto become immune to fomo is to feel like\nthere's nothing missing on the inside\nthe fear of missing out and when we are\nunfulfilled internally that makes our\nminds very very vulnerable to fomo\nbecause we've got these two really\ncritical circuits these primitive\ncircuits in the brain of wanting what\nother people want in fear of\nostracization and fomo tackles both of\nthose and the real challenge is that our\ncortical structures of the brain are\nlogic and all this other kind of stuff\ndoesn't really work at kind of fixing\nthose problems so I encourage y'all to\nreally lean towards your values start to\ntake a couple of small steps and you\ndon't have to go all the way and as you\ndo that you'll start to build\ncontentment and you will start to induce\nfomo in others"
