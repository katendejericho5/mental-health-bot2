    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nstop being a low value male\nnow this may sound surprising coming\nfrom a psychiatrist who's trained and\nhas done clinical work and all that kind\nof stuff because isn't all of this low\nvalue stuff BS from the internet it\nturns out that there is a lot of BS but\nthere's actually a lot of truth to it\ntoo which is very scary and today we're\ngoing to teach y'all where this concept\nof low value mail comes from what part\nof this sort of red pill ideology is BS\nbut shockingly what part of it is\nactually very very valid and lastly once\nwe understand what's the difference\nbetween what's scientifically correct\nand what's kind of going on with people\nwe're going to offer you a road to get\nout of this thinking that you're a low\nvalue male hey just a quick note a lot\nof people will ask us what do I do next\nand that's why we built Dr K's guide\nIt's a comprehensive resource that\ndistills over 20 years of my experience\nboth as a monk and as a psychiatrist and\nit's designed in a way that's tailored\nto fit your needs so if you're\ninterested in better understanding your\nmind and taking control of your life\ncheck out the link below\nso let's start with the BS so if we sort\nof think about this concept of alpha\nversus beta the original researcher who\nsort of looked at this stuff and coined\nthese terms was studying wolves in\ncaptivity and after they published this\npaper and this kind of went wild because\neveryone thought oh my God this person\nhas figured out that in social\nhierarchies there are alphas and there\nare betas but this person actually spent\nthe rest of their life actually trying\nto disprove this and trying to explain\nto people that hey these hierarchical\nstructures are artificial and exist\nwithin captivity the basic point that\nthey sort of made is alphas and betas\nmay exist in something like a prison\nsystem but if you are in a normal\nhealthy functioning Society social\nstructures are a lot more complex but\nunfortunately at that point the cat had\ngotten out of the bag the wolf had\ngotten out of the bag and everyone\nstarted believing this stuff and so then\nthe question becomes okay if this is not\nscientifically accurate why on Earth is\nthis kind of manosphere red pill kind of\nstuff growing and the more and more\nwomen that I talk to whether they be\nclients patients random people from the\ninternet the more that this is becoming\na problem so I've talked to a ton of\nwomen who will say my boyfriend my\nhusband my son especially is starting to\ngo down the red pill rabbit hole and\nthen they're sort of starting to become\nlike really really like condescending\ntowards women hateful towards women\nreally misogynistic and we're not quite\nsure like what to do how do I deal with\nthis person and this is where we have to\nunderstand something really really\nimportant which is that the red pill\nmanosphere sort of section is the one\nplace in society that really validates\nmen and sort of meets them where they're\nat now this is kind of shocking but I\nwant you to think a little bit and if\nyou don't believe me talk to men about\ntheir experiences about this because\nthat's what we've done so right now if\nyou're a man living in today's world and\nyou complain about something and you say\nlike hey my life is hard in some way\nthere's a very good chance that someone\nout there will respond to that with some\nkind of condescension or invalidation\nyou'll hear a lot of talk about how\nSociety is a patriarchy and therefore\nyou don't have a right to complain and\nI'm not saying that Society isn't a\npatriarchy we're not going to kind of\ndive into that sociology what I'm sort\nof pointing out is that when a man in\ntoday's world complains or suffers in\nsome way and voices that complaint with\ntheir frequently met by is an\ninvalidating response and someone's\nsaying well why are you complaining\nyou're part of the majority you're part\nof the patriarchy you have all of these\nadvantages of being a male and I'm not\nsaying that there aren't advantages of\nbeing male or once again that the\nsociety isn't patriarchal but in that\nmoment how does that person feel so I\nsee this a lot in clinical stuff where\nwe see sort of these trauma competitions\nso when I'm working inpatient on these\ntrauma units you'll get a group of\npeople in group therapy and so one\nperson will say I was traumatized in\nthis way and someone else will say well\nthat's nothing I was traumatized in this\nway and so in that moment moment\nsomeone's looking for compassion and\nvalidation and someone else invalidates\nthem and in some situations like it kind\nof makes sense so let's say that I'm\ncomplaining about losing one leg and\nthen someone else sitting next to me can\nsay well what are you complaining about\nyou've at least got one leg I lost both\nof my legs and in an objective sense\nyou're right that like losing two legs\nis probably worse than losing one leg\nbut in that moment it's incredibly\ninvalidating and so the one reason why I\nthink that the manosphere red pill stuff\nis growing and if you're a woman who\ndislikes the stuff or you're a man who\ndislikes the stuff you all need to\nreally understand this the reason it's\ngrowing is it's because the only place\non the Internet or in our society in\ngeneral where people will consistently\nvalidate men's experiences and what does\nthat look like let's understand this\nso if I say hey it's hard to date or I\ncan't find a romantic partner or women\nreject me right so I get judged for\nbeing a creep I get judged in this way\nwhatever the situation is my life is\nhard\nand the red pill folks kind of come\nalong and they say you're right\nyour life is hard that's because you're\na loser that's because you suck that's\nbecause you're a low value male and\nhere's how to fix it whereas the rest of\nsociety says why are you complaining\nyour life isn't hard someone else has it\nworse\nand so this is the one reason if you\nwant to understand why people are going\ndown the red pill Rabbit Hole this is\nthe central point now that we have that\ncontext we can actually tunnel down into\nwhat makes a man a low value male and\nhow to fix it so let's start by\nunderstanding the psychological impact\nof this Dynamic so when you're a human\nbeing and Society tells you that you\nshould be doing well and you are not\ndoing well and if you complain they say\nyou shouldn't be complaining what is the\nprimary emotion that that evokes shame\nright so we see this with like ADHD as\nwell when a kid is told hey if you just\nwork harder you would do so much better\nif you just apply yourself you would do\nso much better what that actually\ninduces in the child is shame we're not\ntelling the child hey there's actually a\nproblem which keeps you performing from\nperforming or telling a child is that\nyour lack of performance is a choice and\nif you behave differently then you'd be\ndoing bad better at life leads to a ton\nof Shame which is why seventy percent of\nkids who have ADHD and depression\ndevelop ADHD first and then wind up with\ndepression later\nand so what effect does shame have on\nsomeone's idea of whether the low value\nor high value it's kind of a silly\nquestion right because the more ashamed\nyou are obviously the more low value\nthat you're you're going to think you\nare and now we also see why red pill\nstuff quote unquote works because if we\nlook at the strategy of the red pill\nmanosphere what they sort of say is yeah\nyour life does suck and by the way do\nthese things and your life will get\nbetter start going to the gym start\nsetting boundaries with people which is\nreally what they're doing cut some\npeople off who are emotionally\nmanipulative\num you know start to get sexier right so\ndo your hair different get better\nclothes and the other really interesting\nthing is I've seen over the last year or\ntwo a lot of people in the manosphere\nand even the toxic manosphere\nrecommending therapy they'll say go get\nyour issues sorted out in therapy and so\nif we sort of look at this kind of red\npill Dynamic all of the things that they\ntell people to do will actually\ncorrelate with an increase in confidence\nand even if you look at the science\nsense of what sort of women find\nattractive or human beings in general\nfind attractive they're attracted to\nconfidence as opposed to shame so I\nthink some of the reason that the red\npill stuff quote unquote works and I\ndon't think it always works or doesn't\neven work well in a lot of cases is that\nthey sort of give people a script from\nif you are ashamed of yourself here is a\nroad to put together your life and then\nyou will feel better about yourself and\nI don't think it's the fact that they're\nnecessarily making more money or the\nfact that they got sexy those things\ndefinitely matter and will definitely\nimprove your you know dating success the\nother the the main thing though is that\nthey really help people improve their\nconfidence and once the confidence\nchanges I think that's the linchpin of\nno longer being a low value male\nso then the question kind of becomes\nokay so why do people get all of the\nshame is it just as simple as their\ninvalidating responses and this is where\nI think that there are a lot of truths\nthat low value males believe or the red\npillars believe that aren't actually\ntrue so one thing that leads to a lot of\nShame is men who go on dating apps and\nget rejected over and over and over\nagain\nso this is something where if you look\nat it like men will say okay like women\ncan get matches all the time but I've\nbeen struggling I I'm on dating apps day\nafter day I swipe out for 600 swipes I\nget one match and so if you think about\nthe amount of rejection that someone\ngoes through on a dating app it's\nastronomical right human beings were not\ndesigned to be rejected like 599 times\nfor one acceptance when I was in high\nschool like I got rejected maybe once or\ntwice and that's like all I had the\nballs for right like you can't just\nchain ask people out and get rejected\nand then in college I got rejected a\ncouple more times the human brain is not\ndesigned for like 600 rejections over\nthe course of six months and so that too\nis shame inducing the really tricky\nthing though is that once people get\nrejected so much they start to formulate\nsome of these beliefs like okay they'll\nhear these statistics like the top 10\npercent of dudes on dating apps get 90\npercent of the dates and so what they\nsort of will reinforce is there's this\nidea of two buckets they're the high\nvalue men in the low value men and I'm\ndown here it turns out that a lot of\nthese things about high value and low\nvalue men are actually cognitive biases\nthat are induced and driven by shame and\nif you really want to stop being a low\nvalue man what you need to do is work on\nyour confidence and get rid of your\ncognitive biases so let's explore this\nstatistic to understand this a little\nbit better\nso there are some estimates that show\nthat actually like the dating ratio on\nsome of these apps is actually ten to\none men to women and so it's not that\nthe top 10 percent of dudes are dating\nnine women each it's that there's 10\nwomen and a hundred dudes and so like of\ncourse in a sense the top ten percent\nwhatever that means are dating ten it's\nstill a one-to-one ratio it's just\nthere's a lopsided number of people in\nthe game the second thing that's really\ninteresting is there was recently a\nstudy that came out that up to 50\npercent of people on dating apps and I\nthink this was primarily looking at\nwomen\nactually use dating apps to for\npsychological reasons that have nothing\nto do with dating so I think what\nstarted to happen is a lot of people\nhave figured out that I can get some of\nmy emotional needs met\nthrough dating apps even if I'm not\ninterested in dating so out of the 10\nwomen on there possibly only five of\nthem are actually interested in dating\nand so then it sort of makes sense why\nlike you know for for 10 women on there\nlike your rejection rate is going to be\nway higher because half the women that\nyou you look at profiles for may not\neven be interested in dating at all the\npoint is that this all reinforces these\nkinds of Statistics which we don't think\nabout right so if you're a dude on a\ndating app today all you're going to see\nis that rejection after rejection after\nrejection after rejection and then\nyou're gonna watch all this like content\non the internet and we gotta talk about\nthat for a second so why does all this\nred pill content like if you watch a\nsingle sort of red pill manosphere kind\nof video you'll notice that all of these\ncontent algorithms will start serving it\nup to you like hand over fist and why is\nthat it's because this content is\nemotionally engaging right so if I'm\nashamed of myself and I think my life\nsucks and anytime I try to go talk to\nsomeone about it if they say you're a\nloser there's the patriarchy go screw\nyourself you have nothing to complain\nabout I'm gonna get rejected from that\nand then here's this pipeline of stuff\nthat validates my experience and that's\nwhat's really beautiful about not\nbeautiful but kind of scary is that what\nthese these algorithms was basically\nfigured out is that in order to keep a\nuser engaged I have to emotionally\nengage them this is why we love cat\nvideos of them doing cute things it's\nall about emotional engagement and so\nwhat happens with some dudes is we have\nthese experiences on dating apps we\nwatch one video that resonates with our\nexperience and then the content\nalgorithm figures it out ah here's a\ndude who feels bad about themselves and\nso they start to prey on that Chain by\nserving you more emotionally engaging\ncontent and then the more emotionally\nengaging content you get the more\ncognitive bias happens right because now\nyou're hearing from one dude after\nanother dude after another dude after\nanother dude and even a lot of women\nright because you'll see those kinds of\nthings and you'll see women say yeah I'd\nnever dated someone who gets below this\nand went out and is this this tall and\nwhatever and by the way if you guys just\nwant to know like statistically right so\nthe number of men who make six figures\nor over six feet tall and have a six\ninch dick is like less than one percent\nof the population and like most of the\npeople out there are not dating that\nperson\nthe problem is that this cognitive bias\nreinforces your beliefs that you have to\nbe in this top one percent to get any\nkind of affection then the problem is\nthat if you believe this about yourself\nyou're ashamed of yourself any romantic\nattempts you make\nare going to be sabotaged not because\nyou're not in the top one percent but\nbecause you're ashamed of yourself to\nbegin with and you don't have any\nconfidence which is what a lot of what\npeople find attractive and so they end\nup shooting themselves in the foot\nif you want to stop being a low value\nman and notice I'm not saying this is\nhow you become a high value man because\nI think a low value man is a combination\nof a pile of Shame invalidation from the\nenvironment and a cognitive bias that is\nreinforced through predatory content\nalgorithms and it's not just the content\nalgorithms that are preying on this\nshame this is also what we see with sort\nof red red pill manosphere kind of stuff\nis what these these algorithms will\nbasically do is they'll bludgeon you\ninto more and more and more shame and at\nsome point the shame gets so high that\nyou're willing to Fork over money for\nsomeone to help you fix this problem\nright so this is why if you look at all\nthe people who are selling stuff they're\ngoing to really be leaning into hey you\nsuck hey life is hard hey you suck hey\nthis is how to be great and then they\nshow all this this fancy stuff with\nthese sexy dudes and sexy women and each\ntime you watch that you feel worse and\nworse and worse about yourself and then\nsomeone comes along and says give me\nthat money give me your credit card\ninformation and I will fix it for you so\nthere's even this darwinian effect from\na business model around these kinds of\nthings I don't know that these people\nhave really calculated it this far I\ndon't think that a lot of them have a\nfundamental understanding of psychology\nbut I think what they've sort of figured\nout is this is what works the worse I\ncan get someone to feel about themselves\nand then if I sort of like give them an\nantidote they'll take it another simple\nway to kind of think about this is if I\ncan dehydrate someone then the\nlikelihood that they'll buy water is\ngoing to be way higher which is why all\nthis content actually induces shame but\ngenerally speaking what we're talking\nabout is abandoning the psychological\ncomplex and this is what we've seen I've\nseen not only as a psychiatrist but when\nwe work at he with like tons of like in\ncells and red pill kind of people this\nis the path we walk to them that walk\nwith them that helps them get into\nhealthy relationships so the first thing\nthat we've got to understand is that the\nreason you're a low value male is\nbecause you think you're a low value\nmale the shame that you carry around and\nthe lack of confidence is ultimately the\nsingle most controllable thing that is\nsabotaging your efforts at relationships\nthe second thing that we've got to\nunderstand is that most of this red pill\nstuff succeeds at helping people build\nconfidence and that's like good in a way\nI think the problem is that it carries a\nnegative and toxic world view that is\nlike very dehumanizing for like half the\npopulation and even for a lot of men so\nI'm not sort of in favor of that but a\nlot of that stuff that they sort of tell\nyou to do I think it's good to do I\nthink if you are not happy about the way\nthat you look you should exercise more\nyou should start eating healthy you\nshould get into therapy you should\nupdate your wardrobe you should do all\nof that stuff all that stuff is actually\nfantastic by all means put together your\nlife but understand that it's primarily\na shame and confidence thing the second\nthing that we're going to talk about is\nI strongly recommend that you sort of\nreduce your red pill manosphere content\nso remember that all this content is\ndesigned to be emotionally engaging and\nsort of induce further and further\namounts of Shame now this is not just as\nsimple as so stop watching stuff well\nlet's walk walk through it a little bit\nokay so here here's the main question I\nwould encourage you to to ask is when I\nwatch this content for an hour what do I\nend up feeling like and what do I end up\ndoing at the end of one hour of\nconsuming this content now chances are\nwhat you'll primarily feel is like\nashamed of yourself but also really\nvalidated and a lot of like righteous\nanger yeah things are hard and uh yeah\nand people don't understand and the\nworld is going to and like oh my\nGod that's how you're going to feel but\nthen the question is do you actually get\nup and do something about it because the\nother problem with this content is it\nsays that women are to blame and the\nworld is to blame which sort of is kind\nof weird because you can't fix that so\nthe problem with a lot of this content\nis that if you really pay attention\nyourself if you've been watching it for\na day or a week or a month or a year how\nmany changes have you actually made in\nyour life because what I found is that\nthe more it induces shame eventually\nmaybe you'll buy a course but I don't\nknow that that's actually gonna fix\nanything but that shame will actually\nget in the way of you making progress in\nlife so I'd highly highly recommend\nseriously just like unsubscribing from\nthis stuff for a while and the last\nthing to consider is just getting the\nhell off of dating apps now I know\ndating apps are super convenient and\nthere's this idea that everyone is using\nthem but I don't know that people are\nusing them successfully so the other\nthing to really think about is that a\nlot of this like stuff that you feel\ncomes fundamentally from the rejection\nof a dating app and there may be some\ndating apps in which this is better but\nI've seen like I've seen plenty of\nhorror stories from all of the dating\napps because there's still some evidence\nthat up to 50 of people are using these\ndating apps to fulfill other\npsychological needs so one simple\nexample of this is sometimes you'll you\nknow match with people who are like\nreally condescending and will like just\nunmatch you or tell you to go screw\nyourself and then unmatch you within\nlike three minutes and then it's like\nwhat what the hell why did you match me\nin the first place people will like log\non and they'll say hey matched hey\nyou're you're a loser screw you you'll\nnever get late and then they'll matching\nyou're like why the hell did you match\nme in the first place and that's because\nthey're using the dating app to sort of\nlike\nsupport or get some other kinds of\nemotional needs met in this case it's\nsort of feeling Superior so when I feel\nfeel inferior or like when other people\ncrap on me and make me feel bad about\nmyself what I'm gonna do is find someone\nelse who's lower than me to crap on to\nmake myself feel better this is like\nBully psychology 101. and so really just\nget the hell off of dating apps and the\nmore that you're on dating apps you've\nreally got to be careful because like\nthere may be sort of a 1 to 20 ratio of\nlike your chances of success of finding\nlike a partner who will like actually be\ninterested in you and then that relation\nthen you know that's just a chance like\nthat one out of 20 people may actually\nbe interested in you and then like that\ncould fall apart so things are super\nlopsided and they really really\nreinforce this cognitive bias and shame\nand then you may be wondering but Dr K\nyou're just telling me to get the hell\noff of dating apps and unsubscribe from\ncontent oh my God how am I supposed to\nexist on the internet because that's\nwhat everyone's doing that's not what\neveryone's doing that's what everyone\nwho isn't in a healthy relationship is\ndoing so thankfully there's like this\ncounter swing that's going on in our\nsociety with things like meetup groups\nor like board game cafes we're starting\nto see the emergence of third spaces\nDiscord is exploding in popularity and\nwhy is that it's because the existing\nstuff out there sucks and some people\nhave figured figured out that oh crap\nthe internet is toxic and even though\nit's hard I have to start like engaging\nwith people in the real world and the\nproblem is that once people like make\nthat shift they don't return to the\ninternet and they don't make content\nabout like dating right they're too busy\nout there dating living their lives\ngetting married having kids which just\nreinforces the cognitive bias of the\ninternet and so I know it's really\ntricky but these are the three things\nthat you really have to do\nwork on your confidence and we have a\nwhole resource pack on confidence and\nkind of how to do that because it's a\ncomplicated and long-term process second\nthing to really think about is really\nlike unsubscribe from some of that\ncontent and the main thing there is\nreally ask yourself and pay attention to\nthe more of this stuff that I watch what\ndoes it inspire me to do because for\nmost y'all there's a decent chance that\nall it inspires you to do is watch more\nof that content and sit around on your\nass or get distracted by video games or\nwhatever else or jerk off and the third\nthing is really stop using dating apps\nor at least take a break for them and\ntry to work on meeting people in other\nways now that's really hard because\ndating apps are so damn convenient but\njust because it's convenient doesn't\nmean it's doesn't suck right like gum on\nthe bottom of chairs and desks is\nconveniently accessible and free that\ndoesn't mean you should be eating it and\nthe same thing applies to dating apps so\nat the end of the day I think that if\nyou feel like you're a low value male\nyou can absolutely stop being a low\nvalue male and that will improve your\nchances of success but it doesn't mean\nthat you need to buy all this BS about\nbecoming a high value male\n[Music]"
