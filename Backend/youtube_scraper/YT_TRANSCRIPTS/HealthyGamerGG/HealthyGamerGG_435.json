    "transcript": "should I use stimulants long term so\nlet's understand why psychiatrists\nprescribe medication psychiatrists\nprescribe medication to achieve a\nparticular outcome given a circumstance\nso if your situation is that I can't\nafford to go to therapy right now I\ndon't have time for therapy I don't have\ntime for bandwidth I can't learn\nproductivity skills I need to get my\nmind to function in 15 minutes then you\nshould take a pill long-term stimulant\nuse I do not recommend there isn't great\nevidence that it is harmful in any\nprofound way it seems to be the most\nharmful during development but if you're\nlike a 25 year old and you get start\nstarted on stimulants and you take them\nfor 30 years there isn't great evidence\nthat that hurts you in a significant way\nI'm not a fan of it but the key thing to\nunderstand is that taking medication is\nmore about your circumstance than it is\nabout your brain so with all mental\nillness and when it comes to mental\nhealth medication is a shortcut\nsometimes it's a necessity I'd say in 30\nof people it's a necessity"
