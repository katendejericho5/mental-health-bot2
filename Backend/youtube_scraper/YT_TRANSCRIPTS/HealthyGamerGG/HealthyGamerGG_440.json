    "transcript": "if y'all want to understand the core\ndefinition this is my take okay I'm not\na personality researcher what's the\ndifference between an introvert and\nextrovert it's where their attention has\na tendency to go extroverts will\nnaturally attend to things outside of\nthemselves which is why extroverts are\nactually more sensitive to workplace\ngossip their mental will be more screwed\nby a toxic workplace because their their\nattention naturally goes towards the\noutside introverts their attention\nnaturally turns inward and so that's a\nkey difference between those two things\nthat's it"
