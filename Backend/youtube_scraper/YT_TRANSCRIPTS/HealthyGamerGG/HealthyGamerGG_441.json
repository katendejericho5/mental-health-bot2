to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is alok canoja just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist today and we'll be talking\nwith another Dr Horowitz that nothing we\ndiscuss on stream today is intended to\nbe taken as medical advice everything is\nfor educational or entertainment\npurposes only\num if you all have a concern or question\nplease go see a licensed professional so\nsuper excited today we've got uh Dr Mark\nHorowitz who's an expert on Depression\nwas one of the authors on a very very\ninstrumental paper that came out uh\nmaybe within the last year in molecular\nPsychiatry about how the serotonin\nhypothesis of depression may not be\nvalid\num so there's like a serotonin\ndeficiency we'll hear from him in a\nlittle bit so we're going to hop into\nthe interview in a minute but we have a\ncouple of announcements so\ncouple days ago we announced that we're\ndoing a workshop on trauma and it turns\nout that we are full so it it took us\nabout eight or nine hours to maybe sell\neighty percent of this the spots\num and so\nI guess we didn't realize that the\ndemand would be so high for this kind of\nthing but it seems like it's really\nreally helpful and a lot of people are\ninterested so you can still use the\ncommand exclamation point trauma\num and\nstill signed up for a wait list I think\nwe're going to probably try to do a\nsecond round or something like that I\ndon't know exactly what's going on but\nif y'all you know didn't weren't able to\nsecure a spot that's okay we're going to\ntry to figure something out it's the\nfirst time that we're running a workshop\nlike this so we're gonna try to figure\nit out I think we're definitely going to\ndo the workshop first and make sure it's\nactually helpful to people and that\npeople really like it and it's it's\nworth the time and energy\num and if y'all miss the boat sorry\nabout that we're working on it thank you\nto everyone who's who signed up already\nwe really really hope that we will make\nit worth your while\nso second thing is uh we've been full on\ncoaching for a couple months but we\nfinally got group coaching spots\navailable so if you all are interested\nin\nsort of like leveling up the skills that\nhave to do with\num\nif you kind of fallen behind in life and\ndon't really know how to find motivation\nor don't really know how to be\nvulnerable or form social connections\ngroup is actually fantastic for that so\ndefinitely check those out\nand without further Ado we're going to\nhop in with Dr Horowitz\num\nall right Mark we're gonna go live here\nin a second okay\nwe're live one second\nthere we go can you just count to 10 for\nme\nuh one two three four five six\nall right so welcome Dr Horowitz\nthanks for having me on here it's great\nto be with you yeah um so let's just\nstart by can you tell me what you prefer\nto go by uh how you like to be addressed\nyou can call me Mark that's fine and\nMark can you tell us a little bit about\nyourself and um what your area of\nexpertise is\nso so I'm a training psychiatrist so\nthis is my training in Australia and\nsome in England most of the time I'm\ndoing research at the moment I'm a\nclinical research fellow in the National\nHealth System in England and I'm an\nhonorary research fellow at University\nCollege London\nuh I run a deep prescribing clinic in my\npublic Hospital uh in London where we\nhelp people to safely stop\nantidepressants benzodiazepines Zed\ndrugs uh and similar uh drugs with\npeople that have anxiety depression or\ninsomnia's their diagnoses\na lot of my research is in withdrawal\neffects from psychiatric drugs and how\nto more safely stop them with a\nparticular focus on antidepressants I\ncame to this work because I had a very\ndifficult time stopping antidepressants\nand other psychiatric drugs and I have\nnever been taught about it in my\ntraining either in medical school or in\nPsychiatry training and so when I\nexperienced it firsthand\none it was the most awful thing that's\never happened to me in my life I hadn't\nhad any warning of it from from my\nlectures and my learning and that really\ngot my attention especially when I\nrealized that there were a lot of other\npeople around the world having similar\nissues and so my entire research and\nclinical practice has now focused on how\nto safely stop these drugs and also\nthat's led to a reappraisal of how\neffective they are what their long-term\neffects are and what alternatives there\nare and I just to give you a brief\nsummary I've I've worked on a project\nthe last few years on stopping\nantipsychotics in people with psychotic\ndisorders this was one of the clinic\nthat I've mentioned and I've also\nstarted\num a company called outro Health which\ndoes a lot of the work that I do in the\npublic health system in the private\nWorld which will open in America next\nyear to help people to safely stop\nantidepressants to start with awesome so\ncan you are you comfortable sharing uh\nyour like some of your personal\nexperience about sort of stopping\nantidepressants and what that was like\nfor you yeah sure so maybe I'll go right\nback to the beginning\num because you know I know whoever's in\nyour audience at least one in six of\nthem will be on an antidepressant\nbecause that's the stats for anywhere in\nthe western world in America in the UK\nin Australia\num so like uh like lots of people uh I\nwent through a period of of very low\nmood when I was in my early twenties uh\nI like to say I'm I'm a I'm a sort of\ncharacter from Woody Allen film I'm a\nneurotic pessimistic ruminatory kind of\nbloke that's just my that's my makeup uh\nI wasn't particularly happy about my\ncourse I was uh doing medical school I\nhad I had a variety of different\ninterests I thought it was very narrow\num and I had a variety of things happen\nto me growing up uh anyway that led me\nto the door of my GP at 21 uh who after\na few minutes gave me an antidepressant\nlike like a lot of people like half the\nworld almost these days\nanyway I tried a few different business\nI ended up on Lexa pro wrestler teleprem\nand I took that drug for about 15 years\nbefore uh even thinking about stopping\nit I had this sense it was good you know\nit was something useful people like me\nshould take a drug like that can I jump\nin for a second please did you find that\nit helped you\nI found that question very hard because\nto answer because when I started it I\nhad lots of side effects it made me feel\num it gave me a funny yawning\nsensation it made me feel a bit dizzy uh\nit made me it gave me a sense\num it was a bit intoxicated I thought\nthings felt a bit different they looked\na bit different\nthe first drug I was given which I can't\nremember which one it was it was an SSRI\nof some sort I went back\ngot another one that also had side\neffects I went back a third time\nand that had side effects but by that\npoint I sort of thought I've been around\nthis I'll just stick with this one\nthey're all imperfect\nuh so the question of whether it\nactually improved things for me I don't\nknow because I spent months kind of\ngoing back in and out I just had this\nidea from I guess from Medical School\nfrom people around me that it was a\nhelpful drug so I just sort of thought\nlook I probably should take this I see\num yeah and and do you know if like when\nyou were taking the medicine people used\nthings like standardized instruments to\nmeasure your progress or things like\nthat like the Hamdi or back depression\ninventory or anything like that\nno no no no no I wasn't given any of\nthose uh okay wow okay\num so I I guess I kept getting refills I\nthink every three months and every six\nmonths and every year\num and I kept I kept taking it\num then I did I moved from Australia\nwhere I was born uh to London where I\ndid a PhD in the neurobiology of\ndepression and how and how\nantidepressants work for for obvious\nobvious reasons I was trying to solve my\nproblems and those are my my family the\nusual way\num and I did a PhD it was quite a\nsuccessful PhD in lots of ways worked\nhard for a few years towards the end of\nthat degree I came across an article\ntalking about withdrawal effects from\nantidepressants and I found that a very\nstartling article because I'd never\nheard about that before I'd never heard\nwithdrawal effects I knew you could have\nwithdrawal effects from benzodiazepines\nand from opioids and I guess it got my\nattention because I thought drugs that\ncause withdrawal effects are drugs that\nyou become dependent on you become\ntolerant to and they're generally not\nvery good for you in the long term but\nI've been walking around on this\nsupposition that antidepressants were\nyou know as safe as chips you know and\nhearing that they had withdrawal\nsymptoms\nyou know sort of shook me out of that\nand I thought well maybe I should try\nstopping them I've been on them for so\nmany years\num and I did want every every uh\ndiligent PhD student does I read every\npaper in the in the area mostly some of\nthem by the professors I was working\nwith I was working they used to\npsychiatry in London at that point in\ntime and they all said uh\ndiscontinuation symptoms from\nantidepressants are mild and brief uh\nyou can stop the drugs in a few weeks\nand there's not major issues you can\nhalve them then halve them again and\nyou're off and I thought oh that doesn't\nsound too bad\nthen although I'm a kind of geriatric\nMillennial I'm still in that group so I\nalso went on the internet to see what\nwhat does the internet say and the\ninternet gave me a very different story\nit said these drugs have been really\nhard to come off it can take people\nmonths or years and people can have a\nreally horrific time doing this and I\nsort of thought uh I'm not sure who to\ntrust here I'm a pretty\ninstitutionalized person I spent my\nentire life can I jump in for a second\nMark so when you were saying that you\nknow people were saying that you can\nhave them and have them again so the the\nyou went to the internet but where was\nyour source of information for the idea\nthat ssris are generally speaking easy\nto come off of\nso so the easier to come off of was from\nacademic articles and guidelines uh\nwritten by professors so that was yeah\nthat was some of them had so not like\npharmaceutical companies like this is\nlike academic medicine that was sort of\nsaying this well they're the same I mean\nI mean they were a lot of these a lot of\nthe academics well they were giving a\nsimilar they were giving a similar story\nyou know on the on the patient\ninformation leaflets of drugs they say\nyou can stop in a few weeks and that\nstory was echoed or similar from\nacademics who were writing uh you know\ndisco hatching symptoms are mild and\nbrief and you can stop them in a few\nweeks uh there was an article which\nsummarized all the major guidance\nwritten by written by Pharmacy academics\nthat said that exactly half of it and\nHarvard again is the kind of uh rule of\nthumb in the in the field and it's still\nit still is can I ask you a little bit\nabout what you mean by Pharmacy\nacademics\noh sorry it was I can give you a\nspecific paper I can't remember it's a\n2013 paper it was a\nIndependent Pharmacies I don't mean I\ndon't mean Drug Company academics a\ncouple of academics I think Americans\nwho went through all the different\nNational guidelines to summarize what\nwhat the guidance was and basically it\nwas half the drug for a couple of weeks\nhalf it again for a couple of weeks so\nthese are these are not\npharmaceutical company academics these\nare academics that focus on pharmacology\nand what they had done is synthesize the\nguidelines so they'd sort of done like a\nmeta-analysis or something like that of\nguidelines from different places and\nwhat's what's your understanding of how\nthose guidelines are formed\nso I can tell you a lot more about that\num so let me so I'll just I'll tell you\nuh so I'll give you some specifics so\nthat I'm not talking in general yeah\nthat'd be great\num up until so I'll talk about UK and\nAmerica I guess a lot of the audience\nwould be American but the UK is what I\nknow the most in the UK up until 2019\nwhen things were changed actually maybe\neven the last couple years of 2022 the\nguidelines said antidepressants can be\nstopped over about four weeks but some\npeople may need longer uh you know\nthat's that's that was the entire\nguidance so a little bit vague but the\nnumber there is four weeks\nuh we know in practice that's what most\ndoctors do because we've surveyed\nhundreds of patients and that is what\nwhat people do uh in America at the\nmoment the American Psychiatric\nassociation guidelines for depression\noff the top of my head I think the the\nwords they use is algorithms can be\nstopped over a few weeks but it may but\nit may be harder for drugs like\nparoxetine and that's what it what it\nsays something like that similar in\nCanada\nand that's present that's present day\nthat's the current guidelines in America\nand Canada in England there's been a\nshift but I'll save that for when we get\nthere in the story where do those\nguidelines come from I know exactly\nwhere it came from in the UK because\nthere was a freedom of information\nrequest made to the writers of of the\nguidelines and it came from The\nFollowing\nthere is a study conducted by the\nmanufacturer of fluoxetine which stopped\nantidepressants abruptly and followed up\nwithdrawal symptoms for a week and that\nshowed a very high rate of withdrawal\nsymptoms from from different drugs for\nparoxetine 80 for sertraline 60 that was\nand and based on that study the\nguideline writers in the 1990s I think\nor 2000 said that's too fast stopping\nabruptly is too fast and they came up\nwith a number of four weeks by consensus\nso the committee sat around and said\nwhat do you think four weeks is about\nright so that wasn't Based on data they\njust they had a piece of data that said\nsudden stopping is too fast so let's\npick a number and we're just kind of\nassuming that that won't induce\nwithdrawal\nexactly that's exactly it so it was what\nwould be called expert consensus and not\nbased on any empirical studies okay\nthanks for sharing that that's okay I'll\njust add to that\num because the guidelines also said and\nthis is a really important point I'm\nglad you're getting into the specifics\nthe guidelines also say they still say\nit in America they did say in the UK\nthey've now been adjusted to say\ndiscontinuation symptoms from\nantidepressants are brief and\nself-limiting over about a week so uh so\nno mild and self-living over a week mild\nin severity and uh and brief with it\nwith the Proviso sometimes they can be\nmore severe especially if the drugs are\nstopped abruptly so those those that\nphrase mild and self-limiting mild and\nself-limiting is in every guideline it's\nin America it's in Canada it's in\nAustralia it's in the UK\nthat phrase mild and self-limiting uh\nemanates from different papers put out\nby a drug company uh meeting organized\nin the 1990s that meeting was uh\norganized because there was starting to\nbe a report or withdrawal affection\nantidepressants\nand we know that the market for\nbentodizer beams outside of America was\nruined by withdrawal effects people were\ngetting dependent and tolerant it was\ncausing a lot of bad press\nthey wanted to make sure that that\ndidn't happen for antidepressants I\nwould think that's their motivation\nbecause they convened a group of\nacademics British and American and they\ncoined the phrase discontinuation\nsymptoms\nto replace the scarier sounding\nwithdrawal symptoms but the accurate to\nhim and they they wrote six different\nacademic papers with fancy authors from\nuh Harvard and Stanford and and\ndifferent uh ivy league universities\nsaying that antidepressants\nadded present discontinuation effects\nwere mild and self-limiting and they\nwere and they printed off those papers\nand they circulated them to American and\nBritish doctors and that that entered\nthe Lexicon so I'm curious when you say\nlike there were people from Harvard and\nStanford involved can you say more about\nthat\nsure I can I can I can show you the\npaper so uh one of the papers was\nwritten by\num Rosenbaum who I believe was at\nHarvard at that time uh one of the\npapers was written by Alan Young Who was\na Institute of Psychiatry the equivalent\nand Ivy League equivalent University in\nuh in England\num and in these papers they talked about\npeople who had come off antidepressants\nso you smiled it sounds like you\nrecognized that person he's at the end\nof his career\num he was he was featured in a\ndocumentary broadcast in the BBC a few\nweeks ago he talked about even writing\nthat in a paper\nled to him receiving pushback from his\ncolleagues although that was a paper\nthat was paid for by by drug companies\num\nwhat I'm sorry what was in the paper\nso that in the paper it was a\ndescription of discontinuation symptoms\nfrom antidepressants in which they were\ndescribed as as mostly mild and\nself-limiting uh and I and and that that\ndata was based on short-term use so the\nclassic trial for antidepressants you\nmight be aware is you spend six to eight\nweeks on the drug and that's that's the\ntrial that's what they publish\nin some of those trials they stopped\nantidepressants and they found that in\npeople that stock antidepressants after\nsix to eight weeks most symptoms were\nmild and self-limiting so not all of\nthem let me jump in for a second so what\nwe're sort of saying is that there's a\npaper and just for full disclosure uh\nJerry Rosenbaum was one of my psycho\nFarm mentors\num so I trained at his institution and\nhe was chief of Psychiatry at the\nhospital that um I I think that's\ntotally fine I think Jerry would\nactually love this conversation I think\npart of what he taught me is to really\nquestion this kind of stuff and even in\nterms of our psychoform mentorship he\ntaught me a lot of stuff that was\noutside of the guidelines\num and it's actually partially because\nof his training that I'm loving to talk\nto you now uh but if there's some kind\nof bias there you know I'm sort of\nsharing it and then we'll see but I just\nwant to make sure I understand you so it\nsounds like the the data\nthat ssris have mild withdrawal symptoms\nand are self-limiting come from studies\nwhere we're using ssris for a short\nperiod of time\nand the picture is different I'm\nguessing we're going to hear this the\npicture is going to be different if\nyou've been on it for 15 years versus\neight weeks and that those two things\nwill result in a differential profile of\nwithdrawal symptoms\nbut please keep going you've got it\nexactly it's a pleasure to speak to you\num uh exactly so they they said things\nthat were true it is true that after six\nto eight weeks most symptoms are mild\nand self-limiting it's not I should just\nI should point out that just take an\nexample uh in some of those patients it\nwasn't mild symptoms so for example\ntaking venlafaxine Effexor very common\ndrug in America after eight weeks uh I\nthink four percent of people had very\nsevere withdrawal symptoms uh and that's\nthat is that is rated by the\nmanufacturer of the drug so it's it's a\nit's a it's a drug company study in\nother words just after eight weeks some\npeople not not a huge amount but a\nsizable proportion 1 in 25 having very\nsevere effects\num but the major point you've already\ngot is exactly these are short-term\nstudies the reason why people have\nwithdrawal effects from drugs is because\nthe brain adapts to a drug it gets used\nto it that's what the process of\ndependence or physical dependence is and\nthat causes tolerance when you stop the\ndrug you get withdrawal and of course\npeople that have been smoking for six\nweeks have less withdrawal flexibility\nis working for 10 years and the data now\nshows up for antidepressants if you've\nbeen in using antidepressants for less\nthan six months there's a much lower\nrisk of withdrawal than if you're using\nthem for three years in fact there's\nkind of uh not quite linear but but kind\nof there's a ceiling effect can I can I\njump in again so are you okay with\ninterruptions and questions along the\nway\nso I've got a question a couple\nquestions for you so I've had patients\nthat I prescribed ssris to\nand um just to give you some context so\na lot of people actually come to me to\ncome off of medication as well so my\narea of Interest I don't know if you are\nfamiliar with this but um is primarily\nactually complementary an alternative\nmedicine so evidence-based\ncomplementation and then I started this\nwhole YouTube twitch thing and and sort\nof focus on technology addiction now but\nI spent a long time in sort of my\nresearch areas and and sort of what\nlanded me at Mass General was that kind\nof stuff\num and so I I would frequently get\npatients who want to actually come off\nof medication\nand we're really interested in sort of\nlike holistic perspectives and I would\nsort of add evidence-based complementing\nalternative medicine\nand I found that it was quite effective\nso I'd say that like 80 percent of\npeople in my practice would be would be\nnot taking any medications by the time\nthat we're kind of done\num\nI did however see you know a portion of\npeople who if we tried to pull them off\nof their SSRI\nI would assess them for SSRI withdrawal\num and and the the thing that was kind\nof confusing was I would see this\npattern quite often this was with some\npatients and I'm just really curious\nwhat you think about this they wouldn't\nhave withdrawal so they would actually I\nwould taper it off slowly over time and\nwe'd sort of see if there's emerging\nwithdrawal symptoms so I don't know that\nI followed like a four-week kind of\nthing it's like let's cut down your dose\nand see what happens and whether you\nfeel anything or not they'd actually\ncome completely off of the the SSRI\num and I think probably part of the way\nthat I did that is based on some of\nthese like withdrawal papers and other\nprimary evidence as opposed to\nguidelines of discontinuation of ssris\nbut let's say in around six months or so\nthey would get a recurrence of whatever\ntheir Depression was what's your\nunderstanding of why something like and\nthen if we restart the SSRI their\nsymptoms improve so what I'm kind of\ncurious about is like what do you think\nis going on there\nso so I'm going to take a step back and\nfor some of the things that you've saved\num what a lot of people think is slowly\nwhen it comes to tapering is not as slow\nas as you need what a lot of people\nassume is not withdrawal is is not so\nclear-cut so let me just take a couple\nof steps back maybe and talk about that\num it's really interesting to hear about\nyour practice it sounds it sounds very\ninteresting it sounds like you're doing\na lot of good work in this area\num so I say that the guidelines said to\ncome off over four weeks so that that\ndoesn't that's not it no longer says\nthat in the UK because there's been a\nvery big I'm not sure which papers\nyou're looking at\num but there's been a very big change in\nin guidance and practice in the UK and\nthat comes from an understanding of how\num antidepressants affect the brain and\nwhat's what's the most effective way to\nstop these drugs and and very briefly\num there's now some observational\nstudies there's some theoretical studies\nand they're starting to be randomized\ncontrolled trials with the following and\nthis is what the guidelines on the Royal\nCollege of psychiatrists now say in\nEngland and also what the nice\nguidelines say which which guide uh\ntreatment now for for all doctors they\nsay three things they say one\nthat any business should be tapered\ngradually and gradually means months and\nsometimes years not weeks for people\nthat are long-term users number one\nnumber two that the rate should be\nadjusted to the individual and that if\nthere are withdrawal symptoms uh you\nshould pause go back go slower adjust\nthings and number three\nfor the for the final few milligrams you\nneed to go a lot slower and that's\nbecause so I'm going to talk about a\nlittle bit more the hyperbolic pattern\nof relationship between the dose of an\nantidepressant and its effect on the\nbrain so that very small doses have\nlarge effects I mean you've got to go by\nby slower and slower things at some\npoint I can inflict on your audience a\ngraph to show what I'm talking about let\nme just jump in and so so if we sort of\nthink about this principle of\ndiminishing returns right so generally\nspeaking if we look at SSRI dosing or\njust any medication dosing there's\ndiminishing returns so taking let's say\n10 times as much of the medication\ndoesn't give you 10 times the effect for\nmost medications and so what you're kind\nof referring to is if you sort of think\nabout it there's the biggest effect from\nthe smallest dose and the higher and\nhigher we go the less of an effect that\nwe get and so what you're sort of saying\nis that since the smallest amount\nactually gives you the largest\npercentage effect that last bit of\ntapering should actually be the slowest\nbecause that's when we're going to\ninduce the highest level withdrawal did\nI understand that correctly you nailed\nit okay perfect so keep going uh can I\nshow a graph to emphasize how small it\ndoes actually has has that effect\nbecause I think people you know what\nyou're describing is\num uh the let me just do this what\nyou're describing is the law of mass\naction essentially that very small doses\nhave large effects when there's no other\ndrug around because every receptor is\navailable so here's an example uh\ntelegram I don't know if you can see\nthat so telegram's A very common\nantidepressants this is effect on the\nserotonin transporter oh but you can\nreally think of it as effect on the\nbrain and exactly like you've just\ndescribed as a law of diminishing\nreturns you said it exactly right the\nmost common dose prescribed is either 20\nmilligrams or 40 milligrams it's these\ntiny doses that have large effects so\nfor example two milligrams will actually\nhave half of the effects of 20\nmilligrams this graph is based on\nnuclear Imaging of the drug in people's\nbrains but it's also reflected in\nclinical effects if you look at effects\non symptom scores or effects on adverse\neffects or side effects it follows the\nsame pattern it seems to have relevance\nI'm laughing because\num Dr Rosenbaum said something to our\nclass once that everyone was very\nsurprised about and he said using sub\ntherapeutic doses of medication can\nsometimes be very effective and we were\nall very confused by that because we had\nbeen taught in the guidelines right that\nCitalopram has a minimum\num\nthe sort of like effective dose or any\nSSRI but in his clinical experience he\nwas like sometimes you can actually get\na lot with sub-therapeutic Doses and we\nwere confused because we use the word\nsub therapeutic in our system which\nsuggests that it is not sufficient to\nget some kind of value yeah so remember\nyou remember the word therapeutic means\nwhere it comes from therapeutic means\nthat a drug company has paid for the\nmarketing authorization for a specific\ndose for specific indications when you\ngo to the FDA you can't just say I want\nto Mark it's a telegram you have to say\nI want a market to teleprime at 20\nmilligrams a major depressive disorder\nand then you do studies on 20 milligrams\nso the reason why you think 20\nmilligrams is therapeutic is because\nthat's what the FDA has improved the\nmanufacturer's telegrams to sell so it\nis kind of it's not a chemical meaning\nit's kind of uh you know a financial or\neconomic or a bureaucratic meaning and\nyou can see I can see I don't know if I\nI mean what about a clinical meaning\nwell we can we can get into what the\nclinical effects of antidepressants are\nin more detail and I and I that's\nprobably a longer conversation but yes\nthe the the the FDA would say\num 20 milligrams shows a statistically\nsignificant difference from Placebo and\nthat's why it's defined as therapeutic\nyeah right so if I'm just sort of\nthinking about you know designing a drug\ntrial myself I would want to pick a dose\nthat is on the higher end of your curve\nbecause that would make it more that\nwould make it an effective dose for more\npeople on average\nright I mean so drug companies do look\nat these kind of graphs and they do make\ndecisions based on things you've just\nsaid they they're thinking also we don't\nwant to go too high up on the curve\nbecause that might cause more side\neffects right so I I think it makes\nperfect sense if you're sort of thinking\nabout you know as side effects kind of\nincrease but generally speaking I want\nto say like linearly maybe I'm wrong\nthere but I I think if you're sort of\nlooking at where's The Sweet Spot that\nwill help the most number of people I\ncould totally see why even looking at\nthis graph you would pick\n20 milligrams right because that's where\nyou get 80 saturation of whatever so the\ndrug is really working a lot and after\nthat point you start to get diminishing\nreturns yeah yes you can make an\nargument like that yeah sure sure yeah\nsomething like that and you can sort of\nsee also why maybe using higher doses\nwouldn't add a whole lot more exactly\nwhen people start to increase the dose\nit's often more about the clinician's\ndesperation to do something rather than\nany any firm science and I and I agree\non this with uh Professor Rosenbaum that\nsmaller doses may have almost as big\neffects as larger doses I think there's\ngood good reason to believe that yeah Dr\nHorace can can we actually be taking\neven a further step back\nyes\num and and you don't if you're done sort\nof uh screen sharing I was going to show\nI was going to show a bit more of what\nwhat goes on here so the most common the\nmost common approach to stopping\nantidepressants is to halve it and then\nHarvard again so 20 milligrams of color\npram you'd go to 10. you can see there's\na small reduction in effect on the brain\nsome people get some withdrawal symptoms\nif you go from 10 to 5 a little bit more\nif you go from five to zero which sounds\nlike a very small dose actually what\nyou're doing is throwing people off a\ncliff that they can't see and people\noften end up in a screaming mess at that\npoint at that point a lot of doctors\nwill see what they think is relapse the\nfact that someone needs the drug because\nthey're coming in saying I can't sleep\nI'm having panic attacks I feel anxious\nand they're often put back on the drug\nand told that they need this but if you\napproach this in a more rational way you\ncan see it would make more sense what\nI've done here is drawn horizontal lines\nrather than the vertical lines before\nthat are equally spaced so equal\nreductions of effect on the brain\nrequire a slightly more peculiar pattern\nof reductions these reductions would get\nsmaller and smaller and go down to very\ntiny final doses so you can see that so\nthat this final reduction causes the\nsame size in change in effect on the\nbrain you need a very tiny dose less\nthan one milligram in order that this is\na these are evenly spread out reductions\nand it's interesting and you could for\nsome people these reductions may be even\ntoo big you need to have intermediate\nbetween these what is really interesting\nis over 25 years on the internet in\npeer-led forums patients have worked\nthis pattern out by trial and error and\nthis is what they recommend and you may\nyou may or may not be aware that there\nare hundreds of thousands of people\ncurrently on peer support website lights\ngetting advice on how to come off these\ndrugs and and what and the solution\nthey've worked out follows this exactly\nthat's super cool\nso um let me ask you just like let's\ntake a step back so you uh you had a\npaper in molecular Psychiatry that I\nabsolutely loved\num that sort of was a I think it was a\nmeta-analysis of meta-analyzes about the\nserotonin hypothesis of depression so\ncan we just start with what do you think\ncauses actually let me ask one last\nquestion about that other thing and then\nI want to take a step back so in the\ncase of someone who tapers off of let's\nsay within a month and they don't\nexperience any withdrawal symptoms and\nthen their depression comes back\ncomes back quote unquote in six months\ndo you think that that is a Resurgence\nof whatever the underlying pathology of\ndepression is or do you think that is\nmore tied to withdrawal in a different\nway so so let me so I didn't get into\nthat before let me get let me get into\nwithdrawal symptoms so uh withdrawal\nsymptoms what are so what are they\nthey're there because your brain's used\nto a higher dose of the drug you reduce\nthe dose of the drug you drug you're\nplaying your brain misses the drug you\nget withdrawal symptoms withdrawal\nsymptoms can be either physical or\npsychological I feel like the physical\nsymptoms get more on the uh get more\nattention dizziness headache brains out\nyou know they're they're much harder to\ndistinguish so they're easier to\ndistinguish from anxiety and depression\nbecause they're very different although\noften they get missed because no one\nasks about them but the most common\nwithdrawal symptoms are psychological\nlow moves anxiety panic attacks crying\ntrouble sleeping becoming suicidal how\ndo we know that those are withdrawal\neffects because in people that are given\nantidepressants for reasons other than\nMental Health problems EG pain the\nmenopause they also get those withdrawal\nsymptoms if you think more broadly about\npsychoactive drugs like recreational\ndrugs we know coming off cigarettes\nalcohol MDMA all involve psychological\nsymptoms so we will say that they're\nsure that they see recurrence or return\nsomeone's condition I always say not so\nfast because there can be very big\noverload uh because we know all this\ninformation I'm with you so that's why I\nmean I'm not assuming right that's why\nI'm asking the question so that what I'm\nreally curious about is the time right\nso let me get to that another thing yes\nlet's say like six months out right\nlet's say that you don't have a return\nof suicidality or whatever but then\nyou've got essentially remission of\npsychological symptoms if you score\nthese people using standardized\ninstruments\num you know they they don't qualify and\nsymptomatically they don't really\ndescribe a whole lot they're doing\npretty well and then six months later\nlow mood anxiety starts to come back\nwhat's your understanding of like what's\ngoing on there like what do you think\nthat is is that still withdrawal are we\ntalking about so I'll tell you what it's\nknown and what I've seen and what the\nuncertainty is so in the textbooks it\nsays withdrawal comes on five half-lives\nafter antidepressants are removed and so\nit's two to five days for most\nantidepressants and it's uh several\nweeks or a couple months of fluoxetine I\nI see in practice all the time that\nwithdrawal effects are delayed there's a\npaper in molecular Psychiatry where they\nperformed a meta-analysis of Serotonin\noccupancy studies and they found that\nwhile plasma levels of antidepressants\ngo down in a few days reduction in\ninhibition of the serotonin transporter\nthat is the activity in the central\ncompartment was much slower and they\nhypothesized maybe the reason for the\ndelay in withdrawal symptoms in some\npeople is because the drug is sticking\naround in the brain for much longer than\nit looks like it's sticking around in\nthe in the peripheral blades so I I\nlooked for example at sertraline the\nhalf-life of search lean in the blood is\na day so it's all gone in five days but\nif you look at these studies the\nhalf-life of it in the brain is more\nlike a week or two in other words it's\npossible that it takes a couple of\nmonths or three months for it to leave\nthe brain and that's why you might have\nwithdrawal effects several weeks or even\nmonths afterwards because I've seen that\na few times people people have onset\nthat are delayed so so I mean I I know I\nwould even go a little bit further so\nyou're talking about the serotonin the\ndrug remaining in the brain but I think\npart of what we know about ssris is that\nit's not the concentration of the drug\nitself that leads to the therapeutic\nbenefit which you may question that\ntheory even is a therapeutic we'll get\nto that in a second but let's just\nassume for a moment that ssris do have a\ntherapeutic benefit in some people the\ninteresting thing right is that you\ncan't give someone one pill of an SSRI\nand they'll feel better tomorrow the\nreason that it takes six to eight weeks\nto see A Change Is this is my\nunderstanding and I I don't have a PhD\nin neurobiology of you know depression\nand stuff like that but even I know that\nthere are actually epigenetic changes\nand transcription changes in the cells\nthat result in this is why it takes an\nSSRI two months to hit maximal effect so\nwhat I'm kind of curious about is if\nwe're talking about sort of genetic\ntranscription changes\num\nis it possible that the reason that\nwe're seeing a Resurgence of depression\nis that whatever these long-term\ncellular Machinery that gets built takes\na couple of months to kind of disappear\nnah sorry that's not quite true he's\nhe's what Anthony depressants do this is\nweek by week following what they do uh\nthis is depression score this is this is\na meta-analysis done by a group that\nworks with drug companies this is a drug\ncompany study this is Placebo this is\nantidepressant\nweek by week people on Placebo go down\nevery week with depression scores uh\npeople on how your presence go down a\nlittle tiny bit more every week There's\nNo delay it's you could say there's a\nthreshold maybe somewhere and then it's\nthere but really the effect most of the\neffect happens in the first two weeks so\nI I think this is uh you could say the\ncumulative effect is bigger at six to\neight weeks yes but but all the stories\nyou're talking about epigenetics those\nare I would say they're Just So Stories\nwe could talk about why but but I I\nthink because if they if they're true\nfor any person they're also true for\nPlacebo because Placebo is having about\n85 percent\nso it's a little bit hard follow what\nyou're saying\num and and so I I mean I I saw a paper\nor not recently but you know I've read\nseveral papers about how 70 to 80\npercent\nof oh so that that's well hold on a\nsecond okay so let me respond to that so\na couple things one is that\njust because Placebo does the same\ndoesn't mean that there isn't a\nmechanism of epigenetic change or\ntranscription right so the mechanism is\ncompletely different from the fact that\nPlacebo does it\nso I still am kind of curious about\nwhether you know what's responsible for\nthat long-term change and it could\nabsolutely be cellular transcription\nsure you know I'm also very well aware\num that and maybe this is you know\npreaching to the choir here that\nuh you know some meta-analyzes more\nrecently really suggest that up to 70 or\neven more 80 of the therapeutic effect\nof ssris is from something like Placebo\nor is non-pharmacologic let's put it\nthat way and that really only 20 to 30\npercent there's some meta-analyzes that\nshow that ssris don't do a whole lot\nthere's a big reduction but a small part\nof that reduction is actually\npharmacologic in nature and most of it\nis non-pharmacologic I wouldn't jump\nstraight to Placebo but you can sort of\nsubstitute the two I think it's a little\nbit more nuanced than that so maybe we\nget into that I think I think they they\nI think that the placebo the exactly I\nlike your phrasing I agree with it that\nthe non-pharmacological effects I think\nexplains between 80 and 100 of the\neffect of antidepressants but that's a\njust to get back to your question I\nguess I could say yes the reason why you\nget delayed withdrawal effects might be\nbecause of flow-on effects from the\nantidepressants whether that's\ntranscription reprogenics yes I can\nagree to that I think that could be why\nwe don't really understand why the only\nthing that I would say is I have now\nseen delayed onset withdrawal effects so\nmany times I can't ignore it I'm not\nsaying though it must be withdrawal\neffects it depends on the nature of the\nsymptoms so I'd like to go through with\nwhoever you're talking about what were\ntheir symptoms before their side of the\ndrugs what are those symptoms now to\nthink about it clearly yeah let me just\nactually pause for a second and check in\nwith chat because I recognize that I'm a\npsychiatrist and you're a psychiatrist I\njust want to make sure that everyone is\nwatching so for those of y'all that are\nwatching like what percentage of this\nconversation are you following do you\nguys want us to like\nsimplify it a little bit sorry\num and let's just like check in with\npeople and and I mean like I'm loving\nthis uh mark\nokay so people are following between 70\nand 90 80 okay so I think that's really\nawesome okay so some people are\nfollowing like 25 so okay 44 now people\nare getting creative okay so I I think\nwe've got a pretty educated audience my\nguess is that we're averaging somewhere\naround 75 and this is a study that's\ndone by me\nso let's actually take a step back for a\nsecond uh Mark if that's okay and\ninstead of digging into the research\nwhich is great okay so a lot of people\nare 70 to 75 no do Max science okay\nlet's take a step back we can still do\nmore science but why don't we start with\nthis we have this conception of\nsomething called depression and let's\ncall it clinical depression for a second\nwe have diagnosable illnesses that we as\na field in medicine say that this is a\npathology this is an illness this is\nsomething that yeah would hopefully\nbenefit from treatment what's your\nunderstanding of what causes depression\nassuming that you even and if you don't\nagree with the construct itself we can\neven take a further step back let's\nlet's let's let's let's let's let's play\nwith it and deconstruct it so you know\nfirst of all I want to put my\ncredentials here on the table so I've\nstudied depression that was what my PhD\nwas on it's what I deal with a lot in my\nclinical practice but I want to say I\nhave been diagnosed personally with\ntreatment resistant depression and\noffered electroconvulsive therapy\nlithium and admission so I want to say\nyou know what I whatever I'm saying you\nknow I'm not on this side of the desk\nand everyone else on that side of the\ndesk I'm on both sides of the desk I've\nbeen there I've got the top the top\ndiagnosis you can get in the field so\nI'm not you know I just I want to say\nwhat I've learned about my own\nexperience and what I've learned from\nresearch I always say people always say\nto me\num you know after the serotonin paper\nthe umbrella review and molecular\npsychology well if it's not low\nserotonin you know what the hell is it\nthat causes depression and I say you\nknow what would your grandmother say\nwhat would your grandfather say they\nwould say people get depressed\ndemoralized despairing and hopeless when\nthings are very hard overwhelming and\nexhaust Your Capacity to cope\nand that's what the research shows if\nyou look at the number of stressful life\nevents that someone has experienced in\nthe last year you can predict with great\naccuracy where they'll become depressed\nor not if you experience loss of a loved\none a diagnosis of a new illness lose a\njob\nthere's always intangible poverty job\ninsecurity You can predict the risk of\nwithdrawal the risk of having depression\nthe other factor is how neurotic you are\nand Neurosis means basically how\nsensitive you are to stress so I always\nsay you know Barack Obama incredibly\nresilient uh me not very resilient uh\nyou know and everyone everyone else in\nbetween\num so you know I think the data is very\nclear that it's that it's it's it's the\nthe events in our lives that determine\nwhether we become demoralized and\ndespairing and at some point you get\nenough enough points on a score to to\nsomeone to say you've got major\ndepressive disorder the other point I\nbring in is there's a great study done\nwhere they followed people uh for 45\nyears and and and gave them diagnostic\ntests uh to see whether they had mental\nillnesses so have a guesser lock by the\nage of 45 there's a group a thousand\npeople random sample uh people born\nconsecutively in a hospital in New\nZealand have a Guess What proportion\npeople met the criteria for mental\nillness by the age of 45. 75 percent\nplus 86 percent of that 86 most of them\nwere had major depressive disorder or\nanxiety and we're talking about\nhistorically have met criteria right\nwe're not talking about today meat\ncriteria which so that's overall so\nevery five years they got researchers to\ngo in give them the DSM ICD yeah it\nmakes perfect sense criteria yeah so by\nthe age of 45 cumulatively exactly all\ntogether it was 86 so not every moment\nand basically what they're saying is\nalmost everyone gets depressed or\nanxious but you know I ask everyone in\nthe audience ask you cast your mind\namongst your friends and family who\nhasn't had a periods you know of two\nweeks of feeling terrible\num you know lying in bed not being able\nto do things I've got one friend he's\nvery cheerful he's never been down I\nhate his guts everyone else I know has\nhad that have had that happen in their\nlives in other words this gets to me to\nthe key question which is\nis depression a normal response to\ncircumstances in Life or is it the sign\nof an abnormal brain and I would I would\nI would say an abnormal brain you know\nmeans that's an illness that's a that's\na pathological State I would say if 70\nor more of of people have this event\nthen it sounds like a pretty normal\nresponse to certain circumstances not\nthe sign of pathology or something\nabnormal although it can feel although\nyou know it can damn well feel like that\nbecause I've had people who've gotten\nupset at me saying this they say you\ndon't know what it feels like to be\ndepressed the answer is I do it can feel\nlike an illness it can feel like you you\nknow can't move your body every thought\nis black it can absolutely feel like\nyour brain is broken\nyou know but if you zoom out I think you\nknow The Human Experience involves some\nvery unpleasant emotions you know I feel\nlike I've had a fair share being very\nBleak being despairing being suicidal I\nthink that's you know that's a part of\nBeing Human it's you know I've been\nwriting letters of Complaint to the to\nthe manufacturers for a long time uh\nthat's that's sort of built in and so I\nyou know I would you can hear I'm\nquerying this idea that it's an illness\nthat it's a discrete\num condition like a like heart disease\nor like high cholesterol and then the\nlast point I'd make is it is clearly you\nknow these these these uh major\ndepressive disorder was coined by a\ngroup of senior psychiatrists in the\n1980s who sat around a table to work out\nshould it have five symptoms or six\nsymptoms or four symptoms and they kind\nof there's a great book written about\nthis uh by James Davies uh called\ncracked where he he interviewed a lot of\nthe different um people in that\ncommittee and they say things like this\nwe thought six symptoms was too many\nfour sounded too few so we went for five\nsome were in there one of them said you\ncan't put that symptom as part of the\ndiagnostic criteria I do that uh one of\nthem describes it as a group of friends\ngetting together to choose a restaurant\nto eat at someone suggests Chinese\nsomeone suggests Indian they compromise\non Italian in other words it was people\nsitting around uh whites generally\neducated senior psychiatrists in the\nnortheast of America deciding on these\nthings so Mark let me just uh I kind of\nask a couple things so in the DSM\nthere's something called adjustment\ndisorder with depressed mood\nso my understanding let's just uh I'll\nshare my understanding of that right so\nthat when we sort of diagnose people\nwith depression we'll say like one of\ntwo things either this is a independent\npathological process like an illness and\nthen someone gets diagnosed with\nsomething like major depressive disorder\nyes on the other side there is something\nwhere people experience something that\nlooks very similar to major depressive\ndisorder but there is a clear life\ncircumstance that we can tie to those\nfeelings of despair\nyou know low mood Etc are you basically\nsaying that all of MDD\nis basically a version of adjustment\ndisorder that that's what causes\ndepression the circumstances in our life\nand our inability to cope with them\num\nlook put it this way uh we'll say a\ncouple things here\num\nso there's this I remember getting this\nI'm moving toward this thing in in in in\nin in University there are these people\nout there that have perfect lives and\nthat and they're depressed they have\nuncaused depression now you know I've\nworked for 15 years on and off in\nclinical settings I've never met such a\nperson in my life ever maybe you have\nmaybe I'll psychiatrist I haven't people\nalways have reasons for for things\nhappening\num there was a marketing campaign in\nEngland to sell effectsor and it's sent\naround a pamphlet to GPS and it said you\nshould treat depression even if it's in\nthe context of understandable reasons in\nlife you know they were trying to get\npast this because they surveyed the\npopulation at that time the population\nsaid they asked them what causes\ndepression they said what I'm saying\nthey said when things go wrong in your\nlife\num and they wanted to con they they\nessentially wanted to you know they\nwanted to create a market and they\nwanted to uh make it larger so they\nwanted to include uh all these things as\nan illness because of course you can\ntreat an illness you don't treat normal\nstates of life so I think basically what\nyou're saying you know adjustment\ndisorder sounds very kind of very narrow\nbecause of course there are things that\ncould have happened early on in life\nthat have long-term effects so I'm not\ngoing to say you know for every person\nis depressed look what happened\nyesterday\num but yes in general the data you know\nthe the studies say it's the events in\npeople's lives you know the study I'm\ntalking about is by Kenneth kendler a\nbig researcher in America for the VSU he\nlooks at at people either six months or\na year before I'm sure there is a longer\ntale to things that happen in childhood\nbut yes he shows using I'll put it this\nway in his studies the lines between\nnumber of stresses and risk of\ndepression are like this the most\nincredible straight lines if you look at\nChemicals Between depressed and healthy\nvolunteers it's Flats neuroimaging\nfindings Flats specific genetics Flats\nso compared to that what my grandmother\nwould have said exactly matches the\nscience a huge effect whereas all these\nsupposed abnormalities in the brain uh\nuh you know I don't don't come out\num so I yes I so I think I think a lot\nof major stories about context okay so\nso we're basically saying that\ndepression or you're saying that\ndepression is essentially caused by\ncircumstances in the ability or\ninability to cope\nyeah I mean so you're uh I mean so I'd\nsay there's so a couple things one okay\ncapacity to cope and two is sort of an\nemotional needs section I'd say as well\nI'd say people are happy with their\nemotional needs are met and people are\nmiserable when their emotional needs are\nnot theirs and that sort of that sort of\nflows into I don't know\nthat's there's a yeah there's a slightly\nmore complicated picture but you know\nessentially mood is a kind of a readout\nfor how things are going in life can I\nthink for a second\nso if this is the case\num which I don't disagree with I I\nactually let me just respond to a couple\nthings so you first thing you said is\nthat people with perfect lives can still\nbe depressed and people have used that\nas\nevidence\nthat there is a chemical imbalance of\nthe brain which which I think is very\nconsistent with what I was taught\nwhich is that\nyou know if depression is caused by\ncircumstances then people who have good\ncircumstances should not be depressed\nsince depression is\nsince there are people who have good\ncircumstances who are depressed\nthat therefore I'm just sharing with you\nthe logic I'm not saying I agree with\nyou right so since there are other\npeople who have good Lives who end up\nbeing depressed that suggests to some\npeople that there's some sort of\nindependent pathological process that\ntranscends Beyond circumstance\nso what I would kind of say first of all\nis that I'm with you that there are\npeople with unhappy perfect Lives who\nare unhappy and I I think the flip side\nof it is also that there are people with\nimperfect Lives who are happy both of\nthose things are true\nyes and so I kind of agree with you but\nI I think that the interesting thing is\nthat I think that we sort of correlate I\nthink the correlation with a perfect\nlife or an imperfect life and happiness\nor unhappiness I think is sort of a\ntricky one and if we look at sort of\nlike research on things like mindfulness\nor if we look at you know kind of like\nanecdotal evidence of Eastern like\nmeditative practices and stuff like that\nwe sort of discover that there is a way\nto build resilience\nthere is a way that's I would kind of\ncall it this that's the scientific term\nnot the spiritual term\ncultivating something called Detachment\nor vairagya which is now a big part of\nthings like Acceptance in commitment\ntherapy dialectical behavioral therapy\nwe're seeing some of these Concepts kind\nof bleed in is really what's responsible\nfor being happy or unhappy it doesn't\nactually have much to do with your\ncircumstances or as some some do these\nare circumstances but there are other\nvariables it's not just circumstance\nequals happiness or unhappiness and I\nthink what happened in in our profession\nis that someone was like there's a\nsecond variable in there because this\ndoesn't add up and what they sort of\nthrew in was this is a chemical\nimbalance\nwhereas what I would kind of say is\nthere are other variables as well like\nsome of these spiritual capacities\nemotional quotient\num the capacity to be resilient stuff\nlike that or even things like support\nstructures and so I'm totally with you\nthat I don't think that circumstances\nare sufficient or what we can see as\napparent circumstances in the here and\nnow are sufficient to\nsay that someone should or should not be\ndepressed and there's one study for\nexample that um\nwas looking at\nI think not Suicidal Thoughts but maybe\nsuicide attempts or completed suicides\nin men and sort of found that up to 50\nor 60 percent of them did not have any\nevidence of mental illness\nand so that also kind of brings into\nquestion like and it's and that's\nactually kind of consistent with my\nclinical experience which is that a lot\nof the people that I've worked with who\nare very suicidal I don't think that\nthey're actually like their brain is\nmalfunctioning I think they have a very\nvery genuine and fair assessment that\ntheir life has unsolvable problems and\nthat suicide is an escape from them\nso so can I respond to a few things a\nfew things I thought I agree with you\nthere\num\nI just basically I would say this let's\nsee we could simplify this conversation\nby just taking away this made-up term\nwhich we're using which is major\ndepressive disorder just take away for a\nsecond and see what see what changes I\nwould say I would say so I agree with\nyou I'm not saying it's a completely if\nyou have a terrible life you're going to\nbe depressed if you have a great life no\nI understand there's all sorts of other\nfactors I'm I'm putting together a very\nsimple model in a short conversation\num yes and I and I understand\nmindfulness and the way you respond to\nthings and of course it's how you\ninterpret situations not just situations\nthemselves I agree with that\num I guess the the basic thing is we're\ntalking about people's lives and their\nminds mindfulness is a bit about habits\nof mind I'm talking about contextuals\nthreats and stresses what we're not\ntalking about is chemicals and I would\nsay I think that's a category error so I\nwant to get to that and then I'll\nrespond to a few things you've said so I\nthink if you say depression is caused by\na chemical imbalance I think that\nsentence makes no sense I don't think\nit's I think it's wrong but I also makes\nno sense in the following way so I'll\ngive you a couple I agree by the way\nI'll give you a couple of analogies but\nI want to I want to you know\nso I'll give you a couple of stories you\nknow let's say a friend of yours comes\nup to you and says I'm incredibly\nmiserable I'm totally despairing my\nmother has just died and you say to her\nlook you know I'm a clever guy I'm up on\nthe latest signs I'm not going to talk\nabout your mother get into that stuff\nlet's get into the deep stuff let's get\nyour amygdala MRI let's work out what's\nreally going on you know that's\nridiculous you know that's a that would\nbe a sociopathic response obviously the\nimportant thing is what's happened in\nher life I'm sure there are changes in\nher amygdala I'm sure there are changes\nin her chemistry but that is not the\nright level I wish to think about things\nso I you're you're a computer guy I'll\ngive you that the hackneyed software\nHardware analogy I think it's very\nimportant you know when Microsoft Word\nbreaks you can see how simpler computer\nguy I am you that is happening the\nMicrosoft Word is instantiated in the\ncircuits of your computer you know if\nyou turn if you go to the circuit board\nit doesn't work anymore but if Microsoft\nWord breaks down you don't call up the\ncircuit guy to solder the circuit board\nyou call up the software guy so if\ndepression is about uh not getting your\nemotional needs met your perspective on\nlife uh your uh stress is overwhelming\nyou you call up the guys that deal with\nthose things you're talking about\nmindfulness you're talking about maybe\nyou need a social worker if you call the\nguy that deals with with brain circuits\nI'm sure there might be changes there if\nyou sit in a dark room miserable I'm\nsure it changes the chemistry in your\nbrain I'm sure that's true but it's\nstill not the right area to intervene in\nand I think uh I'm sorry to say that a\nlot of psychology is based on a category\nerror where all of course the mind of\ncourse feelings in the brain of course\nit's either electricity or chemistry I\njust don't think that's the right level\nat which to to intervene my last little\nanalogy is you know when you learn\nJapanese for example a new language of\ncourse you change the chemistry\nelectricity of your brain of course you\ndo but if someone said to you I'm not\ngoing to Japanese classes anymore I'm at\nhome trying to work out how to change\nthe electricity and chemistry of my\nbrain to learn Japanese you'd think they\nwere mad\nand it's because they've made a category\nerror and I think a lot of psychiatrists\nbased on that category era of mistaking\npeople's lives and their mind for the\nbrain although I'm not a dualist of\ncourse the mind is in the brain it's\njust the wrong level at which to\nunderstand things yes and otherwise\neverything you said I I I yeah I I I I\nthink we're speaking the same language\nhere right so I think you pointed out\nthe one big difference the one big flaw\nin the analogy of when I caught when I\nwhen Microsoft Word breaks I don't call\nthe circuit board guy is that in the\nhuman brain Microsoft Word can rewire\nthe circuit right that's exactly what\nyou just said\nis that we we know you know that\nany thoughts that you have can shape the\nthe physiology of your brain the\nelectrical activity of your brain so the\nI think that but but you just cut and I\nthink we kind of know that you can still\nbelieve that even though it can shape\nthe physiology of your brain you're well\nwithin your rights to say I don't think\nthat's where the real therapeutic value\nis\nso even if if Microsoft Word can change\nour circuit board\nthe problem is still fixing Microsoft\nWord\nso that the circuit board reshapes in\nthe right way we still want to intervene\nup here and I think we're on the same\npage there is that fair exactly I agree\nwith you I'm sure that losing a loved\none you know the despair you know can\ncan change the chemistry of your brain\nI'm sure that's true I still think that\nthe you know the issue is getting to the\ngrieving process you know Finding other\nsources of intimacy it's still up here\nat the Microsoft Word level even if\nthere are you know Downstream effects at\nthe\num at the brain level and I think you\nknow when people when I have this\nconversation with people I think what\ngets some people is they say no it feels\ndifferent it becomes something different\nI know what sadness is I know what\nfeeling hopeless is yes that's all\nMicrosoft Word Life but when I've been\nreally depressed you know it feels\nphysical I can't move and I felt that\nyou know I want to say I've had\npsychomotor retardation you know in\ndepression uh so I I've been up that end\nhow do you understand that experience\nfor people\nwhen they say this feels different I've\nbeen sad I've been hopeless because I've\ncertainly had that experience with\npatience as well yeah I mean look it's\nit's a bit harder you know I don't want\nto be saying to somebody you know you're\nwrong you're interpreters wrong Minds\nright you know I don't want to you know\nthat's a bit of a very conflictual take\nI can only say I have been in that state\nand it was for Clear life reasons you\nknow yes I you know I think you can get\ninto a bit of a vicious cycle you know\nsomething's gone wrong in your life you\nlose confidence you can't do anything to\nchange it you become hopeless I think\nthat can become a self-perpetuating\ncycle and it can feel like you can't\nescape from it and I guess you know it\ndoes have biological effects potentially\nthat put you in a state that's a bit\nlike hibernation you know that's look\nthat's what what depression looks like\nto me and yes you know even though I'm\nsure there are biological changes I\nstill think the solution you know as it\nwas for me and it was I think for other\npeople is dealing with the life things\nyou know if you have some of those\nthings met in your life that you can get\nout of such states can we talk about\nthat for a second so so what you you\nsaid you were diagnosed with treatment\nresistant depression and and you know it\nsounds like you're a\ntried all kinds of stuff are you do you\nfeel depressed nowadays if you feel\ncomfortable answering this I'm okay I'm\nvery happy to talk about this\num\nit's a bit complicated because there's\nthere's medications involved and\nwithdrawal effects but the answer is\nI've got to say I have\num so at the moment you know I I have\nI'm going through withdrawal from the\nantidepressants that I'm on and so I do\nhave some withdrawal effects that do\noccasionally put me in a dysphoric mood\nI've got to say I've had a very big\nchange in me and that's the way that I\nthink about myself\nwhich was all the things I've talked\nabout I used to think I had a thing\ncalled depression uh and now I don't\nthink that's true anymore I I think I've\nbeen through you know I went through uh\nthings growing up that were very\ndistressing to me I think that had a big\neffect on me but I don't think that I'm\ninherently a depressed person or have a\nthing called depression I think I've\nI've experienced traumatic periods that\naffected me\nI'm a you know I'm a slightly more more\nmature uh person these days so I no\nlonger think of myself as someone that\nhas depression uh I've had bad periods\nI'm sure I'll have bad periods again\nliking what it is I'm probably a\npessimistic you know slightly neurotic\nperson uh that's my Jewish Heritage\num but but I I don't you know so now you\nknow what my mood's okay and and no I\ndon't think I've got a lifelong illness\nI'm curious when you reconceptualized\nyourself that way\nhow did that affect your depression\nright so it's all it's all mixed up\nmedication\nbiology depression is all mixed up so\nyou know part of me walking around\ntaking medication every day for 15 years\nyou know was I'm basically I'm I mean I\nhad complicated ideas I'm not going to\nsay I thought of the chemical imbalance\nif you have drugs I'm I thought I was a\nsophisticated academic in this area but\nI thought there was basically something\nwrong with me uh the medication helped\nto either dull or fix uh and you know I\nI had certain limitations in my life\nthat other Bill didn't have because I\nwas prone this way when I started coming\noff the antidepressants I had this\nterrible period of time coming coming\noff them initially I had to go back on\nthem because it was such an unpleasant\nwithdrawal period I come off I came off\nthe mic because you feel broken huh to\nbe able to have to go back onto an\nantidepressant well that was it's funny\nit's it broke the spell it's really\nfunny I had the opposite effect when I\nhad withdrawal symptoms from\nantidepressants it broke the spill of\nwhat I thought was in my hand I thought\nI had this benign you know Curative\nsubstance when coming off it led me to\nalmost kill myself I I developed panic\nattacks for some of my life I couldn't\nsleep I felt really suicidal for a\nsustained period of time because life\nwas so hard I I it it broke the spell I\nthought this drug is not what I was\ntaught it was this ruggers calls me\nincredible trouble coming off and that\nthat did that started to break the\nskills when I went back on Earth I knew\nI was going back on it not because I had\ndepression and knit of the drug I was\ngoing back on it because I was dependent\non an antidepressant and it was too\nunpleasant to come off it and I had to\nfind a different way so when I went back\non it I already had different ideas\nI I I I was I was frightened by the\nprocess of coming off and I waited\nanother couple of years I then started\ncoming off much more slowly in the way\nthat I've sort of indicated over months\nnow years in this very slow way a little\nbit at a time\nin doing that it made me think you know\nuh I I re I re-examined uh studies that\nshowed that these drugs prevent relapse\nbecause you might be aware that the\nreason why these drugs are recommended\nfor long-term treatment in the American\nguidelines and are elsewhere is because\nof studies that show that if you stop\nthem people get worse and in these\nstudies the only persons have stopped\nover a few days often abruptly and they\nmeasure\nmood and and sleep they don't they never\nmeasure withdrawal symptoms and so I\nstarted to think hold on these studies\nare showing that people get withdrawal\nsymptoms from coming off antidepressants\nnot necessarily that they stop\num\nit's scary right because like I see what\nyou're kind of saying is that so if you\ngo off the SSRI\nand you start feeling suicidal\nit's a very easy logical step to say the\nSSRI is\nand if we restart it the suicidality\ngoes away therefore it's working but if\nyou reconceptualize it as a withdrawal\nproblem that the suicidality is being\ninduced\nby the withdrawal of the SSRI\nthen it changes the picture\nit changes everything it changes every\nit changes every guideline for every\ndrug and Psychiatry so let me ask you\nthis what about the case of I'm suicidal\nI start an SSRI and the suicidality goes\naway is that placebo\nthat's a different can I can I finish\nthis just one thing about the prevention\nthing\num it's hard to keep up with you it's\nfun but it's a panting\num\nexactly what you just said about if you\nstop it you get worse people think it\nmust be the drugs preventing it you\ncould do the same thing with cigarettes\nyou could say if you people who stop\ncigarettes become anxious and irritable\ntherefore people must need cigarettes to\nprevent anxiety irritability that's\nthat's absurd but I think that's a lot\nwhat's going on with antidepressant\nstudies because they are stopped\nabruptly you know that's crazy by\nanyone's standards right that's why I\nasked the question about so let's but\nthe person who starts smoking cigarettes\ndoesn't is not already angry and\nirritable and going through withdrawal\nright so there's something that causes\nthe suicidality before we start\nantidepressant medication so so let's so\nlet's Okay and then we we have you know\nsome evidence in my clinical experience\nis that\npatients fall into three categories this\nis clinical okay so I've seen the\nstudies that show that I've seen studies\nshowing the efficacy of ssris I've seen\nstudies showing that the majority of the\neffect of ssris are\num primarily Placebo or\nnon-pharmacologic in nature so I'm I'm\nactually like kind of okay with both of\nthose so I'm just sharing clinical\nexperience because what I think we're\ntalking about is like there are people\nwho actually have this problem right\nokay and there are hopefully going to be\nmental health professionals including\nprescribers who will one day watch this\ntalk so my clinical experience is that\nthere are three camps of people\nfor a third of people ssris do\nabsolutely nothing\nfor a third of people this is my\nclinical experience okay for a third of\npeople ssris may help may not help if\nthey do help the effect seems to be\nsmall and we're probably like kind of in\nthat Placebo range where I don't feel\nlike there's a good clinical need to\nkeep them on it\nif they feel more secure like kind of\npsychodynamically and this is like the\npsychodynamics of psychopharmacology\nlike I think there's something there\nand I would say that for a third of my\npatients that people really do get\nbetter and even in that third of\npatients I think there's about half of\nthose will try to taper people off and\nwe'll sort of talk about the risks and\nstuff I've seen some of these studies of\nyou know I'm cautious about like you\nkind of said some of these basic\nprinciples of the human brain which is\nthat anything that we add in pill form\nthat has a constant effect on your body\nwill develop some kind of physiologic\nadaptation whether it's alcohol and\nupregulating or liver enzymes or\nbenzodiazepines and the Gaba receptor\ncaffeine anything that we add except for\nthings like what and even things like\nwater I mean you can look at people who\nare dehydrated or drink too much and\nyou'll see changes in their kidneys\nright\nso you'll see all kinds of adaptations\nso what do you think is going on for the\npeople who say hey I know what sadness\nis I know what how hopelessness is I've\ntaken this antidepressant and it's\nreally changed this thing for me okay so\nso take a step back and say something\nphilosophical have you so there's a\nconcept so what does get better mean\nwith these drugs so there's there's\nProfessor Moncrief he's a professional\npsychiatry in England and she has uh his\nway of looking at drugs so there's one\none way of looking at what does get\nbetter mean is through is through what\nshe calls the disease-centered model\nyou've got it you've got a condition\ndepression you give a drug it fixes it\nan example might be you've got an\ninfection you give an antibiotic the\nantibiotic kills the infection the cough\nand the cold goes away you've got better\nor insulin for diabetes is a common\nanalogy you've got diabetes you don't\nhave enough insulin you give insulin it\nfixes the diabetes and people uh suggest\npeople people have argued mostly drug\ncompanies but now lots of people have\naccepted us that antidepressants are\nsomehow fixing the issue in depression\nand that's why people get better okay\nthat's one that's one interpretation\nanother interpretation she calls the\ndrug centered model and that is\npsychiatric drugs like recreational\ndrugs have psychoactive effects they\nchange the way we think and we feel and\nan example would be if you drink alcohol\nand you have social anxiety disorder you\nfeel less anxious you feel you feel more\nuh disinhibited you feel more relaxed\nyou can talk in social situations and\npeople would say on alcohol such things\nI disorder I feel better\nand what what you've done is you've\nadded a drug that suppresses their\nunderlying anxiety you wouldn't say\nyou've fixed the underlying cause in\nsocial anxiety nor would you say social\nanxiety is caused by an alcohol\ndeficiency\nuh and so get better they're still\nsaying they feel better but you've got a\ndifferent interpretation and so let's\njust for the audience jump in for a\nsecond and remember that the actual FDA\napproved treatments that we have for\nsocial anxiety include basically alcohol\nand pill form right so that analogy is\nreally good because\nbenzodiazepines is a class of\nmedications work\nvery similarly to alcohol absolutely\nabsolutely so I think it's a fantastic\nanalogy and let's let's let's let's just\nfollow that analogy for a second and\nthen we'll come back to Randy prisons so\nlet's talk about alcohol in social\nanxiety so of course we've all we've all\ndrunk alcohol for social anxiety I'm\nsure everyone in the audience has\num we know a few things about alcohol we\nknow in the long term the effect wears\noff that's because of Tolerance and\ndependence we know there's withdrawal\naffection stopping it we know it's toxic\nto the brain and the liver and several\norgans of the body we know that\nrecreational drugs that make you feel\nbetter are generally bad for you and we\nall know that we choose to drink alcohol\nsome of us because it's more fun than\nthe dangers that it causes us\num you might start to think well drugs\nthat actually might have similar uh\neffects in the long term let's come back\nto antidepressants so how do\nantidepressants work uh there's there's\nthere's basically let's let's go\nstraight for it if you ask people\nuh who are on antidepressants\n50 to 70 of different studies say they\nfeel emotionally numbs what does that\nmean they're positive and their negative\nemotions are restricted what was the 10\nis now a three uh\nuh that correlates with genital numbing\npeople that have emotional numbing often\nalso have genital numbing sexual side\neffects in fact I'm writing a textbook\non how to safely stop these drugs and in\nit I talk about how to crush up tablets\nif you crush up most antidepressants and\nswish it around your mouth with water\nyour mouth will become numb in other\nwords there is an anesthetic property\nthat affects emotions physical tissue\nincluding your mouth but especially your\ngenitals now if you were suicidal or\npanicked or anxious and you're given an\nantidepressant that has a mild numbing\neffects then you might feel a lot better\nand you might say gee doc I feel a lot\nbetter I'm not taking that away from\nanybody\num that might be very useful might save\nsomeone's life uh but when you think\nabout get better\ngetting better in the short term may not\nmean getting better in the long term\nbecause we know alcohol wears off\nalcohol causes problems we know that\nantidepressants like ssris have a very\nsimilar mode of action to MDMA or\necstasy they both affect the serotonin\ntransporter in fact the snris affect\nboth the serotonin and adrenaline\nTransporters as MDMA does\num so you could start to think you're\ntaking a drug that causes numbing in the\nshort term one that might have\nconsequences in the long term it might\ncause uh changes in quality of life a\nlack of access to positive emotions\naffecting intimacy\num so what happens in the short term why\nnot play out in the long term the drugs\nmight wear off because of tolerance as\nyou've said to any drug because of\nphysiological adaptation and it may have\nconsequences for Sleep concentration\nmemory weight which antipersants do in\nthe long term so I'm not arguing with\nyou do some people feel better I'm just\nlike what is what causes that and then\nI'll argue with that a little bit as\nwell\num so so one and that's why getting back\nto you talking about epigenetic changes\nand things\nso there is that explanation for what\nwhat antidepressants do it's in it's in\nstudy after study done by Drug Company\ngroups and independent groups uh numbing\nis is uh is is caused in fact they did a\nstudy recently in healthy volunteers\nbecause there's this debate is this\nemotional blunting caused by depression\nor antidepressants they gave three weeks\nof Lexapro to healthy volunteers and\nthey demonstrated emotional numbing so\nit's very clear it's because of the\ndrugs it may be also because of\ndepression but it's very clear there's a\nbig effect from the drugs uh I think you\nknow that's the most obvious explanation\nof how antidepressants work that was\ndefinitely my experience now that I'm\ncoming off it it's become much more\nclear\nso all of these biological explanations\nis trying to get you to think in a\ndisease-centered way when you talk about\nfix the serotonin epigenetics\ninflammation yeah convince you that\nthese being in a come kind of deep\nbiological yeah yeah so I I'm with you\nthere so let me just let me ask you this\nso from a clinical perspective right so\nyou're saying that okay so the\ntherapeutic value of antidepressants is\nthat they numb things so let's assume\nthat that's the case for a moment\ndo you think there's therapeutic value\nof numbing things\nuh if there was no other consequences I\nthink probably yes but there is so this\nis what I'd say antidepressants do this\nis how I give informed consensual\npatient this drug has this drug is\nminimally effective in in randomized\ncontrolled trials it's it's two points\nbetter than than Placebo\num it may work it probably works by\nnumbing we don't know there's all sorts\nof other theories I'll talk about them a\nlittle bit more but we know that most\nthe majority of people on these drugs\nwill report numbing uh so he'll report\nthat as being helpful there are also\nside effects it causes weight gain\nnausea sexuals half of people will get\nsexual side effects half of you will\nhave emotional blunting which will be a\nproblem for some people in the long term\nit causes disrupted sleep it causes\nimpact concentration impaired memory the\nlonger you stay on at the height will be\nto come off some people find it so hard\nto come up with these medications they\nhave to stay on the medications some\npeople are debilitated by the withdrawal\nsymptoms that they have we have now\ndiscovered that the sexual side effects\nfrom these drugs persist after stopping\nin some people we don't know who it may\nlast for months or years it may even be\npermanence\nthere are in in the in England there are\n19 treatments that are equally effective\nand cost-effective antidepressants\nthat's the national guidelines they\ninclude mindfulness exercise\nvarious forms of interpersonal and\nprivate therapy individual therapy the\nnumber one most cost effective treatment\nthis was a nine year analysis by the\ngovernment Department uh that looks\nafter these looks after guidelines was\nproblem solving therapy for severe\ndepression\nwas the most cost effective effective\ntreatment so that's what I say to people\nthese are the Alternatives these are the\nside effects these are the benefits this\nis how it might work I think number one\nI think the mechanism of action is very\nimportant because if you're told you've\ngot a chemical jump in with a question\nso when you offer this kind of informed\nconsent\nyeah how do people usually elect to take\nan anti-depressant\ngenerally they don't generally they\ndon't and if they did elect to take an\nantidepressant what impact do you think\nyour informed consent would have on\ntheir therapeutic response I think\nthermic response I'm not sure but but\nthe main so let's say let's say we agree\nand maybe we do a bit that they caught\nthat they act by numbing\nuh I think then it's important to use it\nshort term so for example let's say it's\nsomething like giving alcohol that\nwasn't the question I asked I asked what\nimpact do you think your informed\nconsent would have on the person's\nresponse to the medication\nuh well uh you you've mentioned the\npsychodynamics or psychopharmacology I\nguess when you when someone says this\ndrug is is a whiz-bang super fantastic\nit'll solve things in your life that\ntends to enhance the effect so I guess\nwhat I'm doing is not doing that so I'm\nprobably not enhancing the placebo\neffect in any way uh yeah if I heard\nthat I would think that we're inducing a\nnocebo effect\nwell I'm telling on them telling them\nI'm telling them facts I'm telling them\nI I will I will pull out for example I\nthink the the patient information\nleaflet inside the drugs which I think\nmost doctors say don't look at that\nwritten by the lawyers don't worry about\nit I say look at that it's written by\nthe lawyers you know that's important I\nwouldn't put it in if it wasn't if it\nwasn't real and I'd take people through\nthat\num so I'm I'm telling them what what\nfacts there are I'm giving them the data\num I so I think they're the real\npaternalism into telling people this\ndrug is great and will help you I think\nthat that is no longer I don't think\nthat's an ethical position to take if\nthe drug if that doesn't match the the\ndrugs that is a very old-fashioned idea\ndoctor knows best this drug is going to\nbe good for you so I'm going to\nencourage you to take it I feel that in\nmy training we were we were we were\ninduced educated to convince people to\ntake the drugs which meant we\nunderplayed harms and we exaggerated\nbenefits and I don't think that's I\ndon't think that's ethical practice I'm\nwith you but where's I mean I I think it\nstill sounds paternalistic right it's\njust doctor still knows best it's just\ndoctor is telling you that this is going\nto hurt you\nthe doctor is telling you that this is\ngoing to hurt you and it won't work\nwell I'm telling them the facts I mean I\nI'm not I'm not it's not my opinion that\nthe drug is going to cause you know 50\nof people that have sexual side effects\nthat's what the studies show that's\nthat's I think that informed consent you\nknow the modern doctor-based\nrelationship means you tell them the\nfacts and they make the decision yeah so\nI I think that that's I use\nantidepressants I think in a very\nsimilar way so usually when I think\nabout antidepressants I'm kind of with\nyou that there's a ton of other stuff\nand what I tell people is\nI don't think that antidepressants cure\ndepression so as long as you're on the\nantidepressant it may have a fact may\nnot have an effect as I mentioned I'm\nwell aware that a large part of that\neffect is Placebo\num what I usually find with people is\nthat I tell them look if you really want\nto get a handle on your depression you\nprobably need to make you have to invest\na lot of time and energy to try to fix\nyour life so this includes everything\nfrom meditating to doing things like\nPsychotherapy processing trauma so for\nexample like chronic depression in my\nexperience of treatment resistant\ndepression is that it's not even\ndepression it's actually trauma\nmasquerading as\ndepression so there's a lot of\ncorrelations and I think this was even\nin some of the papers I think that maybe\neven you wrote\num which you're not the only one but you\nknow the impact of adverse childhood\nexperiences on later depression\nand so usually what kind of where I kind\nof come down is that look if you've got\ntime so I think if you really want to\nget a handle on this problem and this is\nthere's a selection bias here too\nbecause these are the people that come\nto me\nif you really want to get a handle on\nthis problem I don't think the SSRI is\ngoing to fix it what an SSRI will do I\ndon't use the word num but I think the\nSSRI is for people who don't have the\nbandwidth to get a handle on the problem\nand then you will see a mitigation\nhopefully of the things that keep you\nfrom engaging with your problems so\nthere are cases where once again I'm\ntalking about my clinical experience\nwhere people will say like okay I can't\nget out of bed in the morning\nif we start an SSRI they do feel some\namount of numbing of negative feelings\ncompletely agree with that\ncharacterization and that numbing of\nnegative feelings allows them to engage\nin the parts of their life that really\nlead to real healing and and this is\nwhere in my clinical experience like I'm\nnot saying this is right this is just\nI'm sharing what I do and and you know I\ngo through pretty rigorous informed\nconsent process\num but what my experience has been is\nthat even when I start people on an SSRI\nmy goal is to use that Runway right so\nwe can kind of think about it I'll I'll\neven assume for a moment that all it\ndoes is numb things and then use that\nRunway to start building healthier\nthings into your life and then actually\ntake people off of the medication so in\nmy preference as a clinician and You\nKnow It ultimately depends on providing\nthe patient with informed consent and\nthey can end up doing what they want to\nwith their life\nbut if people are looking for straight\npsycho Farm I just don't see like\nstraight psychoform patients I don't\nit's you know I think that like\npsychofarm is a tool even things like\nbenzodiazepines which we know can cause\nlife-threatening and fatal withdrawal\nand cause dependency and can cause you\nknow impacts on even things like\ndementia and stuff like that so all of\nthese medications I think just like\ncholesterol medication or anything else\nhas a risk and a benefit and the real\nplace that I've seen ssris have and this\nis someone who prescribes them rarely\nis that it provides people a Runway to\nreally build up the rest of the things\nso that we can take them off I'm curious\nwhat you think about that like so look\nyou know what you're outlining you know\nto me is you know close to Ideal\npractice you're doing it you're doing it\nuh you know reluctantly for a small\namount of cases you're using it uh\nyou're focusing on other things you're\ndoing it short term I would just add a\ncouple of things that I'm not you know\nso I don't make this I'm not criticizing\nyour personal practice of course you can\nby the way no I'm not I'm not I'm not\njust you sound like a very thoughtful\nvery sensible person\num uh I'd say a couple of things one you\ntalk about psychodynamics you're when\nyou give a medication to somebody you're\ntelling them you do not have the\nsolution inside you need a medication\nand you're ill because doctors give\nmedication to ill people there are good\nstudies on this that say when people\naccept a medication they accept a\nbiological explanation for their their\nillness in the short term the effect is\nvery leaving they think it's not my\nfault it's it's an illness the doctor\nrecognizes he does this all the time in\nthe long term it's disempowering because\nI think I've got a broken brain I've got\nan illness I've got you know I went\nthrough that process itself so it is not\na neutral or or a definitely positive\nthing to give a medication there are all\nsorts of other messages that come along\nwith this uh so it can be very\ndisempowering\num that's one two\num uh there's this idea that that\ntogether therapy and medication work\nbetter and that medication is a bridge\nto therapy medication get you activated\num we've just done a big analysis that\nshows that people on medication have a\nworse response to therapy and the\ndifference between our study and other\nstudies were the other studies are all\nshort term again the six to twelve weeks\nstart an antidepressant get a bit of a\nnumbing or a high and the therapy we're\nlooking people who are long-term\nantidepressants so it may not be\nrelating to your practice but we see a\ndefinite reduction in efficacy of\ntherapy and we think the reason is\ntherapy is about can I give that a shot\nyeah have a guess so I think I think the\nreal therapeutic action in therapy is\nactually being able to access and\nprocess our emotions exactly and that if\nwe have a numbing agent then our ability\nto get into the really hurtful stuff and\nactually fix it becomes hampered so it\nkeeps it at Bay it walls it off but once\nyou wall something off off whether it's\nan abscess or a psychological hurt you\ncan't drain it you can't fix it you have\nto Break Down The Walls to actually get\nin there and fix the problem that would\nbe my guess yep got it in one exactly\nyou know or it could be the cognitive\nimpairment so you can't think through\nthings but I think that's it it's a lack\nof uh access to emotions and also to\nclear thinking and exactly I think\ntherapy is a lot about in a safe space\naccessing very painful memories trauma\nde traumatizing them you know working\nthrough it in some way and that releases\npeople from emotions you can see then in\ngiving medication it's not a completely\nneutral act and you also said people who\ndon't have the capacity of the bandwidth\nI mean I would say depression is a\nsignal going off in people's lives\nsomething is wrong you know and that\nsignal can lead to big changes I mean if\nyou've got to break up with your partner\nyou've got to change your job it's a\nvery you know it can ruin your life you\nknow it can cause huge disruption but\nthen you know is it really the right\nthing to do to put something over that\nlight and cover up so I would say just\njust to go to a personal note when I\nwalked into the doctor's office when I\nwas 21 I wasn't sure that I wanted to do\nthe course that I was doing I wasn't\nsure I wanted to have the same friends\nthat I had I wasn't sure I want to be\nthe same person that I was and I\nremember thinking you know I was I read\na lot of therapy I read Nietzsche I read\nall these things I thought there's two\npossibilities here either I have to\nchange every aspect of my life or I've\ngot an illness and I in the end knocked\non the door and they said yes it's an\nillness and I felt great relief I would\ngive anything for that doctor to have\nsaid look Mark you're a troubled young\nman and there is no way out of this\ninstead of you know unless you know\nwithout working through difficult issues\nof who you are and what your place is in\nthe world I don't have any pills that\nwe'll deal with that in my in my desk I\nwould have been really pissed off at her\nif she said that I would have been you\nknow what are you talking about I've\nread about these things but I would have\nbeen very grateful to her later on yeah\nit's interesting so you know I I\nsometimes people will ask we'll do stuff\non depression right so this is an\nexample\nand over time though like I get the same\nset of questions and and so I made this\nthing called a guide to depression and\nit sort of mirrors my clinical practice\nand only 20 of it is clinical\neighty percent of it so a big part of\nthe guide to depression is like finding\npurpose\nand and what are like if we look back in\nin these ancient days and we had people\nand I think there are people who are\nperfectly happy like what does a good\nexample of someone who I think really\nhad a level of Tranquility that was so\nprofound that a religion cropped up\naround him\nand and their actual spiritual\ntechniques and you mentioned that you\nknow mindfulness is one of the 19 things\nthat we know has sort of positive\nhealing powers for something like\ndepression and in my experience you know\nespecially when I work with like men\nthat a lot of the depression is not I\nmean you can take a pill and and I I\nkind of view it almost the same way that\nI view cholesterol medication\nwhich is that you can take cholesterol\nmedication will artificially lower your\ncholesterol and there's all kind by the\nway there's the same problems with\ncholesterol medication that we have with\nssris which is that this idea that\ncholesterol induces all these heart\nattacks and stuff there are a lot of\nmethodology methodological flaws with\ncholesterol as well I don't know how\nfamiliar you are with that stuff but\nit's very similar maybe not quite as bad\nas depression I think there's more of a\nclear biological effect we'll know a\nlittle bit of this is the fat stuff and\nthe the absolute keys but but yeah but\nat least there's actual chemical changes\nthat they found in cholesterol I mean\nright right so there's more biology to\ncholesterol worse in depression but if\nwe if we really look at you know and and\nI'll you know I've had friends and\nfamily members and patients who will go\nto a Cardiologist who's like hyper\naggressive with like lowering their\ncholesterol and and like you know your\ncholesterol needs to be like way below\neven what the drug companies recommend\nbecause lower cholesterol means longer\nlife\nand that's the kind of thing where you\nknow I think that if you really want to\nfix your cholesterol it's all Lifestyle\nChanges basically and there may be some\ngenetic component to having high\ncholesterol even if you do all the right\nthings\num but but I think it's kind of the same\nthing it's like you can actually fix\nyour problems or you can take a pill\nthat will mitigate the damage of the\nlife that you live\nand I think the really tricky thing for\nme as a physician ethically is that\nthere are some people who are never\ngoing to work out there are some people\nand even I I have a criticism with that\nas well because I think it's our duty as\nPhysicians and one of the things that\nreally bothers me about Physicians is\nthat even in medical training you're a\nmedical doctor right if I yeah PhD and\nmbbs right so one of the things that\nreally bothers me and I'm going to get\non my soapbox if you don't mind moving\naside for a moment\num is that we don't think about\nphysical illnesses as motivational\nproblems\nso when we have a patient who's got a\ncholesterol issue the GP is going to say\ntake this medication we're not actually\ntrained in like motivational\ninterviewing\nand to help people like okay like how\nlike because we can we can tell them hey\nlike you need to eat more fiber and eat\nless processed foods and we provide them\nwith information but information doesn't\ncreate behavioral change\nI want to say that 50 and I'm being\nconservative there on my heart of hearts\nit's like 80 of the physical problems\nthat we deal with are exactly what\nyou're talking about\nthat that these problems like you can\ntake cholesterol medication every single\nday and it'll artificially lower your\ncholesterol there will be\npopulation-based studies that show that\nyou are less likely to die of a heart\nattack but these are populations studies\nthat the reason that cholesterol\nmedication is so good is because you\nhave a population of people who are not\nbeing taught how to live healthy lives\nand I think we're seeing the same thing\nwith psychopharmacology and Psychiatry\nwhich is that someone once told me that\nyou know you should you should do a\npsychopharm clinic because it's\noperating at the top of your license\nthat you as a medical doctor there are\nsocial workers psychologists phds that\ncan all do psychotherapy but you as a\ndoctor are the only one that can\nprescribe therefore if you want to do\ngood in the world you should prescribe\nthe most medication possible and I\nthought that was ridiculous I said I\ndon't think that's the top of my license\nat all in fact I think it's operating at\nthe bottom of my license my personal\ntake is that operating the top of a\nlicense as a psychiatrist is you're the\none person that can combine the both\nyou're the one person that can actually\nrecognize what the strengths and\nweaknesses of a medication is and to be\nable to integrate it into a long-term\nplan using things like Psychotherapy or\ngut microbiome or like all kinds of\nother stuff that I think has awesome\ntherapeutic value\nand so like I I'm with you you know I\nshall relieve my soapbox and give you a\nchance\nexcellent performance I want to pick out\none thing from there before I forget it\nand then think back to some of the other\npoints you made you basically said look\nsome people will never go to the gym you\nknow people are not going to fix their\nlives they're not going to face all\nthese big issues so we may as well do\nwhat we can for them like give them a\nStatin or give them an antidepressant\nI'll stick away from Center for a second\nthe only thing with the only problem\nwith that is is if you're doing them\nmore harm than good so I'm not arguing\nif something if this drug was a bit\nhelpful it wasn't any side effects I\nwould agree with everything you've just\nsaid I would just nod along but but\nthere's a few things I'd add in there\nnumber one there's something called a\ntar dive dysphoria with antidepressants\nthis idea that long-term use of\nantibisance can make depression worse\nnow I think so I'll put my cups level I\nthink I absolutely had that you know I\nam I am the major difference between me\nnow and me five years ago is I'm on less\nmedication I'm in a lot better mood than\nI was on medication I think there's a\nfew ways it could work one ssris disrupt\nsleep architecture in every study your\nnormalcy bucket stage one two three four\nREM is disrupted that's why people often\ndon't dream when they're on antibiscus\nbecause REM is is inhibited it also\naffects slow wave sleep in some studies\nthey say this must be the mechanism of\naction but if you look at it it's\nshowing disruptive sleep people have\nimpaired concentration and memory as I\nhad very badly on these drugs and that\nmay I mean professionally not very good\nsocially uh self-conscious the fact that\nI've got my memory and concentration\nback has made me a lot more confident as\na human being and people would also some\npeople suggest there's a directly Toxic\neffect and if you think about these\ndrugs being a bit like MDMA not as\nstrong much a smaller dose but someone\ntaking a small dose of a recreational\ndrug every day what do you think about\nthem over years they're not happy you\nknow go lucky people they're people that\nhave there's some sort of impairment I\nthink about the alcohol well there are\nsome recent studies I know that micro\ndosing uh psychedelics has been very\npopular among some people but there are\nsome studies I think recently that came\nout that show that it basically is\nharmful so\nright I mean look I guess my step back\nis you know these are chemicals they're\nthey're exogenous to the to the body\nthey're going to have abnormal effects\non the brain you know they're not that's\nwhy that's why the story about low\nserotonin and these drugs fixing it is\nvery seductive because it makes them\nsound natural you know replacing insulin\nwith insulin sounds to me very sensible\nlow sometimes it's very simple but if\nyou step away from that and there is no\nlow serotonin then these drugs are\nchanging the the chemistry of the brain\nand we know from recreational drugs\nwhich I think we're a lot more honest\nabout we know that that's likely to have\nnegative effects in the long term\nbecause we're fiddling with a system\nthat was evolved over Millennia so\nthat's where I would problematize this\nidea well if you can't do anything for\nthem you might as well do this I would\nsay and this is really hard for doctors\nif you can't do anything useful for them\nat least don't know them any harm so I\nthink a very sensible response is I\ncan't do anything for you there are no\ndrugs they're going to fix this you know\nwait and see sounds like all the things\nthat you're talking about are these 19\nother treatments and other things that\nsounds all very useful but just to do\nsomething and if you ask doctors you\nknow why do you prescribe a lot of them\nsay that I want to do something you know\ndoctors want to help it also can do guys\nyou know in the emergency department if\nsomeone's having a heart attack you want\nyou want a guy that's going to jump on\nyou and shock you you don't want a guy\nwho's going to say oh let's wait and see\nbut I think in this there's a great book\nwritten by Harvard psychiatrist much\nolder than you called House of gods\nthat's that's these earlier books the\nother book is Mount Misery and he says\nhis line is don't just do something\nstand there it's a great line and I\nthink it's really important in\nPsychiatry that completely agree House\nof God is fantastic by the way I should\ndefinitely check it out it's where\nscrubs came from but Mount Misery is the\nsequel maybe even better deeper about\nhis time in training in McLean Hospital\nin uh in in Harvard uh and I think you\nknow we we want to be able to fix\neverything we want to think that we're\nbrilliant neurosized we can fiddle with\nthings I think we have to accept life is\nvery hard doctors are not the\nall-powerful people they like to think\nof themselves as and we have to accept\nour limitation rather than we can fix\nthings I think that's a very potentially\ndangerous idea to have in our heads yeah\nabsolutely so a couple other questions\nmark um and I think we're going to wrap\nup in a few minutes so one thing that\nI'm just kind of noticing and I hope\nthis is okay is that so so you're\nsomeone who is diagnosed with treatment\nresistant depression and when I talk to\nyou I get the sense that you're on a\ncrusade is that fair\nlook I think uh look I feel that I have\nsuffered a lot I haven't gone into it I\nhad a lot of illness I had a lot of\nhealth problems on these drugs for many\nyears\nmainly tiredness uh memory problems and\nuh concentration issues which caused me\nhuge amounts of trouble I worked\npart-time it cost me relationships it\nwas a big thing since I've come off the\ndrugs I've realized that a lot of those\nproblems were due to the drugs\nand so you know I I guess I've had I\nfeel like the lens has been removed from\nmy eyes and I can see a lot of issues\nthat people have are because of their\ndrugs adverse effects that are not well\nrecognized that I withdrawal effects\nfrom their drugs that are not well\nrecognized so if I had had trouble\ncoming off this drug and that was it I\nwould have gone away and kept kept going\nit was seeing that there was endless\npeople around me with similar problems\nthat made me think this wasn't just bad\nluck for me an idiosyncratic reaction\nfor me this is a systemic problem and I\nthink that's what got me a bit activated\nthat wasn't just me because I I sort of\nsay I've had reactions to antibiotics\nbefore I'm not talking about antibiotics\nare terrible because I don't think that\nI've just you know I've just re-examined\nuh you know antidepressants it made me\nyou know I it's a sort of a lucky thing\nI happen to have a PhD in the area I'm a\ntraining psychiatrist I had the\nexpertise to look at it I do think it's\na human rights issue I you're right I I\nam you know there's an activist uh\ncorner to my work because I think that\nbecause doctors in the public don't\nunderstand the risks of these drugs you\nknow and minimal benefits that a lot of\nharm is being done to people with\nlong-term treatments children in in\nwomen uh of childbearing age that are\nnot being looked at clearly because of a\nkind of a paradigm that science and\nthese drugs will fix things and it\ncauses people not to look at these\nissues in great depth so yes I\ndefinitely think there's a human rights\nissue here no I am I am a campaigner as\nwell as a researcher and that's because\nI think there's uh there are things that\ncan be improved in our health system and\nI you know I happen to have insight into\nit through my own experience and my and\nmy research so so one thing that I'm\nkind of curious about and hope let me\nknow if I overstep here is that I'm kind\nof noticing that as you've discovered\nthat so you had this idea that okay\nthere's something broken in me and then\nsomeone is like here's a pill Mark take\nit and your problems will be solved\nand then you trusted that doctor in that\nmoment\nand that caused you a ton of\nhurt right it stalled your progress in a\nlot of ways it sounds like you've been\nstruggling with this for a long time it\nsounds like you're still dealing with\nthe problems of tapering off of ssris\nand and so it's kind of interesting\nright because the now you've sort of\ndiscovered that okay I've never been\nbroken I've never been broken\nand that thought in and of itself kind\nof pulls you out of the depression some\nthat there's not something fundamentally\nwrong with me\nthe the demon here is the medication and\nI have to fix my own problems so one of\nthe things that I'm kind of curious\nabout is like\nso when I'm listening to this there are\ntwo kind of concerns that have these are\na little bit more personal in nature let\nme know if this is kind of out of uh uh\nout of bounds of what's appropriate\none is that\nif there is evidence that you are wrong\nwhat that means is that your world view\nchanges\nright because now we go back to where we\nwere\nand so what I'm kind of curious about I\ntotally think you're on an awesome\nCrusade we we love having you here we're\ngoing to talk in a minute I'm going to\nask a little bit more about details\nabout the work that you're doing in the\nclinic you're opening and stuff like\nthat so we we absolutely like you know\nthink I love your paper and molecular\nPsychiatry and at the same time when I\ntalk to someone who's a crusader it's\nbeen my experience that sometimes those\npeople actually will ignore evidence\nthat they will find the the rigor with\nwhich they approach poking studies\nthat fit with their world view is\ndifferent from the rigor with which they\napproach because you were wronged right\nand then like that psychological hurt\nhas caused you so much you were told\nyou're broken and you've never been\nbroken and I just get a little bit\nconcerned honestly and that's why I'm\nsharing with you I'm really curious kind\nof what you think about this that you\nyou know you kind of say like well I'm\nstating facts\nand you kind of even when you say that\nit sort of implies that other doctors\nwho are offering informed consent in a\ndifferent way are not stating facts\nand they have studies to back themselves\nup too right you just happen to think\nthat those studies are more wrong than\nthe studies that you believe in and\nthey're a good Method All methodological\nreasons you've got a PhD in the topic\nI'm not kind of disputing that but I'm\ncurious like you know this the Crusader\nin you makes me concerned that\nyou can't afford to be wrong here\nand that if there's therapeutic value to\nssris I'm concerned that you could be\ndiscounting it to some degree based on\nyour personal experience with this\nbecause I I and the last thing is that\nyou know you can go look for basically\nany problem on the internet\nand by virtue of the internet you're\ngoing to be able to you're going to be\nable to find an echo chamber of people\nwho have SSRI withdrawal I'm not saying\nthat ssro withdrawal isn't real but I I\nthought it was kind of interesting that\nlike what really got you on this journey\nwas basically like you know there's\nsequestered places on the internet where\npeople talk about SSRI withdrawal and\nyou know how psychiatrists harm them and\nI think Psychiatry can absolutely be\nharmful for sure\num and so I'm just a little bit\nconcerned about that I'm curious if you\nkind of thought about that how do you\nkind of approach that of course I\nthought about that so I'd say I'll I'll\ntalk generally not about me in\nparticular so everybody has a bias so\nyou I mean you're part of what is\nhappening here is you're defending your\npractice you know against me I'm I'm\nyou're I'm on you can see what I'm\nsaying some of what I'm saying challenge\nis what you're saying you're defending\nit because you want to think that you're\nyou know you're a clever guy you're a\nhard-working guy you want to you want to\nfeel that you're doing the right things\nfor patients and of course you're just\nan example of the broader profession and\neveryone wants to feel doing the right\nthing so of course you know professors\nof of Psychiatry uh don't want to say\nthat what they've been working on for 20\nyears is wrong so they they have a lot\ninvested in you know their integrity and\ntheir consistency you know and often\ntheir mortgages so everybody has you\nknow everybody's position gives them a\ncertain bias\num you know maybe my bias is is a bit\nmore\num evident because I'm trying to get my\nmessage across here and in very quick\nsegments so I'm you know talking with\nwith gusto but I mean of course you know\nI think everybody has brings some bias\nto the table\num you know that is that is inherent to\nbeing a human whether it's professional\nbias or personal bias I mean I guess the\nscientific literature you know\ntakes that into account you know you you\ncan't just publish you know an essay\nthis is Mark this is what I think about\nstuff that's what you put on a Blog you\nknow when you when you submit scientific\nevidence it has to be with a with a\nclear methodology it has to be seen by\npeer reviewers in order to maybe not\neliminate but minimize bias so if I if I\nwrite a paper about risk factors around\nyour business withdrawal okay yes I've\nexperienced it but I'm I'm using the\ndata that I've collected from different\nstudies and I put it together and if\nreviewers think I'm being biased they'll\ntell me and they'll and they'll and I'll\nhave to respond to get it published so\nyou know the idea behind\nyou know the publication process is to\neliminate personal bias which of course\nis a universal issue uh that's that's\nthe kind of General answer that everyone\nhas bias and there are ways to to try to\nto manage it and I\nI would say I'd use the antibiotic\nexample you know I've had I've been\nnauseous from antibiotics I'm not here\ntelling you antibiotics are terrible\nwhat happens to me was that I was jolted\nout of my of my Paradigm because uh you\nknow 10 years ago I would have I\nprobably would have been more you know I\nwould have been more biologically minor\nthan you are I would have been saying is\nwhat I've been taught I've seen the\nmeta-analyzes\num you know I was a I guess I'd be a\nregular biopsychosocial you know I pass\nall the exams uh I had an experience\nthat made me re-examine this the studies\nand it wasn't me having withdrawal\neffects that made me critical it was me\nreading\nyou know critical uh work different\nviews and slowly the penny you know\ndropped that things that I had thought\nwere absolutely true were not as clear\nso you know I feel like I've been pushed\non a journey by my experience you know\nbut I I am talking to you in fact when I\nsay 70 of people have been diagnosed\nwith depression that's not my opinion\nyou know I can send you the the\nreference so you know not diagnosed with\ndepression 70 of people meet criteria\nyou're right there's a big difference\nthere yes yes\nuh so uh you know uh I would say look if\nit turned out that for a small\nproportion of people and your business\nwere very effective and it you know it\nmatched their biology in some way you\nknow I would take that into account I\nthink you know looking at what's\nhappened so far the effects are very\nsmall I'm not saying it shouldn't be\nused for anybody I'm not a complete uh\nunmovable on that that idea I'm I'm\nlooking at you know what exists what\nstudies show comparing the benefits and\nthe harms so let me just uh ask a\nquestion about that so we do have\nstudies right so you're saying that the\npurpose of peer review is to remove bias\nso we have studies rcts that show that\nssris are effective for people correct\nor incorrect we have studies that those\nare the published results\nso look uh I don't know how much longer\nyou have but but you know there's a few\nthings there's study there are lots of\nstudies that show I mean there's\nmeta-analysis you don't do websites\nthere's studies that put all the studies\ntogether and they show that\nantidepressants\na statistically significantly more\neffective than Placebo at six to eight\nweeks that that is I don't I don't\ndebate that\nthere are several problems with those\nstudies that mean that whether that\nmeans that that doesn't have a lot of\nrelevance in the real world and I'll\njust give you I'll summarize it in 60\nseconds one they go for six weeks people\nget their drugs for months or years\nbenzos are effective at six weeks\nopioids maybe even alcohol for social\nanxiety would be benefit beneficial at\nsix weeks that doesn't say very much at\nall about years or months\npeople before those studies start are\ntaken off other antidepressants often\nand withdrawal effects can affect the\npeople in the placebo group uh the two\npoint difference between people in\nPlacebo and in in antidepressants has\nbeen thought by most people to be not\nclinically significant in other words\nit's too small a difference to make a\ndifference\num\nthis is my point right so when we when\nwe kind of say okay the purpose of\npeer-reviewed studies is to remove bias\nfrom the equation it's not perfect it's\nnot perfect of course right and and I'm\nI'm with you I don't disagree with any\nof your criticisms I'm just kind of\nnoticing that like when there are\npeer-reviewed studies suggesting that\nantidepressants are effective right this\nis where you add all the caveats and I\nthink you've got good reason for it so\nI'm I'm totally with you I'm just kind\nof pointing out that like and I'm not\npro SSRI or anything like that it you\nknow I think it's just it's interesting\nbecause I think when you kind of talk\nabout this personal Crusade the penny\ndropped that seems to me to be like a\nvery very I'm not criticizing it but\nlike that's got to shape the way that\nyou see things right because you're\nright you're not out here crusading\nagainst antibiotics because there isn't\na personal this is who I am and I was\nbroken and once we sort of add that to\nthe equation it changes the way that\nyou're kind of approaching this whole\nissue I would say this I mean for\nexample there are lots of academics who\nsay antidepressants have you know\nchanged my life or I've seen it you know\nhelp my patients and of course all of\nthose people are then going to bring\nvery strong biases to their\ninterpretation so absolutely I'm just\nI'm just noticing that you're bringing\nthis up to someone who's criticizing\nstudies where you're used to this\nstudies not being criticized you know in\nin in Mass General so I I just where do\nyou get that assumption\nwell you know I I mean I so I haven't\nseen you know your channel but I I guess\nall of the questions you're asking me\nyou know would apply to any Professor\nstanding up and saying uh you know these\nanti-presidents definitely work you know\nthey all they all have certain uh maybe\nthey're better at hiding it maybe I'm a\nbit uh wearing my heart on my sleeve\nhere uh but you know they're all going\nto bring certain biases uh to their uh\nto their presentations and I a lot of\nwhat I'm saying I mean I'd love to talk\nmore about the antidepresso studies\nbecause it's a very interesting uh you\nknow area how how these studies are\nconducted and what they actually show\nversus how people interpret them yeah\nthese are studies that are done by other\npeople I I'm I'm I'm recounting to you\nsome of these uh findings uh but you\nknow these this has been done by clock\ngroups so so it's hardly in other words\nI don't accept the premise that I've got\nsome idiosyncratic view of the\nliterature you know these are views held\nby a lot of scientists uh you know I I\nagree with your points I'm with you I'm\nwith you so so I don't think your view\nis idiosyncratic and you're right that\nI'm applying the same standard to you\nthat I and this is what Jerry this is\nthe standard that Jerry Rosenbaum taught\nme to apply which is like when someone\nand you know he's and that's what's\ngreat I mean I I really appreciate my\ntraining I think my training there is\nvery instrumental to the way that I\napproach ssris I don't have anywhere\nnear the experience or expertise in the\nsubject that you do but even looking at\nstudies and recognizing bias so you're\nright that I'm applying the same\nstandard to you\nthat I think we we apply to people with\nssris and and so or who are pro ssris\nare talking about the studies my point\nis simply that there's a bias I mean I'm\ndetecting and it doesn't mean you're\nwrong right it just means that you're\npassionate\nand oftentimes I think most of the\nadvances that we have in Psychiatry\nactually come out of people who are\nactually heavily biased\nand and people who believe in something\nright so if we look at something like\nMarshall Linehan and dialectical\nbehavioral therapy and it's not uncommon\nfor the leaders in the field of\nPsychiatry to struggle with these\nproblems themselves find actually that\ntreatment is insufficient\nand then look for something better and\nwhat they bring back to us is exactly\nwhat I think you're doing here which is\nawesome which is like hey this didn't\nwork for me and I looked at it\nI know what I'm talking about here's\nwhat I think and this is kind of my view\nand I think it's great I think that it's\njust interesting because I'm curious I I\nmean I've seen a lot of those studies\ntoo I fall on the side of being like I\nthink ssris are way oversold\num and so I just kind of wanted to point\nthat out and was curious about that it's\na good point I mean I\nI I you know I don't think that's my\nmessage I'm not saying anti-person\ndidn't work for me so you guys shouldn't\ndo it either that's you know that would\nbe yeah I'm going to be an irresponsible\nmessage you know I'm not you know it\nwould be a reasonable thing that's the\nmessage I think we got for you I think\nthe message we got from you is I'm I\nguess I'm saying you know and I and I\ntake you at your point you know I guess\nI'm saying I was forced to reappraise\nwhat I'd been taught in an unusual way\nthat I wouldn't normally have done you\nknow and what I found I found disturbing\nyou know I found it to be different to\nwhat I'd been taught and you know it was\nthat understanding that I think has\npropelled me if I just had a bad time on\nantidepressants you know I get some\npeople love Coca-Cola some people hate\nit you know I get those I guess you know\nI'm I'm here I'm on this uh stream\nbecause you know I think people should\nbe aware of the issues with with these\nstudies much more than they already are\nyeah absolutely so let me ask you we\nhave one question from the audience and\nthen we'll give you a chance to kind of\ntell us a little bit about your work\ndoes that work for you is it so um so\npeople are a little bit curious about uh\npmdd\nso pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder\num so I guess we've had a couple of\ncomments about how people have found\nssris to be very very helpful in helping\nthem manage pmdd do you have any\nthoughts about that or how that could be\nyou know because this is a different\npathophysiology we're talking about\nwe're not talking about a serotonin\ndeficiency do you think that there may\nbe value to ssris for people with pmdd\nso so I can't say I'm an expert in pmdd\nbut you know I would say this\nantidepressants are used for about 45\ndifferent conditions anxiety depression\npain pmdd chronic fatigue that itself\nshould make people think there are very\nfew other medications that are used in\n45 different conditions you know it's\njust it what it suggests is that there\nis a non-specific mode of action because\nif it works for pmdd as well it suggests\nthat there's something not specific\nabout pmdd and it comes down to is it\nworking through something like numbing\nor reducing uh the intensity of emotions\nwhich would apply to almost any emotion\nand to pain and so I think that the fact\nthat it's being used for most blood\npressure medications are used for blood\npressure and diabetes for diabetes very\nfew drugs are used for a whole range of\ndifferent disorders I think that points\nto the non-specific mechanism that's\nthat's something that's a great I love\nthat answer so so just to kind of bounce\nthat back so if we look at ssris there\nisn't this\num it or you know you don't think that\nthere's this kind of like magic bullet\nthing where there's serotonin deficiency\nin the brain there's this highly\nspecific mechanism of action and that\nssris fixed this problem but what they\ndo do and we have good evidence of this\nright you sort of said 50 to 70 percent\nof people in one study are in a\nmeta-analysis notice that there's\nemotional numbing and so you're what\nyou're kind of saying is that if we look\nat all these conditions like let's say\nfibromyalgia even things like\npost-stroke recovery there's there's\ntrials that show that ssris improve the\nrate at which people recover from\nStrokes\num and uh I I haven't that's not my area\nof expertise it's you know just a couple\nof studies I've seen\num and pmdd that there is a non-specific\naction which could be something as\nsimple as numbing which sounds like\nthat's the thing that you are the most\nconvinced that ssris do which is numb\nstuff and that there may be a\ntherapeutic use for that in a variety of\nconditions but it's not like it's a\nsilver bullet for anything else is that\na fair representation of what you said\nmostly I mean I I would say you know yes\nthat seems to be the most obvious effect\nof these drugs there are all sorts of\nhypothesized biological mechanisms and I\nthink what's important is that people\nunderstand that for example if you're\nyou know to send back what you've just\nsaid you know if you tell someone this\ndrug will fix a chemical imbalance it'll\nbe some sort of key they're not going to\nstop it you know why would they why\nwould they say no to it if they're told\nthat this might numb them they're\nprobably going to think it's a\nshort-term solution it's not a real deep\nsolution so yes you know if you took one\nthing from all the things I've talked\nabout I think that letting people the\npublic know that that may be the way it\nworks will will they might use the drugs\nstill I'm not going to prevent anyone\nfrom doing that they may think about it\ndifferently because you know it's the\ndifference between giving someone a\nsling for a broken arm and an operation\nyou know no one's gonna say no to a\nsling but they might think about it\ndifferently especially long term yeah\ncompletely agree and and just to wrap up\nuh Mark any questions for me actually I\nI know I've been\nuh no no it's been it's been I'm gonna\nwatch some of your videos now I've I've\ngot an insight into your world it sounds\nvery interesting you've got a very uh uh\ncareful way of looking at things which I\nappreciate so I'll I'll watch your your\nvideos was there anything that I said\nthat you felt was kind of out of line or\nor that no no I I understand obviously\nthe the the last sort of questions I\nunderstand why you asked them and I uh\npeople of course said that to me before\nuh you know I bring my personal\nexperience front and center because I\ndon't want to I don't want to seem like\num I'm in the Ivory Tower saying you\nknow all of you are weak for using these\ndrugs and you've got to face the hard\nstuff in life you know I feel like I'm\nin the same boat as everybody else and I\nand I want to make that clear so I'm not\njust a guy you know in an academic\nbuilding somewhere writing writing\nthings down so I you know I do think\nthat my personal experience gives me you\nknow an insight into things and that's\nwhy I bring it to the table absolutely\num so do you want to just tell us a\nlittle bit about so it sounds like you\ndo some work at the NHS but then you've\ngot a couple of the things that you're\nkind of working on you mentioned you're\nopening up a clinic in the U.S do you\nwant to just tell us a little bit about\nthat sure so I co-founded outro Health\nwith some Canadian entrepreneurs who\nhave run different medical clinics\nbefore\nmost of the founding group have\nthemselves come off antidepressants and\nhad trouble with it and we're\nessentially trying to build something\nthat involves a sort of care that we\ncouldn't find I mean you've heard I had\nto work it out myself one of the people\ninvolved is a woman called Adele framer\nwho founded surviving antidepressants\nand she gives advice to people on how to\nsafely stop antidepressants because she\ncouldn't find Medical Care it sounds\nlike you may be an exception who's very\nuh diligent on these things but most\ndoctors you know are still taking people\noff these drugs very quickly in a linear\nway and we know they can cause people\nall sorts of trouble especially when\nwithdrawal symptoms aren't recognized\nand so we've built a system that we've\npiloted in Canada where we help people\nto come off gradually in the ways that\nI've described in this hyperbolic way\ntaking account of the different effects\nof small doses using things like liquid\nversions of the drugs we provide you\nknow wrap around support we have\nspecialized nurse practitioners and\ncounselors\nand we want to bring that to America\nnext year probably in California\nand people can already see there is\nthere's some information on outro Health\nOnline and we hope we can help with\nAmericans as I've helped in my clinic in\nEngland and we've done some work in\nCanada and do you all have studies about\nthis sort of methodology that you use\nabsolutely so we will publish a\num a paper on the the pilot that we've\ndone with 50 people uh next year and\nthere's already some studies out there\nabout if you want to talk about\nhydraulic tapering in particular there's\na Dutch group that have already done\nsome work taking people who couldn't\ncome off their drugs uh in the sort of\nlinear quick fashion with their doctors\nwho when given the capacity to make\nsmaller changes over a longer period of\ntime using compounded medications called\ntapering strips they've shown that uh 85\nof people none of whom could get off\nbefore with their with their doctors\ncould come off and I'm also part of a\nrandomized controlled trial in Australia\ncomparing hypoallect tapering to care as\nusual it'll take a couple of years to\nget done and there's there's people\naround Europe now doing similar trials\nso there'll be more and more research in\nthis area which of course is what will\nmake change people's minds of course so\nbut just just to clarify so it sounds\nlike y'all don't have a it sounds like\ny'all are going to publish a\npeer-reviewed pilot next year exactly\nexactly but based on your clinical\nexperience and your personal experience\nthat that and all the basic science\nbehind it you're very convinced that\nthis is very effective so so no you know\ntake my opinion for it I wouldn't I\nwouldn't ask you to do that it's now the\nnational guidelines in England so I\ntalked I talked about\num how the the guidelines in America and\nEngland up until a couple of years ago\nand Canada all said to come off the\ndrugs slowly that's no longer the case\nin the UK so there was a a complete\nchange in the guidelines last year where\nthey now say some of the things that I\ntold you come off over months or years\ncome down to very small doses using\nliquids often to less than a milligram\nat a rate that the person can tolerate\nthat's the guidelines on the Royal\nCollege of psychiatrists and also the\nguidelines from nice so that's for\npsychiatrists for GPS as well awesome in\nEngland the public health system has put\na call out for increased services to\nhelp people stop antidepressants because\nthey've recognized there's an issue with\nover prescribing uh and so we are\nessentially applying what is now\nstandard practice in England\nit hasn't come yet to North America the\nthe there's been no change in the\nguidelines according to the researchers\nthere has been in the UK and we're\nbringing that I guess that progress in\nthe UK to America uh and and North\nAmerica\nso I'm just a tiny bit confused so you\nsaid there are changes in in the UK so\nthere there's this Dutch group that's\ndone this research so this the changes\nin the guidelines in the UK were based\non the research from the Dutch people or\nwhat's that based on so the UK so in the\nUK you know every 10 years they review\nthe guidelines so there's been actually\ntwo guidelines on this topic one is a\nguideline on safe withdrawal of drugs of\ndependence and withdrawal which includes\nantidepressants and the other one is in\nthe depression guidelines and so they so\na committee uh in the UK government uh\ngoes to gets performs a synthetic review\nperforms they get a committee together\nof GPS psychiatrists members of the\npublic and they generate a guideline and\nbased on based on Mark hold on a second\nso like you're telling me that you guys\nfollow the UK guidelines but the UK\nguidelines are people sitting around a\ntable expert opinion the same way we end\nup with the DSM\nno no it's a very different process I\ndon't know if you're familiar with\nguideline developers so DSM was not a\nguy it was not a DSM was a consensus\ndocument you know I can I can I can show\nthere's a there's a 584 page systematic\nreview underlying the nice guidelines so\nthey so you know they There are rules\nyou can't have conflicts of interest\nit's an independent UK uh um what I'm\ncurious about Mark is is what studies\nwhen they talk about hyperbolic tapering\nso I and and maybe this is unbelaboring\na point and but so it sounds like\nthere's a lot of research being done but\nif they've implemented guidelines that\nwould imply that their peer-reviewed\nstudies that show that hyperbolic\ntapering is effective so what they do is\nthey they use the hierarchy of evidence\nyou know which will be familiar with\ntheir stuff yeah analyzes with synthetic\nreviews randomized controlled Trials of\ncourse in in the field of anti-diversity\nprescribing at the moment you know there\nare no meta-analyzes there are no\nsystematic reviews the studies that they\nfound I can I can show you I can show\nyou some of the highlights of what they\nfound uh they found there's two\nrandomized controlled trials that\ncompared four-week tapering and an\nAbrupt tapering they found one that that\ncompared two-week tapering to abrupt\ntapering which I had no difference there\nare observational studies that show that\ntapering over several months reduces\nwithdrawal effects and relapse Mark hold\non a second so yes I I'm not sure if I'm\nmisunderstanding or\nso you wrote a paper in molecular\nPsychiatry that was a meta-analysis of\nmeta-analysis that's like good evidence\nright that's when you guys said look if\nwe look at all of this data we have\nfacts let's say that\nthe serotonin hypothesis of depression\ndoes not have good scientific support\nso\njust to just to understand this that's\nnot what we're talking about with\nhyperbolic tapering what we're talking\nabout with hyperbolic tapering is that\nyou're very convinced it works and there\nare UK guidelines but it sounds like\nthere are not meta-analyzes that this is\neffective and that those studies are\neither rcts you guys have a pilot I just\nwant to make sure that we're I\nunderstand that that's fine there's no\nmeta-analysis because there are no\nrandomized controlled trials so we're so\nthe main the main from what I can tell\nfrom the the nice guidelines committee\nthe main rationale is a biological\nrationale so after understanding that\nvery small doses have you know almost\nhalf effective large doses it's hard to\nask people to do linear tapering so you\nknow you you if you think through the\nhierarchy of evidence you know I mean\nI'm with you so so what I'm what I'm\nhearing is that there's\nvery very strong basic science evidence\nthere is very very strong let's say\nobservational evidence which it means\nstudies and there's no published\nrandomized control trials yes\nI'm not uh I'm happy to be very clear\nabout that yes that's the state of the\nscience you know we we published a paper\non i bullet tapering 2019 that was the\nfirst paper about us and we're four\nyears later it's you know it's exciting\nthere's a couple of studies but yes\nthere's nothing published on randomized\ncontrolled trials that that is that is\nthe state at the moment and and you're\nright the main the main rationale you\nknow is is on a biological rationale for\nit's very hard to make the arguments uh\nthat that going down in a linear way\nmakes sense after seeing what the effect\nof the drugs is on the brain absolutely\nright so so like you still feel that\nthis is\nthe right thing to do you have a lot of\nbasic science understanding of this we\nunderstand how things get metabolized we\nalso based on this sort of knocking down\nthis serotonin hypothesis of depression\nit opens up a new way to think about why\npeople have relapses or recurrences of\ndepression after they taper ssris\neverything that you've said still stands\nit just sounds like when we're really\ntalking about you know are there rcts\nthat show that this is effective we're\nreally in the early stages of that\nbecause we've just sort of figured out\nthe basic science there are clinical\nprotocols that are being implemented\nclinical protocols that seem to be\neffective and now we've reached the RCT\nstage which is where we're at Fair\nabsolutely there's not rcts absolutely I\nmean you you the the so the\nobservational trials uh what you could\nthink of as uh\nsame\nretrospective studies with the person\nhaving experienced before tapering\naccording to their GPS and now with the\nhyperbolic tapering and so it's not a\nrandomized trial but what it is is a for\nan individual they've tried it both\ndifferent ways to their own control\nnot doesn't meet the level of an RCT but\nyes you're exactly right in in your in\nyour grasp of what what the existing\nevidence is yeah and I think one of the\nmost confusing things so I see this a\nlot in complementary and alternative\nmedicine you know if you look at\nsomething like meditation\nso meditation is now an evidence-based\nintervention for all kinds of stuff\ndepression anxiety whatever but if you\nreally think about it 50 years ago\nthere was a lot of pushback that\nmeditation worked a lot of people said\nhey I meditated it's helped me a lot you\nknow it really does work and\noftentimes what happens is the Discovery\nactually precedes the randomized control\ntrial and meditation has worked for 3000\nyears the only thing is now we have\nevidence for it because we actually\nsystematically studied it but that\ndoesn't mean that you know I think this\nis something that people miss a lot is\nthat oftentimes the discoveries of what\nworks\npredate the evidence of what works\nI'm in both camps I absolutely you know\nI'm a follower of evidence-based\nmedicine I think it's it's utterly\nimportant we do randomized controlled\ntrials that's why I'm very happy to be\npart of one in Australia I also think\nthat after you see the way the drugs\naffect the brain it's very hard to make\nthe argument we should be halving\nhalving in and stopping I mean all right\nsure I'm not I'm not I'm not I know I'm\nnot trying to uh oversell what the\nexisting evidence is I think there's\nthere's gaps uh but I also think that\nthe rationale is strong you know I think\nin part the committee was also affected\nby\num how widespread hydraulic tapering is\namongst people coming off in pled\ncommunities so if you go if you go\nonline you'll see this story it's not\nit's you know I know it's anecdotal but\nthe story is I went to my doctor I came\nup over four weeks I was describing Mass\nI've come off over a year you know I'm\nnot a screaming mess yeah you know I\nlook I'm not I don't want to get away\nfrom no I I think there's a beautiful\nfollow-up discussion to be had about how\nseriously should we form guidelines\nbased on what people say on the internet\nyou know I think this is whereas\nacademics will be very paternalistic\nabout it we'll say oh like that's a low\nlevel of evidence but like you know a\nlot of people I mean when I've got\nproblems I don't you know there's a lot\nof good stuff out there and I think it's\na great discussion anyway mark thank you\nso much for coming on I can see that it\nwas light outside when we started and\nit's dark outside today thank you so\nmuch for sharing your perspective on\nthis stuff I think it's really a\nrevolutionary idea that you have I think\nthere seems to be just budding and\ngrowing evidence to support it\num I think it mirrors a lot of what I've\nseen in clinical practice uh I think it\nreally speaks to this idea that we have\nin Psychiatry where like you know\npharmacology is a very valuable tool for\nharm reduction or population-based\nhealth not even in Psychiatry I've been\nin medicine in general but there's a big\ndifference between harm reduction and\nfixing your problems\nand and so thank you so much for the\nwork that you've been doing thank you so\nmuch for the research that you've been\nputting out\num you know I my clinical practice has\nabsolutely been influenced by the papers\nthat you've published and so I'm really\ngrateful for that as a clinician and I\nhope that my patients are better because\nof the stuff that you have chosen to\npublish and so thank you for that on\nbehalf of my patients and I think\nthere's one patient in mind that I have\nright now that that I think I'm gonna\nkind of reference this talk and and I'm\nreally curious about what they think so\nthank thanks a lot thanks for having me\non it's been great talking to you you've\npushed me you've been very detailed I've\nenjoyed it so do you want to just tell\nus for people who are interested in\nlearning more where can they find more\ninformation about you or you have a\nwebsite or like I've got a slightly\ndinky website uh\nwww.mark horowitz.org I'm on Twitter at\nmarkhorro h-o-r-o uh that's where you\ncan find me awesome thank you so much\nMark okay take care and good luck with\nall the work that you're doing thank you\ncheers cheers bye\nalrighty\nthe meeting has been left all right\nwhat'd y'all think chat\nso that was great I loved it but did\ny'all follow the second half better\nlet's start there\nyeah so his his papers are good but I I\nthink it's important\nsome of it's facts but we actually don't\nhave trials that show that the\nhyperbolic tapering is very we don't\nhave Trials of that right so I think\nthat's an important thing to acknowledge\ndoesn't mean that it's not going to work\nbecause we didn't have trials that\nmeditation was effective long before it\nwas and people were doing it so I think\nthere's just some fundamental problems\nwith evidence-based medicine that we\nsometimes don't quite acknowledge there\nare even papers and evidence-based\nmedicine critiques of evidence-based\nmedicine but I think what's really great\nabout evidence-based medicine I think\nthe reason that it's better than\neverything else\nis that well it's not better than that\nthere are parts of it that are superior\nto everything the thing that it does the\nbest that is we learn from our mistakes\nin a very very good way\nso I was at a conference at Harvard and\none of my mentors was speaking there\nand the conference was on at\ncomplementary and alternative medicine\nand so someone asked the question like\nwhy do you think it is that\nWestern medicine or allopathic medicine\nor scientific medicine or biological\nmedicine whatever you want to call it\nhas dominated the world\nand some of these other traditional\nsystems of medicine like ayurveda or\ntraditional Chinese medicine are not as\npopular\nand a lot of people may say well that's\nbecause evidence-based medicine works\nand those other things don't work that's\npretty wrong I'm pretty sure so for\nexample a lot of our best treatments and\nevidence-based medicine actually come\nfrom those medical Traditions including\nstatin drugs which are derived from a\nChinese medicine called red yeast rice\nbut anyway and so what what my mentor\nsaid which I thought was brilliant\nwas the biggest problem with like\nEastern systems of medicine is that\ny'all don't let things fail\nright so if you look at ayurveda very\nrarely I don't think I've ever seen a\npaper where people in ayurveda will say\nthis actually doesn't work we were wrong\nfor 5 000 years we've been practicing\nthis way and it turns out that we're\nwrong\nthe one thing that evidence-based\nmedicine is very good at is that we will\nsay hey you should do this thing and\nwe'll give you a pill we'll say this\npill will fix your problems but then 20\nyears later we'll actually look at that\nand we'll decide you know what this was\na mistake and we correct it\nand so the strongest thing what I love\nabout the scientific approach to\nmedicine is that we actually are pretty\ngood at catching our mistakes\nover time including the mistakes of our\nsystem of medicine which is like\nclinical trials there's shortcomings to\nclinical trials\nand so I I think you know I encourage\nyou all to to learn more about this\nstuff and I absolutely think that in\nPsychiatry like the basic problem is\nthat\nwe have a population-based approach and\nwe have a harm reduction based approach\nso when we look at Psychiatry we don't\ntry to cure things we gave up the battle\non cure\nand now it's about how can we mitigate\nthe damage that is done by mental\nillness even if mental illness exists\nwhich in some ways it absolutely does so\nif we look at some things like\nschizophrenia for example there's a lot\nof like very good brain scan evidence\nthat this is a pathology within the\nbrain\nbut at some point what happened is we\nhad a lot of people who were sick\nand we didn't have enough people to\ntreat them and this problem is going to\nget worse by the way so the number of\npsychiatrists right now\nhalf of them are over the age of 55. and\nin our lifetimes there will be less\npsychiatric care even though problems\nlike depression and anxiety are\nskyrocketing through the roof more\npsychiatrists will retire in the next 20\nyears than will be trained so this\nproblem is just going to get worse\nand when you have too few psychiatrists\nfor too many patients and you can't sit\ndown and get into the details of what's\nwrong with someone what you can do is a\nharm reduction approach\nI can't get into the weeds with\neverybody but what I can do is give\neveryone a pill\nand for a third of people it'll do\nnothing\nfor a third of people it'll help a\nlittle bit and for a third of people\nit'll help a decent amount\nnow Dr Horowitz says in addition to that\nthat's actually bad because there's an\nassumption that ssris are generally\nspeaking as safe and well tolerated\nmedication right and and he's claiming\nthat there's a lot of damage that gets\ndone from ssris\nso maybe it's actually a bad idea maybe\nwe're not it's not a harm reduction if\nthe SSRI is actually damaging it's\nyou're not reducing any harm because\nwe're creating harm elsewhere\nand so this is a huge problem\nand I think like our take I mean my take\non mental health and I have a bias too\nby the way my bias was that I spent\nseven years studying to become a monk\nbefore I went to med school\nso I remember being a pgy2\nand in a Psychotherapy lecture where\npeople were telling me this is how the\nmind works\nthey were like this is the fact of how\nthe mind works and it was based on you\nknow what Sigmund Freud figured out and\nCarl Jung figured out and stuff like\nthat as well as lots of other you know\nscientific studies and stuff like that\nand in the back of my room I was like\nwait that's not how it works in the East\nthey believe that the mind works a\ndifferent way\nand I had to go through 16 lectures on\nPsychotherapy to understand how the mind\nworks\nbecause they're all these complicated\ntheories about you know\nsuppressed emotions manifesting in\ndreams and like this kind of like you\nknow there's cognitions and behaviors\nand this is also why the behaviorist\ngrew so much because\neveryone was developing these super\ncomplicated theories about what's going\non in the mind and the behaviorists were\nlike\nwe have no idea if that's actually true\nor not\nso we're going to focus on behavior and\nchanging behavior and what works for\nthat\nand so there are a lot of problems and\nmy bias is that like I learned this\ndifferences to the mind which I think is\nbetter\nlike I'm gonna state that clearly I\nthink it's objectively better\nthat's kind of weird\nand why is it objectively better because\nit is based on subjectivity which is\nkind of weird what does that mean so the\nyogis sat down and and I don't know if\nthis makes sense and I'm going on rant\nhere but here's the basic problem with\nthe Western model of the Mind\nthe Western model of the mind is based\non conversation\nso what happened is you had a person\nlike Freud\ntalking to another human being and based\non their words Freud constructed\na model of the Mind based on language\nbut Freud never had the ability to x-ray\nyour mind and we still don't\nand so then all you have to ask yourself\nis what is the gap between what someone\nsays and what is in their mind\nhuge\nand we are so good in Psychiatry that we\ncan actually bridge that Gap a lot of\nthe way\nbut in the East how do they develop\ntheir model of mind\nthey looked within their own mind they\nactually measured their own thoughts\nbecause the only person who can measure\nyour thoughts is you\nand the reason that I like this Eastern\nmodel of the Mind\nis because it's based it's from the\nViewpoint that you yourself will be in\nright so anything that we construct from\nthe outside\nis great if you're sitting on the\noutside but it doesn't help the person\nwho's on the inside\nso the yogis developed a model of the\nmind that is based on being inside your\nhead and where do thoughts come from\nwhere do desires come from and that's\nwhy I think it's so much more robust\nthere's a critical flaw in that model by\nthe way which is that it's subjective\nright it's based on my own things and\njust because I can see my own thoughts\ndoesn't necessarily mean that I\nunderstand what is going on in my mind\nthat's the core problem and that's\nwhat's so cool about yoga is what they\nsort of figured out is how do we remove\nthe subjective bias from our own mind\nand that's when they discovered this\nprocess of meditation\nto transcend your mind to move Beyond\nmind so that you can look at it from the\noutside\nit's literally what they do\nthe observing self\nthere are studies about this and even\nlike brain scans and things like that of\npeople who have done things everything\nfrom die\nto try psychedelics and we've seen what\nkind of happens when people have this\nsubjective experience of looking at\nyourself from the outside\nand I think the reason that it's better\nis because I found it to be more helpful\nfor people\nthere's another good reason for that\nwhich is maybe I'm a worse therapist\nthan I am at teaching meditation right\nso then I'm going to come down on the\nside maybe I'm just a bad therapist\nthat's one explanation for why I don't\nthink it's as good\nif I'm crappy at baking pizzas and I'm\nlike yeah Pizza sucks\nbut I'm really good at making soup I'm\nlike soup is objectively better that's\none reason I could believe this right\nmaybe I just suck at therapy\nanyway if you guys want to learn more\nabout this stuff you know Dr Horowitz\nhas great stuff we do have for those of\ny'all that are interested in this kind\nof like model I agree by the way you\nknow that depression is much more than\ntaking a pill or managing your\ndepression is much more than taking a\npill and especially if we look at\nsomeone who has treatment resistant\ndepression\nwhat does that mean treatment resistant\ndoes that mean that their depression is\nmore severe than someone else's\nthat's what it implies but not really\nwhat treatment resistant depression\nmeans is that the treatments don't work\nwhich means one of two things\neither you are very very sick or we're\ntreating the wrong thing\nand in my overwhelming experience of\nworking with people who have treatment\nresistant depression\nit is not that they are sicker than\nother people it's that we are doing a\nbad job at how we approach the problem\nwe keep on throwing medications at the\nproblem instead of solving the things\nthat create this situation for them\ninstead of teaching them things like\ncoping skills instead of teaching them\nhow to find purpose in life\ncause here's the crazy thing\nany difficult action that you take in\nlife can be made easy if you've got a\ngood reason to do it\nso there's studies that show\nnot studies I'm looking at one study in\nparticular but other studies corroborate\nthat if you go to a social activity the\nenergy drain from the social activity\ncorrelates with or inversely correlates\nwith your purpose and being there\nso if I've got no reason to be there\nit's going to exhaust me\nbut if I have a reason to go then\nsuddenly I enjoy the social activity\nso one of the biggest things that we\nmiss in psychiatrists we go on throwing\ntreatments at people\nwithout ignoring while ignoring some of\nthese basic things which is that you\nhave to have a reason to get out of bed\nin the morning\nwhen I have patients who are suicidal\nyou know what keeps them alive it's not\nthe SSRI I mean sometimes it is maybe\nbut that's debatable what keeps them\nalive is like the people in their life\nor the cats in their life the number of\npatients who've been kept Alive by their\ncat or dog is crazy\nwhat keeps you from killing yourself\nI'll just ask them that question sounds\nlike your life is crap they're like well\nif I killed myself who would take care\nof my pets\nI'm like damn\nthat's crazy that's what people say\nand yet if that's what's keeping people\nalive why don't we incorporate that into\nour treatment\nwe have it from the patient's mouth\nthemselves this is what's keeping me\nalive it's purpose\nnumber one thing\nthat correlates with pornography\naddiction is meaninglessness\neveryone's talking about dopamine and\npeople are also being judgmental and\nthinking that everyone's a pervert\nthat's why we're all addicted to porn\nyou got to have a reason not to watch\nporn that's the antidote to watching\nporn\nthere are studies that show that\novercoming an addiction\nrequires the development of a competing\ninterest\nanyone can be sober because other people\nwant them to for a little while\noh my God I'm going through a divorce my\nspouse is going to divorce me unless I\nstop drinking\nand you can stop drinking for a while\nbecause the threat of that keeps you in\nline\nbut that's still a reason to stop\ndrinking\nand so developing things like purpose\nis critical for your mental health\nJourney\nso many studies right and the thing is\nthese are not the clinical trials these\nare basic science studies these are\npeople when we're really we're not just\ntesting something we're not taking a\nthousand people over here a thousand\npeople over there we're homogenizing\nthem and removing all of individuality\nthese are studies where you like sit\ndown and you talk to human beings or you\ntake a thousand people and you ask them\nwhat matters to you\nand so if you all are struggling with\nyour mental health it's really important\nthat you all start to think Beyond some\nof this medical model\nbecause even within the medical model we\nknow that all this stuff is important\nbut this is not what our system of\nmedicine has developed\nbecause it's hard to study\ndo you all know why cognitive behavioral\ntherapy is the first line treatment for\nso many mental problems it's because\nit's the easiest to study it's\nmanualized it's protocolized there's a\nworkbook you do something on day one you\ndo something on day two it is the thing\nthat removes the most individuality from\ntreatment\nwhich makes it really easy to study\nand the easier it is to study\nthe easier it is to have scientific\nevidence to support it\nthis is why medication everyone loves\nmedication trials\nbecause if you do a meditation trial\nyou're going to get screwed up because\nhalf of your people aren't going to\nmeditate every day\nif you do a trial on exercise adherence\nrates are really low\nbut taking a pill is easy\nwhich is why we have so many studies\nshowing the effects of medication\nbecause it's easy to do\neasiness bias well said that's the\nbiggest bias in medicine\nthe easier something is to study\nthe more evidence we'll have to support\nit\nwe can call that Dr K's bias or\ncherubim's bias\ncredit where credit is due\nand there's a great trial if you guys\nwant to like hear about science for a\nsecond one of my favorite trials is\nsomething called Step BD\nit's this trial on bipolar disorder and\nwhat I love about step BD is it's\nsomething called a naturalistic study\nso in a randomized controlled trial what\nwe do is we give this group of people\nmedication we give let's say this group\nof people placebo\nand then we kind of like measure you\nknow these people get paid to be in this\ntrial so they have to be adherent we\nalso do things like we measure their\nblood levels of the medication to make\nsure they're taking it we do all kinds\nof artificial crap to make sure people\ntake their medicine and then we measure\nthe result in the progress at the end\nwe force people to take it incentivize\npeople to take it and then we measure\nthe progress at the end step 80 is a\nbeautiful study because it's a\nnaturalistic study which means that we\nactually gave it to real people out in\nthe world\nwe gave different medications\nand we paid attention to how many of\nthem stopped taking their medications\nbecause of things like side effects and\nthen we got a much better Real World\nimpact of what this medicine is even if\nthe medicine improves things by 50\npercent but if half the people stop\ntaking it because of side effects the\nactual result is a 25 increase across\nyour population but that's not how we do\nrcts\nin rcts we have complete or close to we\ndo all kinds of things in the trial to\nartificially increase adherence let's\nput it that way\nso I love this trial I think we need to\ndo more naturalistic studies the problem\nis that they're very expensive\nokay\nso if y'all want to learn more about all\nthis stuff like this perspective that's\nwhat we have in Dr K's guide to Mental\nHealth\nright it's this perspective it's all the\nstuff that I think is important for\nmental health that is not actually a\npart of Psychiatry there is psychiatry\nin there just for the sake of rounding\nit out right so we'll explain okay how\ndo you make a diagnosis what are your\ntreatment options what are\nevidence-based treatments that you can\ntalk to your doctor about we have some\nsome of that stuff but the whole point\nis it's not clinical it's all the other\nstuff\nin our guide to anxiety for example we\nhave a video about thought loops\nso this is not like something like sure\nmaybe you can take a medication it'll\nsomehow numb you out and you'll\nexperience if you're thoughtless but why\ndo thought loose happen\nhow do you go about finding your purpose\nright because the doctor say k is saying\noh meaning matters in my life well what\ndo I do with that\nand this is the shortcoming that we have\nin the research is you can do a study\nwhere you can ask 10 000 people what\ncorrelates the most with porn addiction\nyou can discover that meaninglessness\ncorrelates with porn addiction\nbut you don't have clinical trials on\nhow do you help people find meaning\nI mean maybe you do I haven't seen them\nbecause that's hard right how do you\nknow if someone is doing it right\nand if someone doesn't find their\nmeaning at the end of it\ndoes that mean that your methodology is\nbad or they didn't put forth the effort\nor the person who is delivering\nthe intervention was bad like how do you\nknow\nbecause sometimes finding meaning is not\ngeneric\nthen how do we study that in a\npopulation-based system\nhow do you study what individually works\nfor people when you have a system of\nmedicine that looks at populations this\nis the weakness of evidence-based\nmedicine\nso someone came to me and said Dr K will\nthis medication help me the honest\nanswer is I don't know\nwhat I do know is that out of ten\nthousand people this medication helped\nthis percentage on average\nthat's what I know\nbut I have no idea if it's going to work\nfor you\nso if y'all want to learn if you like\nthis perspective definitely check out Dr\nK's guide\na couple of other things so we this is\nalso stuff that we try to work on in\nGroup coaching\nand I don't mean like depression and\nstuff but the problem with group\ncoaching is that people don't understand\nwhat they're signing up for because\nthey're like what am I going to get out\nof it and that's exactly the problem is\nthat we can't necessarily predict what\nyou're going to get out of it because\nwhat you may need is different from what\nsomeone else may need\nso we can't say you will get this\nparticular thing what we can say is that\nyour life will get better\nright for most people not everybody\nthat if you stick with it for a while\nwhat it'll teach you is a way to connect\nwith other people\nto be vulnerable to examine yourself and\nthen what yield you get from that\ndepends\nfor some people there's a benefit to\naccountability because everybody else in\nyour group is doing something they're\ndoing the homework and you're not doing\nthe homework\nand so then you feel bad so you're going\nto start doing the homework because you\ndon't let these people down and then the\nhomework is on talking about your trauma\nor processing your trauma or something\nlike that\nand if that's what the homework's on\nthen you're gonna you're gonna get that\nbenefit\nand so definitely check it out if you\nall are interested and the last thing is\nthank you and apologies for everything\naround the trauma Workshop we're running\na trauma workshop at the end of the\nmonth\nall the spots filled up within about 24\nhours we tried to increase the size a\nlittle bit so we\nadded a few more people but we're\ncapping it at that and the reason we're\ncapping it is because\nI want it to be a good educational\nexperience for the people involved and\ncould we scale it more sure but then it\nwould degrade the quality for everybody\nelse\nso what I did is I I took the scenarios\nin which I actually teach in real life\nwhere at most I will have a lecture hall\nright there's like 200 to 300 people\nthere\nand if you give me eight hours to teach\na course to 200 to 300 people in a\nlecture hall that's pretty good\nif it grows beyond that then people's\nquestions don't\nyou know we don't have enough time for\neverybody's questions\nand you may say well you're not asking\ndoes everybody get a question no it's\njust because people usually share\nquestions\nso 200 or 300 people is like sort of\nlike the max of what I've been able to\nteach at a time\nand that's why our college classes are\nusually like that right\nso you'll have like 200 people in\nchemistry\nbeyond that it gets cumbersome and you\npeople start getting left behind and so\nthe challenge with that is that not\neverybody gets a spot right so we're\nsorry about that and also thank you to\neveryone who signed up within like 24\nhours so that's crazy so we've already\nrecognized that we we think we're on to\nsomething but we want to actually run\nthe workshop first make sure that people\nlike it and it's helpful\nand if that's the case then we'll run\nanother one\nprobably or we'll do it I don't know\nexactly what we'll do we're trying\nsomething new for the first time\nand the basic problem is that we can\nteach you a lot about stuff but how do\nyou actually do it\nwhat are the day-to-day things that you\nneed to do\nthis is the shortcoming of something\nlike twitch or YouTube which is that if\nwe have like an eight hour video about\neverything you should do in your life\nthat no one's gonna watch the video\nright so it just doesn't work in that\nsituation\nwhat happens if one hour and 17 minutes\nin someone's got a question because they\ndidn't understand something well screw\nyou we've got six hours and 43 minutes\nto go\nso you just and then over time you're\ngonna lose people over the course of the\neight hours\nso that's why we're trying to do it this\nway and if you all want to sign up you\ncan still sign up there's a wait list I\nI don't know exactly what's happening\nwith the wait list okay just in full\ntransparency but we're getting the wait\nlist and our hope is to serve you in\nsome way down the road\nokay\nokay awesome\nso can you speak of the false positives\nand non-publication of rep replication\nstudies and journals sure there's not\nmuch to say\nthere's this thing called the\npublication bias which is that if you do\na study and you find nothing it is hard\nto get it published\nbut if you do a study and you find\nsomething it is easy to get it published\nor easier\nso what that means is let's say I've got\na treatment let's say that I say okay\nhere is a note card\nand sniffing a note card will improve\nyour mental health\nand I do a clinical trial where I take a\nnote I give 100 note cards to 100 people\nI say sniff this baby\nsniff away\nand then does it improve their mental\nhealth no\nand then I try to publish a trial\nthat says sniffing note cards does not\nhelp with mental health\nand the Publishers like who the hell is\ngoing to read this\nno one's going to read this we know that\nsniffing note cards doesn't help\nso it doesn't get published\nnow occasionally there are things like\nstatistical anomalies\nthere are things like Placebo effects\nthere are things like research bias\nor straight up cheating\nand someone does a clinical trial\nof sniffing note cards and they discover\nthat oh my God\nsniffing note cards outperforms our best\nmental health treatment\ncures everybody in the trial and then\nyou send that to a publisher in the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine or the\nLancet these top top journals are like\nholy crap this person is discovered the\ntreatment of the century\nsniffing note cards cures Mental Health\nand they want to be the first ones to\npublish it\nso I was talking to someone who worked\nat the New England Journal of Medicine\nwhich is one of the best journals in the\nworld\nand I asked them how do you all decide\nwhat to publish\nand they said there are two things that\nwe try to do\nwe try to be the first paper published\non the topic and the last paper\npublished on the topic\nso if it's the discovery\nwe want it\nif it's the thing that closes the book\nand gives the final answer on the topic\nwe want it\nthat's publication bias\nand it's Rife throughout medicine and so\nif you kind of think about what's the\nimplication of this the implication is\nthat there's a very good chance that\nthings work less well than we think\nbecause we only publish the positive\nstudies\nright\nso that means that on average people's\nbelief that stuff works that nothing in\nmedicine works quite as well as we think\nit does because of this publication\nadvice and even today with like Dr\nHorowitz like that's what we saw right\nhe's like hey by the way through all\nthese studies turns out they're kind of\nBS\nand I I'm I'm with you I I'm with him\nthat I think he's right and I I really\nrespect the dude right and I push him\nsometimes because that's what we got to\ndo\nbut when he's like there's a\nnon-specific effect for ssris because it\nhas like modest effects and all kinds of\nrandom crap that's completely\nbiologically unrelated that makes sense\nto me\nmakes perfect sense to me there's\nsomething weird like kind of numbs you\nout\nso if antidepressants kind of numb you\nout\nwe can see how it won't cure depression\nbut it'll maybe make you feel better for\na little while\nwe can see how if you've got\npremenstrual dysphoric disorder where\nyour mood you get super depressed around\nbefore your period right and this is\nwhere a lot of people will be very very\nlike\nsexist and will say like oh it's your\ntime of the month again I don't think\npeople understand how bad pmdd or for\nthat matter period pain is\nlike just because it happens every month\ndoesn't mean that it doesn't suck\nand it's kind of like well like don't\npeople get used to it well I don't know\nbro if someone came and\nsmacked you in the nuts\nevery day for one week of the month\nwould you get used to it after a decade\nso for some people it's very crippling\nand the other problem with sort of\nsexism around periods is that we're like\noh like you're emotional\njust because someone is emotional\ndoesn't make them wrong\nyou'll get that\nemotions don't mean you're wrong\ncompletely independent\nbut you're like no but I'm super logical\nI'm not emotional\nI'm logical that makes me right that's\nidiotic\neveryone's emotional all the time you're\njust not aware of it\nso the people that I know that think\nthat they are not emotional\nand are being perfectly logical\nare the ones that oftentimes have the\nemotions\npulling the puppet strings on their\nlogic\nand all you have to do is watch any\npolitical debate to see this in action\nboth sides are completely convinced that\nI'm not emotional I'm logical and yet no\none convinces someone else\nand if if I'm logical then I'm right and\nif my logic is correct then you should\nbelieve me right that's how logic works\nit's fact\nidiotic\nso going back to ssris\nso I think it makes total sense that\nthere's a non-specific numbing effect\nso it kind of numbs us out if we're\nsuicidal\nit kind of numbs us out if we have\nfibromyalgia kind of numbs us out a\nlittle bit if we've got pmdd\nand the other thing to remember is that\nthe highest concentration the two\nhighest concentrations of serotonin in\nthe body are in the brain and in the gut\nand I don't know if you all know this\nbut when it comes to menstruation\nyour uterine lining is shedding\nliterally dying\nit's the only process in human\nphysiology that is necrotic instead of\napoptotic\nthat's natural maybe there's one more\nmaybe there's one more and for those of\nyou that don't know what the difference\nis there's something called apoptosis\nwhich is programmed cell death\nwhich means the cell is like hey I don't\nneed to be here anymore\nthis tissue does not belong in this\nplace so I'm going to pack everything up\nand then shut everything down\nit's like shutting down it's like moving\nout of the house we're going to close\neverything up we're going to cancel our\nall of our utilities we're going to pack\neverything into boxes we're gonna move\nit out in an orderly fashion necrosis is\ndeath from damage\nso if I get\nif a truck\nruns me over\nthe cell death that I experience is\nnecrosis\nand when women go through their period\nit's necrosis it is the cell death of\ndamage that's the difference between\nmoving out of your house and burning it\ndown in both Place cases the place is\nempty but one hurts like hell and\ndamages us a lot and the second is like\ntotally chill and by the way the webbing\nin your fingers the you used to have\nwebbing here\nlike where amphibians or mutants or\nwhatever and and the webbing between our\nfingers dies by apoptosis that's how we\nend up with fingers instead of webbing\nprogram Del seldeth it's cells that are\nsupposed to die\nso take it easy on people who have their\nperiods and for those of you all that\nhave really bad periods like my\ncondolences to you and also like it's\nnot your fault and it just kind of sucks\nand that's how biology works\nhopefully you can get some compassion\nfrom the people around you\nyeah it's awful\nright but we gotta like understand like\nas dudes we gotta understand this stuff\ntoo\nwe gotta understand like just because we\ndon't go through it doesn't mean that we\nshould minimize it and doesn't we we\nhave a frame of reference\nright does that make sense like we just\ndon't have anything like that\nequivalently\nyeah someone's asking how do you taper\noff Prozac well\nMark Horowitz would say that you do a\nhyperbolic taper\nwhich apparently is what the UK\nguidelines say now too but I would say\ntalk to your doctor about it\nand maybe ask them about some of this\nstuff so encourage your doctor to read\nup on this stuff instead of assuming\nthat this is the way to do it right and\nthen what I would do is like trust your\ndoctor\nask them to like do a thorough analysis\nof the evidence which I think is good to\nask your doctor to do I don't mind when\npatients ask me to do that by the way\nand like\nI think it's okay like I learned\nsomething it makes me a better doctor to\ndo my homework\nso Sarah is saying for Prozac it's extra\nslow so the real irony here is that for\nProzac\nthe common wisdom amongst most medical\nprofessionals is it's the easiest to\ncome off of because it has such a long\nhalf-life\nwouldn't that also apply to when men get\nangry from our testosterone we usually\nshow emotion through anger so let's\nunderstand a couple things when men get\nangry I don't know that it is through\nyour testosterone or that testosterone\nis to be blamed unless you're on\nsomething like anabolic steroids or\nthings like that that can cause anger\nwe should absolutely be compassionate\ntowards men who get angry\nthis is one of the biggest tragedies in\nsociety\nis when other people get emotional we\nhave compassion towards them right so\nsomeone starts crying we don't say screw\nyou shut the hell up or if people do we\ncall that toxic\nnow the problem is that different human\nbeings respond to stresses in different\nways\nand so if I fail a test some people cry\nand some people get angry\nand Men especially we're conditioned to\nonly be allowed\nto experience one emotion I'm not\nallowed to cry I'm not allowed to be\nashamed I'm certainly not allowed to be\nscared what\nliterally the word that we use to\ndescribe someone who is scared who's a\nman usually is the word\nit's a synonym for the female vagina\nthat is also the word for a cat\nand that's what we call Men We\nde-masculinize them if they experience\nfear\nright\nI don't know if I can say this but we\ncall them\nthat's in our language\nthere is shaming of men for experiencing\nanything except for anger\nand then when men don't know how to\nexpress anything except for anger this\nis the only thing that we know how to\nexpress\nand then we get demonized for it it's\nokay for you to be afraid for a job\ninterview\nit's okay for you to feel ashamed by\nsomeone else there's compassion for that\nit's okay for you to be sad\nbut the one thing that we don't allow\npeople to do is feel angry\nthat makes you a bad person and\nespecially a bad man look at that crazy\ndangerous man he's angry\nthat guy needs to be put in jail\nso we should absolutely be more\ncompassionate towards the expression of\nnegative emotion and we need to\nunderstand that different people\nexperience stress and negative emotion\nin different ways\nand some of those are more societally\nacceptable than others\nand people may say but that's because\nsome are better than others I disagree I\nthink this is part of our societal bias\nas well\nthat we preferentially demonize the\nemotional experiences of men\nand there were there are cases where we\ndo this with women as well like we just\ntalked about menstruation as an example\nthat is a preferential and focused\ndevaluation of the experience of women\nwomen get in a different way it's that\nif you're emotional I'm not going to\ntake you seriously\nand when things matter to us the most\nthat's when we get emotional so it's so\ndamaging because this thing is important\nto me and the one thing that you're\ngoing to do is invalidate\nthe more I care about it the more you're\ngonna crap on me\nand we wonder why there's a mental\nhealth crisis in this world\nright everybody's screwed we're all just\nscrewed in different ways\nand there's no value in comparing how\nscrewed people are men are more screwed\nthan well like that Dynamic needs to\nstop that Dynamic is half the problem\ngetting screwed is not a competition\nit's a co-op game\nand here we are playing versus\nso for all y'all who hear about the\nproblems that someone else is facing and\nyou say but I have it worse that\nresentment\nis exactly what got us here because\nsomeone is saying hey my life is hard\nand you're saying screw you I have it\nworse and then when you say my life is\nhard because I hear a lot of men\ncomplain\nabout when I come like I'm not allowed\nto complain I have it worse right and\nwhat's happening there this like people\non the other side of the table Sometimes\nwomen who are saying screw you you're\npart of the patriarchy\nyou don't you don't get to complain\nand so the invalidation of complaints is\nthe problem it's not the gender that's\nthe problem it's the behavior\nmy experience as a psychiatrist are\ngoing to be who are men women\nor non-binary\n of all shapes and sizes\nright\nand the problem is that\nespecially on the internet some of them\nfloat to the surface\nokay\nI think we're done for the day\nwe ran an hour long\ny'all thank you very much for coming\nhuge shout out to Dr Horowitz we're\ndoing this awesome work\nI mean this guy could in conjunction\nwith his colleagues\nrevolutionize the way that we consider\nPsychiatry and really change the way\nthat we practice which I think is\nawesome and I can't wait to see those\nclinical trials because that's you know\nwe still got to see that and see what\nhappens\num\nyeah\nthis is church the sermon has ended so\nthank you all very much\num you know thank you to everyone who\nsigned up for the trauma Workshop\nthere's an uh there's a command and chat\nfor those of y'all to join the wait list\nand we'll do something right we're going\nto figure something out I don't know\nexactly what uh so sign up for the wait\nlist if you all are interested this is\nnew for us so we weren't expecting it to\nfill up in like one day or eight hours\nor nine hours or what however long it\ntook so that was not we were not\nexpecting that but thank you very much\nwe're gonna do our best\nto live up to your expectations and help\nyou in a substantial and concrete way\nwe have group coaching spots available\nso check those out and if you all are\ninterested in more perspectives on\nMental Health that are a little bit more\nin-depth definitely check out Dr K's\nguide\nand you know maybe check out Dr\nhorowitz's Clinic who knows it sounds\nlike it's coming to California sometime\nin 2024. so thank you to everyone for\ncoming today take care of yourself"
