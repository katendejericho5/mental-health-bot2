    "transcript": "hey y'all today we're going to talk\nabout why therapy sucks for men and that\nmay sound kind of confusing because here\nI am a man here I am a psychiatrist\ndoing Psychotherapy with men so what on\nEarth am I talking about why do I think\ntherapy sucks for men\nin my experience as a psychiatrist I do\nactually believe that there are systemic\nbiases that make it hard for men to\nengage in therapy and today we're going\nto talk a little bit about what those\nsystemic factors are how we can\nunderstand them and even how to overcome\nsome of those factors and move towards\nmore emotional health if you're ready to\ntake the next step on your mental health\nJourney check out Dr K's guide it's an\nimmersive resource that distills over 20\nyears of my experience laid out in a way\nthat is tailored to your needs so if\nyou're ready to better understand your\nmind and take control of it check out\nthe link in the description below so we\nhave to start by understanding where\nthis idea that talk therapy is the gold\nstandard for treating mental illness\ncomes from so what we really need to\nunderstand is that the majority of\npatients in the history of psychotherapy\nhave been women about 60 to 70 percent\nof patients today who engage in\nPsychotherapy are women the other thing\nis that about 60 70 percent of\ntherapists today are actually women so I\nthink what happened early on in\nPsychiatry or Psychotherapy is that the\nmajority of people we were helping were\nwomen and so when me as a doctor when I\nlook at 10 of my patients and I see okay\nso it looks like talking to people about\ntheir feelings on average is the most\nsuccessful thing that I can do\nbut even though that's factually correct\nI may not be taking into account that\nseven out of those 10 people are women\nand maybe the people who are getting\nhelped the most with talk therapy or\ntalking about their emotions are\nactually women and it's not just me that\nsays this if you actually look at the\nAmerican Psychological association's\nguidance for working with boys and men\nthey sort of point out a systemic bias\nin the way that we diagnose men and\nwomen and that's a lot of the diagnoses\nthat women get like depression and\nanxiety which by the way women are about\ntwo to three times as likely to be\ndiagnosed with that stuff a lot of those\ndiagnoses have to do with feelings and\nbeing able to articulate stuff so for\nexample major depressive disorder\ninvolves feeling sad when you're\ndepressed right makes sense and that a\nlot of men are actually diagnosed with\nwhat we call externalizing disorders\nthings like addictions or sociopathy or\nantisocial personality disorder so these\nare disorders that involve Behavior\nbehaviors so I think they're sort of\nclueing us in on a really important idea\nwhich is that when men feel something\nthey act on it as opposed to articulate\nit or talk about it and if we tunnel\ndown into a little bit about how men\ndeal with their emotions we'll kind of\nsee that this is true in general as well\nbecause if you're a man an emotion is a\nproblem to be solved not something to be\ntalked about right so think about like\nif you get bullied on the playground and\nyou feel ashamed of yourself and people\ncall you a fat kid and beat you up that\nisn't something you talk about in fact\nif you go and cry to Mommy or cry to the\nteacher you're actually treated worse\nyou're taught that articulating problems\nand talking to people is cause for\npunishment instead what you're supposed\nto do if you're a man is fix the problem\nright so if kids make fun of me for\nbeing fat I'm supposed to lose weight\nget ripped learn martial arts and the\nnext time they talk I'm going to teach\nthem who's boss it's if you sort of\nthink about it the solution to an\ninternal feeling feeling ashamed is to\ntake an action and change the\ncircumstances that make me feel that way\nif I'm feeling ashamed because I don't\nhave a job and I don't have any money\nwhat should I do about that should I go\ncry to Mommy about how I don't have a\njob or don't have money should I cry to\nmy girlfriend about how I'm broke all\nthe time no if you're a man you need a\nman the [ __ ] up go out there get a job\nand start making money if you're feeling\nbad in here as a man what we're taught\nis you're supposed to go fix the problem\nout there and this also manifests in\nmen's reluctance to engage in couples\ncounseling so oftentimes if you're in a\nrelationship and I'm assuming a\nheteronormative relationship for a\nsecond and you know your wife or your\ngirlfriend says hey I think we need to\ngo see a counselor oftentimes men will\nbe reluctant to engage in that and if\nyou actually look at the research for\nwhy men are reluctant what you discover\nis it's not that they're trying to put\ntheir head in the sand or their avoiding\na problem or anything like that they\nactually feel outgunned in therapy they\nfeel like when they go to a couple's\ncounselor my partner is so much better\nat understanding and articulating their\nfeelings that they can sort of make\ntheir case better than I can and when\nthe therapist tries talking to me like I\njust say I don't know a lot or I'm not\nsure like I don't know how to someone's\nasking me to play basketball but I don't\nknow how to dribble and so what men\nactually feel like in couples counseling\nis that they don't know how to\neffectively communicate so imagine a\nsituation where you're like going into a\ncourt of law and there's a judge there\nand your wife makes her case right she\nsays hey all Oak is neglectful he\ndoesn't appreciate me I do so much for\nhim and I know he works hard but he's\nreally short with me sometimes and it\nreally hurts and I feel really\nunderappreciated and then as a man how\ndo I respond to this I don't speak the\nlanguage of emotions\nand so as a dude you're like you don't\nknow how to communicate in the way that\ntherapists like so men literally feel\noutgunned to engage in things like\ncouples therapy and that's because we as\nmen communicate our emotions in a\ndifferent way so my favorite example of\nhow men communicate differently is the\nnegative expression of a positive\naffection\nso when we like someone and we're proud\nof one of our homies or our Bros we\ndon't say that to them right in fact\nwhat we do is we kind of dog them about\nit if my friend has been single for a\nwhile after a bad breakup and starts\ndating someone else and I feel really\nproud and good about that I don't say\nhey friend I'm really proud of you and\nI'm proud that you've been able to find\nsomeone who sees The Lovable qualities\nwithin you that I see I'm proud that you\nfound someone who treats you the way\nthat I think you deserve to be treated\nwho loves you for who you are in the way\nthat I love you for who you are in the\nhistory of humanity I do not think that\nsequence of words has ever been spoken\nby a single man that's not what we say\nwhat do we say we say brah GG Noob\nyou're whipped I guess we'll never see\nyou again and we're smiling the whole\ntime we're not like\nwhy don't you text me anymore I know you\nhaven't been texting me I feel hurt\ninstead what we do is we actually dog on\nthis guy right we're like we call him\nwhipped and we call him a wuss and we\ncall them like we say all these negative\nthings right like oh where's the Apron\nStrings we'll say all this like\nmisogynistic crap but the whole time\nwe're like expressing appreciation and\nsmiling at him so men have this negative\nexpression of a positive affection when\nwe feel good about something we can't\njust say that right because that's not\nwhat we were taught instead of what we\nhave to do is we have to insult the\nperson that we're proud of\nthat's not how Psychotherapy works right\nso if this is my mode of communication I\ngo see my therapist and my therapist is\nproud of me they don't say hey [ __ ]\nyou got a job you suck I guess you're\nnot going to be coming to therapy\nanymore because you ain't got this time\nbecause you got all this this work to do\nyou know Screw you that's not what your\ntherapist says in fact we're trained to\nsay the opposite so the way that we're\ntrained to speak in therapy is first of\nall don't speak very much right don't\nsolve problems just sit there and listen\nand ask this person lots of questions\nthat they're gonna say I don't know to\nhow do you feel about that how does that\nmake you feel I don't know well how does\nthat make you feel\nI don't know and so then if you're a\ndude and you go to therapy you feel like\nan idiot right because they're asking\nyou all these questions you're supposed\nto know what you feel but you don't know\nand that's because of the way that we've\nbeen taught about our emotions the last\nthing to consider is that when it comes\nto emotional health men are very\nphysical with it so even if I ask a dude\nhey like you know you're it sounds like\nyou got dumped tell me a little bit\nabout how you feel the dude may not be\nable to say I feel unlovable I'm full of\nfear that that perhaps I I won't be able\nto find a partner I'm afraid that I'm\nfundamentally broken in some way that\nprecludes me and maybe destins me to be\nalone for the rest of my life that's not\nwhat dudes say what dudes say is it felt\nlike she ripped my heart out it felt\nlike she stomped on my balls and if you\nsay that as a dude the other dudes will\nknow exactly what you mean right like we\nall know like oh man like oh it's not\njust ripped your heart out it's also a\nstomp on the balls I felt that man the\nlast time I got dumped I found out my\npartner was cheating on me felt like she\nkicked me in the nuts dude I know\nexactly how you feel that's how we talk\nwe're very physical in nature the other\nthing is if you talk to men about who\nsupport each other right and they say\nsay if you get dumped what's the first\nthing you should do hit the gym baby and\nthat's where we may assume that there\nthat this relates to confidence that if\nyou start working out you get buffed and\nyou look at yourself in the mirror and\nyou're like I'm so sexy but we don't\neven acknowledge for a moment that there\nmay be a physiological aspect to improve\nyour mood and one of the biggest\nmistakes that I think we've made in the\nfield of psychotherapy is that we've\nseparated out the Mind from the body\nwhereas if you look at modern science we\nknow that anxiety is not just an emotion\nit's not just in your mind that emotions\nhave physical ramifications that anxiety\ncan induce diarrhea and change the rate\nof your peristalsis anxiety activates\nyour sympathetic nervous system and\nreduces blood flow to places like your\nstomach and increases blood flow to\nother parts of your body\nso we know that emotions are actually\nvery physiological in nature so why is\nit as a society that we've kind of\ngotten on this track of simply talking\nabout them instead of acting physically\nand a lot of the men that I've worked\nwith I've sort of noticed that this\nphysical component is way more important\nthan the talking component at least\ncompared to the women that I've worked\nwith just to give you all a simple\nexample I find that the men in my office\nneed hugs way more than the women now\nthere are a lot of complications to that\nthere's a gender Dynamic right between\nme and the woman where maybe the woman\ndoesn't feel as comfortable to hug me\nmaybe I don't feel as comfortable to hug\nthe woman so I'm not saying that that's\nlike a statement of fact but what I've\nnoticed is that like hugging men the the\npatients in my office who are dudes\nleads to like a lot more emotional\nhealing and sometimes tears and all this\nkind of stuff and like more dick jokes\nafter we're done right so there's\nsomething very physical about the way\nthat men deal with their emotions\nand so if we assume all of this is true\nwhat does this mean for you as a dude so\nI know this sounds kind of weird but the\nfirst thing that I'd recommend is that\nyou actually seek Psychotherapy if\nyou're struggling in some way and that\nmay sound weird because you said Dr K\nthere's a systemic bias yeah but it's\nstill the best evidence-based treatment\nthat we have for dealing with mental\nillness\nmedication is just as good by the way\nand another thing we need to keep in\nmind is that there are randomized\ncontrolled trials on many types of\npsychotherapy which show that they are\nequally effective for men and women so\nit's not like Psychotherapy works it's\njust that if you're engaging in\nPsychotherapy as a man there may be a\ncouple of things that we can arm you\nwith to really make that Psychotherapy\nreally worthwhile\nso the first recommendation that I have\nis that you see at least three\npsychotherapists or at least you see at\nleast three\nbefore you give up on therapy if you\nlove the first one then stick with them\nand so a lot of psychotherapy is about\nfit and it may just be hard to find\nsomeone who's able to communicate with\nyou in a way that is helpful so a couple\nof things that I would recommend some\nlanguage that you can use if you go to\npsychotherapy so the first is just\nsimply let your therapist know hey I'm\nnot really aware of what I feel all the\ntime and I'm not very good at\narticulating my feelings because\noftentimes therapists will say how do\nyou feel and as dudes we don't know how\nto answer that so just be transparent\nwith them at the beginning another thing\nthat I recommend is that you all check\nout this idea of normative male\nalexithymia which is this idea that men\nor by default it's normative so it's\nlike most men are colorblind to their\ninternal emotional state so check out\nour video on Alexa thymia if you all\nwant to and then you can even tell your\nyour therapist that hey I'm concerned\nthat I'm a little bit alexithymic so\nyou're signaling to them that you may\nnot be able to participate in therapy in\na default way the next thing that you\ncan can do is ask your therapist to\nchange their style a little bit if it\nisn't working for you so you can tell\nthem hey I've noticed that you're really\nquiet and then you kind of ask these\nquestions like how do you feel over and\nover and over again and then I keep\nanswering I don't know can you try to be\na little bit more active or offer a\nlittle bit more guidance instead of\nbeing quieter and asking only open-ended\nquestions can you help me understand\nsoftware guide me in some way and some\ntherapists may feel really uncomfortable\nwith that they may turn that around into\na question why do you feel like you need\nmore guidance\nI don't know because this doesn't seem\nto be helping very much so you can just\nask them to change their style a little\nbit and the third thing that you can do\nif number one and number two don't work\nis after two or three sessions I would\njust go to them and say hey I don't feel\nlike I'm actually getting a whole lot\nout of this therapy so you seem to be\nasking certain questions that I have\ndifficulty answering and I'm hoping that\nyou can recommend a different therapist\nwho's a little bit more active can offer\na little bit more guidance or ask\nquestions in a way that can help me\nunderstand my emotions better and I know\nthat this sounds mortifying oh my God as\na dude why would I ever do that as\nanyone as any patient why would I ask to\nsee a different therapist it means that\nI don't think they're good and it\ndoesn't mean that they're not good it\njust means that they're not really\nhelping you very much or at the minimum\nyou can have a conversation about what's\nworking and what isn't and then\nhopefully you all can work through that\nstuff so I as a therapist actually don't\nfeel I mean I feel bad in some ways but\nI'm really grateful for all of my\npatients who have come to me and said\nhey Dr K this is not working because\nthen one of two things happen one is\neither we work on it and then we\nactually make a breakthrough of some\nkind and now we're really jiving\ntogether or I recommend that the person\ngo see someone else and what's my duty\nas a doctor or someone's Duty as a\ntherapist it's to help the person not\nhelp the person myself\nit means giving that person whatever\nkind of help they need\nso oddly enough I'm still recommending\nthat you'll try Psychotherapy because it\nis still an evidence-based very\neffective approach\nthe other thing to consider though is\nthat a lot of emotions live in our body\nand as men sometimes we need to do more\nbodily stuff so there are studies that\nshow that Tai Chi and yoga for example\nare effective treatments for a lot of\nthings like mood disorders or anxiety or\nthings like that so adding a physical\ncomponent to your emotional health is\nvery very helpful the other thing to\nconsider is that there's a range of new\nand kind of in Vogue things called\nsomatic therapies so these are therapies\nthat incorporate the body in some way so\ngood examples of this are EMDR or EFT\nwhich is the emotional freeing technique\nor tapping so when I first encountered\nthese studies about 10 or 15 years ago\nand I used to sort of my area of\nInterest was evidence-based\ncomplementing alternative medicine I\nthought all this stuff was like kind of\nBS right so it's like the idea behind\ntapping is that your emotions are stored\nin your body and that you can tap on\ncertain parts to free emotions and I was\nlike this doesn't make any sense I'll be\nyes and it turns out that over the last\ndecade or so there have been some\nstudies that actually show that this is\na pretty effective technique we're not\nreally 100 sure you know the studies\naren't super high quality but there's\nmore and more evidence that stuff that\nis not classically effective may be\neffective and specifically that a lot of\nsomatic therapies seem to be gaining a\nlot of weight and gaining a lot of\ninterest so I encourage you all to seek\nout more bodily oriented kind of\nevidence-based techniques\nand the last thing that I just want to\nshare with you all is that I've seen\nthat across the globe there's a lot more\nmen's work kind of going on and this\nisn't psychotherapy but it's just sort\nof groups of men will get together and\nwill participate in all kinds of either\ncommunication or even like some sorts of\nlike physical rituals or like taking\nhikes there's sort of this very like\nphysical component to to their emotional\nhealth which they all sort of get\ntogether and do so I can't speak to\nspecific things like that I'm just sort\nof pointing that out is a trend so at\nthe end of the day I know it sounds kind\nof weird but I do think that therapy\nsucks for men for a lot of reasons some\nof that has to do with the way that\nwe're raised some of that has to do with\nthe way that Psychotherapy was developed\nand so as men we sort of really need to\nthink a little bit about how can I\nbecome emotionally healthy so I\ndefinitely give therapy a shot but go in\nwith some of these disclaimers in mind\ngo in understanding that you may not be\nperfectly suited to this that you're\nstepping onto the basketball court but\nyou don't necessarily know how to\ndribble and so just recognize that and\nask your therapist for help and the\nsecond thing to consider is that\nespecially as men a lot of our emotions\nlive in our bodies we may need to\nleverage our bodies or do some kind of\nbodily work to really help us achieve\nemotional health\n[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]"
