    "transcript": "the one uniform thing that I think is\nresponsible for the rise in social\nanxiety across our generation starting\nwith Millennials it is getting worse the\ndeeper down we go the younger we get is\nthe use of technology so what started to\nhappen is we've stopped relating to\nother people like in person we do things\nlike DM each other on Discord and when\nwe use online based communication a lot\nof our empathic and social circuitry\nstarts to rust when human beings used to\nsit around around a fire and like talk\nto each other two thousand years ago\nthey're all of these circuits in our\nbrain that started to develop that\nmeasure tone body language facial\nexpressions and as those circuits\ndevelop those things reassure us as we\nmove on to more online communication\nthose parts of our brain rust because if\nI'm dming 15 people on Discord I can't\nmeasure tone I can't see body language\nso those parts of our brain start to\nshut off in the same way that you forget\na language if you don't use it"
