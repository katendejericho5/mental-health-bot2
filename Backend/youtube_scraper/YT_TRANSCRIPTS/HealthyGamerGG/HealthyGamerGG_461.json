    "transcript": "hey what's up dude\nhi\nhow are you yeah I've been pretty good\nactually it's a\num\nI think it's like on the on the way up\ndoes that make sense yeah so I think the\ndirection matters a lot to me and I\nthink I was up and that's really good\nyeah direction is really important\num is there something in particular you\nwanted to talk about today\nwe just catch up for what yeah just\ncatching up sure yeah we could we could\nkind of start like that and then you\ncould kind of like inquire about like I\nguess certain things that\num it's kind of hard to pinpoint like\nstuff to talk about right sure but I\nmean there's so much talk about that I\nguess well I guess we'll find something\nfor sure I I have a feeling that's gonna\nbe the case yeah\nyeah so um do you want me to catch you\nup first or you want to catch up first\ndo you want me to you want to just catch\nme up or you want to hear what yeah yeah\nyou want to do yeah um just have you\nbeen what have you been doing overall so\nI think we last spoke on stream a couple\nyears ago I know that we you know we've\nconnected here there\num so I think since we last spoke\nhealthy gamer has grown a lot\nuh we started off like sort of focusing\non trying to just help people on Twitch\nyeah and I think we sort of quickly\nrealized that like a lot of people out\nthere have problems and we're trying to\nhelp a lot of those people\num so I think maybe a lot of people\naren't familiar with this but we do a\nlot of like not mainstream stuff but\nmainstream on sort of the medical side\nso we do a lot of work with the American\nPsychiatric association did some stuff\nwith the office of the U.S Surgeon\nGeneral\num have done some stuff with the United\nNations so we kind of do all that stuff\nyeah and then we also uh basically built\nup first couple maybe a year and a half\ntwo years I was streaming people asked\nlike thousands and thousands of\nquestions\nso for the last like year or two I\nrealized that like I need to answer all\nthose questions so we started making\num doing more lectures\nand really explaining mental health\ntopics to people and that seems to be\ngoing really well\nI think we also sort of found that when\nwe were really blowing up on Twitch that\nwe were attracting the wrong kind of\npeople in some ways\nand then we sort of had like an internal\nlike existential crisis about like who\ndo we want to be do we want to be big\nand Chase drama\nor are we okay with our numbers\nshrinking and staying true to like\ntrying to help people and we ultimately\nchose the latter\num and I think a lot of our numbers and\nstuff have suffered as a result but I\nthink that's okay\nyeah because then yeah for sure because\nthen if the impact that you want to have\nuh it's I guess a little bit more\ntargeted right right you're achieving\nyour goal but\num yeah I think I think the whole like\ndrama audience or like more I guess\ncontroversial uh type thing that's I\nguess\nit would make it harder to navigate with\nthe chat and with the interaction right\nbecause then it's cluttered with a lot\nof people that aren't there for the\nright reasons I would I would assume\nyeah and it makes it like a\nnon-discussion in chat that's what I\nwould be afraid of anyway yeah and I\nthink that there's a lot of actually\nvalue to doing drama stuff not because\nit's drama but because if we sort of\nthink about what are the hardest times\nin our lives it's when there's drama in\nour life yeah and so helping someone\nnavigate through drama I think is\nactually like a really really important\nthing to teach other people so there's\nparts of it that were like totally fine\nwith but\num you know it was getting to the yeah\nit started feeling a little bit\nambulance chaser-ish\nin English that is about like lawyers\nwho chase ambulances so if you think\nabout like okay if there's some kind of\naccident or injury where are you gonna\nfind your best clients by chasing an\nambulance but then what you're also\ndoing is like chasing an ambulance\ntrying to find a client when someone's\nbeen hurt so\nyou know we're back and forth\num we're learning a lot growing a lot\nbut overall all good yeah well so I\ndidn't want to interrupt you I'll watch\nsome clips of you and a lot of times you\ntalk about certain topics even like the\nsimplest phrase you say sometimes will\nbe the enlightening and I'll take you\nhome you know\num\nsometimes something as simple as you\nknow last time we were talking about\nlike I think it was addiction and then\nyou said that um\num\nit's like um\nyou know you talk about like the\nsolution and then the problem and then\nyou do something and it was just really\nimpactful I don't it was impactful I I\njust don't remember the exact quote I'm\ntrying to paraphrase it I didn't want to\nbutcher it and like just kind of send it\nbut yeah yeah yeah I mean I usually\ndon't know I can't recall what I've said\nmost of the time people will walk up to\nme and will say yeah I really like that\nvideo about that and I'll be like what I\ndon't remember oh yeah it's like the\nthings you do like and then that you're\naddicted to and you see those things as\nlike a solution like when you oh yeah\ngaming to escape or whatever right and\nthat wasn't that Resident that resonated\na lot with me sometimes you say like\nreally short phrases that impact a lot\nand sometimes you'll hear somebody\nramble like me for like an hour and then\nyou've got nothing to take home yeah so\nthat probably means that we've got our\nshorts editors are doing a good job\nlet's go to them not my rambling\num yeah so have you been over the last\ncouple years\noh it's been good I think a lot of\nthings been Rocky I mean everybody knows\nit's not like\nI remember to get I I rarely get like\noverwhelmed by\num a lot of things I didn't want\ndistribution to think of like a full-on\nnegative like like just outpouring of\njust\num trauma dumping if that makes sense\nbut um\nmore um\nkind of like guidance on\nI guess dealing with certain things sure\nand kind of yeah just kind of pro a lot\nof it is like processing I think I think\nI process things super well and very\nfast in certain areas and very slowly in\nother ones and that becomes like it\nbecomes kind of I get new roadblocks all\nthe time\num\nI think I think I think overall\num the only the only problem that I the\nreason why it's getting a problem is\nthat I feel like the Clutter that isn't\npart of my day my dailies is just\nstreaming and doing stuff creatively\nright and a lot of the problems in the\npast have never been really uh\na stop to that and it just feels like uh\nrecently\num I'm just less creative I'm just kind\nof like just trying to stay above water\ntrying to like stay alive and just kind\nof breathing above water does that make\nsense and um I feel like it's not it's\nnot me it's not who I am you know and it\nkind of sucks to like see myself\nuh that way and just gonna\njust kind of almost like look at myself\nin the mirror and being like this is not\nwho I am it's not what I do whatever and\nI don't know why it's it's still\nhappening like that you know it annoys\nme a lot because it's never been like\nthat and I don't want to become\nsomething I don't want to become like\ndoes that make sense yeah yeah so can I\njust um share what I heard you say\nyeah so I I think uh Felix for a long\ntime it's been beautiful to see you\nthrive\nyeah um in this this world of streaming\nwhere I think you're a misfit in many\nother parts of the universe but I think\nI think you're at home in a lot of ways\nI think you've got a lot of really good\nCreative Energy I think the way that you\nthink I think the way that you're you\nreally speak your mind\num I I mean I know you're really good at\nOverWatch and stuff in games but I I\nreally like your your commentary\nsometimes\nand what I'm hearing is that you're\nyou're not so much thriving so much as\nyou are surviving\nyeah and you know it can be hard to live\na life where you're just like surviving\num and and you it almost feels to me\nlike you've lost a piece of yourself\nand I I hope this isn't judgmental but\nfrankly dude like I agree like when I I\nsaw you two or three days ago in person\nand like\nI was worried about you yeah I was\nworried about me\num and and I I hadn't felt that\nyou know I run into a lot of people at\nevents and stuff but like I was just\nreally like I you know and and so I'd\nlove to we can absolutely learn about\nwhy creativity is hard especially for\nstreamers mental clutter because you\nneed a certain amount of like mental\nspace to be be creative\nyeah\num or the other option is that\nif your creativity involves direct\nchanneling of your internal negative\nexperience that works too yeah um so I\nthink that's always been my my main\nChannel\num if not my only I think I'm only\ncreative when it's like kind of like\nalmost like a breakthrough if that makes\nsense if it's like a\num okay it's like a energy transfer\nright we're transferring like anger or\nwhatever into whatever you're doing and\nthen sometimes you feel like you're like\nback against a wall right and instead of\nlike fighting about what's in the front\nI'll just break whatever's I'll break\nthe wall behind me and then it will have\nlike breakthroughs like creatively or\nwhatever\num and um I think\na lot of it is that\nwhen however bad or however the things\nI'm dealing with\nhowever bad it could be\nI process\num it's the bad of it by just having it\nout there like a diary you know\num maybe I shouldn't do that as often\nbut I like to just kind of let people\nlearn about what's going on in my life\nin my life right\nin a way it feels like\num I'm I'm like I'm letting go of it\nthat makes sense yeah uh in recent times\nI haven't been able to do that uh you\nhaven't been able to no I haven't okay\nbecause of various reasons and\nproceedings and whatever\num because I'm sorry what oh just just\nuh just limitations and and Court\nproceedings or whatever I just can't\nokay a lot a lot of things I I'm I hold\nback\nokay um and it makes like a um like a\nblock right as I I'm trying to be like\ncreative and just kind of let it out and\nkind of have breakthroughs and sometimes\nI feel like I can't like that energy\ndoesn't come out as naturally as it used\nto\num just because it's it's hard I\nlike I said the word process my problems\nby people knowing stuff so now that I\ncan't\num I didn't know it would be like this\nbut it's it's like I'm fully blocked\nokay and if you like I can't Channel all\nmy stuff and even if I do it won't make\nsense to anybody uh it doesn't make\nsense to me anyway\num and that just leads me in directions\nthat um are just gonna stale and that's\nreally bad I always said like\nif if things are gonna be stale I'm just\nnot gonna do it\nright people always say that I was\nstreaming streaming and money and this\nand that lions and it's a career I was\nlike if I don't if I don't feel like\nit's fulfilling and I'll feel like it's\nit's I just won't do it and I I always\nsaid like if I'm gonna quit one day I'm\njust gonna quit overnight and you're not\ngonna see me again right when it stops\nfeeling like it but that's not how I'm\nfeeling right now it feels like\num I can and I will but it just feels\nlike uh I'm currently blocked okay what\ndo you think it is that is\nwhat makes it hard for you to access\nthat Creative Energy\num\nwhat makes it hard to access that energy\nit feels like I can't like\njust gonna like yell and scream about my\nproblems and just kind of let them out\nand then feel like\nwhatever comes after is like just gonna\nthe the the channeled rage in in a\ndifferent way because that's kind of how\nit's always been you know whatever I'm\ndealing with at the time it didn't\nreally matter because like people\nwouldn't know about it and for them\nmaybe it's a big deal or not whatever's\ngoing whatever I'm going through or\nwhatever\num which is irrelevant because\nafterwards then I cannot like Channel\nall the rage that I have it whatever and\nI do that by being creative and it comes\nout in a product that makes sense to me\nand that I'm proud of and these days I\nfeel like I haven't been able to channel\nthat and not in anything that I think is\nworthwhile okay and that that just kind\nof sucks like I used to be able to look\nback and be like okay yeah like this\nmonth or this quarter or this half a\nyear has been kind of bad but we have\nsome stuff to look to look back at that\nI enjoyed doing I was like oh that was\nreally good that was really good and\nyeah I'm looking back and I'm like\nwhat's behind me there's just not much\num\nand it makes me feel like I'm failing\nmyself and I'm feeling everybody in yada\nyada\nso I'm hearing a couple different things\none is that\neven when you've been through hard times\nyou can look back and find a couple of\nbright points that you can really find\nto be proud of so even yeah so\ntimes where I guess the rage was\nchanneled properly and it was like you\nknow\num and I always say let's just chat\nbasically the way the way I I'll do\nthings creatively\nis that it's kind of like an impossible\nto fail system\nwhere like when things get bad right\nI'll I'll fight it as much as I can and\nit'll get bad and worse and worse and\nworse but it can't get that bad because\nonce it hits rock bottom right that's\nwhen I have a breakthrough all the time\nright it's at that point I feel like I'm\nlike okay this is all so bad let's just\ngo let's just go crazy and then do\nsomething right and I've always been\nable to\nthe cycle out of it and just you know\ndoes that make sense like just I have a\ncreative breakthrough and then do good\nagain and then\num kind of get out of that and I feel\nlike I'm like near rock bottom but I'm\nnot having that kind of breakthrough\nbecause I'm blocked out of doing it okay\nso that makes sense yeah what I'm kind\nof picking up is that you mentioned that\nyou process some things fast and in the\npast\nused to process by\njust sharing like just kind of letting\nit all out into the open yeah and that\nthat\nlet's call it a coping mechanism is\nunavailable to you so now what's going\non is like like\nxqc had figured out a strategy of how to\nprocess quickly you know once it's off\nyour mind then you can kind of focus on\ndoing stuff and even though bad stuff\nhappened you can kind of process it go\nback to a bright point have some kind of\nbreakthrough and what I'm really hearing\nhas changed is that you're kind of not\nallowed to talk about it publicly\nyeah um a lot of things some of it's\nsmall some of it big but it just it just\nannoys me that it\num that I can't even if I'm sure there's\na world where I I even wouldn't setting\nthe option to do it or having just it's\njust the freedom the lack of Freedom\neven though it's just one part nobody\nwants to hear about sometimes nobody I\nguess would care about it right well I\ncare about it\num and it's it's like a really small\nblockades that go into bigger ones okay\nso and yeah yeah go ahead no\nyeah no it's just I just I just feel\nlike I'm I was on like the back foot and\nit's just not like\num\nit's not like getting better and also it\ngives you like an excuse to do bad or do\nworse and I I end up just falling to the\nrabbit hole I'll just um you know I fall\nfor it I go like oh yeah I'm dealing\nwith stuff so like yeah it's it's I\ncan't do as good as I'm dealing with\nsomething you guys don't know about\nright but in fact these are just excuses\nthey really are like uh in a lot of ways\nlike I I could I I fall into just\nexcuses\num and I have like\nI can make myself feel better but it\ndoesn't mean that it is better but just\ngonna like\nnot have something to blame and I don't\nlike that\nyou know\ndoes that make sense or not yeah Felix\nit's I'm hearing a lot of powerlessness\nyeah\nthat's kind of how it is yeah\nlike\nI hear that you're not able to bounce\nback I hear that\nyou know you're kind of beating yourself\nup for not being able to bounce back too\nyeah\nyeah\nI think\nthere are some Cycles\nthat are like usually easy to kind of\nbreak out of and now they're they're\njust a bit harder right and uh Carter\nyeah they're just I mean way harder yeah\nit's like they're like unbreakable if\nthat makes sense yeah it sounds like it\num it I think\nI think a problem is that it was just\ntoo much at once because out of anybody\nout there um I think I I've dealt with\nthings pretty decently well uh over the\nyears like when things get harder\num when I had problems especially like\nOverWatch League days or whatever like I\nwas back against the wall I was like it\nwas a me on my own whatever and I still\nI still did pretty good\nand I'm proud of all these things right\nand I can manage like to be thrown like\na bunch of stuff at the same time right\noh like five six but now it's been like\nlike 25 you know and it's like\nyou know you know when you drink alcohol\npeople say like the body will like uh\nlike um process like one drink in hours\nlike that right or like get it out\num it feels like\nthe tank is like so full right there's\nlike going on slowly and it keeps more\nadded on and then and it's like dude\nlike we'll never get down we'll never\nget to the bottom of this does that make\nsense\num it's just too much at once it was\njust it's like my whole like my whole\nworld was changing in too many ways for\nme to process any of it because it's\neasy when you fight when you have a\nproblem with your system\num to understand like what's failing how\nto replace it how to move on how to\nright when it's like only one problem\nwhen there's multiple components that\nare failing you start wondering\num\nwhat are the failing Parts\num you don't even know which ones are\nthe failing Parts which one of the good\nones\nand I start to blame myself at that\npoint you know I said maybe maybe I'm\nthe problem\num\nand I kind of get sick and those Cycles\nlike it was just too much at once I\nthink that that's the way I'm gonna put\nit yeah\nwell I mean Felix the other thing I'm\nhearing is that and by the way do you\nwant me to call you xqc or Felix Felix\nis good\num\nI'm also hearing that maybe for the\nfirst time in your life you can't count\non yourself\nyeah that sucks yeah I yeah I that's a\ngood way to put it I think I've said\nthat in the past like\num in last like months or weeks I've\nsaid that yeah\nI've said that um\nyeah I admitted that for the first time\nI think to my to my stream last time I\nthink I said that uh\num you know I always put all the chips\nin my favor or on my side because\nwhenever when nobody's there because\noften oftentimes for most people\num nobody will be there for them not\nfamily friends whatever they'll they\nwill be literally\num by themselves and when there's a\nproblem there's something that you uh\nwhen something happens well the only\nperson that stuff is them right and you\nwant yourself to be in your own corner\nand I've admitted that like at times\num Not only was that not in my corner I\nwas against myself right and then like\nnormally I have like self-destructive\ntendencies that help right they're kind\nof they're kind of helpful because I\ncould something good comes out of it\nright like a breakthrough and then I\nfeel like I was just\nliterally against myself at that point\nand I was like I'm not even in my own\ncorner so like what why am I looking\nelsewhere at other people it doesn't\nmatter who helps me at that point like\nI'm I will fail myself regardless and I\nthink getting out of that well I'm doing\nbetter with that but getting out of that\nwas like pretty hard you know\nhow are you doing better with that\num\nstanding up for myself I think\nuh like making a stand and like\num\nany transitioning to be like a better\noverall like adults like doing all the\ntasks that I have to do and just kind of\nbeing just proud to be like at least a\nsomehow functioning adult like I Can Fly\nby myself I can kind of live by myself\num through all the problems and whatever\nand I think my own battles and I don't\nneed any help and uh\nI think it's it's helped to see that I\ncan do it you know\num because for the longest time you know\nlike\num I had somebody to fight my battles\nwith me you know\nand it kind of felt like\nin a way\nwhen I go live\nI had my my own little son or my little\nSpotlight above my head right like\nyou go live and I have my own little son\nand\nchat and everything all the fun then all\nthe creative stuff is cool and all and\nthen when I turn off the Stream\nwell as soon as you go you go offline I\nmean I'm sure you've seen it you feel\nyourself the spotlight is\nit's going out instantly right\nwhich is fine if you have\num somebody or some people around that\ncan kind of like carry that that\nsunlight for you until you go to bed\nwhatever but recently it's been like\num while it goes off\nand it's Darkness you know this is just\nnothing\num and I think at first it was like\nwell that's true and I look at all the\nthings to blame and everybody whatever\nand everything it just it was just me\num\nI I I feel like I have to be\num a little bit like stronger and thick\naccountability for the things that the\nproblems and the things that uh that\nI've done and just kind of like just\njust gonna level up with myself I think\nI've never really had a talk with myself\nuh for a while I had to like I have to\nlevel out again\ndoes that make sense\nand um I think that's been helping you\ncan I think for a second yeah of course\nyou're what's what what would you like\nguidance on Felix\num good question\num\nmaybe like\nfinding or\nfinding ways to find\num what I actually want and kind of like\nwho I am actually I'm it's not like an\nidentity crisis but like\num\nwell I mean kind of\num in the end like what matters because\nin fact in a lot of ways I think a lot\nof things that most people would think\ndo matter for them\num was kind of like taken away from me\nif that makes sense yeah all things some\naccountability here and there for the\nmistakes I've done and things that the\nthings that I that have lost were taken\naway from myself but I think a lot of\nthings that people do care about uh\nthey're like life goals whatever we're\njust gonna stripped and it kind of makes\nyou kind of want to give up a little bit\nlike\non like not one of those things again\nright like building a home building a\nrelationship like that\num and it kind of I thought that was\nkind of a good thing at one point\nit's kind of easier to um\nto just say [ __ ] it\num yeah [ __ ] all that like because it\nwas all at once almost and it was like\nokay well [ __ ] all that then and let's\njust let's go back to just focusing on\nstreaming and just uh doing this but\nyeah so Felix I know this may sound\nweird but I I really don't know much of\nwhat you're talking about so if you're\nassuming that I know so I I don't oh\nyeah yeah I I actually don't look at\ndrama like I know that when there's\ndrama like people will [ __ ] talk\nabout it and react and like you know\npeople will post and and Twitter and all\nthat stuff I actually don't look at any\nof that yeah so I mean even just given\nhow the size of you and your life I mean\nsome of that stuff bled through and I\ndon't want to ask you anything that will\ninterfere with whatever court but I'd\nlove to hear what you can share about\njust big picture like what are we\ntalking about here yeah I think big\npicture overall\nis that um\num one of the earlier problems\num was like I always cared about at\nleast building some some form of like\nstability at one point or like\nfoundation and for me that was like a\nhome you know like and\nI just kind of like like dream of like\nbuilding a home at one point\num\nI was like I just wanna\nI wanna feel at home you know\nand I kind of Chase that for a while\nand then I kind of like I bought this\nhouse and then started finishing it and\nthen people\num look back at that era of that house I\nwas like the Golden Arrow of my stream\nbecause I I felt home\num and I think\nafter a little bit of time that I lived\nthere\num\nI I had to leave it there was too many\nproblems over there it was dangerous for\nme to live there and whatnot\num I left it behind\num and then I tried again and again like\nlike two more times to just um do it\nagain and there's always something that\nwill like take it away from me just\nbecause I think the nature of what we do\nand\num stream whatever I just the actual\nnature of it and what it comes with or\nwhatever uh made it so that I I guess I\ntemporarily can't have that you can have\na house or houses I guess\nhome is different\nthan having a house what's the\ndifference between a house and a home\num\nit's kind of complicated a little bit\nthe way that I could describe a home as\neasy as I can is um\nif I'm not feeling good\nright and I'm as I can close my eyes and\nI'm\nwhere's home and if I I pitcher home I'm\npicture I'm in my home and I feel\ncomfortable now I feel good right and\nthat was like when I was younger that\nwas like my mom's house and then I moved\nout and um then it was my other house\nlike okay that's home or where things\nfeel like\num I'll be taking care of it we'll take\ncare I'll take care of myself over there\nor whatever right but now it just kind\nof feels like\num\num yeah I haven't had that like Echoes\nmy eyes and I see where's the place that\nfeels comfortable and I just don't see\nit\num which sucks\nyeah I'm hearing that you don't feel\nsafe anywhere yeah that there's no place\nthat you can count on to be safe\nyeah\nthe the next time and commitment\nbut it just felt like it was kind of\nlike\npulled them under my feet so I mean so\nmany times like you kind of feel like\nokay well I just well\ndude [ __ ] all that like let's just stop\ntrying it's so much energy and so much\nresources like into doing it that like\nit's not it's not like it happens once\nand then you give up and you're just\nkind of like bitching out of it right\njust it's so often it's like okay let's\nfocus on other things let's try to try\nother shits for just one for a little\nbit\num because it's just clearly not working\num\nand then just like\nI feel overall like friends and\nacquaintances was like just gonna\na lot of fallouts and a lot of\nuh I fail anyway like a lot of like\nbetrayals I don't want to be like out\nhere like swimming like screaming wolf\nor whatever like I'm I'm I'm tough to\ndeal with and I don't like water my\nplants if that makes sense when it comes\nto friendships\num but sometimes I kind of feel like a\nlittle bit like um betrayed for kind of\nno reason\num and then so like friends cannot yeah\nI do have better friends now but um kind\nof like that was out of the way then I\ndon't have that then problems with like\nI had problems with family at one point\nwhich ended up being problems with\num with my relation and it was like\nuh relation family home friends and\neveryone was like get um what's left\nlike what what actually is left what\npeople what do people care about in life\nthat that makes them fulfilled\num there isn't any of those things you\nknow and I have it all at once\nso then\nat one point you don't you I I you just\ngot like lagging Direction\ncan I think for a second yeah\nokay\nso here's kind of what I'm putting\ntogether\nso your xqc\nyou're a pretty resilient guy\nyou're a streamer you you work really\nhard\nyou're not the best you may not be the\nbest friend\nmay not be the easiest person to get\nalong with\nyou make mistakes but you tend to bounce\nback I think your heart is in the right\nplace you try to learn from your\nmistakes you grow you're pretty\nresilient\nthat really like at one point\na lot of pillars that support you\na lot of pillars that allow you to\nprocess fast and bounce back and take\nthat negativity and turn it into\ncreativity\nstarted to fall away\nso the simplest thing is that like I\ncan't imagine from a physiologic\nperspective what this is like but to\nlike be deprived of your home again and\nagain and again\nwhich is something that\nI don't think a lot of people like\nreally appreciate\nand it's not good to compare but I think\nthat sometimes like you know we hear\nabout people who lose their homes\nyeah and then everyone's like wow that\nmust be terrible and how do you deal\nwith that and stuff like that what I'm\nhearing from you is maybe not in the\nsame way but that you've really lost the\nsafety of your home time and time and\ntime again\nand here you are like trying to build a\nlife\nand then like you kind of get punished\nfor wanting right so you try to build\nsomething and then like it kind of gets\ntaken away and then you're like well is\nyou put it you don't want to be a [ __ ]\nabout it right so there's like some\namount of self-blame like I'm not gonna\nlet this knock me down I'm gonna be like\nbetter I'm not gonna be I'm not gonna\nbow out I'm gonna try again it gets\ntaken away again and taken away again\nand taken away again\nand so your life becomes something where\nlike you want something but every time\nyou want it you get punished for it yeah\nit's like the little meme maybe you've\nseen it before it's like a little box\nit's like this little blob in the Box oh\nyeah it's like oh oh I'll get out of it\nand then he's okay well [ __ ] it then\nI'll go back in you're right right so so\nand and that now you're kind of stuck\nbetween like saying okay well [ __ ] it\nlike I'm I'm done wanting\nyeah\nand then it's like okay well like now\nyou know I know there's like some amount\nof metrics and growth and money and\nother kinds of like things that you can\nmove towards but generally speaking I\nthink whether I I mean some people\nreally chase money or whatever but\ngenerally speaking I think most people\nlike money is a means to an end\num or success is a means to an end\nsometimes success the what it provides\nis a sense of confidence identity stuff\nlike that\num but I'm really hearing that like\nseveral things happened at once like\nfamily stuff like relation stuff like\num maybe work related stuff like home\nstuff and everything kind of got taken\naway from you yeah huh\na lot of Crossfire as well sometimes\nkind of like\num one one piece interact with the other\nand then and I lose both or whatever and\nit's like okay well that's cool now\nthere's problems but like now I lose all\nof it so like it kind of sucks and also\nyou said earlier like\nyou have these pillars that are kind of\nlike falling apart or under your feet or\nwhatever and that I would be okay with\nthat but it wasn't even that is that the\npillows that I was standing on\num reverted and start like [ __ ]\nspearing me does it make sense like if\nthere was only neutral I had lost then\nit'd be fine but if they turn against me\nso I think it's a little bit of a deeper\nexperience\num some sort of like well no not some\nsort like actual just Betrayal on a lot\nof ends\num at one point you could kind of start\nthinking uh you're the problem and maybe\nthat's disability to that I'm the\nproblem in a lot of ways\num\nand I can recognize that 100 I'm not the\neasiest\nperson to be friends with I'm not the\neasiest person to work with I'm not the\neasiest family member I'm not the best\nboyfriend but um\nI don't think that these inabilities\nequate to like what was going on\nso I'm hearing\nand once again you know I don't we\ndidn't really talk about what's okay and\nwhat what's not okay to talk about today\nso I'm curious are you\nI don't want you to share anything that\nwill get you in trouble or or anything\nlike that but like I mean you're using\nvery powerful imagery right that this is\nnot just pillars going away this is\npillars turning into Spears is there\nanything that you feel comfortable\nsharing just so that I can understand\nlike what kind of stuff are we talking\nabout\nand if the answer is no that's totally\nfine no no that's good it's good\num\nwell like what do you mean by betrayal\nlike that's a strong word\nyeah it is and I wish I didn't have to I\nI wish it wasn't like that like I'm like\nI said earlier I'm not trying to cry\nwolf whatever but I chose my words very\ncarefully like I I didn't navigate it\nand just kind of lend it on that word\num\nyeah like\nit just felt like sometimes the people\nthat I shared information with the\npeople that I confided with\num\nwhen when when [ __ ] goes down it just it\njust feels to me that like it just\nit's used against me so all my\nweaknesses and all my own abilities are\nnow just ammo they're just ammo for\nother people\nand it makes me feel like I can't share\nanything with anybody I can't like talk\nabout anything with anybody like it's\nit's all just Leverage\nand then\num\nyeah\nit's impossible to trust people yeah oh\nI've had my walls up for a while now\nyeah\na lot of walls and no home\ncrazy\num yeah especially uh sometimes around\nlike money and whatever which I didn't\nexpect was gonna hit me like that\nbecause\nI never cared for money that much like\nit's cool to have it and to get it don't\nget me wrong like I'm I'm as happy as\nanybody can be at to in a\nreceive capital\nbut um in a way\nI think I've always like not really\ncared enough to like really\nBend and really kind of be like that and\nat one point I kind of felt like\num I've said this before but\nagain I felt like everybody around me\nstarted\ncaring about it more than I care about\nit myself and it makes me want to like\nwell I'm not trying to act do some some\nJoker scheme here but like it makes me\nwant to kind of burn it all you know\nlike\nif I have something that I care about to\na certain degree or I care about a\nlittle bit I guess\num once you're past like comfort you\nknow it's like the upper layers are kind\nof whatever if you're not because I\ndon't even have time to spend anyway I\nwas stream all day\num when everybody around me starts\ntalking about it like so much right then\nit annoys me and there's me right here\neverybody's next to me and everybody's\nlooking past me whatever I have it's\nlike okay well how do I get the focus\nback on either I'll just burn it then\nlike that's gonna like logical\nconclusion almost right\num sometimes it feels like like I'd have\nnone of the problems I haven't now if it\nwasn't for that\nwhat's it like being looked past I mean\ncan you tell us more about that\num this kind of idea of like I just want\nto be really bad I think it's really bad\nyeah it's for this I think it's very\ndestructive\num it's nothing that I think\nI think\npeople will have I think I generally\nfeel like\nyou will have doubts about it that is it\nactually like that you will actually and\nthen you can you can kind of be a little\nbit paranoid about it right\num and kind of have ideas that okay\nthese guys are these people are after\nmoney whatever\num but I think what's was hard to\nprocess is that once it was kind of\nconfirmed right once you get that\nconfirmation all that that that's\ndifficult because it's like um\nit makes you feel like invisible\nright it makes you feel like\nI am what I have\nand\nfor me I've always been like a lot into\nmy I love what I do and I love like all\nmy interests\nand I'm all about like just doing and\nbuilding what what I am\nand caring a lot about that and having\npeople around me kind of\nkind of switch a little bit into\nseeing me for what I have is like a a\ntough like\num realization\nwhat's tough about it\nmakes me like invalidated it makes you\nfeel like kind of unheard\num\nit kinda\nyeah it makes you feel kind of alone a\nlot of times\num\nespecially as upper as someone who\nwasn't really about it for like forever\nlike\num\nyou know\nthese are difficult things to explain\noverall I'll explain if it was just me\nand you I explain it like in Little to\n80 words but I'll go beyond to get more\ncontext because I know people are\nwatching they'll wonder what I'm talking\nabout\num\num\nwell\ngo ahead yeah let me just so so I I get\nthat you're speaking vaguely and that's\nwell am I speaking in code\nuh I I I think you're so it helps me a\nlot to understand like a detailed\nscenario\nand at the same time I'm like noticing\nthat you're being very very careful so I\ndon't quite know what you're talking\nabout which is okay\nyou don't need to share it\num okay I'm gonna I mean if you want to\nit would be helpful but I'm okay like\nrespecting what I think is that boundary\nand just moving on to other stuff\nbecause I I don't think that I think the\nimpact on you is more important than the\ndetails of what happened\nyeah I think a love is like um\num\nI've said it in the past\num\nand one of the moments I think one of\nthe key moments that really hurt me the\nmost\nI kind of giving that kind of\nrealization\nis that\num whether I was gonna right or wrong or\nwhether I was being kind of paranoid or\nnot\num as in the past like\num I didn't really feel good about like\nhow I was feeling and my health overall\num not for things nobody knows about any\nof his people I don't want people to\nspeculate\num I just didn't feel it right and then\num I was running my will\nwhat uh what my mom and whatever and and\nthen\nthe person I was with\nI was kind of like I was like yeah I\ndon't I don't feel really good and\nwhatever and then if I if I die\nif I check out or like I want people to\nget stuff\num and that person was not on the will\nand then it was like\nat a moment where I'm like really\nvulnerable at my kind of lowest like uh\nit's kind of like a oh wow like\nlike I'm I'm kind of I'm so scared I'm\nrunning a wheel down\num hearing them just say like Okay then\nif that happens then what do I get\num so you're like wow uh [ __ ] that's\ntough\num\nyou know because it makes you feel like\neven if you were to [ __ ]\ncheck out like you're St you would still\nbe what you have you know\num and I think that was like\nreally impactful that's kind of where\nthings kind of fill apart\nthank you for sharing that I think that\nadds a lot of I mean that that helped me\nlike really like holy [ __ ] man\nthat stuff like you're I don't even know\nhow old you are but yeah ain't old\nand here you are you know making your\nwill\nand like\nyou know instead of someone wondering\nlike hey like why why are you doing this\nwhat's wrong like how can I help like\nwhat the [ __ ] man they're like what do I\nget yeah exactly yeah\num and it I I'm not like kind of\nparaphrasing it was that's exactly how\nit was like uh\num like almost like one to one\nand um after that it kind of\num I don't know things kind of start\nchanging a little bit and then\nyeah and then it just kind of it was\nlike more recurring all the time a bunch\nof times and it just and then it's like\nthe I don't know what it's called the\nthe\npsychological thing where like once you\nsee it you see it once you know it\nexists and you see it more often\nconfirmation bias\nyeah\num then it's like then I I kind of see\nit more often in the patterns a little\nbit not that was paranoid I'm not like\ngoing full schizo about it but uh well I\nmean I think it's I think it's\nreasonable\nso I yeah I see this a lot with people\nwho are young and successful and\num\nyou know I I worked with someone who\nstarted a company very young and then\nlike\nsold it at the age of like 26 or\nsomething like that and then they were\nyou know people started treating them\ndifferently\num\nand you mentioned in some place\nsometimes that you do contribute to the\nproblems in what way do you think you\ncontribute to some of the problems that\nyou have\num because I would like let these people\nlike get away with it if that makes\nsense like I kind of like I didn't want\nto believe that that was the world that\nI was going to be living in and then I\nkind of\num kind of let it happen and kind of\nlike let the waves watch over me that\nmakes sense\num I was just kind of like\nthere's no way it's gonna it's kind of\nlike that and I was gonna uh in complete\ndenial\nfor the longest time it took me a while\nto really get that\num sometimes even sometimes you can have\nit as as\nboldly as it can be in front of you\nright and as easy and right there you\nstill won't really believe it or\nsomething you know so if I were to ask\nlet's say some of your friends who\nbetrayed you or whatever do you have a\nsense of what they would say about\nhow you contribute to problems and\nrelationships\nI doubt they would say you're in denial\nfor having too much faith in them no\nyeah no uh I think\num\neven though I care a lot\num I hyper focus on things and a lot of\ntimes I neglect people I don't give them\nthe time of day I don't give them time\nand acknowledgment\nand like I said earlier I don't water my\nplants and that was a big problem with\nmy relationships as well um romantically\nis that I just I was a bad boyfriend I\nwas cold and withdrawn and rarely there\nand when I'm there I'm just gonna like\nmy head is like cooked almost you know\nso I'm like kind of just being there\num especially with friends or whatever\nand that that contributes to problems\n100 because then make people have ideas\nabout what what you think or feel about\nthem\nand they probably think that you're like\nalmost against them or something like\nthat right so in a way I was always kind\nof passively\nnot doing good to anybody\num and I would expect the same type of\nthing in return right\naccepts\num instead when it was more like\nbetrayal then it feels like it's more\nwillingful uh hostility it's more\ndeliberate than just being passively not\nresponding somebody or ghosting them or\nwhatever right I think it's a different\nlevel of intensity\nthat kind of raises the bar and I get it\nso people will snap if they're like\nstarved but I didn't know it'd get that\nbad and I blame myself for a little bit\nof it not all of it I'm not gonna like\nfull fold on it but\num\nyeah so so that that's useful to know so\nI'm I'm kind of hearing that\nand and it's interesting use this word\ncooked I think it's a great\noftentimes when I'm done streaming like\nI just don't have anything left in the\ntank and I have to like go and\nrecuperate you know yeah and so I'm kind\nof around and even to a certain degree\nlike almost like leeching off of the\npeople around me yeah\nyou know because and I just don't have\nanything left like to give and\nparticipate but I don't want to be by\nmyself and I'm getting something from\nthat so it can it can feel very\none-sided\nyeah um\nso let me try to\nStitch some stuff together oh actually\none last question maybe not last but so\nuh Felix a lot of stuff that we're\ntalking about I'm curious like what are\nyou feeling emotionally as we talk about\nthis stuff because like a lot of it's\nlike pretty heavy man\nwhat I don't know I don't it just I I\nthink um the way that I visualize it a\nlot I'm very visual uh so I can see most\nof my thoughts and my Concepts like you\nknow it sounds kind of crazy but some\neven like elaborate thoughts that are\nall words in my head I see as like an\nimage so I kind of the way I can kind of\ndescribe to you is that\num\nit's not it's not that it's\ntoo hard to deal with because I think\nthe way that I see it in myself is that\nyou know like um you have like a ram in\nyour computer right\num like it's saturated\nit's already maxed out there's always so\nmuch in there that's like in my thoughts\nor whatever there's always so it's like\nalready packed right so whatever comes\nabove it or it will just replace or\nit'll but like it I think when there's\nit comes to like a maximum of things you\ncan care about right you have like 16\nproblems and you think about you right\nnow you think about them\num [ __ ] you have to really remind\nyourself of these problems because you\nalmost forget about it there's so many\nof them\num and when these things happen at all\nat the same time\num yeah it's heavy but sometimes I could\njust kind of bury it and just kind of go\nlive and just [ __ ] send it you know\nand then it's like it all becomes gonna\nright and the biggest problem\num\nwell that is that I I'll process them\nkind of passively by just doing stuff\nbut with the just the recent stuff and\nand whatever and whatever I have to do\nwith it\num for the first time in my career if\nyou want to say a career\num\nI\nI have my phone\num upside upside up like whatever with\nthe like there are some things I have to\nkind of be receptive of and if I get\ncommunicated stuff I need to like answer\nlike kind of like now right so I can't\nlike Escape it entirely I can never like\njust say okay I'm closing Discord I'm\ncalling Twitter I'm closing uh my text\nmessages and put it on snooze and just\nI'm gonna go live for like the whole day\nI have to like constantly constantly\njust kind of check up on it and that's\nbeen like the big roadblock is like just\nfeeling like something is gonna happen\nSomething's Gonna say something\nsomebody's gonna do whatever and just\ngonna be in that cycle of like reminder\nthat the problems are there I can't even\nEscape them\nokay\nso one uh one more question\num so you mentioned that sometimes you\nkind of air this stuff out on on stream\nand stuff and it helps you process have\nyou tried airing it out privately\num\nyeah a lot of people know about a lot of\nstuff I go through yeah yeah and it\ndoesn't help\nuh it doesn't it just doesn't like just\nflat out\num\nit doesn't and\nsometimes even the solution\num don't give me any peace like\nsometimes the resolutions of these\nthings like you it's almost like you're\nkind of chasing it down it's like you\nfinally get it it's like okay well that\ndoesn't feel any better\nokay um\nso I'm hearing that that's not helpful\nhave you tried with a professional\num no okay\nso Felix here's what I'm kind of do you\nwant me to ask you more questions do you\nare you enjoying talking about this or\ndo you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh\nyeah for sure yeah you're all good\nmemorable\nI like I like questions I think I think\ntalking about it now\num I kind of reprocess it because that\nmakes sense I can't just hear myself\ntalk right I I these are some things\nthat I haven't thought about in a while\nwrestling it's kind of helpful to just\nhear myself talk about it\num\nyeah yeah questions you can have answers\nif you have one like on the fly but\num yeah we can just kind of go yeah just\nkeep asking questions we'll see what\nhappens\nso I'm is it helpful to you that I'm\nasking questions yeah I think you're\ngetting a better grasp of what's up and\nI think you're smart enough to interrupt\nme and kind of have like a solution when\nyou find one or like something to talk\nabout whenever I think you pick up on\nthose things and that kind of trust the\nprocess so yeah so I I think I'm at kind\nof like a pausing point in the process\nand I'm going to give you a couple of\noptions yeah\nso the first is that like speaking in\nthe vague ways that you are and I'm not\nsaying that as a criticism I know that\nyou've got good reasons for it yeah so\nif we let's like understand something\nabout processing\nso talking\nsaying the words\nthat need to be said is like really\nimportant\nso whether that's going to the grave of\none of your parents who is sexually\nabusive and like yelling at them and\ntelling them that they're [ __ ] and\nyou hate them\nthat's different from vaguely telling\nsomeone that like\nyou know my parents did some bad stuff\nand I'm mad at them like like you have\nto speak your truth\nyeah so this is where like I can\ncontinue asking questions and I think\nI'm going to get vague answers but I got\nI felt more\ngoodness hearing about this story about\nyour will than like anything else that\nyou've said and by goodness I don't mean\nthat it was good I mean that that feels\nto me like\nprogress in some way\nyeah\nso um that's the second thing is that I\nthink I've got like two types of\nsolutions that we can talk through\none is like a\nokay like how can you as a streamer\nunderstand physiologically\nneuroscientifically psychologically like\nwhat's going on\nsort of like this business about always\nbeing plugged in and like there's like\nsome stuff around that about really\nunderstanding what your life is doing to\nyour person\num stress like you're getting run ragged\nlike you're cooked like you're baked\nyou're finished like getting overcooked\nright and and there's there's stuff\nwhere you can say well I have to respond\nto stuff today and and like begging your\npardon Felix no you don't\nbut I totally understand having worked\nwith like hundreds of content creators\nat this point that everyone feels like\nthey do\nand and maybe I'm wrong but like you\nknow I I worked with some pretty big\npeople and and I I know I know the\nfeeling\nbut yeah there's some amount of like\nwrestling with yourself and the second\nthe second thing and this is kind of\nwhere my heart is is like this big\nquestion of like what do you want and\nwho are you and how do you live life\nlike what do you what do you look for\nwhen when the things that when your\nsupport start falling apart or betraying\nyou or whatever like how do you as like\na human being in this world figure out\nwhat your compass is because what I'm\nhearing is that there's confusion\nthere's walls that you've built up to\nprotect yourself that make you isolated\nthere's one person that you've always\nbeen able to count down count on which\nis to a certain degree abandoned you\nwhich is you\nand then like where do you go from here\nright and like those are questions where\nwhere you know I've helped some people\nand I think this is like like the\nconversation I'm having with you I don't\nthink is just about you and it's not\nabout the other people that I've helped\nthis is a core problem\na lot of people in life counted on other\npeople\ngot burned by it\nand even in the past when you get burned\nby people that you count on you can\ncount on yourself\nyeah but at some point even this cracks\nand then we don't know what the [ __ ] to\ncount on we don't even know what we're\nsupposed to be doing here you are making\nall this money and what happens the more\nmoney you make the more invisible you\nbecome yeah\nso now it's like well what the [ __ ] am I\nsupposed to do\nyeah\nyou know and I'm hearing that you're\nokay like quitting streaming once you\nfeel fulfilled and you're kind of done\nwith it and you're like okay this is no\nlonger fun for me you're not really in\nit for the money or the fame or the\npower or whatever right maybe some part\nof you is but yeah but I'm not hearing\nthat like\nyou know you're quitting because you're\nfulfilled what I'm hearing is that\nyou're struggling to put your life back\ntogether and it's like\nslipping away from you more and more and\nmore\nyeah well I don't mind kind of like in a\nway like everybody knows about me like\nI'm not gonna hide it\num I thrive in like chaos and kind of\nDestruction and all these bad things\nbecause at one point it's it becomes\nlike an outlet right\num what I do anything right\nand I think it's a very important\nprocess and I just feel like I cannot do\nthat right now and that's the problem is\nthat the destruction and all the things\nthat's all like it's been always part of\nmy formula\ndoes that make sense\num\nyeah I do like self-destruction and like\nself-sabotage or whatever and it's in\ncertain ways and um most people think of\nthese things as like really bad and kind\nof worrisome and they're like strong\nwords but at the same time they're part\nof my process the part of my formula and\nit works for me and I like it and yeah\nthere's like I'll always say oh yeah\nthere was drama but\nif if I didn't if I didn't like it I\nwouldn't be in it a lot of times like I\nstay closer to the fire right I just\njust this time I just felt like\num I kind of failed the fire right so I\nwas that's kind of going like this for\nlike years and then I just kind of felt\nlike writing a fire and it's like [ __ ] I\nlike the destruction I don't like the\nabsolute and like Annihilation you know\nit's like it's like like a tear above it\nand I didn't think it would go like that\nI didn't I didn't think so so I okay so\ntell me tell me this so okay with\nquestions or you want answers what do\nyou want what questions is good okay so\nhow do you thrive in chaos if he looks\num\nthis is an analogy that I use sometimes\num it's the it's the scratched phone\nanalogy\nyou get a new phone right and um you're\nreally careful not to scratch it right\noh my God I can't scratch it\num and then\nonce you scratch it you get really mad\nat it right so you could apply this\ntechnology to anything like your room or\nyour head or whatever and then once I\nget one scratch on it\nthen it's all out I don't care anymore\nand it's like I'll get a thousand\nscratches on it right because it's\ndamaged\nand\nI cannot be uh I'm not a very good adult\nenough to maintain intact or\nJ like overall intact things right and\nit feels like it's easier to thrive and\nit's all just all out like if I'm gonna\nhave a little bit of trash on the\nUnderground as well have the whole room\nfull of it if I if it's gonna be a\nlittle bit broken it's gonna be\ncompletely busted you know and that's\nkind of like it became kind of my world\nof my environment and anytime I rented\nlike a nice house or something nice or\nsomething or I guess something cool\nwhatever I hate it because it's not my\nworld I thrive in I like to\num yeah like way back when I used to\nstreaming like a garage and a basement\nand it's like full of trash and it's\nlike [ __ ] this is kind of hard you know\nit's easy because it's all I don't feel\nlike I have the responsibility to\nmaintain it and whatever and that's just\nalways been my world and\num\nthat's what that's why that's what makes\nme Thrive yeah it's that that's the\nchaos of it\ncan I think for a second yeah of course\nit's beautiful by the way\nthank you\nso if I'm\nunderstanding you Felix\nyeah\nit's liberating to have a cracked phone\noh yeah\noh [ __ ] yeah because then it's like it\nfalls into the water drop it on the\nground it's cracked who the [ __ ] cares\nyeah yeah and it's stuffed anyway and if\nI'm mad at it if I'm somebody's gonna I\njust I could chuck it you can check it\nit's scuffed yeah like I did that's got\nhow it feels you know yeah it feels good\nyeah yeah go ahead it's Freedom it's it\nis it's the feeling that like it's so\nbroken it might get a little bit more\nbroken but it's not the difference\nbetween being intact and a little bit\nscratched it's like it's it's a level of\nlike of bad that is controlled it'll get\nbad to a little bit worse\num and that's gonna\nthat's like so\nyeah it is liberating it it makes you\nfeel like I can do whatever\num\nFelix are you perfectionistic\nthat's tough\num\nthat term is I would struggle with it\nbecause\nI wanted to be perfect in my way\nnot perfect perfect so what I think the\nonly thing it has to be done my way and\nit has been a blockade in a lot of\nprojects I've been doing with other\npeople is that if I can't execute it my\nway I will never be able to do it for\nyou or for anybody else like it's gonna\nbe really bad and a lot of spawns that\nI've had or collabs or whatever it's\nlike it's a come it's just complete\ntrash it's like I don't know what we're\ndoing because it's not me doing it okay\nI'm not the yeah I'm not like the\nconductor okay that that's helpful to\nknow\nand then let me ask you\nhow good are you at keeping things\nintact\noh I'm terrible at it\nyeah I'm absolutely horrible at it\nyeah go ahead no no you're good no you\ngot it oh I never I just I'm terrible at\nit I'm I'm skill zero when did you when\ndid you learn that you can't keep things\nintact\num\nI'm just growing up and being messy like\njust always be like ADHD Andy and like\num doesn't matter I can have my entire\nheads I'll focus on like not dropping\nthis one plate and I'll I will turn and\nI'll hit on the wall right and at one\npoint I kind of gave up in that part of\nme that like\ntries\nto do that tries to\num\nit was like a complete give up like it's\nnot like a little bit it's like now it's\nokay well not only do I know it's gonna\nit's gonna be broken I'm gonna prepare\nfor Edward and I might just break it\nahead of time just to make sure that\nit's broken ahead of time and I'm not\ngonna be surprised by it right and\nin a lot of ways I I did that\num\nyeah\num and yeah I I because because here's\nwhat I'm I was just kind of thinking\nthere for a second and thinking about\nwhat kind of person feels Liberation\nfrom cracking their phone\nthe kind of person who's really really\nstressed about not cracking it\nwhat kind of person gets really really\nreally stressed for cracking their phone\nthe person who tries really really hard\nto not crack their phone and [ __ ]\ncracks it anyway\nUncle yeah\nright so what I'm hearing is that like\nsuccess or Perfection is something\nyou've strived for and failed and\nexactly what you said I mean it was it\nwas kind of like what I was sort of\nthinking about and even to the point\nwhere like I'm so afraid of crack\ndropping this I'm just gonna break it\nmyself yeah\nwith and with people too sometimes\nsometimes you meet somebody that you\nlike or care about and it feels like I'm\ngonna [ __ ] up at one point or very soon\nand it makes me want to kind of give up\non them already so that they're not\ndisappointed down the line or I'm not\nsurprised I just threw them away\nright\nhow does it feel to say that\nfeels okay I've been saying to myself\nfor like years like it's I think it's\nsomething I do uh like all the time like\nthrow people away\num\nI know I won't be able to like water\nthat plant or maintain it or like I'm\nnot good enough or whatever like\nimposter syndrome a little bit sometimes\nand it's like\nespecially I think especially with girls\nalso when like\nsomething you feel like for some reason\nyou feel like you're not good enough of\nthem right and you know you're gonna\n[ __ ] up somehow or some some reason down\nthe line and you don't know when or what\nand you're just like ah you know what\n[ __ ] it I'm just gonna ghost them and\njust throw them away and it's like now I\nknow it's done\nI'm not gonna get sad or annoyed by it\nwhen it happens or why or um the\nscenario of it if I throw them away now\num and I prevent myself from having\nsomething good then I can't break it\nwho are you protecting by doing that\nI think I try to protect myself from\ndisappointment\nwhat what\ndisappointment in what or who who are\nyou what kind of disappointment are you\nprotecting yourself from\num like my future stuff that makes sense\nlike I think I would rather like be kind\nof upset I miss out on opportunity or I\nthrow somebody away right then then\nactually fail at one point and be like\noh man I failed them and I failed myself\nand it's like kind of harsh like it's\nsometimes it gets and it gets\ndestructive a lot and it's like oh I can\navoid that because\num I'm not good enough so [ __ ] it um I'm\nI'm just gonna go way ahead of the curve\nand just just ghost them out yeah I\nthink I did that a lot like a lot lot to\nthe point where like I had nothing to\nmaintain like I just threw it all the\nway but\nI'm not saying it's a good thing it's a\ngood process I'm just saying like that's\nkind of how I proceeded with things\nright I mean I I think it's an important\nrealization to recognize that you would\nrather sabotage things yourself than\ndisappoint yourself or other people oh\nyeah I I don't even I'm not hearing this\nfrom you but I think it's probably true\nI feel pretty confident that you're also\ntrying to protect the other person\nyeah all 100 yeah for sure but I'm not\ngonna be a purist and be like oh yeah\nI'm doing because I'm so nice to them or\nwhatever uh it's partly uh because I\nknow they'll be disappointed and I know\nhow they're gonna feel because you've\nseen it a lot\nif you've seen them be disappointed\noften you know what's gonna happen you\ncan almost predict it right so yes I am\ngonna protect them in a certain way\num\nand often enough you're also doing\nsomething weird which is that\nso it's interesting right so I said\nyou're you're trying to protect them too\nand then you said well yeah but I'm not\ngonna like pretend to be a purist and\nlike I'm just doing it for them yeah\nwhat do you mean so I mean I think it's\nkind of interesting because I I don't\neven I I think you're actively pushing\naway like a good part of yourself\nyou can you kind of see what I'm saying\nlike\nI don't know if this makes sense but\nkind of\nso the first thing that\nyou're you're really open to pointing\nout how you're almost selfish but not\nbut like you Retreat away from being\nselfless in some way\nbecause when I ask you like who are you\njust and maybe you just really are more\nfocused about not disappointing yourself\nbut I I think it's kind of weird it is\nuh yeah it's like that yeah it's more\nabout myself it's more about yourself\nyeah unfortunately I don't like saying\nit I mean it's okay how it is it's true\nthough it's more about myself yeah and I\nI do care a bit about them and about\nwhat's it mean to fall out I guess with\nhow they're going to react or whatever\nbut that's not really the core Focus\nit's more like how I'm gonna feel\num if I [ __ ] it up and how are you gonna\nfeel if you [ __ ] it up\num\nuh it'll get dark like it'll be like\num super upset man it's it's it's kind\nof like a it's a little bit like\ncowardly at one point because that's how\nI know that's how you progress right\nthrough failure and then understand what\nhappened and whatever and all that right\nbut at some point I feel like you failed\nso often that it's almost like you're\npredicting it so it's like you're\nputting your own failure and it's like a\nself-fulfilling prophecy or something\num and I know it's a bad pattern but I'm\njust saying that that's what I do\nhow is it cowardly\nbecause that's not how I don't think\nthat's how you improve as a person\nthat's not how you grow and get better\nby predicting you're going to fail and\nlike making sure you fail ahead of time\num otherwise I never I would never even\ntry but sometimes it's about like the\ndream of it sometimes you know you kind\nof wish that you could have something of\nvalue you know and you kind of go for it\nanyway\num what's that hard for you\nalmost that hard which part what makes\nit hard to try for something that's\nvaluable\nso you're kind of saying that like\nyou know the way you're supposed to\nlearn is by giving it giving it your all\nand you know learning from it but it\nsounds like you're not really able to do\nthat very easily so why not why can't\nyou do what you know you need to do\nI don't know why can't you love Felix\num [ __ ] I don't know I think\nI think in a lot of ways like\nI know for a fact that there's gonna be\nstuff that are like I'll have goals or\nI'll hyper focus and I know for a fact\nthat even I could have the best thing I\ncould have right now in front of me and\nI could easily claim it by\nlet's say if I had to put like one hour\naside uh and I could have that for the\nrest of my life it's the best thing in\nthe world I know for a fact that I won't\nI won't do it at one point I will I will\nfail and it's like predictable almost\nright\num and that that's kind of how it's been\nyou know like I know that I'll wanna\num stream more and do this and do that\nand I know that my goals and my thing\nlike the grind will come in the middle\nof it and I will give up on them and\nmyself at that point and it's like\nyou still try for these things\num\nbut I'll do it as in like almost like a\ndream that makes sense I want to be too\ncliche about it like a little bit like a\ndream\num to think about like thinking about\nall the possibilities like okay cool you\ncan't let yourself like drift away with\nthat idea and kind of go for it half ass\nand you're gonna almost start getting it\nright and you're like uh and sometimes I\nalmost get mad that it's working right\nsometimes I I I'll get mad that it's\nit's actively\num working and it's like developing and\nI'm like oh man not gonna wish I didn't\nstart it because now I now I have to I\nhave to [ __ ] throw it away\nand that sucks\nisn't that so weird though yeah I feel\nlike I'm like like I'm like I'm demonic\nor something I don't know yeah I mean I\nI I I hope this is okay I say this with\nlove that's [ __ ] up\nyeah it's pretty bad\nI mean\nwhat do you think\nyeah I think it's [ __ ] up too\nI think I think it's okay to\nthe only thing that the only thing that\nI'll I'll be okay with is saying that\num like\nit's okay to want things right but\nsometimes I can't come to terms with\nlike what that comes with in the\ncommitment and uh what\nthe whole package of it right and all I\nthink is like the\nI don't know the the best part of it or\nwhatever and I'll be like I'll fall into\nthe dream and then like oh man how are\nyou so sure you're gonna screw it up\num like I said earlier I'm so messy I uh\nI'm so [ __ ] uh it's like\nit's like\nthe more I focus on not [ __ ] up\nincrease as much as a [ __ ] number\nlike I should earlier with the phone\nthing\num and it becomes like\nit becomes where you have this kind of\nbelief that you're not allowed to have\ngood things that's kind of how it was\nfor me\num and I would lock myself out of having\ngood things because I know I can have\nthem I'm gonna I'm gonna [ __ ] it up\num so I'm gonna do other things instead\nbut here and there I'll fall to the I'll\nFollow The Rabbit Hole of like\nstill kind of wanting it or part of it I\nsaid earlier like I'll I'll be like oh\nthis is working [ __ ] I wish you know\nlike\nit just kind of works like with some way\nback when like I'd like talk to a girl\nor something\nand I'm talking because I'm like you\nknow it'd be cool if she replied right\nand and oh my God and what if what if\nshe was my girlfriend that would be so\nnice and then she's so hot and like oh\nmy God she's kind of high to my league\nit's kind of crazy and then she replies\nand then at one point like it's what I\nwant right man like I really wanted to\nreply and she does and I'm like oh my\nGod\nI'm like oh God I'm not I gotta throw it\naway and it Banks you throw it away\nthat's so dumb\nyeah but I mean I I think so so Felix\nand there's a part of us that is dumb\nthere's\nI don't know how to say this the\nstupider it is the more correct it is in\na weird way so like for you to learn\nthat and believe that you had to learn\nthat lesson really really hard\nlike you had to learn it in a big way\nso when did you this idea that you're\nnot allowed to have good stuff\nwhere did you learn that\n[ __ ] that's tough yeah I don't know\num\nthat is really tough I I'm I don't want\nto be like\nnon-responsive but I don't it's not I\nwant to dodge or question it I know I\njust I just feel like it's a lot of\num\nSmall Things big things and it just kind\nof as you grow up you cut yes this it\nbecomes like a core belief yeah right\nand so it's not like a big event or a\nbig whatever right\num so is there something insignificant\nthat comes to mind from a long time ago\num\nyeah\num I mean there's a there's a billion\nsource of like stuff that I've [ __ ] up\nat like yeah um my brothers we used to\nplay uh Diablo and we had like uh we had\nthe whole point of Diablos to have good\nitems and then\none time he kind of like let me use his\naccount so I could like do duels or\nwhatever\nand I was like oh my God I kind of I\nfeel like I had that I had this now you\nknow it's not mine I could kind of use\nit a little bit\num and some guys like Yo dude I'll do\nI'll dupe your items like I'll double it\nyou know\nand I'm like oh Nick is gonna love this\nI'm about to clutch up and I give him\nall my items and he just disconnects you\nknow\nand then and then he comes home from\nschool and he's like yo dude what\nhappened we got hacked I'm like oh my\nGod we got hacked no I knew that and I\nnever told them\nyeah I'm proceeding to this day he\ndoesn't know about it his his best\ncharacter was just naked because of what\nI did\num and just smells like that makes you\nfeel like it doesn't matter like how\neasy I get it how hard I work for\nsomething they don't have I will throw\nit away one or another\num unintentionally\nand that belief becomes so strong that\nlike okay I will do it intentionally now\num because I always say\num\nyes sometimes I'll build a tower right\nlike a success in one way or another\nI'll build something\num it feels really good that when the\ntower Falls as soon as I broke it nobody\nelse and when that power is taking away\nfrom me I become like a demon\num because nobody breaks my tower I\nbreak my own and it'll break but it\ncomes from my hand\nand when that power is stripped away\nfrom me it makes me like that's when\nthings get really bad\nyou know really bad in what way\num\nlike it gets bad I get I get like just\nin these mental Cycles like\num of powerlessness right because I want\nto be I have the option it's not that I\nwant to destroy everything I've built\nright I want to have the option of it\ndoes that make sense I want to have the\nbutton that says [ __ ] this [ __ ] I'm out\nright and break it down so\nthat's gonna happen with like people and\nmoney\nit's a half out\nwe're like\num so you know I don't know if you had\nthis experience but\nwhen you're growing up and kids make fun\nof you\none of the things that kids will start\nto do is if you're if people are\nbullying you and making fun of you one\nof the things that you learned as a kid\nis\nyou're going to make fun of yourself\nyeah\nand then you start beating yourself up\nand why is that it's because you've got\ntwo choices\nyou can\npeople can make you can feel like crap\nand it'd be out of your control or you\ncan feel like [ __ ] and it can be in your\ncontrol yeah and we'll pick one over the\nother all day long\nyes I think the problem is that once you\nstart beating yourself up for that\ncontrol\nas you start to grow older and you\ninternalize it\nthe bullies on the playground will\ndisappear at some point\nbut you [ __ ] carry yourself\nyeah I'm I'm the visuals I see what\nyou're saying right and now I see like\nthis get in the playground and all the\nother kids like vanish out of thin air\nright and the guy's still she's still\nhitting himself right instead of looking\ninto himself you know everybody's gone\nat that point and it's getting older now\nhe's still doing it and people haven't\nbeen there for years right that's kind\nof how I see it yeah\ndoes that\nyeah that's me that is me yeah\nyeah\num especially um growing up like\nstruggling with like confidence and\nwhatever right\num\nthat's kind of how it felt a lot is that\num I feel like I don't know like I\ndidn't dress properly I was I was ugly I\nwas kind of stupid I I don't know I was\nshort or\num yeah I grew up um I was one year in\nadvance in school so everybody was like\nwhenever it was 18 I was 17 right\num so like yeah I mean sometimes I I\nthink that kind of like made fun of it\nwhich is fine\num that was a big problem because I was\nlike a class clown that's kind of how I\nmade up for it so I made everybody laugh\nand it was all good\num but yeah but when you become the\nclass clown you also become a little bit\ninvisible\noh yeah oh wow that's why I'm actually\nsurprised you're gonna well I mean\nyou're knowledgeable so yeah you know\nthat\num yeah why'd you say that I'm just\ngonna I want to hear your take on it\nwell because then they're not seeing you\nright they're seeing you perform\nyou're seeing a version of you\nyeah okay that's not really Who You Are\nlike everyone's gonna pay attention to\nyou as long as you're making them laugh\nbut if you say hey I'm hurting today\nwhat are they gonna do\nyeah\nokay yeah I came to the same conclusion\nbut in different different words\num\nwhen I tell people about this I feel\nlike I was a Class Clown and everybody\nliked me right nobody loved me I was\nfriends with everybody but had no\nfriends right\nand then if I said hello to somebody\nanybody out of like the hundreds of\npeople in my in my level\num they'll say hello back and it it'd\nchill out and just like but I wouldn't\nget invited to parties I wouldn't go\nanybody I wouldn't go back to anybody\nafter school\num\nand then\nthat kind of like\nI never understood why that was the case\nand I think I'm starting to get it now\nexactly for you today\num\nyeah I think it might be and why is that\num\nI don't know I guess I I guess I\nperformed so much that I just I guess\nI'm like a national performer I guess\nthat it's always on you know\nI think that's a part of it\nbut I think there's something else going\non\nwhich is that the moment that someone\ndoesn't treat you that way\nyou sabotage the relationship\nokay yeah well that's that's insightful\nright so now it's kind of tricky because\nhere you are here's a part of your mind\nthat's saying this always happens\nand the Very people that will be able to\ndisprove it you [ __ ] kick them to the\ncurb okay yeah absolutely 100\nand so then that part of your mind is\ngoing to be see it always happens\nokay oh my God every time I step outside\nI get wet my luck is so bad\noh [ __ ] it's raining let me run outside\noh no rain today I'm gonna stay inside\nokay yeah every time I go outside I get\nwet\nI guess um I guess the reason why it\nyeah that's that's how it is and I guess\none of the\none reason why it got so bad I guess um\nis that not only does this make sense\nbut\nthe one time where it kind of does\nhappen the one time where you know it's\nnot raining and then it starts raining\nyou're like at that point it doesn't\neven matter what I do it's gonna happen\nregardless yeah right and I think that\nhappened originally where like you know\num\nI think\nthat kind of development initial way I'm\nnot gonna speak in code but like with my\npersonal relationship\num I think\ncoincidentally or not I was like it\nalways it always it always rains right\nand I go in the rain all the time but in\nthat one time I think it just started\nraining I was like okay\nI'm not gonna sabotage at this time I'm\ngonna go outside and hey look guys uh\nit's not raining outside so I'm not\ngonna get wet and it just starts and\nit's like I [ __ ] knew it and then\neverything starts like and I think\nthings are like massive like I don't\nknow that becomes a strong idea to break\naway from I think because now it's like\nsuper built you know yeah no that's like\nproven in every way yep yeah I think one\nof the worst things that can happen for\nyou is that if you believe something\nabout life and life teaches you that\nyou're right\nhardest thing to kick\nyeah and at the same time Felix I I do\nthink that there are little things that\nso I'm not\nI'm not hopeless for you\nI I think you've got a lot of stuff\nworking for you I think the most\nimportant thing is that you are\nit seems like you're pretty honest with\nyourself\nso I I I what I'm getting the sense of\nis not that you deny things but that\nonce you come to a conclusion kind of\nlike you were saying with the\nsponsorships like you're gonna do it\nyour way and you're also going to think\nyour way and you're going to live life\nyour way\nand so the the problem here is one of\nrigidity\nthe problem is that you're a smart guy\nwho has learned somewhere along the way\nthat the rest what the the way that the\nother people live their lives doesn't\napply to you\nyou get that you can probably learned\nthat really early on oh you're 100 yeah\nright a good best example is love\nweekend I love love weekend I mean uh\nbut she does things in a way I could\nnever do it and know that the way he\nprocessed things and how he sees Khan\nand how he does it right animals make\nfun of him sometimes\num because it's so foreign to me right\nit does it's exactly the opposite of how\nI do things right so that's that's gonna\num yeah it's a an example jumped at me\nyeah yeah so I I think I think the\nchallenges that you learned early on\nlike you know so even when it comes to\nmaking friends right so like early on\nyou're a year younger I was too by the\nway and so it's hard being a you were\ntalking about 17 18. I'm talking about\nfive and six\nright when you go to like physical\neducation or gym class or whatever and\nyou're like a five-year-old competing\nagainst six-year-olds you're gonna get\ncrushed oh yeah some of them were even\nseven\nand then like they hit puberty and like\nyou don't\nyeah that was a squeaker what does that\nmean a squeaker man is the voice is\nsqueaking it's like uh\nright you know yeah yeah\nand so then you you learn to take\ncontrol by making fun of yourself by\nmaking fun of other kids right if you\ncan make them laugh like you start to\nbecome invisible\nyeah you start to lose a little bit of\nfaith in yourself but also you get this\nlike really strong kind of faith in\nyourself there's this core of iron at\nthe bottom\nyou learn to believe in yourself and\ntrust in yourself and you learn that\nlike you can't count on anyone else\nand what everyone else tells you will\nwork in life doesn't work\nyeah so you become fiercely independent\nit's the only way for you to survive\nokay yeah I also\num kind of built a strong sense of like\num my strong confidence and my ability\nto perform because if you have to\nperform or survive then you're always\ndoing it at one point becomes like sick\nin nature you know uh because like\nalways like running in the background\nuh\nuh which is good and bad right because\nthen you're always invisible so I yeah\nright yeah and then when someone when\nsomeone sees you oh hey this girl dm'd\nme I told her that life was hard\nand she didn't know who I am\nand she offered to split the bill she\ndoesn't know how much money I wake holy\n[ __ ] she's not with me for my money\nyeah time to [ __ ] block her yeah oh\nyeah true okay yeah that makes sense\nyeah it's um it's a bad pattern for sure\num\nI think I've understood a part of that I\nthink in recent times very recent times\num I think I've had\na small amount but very significant uh\nexperiences where\nit didn't rain\nright\num\nand didn't get wits and I was like wow\nwhat is that like and then on right with\nthose people right\num and I'll be like\nwhy aren't you like why aren't you\nwatering like why isn't it raining yet\nright and they don't know when they say\nI'm crazy or something right but I'm\nlike\nI I it's kind of weird I'll tell them\nlike\nman you're kind of interesting you're\ntalking to me like a human it's kind of\nweird right\num I'm trying to get past this point\nwhere like I don't have to notice on the\nFly and kind of make them make them uh\nhear about it\num but I've had a good amount recently\nthat's like [ __ ]\num yeah it doesn't rain and um it felt\nreally good that's why I'm saying I'm on\nthe I was direction is up\nis that even though it's only two or\nthree well instances\num like\nit's really refreshing\nand I think I took a look at the offer\nlike the first time in a long time\nand um I kind of had that and I was like\nmaybe there's gonna there's like hope\nthere sometimes I only think it all\ntakes is just one instance of the\nopposite to have like some sort of track\nrecord that can get better\nyeah\nlook at you being hopeful\nit's good I like it no it's good I don't\nlike to be\nself like self-loathing oh guys I I get\nup on everything right\num I did that with a couple things\nbut when there's a good thing that comes\nthat comes up I'll catch it you know I\nstill have my hands like this right I'm\nwaiting for the ball right and it hasn't\nbeen balled a long time but now there's\none I'll catch it is it is it okay for\nyou to\nbe pitied\num\nno\nI don't want to be pity even\num what about people having compassion\nfor you\nPerhaps Perhaps\nall my problems are self-inflicted all\nof them there's not one that isn't like\nI said earlier like if you play with\nfire you you will get burned and you\nmight fall in it well like I can't fall\nin the fire and say like\nwhere was it I was playing with it the\nwhole time right and a lot of the\nloneliness and the I think Alex what\nsorry is it okay if I interrupt you\nsometimes yeah let's do that it's funny\nI like it\nso if you were to blame for all of your\nproblems\nwho has control over your life\nMatrix I don't know I don't know what\nwas that going\nif you're always to blame who's got the\npower\num you do me yeah me yeah so here's the\nweird thing remember how we talked about\nthe whole like I'm gonna make fun of\nmyself or I'm gonna sabotage this\nrelationship because I don't want to\nlose control of over it you're taking\ncontrol all the time\ncontrol control [ __ ] I don't care\nabout the [ __ ] money you guys want\nthe money I'll [ __ ] burn it\nI'll teach you to look past me [ __ ]\nokay\nyeah oh yeah I've done that\nright yeah\nyeah uh you're right I do have the I do\nhave the power and the the control to do\nthis this is the crazy thing is you you\nthis is the weird thing you don't it's\nthe way that you view the world but I\nhate to break this to you Felix but you\ncan't control anything except for\nyourself like literally\nyou're right it's the way you see the\nworld and I don't blame you for seeing\nthe world that way\nbecause it's a way that lets us\nfix the unfixable\nbecause when I can't control other human\nbeings and they hurt me that means I'm\n[ __ ] how do I how do I win this match\nI can't win the match because someone\nelse has power and I don't it's a scary\nway to go through life\nbut then the problem is that when you\nthink you have all the control\nall kinds of weird [ __ ] starts to happen\nthe first is that you do this weird kind\nof stuff in relationships\nwhere the moment that some person exerts\nIndependence or whatever you're like\nthis is weird\nI don't like it I'm losing control of\nthe relationship\nand somewhere along the way you lost\nfaith in yourself\nwhich is weird because you almost have\nthis paradoxical\nunrelenting faith in yourself\nI could [ __ ] cancel you on every\nsingle platform and you'd be fine with\nit because you'll find some other you'll\n[ __ ] build your own platform you'll\nstart streaming you thrive in the chaos\nit's not the challenges that hold you\nback okay it's the wins\nit's the lucky breaks\nthat's when you're like what the [ __ ]\nit's sunny today where's the rain\nyeah and now you're confused and so what\ndo you do\nmake a weather altering machine go find\nsome Shaman and they do a rain dance and\nyou're like Ah that's right\nyeah create the chaos\nnow I understand\nokay\ncan I tell you a story yeah yeah of\ncourse I like stories I once had a\npatient\nwho had been traumatized\nand was convinced\nthat everyone in their life abandons\nthem\nyeah\nfinds a loving so this is what's weird\nso when you're when you've been in\nabusive relationships you tend to\ngravitate towards abusive relationships\nand everyone else is like what the [ __ ]\nlike why don't you just leave why don't\nyou date someone who's not a toxic\n[ __ ]\nand then the person doesn't understand\nright and it's not their fault so\nbecause here's what happens\nthey they date two people one person is\nlike yeah you you suck and they're like\nokay I know this game I've played this\ngame I know what the rules are I can\nsurvive it\nand then someone else comes along and\nthey're like you're awesome and now they\nget confused they're like what do you\nmean I'm awesome\nbecause people have told them that\nbefore and they start out being awesome\nand then they end up being abusive\nand so then what happens it really\nstarts to happen what's really sad about\nthis is at some point they find someone\nwho has faith in them is is a human\nbeing doesn't see them as invisible\ndoesn't just date them for their body or\ntheir money or whatever and then they\nget even more confused because they\ndon't even know what love feels like\nthey don't know what unconditional\nacceptance feels like so then they start\nbeing like what what are you doing\nwhere's the other shoe like what are you\nnot telling me you're gonna leave me\nright you're going to leave me right\nyou're going to leave me right\nyou went out with your friends for a\nweek did you cheat on me I'm sure you\ncheated on me of course you cheated on\nme\nand then the person's like no I'm not\ngoing to leave you I'm not going to\nleave you I'm Not Gonna Leave You\nand the other person's like you're gonna\nleave me you're going to leave me and\nwhat do they end up doing they [ __ ]\ndrive them away like I can't deal with\nthis [ __ ] I'm gone see I knew it yes yes\nI was right all along you were\nbullshitting me and you were really good\nat it you bullshitted me for four years\nyeah that's that's bad enough I I feel\nlike there's even the worst example we\ncould instead of driving them away you\ndrive away like I knew it it went away\nso that's what happens right so so I\ndrive them away for a while and then I\ndecide you know what it hurts too much\nto be loved by someone and have that\nperson abandon me so now what I'm gonna\ndo is anytime there's an instance of\ngenuine love or affection I know where\nthis ends I don't want to put myself\nthrough it because having someone treat\nyou like [ __ ] and then abandon you\nI can manage that someone loving you and\nabandoning you hurts way more yeah it's\nokay true yeah\nso Felix it's the good stuff that hurts\nin life\nyeah\nand like you know I I see this with\nparents because like you don't really\nknow like I didn't really know what fear\nwas until I had kids\nlike fear is like a whole different it's\nlike different it's just different like\nonce you know once you really love\nsomething and you're responsible for\nsomething in this world you know a level\nof fear that's like absolutely\nterrifying\nand I I think what I'm hearing from you\nis that you've been burned so much yeah\nyou're [ __ ] stepping around the fire\nbut you you've gotten you've gotten\nburnt here or there now you're starting\nto develop scar tissue\nyeah and then some some bad [ __ ] happens\nand you know some of it's your fault and\nsome of it isn't and I think that like\nyou you know I\nmean it sounds like for a lot of reasons\nyou can be very hard in relationships\nlike I'm not talking about just romantic\nrelationships you're kind of saying you\nknow you gotta water your plants and\nyeah just all of them yeah\nI I I don't know I mean so I I feel\nreally confident because\nI think that you do control a lot I\ndon't think you control as much as you\nthink you control I think it's helpful\nfor you to believe that you're\nomnipotent\nuh because I kind of know what that\nmeans but not really all powerful okay\nright like the world is your oyster\nyeah\nand at the same time like I think\nthere's weird stuff it's really hard to\nbe in a relationship with someone who\nbelieves they're omnipotent I'm not\ntalking about like narcissism I mean\nthat like\nwhen everything is under your control\nyou stop holding other people\nresponsible\nyou actually let them do things like\nwalk over you\nthat person who you talked about in with\nthe will\nthat person is signaled to you that they\ncare more about your money a thousand\ndifferent ways before that moment\nbut you let it ride because it's oh like\nif this person is like not treating me\nthe way that I need to be treated it's\nmy fault I need to change the way that I\ninteract with them\nyou know when you get bullied at school\nand you start becoming the class clown\nyou don't blame the bullies you learn\nhow to blame yourself because it's a\nsurvival mechanism if you blame the\nbullies all that's going to happen\nyou're gonna get [ __ ] bullied more\nbut if you put the pressure on yourself\nI need to be funnier I can control this\nif I'm funny enough\nit gives you power\nKorean\nyeah did I say a lot of sense actually\nyeah and what's the solution to that to\nthe getting out of that kind of\nso a couple of things the first is\nso I'm gonna\ngive me a second okay I'm gonna write\nthis out\nyeah\nby the the child thing you're talking\nabout\nI feel like I feel that with um with my\nbrother\nyou know we're not that close these days\nright I can I can be hurt and\num get hurt by a bunch of people and\nhurt myself a bunch of times uh it\ndoesn't really feel scary or anything\nbut whenever um she gets harmed or\nsomething like that then I I I I I go\ninto like a different mode to change\ngears almost you know\nand I think you feel the same way\nabout me kind of like Brotherhood\nokay give me just a second that's useful\nto know thank you for sharing that yeah\nlaughs\ngive me a second sorry\nokay so how do you fix that let's\nunderstand for everybody who's in a\nsituation kind of like this the first\nthing that you've got to do and you're\nspot on so it's interesting there's like\nold yogic texts that describe how you\nkind of said it wasn't one moment it's a\nthousand tiny things\nbut those things are significant so the\nfirst thing that you can do\nis tell those stories\nso this is sometimes the work of\npsychotherapy but there's a lot of\nemotional processing that also happens\nin places like Alcoholics Anonymous like\nwe see this a lot with like addiction\nright where people go and they'll like\nshare their story and stuff like that\nyou can do it with friends like you can\nyou know just you gotta like articulate\nall the times that\nyou knew that\nyou could not be trusted to not break\nsomething\nbecause I want you to really think about\nwhat does that do to someone's life\nwhen they believe that they cannot be\ntrusted to protect something\nlike like everything precious in their\nlife gets sabotaged or discarded and the\nmore precious it is the more you have to\nrun away from it\nbecause you can't trust yourself not to\nbreak it\nso if you tell those stories\nyou it's weird but you will change\nthat'll fix a lot of it\nsecond thing\nis be really intentional in kind of this\nthis rain or shine sort of thing okay so\nlike the problem is that right now\nyou've got a lot of reflexes about the\nway that you respond to your feelings\nand the way that you interpret\nwhat happens in your life\nright so you have like you feel a\ncertain way like oh I feel really happy\nthis is really good and that feeling\nconnects to a reflexive Behavior I gotta\nghost them\nyeah so that needs to be caught in the\nmoment\nand be like okay what am I feeling what\ndo I what do I feel like doing how does\nit feel to do that what you're doing is\nwhen someone starts to like you Felix\nand you like them back\nyou're losing control you can't have\nthat\nright and when you ghost them what are\nyou getting back control absolutely\none is awesome right oh my God she's\nkind of into me but it's [ __ ] scary\nman\nyeah because if you build a tower too\nthin and then when it starts wobbling\nand it'll fall I better just yeah right\nyou're taking control it feels good\nsometimes yes right because you're\nscared\nso being able to conquer that fear when\nyou're ready being able to be hurt again\nwhich I don't blame you like I don't I\ndon't blame you for any of this this is\nnormal you're just you know [ __ ] I'm not\nI'm not ready to be hurt again I'm\n[ __ ] well I'm I'm like sh I'm running\nout I'm just shut down that's fine I'm\nbecoming radicalized okay yes I'm a red\npill I'm Tate and hunched\nokay I mean even all of those things are\nokay right so it\nyou can start with like relationships\nit's like starting with stuff like you\nknow telling Nick that you all didn't\nget hacked\nI never told them he's probably gonna\nwatch this one day and be like oh man\nbecause he's 20 he's uh he's 30 now and\nI haven't told him yet yeah so I you\nknow so so there's all kinds of\nrelationships where you're going to feel\nthese reflexes of pulling away\nso catch him in the moment and that's\nwhere there's like some amount of you\nknow\nalmost techniques that you can use if\nyou really want to but I don't know if\nthat's your jam\nbut like the key thing to remember is\nthat anything you feel in that moment\nthat fear or that loss of control\ndo you understand that feelings are\ntemporary\nyes and so you can deal with that loss\nof control by engaging in a behavior and\nghosting the person\nor you can just do nothing and what will\nhappen to the feeling of loss of control\nI don't know exactly so you need to\nlearn this so this is I swear to God it\nwill disappear it will go away on its\nown\nand that's just because that's how human\nbeings work so I know it's kind of\nconfusing but like\nevery emotion or thought so your mind is\nnever permanent do you get that your\nmind is always changing new thoughts new\nemotions emotions come emotions go they\ncan get triggered by things\nbut all emotions and thoughts in the\nmind are fluctuations and then they\nreturn to Baseline\nif emotions would be permanent and you\nhad the perfect wedding you'd be happy\nfor the rest of your life that's not how\nit works this is the have done a tread\nmelting right right\nso this is the key thing the the reverse\nof the hedonic treadmill is that sure if\nyou keep on chasing stuff you keep on\nchasing chasing chasing to get and\nthat's why you need to chase new stuff\nto get that old High\nbut the reverse of the hedonic treadmill\nis also true\nstabilized dip low stabilizing that type\nof thing yeah so this is kind of like\nthe degenerate gamer solution to life\nwhich is that you don't actually need to\nclimb and all your problems will get\nfixed you just [ __ ] sit your ass down\nand your problems will literally\ndisappear\nthey do disappear yeah so all emotions\nthat you have any amount of hurt that\nyou feel will actually disappear over\ntime it can get re-triggered\nso for you to not engage in those\nself-sabotaging behaviors this is going\nto be scary for you but it's an internal\nbattle that you have to fight so in the\nfew things that you do control\nthe last thing and this is going to be\nhard\nokay is you gotta try surrendering\nso any control yep\noh just like letting the dogs loose and\njust say see where they go yeah you're\nnot ready for this yet I think but if\nyou really want to know what's truly\nliberating because this is this is the\nthing right even if you think about that\nbroken cell phone\nyou know what that I just thought about\nit\nI think I tried what you just did and I\nsince I told you I'm I'm very\nself-destructive overall and it's one of\nmy techniques of moving on and doing\nstuff\num I tried I generally did\num this whole like\nfull left full let go right and see what\nhappens and it's just it's just really\nunlucky it's unfortunate\num I got burned back to back and it's\nreally unlucky though and I recognize\nthat I recognize it it was not like\nforeseeable or anything so so\nsurrendering is is also trickier than\nsometimes we think it is it's not it's\nsort of letting go but like a lot of\nwhat we have to let go it\nI don't know exactly what happened in\nthat situation I'll trust you and that\nit was unlucky but I I think that you\ngot to work on a couple of other things\nand then surrender and this is the\nbeautiful thing if you sort of think\nabout it right when we have that cracked\ncell phone that's the principle of\nsurrender\nhere you are trying to control\neverything oh my God I can't crack it I\ncan't crack it I can't crack it you're\ntrying to control it and it's so\nstressful oh my God and then it gets\ncracked anyway and you [ __ ] you're\ncontrolling everything all the time\nyou'll crack your cell phone but for the\nrest of your life you've got to be in\ncontrol\nand look at what you're doing\nand then you discovered hey if it gets\ncracked I'm free Let It Be cracked again\nif I drop it it's dropped so be it\nthat's surrender you actually figured it\nout and it's liberating\nthat I can use the cell phone I can\nstick it in my pocket I can eat with it\nand one day it could be cracked so be it\nI'm gonna do my best but I can't protect\nthe cell phone forever\nand once you can live to yeah\nit's interesting that I'm like I'm like\nan elite at understanding that system\nand how it works in some areas I can't\napply it with other in other areas\nyeah the one doesn't go to the other it\njust it just I just don't do it right\nand I don't know why that's that's\nbecause your degree of attachment to the\ntwo areas is different\nokay right so how much you care about it\nis different\nyou don't care about a cell phone sure\nyou stress about it a little bit you\ndon't care\nbut when it comes to like falling in\nlove and being seen and no longer being\ninvisible\nright then you care and once you start\nto care things get scary Felix\nyeah I see that\nright you can burn the money because it\nain't about the money\nyeah\nI get it now I I it actually makes a lot\nof sense yeah you kind of kind of\ncould have made that I kind of\nmaterialized it now because I didn't get\nthat\nthe degree of care for these things yeah\nyeah and you've learned an antidote to\nthat too which is you teach yourself how\nto stop caring right you build all these\nwalls which is like a good\ntemporary measure temporary yeah just\njust so it doesn't happen again like too\nsoon and it's like yeah so so there's\nlike a difference between like surviving\ntoday and like living for a happy\ntomorrow and right now I get the sense\nthat you're in survival mode so whatever\nso start to do these things then I think\nyou know if you're diligent with this in\na couple years you'll be living a\ndifferent life\nokay the day-to-day may look the same\nbut the way that you're going to feel in\nhere is going to be different My Hope\nfor you is that you'll have a couple of\nlike meaningful relationships romantic\nor whatever I mean that I don't know but\nyou know where people can see you for\nwho you are\nand then you can also have conversations\nwith them about hey I'm not great at\nlike watering plants and this is\nsomething I'm actively working on like\nas a human being and I really appreciate\nyour patience\nand I'm going to try to do better\nand then there's going to be like small\nparts of that which is on a on a\nday-to-day basis like you're going to\nget all these Discord messages and\nthere's a part of you that knows that\nyou should message your friend but you\ndon't because there's like too much\nimportant [ __ ] to do and then you have\nto deviate something and instead of\ndoing something important you're going\nto message your friend\nand then your friend becomes important\nand then you're watering that plant and\nit'll change like you can change in the\nsense I don't I think you're\nyou've got all the right pieces already\nthey just need to be like moved around a\nlittle bit yeah just a little bit\num\nyeah I think in a lot of ways I think\nsometimes I um\nI kind of like interacted\num\ndeliberately almost\nor at least knowingly with like a fire\nyou'd be like wow I can't believe this\nis hot that is crazy\nand I know it's a fire to begin with\nright and if I just\num and just\nbetter at just choosing a little bit\nbetter and giving maybe more chances\num and\ntaking less like deliberate risks maybe\nyou have one or two results well it goes\na long way sometimes I I realize that\nnow like it doesn't take much for things\nto flip it doesn't the sometimes just\none it's good enough\num I didn't believe it at first though\nuh it's kind of hard to believe it when\nyou're so stuck on one idea you know\nyeah like dissonance\nyeah\nand I think you've shared with us that\nyou're good at looking back and finding\nthe bright points and I think you were\njust in such a dark head space where the\nbright points weren't visible or\ngenuinely weren't there because you kind\nof got\nyou know\nkind of got [ __ ] bro\nyeah\num\nyeah I think I think\nprocessing all these things is sometimes\ndifficult because you always have the\nreminder like oh I mean I could also I I\ncould have also done better I could have\ndone better and it's like\num\nit sucks a little bit in hindsight\nthat you could have done better\nright and things kind of kind of got bad\nregardless\num it I don't know it's just something\nthat annoys me about it right\nbecause\num yeah it sucks yeah there's some weird\nstuff Felix which I I don't think we're\nready for but I I don't think you could\nhave done better\nI know it's weird but I think that one\nof the lessons I've learned in life is\nthat like we there I mean there's even\nthe neuroscience and stuff there's this\npart of our brain that does something\ncalled counter factual thinking\nwhich goes back and replays things in\nthe past in a non-factual way\nso these are the facts of what happened\nand then your mind replays things in a\nhypothetical and that's one way that we\nlearn from our mistakes if we didn't\nhave that capacity\nwe wouldn't be able to like hypothesize\nwhy we lost a particular game right\nyeah I think I'm stuck in that world\nalmost like all the time like all day\nyeah the crazy thing is that even though\nthe Mind does that it is literally\nimpossible to do better than you did\nback then\nyeah\nright because you you only knew what you\ndid you can only do the best that you\ncould have done\nyou're right\nand and so like then the question\nbecomes what do you truly control you\nonly control the present so don't do\ndon't think about how you could have\ndone better because you couldn't have\ndone better but the next time that you\nwant to retreat from a relationship\nthat's your test\nokay\nyeah that's insightful\nother questions\nno that was really good that was really\nthat that makes a lot of sense yeah I\nthink um I think a lot of like the other\ntopics or other things they kind of like\nfall into the same boxes because I think\nthat was like an umbrella solution for\nlike a pattern of behavior and the other\nthing doesn't matter what the specifics\nor the semantics are I think that kind\nof encloses it\nthat's a lot\num\nyeah like just overall kind of like uh\nmoving on from stuff you know sometimes\nkind of but I think that also what we\nsaid kind of helps also having like new\nthings and seeing it differently and\nI think that plays the same role yeah as\nI'm wrong about it no I I think you're\nright so I think that there was a theme\nfor today that I was hearing and I think\nthe theme is actually the way that you\ngo through life that's why it all\nrelates right this is you\nyeah\nand and I'm I have no doubt that if you\nengage in future conversations with\npeople in in a meaningful or intentional\nway you'll discover other things\nbut one thing I I have to tell you\nunfortunately is that the Insight is not\nsufficient\nit's necessary but the next part is like\ndoing the work yeah\nyeah which is what I A lot of times I've\nI've like turned back on right because\nit's easier to say it was it was it was\nover anyway or it was too hard or find a\nfind an excuse you look at where you're\ngonna find one right\nyou got to catch that thought\nyeah so tomorrow\nyeah go ahead oh no I was just gonna say\num in in snowboarding uh there's\nsomething that that we do a lot or maybe\nI may just me I did\num when you go to the like the big big\njumps that are massive\num once you're committed you're\ncommitted right and um a lot of times I\nwas too afraid to take him because\nthey're so they're so big like the big\nbig jumps you know and then I would just\nkind of I would just send it forward\ntowards it right and then at one point I\nalmost forced myself I was like\num I'm going a straight line right and I\nstarted going on on the up ramp right\nI'm like well I can't turn back now\nright but I put myself in that position\nright where I can't turn it back anymore\nbecause sometimes if I have the option\nof turning back I will turn back right\nand whether that process that and I I\nthink I I do better is when I kind of\nlock myself into it and be engaged I\nthink that builds a better pattern of\ndoing better so so this is what's hard\nis is that I'm with you so I think it's\nthe same thing about creating chaos and\nkind of thriving and Chaos because once\nthe\ncat is out of the bag it's time for xqc\nto step into the arena and you can trust\nyourself to come out on top I'm with you\nthe reason this is hard is because\nyou're never committed\nthe reason this is hard is because on a\ndaily basis you have a chance to turn\naround\nand that's why you haven't figured it\nout because thus far you've required\ncommitment\nto see things through you're actually\nnot in control\nyou put yourself in a situation where\nyou lose control oh my God yeah that\nmakes sense actually\nthat's why this is hard for you\nbecause this is the opposite of\nsnowboarding\nyeah there's no critical point\nyeah that's right\nokay that's gonna take away\nyeah\nyeah that that's all good yeah by the\nway um\nI didn't want to come here with like\nthis like\num super like sad boy Vibes I just\ndidn't sleep that much\num\nyeah I'm just I'm just saying I didn't\nwant to seem like I was like just coming\nhere and being all like uh yes\num I got woke up at like seven in the\nmorning so\nbut um yeah I don't want to seem like I\nwas disinterested what you're saying if\nyou've ever felt that today or anything\nI I was very engaged in but yeah yeah I\nI didn't get that vibe from you and I'm\nalso happy to have whoever shows up\ntoday\nif you're tired if you're disengaged\nlike that's okay\nbut\nthem yeah I think um\nI thought there was gonna be some like\nVoodoo solution to a lot of the a lot of\nthese things and processes or whatever\nthey're gonna come up with in some like\nthere's this Indian book in 1994 and\nthey said to do this and that right and\nI thought they were gonna pull some [ __ ]\nlike that\num but it was actually quite simple and\nsometimes that's kind of the best\nSolutions or the simple ones\nyeah yeah\ngood well well I hope I wasn't too short\ntoday or whatever it was no man this is\nperfect\noh yeah well I'll um\nI um I think we should do a check-in\nsooner see what happens okay sure you\nwanna do a check in soon or not yeah I\nmean I I don't know exactly what you're\nasking but I mean a chicken and a couple\nmaybe weeks or a couple months whatever\num if I achieve any sort of progress in\nthose directions I'll give you a heads\nup or okay sure or deep or default or or\nit got bad sure it got way worse right\nand it rains inside as well like\nyou pulled a wall down and the roof fell\nover and now it's raining on the inside\nof your house yeah I hear you exactly\nyeah yeah I don't know I'm not there at\nall though like I'm not\nI'm like I'm not like the giving up type\nbut sometimes like all kinda look at\nthat like play it off like I'm giving up\nI mean sometimes I like the attention\nbut it's not like that like yeah um yeah\nso so well let's let's sort out\nfollow-ups later but I think for now you\nknow thanks for coming on and and\nhopefully you know this was helpful to\nyou and I think by the way a lot of what\nyou're struggling with I think is very\ncommon I mean that's that's why we have\nthe I have the Insight that I do because\nI've lived half of it myself I was a\nyear younger I was the class clown you\nknow\nlearned how to be self-reliant and then\nlike had to go to India to learn how to\nsurrender and it's like hard to learn\nit's it runs against I mean you've built\nyour whole life to avoid surrender yeah\nso yeah and that's you know it's okay\nyeah good luck to you my friend thank\nyou uh for everything uh that's okay um\nyeah I'll touch up again um if that's\neverything I will uh I'll talk to you\nsoon okay take care everything was good\nwell by the way what was uh did you have\na good time at uh Streamys and whatever\nor what\nyes and no I I don't think it's my\nit's not like either yeah I I think it\nwas uh\nso I was very happy to be nominated\nobviously I think it was like it's like\na bucket list kind of thing that I went\nto like an la Fancy thing\njust have your name someone out there\nthat has an on your own stream sometimes\nyeah I mean that's good I I feel honored\nbut but I also think it's cool to like I\nwent to like an la Fancy party okay you\nknow that's the first time in my life\nthat I've done that okay I thought that\nwas really cool\num but but I I really didn't\nI'm not going to go too much into it but\nI I think it's a world that I'm not\nI'm not familiar with it either I think\nit's a little I think it's a little like\nit's a lot of fun since a lot of uh it's\na lot of fluff that personally I don't\nenjoy right I go for the After parties\nokay I go to get [ __ ] up that's that's\nhow it is it's uh otherwise I wouldn't\ngo but\num yeah I enjoy seeing you there though\nit was fun yeah likewise\ntake care man take care bye bye\nforeign"
