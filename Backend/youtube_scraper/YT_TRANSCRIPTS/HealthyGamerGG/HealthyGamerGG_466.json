    "transcript": "I'm also not entirely sure like I think\nit's healthy to share but I'm not sure\nthat men like need to share right to be\nblind so I kind of hear this from my\nwife where where you know I'll catch up\nwith a friend of mine you know like that\nI haven't seen in four or five years and\nshe's like did you talk about their\ndivorce and I'm like no we didn't talk\nabout the divorce she's like but you\nhaven't seen him in so long and like he\ngot divorced like how could you and\nthey're like no like we talked about\nvideo games because that's what we did\nthat resonates with me so like we don't\nwe don't need to talk like I know he's\ndivorced he knows he's divorced you know\nand then like the way that we connect\nand heal in the way that we bond is by\nlike going back to a time that's happier\nand like I'm done and now being a\npsychiatrist I can analyze it and can\nsay like yeah I'm like showing him that\nI still accept him that nothing has\nchanged and I don't think any less of\nhim yeah I still think he's a good human\nbeing that I value him the same that I'm\ngonna be there for him in the way that I\nwas 15 years ago and this is the way\nthat we do it right right and it makes a\nlot of sense"
