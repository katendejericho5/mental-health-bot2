    "transcript": "when we're growing up we're not taught\nwhere happiness or satisfaction comes\nfrom and so what we sort of learn\ninstinctively as kids is that\nsatisfaction or happiness comes from\nAchievement because this is when we get\npositive reinforcement right so if I get\nan A in on a class my parents are like\ngood job little boy and so then we learn\nthis really really important lesson\nearly on which is outward success leads\nto personal satisfaction and personal\nhappiness it definitely leads to esteem\nand respect from others and then we\nconfuse that stuff with our own personal\nsatisfaction and then what happens is we\nstart to get stuck because what that\nmeans is how I feel about myself depends\non my performance and so if I do well at\nwork I feel good and if I do if I don't\ndo well at work or I don't get promoted\nthen I feel bad and now this is the\nmoment at which you surrender the\nhappiness of your life as well as\nDirection in your life because whether\nyou get promoted at work is not under\nyour control"
