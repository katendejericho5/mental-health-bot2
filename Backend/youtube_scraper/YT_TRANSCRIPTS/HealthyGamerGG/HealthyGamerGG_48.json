    "transcript": "anytime you're moving towards degeneracy\nplay the tape through to the end anytime\nwe make a bad decision let's say I\ndecide I'm going to play video games\ntoday what I need to do is play that\ntape through to the end these are\ncognitive things that we don't do if I\nplay video games today how am I going to\nfeel an hour from now how am I going to\nfeel tonight and what I'm going to feel\ntomorrow see if you really pay attention\nanytime you procrastinate you're trying\nvery hard not to think you're trying to\navoid thinking your mind tries to forget\nand so you forget very intentionally and\nthen you wake up the next day and then\nlife reminds you and then you suffer and\nthen you beat yourself up from yesterday\nbut you knew this was going to happen if\nI asked you if you play video games\ntoday how are you going to feel tomorrow\nyou're going to say I'm going to feel\nlike you know that I know that your\nmind intentionally tries to escape so\nthe challenge that we have is we don't\nknow how our mind works and we're not\ndealing with it in the right way"
