    "transcript": "hello my friend hi how you doing I'm\ndoing well how are you I'm doing good\nI'm doing good thank you so much for\nthis opportunity by the way uh yeah very\nexcited a little bit nervous I'm not\ngonna lie but yeah it's just uh yeah\nready to get into it basically yeah\nlet's do it dude and so tell me what do\nyou go by\nuh so uh my username is gig up but you\ncan call me Gantt which is my real name\nganter grant grant gone gone so it's\nlike Grant but with the r and the a\nswapped over that makes sense okay\ninteresting what yeah what's the origin\nof that name uh it's Ty so that's I'm\nfrom Thailand or at least my parents are\nfrom Thailand but uh I grew up in\nEngland uh but yeah that's my Thai name\nand everyone it's it's a meme but\neveryone always confuses it for Grant\nwhich I'm very very used to okay yeah so\nI'm I'm happy to call you Garner yeah\nGantt guard okay\num and so so you're you're one of the\nhosts of trash taste\ncan you tell us about that\nYeah so basically we so basically a\nbunch of us uh so I guess I should start\nright at the beginning\nuh so first and foremost I guess I'm\nlike an anime YouTuber I have been doing\nYouTube since about\n2007. uh and that was mostly talking\nabout anime and reviewing anime uh and\nalong the line uh like I think like\nthree years ago now uh a bunch of us\nmoved to Japan a bunch of anime\nYouTubers and we decided to start a\npodcast together uh and we kind of\nmarketed it as an anime podcast and then\nwe immediately threw an UNO reverse card\nand was like actually uh we're gonna\ntalk about everything but anime a lot of\nthe times\nso I kind of just uh blew up from there\nI think we were very lucky uh I I still\ndon't know what the secret former is but\nit a lot of people have known us for\ntrash days and I'm very thankful for\nthat okay awesome so y'all moved to\nJapan\nyes we moved to Japan we basically got a\nopportunity from a Japanese company\nsince we all like worked doing anime\ncontent on YouTube anyway and they were\nlike hey do you want to make content in\nJapan where anime comes from so that\nwould make things a little bit easier uh\nand we'd all been friends for like a few\nyears and uh the idea of a podcast had\nbeen floated around uh but we wanted to\ndo the podcast in person that was like a\nbig thing and we all lived in different\nplaces in the world so as soon as we\nmoved to Japan that was like okay I\nguess it's time to start the podcast\nlike Annie weeb's dream yes I do I do\nget that a lot and I you know sometimes\nI look back at myself and I'm like damn\nI never thought I would be in this\nposition when I started my YouTube\nchannel to like you know it was like\nkind of like the weeb cringe dream to\nlike move to Japan and just make content\nabout anime and work with anime\ncompanies but I'm very thankful to be\nable to do that yeah that's awesome man\nyeah and is there something in\nparticular you wanted to talk about\ntoday or\noh I mean this I mean\nI'm I'm like free to Just Vibe or talk\nabout specific topics uh you know\nthankfully I'm feeling pretty good about\nmyself I don't have too many in-depth\nthings I want to talk about I think uh I\nguess while we're on the topic of anime\nthough I guess like one thing that I\nwould love to ask you about is maybe\nlike the relationship between fictional\nmedia which I've always found\nfascinating because for me personally\nlike\nI don't know I don't know if this is a\nnormal thing but I've always found it\neasier to emotionally attach myself and\nemotionally invest myself in like a\nfictional story as opposed to sometimes\neven more in a fictional story than in\nreal life\nso like I've had I guess like real life\nevents that have happened to me that\nhave affected me less than sometimes\nwatching a character go through a\nsimilar experience in a fictional story\nand how do you can you tell tell me more\nabout that\nyeah sure so I'll give you a specific\nexample\num I think the first time I've really\nnoticed this happening was when my\ngrandma passed away\nand uh that was like that was back when\nI was like 22 23 or something and uh\nobviously you know I was very very close\nto my grandma and I was obviously\ndevastated very sad that happened\num but I remember like being at the\nfuneral and I didn't feel the emotions\nthat I thought I was gonna feel if that\nmakes sense I it all felt almost\ndreamlike like it was happening but it\nwasn't really happening\num and then like I think like a year or\nlike a few months later I watched like\nthis anime uh it's it's an anime called\nSummer Wars and part of the a big aspect\nof some Wars is there is this Grandma\nthere and they have a very similar\nfamily Dynamic to the family Dynamic I\nhad\nuh and seeing like\nlike this is a slight spoiler but uh a\nsimilar thing happened to the grandma in\nthe story and when that happened it like\nall the emotions I guess I thought I\nwould feel at my grandma's funeral kind\nof just like hit me all at once and\nthat's when I like truly got emotional\nand I guess I just like wasn't expecting\nthat what kind of emotions did you\nexperience watching the anime uh I mean\nI I cried that was that was a big thing\nthat I thought I'd uh that would that\nwas a big thing I thought would happen\nuh at the funeral I had an at an event\nlike that but it didn't like like the\nemotions like the grief and crying and\njust feeling sad and thankful and all\nthe emotions that I guess I cognitively\nregistered but I didn't like emotionally\nit didn't emotionally hit me until I saw\nsomething like that in a fictional piece\nof work\num and I guess yeah it's it's kind of\nlike a running Trend where I think\nthat's why I love anime so much I love\nmovies I love all sorts of media because\nI can can connect with it emotionally\nmuch easier as long as it's almost as if\nthere's like not as big of a barrier\nthere for me to like emotionally put\nmyself into it absolutely so that's it's\na fascinating topic man like there's so\nmuch going on but can I ask just one or\ntwo quick questions before I kind of so\ndo you think that the experience you had\nwatching the anime related to the fact\nthat you lost your grandmother or do you\nthink it because like you could have all\nkinds of emotional experiences watching\nanime like do you think that you\nbasically like I'm getting this kind of\nimplication that there was a lot of\ndormant emotion that then like opened up\nthrough anime yeah yeah I I think I\nthink there were a lot of dormant\nemotions that I didn't know how to like\nbring to the surface or at least it just\ndidn't come natural where when I watched\nwhen I watched the anime it just it just\nfeels more natural to bring these\nemotions up to the surface whereas in\nyou know daily life in real life there\nmight be like a few barriers there and\nI'm not sure where that comes from or\nwhere that came from but uh yeah I've I\nfind it interesting myself and uh\nI'm not sure if there's a lot of people\nlike me out there but it's something\nthat I experience at least absolutely so\nhow long of a answer do you want\nas long as you want to give I'm I'm very\nfascinated and very curious about it so\nI I'm kind of curious would you say that\nthis happened do you think there's a\ngender specificity here that the the\nemotional numbness in real life and\nemotional access and Anime based on your\nexperience do you think there's a gender\ncomponent to that or is that basically\nthe same between all genders uh I mean I\ncan only speak my own experience but I\ndo think at least with my gender my\nculture\num I you know I grew up in I guess like\na traditional Thai family and the man\nhad to be seen as like I guess not like\nthe strong the strong part of the family\nnot showing too much emotions and I\nguess that might be part of the reason\nwhy it was easier for me to show\nemotions when I'm watching something\nfictional as opposed to when there's a\nreal life event happening okay and and\nwhen you when you kind of go through\nyour life what is your like I know this\nkind of a weird question but like what\nis your like emotional experience like\non a day-to-day basis what is my\nemotional experience like well\nI'm always on a journey of\nself-improvement so I always try to like\nI think it's a very important thing to\nbe aware of yourself and you know\nuh take a step back sometimes and think\nis there a better way I can approach\nthis so you know in more recent years\nI've been trying to let those emotions\nflow more freely in day-to-day life\ninstead of just in like a safe\nenvironment of a fictional World\num but right now I guess\nI\nI guess I'm pretty I'm a pretty calm\nperson\nlike all things considered uh I think a\nlot of it\nhas to do with so this this is going\nlike completely off topic now but a lot\nof it has to do with kind of my\nupbringing but also I\num when I was in Thailand uh about 23 I\nuh became a monk for like about like a\nmonth to six weeks and that really\nhelped me let's say not train myself but\njust be more aware of my internal\nemotions and my internal thoughts and\nhelps me really reflect\num better\nso I would say that on a day-to-day\nbasis I'm a pretty calm chill person and\nI you know if they're if there's\nsomething that is emotional I try to let\nthose emotions like well up a bit more\nbecause I feel like a big problem when I\nwas a kid is that I didn't understand\nthe difference between uh\nlet's say acknowledging that an emotion\nexists and kind of like dealing with\nthat as opposed to just pushing it away\nand just ignoring that there's a\nnegative emotion there\nwow that's fascinating dude I have so\nmany questions for you\num okay uh so tell me a little bit about\nbecoming a monk like how did that happen\noh yeah sure I mean it's like whenever I\nsay I became a monk it's like to me it's\na pretty normal thing because in\nThailand uh like Buddhism like is\n[ __ ] massive there uh and so a lot of\npeople there are Buddhists and you know\nwhen we when we are brought up\nuh so I was brought up in a Buddhist\nfamily so it's normal for the child\nuh to become a monk at least twice in\ntheir lives once when you reach teenage\nhood and once when you reach adulthood\nuh and you know doing that can bring\nGood Karma good blessing to your family\nuh to your parents as well but I kind of\ndid it for that reason and also for\ndifferent reasons\num I kind of became a monk so a lot of\nthe times it's per tradition so some\npeople just become a month from one day\nor two days or something like that\num so in this instance I decided to\nbecome a monk for a pretty long time it\nwas a a month to a six week period I\ncan't remember\nexactly how long it's been a very very\nlong time and it can't I like I decided\nto do it in a point of my life where I\nfelt a little bit lost and I felt like\nI felt like I needed time to really find\nout what I truly believed uh because\nactually similar to the grandma events\num like I had a I had a point\nwhere I realized in my early Twenties\nthat I didn't know where my beliefs came\nfrom do I really believe these things\nbecause of my own experiences and my own\nthoughts or do I believe these things\nbecause someone instilled them to me\nbecause my parents taught me that way or\nbecause my culture taught me that way\num and so I kind of realized that [ __ ] I\ndon't actually know what I believe what\nuh what my view on life is\num and I kind of needed some time to\njust reset everything\num and get some time to really develop a\nGood Foundations within my own beliefs\nand being a monk really truly helped\nthat it made me more confident in myself\nand uh\nand yeah it was kind of like\nlife-changing for me can you can you\nhelp me understand what what you kind of\nlearned or discovered or how you got\ncentered from that experience\nyeah sure so\nlike I feel like for me it was like a\nvery extreme measure but you know\nbecoming a monk you have to let go of\nall attachments like for that time\nyou're a monk so you have to let go of\nyou know technology you have to let go\nof\num Family bonds\num old debts all kind of like baggage\nand you have to live the simplest life\nyou can possibly live you know that's\nthat's kind of like the philosophy of\nthe Thai Buddhist monk where you you\njust get rid of all attachments and you\nlive the simplest life and by doing that\nit just helped\nget all of like the noise that was\nsurrounding me and was around me and\nreally allowed me to reflect on pretty\nmuch everything every little decision\nthat I had made in life to get me to\nthat point and it helped me to really\nunderstand\nwhat kind of person I want to be and why\nI was the person I was at that time can\nyou give me an example of what kind of\nnoise you had in your life at that time\nuh I mean\nanything could be like any anything\ncould be noise whether it be societal\npressure to like get a job or you know\nfamily drama or some kind of like drama\ngoing on in my own life with\nrelationships\num and you know there was a lot of\nworries and I went through a pretty\ntraumatic experience just before that as\nwell\num and so there was just a lot of\nemotions that\nstopped me from really taking the time\nto really\nFocus purely on myself and focus purely\non nothing else\nand just living the simple life and\nfiguring out what kind of person I am\nand what what did you figure out about\nthe kind of person you are\nuh what\nthat's that's a very loaded question\num I figured out that you know a big\nthing at that time\nwas I would kind of like try to do\nanything to please another person you\nknow I I would I would go out my way\njust to seem like\njust to be liked or come off in a\npositive manner to another person and I\nrealized that a lot of the negative\nuh a negative relations uh relationships\nI had in my life at that point uh\nstemmed from the need of I guess like\npositive affirmation for someone that\nmaybe didn't really matter as much as I\nthought they did in my mind\num and it really helped me shape the\nrelationships and the people that I\nsurround myself going forward into the\nfuture\num I'm like I'm very blessed now because\nI think I have a lot of very close\nfriends very uh a lot of friends that I\ncherish dearly\num and I remember growing up my mom was\nlike you'll make the friends of your\nlife in University uh the ones that will\nstick with you to the end and that just\ndidn't happen and I thought there was\nsomething wrong with me and then I just\nrealized I was kind of like going about\nit the wrong way\num I guess that's like one of the things\nI figured out that wow I kind of like\nput into my life philosophy going\nforward\nand and so how how what how did that\nshape your relationships going forward\nhow did that shape my relationship going\nforward\num I would say gave me more confidence\num more confidence just to\nhow can I word this\nuh it gave me more confidence in I know\nthis is going to sound cliche but I mean\nmaybe more confident in just being\nmyself and instead of trying to walk\nmyself\nto become someone another person would\nlike I would try to find people that\nliked me for me as opposed to kind of\nlike\nreforming myself in different social\ninteractions to come off positive to the\nother person sure so it sounds like you\nused to chase people's\num\nacceptance yes yeah acceptance was what\nelse I was looking for thank you yeah\nand and it sounds like you really just\nstarted being comfortable with kind of\nwho you are and acknowledging that\npeople may not accept you but that's\nactually okay yeah yeah exactly like I\nguess I I've I figured out that like it\nwas not worthwhile to pursue connections\nand relationships uh if I didn't feel\ncomfortable just being fully myself\naround people and over time that would\nonly put strain on the relationship\nbecause subconsciously I would\nnot really want to uh sustain the\nrelationship and I was only doing so\nfor some kind of like acceptance and\naffirmation and that was the wrong way\nto approach it so garnt oftentimes when\npeople are in those situations they kind\nof\none of the reasons they can sort of\nalmost become dependent on the\nacceptance of others is if like they're\nafraid of like loneliness right so if\nyou kind of think about okay if I don't\nbehave this way then this person like\nwon't hang out with me anymore yeah and\nis that so it sounds like that resonates\nwith you yes so so how do you think it\nis that you\nbecause like essentially in order to\nFree Yourself of needing the acceptance\nof others you have to be like okay with\nthe consequences of them leaving you\nright yes how did you get to be okay\nwith that because I think it's that\nneeding another person that really keeps\npeople stuck\nyeah it's basically so you know this\nthere's basically again like\nuh came down to like during like my\nmonth period where I could it's almost\nlike I could trace the future of this\nrelationship and how I would emotionally\nbe be emotionally impacted from that so\nyou know I I use this technique a lot in\nmy life where there is you know there's\na lot of things in life where you get\nwhere you look for instant gratification\nlike that like the acceptance of another\nperson but you know there's a lot of\nother things where there's there's that\ninstant gratification where you know in\nthe short term it might not be the best\ndecision for you but\nhow you know how I how I counted that\nwas uh I accepted that you know I I\nunderstood that in the short term\nacceptance uh gaining acceptance from\nanother person felt good it felt good\nbut then I would Trace that I guess\nmyself to the Future\num and just imagine the situations going\nforward and me just not being happy and\nrealizing that it didn't it would never\nfeel that loneliness Gap that I was\nsearching to fill and instead just make\nthe loneliness even like even more\nuh expanded just because\num it would make the loneliness even\nmore expanded\nuh just because I had I was faking like\nmyself to be someone else so I wouldn't\nreally feel like I'd found someone who\nlike had a connection with\num and it was like Imagining the\nlong-term effects of that made me\nrealize that in the short term that is\nnot the way to fix your life and I I\nalways look for you know long-term\nSolutions and long-term things in pretty\nmuch us every aspect of my life yeah I\nmean I think it's fascinating how often\nwe trade feeling good for being unhappy\nyeah right that's that's a trade we make\nso much yeah\num and and oftentimes I think it's just\nreally hard to kind of play that tape\nthrough to the end and really realize\nthat\nin a paradoxical way when I look for\nsomeone's acceptance and they accept me\nand I feel good it's weird because we\ndon't think about that as like\nthe coin that we pay for that is our own\nunhappiness yeah\nand it's really challenging\nyeah\nbut because we tend to think that\nfeeling good and accepting the\nacceptance of others will make us happy\nwhere I think what you sort of said it\nmakes a lot of sense where what it\nreally does to you is makes you more\nalone because then you're not being\naccepted for who you are and so you know\nthen you kind of have to keep up this\nact and and you feel like you have all\nthese shoes to fill and then like you\nknow even though you've bought their\nyou've bought your space in this\nrelationship for today you're gonna have\nto pay with more unhappiness tomorrow\nyeah\num I think like a good way like I guess\nthe way I imagined it but I'm like kind\nof remembering like the literal visual\nimage that I had when uh you know\nsometimes like I was meditating and\nstuff like that I it it always felt like\nyou know before I became a monk like\nwhenever I'd go out whenever I'd\nsocialize there would be like a mask on\nme and sometimes it would be like like\nseveral layers of masks and it would get\nlike heavier and heavier and like I\ncouldn't just like imagined just like\ntaking like the mask off and just you're\nnaked You're vulnerable but if you find\nsomeone that accepts you without wearing\nany masks that's that was the kind of\nconnection that I wanted and I realized\nand I searched for\num and yeah that was one of the aspects\nthat I kind of like realized afterwards\nI was like like okay let's start off\nwith a clean slate and you know for a\ntime I was\nuh I definitely did feel lonely but in\nthe long term I look back I look at\nmyself now and I can be more grateful\nfor the people around me I feel like\nevery every friend I have is a friend\nthat I would uh I would show up anytime\nI would do anything for so I'm very\ngrateful for that wow how do you find\nfriends like that bro\nhow do I find friends like that uh\na lot\na lot of not really trial and error but\njust putting yourself out there\num you know especially when you don't\nhave any a lot of close friends uh you\nkind of like get desperate to cling on\nto any connection you have\num and I'm like a pretty heavy introvert\nI've always been a pretty heavy\nintrovert uh but I wasn't exactly happy\nbeing lonely not having a lot of friends\nso what I did was kind of just like\ntrial by fire\ntry to go to as many events and talk to\nas many people as possible just\nkeep in mind that not everyone I talk to\nI'm going to Vibe with or have a you\nknow close friendship with\num and eventually if you put yourself\nout there enough friendships will just\nform naturally it will take time it'll\ntake effort it's not an easy hour or\nfast process like we talked about the\ninstant gratification but in the long\nterm it will happen naturally and you'll\nhave a strong Foundation of friendships\nand connections to build off of wow\nsounds sounds\nlike it takes a lot of effort\nyeah I mean it to me took a lot of\neffort just because like I said I was I\nwas a really heavy introvert I remember\ngrowing up I basically never went out\nand kind of like never socialized never\nwent out to socialize with other people\nI just kind of made the assumption that\npeople will come to me eventually in\nlife and the realization that that just\ndoesn't happen and I have to make an\nactive effort to pursue\nuh pursue this uh pursue relationships\npursue friendships uh was like a big\nswitch for me so going back to kind of\nyour original question you said you were\nasking about like emotional connection\nto anime why do you think it's easier\nfor you to emotionally connect to anime\nI think just because\nto me it feels like a safe space you\nknow to me\nwhen you're watching a fictional piece\nof work because it's fictional\nit it feels like\nit feels like there won't be any\njudgments or anything like that maybe\num you know like I said I you know grew\nup in a culture where uh you know\nshowing emotions was like not like kind\nof like profound upon maybe not frowned\nupon but definitely\ndefinitely not openly accepted as much\nas it is today\num so I guess like fiction and Anime in\nparticular just became like my safe\nhaven just to be like hey this is this\nis the place where you can show emotions\nyou can feel emotions and you don't have\nto feel guilty or worry about judgment\nfrom it why not\nwhat makes that safe\nbecause it's not real right it's it's\nfiction\nand it's it sounds counterintuitive but\nbecause it's not real you can to me it\nfelt more real than a lot of you know a\nlot of real life events so it's yeah\nit's it's it's a weird it's a weird\ncounter-intuitive\nuh way that my emotions worked\nI I think uh\nI think that's that makes a lot of sense\ncan I uh one thing um guarantee you're\nyou're seem to be going in and out of\nfocus a little bit I'm not quite sure\nwhy but\num now you're in Focus okay sorry for\nsome reason it seems to no it's okay\nokay for some reason sometimes people\nfocus on the on the door behind you but\nso kind of going back to this what makes\nit unsafe to feel emotions in the real\nworld like\num uh\nuh I guess I had like this subconscious\nfear of being judged for burying myself\nout there okay uh I think I think that\nwas\nyeah I think that's the big thing if I\nhad to put into words yeah so so\nsubconscious fear but it also sounds\nlike conditioning right so you were yeah\nit sounds like growing up you were very\nactively taught not to express emotion\nyeah like do you remember what it was\nlike when you cried growing up like do\nyou remember crying\nI'll be honest I don't remember crying\nat all\num before the age of like 20. uh\nobviously like you know as a baby and\nstuff like that but I generally don't\nremember crying at all and the first\ntime I remember crying was what I told\nyou about and I was like oh I I can't\nactually do it okay yeah\nyeah so I mean I think it's it's\nfascinating but first of all this is a\npattern that I see a lot where people\nfeel very emotionally connected to anime\nI've even worked with some people who I\nwould almost say are like addicted\nto\nanime-induced emotion yeah where like\nthey feel numb in the rest of their life\nand one of the reasons that they kind of\nget quote unquote addicted to animes\nanime is like the time and space where\nthey actually get to feel they actually\nfeel alive and connected to these like\nstories and narratives I think there's a\nlot of different pieces to that the\nfirst is that if you look at anime\nanime has Larger than Life emotional\nevoking experiences right so like right\nthe colors are super bright the crying\nthat happens in anime is like really\nanguished right yeah and like it's very\nvery you know there's music involved\nthere's like a lot of kind of like\nbuilding up to stuff so so if you sort\nof think about the medium itself\nit is very very high octane motion yeah\nso I think that there's a group of\npeople out there who are kind of\nemotionally expressed the reason that I\nasked you about a gender component is\nbecause there's good evidence that\nespecially men\nare emotionally like conditioned to be\nnumb\nso there's something called normative\nmale alexithymia so alexithymia is\nessentially like emotional\ncolorblindness so and this is true of a\nlot of women too a lot of women can be\nalexithymic but I think from a cultural\nperspective manner more often\ntaught to be like emotionally suppressed\nyeah and so when you have in a certain\namount of suppression right your\ngrandmother passed away and you almost\ndescribed like a kind of like a\ndepersonalizing experience which is\nactually a trauma response of like it\nkind of feels like a dream like you feel\nreally numb so what's going on in your\nbrain when you feel numb your your brain\nis actually actively suppressing all\nemotions so some like circuit on high\nthat is saying no no no no no no\nemotions\nand because you've been conditioned to\nyou know you shouldn't cry and all this\nother kind of stuff\nand so then what happens is you've got\nthese like emotionally numb men it could\nbe women too anyone who's kind of a Lexa\nthymic who then has this medium which\ngives you like you said kind of a safe\nspace right so first of all when you\nwere crying like were you by yourself\nyeah I was by myself right so that's\nlike the first thing is is why is it why\ndoes anime make it safe for us to feel\nemotion my my money would be that if you\nwere like at an anime convention and\nwatching the same thing with like\nhundreds of people there would be a lot\nmore emotional suppression going on yeah\nand so it the safety of it is that you\ncan have this emotional experience kind\nof like on your own with no one watching\nI think it's very very emotionally\nevoking so you your brain is toning down\nall the emotion and the anime on on the\nflip side is like ramping it up a lot\nwhich is why I think a lot of people\nwill get emotional release through anime\nbecause you need that almost that like\nhigh octane kind of emotional like\nclimax or catharsis or whatever to\nreally feel\nand then I think there's an another\ncomponent which is just that human\nbeings a lot of the emotions that we\nexperience are through like narrative\nand for the same reason that we have for\nthousands of years human beings have\nbeen telling stories right and like\nwhat's the reason for that it's because\nthose stories like will connect with us\non an emotional level whether this is\nkind of like an anime is full of this\nstuff right all these archetypes and\ntropes like Heroes journey and I mean\nyou've got a lot of that [ __ ] in your\nlife with like you know going monk mode\nand discovering yourself and then like\nthis kind of weird like Redemption Arc\nwhere you know you were inducted to some\nsecret kenjutsu or whatever like when\nyou were a monk and and then you you\nlived the anime dream right someone\ncould make an anime about your life oh\nno no no no no\nit is not that interesting I I see\nyou've got a ring on your finger so I'm\ncurious if you found a relationship that\nis is romantic and fulfilling yes uh I\ngot married last year\num and\nyeah I mean a lot of a lot of what I'm\ntalking about now uh I am so like I\ncouldn't have found a more perfect\npartner in the world uh and I believe a\nbig part of it is something important to\nme to me in a relationship is balance\nand teaching teaching each other\nsomething and balancing each other out\nso my partner is like maybe on the\nsurface like pretty much the complete\nopposite of me\nshe uh you know she's someone who is not\nafraid to let her emotions well up and\nkind of like is not afraid to\ngo with her gut feeling a lot of times\nand gut instincts and I was always been\nsomeone who's been very calm and very\ncalculated uh but she's taught me so\nmuch about\nmanaging you know managing emotions\nletting it be okay to show emotions to\nuh get emotions out I mean the first\ntime I ever cried in front of someone\nelse was in the like uh I think in front\nof her uh it's it's interesting you\nmentioned that before just because I\nremember so many instances in public\nwhere something emotional would happen\nand like my eyes would start watering up\nand it would get to a point uh and I\nwould get emotional and then suddenly\nit's like just on the cusp of crying\nsomething would like flick in my brain\nand then my body would just be like nope\nthis this isn't happening now and I'm\nlike okay well I guess I'm like reset\nback to zero now yeah so if you kind of\nlook at that right so what's happening\nis you're getting some kind of like\nprobably I would say cortical response\nmaybe maybe not cortical actually but\nyou're getting some kind of response\nthat shuts down the emotion and I don't\nknow if this kind of makes sense but the\nmore the more\nthe more the greater the flood of tears\nthat is imminent the stronger that that\nresponse has to be which is\nparadoxically why like at funerals right\nso like there's a huge flood of tears\ncoming and so you're gonna even like\ndisconnect even harder to the point\nwhere you're even in kind of this\ndreamlike state and then I think what\nhappens is all those tears are stored up\nand then when you watch an anime you're\nkind of like there's so much emotion\npacked in there that it just opens the\nfloodgates because then the other thing\nis you're by yourself I think that's\nlike you're talking about this you know\nwhat's safe about it what's safe about\nit is if you sort of think about it\nhaving most emotionally connective\nexperiences require other human beings\nbut the whole point is that if you're\nlike emotionally\num if you're like an emotional Fortress\nand you don't want to be vulnerable and\nyou want to be protected like you can't\nit's hard to evoke that emotion that's\nwhere I think anime comes in because\nthere's a bunch of emotion and you can\nkind of do it in the safety of your own\nhome so you can like sit there and like\nyou can ball and like you're kind of\nlike even then I would imagine at the\nvery beginning you don't want a ball\nright you feel that\nshot off switch kind of turning on but\nthen you kind of let it not shut off you\nkind of hold it at Bay and then it\nstarts coming out and it starts to feel\nreally good and then you check the door\nto make sure no one's gonna like walk in\non you and yeah you know\nand and I remember like kind of\nrealizing like later in life I think\nlike how important that is for me\nbecause by having like this emotional\nshutoff I think I went through a lot of\nmy life where I just felt disconnected\nyou know I just sometimes you felt\ndisconnected from people or just\ndisconnected from the stuff happening\naround you and I feel like\nbeing more emotionally aware has helped\nme really become a better person if like\nyou know I I feel like I've become a\nmuch better person much more balanced\nperson because of it and uh yeah a lot\nof this has you know been my wife\nkind of like showing me\nnot like not really show me but help\nhelping me to understand that it's okay\nuh and helping me to get comfortable\nwith it and you know I couldn't be more\nI couldn't be more grateful for my wife\nfor that it sounds like an amazing it's\na woman\nyes yes woman yes um it sounds like\nshe's an amazing woman oh yes\nyes thank you yeah I mean I you know I I\ntruly believe that\nyou know I'm not sure if I believe in\nsoul mates but I believe I believe a\nsoul mate isn't someone who is perfect\nfor you\nright as you meet but I believe what's\ntruly special and truly important is\nfinding something finding someone who\nyou are willing to change yourself to\nbecome a better person for that person\nand that person reciprocates that by\ndoing it it's a real anime level [ __ ]\nright here what is is this I\nhow I envisioned how to have a happy\nlife I think like the end goal of\neverything I think the end goal of all\nof this I just want to be [ __ ] happy\nman but I I just want to I just want to\nbe happy with myself and my life around\nme and yeah I'm just constantly on a\njourney uh to be the happiest person I\ncan be and why\nwhy\nlife is just better if you're happy\nlife life is life is better if you're\nhappy and you know your life experience\nwill always change your life situation\nwill always change\num but if you're happy the world's just\nbrighter and you feel good just being\nalive and existing I guess\nyeah dude this is the I think you've\nreally internalized a lot of anime\nbecause a lot of what you're saying I\ncan absolutely see as like parts of you\nknow\nthere's some after the climax you have a\ncouple people that are like sitting on a\npark bench and musing about life and\nbeing happy and yeah and I mean I think\na lot of this does also come down to my\na lot of like my Buddhist upbringing as\nwell uh a lot of it is kind of like\nfinding\nlike a lot of Buddhism especially the\nones I taught is about finding internal\npeace and internal happiness\num and a lot of the teachings that we\nhave in the way of life kind of like try\nto guide you in that direction so I\nguess maybe seeing like a lot of these\nmorals that you know you you say you you\ntalk about anime a lot of these morals\nthat are seen in anime kind of like\nresonate resonated with me very very\ndeeply just because that was already\ninternalized about how he should live\nlife\num and what what kind of person you\nshould aim to be anyway\nand and can you tell me a little bit\nabout that like what kinds of you know\nwhere does happiness come from how do\nyou seek it\noh that is a loaded question that I do\nnot have the answer for but\num what is a loaded question a loaded\nquestion is\nsomething that maybe I haven't thought\ntoo deeply about and would could\npossibly Branch off into about 10\ndifferent things depending on how my\nmind works uh at that time\nuh but I mean what is happiness to me\num happiness is finding self-fulfillment\nand\nI don't know if gratification is the\nright word it's it's a struggle to find\nlike the right words to describe what it\nis but to me\nif I you know if I can't find the exact\nright word to describe it the feeling I\nget is just feeling like your soul is\nfull if that makes sense like that's\nthat's kind of that's that's kind of\nlike the feeling that I get when I think\nhappiness and fulfillment\nyou know it's interesting are you\nfamiliar with this term dukkha\nokay so I I'm not sure what language you\nknow your what this tradition is in I\nimagine it's Thai yes Thai yes um and\nand so do you is there a word for like\nthe basic like you know when the Buddha\nwas talking about like what's you know\nwhat's suffering like what word do you\nall use for that\num\nso I'm not sure because a lot of\nBuddhism was is like in Sanskrit and\nPali uh which I've never really\nunderstood uh the only the closest thing\nto like\num what I was talking about is like a\nThai concept called Jai which is like\nthe heart and I think a lot of Thai\nculture revolves around the concept of\njai it's like the heart so for example\nlike\num you know when we refer to something\nthat if you're impatient it's Jaylon\nwhich literally just means hot heart\nso a lot of a lot of my internalizations\nabout how I deal with emotions I guess\nlike it only comes from how I view the\nhearts if that makes sense yeah it makes\na lot of sense so it's sort of like\ndepending on the state of the heart yes\nyes you know different fluctuations of\nthe heart will result in impatience or\nfear or or yes yeah it makes a lot of\nsense so I I mean you know you're\ntalking about kind of fulfillment yeah\nand it's interesting because if you look\nat the Sanskrit word for suffering it's\ndukkha and literally what duka\ntranslates to is empty space\nright so it's like I kind of think about\nsuffering is anything it's the Gap it's\nit's the gap so if you kind of think\nabout oh I I heard this anime was really\nepic\nand so then I sit down to watch it and\nI'm like it's like pretty good but it's\nnot as epic as everyone is saying so if\nyou sort of think about in that moment\nthere's discontent right you're like eh\nI'm a little bit disappointed so what is\nthat disappointment it's the gap between\nyour expectations and your experience\nand if you really look at like what is\nthe source of any unhappiness\nYou'll Always Find a gap\nand when I hear you kind of talk about\nfulfillment what does it mean to be\nfulfilled it means that there's an\nabsence of a gap there's no Gap that's\nfull right right whether it's a romantic\nrelationship or whatever like the\nrelationship even though it isn't\nperfect and there are problems there\nthere's no Gap does that kind of make\nsense yeah yeah that that makes total\nsense uh I I it's funny because the way\nyou just described it is basically how I\nEnvision it in my mind as well sometimes\nI feel like there is a gap in my life\num and you know gaps you know even if\nyou can be completely fulfilled at one\nperson one point in your life that\ndoesn't mean that as you grow older\nyou're getting more life experience that\na new Gap is going to appear somewhere\nso I believe that my life has been a\njourney to try and try and fill in those\ngaps as best as I can to be fulfilled\nand be happy so I think you are actually\nyou hit the nail on the head on that\nyeah how does it feel continuously fill\ngaps\noh I mean\nit's uh\nit takes effort I wouldn't say it's\ntiring but it takes effort it takes a\nconstant uh it takes constant energy\num but I believe the feeling you get\nwhen you\nare able to fill in one of those gaps\nthat's that's kind of like that's always\nthe high that I always chase in life\num and I will continue chasing for the\nrest of my life I think\nwell I would hope not\nwhat do you mean\nwell so earlier you were talking about\nlike you know self-improvement is really\nimportant to you\nbut you know it's kind of interesting\nbecause like what you're sort of\ndescribing is that yeah there's like a\nconstant Gap that you're trying to fill\nso even if you kind of go like a level\nmeta\nthere's a a gap of unfulfilled gaps does\nthat kind of make sense like you're\nalways like and then like you you feel\ngood right when you fill in the Gap you\nfeel good but as you said it's temporary\nand then it requires like more effort to\nfill the next Gap in more effort to fill\nthe next Gap and more effort you know\nI'm not saying that it increases with\neach one but it's always requiring and\nso if you kind of think about it there's\nlike a there's like a a level of a\nhunger\nwhich I don't know if you actually have\nor not but that's the kind of like one\nlevel like your discontent with having a\ngap to begin with yeah\nthat's that's interesting that you say\nbecause I guess\nI guess like this conversation is\nhelping me find out a lot about myself\nas well\num I sometimes what we do here yeah I've\nnever been the type of person who has\nfelt comfortable sitting still you know\nI don't know what it is but I always\nlike to be you working towards something\nI guess that's what drives me\num and I guess part of that part of that\ndrive I mean I I like the way you word\nand now I think having that drive to do\nsomething is like is you know filling in\na gap for myself I I feel\nI feel good working towards something\nand if I'm in a point in life where\nnothing seems to be happening then then\nI actually feel unfulfilled I actually\nfeel like I don't really have a purpose\nor something I'm working towards so I I\nthink yeah subconsciously I'm always\ntrying to work towards something doing\nsomething new yeah and how does it feel\nto be constantly improving\nI like it I like it um I can see that\nyeah I I can you know I like being on a\njourney I don't think that I don't think\na perfect person exists in this world\nbut I believe striving towards\nPerfection can only make you a better\nperson and I'm not saying like\nPerfection like as a concept that's you\nknow\nI have to be the perfect I'm not like a\nperfectionist to be like I have to be\nthe perfect person and anything less I\nam unsatisfied with but having\nlike having something you work towards\nis to me something that gives me\nfulfillment and happiness as well\nand purpose in a lot of ways I think\nthere's a there's a really subtle so\nsometimes when I hear that people are\nlike constantly into self-improvement\nthere are kind of two shades of people\nwho are into self-improvement one is it\nalmost can feel like an addiction where\nI need to be better I need to be better\nI need to be better and if you kind of\nlook at like the addiction to\nself-improvement it can it can\ncome from a fundamental lack of\nacceptance with yourself\nright like I'm not good enough and if I\nget better\nI will then be good enough\nbut since that feeling comes from you it\ndoesn't actually come from any external\nthing no amount of accomplishment makes\nthe feeling go away because it's not\nreally coming from the lack of external\naccomplishment that's coming from you\nbut I don't see that in you I what I\nactually see in you is something that's\nvery different even though it looks very\nsimilar which is that\nit sounds like Devotion to the process\nof improvement is what really helps you\nfeel fulfilled and I would even Venture\nthat failure doesn't feel like a setback\nfor you no\nand there's a huge difference because in\none I I see you're about to say\nsomething so I'll be quiet in a second\nbut in one case you know people whether\nthey feel good or not really depends on\nwhether they accomplish the thing\nwhereas on the flip side being devoted\nto self-improvement is sort of like an\naction as opposed to a goal I think is\nwhat really can lead to a lot of\ncontentment and oftentimes people get\nthe two confused because they look very\nsimilar because both people are devoted\nto self-improvement the big difference\nis for one person their feeling of\ncontentment depends on the Improvement\nitself whereas for the other person\nthey're actually free from the actual\nImprovement and it's kind of the\nDevotion to the attempt that their\nhappiness comes from\nyeah\num I I honestly I I think I was going to\nsay something and you pretty much said\neverything I wanted to say\num yeah I mean I if I I I don't want to\nbe a better person because it's like you\nknow like a constant goal I just\nlike I I feel like if I lose if I lose\nthat drive and if I forget what a good\nperson is or you know if if I ever\nforget that\num then that's a slope to like\nI want to say it's like fall back down\nthe hill and\nuh so I've I've completely lost my train\nof thoughts\num\num what I'm trying to say\nis\nI'm always trying to be self-aware of\nmyself right I I I always try to take a\nstep back and reflect on myself as a\nperson and I think doing that is a\nhealthy process just to just to make\nsure that one you think that you're on\nthe right path and two to kind of like\nfigure out if you're really happy I\nthink self-reflection is very important\nbecause unless you you know I met some\npeople who always live in the moment and\nnever look back and I think if you never\nlook back then you can never tell how\nfar you've come\num and I think that's a you know I I\nthink that's a very important aspect of\nanyone who's on a life Journey yeah\nyeah dude they're really heavy anime\ntropes bro\nis it\nyeah I think it's I think this is part\nof the reason that anime is so resonant\nwith people right because I think it\nmirrors our experience of life but I\nmean if you're talking about a a journey\nand and really being able to look back\nand see how far you've come and being\nkind of content with the bumps along the\nway\num yeah\nyeah\nit's while we're in this topic though I\nI was curious because I guess like while\nwe're talking on the topic of like holes\nin your life and things that maybe\nyou're not like completely fulfilled\nwith one thing I've always battled with\nis the concept of like a home\nright\num because you know I as someone who\nhas Thai parents born in born and raised\nin England\num like throughout all of my life I've\nalways\nI've always had a lot of people talk\nabout you know going home or this place\nfeels like home and I guess like I'm\nreaching the point now in my life where\nI'm just like I should probably try to\nthink about settling down somewhere\nbecause I've lived in England I've lived\nin like Japan Thailand uh China for a\nbit as well and I think a lot of that\nwill subconsciously me trying to find a\nplace that I felt like I belonged uh\nbecause it's it's like it's like weird\nbecause you know it's not it's not like\nI don't like I'm uncomfortable in\nsomewhere like England or Thailand for\nexample but for example when I go back\nto Thailand I love it it feels like like\nI have family there feels so good uh I\nalmost feel at home but I feel like\nbecause I grew up abroad like when I\nspeak to I have like a slight British\naccent when I speak Thai so people can\ntell I grew up abroad I will never fully\nbe viewed as as like someone Thai and\nyou know growing up in England as well\nuh I grew up in Brighton which is now a\nvery Progressive City but when I was\ngrowing up there wasn't very many Asian\nlike many Asian immigrant kids\nuh surrounding me so I definitely fell\nout of place in England as well and I\nthink subconsciously I've always been\nsearching for a place where I felt\ncomfortable\num but I I you know still to this day\nI'm still trying to find a place where\nuh where I can truly call my home and I\nwill be happy settling down with I was\nselling down hats sorry\nis there a question there\nyeah\num I I guess I guess the question is is\nthis\nis this a normal feeling to have uh is\nthis something I should really be kind\nof like trying to\ntrying to fill this Gap in my life or am\nI just looking at it the wrong way do\nyou think\nyes to all of the above\nokay so I mean I I have an answer for\nyou I\nit's one that I feel 100 confident about\nand is probably the most wrong thing I'm\ngonna say over the course of this\nconversation okay\nso I think the first thing to understand\nis that\nis it a normal feeling it is for you I\nmean you're you're Karma your karma is\nvery unique like you were not born to\nhave a home you were born to find a home\nright so like I think this is a should\nyou pursue it 100 and I think you're\ngonna find your home but I I don't think\nthat you're gonna I think like that like\nfinding your home is part of your\nJourney For You especially so you're\nlike an expat grew up so Thailand's not\nyour home Japan isn't I mean sorry uh\nBritain it sounds like Brighton isn't\nyour home yeah and and so I think that\nyou should absolutely find a home\nbecause that's the Gap that you feel\nright like you don't you want it\num but I don't think this is the tricky\nthing I I think are you thinking about\nyou're wrong I think you are in the\nsense that I don't know how much of\nfinding a home is like doing internal\nwork or improving I think it's just\ncircumstance so you're you're also like\na nomad like you're karma is nomadic\nright and I Think You're Gonna Keep On\nnomadding around until you find your\nhome and you'll know when you get there\nand it could be Japan like what like how\ndo you feel about Japan\num I mean I love Japan uh\nI like you know it's it's very very\namazing country to live in I love the\nculture there\num it's definitely not a place that I\nthink I could call home in the long term\nit's you know it's it's this feeling in\nJapan where\nI'm\nI think like\nI'm accepted\nbut it's not where I belong if that\nmakes sense yeah it's and I want to find\nsomewhere where I belong\num that's that's kind of like what you\nknow the Nomad kind of Life of like what\nI've been searching for where a lot of\nthese places I am accepted but there's\nsomething in me the way I feel like I\ndon't truly belong there\num and yeah it's it's uh it's kind of\nlike\nit's it's I don't know if like I'm being\ntoo picky because you know they're\nthey're like there are aspects I love\nand everywhere I've lived where I love\none aspect\num but there's other aspects where you\nknow I don't I don't really like uh like\nfor example in England I I love all my\nfriends there I feel you know culturally\nuh I feel I Vibe with England a lot and\na lot of my closest friends are in\nEngland\nuh I just I just never felt like I truly\nbelonged in England personally uh I much\nprefer the kind of like the climate and\nthe\nway of thinking of Thailand and I\ndefinitely do feel at home they're in a\nlot of aspects uh but you know like I\nsaid even though I Am Thai uh\nI a lot of my interactions in Thailand\nhave have had that like I guess slight\nbarrier just because they acknowledge me\nas Thai but they don't truly see me as\nlike someone tied there yeah\num yeah and you know very similar in\nJapan as well\nso I mean is home a place\nI don't know that's that's a very good\nquestion I think maybe home\nI've been grappling with that question a\nlot is home a place or is home like a\nfeeling because this is this is gonna\nsound like super cheesy but like the\nclosest thing I have a feeling to like a\nhome now\num is like\nwhen I feel like I'm at home is it\ndoesn't really matter where it is but\nsay I've traveled home and\nevery time I went on a journey my mom\nwould always cook me the same meal just\nto be like hey welcome back here's mum's\ncooking again and\nlike the feeling I get was just like\nevery time I take like that first bite\nor like I smell her cooking when she's\njust like when I open the door and I\ncome home for the first time I see\nfamily for the first time in years or\nmonths or years sometimes I'm like\nthat's like that's like the feeling I\nget well I truly realize oh okay I'm\nhome now this this is a good feeling\num and I guess yeah that's kind of like\nthe feeling\nI am searching for that you know is not\nlet's say\nthat that is more internal and not\ndependent on you know seeing family and\nthings like that\ndoes that make sense or yeah yeah but\nI'm confused you're saying it doesn't\ndepend on seeing family\nbecause when you describe a home to me\nit sounds like you're talking about\nfamily\nyeah I guess I guess so\nI guess family yeah family is a very\nimportant thing to me\num\nso I\nyeah I guess I guess family is a massive\nthing to me in terms of having a home\ncould I live with my family\nthat's uh that's a that's a different\nquestion\nbut uh yeah so I mean I mean I I my\nJapanese is Rusty but that I'm on right\ntadima yes and and and so that's what\nyou're looking for yeah yeah and so I\nthink there are a couple things at play\nhere the first is is that literally it\nsounds like you're looking for Home in\nthe wrong place in the sense that you're\nlooking for it in a place I I don't know\nthat it's in a place especially when I\nhear you talk I mean it sounds like home\nto you is is a particular meal or things\nlike that and when you say you you don't\nknow if you can live with it you're not\nyou don't need to live with your family\nlike you've got a new one coming\nright so you get you get to craft your\nown and I suspect that five to ten years\nfrom now\nlike I think you're sort of like in I\nthink you're totally fine but I also\nthink you're kind of like looking in the\nwrong places where right you're like\nokay I don't feel at home in Thailand so\nthat that's your answer right it doesn't\nmean that you need to make yourself fit\nin Thailand or you need to make yourself\nfit in Britain or you need to make\nyourself fit in Japan if none of those\nthings feel right to you that's not your\nhome right and so what's going to happen\nover time is you're going to keep\nlooking in different places and one of\ntwo things happens when people are don't\nfind a home they keep looking everywhere\nuntil they find their home which\nsometimes happens like place number\nthree place number four you look like\nyou're about to say something go for it\nI won't oh no no I was uh I was just\nburping sorry and so either you'll find\nit like maybe it'll be the states or you\nknow some other location or whatever and\nthen the other option is that you know\nwhat's going to happen is you're gonna\nlike be looking for it looking for it\nlooking for it you're going to do your\npodcast whatever you're gonna come home\none day and your wife is gonna be there\nand and y'all are gonna hang out or\nsomething like that and then it's gonna\nfeel like home\nbut I I don't know that you need to go\nlooking for personal Improvement which\nis I'm afraid something that you may be\ndoing like oh like I need to like allow\nthis to be my home right like I need to\nlike become a better human being and\naccept no like that's you know no and\nthen it's not a place and it's not\npersonal Improvement it's something that\nyou're gonna grow into like I don't know\nif you're thinking about having kids but\nif you like have kids and stuff like\nyeah I mean kind of work your way into\nhome I think a lot of the reason a lot\nof these questions has been propping up\nis because I didn't really put much\nthought into it\num and then you know I'm 33 now and the\nidea of kids is something that you know\nwe've definitely been playing around\nwith uh not too soon but something that\nwe have been aware of\num and that's kind of that's kind of\nlike I guess where all a lot of this\nlike anxiety comes from to be like oh\n[ __ ] like I need to like you know it's\nit's fine living The Nomad life now when\nI'm a YouTuber and I have all this\nfreedom and stuff but you know when I\nhave responsibilities when I have a kid\nI'm like okay I want a stable life for\nmy kids uh so it's it's kind of like\ntrying to find that balance that I would\nbe happy raising a family in\nyeah so I I think uh\nyou know my my experience and I you know\nI've worked with a lot of people who\nhave kids I don't know how else to say\nthat but I I think that a lot of times\nbefore you have kids and before you have\na home you know you're like looking for\nstuff but it's kind of\nyou're trying to figure this out with\nlike a blindfold like I think a big\nexperience of life is that\nyour kids will carve out the home for\nyou so like a lot of times especially\nwhen it comes to kids like we think that\nwe have to set everything up before the\nkid comes along but I mean the kid the\nkid is gonna\nscrew everything up anyway like there's\njust no way that you can adequately\nprepare to be a parent you just can't do\nit right in my opinion anyway but the\ngood news is that you don't have to in\nthat like you know you'll I I have a\nfeeling hopefully you that you'll carve\nout your home it's not something that\nyou're gonna find preform not you\nunfortunately yeah you know your family\nisn't it's not your existing family\nyou're gonna carve out this new family\nyou're gonna carve out if you decide to\nhave kids it'll be a place it'll start\nto grow on you over time and you'll set\nsettle down you'll have Roots because\nright now what I'm hearing is that\nyou're looking for a perfect place like\noh this is the problem in Thailand that\nI mean a home isn't perfect it's yeah\nthere's lots of problems with it as\nyou'll discover\nokay and then that's just the thing\nthough is that it's the place that you\naccept in spite of its flaws whereas a\nlot of times when we're looking for a\nhome we're looking for that place where\nthat feels right okay and it feels right\nbecause you break it in you know it's\nlike a pair of shoes like you wear them\na couple times and then they feel right\nyeah thank you very much I mean I I\nnever expected to talk about any of this\ncoming coming on if I'll be on this side\nit's just something that's just like\nkind of like came to me as we were\ntalking about great or previous things\nthat we were you know mentioning before\nI can't remember yeah I can't even\nremember how this conversation started\nat the beginning\num well we started I mean\nyeah go ahead sorry oh no I was just\ncurious I mean so we you would ask me\nthis question about like emotions and\nAnime and I I mean if you've got other\nquestions like that I'd love to hear\nthem\nyeah I mean I just\num let me think because like I don't\nhave any like concrete questions now\nbecause I I tried to think about what I\nyou know what what I really wanted to\ntalk about on this podcast or I don't\nknow if this is even a podcast or just\njust us I don't know either shooting the\n[ __ ] this has evolved into something\nthat you know I definitely wasn't\nexpecting but I've been very very\ngrateful about\num\nyeah I mean like right now right now I'm\njust like happy to be happy in life you\nknow we talked about being fulfilled\num I honestly like took this opportunity\njust\nI just to I I think a big thing is you\nknow help to understand myself better\num I remember you said about\nbefore like three conversations ago\nabout guys being conditioned to not show\nemotions and uh something about that\nreally like resonated with me because\nwith like this new friend group that we\nwith like this new friend group that you\nknow I'm I've happily built up over the\nyears I think we had like just like a\ncasual Hangout\ntwo years ago and the topic of therapy\njust like came up\nand you know every every guy in this\ngroup suddenly just like raised their\nhand to be like yeah I've gone into\ntherapy before as well and I've been\nfriends with these guys for years and we\nhad just never talked about this and I\nI'd like I remember telling them like\nguys we've known each other for how many\nyears and we're just bringing this up\nnow what like what the hell how did this\nhappen\num and like I'm wondering do you think\nit's like is it is it a cultural thing\nor is is it something that is embedded\nin all cultures or is it purely\npurely something that's hardwired into\nus well is is what what is the it\nthe feeling of like us having to like\nclose up on our emotions\nthat's a great question so I think there\nare a couple of different answers right\nthe first is that there's absolutely a\nconditioning component\nso right for whatever reason\num and this isn't you know is it more\ntrue of men on average sure but I think\nthat there are plenty of women or\nnon-binary people who grow up in\ncircumstances where they too are taught\nnot to display emotion I think it looks\na little bit different so for example a\nlot of the women that I work with are\ntaught to equally or they're sort of\ntaught that there are certain like safe\nemotions that you can display but you\n[ __ ] better not display any of the\nunsafe emotions right so like you can't\ndemonstrate discontent or disrespect for\nAuthority or frustration or like you\nknow you're allowed to cry if you're a\ngirl like in some circumstances but like\nyou're not allowed to get upset so I see\nthis a lot with women that I work with\nthat are in kind of high-powered careers\nwhere like getting angry is like oh this\nperson is a [ __ ] and all this kind of\nstuff so it's it's slightly different\nbut\nthere's absolutely a conditioning\ncomponent right second thing is that I\nthink that somewhere along the way now\nthis is where things get weird but I've\nstarted to realize recently that there\nare a lot of biases\nin the way that we deal with emotions\nand I think a lot of those biases are\nreally rooted in our\nso for example a lot of what we talk\nabout in terms of dealing with your\nemotions is talking about your emotions\nright so there's a verbal there's this\nassumption that\nverbalizing emotions is processing them\nbut that I've started I've really been\nlooking into a lot of really interesting\nresearch about the origins of\npsychotherapy and realize that there's\nactually like a pretty big bias in\nPsychotherapy that is towards women\nprobably I'm not 100 sure about this but\nif you look at studies for example like\nmanner reluctant to engage in couples\ntherapy and why is that if you ask men\nit's because they feel like they're\ndisadvantaged and so if you kind of talk\nto them you're like well what do you\nmean you're disadvantaged well like when\nI go into therapy my significant other\nassuming a heteronormative kind of\nperspective like knows how to talk to\nthe therapists and like articulate their\nemotions and I don't know how to do that\nso we go into this therapy session my\npartner is like talking about their\nemotions in a way that like the\ntherapist resonates with them they're\nlike oh wow you're doing really good\nlike their partner's doing a good job\nand I don't know how to say that like I\ndon't know how to articulate it and so I\nkind of feel like I'm at a disadvantage\nI feel like the bad guy in therapy\nbecause I can't articulate my feelings\nand instead like you know does that kind\nof make sense so we have lots of\nresearch that shows that men feel\nuncomfortable in therapy men are more\nless likely to engage in therapy\nand so the question is why\nso it could be because of the way that\nwe're conditioned but I think a bigger\npart that we've haven't really touched\non which I'm suspecting in some light\nevidence for is that if you look at the\norigins of psychotherapy they were\nreally you know like Freud is like a big\npart of that and I think a lot of times\nwhen we were developing the field of\npsychiatry\nright we were trying to figure out okay\nhow do emotions work and we went and we\ntalked to a lot of humans\nand then what happens is based on the\nhumans that we talk to we determined\nthat okay this is how you deal with\nemotions the problem is that the humans\nthat we talk to weren't what weren't a\nrepresentative sample so if you look at\nthe majority of people who engage in\nPsychotherapy it's actually like 60 to\n70 women\num even I'm not sure about this I've\nbeen trying to find statistics on this\nbut I think the majority of Freud's\nclients or patients I think we're women\nbut I could be wrong about that and so\nwhat happens is when we're originally\ndeveloping our idea of okay how do we\ndeal with emotions this is the science\nof dealing with emotions but there could\nbe some kind of intrinsic bias that men\ndidn't really participate in the early\nstudies they weren't the majority of\npatients so when we concluded this is\nhow you deal with emotions we were\nactually looking at a population of 60\nto 70 percent women right or even if it\nwasn't 60 70 women the men that we're\ntalking about in that in like old\nAustria or wherever Freud was may have\nbeen a subset of men that were\nresponsive to like Freud's methodologies\nwhich were highly verbal in nature right\nbut I think a big part of this is that\nthere's this assumption that\narticulation or using verbal stuff to\nmanage emotions is how you do it whereas\nI sometimes wonder having worked with a\nlot of men and women whether that's\nactually How We Do It\nso with dudes like we're more physical\nright and that could be conditioning who\nknows maybe it's genetic\num you know I recently like took part in\nsomething called like an anger ceremony\nwhich is like a bunch of dudes like went\nout into the Wilderness and then like we\nsplit up and we walked off into the\nwoods right and then you like scream or\nyou just let your emotions out in\nprivacy and then you come back and you\nall cry and you hug it out and you Pat\neach other on the back and like\nsomething about that is very like\nhealing but that's very different from\nanything we would imagine in\npsychotherapy but I don't know that so\nI've started really question having\nworked a lot with men and we're talking\nabout dealing with emotions not\nnecessarily pathology so when we come to\npathology and mental illness which\nthere's a whole stop conversation about\nbut in that way Psychotherapy may be the\nmost effective evidence-based approach\nbut I think that there's just some\nfundamental assumptions that we have in\nrelation to okay why are man Alexa\ndimick well\nthere could it may not there just may be\nlike more to it so for example like if\nyou tell a dude like yeah I got dumped\nhow do you feel bro it feels like I got\nkicked in the nuts and we know what that\nmeans so there's like physicality of the\nlanguage we can't articulate what the\nemotion is we can't name it we can't\npick it out but we are able to resonate\nwith each other so I think there's a lot\nmore complexity\nto vulnerability and sort of what we\nshare and what we don't share I'm also\nnot entirely sure like I think it's\nhealthy to share but I'm not sure that\nmen like need to share right to be blunt\nokay so so I kind of hear this from my\nwife where where you know I'll catch up\nwith a friend of mine\nyou know like that I haven't seen in\nfour or five years and she's like did\nyou talk about their divorce and I'm\nlike no we didn't talk about the divorce\nshe's like but you haven't seen him in\nso long and like he got divorced like\nhow could you and they're like no like\nwe talked about video games because\nthat's what we do that resonates with me\nso like we don't we don't need to talk\nlike I know he's divorced he knows he's\ndivorced\nyou know and then like the way that we\nconnect and heal and the way that we\nbond is by like going back to a time\nthat's happier and like I'm done and now\nbeing a [ __ ] psychiatrist I can\nanalyze it and can say like yeah I'm\nlike showing him that I'm still accept\nhim that nothing has changed and I don't\nthink any less of him\nyeah I still think he's a good human\nbeing that I value him the same that I'm\ngonna be there for him in the way that I\nwas 15 years ago and this is the way\nthat we do it\nright right and it makes a lot of sense\num you brought up something that uh I\nkind of like want to ask more about it's\nwhat did you call like the anger camp or\nsomething yeah a ceremony the younger\nceremony because one thing that no I'm\nnot exactly like struggled with uh I\nthink struggles the wrong word but I've\ntried to be aware of is\num anger and kind of like the management\nof anger and I know a lot of people uh\nmay have issues like managing the anger\nto the point where you know get out of\ncontrol I don't know if\nI don't know I don't even know if this\nis an issue I just wanted to ask your\nInsight about it because I don't know if\nI have like the opposite problem where I\nam so very rarely do get angry if that\nmakes sense to the point where sometimes\nI feel a little\nlike maybe even like alien uh when you\nknow something happens and people get\nangry and like\nI some sometimes I get asked aren't you\nangry are you angry and I'm like I'll be\nhonest and be like honestly not really\nuh and sometimes I feel like maybe\nI you know\nmaybe I should be more Angry than I am\nbut sometimes it just like doesn't\nbother me or at least I just don't get\nangry and I don't know I don't know if\nI don't know if that's a normal thing or\nif that's even a healthy thing maybe\nlike a little anger is good\nwhat do you think have you always been\nnot angry\nI've always very rarely gotten angry\num\nI can't remember when but\nI just didn't like the feeling of being\nangry and I think I think my like I\ndidn't I don't know if this is something\nthat happened instantly or something\nthat was like conditioned over time but\nI I just never liked the feeling of\nbeing angry and I just like something my\nbrain was just like you should not put\nyour energy into like it's it's not it's\nnot the best put your energy into that\nemotion because you don't get anything\npositive out of that\num but I guess what I found now growing\nolder is that I feel weird for sometimes\nmaybe being like a bit too chill and not\ngetting angry enough even even if I\nshould\num I'm not sure if a little bit of anger\nis healthy or not\nso it sounds like early on you concluded\nthat anger was\na bad thing to feel yeah yeah I guess so\nI guess that's like just to me\nI'm sorry I guess just to me that being\nangry just wasn't a pleasant experience\nor a pleasant emotion if that makes\nsense yeah and how did you come to that\nconclusion\num\nI think maybe some of the times where I\ngot angry before it never\nI never felt good afterwards I guess I I\nnever felt\nI never felt good after being angry\num\nI think\nI'm not sure I'm not sure what happened\nor if this is like a combination of\ndifferent events but this sounds so\nweird but I remember being in a league\ngame once and and\num\nand I I remember being being in a league\ngame uh when I was like addicted to\nLeague at like one point in my life uh\nand I remember the game which just\nwasn't going well and I just felt anger\nand then I stopped playing the game but\nlike that anger just like didn't subside\nand I'm just like\nwhy why am I feeling this why why am I\nletting this get in the way of like\neveryday life\num\nand every time I felt that lingering\nanger not like I use League which you\nknow obviously a [ __ ] meme but even\nin like other aspects that have happened\nto me I just hated the lingering anger\nand holding on to this lingering anger\num so I kind of like\nmaybe subconsciously kind of like\naverted the anger\num\ngoing forward more and more As I Grew\nOlder\nyeah so is that a problem\nis it a problem is is like I like is it\nhealthy to have a little bit of anger to\nshow a little bit of a bit of anger or\nis this is this something I need to be\naware of what do you think\nlogically I think it might be healthy to\nkind of like throw some anger or like I\nguess maybe maybe not so much anger but\nat least to release some anger\num like you said that's the so I asked\nyou what you think you said logically it\nsounds like it's good to show and feel\nsomething what about yeah\nwhat what's what's your what's the other\npart of your answer what part of your\nanswer is not logical\nuh does that make sense you understand\nmy question yeah like the reason the\nreason I phrase it like that like\nlogically yeah I think what is the other\npart of you think the other part of me\nuh is my heart which which tells me\nyou know I which which tells me man I\ndon't want to put in the effort of like\nI don't want to put in the effort to\nlike deal with this\nso that that's that's like that's like\nthe two sides of me\num and I don't know whether I should\nlisten to my mind or whether I should\nlisten to my heart when so then the way\nyou're resolving that problem is by\nasking me yeah right exactly and so\nyou're hoping that I'm gonna give you an\nanswer that'll solve your internal\nconflict uh yeah hopefully maybe some\ninsight or something like that sure so\nmy first thing is that\nlet me can I think for a second sure\nit's a great great question\nokay\nso you're asking\na theoretical question about anger right\nshould I\nget in touch with my anger should I let\nmyself feel it it sounds like there are\nnegative consequences when you've been\nangry the whole League of Legends thing\nit sounds like it hasn't served you well\nyou know I'd be curious whether your\nparents punished you for being angry\nwhen you were growing up\nI think they kind of instilled in me the\nkind of same philosophy which is anger\nis bad I think a lot of it comes down to\nthat as well were either your parents\nangry\nno okay actually this is\nokay okay now that we're talking about\nit a lot of things are rushing back\nright now\num so the reason I asked this the real\nreason is because even when someone does\nsomething wrongfully to me or my family\nwhich has happened in the past\num\nI remember like the emotional response\nwouldn't necessarily be anger it would\njust be to kind of like shut down\num at least I know that that was like\nthat was my mum's D4 emotional reaction\nwhenever some things happened to her in\nthe past and I think I saw that\num and I saw how she handled it and I\nthink I've kind of maybe subconsciously\ninternalized it\num and it's kind of like affected me I\ndon't think it's necessarily A Bad Thing\nuh except in the case where I do think\nmaybe\nsomeone did wrong me or the people\naround me and my\nfirst internal emotional reaction is not\nto get angry but\njust to like\nanalyze I guess and I and I don't know\nif that's a healthy thing to do I'm sure\nyou do\nyou know\njust do it do I know yeah\nis it a healthy thing to do\nI think\nI think you'd yeah I I genuinely I don't\nknow because\nit makes me feel like\nit makes me feel like if someone did\nsomething bad to someone important to me\nthat\nI should feel like some kind of\nemotional anger and frustration towards\nit like maybe like a bit more instead of\njust going into like taking a step back\nand just analyzing my feelings and stuff\nlike that\num because I feel like that's part of\nbeing human and\nyeah I I think\nI think feeling some emotions for the\npeople that's important around you\nwhether that be positive or negative is\nis is an important part of being a good\nperson I don't know that's that's the\nbest answer I have yeah so I I think you\nthink this is a problem\nright\nyeah that makes sense yeah yeah yeah so\nlike I could even ask for example like\nwere there times in your life where\nsomeone did something to you\nand someone in your family should have\nbeen angry with them and they weren't\nyeah most definitely yes\nso like\noh no sorry not to me not to me sorry\num someone did someone to my to my\nfamily and my family\nat least my mom didn't get angry she had\na different emotional response which was\njust kind of like shutting down how do\nyou feel about that\nI don't know I feel like\nI feel like it wasn't a healthy way to\ndeal with her emotions\num and I've been trying to I guess like\nI thought it was a normal thing until I\nsaw how other people\ndealt with emotions dealt with anger\nespecially and I was like maybe I'm\nmaybe I'm the weird one maybe my parents\nwere the weird ones just because the\nonly people who I'd seen deal with anger\nand situations like this was my parents\nso it was only after growing up and\nexperience seeing other people that did\nI realize that\num\na lot of real realizations and stuff so\nI'm gonna go back okay we're good we're\ngonna get there okay okay so how did it\nso someone in your family was wronged\nyes and what should your mom have done\nmy mom should have\nuh I feel cut that person out of their\nlives or at least\nmake sure that there was some kind of\nrepercussions to what that person did\nsure\num\nand you know I do very much\nbelieve and uh believe in forgiveness\nbut I believe that forgiveness has to be\nearned and I don't believe like my mom\nis such a nice Soul such a kind soul a\nforgiving Soul\num which is kind of like the reason why\nthat I think she forgave this person\num instead of just like trying to like\nRevel in the anger uh but to me I I kind\nof felt like maybe\nthat person didn't do something to earn\nthe Forgiveness\num and it was my mum you know being\nbeing the bigger person and looking over\nit but\nuh I do feel like there should have been\nsome kind of like even just emotional\nrepercussions\nso how do you feel about that\nhow do I feel\nwhat what is the emotion that someone in\nthis situation that you watching your\nmom forgive this [ __ ] person who\ndidn't deserve it\nI guess anger yeah you think yeah\nwow okay here you are asking me should I\nfeel more anger and it's like it's right\nthere you just don't know what it looks\nlike ah okay\nwow\nI feel I feel dumb now\nyeah yeah I guess I do hold some manga\ntowards that and uh I guess I didn't\nrealize that up until\nup until this very moment feeling dumb\nis anger too by the way\nokay who are you angry with when you\nfeel dumb I'm angry on myself there you\ngo right but is frustration the same\nthing as anger you think is it sure\nfrustration is anger diet anger okay\nit's a more I imagine you're better at\nfeeling frustrated than you are feeling\nyeah yeah I guess like when you ask me\nhow I felt it's like my my first\ninternal thought was frustration and I\nwas just like I always like I guess\npainted that different as anger anger\nwas like a much\nstronger emotion for me absolutely so\nfrustration is an umbrella emotion yeah\nand even and especially for men anger\ncan be an umbrella emotion as well\nbecause for a lot of men it's the only\nemotion that really allowed or condition\nto express like oh I'm I'm gonna get\npissed like you know right and and then\nyou know like I'm a lot of anime\nquestions too like how do you feel\nwatching these like anime stories of\nlike Avengers Vengeance and\nrighteousness and\nlike\num\nI've never really gravitated towards\nthose kinds of stories I can appreciate\nit from like a like to me there's like\ntwo different ways of the media right\nthere's\nme viewing it as like critically this is\na very well constructed story and I can\nsee the appeal and then there's how I\nemotionally feel towards a piece of\nmedia which is you know there are some\nanime which I would not recommend to\nanyone uh that I I you know emotionally\ngravitate towards uh I think\nsubconsciously I gravitate to a lot of\nescapism\num so there's this uh there's this genre\nin anime it's called isekai and the\nentire\npoint of this genre is that it's about a\nperson who's been transported to another\nworld right\num and I've always\nI'm not sure if I've liked that idea I\nalways subconsciously gravitate to kind\nof like being in another world\nenveloping the world of the author\num and just something that's a bit\ndetached from a story that's more\ngrounded\ndo people who are in isakai anime do\nthey feel at home in their world\na lot of the times no\num I'll be honest Easter car anime isn't\nthat deep this is like this is purely\nlike a surface level thing\num\na lot of modern Easter guy anime is\nabout a guy who is normally a nerd or\nlike is bullied and then he goes to\nanother world and then he becomes a\nsuper\nUltra powerful person gets all the girls\nand stuff like that and to me it's just\nlike this this is just like junk food to\nme\num sounds like he's a misfit in one area\nand is belongs in another area\nwow why are you gonna do me like that\nman\nyeah\nright\nyeah I mean you're completely right\nyeah oh you're now now you go now you\nsay it like that you are you are\ncompletely right\nyeah I guess so I mean it's it's not\nlike it's not not all of the genres\nrevolving around that I've always loved\nwhether being a misfit or not just like\nenveloping like a world of fiction I've\nalways like even not just Anime but like\nvideo games as well\num that's why probably why like jrpgs is\nlike my favorite genre just because I\ncan just you know\nnot exactly be someone else but just\nexperience something that I wouldn't get\nto experience in the real world\nyeah I mean I I think I'm being a\nslightly facetious here I'm now curious\nif we did a study about\nyou know because we actually there are\nstudies about video games and\npersonality and we know that certain\nkinds of personalities will gravitate\ntowards certain kinds of video games I'm\nso curious if you could do a study about\nwhat kind of anime people watch and like\npsychologically what their temperament\nis or what kind of internal conflicts\nthey have I'm curious about it I'm sort\nof shooting the [ __ ] with you but and we\ncan go back to the anger thing\num but oh no no I think it's telling\nyeah I do think that and this is not\nthat really scientifically radical but\nyou know the media that resonates with\nus resonates with us for a reason right\nit's because there's something in here\nthat we see out there\nyeah and and there's and it's we we're\ncolorblind in here but we see it out\nthere and we're like this is what I'm\nfeeling I can relate to this this is\nlike you know this Misfit person and now\nlike they're going to this place and\nthey're being this amazing human being\nand and you know\nyour parents pressured you to [ __ ] be\nan engineer or whatever and and now\nyou've like you've transplanted\nliterally isekide yourself all the way\nover to [ __ ] Japan where you have an\nanime podcast and you found your people\nwhich are not normal people by the way\nright because the isakai world is like a\nmagical world where the normal human\nbeings like don't understand yeah\nI mean I mean yeah life is basically an\nisakai anime\nyeah\nqueer next time right I mean\nI Misfit to society goes and carves out\ntheir place making a job with a [ __ ]\nthe podcast called trash taste\noh [ __ ] how Normy is that right not\nnormally at all\nyeah thank you very much for saying it\nuh now I get like the Dr k pass you know\nthe dotske stamp of approval uh I can\nmake it I can now use that quote in my\nlife philosophy that's perfect\num yeah but going back to the anger\nthing right so you know I think there's\na reason you bring it up right right the\nreason that you bring it up is that I'm\nguessing that in your journey of\nself-improvement and self-reflection\nyou're noticing that there's kind of\nthis blind spot yeah that you're not\nfeeling angry that maybe you should be\nfeeling a little bit more angry and I I\nget the sense you're conflicted because\nthe other thing is that there's a very\nlogical part of you that's also like\nfeeling angry is bad is useless we\nshouldn't feel this way it doesn't help\nus much we didn't like the way that we\nlike the anger used to linger with us\nthere's like a lot of objective reasons\nwhy you don't want to be angry yeah then\nthere's this whole other [ __ ] about your\nmom is a saint and you're not allowed to\nbe angry at a saint right yeah right\nlike what I'm gonna get pissed at\nsomeone for taking the high road and\noffering forgiveness so there's even\nthis angle of like when you do feel\nanger you kind of like don't give\nyourself license to do it right right\nyeah that's that's a very good way to\nput it and and so I think there's a lot\nand that's very common so oftentimes\nwhen we suppress our anger\nlike I would guess that when you feel\nangry you probably feel guilty with it\nwhich oftentimes because they were like\nwhy am I angry I should I should be\nbetter than this\nthere's a lot of [ __ ] going on there\nwhich is really common with anger by the\nway so the first is that we learn early\non that anger is damaging and doesn't\nhelp us so we start to suppress it the\nsecond is that sometimes when we feel\nangry we feel guilty for it because\nwe'll get angry at people who don't\ndeserve anger\nso then we'll like suppress it even\nfurther and then you'll make these\nlogical arguments about how anger isn't\nhelpful there'll be some amount of\nconditioning and then you end up with\nthis blind spot of anger\nnow the reason it's a problem is because\njust because you're blind to it doesn't\nmean that it doesn't exist and what we\ntend to see in people who are blind to\ntheir anger and don't\nallow its space is that it like pops up\nin other areas that are like confusing\nto other people\nso you know I have no idea I'm not\nsaying this is the case but if we were\nto ask your wife whether you sometimes\nget passive aggressive right instead of\njust getting upset about something you\nlike make some [ __ ] logical argument\nthat is actually emotionally driven and\nthen it gets like very\nproblematic because the real problem is\nnot being vocalized or addressed because\nyou don't\nyou know you're not allowed to be upset\nbecause someone did something that was\ncompletely rational but like so then\nwhat the real challenge with anger is\nthat if you don't really acknowledge it\nor notice it\nit starts to pop up in other ways yeah\nand then you try to fix those problems\nbut those aren't actually the problem\nright the next thing is that if you\ndon't really get in touch with your\nanger sometimes people can take\nadvantage of you and you'll become a\nlittle bit of a doormat because anger is\na\nemotion that has evolved to protect our\nterritory that's really what anger is\nabout it's like when someone violates me\nlike the way that I coordinate my\nresponse is anger so I'm going to cut\noff ties with them because I'm not going\nto let them let me violate that I'm not\ngoing to let them violate me again going\nback to this stuff with your mom super\ncurious we're not going to get into it\nbut if you want to talk to a therapist\nabout it interesting to explore when she\nforgives someone do they end up hurting\nadditional people and what's that gonna\ndo that's gonna make you even more\npissed right right and then you get\nstuck in this kind of thing where every\ntime they forgive they become more of a\nsaint and you get more pissed but then\nlike you're not allowed to be it's\npissed at someone who's like such a\nsaint\nyeah I think you should get in touch\nwith your anger for what it's worth but\ndo it in your own time and Pace\nI mean you asked you said earlier uh if\nyou ask my wife do I get passive\naggressive\num I'm not really a passive aggressive\nperson if something is bothering me I\nkind of like just I'm I don't really\nhave any problems just\nnot really letting it out but just\nhaving like I would say more just like\naddressing it directly if that makes\nsense I don't get I don't really raise\nmy voice I don't really\nshow the outwards emotions of anger but\nI just talk I get I guess the best way I\nwould say is like the disappointed dad\nturn kind of like talk\num instead of instead of outwardly\nshowing anger or frustration it's it's\nmore of just like a\nlike hey this is really bothering me\nbecause you did this or you did this\nwith this person basically\nif that makes sense yeah I think it\nmakes a lot of sense I think I think\ndisappointed dad is a is a is a very\ncommon thing for anger to get\nright\ntransmuted into\nand and I I think that I mean I'm not\nsaying you should be pissed more but I\nmean you're asking is it a problem and\nI'm saying these are the problems that I\ntend to see I mean I I honestly I\nhonestly asked not not for like a yes or\nno answer\num I believe sessions like this I you\nknow I've really value sessions like\nthis uh because\nI get to learn something about myself\nand that's why I you know\nI think therapy is like definitely\nimportant even if you don't necessarily\nthink you have anything that's wrong\nwith you or anything like that I think\ngetting a better understanding of the\nperson you are\num helps you know helps a lot because it\nmight be easy to think that you\nunderstand yourself but even just today\ntalking to you I'm like oh yeah how did\nI like I I've discovered things about\nmyself that I think should have been\n[ __ ] obvious\nyeah so that that that word [ __ ]\nthere is anger okay\nuh\nright okay yeah I mean I I don't think\nit's obvious and it certainly isn't\n[ __ ] obvious it's actually really\nreally hard to get but yeah you know\nhere you are self-improvement Chad\nand this is the one time you beat\nyourself up\nright you can be like all for growth and\nself-reflection and looking back and\ngrowing and no but this is the one place\nthat you're judgmental towards yourself\nright right\nyeah how does it feel when I point it\nout\num\nwhen you pointed out\nthis is you know there's there's two\nthings one I'm happy I've learned\nsomething about myself two I'm\nfrustrated that uh I didn't see this\nearlier\num but it was you know it's not like I\nlike again it's like a very just light\nfrustration I'm just like uh I'm just\nyou know like I said earlier I'm just a\ndumbass yeah I I think your experience\nof it is light but I'm noticing actually\nlike this is the most emotionally\nuncomfortable I've seen you over the\nlast two hours and even when I pointed\nout to you it seems like you're still\nkind of beating like oh there it\nhappened again I missed it again I\nmissed it again this is the vibe that\nI'm getting from you now\nI feel like moments like these I mean\nyes I am I guess like emotionally\nuncomfortable\num but I feel like it's moments like\nthese that you know help me learn them\nand and help me I guess uh help me learn\nand help me understand myself and\nhelp me\ngive me more uh\nnot experienced\nknowledge no\ninsights give me more insights about the\nperson I am and the person that I want\nto be so yeah so so I would encourage\nyou to also experiment with being a\nlittle bit less positive\nokay like in situation like you know\nwhat I'm hearing is that you're you're\nmaking [ __ ] lemonade right left\nright you know and and like it's okay to\nI know it sounds kind of weird but\nit's okay for you to be angry\nand for you to like not grow from it\nyeah and not become a better person\nright because it\nyou know and on on the flip side it's\nlike it's like anger maybe for you is\nlike if you see Naruto\nyes I've seen Naruto yes like so it's\nlike cubi no chakra\nright so like that's what it is and it's\nsuppressed and it's trapped and whatever\nand and I think ultimately if you look\nat even things like flow States and\nstuff like that your Optimal Performance\nactually comes from emotional activation\nyou need emotional activation along with\nlike the cognitive centers of your brain\nlike working together to get into\nyeah your optimal mode of functioning\nand even when it comes to some of this\nstuff like feeling disconnected from\nhome and like because I'm hearing that\nsometimes you feel disconnected that's\nthat's the most common thing that you've\nhistorically felt I'm not getting a\nsense that's getting and I think that\nthat disconnection will continue as long\nas you're suppressing anger\nso you can't the brain unfortunately I\nmean sort of but when you kind of turn\ndown the volume you turn on volume on\neverything\nright and so I think going forward\ngetting in touch with your anger is\nprobably a good thing and I think you\nkind of realize that on some level and\nthe problem is that there's a lot of\nlike logical crap there that's like\nfloating around which is not wrong by\nall means improve and self-improve and\nstuff like that but sometimes it's okay\nto just be pissed\nand nothing comes out of it and it's not\ngood that is what my wife has been\ntrying to teach me\nyeah yeah I mean it's a journey yeah\nit's a journey uh and it means a lot\ncoming from you as well and uh yeah this\nthis has been very enlightening honestly\non a lot of different levels\num I probably got to go in about five\nlike five ten minutes because yeah I\nlike my family's house right now yeah so\nI think it's a great place to stop if\nyou're cool with it yeah yeah I you know\nI think if I bring up another topic\nthat's gonna turn into another half hour\nconversation yeah so yeah I'm\ncomfortable ending it here yeah so any\nkind
