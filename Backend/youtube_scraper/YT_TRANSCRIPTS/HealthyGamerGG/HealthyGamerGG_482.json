    "transcript": "the seed of addiction to Improvement\nstarts with conditional love\n[Music]\nthe majority of people that I've worked\nwith who struggle with this problem have\nparents who are very conditional with\ntheir love when we sort of think about\nparenting we kind of think like okay\nparents should give unconditional love\nright that's what raises healthy kids\nand what does unconditional love mean it\nmeans that I love you no matter what you\ndo so you can do well or you can do\npoorly and my love for you is the same\nit doesn't mean that we don't encourage\nyou to do well and we don't reward you\nto do well but that fundamental sense of\nLove is there no matter what but\noftentimes if you're kind of one of\nthese people who feels like I gotta do\nbetter I gotta do better I got to do\nbetter where did you get that idea you\ngot that idea from your parents who were\nconditional with the love that they\nprovided in the household that I grew up\nwhen I was nine years old my dad sort of\ntold me and my brother he was like one\nof you is going to be doctored and one\nof you is going to be lawyer and so I\nlearned at a very young age that my\nvalue as a human being depends on my\nperformance and whether I'm loved\nwhether I I'm a good kid or good little\nIndian boy or bad little Indian boy\ndepends on whether I get straight\nno girlfriend no fun you need to get\ngrades grades grades and so literally\nthe affection and love that I felt in my\nhousehold was somewhat conditional based\non my performance hey y'all I want to\ntake a moment to thank the sponsor of\ntoday's video Babel Babel is the top\nlanguage learning app worldwide and if\nyou're interested in learning a new\nlanguage I can't recommend them enough\nthere are a couple reasons why I really\nlove Babel the first is that it's built\nby actual language Educators so these\nare people who have a ton of experience\nin teaching people how to speak new\nlanguages the second reason that I\nreally like them is that their method is\nscientifically backed and they've been\nable to demonstrate that they can teach\nthe basics of a new language in as\nlittle as three weeks the third reason\nwhy I really love Babel is that it's\nvery easy to use and replaces the wasted\ntime in my day so instead of Doom\nscrolling I'm actually spending time\nlearning a new language so right now for\nexample I'm learning Spanish and I\nrecently learned how to say aprendo\nespanol which means I'm learning Spanish\nso what I love about the app is that\nit's really easy to use use so right now\nlet's say I logged in and I don't want\nto learn something new so I'm going to\ngo ahead and review and not only do I\nhave the option to review but then they\ngive me lots of choices so what I what\ndo I feel like doing right now I don't\nwant to do something very intensive but\nI want to do something kind of passive\nso I'm going to just take a look at some\nflash cards so that's what I really love\nabout the app is they make learning a\nlanguage really really easy and you can\nsqueeze it into different parts of your\nday it's very accessible so if you're\ninterested in learning a new language I\nstrongly recommend Babel if you use a\nlink in the description below you can\nget 60 off of your subscription which is\nan awesome deal and I'd like to thank\nthe sponsor of today's video Babel for\nhelping us keep mental health content on\nthe internet free if you grew up in a\nhousehold like that this may be\nresonating with you whether like you\nknow the affection that your parents\ngave you depended on how well you did at\nparticular things and if you did grow up\nin a household like that your mind\nconstructed a view of the world that my\nvalue as a human being depends on my\nperformance therefore if I am feeling\nbad about myself what do I need to do I\nneed to perform so that I can show\neveryone how good I am and now we move\non to a really important adaptation that\npeople who are addicted to\nself-improvement have which is that they\nuse external factors to solve internal\nproblems so we sort of know about this\nand this is actually a little bit more\ncommon in men is that sometimes when we\nfeel bad emotionally we will turn to an\nexternal thing to fix an internal\nemotional problem so if I'm addicted to\nlet's say like heroin or alcohol or\nmarijuana how do I fix that anxiety or\nfeeling bad about myself I turn to an\nexternal thing to make it feel better\nright I'm going to drink alcohol I'm\ngonna get high and I can do an external\naction to improve my internal state for\npeople who are addicted to\nself-improvement they just turn to a\ndifferent kind of action right I'm gonna\naccomplish something so if I feel\ninsecure and unlovable on the inside\nlike I don't really belong here I feel\nlike an imposter what am I going to do\nI'm going to do the best job that I I\npossibly can I'm going to rise to the\ntop and if I rise to the top then I will\nfeel Pride right people will respect me\npeople will love me people will like me\nand then this feeling of insecurity or\nlack of Love on the inside will go away\nbut that's not actually what happens\nright so if you're addicted to\nself-improvement you know this that even\nwhen you get a gold medal you're not\nlike chilling and happy right the first\nthing that you're thinking about is oh\nmy God who's going to beat me next year\nand even when there aren't competitions\nlike let's say for example like you do a\ngroup project or you pitch something to\nyour boss even if they say like hey\ngreat pitch in your mind what you're\nsort of thinking is like that person is\njust saying that I know I could have\ndone something better and then you go\nasking for feedback and you're like what\ncould I done better what could I have\ndone better and so what you sort of fall\ninto is the sort of idea where when you\nhave a negative emotion you're going to\nengage in an external Behavior to make\nthat negative emotion go away but\nthere's a fundamental problem with that\nwhich is that any kind of relief that\nyou get is temporary because\nfundamentally emotional problem problems\nrequire emotional Solutions so a good\nexample of this is people who are like\nafraid of being behind in like romantic\nsituations right if I'm like if I'm like\na virgin or whatever and I'm thinking to\nmyself oh I'm a loser like I feel bad\nabout myself because I'm a virgin that\nis a insecurity that I have internally\nand so how am I going to fix this I'm\ngoing to like you know sign up for some\nlike pickup artist course or whatever\nI'm gonna like become a chat or whatever\nand I'm gonna like do better in life\nright I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get\nlaid so I'm gonna fix this problem by\ngetting late but when I work with people\nwho are you know insecure about being\nvirgins and they will go get laid either\nsort of some meaningless kind of sex at\na party where everyone's drunk or in\nsome cases they'll even work with like a\nsex worker or a prostitute that doesn't\nactually fix the problem in their mind\nthey're sort of thinking like okay if I\nfix this thing on the outside it will\nmake me feel better on the inside and so\nthey go on fixing those external things\nthis is exactly what happens with people\nwho are addicted to self-improvement I\ndon't know where I'm going in life let\nme go to a spiritual Retreat where I\nwill fix that problem I don't know\nwhat's happening in my life I'm not\ngetting promoted or I don't feel like\nI'm a competent person or I feel like an\nimposter let me go work really hard so I\ncan get promoted and then the Imposter\nsyndrome will go away right on the\ncontrary The Imposter syndrome gets\nworse because now I've tricked these\npeople into promoting me I mean the\nImposter syndrome is like oh my God like\nnow I'm gonna screw it up and people are\ngonna realize they never should have\npromoted me in the first place it\ndoesn't work because emotional problems\nrequire emotional Solutions now there's\na caveat to this right or there's a\nCounterpoint which is that sometimes\nlet's say I feel unloved or I'm afraid\nof being a virgin or I have low\nself-esteem or ever and then I can get\ninto a relationship and sometimes that\ncan actually fix the problem right\nsometimes if I like find a boyfriend or\na girlfriend and like that can fix the\nproblem how's that the case well there's\na big difference between getting laid\nand entering into a relationship that is\nemotionally nurturing right so if you're\nactually in a relationship where sure\nyou're having sex but then this person\nalso gives you like an emotional\nantidote to your needs then that's a\ncompletely different story because\nemotional no problems require emotional\nSolutions and if I'm insecure about\nbeing a virgin it's not getting laid\nthat's going to fix it it's actually\nentering into a relationship where\nsomeone helps me feel loved and accepted\nand accepts me for being a virgin in the\nfirst place and this is the Trap that\npeople fall into is that we start to\nthink that external things will fix my\nemotions and we sort of also see that in\ncases of people who are very\nmaterialistic right they go on like\nbuying lots of stuff to make themselves\nfeel better or we see this even in the\ncases of toxic relationships where some\npeople that I've worked with and you may\nfall into this where like you will do\nanything that you can to get someone to\nlike you right and so you end up\nbecoming a doormat and putting up with a\nlot of abuse because you think that if\nyou can convince this person to like you\nthen you will feel loved but it doesn't\nwork like that and self-improvement\naddiction is even worse than any of\nthose other examples because\nself-improvement addiction does a couple\nof other things that are really\ndevastating the first is that it\nobjectively improves our life so think\nabout this right so if I'm so friggin\ninsecure that like I'm terrified that\nI'm gonna fail a test so what do I end\nup doing I torture myself with anxiety\nand I study really hard and then I get\nan A and then I wind up in medical\nschool and then I'm like oh my god I'm\nan imposter so I gotta work really hard\nbecause I don't deserve to be here and\nthen I do really well and I end up at\nthe top of my class and then I match to\na beautiful residency at some ivy league\ninstitution so if we really look at\nself-improvement addiction it's really\nreally scary because being addicted to\nself-improvement objectively correlates\nwith like better success in life and so\nwhen I work with these people what I end\nup discovering is if I were to ask you\nlike you know you're addicted to\nself-improvement is it a problem you say\nyes and then I ask you okay like despite\nall the fact that you've succeeded these\nfive times do you feel better about\nyourself as a human being and you're\nlike no and then I ask this question\nwhich is do you want to change and at\nthe beginning people will say yeah I'm\ntired of being unhappy but if we kind of\nlike go deeper into the conversation I'm\nlike do you want to change and then they\nend up saying no I don't want to change\nand why is that it's because my\naddiction to self-improvement gives me\ndirection in life it gives me fuel it\ngives me energy it allows me to\naccomplish stuff and so what these\npeople the reason they're so freaking\naddicted and the reason it's such a hard\naddiction to cake is because they don't\nwant to give it up and this is true of\nall addictions as well why are\naddictions hard to kick it's not because\nthey're harmful it's because they're\nhelpful if you're very successful and\nyou're addicted to self-improvement and\nwe take away your insecurity what's\ngoing to help you wake up in the morning\nwhy are you going to go to work how are\nyou going to decide what to gun for\nright so addiction to self-improvement\nwhen we have this insecurity it gives us\na sense of direction and it gives us\nenergy and we don't even want to give it\nup because if we lose our Direction and\nwe lose our fuel then like what are we\ndoing in life like how do I know what\nI'm going to be doing like I have no\ndirection I don't know what I'm supposed\nto be doing I'm going to be sitting at\nhome I'm going to be lazy I'm going to\nbecome the failure that I am afraid I've\nalways been so this is the huge problem\nis that people don't want to give up\ntheir addiction to self-improvement so\nhow do we fix this so the first thing\nthat we've got to understand once again\nis that emotional problems require\nemotional Solutions so the one concrete\nthing that I would recommend to everyone\nwho is addicted to self-improvement is\nstop looking outside yourself to fix\nthat kind of thing right so if you feel\ninsecure share it with someone else you\ncan talk to a therapist you can talk to\na coach you can talk to a boyfriend you\ncan talk to a girlfriend which is what\nwe're terrified to do right but here's\nthe problem is that right now the only\nthe reason you're in this mess is\nbecause when you feel insecure you go\nand try to fix it on the outside you\nnever actually like try to fix it\nemotionally so what I would strongly\nrecommend that you do is share that\nemotion with someone I know it sounds\ncrazy but that's literally all you gotta\ndo right so as you share that emotion\nsomething is going to happen the emotion\nwill start getting better you will start\nto realize okay I am loved like if you\ngo to your boyfriend or girlfriend or\nyour non-binary partner whatever you go\nto someone that you love and you share\nwith them hey like I'm afraid that I'm\nundeserving of your love and yeah it's\nreally challenging and yeah it's really\nvulnerable but that's when like you\ndon't need to do anything in that moment\nto earn their love if they really love\nyou they're gonna love you anyway and\nthen something very important will\nhappen holy crap if I feel unloved I\ndon't need to do anything to fix it I\ndon't need to do anything to deserve\nlove I'm deserving of love and this\nperson is giving me love anyway and\nthat's when there's a fundamental crack\nin the way that you view the world which\nis going to be where a lot of this\nhealing and growth comes from now some\nof y'all may be paranoid because I don't\nwant to do that because it's scary I get\nthat and how are you going to manage\nthat fear you're going to go take some\ncourse on managing fear and boosting\nyour EQ right oh I'm afraid I have to go\nfix that fear through something else Dr\nK tell me how to fix the fear I get that\nright so we're just gonna skirt past\nthat for a second and the next thing\nthat we really need to understand is\nthat a lot of people are paranoid about\nthis because if I no longer have the\nfear driving me then it's going to lead\nthe problems so right now I'm in this\nrelationship with a awesome person who\nis better than I am and I don't deserve\nto be in this relationship it is my fear\nof them abandoning me that causes me to\ngo the extra mile and become the Epic\npartner I'm a A plus partner because I'm\nafraid they're going to leave me right\nthat's how and that's why they stay\nbecause if you stop being an A plus\npartner then you would leave because\nyou're not fundamentally lovable this is\na cycle and so you try really hard you\nburn yourself out to make this person\nassure that this person never discovers\nwho you are and are you actually happy\nin that relationship absolutely not so\nstart by sharing your emotions because\nemotional problems require emotional\nSolutions and you'll start to feel\nbetter there's another problem that we\nhave to solve though is if you start\nfeeling better what we're doing is\ndraining your gas tank right because\nit's the fear or the insecurity that\ncauses you to progress in life\nobjectively and stay in this\nrelationship and that's where you'll\ndiscover something really cool which is\nthat once you're no longer living life\nto fix an insecurity that is when you\nstart to live life like for fun and\nexcitement so people who are addicted to\nself-improvement are going to live a\nlife of avoidance we're trying to avoid\nthis catastrophe constantly constantly\nconstantly and so your life is so\nstressful but thing is if I'm avoiding\nthat catastrophe I know like I've got\nDirection because I'm always running\naway from the fire right like where is\nthe fire we're going to run in the\nopposite direction and the fire keeps\nchasing us because that's what fire does\nright it doesn't just stop it just keeps\ncoming and so the fires run it keeps\ngrowing and growing and growing and I\nkeep running and running and running and\nat least I've got direction if the fire\nstops which direction do I go\nand this is what's beautiful is once you\nstop running from the fire you can start\nmoving towards stuff that actually\nexcites you so what I've noticed in that\nprobably well over a hundred people that\nI've worked with who are addicted to\nself-improvement is that they're\nterrified that they will no longer have\nDirection in life but actually the\ndirection in life that they find is\nexactly the direction in life that they\nwant which is I want to stop living a\nlife of fear and avoidance I want to\nstart living life where I move towards\njoy and excitement and the way to do\nthat is to stop running away from the\nfire right and as you start sort of\nhealing yourself emotionally then there\nis space in your mind for you to get\nexcited about stuff literally there are\nstudies on burnout that show that the\nfirst thing to go when you are burnt out\nis curiosity the brain does not have\ntime for curiosity or excitement or Joy\nwhen our ship is sinking and we're in\ndamage control so start by vocalizing\nyour emotions sharing them with someone\nelse give other people a chance to\naccept you without without you doing a\ngood job and the moment that starts to\nhappen your emotions will start to feel\nbetter you will start to feel a little\nbit healed you'll start to feel loved\nand you will create the space in your\nmind for things like curiosity or\nexcitement which will ultimately give\nyou a completely different Compass which\nis the compass that you've been looking\nfor this entire time which is I want to\nlive a life where I'm successful and\nit's filled with joy but you can't do\nthat as long as you're addicted to\nself-improvement\nforeign"
