    "transcript": "hello\nHi how are you\ngood how are you I'm doing well thank\nyou so much for uh talking today\nthank you for inviting\num well can you start by telling me what\nyou prefer to go by like what do you\nlike to be called\num Jenny Jenny is fine okay\nand um welcome Jenny is there anything\nin particular that you want to talk\nabout today\num\n[Music]\nsomething about streaming and the how\nstreaming is affecting my life I don't\nknow I'm not sure just streaming okay\nsure yeah I think streaming is great for\na lot of people and it also like affects\npeople's it shapes people's lives quite\na bit once you become a streamer\num and and so I'd love to talk to you\nabout that can you tell us a little bit\nabout how you also decided to become a\nstreamer and how you became a streamer\num I think how I became a streamer it's\nlike not too complicated it's just like\nmy brother was watching my brother was\nmore into live streaming and watching uh\nlive streamers and then I had no\num\nI I didn't watch stream live stream that\nmuch I only watched a little bit of like\nYouTube videos and\num my brother yeah my brother suggested\nlike you should become a streamer and I\nwas like oh okay that sounds like yeah\nso I was like okay this sounds\ninteresting so I just uh gave it a try\nand then that's how I started streaming\nand do you have a sense of what your\nbrother was thinking when he suggested\nthat you became a streamer like that's a\nyou know so I've never heard a sibling\nrecommend that\nand my brother knows that and then I\nstill played a lot of a lot of games so\nthat's the reason why my brother was\nlike yeah if you're gonna like play a\nlot of games how about like why don't\nyou just give it a try but I think also\nat the same time\num maybe I\nsaw some YouTube videos and I was\nthinking like I want to be a content\ncreator as well so deep inside I had\nthat feeling so that's the reason why my\nbrother recommended it I uh just decided\nto do it I think yeah yeah that's\nawesome what when you saw YouTube videos\nwhat\num what appealed to you about content\ncreation\nabout content creation yeah\num\nso when I was a kid\nthe dream was to become a producer like\nI wanted to create my own content or and\non TV but these days twitch.twitch like\nlive streaming platform this kind of\nstuff is like TV but having your own\nchannel so well\nI think that probably is something that\nwas kind of like appealing to me because\nI wanted to create my own content and\nthen uh provide audience with uh\nwhatever I'm thinking and then whatever\nI want to provide like yeah yeah okay so\nit sounds like you were thinking about\nmaking uh you know TV production from a\nyoung age\ndo you have a do you have a sense of\nwhat kind of what do you mean by kind of\num I mean as a kid I had a lot of\njust\ndessert but I wanted to either\nbecome a cartoonist like draw a cartoon\nor\nor TV producer or create a game so\nsomething related to like making\nsomething okay so yeah something\ncreative whether it was cartoons or and\nand so your brother suggested you become\na streamer and what were you kind of\nthinking that would be like\n[Music]\num\nI didn't really\nthink much like for example I definitely\ndidn't expect me to become an IRL travel\nstreamer at first I just wanted to\nbecome a game streamer\nbecause yeah like\nI don't know I I definitely didn't\nexpect me to be a travel streamer of\ncourse but um\nwhat was the question yeah I was just\ncurious what what you thought about\nsinging before you started but hey why\ndon't you tell us how did you become a\ntravel streamer\nyeah okay so that that's kind of um\nhow did I become a travel streamer so I\nused to be a PC streamer like first two\nyears I think first two years and then I\nstarted to have more Taiwanese viewers\nin the beginning and then I decided to\nuh travel to Taiwan and travel a little\nbit stream IRL and I really enjoyed it\nand also my viewers enjoyed it so I\ndecided to\ntry more traveling because I think in\ngeneral my audience liked IRL streaming\nmore and then\nI kept doing IRL because I want to do\nwhat my audience wants to watch kind of\nyeah okay\nand and so it it sounds like you're a\ntravel streamer because you like it but\nthey like it too\nexactly I mean I wouldn't be able to\ntravel like non-stop like this if I\ndidn't actually enjoy it because it's\nreally difficult to move around every\nfew days going outside\nlike in a cold weather or hot weather\nall right something like that so like\nit's very exhausting to basically\ncarrying bunch of like luggages and\nmoving around every two or three days so\nyeah that sounds like it\nsometimes it's\nI mean what what's that like carrying\nluggage or I mean how much stuff do you\nhave like what do you have to carry\naround if you're a travel streamer\num so I came around quite a lot I used\nto carry much more I had like seven bags\nor something but now I reduced it to\nstill like three three bags okay so I\nhad to carry around like my laptop\nstreaming gears and a lot of uh skincare\nproducts because I gotta use Korea\nskincare product I I gotta use this like\nspecific one and um so I had to like\norder a bunch and carry it around with\nme so so that I don't run out of it so\nthat's heavy and a little bit of clothes\nI think but that still is like really\nbig yeah I can imagine so that sounds\nquite tiring to travel all the time\ncarrying this stuff around\num how do you how do you manage that how\ndo you deal with that\num\nI think\nI just do it even though it's like super\ntiring sometimes and I'm like oh my God\nlike this is I'm exhausted but what\nchoice what other choice do I have I\njust gotta keep doing it so I think\nthat's the thing about me I don't really\ncare about my body or myself that much I\njust like put me in a situation where\nit's super exhausting for me and then I\njust keep persevere through it kind of\nstyle\nyeah\nwhat what do you so if you don't care\nabout or prioritize your health it\nsounds like or well-being what do you\nprioritize\num I think I prioritize my career\nI think yeah\nand uh I want to grow more as a streamer\nand a content creator and that is my\npriority at this moment because\nlike as if I get like when I get older\nit would be difficult for me to put this\nmuch effort into what I'm doing so while\nI can I am trying my best to just like\nput all the energy into it so\nyou know I can\ngo as far as I can while I'm in this\nfield yeah so I'm I'm noticing that\nyou're kind of thinking that maybe this\nopportunity is temporary and you kind of\nhave to make the most of it\nyeah because live streaming is not I\ndon't think it's I don't especially for\na female streamer I think I don't see it\nas a\nsuper long uh career that I can't like I\nmean I want to be travel streamer and\nlive streamer as long as I want I mean\nas long as possible but um I think it's\nlike kind of compared to other career\nother field I think it's kind of short\nlife span\nbecause\nI don't know it's changing a lot there\nare it's super competitive\nand uh\nyeah well maybe that's why what help me\nunderstand why especially you said like\na kind of as a female streamer why is\nwhy does that make it a short career\num\nbased on my observation past six years\nof being a streamer\nthink a majority of\naudience especially on Twitch is male\nand the because of that I think like for\nexample if you are male streamers are\nsuccessful I think you can stream for a\nlonger time for sure but if you're a\nfemale streamer and then if you\nI don't know like\nget it if you let's say if you you get\nmarried or you have kids or something\nthen I think even though like it's not\nlike viewers want to\ndate the streamer but still like if as a\nfemale streamer if you are if you are\nmarried and you have kids or something\nlike that I feel like it affects a lot\nmore to female streamer than male\nstreamers\nbased on my observation of like other\nstreamers so because of that I feel like\nin the future if I were to settle down\nand then get married and have kids I\nfeel like it would be kind of difficult\nto stream as much as I'm streaming right\nnow yeah I I can't I mean basically when\nyou when you travel around with bags\nthat sounds like traveling with kids\nlike when you've got kids yeah it's it's\na full-time job\nthere's a they have extra bags that come\nwith them\nand I can't imagine doing that like all\nthe time\nlike I just went on a vacation with my\nkids and for two weeks it was a ton I\nmean it was fun but it was also like a\nlittle exhausting\num yeah\nso with kids and live streaming it's\nprobably impossible it does sound pretty\nso it I mean that's something I'd not\nquite thought about but it sounds like\nreally if you want to move forward with\nyour personal life you kind of have to\nsacrifice your career like you can't do\nboth\num yeah for sure unless like I decided\nto become\ngaming streamers or something in the\nfuture I mean I could keep doing it but\nit wouldn't be as successful as right\nnow that's uh for sure\nbut um yeah yeah so it's like something\ngo ahead\nuh it's something that I have to accept\nlike in the in the in the end like in\nthe future if I want to like change what\nI'm doing and then decide to like settle\ndown and then play games only or you\nknow because I have personal stuff going\non then it would definitely affect uh\nwhat I've built so far okay\ncan I ask kind of like a random question\ncan you teach me a little bit about this\nKorean skin care\noh creative skincare\n[Music]\nbut um I just do uh so I apply serums so\nI remove makeup and wash my face apply\ncorner and serum and I do the mask pack\nand I fall asleep with it that that's\nthat much that's what you do there are\ntons of other people who yeah go ahead\noh I mean there were tons of other\npeople who do a lot more they have like\ndevices to like massage your face or\nsomething like that I have no time for\nthat\nand and what does all that stuff do\num\nmoisturizing skin\nuh protect skins from drying out and\nbasically have less uh wrinkles\nand and is your understanding that\nwrinkles is caused by dry skin\noh\nI think it's uh I mean I can see from my\nhand so for example I've been applying\ntons of serums and stuff ever since I\nwas young but I never cared about my\nhand and I think my face skin is a lot\nyounger than my hand and also I don't\nfly sunscreen too so it's like and\ntraveling all the time so I feel like\nskincare does really matter\nto put like to stay look young young\nokay and and so like there's there's\nserum there's toner there's a a mask of\nsome sort\nyeah like a moisturizing mask and and\nwhat does the serum do\nmoisturizes\nskins and then they have this good\nstuff inside that they say it's like\nreally good for skin and\nI apply it I don't really know but it's\njust like I do it and then I mean before\nI buy it I see reviews and it was like\nyeah this is really good and then I buy\nit and I use it and I guess it's it's\nmore like reduce it's not like reducing\nwrinkle it's more like maintaining\nmaintaining so preventing the formation\nof new wrinkles\nyes yes wow okay so I mean it sounds\nlike in some ways you take really good\ncare of yourself\num skin wise I mean I used to not care\nmuch so for example I would sleep\nwithout removing makeup because I'm way\ntoo tired\nuh but now I'm 31 so I decided to care\nbetter I mean I used to fall asleep\nwithout removing makeup almost every day\nlike last year and then I wake up in the\nmiddle of the night at 2 A.M and remove\nand then fall asleep again something\nlike that it happened so often yeah so\nit okay I thank you so much for\nexplaining that I know that like Korean\nskincare my wife uses the stuff too and\nthere's you know always packages coming\nfrom the internet\nand occasionally for like gifts and\nstuff I'll like go into some Korean\nskincare store and I'll just buy some\nrandom things I have no idea what works\nor what doesn't\num but she seems to like it\nand and so I'm I'm also kind of\nwondering like I guess dudes use this\nstuff too right\nstuff to take their take care of their\nskin whenever I say that to my chat\nthey're like oh yeah that's uh that's\ngirly that's too feminine I'm like it\nhas nothing to do with that it's just\nyou know taking care of your skin yeah\nabsolutely\nso kind of going back to the whole\ncareer thing so it sounds like you so\ntesting one two three okay\num so it sounds like you kind of push\nyourself pretty hard\nsorry yeah I think I was just saying so\nso it sounds like you push yourself\npretty hard\nyes I do push myself pretty hard\num\nfor some reason I think it's just like\nuh\nI don't know why I do that but um I just\nlove to do more challenging stuff all\nthe time\nand I feel like sort of satisfaction\nfrom doing it as well\ncan you tell me about that sorry\ncan you tell me about the satisfaction\ndo I have bad connection right now\none of us does oh oh sure\num\nyeah I think my internet is kind of\ncutting out a little bit\nso\num it's just like\nfor example when you're playing\ndifficult games like Dark Soul and then\nit's so difficult it's so frustrating\nwhile you're doing it you're so mad but\nonce you finish the boss once you kill\nthe boss you're just like oh yeah and\nthen the adrenaline that happiness it's\nkind of like that in life too like if so\nif I get something too easy I feel like\nI didn't earn it and then I I really\nwant to earn it but\neven though sometimes I try really hard\nthe result is not as good and then that\nhappens of course in life but um\nI think most of the time\nin my life if I tried really hard for\ncertain goals I have a\nchieved my goals and then from that I\nget like satisfaction so\nthat that's yeah so so would you say\nthat I mean so it sounds like you're\nchasing a lot of satisfaction\nlike that that's the reason you push\nyourself\noh that's part of it but um that\nsatisfaction comes from uh Career\nSuccess so for example if I tried really\nhard and Achieve something but um My\nStream didn't do well then I wouldn't be\nas satisfied and happy but uh if I did\nreally well\nMy Stream as I planned then I would feel\ngood\nokay more satisfied yeah of course so if\nyour stream does better right so if you\nwork really hard and you do a good job\nand your stream numbers are good or\nwhatever like then you feel more\nsatisfied\nand and how do you feel about the way\nyou're living your life right now\num it's great I think it's it's\ncomplicated okay so it's great but also\nat the same time it's hiring but also at\nthe same time it's very satisfying\nbut I am very thankful I'm trying to see\nI'm trying to be like more appreciative\nabout everything and like for example\ntraveling even though it it is\nexhausting sometimes like traveling\naround all the time but um I got to see\nand experience so many cool stuff and\nshare that experience with audience and\nthen I am trying to be very thankful for\nyou know\nthankful for that because not everyone\ncan do that like traveling around it or\nmoney and then you know so I'm trying to\nbe like\neven though sometimes it is difficult\nI'm trying to think like oh yeah like my\nwhat I'm what I have is like such great\nthings I should be always thankful for\nit kind of like that yeah yeah it sounds\nlike you have a lot to be grateful for\nand in some ways you're like incredibly\nlucky and your life sounds pretty\nawesome in some ways yes\nyes but in other ways it sounds rough\nit is tough yes because\nit's like like for example you\ntraveling is something that people like\ntake a vacation and then they go for a\nfew days or a few weeks and come back\nand then traveling itself is uh some\nlike it's not like vacation Sometimes\nsome people come to my chat and say like\nyou're always on vacation but it's not\nvacation every time I hear that I'm like\nI get so triggered because they have no\nidea how like exhausting it is it's not\nit's not like I just go travel somewhere\nand sit down and eat food and then stay\nat a beach or something like that it's\nnot like that I have to plan everything\ncheck the internet like with my mods and\nthen traveling back and forth all the\ntime and then when I go outside I always\ntry to like move around and then take\nChad as much as check take chat to\ndifferent places as much as possible\nalways walking always on the move and\nafter that it's super exhausting and\nthen doing that every single day is\ndefinitely not a vacation of course I'm\nvery grateful at all the time and then I\ntry to even though sometimes my body\nfeels tired I try to like be more\nthankful for it and then have more\npositive energy and then keep doing it\nand pushing myself to do it but it's\ndefinitely not like easy so I wouldn't\nsay it's\nsuper easy way but um of course Very\nfulfilling and I love uh traveling and\nstreaming yeah yeah so I I mean it it\nsounds like what\nis really what people don't understand\nis is like you said that it's not easy\nso I'm hearing that there's a lot to be\ngrateful for but you actually like pay a\npretty pretty high price\nyeah because I cannot spend any time\nwith the my family and my friends\nbecause a lot of my my family is in\nKorea so it's I see them what barely\nwhat one like few weeks a year\nthat's very little\nit sounds like my friends as well\nyeah\nI guess like when it comes to that kind\nof like stuff meeting family and friends\nin Korea or it's because I'm always\nmoving so it's difficult to\nspend time with the people that I care\nabout because that's that's the reason\nwhy like I flew my mom and grandma uh\nrecently for a little bit to travel in\nEurope and then I had like so much fun\nwith them\nand then they had so much fun because we\nbarely get to do stuff together every\nyear like so that is definitely a\nsacrifice that I have to make\num being a travel streamer\nyeah I think Jenny out of uh basically\nall the streamers I've talked to I I\nthink you kind of take the cake for it\nsounds like you don't actually get to\nhave a life outside of your job\num not so much no\nbut um I think streaming I I consider\nstreaming as part of like\na huge part of my life and something\nthat I have to mainly focus on\nuh at this moment when I have it I wanna\ndo it like do my best basically\nyeah I mean I I think you it sounds like\nyou made a lot of very intentional\ndecisions about\nbecause I I'm like here's what I'm\nhearing and I'm not I'm not trying you\nknow please let me know if I'm being\njudgmental or making things out to be\nworse I'm not trying to I'm just gonna\nrepeat back what I hear like so when I\nthink about like normal people\nyou know they have a job and then\noutside of their job they have their\nlife and for a lot of people the the\nchallenge is like okay how do I do less\nof my job so I can live my life more\nfor a lot of people they don't like\ntheir job\nnow you sound like someone who\nfor the large part like enjoys what you\ndo\nyou're grateful for what you do but I'm\nalso hearing that you you actually don't\nget to have a life outside of your job\nlike it sounds like your job consumes\nyou know basically 24 hours of your day\nlike most days a lot of times yes but um\nit's yeah\nuh I was pretty\nhow do I say\nit is true but\nfor now I think that I feel like I have\nto do it like that\nbecause\nwell in the future when I get old and\nthen because things always change and uh\nI don't know how long I will be you know\ndoing what I'm doing right now so\nas long as possible I'm gonna try my\nbest to\nyou know do what I'm doing trying yeah\nlike yeah so even though I\nyeah even though I have to make\nsacrifices I'm just thinking like okay\nso if I really work really hard at young\nage and uh later on uh when I I can\nspend more time with my family and my\nfriends\num in the future so I'm more like\nworking really hard right now and then\nI can spend more time with my friends\nand family in the future kind of person\nyeah I guess I don't know and\nI almost feel like uh\ncan I think for a second\nsorry can I think for a second\njust thinking I'm not lagged\nmm-hmm\nso it sounds to me like you're afraid to\nchange the way that you live your life\num afraid\nyeah I think\nI am\ndefinitely afraid of changes\nbut I also I think change is inevitable\nso\nwhile it's last let's try the best\nthat's kind of like mindset that I have\nand\nand how how are you how's your stream\ngoing\ngreat of course like all streams as\nwhole streamers have there's ups and\ndown but um\nuh I've had a pretty good year so far\nhad massive achievement in wattlethon\nwalked across the country like that kind\nof stuff and then right now I am having\na great time in the traveling around\nEurope sometimes like number wise\nsometimes it's like not as good of\ncourse but uh overall I'm pretty\nsatisfied\nI think it's retiring though because\nI've been moving around like every two\nor three days in Europe with it so yeah\nand what what does next year hold for\nyou\nnext hope next year what what's gonna\nhappen next year\num\ntry one more\nwalk across another country that is a\nlittle bit bigger than Taiwan\nmaybe and um\nprobably go around explore some other\nmore new countries but also at the same\ntime\nI think I want to try some bigger\nprojects as well not just traveling like\npast few years I just like did IRL and\ntraveling but next year I wanna\nfocus on more like projects that's not\nthat involves something more than\ntraveling for example\nI don't know I wanna\ncreate my own music songs and world do\nthe street concert with my own music as\nI travel around like that kind of stuff\nyeah so it sounds like you're going to\ndo more next year\nit's been like that yes yeah\nso I\nI I'm noticing like an internal desire\nto try to change your mind\nbut I don't think that's my place to try\nto change your mind so it's like I'm\nkind of feeling internally conflicted\nlike\nso you sound like you thought this\nthrough\nhuh\nyou sound like you thought this through\nand it sounds like you're super smart it\nsounds like you've collected a lot of\ndata it sounds like you figured out\nsomething that's working for you\nit sounds like you push yourself pretty\nhard it sounds like you have a lot to be\ngrateful for sounds like you're super\ntired and it sounds like you're gonna\nwalk like walkathon sounds tiring\nit is definitely tiring and next year\nyou're gonna walkathon more\nand\nif we're doing like Street concerts like\nthat means you gotta practice that means\nyou gotta have another bag that means\nmaybe two bags you know and and because\nthat that's what the job demands right\nbecause if you don't do more and you\ndon't do better and you don't do bigger\npeople start leaving\num\nthink\npart of it is kind of like\nme wanting to grow more and more and\nmore that's a that's a desire because I\nhave the desire and the ambition I am\neven though\nI don't have to I'm just trying to keep\nlike pushing myself to do more uh\ndefinitely because I'm definitely\nambitious person like very competitive\nand something like that\nbut also at the same time at some point\nI do have to accept like yeah you gotta\nstop\ndoing\nso like crazy stuff because\nlike I gotta start spending one time\nspending my time with the fem with\nfamily and friends and then I should\nstart to have more personal life and uh\nthe reason why even though I know I have\nto like rest more and then spend more\ntime on something else I feel like I get\nlike super anxious about like not doing\nit because\nit's like I've worked so hard to build\nwhat I have but it's so difficult to\nbuild but it's so easy to lose even\nthough I'm always trying\nI still lose you know\nso I gotta in order to be more\nsuccessful then I gotta do more stuff\nand because of that I am just like\nconstantly trying to think of new stuff\ntrying to do more stuff normally I guess\nkind of like that yeah what's it like to\nwork I mean because it does demand a lot\nright so consistency creativity\nhigh energy you can't be tired on stream\nright\nand yeah I mean I do say I'm tired on\nstream whenever I'm tired but I'm yeah\nit's still even though I'm tired I still\ngot to do what I plan to do that is true\nyeah\nand and it's so easy for things to fall\napart right like if you take a break\nlike what what happens have you taken a\nBreak\num\nI mean I do take like few days off when\nI'm tired like oh yeah I'm tired I'm\ngonna sleep more yeah I'm taking a day\noff today like today was my day off too\nbut um it's just like one day is not\nenough you know because\nuh but also at the same time I don't\nwant to take more of these off because\nif I take more days off I feel like I'm\nlike\num losing behind like what is that word\nfalling behind uh falling falling behind\nsomething like that yeah I mean it\nsounds like you're you have to run as\nfast as you can just to keep Pace like\neven if you're running as fast as you\ncan you're not really getting ahead\nyou're just\nyeah\nvery competitive\num build and people especially with the\ntrend of a lot of like\nI don't know trans everything is\nchanging so fast and people move on from\nDistrict streamer a to stream or B\ntraditional mercies they always move on\ndepending on what other streamers are\ndoing\nand uh yeah so because it's so\ncompetitive I gotta keep doing it and\nthen try to survive\nin this uh competitive field\nhow confident are you in some of your\nconclusions\nhow confident\nas in\nlike so you have these ideas right that\nlike if you take an extended break\nthings will get worse that you have to\ndo walk what waddle fun next year is\ngoing to be bigger\nlonger huh\nno I don't think it's going to be bigger\nbecause first little thing was like\nreally good and uh also it was in Taiwan\nand Taiwan\num\nviewers are\nwhenever it tends to be like that\nwhenever I'm in one country\num that country viewers like come and\nwatch all the time but then whenever I\nleave the country viewers and from the\ncountry students to live to like new\nviewers who came so Taiwan after\nwaddlestone I definitely have gotten\nmore time on his viewers that stayed of\ncourse but um a lot of them definitely\nleft as I left Taiwan too but um\nI think it it's very difficult to be as\nbig as Taiwan because Taiwanese viewers\nare very eager to uh they're very\npassionate uh people who love to watch\nwhat others\nstreamers like foreigners are doing in\ntheir own in their country and so it's\nnot for just it's not for me just for me\nbut also tons of other streamers when\nthey go to Taiwan they get like pretty\nbig boost because they I think they love\nto watch like other people doing and\nthey're doing something in their country\nyeah yeah\nI'm I'm just I'm not quite sure so first\nof all it's like it's not my place to\ntell you what to do with your life\nobviously but I'm just I I have some\nconcerns about what I'm hearing which is\nlike so you're kind of saying at some\npoint you got to slow down\nright but when when like how how do you\nknow when you're gonna slow down\nuh so I I have this vague idea what I\nwant to do in the future so\nwhen I hit 35 I think I'm gonna stop\ntraveling and then because I love\nanimals and then I love uh\nbasically I want to have a little bit of\nlike small form where I have uh\nI help animals rescue animals and live\nwith them taking care of them and then\nI want to do that\nuh and then make and then I can stream\nthat too so\nI wanna\nso it sounds like you've got kind of\nlike an end date in mind so you're gonna\ngive it four more years\noh well for the travel streaming\nI guess\num but um it could end early or it could\nlast longer nobody knows but um that is\nprobably the age that I feel like I kind\nof want to settle down\nin one place\nand when did you when did you come up\nwith that number\n35\num I don't know why I just said 35 but I\nmean well I don't know why I decided 35\nbut um when when did you decide 35 oh\nI don't know like last year\nokay\nyeah\ngood cheer because\nso\nI think after one or two years of always\nlike moving around\nI definitely got there there were times\nI got burnt out and then especially when\nfor example Transportation gets\nall messed up and then I have to like\nwait hours and hours for next\nTransportation or get something that\ngets delayed and then with tons of\nblockages I'm super tired when that kind\nof stuff happened I'm like okay this is\nuh\nI can only do this until like 35. let's\njust do it until 35 I think I had that\nkind of thinking starting from last year\nand then I feel like 35 is great age to\nkind of like settle down as well\nwhy is that\num\nI'm not sure uh because I feel like 40\nis too long\n31 32 33 34 is kind of like in the\nmiddle like why so 35 is like that age\nlike okay 35. so not not a big reason\njust sounds right\nyeah so so you know that that's what I\nit\nwhat do you what do you want to talk\nabout Ginny what how can I do I want to\ntalk about yeah like one like I I don't\nI like I said I I feel sort of this\nimpulse to\ncontradict some of the things that\nyou're saying like I I see some\npotential problems with like some of the\nway that\nsome of the ways you're thinking about\nstuff but it's like not my place right I\nmean sorry I I definitely have a lot of\nproblems in my what I'm thinking I that\nwhat I'm doing how I'm living my life is\ndefinitely not healthy\nand I I am aware of it\nbut also at the same time I'm like yeah\nokay but um that's what I want to do and\nthen in order to be more successful I\ngotta be work harder kind of like that\nbut it could be because I'm Asian and\nthe Asians especially in Korea like we\ntend to be like super competitive grow\nup in very very competitive background I\njust cannot relax I gotta keep doing it\nor else I'm gonna be like very anxious\nI'm very anxious about stuff\nit's very problematic very unhealthy and\nI think I am aware of it but also at the\nsame time I don't know like if I want to\nrelax because\nI'm afraid I'll get more anxious if I\nrelax\nyeah so I gotta figure out relax\nrelaxing without being so anxious but I\ndon't know how to do that yeah I mean\nthat sounds like some pretty bad\nlike if if relaxing makes you anxious\num\nyou know it's kind of like if eating\nmakes you hungry\nor like sleeping makes you tired\nlike uh-huh you know that sounds not\ngreat\nyeah it's not that good\nI think it's\npeople\nbut it has gotten better though because\nbefore it was a lot worse\nlike if uh if my life revolved around\nstreaming\nlike 90 before now it's like\n60 70 like I try to have more balance\nbetween uh having my own life and the\nstreaming I think at least that's what\nI'm trying to do\nhow's that working\num I think it's working pretty I think\nit's working better than before\nbecause\nthe problem with that\nmy life being completely revolving\naround streaming\nis uh when that when it was like that\nviewers there were audience like viewers\nwho were also very very deeply involved\nin\nmy life as well because I basically\nshare everything\nuh what's going on in my life and that's\nthe reason why\nthere were a lot of people who felt like\nwho felt like they were entitled to know\neverything and in the end when I didn't\nshare then there were a situation where\nthey got mad or something\nand then whenever that kind of uh\nboundaries between audience and me it\nbecame very blurry I decided like okay\nI'm gonna\nstart\nlike not sharing too much and then I'm\nnot gonna\nput my entire life\nlike show entire I'm not gonna like\nrevolve my life totally around streaming\nbecause I think that's unhealthy so I\ntry to like separate between streaming\nand\nuh not streaming like I try to separate\nbecause\nI felt like that's more healthy yes yeah\nI mean I think that boundary sounds very\nhealthy and then I think the other thing\nthat's really kind of subtle there is\nthat\nI think what you did there is carve out\nlife outside of streaming too that's\nwhat sounds really healthy to me\ncar about life out of\nyeah so it sounds like for a long and\neven today to a certain extent most of\nyour life is streaming\nbut the moment that you start blocking\nsome some stuff off a part of your life\nbecomes not streaming\nso for example when it was just about\nstreaming I I didn't spend time with\nlike my University friends\nbasically because I was too busy with\nstreaming and then even offstream I was\nalways on online on like Discord of my\ncommunity talking to them and it was\njust like all the time like that\nand uh\nnow whenever I'm not streaming I tend to\ntalk to people who's not believed to\nstream\nso that I don't have to talk about\nstreaming anymore I talk about other\nstuff like life or what they do or\nsomething like that and then\nI think I started doing this since last\nyear I hung out with my University\nfriends more\nand\nbasically talk about\nlife that is not streaming and I felt\ngreat like kind of like liberated\nfeeling it's because my life was just\nlike for years and years it was just\nabout streaming streaming streaming how\nto grow how to get more viewers even\nlike my friends were streamers so\nwhenever we talk we're like okay like\nhow to grow more like oh yeah streaming\nlive blah blah blah and whenever I was\nhanging out with my University friends I\nwas like yeah like oh yeah what do you\ndo these days oh I'm\nmaking this a games for this company oh\nyeah I'm playing golf as hobby oh yeah I\nwant I'm dating this girl these days\nlike kind of conversation that is not\nabout streaming I was like wow this\nfeels pretty good\nyou know kind of like feeling like\nhaving my life back a little bit from\nstreaming I mean don't get me wrong I\nlove streaming and then I love spending\ntime with my audience but also at the\nsame time I was too like to dip inside\nyeah almost to the point if I don't\nstream I feel like depressed and that is\nnot healthy obviously so how do you\nunderstand that\num\nbecause\nI had some times where\nwhen I was not streaming\nor\nwhatever\nit's just like I felt very\nunsettled like oh my God like what am I\ngonna do without streaming like oh I\ngotta I'm not streaming what are we\ngonna do or whatever even when I'm\ntaking a day off and relaxing I'm always\non like Discord or whatever trying to\nlike communicate\nand then it got very unhealthy at some\npoint because\nthere were definitely a lot of people\nwho were trying to\nsay\nsure like\nuh I don't know I just figured like it's\nnot too healthy like how I was sleeping\nso\nand then I felt pretty stressed and\nunhappy and depressed at certain points\nlike few years ago a year or two years\nago\nand\nI was like okay I should stop uh living\nlike this I should try to have more\nlife that is not about streaming this\nshould be healthier\nI think okay and and when you made more\nlife outside of streaming how did that\naffect your streaming\nI think it became a lot better because\nuh viewers tend to be less\nhow do I say\nuh\nuh I think there are used to be a lot of\npeople who would want to prove my\npersonal life but I don't have that\nanymore because I feel like I am they\nunderstand that I'm trying to have like\nokay streaming streaming and then\nnon-streaming non-streaming like you\nshould have and my viewers encouraged me\nto take more days off relax have your\nown life they do that and um\nbecause they know that that is healthy\nso\never since I started doing that I think\nit got a lot better I am happier when\nI'm streaming and uh yeah I think it's\nbeen better okay\ncan I um think for a second\nhow does this conversation feel to you\nso far\nlike um\nit's good it's good I like\nI like talking about\nuh this kind of stuff\nokay\nyeah\num\ncan I think for a second\nokay\ncan I just share what I'm sort of\nhearing in like a couple things I've\nlearned\num are you okay if I\nscreen share with you and like draw some\nstuff out\nsure okay\nso\nfirst of all Genie\nI think you're amazing like this is\nsuper cool it's like so cool to hear\nwhat your life is like what your journey\nis like\num\nI\nI really I really really think it's\ngreat\nI think you clearly have thought a lot\nabout what you want your life to be\num\nI think it sounds like you've made a lot\nof positive changes it sounds like\nyou've really succeeded as a streamer\nwhich is a very hard thing to do\nright it's hyper competitive it demands\nso much of you\nand and I'm also hearing like a lot of\nstuff that I kind of hear from people a\nlot which I I don't think is\nideal so like this is me placing a\njudgment\nbut it's not I'm not saying that it's\nright or wrong I'm just going to share\nwith you like a different perspective\nand this is having it so it sounds like\nyou're a Korean\nso you know having worked with a fair\nnumber of Korean people\num and it's not just Koreans that are\nlike this you know there are all kinds\nof people all over the world who are\nlike this and and what I'd like to do is\njust take a few minutes to kind of like\nmap out what I see is sort of like this\nis true of you but I mean I think it's\ntrue of a lot of people of like\nokay like I gotta work really hard\nif I relax I fall behind I have to run\nat top speed just to like not fall\nbehind like you're not gaining any\nground so you can't take breaks\nyou can't relax and you can't even do\nthe same amount of work like next year\nyou have to do more right you have to\nlike waddlethon again and now you need\nto add this and now you need to add this\nso there's like this constant tension\nbetween okay I gotta slow down I gotta\ncut back I gotta move from six bags to\nthree and then like next year we're\ngonna add a bag of Music stuff so\nthere's like this constant tension of\nlike I gotta cut back on stuff and I\ngotta do more\nand you're kind of like stuck in this\nway right like and you make progress but\nI mean and that's what's weird is but\nbut and then the other thing that tends\nto happen is is a lot of times people\nwill come up with some like arbitrary\nthing but they're like okay yeah I'm\ngonna slow down when I'm 35.\nright I'm gonna slow down at this like\narbitrary time and when you're 30 like\n35 like makes sense right because it's\nfar enough away to where you can grind\nfor like five years of your life\nso it's not like you have to actually\nlike slow down anytime soon because\nslowing down anytime soon is like scary\nright so we want to like push it far\naway but you also pick a number that\ndoesn't like\nscrew you you know like if you slow down\nat 35 you're like there's enough of life\nleft to live that you can enjoy\nwhereas if you like slow down when\nyou're 40 then it's like hard to have\nkids and then you're like kind of\ngetting older and like you know all this\nkind of stuff so that there's kind of\nnumbered it sounds like a really good\nnumber\nbut sometimes what I see is that when\npeople come up with this kind of\narbitrary number\nthe forces that keep them going today\nwill still be present when you're 34.\num right so like what drives you on a\nday-to-day basis I don't know is going\nto change over like 32 or 33 or 34. like\nif you do waddlethon next year and it\ndoes better\nthen it's good but you're also like kind\nof screwed because the lesson that you\nlearn is like okay if I like waddlethon\nlonger I will do better and I will grow\nand if I grow before like the the\ninternet gets bored of me\nand find someone else so like next year\nlike if I waddle Fawn more then like\nit'll grow even bigger\nright so like doing more leads to better\nresults which which is a fundamental\nassumption I want to challenge by the\nway but\nlike does that make sense like how am I\ndoing so far does this feel like we're\non the right track or off or does it\nfeel judgmental am I like overstepping\nno no no I'm I'm listening\num and it sounds about right yes\nso let's like take a look at this and\nand I'm gonna kind of try to map a\ncouple things out and then all I'd\nreally like to do is just encourage you\nto like think about a couple of things\nand really think about some of the\nassumptions and some of the ways that\nyou kind of make decisions\nI'm not saying you're doing anything\nwrong I'm not saying that you can even\ndo anything better you know it sounds\nlike you're doing a fantastic job it\nsounds like you're practicing gratitude\nit sounds like you're taking more time\noff it sounds like you've taken you've\nstarted to set more boundaries sounds\nlike your content is actually doing\nbetter that people like the stuff that\nyou're doing more that you're\ncultivating a healthy Community I'm\nhearing win after win after win after\nwin after win after win after win\nis that fair\nhopefully yeah I mean would you agree\nwith everything that I just said or was\nI like wrong with that\nI don't think you were wrong I mean of\ncourse there are it's not always win\nthere's definitely lose sometimes I\ncannot win all the time and\num how does it feel to not want to win\nall the time\num I mean I'm fine with it I think like\nbecause that's life I cannot win all the\ntime I mean before I struggle with it\nI'm like why am I not you know getting\nbetter when I'm trying so hard like it's\nso unfair it used to be like that but\nI'm like you know it's um it happens and\nuh\nyou just gotta accept and then move on\ntry to do better next time sure so okay\nhere is ginny\nand Ginny is a good\nKorean girl\nright yeah which means that Ginny wants\nto be successful\nyep and being successful involves\nworking hard\nright\nsacrificing\nJenny is also well aware that\nhard work is not enough to be successful\nin your field that the internet\ngets bored\nvery easily very easily which means that\nif Jenny wants to be successful\nshe doesn't know like when the internet\nis gonna get bored and move on to\nsomeone else\nwhich means that like if you want like\nthe the window for Success that you have\nis limited\nright\nand then what that means is that\nyou won't be able to grind later so you\ngotta grind now\nright now because who knows\nand\nand there's all kinds of other resilient\ncoping stuff that Ginny does\nso she learns to practice gratitude\nright you're being grateful you're\nsetting boundaries\nso it sounds like you're making actually\nlike a lot of progress in a lot of ways\nyou were even more exhausted I mean you\nwere carrying around six suitcases or\nseven suitcases and now it's only three\nyeah\nyeah but there's a couple of basic\nproblems okay so this is the first one\nthe internet gets bored right so your\nyour window is limited the second is\nthat\num\nyou gotta grow\nin order\nto not die\nright\nso you got to run whatever you do this\nyear you got to do more\nnext year\nright yeah\nso like you're gonna need to like and\nand how out of zero to a hundred percent\nhow much are you giving right now\num I guess pretty\nlike 90 I guess this year or so far uh\nbeen going around\nso many different places not just the\nwattle thumb but also like chasing tons\nof events\nthat I find it fun\neven after one of them people thought I\nwould like take quite a long times off\nbut I didn't I was always moving two to\nevery two days three days it sounds to\nme like you're giving a hundred percent\ncould you ever give a hundred percent\nhave you ever given 100 Jenny or is 100\ntheoretical\nunderpresented theoretical I'm not\nreally sure what exactly is 100\nright okay so so which means that like\nyou could be giving 100 and you wouldn't\neven realize it\n100 would be kind of like this so I am\nnot just trying to grow twitch I'm also\ntrying to grow like YouTube and Tick\nTock and other stuff and then I'm always\nthinking like okay I'm gonna make more\ncontent for YouTube and Tick Tock as\nwell but I'm like spending so much time\non Twitch so I don't really have time\nand then 100 would be okay after\nstreaming I'm making more content for\nYouTube and Tick Tock and posting there\ntoo so but that's not physically\npossible or mentally possible right so\nthis is my point\nit is possible so for for example if I\nso this is there are a few things I do\noff stream to relax like I play some\ngames I watch Netflix just laying down\nwatch some shorts like and\num if I instead of doing that instead of\nwatching other people's shorts if I make\nmy own shorts instead of playing games\nif I\nput more time in creating videos for\nYouTube and Tick Tock then I could do\nthat that's like 100 but it's not having\nmy own time so I'm like you know what I\nstream hard I I deserve some like free\ntime so I like so 100 is perfect right\nthis is being perfect\nit's perfect in work sure but not yeah\nyeah very healthy\nso but I mean this and that's what I'm\nsaying is like practically having worked\nwith human beings you're a human being\nI guess I know it's gonna sound kind of\nweird and this is exactly what I'm\ntalking about I think you're basically\ngiven 100 I don't think you've got a\nwhole lot left to give\nuh like sure in theory like if you were\na perfect human being with infinite\namounts of energy you could be growing\nother platforms simultaneously but like\nyou're a human right and the human body\ngets tired\nunfortunately like the human body\nsometimes like needs to talk to friends\nand sometimes like needs to see family\nand and sometimes needs to not take off\ntheir makeup before the human body\npasses out\nyeah like so if we consider that the\nhuman body is a imperfect instrument\nand we don't have to go like too much\nback and forth on this but like I think\nyou're given way closer to a hundred\npercent than you are to 90 percent\nyeah maybe it has always that's why I'm\nalways thinking oh it'll be so good if I\nhad like two bodies you know right so so\nokay so let's just think about that for\na second right so if you're at the point\nwhere improving substantially involves\nadding a second body maybe we're close\nto maxing out our first body\nright like\nyou know like if we have to like\nduplicate yourself in order to be more\nefficient maybe we're like topping out\non what you're capable of\nyeah right so like like sounds about\nright so if you duplicate yourself then\nyou could go to 200 but if you're like\nmoving to two that means we're pretty\nclose like we're like we're at 99.\nyou know I I think practically like I\nthink if you worked\n10 hours more a week like I don't think\nyou could take it\num\nwhat do you think about that\nif I work 10 hours more I mean yeah that\nwould be pretty uh difficult\nright and yeah\nanyway I mean like we can go back and\nforth I'm just going to kind of point\nthis out and encourage you to sort of\nthink about\nhow much you're really giving and that\nlike I know that from a theoretical\nperspective and is a good Korean girl\nunless you're perfect you can do better\nright\nbecause that's that's what I mean being\nIndian in some ways is very similar\nwhere unless you're perfect you can do\nbetter\num\nand okay so this is kind of like your\nsituation right so then I think another\nthing to really consider is emotions\nso there are a couple of other things\nthat I've heard one is that satisfaction\nis really important to you\nbut what makes you feel satisfied\num\nit's very difficult because I don't\nreally get satisfied enough like for\nexample\nlike even when I feel like even when a\nlot of people say yeah you have a pretty\ngood stream but I'm I feel like I have\nvery high standard or something I'm like\nyeah I don't know it wasn't like as good\nI'm always not happy about something\nabout my stream even though I tried hard\nlike something could have been better or\nsomething I think I tend to focus on\nwhat could have been better than what\nwas good\nso\nthat's the reason why\nI\ndon't feel that satisfied with my\nstreams pretty often\nokay so where does satisfaction come\nfrom\num\nI don't know okay very good so now we're\ngetting to like the stuff that I want\nyou to think about right so you said\nthat satisfaction is very important to\nyou it sounds like good outcomes\nplus effort\nsometimes leads to satisfaction\nbut now we're running into kind of like\na tricky thing which is that we don't\nreally know where satisfaction comes\nfrom and it seems like sometimes even\ndoing a good job doesn't make you feel\nsatisfied but feeling satisfied is very\nimportant to you\nit is so it's I think it's just outcome\nand result uh so if the result is good\nthen I am satisfied if the result is bad\nthen even though I try really hard I\nwouldn't be as satisfied so there are a\nlot of very unpredictable uh because for\nexample I am not doing as I'm not\nputting as much effort on stream on that\nday but then result is so much better\nthan the other day that I tried harder\nwe're gonna get to effort and reward in\nstream in a few minutes okay but and so\nhere's my question to you uh um\nso\nyou don't know what satisfies you right\num like\noh you said results yeah result yeah\nokay so let me ask you something\nwhat kind of result satisfies you\nfor now because I am focusing on\nstreaming and\ncontent creating that kind of stuff so\nif I have good numbers or how do you\ndefine good numbers\nuh like better than usual yeah\nnumber and uh\nwhat do you think about that\nuh it's very unhealthy why and I think\nbecause okay so number is something that\nis totally not controllable like so it\ndepends it relies on so many different\nstuff and\num\nit's very difficult to predict how if\nthe number is going to be good number is\ngoing to be bad or something like that\nso\nI don't think it really completely\nrelates to how hard I try because there\nwill be days like Genie better than\nusual right better than usual\nso like this is a huge problem what's\nthe problem\nah\nwhat's the problem the problem is that\nlike no amount of satisfaction is gonna\nbe anything near permanent it's always\ngoing to be temporary and you got to do\nbetter it's better than usual so if you\npull in let's say 10K viewers a day\nthen your satisfaction requires 11k and\nif it requires 11k then when you turn\nwhen you're like 34 and six months and\nyou're pulling in like 80 000 viewers a\nday\nand then you're going to look at\nyourself and you're going to be like oh\nno I dropped down to 78 and you're going\nto be unsatisfied\nokay the the thing is so\nso uh uh talk to chat about this too I\nthink so\nI want to have\nlike 10K viewer stable Stapleton if I\nwere to have 10K stable viewers If I\nGrow that much then if I drop from let's\nsay someday I got 15K viewers and then I\ndropped to 11k the other day I wouldn't\nbe like I don't think how did you come\nup with the five the 10K number\nI was doing a lot of fun uh that Taiwan\npeople boost was like hipping me at 10K\nlike a lot of time for two months or\nsomething so I'm like okay if I if I\nhave reached a few times then I have\npotential to reach that\npart I mean that point I just gotta try\nreally hard and then grow\nand then try to maintain that number\nit's super difficult but I've been\ntrying to do that like since years and\nthere's always up and down of course but\num so this is what tends to happen as\nhuman beings we take our best\nperformance and we shoot for a target\nfor that is our Baseline\nright um\nso I think it is like very high\nand then I I plan to like achieve it by\ndoing harder and more more work\nright you're going to clone yourself\nI called my heart I'm gonna call myself\nand then if I've reached that point like\nif I reach that point once I reached\nthat point the stable 10K is in like for\nexample\nthere is no such I don't think there is\na such thing as stable 10K but um at\nleast like going around like up and down\naround that area I would still be\nsatisfied\nwhat if that becomes usual\ninstead becomes usual then\nI would be like you mean stable 10K is\nthe usual then I'll be happy yay so\nthat's what I'm concerned about is I'm\nconcerned that generally speaking what\nleads you to satisfaction is doing\nbetter than usual\nright so if 10K becomes usual you may\nmove the target\num\num I felt that when I was in when I was\ndoing 10 in Taiwan I've I think I've\neven reached like 20K or something but\nthen that was like starting boost and\nthen it stabilized then they stayed\naround like 10K to like 13k later on\nlike something like that foreign was\nthere a time that you would have been\nhappy with stable 5K\nI mean I was happy so okay this is kind\nof I don't think I've ever shared this\nuh um so I am always have goals and I\nwhenever I start to decide to do\nsomething I always write down in my\nnotes I've been doing that ever since I\nwas kid I was right down on my Note\nwhat's my goal for doing this what's my\ngoal for doing that and then even when I\nfirst started streaming I had this note\nof writing down the number like cool\nokay so after starting one year of\nstreaming I want to reach at least 1 000\nviewers after like two years I want to\nreach at least like this much of it I\nhad like this goal writing down like\nokay and in order to achieve it I have\nto do this this maybe I could try this\nthis this like you know I had this uh\nnote that I write down about what I want\nto do and then my plans and my goals and\neverything and uh my goal definitely\nhappened uh way faster than I planned\nand then I was very happy and\nwhat happened afterwards was okay so I\nachieved now I gotta maintain and then I\nwas maintaining I was doing good and I\nuh got more viewers at some point\nenriched sometimes like 10K even\nand then\nand then I think a few years I was going\nup and down like from four to five to\nseven to 10K to like four to five k\nagain like it has been like that all the\ntime and then I decided to have like oh\nyeah I wanna have stable tanker viewers\nafter I mean since like 2021 I think\nbecause before then I was just\nmaintaining the correct number that I\nwas having but then after reaching 10K a\nfew times I'm like okay you know what I\nwant to have like stable thinking of\nyours that's my goal so I made as my\ngoal now so I'm like trying to achieve\nuh that goal and\num type of person who's like okay I made\nthe school so I'm just gonna try\nmy best and then push myself hard until\nI reach that goal it was just like super\ndifficult yeah so what happens when you\nreach your first goal\nare you satisfied\nyeah when I first reached my goal uh I\nwas like oh oh not when your first reach\nyour goal okay sure but then what\nhappens\na month later\num months later I was more like focusing\non maintaining and then trying to grow\nmore but that wasn't the end goal so for\nexample I wanted to grow like okay 1K to\n2K to 3K blah blah blah but um 10K was\nafter like four years five years\nstreaming I realized okay having stable\nnumber of viewership is very difficult\nand I would not be more greedy\nand then I would not be like\ndoing crazy stuff as I am doing right\nnow once I reach that goal I've kind of\nlike\nmade a promise with myself like okay I'm\nnot gonna be super uh\nI'm not gonna try to bigger goals than\nthat like for example 10K is different\nfrom the other goals\nkind of you're you're promising yourself\nthat you're not gonna ask more of\nyourself\nkind of yeah yes because I know I'm\nasking and a lot how good are you at\nkeeping promises to yourself\nI think\npretty good maybe I'm not really sure\nokay is this something that you've done\noften\nor do you rarely make promises to\nyourself like this I mean I I make\npromises to myself all the time though\nbut um it is difficult to\nkeep it\nall the time as well for example\nwhen I have bad habits and then I'm like\nokay after this I'm not gonna do it but\nthen another day I'm doing it kind of\nokay yeah so this time it was also kind\nof uh\nbut\nI think whenever I was doing Taiwan\num uh waddlethon and then getting that\nhigh viewership\nI\nwas\nnot super\nlike stressed or not set unsatisfied\nfrom number being dropped from let's get\n15 to 10K I don't think I was like\nunsatisfied with it so I feel like I can\nkeep that promise like once I reach that\n10K stable I'll be like satisfied more\nbut even right now I am satisfied with\nwhat I have I mean\nhaving like four to five k viewers\nwhen I'm like you know just traveling\naround and chilling not really doing\nsomething super crazy or super special I\nstill have like that many viewers and\nthen and that's a lot already so I am\nhappy\nuh streaming and then I don't get\nstressed because I didn't hit 6K today\nor 7K today I don't know okay hold on\nhold on hold on hold on so this is like\nthis is really interesting right because\nyou said earlier that better than usual\nis what leads to satisfaction but now\nyou're telling me that you're not\nunsatisfied with a drop from 15K to 10K\nand that you're actually satisfied with\nfour to five k and you're kind of\nchilling\nso\nit's kind of like this\nof course I am not satisfied with the\nnumber itself sure\nbut before I was more like oh my God I'm\nsad because of like this if it wasn't\nlike that before now I am like okay even\nthough it wasn't as good as I thought it\nwould be you still had this many people\nwatching you that is already like pretty\ngood job and the I should be more\nthankful so I have I have changed my uh\nmindset\nbefore I was more negative about like\nnumbers and I was more stressed about it\nnow I'm like okay you could have done\nbetter sure yeah right so so I think\nthat's really important because\nunderstanding that so what I'm hearing\nis that your satisfaction comes from\nyour mindset not your numbers\num\nit's how do I say Okay so\nlet's say\nthe number was not\nto my satisfaction like okay so Jimmy\nso I understand that when I say\nsomething like that your answer is like\nyes but\nthe numbers are still important it\nreally depends on the numbers\nright no I don't\nknow right so that's what we're gonna\nget into okay so my point is that like\nif we look at satisfaction it's like\nactually kind of weird and complicated\nright like sometimes it kind of depends\non the numbers and you have a lot of\nlike really good rational reasons for\nthe goals that you want but if we look\nat the emotion of satisfaction\nwe've got to be kind of careful because\nsometimes that satisfaction does come\nfrom the numbers like when your numbers\nare better than usual you're going to\nfeel great no matter what right\nbut there are other times where you've\ndiscovered that your satisfaction\nif we were to say this is the\nsatisfaction bucket maybe somewhere over\nhere this is numbers\nand this is mindset\nand your satisfaction used to be like\nthis where it's mostly numbers\nand recently like you moved the mindset\nthing over here\nso that now it's like more mindset and\nless numbers right you can be satisfied\nwith four to five k concurrence if\nyou're kind of chilling you're kind of\nvibe and you're having a good time\nthat's it's kind of like this if I start\nto be more satisfied with\nah okay I'm saying this it's like kind\nof unhealthy but also at the same time I\nthe reason why can I give it a shot\nso if you start getting satisfied with\nfour to five k and you stop striving\nthen you're like that's you're doomed\nyou don't want to be satisfied with four\nto five k that sounds like a terrible\nstrategy\nuh-huh right\nit's like\nso it's like this\nI I am not\nI mean I am going to keep trying hard\nto provide with good content and then\ntry to grow and then I'm gonna keep\npushing myself hard\nbut\nwhenever I couldn't whenever I didn't\nget the result that I wanted instead of\nfeeling sad or upset I should be\nthankful so that is stuff so it's not\nreally ah I'm satisfied with four to\nfive k number it's not like that\nbut it's like okay I still have a lot of\npeople watching me and enjoyed my stream\nso I should be thankful about that\nyeah so you're doing something weird so\nlet's let's oh yeah right so so what you\ndo is you feel unsatisfied\nand then you gratitude your way out of\nit\nright you say I shouldn't feel this way\ninstead I'm gonna be choose to be\ngrateful which is healthy\nbut do you see that that's what you're\ndoing\nI think so I think it's better than\nfeeling upset than that oh man why\ndidn't I do better right yeah it's\nbetter than but but let's acknowledge\nthat you feel upset and unsatisfied and\nthen you manage those emotions through\ndeveloping gratitude\nbut um\nthat because I didn't do better than\nusual I just feel like oh well today was\na little worse than I thought well I\nguess I'll try harder next time but why\nwhy do you feel upset\nI mean I don't think I feel upset\nbecause I didn't do whatever\nI just feel like oh yeah well\nI guess I'll do better next time or\nsomething like that right so if you say\nI'll do better next time\nwho are you talking to like does that\nmake sense\nwho am I talking to you're like talking\nto yourself right\nyou're consoling yourself\nuh\nI guess yes\nright so\nyou don't need to console yourself like\nyou console people who are feeling hurt\nor disappointed in some way right\nso\nyeah let me let me just finish a couple\nthings and then maybe we'll be able to\npiece it together maybe it'll I mean I'm\nnot saying I'm right here it's just\nsomething for you to think about so a\ncouple of other things so sometimes I\nthink you experience fear\nright uh-huh sometimes you get anxious\nwhen you relax and it sounds like you're\ndoing a lot better with this\nuh-huh\nokay\nso and that's tricky right so if you\nstart to like relax a little bit you\nstart to worry about am I going to hit\nmy targets how much time do I have left\nyou know I need to be growing otherwise\nI'm like things are going to be\nshrinking and someone else will show up\nright and so then like this pushes you\nand the other interesting thing is that\nif you're growing right and you hit 10K\nstable\nthen you you can you have ammo to fight\nthe fear and anxiety because if you've\ngot 10K stable you don't need to be\nafraid\num right so 10K stable also gives you\nsecurity\n[Music]\nI mean tell me if I'm wrong\nsecurity\num I mean but to be honest I know like\neven after I witch think there's no such\nthing as stable 10K like it will because\neven that maintaining a big uh super\ndifficult so you're telling me that even\nwith stable 10K there's still fear\noh yeah of course like I think everybody\nwill have such fear like like for\nexample unless you're like really top of\nthe top and then no matter what you do\nyou'll always get like high numbers\nunless you're kind of like that point I\nthink every streamer always will have a\nlittle bit of a this insecurity with the\nnumber and then even when you reach the\npoint where you're always getting 10K\nyou I mean you cannot maintain that\nforever so jitty this is the thing okay\nI'm gonna stop screen sharing with you\nokay\nso here's the crazy thing so this is\nlike what I'm trying to work my way to\nso you're right right so even the\nbiggest streamers don't feel secure\nat big numbers\nso my whole point to you is that the way\nyou feel\nand your performance\nare completely independent\nyeah so this is what we've done so like\nnow I've got data to back this up at\nthis point we've worked with 400 content\ncreators\nand what we tend to see in 12 weeks is\nan increase of viewership or sub count\nby a hundred and seventy one percent at\n12 weeks\nwithout increasing the amount of work\nthey do by a single hour\nright so people will like see huge\nimprovements in numbers and this is like\nbig big streamers we're talking like\neven people who pull in 30k plus\nconcurrence or people who pull in like\n30k I mean 30. 30 and 30k across the\nSpectrum but more people on the smaller\nend\nand so like here's the wild thing right\nso like what I'm hearing from you is\nthat a lot like so I think goals is good\nmoving towards things is good but what\nI'm noticing is that\nyour emotional state gets tangled up\nwith your goals so the way that you\nmanage your fear\nis to do better\nright so it's like if I can do better\nthen my fear will improve but now I'm so\nso then it's like okay if you get 10K\nstable like what's you get some security\nright so okay like now I've made it and\nyou're telling me that that's your\nspecial number that's not like any of\nthe other goals but then if I ask you\nwill that like satisfy you you're kind\nof like well maybe the answer to\neverything is like well maybe\nright\nand that's not you're not wrong you're\nactually very right this is the point\nany time your mind says well maybe that\nmeans that there's something there to be\nunderstood we need to tease it apart and\nunderstand what are the variables in the\nequation\nbecause what I'm actually hearing from\nyou is that\nsetting more boundaries carving out more\nof a life\nis increasing your satisfaction and\nimproving your numbers\nthat sacrificing less and spending some\ntime with your family doesn't seem to be\noverall negatively hurting your\ntrajectory\nbut it's probably because I am even\nthough I am\ntrying to have more of my life I am\ndefinitely not doing that much like for\nexample after two months of battle fun I\nstayed in Korea for two days\nspend time with my fan friends one day\nimmediately left for Europe with my mom\nand grandma\nso and so that's actually still like\nthat is more spending time with friends\nand family than before sure but still\ndefinitely not enough to\npart\nmy numbers are so how how much time\nhurts your numbers\nwell can't really tell though because\nthere are a little situations\nhold on hold on hold on hold on a second\njust listen to yourself because you're\nsaying okay like the reason it didn't\nhurt my numbers is because I only spent\ntwo days\nright it's very vague fear so I don't\nknow so I could take a month off and\ncome back I could so what determines how\nmuch time so you don't know what amount\nof time is going to hurt your numbers\nright objectively you don't know that\nwhat determines how much time you spend\nwith your family\nwhat determines how do you decide to\nspend two days\num I mean it was just like of course the\nplan and schedule and then uh some of\nthe stuff that I had to do so I I only I\nBailey I mean I only had two days\nbecause I had like other upcoming\nschedule that I made so that's the\nreason why what drove that schedule how\ndid that schedule get made that way\num\ncame like two months and because it was\nharder than I thought so\nI already had like some sponsorship on\nthat week that I had to do in Europe so\nI had to be in Europe in order to keep\nthat you know\nyeah\num yeah something like that so\nokay\nso\nwhat\nthis is silly question so there's like\nno way that you could have adjusted that\nschedule right\nuh\nI mean\nmy schedule always changes so it's\nreally hard to predict so what\ndetermines whether how you're what's the\ndriving force behind your schedule like\nwhat what's the anchor\ndriving force\nhow would it feel to to if things got\ndelayed right\nand let's say like how would it feel to\nhave not\ncap to the next thing\nor cut back on on watathon\noh\num I mean what do you mean by cut back\non models I I don't know so you said\nlike it got delayed right so like\nanytime there's a cut\nbecause that's the thing you don't make\nCuts right stuff gets added to your\nschedule but nothing gets taken off\num I mean so\nlonger things get added and\nyeah I keep adding stuff does anything\never get cut\nfeel like\nI feel like I got like\nmaybe some stuff like some stuff that I\npromised to do uh with chat that I've\nnot been doing so some stuff that I feel\nlike how does it feel to cut things from\nyour schedule\nI mean if it's like\nyour stuff I would not\nlike for example\nI was like I'm doing this challenge\nwalking across the country let's do it\noh I'm so tired you know what I'm gonna\nstop here I would never do that\nright\nyeah but um if it's just like okay guys\nI'm gonna finish this game\nbut so what I'm saying is like I think\nit's like unthinkable\nto cut something like that right like\nyou could never like cut something big\noh yeah\nnever\nlike why not\nI will just I will I will be\ndisappointed in myself and also my\nviewers will be like wow\nwow\num like\nyou know my viewers will also be\ndisappointed I feel like like for\nexample I I made this like huge\nchallenge okay let's do this and then\nall of a sudden I'm like you know what\nI'm not gonna do it then that make uh\nthey create it creates this precedent\nlike oh okay Jenny will kind of give up\nif if it finds like you know\ndifficult or something I don't want to\nhave that uh\nI don't think I want to have that yet\nyeah right so so like what I'm hearing\nis is that that would feel very is it\nokay that I'm asking you this stuff\nyou sure\nyeah yeah okay\nso like here's kind of what I'm noticing\nand just something for you to think\nabout so a couple of things is that so I\ndon't think you're doing anything wrong\nand I'm sorry am I making sense is this\nokay are you feeling like we're\ndisconnected\nno no no I think you're interpreting uh\nwhat I'm\npredictions like I think that's life\nlike that's what I'm feeling I'm very\nvery contradicted all the time I'm like\nI want to rest but also at the same time\nI gotta work sometimes I just want to\nrelax it's fine but also at the same\ntime no I gotta keep doing it I'm always\ncontradicted my feelings my emotions all\nthe time it's kind of like and I think\nwe're hearing that in this conversation\nright so like when when you tell me\nsomething and I repeat it back to you\nwhat do you say\nlike you'll like contradict it so I'll\nsay like okay what leads to satisfaction\nyou're like results above the norm\nand then I'll be like okay tell me when\nyou've been satisfied and you're like\nwell I was a four to five k concurrence\nand I was satisfied and I dropped then\nand I was satisfied and I was like oh\nokay so it's not this thing right and\nyou're like no no no but it is that\nthing because this\nso this is this is I think what is so\n[ __ ] confusing about your life and\nwhy I think it's hard in a lot of ways\nthis is why you do things\nthat you regret\nand then you don't learn your lesson\nright because when you're really really\nexhausted you'll say to yourself you'll\npromise yourself right like no I need to\ntake more breaks and then you wake up\nthe next day you're like [ __ ] the break\nyeah\nright waddlethon was delayed and it was\nexhausting and should we do it again\nwell in a slightly larger country\nbecause it needs to be bigger and better\nand how much do you have left to give\nare you at a hundred percent well you\ndon't think it's a hundred percent\nbecause no Korean in the history of\nhumanity has ever done 100 effort except\nfor your neighbor's kid who's at the top\nof their class and you should be more\nlike them\nyeah right but I've never it's it's\neveryone else thinks that other Korean\nkids are doing 100 percent\nthat's what 100 looks like that kid down\nthe street but not you\nso this conflict I I think the reason\nyou're so conflicted is because I think\nthere's a lot more emotion here than you\nrealize and the one thing I would\nencourage you to really think about is\nthat your performance as a streamer is\nindependent of your emotional state\nand similarly your emotional state or\nyour satisfaction with your streaming\ncareer is independent of your\nperformance\nwhich is weird it's very contradictory\nI've tried to work with Korean Esports\nteams who have never like I've just done\nworked with them for weeks and this is\nsomething that we've just agreed to\ndisagree and they just never see it my\nway I'm not saying my way is right I\nnever understand their way that's an\nequally good way of putting it at this\npoint I've got some data behind it so\nwhat I and I think you've even you're\ndiscovering this like through your raw\nneed for surviving this [ __ ] thing\nthat you're doing which is like really\nreally awesome and also takes so much\nout of you\nis that you've got to set boundaries but\nif I had asked Jenny two years ago can\nyou set boundaries around your personal\nlife and your professional life you'd\nhave said no\nright the viewers come to see everything\nthat I am and if I try to show if I\nclose anything off people will get upset\nand they will leave\nmaybe yeah\nso I I hear a lot of moving goal posts\nI hear that fear\nis a big part and that's normal I'm not\nsaying that this is like a problem this\nis true of all streamers and this is\nwhat I'm saying like even working with\npeople who are 30k 40K 50k 60k\nconcurrence or whatever like they a lot\nof them well some of them struggle with\nit and some of them don't the difference\nis that the ones who don't struggle with\nthat didn't struggle with it at 2K or 5K\nor 10K either\nthat you can plan to do better right\nlike you can plan good content I don't\nknow if this kind of makes sense but you\ncan work on a project and it you can\nplan it really well and it can do really\nwell but you don't need to be afraid or\nsatisfied to have that content do well\nlike the planning of the content and\nfiguring out how to increase your\nconcurrence how to like stream more\neffectively how to give your audience\nthere's all that process is absolutely\nthere but that doesn't need to be\ntangled up with your internal emotional\nstate\nor your satisfaction or your sense of\nself-worth\nand I think the reason that you're\nconflicted is because those two things\nget tied together\nand the hope the whole point about\nconflict is that there's like two parts\nof you because depending on what your\ninternal emotional state is that'll be\nwhich direction you move on a given day\nis that what are you hearing\n[Music]\nso yeah so you're saying uh streaming\nnumber and career that that and then my\nemotional feeling what I'm feeling\nshould be it's like separated like\nindependent it shouldn't be involved\nwhat so I think right now uh\none is actually dictating quite a bit of\nthe other\nand I think that as you have started to\nset boundaries between those two things\nthe better you've been doing\nso I think it sounds like you're doing\nbetter objectively and you said you had\na conversation with some school friends\nabout things that are not like related\nto streaming and it felt liberating\nso you can get that Liberation without\nhurting your numbers and the biggest\nproblem that most streamers make is they\nthink that these two things are tied\nsince you've had to sacrifice so much to\nget here you assume that since sacrifice\nhas caused you to grow you assume that\nit is sacrifice that will continue to\ngrow\nwhereas the big Revelation that we've\nhad and I think this is what you would\nalso agree with because most consumers\nagree with this is that when you're\nactually like not tired and exhausted\nand you feel pretty good about yourself\nyour your streams are actually like\nhigher energy more enjoyable and you\nactually do like better in the numbers\nthat sacrificing and being tired all the\ntime\nlike there's that fear driver that if I\nstop doing this then people will slip\naway but that's the big Paradox is that\nactually being well rested will bring\nmore people in\nbut the problem is that that fear that\nif I take a break like everyone will\ndisappear\nI I I don't and I'm not saying that you\nknow if you take extended breaks and\nlike consistency is important so there's\nabsolutely like a big part of like\nconsistency is a huge part and taking\nbreaks extended breaks is very damaging\nfor streaming and even if some people\nare able to successfully do it those\npeople are outliers\nthe majority of streamers need to stream\nconsistently in order to keep their\nnumbers or grow that's absolutely true\nanyway\nso what I'm what I'm encouraging you to\ndo is more than anything else think a\nlittle bit about what satisfies you what\nreally satisfies you that you can strive\nto grow and you can strive to be better\nand you can strive to do more ambitious\nthings and grow your numbers that's\nfantastic go for it girl\nbut your happiness or value or sense of\nsatisfaction does not have to be so tied\nup into that\nmm-hmm\nyeah\nI mean I think I should find the more\nsatisfaction from\nlike something that is not related to\nstreaming I think I should like\nfind satisfaction in some other stuff in\norder to be more healthy because number\nis such a I don't know it's very very\ndifficult\nto get satisfied from yeah so I I\nnoticed that you're like very very like\nI mean this is what this is the other\nchallenge is that in order to become as\nsuccessful a streamer as you are you\nhave to think this way\nso this is the really weird thing about\nlike if we look at success\ngrinding gets you to like the top 10\npercent\nbut then what happens is like\n90 percent of people in the top 10\npercent start to burn out and the people\nwho go to the top one percent are the\nones that develop some degree of like\nwork-life balance\nactually that's not true I want it to be\ntrue but I think it's true enough it can\nbe true let me put it that way\nbut I know a lot of people who are the\ntop one percent who just never develop\nwork-life balance and they just\nsacrifice more and more and more and\nmore\nand really burn out\nbut I know plenty of people there or\nI've worked with plenty enough of those\npeople to help them develop balance and\nthey don't lose anything\nI think you're already like on this\njourney right it sounds like you've\ndeveloped a lot of balance and actually\nyour like content is doing better as a\nresult\nso\nI think I I mean I I've definitely\ndeveloped a healthier uh life uh\nlifestyle from separating streaming and\nthen having more like personal life I\nthink I've definitely\ndeveloped healthier style of streaming\nbecause before it was definitely not\nhealthy and then there were a lot of\nviewers who were just like\nvery very uh\nthey just love to know everything but um\nI don't think I\nit's a lot less and then I think a lot\nof people in my community respect that\nnow so I feel more you know\ncomfortable that's a really good point\nso I think one thing Jenny this isn't\ntrue just of you but so if you look at\nhuman relationships\nwhat you give people\nis what they're gonna want\nso we see this a lot with like streamers\nand parasocial relationships but this is\ntrue of like everyday relationships too\nthat you know\nif you give people complete access to\nyour life that's what they're going to\ncome to expect and they'll start to get\nreally really upset if you ever try to\ntake that away\nbut this is also true of like our\neveryday relationships where I know so\nmany people who will allow others to\nviolate their boundaries\nright I'll let someone else because I'm\nafraid that they'll leave right because\nyou don't want your viewers to leave in\nan everyday life we don't want our\nboyfriend to leave we don't want our\ngirlfriend to leave we don't want our\nbrothers or siblings or friends to leave\nI will tolerate their bad behavior and\nonce I start tolerating their bad\nbehavior\nthen they will expect me to tolerate it\nand then I get stuck in this really\nreally interesting trap which is if I\never tell them no they start to leave\nand this was the very thing that I was\nafraid of to begin with\nand now all of my fears are coming true\nby setting boundaries but the really\ntricky thing is that this is a problem\nof my own creation when I tolerated it\nin the first place when I set a\nparticular standard then people become\nentitled to violating my boundaries and\nthe whole reason I let them do that in\nthe first place is because I'm afraid of\nthem leaving and so it becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy which is why\npeople get stuck\nbut what I'm seeing from you is that you\nstarted to set some boundaries it sounds\nlike maybe some people got upset but\nthen the cool thing is that there's like\nplenty of people out there who will\nrespect them anyway and show up mm-hmm\nyeah yeah I'm like I got so sick of\nthose people who are just like you know\ntrying to be\nlike gaslighting me into like saying\nuh my personal like tell everything\neverything about my personal life or\nelse I'm like a bad person like there\nare definitely a lot of people like I'm\nlike okay [ __ ] that [ __ ] I'm I'm gonna\nban all these people I don't need those\npeople so um I was like yeah I don't\ncare if I lose these people like in the\nin the long run like not having these\npeople is so much healthier so\nyeah I've definitely\nlike made boundaries like that yeah\nthat's awesome\num anyway we've been at it for a couple\nof hours so anything that you want to\nask or anything that you want to talk\nabout before we kind of wrap up I hope I\ndidn't push like I hope I wasn't too\npreachy with what I was sharing with you\nno I think it uh gave me more clears out\nof view of uh like why I'm so conflicted\nand then like always like you know I'm\ncomplicated but um it definitely cleared\nup um\nmy perspective for sure because I was\nmore I was pretty confused like\num but um I should definitely try to\nfind satisfaction in other stuff more\nand then you know separate between like\nnumbers and satisfaction that kind of\nstuff because I don't think I'll ever be\nable to get satisfaction from numbers\nitself so yeah yeah which is crazy\nbecause that's what you're chasing right\nso like I know and even your memory of\nlike what which numbers what your\nnumbers were at particular points is\nlike it's crazy like you remember so\nmany details\nlike it's it's interesting so\nyeah I mean I I I think that the other\nkind of basic problem that I see a lot\nof people run into is that when your\nemotional fulfillment comes from your\ncareer\nthen\nyour emotional well-being depends on\nyour career and then you depend on your\ncareer your life depends on your career\nand so I think what you're saying is\nactually like a really simple and\nbeautiful way of just like the more that\nyou separate your career from the rest\nof your life and the more you start to\ncultivate other dimensions of your life\nyou will get derived emotional\nsatisfaction from that and then you will\nno longer need your career to give you\nthat emotional satisfaction because\nyou're getting it elsewhere which sounds\nlike a very very very healthy step for\nanyone\nso I love the way that you put that I\nthink it's\ngreat\nthank you\ndefinitely cleared up\nthe perspective\nyeah thank you so much any um you want\nto just tell us where we can find you\nbefore we oh uh\nand currently I am in Croatia going\nalong the coastline yeah yeah it sounded\nlike you were I I watched a little bit\nof your last stream it looked pretty\nepic crochet is great it was really\npretty anyway yeah so you're working\nyour way down the coast that's awesome\nwell enjoy that and thank you so much\nfor coming today and it's gotta be super\nlate for you it's like midnight or\nsomething\num yeah one one a.m so good night and\nrest stop\nthank you take care\nforeign"
