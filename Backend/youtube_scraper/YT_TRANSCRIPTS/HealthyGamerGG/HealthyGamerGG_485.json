    "transcript": "so the big irony is when you start\nlosing your mind you were afraid that if\nyou go to a therapist you will confirm\nthat you have lost your mind because who\ngoes to therapists people who are crazy\nyeah which is just unfortunate that's\nthe stigma like you know you're losing\nyour mind you don't want to be losing\nyour mind crazy people go to therapy and\nthe big irony is that when you go to\ntherapy what you discover is that you're\nactually sane yeah you've been saying\nall along yep it's bad but you wouldn't\nknow that until you go there and you're\nresistant to go there because you don't\nwant to admit it and oh sorry it's\nreally bizarre but I I've never heard it\nphrased that way but it's beautiful that\nthat therapy is actually where you\ndiscover how sane you are not when you\ndiscover how crazy you are and the big\nirony the really sad thing is that\npeople feel crazy but they're actually\nway more sane yeah like you know it's\nlike mentally like the stuff going on\nthere you need to unpack it's like going\nto your doctor ultimately you know you\njust need to go to the doctor to try and\nwork some of it out you know"
