    "transcript": "even in real life if you're just not a\ncontent creator and someone criticizes\nyou or sends you some super long text\nyou're going to be thinking about the\ncontext that they're ignoring that's\nkind of like I think you should be\ncareful with it it can be useful to look\nat I think it's really important to\nthink about what are the goals of the\nperson who is doing the criticism I\nthink there's also a couple of like\nreally important Concepts that we can\nlearn to better tolerate criticism the\nfirst is the removal of the ego when I\nlook at criticism the more ego I have\nhave the harder it is to handle and the\nless I learn from it but even from an\negoless State it's pretty easy to\nactually tell that this is not a fair\nshake and then you can actually dismiss\nit more easily so you can like look at\nsomething right and you can recognize\nthat this person is injecting their or\ntheir projecting their view of you into\nlike their criticism so people will make\na lot of assumptions about what you do\nor what you don't do and so like the\nmore that you're able to kind of be\negist I think the better it is to handle"
