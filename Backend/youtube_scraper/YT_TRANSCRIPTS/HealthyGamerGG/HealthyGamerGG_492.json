    "transcript": "so there's a really fascinating story\nwith Buddha which is that he was like on\nthe verge of death so he had like\nbecause people will say like fasting\nwill help you attain higher states of\nmeditation there's some good scientific\nevidence of that and so he starved\nhimself to the point of death and so he\nwas like stick thin and a young girl\nwalks by with like a pail of rice\npudding and she sees that clearly\nthere's like this you know monk or\nsomething who like really looks like\nhe's in bad shape his skin is Gray he's\nall skin and bones and she's like do you\nwant some rice pudding and he's like\nthinking about it and he's like you know\nwhat yeah I do I've been on the brink of\ndeath none of this [ __ ] is working I've\nbeen studying I've been trying to become\nenlightened for so long it's all a scam\nand he gets frustrated he has the rice\npudding it's the most delicious thing\nhe's tasted and then he goes and he sits\nunder the tree and he's like [ __ ] it I'm\ndone with Enlightenment I'm done with\nmeditation and he just sits there and\nenjoys the rice pudding and that's when\nhe becomes enlightened so it's kind of\nbizarre but even the desire for\nenlightenment is a desire that will keep\nyou from Enlightenment and the last\nthing you have to give up is the desire\nit's kind of weird yeah"
