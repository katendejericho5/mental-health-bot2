    "transcript": "what is an unhealthy mind the most\nunhealthy mind is when thoughts are\nreality so if we talk about people who\nare an acute psychosis these people are\ndelusional they're hallucinating these\nthoughts are by definition not real but\nthey believe they are real so the\ndistance between thoughts and reality is\nvery small for people who are actively\npsychotic then what happens is we start\nto get into something like anxiety you\nknow they're not 100 real you come back\nevery now and then you realize I'm just\nin my bed and it's 2 A.M right but\nyou're attached to your thoughts you\ncan't let them go so even if you look at\nthe Neuroscience of anxiety what happens\nis when our amygdala is active potential\nthings feel more real which is survival\nit's adaptive so when I think about like\nokay if I see a snake I don't think\nabout the danger of the snake is\nhypothetical it's not a hypothetical\ndanger when I see the snake my brain is\nlike oh that danger is real we\ngotta treat it as if the danger is real\neven though I haven't been hurt but I am\ntreating a hypothetical possibility as a\nreality yeah"
