    "transcript": "when we sleep our brain does two major\nthings the first thing that it does is\nsomething called memory consolidation so\nas we start learning stuff throughout\nthe day it actually fills up something\ncalled our short-term memory and stuff\nin our short-term memory gets\nConsolidated into our long-term memory\nthrough this part of our brain called\nthe hippocampus while we sleep so this\nfunction of memory consolidation happens\nwhile we sleep and you can sort of think\nabout this as like let's say I'm working\non like a paper or something let's say\nI'm writing a paper I'm drawing\nsomething on the computer so right now\nthis information is stored in my\ncomputer's Ram but in order to store it\nto the hard drive I have to like save it\nright and once it's stored to the hard\ndrive I can close it and I can recall it\nbut if it gets wiped from my Ram before\nI ever save it then I'll sort of lose\nthe information and if we kind of think\nabout what happens in our brain when we\nsleep when it comes to memory that's the\ntime in which our brain learns"
