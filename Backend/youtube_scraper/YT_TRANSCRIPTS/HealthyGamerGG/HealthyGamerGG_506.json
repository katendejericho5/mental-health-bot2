    "transcript": "I think one of the biggest mistakes we\nmake in society is thinking that some\nemotions are good and some emotions are\nbad and so oftentimes the what holds\npeople back is they run away from their\nnegative emotions yeah you even said\nlike hey like how do I I have this guilt\nand you talk to me like it's a problem\nthat you want to fix whereas like my\nhonest answer to you is like don't ever\nfix your guilt that's a part of you it's\nsomething that you're going to live with\nfor the rest of your life it's just like\nany other emotion it's like having a\ntick or having like a kind of a knee\nthat acts up it's just a part of the way\nthat you're built and the more that\nyou're able to accept the guilt and not\ntry to change it the less you will\nsuffer from it 100 and and as as I\nrelease into it the information\ncontained within is beyond what I\nunderstood so it's it unlocks oh my gosh\nI see where this came from or why this\nfilter what this activated the shame\nthat this activated in me and you had an\ninteresting quote at the end of our\nconversation which was only way for\npeople to emotionally manipulate you is\nif when an emotion you have is tied to a\nbehavior"
