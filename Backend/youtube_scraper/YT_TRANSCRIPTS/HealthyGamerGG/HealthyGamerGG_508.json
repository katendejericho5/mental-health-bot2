    "transcript": "one thing that I've sort of found is\nwhen people are really really angry at\nSociety they don't really realize that\nanger doesn't actually come from society\nthank you it comes from their\nexperiences so oh gosh for example the\nnumber one I've worked with a ton of\npeople who are in cells or red pillars\nor whatever and the number one thing\nthat is common amongst all of them is\ntrauma usually associated with a woman\nyes so something just incredibly\ntraumatic and crushing happened to them\nand so then what they have to do is it's\nsort of like it's a survival mechanism\ntheir brain adapts to fear and even hate\nthat thing right like if I get bit by a\nsnake I'm not going to want to cuddle\nwith snakes yeah and I and then I think\nthey really fall into traps because as\nyou start to like intellectualize and\nyou point at Society instead of like\nunderstanding your own bias and what\neffect it has had on you then you really\nstart to screw things up because if the\nproblem exists within you like no amount\nof changing Society is going to fix it\nyes"
