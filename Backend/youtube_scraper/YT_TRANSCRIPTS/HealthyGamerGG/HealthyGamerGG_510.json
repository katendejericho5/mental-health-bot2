    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why\nsetting healthy boundaries is idiotic\nand oftentimes does not work\n[Music]\nnow I know this sounds kind of crazy\nbecause everyone out there is like set\nhealthy boundaries man like you got to\nlearn how to set your boundaries you got\nto keep your boundaries and like people\nlike you have to you have to hold the\nline and then people will respect you\nand I used to believe that too right as\na psychiatrist I've been taught how to\nset healthy boundaries with my patients\nand then I would teach my patients how\nto set healthy boundaries with people in\ntheir life and that worked some of the\ntime but some of the time it really\ndoesn't work and I'd almost say that for\nthe majority of people like that's not\nan effective strategy because at the end\nof the day setting healthy boundaries\nonly works if you have power if you can\nimpose consequences on someone else for\nviolating your boundary then you can set\na boundary but there's a ton of people\nthat I worked with that are like\nteenagers with abusive parents or\nsiblings that have older siblings that\nare like stronger than them or\nfinancially dependent on like other\npeople or people in romantic\nrelationships where there's like one\npartner who has all the power or in work\nsituations where someone's like you you\ncan't set a healthy boundary with your\nboss when they can fire your ass or\nwrite you up right so this is like a\nbasic problem that a lot of us\nprofessionals like medical professionals\nand psychiatrists and therapists we all\nlike drink this Kool-Aid of setting\nhealthy boundaries but there's a\nfundamental problem like I'm a model\nminority man with a medical degree which\nmeans that I can set boundaries on\n[ __ ] like right and left and it's\ngonna work because I have a lot of\ninherent power but a lot of the people\nthat I work with don't have power so\nwhen they try to use the strategy that I\nuse it's kind of like you know if you're\na nuclear power with the largest\nmilitary in the world and you develop a\nforeign policy you can't be some like\ntiny ass country that adopts the same\nforeign policy and it works there's a\ncompletely different strategy if you are\nweak and today we're going to talk about\nthat we're going to teach you all a\nlittle bit about narcissists because a\nlot of this boundary violating crap\ncomes from narcissists we're going to\nteach y'all how to manage your own\nemotions and we're going to teach y'all\nwhat to do how to kind of get what you\nwant and effectively do the same thing\nas setting healthy boundaries without\nsetting healthy boundaries right we're\ngoing to teach y'all almost like how to\nmanipulate narcissists into leaving you\nalone and to help you kind of do what\nyou want okay hey y'all I want to take a\nmoment to thank the sponsor of today's\nvideo nordpass in today's Digital World\nsecurity is of utmost importance but the\nmore tools we use online the more logins\nwe have to generate the more passwords\nwe have to remember and it can become\nreally burdensome that's where Norton\npass steps in I love Nord pass because\nit centralizes all of your logins and\npasswords and makes it very easy for you\nto access them what I really love about\nnordpass are their Advanced tools so\nthey have secure password generators\nwhich will generate strong passwords for\nyou and also keep track of them and they\nalso have a password Health Checker\nwhich can audit your existing passwords\nand tell you which ones you need to\nreplace another feature that I really\nreally like about nordpass is it helps\nus work as a team so if you think about\nthis increasingly digital world and\nremote work sometimes what we need to do\nas teams is share passwords so it makes\nthe process of onboarding new people\nbecause they can get access to\nparticular accounts that are stored in\nnordpass really really easy the best\nthing is that if someone leaves or\nsomeone needs to be terminated you can\nalso revoke their access super easily so\nI really love nordpass because it helps\nremove that cognitive burden of keeping\ntrack of all these passwords without\ncompromising security so if y'all are\ninterested check out nordpass.com\nhealthygamer GG for a free three-month\ntrial now let's start with this the\nfirst thing that you got to do is be\nweak and I know it sounds kind of weird\nbecause everyone's like oh my God you\nshould be strong so let's run through\nwhat actually happens when you try to be\nstrong so if there's a power Dynamic\nwhere your parents are like you know\nthey've got all the power and you're\nlike a teenager living at home and\nyou're like I'm gonna be strong and\nI'mma set boundaries and if you try to\nbe strong with a narcissist if you've\ngot some kind of conflict let's say with\nsomeone who's narcissistic and you're\ngonna strongly represent your Viewpoint\nright and you're like hey buddy you are\ntreating me in a bad way and\nyou're gonna like you're gonna like you\nknow you're gonna\nand then what do they do they get pissed\noff right so if they're narcissists what\nthey're gonna do is like if you tell\nthem that they are doing something wrong\nthat is gonna activate their\nnarcissistic defense mechanisms they're\ngonna get pissed off at you and they're\ngonna hit back hard and the problem with\npeople who are like narcissistic is\nthey're really good at pushing your\nemotional buttons right so like you're\ntrying to be strong but internally\nyou're like uh don't attack me like\nyou've been the victim of bullying like\nthat's what happened with me like I used\nto try to stand up to my bullies and\nwhat would my bullies do they would love\nit when I stood up to them right because\nthey're gonna put my ass who's one year\nyounger and like smaller they are\nthey're gonna put me in my place and\nthen furthermore what I'm doing when I\ntry to be strong and I get manipulated\nor physically like pushed into the\ncorner or whatever is I'm actually\ngiving this this narcissist this bully\nan emotional reinforcement right why are\nthey narcissistic because their value as\na human being is depends on their\nsuperiority to other human beings so if\nyou approach them with strength and you\ndon't have the power to back it up you\nare actually going to positively\nreinforce the negative behavior you're\ngoing to criticize them they're going to\nget pissed off their narcissism Rises\ntheir bullying Tendencies rise and\nthey're going to put you in their place\nand when they put you in your place\nthey're gonna feel really good which in\nturn is going to reinforce what kind of\nbehavior they're going to want to wake\nup tomorrow and put you in their place\nnow they've got one punching bag that\ncan consistently help them feel better\nabout themselves they struggle with low\nself-esteem but hey I can go beat up on\nOlive and if I beat up on Olive I'll\nfeel better about myself the first thing\nI know it sounds kind of weird first\nthing you've got to do is stop being\nstrong I want you all to think a little\nbit about like you know games that you\nplay right when do you want to really\nown someone one 1v1 mid when someone\nlike talks smack to you like that's when\nyou really want to put them in their\nplace it doesn't have anything to do\nwith narcissism it's just like basic\nhuman ideas of like okay like I feel\nreally good about myself when someone\nstands up to me and I get to crush them\nthis is why if you look at like games\nright and who is it fun to play a game\nwith it's not fun to play chess against\nlike a two-year-old monkey that doesn't\nunderstand the rules there's no\nsatisfaction in overcoming them so one\nof the trickiest things that we fall\ninto is that in an attempt to be strong\nwe actually engage that narcissistic\ndefense mechanism we'll criticize them\nwe'll put them in their place we'll set\na healthy boundary and it kind of like\ncauses the sleeping Dragon to wake up\nand then they're gonna emotionally\nmanipulate us we'll get to that in a\nsecond and then they'll end up crushing\nyou anyway which is gonna feel very very\ngood for them so we really want to do is\nbe like the crappiest loot box in the\nuniverse we want to be a loot box that\nevery time they interact with us they\ndon't get anything right they don't get\nany sense of self-esteem they don't get\nany enjoyment they don't get any of that\ncrap we want to take away their rewards\nso they leave us alone so how do we do\nthat we pretend to be weak while\ninternally being strong so I'll give you\nall an example let's say you've got\nfamily conflict with someone and you're\nlike hey mom or dad like the way that\nyou talk to me is like really cruel and\nyou're very abusive and they're like\nscrew you I'm not abusive I'll tell you\nwhat's abusive when you did this and\nwhen you did this and for years I gave\nup my modeling career and I gave up my\nacting career I can't believe that\nyou're so ungrateful for me for all the\nsacrifices I put a roof over your head I\ndo this and like that's what happens\nright you criticize them and you have\nwoken the sleeping Dragon so if you try\nto set a healthy boundary with them\nthey're gonna like blow things up and\nunless you have the power to back up\nthat boundary unless you're financially\nindependent unless you're in a loving\nrelationship unless you've got the rest\nof your life kind of sorted out then by\nall means go set healthy boundaries with\nwhoever the [ __ ] you want but if you\ndon't have that stuff it doesn't work\nand in fact what it actually does is it\nreinforces their narcissism because here\nyou are attacking them and they are\nputting you in their place and if I\nrebuff an attack on me then I can start\nto believe oh you see this person was\ncriticizing me but it turns out they're\nwrong and I'm not a bad person I'm a\ngood person and this person is\nungrateful and and nothing is like more\naddictive to someone who's a toxic\n[ __ ] than feeling like any kind of\ncriticism is actually wrong right they\ncan prove you wrong and then they can\nfeel better about themselves so instead\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to\nbe weak now what does this look like it\nyou can still set a boundary with\nsomeone but the reason that you're\nsetting the boundary is not because\nthey're doing anything wrong it's\nbecause I am so weak so let's say that\nyour parents are toxic and so you're\ntrying to settle in with them you're\nlike hey stop being toxic to me like you\nknow it's damaging to me instead of what\nyou can say is hey Mom Dad I understand\nthat you all really care about me and I\nunderstand that you really love me but\nwhen you talk to me in this way like it\nputs my head in a bad headspace and\nstupid little me once I get in a bad\nheadspace you know how weak I am so I'm\njust not going to be be able to I'm\ngoing to hang up the phone anytime you\nput me in a bad headspace I apologize\nnot your fault I'm so weak click hang up\nand now something really weird happens\nwith the narcissist so when you set a\nboundary but you don't blame them for it\nlike they can't get traction on that\nright because it's like okay well like\nwe both know you're wrong so they kind\nof don't know what to do they don't get\nthat emotional reinforcement that\nthey're really looking for they don't\nget to like really feel too Superior\nbecause you're saying yeah you're like\nyou're Superior right so I'm I'm a\nscrew-up sorry about that I'm hanging up\nnow and so you figure out whatever that\nboundary is but you don't blame them for\nit right in fact you actually blame\nyourself and you can say hey I'm really\nworking on this I apologize you know I\nhope I'll be able to do better in the\nfuture and then it's almost like this\nweird like principle from like Tai Chi\nor Aikido or Jiu Jitsu where like you\nknow you have to roll with that\nresistance you kind of want to be like\nwater where like if they push at you\nhard like you just wanna you know you're\nnot you're not gonna fight and as long\nas you kind of don't fight but you can\nstill set that limit but as long as you\ndon't evoke the narcissistic defense\nmechanism people will actually respect\nthat limit this is what I've seen as a\npsychiatrist is like teaching my\npatients these principles actually helps\nthem more because you're not triggering\nthat whole complex that allows the\nnarcissists to feel better about\nthemselves you're kind of saying yeah\nyou're better and over time what's going\nto happen is if you hold the boundary\nbut you don't blame them for it you'll\nstart extinguishing the behavior people\ndon't buy crappy loot boxes right people\nbuy loot boxes that give them the stuff\nthat they want and so what you want to\nbecome is a crappy loot box where you're\nnot going to give them the satisfaction\nof feeling Superior you're just going to\nown it yourself and then you're going to\nstep away second thing that you've\nreally got to learn how to do is\nseparate your emotions from your actions\nso if we're talking about toxic\nrelationships how do these people\nfunction they function by engaging in\nmanipulating Behavior now let's talk\nabout how to resist manipulation so what\ndoes it mean to have manipulating\nBehavior what are they actually\nmanipulating what does it mean to be\nmanipulated so literally what\nmanipulation is is I'm going to do or\nsay something that is then going to lead\nto an emotional reaction that\nautomatically induces the behavior on\nyour end I'm not going to ask you for a\nfavor I'm not just going to straight up\ncome up to you and say hey can you do\nthis for me I'm not going to ask for the\nfavor or try to do be like you know I'm\nnot just going to induce the behavior\ndirectly the whole reason it's\nmanipulative is I'm going to make you\nfeel a certain way and then that feeling\nis going to induce the behavior\nautomatically so it's like let me put it\nthis way if I ask you for a favor okay\nand then you say yes and then like the\nfavor is completed we did what I asked\nyou to do and now I'm in your debt right\nyou did me a solid I'm in your debt\nyou're a good person I'm in your debt if\nI'm like a narcissistic [ __ ] I do not\nlike that situation so instead what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm gonna get you to do\nthat thing but I'm not going to be\nindebted to you I'm going to trick you\nor manipulate you into doing it anyway\nbut like it's not going to cost me\nanything so what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to say hey like oh like I did all\nthis stuff for you what are you going to\ndo are you going to help me out too and\nthen even if you say yes and you are\nhelping me out since I've evoked your\nemotions it doesn't feel like I'm in\nyour debt at the end of that right like\nare you gonna help me too I'm gonna\nguilt trip you into helping me and if I\nguilt-trip you into helping me I'm not\nin your debt and so this is the problem\nis if you do me a solid but I don't owe\nyou anything then what I can do is like\nI don't have to pay that back and in\nfact I can get you to do it again I can\nmanipulate you again and I can\nmanipulate you again and I can\nmanipulate you again but if I'm not\nactually racking up any debt I can do\nthat all day and so this is what happens\nwith emotional manipulation is that\npeople will induce an emotion and then\nthat emotion will make the manipulated\nperson automatically engage in a\nbehavior and instead of asking for a\nfavor or any kind of fair exchange of\nlike respect or services or whatever I'm\nmanipulating you into doing something so\nhow do we resist that we resist that by\nseparating out emotions and actions so\nthis is really important if you are\nvulnerable to manipulation what that\nliterally means is that your emotions\nwill induce your actions so some human\nbeings go through life thinking that the\nway to solve emotional problems is\nthrough action if my significant other\nis mad at me I need to buy them a gift\nthe way to resolve that emotion is by\npaying some price or inducing a behavior\nand if I get them the gift then the\nemotion goes away I feel better about\nmyself because thank God they're not mad\nat me anymore but think about that right\nwhat's happening now what you've done is\nyou've reinforced this idea that the way\nthat I'm going to fix my emotions is by\nengaging in some kind of behavior and so\nnow something subtle has happened right\nso let's say I'm use the example of my\nwife she's not like this but you know if\nshe makes me feel bad or makes me feel\nguilty then I'm gonna buy or something\nand so now she's got a really\ninteresting ATM card right she's got a\nreally interesting debit card all she\nshe has to do is get pissed at me to get\nme to buy her stuff and like that's like\nliterally how it works what what I've\ndone is I've positively reinforced with\nlike a thousand dollars her making me\nfeel like [ __ ] and what do you think\nthat's gonna do in the relationship\nshe's like well [ __ ] I need a thousand\nGrand let's make Olive feel like [ __ ]\ntoday she doesn't actually do that she's\nawesome that way but you know and so I\nwant y'all to really realize that your\nability to be manipulated is tied\nentirely to emotions and actions being\ntied in your mind and we also know that\nfrom like research on trauma for example\nthere is a survival mechanism in the\nbrain called dissociation and what does\ndissociation do it divorces our emotions\nfrom our actions and our feelings and\nlike our thoughts and all kinds of stuff\nso we literally want to start doing is\ndivorcing our emotions from our actions\nnow how do you do that let's start with\nsomething like guilt okay so this is a\nvery very common emotion that we see in\nin manipulative relationship perhaps\nguilt is the number one reason why it's\nlike hard to set boundaries with people\nand when we're talking about this power\nDynamic by the way it doesn't\nnecessarily have to be like Financial\ndependence it can be like an emotional\npower Dynamic okay so something weird\nabout guilt which is that we tend to\nthink that I feel guilty because I made\na mistake but that is factually\nincorrect you do not feel guilty because\nyou made a mistake\nsince you feel guilty you believe you\nmade a mistake the guilt comes first I\nknow it's kind of bizarre but if you\nliterally look at the brain the fastest\npart of the brain to activate is our\nlimbic system or our negative emotional\ncircuitry and once our negative\nemotional circuitry activates it then\ngoes to our cerebral cortex where we\nhave our higher order thinking and\nreasoning and it manipulates that part\nof our brain into providing logical\nsupport for our emotions logic doesn't\ncreate an emotion emotion actually\ncreates logic so let me give you all an\nexample of this if I get pissed at\nsomeone if I feel hurt and angry at\nsomeone what kind of logic does my mind\nproduce does my mind take a step back\nand be like hmm you know even though I'm\npissed at them maybe I'm the one that's\nat fault right I should really think\nabout their perspective and like maybe\nI'm the one who's screwing up here of\ncourse not when you get pissed at\nsomeone or more importantly when someone\ngets pissed at you what happens to their\nrational thinking it justifies whatever\nthe emotion is right when I get angry at\nsomeone they did this wrong and they're\nstrong and this wrong and if anyone\ntries to argue with me I'm gonna be like\nscrew you you're wrong right because why\nare you wrong because I'm angry and that\nflip side if you've been on the\nreceiving on this my heart goes out to\nyou when someone's mad at you they'll\ncome up with a thousand reasons to prove\ntheir point\nthis is simply how all emotions work\nright we also see this in like the\nhoneymoon period of marriage we're in\nthe honeymoon period of marriage it's a\npositive motion we just got married I'm\nso in love with this person and when I'm\nso in love with this person what do I do\nto all the red flags they keep waving\naround oh that's red flag number one let\nme snap it in half and throw it away I'm\nfeeling so good I'm so in love you're so\ngreat oh my God there's a red flag oh\nI'm gonna snap it through it in half\nhere's another red flag snap it through\nit in half right I'm gonna ignore all\nthese red flags because I'm so in love\nand they wouldn't do that to me your\nrational mind gets [ __ ] hijacked by\nyour emotions and this is what happens\nin emotional relationships or\nmanipulative relationships is that P\nwhen you try to set a boundary with\nsomeone they're going to evoke guilt and\nguilt is like the the nuclear missile of\nlike emotional manipulation because it\nmakes it your fault right and what does\nthe narcissist want to do they want to\nabsolve themselves of our all guilt and\nthey're going to make it your fault and\nif your fault when you try to set a\nboundary if you're doing something wrong\nand I can convince you that you're\nguilty you're gonna cave your own\nboundary and then you're gonna come like\ncrawling on your hands and knees to me\nto make me like happy right that's like\njust think about the psychological crap\nthat goes on in your head when you try\nto tell someone that they are doing\nsomething hurtful and somehow they do\nthis [ __ ] Jiu Jitsu where it's your\nfault and you feel bad right and then\nyou like you originally criticized them\nbut now you're like making it up to them\nlike what the hell is going on there\nit's because it comes down to guilt\nthey're going to make you feel guilty\nright so they'll say and this is what\nwill happen with narcissists is they\nwill figure out what buttons to push\nover time and so they will figure out\nhow to make you feel guilty right\nbecause if you think about like a toxic\nparent they will fling all kinds of\ninsults I know that y'all don't think\nabout this but you know if you if you're\nlike 20 years old and you have a toxic\nparent they've they've been flinging\ninsults at you for 20 years and why do\nthey keep hammering on the same crap\nright they don't insult your hair and\nthen insult your toenails and then\ninsult your intelligence and then it's\nlike make you feel guilty because they\nmade so many sacrifices they don't\nrandomly pick what they say to you they\nsay the same damn crap over and over and\nover again once they figure out okay\nhere's how I flip the guilt switch they\nflip that switch and once you feel\nguilty then what does your mind do your\nmind then reverse Engineers that this is\nyour fault it assumes that the mistake\nis on you because you feel guilty but\nemotion comes before logic so if we look\nat something like psychotherapy what do\nwe do in Psychotherapy we literally sit\ndown with people and we help them\nunderstand that if you are emotional if\nyou guilt if you're guilty it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it's your fault\nwe're going to decompress that emotion\nand we're going to look at the situation\nlogically and when we do that we help\npeople understand oh actually I was at\nfault for this 25 of it but 75 percent\nof it is not my fault and once someone\nis able to realize that then they're not\nlike playing that game anymore because\nthey're not accepting responsibility for\na hundred percent of crap when they\ndidn't do anything wrong so what y'all\nneed to do if you're in a toxic\nrelationship in a manipulative\nrelationship where you try to set\nboundaries and it does not work this\nperson will use power over you whether\nit's Financial power you know reporting\npower they you report to them they're\nyour boss or they're using emotional\npower over you there are certain things\nthat you can do to change this Dynamic\nand it has to do with understanding this\nnarcissistic relationship doesn't always\nhave to be narcissistic they're not I'm\nnot saying they have like narcissistic\npersonality disorder but this is usually\nwhat happens in these kinds of\nrelationships right your bully is\nlooking for particular things they're\nactually looking for you to try to be\nstrong and then they want to crack you\nlike an egg that is what is the most\nsatisfying right so if you try to\ncriticize them oh man you've woken the\nsleeping dragon and they're gonna come\ndown on you hard and since they know how\nto emotionally manipulate you they're\ngonna win every single time so how do we\nmanage that first thing that we do is be\nlike water be weak say hey I'm going to\nset this limit but I'm setting this\nlimit because I'm weak I'm sorry I can't\nhandle this right now click then they're\ngonna get really really pissed they're\ngoing to come back and she's like I\ncan't believe you hung up on me do you\nknow everything I've done for you and\nyou're like yeah I'm so sorry oh my God\nI really am just like I didn't realize\nthat it's so hard I'm sorry it's just so\nhard for me click and they're like oh my\nGod this like I can't believe you're\ngonna yell at the you've come home and\nthey start yeah you've hung up on me\ntwice how dare you you're like yeah I'm\nso sorry sorry I'm so sorry and then you\n[ __ ] walk out the door and eventually\nthey're gonna stop right because you're\nnot actually like you're not giving them\nthe reward that they're looking for and\nif you're not giving them the reward you\nwill extinguish the behavior second\nthing you've got to work a lot on is\nunderstand that this whole business of\nguilt emotions and actions the whole\npoint of manipulation is they're not\ngonna ask you for anything they're going\nto induce emotions that makes you do it\nanyway and so you're not doing them a\nfavor there's no space for gratitude\nthere's no space for recognition there's\nno space for appreciation it's always\nfixing problems so what you really need\nto learn how to do is separate out\nemotions from actions right and that's a\nwhole other thing we've got videos on\nalexithymia which you should watch you\ncan check out Dr K's guide you can\nmeditate whatever just recognize the\nemotion within you and recognize that\nthis emotion makes me conclude these\nthings and then makes me want to engage\nin a particular Behavior so all you\nreally need to do is go through that\nprocess right and say like okay what\ndoes it feel like to not engage in the\nbehavior what would happen if I just\nride this emotion out and then your mind\nis going to tell you no no you need to\ndo it you need to do because it's your\nfault your fault and hold on a second\nwhat the most important thing is if you\nfeel like you need to do something the\none thing that I would recommend is that\nyou do it with a clear head so wait\nuntil you are of completely clear head\nand then tell your mind we can do this\nthing no problem we can absolutely do it\nI'm just going to wait till I'm calm\nwait till tomorrow take a deep breath\nwake up fresh in the morning go for a\nwalk and then decide what you need to do\nyou will be amazed at how that changes\nyour behavior so just delay delay giving\ninto the emotion okay now I know that\ntoday we talked about all kinds of\nrandom stuff we're kind of all over the\nplace and that's because there's this\nfundamental idea of like boundary\nsetting which just doesn't work and\nespecially when you've got these\nnarcissistic kind of personalities that\nare very emotionally manipulative or\nhave power over you setting how healthy\nboundaries just doesn't work and so\ninstead what we need to do is we need to\nbe smart right we can't we can't outplay\nthem on on straight like you know\naggression but we can absolutely like\noutplay them through like thievery and\nspecial ops and like this kind of stuff\nand so that starts with really\nunderstanding yourself and understanding\nwhat am I reinforcing when I engage in\nthis behavior and if you stick with the\nstuff over time this is literally what\nwhat has helped me help patients who are\nin abusive relationships help teenagers\nwho are with parents who are very very\nemotionally manipulative and like I'm\nthinking about a person who's like\nreally really religious like right so\nthere's like just a lot of guilt dumped\non this person and as long as you're\nlike owning that guilt and you're\nletting it control you you're never\ngonna Escape so good luck with this and\nI really hope it works so it's going to\nbe hard to do but I really want you all\nto give it a shot and the better you get\nat it the better your relationships are\ngoing to become hey y'all I want to take\na moment to thank the sponsor of today's\nvideo Nord pass if you use the internet\nnowadays you know that every single\nwebsite or service or platform wants you\nto make a new account and you have to\ngenerate passwords and since everyone is\nasking you for this crap it can be a\nreal pain to keep track of your\npasswords the other problem is that if\nyou're like me you may get a little bit\nlazy and you may start duplicating\npasswords which is one of the worst\nthings that you can do nordpass allows\nyou to generate very strong passwords\nand maintain them all in one place it\nrelieves the cognitive burden of keeping\ntrack of all of your logins and\npasswords while at the same time\nmaintaining the highest level of\nsecurity I love some of their Advanced\ntools like password generators that will\ngenerate very secure long passwords they\nalso have tools like a password Health\nChecker in which you can audit your\nexisting logins and and passwords and\nsort of replace the ones that need\nreplacing the last thing that I really\nlove about nordpast is that they really\nenhance digital work so if you're\nworking by yourself or with the team and\nyou onboard a new member they may need\naccess to certain Company accounts and\nso nordpass allows you to add or\nsubtract their access to accounts very\neasily without compromising security\nlong term so if you're interested in an\nawesome solution to manage passwords and\nmaintain digital security I highly\nrecommend nordpass if you sign up right\nnow they've got a three-month free trial\nand you all can check that out at\nnordpass.com\nhealthygamer GG so thank you to nordpass\nfor sponsoring today's video and helping\nkeep mental health content on the\ninternet free\nforeign"
