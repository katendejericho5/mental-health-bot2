    "transcript": "so when people have addictions is that\npeople with addictions are not aware of\nwhat they're doing so I'll have patients\nwho will be sober for six months and\nthey'll come in one week and they'll say\nI don't know what happened doc I just\nwoke up and then I slipped up I just\nstarted drinking again and if you look\nat Neuroscience studies of people who\nhave addictions they have a lack of\nawareness of their internal emotional\nstate so what's literally happening with\npeople with addictions is they'll try to\nbreak the Habit right that's really what\nan addiction is it's a really powerful\nhabit and so what they'll do is resist\nwith willpower over time but eventually\nthey'll slip up because over that\nsix-month period at some point stress is\ngoing to start increasing at some point\nthere's conflict within their\nrelationship or their friends aren't\ninviting them to stuff so that's\ninternal stress builds up and as that\ninternal stress builds up they're not\nreally aware of it and then eventually\nthe stress gets so bad that they have to\nuse something like alcohol as a coping\nmechanism but the whole point is that\npeople with addictions are blind to this\nprocess"
