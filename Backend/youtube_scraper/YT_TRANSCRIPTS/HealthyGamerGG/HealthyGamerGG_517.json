    "transcript": "children who grow up in abusive\nhouseholds are very very anxious and why\nis that so if I grow up in a safe\nhousehold the world becomes a safe place\nso remember that when I'm a child I'm\nlearning the basics of life I'm learning\nwhat amount of food I can eat before I\nthrow up I'm learning like what it feels\nlike to need to use the restroom now\nlet's say I grew up with an alcoholic\nparent what that means is on one day the\nparent is fine because they're sober the\nnext day they're drunk and they're\npissed home becomes an unsafe place\nevery time I go home I don't know which\nparent I'm getting so there's no\nsecurity there's no safety and so\nparents are the people that are supposed\nto provide us a safe space from which we\ncan venture out and explore the world\nand if we've got a home base that's safe\nthen I can afford to like go and explore\nbut when I have toxic parents I learn\nthat home is not a safe place and\nthere's no space of stability if there's\nno space of stability the world becomes\na dangerous place if the world becomes a\ndangerous place I can't go out and do\nthings"
