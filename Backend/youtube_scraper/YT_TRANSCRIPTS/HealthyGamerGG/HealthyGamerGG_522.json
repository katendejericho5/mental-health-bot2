    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about one of\nmy least and most favorite topics\nmanifestation and visualization\nin Boston as a psychiatrist I kind of\ndeveloped this reputation for being into\nthe new age stuff right I had studied\nfor years in India to become a monk\nstudied Eastern medicine and so a lot of\nmy patients would a lot of patients\nwould come to me specifically because\nthey'd be interested in like harnessing\nthe energies of the universe and they'd\ncome to me and be like Dr K Dr cake do\nyou like do you believe in the power of\nmanifestation in the Law of Attraction\ncan you help me like do that stuff like\ndo you really believe in it this is real\nyou've gone and studied in the Himalayas\nand stuff\nI'd be like sorry to disappoint y'all\nbut actually it's kind of a bunch of BS\nbecause I looked into the science of it\nand I sort of like was like this is\nactually kind of ridiculous and most of\nthis is misunderstandings from the\nfields of like quantum mechanics and\nthen I looked into the research even\nmore and I sort of discovered something\nreally bizarre that visualization is\nactually capable of achieving things\nthat are scientifically kind of\nimpossible I mean they're not\nscientifically impossible but they sound\nscientifically impossible so today what\nwe're going to do is help you understand\nboth sides of those coins and then also\nhelp you understand how to actually like\neffectively visualize to transform your\nlife into lots of success and bring all\nkinds of things that you want into your\nlife right we're going to actually\nexplain how that works if you're ready\nto take the next step on your mental\nhealth Journey check out Dr K's guide\nit's an immersive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience laid out\nin a way that is tailored to your needs\nso if you're ready to better understand\nyour mind and take control of it check\nthe link in the description below so\nthis starts with kind of the field of\nwhat I would call Quantum mysticism or\nQuantum BS so what happened is in the\nfield of quantum mechanics they did some\nreally interesting experiments like\nthere's this thought experiment of\nsomething called Schrodinger's Cat and\nthere's also this experiment called the\ndouble slit experiment and these are\nkind of these like quantum mechanics\nkind of experiments that changed the way\nthat we looked at the universe and some\nof the conclusions of these experiments\nbasically suggested that the world does\nnot exist the way that we think it does\nthat the world actually exists as some\nkind of weird probability waveform and\nthen the act of observing something\ncauses that probabilities this amorphous\nlike maybes stuff to kind of collapse\ninto a reality so these famous thought\nexperiments like Schrodinger's cat\nI sort of illustrate this and this is\nkind of this idea that there's a box and\ninside there's a box that has a cat and\ninside the box is a vial of poisonous\ngas and there's a 50 chance that the gas\nwill explode and the cat will die and\nthere's a 50 chance that the gas will\nnot explode and the cat will live and so\nwhen we sort of think about okay like\neither the caters is dead or alive but\nwe don't know until we look into the box\nwhereas current theories on quantum\nmechanics kind of say that actually the\ncat is neither dead nor alive and it's\nin some sort of superimposed quantum\nstate of like Half-Life half death which\ndoesn't make any sense kind of\nintuitively but that's apparently what\nthey figured out and so then what\nhappened is a bunch of people who didn't\nreally understand quantum mechanics\ninterpreted this in a slightly different\nway and they sort of interpreted it in a\nsort of intuitive way which is that my\nConsciousness or the act of observation\ncauses reality to manifest and I read\nthis book called in search of\nSchrodinger's cat because I was like in\ninto this stuff right and at the very\nend I really liked the analogy that the\nthe person used at the end of the book\nwhich is that reality is kind of like a\nblock of wood and we can say that hey\nyour face is inside the block of wood\nand you can say what are you talking\nabout that's BS and then I'm like here\nlet me grab a chisel and a hammer and I\nwill show you and if I chisel the block\nof wood in a particular way it will\nreveal your face and then I will say\nwell see look here's your face it was in\nyour block in the block of wood you're\nthe entire time but the key thing is\nthat it's because of the way that I\nobserved reality that gave me the result\nthat I found and we sort of understand\nthis in kind of the particle wave\nduality of Light which is that is light\na particle or is light a wave well it\nkind of depends on which way you look\nfor light if I look for a wave I will\nfind a wave and if I look for a particle\nI will find a particle and so this is\nkind of like I'm not an expert in\nphysics and there's tons of like YouTube\nvideos and stuff about this the key\nPoint here is that somewhere along the\nway there was some revolutionary\ndiscoveries in quantum mechanics and\nthen there were some very common kind of\nlike interpretations about what this\nmeans but if we really look at the\nscience of it it's kind of BS so I\nrecently saw one study for example that\nthe people who believe in this kind of\nlike law of attraction or manifestation\nin the universe subjectively think of\nthemselves as more successful and they\nalso think that the reason that they're\nmore successful is because they're like\nreally good at attracting and harnessing\nthe energies of the universe\nbut objectively they are more likely to\nbe bankrupt they are more likely to be\nin financial hardship and they are more\nlikely to be taken advantage of by other\npeople so at this point I'm pretty\nconvinced that the best way to make\nmoney using the Law of Attraction and\nmanifestation is to sell courses to\nother people to teach them how to\nharness the energies of the Universe I\nthink that is the most consistent way\nthat leads to financial success so it's\nkind of BS right\non the other hand you have people like\nArnold Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arnold\nis this guy who's a big believer in\nvisualization and if you listen to his\ntalks about like bodybuilding acting or\nbecoming governor of California he's\nlike yeah I really believe in\nvisualization when I visualize something\nit like helps me achieve that thing or\nit happens and that kind of got me\nscratching my head right like hold on a\nsecond I mean how is this person able to\nbe like a top-tier bodybuilder top tier\nactor and actually get elected to the\ngovernor like being the governor of\nCalifornia like that's crazy those are\nthree different domains and this dude\nswears by visualization\nso I looked into the research even more\nand what I sort of discovered is there's\nsome crazy stuff out there about the\nscience of visualization so one of my\nfavorite studies on this which is kind\nof unbelievable is that if you have a\ngroup of older people so we're talking\nabout studying a geriatric population\nand they visualize exercising okay they\ndon't actually physically exercise they\nvisualize exercising it increases their\nmuscle strength by up to 36 percent\nso if I take a group of old people and I\ntell them hey visualize exercising they\nphysically get stronger by 36 percent\nthis is insane so if you actually look\nat the research on visualization by the\nway most of the research actually has to\ndo with physical performance so they're\ntalking about like athletes and Olympic\nathletes and stuff like that they'll do\nrandomized trials where people are like\nworking out physically and then working\nout physically plus visualization and\nthe people who use visualization will\nactually like be stronger and the the\ncraziest thing the reason I cite that\nstudy it's kind of one of the weirdest\nones is that this is like wild but you\ncan be sitting on your ass at home and\nif you visualize working out your body\nwill get physically stronger the effect\nsize tends to be stronger in older\npopulations and that kind of gets\ncomplicated but basically I think that\neven in younger populations it seems to\nwork okay so now the question is well\nhold on a second because here you are\nyou're saying that like visualization\ndoesn't work right and there's evidence\nthat shows that people who like Believe\nIn The Law of Attraction they end up\nbeing more bankrupt and on the other\nhand you have these people like Arnold\nand you have some studies which show\nthat like thinking about working out or\nvisualizing working out actually leads\nto improved grip strength so which is it\nlike how do we understand this and\nthere's a really simple way to\nscientifically understand this\nvisualization works for anything inside\nyou but does not work for anything about\nthat happens outside of you so if I\nvisualize the world changing nothing's\ngonna happen if I visualize myself being\nsuccessful in the world that will lead\nto change and let's understand that\nscientifically because if we think about\nthe mind the mind doesn't have any\ncapacity to change anything outside of\nme right like I can't use telepathy or\ntelekinesis to like lift objects like\nthe mind can affect things within the\nbody and when we really look at the\neffect of the mind on the body then we\nhave tons of evidence that the Mind does\nall kinds of weird things in the body so\nwe know that there's something called\nthe placebo effect which means that if I\nthink a treatment will work it will work\nif I take a sugar pill but I believe it\nis a treatment I will see a clinical\nImprovement we also see something called\nthe nocebo effect which is the opposite\nwhich is that if I don't if I believe\nthat an actual medication won't help me\nthe effect size of the medication\ndecreases like everybody knows that\nPlacebo and nocebo a real thing and\napparently even studies with a\nvisualization show that if I visualize\nmyself working out I will get physically\nstronger so if we look at the Domain in\nwhich visualization actually works\nit can work within us right so if I'm\nvisualizing anything about this it'll\nactually lead to Scientific progress\nnow what about things that are not\nphysical in nature though right so let's\nsay I visualize like success and this is\nwhere I think there's a really important\ntechnique here which is you can shape\nthe nature of that visualization to\nactually help you or not help you so if\nI visualize myself as a successful\nperson and I focus on myself as the\ntarget of visualization I do actually\nbelieve that will help you be more\nsuccessful but if I visualize my success\nas an external thing like lots of people\nare walking up to me and giving me\noffers and giving me like lots of\nsupport and help and stuff like that\nthat I think is less likely to actually\nachieve something and even if we look\ninto the psychology of it like what\nchanges if you visualize yourself as\nsuccessful so what changes is the way\nthat you interact with the world right\nbut if I visualize myself as successful\nand that kind of sinks in in some way it\nchanges the way that I interact with the\nworld so if I apply for a job and I\nvisualize myself as successful and I get\na rejection that visual realization will\nsort of buffer against the damage or the\nloss of hope that comes with negative\nthings happening to me in life\nvisualization almost acts as a way to\nFoster or cultivate what I would call\nresilience and this is why people who\nvisualize themselves as successful are\nmore likely to be objectively successful\nbecause everyone has setbacks but what\nwhat determines whether you succeed or\nfail in the end is the way that your\nmind manages those setbacks so if you\ndon't do things like visualization or\ndon't believe in yourself and you get\nrejected you are going to say oh wow\nthis is a this is proof that I am not\nworth it I am not a good human being I'm\ndoomed to fail in life and what are you\nactually doing in that moment you are\nvisualizing yourself as a failure and as\nyou visualize yourself as a failure it\nmakes it less likely for you to apply\nagain it makes it less likely for you to\nthink about what you did wrong and\nactually collect feedback about your\nrejection and do better next time right\nyou're just like ah screw it I guess I'm\ngonna end up Doom scrolling the rest of\nthe day and being angry at myself in the\nworld and like be like full of\nresentment versus someone who visualizes\nthemselves as a success when something\ndoesn't go their way they sort of have\nthat resilient buffer within them and\nthey're like okay like fundamentally\nlike I'm a decent human being and I will\nbe successful this is just a temporary\nsetback what can I learn from it and how\ncan I move forward and it's in that\nchange that you actually will end up\nchanging the way that you interact with\nthe world which will lead to objective\nchanges in your life okay the key thing\nabout visualization is that you should\nvisualize stuff within you but don't\nworry about anything outside of you\nbecause you can't control that stuff\nand we know that there's all kinds of\nneat stuff like\num there's even some studies that show\nthat there's one of my favorite studies\non this is actually from 1836\nand there's a French Doctor Who went to\na group of patients and told them like a\nhundred something patients and told them\nhey I'm so sorry I gave you the wrong\nmedicine I gave you something that is\ngonna cause nausea and vomiting it's\nsomething that's supposed to we\nadminister to patients to get them to\nvomit when they've ingested poison and\n80 percent of those patients started\nfeeling nauseous and started vomiting\nright so it's like super wild but the\nMind absolutely has control over the way\nthat your body works cortisol levels\nstress levels immune function GI\nfunction all this kind of stuff matters\neven muscular growth and strength right\nwhich is super bizarre\nso start by focusing on your\nvisualization on yourself and then it\nwill work\nnow we've got to dive into something a\nlittle bit more nuanced which is a lot\nof people may be thinking to themselves\nbut I like I imagine myself as\nsuccessful all the time or I daydream or\nfantasize about success so what is the\ndifference between like imagining stuff\nlike using my mind to picture positive\nthings in visualization\nso the interesting things is that these\ntwo things imagination and visualization\nare actually complete opposites\nnow this is where our and that sounds\nkind of weird but our understanding of\nthe mind is not very nuanced with our\nlanguage so I'll explain how this works\nso if we look at visualization what does\nthis entail it entails focusing of the\nmind right so I imagine that when Arnold\nor these other people like when we train\nOlympic athletes and visualization we\nare training them to focus their mind on\na particular thing so it is an extended\nperiod of focus the second thing that\ntends to happen with visualization is\nthat we tend to cultivate emotion okay\nso the more that I visualize that like\nI'ma be a badass the more that I'm kind\nof stoking the fire of positive emotion\nso if we look at the actual\npsychological mental EEG neuroscientific\nand physiological effects of\nvisualization we are focusing the mind\nand we are stoking emotion\non the flip side we have stuff like\nfantasy daydreaming and Imagination so\nin these things we actually know that\nfor example maladaptive daydreaming is\nlikely a subtype of ADHD if you talk to\nsomeone who Daydreams a lot or\nfantasizes a lot or imagines a lot their\nmind does not focus on one thing in fact\ntheir mind moves between lots of\ndifferent things when you have a\nDaydream it's not like you're watching\nyour Daydream and you hit pause and\nyou're stuck on that frame for 15\nminutes when you Daydream you go through\na whole story for like an hour and first\nyou do this and then you do this and\nthen you go on a yacht and then you go\nscuba diving and then all these people\nare happy and then they throw you a\nparty and then you win an award you like\nplay through this whole thing so your\nmind's not focused on one thing your\nmind is actually bouncing around the\nsecond thing that we know about\ndaydreaming fantasy and Imagination is\nthat they reduce your internal emotional\nstate they're essentially psychological\ncoping mechanisms so I'll give you all a\nreally simple example that runs true for\nme so I got bullied a lot as a right and\nwhen I got bullied a lot I would have\nfantasies about getting even with my\nbullies and so I would feel so hurt and\nweak and resentful and then what would\nhappen over the course of like this\nfantasy that I would have I would start\nto feel triumphant I would start to feel\nthis and more importantly I would reduce\nthat negative emotion in the mind so we\nalso know from lots of studies on you\nknow neuroscience and fmris and stuff\nlike that that daydreaming and fantasy\nare essentially emotional coping\nmechanisms now you may be thinking but\nwhen I felt triumphant like doesn't that\ncount a stoking emotion and not really\nbecause that sense of Triumph is very\ntemporary and is essentially used to\ncancel out that negative emotion so\nyou're not building up emotion\nconsistently over time it's kind of this\ntemporary thing that's an emotional\ncoping mechanism\nso this is what we've got to understand\nvisualization and daydreaming are\nactually exact opposites one happens\nkind of like has lots of scattered\nthoughts which move around whereas the\nother is a very very focused mind for an\nextended period of time and the second\nis one actually reduces our internal\nemotional state and the ultimate other\none cultivates a positive emotional\nstate and so when your mind is focused\nand you are cultivating a positive\nemotion that will help you get motivated\nwe can kind of see how that will lead to\nreal world changes\nso now let's talk about visualization\nBasics based on the science here are a\ncouple of things that you should do so\nwhatever you want to visualize we want\nto do it for about 10 to 15 minutes at a\ntime and we'll talk a little bit more at\nthe end we'll teach you all some\ntechniques and stuff or give you all\nresources there but you basically want\nto visualize for about I would say 15\nminutes at a time and the goal is to\nfocus your mind on one particular thing\nokay the second thing that we really\nwant to do is focus on the internal part\nas opposed to the external part so if\nyou are visualizing success don't\nvisualize winning the lottery visualize\nyourself studying really hard or\nvisualize yourself working really hard\nfor like 15 minutes you were just\nwatching and forcing your mind to focus\non you accomplishing something so have\nthe target of your visualization be\nyourself in the case of exercise\nliterally what these Protocols are is\npeople will imagine I'm using that word\nimagine but they will focus on\nthemselves working out they will also\nFocus on things like the mechanism\nwithin their body so they will visualize\ntheir muscles growing so what you what I\nwant you to kind of do is like visualize\nwhatever the mechanism of change is\nwithin you so you can imagine that your\nbrain is becoming more plastic you can\nimagine that your muscles are like you\nknow being stressed and they're growing\nand they're sort of activating all kinds\nof stuff your mitochondria are working\nhard there's like kind of genes that are\nactivating whatever whatever you want to\ndo is totally fine just focus on\nyourself so pick a particular Target\nuse that visualization like I would say\nfive days a week if you can three days a\nweek if you can for 15 minutes and pick\nsomething in yourself so you don't want\nto visualize different stuff every day\nyou want to pick one particular Target\nright so if you're visualizing physical\nsuccess visualize yourself working out\nand your muscles kind of growing if\nyou're visualizing like let's say like\nsomething like romantic success or\nsocial success visualize yourself\nlooking attractive visualize yourself\nwith your hair done nicely you're like\nclean and stuff like that and you're\nwalking into a social situation and\nvisualize yourself talking to people and\nthe really cool thing about that is if\nwe kind of think about it right\nwhen my mind\nvisualizes something and sends a command\nto the rest of my body my body gets in\nline so if I say to my mind pick up this\npen\nlike think about all of the nerves and\nmuscles and blood vessels and everything\nelse in my body that has to like\nactivate\nto do something as simple as pick up a\npen so a abstract command from the top\nof your mind will actually get all of\nyour different like body parts in order\nto execute that that command this is how\na French physician can tell people brah\nI gave you something that's going to\nmake you puke and our GI system our mind\nis like okay this thing is going to make\nus puke and our GI system is like oh my\nGod we feel like puking that's literally\nhow it works okay so pick one thing and\nvisualize it kind of from the top down\nso if y'all are interested in learning\nmore about this stuff definitely check\nout our videos on things like yoga there\nare other other meditation practices and\nif y'all are really interested in the\nmore like weird spiritual consciousness\nmanifests the universe kind of thing\ncheck out Dr K's guide because we go\ninto a ton of detail about the nature of\nConsciousness and how it interacts with\nthe universe and what is the theoretical\nbasis of like mantras and how they\naffect things outside of you now the\nlast thing that I'm going to talk about\nis going to be kind of weird because now\nthat I've explained to you what the\nscience of visualization is where its BS\nis where it's legitimate and kind of\nlike how it works I'm going to torpedo\neverything I just said and share with\ny'all what my personal opinion is which\nis that I believe that Consciousness can\nmanifest in some way in reality now this\nis not a scientific belief by any means\nthis is just based on my experience of\nmy own sort of meditative practice so\nfor example like 20 years ago no wow\nit's been 20. 20 years ago I was given a\nMantra by a tantric in India and this\nwas a guy who like gave me a mantra and\nI was like I want a mantra that will\nchannel the energies of the universe to\nlike make me spiritually successful in\nlife and materialistically successful in\nlife and he was like okay I will give\nyou and he just like gave me this month\nand he's like just chant this month or\nevery day and you'll harness the\nenergies of the universe and you'll be\nmore successful than you realize and at\nthe time I was like a College Dropout\nwith like a less than a 2.0 GPA and I\nwas like okay like maybe I'll just do\nthis thing and I'll give it a shot and\nwhat I sort of found is that it's kind\nof bizarre but the more that I do the\nmonth or the more that I saw it\nabsolutely helped me spiritually and\nthen also like helps me\nmaterialistically in some weird way and\nI've had some sort of experiences in\nmeditation where I sort of feel\nconnected with other things and then\nlike kind of the last thing I don't know\nif it's gonna make any sense but my wife\nhas the ability to bend the universe to\nher will and sometimes I'll even talk to\nlike my patients about this and I'll ask\nthem like I'll just ask them straight up\nlike do you ever bend the University or\nwill and if you know what I'm talking\nabout you know what I'm talking about if\nyou don't know what I'm talking about\nit's going to sound like absolute BS but\nthis is where like I'm a skeptic by\nnature and even when science tells us\nthat something is complete BS the tricky\nthing about science is that science is\nthe best system to learn about the world\nI think it's objectively Superior than\nbasically every other system but it is\nalso wrong way more than it's right\nright like for 50 50 years ago people in\nscientists thought that meditation had\nno mental health benefits let alone\nphysical benefits right because how on\nEarth does meditating you're not even\nthinking about anything you're just like\nsitting there with an empty mind how can\nthat affect GI symptoms or rheumatoid\narthritis or even things like cancer\nlike that doesn't make any there's no\nbiological plausibility so one thing to\nkind of keep in mind this is what I've\nlearned the hard way is that science is\nlike really good at telling us what's\nright and wrong but it's usually wrong\nand as we learn more about science we\nwill learn more about like things that\nwe used to believe were completely false\nand meditation's kind of at the top of\nthe list\nso I I personally do believe that like I\nknow it sounds kind of weird but when\nyou enter into these deeper States Of\nConsciousness you are more connected to\nthe universe and that you can harness\nthose kinds of energies and create\nmanifestation in the world\nwhich is crazy right because you're\nsaying but Dr Kate didn't you say at the\nbeginning that you didn't believe any of\nthat crap and it's like yeah I didn't\nused to believe that crap but the more\nthat I kind of look into it and the more\nthat I wind up in these situations where\nI get into a fight with my wife and I'm\nlike we're gonna miss our plane we're\ngonna miss our plane we need to go we\nneed to go we need to go and we leave\ntoo late and I'm looking at what the GPS\nsays the airport's an hour away and\nthere's like no way we're gonna miss our\nplane and get some text halfway through\nI mean I'm pissed at her trying really\nhard not to yell she's like kind of like\napologizing and then she like gets some\ntext and she's like yeah the flight's\ndelayed by an hour we'll be fine and I'm\nlike\nI was right and you're bending the\nuniverse to win an argument with your\nhusband\nand like I'm like can't you bend the\nuniverse like fix climate change or\nworld hunger why do you have to bend the\nuniverse to your will to win an argument\nwith me and I don't know how to make\nsense of this crap but y'all may know\nthat like on some level sometimes you\nfeel like you can shape the universe and\nthere's weird crap that we're\nunderstanding from like psychedelics and\nstuff about like there's some sort of\ncosmic connection that human beings will\nexperience that things are connected in\nways that are not physical we're not\nreally sure we haven't really figured it\nout but I'm telling you like there's\nsomething to it\nand I think that hopefully over the next\n10 20 30 40 50 years you know like we'll\nsort of figure this out and the last\nthing that's really crazy is that I'm\nnot the only crazy person who is very\nwell qualified who believes this crap\nright so even people like Roger Penrose\nwho won the Nobel Prize in physics along\nwith Stephen Hawking has papers about\nlike Consciousness and its connection to\nthe universe right so he kind of\nbelieved this stuff in a slightly\ndifferent way right he's kind of it's a\nslightly different way but and there's\nlike there's consistently really really\nsmart people who've won Nobel prizes who\nbelieve that there's something to this\nand for some reason human beings keep on\nrevisiting this despite a lack of\nscientific evidence and why is that it's\nbecause in our experience we can kind of\nfeel it sometimes right now if y'all\ndon't get what I'm saying that's totally\nfine and that's why I like started with\nthe science stuff but to be honest I\nthink this is one of those things where\nwe need to be scientifically humble and\nrecognize that we've just started\nresearch into like this field of\nConsciousness we don't really know what\nit is we don't know where in the brain\nit comes from we've got some ideas about\nthis we don't really know like how it\ninner interacts with things like energy\nand matter we don't really know yet\nthis is just a fancy way of saying like\na roundabout way of saying you know if\nyou believe in this crap and Dr K tells\nyou based on the science that hey this\nstuff is a bunch of BS take that with a\ngrain of salt too so our goal here is to\nshare what we understand about stuff\nright and I'm happy to tell you all that\nscientifically the way that you should\nvisualize is don't try to manifest crap\nin the universe\nvisualize on yourself for 15 minutes\nimagine yourself doing things imagine\nyour muscles growing imagine you being\nmore successful imagine all that crap\nand it will Cascade down into your\nphysiology and into your cellular\ninfrastructure and at the same time if\nyou believe this crap don't give up on\nit just because some random guy who\ntrained at Harvard is telling you that\nit doesn't work right continue to\nexplore for yourself about what works\nand what doesn't and by all means let us\nknow so report back and tell us like hey\nDr K like I visualize crap all the time\nand I manifest things in the universe I\ndon't know how it works but I really\nbelieve it so let us know do you think\nit's BS do you think it works do you\nthink it not it doesn't work because the\nway that we're really going to figure\nthis out is by making some observations\nand then developing hypotheses and then\nto test those hypotheses\nso if y'all are concerned about\nvisualization I totally get it in the\nLaw of Attraction manifestation I think\nmost of that crap honestly is crap but I\nhave seen enough stuff to where it's a\nquestion mark in my mind right so I sort\nof use this stuff in my personal life\nand it seems to be working pretty well\nat the same time I don't know that I can\nreliably recommend that to y'all what I\ncan reliably recommend to you is the\nscience of how visualization actually\ncreates positive change in your life and\nthat's something that you all should\nabsolutely do\n[Music]"
