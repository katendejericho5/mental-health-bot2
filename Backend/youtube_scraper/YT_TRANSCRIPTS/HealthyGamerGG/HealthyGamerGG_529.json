    "transcript": "hey y'all today we're going to talk\nabout how to study or be cognitively\nproductive in your sleep\nand I know that sounds kind of\nunbelievable but when I was wandering\naround India trying to become a monk I\nlearned a lot of weird esoteric\nmeditation techniques and I got so\ncurious about some of the stuff that I\nended up becoming a neuroscience\nresearcher and eventually a psychiatrist\nand through those experiences I really\nstarted to figure out okay like how does\nthis work scientifically So today we're\ngoing to teach you a meditation\ntechnique that will help you sort of\ndirect your mind while you sleep you can\nsort of Point your mind in a particular\ndirection and it'll kind of work on\nautopilot and we're also going to lean\non a lot of what we know from sleep\nresearch about how to optimize this\nprocess so that it can happen for you\nconsistently hey just a quick note a lot\nof people will ask us what do I do next\nand that's why we built Dr K's guide\nIt's a comprehensive resource that\ndistills over 20 years of my experience\nboth as a monk and as a psychiatrist and\nit's designed in a way that's tailored\nto fit your needs so if you're\ninterested in better understanding your\nmind and taking control of your life\ncheck out the link below so let's start\nby understanding the science of sleep so\nwhen we sleep our brain does two major\nthings the first thing that it does is\nsomething called memory consolidation so\nas we start learning stuff throughout\nthe day it actually fills up something\ncalled our short-term memory and stuff\nin our short-term memory gets\nConsolidated into our long-term memory\nthrough this part of our brain called\nthe hippocampus while we sleep so this\nfunction of memory consolidation happens\nwhile we sleep and you can sort of think\nabout this as like let's say I'm\nworking on like a paper or something\nlet's say I'm writing a paper I'm\ndrawing something on the computer so\nright now this information is stored in\nmy computer's Ram but in order to store\nit to the hard drive I have to like save\nit right and once it's stored to the\nhard drive I can close it and I can\nrecall it but if it gets wiped from my\nRam before I ever save it then I'll sort\nof lose the information and if we kind\nof think about what happens in our brain\nwhen we sleep when it comes to memory\nthat's the time in which our brain\nlearns so as we study everything fills\nup our RAM and this is why when we sleep\nlike that that sort of information will\nkind of gets Consolidated and it'll be\neasier to remember a simple example of\nlike how this is effective is you can\nthink about okay if I study one hour a\nday for 14 days versus 14 hours on one\nday in which scenario will I actually\nknow more one hour a day for 14 days\nwill absolutely beat 14 hours on one day\nbut the question is why it's the same\namount of studying the difference is\nthat in one case we're leveraging memory\nconsolidation and in another case we're\nnot leveraging memory consolidation so\nthis is really important to understand\nthe next thing that we have to\nunderstand is that during sleep our\nbrain not only learns it actually goes\nthrough a process called d-learning now\nthis was something that was discovered\nby researchers at Harvard University in\n1983. so like a lot of the old sleep\nresearch is actually where a lot of the\ncool stuff is so these researchers\ndiscovered something really important\nwhich is that when we go to sleep our\nbrain actually focuses on getting rid of\ncertain kinds of information are\nespecially emotional experiences and\nthat there's actually a hierarchy that\nas long as we are sort of emotionally\nactivated our brain will prioritize\nd-learning over learning\nso we also see this kind of clinically\nand Sigmund Freud was actually the first\nperson who figured this out he sort of\nnoticed that the experiences that we\nhave during the day will shape the\ndreams that we have at night that what\nour brain does at night is tied to what\nhappens to us during the day and a\nreally important observation that he and\nJung sort of made this observation as\nwell is that when we have a negative\nemotional experience during the day our\nmind will spend that night trying to\nprocess that emotion and clean it out\nand let's understand why this is so if I\nhave some kind of negative emotional\nexperience processing it while I am\nconscious will be painful right so if I\ngot like bullied by someone and I start\nthinking about the bullying or process\nThe Bullying during the day all of that\npain will arise so our brain has learned\na really interesting evolutionary thing\nwhich is hey we're going to actually\nprocess emotions while you're zonked out\nand you may have noticed this as well\nthat if you go to bed one night and\nyou're kind of upset oftentimes you will\nfeel better in the morning so the\nquestion is hold on a second where did\nthose negative emotions go why do you\nfeel better is it just because you're\nrested and your brain has like sort of\ncleared adenosine it's actually way more\nthan that there's this emotional\nprocessing going on\nwhich people kind of coined as\nd-learning because it's kind of getting\nrid of stuff\nand we also see this in clinical\nPsychotherapy so if you look at people\nwho have PTSD what happens to people at\nPTSD they have a very traumatic\nexperience and one of the diagnostic\nfeatures of PTSD is actually nightmares\nit is the most common like sleep\nexperience for people with PTSD and so\nwhat does the correlation be between\nbeing traumatized during the day and\nhaving nightmares at night well it's\nbecause what happens is we have all of\nthose emotions which in people with PTSD\nthey will suppress using cognitive\nmechanisms like dissociation and then\nthose emotions will manifest in their\nsleep and we also know from like\nclinical studies on Psychotherapy that\nas you heal these people through things\nlike Psychotherapy as we talk about that\nemotionally processed during the day\ntheir nightmares actually improve over\ntime\nso the second thing to really understand\nabout the science of sleep is that if\nyour brain has to do some kind of\nd-learning or getting rid of stuff it\nwill prioritize that over memory\nconsolidation\nso now let's move on to the core\nmeditation technique so I was learning\nthis technique called Yoga Nidra and\nYoga Nidra it's really weird the way\nthat I learned this technique so there\nwas I was at an ashram and there was a\nguy who I went to him and I said hey\nlike you know I'm interested in in\nlearning meditation he was like okay\nwhat are your goals and I said well\nbasically like I'm kind of screw-up in\nlife and I want to start stop being a\nscrew-up I want to like just basically\nbecome a Chad version of myself and he\nwas like okay fine I'm gonna teach you a\ntechnique called Yoga Nidra and so what\nthis technique is basically about\nis inducing a state of a trance so if we\nsort of think about how our conscious\nmind works we have like conscious waking\nand then we have kind of Deep Sleep\nwhere we're completely unaware\nbut what this person sort of helped me\nlearn is this technique that helps you\nessentially go far in into sort of the\nSleep state but while remaining\nconscious so you're essentially like\nconsciously aware while you are sleeping\nand this is kind of like lucid dreaming\nbut if we sort of think about where\nlucid dreaming lives lucid dreaming is\nlike activity of the mind right so\nyou're experiencing lots of things and\nyou're kind of consciously aware but the\nstate of Yoga Nidra is actually deeper\nthan lucid dreaming because there's no\nconscious activity up here so your mind\nis actually completely empty and yet you\nretain awareness if it sounds really\nweird and you have no idea what I'm\ntalking about\nthat's okay it's something that you\nreally have to experience so it's kind\nof like being submerged where like\nunless you've actually been underwater\nit's impossible to describe so the goal\nof the yoga nidler technique is to\nessentially put your body into a deep\ndeep state of relaxation and induce a no\nmind state where you retain that\nconscious awareness and so this is\nsomething called the Hypno yogic State\nand it's kind of the state of a trance\nthe cool thing is that once you start\nentering that trance you can kind of\nlike direct your subconscious mind or\nyour sleeping mind in a particular\ndirection\nand the purpose that I was using this\ntechnique for was to kind of like\nrewrite some of my like personality\nstructure and it worked pretty well I\nguess who knows really but what I sort\nof did is I became proficient in this\nthis technique and as I became\nproficient in the technique I started to\nnotice that I started to like function\nbetter in my sleep even when I was in\nmed school I only studied like two hours\na day but somehow wound up like getting\nthis award for academic achievement for\nbeing at the top of my class and how did\nI do that it's because actually a lot of\nthe time while I was sleeping my mind\nwas like reviewing information and I\nwould wake up the next day and I would\nlike know stuff it was really bizarre\nand y'all may have actually experienced\nthis too I've actually had a ton of\npatients who've experienced this in some\nway where your mind can kind of review\nthose sort of things that are important\nto you and the question is how do we\ncultivate this so the Bedrock of that is\nYoga Nidra and at the end we'll sort of\ngive you all more information about the\npractice it takes about half an hour to\nteach you so we're not going to teach it\nin this video but we absolutely have\nresources that you can kind of go\nthrough a guided version okay\nso I would say that you need to do yoga\nnidorah for anywhere between a week but\nrealistically like honestly three months\nbecause this whole weird like developing\na trance and directing your subconscious\nstuff you can't do overnight or I've\nnever been able to teach anyone how to\ndo it overnight okay so it's going to\ntake some time so practice yoga but\nthere are a couple of other things that\nwe need to understand scientifically to\nhelp us optimize this process so the\nfirst is going back to learning and\ndelearning so when it comes to learning\nhow can we optimize our short-term\nmemory for long-term consolidation and\nthis is kind of what we know you need to\nreview the same material at least twice\nin one day ideally four hours apart so\nwhat I would kind of say is instead of\nreading let's say you're studying for\nfour hours and you're covering chapters\none through four don't cover chapters\none through four in a four hour block\ninstead what you should do is cover\nchapters one to two take a break for\nabout four hours and then cover chapters\none to two again and what this really\ndoes is fills up your RAM or your\nshort-term memory with this information\nand then the process of consolidation\nwill be optimized while you sleep\nthe second thing that we really have to\nthink about is remember that the brain\nprioritizes d-learning over learning\nand so this is where if you have any\nkind of negative emotions before you go\nto sleep your brain will process those\nemotions instead of focusing on the\nmaterial and I don't know if this kind\nof makes sense but let's say I'm like\nstudying for a test and then my\nsignificant other calls me and is like\nhey I think we should take a break as I\nget emotionally disturbed I'm not going\nto be thinking about my test overnight\nor the material my brain is going to\nfocus on putting out the fires of that\nemotional energy because now I'm pissed\noff I'm scared I'm frightened I'm pissed\nI feel betrayed whatever all those\nnegative motions take priority so what\nwe sort of know is that d-learning takes\npriority over learning so before you go\nto bed any kind of journaling or\nanything like that you can do or talking\nthings through or like meditating or\nwhatever like as long as there's\nnegative emotions floating on around in\nyour mind your mind will prioritize that\nover the memory consolidation and\nreviewing things in your sleep\nthe next thing to understand is actually\nkind of interesting because it is the\nopposite of what a lot of people will\ntell you to do and that is do not write\nanything down before you go to sleep so\nif you're studying things don't like\nmake notes about them especially for\nthat second repetition you can sort of\ndo it for the first repetition but we\nactually don't want to write things down\nand let's understand why\nso what happens to our Ram what happens\nto our short-term memory when we write\nthings down\nit actually gets emptied so if we sort\nof think about using a calendar or using\nan organizer the moment that we make a\nto-do list what actually happens to our\nshort-term memory or Ram it gets freed\nup so this is a technique that we use on\npurpose right what I want to do is put\neverything on a to-do list or stick\neverything on a calendar and the reason\nthat I want to do that is to free up my\nmind so that I can focus on something\nelse but remember before we if we want\nto study in our sleep what we actually\ndo is we don't want an empty mind we\nwant a completely full mind we want our\nshort-term memory to be maxed out so\nparadoxically if I write a bunch of\nstuff down before I go to bed what I\nactually find is that it empties my mind\nout and my mind does not go through this\nprocess so you want to avoid writing\nthings down that are related to whatever\nis in your RAM before you go to bed okay\na couple of other things that we need to\nconsider\nthe first is that basically all kinds of\nsubstances will interfere with this\nprocess so when I was learning this yoga\nnidler practice my teachers basically\ntold me like you have to be like free of\nall substances all psychoactive\nsubstances caffeine whatever so I can\nactually get away with caffeine in the\nmorning but if I have any caffeine\nafternoon it doesn't really work and any\nkind of alcohol or marijuana will\ninterfere with this process let's\nunderstand why\nso the first is if we think about why do\npeople use things like marijuana to help\nthem sleep or CBD it gives them this\ndeep sense of rest right so unless I use\nmarijuana or alcohol or even sleeping\nmedication I'm going to be tossing and\nturning and my mind will be very active\nso how do I induce a deep state of Rest\nby zonking my mind out and if I use\ncertain psychoactive substances and I go\nto sleep I disappear into the ether with\nno awareness for eight hours nine hours\nand then I wake up right I wasn't\ntossing and turning I wasn't thinking\nabout anything I was in a very deep\nstate of rest so if we sort of think\nabout the hypna yogic state so here's\nlike Consciousness over here here's\nhypna yogic and here's like deep rest\nall of those psychoactive substances\nwill move you right past that Hypno\nyogic State into this like deep deep\nrest where you have no conscious control\nand we also have really good scientific\ndata to back this up so we know that for\nexample like marijuana and any\npsychoactive substance will actually\ninterfere with your sleep stage\narchitecture so I don't know if you all\nare familiar with this but they're like\nthese four stages of sleep and there's\nREM sleep and all this kind of crap and\nwhat we sort of know is that it doesn't\nmatter which substance something is\ngoing to mess with that sleep stage\narchitecture to leave things in a\nnon-ideal state okay the last thing to\nconsider is that deadlines are really\nreally important for cognitive\nproductivity during sleep and I wish\nthis weren't the case but in my\nexperience when I review stuff in my\nhead there has to be like a deadline\ncoming up like I can't read something a\nweek ahead of time and then for some\nreason this this process just triggers\nless I've sort of found that the closer\nthat I am to an actual deadline my\nsubconscious mind kind of knows like oh\ncrap like we really need to review this\nstuff and it sort of like helps me\nreview it the night before I sleep so\nwhat I sort of found is that the you\nknow the 24 to 72 hours before I have a\ntest is what triggers this process the\nmost it's just kind of the truth of the\nmatter I wish it weren't the case maybe\nas I become more proficient in Yoga\nNidra that'll change but that's just\nkind of how it is so just to summarize\nif you want to be cognitively productive\nwhile you sleep there is actually a way\nto do this it starts with the\nfoundational practice of Yoga Nidra and\nYoga Nidra will train your awareness to\nbe somewhat active in these kind of like\ntrance-like States and there's even like\ninteresting EEG or electrical activity\nkind of studies on the brains of people\nwho enter the state where it's not quite\nConsciousness and it's not quite sleep\nso you have to train yourself it'll take\nanywhere between a week and three months\nthe longer you do it the better you'll\nget at it second thing we've got to do\nis optimize our Ram so we want to fill\nit up by studying the same thing at\nleast four hours apart twice a day we\ndon't want to sabotage our Ram by like\nother highly engaging crappy stuff like\nyou know stuff that pisses you off on\nTwitter or like engaging on Reddit or\nwhatever and then the other thing to\nremember is that our brain will\nprioritize d-learning over learning so\nif there are emotions that are active\nwhat we actually want to do is try to\nvent those emotions as much as possible\nbefore we go to sleep so you can do\nsomething like Journal before you go to\nbed right so you can empty all that\nstuff out or you can meditate you can go\nfor a walk you can talk with a friend\nwhatever you kind of want to get rid of\nall that stuff the other thing that we\nalso want to keep in mind is where a lot\nof people screw up is that we want to do\njournaling for emotions but we actually\ndon't want to write anything down right\nbefore we go to bed for the stuff that\nyou're trying to learn because remember\nthat when you write something down it\nactually leaves your mind so we actually\nwant that Ram to be filled up so don't\nwrite anything down before you go to bed\nnow last couple things to consider is\nwatch out for your caffeine intake\nmarijuana intake alcohol and take all of\nyour psychoactive substances and the\nlast thing is that The Closer you are to\nthe deadline the more likely this will\nhappen this is something that I've been\nable to do quite consistently I think\nit's pretty responsible for My Success\nI've been able to help some people do\nthis but this is really like more of a\nlong-haul technique and there aren't\nscientific studies on this whole thing\nso what we've been able to do is kind of\ntie together and extrapolate from basic\nscience research understanding of like\nPsychiatry and Trauma and stuff like\nthat along with some of these yogic\ntechniques so I strongly encourage you\nall to try this stuff and let us know\nhow it works for you it may take a\ncouple weeks it may take a couple months\nbut by all means report back the last\nthing is that I know we talked about\nyoga that's a practice that takes about\nhalf an hour to learn I think we've got\na YouTube video about it so you can\ndefinitely check it out there but we\nalso have Dr K's guide to meditation\nwhere we sort of have a more complete\nexplanation of Yoga Nidra as well as all\nthat like rewriting personality crap\nthat I talked about at the beginning\nbeginning of the video so if y'all are\ninterested in kind of learning it more\nthat way and like learning it in a\ndeeper way definitely check out the\nguide so good luck and let me know how\nit works for you\n[Music]"
