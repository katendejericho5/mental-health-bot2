    "transcript": "human beings used to have a lot of idle\ntime in our brains so if you look at\nlike for the majority of evolution we\ndid rot tasks we do things like turn\nbutter or like make rope and if you\nthink about that like the mind is\nrelatively free I go hunting with a\nbuddy of mine I miss my arrow he hits\nhis Arrow I feel inferior we walk 2\nhours back to Camp over the course of\nthat walking my brain has time to\nprocess now what's happened is if you\nlook at what goes on with our attention\nwe have zero idle time in the brain and\nthe problem is that chances are our\nbrain has evolved to use that idle time\neven like with dreams that the emotional\ncontent of Dreams has to do with the\nemotional content of your life and as we\ninterfere with dreaming as we have you\nknow these different medications that\nwill affect our sleep stages the\nrestfulness that we get changes so our\nbrain is actually even when you're not\nthinking about something your brain is\ndoing a ton of work but now what we've\nstopped doing is giving our our brains\ntime to process information process\nemotions because we're constantly\nexternalizing our attention"
