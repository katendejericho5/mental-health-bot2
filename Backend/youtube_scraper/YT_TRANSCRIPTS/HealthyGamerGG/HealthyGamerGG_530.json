    "transcript": "up to 60 percent of men who kill\nthemselves have no evidence of mental\nillness so I think one of the biggest\nstrategies that we're perpetrating right\nnow potentially is that when we look at\nmale suicide we are assuming that this\nis a pathology of the mind this person\nis sick instead of understanding that\nit's possible that half of the men who\nkill themselves or more don't kill\nthemselves because they're ill they kill\nthemselves because they're genuinely in\na position where death is the only way\nout if we assume it's mental illness we\ndon't try to fix the problems that are\npushing them towards suicide really\nreally scary thing that's going on and\nI'm not saying that mental illness does\nnot lead to suicide and people shouldn't\nget therapy and things like that so when\nI have a patient who's in a traumatic\nand abusive relationship and they're\nsuicidal therapy may help them somewhat\nthe suicide but the most important thing\nI can do for that person's suicidality\nis to help them build a life where\nthey're no longer abused it's to change\nsomething in their life not to change\nthem"
