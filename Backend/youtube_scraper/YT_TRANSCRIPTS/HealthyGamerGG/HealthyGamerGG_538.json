    "transcript": "when we think about making the right\nchoice or doing the right thing we don't\nunderstand that these are actually two\ndiscrete cognitive tasks at play so\nlet's say I want to eat a burger but\ninstead I want to force myself to eat a\nsalad there's healthy option and there's\nunhealthy option so choosing the salad\nis actually two cognitive tasks one is\nresisting the impulse of the burger and\nthe second is forcing yourself to eat\nthe the salad so there's kind of\nresisting the desire and then there is\nchoosing the thing that you don't want\nto do the real problem that people fall\ninto the reason that this can feel\nrepetitive and like you're not making\nprogress over time is because we don't\nactually focus on the two tasks\nseparately let's say I want to renovate\nmy house building like a new wall\nrequires me breaking down the wall first\ngetting rid of the bad thing is the\nfirst step to doing the right thing the\nproblem is in our society today we are\nalso goal focused and outcome focused\nthat we just think about doing the right\nthing we don't think about avoiding the\nwrong thing"
