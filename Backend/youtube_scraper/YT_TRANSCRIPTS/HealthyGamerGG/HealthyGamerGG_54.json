    "transcript": "so the problem with dopamine is we wake\nup in the morning and our dopaminergic\nstores are full so what happens is we\nhave a a reserve of dopamine if you want\nsomething with delayed gratification and\nyour dopamine stores are high you can\nwork a lot but then when you get the\npayoff since you have a bunch of\ndopamine you get a strong dopamine\nrelease and then you feel really good\nlet's say I wake up first thing in the\nmorning and then I work for 4 hours and\nthen what is the reward the subjective\nreward that I feel after 4 hours of work\nit's really positive but if I use\ntechnology for the first 4 hours of the\nday and then I try to go and do work\nyou're not going to you're not going to\nand even if you finish the same amount\nof work you will not experience the same\nlevel of pleasure because your dopamine\nhas literally been depleted got it so\nthe way that I kind of describe this is\nimagine that you have a lemon that is\nfull of juice yep so at the very\nbeginning when it's full of juice a\nsmall squeeze gets you a lot of juice\nbut by the end you have to squeeze a lot\nto get very little juice this is how\ndopamine is in our brain"
