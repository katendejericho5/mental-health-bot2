    "transcript": "to be able to surrender and to be able\nto like really put yourself at the mercy\nof something else that's the ultimate\nform of being in control because like\nthat's where you do have no control it's\nnot the ultimate form of being control\nit's transcending the axis of control\nand not control it's saying that so be\nit and if this person wants to dislike\nme they can dislike me if this person\nwants to judge me for this they can\njudge me even if they say things that\nhurt me it will hurt so be it I do not\nneed the avoidance of hurt to be able to\ncontrol my life so this is why when we\nuse this term Moksha which is sanskrit\nfor enlightenment it is translated as\nboth Bliss and freedom because you are\nhappy with pleasure or pain you are\nhappy with acceptance or rejection\nbecause it is just the way of things it\nis what it is\nokay"
