    "transcript": "if you want to stop being awkward absorb\nyour mind in whatever is around you\ninstead of about what you should say or\nwhether you should say something pay\nattention to what the other person is\nsaying listen to the other person listen\nto your surroundings externalize your\nawareness and then you will not be\nawkward and if we sort of think about it\nwe can see that we can prove it the\nother way too when am I the least\nawkward when I'm absorbed in something\nlike if I get into bed at night and I\ngrab a nice cool pillow and I lay down\nand I'm like man this feels amazing I'm\nnot thinking about okay how can I feel\nmore comfortable is this comfortable\nenough is this not comfortable enough if\nmy attention is on the pillow and on the\nbed I will feel relaxed and it'll feel\ngood and this is why people say so\nawkward is because everyone's like what\ndo I do it is not about doing it is\nabout where your attention is"
