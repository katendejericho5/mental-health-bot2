    "transcript": "so if you really want to overcome\nperfectionism there are a couple things\nyou have to do the first is to focus on\nyour actions instead of the outcomes so\nwhether you studied enough is not based\non whether you're going to get an A or\nnot it's really stop and think about\nokay like what am I here to learn and\nhow much time am I willing to devote and\nI'm going to devote that and that's\ngoing to be like enough right because\nstudying 50 hours may be unreasonable\nbut maybe I can do like 20 hours this\nweek so it's to really focus on the\naction instead of the outcome you learn\nthis the hard way in med school you know\nwe have a lot of great medicine like we\ncan literally we can remove a heart from\nsomeone's body and keep them alive so\none of the brutal lessons that you learn\nis that as a doctor how do I know I do a\ngood job like how can I live with myself\nwhat you focus on is did I do the best\njob that I could should I have studied\nmore should I have like you know run\nmore tests should I have consulted with\nother people and so all you can do as a\ndoctor is like what you can do and the\nrest of it like you can't control is\nbased on God or the universe or RNG or\nlike whatever you want to call it"
