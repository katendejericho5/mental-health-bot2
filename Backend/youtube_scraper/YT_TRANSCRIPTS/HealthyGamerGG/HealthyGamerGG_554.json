    "transcript": "so I want you all to think about why we\nhave emotions for a second we'll really\nunderstand this point it's like 5 000\nyears ago if a human being experienced a\nnegative emotion like feeling lonely\nwhat could they do to make that emotion\ngo away that negative emotion would\nprompt them to engage with other human\nbeings in the same way that hunger\nprompts me to eat that's negative right\nmakes me feel bad thirst prompts me to\ndrink loneliness prompts me to reach out\nto other people that's why we have\nnegative emotions because they prompt us\ntowards the most important behaviors\nnowadays we have a very serious problem\nbecause when we play a video game we can\nmake the loneliness go away for a little\nbit but it doesn't actually fix any of\nour problems so we don't actually\nprogress or improve in our life at all\nso we're taking away that negative\nemotional energy leading ourselves to\nliterally not learn and also not\nprogress in life"
