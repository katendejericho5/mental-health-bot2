    "transcript": "hey y'all I'm Dr K I spent seven years\nstudying to become a monk and then\ndropped out went to med school and\nbecame a psychiatrist and today what I\nwant to share with you all is how monks\nbreak bad habits\nso the basic problem is that when we\nstruggle with habits we sort of have\nthis natural inclination right I wake up\nfirst thing in the morning I check my\nphone I hop onto the computer and then I\nopen up some sort of distracting thing\nlike social media or Reddit or something\nlike that and then I try to use\nwillpower to break that habit and I may\nsucceed for a day or two but that\nnatural inclination The Habit to check\nyour phone or use technology or eat\nunhealthy food seems to linger and\ninevitably our willpower runs out and\nthen what do we conclude we conclude\nthat okay there are people out there who\nare disciplined who aren't lazy like I\nam and they can break bad habits they\ncan build good habits but I struggle\nwith it hey just a quick note a lot of\npeople will ask us what do I do next and\nthat's why we built Dr K's guide It's a\ncomprehensive resource that distills\nover 20 years of my experience both as a\nmonk and as a psychiatrist and it's\ndesigned in a way that's tailored to fit\nyour needs so if you're interested in\nbetter understanding your mind and\ntaking control of your life check out\nthe link below and what I want to share\nwith you all today is fascinating\nbecause if we think about monks\nall monks will break their bad habits\nright if you go to a monastery that has\n300 monks none of them will smoke none\nof them will drink they will all wake up\nat 4am every single day and if you sort\nof think about it does that mean that\nonly disciplined people can become monks\nno the monks do something very very\nspecific they learn how to break bad\nhabits and it works for 100 of them and\nwe're going to teach that to you today\nso we have to start by understanding how\na habit forms so generally speaking when\nI engage in a behavior for the first\ntime\nand it's pleasurable or there's some\nkind of positive reinforcement of it\nthat is governed by dopamine so anytime\nI have fun my brain releases dopamine\nthat sort of reinforces the behavior\nright so if I eat a tasty food and I\nlike it it's pleasurable I will want to\neat it again over time though what\nhappens in our brain changes a little\nbit so at the beginning when a behavior\nis new it's governed by dopamine and we\nreinforce that behavior but over time\nour brain actually activates a\ncompletely different circuit which is\nactually the cannabinoid circuit or the\nHabit circuit and so you may have sort\nof noticed this that when you start\ndoing things habitually you don't gain\nthe same pleasure from them I certainly\nnoticed this when I was struggling with\nvideo game addiction and when I started\nplaying a game it was like lots of fun\nbut over time I stopped enjoying the the\ngame but it almost became habitual like\nI couldn't stop even though I wasn't\nhaving fun the first half hour or maybe\nhour I enjoyed it but an hour three hour\nfour hour five I'm not even enjoying it\nbut I can't stop the behavior and at\nthis point what's happened is that sort\nof Behavioral reinforcement has moved\ninto this automatic mode this is our\nhabit circuitry is actually governed by\na completely different neurotransmitter\nwhich are endocannabinoids those are the\nsame things that are involved with\nmarijuana but our body produces them\nit's kind of complicated we don't need\nto get into it the point is that at that\npoint the behavior is not being\npositively reinforced by dopamine once\nour cannabinoid system activates this is\nwhat becomes a habit so we sort of do it\nautomatically do we do it without\nthinking about it now that we understand\nhow habits form let's dive into a little\nbit of precisely what a habit is so a\nhabit is an unconscious Behavior right\nby definition if I have a habit of doing\nsomething like let's say I have a habit\nto like itch my arms the whole point is\nthat it's unconscious I don't think\nabout doing it it is an automatic\nbehavior and then we run into a slight\nproblem because if we try to change the\nHabit what do we end up doing we try to\ncontrol it using a third part of our\nbrain which is our frontal lobes so our\nfrontal lobes are sort of the master\ncontrol system of the brain when you're\nfeeling negative emotions and you force\nyourself to do something that's your\nfrontal lobes being active when we have\na bad habit that we're trying to control\nthat's our frontal lobes exerting that\nkind of control but the basic problem\nthat we run into is that our habits are\nformed through pleasure right so when I\nenjoy something over time if I do it\nevery day it will become a habit the\nbasic problem with Breaking Bad Habits\nis that I'm not recruiting the same\ncircuitry so when I try to restrain\nmyself from let's say eating a piece of\ncake or eating french fries there's no\npleasure there's no dopamine so there's\nno behavioral reinforcement and so this\nis why people tend to fail at Breaking\nBad Habits because there's nothing\nenjoyable about them and so you may stop\nand think and you may think okay so now\nthis guy is going to teach us how to\nmake unfun things fun which we can\nabsolutely do but we're actually going\nto teach you a secret trick that monks\nuse okay\nso what do monks do let's understand\nthis so monks break all of their bad\nhabits but it's not like they do lots of\npleasurable stuff right so that's\nactually not what they do what they do\nis recruit a completely different\ncircuit a third circuit which is related\nto The frontal lobes what monks actually\ndo is are they're hyper aware of all of\ntheir actions so all they do is become\naware now how does this help let's think\nabout it right so remember that a habit\nis an unconscious action if I take the\naction consciously literally in my brain\nit is no longer a habit we're using\ndifferent parts of the brain and I'm not\neven using willpower to control the\nHabit I'm not trying to restrain myself\nand not eat the cake what monks actually\nstart with is very very intentional\nusage of their bad habits so when I was\nstudying to become a monk I had a\nteacher who sort of like taught me this\nprinciple by overcoming their addiction\nto potato chips\nso they sort of it's kind of bizarre\nright but this is what bugs struggle\nwith so one of my teachers like\nstruggled with being addicted to potato\nchips and they would resist for a while\nbut eventually they'd have to leave the\nmonastery and they'd have to go into\ntown and in India like on the on the\nside of the road you have people who are\nfrying fresh potato chips and so like\nthis person would smell these like fresh\nfried potato chips in someone's high\ncollaring right it smells like so good\nlike the smell of fresh fried food and\nthis is the only thing that this guy\nmakes so it's like absolutely delicious\nright because he's a master all he does\nis fry potato chips all day long every\nday 365 days a year and So eventually my\nteacher would cave and he'd eat the\npotato chips so he went to his Guru and\nhe asked him\nhow do I overcome this this is the one\nthing that I can't break and what his\nteacher told him was actually kind of\nbizarre he said don't resist the craving\nat all just eat potato chips with full\nawareness anytime you want a potato chip\neat it and he actually told them that\ninstead of just buying one bag and\nresisting I want you to buy three bags\nof potato chips eat one when you're out\nin town and bring the other two back to\nthe monastery keep them with you at all\ntimes and the moment you want to eat one\ngive in to it but give into it with\nawareness pay attention to what does\nthis craving look like how do I want the\nthe potato chip to taste is my mouth am\nI salivating is my mouth watering when\nyou eat the potato chip do you enjoy it\nand what happens to the desire after\nengage with the potato chip with full\nawareness\nand this is literally what monks do they\ndon't practice restraining themselves\nwhat they really practice is cultivating\nawareness and the cool thing about it is\nthat the moment that you take an action\nwith awareness you are no longer\noperating in that habit circuitry you're\nchipping away at that habit circuitry\nand this is what's happening kind of\nneuroscientifically in the brain which\nwe understand from people with\naddictions so when people have\naddictions where we sort of figured out\nand this is something I learned\nclinically is that people with\naddictions are not aware of what they're\ndoing so I'll have patients who will be\nsober for six months and they'll come in\none week and they'll say I don't know\nwhat happened doc I just woke up and\nthen I slipped up right I just started\ndrinking again I have no idea what\ntriggered it and if you look at\nNeuroscience studies of people who have\naddictions they lack they have a lack of\nawareness of their internal emotional\nstate so what's literally happening with\npeople with addictions is they'll try to\nbreak the Habit right that's really what\nan addiction is it's a really powerful\nhabit and so what they'll do is resist\nwith willpower over time but eventually\nthey'll slip up because over that six\nmonth period at some point stress is\ngoing to start increasing at some point\nthere's conflict within their\nrelationship they're worried about\ngetting fired or getting promoted or\ntheir friends aren't inviting them to\nstuff so that's internal stress builds\nup and as that internal stress builds up\nthey're not really aware of it and then\neventually the stress gets so bad that\nthey have to use something like alcohol\nas a coping mechanism but the whole\npoint is that people with addictions are\nblind to this process and this is why\nscientifically mindfulness is so helpful\nwith addictions and the cool thing about\nmindfulness is that it doesn't work in\nthe way that other things work so we\nknow that for example Alcoholics\nAnonymous or peer support is effective\nfor addictions we know certain\nmedications are effective for addictions\nwe also know that like Psychotherapy is\neffective for addictions but all those\nthree things work in different ways when\nI'm doing psychotherapy the patient they\nmay have some sort of deep-rooted trauma\nwhich causes them to sort of engage with\nalcohol as like a coping mechanism but\nmindfulness Works in a completely\ndifferent way all it really does is\nraise awareness\nand so what's happening in the brain\nwhen we raise awareness so literally\nwhat's happening is right now when we\ntry to control a behavior our frontal\nlobe is trying to control or restrain\nthat habit okay so if you struggle with\nbad habits the basic problem is that the\nconnection between your frontal lobes\nand your habit circuitry is very small\nit's like a small straw so we have to\nuse a lot of willpower or a lot of\nenergy to regulate that kind of habit\ninstead every time we do something with\nawareness even if you fail and this is\nwhere people trip up they say oh I\nfailed at controlling the habit I\nscrewed up but if you do it with\nawareness the goal is not actually to\nsucceed or even like stop the the\nbehavior at all the goal is every time\nyou do it with awareness you are\nincreasing the size of your straw you're\nliterally strengthening the connections\nbetween your frontal lobe and your habit\ncircuitry and we don't even need\npleasure we don't need to use the\ndopamine circuit at all and this is\nprecisely what monks do so as they\nstrengthen those connections they\nincrease the size of their straw and\nthen what ends up happening is they\ndon't need to use a lot of energy or\nwillpower to break a habit and this is\nthe secret through which monks actually\nbreak all of their habits they don't\nactually focus on controlling anything\nthey don't focus on developing a lot of\nwillpower they are not naturally\ndisciplined people right because if you\nthink about monks there's 300 of them\nand they have a methodology that they\nteach to each and every monk who when\nthey enter the monastery is a normal\nhuman being and at the end of this\nmethodology by using this these\ntechniques you have 300 people who are\nfree of all of their addictions\nso if you're struggling with a bad habit\nwhat I would strongly recommend is that\nyou engage in the habit with awareness\nand this is also where you've got to be\nkind of careful because even if you\nscrew up even if you're not able to\nresist the piece of cake or using the\ncell phone or something like that try to\nGarner as much awareness as you can when\nyou use it just notice like look at it\nand say like oh wow like I really want\nto use this phone right now and it seems\ntoo hard to stop so let me use it it's\nokay or if you're trying to eat\nsomething pause for a second and like\nlook at that piece of cake and be like\nokay\nI really want to eat this let's see how\nit tastes and the cool thing is that as\nyou do that over and over and over again\nyou will be strengthening this\nconnection between your frontal lobe and\nyour habit circuitry and then you will\ndiscover this Tipping Point which is\nexactly what happened to me and this is\nwhy I decided to become a monk in the\nfirst place is I struggled so much with\nvideo game addiction all these bad\nhabits and I went to India and I was\nlike wow this is amazing like suddenly\nthings are becoming easier for me\ncontrolling my own behaviors and my bad\nhabits are starting to feel easy to\nhandle and so each time you do something\nwith awareness what ends up happening is\nyou're chipping away at that bad habit\nand eventually you'll hit this Tipping\nPoint and suddenly you will need a very\nsmall amount of willpower to actually\nenact a strong behavioral change so\ndefinitely try this out and cultivate\nawareness and even if you screw up not a\nbig deal just wake up the next day and\ncultivate more awareness\n[Music]\nthank you"
