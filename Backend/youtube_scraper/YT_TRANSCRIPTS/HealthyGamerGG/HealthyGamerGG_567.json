    "transcript": "be awkward by being quiet be awkward by\ntalking okay I'm gonna teach y'all how\nto not be awkward when your attention is\nin your own head you will be awkward and\nwhen your attention is not in your own\nhead you will be relaxed there's a very\nsimple experiment you can run think\nabout walking while you walk now I'm\ngonna put my right foot forward now I'm\ngoing to lift my knee now I'm going to\ndo this now I'm going to relax my I'm\ngoing to put the plantar surface of my\nfoot down now the heel is going to touch\nthink about all of the steps as you walk\nand you will become the most awkward\nWalker in existence so this is the\ntricky thing is that when you try not to\nbe awkward where's your attention it is\nin your mind you are trying not to be\nawkward you're not doing the thing now\nI'm I'm thinking about how to do things\nso I'm awkward over here now I'm\nthinking about this so I'm even more\nawkward so this is why getting awkward\nis such a trap because the less awkward\nyou try I to be the more you step into\nyour mind and the more Awkward you\nbecome it's like oh my God there's a\nfire here quick someone grabs some\ngasoline and pour the gasoline on top\nlet's put out the fire because liquid\nputs out fire right you do the very\nthing that makes you awkward and that's\nhow you end up with this lose-lose\nsituation you think that okay if I'm\nquiet I will not be awkward or if I talk\nI will not be awkward no the awkwardness\nis within you so no matter what you do\nyou will be awkward but this is the\nreally cool thing if it's within you you\ncan actually change it it's not about\nthe behavior it's not about okay what do\nI say or what do I not say how do I be\nquiet should I speak now should I not\nspeak now and that's what makes you\nawkward because now you're in your own\nhead and you're not paying attention to\nthe conversation so if you want to stop\nbeing awkward absorb your mind in\nwhatever is around you instead of\nthinking about what you should say or\nwhether you should say something pay\nattention to what the other person is\nsaying listen to the other other person\nlisten to your surroundings externalize\nyour awareness and then you will not be\nawkward and if we sort of think about it\nwe can see that we can prove it the\nother way too when am I the least\nawkward when I'm absorbed in something\nlike if I get into bed at night and I\ngrab a nice cool pillow and I lay down\nand I'm like man this feels amazing I'm\nnot thinking about okay how can I feel\nmore comfortable is this comfortable\nenough is this not comfortable enough if\nmy attention is on the pillow and on the\nbed I will feel relaxed and it'll feel\ngood and this is why people stay so\nawkward is because everyone's like what\ndo I do it is not about doing it is\nabout where your attention is and so\npeople go looking for Solutions but any\nsolution you try your mind is still\nthinking about okay I should do this I\nshould do this I should do this I should\ndo this your mind is pointing in the\nwrong way so you end up being awkward\nand then what happens we end up feeling\nhopeless because I tried this and I\ntried this and I tried this and I\nwatched this video and I paid for this\ncourse and this pickup artist told me to\ndo this but the whole time all that crap\ndoesn't work because your mind is still\nfocused here and even for the stuff that\ndoes work what do they successfully help\nyou do externalize your mind Focus\nexternally that's all it takes still got\nno social skills even when I don't think\nabout myself I mean I'm sure that's true\nto a certain extent I mean I think\nyou've got some social skills y'all are\ndoing great over here and then if you\nguys want more practical advice so if\nyou're paying attention to a\nconversation you're trying to figure out\nhow do I jump in body language is really\ngood so I'll show you all this feels\n[ __ ] awkward until you practice it\nbut you can just go like this yo you can\nhold up a hand it works really well the\nother thing you can is hey can I jump in\nfor a second this reminds me of dot dot\ndot so you just signal to them hey I'm\njumping in use body language right and\nthen they'll stop it's really bizarre\nit's like there's some [ __ ] Jedi mind\ntrick at play you can even interrupt\nsomeone but if you when you interrupt\nsomeone if you're afraid of interrupting\nbecause here's what happens right so\nthere's like some awkward there's like\nthey say a sentence and there's a pause\nbut the pause isn't long enough for you\nto jump in so they don't wait for you to\nspeak so you're not sure if you're\nsupposed to speak and then you start\nspeaking and they start speaking at the\nsame time and then you're like well [ __ ]\nlike what do I say so here's the thing\nyou want to ride over them but you want\nto ride over them with a acknowledgment\nso if you and someone else are speaking\nat the same time what you should say is\nhey I I'd love to share something with\nyou and if you start saying that and\nthey start speaking you just plow\nthrough because then you're kind of\nsignaling them hey like I'm speaking\nhere and it sort of makes it okay to\nlike get them like if they stop talking\nright because cause you don't want to\nride over someone with your story you\njust want to acknowledge it does that\nkind of make sense like you kind of want\nto plow through right but but since\nyou're plowing through and you're\nacknowledging that you're plowing\nthrough it makes it okay and and that's\nalso where like you can say like oh wow\nlike that reminds me of a story and then\nif someone else starts speaking you can\nsay like you can either gesture to them\nright like do you want to go first and\nthen like they'll gesture to you it's\nlike use gestures like hand signals this\nis like the mark the martial arts of the\nHG way is like the interruption this is\nthe block and and this is the the giving\nthe block and the giving and then\nand then you can also go like this if\nyou're like really upset with them go\nahead please the other problem with\npeople who are super socially anxious is\nthey're like oh my God I don't know what\nto say I don't know what to say I don't\nknow what to say this person when should\nI start start talking this person is\ntalking so much socially anxious people\nstruggle with socially oblivious people\nthis is what creates your anxiety the\nmore like a socially anxious person is\nhyper aware and the socially oblivious\nperson is hypo aware and these two\nthings fit really together because if\nsomeone is socially aware they're going\nto acknowledge they're going to\nrecognize that hey I should stop talking\nat some point so that this other person\ncan jump in the problem is that socially\nanxious people think that they're\nscrewing up but that's because they're\nsocially oblivious person you're talking\nto who doesn't like think about when you\nshould speak and that a conversation is\nbetween two people so stop beating\nyourselves up if someone else doesn't\nknow how to talk and it's not something\nthat we don't acknowledge right so like\nright now when we think about social\nanxiety we're like oh my God it's a\nproblem in me fix me fix me fix me but\nany social interaction involves two\npeople and oftentimes socially anxious\npeople grew up with oblivious\ncommunicators you know so if you want to\nreally reduce your social anxiety find\nother people who are like attuned to you\nand that's what's really difficult is\nsometimes if you get too socially\nanxious people people people are so\nhyper attuned to each other that like\nthat doesn't work out well right because\nthey're like okay no no like you talk no\nyou talk you talk you talk you talk and\nthen two socially anxious people are\nlike they're playing tennis with like\nhere I'm gonna hit the ball across the\ncourt no you no you no you no you so the\ncool thing about social anxiety is if\nyou're like no Ewing at some point\nsomeone is like okay I will speak and\nthen you get to speak and the other\nperson is like oh thank God this person\nspoke because now that this person has\nspoke I can speak and I really want him\nto speak but I couldn't speak first\ny'all get me it's okay\nforeign"
