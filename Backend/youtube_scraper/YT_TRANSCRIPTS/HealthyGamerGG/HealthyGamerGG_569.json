    "transcript": "the stuff that makes us miserable is the\nstuff that makes us successful so if we\nlook at even things like the human brain\nthe human brain is geared for survival\nnot contentment or happiness if we look\nat what it takes to succeed that's what\nit takes to succeed not what it takes to\nbe happy completely independent stuff\nand the biggest mistake that we tend to\nmake is that we think that enjoyment is\nhappiness so we turn to dopaminergic\nthings eating good food driving nice\ncars having a nice place playing video\ngames like whatever and and this is what\nwe've seen with about 400 content\ncreators now you'll see this pattern\nwhere it's like they're so good at\nflagellating themselves towards success\nthey will sacrifice everything and at\nthe top of the list is their mental\nwell-being that's the first thing to go\nand it's the thing that they will trade\nout as much as possible I'm willing to\nsacrifice my internal well-being for\nexternal accomplishment"
