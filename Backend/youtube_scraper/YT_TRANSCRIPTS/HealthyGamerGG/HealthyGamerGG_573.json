judgmental which\nI know is kind of weird we want to be\njudgmental with compassion which I know\nmay be confusing for people\nso let's go ahead and hop in\nuh\num ready\nlet's do it chat\nchat Lords hello\ncan you just count to ten for me\nto count to ten for me\nokay awesome\nuh try one more time\none two three four five six okay awesome\nI'm gonna just turn you up a little bit\ntry now oh one two three four okay\nawesome that's great I just need to\nchange one other thing\nbecause for some reason\nthis thinks that you are the Surgeon\nGeneral of the United States\njust kind of fix that\noh well was that unclear yeah I think\nthat explains so much\nah that makes sense I'm gonna have to\nadd some spaces\nalso thank you chat for helping me count\nto 10 I forgot a couple numbers in there\nyeah we're going to be learning all\nkinds of stuff today like how how to\ncount maybe past ten\nI've never gotten that far\nthat's well this is what we do here we\npush push the boundaries and learn new\nstuff so\nthis is so cool I did um yeah so can you\ncan you start by telling us what you\nprefer to be called\nsure so uh my name is Misty\num I am a Minecraft Youtuber my pronouns\nare she they so just anything that's not\nhe pretty much\num my identity is an androsexual Demi\ngirl which essentially just means I'm\nnon-binary but I like guys and there's\njust specific terminology for that okay\nso can you and is there anything in\nparticular we're talking about today\num I jotted down a couple notes but\num just in general the reason so why I'm\nhere is I saw you guys made a channel\npost saying you're looking for people to\ntalk to absolutely I thought since it's\npride month why not volunteer myself\nthank you very much for doing that yeah\nof course\num people got in touch and here I am but\num mainly\num I've watched a lot of your videos for\na couple years now but as someone that\nstruggled with LGBT issues I noticed you\ndidn't have too many videos like that on\nhere so I just wanted to try and help\nyou get something going for that\nCommunity because I've always liked your\nvideos but you never had the specific\nstuff I was after so maybe I can help\nsome people out today we'll see yeah\nthat's awesome all right so Misty I\nreally really appreciate that and I\nthink that um you highlighted a couple\nof really important things so a lot of\ntimes you know the the quote unquote\nvideos that we make are based on the\npeople that we talk to and our goal here\nis to understand the lived experience of\ndifferent people on the Earth\nyeah and so I'm really grateful for you\nbeing here today and um is there\nanything in particular about so I you\nknow I can ask a bunch of questions but\nis there a particular place that\num or particular things that you were\nhoping to share today\nuh sure so some things I just thought of\nleading up to this is that um\nfor creators specifically there's a lot\nof fear of coming out as the Creator\nwhich is something I did just a couple\nweeks ago oh wow um oh thank you\num there's a lot of misgendering issues\nin the space which can be difficult to\ndeal with which I'm still not positive\nbut maybe we can work through that\num there's a lot of just harassment in\ngeneral which obviously of course\num so like one thing is I don't neces\nlike my face isn't like hidden like I\nhave like I've like revealed my face\nbefore it's not like I need some big\nface reveal but typically it's just\nbetter just to use like an avatar like\nthis just to not get harassment even if\nlike you are perfectly like normal\nattractive whatever just there's a lot\nof stuff behind just how much people\nhate that stuff\nand then uh the last thing I had was\num that I actually have been swatted\nbecause of my identity which is\nsomething we could talk about oh my God\nthat sounds terrible\na little bit so you know Misty the first\nthing that I just kind of want to notice\nis that\nI'm hearing that in addition to all of\nthe normal difficulties of life\nlike getting out of bed and eating\nhealthy and finding motivation and\ntrying to figure out what you're doing\nwith your life you have a layer of\nadditional challenges\nthat sounds like really tough\num it can be from my perspective though\nI think I genuinely have like a really\nlucky and good life and the way I see it\nis that if this is the only thing I\nstruggle with my life's amazing compared\nto other people but I do understand it\nis a very deep issue and it is something\nI've definitely struggled with if that\nmakes sense absolutely\num so can we just start by can you\nplease explain to us some of like the\nterminology uh so can you start by\ntelling us what\nlgbtqia plus means\nsure\num so it stands for lesbian gay bisexual\ntransgender queer I think intersex and\nthen I don't know what the a is\nsomething that I've learned about uh I\njust call it like Pride or queer\nwhatever in general is that it's\nevolving so much so quickly that I don't\nthink any queer person I know fully\nknows what all of the terms mean because\nthere's so much coming out so many\npeople are exploring it it's kind of\njust you learn something new you look it\nup if that makes sense\nthat I've always wondered how do we\ndecide which\nwhich letters to include and which ones\nto not include\nI have no idea personally I've also\nwondered this that's why I again I just\nsay like the pride or like queer people\njust it's kind of like a blanket term\nand people get what you're talking about\nokay and you mentioned that you are an\nandrosexual Demi girl can you help us\nunderstand that\nyeah sure so um\nso how the gender Spectrum works is it's\nkind of like a slider between male to\nfemale well where non-binary is anything\nthat's not on either end of the spectrum\nbut then it also kind of goes down a\nlittle bit into like agender or like\nmixed gender or whatever so\num Demi girl means I'm non-binary but\nslightly on the feminine side so I'm\nkind of in the middle between male and\nfemale but slightly on the feminine side\nif that makes sense\nand then uh androsexual it gets weird\nsaying if you're straight or gay when\nyou're talking about non-binary people\nso that just means no matter what your\ngender is you like guys if that makes\nsense okay okay so you're you're\nphysically so I I see that in your in\nthe way that you describe yourself there\nis a component of what your identity is\nand what you were attracted to\nand that those two things are actually\nlike somewhat independent\nyeah can you help us understand that a\nlittle bit\nin which ways\nso\num I'm just kind of thinking of people\nwho are not very familiar with some of\nthese terminologies or experiences of\nlife and so even as you kind of\nmentioned androsexual like solves a\nproblem right because if you're gay or\nhomosexual that implies that you are\nattracted to the same gender that you\nidentify as right\nand and so the challenge though is that\nbeing attracted to the same gender\nif your gender is non-binary or fluid\nlike so you you know what does it mean\nto be a homosexual Demi girl does it\nmean that you are attracted to other\nDemi girls or what and so I was just\nkind of like alluding to the idea that\nlike\ngay and straight are kind of\nthose terms are couched in binary\ngenders\nbut I guess I I kind of explained it\na lot of it's just kind of person to\nperson like a lot of people\nwho are like a male who like a female\nmight still say they're gay just because\nit like fits with how they feel if that\nmakes sense yeah okay\nso can you tell us just a little bit\nabout yourself and what kind of growing\nup was like for you\nsure so um I come from an extremely\nreligious household I am religious\nmyself\num I recently came out a week ago\num as intersexual didn't go to online\nalthough I just told my family I'm gay\nbecause it's close enough they don't\nknow what any of that means\nand um\nin general I've known about my sexuality\nfor about nine years my gender has been\nI've been figuring it out for a couple\nyears but uh typically\nuh oh I should say that coming out to my\nfamily did go well at all went super\nnice everyone's happy Etc it didn't\nthere were no issues any of that kind of\nstuff but um I had been afraid of there\nbeing issues for a very long time\nbecause again my family is religious and\nthat's typically something that doesn't\ngo over very well in that kind of\nsituation so it definitely took me a\nlong time a lot of courage to finally\nBuild It Up but um once I did it was\nlike a big relief I could finally start\nbeing myself for the first time in\nforever over half my life\num I had to date people in secret I had\nto like not talk about anything like\nrelating to LGBT stuff in case they\nwould like get a hint or something\nthere's a very anxiety filled if that\nmakes sense so it sounds like you were\nhiding\nyeah the way I've uh described it before\nis it kind of feels like you're in like\nthat old like spy movie where like oh\nyou're like the Russian spy and they're\ntrying to figure out you can't leave any\ntraces\nyeah so what's it like to grow up and\nkind of be a spy in your own life\nyeah um\nit's just mainly\nyou just can't really do anything like I\ncouldn't use any dating apps for fear\nthat someone would find it and show a\nfamily member or like if I did a live\nstream I couldn't comment on like\nsomeone I thought was attractive because\nmaybe one of my family members kids is\nwatching and they'll tell and that'll go\nall up escalated\nall right just any of that kind of stuff\nlike if I had\num a boyfriend I couldn't like have him\naround or like meet my family we'd have\nto like go out somewhere in secret and\nthen be back before a certain time or\nwhatever\nand do you remember what kind of like so\nI'm sort of seeing that you're\nplanning your life around preventing\ninformation getting out is that fair to\nsay\nI can agree yeah it definitely feels\nlike what I've done yeah so I I mean\nwhat kind of scenarios were you\nenvisioning like when you would do those\nkinds of things right like let's say\nusing a dating app like what were what\nwas going on in your head about like\nwhat would happen\nuh in my head so I I just couldn't use\ndating apps because it's kind of like a\nbuilt-in paranoia if that makes sense\nbut uh essentially like I would just\nEnvision like oh someone's scrolling\nthrough Tinder and then they see me and\nthey see that I'm looking for men and\nthen they show someone they know and\nthen that person knows a family member\nis I have a very large family in a very\nsmall area and so there's like a lot of\npeople that it could actually get to\nand does that make sense yeah it does so\nI'm kind of curious like what did you\nhave like kind of thoughts about what\nwould happen if someone did see\noh I see what you mean\num yeah I would just assume that it\nwould go over a lot worse if they found\nout from someone else where I wasn't\neven prepared to talk about it rather\nthan me to be prepared and tell them\nindividually myself which is definitely\nwhat I think you should do so how I came\nout was I just worked up person to\nperson from like the most important\npeople in my life to just like my\ngeneral family not as if they're not\nimportant but you know what I mean yeah\nand uh just individually talking through\ntell them hey this is what's going on\num Etc whereas if they just found out\nfrom like their little cousin who had a\nphone and looked at a website\nI feel like that wouldn't go over well\nyeah so like what so what I'm sort of\nimagining Misty is that there may be\nlots of people out there who are\nlistening to this conversation and will\nlisten to this conversation in the\nfuture and I think we talk about\nin a general sense like coming out but I\nthink that my experience at least as a\nmental health professional like working\nwith people around this stuff is that\nthere's like you know we just use two\ntwo words coming out and it's kind of\nbinary but my experience is that there's\nactually like a whole pile of thoughts\nfears behaviors that can like grow over\nthe course of years and in your case it\nsounds like you know you've been you've\nbeen uh sort of exploring this for like\nat least a decade or about a decade\num and so what I was hoping to do is\nunderstand you know a little bit more\ncolor about your experience because I\nimagine that they're going to be people\nwho can relate to those details\nyeah okay\num so one thing that actually helped me\nwas since I've been a growing content\ncreator I got a bunch of opportunities\nin June this year for pride month such\nas YouTube wanted to feature me on their\nChannel I got invited to a big uh Pride\nMinecraft tournament Etc and this was\nall happening like the very beginning of\nJune so what pushed me to come out was\num all this happening and my family is\nlike\ninto like my YouTube stuff they watched\nall my videos and Etc so I went to them\nand said hey just so you know I got\nthese amazing opportunities you're gonna\nsee this I just wanted to let you know\nbeforehand to hear it from me and not\nfrom them because I think one of the\nbiggest things you can do when coming\nout is let them know that you do respect\nhow they feel so if you say like\num I understand you may not understand\nwhat I'm doing you may not like uh like\nit it might not make you happy but I\ndon't want to hurt you I just want you\nto know that this is what makes me happy\nand let me know if there's anything I\ncan do to like help you along this\nprocess or Etc if that makes sense yeah\nthat makes a lot of sense so I'm\nnoticing already that the way that you\ncame out was not antagonistic\nand that's very important and respecting\ntheir beliefs because I I know a lot of\npeople will sort of consider some\nbeliefs backwards and whatnot but I'm\nnot hearing you really do that\nso like my uh grandma is probably the\nmost religious person so I made sure\nthat when I came out to her I was like I\nstill like love God I'm like will\nprobably still go to church now and then\nlike it doesn't affect any of that this\nis just who I am and I understand it's\nnot fully in line with your stuff but I\nhope you can learn to accept me because\nI am not gonna let it like change who I\nam this is just a fact if that makes\nsense\num is it do you feel comfortable if I\nask you a little bit more detail about\nyour family's reactions of course so\nlike what did your grandma say\nit went very well she was like I\nunderstand thank you for telling me that\nI still love you I'll always love you\njust you're always welcome in my house\nmake sure you ever need anything call me\nwow it went pretty quick which that was\nway better than I expected yeah what\nwere you afraid was going to happen\num I was afraid to like start like\nreally crying so like Oh no you're going\nto hell\nbut uh I mean maybe that will be for\nsome people it could be very case to\ncase but according to my grandparents\num that when they both talked to both of\nthem uh they were kind of just like not\ntoo surprised because again I had been I\nhad known for over about nine years that\nI'm some kind of queer and so I have\nbeen slowly like dropping hints like\nI've painted my nails and stuff like\nthat and they were kind of like yeah\nthere there were the signs so I think it\ndoes help that it kind of eased them\ninto it if that makes sense and and so\nwhat what were some of the other signs\nthat they had sort of picked up on\num I think I am kind of flamboyant my\nvoice has gotten higher pitched over\ntime\num I've had no interest in women for a\ndecade or kind of ever\num if that makes sense\nyeah and how does your voice get higher\npitched over time\nuh so a lot of my YouTube stuff is vocal\ntraining and I do a lot of voice acting\nso I've just like done a lot of training\nand tried to get to a voice that I feel\nis\nmore suitable for me if that makes sense\nsure and and what do you mean by\nflamboyant what does that look like\nI haven't really noticed it myself but\nlike my friends have told me I do like\nlike the gay hand gestures or something\nif that makes sense yeah I I I mean I I\nhave certain stereotypes in my mind but\nyeah no I get it\num\nokay so so I I guess some of your\nmannerisms are not I guess what we could\ncall traditionally masculine is that\nfair to say\ngreen yeah and and so your voice changes\nsomewhat you also kind of uh will paint\nyour nails which I as as I understand\nI'm I'm you know joining the boomer\ngeneration very quickly but I understand\nthat painting nails is not even like\nrelated to being queer in any way now is\nthat yeah okay I mean it is to them\nprobably because right no one else they\nknow does it\nand so um\nthat sounds really fantastic uh Misty I\nI think uh\nyou know and I I may accidentally\nmisgender you for which I apologize but\nI'm gonna do my best\num but that sounds fantastic that you've\nyou know that you're it sounds like you\nrespect your family a lot your family\nrespects you a lot and that the coming\nout process uh was sort of if I can kind\nof summarize was like first of all not\nso you started out as a spy but then you\nstarted dropping hints or maybe not\ndropping hints so much as like restrain\nyour paranoia a little bit so I'm kind\nof curious about that like when you\ndecided to paint your nails what was\ngoing on in your head and like what did\nyou think could happen\nuh well everything I've done I've had\nlike an excuse for so the reason I\nstarted painting my nails was it was the\nyear my YouTube channel started blowing\nup and for Halloween I cosplayed my\ncharacter\nand so you see I have like the green and\norange eyes that's like a big part of my\nbrand I made my right hand green nails\nin my left hand orange nails for the\ncostume and then uh they were like oh\nthat's funny you did your nails for your\ncostume and then I just kept doing it\nand they kind of like didn't realize and\nthey're like oh I guess this is just a\nthing now\njust kind of again easing people into it\nhas made it a lot easier for me at least\nyeah so I mean it's it's so interesting\nhow how much you have to calculate\nyeah I mean it could just be me I don't\nknow but that's kind of how I see most\nsituations yeah so you okay so you're\nkind of easing them into it and then it\nsounds like you mentioned that like\nworking up the courage can you help us\nunderstand what that\nwhat that looks like or how that like\nhow does one do that\num that's a great question because it\ntook me so long but\num it's kind of\nI don't think anyone really just like\nsnaps their fingers and comes out I\ndon't think that's how it works so like\nmy friends like my close friends have\nknown since I did about all this I've\nalways kept them updated my mom's kind\nof known for about eight years I kind of\nwaited a little bit to tell her but\neventually talked to her she understood\nand then like as people came into my\nlife the more I like trusted them\noutside my family I would tell them\nuntil eventually I got this big\nopportunity and use that to come out but\num that's how you go so so your your mom\nhas known that you're androsexual but\ndid you refer to it as androsexual eight\nyears ago\num I just referred to it as gay but I\ndidn't know what my gender was and and\nwhat was that can you tell us a little\nbit about what that conversation looked\nlike or how you worked up to it\nI can think but again it's been like\neight years yeah\num it was just kind of like a hey I need\nto have a serious talk with you I've\nbeen feeling like this for a while she\nalso wasn't surprised back then she had\nkind of a similar reaction to my grandma\nlike snow this doesn't change anything\nstill love you Etc\nokay and I'm kind of noticing that like\na big part of how you pitch it is that\nso oftentimes I think families who don't\nunderstand will sort of think of you as\none kind of person and so when you come\nout to them\nyou become a different person I agree\nand they sort of try to hold on to their\nold impression of you and like that's\nthe real you Misty and maybe you're sick\nor something like that\num and so if we like help you enough you\ncan return back to the quote unquote\nreal you\none thing that I I noticed in your\nlanguage which I think is actually\nreally really cool is that\nyou say this is who I am this is who\nI've always been and so it's sort of\nlike owning like I am this\nand\nI I don't know how else to describe it\nbut I think there's there's just a lot\nof because when I think about people\ncoming out and sort of explaining\num issues of gender identity or\num sexual attraction that are not\nheteronormative\nlike it's kind of weird right because we\nhave like guides or like videos or\nresources of like how to make a resume\nand how to like go on a job interview\nbut no one ever tells us like this is\nhow you come out to your family yeah\nand and so that's what I really\nappreciate about everything you're kind\nof sharing and why I'm asking for\ndetails\nthey appreciate you asking us because I\nwould have loved this video like\nlike two three years ago yeah and so\nthat's why we're doing it right so we're\ntwo or three years too late but\nhopefully not too late for everyone\nwho's watching\num were there other things so you\nmentioned kind of working up the courage\nso it sounds like you started disclosing\nsome information about yourself like\nyears ago so is there are there other\nthings that you can share with us about\nthis kind of working up the courage\num well I think one of the best things\nyou can do is uh during college they had\nlike a counseling service you could go\nto for free is like part of the tuition\nand so I was going there specifically to\nlike an LGBT counselor and uh she was\nhelping me walk through stuff and work\nout courage and\num\nthat was kind of a good thing I feel\nlike since there is such a lack of\ninformation I think just finding an\nexpert on the topic if you can afford it\nsadly a lot of people can't afford it\num can help you a bunch like I have a\ncounselor I saw a couple weeks ago for\nwhen I was coming out and she helped me\na ton with like how to go about\neverything the process like uh working\non like a script I could use for each\nperson wow so you guys like literally\nlike thought about a script and worked\nthrough a script what if it's okay if\nyou feel comfortable sharing what were\nsome of the other things what is what is\nworking on look like or mean\nI was afraid my family would be like\nupset or maybe angry or whatever she\nmainly kept me working on like it will\nbe okay even if it goes wrong it's not\nthe end of the world like regardless\nyour family will still love you Etc they\njust kind of have every insurance that\nlike you can do it it's okay it's not\ngoing to be as big of a deal as you\nthink it is\num and she was right about everything\nshe told me so\nyeah and do you have a sense of where\num your counselor's confidence came from\nI'm just telling her about my family\nbecause we talk a couple times she's\nlike so you want to come out to your\ngrandpa tell me what he's like or how he\nfeels and then I tell her that and then\nshe's like okay I think he'll be\nperfectly fine I think Etc\nMr cat can I uh think for a second sure\nany questions for me\num\nI think my only question for you would\nbe if you had questions for me I have\nmore questions I have a ton of questions\nfor you okay perfect\num I was just kind of jotting down\nbecause I like I was kind of saying\nno one teaches us how to come out\num and oftentimes like it's it's so to\nthe public it's so binary right like\nyou've come out and then it's kind of\nlike done but what I'm sort of really\nappreciating about hearing your story uh\nis that it's like one hell of a process\nit's anything but binary even in terms\nof like self-determination and figuring\nout who you are and what you're\nattracted to in the way that you talk to\npeople and I think that like\nI think\nhearing kind of the pieces and I I may\ntry to summarize towards the end and\nkind of run by you what I've actually\nended ended up hearing and almost like I\nwonder if by the end of this call we can\nhave like a 10 minute how-to on how to\ncome out because that I think could be\nincredibly helpful for people what do\nyou think\nI I do think it's extremely Case by case\nand everybody has their own best way to\ndo it but I still think like a general\nguidelines can't hurt absolutely\nuh so the next question that I've got\nfor you is how do you how did you know\nthat you're androsexual\num I've just never liked girls and I've\nalways liked guys so even as a kid I had\nI think like five girlfriends up to\nmiddle school but the only reason I had\ngirlfriends is because I watched\ncartoons and the main character wants a\ngirlfriend and then he's cool and so I\nthought oh I need a girlfriend and then\nI'll be cool and like you know that's\njust kind of how it works but I was\nnever really interested in them hold on\nyou had five girlfriends up until middle\nschool\nso you were like a mega Chad bro in\nelementary school I guess you could say\nthat yeah\nso that's really interesting so as a\nscientist I wonder actually how common\nthat is I wonder if\nprepubescent romantic relationships with\nwomen is actually like I wonder if that\ncorrelates with being Andrew sexual\nit could be interesting I don't know\nokay so so you had a lot and and how\nwhat was that like like how do you even\nget a girlfriend in like the third grade\nor fourth grade\nI think you're just kind of like hey you\nwant to be my girlfriend and they're\nlike sure and then you like sit at lunch\ntogether\nthat's so interesting because because I\nwas hilarious but I'm sort of like\nthinking about my own experience right\nand and how like if you're actually a\nheterosexual man asking a girl out is\nvery terrifying\nand and I wonder if the lack of sexual\nattraction or romantic interest actually\nmakes it such so much more easier or\ncasual\nI think you might be 100 right I've\nnever thought about that but it\ndefinitely feels like that makes sense\nso when you were like in elementary\nschool did you what was your\nrelationship with with boys like\num\nnormal okay so you had like friends and\nstuff it's not like you were so you had\ngirlfriends but it's not like most of\nyour friends were women\nand then what happened in Middle School\nwhat was that like\n[Music]\nquestioning before like\na lot of time like I'd see like a\ncartoon character or someone that I'd\nlike really like or something and then\nuh I think it was I watched the Wizards\nof Waverly Place and there was a\ncharacter named Justin Russo and I'd\nalways thought he was super cute and I\njust never really put it into words\nbecause that wasn't in my mind that was\nsomething I could think\nand then eventually around High School\nsometime\num I was with some of my friends I don't\nremember the conversation but\num I I found out that it's not normal to\nlike find in terms of like\nheterosexuality to find uh men\nattractive and so we were like in the\ncar and I said like isn't it weird how\nlike sometimes you just find guys\nattractive and they're like no\nand I was like wait is this what\nand that's when I started exploring it a\nlittle more I I once worked with someone\num who\nwas a heterosexual man who said that\nthey had a penis fetish they're like I'm\nnot gay I just have a fetish for penises\nthat's kind of funny and I was like\nokay\nI was not quite sure how to interpret\nthat but I was like bro you might be gay\nhe's like nah man I just have a fetish\nfor penises you know it's like they just\nturned me on and I'm like what do you\nthink the definition of gay is\nI can't blame him you know I I still\ndon't know I mean it's possible it was\nbisexual he was you know not too\ninterested in self-exploration and he\nfound\nhe found a\num what how what can we say we he found\na\nexplanation that worked for him so even\nto this day I I try really hard to not\nbe judgmental but I kind of noticed that\nlike I'm being judgmental about it but\nanyway\num okay so it sounds like you just you\njust sort of thought boys were cute and\nI mean in terms of like so it sounds\nlike you also just didn't find girls\nattractive or you did or what\num I've never found women attractive no\nif I do it's because I like imagined\nmyself like in their position with like\na hot guy or something\num\nso that's actually uh is it okay if we\ntalk a little bit more about\nmore sexual details like I'm not going\nto go into tons of sexual details but\nthat sort of thing\num so this is also something I've seen a\nlot so can you explain what you mean by\nimagine myself at basically in the\ngirl's position when you're thinking\nabout sexual stuff right\nmm-hmm so you like and I maybe I'll just\ngo ahead and explain it because I don't\nknow how to tactfully ask you questions\nabout this while respecting boundaries\nbut this is also something that I've\nseen a fair amount when I work with\npeople who have issues of of or\nexploring maybe is a better way to put\nit\num issues of of gender identity or\nsexuality is like I'll ask actually a\nset of questions which is uh you know\nthe first question that I ask when\ntrying to help people figure out if they\nare gay or bisexual or whatever is\num you know what do you get horny about\nreally really simple question another\nreally good question that I found is\njust very very helpful this like by the\nway like we can sort of figure out\nwithin five minutes whether someone is\nor is not your mileage may vary but I\nactually find that\nwe are so shy in the way that we ask\nquestions that we actually like don't\nhelp people figure things out\nI get what you mean\num so the first thing that I'll ask is\nyou know what do you get horny about\nsecond thing I'll ask is uh oftentimes\npeople watch pornography and if they\nwatch pornography what kind of\npornography do you watch and then a\nreally really\num eye-opening question which I think\nyou alluded to is even if you watch\nheterosexual porn which\nperson do you identify with\nwhich often does oftentimes is very very\nlike eye-opening for people\num and usually those three questions\nlike we kind of figure it out if people\nif the relationship is strong enough and\nthey can be honest with themselves I\nmean that's kind of how you figure out\num so you mentioned you kind of imagined\nyourself as the woman in sexual\nscenarios and then are there other kinds\nof things that sort of helped you figure\nout that you were androsexual\num\nwell I'm not too sure because it is kind\nof like what you said so um like I do\njust end those videos I take\nspecifically the women or whatever and I\ndo of course occasionally watch\npornography\num I'm probably not gonna like give you\nlike the link to one but in general yeah\nI get that yeah that's why I just\ndecided to say my piece instead of\nasking questions yes I know what you\nmean\num but but the reason I ask is because I\nthink imagining yourself as the woman is\nactually something like really really\ncritical that no one talks about and\njust about every\nnon-heterosexual or imagining yourself\nas the\ngender that you don't identify with is\none of like the most eye-opening moments\nthat I've seen with tons of people so\nI'm looking if there's any other nuggets\nlike that that you've got I'd love to\nhear them\nyeah and I totally agree but um I'm not\nsure\nokay so it sounds like you just found\ndudes cute and things like that and then\nwere there\nokay yeah I'm not gonna\nwhile I think it could be helpful we're\nif it's okay with you we'll not ask you\nanything else about pornography or what\nyou find attractive it doesn't really\nmatter to me okay so then let me ask you\nthis I mean were there particular people\nthat you sort of it's not just physical\nattraction right so was there like sort\nof a romantic\num did you like Crush really hard on\nparticular people or fall in love or\nanything like that middle school high\nschool\num I did with book characters interested\nin like fictional books\num I don't I didn't really have any like\nguys I was like interested in until like\nearly mid College\num because something that actually\nhelped me a lot was I used to be a\ncompetitive Smash Brothers player for\nfour years in college and like 90 of\nSmash players are gay in some way so uh\nit's kind of an exaggeration but um\nthere's definitely a lot of gay people\nin the competitive smash scene and so I\njust met a lot of people during that and\nthat kind of helped me get things going\nif that makes sense sure and and can you\ntell us a little bit about what getting\nthings going looks like\num I just finally like found people I\ncould potentially be interested in\nwhether I was or not because like if\nyou're in if you're like identify as a\nmale and you like males and you like go\nout in public you can't really like look\nat people and think like oh I kind of\nlike them because they're like more\nlikely than not not going to be\ninterested in you so you kind of have\nlike your own internal checklist of like\npeople that could be potential like\npartners and I'd never really had any\nuntil I went to the scene and realized\noh there's a lot of people I could\nwhether I want to or not there's still\nlike an option I could put on this list\nand then\nyeah so and as it grows you find one\nthey're like oh I think I'll act on this\none okay so it sounds like you know\nbeing around other people\num who were almost like more openly\nnon-heterosexual or that you could have\nromantic relationships with like you\nknow that they would cons conceivably be\ninterested in you that that really\nhelped you kind of like\nI don't know I guess cultivate or let\nthose feelings out some\nI think it also helped that\num not really anyone there was religious\nand I'd been in an extremely religious\nhousehold and I still hadn't really\ninternalized to myself that it was okay\nto like men and so seeing all them like\ndate each other and all this kind of\nstuff it's kind of like oh this is like\na normal thing they're normal people\nit's not as big of a deal as I thought\nit was it kind of encouraged me to act\non it and I I'd love to hear actually a\nlittle bit about that what was it like\nto grow up religious and like think it\nwas not okay to like men\nit might take me a minute to remember\nbut um\nit was kind of just like\nI didn't necessarily think there was\nsomething wrong with me it just felt\nlike oh this is my challenge I have to\nbeat it if I want to go to heaven like\nthat makes sense\num and it was kind of like a\nwhat was the challenge that you had to\nbeat\num to not like men okay so so you kind\nof you knew you liked men and you\nthought that was something to overcome\nyeah yeah\nand how did you come to peace with that\num just that same smash story so like\nokay meeting a bunch of friends that\nwere openly intimate or women or the\nsame sex gender\num and realizing oh wait they're normal\npeople it's not a big deal it's not like\nwrong like if that makes sense and is it\nokay if I ask\num a little bit more about religion\nso it sounds like I'm guessing you\nidentify with one of the Christian or\nabrahamic faiths\nI'm Protestant Christianity\nand and so\num\nwhat is your understanding of of like\ngoing you mentioned you're religious\nright\nso is it okay if I ask you about your\nspecific religious beliefs and how you\nkind of tie those things together with\nyour sexuality and gender identity\nyeah although I do think it'd be better\nto clarify I'm more spiritual than\nreligious I'm not like uh live by the\nBible go to church but I do\nyou know like I'm spiritual yeah sure so\nactually that that clarification is\nexactly what I'd I'd like to understand\nif that's okay\nso I mean\nyou understand what you know what do you\nthink about God having spirituality life\nbeing gay like how do those two things\nintersect for you\nsure so\nperfect and whatever\nand I think if the way I put it to\nmyself is if gay is one of the worst\nthings you can be in in God's eyes and\nthat's the one thing I do wrong I'm\nalready better than 90 of people that do\nall these horrible things are like uh\none thing I've talked about with a bunch\nof therapists is that uh God never or I\nguess Jesus never disliked anybody he\nnever hated anybody even if he was being\ncrucified he said God forgive them uh I\nthink there's a lot of people like\nfamous bad people that probably would\nstill even be in heaven if that makes\nsense because the god I was taught I\nthink would have a hard time sending\nanyone to Hell really because he's if\nhe's so loving I don't see why he would\ndo that that that's a really interesting\ntake you know I I think one of the most\ninteresting things about religion and I\nthink is true of any religion is that\nthere's\nit's interesting how how easy it is to\ndeviate from some of the precepts of\nwhat the actual like religious figures\nwere saying right like\nhe probably wasn't sending anyone to\nhell and just like you said yeah quite\nthe opposite he was like you forgive\nthem for they not know not what they do\nright like I I don't get why there's so\nmany modern Christians that I know in my\nlife that are like you're a horrible\nperson get out of my church Jesus hates\nyou like have you read the Bible like I\ndon't think they know what they're\ntalking about and and how do you how do\nyou understand those people and how do\nyou deal with them\num I just ignore them\nand do you have a sense of what's going\non in their head\nuh I mean I understand where they're\ncoming from I definitely don't agree\nwith it but um it's kind of their own\nthing it's not really up to me it's\ntheir battle they need to figure out and\nand can you help us understand where\nthey're coming from or what what you\nunderstand about that\nuh well because I was kind of the same\nway because I was raised were in church\nthey say uh these gay people are\nhorrible they're going to hell they're\ninfecting all of our youth\nand when you're raised being told that\nyou're kind of like oh I guess it has to\nbe true then because that's just what\nevery important person in your life\nbecause my family is all like great\npeople all like I liked my original\nPastor as a kid I liked everyone in my\nchurch there's like this one thing\nthey're like oh yeah it's just these\npeople are bad like oh I guess they are\nokay I see so so I I'm once again Misty\nhearing a lot of uh\na lot of respect\nfrom you\nI suppose like in the sense that you're\nsort of acknowledging that these are not\nevil people it's just you recognize that\nthese are the circumstances that they\nwere brought up in and so they were just\ntaught to believe a particular thing and\nI'm not hearing you kind of demonize\nthem\nfor what they believe\nI can agree yeah\nI think that's rare\nI do too why do you think it's so rare\nbecause I think it's easier just to\nblame people and like if someone does\nsomething stupid just call them out on\nit\nwhat what makes it easier to blame\npeople\nvery clear in any way and then a bunch\nof people come up to you and start like\nharassing you I think it's pretty easy\nto say like oh they're just bad people\nthey just started harassing me for no\nreason\nor um if on the other side if you're\nlike uh race to think these people are\nhorrible and then you see them\nquotes being horrible in public like oh\nhey you're doing bad things in public\nyou shouldn't do that like it's just\nkind of\nhuman nature I guess sure how is it that\nyou're able to not blame them\npersonally for me yeah\nprobably just a lot of experience\nbecause again I I've been dealing this\nfor almost a decade now I've\nI'm sure I used to be like that\nwere you\nprobably I don't really remember hmm\nit sounds like your your family is good\nChristians\nyeah I like them\nlike them like I'm noticing that you\nknow like respect and love and and\nforgiveness\nwas something that you were really\nraised with\nand I it's so interesting right because\nI I sometimes wonder about\num kind of the fire and brimstone\nhouseholds\nand and even\nso you know one thing that's kind of\nconfusing for a lot of people or meme\nworthy for a lot of people is that\na lot of human beings who are very very\nanti-gay or\nanti-lgbtqia are actually engaging in\nhomosexual activity themselves\nyeah I've noticed that and and so it's\nreally interesting but there's a\nfascinating psychological theory of like\nreaction formation which is like so so\nwhat happens with these people is\nthey're they grow up right they have\nthese internal feelings like hey I have\na penis fetish and then when you're when\nyou're 16 or 17 and you've got a penis\nfetish and you ask your friends in the\ncar much like you did like hey do any of\nyou all sometimes have a penis fetish\nand everyone's like No And so you're\ntaught to hate homosexuality\nwhat happens is as you\nas you're taught to hate that you start\nto hate a part of yourself and there's a\nvery simple psychological mechanism\ncalled reaction formation which is that\nwe demonize in other people the things\nthat we hate about ourselves\nand so if I can like\nhate this other person a ton I can kind\nof redirect that from myself and I\nbecome okay on the inside\nbecause if it's unacceptable for me to\nbe gay but I pile enough people that\nsort of like eliminates the the gayness\nwithin me it's kind of weird but I've\nhad some experience with this but\nthere's people who know a lot more about\nit than I do kind of explained that does\nthat kind of make sense yeah I totally\nget what you're saying I've seen that\nbefore you guys I think it's very\ninteresting how it just you know there's\npeople who are very very\nanti-lgbtqia or anti-queer who are\noftentimes engaging in queer kind of\nstuff\num but anyway\nand and so uh anything that I we I know\nI've been kind of a little bit all over\nthe place is there anything that I've\nasked about or that we've talked about\nthat you wanted to share more about\notherwise I've got questions\nuh not that I can recall no okay\num can you tell us so you've shared a\nlot about a lot about your uh\nandrosexual nature and what that\nexperience is like and thank you so much\nfor doing that can you tell us a little\nbit more about the Demi girl aspect and\nhow you sort of discovered that\nyeah sure so I've never felt like the\nmale genders just perfectly fit me I\nalso don't think the female gender\nperfectly fits me either so that's why\nyou go non-binary but uh I do kind of\nlike more on the feminine side that just\nmake more sense to me or like\num I have talked to my mom in the past\nabout hey just so you know I think I've\nmight be transgender I decided against\nit but um\nstill just kind of in that like Middle\nGround\nso you know just like I I have she's one\nof my pronouns\num along with they it's non-binary\nuh do a lot of feminine things like my\nnails and stuff which and most of gender\nand gender expression is solely based\naround conception and expression if that\nmakes sense I think I said expression in\nboth terms but you get what I mean can\nyou please explain that yeah sure\num\nso like in like the United States\nwearing a skirt is like an extremely\nlike feminine thing like only people\nlike female feminine genders do that\nwhereas like if you look at like Celts\nin Scotland that could be like more of a\nmasculine thing like it really depends\non like your surroundings and what you\nare as to what your gender expression is\nit's like again I said I've said\npainting my nails is like a feminine\nthing only here like there's many places\nin the world painting your nails is like\njust like a gender neutral thing it\nreally depends on like the stuff around\nyou I think\nokay so I understand how it relates to\nexpression can you help us understand\nwhat you mean by conception\nuh in which ways so like you said that\ngender identity relates to conception\nand expression so how do you conceive of\nyourself\noh okay um\nyeah it's just kind of more\nof like what feels best to you\ninternally and like how you want people\nto react to you\nif that makes sense\nso like if you want someone to like call\nyou specific pronouns that could be a\nsign of a gender identity you don't have\nlike again there's people that are\ncompletely like uh CIS heterosexual\nnormal End quotes that uh still use\ndifferent pronouns but they're very like\nplain like like having pronouns it\ndoesn't necessarily mean your genders\nchange if that makes sense sure but um\nand and so you said that you didn't\nreally identify fully as masculine or\nfeminine can you uh help me understand\nwhat the inter like how does that work\nlike what do you feel what do you notice\nwhat do you think\nhow does one know that they don't\nidentify like what did that look like\nfor you\nI think it's just solely based on\num like just the typical\nthe word\nlike I guess stereotypes for males and\nfemales\nso like males are usually like big\nmuscly like yet dirty like trucks or\nwhatever is where I'm from and uh that's\ndefinitely not me and then girls are\nlike love pretty dresses love princess\nmovies get manicures and pedicures\nthat's a little closer to me but not\nit's also not me so I think I'm a little\nmore on that side which is where that's\nwhy I say Demi girl not just non-binary\nbut um\nas a blanket term non-binary this means\nany gender that's not 100 male or 100\nfemale or chat\nand and so what was like what was it\nlike growing up for you like how did you\nknow that you were not\nnot how did you know you were non-binary\num\nit's just kind of again kind of like a\nchoice like you can express however you\nwant and still be like a a cisgender\nlike you can be a full male who likes\nPrincess movies and Barbies like that's\njust how you can be it's just kind of a\nchoice if you want to identify with it\nor not I don't think it necessarily\nmeans like oh if you do this you have to\nbe this person\nI'm with you what I'm kind of curious\nabout is like internally\nwhat were you feeling or thinking like\nwhen you were a boy or like a kid right\ndid you think of yourself as a boy\nand when did that start to change\num\nprobably just the past few years\nhonestly it's kind of new\nyeah so I'd love to hear about what that\nJourney was like if you can articulate\nit I realize it may be hard or\nimpossible but yeah it's there's so many\nterms and they're still new to me as\nwell it's kind of hard to work around\nthem but um\nI think well as a kid I didn't even know\nother genders existed that's not\nsomething we were taught which is why I\nthink there's been such a big boom in it\nrecently is with the internet kids are\nlearning more and more at younger ages\nlike oh this is something you can be and\nthen maybe that fits with them but um\nfor me as I kind of started learning it\nI met a couple non-binary friends kind\nof like learned how stuff worked and\neventually realized like I think this\nsuits me more than anything else and I\nwould be comfortable identifying with\nthis if that makes sense and what are\nthe features that kind of suit you or\nthat feel more comfortable or\nappropriate\nI go by feeling okay so\num like there's a lot of like online\nidentity tests you can take and it'll be\nlike oh you might be this person this\nthing and then sometimes you're like you\nknow what that kind of feels right if\nthat makes sense\ninteresting okay\nso internet tests told you so you get\nkind of\nno but I mean I I can see how they can\nbe useful at sort of\nhelping you explore certain ideas or\ngive you kind of a framework to think\nabout things yeah yeah yeah\num but I I wonder if I'm not\narticulating it myself the best it's not\nsomething I had to think through before\nno that that's totally cool I mean I\nthink that as you mentioned I think you\nhave a lot more experience or maybe\nthat's not the right word but you've had\na lot more time to sort through and\nnavigate being intersexual than you have\nbeing a demi girl and so I'm sort of\nhearing that it's still kind of like a\nwork in progress for you yes I can agree\nwith them yeah so I think that makes\nsense and you know you don't have to\ngive us perfect answers to everything\nthat's even the even the Andrew sexual\npart has been so helpful and so\nenlightening well thank you I'm glad to\nhear that\num I I know at the beginning you\nmentioned a lot of stuff about\nharassment and swatting and using an\navatar uh are you interested in kind of\ntalking more about that or I have some\nother like questions for you more about\nlike General things like\num\ngender identity related stuff I'm\ncurious like what you think about things\nlike conversion therapy what do you\nthink would be a better use of our time\nuh whatever you think would be more\nhelpful to people I'm fully down for\num so let's start with like you know\nwhat's it like being a queer person in\nlife and on the internet\num in life I feel like it's not really a\nbig deal in my experience like I feel\nlike one of the big things online is\nthat no one has a face everyone can hide\nbehind a mask and do whatever they want\nwhereas in person uh it's a lot more\ndifficult for someone to like walk up\nand harass you but they definitely did\nthey definitely still do it but I feel\nlike it's a lot more frequent online\nbecause it's easier for them to do it\nokay\num so like you can get a lot of hate\ncomments or like people trying to like\nmock you or whatever and it's pretty\neasy just to like mute them so like on\nmy YouTube channel I have a list of like\n3 000 words that ends to block your\ncomment if you like say them that kind\nof stuff is there can you give us\nexample of those words without violating\nTOs\n[Music]\nis a lot\nyeah there's um I just Googled a bunch\nof lists people make for like common\nblocked words and just kind of compiled\nthem all into one daughter list that's\nthat sounds like a really useful\nresource yeah\num and and so what's it like being kind\nof harassed on the internet\num again I kind of just ignore it\nbecause I mean what can I really do if\nyou try to talk back to someone that's\nharassing you it's only gonna make it\nworse like nine times out of ten maybe\neven 10 times out of 10. but um if you\njust ignore them they're clearly just\nlooking for attention or to make some\nkind of reaction so if you don't give\nthat to them it kind of just blows over\nin my experience at least okay\ndoes it hurt you when they say things\nlike that\nuh sometimes it can but it's never like\na big deal like I don't think it could\never like ruin my day or something it'd\nbe like oh well that kind of sucks\nanyways goodbye and then I like remove\nthem from my thing Misty you seem very\ngrounded\nuh perhaps\nbecause I I mean I've worked with a lot\nof content creators I mean usually you\nknow stuff gets under our skin pretty\neasily\nhow\nthat's so interesting I wonder if it\nkind of goes back to the way that you\nlike just respect people so do you have\na sense of like where that hatred is\ncoming for from for them\nuh I assume it's the same thing I talked\nabout with religion is that people just\ndon't know there's a natural human fear\nof the unknown if you see something\nthat's weird to you you're gonna make\nfun of it like nerdy kids in school\ntypically get bullied the most because\nthey're different than the others like\num\nI think people just like to kind of like\nwhat you said and how if maybe they have\na fear of themselves where like maybe\nthey thought a guy was cute once and now\nthey want to beat you up because they're\nmad at themselves like you never really\nknow someone's story so if they do\nsomething stupid I'm just gonna hide\nthem from my thing so I won't see him\nagain\nsomething I actually learned you can do\non Twitter is that I can only see\nnotifications from people that do follow\nme which gets rid of like 90 of the\nharassment interesting okay\nI'm just wondering whether you know how\ncommon it is for people who harass queer\npersonalities on the internet how many\nof them just secretly have penis\nfetishes inner dudes\nI think a very large margin something my\ncounselor brought up is that there is I\ndon't remember what study it was I\ncouldn't link it to you but they said\nlike the vast majority of the population\nis like bisexual in some percentage\nwhether even if it's just 90 10 they'll\njust never admit it which I don't know\nhow they tested that but it it kind of\nmakes sense to me yeah so there there's\nsome um that's that report that\nstatistic I I don't know more recent\nstuff but there's there was a very\nfamous\nsex researcher in the 60s named Kinsey\nand so Kinsey was one of the first\npeople I don't even remember if it was a\nman or a woman but they released these\nthings called the Kinsey reports which\nwas really like a very very like\nqualitatively Rich exploration into\nhuman sexuality\nand what they basically did is like\nasked people like\nthis was early on when people were just\nbasically asking like what are you\nattracted to and stuff like that and so\nI think the kinsu reports are basically\nwhere that idea comes from that 90 of\npeople are homosexual I mean by not 90\nof people are not a hundred percent\nheterosexual\nyeah that sounds familiar too I think\nthat's the right one I I think though\nthat more rigorous and later research\nkind of shrinks that percentage down my\nmy guess is that well over 50 of people\nare probably\nsquarely in the heterosexual category\nthere may be some lingering stuff there\nbut I think based on some of the studies\nthat I sort of encounter and think have\nbetter methodology we're talking about\n10 to 20 of the population is probably\num not cisgender and not heterosexual\nyeah but even still that's a large it's\nit's a huge it's a huge uh percent and\nthen the other thing is that that seems\nto be growing so even this sort of idea\nthat 10 of people are queer in some way\nthat could have another\num\nthe numbers probably even higher so one\nof the things that we're seeing is that\nthere's been a five-fold increase in the\ndiagnosis of autism within the last 20\nyears now this doesn't mean that people\nare five times as autistic today as as\nthey were 20 years ago although I'm sure\nthere's a 4chan joke somewhere in there\nwhat it really is is that now that we're\naware of stuff and we're looking for\nstuff and we're able to pick it up we\nare getting closer to the the true\nnumber out there so I suspect that's\nwhat's going on with people being queer\nand then the other kind of yeah the\nother kind of interesting thing is that\nsince the numbers on the rise this is\nwhy I think that a lot of people are\nlike oh my God Misty is infecting people\nwith the queer virus and is turning\npeople queer they caught me and I think\nit's just the same reason that autism I\nmean autism isn't infectious it's just\nour increased awareness in space for\nthis kind of stuff causes an increase in\ndiagnosis you get the increase in\ndiagnosis doesn't mean that the actual\ncondition is increasing that just means\nwe're detecting it more Faithfully\nyeah and I think also something that\nhelped was pretty much everything's\ndefined as a spectrum now whereas I feel\nlike even however many years ago every a\nlot of stuff was binary so it's like\nyou're straight or gay there's no in\nbetween and now there's a lot of in\nbetween things and people are like oh I\nthink I actually am maybe in between or\nsomething\nyeah and that causes more people to\nidentify with him kind of makes sense\nthe the the more thing the more\nquestions that you turn from true false\ninto like essay the more variability\nyou're gonna get in the answer\num\nyeah so so uh Misty let me just think\nfor a second I had a couple other\nquestions\num\nI had something that I wanted to ask you\nbut I just blanked\num\noh yeah so so do you have any thoughts\nabout\ngender dysphoria and the relationship\nbetween gender dysphoria and\nbeing queer\nyou mean I'm not sure I'd be the best\nperson to talk with sure because I'm\nstill working through that myself\nbut uh I do think that is something that\nneeds talked about okay that's\nfair enough I I it was just thank you\nhow much I could help with them no\nthat's totally cool because I'm not\nhearing that there was that you\nexperienced a whole lot of dysphoria\nuh kind of depends on the situation\ncan you help us understand that a little\nbit\num\nlet me think for a second\nokay well I am still working through it\nhow about maybe in the future I can come\nback and give you a better answer\nabsolutely this is where I I think\nyou've already shared so much I was just\ncurious because I think something that\neven I struggle to understand is\nso we know that there's for example a a\ndiagnosis for gender identity disorder\nwhich is primarily characterized by\ndysphoria\nand there's um\nyou know a lot of emerging research so I\ndon't know that we have 100 clear\nanswers yet that generally speaking\npeople who are queer are are more prone\nto things like suicidal thoughts and\neven completed suicide and there are\nsome studies that show that gender\naffirming care uh is beneficial to\npeople but I think the research is still\nbeing done and we're not 100 sure and it\ndepends on the methodology of the study\nyou know the stuff is relatively new and\nI was just really curious if you had had\npersonal experiences of that that you\ncould share that could help us\nunderstand from you know an individual\nperspective as opposed to a research\nperspective but I totally get that\nthat's not\nsomething that you've dealt a whole lot\nwith or don't really have a whole lot\nyou know that hasn't been your\nexperience yeah yeah totally um I could\nsay probably that I do obviously know a\nlot of queer people or like trans people\nor people that have had gender dysphoria\nin any way and uh I'm not saying this is\ntrue for every case but from what I've\nheard from all them is that all of the\nself-harm and suicides that have\nhappened have been related towards the\nbullying and harassment and not\nnecessarily their own gender identity if\nthat makes sense yeah absolutely\nso so it's it's because of the way that\nthey're treated instead of who they are\nor the way they feel from what I\nunderstand from what people have told me\nsure so I get that that's anecdotal and\nI appreciate you kind of adding that\ncaveat but that's that's of course\nuseful and I think you know one day we'd\nlike to talk to someone like that\num\nand so growing up I'm so I was just I've\nbeen thinking about conversion therapy\nkind of in the back of my mind simply\nbecause you grew up in kind of a\nProtestant uh you know situation was\nthat something that\num was prevalent or anything that you\nkind of dealt with or saw or anything\nlike that\nuh I mean I've definitely heard like\npray the gay away but I've never like\nbeen sat in the electric chair thing or\nwhatever The Stereotype is for\nconversion therapy\num can you help us understand how prey\nthe gay way is supposed to work\nuh again like I said before\num\nI like thought that when I was younger\nand Christian I needed to not be gay it\nwas a challenge I had to overcome and so\nI thought just like enough like prayer\nand time and stuff would get rid of that\nof course it didn't that's not really\nhow that works but\num so it sounds like you tried to pray\nthe gay way yes I did and can you tell\nus what that looked like\nuh I mean just like your daily prayers\nlike please fix me please get rid of\nthis whatever so you consider it\nsomething wrong in yourself sure kind of\nlike a disease like heal me whatever\nokay\nyeah that's actually very helpful Misty\nthank you because I I think a lot of\ntimes people you know because I imagine\nthere are people out there who are going\nto be doing that every day where they\npray to God or pray to Jesus or pray to\nwhoever their God of choices to fix them\nheal them make them different\nyou know yeah I agree\nplease take the the penis fetish out of\nmy mind\num so maybe I might start saying that\ninstead of Andrew sexual say I just have\na penis fetish\nyeah I just I'm sorry I keep bringing it\nup it's just no it's funny like it's got\nto be one of the case the the biggest\ncases of mental gymnastics that I've\never seen\nwow that's some real interesting\ncognitive\nyou know\ndistortions there or bendiness but\num cool I mean do you want to talk about\nuh harassment and being misgendered\nswatting\nuh sure we can\num so go for it\nuh I think misgendering is probably the\nquickest one okay um\nit's definitely hard to get people to do\nwhat makes you happy like of course a\nbig thing with uh trans people in the\nmedia right now are like Bud Light kind\nof stuff that spokesperson is that\neveryone wants to like just harass them\nlet them know you are not who you say\nyou are you are who we're telling you\nyou are we're not going to call you your\npronouns\nEtc so like\ngetting people to try and use that is\nvery difficult and obviously you can't\nforce everyone to do it but um\nit's just kind of hard to tell people\nit's like sometimes my friends will like\nmake a mistake and call me the wrong\nthing and it's difficult to like mention\nlike hey uh just so you know you said\nthis it'd make me feel better if you\nsaid this one instead and they're\nusually like oh okay sure I'm very sorry\nI didn't mean to but there's always some\npeople that are like yeah what's she\ngonna do about it and then\nthat's kind of hard to deal with how do\nyou deal with that\num I don't think you really can because\nlike I said a second ago you can't\nreally force people to do anything\nand like people are always going to do\nwhat they feel is right and if they\ndon't respect your pronouns they're not\ngoing to use them you there's nothing\nyou can do to make them use that so I\nwould just not talk to that person\nanymore\nif that makes sense yeah sorry I mean it\nsounds like you're not out there trying\nto convince people and you're sort of\nlike\nI'm really noticing how well you\nuh navigate towards some people in in\nlife and how\nquickly you're okay navigating away from\nother people\nyeah I think that's very important for\npeople that get misgendered I mean I\nthink it's important for everyone yeah I\nthink one of the most under appreciated\nskills we have is Letting Go\nof convincing people that they're wrong\nso much of the mental anguish that I\nhear from people is like when someone is\nwrong people who try to convince them\notherwise\nwill spend so much time in wasted effort\nand just letting people believe what\nthey want to believe whether it's right\nor wrong and kind of going about your\nday is like so good for your mental\nbecause even I guess one of the ways I\nsee it is even if you can prove this\nperson wrong and like they will have to\ndo what you say uh being wrong makes\npeople angry so even if you can prove\nthem wrong they're now going to be angry\nso no matter what you do it's a\nlose-lose situation so just don't bother\nyeah so even if you win you end up\nlosing yeah yeah I'd agree completely I\nthink one of the biggest things to\nremember is that\nI think we we think a lot about\nconvincing people but I sort of think\nabout it as like help people understand\nand if they're not open-minded or\nwilling to understand then that's on\nthem right I'm not going to spend all\nthe time sort of trying to convince them\nand so really think about you know is\nthis person willing to be open-minded\nand if the answer is no stop wasting\nyour breath\nand then if\nalternatively they could be going after\nyou it's not even you doing anything\nlike uh maybe someone like DMS me on\nTwitter like you are a man you are a he\nblah blah blah like they're going out of\ntheir way to me I can just mute them or\nin person you can just kind of try to\nwalk away and hopefully nothing gets\nworse that's a little more difficult in\nperson\nbut um I think both ways whether you're\ntrying to tell someone they're\nmisgendering you or they're coming after\nyou I think you just need to reassess\nthe situation that makes sense\nabsolutely so Misty I'm kind of curious\nI've got a question for you I was hoping\nfor your guidance with something sure\nso\nwe try to have conversations with people\nand try to understand their like\nexperience of being human and kind of\nwhere they're coming from we try to do\nthat in a relatively non-judgmental\nmanner I'm not saying that judgment we\nsometimes are judgmental and I think\njudgment actually has a place but to be\njudgmental with compassion\nI get what you mean\num so one of the things that I\npersonally have struggled a lot with is\nis this idea of like platforming someone\nversus like understanding them so in in\nmy heart of hearts and also as in my\nclinical experience as a psychiatrist\nit's kind of interesting because when I\ntell people like yeah I worked in a jail\nfor three months everyone's like wow\nlike you must be a good human being\nand then if we ever like talk about you\nknow interviewing someone who has\nlet's say very like anti or has a\nperspective on on homosexuality that is\nlike anti or whatever that people are\ntalking to that person is like off\nlimits so do you have a sense and I\npersonally struggle with this because\nI think that the way that we bring\npeople together is actually through\ndialogue like that's just my personal\nethos I'm not saying that that's\nobjectively correct and I think that\nostracizing or canceling particular\npeople can be very effective but would\nyou have thoughts about like let's say\nwe got the opposite of you\nlet's say how would you feel about us\ndoing an interview with someone like\nthat\nuh\nI I don't know if I'd say I'd love to\nbut I think it'd be worth it like I\ndon't think it'd be a fun conversation\nbut I think it's worth the effort if\nthat makes sense yeah I mean would you\nwhat do you think about the potential\nharm of platforming someone who could\nsay damaging things\nI think as long as both sides are\nplatformed equally and people can kind\nof\nlike form their own opinions based on it\nlike I feel like you have one person\nsaying like hey I'm a normal person I\nlike the same gender\nthat's it and then someone else like\nyelling and like spitting out of their\nmouth like you're disgusting I hate you\nI feel like most people would kind of\njust realize one side might not be as\nbad as the other but I guess that's a\nlittle bit hopeful but I think just in\ngeneral I I do think there's obviously\nnothing wrong with any uh queer uh\nidentities so I feel like in any\nargument like that uh most people would\nprobably realize like oh it's not as bad\nas I thought it was because that's what\nmy experience was in Smash like I used\nto think uh like being gay was like a\nbad thing and I needed fixed and then I\nmet all these people that were just\nnormal people and I was like oh it's not\nwhat I thought it was so I think even if\nyou did have someone horribly against it\nas long as you also have someone like\nvery for it and they kind of clash I\nfeel like a lot of people would\nkind of like understand the issues\nbetter rather than just hearing only one\nside if that makes sense\nokay yeah so and that that's it's good\nto hear thank you so much for sharing\nthat like I think for me it's not even\nso much about sides although I totally\nget that that's an important aspect\nbecause I don't yeah I don't even really\nthink about it as an argument I I mean I\nknow that it exists that but the way\nthat I approach it is just like\nunderstanding and and I've worked with a\nlot of people who I think could be\ndescribed as bigoted or evil or you know\nterrible human beings and like that's\njust part of what we do as medical\ndoctors is like\nwe try to engage with everyone\num and it's it's part of you know the\nthe oath that you take when you start\nmed school and the oath that you take\nwhen you graduate about sort of like\ntreating people equally\num but I I'm I'm a little bit concerned\nabout navigating\nthat issue\nI'm happy to talk to pretty much anyone\nabout anything but I I think that\nthere's I've come to understand and\nrealize and appreciate that having a\nconversation with people can have in\nfact this whole HG thing is about the\nfar-reaching impacts of a single\nconversation\nyeah I totally get what you're saying\nlike if you get someone who's like very\nagainst it and then you make this video\nit gives a bunch of views now you're\njust showing all these things this\nperson's saying that could negatively\naffect people\nbut um\nsorry about to say something no no go\nahead\num\nI definitely think it's still good\nthough to hear their sides because like\nassuming they are just wrong you can't\nreally just say oh well that person's\nwrong like you kind of need to\nunderstand why they're wrong if that\nmakes sense\nso I think as long as you could say like\nhey this person said these things just\nwant to let you know it's not fully true\nor this evidence counteracts that or\nwhatever I feel like that's fine I guess\nI don't know it's like I'm not really a\nsingle person in a place to judge how\nthat should work if that makes sense\nyeah and that's the problem that I face\nis that yeah I am not that person either\nso I'm I'm trying to figure it out right\nbecause the other thing that's kind of\ninteresting is sometimes we'll like push\nback on people that we talk to but you\nknow it's not part of it's not my job to\nwell I mean sometimes I rep I always\nrepresent of you actually but I I you\nknow generally speaking when people come\non and they say something that\nI disagree with it's not like my place\nto disagree with them if that kind of\nmakes sense I'm not I'm not holding\neither side of the argument I have my\nown biases and Views but we're really\nreally tough yeah thank you very much\nfor offering your perspective though it\ncertainly helps me and I I get that\nyou're not speaking for the queer people\nright you're not like the president\nwho's been elected to represent them and\nthat there's I'm sure there's a whole\ndiversity of opinions there but it\nreally helps me to understand that and\nhear that from you\nthank you\num\nyeah I mean that's kind of like what I\nreally appreciate everything we've\ntalked about today that's sort of like\neverything that I wanted to talk about\num are there other things that you sort\nof wanted to\nmention or share\nuh I think we've got pretty much\neverything I wanted to get across okay\num and how do you feel about our\nconversation today\nI've enjoyed it love spending time with\nyou nice to have a little Dr K in my\ncorner that talks back to me for once\nuh I'm confused by that what do you mean\nby talks back to you\nwatched your videos for a few years and\nso oh have you respond to me is an\ninteresting feeling and is there\nanything that you would have wanted to\nask Dr K that because I'm here now so I\ncan respond\num well I assume we just did and pretty\nmuch because like I said I always wish\nthere was like that video that I needed\na few years ago I feel like we've at\nleast started on that yeah so so I get\nso let me ask in a different way Misty I\nfeel like so far the conversation that\nwe've had is not for you it's for\neverybody who's watching and it's for me\nis there any conversation that you want\nto have that's more for you\num\nI mean we could though I'm already in\nthe process of working with uh specific\nLGBT counselor but um yeah so if it's\ncounseling stuff I'd say stick with that\nyeah I'd definitely be down to a\ncomeback in the future though maybe if\nI've learned a little more had some more\nexperience absolutely so if there's\nsomething that you want to talk about\num or something that you want to share\nlike that sounds fantastic\nawesome\num so just a couple of other thoughts\nbefore we wrap up so first of all uh how\ndo I learn how to get good at smash like\ndo you have any recommendations\nuh well I wouldn't call myself good\ncompared to other players but um\njust a lot of time if you want to get\ngood at smash find your local scene just\nshow up someone will teach you something\nyou'll get better there okay a local\nscene okay I did not know that those\nexisted but I imagine they do\nyeah\nokay and uh any character\nrecommendations for noobs\num I don't play ultimate I played Smash\n4 and now I play melee but typically if\nyou just like look up what characters\nare popular and then see how many moves\nthey use if you find like a popular\ncharacter that uses only like three or\nfour good moves they're probably pretty\neasy to learn nice so find people that\nhave an OP move and just be like a a one\none button Masher\nI try to play Bowser Donkey Kong\nBow's just good character to start\num Heavy's Grapplers I don't know about\nultimate in Smash 4 they were both\npretty good I think okay\ngood to know and then just to kind of\nwrap up what I'd love to do is just\nshare with you kind of what I understood\nas your process of coming out\nyeah and um and I think what I'll focus\non a little bit more is the andrewsexual\nside\nso here's what I'm kind of understanding\nokay so the first thing is that\nsign number one is you had five\ngirlfriends before you hit puberty\nright and because I can really even call\nthem that at that age I I mean I'm sure\nthat you're you're at the time your\nfellow Bros were jealous that there was\nprobably there was this Mega Chad Misty\nand and this this dude can get more\nchicks and he's not even a dude\num and and so I really do Wonder a\nlittle bit about like whether it was\nlike the\nweather sort of being impervious to that\nsexual attraction or Romanticism even at\na young age it actually correlates with\nbeing uh queer in some way\nand then sort of what happened is you\nnoticed that like you actually started\nto identify with like kind of romantic\nfeelings or and not maybe that's a\nstrong word but you thought that\nfictional characters that were men were\nlike pretty cute right and it's not\nnecessarily that you had to be attracted\nto someone in real life\nand also that\npart of the the challenge kind of for\nyou growing up in real life is that like\neven if you were attracted to someone\nthere's a strong strong strong\npossibility that they would not be\nattracted back so you kind of like keep\nthat on the DL is that fair\nyeah\num\nand that one of the ways that you sort\nof discovered that you were Andrew\nsexual or and at the time you sounded\nlike you still identified as a man so\nwe're gay\num was sort of even when you were sort\nof thinking about heterosexual scenarios\nso sex between a man and a woman you\nsort of identified with the woman\ncorrect and then you started to kind of\nnotice that hey like I kind of think\nsome guys are cute and then you kind of\ntold your buddies was it in high school\nthat like hey you know isn't it what\nwhat exactly did you say can you tell us\nthat again it was something like\nI just kind of mentioned it casually as\nif everyone had it and they kind of\nlooked at me confused and were like what\nare you talking about and what did you\nmention again I love the way that you\nphrased it I don't it was something like\n[Music]\num\nlike don't you guys ever feel weird like\nwhen you're like attracted to like a\nrandom guy and they're like what yeah\nand so you kind of dip your toe in the\nwater and then discover oh actually this\nmay not be an experience that's shared\num and then when it comes to so once you\nsort of figured it out then I think that\nthere was a the process of coming out\nfirst of all was not binary that there\nwas a lot of like\nbaked in paranoia that a lot of the\nthings that you were thinking about\ndoing you had to be like extra careful\nand I love the way that you described\nbeing a spy in your own life right like\nyou're some secret agent and no one can\nknow so you can't use dating apps you\ncan't do this you can't let anyone know\num and that you sort of eased into it\nand made it easy for people to sort of\nlike accept you you kind of like\nstarted by an excuse for like every step\nforward so you started painting your\nnails when you were doing a cosplay and\nthen you kind of kept on doing it at the\nvery beginning you like you had a\nacceptable reason\nand then it sort of continued yeah for\nsure it also sounds like you also kind\nof displayed certain stereotypical\ncharacteristics which felt uh\nconsistent with who you are your voice\nkind of started to raise you had\nflamboyant mannerisms and what I'm sort\nof hearing is that you didn't hold that\nback that stuff back the way that you\nused to when you were a spy\nyeah well I did fully do it with friends\nbut then in family I definitely like\nreserve like show no emotion like stoic\nkind of sit there and then I just kind\nof eased into it over time that makes\nsense yeah and then it sounds like the\nprocess of coming out was also a process\nin terms of you started with the most\nimportant people first\nand you didn't want and you wanted them\nto hear it from you\num that you literally practiced your\nlanguage and worked through some of your\nemotions with a counselor in your case\nbut that you sort of like really like\npracticed what to say and really got\ncentered before you said anything\nyeah for sure and I would like to\nreiterate if we are recapping that I\ndefinitely think one of the best things\nyou can do is make sure you do keep\nrespect for them and say like I don't\nwant to hurt you I don't want to offend\nyou but this is who I am this is who\nI've always been\nEtc as we've mentioned yeah I was going\nto end with that but I think that's\nactually the most important thing and I\nlove that you articulated it that way\nwhich is that you know the process of\ncoming out especially if you've got\nreligious parents and things like that\ncan be so contentious\nand doing your best to preserve respect\ntowards them I think Garner is the same\nin return right because if you come out\nguns blazing like they're going to\nrespond very defensively\num and I think the the last thing to\njust mention is that as you mentioned in\na lot of ways you're really grateful for\nyour family and your experiences and you\nknow people's mileage may vary like if\npeople other people who are growing up\nwith Protestant Christians or you know\nSouthern Baptists or even other\nreligions whether they be Hindu or\nMuslim or whatever\nthat some people may not be so lucky\nI agree yes and so everyone should kind\nof take it their way\nmm-hmm\nlast thing is that it sounds like really\njoining a community was a big part of\nyou feeling confident and grounded and\nin your case it was the smash Community\nbut I guess as you said 90 of them are\nqueer yeah\n[Laughter]\nso\nI guess that explains maybe why I\nhaven't played smash up until this point\nbut hey I'm starting my journey now\num yeah I definitely think joining\nCommunity was one of the best things for\nme yeah absolutely\nso anything um else that you want to say\nbefore we wrap up for the day Misty\nuh I don't think so but it's been nice\ntalking to you it's been nice being here\nI'm glad I could hopefully help some\npeople even if it's just a couple\nyeah hopefully I didn't ruin anyone\nelse's experience but say something\nwrong\nyeah I I I I hope so too\nyou know I think that's we're here to\nlisten to people's experiences of life\nso thank you very much for sharing yours\nand hopefully it's educational or\nhelpful to people who are listening\nand good luck to you Mr Cat uh enjoy the\nrest of pride month anything else can\nyou tell us a little bit about where we\ncan find you and and what to expect and\nwhat kind of content you're going to be\ndoing\nyeah sure so um my name is Mr Cat it's\nlike mystical but with a t\num I do a lot of weird Minecraft stuff\nso if you've ever seen like making a\ncircle in Minecraft or Etc I I try to\nmake a bunch of weird stuff and uh push\nthe limits of the game but I missed a\ncat or missed a cat live on all\nplatforms I mostly just do YouTube\nthough\nthat's about it cool thank you very much\nand are you gonna be anything in\nparticular you're doing for pride month\nor just kind of just streaming and\ndoing your standard thing\nPlay The Pride Minecraft championship\nwhat was that how does that work what is\na Minecraft championship\nuh so it's a tournament organized by\nKnox crew who've been making Minecraft\ntournaments for like 11 12 years now and\num this month specifically a pride one\nso they tried to get a bunch of uh queer\ncreators in and only have them on the\nteams so but how do you compete in\nMinecraft how do you have a tournament\nis in the sandbox though\num yeah that's why is that you can make\na bunch of different games of anything\nso it's kind of like fall guys like\nmaybe you have some PVP games maybe you\nhave some Parkour maybe you have some\nlike weird quirky games you get some\nbuilding games and then you just get\npoints and then it adds up and then\nthere's a winner oh interesting okay so\nso that that's really fascinating cool\nwell thank you so much for coming on\ntoday Mr Cat I really appreciate it and\num you know if you have other stuff you\nwant to share down the road please let\nus know of course\ntake care all right you too bye\nokay\nso thoughts questions\nwhat on Earth\ntree punching okay\nso I I you know I saw there was a\ncomment about HG is woke now\nI mean\nI don't know that we're woke\nbut we're not\nwe're just here to talk to people about\ntheir experiences of life\nand I'm sure we have a bias right\nbecause like I'm a human being and like\nI have a brain and that means that I\nhave a bias\nbut I I don't know if you all remember\nbut we did an interview epic interview\none of my favorite interviews of all\ntime with Jimmy from Philly who was a\na very proud Trump supporter\nand this is where you know I think Mr\nCat said like as long as you kind of\nrepresent both sides of the argument\nlike I I'm not even really interested in\nthat\num\nbut what I really am interested in is\nhelping human beings\nunderstand other human beings and that's\nwhat we're about\nI'm sure that at times we have beliefs\nthat will align\nwith like\nparticular groups political philosophies\nlike whatever like that's gonna happen\nright so for example\nwe think that science is a good thing\nand we think that like medical treatment\nis a good thing like we we believe that\nright that but there are people out\nthere that don't believe that and that\nare kind of anti-sides and like that's\nokay\nwe're actually okay talking to those\npeople too we absolutely have our own\nbeliefs but the really core part of what\nwe try to do here at HG is AOE healing\nand it's to recognize that human beings\nout there today are suffering\nirrespective of what their political\nbeliefs are whether they're queer\nwhether they're straight like whatever\npeople are suffering and what really\ntargeted what we're focused on is to\nhelp alleviate that suffering\nand one of the things that I think is\nreally challenging right is that so we\ntalk about how we're woke well we've\nalso like interviewed our fair share of\ninsults\nand there's tons of in cells in our\ncommunity and oftentimes woke people are\nover here and in cells are over here and\nwhat it comes down to we're not\nPro or anti-either of those things what\nwe're for is like human beings\nbecause the one thing I've learned as a\npsychiatrist is that working in jails\nand working with people who are like\nyou know\nhave ankle bracelets and working with\npeople who are addicts and working with\nCEOs and working with\nheads of state and working with like all\nthese kinds of people like people are\njust people\nand what I think really like screws the\nworld is when we stop treating people as\npeople\nand we start treating them\nbased on some identifiable thing\nand I thought Mr Cat said this really\nwell\nthat it's easier to blame than it is to\nunderstand\nso much easier to blame than to\nunderstand\nright so for people who think that we're\nwoke or we're platforming someone right\nso this is also something where it's\nlike we don't want to just talk to\npeople of a particular belief system\nidentification atheist religious\nwhatever we want to talk to everybody\nbecause I think it's really important\nwe've seen this in our own Community\nespecially when it comes to gender\nDynamics where it's like\nare the HG Community is a place where\nEcho Chambers collide\nand that's really challenging it's a\nit's it's very choppy Waters at times\nand our mod team is fantastic we've like\nconstricted a lot of these dating and\ngender Dynamics posts to Friday but\nthese are discussions that need to be\nhad\nwe can't keep separating ourselves on\nthe internet like this is bizarre we\nhave so much connection\nand we're the most isolated we've ever\nbeen\nwhy is that\nit's because we don't talk to people\nwe just don't talk to people\nwe isolate ourselves we cancel other\npeople and I'm not like anti-cancel\nculture that's where like anything I say\nI'm Gonna Get bucketed Right\nso I think if someone is part of cancel\nculture is just like consequences for\nactions it's karma\nat the same time I think just dialogue\nis like what we're all about\nand there may be absolutely situations\nin which even dialogue is not\nappropriate I'm not saying that\nbut I think that with the way that the\ninternet and Human Society is evolving\ntoday a little bit more dialogue and a\nlittle bit more understanding and a\nlittle bit more listening is a step in\nthe right direction and that's something\nthat I can absolutely get behind\nand so I'm grateful to everyone in this\ncommunity\neven those of y'all that hate other\npeople in the community I'm grateful to\nall of y'all for being here and sharing\nyour perspective but the one thing that\nI ask of everyone who's here today\nis that in addition to sharing please\ntry to listen\nto what other people are sharing as well\nand recognize that human beings have\nvaried experiences\nand I want to share just one really\nsimple story for you\nearly on I was an intern\nso fresh out of med school\nI was seeing a patient in the emergency\nroom\nand they told me that their parent had\njust passed away\nand I said I'm so sorry for your loss\nand they looked at me like I was Medusa\nand they said\nmy parent had been physically abusive my\nentire life\nwhen they passed away a week ago it was\nthe most relieving thing I've ever\nexperienced and I was like holy crap\nthat never crossed my mind\nwe assume that all parents are good\nparents and everyone misses their\nparents when they die because it's very\ncommon right\nbut what I learned that day is that\neveryone's experience of life is\ndifferent and just because your life\nexisted a particular way does not mean\nthat other people's lives existed that\nway\nand why do we assume this stuff because\nwe don't hear or listen the other the\nexperiences of other people's lives\nand that's what we're here to combat\nand we think that bringing the world and\nthe internet together happens through\ndialogue and listening\nand I've seen actually horror stories\nof people even working with therapists\nand the therapist will Advocate very\nhard based on their value system that\ntheir patient should repair the\nrelationship with their with their\nparents\nright because you only get one mom and\ndad and you'll regret it after you die\nbut that even therapists we can impose\nour own value system on our patients and\nthat can be a mistake\nthat's the case of a therapist and not\nlistening and I've been guilty of that I\njust shared an example so it's not like\nI'm better than any of them\nthis is what I've learned\nis that I've got to be super careful and\nI tried really hard to recognize that\nother human beings are different and I\nstrongly encourage you all to as well\nI mean half the internet is trying to\nconvince the other half of the internet\nthey're wrong\nright why are we losing this game of\nDOTA this is game of valorant it's\nbecause you're a noob\nand what's that person doing\nwe're losing because you're a noob\nand what happens to both of those\nplayers they lose the game they cue back\nup and then they tank another game which\nis why they're bronze\nwhich players climb the ones that\nactually listen to other people because\nhey if you're in bronze chances are\nyou're making a mistake\nand it's possible that your team members\nare aware of what mistakes you're making\nand this is happening not only in every\nsingle game that has matchmaking right\nwhich is why people will pay 10 play 10\n000 hours and be hard stuck at bronze\nit's happening on the internet as a\nwhole\nor instead of trying to understand why\nsomeone disagrees with me I'm going to\nconvince them that I am right\nand to be blunt like what brought me\nfrom failing out of college to like\nteaching at Harvard Medical School\nwas in wreck in trying to learn\nnot in assuming that I'm right but\nrecognizing hey where could I be wrong\nand the one thing that I got so the\ninteresting thing is that I got one\npiece of very positive feedback\nfrom my program directors\nwhen I was becoming a psychiatrist and\nthere that they said that your best\nstrength is that you take feedback well\nwhen people tell you you're doing\nsomething wrong you listen that was the\none thing that I was asked here in\neverything else TBH chat I'm kind of\nlike average\nthere were people who were way smarter\nway more hard-working like people who\nwere like I was like I was bronzed here\nwho somehow got like recalibrated to\nDiamond\nbut the one thing that I did well is\nlearn from my mistakes\nand even when I didn't think I made\nmistakes I started to ask myself what I\ncould do better\nthat was the one thing I was good at TBH\nand that's how you go from like failing\nto the top is correcting your mistakes\nand what I'm seeing on the internet as a\nwhole with all this woke anti-woke\nwhatever is like no one is stopping to\nthink about like what can I do better\neveryone's thinking about what everyone\nelse is doing wrong which is why the\nwhole world is stuck at bronze\nwe're not getting better we're moving in\nthe opposite direction do you all get\nthat\nmental illness is in crisis we're at the\nhighest level of depression anxiety\nsuicide's been pretty stable actually\nit's a little bit getting a little bit\nworse\nthe number one cause of death\nfor Asian Kids In America between the\nages of 18 and 24 is suicide\nfor non-asian kids\nit's accidents\nin the most dangerous thing for an Asian\nkid is themselves\nand why is that it's because their\nparents teach them to protect themselves\nfrom the rest of the world\nright so they have fewer accidents\nbut they're a danger to themselves why\nbecause when an Asian kid says hey I'm\nstruggling\nhey life is hard\npeople don't listen\nNeuroscience research is in an all-time\nhigh\ntranslation of Neuroscience research\nwe've got Chads like Sam Harris and\nAndrew huberman\nwho are taking so much neuroscience and\ntranslating it to the public\nwe've got so many people like Dr Romani\nand brene brown and like all these\namazing human beings who are sharing so\nmuch information\nscience is at an all-time high we're\nlike making breakthroughs with Quantum\nComputing Human Society is progressing\nand mental health is getting worse why\nevery other dimension of medicine we are\njust\nleveling up\nand I want you all to think about this\nyou can take a heart\nout of a human being's body and stick a\ndifferent one in there\nthere are even cases of people putting\npig hearts into humans and that humans\nstaying alive for a while this is how\nfar science has come\nwe've got ECMO for your lungs\ncardiac bypass for your heart dialysis\nfor your kidneys\nECMO is extracorporeal membrane\nmembranous oxygenation we've got a\ndevice that can breathe for you a device\nthat can pump blood through your body a\ndevice that can clean your bloodstream\nlike your kidneys and mental illness is\ngetting worse\nwhy\nif science is getting better shouldn't\nmental illness be being getting better\nit's because we've stopped listening\nwe've stopped trying to understand and\nthe Judgment in the world is in an\nastronomical High\nif you're an incel it's your fault\nif you're red pill you're woke I mean\nyou're not woke you're an ass if you're\nwoke you're everything that's destroying\neverything\nright it's just judgment it doesn't\nmatter who you are you get judged no\none's trying to understand what is your\nexperience of life\nin my personal experience of working\nwith people who are quote unquote red\npillars most common thing is trauma\nwhat kind of trauma trauma inflicted by\na woman\nbut we never think of it that way we\nnever stop to listen\nand I'm not like Pro red pill or\nanything like that I just think we\nshould listen to human beings\nand that's how you bring people back on\nthe path\nand if you guys if you all disagree\nI'm here to listen by all means tell me\nI'm wrong tell me that hey like I'm I'm\nhere to listen I'm sharing with you what\nI believe\nAlyssa is asking is this guy a doctor\nyeah last time I checked\nI'm a psychiatrist for those of you all\nthat don't know\nyes so tell me something interesting\nrecently\nso when we started when I started\nstreaming four years ago\nit was like I was pretty clear like I\nmentioned a lot that I was a doctor\nand that I was a psychiatrist and now\napparently like we've grown so much that\nlike we we stopped sharing the lore\nlike a couple years ago right because\nhow I mean\nyou stop just hey hello hello Chad I am\nI look I am doctor baby look at how good\nI am I know so much I'm so cool\nand so we stopped doing that and now\nwhat I understand someone told me this\nrecently it's like people just think\nyou're a random guy who's talking about\nstuff which is honestly what I am\nright\nlike even doctors are random dudes or\nrandom women\nor random non-binary and by the way the\na the last time I checked an lgbtqia is\nasexual\nMaybe I'm Wrong maybe it's androgynous\nwho knows that's what I thought it was\num\nyeah Dr K versus Dr disrespect let's go\nI'm down\nis a cool dude I think\nI just I've seen a couple clips of him\num\ncool\nOkay so\nuh thank you all very much for coming\ntoday\nwe've got a couple of cool YouTube\nvideos coming out\num we're doing a lot of new things FYI\nso here's a last thing I want to share\nwith you all so I'm going to just give\nyou all a list of topics that I'm\nplanning on doing stuff about\nokay\nso brain rot\npotentially penis dysmorphia\nsome stuff around male mental health\ndeep dives into somatic illness\num\neating disorders\num\npmdd so the under understanding the\nconnections between uh\nmenstruation female hormones and mental\nhealth\nthese are all topics that we're kind of\nconsidering tinnitus is another one\nso if you guys have other topics you\nknow a great way that we oh another one\nthat I just saw today from our subreddit\nwas like is it too late to start so I\nI'm I'm thinking about I'm trying to\nbuild a video about\nor a lecture or something\nabout uh\nhow to start late in life and catch up\num\nand so that's another one oh I also want\nto do something about boredom super\nhyped about boredom so like\nunderstanding the science of boredom and\nhow to conquer boredom\nso these are topics that we've got and\njust like mysticat kind of said you know\nwe have deficiencies in the topics that\nwe cover\nand how we decide is based on y'all\nand so a lot of people this is just\nanother aside so there are also certain\nthings that we've built\nthat are\nsort of like very carefully packaged and\nvery efficient\nat covering certain topics so we\nactually don't quarrel cover a lot of\ncore topics anymore like depression\nanxiety meditation and ADHD we've got\nYouTube videos and stuff so y'all can\nsearch for that and I'm not saying we're\nnot going to do it again but generally\nspeaking one of the things that we've\nrealized is that like rather than making\nthe same video like 10 times in a row\nthat's why we built things like Dr K's\nguide\nso if you guys want like a start to\nfinish sort of exploration of depression\nboth clinical and non-clinical and then\npeople may Wonder well what do you mean\nby non-clinical depression where it's\nlike yeah so sometimes when people come\ninto my office and they say I'm\ndepressed they're not mentally ill\ntheir life\nis lacking something very very important\nand so that's what we're gonna help you\nunderstand so sort of the spirituality\nor the existential approach to\ndepression is also in Dr K's guided\ndepression which is not necessarily a\ntreatment approach there's a lot of\nstuff about treatment and complementary\nalternative medicine and medications and\npharmacology\nso for those four topics for meditation\nADHD anxiety and depression\nwhat I try to do is mimic when someone\ncomes to my office and says Dr K I want\nto learn how to meditate what are all\nthe things that I teach that person when\nsomeone comes into my office and says Dr\nK I have ADHD or I think I have ADHD how\ndo I work with that person because a lot\nof it is going to be clinical\nunderstanding but then a lot of what I\ndo with people who I'm helping is\nunderstanding how can you get organized\nwhere does motivation come from so the\nADHD guide is also our guide to doing\nstuff\nso how can we translate everything that\nI know from like yoga and meditation and\nstudying and ashrams in India and South\nKorea and Japan for like seven years and\neverything that I learned at places like\nHarvard Medical School put together\nand we will teach you how to do stuff\nand so if y'all are interested in a lot\nof that and you're looking for more\nsomething that's like more comprehensive\nand applicable instead of a one-off\ndefinitely check those out\nand for the rest of the stuff this is\nwhat we've got on Deck and y'all let us\nknow if you want us to cover something\nelse\nyeah so\nfemale hormones in the menstrual cycle\nis like a big thing that we're gonna do\nokay\nany chance you all will cover asexuality\nabsolutely it's just an issue of\nsequencing\num Dr k please do one on routines\norganization discipline and whether it's\noverrated so that's sprinkled throughout\na lot of stuff we also have resource\npacks which I'm not sure if you all are\naware of those are kind of like uh\ncollections of videos with worksheets\nand exercises\num and then a lot of the stuff that\nyou're talking about about\nroutine organization and discipline\nthat's in the guide to doing stuff so\njust so you all know the guide to doing\nstuff is like\n50 bigger than any of the other guides\nbecause we go into so much so many like\nhigh-yield topics about motivation and\norganization\nhow to cry ah good\nthank you burpes\nokay\num\noh I got a 130 donation thank you so\nmuch Hugo\nuh thanks for all your work have you\ncovered oversleeping I'm I'm tired all\nthe time and sleep around noon every\nother day\nsleep so we have videos on insomnia\nbut we can absolutely do a deep dive\ninto sleep\nah Loris is saying can you do something\nabout bullying we have videos on\nbullying but we we also have something\nin the works around scapegoating\nso a lot of bullying actually has to do\nwith scapegoating\nokay\nuh the resource packs are free the\nguides are not\nand just a reminder just about in\ngeneral so first of all we try to make\nas much stuff as accessible as possible\nthere was a post recently where someone\nwas like wait Dr K's guide isn't a\nsubscription it's like yeah we're one of\nthe few dumbasses on the internet who\nlike doesn't do subscriptions yet\nright like we're\nbecause we try to make it accessible\nsecond thing\nis\num\nit helps us a lot if y'all donate if you\nguys share stuff like if you share our\nvideos if you watch our videos if you\nlike if you comment all that kind of\nstuff helps us so even if you all are\nnot in a place to financially support us\num\nyou know anything that y'all do in that\nvein whether it's subscribing or sharing\nor whatever like that all actually helps\nin some way and then for some of our\nthings that come at a price like we're\nvery very grateful for for to everyone\nwho has bought things like Dr K's guide\nor signed up for coaching\nbecause all of that Capital you know\nwe've never taken an outside investment\nor anything like that and the reason is\nbecause you all are you all support us\nand as long as you all keep on\nsupporting us whether it's donations\nsubscribing sharing or trying out Dr K's\nguide or whatever like we build it to\nhelp you and then we take that money and\nthen we use it to build additional stuff\nso we took the the proceeds from the\nfirst three guides and used it to build\na fourth guide and use it to do things\nlike we have researchers for example\nthat will help me with research so that\nI can produce more high quality videos\nquicker\num and so we're grateful for anything\nthat you all can provide and and no big\ndeal if y'all are not in a good\nfinancial situation we're still here for\ny'all and we're going to do our best\nthat's also where a lot of people\num need to remember that we've got an\nawesome Discord and the Discord by the\nway has like grown immensely so even for\na lot of these things like\naccountability there's like a fitness\nDiscord and the cool thing about the\nfitness part of the Discord is that the\npeople there are like people from our\ncommunity so the the fitness leads on\nour Discord are very aware of\npsychological challenges to getting fit\nand so they really really help people\nthey meet people where they're at and\nthey really help them\nbecause a lot of Fitness is not just\nabout physical routine right which\nthere's tons of videos and you can see\nlike blog posts about like work out this\nway and do this kind of thing and and\nlike you know wiggle your right toe when\nyou're doing push-ups and if you wiggle\nyour right toe it'll contract this\nmuscle and increase your fat burn and\ntake this supplement there's all that\nkind of crap out there but what I really\nappreciate about the people on our\nDiscord is whether it's entrepreneurship\nor Fitness they recognize that the\nmental struggle is real and they'll try\nto help you all with that\num appreciate all you do and give heart\nany advice videos for healthy parenting\nas a gamer\nso it's funny you should ask\nthis is what I will say we are actually\ngoing to start a whole YouTube channel I\nthink I hope fingers crossed on\nparenting so stay tuned to that we just\nrevamped our course about how to raise\nuh parenting for\nlike video game addiction and like how\nto Be an Effective parent this is\nsomething that I sort of have a lot of\npersonal experience with so we combine a\nlot of science with my own experiences\nof upbringing of parents who loved me a\nlot but like didn't know how to teach me\ndiscipline as well as my own experiences\nof having two kids\nso absolutely\num and we have a Facebook group for\nparents as well\nwhich\nyou know plus minus\nyeah so that's the other thing it's like\nyou know what our biggest problem is is\nwe do a lot of stuff that no one has any\nclue about\num so so that that's why we strongly\nlike okay so chat we need Joel's help we\nare doing cool things and no one knows I\nliterally met with our whole mod team\nyesterday and they're like no one knows\nabout all the cool crap we're doing and\nI was like okay I'm gonna try to help\nwith that\nso if you guys discover something cool\nthat we are doing\nplease let other people know\nbecause this whole this whole this whole\noperation is like not Dr K okay I may\nhave the information but we need y'all's\nhelp in like disseminating it and\nsharing it with other people and huge\nshout out to everyone on our subreddit\nand Discord and all these other places\nwhere someone will ask a question hey I\nhave this problem and someone will also\nbe like hey have you seen this video\nhuge shout out to y'all y'all are doing\nGod's work\nuh\nRonaldo is saying do you have anything\nrelated to dating trauma wounded people\nyes we have a whole video about how to\ndate someone with BPD we also have a\ntrauma Deep dive both of which I would\nrecommend you watch\nyes we have those things\npeople tell us that so some people say\nthat the the trauma video in particular\nis like one of the best things that\nwe've ever produced it's also one of the\nlectures that I feel the most proud of I\nthink it's one of the top three lectures\nthat I've given ever since I started\nstreaming and there have been hundreds\nthe BPD one I made because I love people\nwith BPD and I love working with them\nand they get a they get a bad rap people\nwith trauma get so demonized on the\ninternet\nand in our media\nand everyone's like oh my God this\nperson has a personality disorder as a\nnarcissist has BPD has a history of\ntrauma should I break up with them and\nno one ever tells us how to successfully\nhave a relationship with those people\nwhich is sad because like they're good\npeople right they just the way that they\nrelate to other people\nwhat they've been taught about what a\nhealthy relationship is or how a\nrelationship is supposed to work is so\nscrewed up but that's not their fault\nthat's because of the way that they were\nraised\nand they deserve love and good\nrelationships just as much as any of the\nrest of us\nhave you heard of 48 Laws of Power yeah\nit's a great book\nI think it's not quite as applicable\nbut it's fun to read\ncan someone make a list of all the cool\nthings this channel does I wasn't\nlistening the last five minutes we'll\ntry\noh yeah avoidant personality disorder\nshyness social anxiety that's another\ndeep dive we're looking into it's on our\nlist\nhere's why trauma so common absolutely\nthat's our core trauma video\nooh libido income libido\nincompatibilities love it\nwhat I would love to do about that is\nnot just a video about it but that's\nsomething where I think an interview\nwould be dope\nlet's talk to both Partners about libido\nand incompatibility\nokay\num\nis it possible to get people to listen\nbetter and be more understanding yeah so\nyou guys should watch our communication\nwebinar\nthe parents in our community say that\nit's been absolutely eye-opening it is\none of the most scuffed videos that we\nhave ever produced this was back before\nwe were cool\nand this is what like Dr K ordered a 30\ncamera from Amazon was streaming from a\nlaptop during the pandemic in an empty\nroom when I was staying at someone\nelse's house\nI had a foldable picnic table\na camera and a Yeti mic\nand we did arguably some people say well\nalso one of our like top three lectures\nwhich is so scuffed but apparently is\nthe best people have said that it's like\nrevolutionary for helping them\ncommunicate\nit's also one but the problem with that\nvideo is that like 30 of people who\nwatch it have no idea what I'm saying so\nthe big irony is it is a poorly\ncommunicated video on communication\nwhere if you get it\nit's revolutionary but like a third of\npeople I just do such a bad job at\nteaching that they don't understand what\nI'm saying\nhighly sensitive people we have a video\non rejection sensitivity we did that\nalready\ngo to video my girlfriend it\nokay are you talking about our\ncommunication video or the sexual libido\nanything on gut bacteria a ton of stuff\non gut bacteria and microbiome in the\nguides but more stuff on got bacteria\ncoming it's got bacteria sprinkled out\nthroughout stuff\nyes what video is it it's psychiatrist\nguide to conversation healthy gaming\ngamer webinar number seven I think so\nthat sounds

to\nFitness I'm with you\nmore lgbtq videos or interviews sure\nlet's do it\ncommunication webinar remastered when\nwhen y'all are willing to pay for it\nwe can't go remaking videos because\nwe've got all this other crap to make\nunless we get something out of it\nbluntly\nright\nso we'll work on it I'll add it to the\nlist\nchat I woke up at like four o'clock this\nmorning I've been working 14 hours every\nday this week\nI'm getting I'm getting crushed by this\njob\nbut hey how's the Titan challenge this\nis sad I actually missed two or three\ndays of Titan challenge so I I dropped\nshort
