    "transcript": "and the basic problem with social\nanxiety is all we're left with is our\nanalytical portion because we're not\nactually receiving data so we want to\nmake eye contact we don't want to make\neye contact for very long A lot of\npeople are wondering like okay how long\nshould I make eye contact you make eye\ncontact for one second at a time and\nthen you move on to something else if\nyou're part of a conversation you just\nlook at whoever is talking and when\nsomeone is talking what they're going to\nbe doing is automatically making eye\ncontact with everyone around them so you\nwant really brief periods of eye contact\nif you're in a one-on-one conversation\nyou don't want to stand directly across\nfrom them you usually actually ideally\nwant to be at like a 45 degree angle so\nyou can kind of look over at them while\nthey're talking and then you can like\nlook to like a neutral situation and you\nwant to sort of do this for like a one\nsecond period so it doesn't feel overly\nexcessive and you may sort of struggle\nwith this a little bit at the beginning\nyou don't have to count it'll actually\nfeel natural and your body and brain\nwill actually like take over on its own\nso how long you want to look over here\nokay you're saying this oh that's really\ninteresting as you speak you can kind of\nlike look to a neutral location okay"
