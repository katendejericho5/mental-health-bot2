    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about what\nyears or even Decades of gaming does to\nyour brain\n[Music]\nif you're a gamer chances are you're\nkind of living life on hard mode right\nother people are able to do things like\nhave fun activities like playing\nfootball or soccer or basketball they're\nable to socialize a little bit more\neasily they're able to focus on\nacademics and derive like reward and\npleasure but if you're a gamer you're\nkind of like you don't want to do that\nstuff right you'd rather just stay at\nhome and like play video games that's\nkind of fun and it sort of feels like\nlife is passing you by hey y'all I want\nto take a moment to thank the sponsor of\ntoday's video Babble Babble is the\npremium language learning app worldwide\nand I really love it because it teaches\nyou how to have real world conversations\nI recommend Babel for a couple of\nreasons the first is that it's\nincredibly authentic it was built by\nlanguage Educators so these are people\nwho have actually had a ton of\nexperience teaching people how to speak\nlanguages the second thing that I really\nlove about it is that it's\nscientifically backed they've been able\nto teach people how to speak the basics\nof a language in a minimum of three\nweeks and that's certainly what I'm\ngetting from Babel and what I love about\nthe app is that it's incredibly\naccessible even if I'm like sitting\naround and I don't feel like wasting\ntime on my phone I can learn about a\nculture or I can even play games that\nwill help reinforce my learning for\nexample I just recently learned how to\nsay aprendo espanol which means I'm\nlearning Spanish so I can use that\nphrase in today's video so if you're\ninterested in giving Babble a shot I\nhighly recommend it check out the link\nin the description below to get 60 off\nof your subscription and once again a\nhuge thank you to Babel for keeping\nmental health content on the internet\nfree being born with sort of the gamer\ntrait feels like a really bad debuff and\nI know that I certainly felt that way\neven when I was no longer a degenerate\ngamer so after I got into med school and\neven was like training to become a\npsychiatrist at Harvard I would look\naround at my colleagues and I would see\nthem like being able to do lots of stuff\nand I could do a lot but I still spent a\nlot of time 10 hours a week 20 hour\nhours a week gaming and I thought to\nmyself what could I accomplish if I was\nno longer a gamer what could I actually\naccomplish if I wasn't lazy or if I\ndidn't procrastinate because that's what\nGamers sort of say right we sort of\nthink to ourselves like oh my God I'm\njust lazy and other people are able to\nfind like intrinsic motivation but I\ncan't find intrinsic motivation and I\nlack discipline and I don't care so much\nabout the external world and so you sort\nof look at yourself and you wish that\nyou were different and so the cool thing\nis that there are actually ways that you\ncan change that and the key thing here\nis that it's actually you're not lazy\nyou're not born with a debuff it's\nactually that games will affect your\nbrain in ways that we don't really\nunderstand so the first thing we're\ngoing to dive into is dopamine and\nserotonin and we have to have a more\nsophisticated understanding of these\nneurotransmitters so dopamine is a\nneurotransmitter that governs reward\npleasure and behavioral reinforcement\nthe the key thing about dopamine is it\ntends to be triggered by things that are\nexternal so if I use a drug for example\nthat is something that I'm ingesting it\ncomes from the outside and it triggers\nthis dopamine release video games will\ntrigger dopamine release and basically\nanything external that is fun or\npleasurable will trigger a dopamine\nrelease and anything that's fun or\npleasurable will also reinforce that\nbehavior so when we play a video game\nand we have fun it triggers a dopamine\nrelease which is why we're having fun\nand then we reinforce the behavior so we\nwant to play again serotonin is a little\nbit different what serotonin really\ngoverns is an internal sense of\nwell-being and gives us things like\nconfidence so if we look at Gamers we\nengage in activities that give us lots\nof dopamine but don't actually give us\nmuch or any serotonin at all and so\nthat's what creates this sort of picture\nof like okay I'm capable of having fun\nbut I don't feel good I don't like feel\ngood in my own skin I don't feel con\nconfident I can't step away from the\ngame and so this balance or imbalance of\ndopamine and serotonin is responsible\nfor why Gamers sort of feel stuck to the\nscreen and can't go out and sort of move\nin the real world because moving in the\nreal world requires you to be confident\nabout yourself but if you're a gamer\nchances are when you leave the safety of\nyour computer or your console in these\nfour walls you're filled with\nuncertainty and a lack of confidence and\nthen you kind of retreat from that right\nbecause that's painful and it's\ndifficult and it's confusing and you\nkind of come back and then you kind of\nthink to yourself oh my God like why am\nI so lazy why am I so pathetic and you\nstart to think all of these things the\nweird thing about Gamers is that they\ndevelop a dopaminergic dependence along\nwith a serotonergic aversion and what do\nI mean by that so let's take a step back\nand understand how these two\nneurotransmitters normally function with\nlike a regular human being so when I was\nlike trying to become less generate I\nstarted going white water rafting a lot\nand I loved it so here's sort of the\nsequence of white water rafting when you\nfirst go rafting it's really really\nchallenging but it's full of like\nadrenaline right because you're like\npaddling really hard it's really Rocky\nyou're like flipping around and it's\nlike you're getting wet and it's cold\nand it's like really awesome adrenaline\nkind of experience and you're kind of\nfighting for your life so it's highly\ndopaminergic but the key thing is that\nafter you're done white water rafting\nthe next day you're completely destroyed\nevery muscle in your body is sore you're\nkind of like you can't do a whole lot\nbut you feel amazing even though\ntechnically your body is in pain you\nsort of bask in the feeling of like I\nfaced the river and I survived and I\nconquered it and you feel really really\ngood about yourself it's not pleasure\nthe next day you're not getting like\nactivated you're not laughing or\nanything like that but you get this\nsense of like well-being and contentment\nand sort of like this other kind of\nTriumph and we sort of look at other\nother parts of life you know if you look\nat sort of like studying for a test or\nan exam you study really hard it's\nreally painful and originally you get\nlike this reward of hopefully getting an\nA or a good grade but then there's this\nperiod afterward maybe when you graduate\nthat you sort of bask in this\naccomplishment and basking in that\naccomplishment is what causes serotonin\nto increase and so if we look at Gamers\nthey don't get to do that right because\nI still remember when I was like\nclimbing the Warcraft 3 ladder and I\nmade it to spot 83 it was the highest I\nwas number 83 on the ladder in the\nUnited States and I can't bask in that\naccomplishment like I can't go to people\nand like No One's Gonna have like a\ngraduation party of congrats Dr K you\nmade it to the top 100 of the latter\nlike each of those games felt really\ngood but I don't actually feel good\nabout myself afterward so what we see in\nGamers is that they have a dopaminergic\ndependence I.E you have to do things\nthat are dopaminergic because you're\neasily bored right and things are hard\nand then those activity these that are\nactually serotonergic are things that\nyou are aversive to so serotonergic\nactivities are things that can be\nchallenging but lead to a sense of\ncontentment not necessarily pleasure so\nthese are things that require a little\nbit more investment can be difficult and\ndon't necessarily have a really good\nreward at the end it's not like you get\na huge Prize or a rush of dopamine you\njust sort of feel good about yourself\nand if you're a gamer chances are there\nare things that you could do that would\nhelp you feel good about yourself you\nthink to yourself well if I did this I'd\nfeel better about myself but anytime you\ntry to actually go and do those things\nit's really really hard and that's where\nthat serotonergic aversion actually\ncomes in because we're actually averse\nto doing those kinds of activities and\nso if you're a gamer in order to\novercome that serotonergic aversion we\nneed to start engaging in serotonergic\nactivities so these are activities that\nare not pleasurable can be somewhat\ndifficult but help you feel good about\nyourself or accomplished when you're\ndone now this is what's really tricky is\nfinding the right balance of this\nbecause frequently these two these\nactivities are like really really hard\nto do so you can't like go out and like\ngo to a party or go hiking with a group\nof people or things like that so when I\nwas working with one particular gamer we\ncame up with a really good idea which is\nthis person was interested in free\ndiving they wanted to like dive without\nscuba gear and so we kind of came up\nwith a five minute or 10 minute stretch\nof walking where they would hold their\nbreath as long as they could not not\npassing out or anything like that so\ndon't do anything dangerous but they\nwould start by holding their breath\nwhile walking that's the only thing they\ndid so on the first day they could hold\ntheir breath for 30 seconds and then on\nthe next day they can hold their breath\nfor 40 seconds and 50 seconds and over\nthe course of like two weeks three weeks\nall they had to do was go for a five\nminute walk a 10 minute walk and you can\ndo that and they were holding their\nbreath and over time they could hold\ntheir breath for five minutes six\nminutes seven minutes they would go for\nhalf hour walks hour long walks where\nthey're holding their breath for eight\nminutes nine minutes at a time right so\nthey're taking 10 15 20 breaths where\nthey're holding it and so this is a\ngreat example of an activity that is\nlike kind of hard it's not something\nthat you can really brag about but as\nyou make progress you will feel good\nabout yourself so try to find something\nthat is challenging to do kind of\naccessible to do you don't want to like\ntack on too much but isn't actually fun\nbut makes you feel good about yourself\nso you can do something as simple as go\nfor a walk and hold your breath the\nsecond problem we're going to deal with\nis how gaming interacts with your\nnegative emotions when we play video\ngames it actually suppresses our\nnegative emotional circuitry so anything\nthat is addictive one of the reasons it\nbecomes addictive is not just because of\ndopamine it's not because of just the\npleasure it gives us but because of what\nit takes away so we have this part of\nthe brain called the amygdala and the\namygdala is our survival center of the\nbrain but it's also the part of our\nbrain that governs our negative emotion\nso it makes us feel fear anxiety panic\nand things like that so the first thing\nthat's really interesting is that the\namygdala becomes hyper reactive when we\nare in low serotonin States so the lower\nour serotonin is the more hyperactive or\njittery our amygdala is and if we're\ndoing a lot of gaming where we're\ngetting dopamine without serotonin the\nfirst thing we have to understand is\nit's priming our amygdala to be\nhypersensitive so Gamers will literally\nexperience fear or anxiety or Panic or\nthe sense of dread and uncertainty more\nrapidly and more intensely than the\naverage person and this is why in\nPsychiatry if we have people who have\npanic attacks which oftentimes will\nstart in the amygdala the treatment that\nwe give them is actually serotonergic\nmedications ssris there's also evidence\nthat people who have been traumatized\nand are hyper Vigilant and kind of\nparanoid that serotonin can help them in\nsome ways too so this is what's really\ntricky is we have this hyper react\nactive amygdala and why do we have a\nhyper-reactive amygdala it may be\nbecause of Serotonin but there's another\nlayer at play here so if I'm going\nthrough life and I'm feeling fear if I'm\nfeeling anxious if I'm feeling dread\nabout the future my brain wants to make\nthose things go away and in the past we\nwould have to make those things go away\nby fixing a problem right so if I'm like\nfeeling lonely and I existed as a human\nbeing 5 000 years ago I couldn't\nmagically make that loneliness go away I\nwould have to engage with other people\nto sort of like no longer feel lonely\nnow the problem is with video games we\ncan make that emotion of loneliness go\naway we can make our anxiety go away we\ncan make our fear go away and you may\nsay to yourself but Dr K like that can\nsort of be a good thing right there's\none crucial thing that happens when we\nshut off our negative emotional\ncircuitry which is that we stop learning\nso if you're a gamer chances are you're\ngoing through life with an ex P penalty\nso if you look around at the people in\nyour like General vicinity right they\nseem to be making progress in life\npeople finish college they get jobs they\nget married they have kids they get\npromoted they go on vacation and for a\nlot of Gamers we kind of get stuck right\nwe're sort of like in our 20s we're not\nquite making as much progress we're\nmaking some progress but everything\nfeels harder progressing through life\nfeels really difficult and it turns out\nthat video games are actually\nresponsible for this in the way that\nthey affect your brain and this comes\ndown to how video games impact your\nability to learn from your mistakes so\nwhen I was in college like I would\nprocrastinate and play video games and\nthen like I'd have a test and then the\nday before the test I'd sort of enter\nthis last minute Panic stage of studying\nand I'd study study study and I'd pass\nthe test and then I'd be filled with\nregret I'd be like man like if I could\ncould have started a day earlier or\nthree days earlier if I had started four\ndays earlier five days earlier I could\nget an A and so I I should learn my\nlesson at that point but I never did the\nnext test would roll around I'd wait\ntill the last minute I'd procrastinate\nand I'd end up getting maybe a b maybe a\nc and if I knew if I just worked a\nlittle bit harder I could do so much\nbetter and that's what the experience of\na lot of Gamers is like in life that\ny'all work really hard for brief periods\nof time and then you do okay but if it\nweren't for this problem of gaming then\nyou would do so much better and so\nwhat's going on in our brain and how can\nwe fix this it turns out that the reason\nthat Gamers progress more slowly is\nbecause they actually have an XP penalty\nand what do I mean from that it means\nthat they're learning circuitry is\nactually impaired so our learning\ncircuitry or the learning part of our\nbrain is called our hippocampus which is\nkind of seated right next to the\namygdala so the hippocampus is what\ngoverns learning and memory and the key\nthing about how our brains learn is the\nmost primary motivator for Learning and\nchanging behavior is actually negative\nemotion so if you go to a restaurant\nlike five times and you like eating\nthere the food is delicious but the\nsixth time you go if you get food\npoisoning you're never going to go to\nthe restaurant again and so if we sort\nof think about how did you learn that\nlesson through pain and suffering I've\nalso worked with a ton of people who\nhave struggled with infidelity and\nmarriage and once that trust is broken\nyou can be married to someone for 10\nyears 15 years you can trust them a lot\nbut all it takes is one instance of\ninfidelity for you to learn your lesson\nand in some cases this can be so\ntraumatic that people struggle to trust\nfor the rest of their lives so that's\nreally powerful learning going on and\nit's governed by negative emotional\ncircuitry so what do video games do\nvideo games shut off our negative\nemotional circuitry so any addictive\nsubstance does two things it brings\npleasure and it takes away pain and what\nvideo games essentially do is shut off\nblood flow to places like our amygdala\nwhere we fear feel fear and panic and\nanxiety and since we're are shutting off\nour negative emotions every time we play\na video game which is why we play them\nright because after you were done with\nthat test and you were like man I really\nneed to start studying earlier what did\nyou end up doing for the rest of the day\nyou gamed and the moment that you game\nyou shut off that negative emotional\ncircuitry and you hamper your learning\nand start to develop that XP penalty so\nwhat can we do about this essentially\nthe first place to start is to actually\nbe able to sit with negative emotions we\ndon't need to conquer them we don't need\nto fix them we don't need to process\nthem they're going to do the work on\ntheir own we just have to not numb them\nout so what I strongly recommend to\nGamers who feel like you've got an XP\npenalty if you're not just making\nprogress what you need to do is spend\nsome time sitting with your emotions\nnow Gamers May Wonder well how can I do\nthat there's one really simple exercise\nyou can do is if you've been bearing\nyour emotions for years because you\ngained too much they're floating right\nbeneath the surface so all you need to\ndo is give them a neutral space so the\nnext time you're feeling negative\nemotion don't reach for any kind of\nadvice or anything like that just sit\nsomewhere or Pace for like five to\nfifteen minutes the other thing that you\ncan do is just stare at a wall so like\nthis is a practice that I've given\npeople it's been transformative and\nrevolutionary stare at a wall for 20\nminutes up to an hour and what's going\nto happen is as you stare at the wall\nlike you're gonna start by feeling bored\nyour mind is going to wander and then\nyou'll start to notice like negative\nemotions come up frustration feeling\nlike I'm being inefficient I'm wasting\ntime I don't like this those are\nactually all negative motions and all\nyou need to do you don't need to fix\nthem you just need to be able to feel\nthem and be able to tolerate them\nbecause the moment that you're able to\ntolerate them you don't have to retreat\ninto the video game if you don't retreat\ninto the video game the emotional\nactivity in the brain will be restored\nif the emotional activity in the brain\nis restored it will start working on\nyour negative emotional circuitry so I\nwant you all to think about why we have\nemotions for a second we'll really\nunderstand this point it's like 5 000\nyears ago if a human being experienced a\nnegative emotion like feeling lonely\nwhat could they do to make that emotion\ngo away that negative emotion would\nprompt them to engage with other human\nbeings in the same way that hunger\nprompts me to eat that's negative right\nmakes me feel bad thirst prompts me to\ndrink loneliness prompts me to reach out\nto other people that's why we have\nnegative emotions because they prompt us\ntowards the most important behaviors\nnowadays we have a very serious problem\nbecause when we play a video game we can\nmake the loneliness go away for a little\nbit but it doesn't actually fix any of\nour problems so we don't actually\nprogress or improve in our life at all\nso we're taking away that negative\nemotional energy leading ourselves to\nliterally not learn that XP penalty and\nalso not progress in life the third\nthing that video games do that really\nhamper our progress in life is they do\nall of the operationalization for us now\nI gotta explain what that means so when\nyou play a video game everything is laid\nout there's a main quest there is a side\nquest there's a mini map all the rules\nare laid out you can open up like you\nknow the encyclopedia which gives you\nthe mechanics of the game everything is\nlaid out for you and for the stuff that\nisn't laid out in the game there's a\nthousand different websites or YouTube\ntutorials or whatever that they can show\nyou where to stand and what to click and\noptimizing DPS rotations all the rules\nof Life are laid out in a video game and\nwhat you should do from start to finish\nsomeone is holding your hand real life\ndoes not work like that so what I found\nwhen I work with Gamers is they have a\nvery particular deficit which is that\nthey cannot operationalize prop problems\nwhat that means is that Gamers can't\ntake an abstract task like become\nfinancially independent and break it\ndown into pieces why can't they do that\nit's because games have been doing this\ncrap for you for so long that literally\nthe circuits in your brain that do this\nstart to atrophy and wither so if your\nbrain doesn't use a particular\nfunctionality it starts to wither this\nis why we forget languages we forget\nskills we forget stories anything that\nwe don't continually engage with and\nlose just like any muscle in our body we\nstart to become deconditioned and so\nwhat Gamers really struggle with is like\nmoving forward in life because they\ndon't know how to take these like big\nthings that you're supposed to be doing\nlike be happy well how do you do that I\ndon't know how to do that be financially\nindependent be successful find a\nromantic relationship and it's like you\ndon't you're like where where's the\nquest marker for that like I'm confused\nlike anytime I go to a party and I hang\nout with people I don't see an excellent\nanimation point in someone that I'm\nattracted to that I can walk up and then\nI right click them and then I'm like\nokay is my reputation high enough like\ndo I need to gift this thing to make\nthem like me and that's what [ __ ]\nGamers do right they're like how do I\nlike what's the rules to this game where\nI can get this person to to do how do I\nsucceed how do I fulfill the quest\nobjectives and so what they end up doing\nis they think like oh like I\nprocrastinate because they don't get\nstarted but it's not like the reason\nthey don't get started is because they\nprocrastinate it's because the reason\nthey don't get started is because they\ndon't know how to get started because\nfor a decade there's been a computer\nthat's telling you exactly what to do\nfor like six hours a day and so your\nbrain is like I don't know how to do\nthat so what we really need to help\nGamers do and thankfully we can do stuff\nabout this so don't panic is take that\nabstract task and we need to teach y'all\nhow to operationalize how to take this\nGlobal main quest right because even if\nyou think about a video game a main\nquest is really long but you don't even\nthink think about the end at the\nbeginning there's like there are\ncheckpoints like there's the first part\nof the main quest and the second part in\nthe third part and the fourth part so we\nneed to use our cognitive skills to\nbreak down the main quests of life into\nlittle pieces there's a really simple\nexercise to do that so anything that you\nwant to accomplish\nanything just whatever it is can you do\nit right now the answer is no okay so\nthis is what you're good at we're going\nto leverage your strengths to overcome\nyour weaknesses take that task and split\nit into two parts okay so let's say like\nI want to become financially independent\nso can I do that like right now the\nsecond no so what am I going to do I'm\ngonna break it into two parts okay what\ndoes that mean that means retire and\nbefore I retire I have to like get a job\nso those are the two pieces can I retire\nno can I get a job can I do that right\nthis second no so then okay what does it\ntake to get a job split that into two\npieces okay so like getting a job\nrequires like having a job like going to\na job for a while and then like applying\nfor a job or finding a job can you apply\nfor a job within the next five minutes\ncan you do that can you do it literally\nright now if the answer is no break that\napart okay well why can't you apply for\na job what are the two pieces of\napplying for a job that's going to an\ninterview and submitting an application\ncan you submit an application right this\nsecond if the answer is no what is that\ninvolved that involves a resume Do you\nhave a resume right now no I don't have\na resume what does that involve that\ninvolves finding a template doing some\nresearch making a list of your\nactivities unless you can do something\nwithin five minutes and have that task\ndone I want you to break that apart into\ntwo pieces and you keep on breaking it\napart and what you're gonna end up with\nis a [ __ ] main quest quest line right\nlike that's what you're going to end up\nwith you're gonna end up with 50 000\ntasks that are very very minute go talk\nto this person in this Village and\ndeliver this thing and then you're gonna\nget some XP and then they're gonna give\nyou the next thing and then you're gonna\ngo and you're gonna go hunt boars for\nboar tails and you're gonna take those\nbortells and you're gonna take them to\nthe Alchemist you got to do that for\nyour own life because your brain\nliterally does not know how to\nautomatically do that so if you've been\nplaying games for a very long time like\nme and especially if you started early\nin life it's gonna change or shape the\nway that your brain evolves the way that\nyour brain evolves or the way that it\nkind of grows up and develops is going\nto lead leave you with certain deficits\nnow the biggest mistake that Gamers make\nis that they assume that these deficits\nare baked into the character they assume\nthat when I generated this character I\npicked the lazy trait and so since I\npicked the lazy trait I will be lazy for\nthe rest of my life I also picked the\nprocrastinator trait and I also picked\nthese traits and these are things that\nare baked into your character but\nthey're not they're actually\nNeuroscience deficits that gaming\ninduces and if we start to reverse those\nNeuroscience deficits if we start to do\nthings like operationalize our problems\nand go through a formal cognitive\nprocess if we start doing things like\nsitting with our emotions instead of\nretreating the video games we will start\nto learn better we'll remove that XP\npenalty and the last and arguably most\nimportant thing is really understanding\nthe difference between dopamine and\nserotonin serotonin and how Gamers or\ndopaminergically dependent and\nserotonergically aversive and so what\nwe've really got to do is start to\nengage in some of these activities that\nwill are serotonin inducing in nature\nand so once we start to do those we will\ndevelop a sense of well-being we will\ndevelop a sense of confidence and as we\ndevelop that well-being and confidence\nmoving out into the world is no longer\nlike overwhelming we're gonna cleanse\nall those debuffs and then suddenly\nwe're playing the game of Life on an\neven footing\nforeign"
