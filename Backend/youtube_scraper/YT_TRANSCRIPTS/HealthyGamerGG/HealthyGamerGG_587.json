    "transcript": "welcome\nto Twitch\nand thank you for being here\ndo you want to just tell us a little bit\nabout\num you know how you like to be addressed\nand you can call me today call me by my\nfirst name okay and you can call me all\nOak if you would like to sure um so\nwelcome vivec and I understand that your\nSurgeon General of the United States\nthat's right what's that like\nit's a it's an incredible privilege to\nbe able to serve and it's different\nevery day as people often ask me what's\na typical day in the life and it's uh\nit's quite different some days I you\nknow I'm traveling to communities across\nthe country working with people on some\nof our priority issues whether that's\nmental health or or other issues that\nthey're concerned about uh other days\nI'm here working with a lot of our\nstrategic Partners in Washington DC both\nin and outside of government and we're\nalways building in new initiatives and\nlaunching new products you know most\nrecently we\num you know launched an initiative\naround addressing loneliness and\nisolation which are profound challenges\nfor the country as well as some broader\ntopics related to mental health\nincluding social media use so it's an\nincredible\nyou know a job and an experience and uh\nat least something happens once a day I\nwould say at least once a day that\nreminds me of how\njust what a blessing it is to be able to\nserve in this capacity so awesome man so\ncan you just tell us a little bit so I\nknow you all have released three\nadvisories in like rapid pacing\num so one on youth mental health one on\nisolation and loneliness and one on\nsocial media can you tell us like what's\ngoing on with like mental health in this\ncountry today\nyeah so we we have uh released a number\nof advisories related to youth mental\nhealth uh and mental health I'd say more\nbroadly\nand the reason we've done that is\nbecause in covid-19 the pandemic we've\ncome through this has really put a real\nstrain on people's mental health and\nwell-being and we're seeing it uh in in\nthe numbers in terms of anxiety and\ndepression but we are also we also know\nthat even long even before the pandemic\nlong before covid-19 arrived there was a\nmental health crisis in America uh we\ndid kids for example\nfrom the decade prior to the pandemic\nthere was a 57 increase in the suicide\nrate among young people and we had seen\nin the day also in the decade prior to\nthe pandemic that more and more high\nschool students were saying that they\nfelt persistently sad or hopeless uh and\nthat number now stands close to half and\nso we knew that there was a problem\nbeforehand and sadly the pandemic poured\nfuel on that fire\nbut the reason that I made this a\npriority and why we've worked on some\nmental health from so many different\nangles is because I really believe that\nmental health is a fuel that allows us\nto show up in our lives at work at\nschool for our families for our\ncommunities\num and many of us know this actually\nintuitively like if you think about\na day when you were struggling with your\nmental health or a period that you went\nthrough when you were having a tough\ntime with your mental health but most\npeople know that that was a time where\nsometimes it was harder to really focus\non work or to do work or maybe you\ndidn't do as well in school or you\nweren't able to just be present with\nyour friends you know with your family\nmembers as much as you normally would\nmaybe you tended to volunteer less or\nengage Less in your community our mental\nhealth is is really what impacts how we\nshow up in the world and so addressing\nmental health to me is really key to\naddressing not just the health of\nindividuals but the health of society\nmore broadly wow okay and and what do\nyou think we can do about that like what\nshould like social media is is all over\nthe place like how do we handle this\nbecause we're growing up in this\nenvironment right\nwell we are and one thing I need to\nrealize is that as big as a challenge as\nmental health is there are actually a\nlot of things we can do as individuals\nto help not only ourselves but other\npeople but their mental health and\nwell-being and you know this is an\naddition of course to all of the policy\nactions that we have to take in the\nprogrammatic uh you know changes that we\nthat we can\nthat we can take on which will help make\nmental health care more available to\npeople that will help invest in\nprevention that will help to ensure that\nwe're using technology in particular to\nbring care to where people are as\nopposed to waiting for them to drive 30\nmiles and wait three months to get an\nappointment so there's a lot that we\nhave to do in terms of programs and\npolicies to make care more available and\naddress the root causes of mental\nillness but as individuals it turns out\nthere's a lot we can do too so like\nnumber one we know\nthat strengthening the social Connection\nin our life helps it with mental health\nwhen people struggle with loneliness and\nisolation it actually increases their\nrisk of depression and anxiety and\nsuicide so think about this for a moment\nlike each of us most of us are living\nbusy lives right and a lot of times what\ngets edged out in those busy lives are\nare people right so but if we can take\n15 minutes a day to reach out to people\nwe care about if we can make sure that\nwhen we're talking to friends catching\nup with family members that we're\nactually fully present\nduring our conversations that we're not\ndistracted by devices these are simple\nways that we can actually start to\nstrengthen our relationships again the\nsecond thing that we can do is we can be\nmindful of our\nuse of Technology recognizing that\ntechnology in the day it can be a\nblessing or a curse it can help it can\nhurt it depends how it's designed and\nhow we use it and what has happened over\nthe last you know couple of decades is\nthat technology has really taken over so\nmany elements of our life we get up\nfirst thing we do so many times is look\nat our devices and it's the last thing\nwe see before we go to bed at night but\nit's also invaded our space for our\nconversation it's taken the time that we\nperhaps had when we were just thinking\nor reflecting or reading a book and and\nperhaps eliminated that time so one of\nthe things we can do with when it comes\nto Technologies we can draw boundaries\naround our use of technology and say\nokay there's certain times in my day\nwhere I'm going to actually create a\ntech free zone right and that could be\nthe time right before you go to bed and\nthroughout the night\nbecause protecting sleep is vital for\nyour mental health and well-being and we\nknow that when kids in particular a\nthird of adolescents say they're sitting\nup until midnight or later on weekdays\nuh on using their devices and that uses\npredominantly social media so we can\ndraw those kind of zones another Zone\nactually would be around meal times when\nwe're with other people so we can just\nfocus on them and another time would\nactually be physical activity when we're\nout you know working out or you know\nplaying a game of pick up soccer or\nbasketball or doing whatever it is that\ngives us sort of the chance to be\nphysically active making sure that's\nalso a space where we don't have uh\nwe're not sort of constantly distracted\nby uh by our devices can be helpful too\nso there are a lot of there's a lot we\ncan do as individuals but the last thing\nI'll mention uh was perhaps one of the\nmost important is we can make sure that\nwe're checking on one another uh\nthroughout our days and it turns out\nthat there are a lot of people who who\nare walking around today who feel\ninvisible who feel alone who even though\nthey're surrounded by lots of people\nthey just feel like they there's no one\nwho really cares about them per se that\npeople are busy with their own lives and\nthat they've become increasingly\ninvisible and sometimes simply by\nchecking on a co-worker or a classmate\nor reaching out uh to a friend not for a\nparticular reason or because you need\nsomething but just to say hey I'm\nthinking of you want to see how you're\ndoing that can make all the difference\nin the world especially at a time where\nso many people are feeling invisible and\nlike they don't belong yeah so that\nsounds great can I challenge some of\nthat a little bit sure so the stuff that\nyou're saying sounds weird to me\nand like like you just pick like how\ndoes that like you say you know talk to\nsomeone for 15 minutes a day leave your\nhouse and go play pick up soccer or pick\nup basketball uh like like and it sounds\nkind of like a weird question but but\nisn't that weird how do you actually do\nthat\nso well I'm glad I'm glad you asked so\nit turns out that it may feel a bit\nweird because we become less accustomed\nto doing these things like in recent\nyears but the truth is this is actually\nwhat we have done for generations and\nthis is actually how we've evolved as\nhuman beings over thousands of years is\nto have face-to-face interactions with\none another to have some frequency of\ninteraction\nnow you know talking to someone for 15\nminutes a day this doesn't have to be\nhard you could think about\na friend who you have been talked to in\na while or a friend you've talked to\noften you can think about a family\nmember you can think about uh a\nco-worker who you could catch up with\nmaybe over over lunch or just have a\nconversation with at the beginning or\nend of the day they're people who are\nactually pretty close to us or\napproximate in our lives and uh\nsometimes it's literally just a simple\nphone call you know or a text to them to\nsay hey I'm thinking of you want to know\nhow you're doing that can build a bridge\nthat will feel a lot easier once you've\ndone it uh whereas before I know\nsometimes they can feel like the\nactivation energy to reach out\ncan be pretty high but the one other\ninteresting thing I'll tell you is that\nif you if you're thinking gosh this\nfeels unusual to like reach out and talk\nto someone for 15 minutes a day you're\nnot the only one who feels that the\nperson you're reaching out to may also\nbe inhibited about reaching out to other\npeople and not do it but here's\ninterestingly I'll tell you is a vast\nmajority of Time When You Reach Out\npeople welcome it it may be unusual but\nthat actually makes it all the more\nwelcome I'll give you a simple example\num I don't know when the last time was I\nlooked at maybe you wrote a letter to\nsomebody uh you know like a physical\nletter and mailed it to them\nbut it doesn't happen very often anymore\nright because we just write emails or we\nsend a text message or you know we we\ncommunicate in some other way but\nwhenever you do receive a message like\nthink about the last time you received a\nletter like from a friend this is epic\nyeah it actually you're like wow this is\nso unusual this is so interesting like\nit makes it even more special uh that\nyou're receiving that and I just\nrecently received a letter from a friend\nand I don't get letters very often\nanymore\num but it was like incredible just to\nlike see the time somebody had actually\ntaken time to write something to me a\ngood friend and it meant like even more\nto me than it would have like 20 years\nago\nall that just to say that when you reach\nout to other people even though it might\nfeel a little weird or unusual\num if you're not used to doing that just\nknow that you will almost always feel\nbetter having done it and the person you\nreached out to will feel better too even\nmore so because it's become a more\nunusual thing for people to do you know\nin Modern Life\nbut if I write someone letter aren't\nthey gonna think I'm weird\nlike isn't that a weird thing to do\nwell you don't have to write them a\nletter you can call them if you want but\nbut if you did choose to write them a\nletter and they would probably think\nit's very unusual but I don't know that\nthey were necessarily but they were my\nguess or my own experience is that they\nwould probably be touched that hey you\nthought enough of them to actually write\nthem a letter so I think they're doing\nsomething super cool here which I think\nis subtle so I asked you do you think\nit's weird and you said it's probably\nunusual and I think even the way that\nyou're talking about it is really\ninteresting because my word choice is\nloaded with judgment which I think is\nactually a huge part of what people\nnowadays struggle with they're like if I\njust pick up the phone and call I was\nthinking about you\nthat can seem creepy like hello vivec\nI've been thinking about you you know so\nyeah no it's it's an interesting point I\nthink it's really in how you phrase it\nbut the difference to me between unusual\nand weird is exactly what you said it's\njudgment and but the thing is when\nsomething is unusual that can actually\nmake it feel more special right so like\nwhen I interested in talk to people\nout there who have struggled with\nloneliness is by the way a lot of people\ndo one in two adults in America report\nmeasurable levels of loneliness and it's\neven higher among young people but when\nI talk to folks who have received that\nkind of Outreach the unexpected call\nfrom a friend or unexpected message from\na family member\neven when they're you a lot of times\nthey're surprised but they are they're\ngrateful it's like if you walk around\nfeeling like you know what nobody really\ndoes no one seems to really care about\nme if I disappear tomorrow no one would\neven like notice and then someone\nactually does notice you and they say\nHey you know you're popping in my head\nthe other day I was just wondering how\nyou're doing I wanted to check on you\num you're like wow like I actually\nmatter to somebody you know somebody\ncared enough about me to reach out so\nwhat I want people to know is that at a\ntime where so many people are struggling\nwith their own self-worth with a sense\nof loneliness sometimes that very simple\nOutreach from you can have a powerful\nimpact on them and sometimes we may not\nrealize it because it just seems like\nI'm just making a phone call to them or\nwriting them a message but it can be a\nLifeline to people who otherwise are\nfeeling isolated yeah I I think that's\nbeautifully said and I think it's it's\nfascinating how the way you're you use\nlanguage I think that's what's missing\nbecause anytime we think about doing\nsomething we attach some kind of\njudgment to our own actions we think\nit's weird whereas you're acknowledging\nit's not\ncommonplace but that doesn't necessarily\nmean it's bad and I think a lot of times\npeople in our community and on the\ninternet we will negotiate against\nourselves and think about the worst\nversion of this right like what people\nwill think I'm weird but I think it's\nspot on I think one way to kind of think\nabout it is if someone did this and\nreached out to you and was like Hey just\nwondering how you're doing\num\nyou know that I mean I think people in\nour community acknowledge that that\nfeels good one other thing if we can\nbump up the difficulty a little bit so\nif someone reaches out to you I think\nit's reached a point where we don't\nreally know how to respond to those\nopen-ended authentic desires for\nconnection as opposed to hey do you want\nto grab food sometime or you know do you\nwant to queue up for a video game how do\nyou respond if someone like writes you a\nletter or calls you or DMS you without\nan ulterior motive\nyeah so that's a really good question\nbecause you're right there's this whole\ndialogue that goes down in our heads\nbefore we think about how to respond\nright we're thinking one what am I\nreally feeling do I want to share with\nthem what will they think about me if I\nshare it with them will they tell\nsomebody else if I share it with them\nlike how I feel by myself if I'm really\nopen with like there are all of these\ndialogues that are going on in our head\nbefore we even utter a word in response\nand sometimes that can become\ncomplicated and confusing and it can\nultimately sometimes result they're not\nsaying nothing and just moving past the\nmessages just respond later right\nhere's what I try to do and I've\nactually I the reason I know this in\npart is because I've actually felt it\nyeah I've been one of those people who's\ngotten sometimes those outreaches over\nthe years and unsure what to say I just\nsay I'll respond later and then days go\nby and I never respond right and that's\nnot ideal so what I've defaulted to is\njust a way to really simplify it which\nis it might sound a little scary but\nit's actually the to me the simplest\nthing to do and it helps me actually\nrespond quickly which is two words just\nto be real\nthat's it right so in those moments I'm\ntrying to think well what will they\nthink well well how they perceive me Etc\nI just say you know what let me just be\nreal here let me just be honest about\nwhat I'm feeling what I'm doing like\nwhat I'm thinking right now\nand the first time a few times I did\nthat I braced myself I was like well how\nare they going to respond are they gonna\nthink I'm weird are they not going to\nrespond which would be perhaps even the\nworst because then they maybe think I'm\nterribly weird and uh so much so that\nthey couldn't write back\nbut I'll tell you this every time I\nrealized almost every time when we're\nreal with somebody else what we're doing\nis we're not just giving ourselves a\nchance to be authentic which by the way\nfeels good in the long term\nbut we're actually telling the other\nperson hey it's okay for you to be real\ntoo\nis a lot of times that's what people\nwant right if you think about some of\nthe best conversations that we've had in\nour lives right they're usually\nconversations where we didn't have to\npretend to be someone else we didn't\nhave to put on errors we didn't have to\nput on fronts right we could just like\nliterally be real be ourselves and not\nworry the other person was going to\njudge us for it and we're in one of\nthose moments where we have all built so\nmany layers around us we've become\nprofessional mask wearers you know we\nwalk around with these masks that are\nshaped by what we think Society wants\nwhat we think other people want us to be\nbut\nunderneath all that is us right and this\nis a time to actually slowly peel that\nstuff back and say you know what it's\ngoing to be real let their chips fall\nwhere they may but I'll tell you almost\nalways they fall in a place where people\nare grateful for the authenticity and\nencourages them to be open as well\nyeah I I loved um as you were sort of\narticulating that internal dialogue it\nsounds like you're one of us underneath\neverything which is awesome and and chat\nby the way is loving everything you're\nsaying and I think it's it's impactful\nin a different way because I think when\nwe think about you we think about like\nthis this is not a regular human being\nthis is the Surgeon General of the\nUnited States\nand\nI'll tell you one other thing I looked\nat you know I I'm I'm an introvert you\nknow some of the folks on here may be\nintroverts as well but I'm also a shy\nintrovert right so like growing up let\nme tell you that was particularly tough\nbecause you know there were times I\nwanted to like make friends hang out you\nknow play ball with other kids Etc but I\nhad a hard time sort of figuring out how\nto start a conversation or kind of get\ngoing I was always worried people are\ngonna maybe think poorly of me or judge\nme or I'd say the wrong thing and so I\nwould I would think a lot you know\ninternally before I said anything and\nwould overthink things a lot and I'll\ntell you it was really exhausting it was\nreally exhausting and it led to a lonely\nexperience because I wasn't reaching out\nand making the kind of friendships that\nI really wanted to make\nand it took me a long time to to kind of\nget over that to realize that what felt\nlike a really risky move which is just\nbeing myself and just saying what was on\nmy mind\num\nthat that actually turned out was the\nbetter path you know it felt scary\ninitially but it felt so much better\nlike in the in the long term and it\nactually helped me actually reach out\nand connect other people and then I\nwould realize that they were feeling the\nsame way in fact years after I was in\ngrade school I reconnected with a bunch\nof friends from there and they all told\nme something very interesting because I\nwas looking at their lives when I was in\nschool thinking wow these guys seem to\nhave it all together they seem to be\nhanging out with other people they're\nhaving a great time I'm the only one\nwho's like sort of shy and uh and\nintroverted and having a hard time\nconnecting but they all told me to a t\nthey're like you know we felt the same\nway too that we were having a hard time\nconnecting we felt weird we felt\nisolated and awkward I was like God I\nhad no idea that these other people were\nfeeling the same way\num so the bottom line is like if if\nyou're out there feeling like sometimes\nit's hard to connect or feeling like\nyou're having a whole internal dialogue\nthat's like paralyzing you from acting\nand reaching out to other people just no\nyou're not alone there are a lot of\npeople who are struggling with this but\nthis is like the power of moments where\nwe can be real is that we can break that\ncycle we can short circuit uh those\nthoughts that are like you know cycling\nthrough our head uh and we can have a\ngenuine human interaction and I'll just\ntell you when that's an act of Courage\nan act of Courage give other people the\ncourage to act as well\nyeah that's so fascinating can I ask you\nmore about this yeah so so I I totally\nget that long term right you've learned\nthe lesson\nthat reaching out can be initially scary\nbut that over time it you form\nconnections with people it's great\nfantastic but in that initial stuff he\nsaid it took you a long time and that's\nwhere I imagine actually most of our\naudiences now they're not in the later\nstages they're in the oh my God this is\nterrifying do you remember\nwhat you're like\nalmost like minute process when you were\nworking on this like what what could you\ndo to actually make it easier on\nyourself\nyeah that's a it's a good question\num\nso a couple things to say one is\nthe time that it was hardest for me was\nin building up to actually reaching out\nbut the time where it started to feel\nbetter\nwas about probably 15 to 20 seconds into\nlike their response\nbecause I realized after that that I had\nopened the door and that someone else\nwas walking through it that it wasn't\njust like opening it and there was no\none there or people ran the other way uh\nbut it only took 15 or 20 seconds right\nbecause you're putting something out and\nthen you're waiting for a response\nbut a couple of things that I found to\nbe helpful and this is actually some\ninteresting research behind this as well\nwhich is that if you picture\num\nif you if you assume that the other\nperson is going to have a positive\nresponse to you that actually changes\nhow you show up in the conversation so\nif you and I are meeting for the first\ntime I look and we just did a few\nminutes ago and if I assume that alok is\ngoing to like me right then that\nactually turns out makes me warmer in my\ninteractions toward you and that warmth\nis perceived by the other person and\nincreases the likelihood that they will\nlike me and it becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy and so there's some interesting\nresearch behind that but like so one of\nthe things I try to do is if I'm feeling\nnervous about an interaction right\nwhether it's an interaction at work or\nwith a you know with somebody socially\nwhatever it might be I just had a pause\nfor a minute to take a deep breath and\nthen picture them enjoying my company\nyou know and and liking our conversation\nand it turns out that changes how I\nbehave\num the other thing that I try to remind\nmyself of\nand when I do feel some trepidation\nabout reaching out is I try to remember\nmy history and try to remember the\ninstances where I did actually reach out\nright even when it felt weird or felt\nawkward and I try to remember how that\nfelt right so speaking of of unusual uh\nyou know practices I'll tell you about\nsomething that I did in medical school\nwhich was uh unusual so I mentioned I\nwas shy and introverted growing up that\nwas throughout grade schools throughout\ncollege and it was into like the\nbeginning of medical school but I was\nstarting med school I remember and I was\n100 classmates right all people I'd\nnever met before I was like excited to\nbe part of the community but I was like\nI'm not like typically the kind of\nperson who like goes to Big raging\nparties and like meets people there and\nlike you know and goes to clubs and like\nmake something you know best friends\nlike that just doesn't feel like the\nright of you know comfortable\nenvironment for me I was more\ncomfortable with like one-on-one or\nsmall group conversation so here's what\nI decided to do I said you know I'm\ngonna use my time that I have for lunch\nand dinner when a lot of us are in the\ncafeteria together I'm just gonna ask\nsomebody who I'm interested in if they\nwant to have lunch and I just have like\na one-on-one conversation with them over\nlunch\nnow if you think about it like that can\nseem like a bit of a unusual or scary\nthing to do right like you know\neveryone's like hanging out the capture\nand you're asking somebody to like you\nknow just uh get together and have lunch\none-on-one and I would do like you know\nvery simply like after a lecture or\nsomething you know if I was sitting next\nto somebody and actually was having a\nlittle compromise all right I thought\nhey there's an interesting person I'd\nlove to chat with them I'd just say hey\nyou know I'm gonna be having lunch in\nthe cafeteria later today or or tomorrow\nlike do you want to you want to get a\nbite together you know we'd love to chat\nuh and and you know almost in fact I\ncan't think of an instance where someone\nsaid no but here's the interesting thing\nI try to remember those conversations\nwere some of the best conversations I\nhad in my five years in graduate school\nI made friends through those\nconversations because we the doors open\nwe got to know each other friends who\nhave like remained dear friends to this\nday and even though it seemed like an\nunusual thing\na couple months into that\nI started getting complaints from people\nwho said how come you haven't asked me\nyet you know to come and have lunch or\ndinner one-on-one when is my turn and it\nwas one of those moments when I realized\nthat I wasn't the only one craving\nconnection\nthere were a lot of other people craving\nit as well but I was blind to that so I\ntry to remember my past also in thinking\neven though sometimes I might feel\nscared to reach out the moments where\nI've been courageous enough to do it in\nthe past it's led to amazing experiences\nand great friendships and it reminds me\nthat hey a lot of us are in this boat of\nwanting to connect more deeply\nso here's what I'm kind of hearing\num so I think it's really interesting\nbecause I think there's a sophisticated\nprocess going on\nso there's a there's first of all you\nalign behind a central goal of being\nauthentic right so once you have kind of\nlike a of a sort of abstract goal it\nkind of recruits different parts of your\nbrain to move towards it I think you\nalso have you're very careful with your\nphrasing because even the way that you\nreached out to people to lunch I think\nis something that we're sort of losing\nin the day of like emojis which is\nhey I'm gonna grab lunch would you like\nme to join me you know I'd love to chat\nlike it's it's very low pressure low\nstakes opens the door for people and I\nthink sometimes people don't\nyou know know quite how to say that so I\nthink there's actually a lot of\nsophistication\num and then the next thing is your\nattitude\nso I think you actually do some\ninteresting cognitive things about\nremoving judgment from the equation\nweird versus unusual you really kind of\nlook at things objectively and then the\nlast thing is that you actually do a\nreally good job of um\npost-processing where you reflect back\non things and you actually like really\nsolidify your wins and and it's\nfascinating because even in 15 minutes I\nmean to hear you come from where you are\nto where you are today I think there's a\nlot that people can learn about just\nlike this process it's really\ninteresting\nforeign"
