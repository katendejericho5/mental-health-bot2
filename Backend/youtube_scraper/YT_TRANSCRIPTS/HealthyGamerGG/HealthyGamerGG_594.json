    "transcript": "yeah I think it's a mistake that a lot\nof people are told like hey you're so\nclose like you have so much potential if\nyou just push yourself you'd be amazing\nand they never do I think they need to\nbe told like hey you're actually dumb as\nbricks because you're unable to execute\nyour potential yeah so you know it's\ninteresting because that that is very\neffective like so just the from a\npsychological perspective what I'm\nunderstanding is if we say that ego\nright the preservation of an identity\nthat you are smart is what short\ncircuits someone's ability to actually\ntry if you call them dog what you're\ndoing is removing ego from the equation\nand now they have free range to try it's\nactually really elegant my take is a\nlittle bit different it's unprofessional\nfor me to call people dog I think it\nwould hit really hard in the button down\nyou call someone dog and a button down\nthey're like oh my God\nI think it would hit hard yeah maybe too\nhard I'll ask people because I think a\nlot of times when everyone's like oh\nlike you could like you should live up\nto your potential you should try really\nhard no one ever asks them what do you\nwant it's not about what you should or\nshouldn't do it's like what what do you\nactually care about and then work\ntowards that"
