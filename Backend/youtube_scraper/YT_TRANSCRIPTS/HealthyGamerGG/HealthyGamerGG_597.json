    "transcript": "how are you doing it's been a minute\nyeah dude you look great do I yeah you\nlook great too you look you're glowing\nright now all right well you know\nyou wearing butt Downs uh yeah I I have\nlike 10 pieces of clothing total\nthat I wear I want to be like you I had\na face where I wanted to be like Steve\nJobs have one thing that I wear every\nday\nlike SpongeBob\nyeah it's like because you know in the\nwhole professionalism thing like I had\nto find things that were comfortable\nlike I hate getting dressed up and I\njust uh\nso I got like a certain set of shirts\nand then like a couple of suits and\nsince the pandemic I usually wear just\nlike\nt-shirts and jeans or shorts every day\nthese shirts are great\nthat's wrong I see that you have a\nTwilight t-shirt there dude I get so\nmany compliments on this shirt I bought\nit at Target when I was I had no clothes\nin Texas I I got commented on it three\ntimes today\n13 bucks did you did you interpret what\nI said as a compliment\nno\nno because I'm just telling you I\nnoticed you're in the Barclay t-shirt if\nyou're in the market for a shirt and you\nwant compliments I would get this shirt\nyou know actually speaking of things\nthat generally speaking are\nmen feel embarrassed about I watched the\n50 Shades of Gray movie recently\num\nand I I didn't watch all of it but I\nthought the part that I watched I\nthought was phenomenal\nokay wait what what part did you watch\nhere I watched like the beginning like\nthe first like 30 minutes 40 minutes\nsure\nand I was just amazed at how\num\nbeautifully bad it was it was like wow\nif you wanted to make the most extreme\nway but it really captures the essence\nof like Ridiculousness yeah but I look I\nliked watching it I I remember when I\nwatched it I watch it with an\nex-girlfriend uh and I thought at the\ntime because they were making a Trilogy\nI was like you know it's the mark of a\ngreat couple if you make it and watch\nevery single one of these in theater\nbecause you'd have to stay together for\nlike six years and you'd have to stay\naligned on liking the same [ __ ] the\nwhole time\nwell I mean you don't have to like it I\nguess huh\ntrue I guess you if you're if you drag\nyourself along and it still counts yeah\ncool so how you been man\nI've been good I've been you know living\nlife I've been\num\nenjoying life more I think recently\num\nstreaming still\nhanging out with friends and my\ngirlfriend still\nI don't know regular stuff what um so I\nmean like I didn't have anything in\nparticular I wanted to talk about today\nI think we are streaming uh we're doing\na lot of stuff around mental health\nawareness month so if there's anything\nlike some something that we've been\nasking people is like what's your\nperspective on like you know why is\nmental health so screwed up\num if I'm talking to men we'll sometimes\ntalk about male mental health too but we\ndon't necessarily have to do that that's\nbasically all I had on my plate in terms\nof like what I wanted to pick your brain\nfor sure I think you're just a really\ngreat thinker I really like watching\nlike mogulmail and just like the way\nthat you analyze things\num so I'd love to kind of get your\nperspective on that but we can also just\nlike chill and Vibe and\nyou know talk about other random things\nI'm dude I'm here to chill Vibe and talk\nabout whatever I I got a couple things\nsure well let's start here maybe let's\ndo an update sure because last time we\ntalked it was two years ago I think so\nuh and we talked a lot about death and\nyou gave me a great meditative exercise\nand I did it every day for a week and\nthen stopped okay uh but update I feel\npretty good about death now\ndid you have a problem with death\nearlier yeah yeah the I had a fear of it\nokay\nand now I don't\nand what do you think changed\nI kind of faked that I didn't have a\nproblem with it for a while and then I\ndidn't have a problem with it\nyou faked that you didn't have a problem\nwith it for a little while and then you\ndidn't have a problem so you were faking\nthat you didn't have a problem with it\nbefore we talked or after we talked\nafter we talked and what does Faking it\nlook like\nI don't know just like like accepting\nthe thoughts of it like I think maybe\nlike before I was scared of thinking\nabout the idea of it and then I was like\noh let me just think about a little bit\nand then you know like explore what that\nfeels like and then that felt a little\nbetter and then I think it made me also\num\nfocus on like little things that I like\nlike I like I like focusing on like uh\nlike since then I I've become an old man\nin some ways like the things that make\nme the most happy in my day-to-day\noutside of like personal relationships\nis like\ngetting a coffee walking and going to\nwatch the sunset\nuh and I think that that I find peace in\nthose things\nthat doesn't sound to me like you were\nFaking It\nwell I was I think I was faking it at\nthe start I guess I mean like I was\nstill\nlike scared but I was like I'm not\nscared I don't give a [ __ ] I could die\ntomorrow I don't give a [ __ ] and I would\nsay that but I don't know how true that\nwas but I think it became true\nyeah I mean I think what you're\ndescribing of of sort of awareness of\nthe fear of death\nawareness of a fear so this is what's\nreally wild is if you like look at like\nthe yogic perspective and like\nmeditation and stuff\nwhat they actually say is that you don't\nneed to fix any problems all you need is\nawareness of a problem\nso like if you're aware that you're\nyou're feeling a certain way that in and\nof itself is sufficient to conquer the\nthing\num and there's really some interesting\nscientific evidence of this that if you\nlook at like uh the science of\npsychotherapy\nthere's some evidence that language can\nactually be a substitute for action\nso even like if you took if you're in a\nsituation where you are like struggling\nbecause like let's say you've like lost\nyour job or something and you look at\nthe negative impacts within a human\nbeing so what's happening in your mind\nwhat's happening in your brain what's\nhappening in your stress system\nfixing the problem can make those things\ngo away but articulating the problem can\nalso make those things go away\ndude I learned that\nis like half of being in a relationship\nto\nI figured out I don't know if you have\nthis in your relationship and you're\nyou're you know but I so cutie would\noftentimes give me problems she was\nhaving in life and then I would always\nfind solutions to her problems and then\nshe'd be like I don't want a solution my\nproblem I just want you to listen to my\nproblem and that was her solution was\njust listening to the problem and then I\nrealized that oh I just have to stop\nthinking of solutions and trying to give\nit to her because I think it's more\noverwhelming and just listen to the\nproblem and that is a solution in it of\nitself is that the same thing\nuh yeah sure\nI mean I I think that because this is\nthis is sort of what we found\num as well is that most human beings\nif they can get in the right headspace\ncan actually like handle their problems\nthe biggest thing that keeps us from\nhandling our problems is like ourselves\nin the headspace that we're in and\noftentimes just if you kind of look at\nso when I'm feeling negative emotions\nand I talk it out with you let's say and\nthen like I feel better from talking it\nout like Cutie's like amazingly capable\ndude and so if she can just get\nif she can just get her controller\nplugged in like she can Crush whatever\ngame she's playing and so a lot of that\njust has to do with decompressing our\nown emotions and like once we do that\nthen our brain will start functioning\nproperly and then we're great\nso I think that makes a lot of sense\ncan I ask you a question sure\nI forget his first name but there's some\nI read a philosophy book\nover the past few months and it it was\nadlerian philosophy I don't know the\nguy's name Joseph Adler or something oh\nokay yeah is that his name is it Joseph\nthere is a Joseph A he there's some\nstuff in Psychiatry with Adler too but I\ndon't know that that I think that guy\nand he said something that I thought was\na little bold a little out there and I'm\ncurious your take he said like\num one all problems in life are\ninterpersonal problems\nlike blanket across the board all\nproblems are interpersonal relationship\nproblems\nand I was like that seems kind of crazy\nAlfred Adler thank you Chad and I was\nlike that seems kind of crazy that seems\nkind of bold because what if you're like\nstarving because you don't have food\nthat doesn't seem like an interpersonal\nrelationship problem\nand then the other one was like\nand I'm paraphrasing this so I could be\nwrong and if you don't know about it we\ndon't talk about it but it's like all\ntrauma is like\num\nlike I don't want to use the word fake\nbut if something like that\num it was like all trauma\num yeah past traumas don't Define our\nfuture and so he was like all trauma is\nlike it should not affect you at all\nthat was it\nand I was like that's also really bold\num\nand I was curious your thoughts on it\nyou don't know my thoughts in it well I\nthink there's a general Trend in men's\nhealth that kind of aligns with this and\nstoicism too but yeah go ahead yeah so\nhere's my take\nI think that if you want any proof that\nthose statements are false you just need\nto look at Adler himself because Force\njust think about this for a second for\nsomeone to say all problems are\ninterpersonal problems and all trauma is\nfalse what that tells me is this is\nsomeone who was who hates themselves\nfor being treated poorly interpersonally\nand can't get past it that's my take\nokay\nright so if you look at like a lot of\npsychotherapists and philosophers their\nopinions have a lot more to do with\ntheir own experience of life\nthan they do with other people\nyeah so when Freud is like oh my God\nit's all about the penis and the edible\ncomplex and we all want to have like\nthat says more about him than it does\nabout anybody else this is projecting\n101.\nokay I think there's a lot of scientific\nevidence but I there's a couple of\ncaveats okay\nso first is that\nwhen someone says all problems they may\nbe talking about a particular frame of\nmind\nso for example like if I'm a\npsychiatrist and I'm working with a lot\nof people and I say all of the problems\nthat I see are based on this\nthen you know whatever like it could be\nbecause of the people that I'm working\nwith the second thing is that I think we\nhave a pretty good evidence that\ntrauma affecting you is like\nfunctional like that's a feature it's\nnot a bug\nso like trauma so here's what I I've\ngotten really interested in trauma\nrecently and one of the big Revelations\nthat I had is that trauma is not\nactually a pathology like when we think\nabout pathology it's something that is\nfunctioning in your brain or body the\nway that it's not supposed to what's\npathology pathology is that it's it's\nwhen something is ill it's like illness\nokay pathos like bad right so trauma is\nactually like a survival or adaptive\nmechanism that is functioning the way\nthat it's supposed to\nokay but over time what used to be\nadaptive becomes maladaptive\nright so back then it doesn't work\nanymore\nbut it's not actually like something is\nbroken like we think about things that\nare broken but the more that I've\nstudied trauma like even these things\nlike dissociation and stuff like that\nthose are actually like protective\nmechanisms of the brain\nit's like keeping a Like a Prayer\ndefense spell on in RuneScape but then\nyou're no longer in battle and you're\njust wasting your prayer points\nI never played RuneScape but yeah\nabsolutely\nor or I would say I would say that you\nknow the analogy I would use is like if\num you know if a like if you're just\nlike sniping people in like an FPS\nand at low like mmrs or low ratings like\nthat strategy works like it doesn't work\nas you get better and better and better\nand that's basically what trauma is it's\nlike you learn some [ __ ] strategy when\nyou were playing it like with Noobs yeah\nand it was the only thing that worked\nand then like as you grow older like\nyelling at other people when you feel\nbad and blaming them like no longer\nworks like that works if you're in an\nenvironment where like people let you\nget away with it throwing a temper\ntantrum is a good example okay on this\nvein because this could be very helpful\nand practical to my life you've given\nadvice in the past for when people are\nin like a public violent Lobby and maybe\nthey're like crashing like uh like a\nwoman in your group and you know it's\nlike hey just back off something like\nthat and enough of that repetition maybe\nchanges their behavior how do I get my\nteammates to cooperate with me and work\nwith me in game to successfully win the\ngame so I can get points and be happier\nthat's such a great question so I am\nlow-key making a video about this but\nit's taking a long time okay so here's\nso I'll\nso glad this is this is my passion\nproject and if ever\nthis Mental Health crisis gets resolved\nthen I can make the videos that I find\ntruly fulfilling Ludwig okay right let's\nget through this mental health [ __ ]\nso we can get to the real things that\nmatter our MMR really so like we're\nwe're like developing all these like\ncommunication programs for like parents\nand children it's like\nI want to teach you how to get your\nteammates to win so I ran an experiment\nI have two accounts in Dota 2. are you\nfamiliar with this ancient game called\nyes slime loves it okay he's good friend\nso I'm old as you know older than you so\nin Dota 2\num I have two accounts and I did this\nexperiment where in one of them I\ncalibrated to my rank and I muted\neveryone else and I didn't communicate\nin the other one I communicated with my\nteam because everyone says if you want\nto raise rank like just mute everyone\nit's a multiplayer game but why the [ __ ]\nwould we want to communicate like what\nlike you know let's just mute everyone\nand then then I'm thinking to myself\nlike no dude like communication is what\nhelps you win the game it's just we\ndon't know how to communicate there's no\nlike FPS trainer for communication\nso the what I sort of found is that\nthere's an 800 MMR difference which is\nprobably like 20th percentile 20th 20\npercentile points of like rank that like\nif you communicate it's gigantic\num and and so basically like I I want to\nmake a video about how to successfully\ncommunicate so there are a couple things\nthat I do the first mistake that people\nmake is that they tell their teammates\nwhat to do\ndon't ever tell your teammates what to\ndo ask them questions so I don't know if\nyou've ever played DOTA but maybe this\nworks with LOL or whatever but like so\none thing that I'll do at the very\nbeginning of the game is I'll ask people\nwhich hero they want me to pick I'm like\nhey I can play these three things\nwhich one should I pick what do you\nthink people say what do you think the\nresponse is when I ask that question\nlike lock whoever you're most\ncomfortable with 90 of people don't say\na [ __ ] word oh just completely ignore\nit\nbut and so people assume that now I've\nmade a mistake but no I haven't made a\nmistake because I've already signaled to\nthem because they're just [ __ ]\nconfused who the hell does that right\nyeah that would be a bit weird it would\nand so people are like\nthis person is asking for my opinion to\ntry to make my game better like what on\nEarth\nall right so but it's lays a foundation\nfor communication and then what I'll do\nis like if someone is like you know if I\nthink someone is making a mistake I'll\nask them a question about it\nso if if one of my teammates is like\ndoing something I'm like hey I noticed\nyou're doing this you keep on going back\nto the Lane and you keep dying so\ninstead of telling them hey stop [ __ ]\ngoing back to the same place and feeding\nyou can say hey I noticed that you've\nbeen ganked twice sorry for not having\nWards in the right spot\ndo you want me to like Place Wards or\ncan you wait 60 seconds that I can place\nwords or do you want to move to a\ndifferent part of the map hey I noticed\nyour bottom on the [ __ ] leaderboard\nhow about you leave me alone I feel it\nwould be the reply nope that's if you\ntell them to do something okay but if\nyou ask them hey I noticed that you're\ngetting ganked my bad I'm not doing my\njob because you don't see the gank\ncoming\ndo you want me to Ward so you can keep\non doing your stupid [ __ ] thing or do\nyou want to go to a different part of\nthe map\nand then you know what they do 90 of the\ntime they go to the different part of\nthe map\nyeah\nit's crazy\nare you swallowing like\nlike certain things like are you just\neating it like for example if somebody\ninsta locks\nare you just like are you just like hey\nman like are you sure you should have\ninterlocked are you just eating that\nbecause like that might\nbecause that's what pisses me off yeah\nso so let's talk about this Ludwig\nwhat's the purpose of communication\nit's to it's to tell them when they're\nbeing [ __ ] idiots for one and for two\nto collaboratively work towards our\nCollective goal which is gaining MMR\nOkay so\nlet's think about that okay so if the\npurpose of communication yeah so let's\nsee I I understand you're in a\nrelationship with someone right that's\nright\nto be clear I was thinking about\nrelationship communication the first\npart I just asked about communication\nyeah I thought we were in the context of\nthat's the problem dude is that there\nisn't a different context whether you're\nplaying a video game or in a\nrelationship\nevery time you play in a video game you\nare in a polyamorous relationship with\nall of your teammates\nyeah but they're [ __ ] me over and\nthey got they got no game they got no\ndick and and I I boot up because I I\nplay in the slums of valoran I play on\nWest Coast servers which are the most\nvicious I play at 11 to 1am which is\nwhere everybody is high as [ __ ] and or\nnot talking because it's like late and\ntheir parents are in the same room with\nthem and I usually get two sometimes\nthree insta-lock Duelists a role there\nshould be one maybe two of and and I've\ndeveloped a very toxic strategy I'll\ncome fully clean here I also don't talk\nbecause if I talk they usually don't\nreply I also insta lock a duelist\nand I and I said I say you know what if\nwe're if you if you want to [ __ ] us I\nwill [ __ ] us all too I will I will drown\nthis ship my MMR doesn't matter I don't\ncare I'll do this for fun and I'll throw\na video on the side and this is a\nvicious mindset I have it's a vicious\nmindset what do you am I maybe being too\nnegative in my polyamorous relationships\nwhat do you think\nthe ship should drown we should all die\ntogether okay so you know this this is a\ntrauma response\nwhat's my trauma\nplaying with these dumb asses so you\nwant to know why people are seriously\nyou wanna know why people have been\ntraumatized kill themselves this is why\nyou look because valorate lobbies no\nbecause this this person triggers your\ntrauma and you're like [ __ ] it let the\nship Burn yeah let it burn right you\nknow like literally like I'm not kidding\nhere like like they're people who have\nbeen hurt so much in life and when\nsomeone triggers that hurt again they're\nlike I'm just gonna like if they Wanna\n[ __ ] it let me [ __ ] it\nyeah I've seen this a lot in addictions\ntoo where it's like someone's trying to\nbe sober right and they're like family\nmembers or friends are like hey are you\nsure you're not drinking are you sure\nyou're not drinking like and they like\npunish him for it right because like\nI've had an addiction in the past and\nthey're like and they're like well if\nthese people are gonna treat me like an\naddict I might as well [ __ ] use\nbecause I'm getting burnished for it\nanyway\nyou know why did I leave my last job oh\nI like I had a substance use problem\nand then like if they're gonna treat me\nlike it like so the human being the\nhuman beings we have a desire where when\nsomeone else kind of like triggers us\nor take something that we want\nright like and takes it away from us\nthen we just want to say screw it and\nthat's adaptive too because think about\nwhat hurts more when something someone\ntakes something away from you that you\nwant or when you gain some control of it\nit's a trauma response I'm gonna control\nthis thing a tiny amount and and I'm not\ngoing to be the victim here\nI'm gonna be the [ __ ] Predator I\ndon't want to get owned\nso hard that I I'm instead tanking\neverything\nthe only person doing the owning here\n[ __ ] is me that's what you're doing and\nI'll own myself but I'm gonna be in\ncontrol you guys are not gonna owe me by\ntriple locking duelist I'm gonna own\nmyself idiots by locking your room you\nthink you can own me I will show you and\nI will thank all of our MMR I do that I\ndo do that\nI okay I well I I have an issue\nwhere I think I have a difference in how\nI view online game people versus\nwhat I'm going to say real people\nand they're real people that I'm playing\nwith obviously but it is a lot harder to\nlike connect with them as humans to\nstart communicating as opposed to like\nlike a barista my local coffee shop who\nI'm down to commiserate with or chat\nwith or you know like connect with as\nhumans like these these people\nI don't view as real how do I view them\nas real is there a sentence I can say to\ndisarm them and disarm myself maybe\nyou know it's interesting I've never\nthought about that quite in this way but\nis there one sentence if you're looking\nfor one sentence I would say hi my name\nis what are y'all's names\nokay\nso if you want to humanize people\nintroduce yourself like so if we think\nabout it what triggers\nthis humanization of other people it's\nlike social norms like you can't shake\ntheir hand but you introduce yourself\nright hi my name is like whatever\nwhat are y'all what do you all go by\nokay\nand I\nI mean if if you want one sentence I'm\nnot saying it's going to fix the problem\nbut it's probably one sentence\nand if someone says this sentence if\nsomeone says like hey\nLudwig my name is Jake\nand then you know instead of like\nyou know sniper tits or whatever their\ntheir handle is like\nyou can you know you're like Jake bro\nyou need me to word on bottom or you\nwant to move like tell me tell me what\nwhat do you need\nso it's like hey sniper tips my name's\nLudwig I can play like a phenomenal\nraise or a very you know uh lockdown\nkilljoy like do you have a preference\nyeah\nand so it shows like consideration right\nand like if you want to engage the right\nbehavior in other people so let me put\nit this way when one person locks do a\nlist what do they make you do\nthey make me lock another role so people\nare gonna if I walk up to you and I slap\nyou across the face what are you gonna\ndo\nI'm gonna I'm gonna say\noh yeah\noh yeah oh [ __ ] me you're in some\ntrouble now right and you're gonna\nyou're gonna beat the [ __ ] out of me if\nI walk up to you tonight hi Ludwig my\nname is alok and I hold out my hand and\nwe shake it so you can set the tone of\ncommunication\nand all it takes is when they do one\ntoxic thing\nand you can respond to that toxic thing\nwith compassion you'll flip it around\nand I've seen it's hard so I've seen\nthis like especially with like kids who\ngrew up in abusive relation abusive\nhouseholds like in school\nso if you're like a kid who's like\nacting out what you usually do is you\nget punished\nbut all those kids need is like one\nperson to like tolerate their negative\nbehavior and like care about them and\nthey'll like transformed that is like a\nTrope right like anytime there's like an\n[ __ ] like bully in a show or movie\nthey always have an abusive household\nyeah so I mean that that I mean that's\nstatistically accurate that's just\nconsistent across the board that's just\nlike yeah I mean I I'm not saying it\nhappens every single time right right\none of the highest uh so I\num there's a really interesting\nyou know if you look at like kids who\nare bullies like kids who are bullies\nare oftentimes\nabused\nin some way so like there's just yes the\nmost the most common\ncause if you look at variables\nassociated with being abusive as a child\nabusive as a child is being abused\nand it's monkey see monkey do right it's\nall about reciprocity so whatever other\npeople do if they lock dualist I'm going\nto lock dualist\nif I get beat up at home reciprocation\nyeah okay yeah I was working through\nthat word\nokay these are great questions I'm I'm\nnever I've never quite connected the\nneurons in this way in terms of how\nsimilar\npsychiatric principles are in gaming\nthese are are you are you on tick tock\nlike do we have a tick tock account or\ndo I use stick talk do you use tick tock\nno\ndo you watch anime yes you used to\nokay so you haven't seen like Finland\nSaga season two no\nthere's a big trend on Tick Tock in Pulp\nculture and pop culture and amongst I\nwould say like General like like male\nyouth of stoicism\nthat I think is specifically stemmed\nfrom\none Finland Saga two and then also Tick\nTock as a whole\nuh and it's just generally like a\nmindset of like you know nothing can\ndisturb me it makes me stronger\net cetera et cetera et cetera I'm\ncurious just your general thoughts on\nlike that stoicism its effect on youth\nbecause I I think it could the the big\nphrase like I have no enemies I think\nthese are all like valid things but I\nfeel like I don't know how applicable it\nis and how useful it is to you know uh\n16 17 year olds so just generally\ncurious your thoughts\ncan I ask a couple questions about that\nbefore yeah please so can you tell me\nabout Finland Saga season two spoilers\nwithout spoiling too much it's just\ngenerally a uh much more\num\nmental uh season of anime where the\nfirst season was like very War heavy\nit's like like this is historical Wars\nand you're viewing it through the lens\nof a few characters and then one of the\ncharacters in the second season like\ndeals with the trauma of that basically\nof of having been in war and and how to\ndeal with that that is that is like the\nbroad talking points without really\nspoiling much and in dealing with that\nkind of turns to like a general stoicism\nmindset where it's like uh the big\ncatchphrase is like I have no enemies\nyou know no nobody deserves death like\nany pain I've inflicted was not deserved\nby anyone regardless of you know whether\nthey're rivaling tribe Clan whatever uh\nI think is like kind of the the gist of\nit okay thank you very much for\nexplaining that can you tell me you\nmentioned like 16 and 17 year olds in\nTick Tock so can you tell me a little\nbit about what that has to do with\nstoicism yeah so there'll be super super\npopular like multi-million view tick\ntocks and it'll be like a nujabes Orion\ndance song and then it'll be like a\nslideshow and then or like a voiceover\nand it'll and it'll just be like\nprofound stoicism quotes you know of\nlike like I have no enemies and it's\nlike built upon like you know\num uh\ndealing and taking in anything that\ncould impact you and like using it as a\nlearning lesson for the future and not\nletting it affect you as a person kind\nof\num is and it's it's usually like a\nhashtag hope core hashtag stoicism\nhashtag uh\nuh you know been in Saga and that's\nthat's generally like what I what I'm\nseeing a lot of\num and it's like I think the most I've\never seen for a movement of like men's\nmental health like it's not like outside\nof maybe like the more corny ways it's\nbeen done which I think is like fair to\nsay like sometimes a bit corny it's a\nbit like on the nose like this is a very\nlike built-in movement of like you know\nmental health and like dealing with\nthings uh but yeah curious if you what\nyou think about it\ncan I ask a couple more questions sure\nand and let me know I mean if you want\nme to I how would you what do you mean\nby stoicism\nI think it's built upon like not having\nany emotion uh and in a lot of these uh\nuh tick tocks and it's like nothing\naffects you uh but I I don't know how\ndeep it actually dives into it look I'm\na few chapters into Marcus aurelius's\nmeditations but I'm not I'm no expert on\nit this is just like what it what it is\nhashtag with I would not call this\nnecessarily A a new chapter in Beacon of\nstoicism it's just referenced a lot and\nit's the main takeaway is that there's\nno emotion at all okay nothing can\nemotionally affect you what do you think\nabout it\nwhat do I think about it sounds like you\nhave a opinion\nI think a worry that\nit is too\num\nthat it perpetuates it like like a lot\nof like old-fashioned stuff of like you\nknow manly man tough guy take everything\non the chin like nothing affects you\nuh which is like roundabout like I think\ngoes back to like you know before there\nwas a lot of conversations about men's\nmental health where it's like you know\nbottle it up deal with it uh and it can\nit can be a bit cold although I think\nalso like valuable in a lot of ways too\nand like I I'm I think they're\ninteresting like I think stoicism is\nreally interesting\num\nI yeah I I worry about that aspect of it\nthe cold aspect\nwould you describe yourself as stoic\nI don't know\nokay what that means so here here's my\ntake so I think stoicism is something\nthat is very easy to misinterpret\nso what I'm hearing on Tick Tock is a\nlonging for numbness\nso do not let things affect you I am\ngoing to be impervious to be affected by\nthings that's not what stoicism is\nit's not numbness and this is the\nbiggest problem\nwhat stoicism is is not being affected\nby things that affect you it's kind of\nweird\nthings still affect you but you don't\nlet the things that affect you\ncontrol your life it's not that you're\nnumb\nit's does that kind of make sense so\nlike in the this is there's a principle\nin Buddhism called the two arrows and\nand this principle is that anytime life\nshoots an arrow at us and we get hit by\nan arrow that hurts\nand then what we do is shoot a second\nArrow at ourselves for being hit by the\nfirst one\nthey locked do a list so I'm gonna lock\ndo a list two hmm stoicism is preventing\nthat second Arrow it's not that things\ndon't hurt\nMarcus Aurelius felt a full range of\nemotions\nhe was just tranquil in the face of\nthose emotions\nso Tranquility is not about being numb\nit's about\nstaying grounded when there are emotions\nin front of you and feeling those things\nhonestly kind of to the fullest and when\nyou feel them to the fullest they lose\ntheir power over you and stoicism is\nabout not being reactive to the things\nthat happen around you it's not being\nand this is the tricky thing this is why\npeople screw it up because they think\nthat okay how can I avoid reaction to it\nI can be numb to it I can avoid it but\nthen you start creating a life of\navoidance and numbness which is the very\nopposite of stoicism and people who\nstart creating those lives are not\ntranquil in the face of Life they're\nactually they don't gain control which\nis what stoicism has you do they\nactually do the exact opposite now that\nI'm numbness is my tool and avoidance is\nmy tactic I can't go out into the world\nbecause the I have to avoid things so\nnow I can't go out the way that I'm\nsupposed to if I'm a true stoic a stoic\ncan walk through Lava so it can you know\nface give a big speech in front of 600\npeople and the reason they're able to do\nthat is because they're not controlled\nby those things but instead we see the\nreverse which is like now I feel\nsocially anxious and I need to be stoic\nI'm doing this wrong and I'm going to\nretreat from it\nthat's my take\nhow do you walk the line because it\nfeels like a thin line kind of like from\nbeing like like very of avoid a\nVisionary and being tranquil and stoic\nlike how do you it's not a it's not a\nthin line it's opposite ends of the\nspectrum actually you don't find that\nthey're similar at all\nthey seem similar and this is why people\nget it wrong but actually it's opposite\nends of the spectrum so Tranquility with\nemotion doesn't come through avoiding it\nit comes from feeling it fully hmm so\ndon't push the tears away let them come\nit's the exact opposite direction and\njust like you were talking about with\nyour relationship right like when you\nlet those emotions out you're fine\nyou're chill you've become tranquil\nI'm not hearing that\nso your enjoyment of the sunset or your\nenjoyment of the coffee does not come\nfrom the avoidance of other things in\nlife it comes from the exact opposite\nyeah an awareness of death an acceptance\nof death is what leads to Tranquility\nnot the avoidance of it that's stoic my\ndude\nokay\nyeah I can see that I can see also how\nyou'd get it confused\nyep it's very easy to confuse like like\nnot nightmare but a ton of because they\nthink that okay like how do I how in my\nlife when have I achieved Tranquility I\nhave achieved Tranquility when the\ncircumstance is allowed for it so I'm\ngoing to chase that thing right\nso if we're being stoic in the valorant\nsituation\nwhat does that look like versus being a\nvordinary generally\nso what being a stoic means is not\nreacting not letting your emotions\ncontrol you so pre-interlock Duelists\nhow am I being stoic\nhow do you how does that make you feel\neat [ __ ] and die I would say to all\nthree of them in my head internally\nbut\nif I were to react maybe stoically maybe\nthat is in line with also acting\ncompassionately\nhey guys um my name is Ludwig we have\nthree interlock dualists how how can I\nhelp turn this ship right\nokay so let's teach things you're in the\nright direction but you're actually\nadding additional things you're jumping\nahead so compassion is a little bit\ndifferent so what is stoicism stoicism\nis not being controlled by your internal\nemotions or reactions So when you say\neat [ __ ] and die what do you want to do\nuh you wanted to lock duelist right yes\nokay yeah so so whatever you re whatever\nyour reaction is telling you to do not\ndoing that is stoicism taking a step\nback from that acknowledging hey I want\nto lock duelist compassion is completely\nseparate so just not you can still lock\ndoulas I'll give you like you want to\nknow how to win that game with three\ninstant log duels you can even win that\ngame by locking duelist the way you do\nit is Bros what is going on here three\ninsta lock Duelists do you all want me\nto try to salvage this or should I\ninsta-lock dualist and are we gonna have\nthe most epic victory of a team of full\nDuelists I've done that a few times it's\nworked once it was amazing when it\nworked the other times horrible horrible\nand you can even say that 99 chance we\nlose but\nif we win it's gonna be epic what should\nwe do do we go for Glory\nor do we try to salvage what is a\ncolossally bad start to a draft yeah\nand even that attitude that's stoicism\nlife can send you whatever the [ __ ] it\nwants but like I ain't gonna let it\ncontrol me you can even lock duelist\nbut whether you lock to a list or not\nlock dualist can both of the one of\nthose can be stoic and one cannot be\nstoic are you behaving reactionally or\nare you acknowledging your emotions\nsetting an intention and then moving\ntowards it\nokay that's a cool phrase setting an\nintention and moving towards it\nbecause when we react\nwe're not citing an intention we're not\ndoing anything intentionally it's\nreactionary\nokay\nI feel better about this\nfor what it's worth I'm sorry that you\nhave so many people who are\ninsta-locking Duelists dude that sounds\n11 pm to 1am it's just the hell time\nit's the hell time it's how it works I\nplay at 3 P.M or I play on Midwest\nservers there's sweet peas over there\nthey're just they're they're sweeties\nbut West Coast servers different breed\nwhy do you queue on West Coast servers\nfrom 11 pm to 1am\nlower ping and I'm electric with my\nraise so might as well use the lower\nping to just carry with my indomitable\ngameplay\nwhat is electric with your raise mean\nI'm it means that I I don't miss it\nmeans that I tap heads I have magnets in\nmy bullets and they have like giant\ngiant metal in their heads\nand that time frame is because that's\nthe only time I have free to play okay\nand and what's the Ping differential\nbetween West Coast and Midwest\nit's like 30 versus like maybe 50 55 60.\nyou know and that your level of skill\nthat 20 ping difference is oh I mean\nwe're talking about dropping like 40\nkills versus like 15 like with that ping\nI mean Dr K I'm like very good very good\nyeah people I I I'm I'm on a pro team\nreally\nI'm the owner of one\nokay so you know on the team still still\non the team\num so you know if like five of them get\ninjured I'd probably have to play what's\nit like owning a valorant team\nstressful but fun I think we're in a\nit's it is the easiest it's ever been\nit's easy when you're winning\nand we're winning\nit'd be harder if we were losing\ncongratulations I appreciate it I can't\ntake too much credit but the guys are\ndoing great and that feels good\nand um what uh\nwhat do you think is responsible for\nthem winning\nI think on the team obviously yeah one\nis definitely my direction in terms of\njust them watching my gameplay and\nlearning from it but the other is uh\nthey have been one unit for the entirety\nof the stretch so there's been no\nchanges which is pretty rare like most\nteams have had at least one shift uh or\nat least a lot of teams have so they've\nthey've been able to to grow together\nand then I think there's a general\ncohesiveness in goal like everyone is\naligned on what the goal is you know\nthere's been some players who have had\nopportunities to go elsewhere but like\nthey've felt really solid about this\nteam and uh I think the biggest thing is\ntrust there's a lot of trust which I\nthink is super necessary\num because it's like trust in your\nability to play uh at the highest level\ntrusting your teammates to do what they\nneed to do and Trust in the game plan\nthat you have going in and Trust in your\nability to win as a whole so I think\nit's all trust\nwow how is that trust built\num\nI think it's through like\ntrust that everyone around you is\nworking as hard as you are working\nprobably like I think if you felt like\npeople around you weren't working as\nhard as you you would maybe lose trust\nin them or you may you might lose trust\nin yourself and that could be built on a\nnumber reason that could that could be\nas simple as like results oriented uh\nbuilt trust which can be pretty toxic\nyou know like if you play poorly maybe\nyou lose trust in yourself or your\nability to aim and that might need to be\nbuilt up but\num I I think because\nat like there's been like a snowball\neffect of winds the trust is only Built\nbecause everything has worked so far\nawesome dude that sounds great how do\nyou Foster that that climate of trust or\nnot being results oriented\nI don't I don't I don't\num\nnecessarily take too much credit but I I\nhave a philosophy that I try to infect\neverybody I know with that everything\nwill all work out\nuh and you can you can have confidence\nit'll all work out no matter what the\nresult is and it'll all be good and that\nthis experience whether it is a defiant\nwin and we become the best Valor team in\nthe world or whether we you know don't\nperform up to our expectations it'll all\nhave been good and worthwhile and a\ngreat part of your life\nand I think that's like the message I\ntry to get to them\nhow long have you had that philosophy\nabout life\nI think since I was like a kid I think I\ngot that from like uh my mom and dad\nthey they they had that my dad had like\na it'll all work out mentality so I just\nkind of rocked with that for a while\nthat's great man\nI think it's true\nbecause it kind of has to there's no\nother alternative it can't not work out\nwhat do you mean by that well it has to\nwork out the the Earth keeps spinning\nyou don't get to reverse any decisions\nso everything has to work out and maybe\nit won't work out in the way that you\nexpected it but it will work in some\nfashion and then you will have to work\nwith what like spot you are in and so\nlike you will you will make it work it\nlike it will work\num it's like eventually like you'll get\nthrough any tumultuous time any period\nor you don't get through it you die and\nthen that's also okay\nyeah I'm kind of curious about when you\nsay it it'll work what how do you how\nare you able to say that can you tell us\na little bit about that\ntell me I I think like\num\nlike\nI when I say work out I guess it doesn't\nnecessarily mean like hey we will\nachieve all our goals and we will be you\nknow we will we will be Kings it's like\num\nlike a good example is like I I like I\nlike writing goals every year I like\nwriting them down specifically and uh\nI'm not like really big into that\num hippie [ __ ] and like you know\nspeaking into the universe but I do like\nwriting [ __ ] down and I think that's\nreal and uh so every year I write a goal\ndown and one of my first years doing\nthis was when I wanted to become a\nfull-time streamer and so like I wrote\nmy goals down I gave myself a timeline\nto achieve those goals and if it didn't\nwork out if I didn't hit those goals I\nwould quit forever that was like a like\na definite rule that I gave myself\nbut either path I was happy with like\neither one I succeeded being a streamer\ncool POG or two I failed at it but that\nalso worked out because now I know that\nhey I it didn't work out I couldn't be a\nstreamer but I don't and I can close\nthat chapter of the book like I don't\nfeel any regret I tried it I set goals I\nworked really hard towards it I did the\nbest I could and it worked out in that I\nknow that's not what I'm gonna do now I\ncan do something else\nso I can like figure something else out\nhow is it that you don't feel regret\nwhen your goals don't work out\nbecause I cried I think trying and\nfailing is really cool\nwhat do you mean by that\nthere's this anime called Silver Spoon\nand in it there's this guy he's a\nbaseball player he's phenomenal and he\nplays in high school baseball and he\nwants to go he wants to go to college he\nwants to go pro\nuh the rest of his teammates are dog\n[ __ ] but he he does not care he's he is\ndefiant in that fact and he uplifts\neverybody around him and there's this\nepisode where there's like this major\ngame championship game and he's like\nthis is it this is to make it out this\nis like to become a Collegiate player\nand uh in the last second one of his\nteammate just drops the ball they just\nyou know it was a bad pitch the other\nteam gets a home run he loses and if he\nloses there's two options one he lives\nthe life of a farmer if he loses joins\nhis family business if he wins he goes\non to be a pro baseball player and it's\nlike these two paths and the moment he\nloses everybody is like Shell Shocked\naround him they're like oh my God no I\ncannot believe this happened to you and\nthen he's just like smile on his face\nand he's like it's okay like we tried\nand we failed and that's beautiful and I\nwill be happy as a farmer and I thought\nthat was dope\nyeah I mean I I think it's dope too I I\nagree with everything that you've said I\nthink it's really interesting how\nI'm so curious how you learned these\nthings because I had to be taught very\nexplicitly\nbut\nanime\nyeah that was for that one it was anime\num yeah I don't know I think it also\nstems\nuh I don't know I don't know I think\nit's I think like um\ngrowing up also there's like I think\nwhen you're younger and I think it's\nfaded off maybe a bit or maybe I'm just\nold and so I don't see it as much but it\nwas kind of cool to not try and then\nalso simultaneously maybe be good at\nthings but like if you weren't good at\nthings don't try those things and I\nthink that's lame and I always thought\nit was cool to try really hard you know\nand it always bugged me when people\nwould say like you're trying too hard\nand I was like what's wrong with that\nyou should try hard and so I I I've\nalways like been stubborn about that but\nI don't know where that's from\nyeah I mean I think I was in the\nopposite Camp so I was a kid who was\ntold that I was smart\nand so anytime I did something\nI could not try my hardest\nbecause if I tried my hardest and I\nwasn't the best that means I'm no longer\nsmart\nso I would actually self-sabotage all\nthe time for the preservation of my ego\nwell I think I did that too actually in\nschool because I was always told I was\nsmart and overachiever and then but I\ndidn't do any of my homework and then I\nwould like still pull out like a b b\nplus a minus on tests\nand then the teachers would always give\nthe review to my mom they'd be like he\ndoesn't do any of his homework and if\nyou were just able to you know push\nhimself to his full potential then he\nwould definitely be one of our best\nstudents but I think that made me feel\ngood enough I was like I'm not even\ntrying and I'm already this good I like\nand so I would just never do my homework\nfor all High School\nyeah I mean I in my case it was if I do\nmy homework and I'm if I live up to my\nfull potential and it's uh a minus that\nwould be devastating yeah and that\nbecomes a vicious cycle because the more\nso the less you try\nthe more one-dimensional my personality\nbecame so I could only do the things\nthat I could achieve with effortless\nsuccess\nand then I had to start retreating from\nanything that required effort which\nmeans that like my future was like\nshrinking I didn't play any sports I\ncouldn't learn any skills I couldn't\nlearn anything because that meant I\nwasn't smart and then the pair the\nproblem is the more one-dimensional my\npersonality becomes the more I have to\npreserve it so the fewer things I can\ntry because now all I am is a smart kid\nbecause I'm not a good chess player I'm\nnot a good athlete I'm not a good\nanything\nso now I can't even study\nI I always tell people in my chat that\nbecause a lot of people are in this boat\na lot of people are told like hey you\nExcel really well at math if you just\npush yourself or you know try it a\nlittle harder you would be our best\nstudent or reading or writing or soccer\nor whatever it is and I I uh maybe a\nlittle too aggressively but I always say\nlike hey you're not good you're actually\ndog [ __ ] and the person who's good is a\nperson who's like trying their best to\nlike get a good grade and studying super\nhard it has to work incredibly hard for\nan a where you don't even have to try\nand you get a B plus like they are\nbetter than you because they are trying\nreally hard and like I think that's a\nlesson I didn't learn until College uh\nand it's because the stakes were higher\nbecause like if I didn't perform at a\nhigh level then I just lost my\nscholarship and then that would feel bad\nbecause then that was more of a burden\nfor like you know debt college debt all\nthat so that that was what finally\npushed me over the edge uh was college\nand that but I think it's yeah I think\nit's a mistake that a lot of people are\ntold like a lot of people can relate to\nbeing told like hey you're so close like\ngive so much potential if you just push\nyourself you'd be amazing and they never\ndo and um I think they need to be told\nlike hey you're actually dumb as bricks\nbecause you're unable to execute your\npotential yeah so you know it's\ninteresting because that that is\nvery effective like so just the from a\npsychological perspective what I'm\nunderstanding is if we say that ego\nright the preservation of an identity\nthat you are smart\nis what\nshort circuits someone's ability to\nactually try if you call them dog [ __ ]\nwhat you're doing is removing ego from\nthe equation and now they have free\nrange to try so it's actually really\nelegant\nmy take is a little bit different\nbecause generally speaking I don't you\nknow I think it's professionally it's\nunprofessional for me to call people dog\n[ __ ] I think it would hit really hard in\nthe button down\nyou call someone dog [ __ ] a button\ndown they're like oh my God I think it\nwould hit hard\nyeah maybe too hard right so what I tend\nto find is also works really well maybe\nnot quite as a not as quite quick and\neffective is what you say is I'll ask\npeople because I think a lot of times\nwhen everyone's like oh like you could\nlike you should live up to your\npotential you should try really hard no\none ever asks them what do you want\num\nlike what do you want do you want to be\ngood at math do you want to go to a good\ncollege do you want to do like what do\nyou want from your life it's not about\nwhat you should or shouldn't do it's\nlike what what do you actually care\nabout and then work towards that\nright and I see this a lot with like you\nknow when I I review like personal\nstatements for kids applying to med\nschool they'll be like I want to be a\ndoctor because I want to you know help\npeople it's like why the [ __ ] are you\ngoing to med school you can go work in a\nsoup kitchen tomorrow you can help\npeople right what do you why do you\nreally want to go and if it's ego then\nlike we got to know right if you want to\nlike be someone and you want to be like\nlike when you book a flight and it's\nlike are you Mr Miss Mrs or doctor and\nthat's why you're doing it be honest\nwith yourself\nmm-hmm\nand I think a lot of times just\nunderstanding what we want instead of\ntrying to live up to expectations can\nreally bring out the best in our efforts\nbecause it's something that I want I'm\nnot doing it to make someone else happy\nor impress people it's for me\nyeah\nyeah that makes sense I think being\nhonest with your desires is cool\nI've gotten into learning now at this\nstage of my life which is funny because\nI was not into it in high school treated\nfor a degree in college\na little bit I had two degrees so one of\nthem was legal uh and and now only now\nI'm like actually into learning I think\nit's like it's it's fun it's like\nenjoyable\nwhat are you learning about\nI like language geography history\nuh\num and those are those are the big ones\nI like and baking\nI want to become a baking is hard bro I\nknow and this has created a bit of\ntension in my relationship I'll be\nhonest\nbecause I've told cutie I have a dream\nof becoming a baker when I retire which\nis also her dream but it's but it's but\nit's different because she's she's an\namazing Baker already\nbest baker I know but she does like\nconfection confection confectionaries\nshe does like little sweet treats I just\nwant to make bread bread is my favorite\nfood\nin all bread I've had in America is\npretty dog [ __ ] and I would just love to\njust whip out you know 100 baguettes a\nday and that be my life where is the\nbest bread that you've had\nFrance\nthere's a really good spot in La that\ndoes french bread that's pretty good too\nthough\nI'd say best baked goods I've had is\nactually Japan\nfor me\nthey love white bread like white soft\nfluffy bread and I like the hard crust\nthat kind of crunch in and it's like\nsteamy on the inside of a bunch of\npockets which is much less popular there\nlike I think it's much more like very\nsoft like like gooey bread which can\nalso like have its Mark but I like I\nlike the bread that makes your mouth\nbleed a bit\nI know what you mean like cuts it up on\nthe inside oh yeah it's good stuff I\nlove me some good bread too one of my\nkids is just loves bread as well it's\nRed's great it's my favorite food if I\ncould eat one food the rest of my life\nit'd be bread\nyou know it's interesting a lot of\npeople have like gluten sensitivity\nnowadays yeah and there's actually a guy\num in Austin who uses an old strain of\nwheat\nso uses a strain of wheat that's like\n800 years old and people who eat his\nbread\ndon't have like gluten related problems\nbecause the the chemical composition of\nthe gluten protein is like less\ninflammatory it's really fascinating\nlike that starch that old starter is\njust yeah just whatever whatever the\nyeah there's like some old I don't know\nif it's the starter or it's the actual I\nthink it's the wheat oh it's actual yeah\nfarming oh wow yeah yeah the gluten is\nbut I actually do Wonder now I've never\nthought about I'd assumed it was the the\nwheat itself but I wonder if he actually\nhas an old starter in the way that the\nthe yeast metabolizes the gluten also\nchanges inflammatory properties that's\nfascinating\nyeah like some 800 year old starter yeah\nstarter's crazy\nlike just to keep that alive for so long\nseems stressful it's like a plant\nyeah I mean it's\ndo you\nyeah we we do that with yogurt where\nwe'll have like uh\nyou know like my mom get a good batch of\nyogurt like you want to preserve it\nbecause then all of the yogurt that you\nmake from it stays good I was talking\nabout this literally yesterday because\nmy mom kept a yogurt alive for a decade\nhated eating it right like it towards\nthe end she was like she like there was\ntoo much yogurt to eat so she would like\nhave to force eat yogurt because there's\nmore than she would actually want to\nconsume but she kept that like yogurt\nbase alive for a decade and she would\nhate like if she ever got rid of it\nbecause if you ever lose your yogurt\nlike it's gone forever yeah and she got\nit from this like dude who came by one\ntime and he was like you want some of my\nyogurt base or I don't know what you\ncall it uh the starter is it just is it\nprobiotics it's just anyway he's like\nyou want some of my yogurt I think yeah\nyeah you want someone at yoga culture\nand she's like sure and she kept it\nalive forever so my family I think we\nhave a really good one that kind of gets\npassed through and like circles back\naround so like someone will screw it up\nbut then we'll like you know when you\nwhen you get a good batch you'll like\ngive it to other people yeah\nas long as someone's horcrux is still\naround you the yogurt keeps running yeah\nit was great it was delicious yogurt\nyeah it's good stuff\num yeah I struggle to keep even plants\nalive now\nuh but you have your your starter that\nyou keep no I haven't I haven't got into\nthe baking yet okay I'm merely a student\nnow I've not gotten there yet QD is\ngoing to teach me to to bake my first\nfew loaves in the coming weeks\nand what are you going to bake\nI want to make bread but let's kind of\nlike I am a student whatever she teaches\nme baguette is my ideal goal but I think\nit requires like I don't know if my\noven's really good for it so you know\nI'm I am The Apprentice I am just here\nto learn\nand learning's hard when you're old\nyeah certainly you disagree\num I think it's a sort of a mixed uh\nit's sort of a mixed bag so I think the\nabsorption ability of your brain you\ndon't pick things up\nas fast as when you're a kid\nbut I think that you're\nyour ability to stay on task and\ndiscipline your frontal lobes are more\ndeveloped so I think it's kind of uh\nit's like some things are better and\nsome things are worse\nI think it's just more embarrassing\nthat's my issue\nlike learning is embarrassing when\nyou're an adult and it's not\nembarrassing when you're a kid because\nyou're supposed to be a dumbass kid who\ndoesn't know anything\nso learning is fine but like for example\nI've been trying to get really good at\nshooting three point shots in basketball\nand I am mid I go two for ten you know\nit's not a good day\nI mean it's good if you're like on the\nbench on a JV team\nand uh and so I want to get better and\nit like part of it requires\nuh like like I think vulnerability\nyou know and if I was a kid and I was at\na basketball court and I was shooting\nthrees like I would just be shooting\nthem like nobody's business but like the\nother day I was shooting threes\ninstantly the park gets packed like out\nof nowhere just like two five on fives\nfor him and they're all like shooting\naround and I can see them looking at me\nas I'm shooting and I bro I am it's only\nair balls it is only nothing's even\nhitting the backboard for me I'm just\nheaving them up there and I can I see\npeople look at me and it's a bit of a\nspotlight effect because I they probably\ndon't actually give a [ __ ] but it's very\nhard to just like eat you know 15 people\nwho play basketball regularly watching\nme just with [ __ ] air balls and then\nget back to the line and shoot it again\nbut but I forced myself to stay there\nbut it was much more embarrassing and I\nthink if I was a kid I wouldn't give a\n[ __ ] yeah you know it's actually\ninteresting because that's that's like\nit's fascinating how cognitive\ndevelopment works because we develop ego\nwhen we're basically done learning\nso if you think about a child right so a\nchild like the way that a child learns\nlanguages one of the reasons they learn\nlanguages really quickly is because\nthey're not capable of embarrassment\nso they just babble\nand they learn really fast\nand so the I do think that there's\nthere's it's really I mean there's a lot\nof interesting stuff around\nembarrassment and learning and how the\ntwo the development of the ego makes us\nfeel embarrassed and makes us stop\nlearning because actually what happens\nis it when we become teenagers we start\nto develop an ego and we start to\ndevelop the understanding that other\npeople\nhave opinions of us\nit's like a nine-year-old like sort of\nknows that okay this person likes me or\ndoesn't like me but they don't quite\nunderstand that my actions today will\nform an opinion of this person this\nperson will form an opinion of me\nthat'll last and so I have to be careful\nwith what I do that happens when you're\na teenager it has to do with sexual\nselection\nexplain that part\num\nso if we think about why is from an\nevolutionary perspective why do we\ndevelop an understanding that people\nhave a lasting impression of me like\nsomeone has this idea of who I am that's\nfrom a mate selection standpoint because\nhow do people select mates it's based on\ntheir impression of you\nand so as we become sexually mature like\nwe go through puberty and a part of\npuberty is brain development and a key\npart of brain development is oh okay\nlike these people will have a lasting\nopinion of me so I need to behave in a\nway that makes me likable or attractive\nwhich in turn means that I can't airball\non the court for half an hour because\nthen people will think I'm in college\nthe other dudes on the court are going\nto think I'm hot and then they won't\nwant to mate with you yeah son of a\n[ __ ] how do you get rid of that how do\nI go back to being a nine-year-old\nI would like to learn better uh so I\nthink removal of the ego is the most\nimportant thing so if you if you don't\nhave an ego you can't be embarrassed do\nI do Ayahuasca for that\nsome people will use psychedelics to\nhave those kinds of experiences okay and\num you know psilocybin and Ayahuasca\npeyote\num\nthose all will usually have some amount\nof ego death\nbut\nI think a simple kind of like\nI think you're close actually because\nsome of the stuff that you're kind of\nsaying about you know it'll all work out\nlike\nif you're bad what difference does that\nmake\nyeah I think I I think it's good I'm\naware of it I'm usually aware of it in\nthe moment it just still feels bad so\nI'm like I'm aware that I'm breaking\nthrees and that makes me feel like [ __ ]\nbut it still makes me feel like [ __ ]\nthat I'm breaking threes\num yeah so I think that's where so what\nyou're trying to do is take away the\nfeeling of feeling bad right yeah\nso if you want to be stoic it's okay to\nfeel bad which I know you understand\n[Music]\nright so like hey\nand I'm not saying that I just realized\nthat could have been like a burn like oh\nlike you know what it's like I feel bad\nno I get it but but because I I see the\nI see the consequences of that with your\nphilosophy of life where you're not you\ndon't retreat from failure as you\ndiscussed earlier and so like it's okay\nto like feel bad for some reason and\nthis is where we could talk about this\nconcept of some scars or even trauma\nlike there are certain situations in\nwhich you're less you're more sensitive\nto feeling bad than others\nso my guess is that\nbaking for a tea party of women if you\ndid a terrible job you wouldn't feel\nembarrassed no but playing basketball\nwith a court full of dudes\ntrigger something\nwhy\nbecause guys are meaner\nthough women would be so sweet\nI I mean I like I don't I mean I don't\nknow I mean I can hypothesize but I'm\ngonna be gay no it's not gay it's not\nit's it's it's it's it's it's\nit just means that there's more\ninsecurity around the respect of your\npeers than it is around like mating\nstuff\nsure\nright so I don't think you're worried\nabout for whatever reason I mean there's\nprobably some there's a reason for this\nright you had some kind of experience\nearly on where like you doubted your\nability to be a peer with dudes\nyeah probably\nyeah\nyeah that's probably true\nI think there's a lot of uh\nmachismo-ness\nright so you weren't manly enough and so\nnow you've got like some kind of like\npsychic like wound\nof like okay like I gotta be manly\nyeah\ncan I ask you a personal question yeah\nyou can\nso I noticed you've got calluses on your\nhands I do is that from lifting when did\nyou see that\nyeah from lifting yeah it's from lifting\nour workout uh is there a reason you\ndon't use gloves\ngloves while lifting I think it's worse\nI think you'd have more\nI don't think it would help\nI've never found calluses\ndoes it yeah\nI feel like\nI don't want soft hands exactly I don't\nwant so I don't want to be no no soy\nsoft hand having ass I need a hard hell\nno dude right hell no I need grit on\nthese hands every dude who shakes your\nhand needs to feel\nI will I get called in my chat soft\nhands on a daily basis wait seriously\nYep this is real you I don't know how\nyou struck this they they actually\ninsult me by saying soft hands and they\ngo you got soft hands you never worked a\nday on the farm in your life\nand so you know\nit's but I'm glad you noticed they're\nnot soft chat I don't know if you guys\nsaw that yeah I think it's also\ninteresting because like the Twilight\nt-shirt also goes into this right\nbecause who who can afford to wear a\nTwilight t-shirt someone who's secure in\ntheir masculinity\nyeah my goal has always been to become\nsuper [ __ ] ripped and strong and then\ndo all the soy [ __ ] that I like doing\nyou know because if I'm wearing a\nTwilight shirt but I bench 225 like you\ncan't really step to me\nit feels good\nis that toxic\nno\nokay\nI don't think it's toxic I think it's\nyou want to prove to like like I mean\nwhat I hear is that you have certain\nthings that you want to do which\nwhen you do them it sounds like you\nmaybe feel a little bit embarrassed and\nyou need something else to keep the\nembarrassment at Bay\nright so if you're super ripped and if\nyou've got calluses on your hands if\nyou've got facial hair if you've got all\nthis kind of stuff then like you have\nthat Shield of machismo to where people\ncan't criticize you but that also\nsignals that on some level you're still\nconcerned about being criticized\nI think so I think I am yeah I think\nit's like\nit's human\nthere's also just a circle on the\ninternet that\nI would hate to be criticized by because\nI think they're all dumb and so I wanna\nit's like I'm sticking it to them in a\nway but I mean like I've also enjoyed\nworking out outside this context like\nI've been doing it for like about it 10\nyears but like like okay like alpha male\ninternet\nI think alpha male internet dumb is\nbricks right\nbut it's a lot easier to argue that if\nI'm also [ __ ] ripped\nand then I'm like hey you guys are\ncringe I like my Twilight shirt but\nmaybe that's just toxic\num\nI I don't think it's toxic and I don't\nthink alpha male internet\nso so what\nhow you doing with this conversation is\nthis okay I'm doing great how are you\ndoing okay I'm doing good but at the\nbeginning we were talking about like\ngaming and stuff and like now I'm like\npointing out things about your physical\nappearance and I realized that like that\nmay be a little bit\num\nit doesn't feel quite as collegial to me\nand I just want to like like we're not\non the same level right like I'm like\npulling things out and you're not like\nyou can point out things about my\nphysical appearance I pointed out your\nbutton down I think we're Fair okay I\nthink we're good plus you pointed out\nthat I don't have soft hands which is\ngreat ammunition for my chat for for\nmonths yeah dude you were very manly\nchat I mean you heard\num anyway yeah you were saying so so so\nI I think I so it sounds like like if\nyou do if you don't look a certain way\nand you advocate for particular things\nthe alpha males of the internet will say\nyou are us uh you are not manly because\nyou you know you can say this kind of\nstuff but you're kind of a feminate or\nwhatever right yeah and so in order to\nlike like disarm their criticism\nyou have to be particular things because\nthen they can't criticize because that's\nall they know how to criticize you with\nyes\nright I I think that makes a lot of\nsense I mean because I do think that\nthey have very black and white I mean\nthere's a diverse population let's start\nwith that right they don't all believe\nthe same thing but I I do think that\nthey have certain correlations that they\nconsider to be like law like if you're\nan alpha you have to be this you have to\nbe this you have to you have to check\nall these boxes and then you're in Alpha\nfor the record I don't think that\nthey're dumb as bricks I I don't you\nknow I think they're wrong about a lot\nof things but yeah I don't think that\nthey're dumb\ndumb as bricks is\num definitely a phrase I use regularly\nthat doesn't necessarily mean yeah what\nit says I think it just means that I\nthink they're wrong too I mean I think\nthey're wrong about a lot of things but\nI think part of the problem is that\nthey're right about a lot of things but\nthe way that they behave makes it very\nhard to acknowledge that there's a\nportion of stuff that's right\nyeah\nI mean that's the Andrew Tate I've been\ntalking about that because he'll drop a\ntruth bomb every now and again and\npeople freak out about it and then I'll\njust say a bunch of dumb [ __ ]\nyeah I mean I think it's like this Tick\nTock stoicism stuff where where there's\nthere's something that you want to\nAspire to but I think the fact that this\nsort of alpha mentality is growing\nwithin men speaks to\na serious problem that men have and the\nalphas are the only ones that are\nactually acknowledging it so this is\nkind of weird but like if you're a man\ntoday\nmost people tell you that your life\nshould be easy because you've got\nprivilege right and that like you're a\ndude and there there's truth to that\nlike men do have privilege there's a lot\nof good data around that kind of stuff\nand also that if you are an alpha man\nyou have more privilege so we we know\nfor example that men who are over six\nfeet tall are much more likely to be in\nleadership positions within\norganizations\nuh that man can get away with particular\nthings that women can't get away with\nwhat's kind of interesting is that women\ncan get away with particular things that\nmen can't get away with\nlike slapping people of the other gender\num and but but what's really interesting\nif you look at kind of Alphas is that\nthe one thing I've noticed about that\nwhole crowd is they're the only ones\nthat acknowledge that men have a life\nthat's difficult so they say like yeah\nyou know like if you're a beta your life\nis hard here's how to fix it but they're\nthe only ones out there that are saying\nactually it's like your life is hard\nwhat are you gonna do about it are you\ngoing to make something of yourself\nbecause it's tough now in your POS\nI can show you the way but it's really\ninteresting because they're the only\ncrowd that I've heard that really\nvalidates men's experiences\nright yeah everyone else is getting\nhandouts like it's trick or treat but\nmen because you get all your privilege\nno one gives you [ __ ] and your life\nsucks so who's helping you I'm helping\nyou\nyeah that makes sense yeah\nI think which may be a you know take\nthat'll get me canceled but honestly\nit's an observation that I've seen that\nnot many people are validating of men's\nexperiences\nno I think that's that's valid and I\nthink occasionally I try to throw in\nthings to hopefully make people\nlike maybe specifically like young men\nin my chat like feel some sort of\num or I like try to uplift them in some\nway or like validate that that same\nthing\num but I I wanna\nwhat what aspects should I take more of\nto acknowledge that while not becoming\nan alpha male\nwell\nI mean what do you think\ntrans people\nand then you start there and then that\nbrings in a huge crowd because that's\nmost problems on earth right so we can\nstart there\nuh no for for being real for being real\nit's um uh and by the way thriving trans\ncommunity in my in my chat very very\nmuch love them uh I think it's\nI don't know I don't I I just like\ntrying to tell people to do something\nthat's good for them that makes them\nhappy once a day that's pretty much it I\nthink that's a great start\nwhat do you think the alphas would say\nabout that\nI don't know I think they'd be on board\nyeah I guess right I I think a big part\nof that movement is\nuh so I think the healthy parts of that\nare like in acknowledging that\nyou're basically like responsible for\nyour own happiness and to try to\ncultivate that very intentionally and\nthat some of the living up to societal\nnorms\nwill not necessarily make you happy\nthat especially as a man like if you\nare sort of like a\nlike a robotic provider that you can get\ntaken advantage of\nso I think that there's a lot of like\nyou know experience that people have\nwith a lot of that stuff where they they\nsort of advocate for people to take care\nof themselves and things like that I\nthink the real challenging thing is\nthere's a lot of toxicity associated\nwith it which I don't think needs to be\nthere which I think is what your\nquestion is it's like what's the good\nstuff I think some amount of individual\nresponsibility some amount of\nacknowledging\nand this is I think what's kind of\ntragic is I hope we didn't even really\nlearn our lesson with the metoo movement\nbut the good thing about the metoo\nmovement is we started believing people\nwho said that hey this thing like\nhappened to me right and like instead of\njust sweeping it under the rug or saying\nyou deserved it I'm not saying that\neverything is better and we still\num\nfrequently do not take the complaints of\npeople seriously\nand despite the progress with the metoo\nmovement we see this a lot in medicine\nwhere uh like female patients\nare have a higher mortality rate when\nthey're\ntaken care of by male surgeons\nso there's just something about like so\nso male doctors and male surgeons will\noftentimes across the whole doesn't mean\nthat a particular surgeon is bad right\nbut they'll devalue like the pain that\nwomen experience and I don't mean like\nthe pain I mean like literally like pain\nscores like if a woman says to a female\ndoctor like hey I think something is\nwrong and all the labs and everything\nare reassuring and everything seems fine\na female doctor is more likely to say\nokay like I'm gonna ignore all of the\ndata and I'm gonna trust this person\nwho's speaking and I think on the whole\nwhat we see with male surgeons is\nthey're less likely to take that\nseriously and they're like more likely\nto focus on the data which literally\nleads to worse outcomes\nright and and I think what we really\nneed to do for men I know that was kind\nof a tangent but I think that was\ninteresting what we need to do for men\nand stuff is just acknowledge like hey\nif you're suffering like you're allowed\nto suffer and that's okay yeah and the\nreal tragedy is that I think if you're\nkind of anti-alpha\nthe solution is not to tear down the\nalphas it's to offer young men an\nalternative that validates their\nexperience and supports them as opposed\nto tearing down the one place where\nthey're getting that kind of support\nright\nyeah like if if there are if you just\ngot rid of all alpha males then there\nmight not be a place for people to go\nwhat's that guy's name Baumgardner that\nguy's great I I mean I think the reason\nthat you see alpha males crop up over\nand over and over again despite the fact\nthat a lot of them will get canceled is\nbecause no one is addressing the need\nso you can you can you know chop down\none you can cancel one but someone else\nis going to crop up right because\nthere's still a need for that sort of I\ngot almost into that [ __ ]\nalpha male stuff me too\nbecause I you know I I liked I liked\nlooking at every guy as like a like a\nfather figure or something like looking\nup to people I thought that was that's\nwhat I did for a long time\nbut I never got that\ninto it\nI don't know why College too liberal\nI think in my case it was just timing so\nI'm I don't think it was as available I\nthink if I if 18 year old me or 19 year\nold me was on the internet today I think\nI would be a part of that crowd\nyeah I see what you mean\nyeah I think if I was if I honestly if I\nplayed a different game I might be in\nthat crowd\nlike if growing up I had played a game\nthat was more on the computer and I'd\nbeen on the computer more than like Call\nof Duty so I'm on the console all the\ntime that I might have just gotten into\nthat crowd just because I might have um\nbeen more exposed to it\num\nbecause I've I've like\nuh at the very least I try to give\neverything like a listen and an\nunderstanding you know because I think\nthere's like conventions that are\npopular at least among like left-leaning\ngroups which is like oftentimes a lot of\nlike online communities like twitch and\nYouTube it's like all right uh you know\nJordan Peterson cringe maker bed guy Ben\nShapiro uh uh you know all right guy so\nI was like and then it's like Andrew\nTate this guy it's like so everyone's\nlike has these kind of like brandings\naround them so it's like for a period\nwhen I was in college I was like all\nright let me listen all these people and\nsee what they say and then I came to my\nown conclusion I was like oh I think\nthey're dumb\num but I think I was old enough to have\nhad values that made me come to that\nconclusion as opposed to just believing\nother people's conclusions what what\ndid they say or represent that made you\nkind of\nreject what they were saying or conclude\nthat they weren't good\nI think I\nuh saw it as like a general lack of\nmaybe empathy\nand I think I valued that really highly\num\nand then\nI think an inability to give things that\nwould help my life at least for me\npersonally so it might have been more\npersonal like I didn't find a lot of\nthings that\nlike from listening that I was like oh\nthis this is this helps improve my my\nstate of being\num\nit would more so like\nI think just maybe maybe make me find\nsomeone new to\nI don't know it it didn't help my life I\nthink because I got into a big\nself-improvement phase and this was like\nright around then and it was like none\nof this is making me like a better\nperson\nhmm\nyeah because I think a lot of people I\ndon't know about like Ben Shapiro I\nthink he's a little bit more political\nbut like a lot of people find Jordan\nPeterson's advice and methodologies and\nstuff to be like absolutely\ntransformative in terms of improving\ntheir life\nand I I don't know I mean I've sort of\nI'm not too familiar like as he's moved\naway from psychology I've con like seen\nor consumed less of his stuff but I\nremember being in residency and I\nwatched his lectures on personality\nwhich I thought were brilliant so I was\nstruggling to understand like\npersonality development because we don't\nreally get a whole lot of it in\nPsychiatry like we're focused on illness\nand diagnoses but like how does a human\nbeing develop in his I mean I watched\nthe whole thing because he kind of takes\nlike you know what does one lecture on\nokay this perspective says this this\nperspective says this this perspective\nsays this I thought it was really great\nwhat is that what what is it personality\ndevelopment\num so\ndo you know what person it sounds like a\nsilly question but what's your do you\nknow what personality is because I think\nunderstanding personality development\nmeans understanding personality like\nwhat do you think quiz\nI think I'm em GPA GP or something okay\nso let's understand you ready for a mini\nlecture sure okay\nso who are you\num blood wig I stream sometimes Okay\ncool so Ludwig right\nyou've been you your whole life\nversion of it yeah a version of it right\nsure so what are you always a streamer\nno were you always Ludwig\nno in college I was Anders okay\nand so\nare you the person that you were in\ncollege\nno no similar but have you always been\nyou\nyes yes weird\nyeah right did you always have manly\ncalluses on your hands\nout the womb\n[Laughter]\nthey gave me iron out the womb and I\njust lifted it\nuh so so I I think so let's start by\nunderstanding like what a human being is\nright so there's in the East we have\nthis idea that there's a self\nso who you are there are attributes of\nyou that change over the course of your\nlife\nbut there's a Eunice that is constant so\nit used to be like maybe two feet tall\nand now you're however tall you are you\nlook the way that you look you're a\nstudent you're a streamer you're a\nLudwig your Anders you're maybe one day\nI don't know if you have kids or not\nmaybe one day you're a father maybe\nyou're not you're married you're retired\nyou're a baker you're a streamer you\nknow like there's all these things about\nus there are things that we identify\nwith that all change\nso then how can you be you because in\none version you're a streamer who's this\nand in one version of that your body\nchanges your circumstances change your\nso there's a there's a true self\nabove the true self and that's the\ncontinuity of you amongst all of those\nthings above the true self is something\nthat I would say we is called a\npersonality now some people may say that\nthe true self and the personality are\nthe same but I'd say the personality is\nwhat's on top\nso how do we understand what personality\nis if you and I go into the same exact\nsituation\nwe will not do and say the exact same\nthings\nall of the circumstances can be a\nhundred percent the same but two human\nbeings will react slightly differently\nyou know you'll say what's up I'll say\nhello\nso personality is essentially\nthe construction that we have that\nshapes the way that we perceive the\nworld\nshapes the way that we analyze the world\nand shapes the way that we react to the\nworld\nso in one situation like for example\nbaking bread for a group of women I\nwould be really comfortable with you\nwould be really comfortable with I'm\nsure you're very Charming with grannies\nand I would be very embarrassed like I\nstill don't know how to dribble I would\nfeel a lot of embarrassment on the\nbasketball court right so there's some\naspects of our personality there's some\ncircumstances where people we'd be\nterrified to bake in front of women or\nbe would be terrified to look like an\nidiot like I'm totally fine like Chad\nmode like surround me with women like I\ndidn't play that game all day\nsurrounding view dudes\nharder\nyeah so that's what personality is it so\nif we think about personality it shapes\nthe way we see the world shapes our\nperceptions shapes our reactions and\nshapes our behaviors\nand that constellation and if we kind of\nthink about okay how does a personality\nform it's a series of experiences\nso when when you were seven years old\nand when I was seven years old on the\nbasketball court we dribbled and we got\nmade fun of and so that was painful but\nwhen we saw our mom's friends they would\npinch our cheek and say oh we're so cute\nand we became comfortable with that sort\nof thing so as we have these experiences\nwe lay down like\nalgorithms to deal with the world and\nthat collection of algorithms forms our\npersonality\nis there a layer above\nsure\num I would say that personality is sort\nof like deep set right so it's kind of\nlike programming at the algorithmic\nlevel and above that is sort of the\nindividual experience at a given time so\nif you look at the mind there's the true\nself then there's sort of like the Deep\nMind which has personality and then you\nhave a surface mind which will have\nthings like thoughts emotions things\nlike that because an individual thought\nis not personality it is built up from\npersonality it arises from personality\nso that's what it says on the surface do\nyou have a guy in your head that you\ntalk to\num not anymore\nreally yeah what do you got up there\nwhat's rattling around first of all I\nwouldn't say it's down up there I'd say\nit's down there\nso I used to talk to myself right I used\nto like and now what I've found is like\nI would say there's a signal that I can\ntune into is the way I would describe it\nthat has everything so it doesn't say\nspecific things it always has what I\nneed to know I just have to tune into it\nwhere is it\nall the way at the bottom it's what I\nwould call the self\ndown there so I talked to myself I like\ntalking to myself I like being in my own\nhead a lot I think it's fun I think I\ngot some good thoughts and I'm honestly\nI stunt myself a lot\nuh and I like I like thinking is should\nI have a should I have a guide down\nthere too you do\nhow do I talk to that guy\nyou don't talk to that guy you listen I\nlisten or that person doesn't talk to\nyou it's kind of weird but let me put it\nthis way so when you're talking to\nyourself are are the both sides like you\nknow there's one side that's like\nputting stuff out and I don't know this\nisn't going to make no sense so now\nwe're back to our conversation two years\nago so when you're talking to yourself\nthey're not at the same level does that\nmake sense\nit's like one person is pitching and one\nperson is responding yeah yeah it's back\nand forth yeah but but if you kind of\nthink about it one of y'all is doing the\npitching and one of y'all is always\ndoing the responding that's true right\nso it's not actually like a dialogue\nbetween equals it's like uh I'm gonna\ntoss something year away to accept or\nreject it's almost like a conversation\nbetween a parent and a child one of\ny'all is more mature and knowledgeable\ndoes that make sense yeah okay\nI can buy so the pitcher is at the is at\na higher level of mind and the reason\nthat you have a response down below\nright like you can test your like you\ncan pitch yourself an idea and you can\nconclude whether it is right or wrong\nbut that conclusion has to come from a\nplace of Greater knowledge because\nyou're passing judgment\nso there's a part of you that right yeah\nI think so and through dialogue\nwhat you're really trying to do is so\nthe person up here who needs to\nunderstand let me forget about that for\na second let's make one point so the\nperson of who makes the judgment\nis actually deeper than the person who\ndoes the pitching and you're one step\ncloser to the self who has all the\nanswers that's how that dude knows so\nmuch\nright there's a dude below that dude\nthat knows even more yep\nso you just you cut the middleman\nnot always but but I I think what I\nfound is that they kind of get\nsandwiched I would sort of say\nbecause I like asking tough questions to\nmyself\nabout like\nmy intentions why I did certain things\nwhat my goals were from those things\nwere they what am I honest even in my\nown head about my goals of those things\nand so on so forth\nso that's usually like some of the\nconversations I have in my mind\nLudwig when you ask yourself a tough\nquestion where does the answer come from\nmy little guy\nwhich little guy yeah I don't know he's\nin my head I think\nis it the top or the middle or the\nbottom or what\nI don't know I've always thought of him\nas just like he's stationed in my head\nlike he's he's at the top I think okay\nso he's stationed in your head yeah he's\nstationed there right but it's not you\nit's like this other person\nwell I guess it's also me sure no no no\nno no no no no not okay no oh Jesus no\nhold on so this is where you got to be\ncareful okay so you have to don't when\nyou say something that is like the words\nthat your brain is using to accurately\nrepresent your experience\njust because it doesn't make any [ __ ]\nsense don't go back on it okay right\nbecause that's how you actually won't\nlearn if you stay attached to your old\nperception or your conception of how\nthings should be you won't actually\nlearn but you said he is in my head\nI the I is the ego the I is the\npersonality that other dude isn't part\nof your ego or personality you talk to\nhim\nright does he know more than you or less\nthan you\nI think he knows more absolutely he's\npretty good he's very good like a thing\nI'll do a lot is I do uh conversation\nShadow Boxing\nand he always knows what the other\nperson's gonna say\num\nand he's pretty good at it he's very\ngood yeah why is he so good because he's\nomniscient\noh [ __ ]\nokay\nright otherwise like how would he have\nthese answers like you ask him tough\nquestions yeah\nand it's not and this is also now we get\ninto real subtle stuff if you ask a\ntough question and he doesn't have the\nright answer\nyou may think he's not knowledgeable\nenough but you just can't hear him\nthat's been my experience of it you\ncan't really tune into what he has to\nsay\nthis happened to me this past week\nbecause I had a question tough question\nand I doubted his answer\nand then I called my mom and then she\nmade me reassured in his answer\nsee he [ __ ] knows he was right he was\nright but it felt bad\nI'll give you the example so I I have my\nvalorian team\nand they are in uh playoffs to make it\nto basically the pros it's like the the\nmost important match of their life I\nwatch every single game they've done so\nfar\none of the playoff matches could\npotentially collide with a date of a\nwedding of one of my best friends in\nhigh school now we've we've uh not\ntalked as much recently we've talked\nlike I can count on our my hand how many\ntimes we've talked in the past\nlike eight years\num\nbut I had a decision which is either\nsign up to go to this wedding and if you\nsign up in RSVP for a wedding it's like\na few hundred dollars for the person\nit's not something you can flake on very\neasily and potentially like Miss\nthe game which would be devastating\nbecause I really care about this team or\nsay no to going to the wedding risking\nperhaps not even having a conflict of\ninterest because my team either already\nmade it through or got eliminated\nso I was like I thought this was the\ndecision I was weighing it was very\ndifficult decision\nand then the guy was like well you gotta\nrep the team but then me I was like well\nI feel really bad like I feel like I am\nbailing on a friend I feel like\ninterpersonal relationships is the real\nvalue in life and I'm I'm ditching this\nopportunity for online video games and\nstream and work and I should prioritize\npeople around me so I was like that\nthose were that's the the battle that I\nwas having and and so I like uh was\ndebating innovating invading debating\neventually I call my mom\nand she was like she was like\nshe was like well what do you think and\nI was like well I told her what the\nlittle guy said and she's like decisions\nbeen made there's no need to stress\nabout it why are you stressing about a\ndecision that's been made it's only\ngoing to make you more anxious and eat\nyou up inside just be happy with that\ndecision that you made and I was like\nyou're actually spitting bars\nokay\nso when you didn't listen to the guy you\nwere asking me what's above that right\nwhen you didn't listen to the guy what\ndid you expect\noh uh doubt insecurity so what are those\nfear yeah the fears those are all\nemotions right yeah emotions so this is\nwhere you ask me what's above the\npersonal uh personality that's where\nyour emotions and thoughts are below\nthat is this dude\nyeah so what's kind of interesting is\nthe dude doesn't really experience\nemotion\nno\nisn't that weird yeah he can be a dick\nokay\nbecause he's I feel like he's less\ncompassionate because he doesn't\nexperience emotion\ndoes he tell you to be compassionate at\ntimes\nperhaps I don't know if I'd necessarily\ngo to him for that I think I'd maybe\ndefault on it I don't know I haven't\nthought that deep okay yeah so something\nto think about so I think we've left\nsome people in the dust so let me just\nlet's take a step back great and\nunderstand a couple things so\nI think it's a great question I think\nthe question to start with is when you\ntalk to yourself who are you talking to\nand are those just two parts of yourself\nso we can say that yeah there are two\nparts of me but this kind of goes back\nto this like okay what is you there's a\npart of you that does not change right\nthat's how you know you're always you\nand if you want to know what the\nfundamental quality of that is it is\nyour capacity to experience stuff\nthat's what never changes over the\ncourse of your life you can always taste\nfood you can always feel pain you can\nalways feel pleasure all of those all of\nthe inputs may change\nbut there is a certain receiver that is\nalways capable of receiving stuff\nand this is kind of what what Descartes\nkind of figured out right so he was like\nconjuto ergo sum so how do I know I\nexist there's something here that exists\nand his philosophical proof he was like\nwell sometimes there are things like you\nknow trickery and hallucinations and the\ndevil may put thoughts into my head but\nat the end of the day there is something\nhere that is experiencing life\nso does that experiencer which is the\nreal self and when we get grounded in\nthat then we become true stoics\nbecause now we can just experience\nthings without attachment\nand this may sound kind of weird like\nhow could it be possible to enjoy\nfeeling sad for example\nbut we enjoy feeling sad all the time\nlike you watch a sad movie and yeah\nlisten to sad music and like it's like\noh my God so it's kind of weird because\nin our society we think that negative\nemotions are the same as suffering or\npain they're not\nand it's our ability to even and I've\nseen this with like cancer patients and\nstuff where they're like yeah you know\nlike life is such a gift and like cancer\nhas made me like see the world and you\nkind of alluded to this when you're like\nit'll all work out maybe not the way\nthat you think\nso that true itself once we get to that\ntruest self we are kind of at peace\nwe're tranquil we're stoic really\ninteresting thing is that psychedelics\nthings like ketamine move us in that\ndirection\nthat's why some of these novel things\nthat are being investigated in\nPsychiatry are so effective because they\ndon't work at the same level that like\nan antidepressant medication works that\nworks at the level of like\nthoughts in emotions we're literally\ngoing to give you a mood stabilizer that\nwill shut down or numb or decrease the\nactivity of the part of your brain that\nexperiences emotion it's a completely\ndifferent layer of treatment\num so between the self and our thoughts\nand our emotions which are up here is\nthis weird thing in the middle which we\ncould call personality or ego or things\nlike that we have the sense of identity\nI think they're even layer sub layers\nthere and so when you're talking to\nyourself it's kind of weird because you\nhave this experience where there's like\nthey're not on the same level\nlike one of y'all is giving the answers\nand one of y'all is like asking the\nquestions\nand it's not that the person can always\ngive the answers but that realization\nlike we also see this is kind of the\nlight bulb in our head\nwhere does that realization come from\nyou had all the information before\nyeah\nand so that's kind of like what we're\ntalking about here is that self-dialogue\nis like getting deeper and deeper into\nthe self and the more you connect to the\nself the more it stops becoming a\nconversation even\nand there's only right\nthat's what you're referencing is that\nyou're just listening to the self as\nopposed to having a back and forth\ndo you miss having a back and forth\nsometimes it's fun I think I saw\nprobably on some level will have a back\nand forth but it's very mild or I don't\nthink that I miss it I just kind of work\nmy way through it kind of on my own it's\nkind of weird I don't yeah I just\nexperience it differently\nChad he's still with us how you doing\ndon't do ketamine\nyeah so you know all these psychedelics\nand stuff people really do need to be\ncareful because everyone hears about\nthese great stories and stuff but\npeople need to really understand that a\nlot of this stuff even if you don't use\nit as medicine in spiritual Traditions\nyou have people who are like trained\nguides\nand and I saw a at I was at the American\nPsychiatric Association conference this\npast weekend\nand um there were actually a lot of like\nstudies and case reports of like really\nbad things happening from like\npsychedelics studies on like micro\ndosing and all this kind of crap which\nmicro dosing I think is probably a bad\nidea\nyes what all the Silicon Valley people\ndo or at least I hear of them doing\nit's like all the big CEOs\nyeah I think it's bad\nthat's fair\nwhat about that one drug they talk about\nthat one\nwhat's it called\nthe one that makes you not eat the\nwonder drug\nuh yeah there was a there's recently um\nomexa yeah it starts with an O right it\nreduces appetite I think so here's the\nbig takeaway with Wonder drugs\nwhen we have a wonder drug it's called a\nwonder drug because it seems to work\nreally really really really really great\nso they're like you know one of the\nfirst Wonder drugs we had was like\nfluoxetine or Prozac and it was like wow\nthis has really amazing things but\ngenerally speaking what happens over\ntime is as we collect data what we\ndiscover is that the wonder drug is not\nquite as wondrous as we originally\nthought\nand part of the reason for that is that\nthe original so there's this interesting\nClause where when you're trying to get a\ndrug through the FDA and I could be\nwrong here because I'm not an expert in\nthis stuff you have to register every\ntrial that you do on your drug\nbut you don't have to report the results\nof every trial to the FDA so what I can\ndo is do 16 drug trials and only report\nthree of them to the FDA and then the\napproval process is based on that\nand then what we sort of see usually\nwhat we see with Wonder drugs is that\nearly on the data is not that\ncomprehensive and the other problem that\nwe see with Wonder drugs is that\nthey're originally used not with\neveryone there's like a selection bias\nwith who uses Wonder drugs so for\nexample who in the United States anyway\nwho can get prescribed Wonder drugs\npeople who have good insurance\nand so people who have good insurance\nare more likely to have better outcomes\nbecause they're more likely to have jobs\nthey're more likely to have money\nthey're more likely to have other kinds\nof medical care so there's all kinds of\nother advantages that they have that\ncorrelate with the wonder drug they're\nalso more likely if someone is\nprescribing the wonder drug what does\nthat say about their doctor it says that\ntheir doctor is staying up to date with\nthe latest advancements and isn't\npracticing on outdated models which\nmeans that that in and of itself is\nprobably like a Doctor Who's going to be\nmore effective and so over time the\nefficacy of most Wonder drugs tends to\ndrop\nbut I think it suppresses hunger right\nit increases satiety signals yes and I\nthink it also or at least like there's a\nstudy that it suppresses addiction and\nso I think that's why people have been\nmore calling it The wonder drug\num\npenicillin is a wonder drug\ns\nthat one did not fail us no that's a\ntrue wonder drug yeah and peyote\nso I suspect that the psychedelics are\ngoing to be uh in the one in the real\nrevolutionary category which I think\nssris sort of are I think anyway yeah\nprobably I was mostly making a meme but\nI do want to do acid because Steve Jobs\ndid it\nbut I've never done it\nI think acid is probably one of the most\ndangerous psychedelics you can do I've\nseen the worst outcomes huh it's hard\nwhat do you mean hard like it's like\nthat's hard like it's some tough [ __ ]\nyou're doing that's badass\nit's like a harder drug\nyeah but that's not good it's more\ndamaging\nriskier\nhigh risk High reward no\noh this is the thing high risk\nbut of reward\nyeah but you may get reward with other\nthings\nokay\nright like this this is the other thing\nwe got to be careful about right not\neverything it's like\nnot everything is balanced in real life\nyeah I see what you mean not everything\nthat is high risk is necessarily equally\nHigh reward yes in fact most things that\nare high risk are just stupid\nah\nthat sucks it does but that's not the\nway that we think about it so this also\nthere's a really interesting cognitive\nbias that the cost of something\nso human beings determine the value of\nsomething based on the cost of something\nwe determine the value it's not\nintrinsic I mean it's not independent so\ntwo really interesting studies\nyou can take a group of sommeliers and\nwine experts hmm\nand if you ask them to rate a group of\nwines\nthey will agree on which wines are\nbetter and which wines are worse\nif you blind them to the price they\nstill agree they say that some wines are\ngood and some wines are bad\nbut the quality does not correlate to\nthe price\nif the people so high quality can be\ncheap and expensive can be crappy\nthere's like the sommeliers will still\nall agree with each other\nthere was a consensus on which wines are\ngood but that the good wines don't\ncorrelate with price if you take\nsommeliers and wine experts and you\ndon't blind them to price they all also\nuniformly agree but they agree that the\nmost expensive or most famous ones are\nthe best\nthey're biased by the price\nis a great\nmetric for Quality if you're lazy or yes\nignorant yes not lazy I mean that's the\nway your brain works it's efficient\nright laziness and efficiency is the\nsame thing yeah maybe not lazy right so\nas human beings we value things that\nother human beings value\nAlphas talk about this a lot right yeah\nsexual Marketplace value there's truth\nto that yeah\nyeah that makes sense yeah\nso and that's the thing is we think okay\nlike if something is high risk that\nmeans that it must like be better no\nlike\nyeah that it'd be cool though it'd be\ncool to coin flip for for like having\none of those Giga brains like in uh\nLimitless or if you fail the coin flip\nyou're brain dead\nyeah so I think that as a culture and\nespecially as men we have been we have\nnormalized risk-taking is something\nthat's valuable\nright because like it's dope yeah like\nso if you survived hard [ __ ] that makes\nyou more of a man so I'm gonna but I I\nthink I don't know if it necessarily\nmakes you more of a man\nI do think surviving hardship can give\nyou experiences you couldn't otherwise\nget though\nyeah which has value to your life as a\nwhole but I wouldn't necessarily wish it\non anyone right so like speaking of\nwhich there's like transformative\nexperiences through trauma but if you\nwant to like\nyou know\nmake something of your life I would not\nrecommend traumatizing yourself as a way\nto do it I think some amount of some\namount of\ndifficult experiences and putting\nyourself through that is good but that's\nmy whole point is like there's like\ndifficult experiences that you choose\nlike going on a hike or like hiking the\nAppalachian Trail or for me it was\nhiking so I like went to the Himalayas\nand things like that but do you like is\nEverest in the Himalayas\nyes but I didn't like it to Everest I\njust I just went to the foothill area\nstill tight and and yeah that was part\nof the spiritual journey\nbecause it's not legit unless you go to\nthe Himalayas right you gotta have the\nsocial cred you gotta have the social\nproof yeah that is social crowd for sure\ndo you do you think of yourself as smart\ndo I think of myself as smart\nuh I acknowledge\nI don't think of myself as smart but I'm\npretty I mean I I am smart I know that\nbut I don't think of myself as a smart\nperson\nChad do you think you're smart\nI like to think I'm dumb\nI think it makes me feel better\nI don't like to think of myself as smart\nyeah so one of the big things that I\nkind of discovered was I had a weird\nego around humility where I would not\nacknowledge the things that I was\nactually good at because I thought it\nmade me egotistical and so what I\nrealized is I actually have an ego of\nlike I'm gonna be the humblest person in\nthe room [ __ ] like look at me like I\ntrained at Harvard Medical School and\nI'm not even going to call myself smart\nI'm going to call myself average and\nthat makes me more humble and then I was\nlike that's egotistical like that's\nsilly I'm trying to no if I'm I mean\nI'm not dumb\nI can be went to Harvard\nthat's hard to get into\nit is\nI thought you were saying that you\ndidn't apply yourself in high school I\ndidn't I did you go to Harvard\nso I finished College I went to UT and I\nfinished college with a 2.5 GPA\nand then I spent three years applying to\nmed school\ngot rejected 120 times\nfinally got into Tufts University School\nof Medicine and then did my Psychiatry\ntraining at Harvard\nyeah that's tight\nso I think it's like yeah like I'm I'm\nsmart it's not ego it's I don't think of\nmyself as like oh my God I'm smarter\nthan this person therefore I stress I am\nbut like you know\nI think it's it's stupid and falsely\negotistical to not acknowledge what my\nstrengths and weaknesses are some things\nI'm good at I've given some I spawned\nright it's RNG where you spawn I was\ngiven some Buffs and I was given some\nBuffs debuffs\ndo you feel I feel like I know so little\nthat's why maybe I feel like I'm dumb\nI mean I I think I I know but knowledge\nand intelligence are two different\nthings yeah people say that I know\nthat's like a classic saying I don't\nreally know the difference between the\ntwo\nthat's what makes you dumb yeah\n[Laughter]\nthank you doc thank you doc\nI'm sorry I just I couldn't is that is\nthat okay that's great when you see the\nopportunity you gotta strike you get one\nchance no but I mean I mean I I think\nthat uh\nwhat were we talking about again so\nthere's a difference between\nintelligence and being smart and I or\nknowledge and being smart people always\nlike knowledge is like what you know and\nI guess smart is like maybe how like you\nnavigate certain situations or whatever\nand like your ability to critically\nthink but I isn't your ability to\ncritically think also just built off of\nwhat you know anyway like doesn't it\nCircle back anyway like isn't it just\nthe collection of all the things that\nyou've learned which is knowledge\naren't they one of the same in a way\nyeah so that's a really good point that\nthe more you learn the more your\ncritical thinking is improved is what\nyou're saying right yeah so so I I think\nwhat we kind of know is that\nso let's look at Physicians for example\nif you measure the IQ of a group of\ndoctors\nyou'll have a span right like some are\ngoing to be super high IQ some are going\nto be like actually average IQ\nbut if you look at the competency of\nperformance of doctors\nwe have a training that we go through so\nmine was you know four years and about\n10 to 15 000 hours of like psychiatric\ntraining and I had really good teachers\nand so I learned I accumulated a lot of\nknowledge my intelligence did not change\nfrom the start of residency to the end\nof residency what changed is my\nacquisition of a particular skill set\num\nlike I may have trained at Harvard\nMedical School but I still [ __ ] suck\nat DOTA like I'm I'm terrible right so\ncompetence in a particular field or\nexpertise in a particular field one is I\nwould say I would say it this way one is\nstats and one is like skill levels I\ndon't know if you've played D sure yeah\nI played D once in my day right so like\nyou've got a stat and then you've got\nlike your proficiencies or your skills\nand like what's your skill bonus that's\nwhat I would say is the difference\nbetween knowledge and and stats and the\nbig problem with Society is that we\novervalue stats and undervalue skills\noh really yes\nbut it's easier I think to improve on\nyour skills than it is your stats\nabsolutely which is why it's a real let\nme interesting statistics\nso you know what Mensa is\nyes that's the gene no that's the group\nof the genius yeah the genius so in\norder to join Mensa you have to actually\nhave an IQ in the top two percent of the\npopulation\num okay\nso let me ask you a question how much\nmoney do you think the top one percent\nof Mensa you take the smart the best\nearners not the smartest the best\nearners in Mensa how much money do you\nthink they make a year top one percent\nof earners in Mensa an organization of\ngeniuses\nokay well you're asking because it's a\ntrick absolutely I would I would have\nnormally answered 600k average okay it's\n250k\nokay you take the top one percent of\nearners in the United States\naverage just the whole population right\nwe're not pre-selecting for geniuses\nwhat is the top one percent of earners\nin the us annually yeah okay I think\nlike nine percent are millionaires I\nwould go with uh\nuh 1.2\nyeah it's over a million okay right for\nsure I mean there's weird statistics\nsome studies look at household incomes\nso it could be a double income so and\nthere's also half percent versus one\npercent but the ballpark is over a\nmillion\nso you take normal people and right so\nsome of them may be smart\nbut you can take the most lucrative\npeople out of a group of geniuses and\nit's 250k you just take one percent of\nthe general population there's all kinds\nof problems with this analysis you could\nsay well maybe Mensa selects for people\nthe people who join Mensa are the ones\nwho aren't successful outside of life\nthat's kind of a burn at Mensa but there\nare other there are problems with\nstatistic but I think one of the big\nthings that we've learned is that IQ\ndoesn't count for nearly as much as we\nthink it does or they're so smart\nthey've gone above the need for Capital\nand they realize that is a waste of\ntheir Pursuits that is that is\ndefinitely a possibility I don't think\nthat's the case okay fair that's fair I\nthink that what we've and this is the\nreal tragedy is that we have a we've\ngrown up\ntelling kids that giftedness means you\nshould succeed yes without really and\nthen what happens since they're gifted\nwe don't even teach these kill kids the\nthe skills that they need\nright so I was asking my mom the other\nday like I read with my kids and I was\nasking my mom like hey did y'all ever do\nhomework with us\nand and I I don't remember that you guys\never like read to us or did homework or\nanything like that and she's like no\nI was like why not I wasn't being\naccusatory or anything she's a great mom\nand she's like well you guys like never\nhad problems so we never thought we\nneeded to do anything\nand so what I realized is I was never\ntaught how to study and so what happened\nis like once I got to college like I\ncould brute force my way through like\nmaybe algebra but you can't brute force\nyour way through pre-calculus you need\nto understand like work ethic you're\ntelling me d-minus in that class I\nreally thought I could brute force it\nnope you can't and we were never taught\nstudy skills so now we have this crop of\nkids who we've told because you're smart\nyou should be successful and we don't\nactually equip them to succeed that's\nthe big tragedy yeah and then they end\nup feeling ashamed of themselves because\nthey're like I should be succeeding\nwhereas they don't understand actually\nlike the deck was stacked against you\nso if we glorified\ngills as much as we did stats then\nperhaps people would pursue it more\nor know how to pursue it more and that\nwould make them more proficient in\nthings in their life that's one part of\nit I think the other part is we'd have a\nhost of people who have high IQ or who\nare not filmed with filled with shame\nbecause we as a society have not taught\nthem that this is sufficient for your\nsuccess if you are smart you should be\nsuccessful that societal thing will be\nlifted\nfrom all of these kids which I think\nwould be huge for them\nI do think they should teach\nwork ethic\nI don't teach that me too\nI wouldn't quite call it yeah go ahead\nwhat do you call it well I think work\nethic is a is a amalgamation of\ndifferent things\nso I think\nuh sure you can teach people habit\nformation but I think teaching people\nconcentration\num is a key part of work ethic\nall right so what is work ethic maybe\nwork ethic is discipline but yeah work\nethic isn't just discipline discipline\nimplies that you were almost overcoming\na natural impulse but people who have\ngood work ethic have a combination of\ndiscipline being able to overcome their\nnatural impulses have a combination of\nhabits have a combination of like\nsupportive environment and have some\nskill at focusing and then there's also\ntwo other parts of that one is emotional\nawareness and the ability to manage your\nemotions because procrastination is tied\nto your emotions work ethic and\nprocrastination are kind of at odds\nand the last thing is some amount of\nintrospection because the best work\nethic comes out of like not fulfilling\nsocietal expectations but having your\ngoals like you said I'm gonna pick one\ngoal a year and that helps me it's about\nwhat do I want and then you can align\nyour work ethic behind your intention\nso I think work ethic is like a\ncombination of stuff\nbut yeah write down your goals huh do\nyou write down your goals\num\ndo you have any major goals nope no\ngoals yeah wow\nyeah I find that uh so I think a goal is\nis a little bit more as an outcome\nexpectation yeah right it's either meet\nit or don't meet it so what I tend to\nhave is like a direction and an\nintention\num okay so I can't achieve a goal this\nis something I learned like doing\naddiction Psychiatry with people are\nlike yeah I want to be sober for a year\nyou can't be sober for a year\nyou can be sober for a day you can be\nsober for a moment that's all you can do\nyou can never be sober for a year\nand so in that same way it's like okay\nwhat do I want to work on I have things\nthat I work on\nbut I can't get to that step unless I\nhave a goal it's hard for me to write\nthe intention to get to the goal without\nknowing the goal that I'm trying to get\nto yeah so I think it's useful to have\nsome kind of Target to move towards but\nI it's kind of weird but I don't\nso I have like a I guess that's a goal\nso you know I'll intentionally try to do\nsomething like I'll put together a\nlecture on trauma but I don't for me I I\nguess maybe I just have a\nthe word goal can be unhealthy for me\nthat's fair\nI think it can yeah the big paradoxes\nlike when I went to med school so both\nof my parents are sorry when I went to\ncollege I was pre-med and my both of my\nparents were doctors and so I was like a\ngood little Indian kid I was going to\nbecome a doctor and where did I want to\ngo I wanted to go to Harvard because\nthat's where all the smart Indie kids go\nand I was a smart Indian kid\nand then chasing that goal like made me\nfail out of college because it was all\nabout ego right and then paradoxically\nI didn't care about going there I was\njust like okay like I'm gonna try to\nbecome a doctor for you know for me and\nlike it's a good thing to do and I want\nto learn about the body\nand then went to med school and just did\na really great job when I wasn't focused\non being number one I didn't care about\nbeing number one\nI was just I want to like learn how a\nhuman being works\nput all of my energy into that now is\nthat a goal it doesn't have a Target\nit's like I want to learn as much as I\ncan about people and it turns out that\nthat's what led to the best my best\nperformance\nit's like when guys\na lot of guys are always like well not\nall this is a little like a blunt way to\nsay it but guys I think are interested\nin getting a mate and getting and\nfinding a girl or a guy or whatever they\nwant and uh and I think the less you\nfocus on that and the more you focus on\nlike you know just not pursuing that I\nthink the more attractive you become for\na partner so just like a paradoxical\nthing that is like the story of my life\nso I went to India at the age of 21.\nand then um it had a string of just\nterrible relationships or even if you\ncan call them relationships like for my\nfirst two years of college and then\ndecided to become a monk and so I came\nback from India and I was like I'm gonna\nbe celibate\nand then completely like I don't care\nabout women anymore like imma be\ncelibate and then like I met this girl\nand I asked her I guess I didn't\nactually ask her out on a date she\nthinks I asked her I didn't ask her I\nwas just like hey you want to hang out\nsometime okay yeah so she insists we\nwere dating I don't I don't know I mean\nI didn't you refute this yeah\nin retrospect I think she's probably\nobjectively correct like the signals all\ncorrelate with dating like but in my\nmind we weren't dating I was just\nand you know ended up being my\ngirlfriend ended up being my wife and it\nwas like really bizarre so it started\ngetting a lot more female attention and\nthen I got like married and then I was\nlike okay so like now there's no you\nknow it's fixed I'm done\nand so then when I interacted with women\nit was like there's no possibility of\nanything I'm never gonna have an affair\nor anything like that I'm not interested\nin that crap so then and then suddenly\nlike women were like interested in me\nand I was like what the [ __ ] yeah and so\nnow I actually actively avoid women who\nExpress anything like romantic interest\nthe key to finding someone\nis to start celibate\nthe incels would disagree yeah well\nthat's involuntary\nvoluntary celibate I I don't know I\ndon't sell that's a thing right\nyeah I don't know that's just a celibate\nright\nyeah I think there's a term called\nvolcell though I think that's real or\nthat's a character in Hitchhiker's Guide\nto the Galaxy either way\nI think it's a real thing but I don't\nknow I mean there's\nthere's a lot there yeah but yeah I mean\nI I do think that getting out of your\nown head so when you prioritize a goal\nlike here's kind of what I found is that\nyou put so much pressure on yourself\nyou're trying to live up to it you kind\nof mentioned with I think with your\nvalorant team that y'all are like growth\noriented instead of outcome oriented so\nI think goals make it easy to slip into\nthat outcome mindset\nand then if you're like talking to a\ngirl you're like in your head does she\nlike me does she not like me instead\nyou're not having a good time\nand you're not pleasant and then that\nbecomes less fun because half of your\ncognition\nis like watching the replay of this game\nwhile it's happening instead of playing\nthe game\nand then you suck at the game because\nyou're analyzing it constantly instead\nof just playing\nyeah you're too worried about if you're\nchoking the bag to focus on getting the\nbag\nyeah I think it's\nI'd be dumb to say that we're not all\naware of our goal for the Valerian team\nlike there is a clear goal there is a\nlike everyone has it everyone in the\nleague it's the same thing everyone\nwants to go up to the next step\nbut to say that it is a failure if you\ndon't achieve that goal be dumb and I\nthink there's like a lot of successes to\nlike celebrate and\nI'm very aware that this team won't last\nfor you know probably five years\nprobably 10 years you know like the\npeople will move on they'll find\ndifferent teams they make quit valoran\nall together and so I it'd be more\nsuccessful if this was a great part of\ntheir life that they remembered I think\nthan if we hit our goal and then the\nteam disbanded instantly and they all\nhate it you know what I mean like I\nthink that's that'd be more valuable I\nthink for me in them\nyeah so I think that's the kind of thing\nthat\nthat attitude right the paradoxical\nattitude and it sounds like y'all are\ndoing well and I think those two things\nare related that's the biggest the\nbiggest scam of life is that the more we\nwant something the more our mind gets in\nthe way of us getting it that's what's\nso hard about being human\nyeah\nyeah also I do this thing sometimes or\nif I want something I just think of\nhaving the thing and then I feel good\nand then I don't try to pursue the thing\nI want it to be the best match player in\nthe world\nand then while practicing to be the best\nsmash player in the world I would think\nabout being the best smash player in the\nworld and like would it be like to win\nand like everyone be like you're the\n[ __ ] best and like holding a trophy\nand then that felt good and then I would\nstop pursuing the very long\nboring tiresome Road of actually doing\nthat thing because it felt good enough\nto get a little crumb of what that thing\nwas like\nand then you're done wanting to be the\nbest smash player that was sufficient it\nwas more like that crumb felt good\nand it didn't feel good to like okay\nwell now you know grind Tech skill for\nan hour and do VOD highlights it was\nlike oh no I'll do that Chrome and then\nI'll just like play for funsies and so\nthere was it was less focused and\nintentional practice because I think I\ndeluded myself or just felt good about\nthinking about it and so that that was\nthe substitute for actually working\ntowards it\nso that's interesting I mean that almost\nI I've never heard this is fascinating\num a few people\ngive me trues when I say this I've said\nthis before so so it's interesting\nbecause I hear a lot of the converse\nwhich is that I fantasize about\nsomething and it destroys my motivation\nyeah and so what I'm wondering is\nactually if you've discovered a secret\nJutsu if you will\nwhich is I wonder if you can if you want\nto let go of a desire if you can use\nfantasy to kill your motivation towards\nthat desire and then move on to\nsomething else\nI know that was a lot more example Give\nan example so here\nso a lot of people like want something\nright like oh I want a girlfriend I want\na girlfriend I want a girlfriend and let\nme think about this so I hear from a lot\nof people in my community that I can\nfantasize about something all day long\nbut I never do anything about it I'm not\nactually motivated I don't actually\npursue it I just fantasize about it and\nif you look at the psychology of like\nwhy we fantasize it it does help us feel\ngood it's a coping mechanism for\nnegative motion and can give us some\namount of positive feeling\nwhat you described right\nI can fantasize about it feel good and\nthen no longer grind towards it but for\nthese people they actually still want to\ngrind towards it so it's a problem for\nthem that I live a life of fantasy\ninstead of actually doing something in\nmy life\nthere's another group of people that's\nthinks to themselves I'm too caught up\nin this and I need to let myself go\nlike I need to let this thing go I need\nto give up on this thing I need to move\non I broke up with my girlfriend 10\nyears ago and I can't stop thinking\nabout her boyfriend I can't get over\nthis relationship\nI want them back I want them back I want\nthem back and I don't know how to move\non\nwhat I'm noticing is that fantasy for\nyou allows you to move on\nso it's a problem over here right\nbecause you're no longer grinding\ntowards smash you're like often doing\nbetter things with your time\nyeah\nand this is the first time that I'm\nwondering whether fantasy can be used to\nwe can harness fantasy to move on\nfrom things\nyeah I think it's possible as long as\nthe thing is something you're truly okay\nwith moving on from you know\nand also like I think it would be sad if\nyou never truly tried as well\nbecause then I think that's how you form\nregret\nso like if you just fantasize and moved\non but like then 10 years later you're\nlike man I could have been the best\nSmasher I could have done whatever and\nyou didn't actually attempt it I think\nthat would still feel bad I think it'd\nbe harder I think you need to try and\nfail\nso I'm with you about trying and failing\nin terms of lack of regret so I think\nthe number one thing that leads to\nregret is\nnot giving it your all I very rarely\nhear people regret\nthings if they've really given it a fair\nshot\nthe thing that I'm kind of wondering\nabout\nis when you said if you're ready to move\non how do you do that\nfind something new\nit's the easiest way right like I think\nI wanted to be the best smash player in\nthe world and then I want it to be the\nbiggest streamer in the world and so\nit's like well I'm not gonna do [ __ ]\nboth\nso I just moved on from one to the next\none\nhmm\nlike there's something\nI think it's something here that is very\nhelpful if it can be understood I'm not\nquite sure what it is\nlike I think there's something about\nyour methodology which could really help\npeople\nI think\nif everybody writes down their goal of\nwhat they want to do not like make up a\ngoal but if you have a goal already and\nyou write it down and then you write\ndown intentional steps that you'll make\ntowards that goal and then you give\nyourself a finite time to achieve some\nsort of progress or at least do those\nsteps and see what progress you make\nthat gives you a point where you can\nquit like I think having a day where you\ncan quit and not feel bad about it is\ngood or have a day where you have enough\nsuccess that you want to keep it going\nbut I don't think people give them the\nthe themselves the chance to quit or\nkeep going it's always what ifs so it's\nlike you got to give yourself a chance\nto quit that's so I I just want to call\nout something I saw in your chat which\nis that's Ludwig he's different\nso here's the crazy thing\nI think\ning that\nLudwig is capable of this because he's\nLudwig could be one of the most\ndevastating mistakes that we make so\nwhen we say that this person is capable\nof this because they are them instead of\nthere is a technique or methodology\nright if we think about the best people\nin Esports\nwhy do they win because of them sure but\nthere's also something that we can learn\nwe may not be able to get to them but\nthere may be something in their\nmethodology and one thing that I think\nLudwig you may be really good at which\ncould be\nyou sound like you're okay with quitting\nyeah I think quitting's fine\nif you if I tried if I failed\nI I think I think that's that's big\nI think part of the problem that I think\na lot of people get stuck in is that we\ndon't we think of quitting as a bad\nthing\nbut if you don't quit you stay stuck\nyeah\nand I\nyeah I I think you're a quitter that's\nwhat makes you\nbecause you can't do multiple things so\nyou have to quit one thing to do another\nthing\nbut I also think\num\nsomething that I have and I think if I\nhave one superpower it is blind\nconfidence\nI've had that for a long time\nso I think a lot of people\nwhen they say that's Ludwig it's maybe\njust a lack of confidence I think you\nneed confidence where so you said you've\nhad it for a long time you've always had\nit\nI've had it for a while yeah\nwhere did at least that confidence comes\nfrom\n10 years I think in the philosophy that\nit'll all work out\nbecause if it works out then you can be\nconfident that the path you're taking is\nthe right path\nyou cannot be because I think there's a\nlot of like oh I should have done this\nlike wrong choice or whatever and\ngetting hung up on it but like if life\nis just a series of choices and you're\nalways sure that it will work out then\nyou can be confident that you're walking\nthe right path I think if you're\never thinking that you're in the wrong\npath it's because you either think it\nwon't work out\nuh or you're not confident you know\nwhich so if it all works out you got you\ncan be you can easily be confident\ncan I ask you a question yeah sure\nhow important do you think your\ndecisions are in shaping your future\nI think it's like\nwhat do you mean\nand shaping what the future is or how\ngood the future is\nin\nin how much control do you think your\ndecisions exert over your future\nI think every decision you make is what\ndetermines your future but like\nhow much you like the future you live in\nI don't think it matters\ndoes that make sense\nlike if I if I like boil it down like\na decision I made one of the bigger\ndecisions in my life was whether I stay\non Twitch or go to YouTube\nand that would have changed my life\ndramatically either way\nbecause I would have a very big switch\nand that would change my company and all\nmy personal relationships but in either\npath\nI don't think it the decision would have\nchanged like I don't think there was a\nright one like to this day I think it\nwould have been totally fine and happy\nif I was still on Twitch so I don't\nthink it determines\nlike how I feel about my life and what's\ngoing on\nokay so I think this is also something\nthat's very big so what I'm hearing so\nit when you make a decision in your mind\nare you looking for the right decision\nI think I'm\nI like decisions that I have\nthat no no I just I don't know yeah yeah\nI know I just pick the decision I just\nI'm usually pretty quick I just pick\nwhatever I think yeah yeah what I\nthink's best so I I think a lot of the\nso if we're talking about confidence at\nthe personality level what does\nconfidence look like at the thought\nlevel and at the emotional level\nconfidence like I'm confident in myself\nbut I think that what that looks like in\nin the actual thoughts that you have is\nthat you're not concerned about making\nthe right or the wrong decision\nthere isn't because some people go\nthrough life\nand in their mind there is a right\ndecision or a wrong decision and their\nhappiness or security is determined\nby the decision\nand since there's so much weight in the\ndecision you're paralyzed\nbecause if you choose wrong\nthe rest of your life is screwed it's so\ndeterministic there's no adaptation\nthere's no modification there's no\nthis decision is everything and what I\nfind with people and then what happens\nis those people are on don't have\nconfidence\nalways hand in hand like\nthe people who think that there's a\ncritical decision\nfor some reason they don't I think those\nare two sides of the same coin\nand I have to think a little bit about\nhow that precisely works out\nbut\nand so I think it's really interesting\nbecause I'm sort of the same way and I\nthink a lot of my confidence comes from\nI would use the word faith that things\nwill be okay\nand the cultivation of faith that like\nactually I'm sort of powerless like I\ncan decide what I want to but the number\nof variables that control what happens\nin my life\nis so high and the number of things that\nI have control over is so small like\nyou know what's the use in stressing so\nI'm going to just move forward in the\ndirection that I think I need to go\nand then ultimately remember that\nI don't determine whether I'm successful\nor not all I determine is what my\nactions are and that's what I'm going to\nfocus on\nyeah I think there's no wrong decisions\nI think that's where a lot of your\nconfidence comes from or vice versa\nyeah\nyeah against dope yeah I think it's dope\ntoo\nchat nothing you pick in life will be\nwrong\nand if it is wrong then you'll just pick\nanother one and then that will probably\nbe right and if that's wrong you just\nkeep going and eventually it'll work out\nyeah I think what makes things\neventually work out is that you are okay\nmaking wrong decisions and you pick\nsomething else and you keep going\nyeah I I I I think uh the challenge is\nthat sometimes people get stuck and they\nstop moving forward\nbut yeah\nsmoke meth well they just deal with\nhaving smoked meth\nand maybe you're like oh I shouldn't\nsmoke meth again\nyou know but you'll figure it out yeah I\nmean I should gamble only if you bet on\nblack then you should\nno I already Celtics game five\nI would I would still make smart or as\nbest as you can make wise decisions but\ndon't get too caught up in them right be\nflexible\num\nwell Dr K I've had a blast likewise\nmy balls are full of piss\ngreat I've been holding it in for a\nminute\nso I'm gonna go I'm gonna go piss\num\nand then I was gonna watch the\nPlayStation conference cool\nwhat do you got going on for the rest of\nthe day uh I gotta check my calendar I\nactually don't know you have a lot of\ncombos coming up\nyou're talking to squeaks I think\nI hope so yeah I think he said he said\nthat maybe Friday\nI'm looking forward to it yeah he's\ngreat yeah I think it's going to be\ngreat and then\num I'm not sure exactly who else I think\nwe've got like just a couple you know\none week left in May so we try to have a\nlot of convos but I'm really looking\nforward to it\nand uh yeah thank you so much for\ncoming on did it go well did you like\ntalking I loved it okay I did too yeah\nare you yeah\nso what'd you think\nI thought it was good I like talking I\nliked learning about the little guy\ninside of me\nI think that part was the coolest for me\nbut I think I might have lost some\npeople\nand I also like listening to what you\nsay and then making a silly analogy out\nof it I think that's always fun\nuh my favorite part of the conversation\nwas the eye-opening Revelation that\neverything that I've learned about\ntrauma applies to gaming\num\nyeah like I didn't realize that that\nlike all the stuff is like oh my God\nthese are all trauma responses it's like\nman\nI'll send you a screenshot when I hit\ndiamond\nand it'll all be because I start every\nLobby by going hi I'm Ludwig\ndude this also might fail as a tactic\nfor me\nyou got to say uh Anders\nyeah dude I get recognized because like\na as like a Valerian Pro on like a big\nteam I gotta recognize a good chunk\nby just talking\nbecause my mic is a little high you know\nwhat I should get a [ __ ] Mike that's\nwhat I should do I should get a [ __ ] mic\nand I should go by Anders\nwell I'm actually but when people find\nout your Ludwig how do they respond I\nknow you've got balls full of pissed\nthey're always very nice they're always\nvery nice they just play worse I think\nthey get nervous\nsome people play a little worse because\nthey it's like is he live so they go to\ncheck my stream during the game which\nmakes them play worse and then when they\nif I'm usually not live but they still\nlike have this sort of set of\nexpectations of how should I play with\nLudwig now in the lobby and so it throws\nthem off their game a bit\nwhich is so good anyway yeah yeah\nyeah so so it's I I'd love to hear you\nknow if you start practicing\ncommunication maybe we'll actually make\nthis video because I think there's like\na couple of key principles\nand um it's all been Illustrated like\nbecause I record every game that I play\num and so you can you can see the when\nit works or doesn't work and and but\nanyway yeah thanks so much for coming on\ndude and you know if there's anything\nthat um we can do for you please let us\nknow yeah we'll do thank you so much for\ntalking and sharing your perspective and\nI've learned a lot about\na lot of problems that we hear about I\nthink I'm going to Stew on this for a\nbit so thank you and take care of it all\nright hey how's it going man nice\ntalking peace\nforeign"
