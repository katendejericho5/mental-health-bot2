    "transcript": "games have become a way to socialize so\na lot of parents don't recognize is that\nwhen you restrict the game you are also\ntaking away your child's social support\nnetwork and so a lot of the resistance\nthat kids will send their parents ways\nbecause they're actually getting many\npsychological needs met by the video\ngame and imagine if I were to tell you\nhey like for the next two weeks you're\nnot allowed to see a single person that\nyou like right that's what parents don't\nrealize what they're really taking away\nfrom the kids and if they feel anxious\nor depressed that can tank our mood even\nmore a hundred percent right so people\nwho get addicted to video games are much\nmore likely to be on the autism spectrum\nthey're much more likely to have a mood\nor anxiety disorder so there's a lot of\nthings that people especially kids will\nuse games to cope and there's data that\nshows that games do regulate our\nemotions so they shut off our negative\nemotional circuitry in the brain"
