    "transcript": "someone walks up to you and was like Hey\nDr K I thought you did a great job I\nreally loved your presentation and what\ndo you do in your mind you reject what\nthey say your mind says I didn't do a\ngood job because I was feeling anxious\nmy perspective is that I was anxious I\nshould have prepared more other people\nare better and I did a terrible job you\nare getting data from the outside that\nis contrary to your belief now if we\ndon't know how to mentalize what we will\ndo is reject that that data right we'll\nsay oh this person is just saying it to\nbe nice that's what they say to everyone\nright this is what we do we dismiss what\nsomeone says so the core skill of\nmentalization is to assume for a moment\nthat the other person is right and then\ntry to figure out what do they have to\nexperience in order for this to be right\nwhere are they coming from how could\nthey possibly believe that this\npresentation was good"
