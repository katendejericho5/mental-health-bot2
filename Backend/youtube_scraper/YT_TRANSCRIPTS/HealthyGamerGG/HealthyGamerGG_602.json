    "transcript": "if you're someone who's in a social\nanxiety kind of situation or you have\nsocial anxiety one of the treatments of\nsocial anxiety is to actually give this\nperson data I'm not talking about doing\nresearch about reading about theories of\nsocial anxiety on the internet what I'm\nsaying is that if you actually want to\nperform well in life what you need to do\nis give your brain data give it\nexperience that it can actually learn\nfrom and adapt to and if you sort of\nthink a little bit about okay when does\nmy brain perform optimally it's not when\nI Theory craft my way all the way to the\nmoon it's actually when I give my brain\ndata sets and we sort of know this from\nlike playing games like you can Theory\ncraft as much as you want to but a\nthousand hours of theory crafting is not\na substitute for a thousand hours of\ngameplay right and this is kind of what\nwe see in social anxiety is that when\npeople are sort of stuck in their own\nheads one of the best treatments for it\nis some amount of exposure therapy some\namount of actually getting out there and\nexperiencing different kinds of things"
