    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about why it's\nhard to focus our mind\ndespite our best efforts our mind seems\nto remain scattered we're sort of\njuggling too many things we're starting\nto feel overwhelmed and without a\nfocused mind tasks don't get done in the\nright way so the funny thing here is\nthat as we try to solve this problem it\nturns out that one of the things that we\nthink is a solution is actually a big\ncause of the problem and that is\nefficiency if you're ready to take the\nnext step on your mental health Journey\ncheck out Dr K's guide it's an immersive\nresource that distills over 20 years of\nmy experience laid out in a way that is\ntailored to your needs so if you're\nready to better understand your mind and\ntake control of it check out the link in\nthe description below so hear me out\nbecause generally speaking we think of\nefficiency as a good thing right the\nmore efficient we are the more we can\naccomplish the more we'll get done the\nmore productive we are but as it turns\nout if you really look at the nature of\nthe mind and efficiency we'll discover\nhow a big cause of the scattered mind\ntoday is actually the pursuit of\nefficiency\nso let's take a step back and take a\nlook at efficiency so when we're talking\nabout efficiency what does that mean so\nin our mind we tend to have lots of\ndifferent tasks and what we used to do\nis prioritize right we can't do\neverything at once so you have to pick\nwhat to do\nthe tricky thing with efficiency is\nefficiency allows you to do more than\none thing right we can pack in more\nthings into one hour or even one one\nindividual moment if we are efficient so\nI could be for example like eating a\nburrito driving and listening to an\naudiobook and so this inefficient part\nof like my commute can now be\nproductively used to learn something or\ngain a skill and deal with this\ninefficient time that I have of like\nactually needing to feed my body so if\nyou sort of stop and think about it the\nmore efficient that we're trying to\nbecome okay now I'm going to listen to\nsome sort of book or audiobook while I'm\nexercising I'm going to read something\nwhen I'm on the toilet I'm going to\nwatch something every time I have a meal\nwe're even taking our fun and trying to\nmake it as efficient as possible\nand so this may sound a little bit off\nto you but there's actually a huge\nproblem with this which is when we are\nefficient we actually allow the mind to\nremain greedy so if we're not efficient\nwhat does the mind have to do it has to\nsay okay I'm going to do this and I have\nto let go of this other thing anytime we\nprioritize what we have to do is let go\nof particular things we have to devalue\nand sort of say okay I'm not going to be\nable to do that I just have the time to\nfocus on one thing and this is what we\ncall prioritization the tricky thing\nabout efficiency is it allows us to not\nprioritize right because if I've got a\nlist of 10 things I'm not going to cut\nfive of them off the list what I'm going\nto do is find an efficient way to\naccomplish them all and so when we end\nup with a greedy mind that is unwilling\nto give anything up because we're being\nefficient this is ultimately what leads\nto a scattered mind because now instead\nof focusing on one thing which is the\nconsequence when I prioritize right I\nhave to take things off of my list and\nthen as a result I'm just focusing on\none thing because this is the priority\nand I can't do everything anyway so let\nme do a good job here what is the world\nwe live in it's the opposite of that\nI've got 10 things to handle I've got to\ndo them all yesterday and so I result in\nsort of a scattered mind where I'm\njuggling lots of different tasks and I\ncan't give anything up\nyou may be a victim to this if you feel\nlike when you look at your to-do list\nyou can't afford to take something off\nof your list and if you can't afford to\ntake it off your list what do you end up\ndoing you end up being efficient and the\nmore efficient you try to be what is\nyour actual experience that you're\noverwhelmed and Scattered and your\nenergy is Spread Way Too Thin we also\nsee this in a surprising place which is\nactually online dating so when you look\nat an online dating profile today what\ndo you see you see a list of\nrequirements right six feet tall six\nfigures six inches or on the flip side\ndudes are looking for that's usually\nwomen are looking for that but maybe\ndudes too and then women are looking for\nsomeone who's emotionally available but\nis also like you know allows me to be\nindependent but makes plenty of money\nand we're sort of everyone's looking for\neverything right I've never seen a\ndating profile where someone says these\nare my priorities in this order if\nyou've got one that's the most important\nthing and if you don't have three\nthrough ten that's actually okay because\nthese are my priorities instead what you\nhave is someone who's looking for\neverything right I want it all I want\nsomeone who's physically attractive\nsomeone who's emotionally available\nsomeone who is wealthy and independent\nsomeone who you know these are the\nthings that we're looking for we're\nlooking for everything and we're not\nwilling to give anything up\nand what does that result in an\ninability to find a partner because\nwe're not willing to prioritize\nso the more that you're trying to\naccomplish everything whether it's tasks\nor find the perfect partner what you'll\nnotice is that as your mind is juggling\n10 tasks it can't focus on a single one\nand so paradoxically our desire to get\neverything done is what results in\ngetting very little done the more that\nwe try to do the more that our attention\nis scattered the more that our attention\nis scattered the less we are able to\nfocus on one thing and check one box and\nget it off of our list the more unable\nwe are to actually remove things off of\nour list the more our list piles up and\nthe more overwhelmed we become then we\nstart to juggle more and more and our\nmind becomes more and more scattered and\nmore diffuse and the cycle repeats and\nwhat is our solution to this oh that's\nright I need to be more efficient\nbecause if I can be more efficient I can\ncheck three things off at once\nand so paradoxically what we need to do\nis actually take a step away from\nefficiency we need to start to realize\nthat the more efficient I try to be\nactually what my mind is doing is being\nextra greedy I'm not willing to give\nthings up and if I'm not willing to give\nthings up I can't actually focus on one\ntask if you're listening to this and\nyou're feeling kind of skeptical about\nit let's take a look at that because\nyour mind right now is saying I can't\nafford to prioritize I can't afford to\ngive things up my boss demands too much\nI have to exercise I have to do this\nstuff I have to clean the house I have\nto build my skills I have to learn\nsocial skills I have to learn how to\ndate I have to get in shape I have to\ncontribute to my retirement I have so\nmany things to do\nand think about when you're that's the\nstrategy of your mind where has it\ngotten you when you've tried to do a\nthousand things because they're all so\nimportant and you can't afford to give\nsomething up how does that actually end\nup working out\nand think about the converse as well I\nwant you all to think about a time in\nyour life where you've woken up maybe\nand you were focused on just one thing\nfor some reason you were not burdened by\neverything and there may be these\nmoments in your life I know I've\ncertainly had them and especially if\nyou've got ADHD this may resonate with\nyou that you wake up and in four hours\nyou can do one week's worth of work\nyou're just like banging things out one\nat a time one at a time one at a time\nand you get so much done and if you have\nthese moments you may start to think to\nyourself wow imagine what I could\naccomplish if I could do this every\nsingle day and so since you know you're\ncapable of it you start to add more and\nmore things on okay I can now add tons\nof stuff because if I can get to this\nmaximum efficiency of getting so much\ndone in four hours then I could\naccomplish so much\nbut think about how your mind actually\noperates in those four hours\nand I would bet money that in those four\nhours your mind is not actually trying\nto do a thousand things at once the way\nthat you accomplish so much is because\nyou're not actually thinking about the\nhundred things that you have to do\nyou're just thinking about one and you\nfinish it fast and then your mind is\nlike all right I feel pretty good let's\ndo another thing boom let's do another\nthing boom let's do another thing boom\nand so it turns out that the more we\nfocus on efficiency the less we\nprioritize the less we prioritize the\nless our mind has to give things up\nwe're facilitating a greedy mind that\ndoesn't have to give anything up is\nunwilling to face the consequences of\ngiving things up as we're unwilling to\ngive things up our attention becomes\nscattered and we actually don't perform\nvery well\nand so how do we fix this a couple of\nthings that you can do the first is to\nnotice when your mind seeks efficiency\nand when it seeks efficiency tunnel down\ninto your emotional state in that moment\nand what you'll probably discover is\nthat your mind is unwilling to grieve\nthe loss of a particular thing and so it\nfeels attached and bound to that thing\nand the more attached and bound it\nbecomes the more scattered it will\nbecome the harder it will be to attain\nthat flow State because you're so\nstressed so even the noticing can help\nthe second thing that you can do is a\ntechnique called\nso this is a very very old premeditative\ntechnique that was taught by yogis in\nthe Himalayas so they sort of notice\nthis even before we start to meditate\nbecause a lot of times people will tell\nyou oh maybe you should meditate but\nthat may be hard for you so there's\nactually a preparatory exercise\nis about focusing on one thing at a time\nand you may say but that's hard for me\nso that's why we're gonna start small so\nforget about the important things\ninstead what we're going to do is take\nthe unimportant things and we're going\nto just do one thing at a time so if\nyou're eating a meal don't watch or\nlisten to anything don't even have a\nconversation while you're eating a meal\njust focus on eating the meal that's all\nwe're gonna do\nother examples of this or if you're you\nknow in the shower or in the on the\ntoilet or something like that steer\nclear of your phone because there's a\nlot of negative impacts of Technology as\nwell\nbut anytime you're doing something as\nmany things as you can just do that\nthing if you're going for a walk don't\nlisten to an audiobook if you're\nexercising maybe you can listen to music\nbut even try exercising without\nlistening to music\nso as many things as you can just do\nthem by themselves and what this\nfacilitates is every time you do that\nyour mind has to give something up right\nyou're going to practice getting rid of\nefficiency because now we're not\nlearning and exercising at the same time\nand as you'll sort of discover as you\ntrain up that muscle you'll be able to\ngive things up and as you're able to\ngive things up and be free of efficiency\nyou will actually facilitate those flow\nStates or those hyper productivity\nStates and there are also benefits for\nthings like it'll help you facilitate\nsetting boundaries because as you give\nthings up and you sort of recognize that\nyou can't do something you will sort of\ntell people hey I'm sorry I can't help\nyou with this and internally you're\ngoing to set your priorities as you set\npriorities it'll help you set boundaries\nand the last thing that you'll see and\nwe've seen this a lot in career coaching\nwhen we sort of train people to focus on\none thing at a time is a reduction in\nBurnout\nso if you're struggling with a scattered\nmind chances are the reason that you\ncontinue to have difficulty focusing is\nbecause you're actually sabotaging\nYourself by pursuing efficiency\n[Music]"
