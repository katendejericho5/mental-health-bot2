figuring out how to chat with y'all\nso that's pretty cool\nuh my name is Olive kenoji just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if you all have a concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional\num yeah so happy Friday everybody uh\nwe've got a couple of quick\nannouncements and then we're gonna hop\ninto a conversation with Jay\nso let's see first thing is we um have\nour community event that's running today\nrunning this month which is mindful\nMayhem and it's a good opportunity for\nyou all to practice mindfulness\nearn XP win rewards and whatnot so a\ncouple things we've done a few\num community events here at HG and and\nyou know we like we do things like make\nYouTube videos and stream and all that\ngood stuff and we teach all about mental\nhealth but at some point you all have to\nstart doing something so some people\nwill do stuff like\num you know we've got exercises and\nstuff in Dr K's guide uh some people\nwill do things like sign up for coaching\nI've seen a lot of stuff today because\nit's like um dating Friday on our\nsubreddit and people are like you know I\nhave difficulty socializing so group\ncoaching and stuff like that really\nhelps for that sort of thing helps you\nbuild emotional awareness helps you like\npractice communication helps you\npractice listening it helps you do\nthings like uh\nhow do you jump into a conversation when\nis it your turn to speak so a lot of\npeople have this problem where\nthey kind of like you're in a\nconversation but you don't know like\nwhen you're supposed to speak and you\nhave something useful to say but then\nit's like that window passes and once\nthe window passes it's like well now I\ndon't have anything useful to say like I\ndon't have anything good to say I had a\ngood thing to say like I had a good joke\nI had to go to anecdote but like now the\nwindow is passed and I can't reverse the\nconversation\nso if you really think about it what\nwe're seeing in society is a social\nskills atrophy right because we don't\npractice these things because we can\ncommunicate so much online and the cool\nthing is it's such a common thing in in\ngroup coaching where people are like\nwhen is it my turn to speak like how do\nI break into a conversation how do I\ngive each other space how do I claim the\nspace that I have or I'm supposed to\nhave\num and so you can kind of learn all\nthose sorts of skills there and it's\nreally fascinating because when I we\nhear about people dating like it sounds\nlike people it's hard for people to talk\nlike people don't know how to talk so\nwe sometimes have stuff like that but\nthe other thing that we have is our\ncommunity events and so mindful Mayhem\nis a photo challenge where you're going\nto go out and you're going to do stuff\nchat\nand we're going to do things like\npractice box breathing make your bed\nright we got to start small chat\nburn a scented candle okay this person\nis just uploading all of the pictures\nand it's racking up all of the points\nbrew a cup of tea or coffee make your\nbed nice\num complete a resource pack okay\ncomplete another one make your bed okay\na lot of people wait that's the same\npicture\nsomeone is cheating gastronaut\nhas discovered a hack chat\nset three goals for the day awesome\ncomplete uh right a right thing three\nthings you like about yourself so like\nthis is all this stuff where eat some\nfruit like if we talk about being\nhealthy\nright if we we're like okay we're gonna\ntry to be healthy\nthere's like watching YouTube videos\nabout being healthy which we are pleased\nthat you all do thank you so much for\nliking and subscribing and commenting\nand all that kind of stuff but then\nthere's the actual part of being healthy\nwhich is really interesting actually for\na second because there's some evidence\nthat language can substitute for Action\nwhen it comes to progress and change\nwhich is crazy\nbut there's there's data behind that\nbut this is just a way to encourage you\nall to start doing those things that you\nalways want to do so check out mindful\nMayhem\num and then last thing that we're going\nto talk a little bit about uh you can\ntype exclamation point mindful in chat\nto join\num and then\nlast thing that we're going to talk\nabout is we're going to introduce our\nepic guests today so hold on a second I\ngotta do this\nI gotta do this\nokay I gotta make sure that things\naren't you muted\nokay hold on chat\nI'll figure this out eventually\nwe're gonna do this\nthen we're gonna go here\nand so we have the awesome Trey Dorena\nepic comedian\num and we're gonna watch like two of his\nclips and then we'll hop into the\ninterview okay yo this is so\ntitillating watching a guy craft his bed\nlike he's painting the sequel to The\nMona Lisa all I can think is what a\n waste of time he's putting hours\ninto something that he's he's gonna fart\nin later he's gonna fart he might chart\nby accident foamy idiots yo this\nis so okay\nwe measure our dicks inaccurately now\nhear me out okay usually we measure from\nbase to tip and usually from the base of\nthe bottom not the base of the top\nnothing but hurt feelings up there okay\nbut that is only a measure of length\nwhere girth is arguably just as if not\nmore important so without having to like\ndo complex math to figure out their\ncircumference and the diameter of a\ndingus like we should just be measuring\ndick size by volume and we simply fill\nup a glass full of water you put\nyour right in it and the amount of\n water the reveals placed out of\nthe cup still is your size the more\nwater that gets displaced the bigger\nyour\nokay\nwell this should be interesting\ncomedy chat\nall right let's hop in with Che\num let me do this\nokay I'm gonna click this button\nI'ma pop out this chat I'm gonna go down\nhere\nand we're gonna do this\nand we're going to make sure that this\nworks\nand it works\nand now we're just waiting for check\nso this should be interesting\nvolumetric comparisons absolutely dude\num\nit is oh so I think it's against both\nYouTube and twitch's terms of service to\nlive stream simultaneously on both\nplatforms\nit appears that Che is a man of science\nand it appears he's AFK GG chat\nso we're just gonna Vibe for a little\nwhile\nwe're waiting\noh no\noh no chat\num how are we all doing today\nlet me see if we can do this\nwhile we're

we can't just bubble all the\ntime otherwise you will get a repetitive\nstress injury RSI normal times we are\ntalking about carpal tunnel\nbut you can get RSI at the base of the\nocciput\nthat is from the head bubble injury\nbecause these these your paraspinal\nmuscles and the ones that insert into\nthe back of the occiput\nthese are the ones you have to be\ncareful about their RSI repetitive\nstress injury\nOK we can talk to satguru but I think\nmaybe he will be offended no\ncan't talk to him in an accident dude oh\nmy God\na Ninja 2 saying I like other RPG\nsystems better

could get an\ninjury from that okay Chase back let's\nsee just shared your screen wow it's not\nworking\nlet me see\nnope\nokay let's focus on audio and I can walk\nyou through video if you can hear me\ninstead of me typing\norder of operations you want to know one\nthing I learned in medical school you\ngotta do things in the right order you\ngotta do a physical exam before a CT\nscan\nright\num\nusing the right audio device\nwe like checked this just before\num\nI hope it's not me\nyou can try doing a full screen share\ninstead of\num\ncan he hear you type can y'all hear me\ntype\ndo you like this so so this is actually\nreally cool I don't know if you guys um\nknow domination time but when I first\nstarted streaming\ndomination time was really really\nhelpful and he actually like he has this\ngreat website that has like all of his\nstreaming set up and he also recommended\nlike this Kinesis gaming keyboard and\nthe thing that I love the most about the\nKinesis gaming keyboard This is not\nsponsored by Kinesis but I guess they\nshould be is that I don't know if you\nall right but I I try to write so I\nwrite a lot\nright so and then what's cool about\nwriting is\num I can't hear myself when I test for\nsome reason\nuh\nuh are your speakers on\nweird\num\nyeah Tom and so so this is great\nactually because I can like\nI can move it so I you know you\nshouldn't write like this this little\nthis little like\nmy wife has this Apple keyboard and she\nlike types like this all day because\nit's like this tiny little cute keyboard\nand so she's got this ulnar deviation at\nthe wrist all the time\nand and instead what's cool is like if\nyou're you know like a like a command\ncommand chair where your arms are like\nthis and you can type\num\nthey're on okay\nyou can hear other sound\nLike You YouTube\nhmm\nlet me see\nuh\ntry screen sharing if you don't mind\nChad position\nthumb clusters what is a thumb cluster\nthat sounds\nthat sounds uh\ndo you recommend it as a doctor though I\nmean it's probably good or I like I\nthink it's good ergonomically but I'm\nnot an expert in like ergonomics I do\nsome of the yoga as you know\nbut I would have to really do a little\nbit of research before I could recommend\nsomething as a doctor did you know that\nfour out of five dentists recommend this\nkeyboard\nis Che coming well he's he's\nall ready for it he's trying to come\nhe's just having some difficulty\nand I'm trying to give him a hand\nokay you're screen sharing now\nI can hear YouTube okay weird I don't\nsee a screen share\num\nand you have the right input devices\nselected for audio\nand speakers\nI I mean come on chat y'all y'all teed\nme up for that one that was not like\nthat was not like a oh my God clip it\nlike oh my God Dr K made a joke about\ncoming because people were asking if\nChase come in and I was like he's trying\nto come like oh my God\nlike okay so here's the thing\nthere are two words that are homonyms\nbut mean very different things\nright like\nis your mom coming on an airplane it's\nlike yeah my mom is coming on an\nairplane like there's there's just so\nmany different\nyou know\nDr K my tonsil hurts because of my TMJ\nand\nmy teeth clenching what do I do\num\nI would see a doctor for your TMJ\nhomophones\nhomonym\nhomophone you're right homophone my bad\nI don't know what a homonym is homophone\nis two words that sound the same right\nyeah I I mean the the weird thing is\nI've never heard of TMJ causing tonsil\nproblems that sounds weird it's the\nother reason to see a doctor is because\nif you've got problems with your tonsils\nlike sometimes you'll get like weird\nautoimmune stuff and things like that\nallergies and infections\nso usually TMJ can actually cause\nproblems with things like tinnitus\num\nokay everything is the right setting you\nwanna try restarting comp\noh my God Zoom interview\nlet's do\num\nokay he's gonna try to restart and then\nwe've got backup plans okay stay with us\nchat thank you so much for being patient\neverybody\nsometimes in life the best things are\nworth\nwaiting for\nand this conversation I guess has to be\nepic\nso here's the thing we got to talk about\nbalance in life for a second\nso\nyou know I hate to say this but everyone\nsort of thinks that like life is\nbalanced right we're kind of like oh my\nGod like this person has an advantage\nand so therefore like I have the same\namount of advantages and I just need to\nuncover my advantages and like everyone\nsort of thinks like we sort of assume we\nlive in this world where we assume that\nthings are like equal\nthe truth of the matter is we're not all\nborn with like the same level of stat\npoints it's like it's kind of like the\nold school d d where it's like you roll\nthree D six six times\nand\nsome people get really good stats and\nsome people get really bad stats and\nthat's like really the real tragedy of\nLife honestly this is my been my\nexperience as a psychiatrist is that\nthings are not fair or equal\nand\nand I think the more we understand that\nlike hopefully off the better will be\nbecause I think the biggest problem is\nthat sometimes like people just need\nmore help than others and sometimes\npeople are capable of helping more\nbut the problem is that we compare\nright we're like okay like this person\nis doing this so I should do this or I\nfeel less than this person\nbecause\nthere's some sense of equality does that\nkind of make sense like if you make a\ncomparison with someone else\nand you conclude that oh I should be\ndoing this because this person is doing\nthis or I feel less than this person\nbecause this person is doing all these\nthings and I'm not doing that much no\nit's like y'all are like it's completely\ndifferent game\nthe reason that person is doing so much\nis because of chances are their\ncircumstances in spawn point\nand y'all may say but like what do you\nmean like that's not how it is right\nisn't it like that's not how the world\nworks but actually if you look at data\nit's kind of how it is\nso if you look at what you know what\ncorrelates the most with median income\nis socioeconomic standing\nso how rich your parents are\nthings like parental involvement and\nwhether parents like prioritize your\neducation growing up it's not actually\nIQ like IQ doesn't correlate very\ntightly with median income\nand so if you it's really circumstances\nit's all about your spawn point\nso cut yourself a little bit of Slack\nchat\nand if someone is doing better than you\nat life it's okay for them to be doing\nbetter than you because you all are\nplaying different games\nI discovered something recently if y'all\nare kind of curious who here struggles\nwith Envy\nthey'll struggle with Envy\nthis is kind of related\nspecial stats from Fallout absolutely\ndude\nOkay so\nthere's this really interesting text\ncalled the vishuda Maga which is the\npath of purification\nand it talks a lot about the different\nproblems in our mind and a lot of people\nend up struggling with Envy right\nso let's like let's understand Envy for\na second\nEnvy is something that you see something\nin someone let's see oh was Che here\nno\nokay no problem let's do this\nI wonder though\nhmm\nokay sorry I was talking about Envy I'm\ntrying to do tech support and teach all\nabout Envy at the same time\nit's like what is going on here\nokay let's talk about Envy\nso if you struggle with Envy\nit's interesting because we don't really\nteach people okay here we go damn it\nor yay I suppose\nokay does this work\nokay I can hear you now okay right on\nsorry about that I don't know what's\ngoing on with disc I've never had those\nproblems before oh it's all good man um\nlet me do this let me just disconnect\nfrom the Discord call\nand yeah\nsame turn this on\nthere we go should be good just gonna\nget my camera settings figured out here\nand now I just realized I have a slight\nproblem\nbecause what's that\nI'm gonna have to\num\nI'm gonna have to change\noh there you are oh\nokay okay cool yeah I don't know weird\nI've disc is always the best for me and\nI like we're on disc constantly but I\ndon't know what's going on with it today\nyeah let me just um grab a\nI have to grab\nthe right\nChrome window\noh I feel yeah so you can screen grab\neverything yeah so let me just\ndo that real quick\nlet's hope it works\nnope\nhere we go\nall right hey\nhey I could I think we're good\nit's not a stream without a few\ntechnical difficulties yes absolutely\nman\nall right so we'll we'll we'll get to\nEnvy at the end to chat yeah promise\nwe'll do a quick segment on Envy\nI was talking about Envy maybe yeah\nso uh welcome Che hey thanks for having\nme on I appreciate it um thanks for\nbeing here and do you want to just tell\nus a little bit about we watched a\ncouple of your Clips it's like\nit's good stuff man thanks man I\nappreciate it I appreciate it um and so\ntell us just a little bit about uh you\nknow where we can find you what you do\num so I'm on all social platforms at\nshade Arena uh I'm a stand-up comic I've\nbeen doing stand-up for about like 10\nyears\num and that was kind of the Catalyst for\nme to start making content and do all\nthose kinds of things\nuh in terms of creation was like uh I\nwas doing stand-up pretty much every\nsingle night for seven or eight years\nand then pandemic hit couldn't do it\nanymore so then look for other mediums\nto keep creating uh and found that there\nwas like huge reach on social media got\nlike way more reach than you can get in\na comedy club so then just started like\nhounding that really well to kind of get\nout to more people and sell more tickets\nand do all those things to make sure you\ncan have a successful entertainment\ncareer\nthat sounds hard\nuh it yeah it is hard like it's not easy\nbut it's\num I think it's a big part of if you\nthat whole thing if you love what you do\nyou'll never work a day in your life\num being able to feel motivated because\nyou really enjoy the process of of what\nyou're doing makes it a whole lot easier\nand can you tell me what's it you said\nyou were doing stand up every night for\nseven years yeah not like every single\nnight but other my sort of my rule for\nmyself was a night off every two weeks\num and that's pretty I was pretty\nconsistent with that for me to take a\nnight off more than it honestly it was I\nhad to set that rule because I wasn't\ntaking enough time off\num so I yeah pretty much every single\nnight you would go out whether or not it\nwas some little Open Mic or you're\nbooked on a few shows in a night you try\nto get somewhere between 10 and 20 spots\na week\num so you can be going up and really\nlike grinding and working on your craft\nuh that's something that's I I'm not too\nwell versed with a lot of other uh\nperformance arts but I know with stand\nup it's something very specific to stand\nup where you really want to be uh on\nstage as much as possible so can you\ntell us a little bit about that like\nwhat's it um and by the way is there is\nthere something in particular you want\nto talk about today\num I don't know if there's something in\nparticular that I want to cover like I\nknow we dive into mental health and I\nwas just kind of ready to be upfront and\nforward with anything you threw at me\nokay and I I saw that for some reason it\nsays that we're talking about death\ndeath oh yeah I know they I remember\nthat was the they uh that was the thing\nthey were like prompted those put\nforward uh in terms of you as there was\na uh it was my rep or maybe it was\ndirectly from you asked what how do you\ndeal with mental health and death is\nusually how I kind of ground myself\nthat's bizarre can you tell us what that\nmeans yeah\num it sounds very morbid but I think\nit's really peaceful like I think uh\naccepting that you're gonna die like I\nthink if you like how often do you\nreally\nbit and think about that like you're\nyou're gonna die like that's inevitable\nlike I think we because I know I\ndefinitely will prior to coming to\nacceptance the to the fact that I'm\ngonna die I would live in I wouldn't say\nit was like a fantasy but in a little\nbit of an unrealistic place where I was\nlike oh maybe we'll get reach the\nFountain of Youth there's all these\ntechnological advancements maybe\nsomething will happen where I will not\ndie I will live forever or or whatever\nit is and I think there's\npeople who convince themselves through\nmystical things or religious things that\nyour soul will live on or all this other\nstuff which potentially does I don't\nhave the answer to what happens after\nyou die but all I can confirm is that\nyou will die you no one has not died\neveryone has died very successfully\num and being grounded in that in knowing\nthat this experience is finite I don't\nknow it gives me a a sense of peace and\ncalm\num\nwell I think a lot of anxiety comes from\nnot knowing what will happen so you're\nlike okay what if like say if I was\nanxious about doing this podcast today\nwhat if it goes bad what if someone\nClips something out of context or blah\nblah blah and then you start rambling\noff this unknown like uber found that\nwhen they one thing they added that\nreally helped the customer process was\nshowing you how far away your car was\nbecause that unknown gave the customer\nanxiety uh and made them yeah made them\nuncomfortable uh knowing that no matter\nwhat happens you will die uh gives me a\nsense of calm knowing that like oh no\nmatter how bad things go or how good\nthings go the end result is all the same\nso have some peace in knowing that uh\nyou know the final outcome and so just\nlive your life in whichever way you\nchoose obviously try to be nice to\npeople and and give a positive light\naround you but it don't stress\nyeah I mean because I I I've talked to\nsome people who I I you know for the\nrecord I agree with you I think there's\na lot of um\neverything from like psychoanalysis and\nPsychotherapy talks about\ndealing with the fear of death\nand even in like the Eastern\nuh kind of philosophies they talk a lot\nabout how there's just a very\nfundamental fear of death in that\ngetting to peace over that fear of death\nis really how you start to live life\nfully there's a book called The Tibetan\nbook of living and dying and then we see\nthat a lot in the practice of medicine\nwhere like you've got a patient with\ncancer and they like come to terms with\nit and it doesn't necessarily mean that\nthey're gonna die like their cancer\ncould be you know put into remission or\neven curable but I've seen firsthand a\nlot of the value of like accepting that\nyou're gonna die and it can be for a lot\nof people very liberating or grounding\nit can also be very terrifying for a lot\nof people and a lot of people will panic\nbecause if I'm gonna die that means that\nlike I don't have enough time to do\neverything that I want to do yeah I\nthat's true but then I think it is\ndefinitely a motivator like I I think\nyou accept death you understand there's\nno such thing as Perfection so you kind\nof when you start to cross those two\nthings together which I'm I think a lot\nof us especially like you're in the\ncreation field people who are trying to\nmake stuff I think you can definitely\num\nget uh what's the word like get caught\nup in this perfectionist mindset where\nPerfection doesn't exist so knowing that\nyou're gonna die so you should take the\nleap towards the things you're going to\ndo because you're going to run out of\ntime uh and knowing that things can't be\nperfect and impossible for something to\nbe perfect\num a perfect example is I'm going to\ngrease in uh September for a friend's\nwedding and my sister has wanted to go\nto Greece since she was about 20 and\nshe's turning 40 this year so it's been\nlike a 20-year thing if she's like I\nwant to go to Greece supposed to go when\nshe was young and then she was supposed\nto go on her honeymoon but then she had\nkids she got like pregnant right away\nand now she's got three kids and a\nhusband and a wife and all this stuff\nand all these things are going on\nconstantly and she was like I've always\nwanted to go to Greece and I was like\njust come with me just come and she was\nlike oh I don't know if I can and I was\nlike I'll buy your plane ticket let's\njust go let's just go to Greece let's go\nto Greece together because it's like\nit's you waiting for this Perfection for\nthis moment for all the things to come\ntogether it's now 20 years as you've\nbeen putting a dream on hold it's like\njust just do things\nall the time that you want to do within\nreason don't put like you got kids don't\nput your kids at risk don't put your\nhealth at risk like I mean depending on\nwhat you consider putting at risk you\nwant to go skydiving go skydiving\num but just go do for one doing you\nlearn more in the process of doing than\nyou do in all this like sort of pre-prep\nidea of doing so like you say if I\nwanted I I'm a comedian if I spent a\nyear learning about how to write jokes\nand learning about what I got to do if I\nget on stage and talking to Comedians\nand interviewing people I would have\nlearned so much less than if I had just\nwrote Whatever I could write and then go\nto shows and do the Jewish is doing\ncomedy in that year so just go and do\nand you learn more in that process\num and knowing that you're gonna die you\ncan hopefully motivate you to go do\num but yeah so I a death is a big\nmotivator and calmer and like it just\ngrounds you in like sometimes you got to\nlike touch yourself and realize like\nthis is tactile this is real the stuff\naround me is real oh room\num and you like I don't know ages yeah\nthey're bombing\nbut check if I just go out there and do\nstuff first of all it's scary and second\nof all there are consequences\nof course what if I what if I do it\nwrong\nwell you're gonna do it wrong like I\nthink that's the the the\nacceptance in knowing though like living\nyour life in a in sort of this\nparalyzing stage of what if first you\ncan every negative argument of what if\nyou can just counter with a positive\nargument of what if you can be like oh\nwhat if I get hurt what if you don't\nlike that we're floating in the same\narea of logic where it's actually\nprobably more likely that the positive\nhappens depending on what the situation\nis but if we're talking about like I\ndon't know you're gonna go out and uh\nsign up for beer league soccer or\nsomething and you're like oh I've wanted\nto do this but I didn't like I recently\nsigned up for Muay Thai classes and\nbecause I realized I had been putting it\noff for 10 years\nsorry we have a oh no worse\nI'm I'm working can we talk about this\nin a minute\nlike in an hour\nan hour and maybe 70 minutes okay\nyou can give me your sign\ncome here okay\nthen shoe\nokay\nokay great thank you\nschool is out I love it I love it thanks\nokay thank you\nshe made the ace anyway\num yeah so you were saying uh that that\nit operates on the same level of logic\nthat there's like a positive what if for\na negative one it what if yeah and\nobviously it depends on what the\nsituation is but like like I said I\nrecently signed up for Muay Thai classes\nbecause I did the same thing of waiting\nfor this perfect moment I've been\nputting off going to Muay Thai for 10\nyears I've wanted to do it for that long\num I boxed when I was younger I've\nalways had a Fascination and admiration\nfor fight Sports I never I don't even\nthink I'll ever Spar\num I but I like learning I like learning\nwhile I exercise I think martial arts\nare an incredible skill to have it's\nlike a skill you can use naked which is\nlike not a lot of skills are like that\num but uh I've been putting it off for\n10 years and there's all those things\nthat were going on my head it's like oh\nwhat if I don't have enough time what if\nI can't get it in what if blue blah blue\nblue there was all these what ifs and I\nwas like just go just go to the class\njust go sign up and just do the class\nand then just take it from there and\nthen it fit into my schedule I figured\nout where it fit now that I was doing it\nget better in the class when I can show\nup when everything worked everything\nworked with this thing I was putting off\nfor 10 years for a perfect moment I got\nto fit into my life in probably about a\nmonth and that's a month of going like\nonce a week and now I go like two or\nthree times a week\num and I when I can't go I don't go but\nI'm doing the thing that I've wanted to\ndo for a long time yeah so so Jay I mean\njust to kind of I get what you're saying\nbut like\nhow are you able to do that\nhow I I think just you just go and do it\nand you accept that failure is you will\nfail at not at everything but you will\nlike even this class or sometimes I fail\nto show up or I fail to schedule them\nproperly or I fail to give my best or\neven focus properly in class you you you\nwill fail and accepting that that is\njust like death inevitable that\nPerfection doesn't exist that failure is\nabsolutely absolutely going to happen as\nlong as I mean I guess you could avoid\nfailure by doing nothing if you lived in\nlike a padded room but you would\nprobably still fail at something within\nthe confines of that room\num you'd fail at life dude yeah he found\na life there you go\nuh so accepting that the those things\nare part of your reality gives you this\nfreedom and it's also like what are you\ntrying to attain are you trying to be\nlike the richest person in the world are\nyou trying to be like the best Muay Thai\nfight in the world the Best comedian in\nthe world like are you trying to chase\nsomething are you just trying to\nexperience pieces of life\num like there's certain parts of my life\nwhere I'm trying to Excel and there's\ncertain parts of my life where I just\nlike to partake and taste uh and enjoy\nlike if I go to a restaurant I'm not\ntrying to aerate to the wine and the\nfood to get this certain experience from\nit I'm just well I just like food I like\neating and I'm sitting and eating and\nhanging with friends and we're talking\nand shooting the and and the whole\nmoment is is good\nuh\nyeah I think it's it's fast so just uh\nit's interesting to hear you kind of\ntalk about this stuff because I've had a\ncouple of cases where\nI've worked with people who\num\nwe've seen some interesting consequences\nof challenging their fear of death so\nthe one really bizarre thing is that a\nlot of people struggle with\nprocrastination yes and one thing that I\nfound is that like in 20 to 25 percent\nof people that I work with who have a\nfear of death\nmost of them are actually pretty\nsuccessful to begin with but if you can\nconquer your fear of death\nprocrastination actually disappears\nand what happens in these people is like\nif you're kind of procrastinating right\nyou're waiting for the right time and in\ntheir mind they sort of have this\ninfinite amount of time\nthe passage of time is really painful\nthey can feel every day that they lose\nthey can feel every year that they lose\nthey can feel every five years that they\nlose but they don't really think about\nhow much time they have left yes and\nonce you realize that like this game\nends in a certain amount of time it can\nbe incredibly transformative because\nthen like what are you gonna do today if\nyou want to attain this thing like you\ncan wait for the perfect moment and then\nit may or may not happen you can spend\n10 years waiting for it you can spend 10\nyears planning for it getting ready for\nit prepping for it researching for it\nbut you're never going to do it and once\nyou sort of realize that okay like the\ntime and The Hourglass is running out\nand whether I do it or don't do it the\ntime gets spent either way\nand oftentimes what happens with people\nwho procrastinate is they're looking for\na good deal right that's what Perfection\nis like I want to set everything up so\nwhen I do it I'm successful so that my\ninvestment yields a good return yes\nonce you understand that you're gonna\ndie\nthat cost is being spent like over and\nover and over again like you're losing\nthat time no matter what you decide to\ndo so the question is what do you want\nto do today do you want to\nthat time is gone\ndisappearing\nand and so sometimes what people will do\nis they'll like sort of realize oh crap\nlike I have to like start living today\neven if it is not the way that I want or\nand I really love this what you said\nearlier about are you trying to attain\nor are you trying to experience\nyeah and I think I think both are are\nvalid forms of of experience life\nexperiencing life but there are\nuh I know there are certain moments\nwhere I think you gotta like step back\nand just experience like I think we do\nthe like what you're saying about oh I'm\nwaiting for this perfect moment there's\nthis I think we're taught this idea of\nlike retirement and and uh we're gonna\nbuild for a better tomorrow and all\nthese things instead of just cashing in\na little bit right now because tomorrow\nis never uh guaranteed like my like I\nwatched my dad my dad was a very good\nexample of this was my dad worked super\nhard worked two jobs for a long time my\nparents kind of grinded themselves to\ndust they were like kind of lower income\nfamily and then moved into like a middle\nincome family\num but they they sacrificed a lot to\nmake sure that we had some stuff and\ntheir marriage was always Rocky and it\nwas a lot of things of trying to fit\ninto the slots of like standard uh uh\nlike Suburban lifestyle uh and then when\nmy parents when I got older I got in I\nwas thinking like 20 my parents got\ndivorced and then it felt like uh my dad\nkind of moved on and started Living his\nlife the way he wanted to he was\ntraveling a lot more he was kind of\ndoing whatever he wanted he was retired\nhe met a new lady all these things and\nhe did that for about four years and\nthen he got Alzheimer's and he got\nAlzheimer's from uh sleepless nights of\nworking constant like graveyard shifts\nand stuff it was a it's we don't have a\ndirect correlation with that but the\ntype of Alzheimer's he has is\nnon-genetic and is exacerbated from lack\nof sleep\num so he said he sacrificed all these\nthings to live in this idea of what he\nthought he was supposed to live in for a\nbetter tomorrow and then when he got the\nopportunity to have it he had a few\nyears in there and then lost the ability\nto live that better moral so it's like\ncapture these things now a little bit\nmore uh and experience these parts of\nlife now a little bit more and don't get\ncaught up too much in this like work now\nsave for later lifestyle because you\nmight not get the later and also you\nwanna even if you are older and you live\ninto your late years like you want it\nwhen you're in your younger years you\nwant to be out with your friends and\ndoing stuff and trying to drink in as\nmuch as you can because those\nexperiences are good and they don't\nnecessarily have to cost you a lot\nthey're me and my\num me and my buddies go up to a friend's\nCottage and there's like you know last\ntime I went up there was like 10 of us\nwe're all comedians we would like do\nmushrooms and go on Hikes and just like\nlaugh harder than I've ever laughed\nbefore and one of my buddies the guy who\nwhose Cottage it is and this isn't like\na fancy Cottage this is a place where\nwe'd have to jump on a bicycle and then\nride down next to the lake because there\nwas a toilet down there we use the\ntoilet there because the toilet was\nbusted in the cottage\num but one of my buddies was like this\nis what I live for these moments and\nhe's 100 right the like the amount of\nfun and joy we had in like that four to\neight period\nis it is bigger than a lot of any of the\nother\nexperiences that I've had\nso and if you get super rich and super\nsuccessful and then you're doing that on\na yacht rather than a cottage where the\ntoilet doesn't work it doesn't matter\nthe people and the experience are the\nsame and you're going to get the same\nenjoyment out of it so try and focus on\nthose experiences and having those\nmoments because one day you will not be\nable to\nso I trade that's fascinating can I ask\nso it sounds like you're you said your\nparents got divorced when you were 20\nyeah yeah so they yeah sorry go ahead go\nahead no go for it no I was just gonna\nsay they had they were they were uh yeah\ntogether for like 30 years or so but it\nwas not uh I I think at the start it was\ngood and then the financial things were\nalways a burden uh and I think that it\njust uh slowly crumbled apart and they\ndefinitely did this stay together for\nthe kids\nokay and and when would you say that you\nyou like sort of found that grounding\nwith fear of death\noh I think\nit probably would have been\nit was definitely before I moved to New\nYork I haven't been here for very long\nbut I would say like five six years ago\nI think uh\nI really came to terms with like oh what\nI was doing I didn't\nit it didn't like staving for the future\nsaving for not that I don't save I'm\nvery smart with my money I'm not telling\npeople who are watching this hey just\nspend all your money willy-nilly but\nfocusing on the enjoyment side of life\nrather than pushing myself into an area\nwhere I don't enjoy myself to save for\nsomething that may not even exist uh\nyeah I think it was through doing\nstand-up and stuff and kind of\nself-discovery through that probably\nfive or six years ago was probably when\nI came to terms with it and how many\nyears ago was your dad diagnosed with\nAlzheimer's I wanna say four could have\nbeen five years ago there's definitely a\ncorrelation between those two because\nlike watching him not get the\nopportunity to live his life was like oh\nwell I'm not going to make the same\nmistake for sure\nyeah I mean I was just like surprised by\nhow you know that that seems like\nthat seems significant to me oh oh\nabsolutely and it's like it was it was\nkind of a weird experience because I\nbecause there was very much a division\nin my house my parents weren't very\nclose and they were fighting and then so\nI distanced myself from them so I felt\nlike I never really was close to either\nof them and then kind of started\nbuilding a relationship with my dad but\nthen he got Alzheimer's so then it was\nlike we didn't couldn't really\ncommunicate or anything anymore\num so it was a weird sense but I\ndefinitely saw the process of how this\nstuff happened and I was like I don't\nwant to make that same mistake I really\nwant to take the time to enjoy and live\nmy life this trip to Greece is another\nexample not just for my sister but for\nmyself I almost didn't go I almost was\nlike oh you know I'm gonna have to take\nso much time off work blah blah blah all\nthe things you tell yourself I was like\njust go to Greece and then I booked an\nextra week to go to Berlin on my own and\nthen it like I've never been to Europe\nlet's go see a few different things\num because yeah because I'm like oh when\nwill I get this opportunity again and\nhow long am I going to put this\nopportunity off for\nyeah I mean that's interesting because I\nI you know some people I've worked with\nChe when they haven't experience like\nyours they like you seem to have\npivoted hard towards like living life\nand loving it\nyou know sometimes when I work with\npeople what I see is they they kind of\nget crushed by it like it's sort of like\nokay I'm just getting to know my dad\nyou know I'm starting to build a\nrelationship and like he's kind of taken\naway from me and then they're they sort\nof like enter into this like paranoid\nzone of like you know like it feels like\npillars in my life can be like just\ntaken away from me and if if anything\ncan get can disappear at any time\nhow do I find any kind of stability how\ndo I because I I don't want to make the\nsame mistake right so it's kind of weird\nlike you're saying I don't want to make\nthe same mistake so I'm going to YOLO it\nand some people are like I don't want to\nmake the same mistake so I can't ever\nYOLO it like I've got to be sure because\nI can't afford to make the mistake I\nthink\num I think I've always been a very\nrational person I've always been very\nlike grounded in reality\num two plus two equals four like always\nin\nall of my is I remember one of the\nearliest\nnot one of my earliest memories but oh\nmy earliest example of this I think was\nmaybe five or six I used to suck my\nindex finger I'll check my index finger\nand play with my ear this was like a\ncomfort thing I did\num and I was doing it so much it was\nlike pushing my teeth forward and my\nparents were like oh they would put hot\nsauce on my finger these different\nthings to try and get me to stop and\nnothing would get me to stop the thing\nthat got me to stop was they told me\nthey're like you're gonna get braces and\nI was like okay I don't care they're\nlike you know people might make fun of\nyou if you get braces I was like I don't\ncare they're like it's gonna hurt I said\nI don't care they said it's gonna cost\nthree thousand dollars and I was like oh\nthat's a lot of money and then I stopped\nthat was the the rational grounding of\nlike it's gonna cost money that's like I\nunderstood that my my parents always\nmoney was a big thing growing up so I\nknew that was going to be a big deal\nthat's what made me stop I've always\nbeen very very rational\nso I I guess I don't know if this is\nhealthy or unhealthy but I saw what I\nwas losing I saw that I didn't have as\nclose of a relationship with either of\nmy parents and as upsetting as that is\nand I I thought I was gonna have this\nopportunity like I remember my dad came\nto visit me when I was in Toronto and\nthis is before this is a few years\nbefore I got diagnosed we had like a\nweek together where we were like going\nout eating hanging out\nand when my family was all together\nthere was definitely it was everything\nwas very disingenuous\num uh and my mom isn't the most like\ntrustworthy person she's a little bit of\na liar and a little bit of a manipulator\nand so there's this like weird\num\noh like I guess there was like a weird\nhierarchy in the family no one was no\none felt like they were being honest\nwith each other and everyone felt like\nthey were walking on eggshells uh with\nall interactions so then now that this\nwas all removed I felt like my Dad we\nhad like an honest week with each other\nwhere we honestly talked to each other's\ntwo people getting really getting to\nknow each other\num and then he caught Alzheimer's not\nlong after that but that was like we had\nthat week together uh and then he\ndefinitely started to go before then and\ncommunication was not the same and then\nyou got diagnosed with Alzheimer's so I\nit would have been nice to have that\ntime I felt like I was going into this\nnext stage of my life where I was going\nto get to know my dad as an authentic\nperson who's gonna get to know me as an\nauthentic person but I didn't have that\nand I also didn't lose it because it was\nnever there\num so I just had to come to terms with\nit I just had to come to terms with that\nwas that's reality what's it like having\na mom who's a little bit of a liar\nuh it's another one of those things man\nyou uh I there was a long time where I\nwas very angry about it\num uh uh the thing she said the the like\nthe relationship we had I didn't I\nhaven't talked to her in years and years\nand years it's a relationship I cut out\nbecause I felt like it just didn't\nbenefit me in any way bringing if I was\nto bring her back into my life it would\nI think it would be a detriment to My\nLife\num so it was another thing I just had to\naccept that that relationship doesn't\nexist but I have close friends I have\nclose brothers and sisters and I have\nthese people where I can have these\ngrowth conversations I can uh I can ask\nthem questions I if I need help in in\ncertain areas I have a good support\ncircle around me is it okay if I we we I\nask you a couple questions about that of\ncourse so because here's what I'm\nthinking I think that unfortunately not\nall mothers are great not all mothers\nare even good\num and the challenges that oftentimes\nit's hard to tell or hard to accept when\nyou're in that situation and I imagine\nthere may be people who are listening to\nthis conversation right now who are in\nsituations with like a toxic parent and\nthey may not even realize it yeah um\nbecause oftentimes what toxic parents\nwill do is\nthey trick children into thinking that\nthe child is the problem like that's how\nthey function\num and as long as you have a child to\nblame then as a parent you don't have to\ntake responsibility yes and then the\nchild is put in this situation where\nthey're bearing all the blame and so\nthey never even think\noh I need to actually like remove this\nperson from my life for set kind of\nboundaries because I'm actually the one\nthat's the problem I need to fix things\nbut that they go on trying to fix the\nwrong part of the equation but that's\npartisan busted so they end up\ninevitably failing over and over and\nover again\nthey fail over and over and over again\nthe problems still continue so they try\nharder and it just creates this vicious\ncycle yeah so what did it I mean how did\nyou discover that your mom was a liar\num I think for me I when I was 18 I\nmoved out and I moved to the coast I\nlived I grew up in British Columbia like\nmaybe uh hour outside of Vancouver\num and so I moved to the coast and I\nlived there I was going to college out\nthere and so I got to have like time\naway and grow and be my own person I\nthink that's very important for people\nto like kind of leave their Hometown\nbecause I think you can be very\ndisingenuous in high school because\nthat's what high school's about high\nschool is kind of about informing\num to fit in so I got to go and be my\nown person and then I moved to Mexico\nfor a little while uh and I was uh\nliving up there for three years I got to\ngrow and be my own person so I had like\na physical separation and got to do a\nlot of self-exploration and\num through that came to terms with that\na lot of the things they said weren't\ntrue I could see as you grow as a person\nyou can see the inconsistencies in the\nstories they told how they would talk\nfrom person to person see how they would\nlie to other other people\num and see how they would treat you in\nfront of people and but treat you in\nprivate\num and the then you can come to terms\nwith\nbeing in control of the situation and\nknowing that this person is like that\nand you don't have to\nuh you don't have to carry their baggage\nlike this person like you were saying\nthey would blame you for things that's\nlike oh that's not mine I don't need to\nhold on to that uh I can let that go and\nthey're gonna choose to be whoever\nthey're going to be and I don't need to\nchange them I think a big part of it was\nme trying to fix these things and\nrealizing that I'm the youngest in the\nfamily like I uh I for a while I felt\nlike I should have mended something\nbetween my parents or there was like two\nsides of the family try to amend\nsomething there uh and realizing that\nI'm the youngest and being like Oh no\nall these people should be more mature\nand able to deal with this more than I\nam I'm not carrying any of this you guys\ngo deal with it if you want to be\nfriends be friends if you don't you\ndon't I do not care and I'm going to\nhold on to the relationships that I feel\nbenefit me better or at least benefit\nboth sides and this one clearly does not\nand having the separation from that\nperson lets you sort of uh unravel all\nthe things that happened\num what kind of two-facedness did you\nsee from your mom like can you give us\nan example\num yeah a great example uh would be like\nthere was a family member who was sick\nuh on my uh like is someone who is on my\nsister's side uh so I have like a split\ndown the family where her brother and\nsister on one side and a sister on the\nother side so my sister on one side a\nfamily member was sick and my brother\nand sister on the other side from my\ndad's side we're gonna go visit my mom\ntold them no don't visit she doesn't\nwant visitors but they and that family\nmember was sick had a separate\nrelationship with my brother and sister\nand found out later that this person\nnever said that that they that my mom\nhad made this up to keep a division\nthrough in the family which is that's a\nvery\nhey it's yeah you're just lying and and\nmoving chess pieces around for whatever\nreason uh and uh yeah that it was stuff\nlike that where you just you just\nlearned that you can't trust a person\nand so there's no point in like kind of\nkeeping them around\nwow\num so\nlet me let me kind of recap sort of what\nI heard and and I think this is actually\ngreat so the first thing is\nhow do you know\nif you're in a relationship with someone\nlike parent or otherwise where\nit is kind of like toxic and you're like\nbeing taken advantage of\nso I think a big part of it is if you\nfeel like a chess piece because I think\neven people who don't want to admit that\ntheir parent is a problem like they feel\nlike a chess piece you kind of feel like\nthe sort of situation where like okay\nI'm a pawn and I'm being like thrust\ninto battle\nand I'm supposed to like someone is\nsending me into battle to like take out\nthe enemy Queen\nyeah Rook but I'm just outgunned and I\nlike I'm I'm doomed to fail I'm set up\nto fail and then what they do is they're\nlike Pawn like I sent you in\nthere to do a job\nand you can't even do that job and then\nyou feel responsible right because\nyou're the one who's actually on the\nfront lines yes\nand then what happens is like you're\nkind of left in this situation where\nthey're placing the responsibility on\nyou but they're not giving you the\nfreedom or the control to actually try\nto solve the problem because I'm also\nkind of noticing that your your mom kind\nof set you up in a lot of ways where she\ndidn't say like\nyou know she didn't let you fly free\nyeah\num I I think it's really interesting\nthat you actually started\nwhen I asked you how did you know that\nshe was a liar you actually started with\nphysical distance\nyes which I think is something that is\nunderrated\nso a lot of times especially nowadays\nwith the internet if someone is in a\ntoxic relationship they think that the\nanswer is something that they can do or\nthey can learn I mean hell I mean our\nchannel is successful because people try\nto come to us for answers for their\nproblems yes I think the real tragedy is\nthat sometimes like it actually starts\nwith physical distance\nand if you look at research on trauma\nthe the person who originally developed\nI don't know if you're familiar with\nlike complex PTSD like this term or\nconcept no no so the you know PTSD is\nlike a\nas post-traumatic stress disorder it's\nusually induced by one event so like you\nknow I was either assaulted or I was\nlike you know I had a bad I was in war\nor something and there was like a really\nbad Mission or something like that\nbut there's another flavor of PTSD which\nis called complex PTSD which is when the\ntrauma is chronic so these are like\npeople who\num are in like concentration camps\npeople who are prisoners of War people\nwho are an abusive relationships like\nwith parents growing up\nand the really interesting thing is that\nin order to heal from that the first\nthing you need is like safety and space\nso a lot of times I see people that are\nstruggling to like fix their problems\nlike in their four walls\nbut what I think is really interesting\nis that physically getting space seemed\nto be like the first step for you\noh yeah absolutely I feel like that\nphysical space it gives you the freedom\nto think and move without this person\nyou're not turning to this person for\nadvice anymore uh because obviously\nthey're going to give you their skewed\nview uh and you build relationships\noutside of people who know them and and\nthat's a like a great way to know if\nsomeone is toxic it's like when you have\nthe relationships outside of that person\nyou can compare the relationships you\ncan be like okay this I have this friend\nover here and when I hang out with them\nI have fun and they don't ask me for\nthings or need me to do stuff for them\nthey don't try to like put me in\ncompromising situations and then I have\na friend over here and when I do when I\nleave these interactions I often feel\nbad or less than and I they make me feel\nguilty for things and they yeah all they\nImplement these negative emotions on me\nso when you can start to compare and\ncontrast to things side by side you can\nstart to see that one is clearly better\nthan the other and the and the one\nthat's bad is using a lot of weird\ntendencies that the other people around\nyou aren't using and that it helps you\nunderstand uh have a understanding of\nwhat is right and wrong in a\nrelationship with someone\nyeah and I think it's it's interesting\nbecause you kind of said that so what\nyou're describing almost sounds like a\ncult of one\nyeah you're like you're like in a cult\nbut there's just like one member and\nit's you and then there's the leader\nyeah and they're imposing a lot of this\nlike you know almost like brainwashing\nor like manipulation like controlling\nyour relationships like inducing\nemotions in you like guilt\nand and I think it's really interesting\nhow the way that you saw that was\nnoticing the inconsistencies from the\noutside does this person like\nsay things in weird ways do they try to\ngatekeep information do they try to keep\nyou from like talking directly to other\npeople\num it feels very cultish actually\nand then the last thing that I think is\nreally really important is that a lot of\ntimes even if people can recognize that\nthis is toxic and even if they can get\naway one of the things I've noticed is\nthat they carry the responsibility with\nthem yeah and so I've had tons of\npatients who will every time they go\nhome for the holidays it's like it's a\nmess but they feel obligated and they\nfeel guilty and they're like okay I\ngotta take my like bitter medicine you\nknow I can build my life but for two\nweeks out of the year I gotta go back\nand and go back into this and one thing\nthat I think is really cool is that I\nthink you're a quitter\nyeah right and part of the problem is in\nin today's society we actually think\nabout being a quitter is a bad thing\nbut I think some of the the most\ninteresting things quitting a\nrelationship is one of the healthiest\nand best things you can do\nyes and I would say that quitting the\nwrong relationship has a greater impact\nin your life than finding the right one\nyes and just being able to say like hey\nyou know what I'm not responsible for\nthis I quit I'm done yes you can sort of\nfigure out your own yes I think\nthat's uh like taking things and putting\nthem back on your terms like when I come\nto visit now I don't necessarily come I\ncame home for Christmas this past year\nfor the first time in like 10 years and\nI was like I don't know if I'm gonna do\nthis again not because the actual\nChristmas experience was bad but just\nbecause they're traveling around\nChristmas time sucks but I I took\ntraveling and going home and made it my\nown for a while was like I'm coming in\nthe summertime when it's nice out when\nyou do outdoor activities when I want to\nbe there and if I'm not there for\nChristmas or something that's it\nI'm doing that for you constantly and\nI've done things for you guys for so\nmuch so now I'm going to do things for\nmyself and we can make things\nequal\num but I'm not going to compromise so\nfar that I I I'm not having a good time\nwith everyone else's\nI'm curious has that affected your\num is it okay if I ask you like a couple\nquestions about romantic relationships\noh for sure\num has that affected your romantic\nrelationships at all so to be completely\ntransparent on romantic relationships\nI've only dated\nmaybe like two girls seriously uh and\neach time the relationships haven't last\nvery long I'm usually once I get about\nsix months in I'm like uh I don't know\nif I want to date anymore I\nam in definitely a mental space where I\ndon't know\num what I want I'm definitely super work\nfocused so I've up until just about\nrecently like this year I was like maybe\nI put effort into cultivating like a\nproper relationship again because\neverything has been work focused and\nthat's been like\nI've seen relationships as sort of\ndetrimental to me working harder where\nnow I don't as much but I also uh am\ntrying to come to terms whether or not\nI'm like am I would I be happier in like\nan open relationship or do I want a\nmonogamous relationship or like what are\nthe standards that uh\nlike what I know what the standards are\nof what people will think we should do\nlike you're supposed to meet someone\nfall in love get married and like the\nwhite pick a fence or whatever but I'm\nlike is that because that's\nwhat we're genetically made to do or is\nthat uh like subconscious programming in\nquotations like there's all these social\nnorms that are kind of falling apart\nbefore us and being rebuilt in different\nways and I don't know where I fit in\nthere and so now I'm interested in\nexploring those things again to see what\nI want but yeah romantically I haven't\never really pursued anyone and I think\ndefinitely my parents having a rocky\nrelationship for so long I when I was\nyounger I just assumed that\nrelationships failed like if I was in my\n20s uh definitely like all my\nrelationships were like my early to mid\n20s every person I dated that my\nmentality was like well this is going to\nend eventually like this is there were\nin our 20s like we're not going to meet\nsomeone we're going to be with for the\nrest of our life like that's just that\nseemed completely irrational to me\nbecause I saw older people taking a shot\nat it and them failing miserably so what\nchance do we have this is more just for\nfun\nokay interesting so it sounds like it's\nsomething you're thinking through\ntrying to figure out what's what's right\nfor you I also notice your\nbeing quite analytical about it in terms\nof okay like the world has changed so\neven if there was a formula that\narguably worked\nwhich\nI I think\nyou know we know that monogamy has been\nhas not been um\nit works for some works for it doesn't\nwork for other it's like it's yeah I\nthink it it and that I'm trying to\nfigure out where I fit in that like do I\nwant to be monogamous do I not want to\nbe monogamous like and then there's all\nthe other things of like you're jealousy\nyour emotions you're that get that come\ninto play and and really feeling that\nout and not rushing into anything\nbecause I feel like I have a lot of time\nwith this and spending the time to\nfigure out what I want\num yeah I think\nreally focusing on how I feel through\neach situation is like a great recipe\nand communicating that to whoever I'm\nwith is a great recipe for being\nsuccessful\num so you mentioned\nI may need it\nI just love the kids\nsure\ngo for it\num so uh a couple other things so you\nmentioned that you're focused on Craft\nright now can you just tell us a little\nbit about like what it's like to be a\ncomedian and and\nhow you view your craft what it takes to\nsucceed\nyeah\num for Comics It's Like Comics are a\ndifferent breed for sure uh it's\nsomething I you that you don't really\nget it until you're in I think any like\nif you get really serious and to\nCrossFit uh then the people you hang out\nwith the way you look at the world like\nif you go out to eat you look at the\nmenu differently than someone who's not\nvery focused on their Gallery intake\nevery day like it it becomes who you are\nas a person and that potentially was who\nyou are were all along comedy is very\nsimilar whereas like you're you're\nconstantly joking about stuff riffing\nabout stuff everything for the most part\neverything is on the table when you sit\ndown with Comics very rarely do we go\nlike oh uh how's the weather or so it\nwas hot today you try you go like right\nto this I was serious isn't the right\nword it's just like we want to talk\nabout real tangible things and have more\nintimate conversations with people\nbecause we divulge our personal on\nstage in front of strangers so\npeer-to-peer it's like yeah that we know\nwe can talk like that and it sometimes\nwhen you're in conversations with people\nwho uh can't do that it can be a little\nunderstimulating one thing about going\nlike family get-togethers is there's\nthere's always this thing and this is\njust I think this is just a good\netiquette but you sometimes when you're\nhanging out with a bunch of people and\nfamily like the conversations stay very\ngray like all the we're putting the kids\nin this no one gets too political no one\ngets too uh too deep into any topics\nbecause no one wants to get anyone\nuncomfortable or comedy it's the exact\nopposite we can argue and talk about\ndifferent things and everyone's on the\nsame page because whether or not we\nagree because that is what we do\num so that's my one of the best parts\nabout the craft is like the Hang but\nthen in terms of of creating and doing\nit it's like you try and write every day\nat least this is my process you try and\nwrite every day you try and get on stage\nI try to do 10 to uh 20 times a week you\nwant to be getting up and trying out\nyour stuff working on stuff taking it to\nnew rooms uh evolving as the platform\nevolves so like uh everyone's doing like\ncrowd work clips now so I make sure I do\na bunch of crowd work when I'm going on\nthe road so I have stuff to clip out and\nkeep the social media and all those\nplatforms going social is a big side of\nit podcasting's a big side of it now\num so understanding how to learn and use\nthese new skills as the landscape\ndevelops and changes\num while constantly trying to get\nfunnier and funnier and funnier and I\nthink depending on what kind of comedian\nyou are you value things at different\nstages like some people have Ultra\nsuccessful podcasts and live they're not\nas good I'm not naming any names or talk\nabout any specific is just something\nthat happened it's like if the podcast\nis by far you're sorry just the sounds\nof New York City right now\nI can barely hear anything oh you can't\nokay great great\num\nbut uh uh yeah like if you if you value\nthe podcast super practice your main\nincome bringer then maybe your live\nstuff isn't as good\num but their podcasting could be\nincredible uh but I think for myself the\ncore has always been stand up first I\nwant the live performance I want people\nto watch my online content go oh this is\ngreat I love this then come to the live\nshow and be like yo this is incredible\nthis is the this is the best because\nthat's the thing I've been doing for the\nlongest and crafting the most I really\nwant\nat the end of this whole stand-up\njourney to be considered one of the\ngreat stand-up comics uh and all the\nother things that kind of come around it\nare just uh beneficial to my standard\ncareer beings so potent so how how many\nhours so you say you try to write every\nday you try to get on stage every day\nyes what does writing look like for you\num so my writing process is like a\nlittle chaotic I don't think a lot of\npeople write like this but I will uh\nopen uh I have this folder on my phone\nboth in Tick Tock and in Instagram\ncalled the best and in the best folder\nare like a bunch of videos and memes and\nstuff that have made me laugh I'll set a\ntimer for 10 minutes and I'll sit there\nand I'll watch those for 10 minutes\num because that gets me in a state where\nI'm laughing and having a good time and\nthen when I'm in that like really happy\njovial state of like laughing out loud I\nthen switch over to writing and then\nI'll write for an hour and so I'll set a\ntime for an hour turn my phone on\nairplane mode and it's literally me like\nI'll have some ideas written down and\nI'll look at like okay like right now\nI'm trying to work on a joke about\nGenghis Khan so pull up the Genghis Khan\njoke in my phone and then walk around my\napartment talking out loud to myself\nlike all this and like I'm actually on\nstage on the tone and mannerisms and\neverything so I'm like embody seeing\nwhat I do and then when something hits\nwhen I start making myself laugh with\nwhat I'm coming up with in jokes then\nyou go back to the phone write that\nstuff down quickly and then try to\nspringboard off of that and keep that\ngoing for as long as possible\num that's my whole writing process\nhow long does it take you to come up\nwith a joke on average oh it's so hit\nand miss man sometimes you get a joke\nthat like\nyou come up with something and then you\ntry it out and then it doesn't work but\nlike maybe like 50 30 to 50 work so you\nlike take it back to the drawing board\nand you Tinker it my favorite part of\nstand up is the tinkering like okay this\ndidn't work with this and this works so\nthen you take those parts that didn't\nwork and you go through the same process\nwatch the funny stuff right for an hour\ngo back tinker tinker tinker do that\nagain do that again do it again and\nuntil you have multiple pieces that work\nthe best feeling and stand up for me is\nwhen you have like a new 10 minutes that\nis kind that has some moments and other\nparts are rough and other parts are good\nand it's like up and down and you spend\nlike however long sometimes it could be\ntwo weeks sometimes it could be a month\nand you're tinkering each part and maybe\nyou take out a joke this doesn't work\nand you put in another joke and it works\nuh and then you have then the whole 10\nminutes like congeals and comes together\nand every bit's working and then you\nhave probably about a week straight\nmaybe four days where you can do that\nset over and over and over and you have\nno guilt because it's newly working so\nyou still got to try it in its in its\nultimate form and it kills and then once\nyou do it for too long you start to feel\nguilty for doing jokes that you know\nthat work and you're not working\nanything new and you have to go back to\nthe stuff that is Rocky and start having\nrockier sets again and build up\num so how the back to the original\nquestion of how long it takes to write a\njoke it's completely\nrandom sometimes the first time you say\nsomething it's funny from day one some\njokes I've had jokes that have taken\nlike six months because you work on them\nfor a bit they're going nowhere and I\ncall it putting it on ice you put a joke\non Ice you stop working on you stop\nperforming it and then sometimes when\nI'm stuck in my writing I'll scroll back\nin my phone to see what are the old\nnotes of stuff I was working on you oh\nthis idea you pull it out again because\nthat once you haven't looked at\nsomething for a few months you forgot\nwhat direction you were trying to shove\nthe joke in so then you have an open\nmind of where you could potentially take\nthe premise and then you can and then\nsometimes the you had a base that was\ngood but the rest built on top of it\nwasn't good now you've scrapped the top\nand now you're building on it again and\nit builds in a great Direction and then\nmaybe stops at a certain point and then\nyou go through that process again this\nis very involved\nyo yeah you live and breathe and are a\npart of your jokes they're like an\nextension of yourself and your opinions\nand your ideas and your thought process\nand what you find funny the and this is\nstandard like most comedians will work\nthis hard I don't know if most will work\nthis hard I think a lot I think anyone\nwho you see who you think is funny and\nhas like if you watch someone and they\ncan make you laugh repeatedly on stage\nfor an hour I would think yes I don't\nknow if they would describe it in the\nsame way\num I don't necessarily always have the\nwe talk about comedy a lot but the you\ndon't want to get too self-indulgent\nwith your uh process with other Comics\num because it can kind of sound like\nyou're up your own butt uh\nbut it is like it you you're living and\nbreathing and feeding yourself off of\nyour ideas just your ideas literally\njust talking or you're nothing's even\ntaxed out I don't have to like build a\nthing and then sell it like I have to\nsell you reacting how you have a an\ninternal involuntary laughter response\nto what I thought of in my head and said\nto you and that is a very intimate\nconnection to something\num\nyeah and that's just the that's the\nprocess over and over and over again and\nI think there's a lot of self-discovery\nin that because in at least for me to\nget better at this I remember when I\nswitched from basically writing like\ncall and response jokes I would say the\nfirst like six or seven years of me\ndoing stand-up was all call and response\nlike I know I I say this to an audience\nthey laugh and I can repeat that process\nover and over again\num at like yeah like the seven year mark\nI started writing material that I\nhonestly found funny that I I could now\ntake what I found funny and translate\nthat to a crowd like sometimes you'll\nsee newer Comics try something really\nedgy and they'll be like oh you can't\nhandle this because the audience\nresponds poorly and what it is it's like\nno you haven't done the work to\ntranslate your sense of humor to the\naudience and your sense of humor you\nknow is it sorry hilarious about that is\nthat's also what therapists do so\ntherapists like say something and it\ndoesn't sit well with a patient they're\nlike oh you can't handle it yeah that's\nthat's not and they don't do the work of\ntranslating or even workshopping their\nideas they're just convinced that the\npatient is in denial it's your job to\nmake that person accept it or lack to it\nor take the the like the work that\nyou're giving them to better themselves\nthat is your job as the therapist or as\nthe Entertainer it's not the audience\njob to eat whatever slop you throw at\nthem\num like they bought tickets they spent\nmoney some of the therapists that I've\nknown are like that though they're like\nyeah no like if you're not enjoying the\nslop it's like a problem on your end\nyeah it's like no no no you're\nespecially you're supposed to you're\nsupposed to help this person grow and\nand the way the way for them to grow is\nto understand that I'm right okay\nright uh and but we I you see a lot of\ncomics struggle with that and it's like\nthey haven't done the work to you know\nmake that translation hearing you do\nthis I I'm very tempted to try stand up\nmyself\ngive it a shot I just because I thought\nit was I mean I knew I know it's hard\nobviously because it's not you know it's\ngot to be hard but I'm I I wanna I wanna\nget destroyed on stage just once\nI see what it's like audiences now are\npretty Savvy and pretty generous and it\ndepends on where you go some places are\nlike way less forgiving\num but for the most part if you go out\nand you do a show and you write your\nfive minutes and you go out and try it\nout you'll only be destroyed by like\ndeafening silence if it goes really\npoorly but definitely in the context of\na show where it's like these Comics are\ndoing are new and they're trying it out\nfor the first few times you get a lot\nmore of a generous crowd which can be\ngreat it's a great motivator\num but I always encourage everyone who\nwants to try to try it there's no\nbarrier to entry it literally if you can\nwrite words down on a piece of paper and\nspeak into a microphone and some people\ncan't even do that perfectly and they're\nstill very very successful comedians\num and then you should give it a shot if\nyou don't like it then anyone who is\ndoing stand-up I know some people who\nare like doing it because they think\nit'll turn into something which maybe it\nwill but they don't enjoy doing it I\ncan't imagine a worse hell because a lot\nof it sucks a lot of it it's like you're\nin stinky bars around surly's uh around\nlike surly's like uh you're at a bar and\nthere's like drunk surveys like bar\nflies\num like they're Surly like yeah yeah\nlike grumpy old dudes who like go to a\nplace and drink for that's their thing\num and you you have to like enjoy that\nwhole process before it starts to get\nlike a little bit more Glitz and Glam\nand then even when it gets Glitz and\nGlam there's a lot of grinding and\nflying and\ntaking pictures for hours with people\num which I enjoyed this entire process\nand if I didn't that would be hell on\nEarth\nwow yeah so you know it's interesting\nbecause you talk about how hard it is\nand I'm kind of like so I'm a little bit\nskeptical isn't the right word I think\nyou're you're very authentic but I just\ndon't think a lot of what you talk about\ntranslates to normal human beings\nno I think\num a people a lot of people describe me\nas like their inside voice like I say\nthings that people think and that's not\nmy intention I'll be like Oh I'm saying\nwhat no one else will and that's not\nwhat I'm doing at all I'm very honest\nabout my opinions about certain things\nno I mean but that that's kind of what\nI'm talking about like it's not the\nopinions themselves it's like so so like\nas a kid your parents are like\nchildren will make fun of you unless you\nstop\nsucking on your finger yeah and you're\nlike eh\nyeah\nit'll hurt it'll mess up your teeth\nyou're like eh\nyeah right and then and you're talking\nabout going out there and just doing it\nand like sort of you know accepting\ndeath and like these are these are like\nbig things man like death is scary for\nmost human beings yeah and like imma go\ndo Muay Thai\nimma go up on stage\nI'm a bomb in front of people\nfailure is a part of life like you're\nyou're kind of like you know Chad\nmoaning it just like like even as a kid\nyou're like who cares what people think\nand and I I get that you you you speak\nvery authentic I mean like I think\nyou're genuine I don't think we're\ngetting any but I'm just like\ndude like most people like avoid pain\nyou don't seem to give\num I think part of it is my Constitution\nlike I\npart of the rationalizing I'm like well\nif I go on stage and it goes bad that's\nfine like nothing really bad comes of\nthat like I'm not going to lose a limb\nand have to walk with a prosthetic\nforever like nothing really bad comes\nfrom that they're going to Muay Thai\nclass I know I'm going to start a\nbeginner level and I'm going to move up\nand there might be some classes that are\nharder than others do you feel bad when\nyou're at beginner level\nno no because everyone starts at\nbeginner level everyone has to begin at\nsomething there's a guy in the class\nwho's 50 who's been doing it for like I\nwant to say like between five and ten\nyears that means he started when he was\nlike 40. and the guy's incredible he's\nhit super hard you think in incredible\nshape like\num but he had to be a brand new guy at\n40. uh so it's like\nhere's the thing I I have you always\nbeen like that\num yeah like I said I've always been\nvery rational and grounded and I think\nyou I've definitely one of the I think\nthis also comes if we're going back to\nwhat we're talking about before the\nrelationship with my mom my mom was very\nmuch Keeping Up Appearances and worrying\nabout what other people thought about\nher and I've turned tried to turn out of\nthat real hard is like don't care what\nother people think about you it was all\nat all for one you have no idea what\nother people think about you so\nstressing over that is like pointless\nand if people think negative things\nabout you people will think negative\npeople the ultra super the most\nsuccessful famous people in the world\nlike richest like people who apparently\nessentially aspire to be like well not\neveryone but some of us they are the\nmost scrutinized people publicly so it's\nlike you can't control any of that stuff\num and I try to find humor in it so I\nthink that's where it comes from it's\nlike trying to get away from that\nkeeping up appear references\num because I think it adds no value to\nlife\num and trying to do what I want to do\nand have fun with that and yeah knowing\nthat you're gonna suck at almost\neverything the first time you do it but\nenjoying that process like there's\ncertain things on my bucket list that\nI'm like I know I'm gonna suck but I\nwant to get good\num like I love video games\nand uh I want to get really good at a\nvideo game before I die uh and I'm not\nI'm like oh I I decided like any like\ntwitch shooter that's done I'm too old\nfor that like I can't I don't have the\nreaction term for it so it's like I need\nsomething strategy based so I'm gonna go\nwith Pokemon I mean I just got I got the\nnew Pokemon I'm gonna start my Pokemon\nJourney learning about all the different\ntypes and everything it's all a strategy\nbased game so if I put in enough work\nand learn enough about the platform\nwhich it will be a lot of work but if I\nenjoy the process of learning all that\nand it's great and then I get to that\ngoal it's going to be a whole experience\nat a whole different Road and a whole\nnew community and different people to\nrelate to on different things and then\ndifferent experience to have in life\nthat keeps life fun and fruitful and\nexciting can we go back to the 50 year\nold dude who's good at Muay Thai yeah I\nfeel like the average experience of\nlet's say I don't know how old you are\nbut let's say people our age and I'm\nprobably a little bit older than you and\nthen even like younger like let's say\nI'm like 25 and I'm gonna like I'm gonna\nlisten I'm I'm a faithful follower of\nthe Gospel of Che\nand so I'm gonna go out now I'm gonna\nlive life right because death is\ninevitable and you gotta Seize the Day\ncarpe diem\nI'm gonna go to a class I'm gonna go to\nMuay Thai because I'm a be something I'm\nyeah I'm gonna learn how to defend\nmyself I'm gonna get in shape I'm gonna\ndo all these things I'm gonna get my ass\nkicked by a 50 year old dude yeah and\nthen I'm like well that sucks this guy\nis 50.\nand well I'm getting my ass beat and and\nthen I asked I was like oh did you like\nlearn when you were a kid and he's like\nnah\nI'm relatively new I started when I was\n40 and then you're like well\nI guess I ain't going back\nwell I think part of going through these\nexperience is to do them\nintelligently as well like you don't\njust go and like or martial arts in\ngeneral uh when I found the gym that I'm\ntraining at I tried a couple gyms before\nand they weren't bad in terms of like oh\nthey the trainers were too aggressive\nand I didn't feel safe that's a very\nimportant part of martial arts is you\nwant to go to a place where you feel\nsafe but I felt like there were more\nworkout classes uh and I wasn't no one\nwas really coming up to me and being\nlike Oh you're not kicking right you're\nnot doing this right and I that's what I\nwanted I wanted if I'm having not as\ngood of a workout but I wanted to learn\nhow to do the things properly so do like\ntake the steps to make sure you learn\nstuff sit down with people\num can I jump in for a second and sorry\nsorry if this is I'm I I don't think you\nunderstood what I said okay okay right\nlike it seems like it completely went\nover you that like people are\nlike people feel bad like that you know\nwell I guess if something makes you feel\nbad it's like at least you you tried it\nlike if you went to the class what do\nyou do when you feel bad\nwhen I feel bad\num sometimes I do just watch funny\nvideos on the internet and they make me\nfeel good and then you're just done and\nyou just you can just go back to I'm\nvery fortunate that I've never battled\nwith depression so I am a very unique\ncase on that I'm very anxiety sometimes\nsometimes I feel very anxious about\nstuff like because I do pile on too much\nwork and stuff sometimes so it's like\ngetting those things done taking a\nbreather\num but yeah I guess if something makes\nyou upset then try to avoid doing it but\nthe whole point of me doing Muay Thai\nwas to feel good and feel excited to go\nto class and and so find things that\nmake you feel excited\num I in order whenever I feel maybe like\nI don't know like I need more I start\ncomparing myself to my peers and I start\nto feel like I'm not accomplishing\nenough I look at the people who I\nstarted with in stand up and I've\nsurpassed many of them uh and I'm like I\ncould still be there uh and then I also\nlook at like this is maybe a little bit\nmorbid but I think about how fortunate I\nam just to like be born in Canada and\nopposed to a place where I could have\ntrouble finding clean drinking water or\nI could have been uh kidnapped or uh all\nthese different things that happened to\nmillions of people around the world I I\nam not experiencing it so I try to be\nvery grateful for having just these\nthings I take for granted every day\num and that helps me get grounded and\nfeel just like rationalize my situation\nand just be like yeah no things are\ngoing pretty good yeah so you know\nthat's really interesting because\nbecause I I I think you have a couple of\nin interesting cognitive tricks because\nI'm trying to understand like how you\nare the way that you are okay yeah and\nand because I think that there's a lot\nof good stuff that you say I think the\nproblem is that like most people just\nit's almost like\nit's it's like your mind is Teflon like\nstuff just seems to bounce off I am very\nI I there's a lot of stuff I can let go\nreally easily\num that's not how it is for most people\nman like I think most people like things\naffect them like if you go to Muay Thai\nand you bomb on stage and I'm sure that\nyou know stand up and stuff has has made\nyou quite resilient but I think there\nare a couple of like so what I'm trying\nto figure out is okay for this guy like\nwhat what's going on so you can say just\ndo it everyone says just do it everyone\nwho does it says just do it\nbut the problem is they don't\nknow how they're able to just do it when\nthe rest of the people\nare struggling to just do it right like\nthere's there's no insight into like why\nit's easy for some and hard for others\nI think\num I think the the the turning out of\nthe Keeping Up Appearances like really\ntrying to not worry about the the\noutside perception\nthat has been a baseline of who I am I\nthink has helped a lot yeah so I mean\nbut I think that too is something that\nlike you can say right and I'm with you\nbut\nyour ability\nto let go of appearances is in and of\nitself adjust doing it I'm just gonna\nstop thinking about what people I'm\ngonna stop caring about what most people\ncan't do that yeah and and\nif I can just finish yeah yeah so I I\nthink what's really interesting is you\ndo one thing and so I'm sort of I'm\ndigging right because what I'm I'm sort\nof noticing is that on the one hand\nyou're very inspiring but on the other\nhand like\nI don't think most people can do what\nyou do\nand so the question is how what is it\nthat actually goes on under the hood\nthat allows you to do these things\nand I so I want to share one thing so I\nthought this was really interesting\nwhich is that\nwhen you find yourself comparing to\npeople who are better than you\nyou actually do this cognitive thing\nwhere you go back to people that you\nstarted with\nand so one thing I think you're really\ngood at that you sort of do and I don't\nknow if this is intentional or but I\nthink this is more duplicatable is like\ngaining perspective so I've noticed this\nmyself where I felt inferior when I was\nin high school I felt inferior when I\nwas in college I felt\ninferior when I was studying to become\nmonk in India I didn't really feel\ninferior in med school I certainly felt\ninferior in residency when I was\ntraining to be a psychiatrist I felt\ninferior as a streamer and then I kind\nof noticed that like what I'm constantly\ndoing\nI I was in\nline with a co-intern of mine getting\ncoffee at like 4 30 p.m one day like in\nthe hospital and I was like holy\nthis guy's on a completely different\nlevel but I'm not comparing myself to\nthe people I'm not comparing myself to\nthe people that made me feel inferior in\nhigh school I'm not comparing myself to\npeople in college I so what happens is\nI'm constantly\nchanging the goal posts on myself yes\nand and one of the things that I I don't\nthink that we really do which is a\nreally cool cognitive trick is like any\ntime you're feeling inferior to really\nask yourself okay like do I keep on\nchanging like it's like I moved from the\namateur League to the pro league but we\nnever really stopped to acknowledge that\nI used to be an amateur and even before\nI was in the amateur League I was on\nvarsity and even before that I was JV\nand that if you really look at like if\nyou really do Fair comparisons which is\nnot what our mind does we do really\nunfair comparisons\nand that's also because I imagine when\nwe make ourselves feel insecure there's\na part of us that wants to work harder\nright because that insecurity okay I\nwant to be better I want to be able to\nplay in this league and so people who\nhave imposter syndrome are actually\npeople who are the most successful and\nthe reason is because they're feeling\ninsecure and then they're like working\nreally hard and then they rise and they\nrise and they rise in their imposters\ninto that cognitive piece I think is\nactually really important because I I do\nthink that what\nwho you are we can we can learn from we\ncan start to do some of the things that\nyou do\nbut the life that you're describing is\nlike is wild dude like going out and\nlike hanging out in a cottage with 10\nComedians and and you know like really\nenjoying life and traveling to Greece\nand and going up and doing stand up and\nlike it sounds amazing but it sounds\nlike you're just a different human\nI I being fully transparent I have the\nsame issue with the Imposter syndrome I\nthink that's I think that's a an\nimportant part of any creative is to\nhave the doubt because doubt will it\nhelps you second guess and helps you\ntinker and helps you work a little\nharder see you just did it again\n[Laughter]\nno I don't know what I did like I'm like\nit's good it's good to yeah yeah you\nknow I have these problems they're like\ngood problems they help me grow as a\nperson instead of being crushed by the\nweight of imposter syndrome which is\nwhat happens to most people\nuh-huh I don't know I don't know I don't\nknow any way to look at it yeah I I\ncould tell and I I mean I hopefully this\nyou know you're a comedian so I can say\nthis I can see that you're completely\nclueless like that's clear to me\nand I I know I have friends who struggle\nwith uh emotional uh and mental health\nthings and I'm very very grateful that I\ndon't in the same way\num but it just has been it's always been\nlike that I've always one of the things\nI uh someone asked me when I started\ndoing stand-up they're like were you\nscared about like doing bad and I said I\nthink I was too stupid to know that it\ncould go bad I was just like yeah I'll\nbe fine like I just was like yeah I'll\ngo do it it'll be fine and I just did it\nand it was fine and then I just kept\ndoing it that was like kind of the my\nthought process going into the first one\nyeah dude I I I think\nI think everyone talks about like\nsuccess stories and and you know things\nlike that is like stories of like\nperseverance and intelligence and\nInnovation and creativity and and you\nknow like believing in yourself and and\nI I think the story of success I'm\nhearing from you and I think it's fair\nto say you're you know you're you're\ndecently successful is is you know the\nchase story is like how to be a quitter\nand how to be an idiot yeah you know the\nreal formula to to rising in life one of\nmy one of my buddies very smart guy\num he's very much like anti-work\nsubreddit mentality like he's like yeah\nI don't want to work I don't I think\njobs suck which I'm not completely off\nwith that I'm like into the whole\nstandard idea of working in jobs I don't\nthink is the best\nmindset to have\num but one thing he says he's like\nbecause there's this perception that the\nsmarter you get the harder it is to be\nhappy\num like you start to see the whole world\nand like you you can't turn away from\nall these injustices that are going on\nconstantly any and what he says he's\nlike maybe you're too stupid like you're\nso smart but too stupid to be happy like\nif you're so smart you should figure out\nhow to be happy\num which is a very ignorant way to look\nat happiness\num\nbut I think\nthe rat it's the same thing as saying\nlike what if it could go bad what if it\ncan go good they're both the same sides\nof the same coin like everyone you're\nhaving those negative thoughts of oh\nthis could go wrong this could go wrong\nthis can go wrong you can look at this\ncan go right this can go right this can\ngo right you you can make a decision in\nthat moment to turn the ship the other\nway and you can use the negative thought\nas the trigger like a great trigger for\nlike getting up and going to the gym is\nwhen you have that thought I don't want\nto go to the gym that's when you go to\nthe gym that's when you're like I gotta\nget up and do it right now using the the\nthe\nprocrastination as the trigger for the\ngetting the thing done that is a little\nmental trick that helps you get more\nstuff done and you feel good when you\nget the stuff done\nokay\nso first thing your friend is\nsurprisingly correct\nSo speaking of of you know there are\nstudies that are done on suicidality\nand the greater your Insight the more\nrapidly the faster you learn how screwed\nyou are when you get diagnosed with\nsomething bad the more likely you are to\nbe suicidal there's also studies that\nshow that so if you kind of think about\ndepression and anxiety\nso IQ\nis good at like understanding things and\nis powerful the problem with a lot of\nthings like especially depression is\nthat depression hijacks your IQ\nso like if\nyou hate yourself and you're really\n smart if there's some kind of\nemotional driver that is controlling\nyour IQ then suddenly it's like you've\ngot this really powerful weapon but it's\nlike pointed in the wrong direction\nso there are even we have a video about\nlike it's really interesting but you\ncan't like logic your way out of\ndepression in fact there's some data\nthat actually if you're smart like you\nmay be more prone to mental illness in\nsome ways\num so even things like creative like raw\ncreativity objective measures of\ncreativity are higher in people with\nlike bipolar disorder now creative\noutput is lower in people with bipolar\ndisorder because they're not able to you\nknow do this craft process kind of like\nI mean I have no idea if you're bipolar\nor not but you know the craft process\nand and sort of resulting in something\nis hard but your friend is actually not\nwrong there\num and the other thing that I'm really\ncurious about is like this that\nyou're talking about once again I'm like\ndude I don't think that's how humans\nwork and which is like I'm procrastinate\nlike I don't feel like going to the gym\ndo you get that most people just don't\ngo to the gym I I do how do you do that\nwhat did you how did you what the\nman\num I don't know I just like you just use\nit as a I have a buddy who put me onto\nit who was like yeah use that as a\ntrigger and I was like okay I'll try\ndoing that it doesn't work 100 of the\ntime but I tried to get it to work so so\nwhat what happens there when you use it\nas a trigger\nSo like\num this morning uh I was like you uh I\nwake up and I start checking my phone\nand then I tell myself oh before I go I\nlike to go for a walk first thing in the\nmorning it's like before I go for a walk\nmaybe I'll just look for content to\nreact to later so I can have an excuse\nto keep looking at my phone and I was\nlike No just go for a walk and so I get\nup I just like and then also making\nthose things comfortable it's when I saw\nso I'll wear shorts and flip-flops and\nit's like okay it's like a less of a\nbarrier entry even if that small barrier\nis putting on your shoes flip-flops are\neasier to put on now you're out walking\nmoving your body and now I'm a step\ncloser to going to the gym because going\nto the gym after a walk it's nice\nbecause my body's nice and warmed up\nfrom moving around a bunch\num\nbut that's yeah that's kind of that's\nkind of it to get it\ngo okay I think that makes a lot of\nsense so I'm gonna I'm gonna unpack that\na little bit and this is really great uh\nare you how are you feeling about this\nconversation by the way great yeah am I\nam I like moving in the wrong direction\nlike so can I grab water really quick\nyeah sure and I'm gonna have to wrap in\nmaybe about 10 minutes but but go grab\nwater and I'll cool\num\nwhat I'm gonna say I'm gonna say look\nthis this this this guy's been standing\ndid you guys see that that's insane\nhe's been standing this whole time what\nthe\nokay\nyou've been standing you're not saying\nI've been standing yeah yeah I'm\nstanding yeah I have like a standing\ndesk\nyeah that's cool okay\num I have to do the you know\nyeah I know the sitting is great I love\nthe city\num so here's what I'm kind of noticing\nso if you want to use procrastination as\na trigger to action I think where you're\nstarting is first of all being fully\naware that oh crap I want to\nprocrastinate right now really just\nacknowledging\nI do not want to do this and then so\nmost of the time when we\nprocrastinate we don't realize\nthat that thought is a trigger for a\nparticular Behavior\nand once you realize that it is a\ntrigger for a behavior if you can catch\nit in the act you can actually deviate\naway and then I think the second thing\nthat you do is that you don't anytime\nyou're feeling lazy you don't try to\nforce yourself to do the thing that you\ndon't want to do you just force yourself\nto do anything but\nsinking into the procrastination so if\nit's like like okay I don't feel like\ngoing to the gym and I feel like pulling\nout my phone I'm not going to pull out\nmy phone but I'm not going to go to the\ngym either and this is where I think a\nlot of people trip up because they try\nto go like a hundred percent mm-hmm and\nI think what what's really interesting\nbecause you're like okay I'm just going\nto put on flip-flops and I'm going to go\nfor a walk because if I can dodge\ngetting sucked into this then going to\nthe gym is easier yeah and and so I\nthink your story is one of being a\nquitter\nbeing ignorant and actually being a\nslacker because you don't try to go to\nthe gym you just put on flip-flops in\nshorts and go for a walk so catch it in\nthe moment and do way less than what\nyour target is\nand I think the um like the way I look\nat those things is I have I have like my\nwhat I call my dailies like I have five\nthings I try to do every day which is\num I'm called like education so when I\nwalk I like listen to a podcast or have\nlike an audiobook or something going and\nthen uh I go to the gym right make\ncontent meditate those are like the five\nthings to do every day so do get those\nthings going one after the other and if\nyou can get those done\nin succession then you're like you're on\nto a killer day and then if you get them\nall done then you look at the to-do list\nafter that\num but if every time I kind of knowing\nwhat I need to do every day if I start\nscrolling or doing something else I know\nI'm deviating from what I need to do so\nit's really easy to identify the\nprocrastination\num\nalso you can do little things to make\nthe jobs more fun like a thing that I\nmade the gym a lot more fun was I have a\npodcast that I love listening to I try\nto only listen to it when I go to the\ngym so now it's like I get excited to\nlisten to my podcast because I'm at the\ngym and so now I'm making the gym more\nfun these are like little mental tricks\nand you can also just do like fake it\ntill you make it where when you have\nthat thing I don't want to go to the gym\nyou tell yourself in your brain you go\nno I love the gym I love it it's great\nand like that even though it sounds so\nsimplistic it does help like this mental\ntrick of like no I do I like it I like\nit I get in shape I like the feeling\nfeeling in shape I like working out I\nlike getting a sweat on and you think of\nall the things you do really like about\nthe gym because a lot of the time when\nyou're procrastinating on or at least\nfor me I find when I'm procrastinating\nand doing something it's not so much\nthat I don't like doing the thing I\ndon't like the feeling of doing\nsomething I'm required to do I don't\nlike that homework feeling that like I\nhave to get this done like I\nprocrastinate on writing all the time\nand then every time I write I'm like I\nlove writing I love writing jokes the\nfeeling of coming up with a new joke is\nincredible I love it like the gym I can\njustify not liking a little bit more\nbecause there's times where you work out\nreally hard and you feel like crap or\nyou've injured yourself or whatever but\nthe writing is like almost 99 of the\ntime I'm having a good time while I'm\nwriting\num so yeah so I I think how do you get\nover that feeling of like requirement\nhomework feeling I've never gone over it\nso because I also think it's interesting\nthat your dailies are not is not your\nto-do list\ndailies are just the requirements that\nyou just have to get done every day like\nbrushing your teeth or something\num but uh those like that homework\nfeeling of doing something getting those\nthings done how I get over those I've\nnever gone over that feeling but I have\nlearned to subside the feeling of\nhomework and usually it's just getting\ninto the thing like just doing the thing\nmakes you feel better like going for the\nwalk and then putting in the podcast and\nthen sitting down to meditate like doing\nonce you're doing the thing you don't\nfeel the need to procrastinate in it as\nmuch once you're started yeah yeah so\nyou really just have to go and do and\nalso just removing barriers to entry\nreally helps like the gym I go to is\nI don't know like two blocks from my\nfront door so I leave I I literally\nleave in my I bring no bag just my gym\nattire and I walk straight into the gym\nand I walk straight to the thing I need\nto work on I don't need to go to a\nlocker and put myself in a locker and do\nthese things like there's I've removed a\nlot of barriers to me working out and\nthat makes it a lot easier the writing\nit's like I don't need a notepad and a\npen and blah blah blah I need my phone\nand that's it the meditation I just need\nto sit down\num the walking I just need to put shoes\non and I can go\num the education I've made it super\nsimple where it's a podcast it's an\naudio book it's whatever it's something\nI'm listening to that makes it really\neasy\num what is it writing exercise\nuh education meditation creating content\non I just like creating content usually\nI save to the end because then I'm like\nchomping at the bit to look at my phone\nbecause I love looking at my phone and\nthen so you do that at the end of the\nday so it's like oh no I finally get to\nlook at my phone and then I'm like\nscrolling scrolling scrolling scrolling\nand then to help with that so I don't\nget too lost in it I set timers so I\nknow I limit myself so I don't get\ncaught in the procrastination of making\nan excuse that I'm trying to find the\nperfect video when really now I'm just\nmindlessly scrolling\nthat's really cool Jay\num I I'm gonna have to get going in\nabout five minutes ten minutes or so but\ndo you have any questions for me or\nanything else you want to add before you\nwrap\num I don't know man uh I've of you for\ntwitch uh you can find me at little\ndinky news we do a lot of uh gaming\ncontent and stuff we react to a bunch of\ndifferent things we just watched the\nPlaystations\nor whatever press conference they just\nhad so we were like a lot of gaming uh\nCentric stuff uh we play a lot of\nfortnite been ripping that a lot\nrecently\num but yeah no I don't think I have\nanything else to to throw in there I\nthink start small uh and then grow I've\nhad a oh and uh one thing I wanted to\nsay was like\nwhat helps with the knowing if you're\nprocrastinating is like being really\nhonest with yourself like when I go for\na walk sometimes I listen to nothing and\nI will just think about\nlikes anything I'll just let my mind run\nand like some like I got on a tangent\nrecently where like I I don't like\nfashion I've always kind of never been\nsubscribing to Fashion I was like and I\nwas like why asking myself the question\nwhy why I'm like pulling that up it's\nlike well I feel like it doesn't add\nanything to a person well why do I feel\nlike what do I feel like adds to a\nperson and like digging deeper and\ndeeper and that's a whole other thing\nbut that helps you get very honest with\nyourself of your likes and dislikes\nwhich I think comedy has really helped\nbecause what comedy is like finding your\nvoice is just\num finding your sense of humor so I'm\nlike super in tune with one aspect of my\nlife which is like laughter and joy and\nenjoyment and that has helped me\nunderstand all other things very similar\nto The Book of five rings where he's\nlike I mastered the skill of strategy\nand now I can learn all of their skills\nso if you get in tune with yourself on\nsomething you can apply that process of\ngetting in tune to learning other\naspects of your life book of five rings\nis Musashi yes\nthat's cool I'm good good luck yeah it's\nbeen a while since I've read it\num cool well thank you very much Chase\nso so uh I know you're big on Tick Tock\num stream on Twitch anything live coming\nup or anywhere else that people can find\nyou if they're yes I'm gonna be in\nOklahoma in July\num Michigan in August Austin in\nSeptember and we're adding on a bunch of\nstuff now it looks like St Louis uh\nWisconsin those are going to be added\nvery quickly we're kind of figuring out\nthe pieces of what the next leg of road\nwork is going to be going into the late\nsummer uh fall into the winter so once I\nknow all that all that will be announced\nbut that those states are pretty much\nconfirmed right now cool awesome man\nwell um good luck to you on all of your\nendeavors um I may try to come see you\nin Austin\nand uh you know thank you so much for\nsharing your perspective I think a very\ndifferent conversation from what I was\nexpecting because most of the comedians\nI've worked with are like train wrecks\nlike from a mental health standpoint but\nI I really think it's amazing how\nyou pivot so much\num and and how you kind of you know\nthere's so many things that I think can\nwear us down or cause us to almost like\ncrack under the pressure but you seem to\ndo a couple of things that can really\nhelp you like move in the right\ndirection I think those are actually\nlearnable\num little cognitive tricks even this\naspect of you know why asking yourself\nwhy all the way down\nto the center about yourself yeah\num is a big part of kind of what we do\nin psychotherapy but I think a lot of it\ncan be done\ninternally as well yeah just on a walk\nso thank you so much for coming and good\nluck to you man thank you I appreciate\nyou having me on yeah take care dude bye\nokay\num I got a\nX out of this all right\nso that's Chase dude what on Earth\nthis guy is insane\num in his you know it's so interesting\nbecause I I found myself judging him\nbased on his comedy I thought he was\ngoing to be like a degenerate\nbut he's like uh Miyamoto Musashi five\nrings reading Mega Chad Teflon Buddha\ntype human\nwho uses procrastination as a trigger to\nmotivation like what\noh yeah we're gonna talk about Envy\nwe can do that and then we'll wrap for\nthe day\nokay\nso\nlet's talk about Envy for a second\nis there a lot of emotions that we talk\nabout and we sort of like talk about how\nto deal with them right there's a lot of\nlike stuff on like shame like how do I\novercome toxic shame and like anger like\nhow do I learn to accept my anger right\nthe one that we don't really talk about\nis envy\nand envy is like it's really crippling\nin a lot of ways but the tricky thing is\nthat Envy can be good\nso Envy for a lot of people is fuel like\nI want to be that person\nand the tricky thing is that also when\nwe talk about emotions we talk about\nthem generally\nlike okay how do I get in touch with my\nemotions how do I overcome my emotions\nhow do I allow space for my emotions man\nwe don't think about them as discrete\nthings that have discrete strategies to\ndeal with\nso there's this old text called the\nvishudda Maga the path of purification\nwhich is really cool because what they\nsort of realize is a text from the\nBuddhist tradition is that each emotion\nactually has a particular key that\nunlocks it\nthere's a particular way that you can\ntake every emotion\nand transform it into something positive\nso let's start by understanding what is\nenvy\nEnvy is some amount of appreciation plus\nego\nso if you think about it like what does\nthat mean you can't Envy something\nunless you appreciate it we don't envy\nbad things we appreciate good things\nright makes sense\nsecond thing is we don't appreciate all\ngood things I mean so we don't envy all\ngood things\nright so there's all kinds of people out\nthere who have all kinds of good stuff\nand we don't appreciate all of the good\nthings\nso Envy at its core Envy has a positive\nemotion there which is appreciation so\nif you appreciate a particular thing\nthat is what can lead to envy\nbut appreciation is a good thing\nright like to appreciate stuff is like\ngood like that's the point of life and\nlike I appreciate like it's good\nso what is it that takes appreciation\nand turns it into the toxic emotion of\nEnvy it is ego\nso there's a really simple diagnostic\ntrick that y'all can do\nand that is the next time you envy\nyou feel Envy notice that the Envy is\ndirected towards a person\nbut you envy that person for a reason\nright so if someone let's say someone\nlike is good looking right Envy\nsomeone's physique\nor someone's success\nI envy the person but there is an\nattribute of that person that I\nappreciate\nand what I really respect is that thing\nbut the second I I make a comparison the\nsecond I embody it with a person that\nbecomes ego because I'm over here and\nthis person is over here\nand there are all kinds of things where\nwe can see like the value of\nappreciation where I can look at someone\nand I can be inspired by them right but\nwhen I get inspired by them I'm not\nthinking about them I'm thinking about\nme\nI don't know if that sort of makes sense\nbut I say like oh wow that person is is\nis really in shape or works really hard\nI'm gonna start doing that too I can do\nthat and so the focus becomes on myself\ninstead of the other person\nthat's the difference between\ninspiration and envy but if we real\nreally look at like where is where are\nour eyes pointed in Envy they are\npointed at another human being and\nthere's a comparison being made\nand when I'm inspired by another person\nmy eyes are pointing at myself and\nthere's no comparison\nso I'm like okay I'm gonna start doing\nthis\nand so how can you take envy and turn it\ninto appreciation or inspiration you\nhave to remove the ego component you\nmust remove the comparative component\nbecause the appreciation is down there\nright even the longing for the thing is\ndown there but this is what's kind of\ntricky is that Envy can sort of like\nInspire us to act but it does so like in\nsort of a polluting way right it's like\nit generates like this nuclear waste\nlike sure it Powers our submarine but\nwe're like generating like nuclear waste\nas a result so it hurts\nand so what you really need to do is\nnotice the next time you envy someone\nask yourself a couple of questions one\nis what do I appreciate about this\nwhat is the thing that I'm actually\nattracted to the second thing is why do\nI compare myself\nto this person why is this instead of\nbeing about the thing itself that I want\nto do\nI'm putting my identity and their\nidentity into it and I'm drawing a\ncomparison it is out of that comparison\nthat the toxicity arises\nso take as you notice like I want to be\nthis person right it's not that you want\nthose things which is what you tell\nyourself but this is exactly why we sort\nof Miss it because it's not really about\nthe things you can't Envy you can't Envy\na physique you can want a physique but\nyou can Envy a person because Envy is\nperson-centric\nand to try to remove that from the\nequation notice wow like I'm drawing a\ncomparison between me and them and that\ncomparison in turn has to do with your\nidentity so I feel a particular way\nabout myself\nand now we see why you're so far from\nthe goal because the goal is the\nphysique this person has the physique\nthere's a comparison the comparison why\ndo we compare Things We compare things\nbecause we ourselves are insecure about\nthem\nthat's why we compare right and you may\nsay what what do you mean by that let's\njust understand that for a second if\nyou're secure about something like you\ndon't notice it in other people\nright it's kind of com it's kind of\nweird but it's like so simple and it's\nso automatic that we don't even realize\nit\nthat all of our comparisons are based on\ninsecurities\nand so now we can see that okay the root\nof Envy is actually ego and ego is a\ndefense mechanism against insecurity\nso when do I feel egotistical when\nsomeone threatens my intelligence and\nI'm afraid that maybe I'm not quite as\nsmart as I think I am and you can look\nat social media and certain famous\npeople and you just can trigger them\nvery easily\nbecause if you you know people who are\nconfident it's like doesn't really\nbother them to be criticized\nbut when we have an insecurity and\nthat's like that's how like kids learn\nhow to make fun of you right like they\nlearn where the weak points are and why\ndo particular kids make fun in a\nparticular way it's because they sniff\nout the insecurity how do they sniff out\nthe insecurity because of the way that\nyou react\nso someone makes fun of you bully makes\nfun of you five different ways and five\nuh five different days in five different\nways\nand what do they do next week which name\ndo they they attach to you and then\neveryone starts calling you that it's\nthe thing that you react to\nso that insecurity as we get older we\ndevelop an ego to protect ourselves I'm\nnot stupid you're stupid this isn't my\nfault this is your fault I'm the\nsmartest person on the planet I'm the\nrichest person on the planet I'm so\nsuccessful look at me I'm a mega chat\nI'm in shape I make all all this money I\ndate lots of these people\nI have everyone lined up everyone wants\na piece of meat\nall ego and underneath\ninsecurity\nso if you want to disable Envy\nnotice your insecurity\nnotice the comparison\nand then gravitate towards the\nappreciation recognize that wow this is\nsomething that I want and instead of\nenvying that person and your eyes being\nover there and trying to duplicate them\nnotice what is beyond them what is it\nthat I'm truly appreciating and then ask\nyourself what can I do to get that thing\nthat I appreciate how can I actually\nmove towards that what's the smallest\nthing that I can do\nto move towards that which I appreciate\nand something revolutionary will happen\nwhich is that you'll start to move\ntowards it and you may say but Dr K\nthat's hard I don't I want all kinds of\nthings and I don't move towards them and\nthe reason for that is because so much\nof your cognition is caught up\nin Envy where does the energy of Envy\nget you nowhere and it occupies your\nmind it fills your mind it's all of this\ninsecurity all of this ego instead of\nactually moving towards anything that\nyou want\nand so once you remove all of this ego\nfrom the equation you'll be able to\nactually move towards your goals\nand if you pay attention to yourself\nyou'll find that the goals that are the\nhardest to achieve are the ones that\nhave your ego involved\nif you're not trying to impress anyone\nyou can hang out with them very easily\nI can hang out with my dozen gaming\nbuddies because I'm not trying to get\nany of them to fall in love with me\nI'm just hanging out but the second that\nmy worth\nI want to be accepted by this person I\ndon't want to be rejected ego enters the\npicture and all of our cognitive energy\nis like spiraling out of control in a\ncompletely unproductive way\nand so as you dismantle a envy and move\ntowards appreciation as you step away\nfrom ego and start thinking about what\ncan I do how can I take one step towards\nthis thing you will actually become like\nmore motivated\nyou will start to accomplish more\nand so practice understanding and\ncatching envy and splitting it apart\ninto appreciation and ego and then step\nback from the ego and you'll start\nmoving towards what you want\nmake sense questions\nNicolette I'm I'm INTP\nI'm certainly not entp\nmyers-brigg\nlove it\nokay this is beautiful great question\nsporb iyosh is saying what if Envy comes\nfrom something that you think you cannot\nhave whether or not that's true\nbrilliant question\nwhat if Envy comes from something you\ncannot have there's the ego it all it's\nall not always going to do that but that\nis absolutely exactly what I'm talking\nabout why can't you have it\nother people can have it but you can't\nhave it that's ego\nthat's your identity that's exactly\nthat's gonna you're spot on that's where\nit's gonna come from\nbut that's the whole point that's how\nyou have to disarm it because it's still\nthe ego why can't you have it and now\nthis is where your mind will convince\nyou it'll come up with all of this logic\nand all of this data\nI can't be happy because dot dot dot\nbut you can go on the internet\nand you can find a thousand people who\nare convinced that they cannot have\nsomething and you can recognize that\nthey're wrong\nand you can argue with them until you're\nblue in the face and it's never going to\nmake a difference\nbecause once you have an identity\nthat you cannot have something it\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nthere's no way they'll hire me for this\njob so you go into the job interview\nthinking there's no way they're going to\nhire you\nyou're dejected you're not even going to\ntry you're certainly not excited how on\nEarth would you get excited instead what\nyou're doing is you're protecting\nyourself from the inevitable rejection\nand if you're afraid that you can't have\nsomething and you don't deserve it\nbecause all of these logical reasons how\ndo you protect yourself you protect\nyourself by preventing excitement by\npreventing yourself from wanting it\nand if you prevent excitement and\nprevent yourself from wanting it\nyou sabotage your ability to get it\nbecause when you go in for the job\ninterview do you want the job no\nI cannot it hurts too much to think that\nI may want the job and not get it\nthe pain of an unfulfilled desire is too\nmuch for me to handle so instead what\nI'm gonna do is I'm gonna stop wanting\nand then your life becomes numb and\nempty because what do you do I don't\nwant anything\nso I'm gonna sit at home all day in\nfront of the screen and maybe drink or\nget high from time to time\nbeautiful question\nis the goal to completely get rid of\nyour ego\nonly if you want to become enlightened\nso the goal depends on the goal\nso for most human beings what I would\nrecommend is that you should be in\ncontrol of your ego the ego is not a bad\nthing we've evolved it for a reason\nthe problem is that the ego controls us\ninstead of the other way around\nright so the goal is for you to\nunderstand when the ego is active and\neven let it act sometimes\nbut for you to be in control of it\nso the ego is supposed to protect us\nlike I'm not egoless by any means if\nsomeone tries to steal something that is\nmine\nmy ego will arise and I will let it\narise\nright so sometimes like it's kind of\nweird but like you know let's say I'm in\nthe emergency room doing like an\nemergency Psychiatry shift and there's\nsomeone who's like calling me names\nand like that's when I let my ego come\nout and I say hey I'm here to help you\nit's not okay for you to call me these\nthings I don't deserve to be called\nthese things I understand you're having\na bad night I'm here to help you I'm\nworking overnight\nand like I'm not putting my kids to bed\ntoday\nto help your ass\nand I'm gonna help you either way but\nthe way that you're treating me is\ncompletely unacceptable\nI'm here because of my ethical like I\nhave an ethical obligation which is like\npart of the reason I come here is to\nhelp like you\nbut I would really appreciate it if you\ncould treat me with some respect\nand if you could stop being an\nbecause we got to do this like you're\nnot leaving\nand we have to figure this out\nand I'm going to do my duty but like\nit's I'm gonna do a way better job if\nyou stop treating me like and I'm\non your side the only person you're\nreally hurting here is yourself and\nyou're like pulling me along on the Pain\nTrain for no reason\nright so ego is good\nand sometimes like it's a huge problem\nbecause when a lot of times when people\nare psychiatrically ill\nthey're family members enable them so\nmuch no one ever ever actually sets\nboundaries on them and it doesn't\nactually help them\nlike I was working with someone once who\nhad ADHD and they were in this\nrelationship and like you know they had\ndifficulty doing things because they\nhave ADHD and like that's fair right\nthat's what we're here to help you with\nbut at the same time like they have to\ndo their part like it doesn't change the\nfact that in the relationship their\npartner has to do everything because\nthey're too disorganized so now the\npartner is doing the work of two people\nand is it the person with adhd's fault\nthat they have ADHD does it objectively\nmake things harder it's not their fault\nthey have ADHD and it's not it does make\nthings objectively harder but who is it\nmaking harder for makes it harder for\neveryone\nand yet this person is not engaging in\ntreatment\nthey're not using planners and\norganization and all this kind of stuff\nso they're not accepting responsibility\nfor the circumstance is your life hard\nyes\nbut just because it's hard doesn't mean\nthat you shouldn't be\nworking harder at it\nplease do a video on your struggles\nDay in the Life okay\nI will do those things\nyeah you know no no saying my cure for\nEnvy is fantasized having the thing in\nDaydream until I can't know more Ludwig\ndoes the same thing we had a\nconversation with Ludwig where he was\nlike yeah I just fantasize about it and\nthen it kind of disappears and I'm like\nokay that's cool\nah how do you stop once you have to give\nin to your ego what a great question\nlast question then I gotta run\nso you don't give in to your ego\ngiving in to your ego is letting the dog\noff leash\nyou don't give in to the ego you just\ntake it for a walk and you're still in\ncontrol\nbut you don't let it off the leash\ngiving in to your ego is a problem\nit helps to mitigate the pain absolutely\nthat's the big tragedy in life\nis that we are so stuck\nmitigating the pain of life that we\ncan't move towards anything\nright and now the problems see there's a\nthere's a basic problem in in society\ntoday\nwhich is that in the past if you had\nsome sort of pain\nthat was a signal for you to change your\nlife to fix the pain\nso if we look at like animals if an\nanimal is hungry there's only one thing\nan animal can do to get rid of that\nhunger\nif we are socially ostracized as human\nbeings there it hurts a lot but then\nthat hurt motivates us to change our\nbehavior and reintegrate into society\nthis is why we have forgiveness as a\nconcept because people feel bad and even\nif you screw up there's an Avenue\ntowards reintegration\nnow the problem is that when we feel\npain\nyou have a way to disarm that pain\nwithout actually making a change in your\nlife\nthis\nyou can take the pain away\nwithout changing the circumstances that\ncause the pain and this is how we get\nstuck\nbecause it used to be that hey like if\nI'm sitting and I'm uncomfortable\nI have to move and then I will feel\nbetter if I'm hungry I have to eat\nbut when it comes to this psychic pain\nI'm ashamed of myself I'm a failure I'm\nfilled with Envy I'm angry what do we do\nwith those things when you're angry what\ndo you do you you downvote\nsomething instead of actually making a\nchange in the world\nand when you actually make a change in\nthe world\nyou feel good about yourself and you\nhelp other human beings but now because\nof this\nwe can make the pain go away without\nactually changing our circumstances\nand then we end up stuck in life because\nwe haven't built anything and now we get\nstuck in this cycle of taking the pain\naway constantly and so our life is not\nsomething that we live\nit is a constant process of pain numbing\nand it's because this has\nshort-circuited why we have pain in the\nfirst place pain is a signal to change\nwe don't need to anymore\nand this is why mental this is why we\nhave a mental health crisis\nbecause no one has to fix their lives\nanymore\nyou just numb it so easily\nspectral is right it's like a pacifier\nbrilliant\nbrilliant\nokay\nwe gotta run\nthank you all very much for coming\nChe is a mega chat not what I was\nexpecting but that's what's fun about\nthis\nand I think what's really cool about\nlike talking to people is that we can\ndiscover that so this is the last thing\nI'll leave y'all with here's the last\nthing\nwe go through life and life is hard\nthe thing is each and every one of us\nlearn certain tricks to make life better\nor tolerable\nbut the problem is we never share our\nknowledge with each other\nbecause we don't even realize what we're\ndoing the automatic things that make you\ngood at life you're not even aware of\nbut the more that we talk to people the\nmore we're just going to discover\ndifferent tricks\nand I encourage y'all to pay attention\nto these conversations and think like oh\nthis person is different but like most\npeople can become somewhat similar if\nthey change the way that they act or the\nway that they think if one person is in\nshape and you're not in shape you can do\nthat\nand you can do that for the mind too\nthis is the big thing that we don't\nunderstand this is what the yogis\nfigured out is the path to Enlightenment\nis like something that anyone can walk\nthat's what meditation is\nand so if you want to figure out how to\nlive life listen to conversations with\nother people\nand try to figure out how is this person\nable to do this and what part of this\ncan I duplicate because each and every\none of this is what I've seen is like\nevery patient I've worked with\nwill figure out some things on their own\nand if we pull all that knowledge\ntogether we can literally craft a life\nthat is like perfect\nand you could say oh Dr K like you can't\nsay that there's a such thing as perfect\nlife like oh my God no like what the\n where did we get off on the idea\nthat we can can't craft a perfect life\nwell because we haven't been able to\nthat's because we haven't been working\ntogether\nand if we work together I think we can\nget pretty damn close\nso stay stick with it\ngood luck\nand thanks for showing up today\nadios everybody"
