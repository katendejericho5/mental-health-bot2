    "transcript": "if you look at relationships to a\ncertain degree we're responsible for our\npartners feelings right like it's our\njob to help them feel better and that's\nwhat especially a romantic relationship\nis about and at the same time we can\ncross the realm into toxicity so quickly\nif we become solely responsible and the\nother tricky thing that I oftentimes see\nin these kind of codependent\nrelationships is that as you start\ntaking more of that space your partner\nstarts taking less and then eventually\nthe burden of their feelings Falls to\nyou and you feel wholly responsible for\ntheir feelings yeah and then you know\nyou don't have 100 power and then that\nleads to a whole host of challenges in\nterms of you trying harder being more\ncontrolling you know as well as them\nsort of dumping the responsibility on\nyou and both you all agree that if they\nfeel a particular way it's your fault\nwhich is really when relationships\nbecome very difficult"
