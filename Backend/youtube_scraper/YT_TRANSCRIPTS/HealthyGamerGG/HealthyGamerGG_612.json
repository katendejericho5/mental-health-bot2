    "transcript": "all right so this is Dr K's guide so we\nhave four basic guides we have anxiety\ndepression meditation and ADHD so a big\npart of Dr K's guide is that it's not\njust about the illness it's about\nnon-clinical perspectives on the illness\nso what we try to do on Dr K's guide is\nbasically it's the way that I think\nabout other human beings when someone\ncomes into my office I have a branching\nlogic in my mind and then even if we go\ndown to negative emotions so people will\nsay oh I've fallen behind and if you\nguys were paying attention at the\nbeginning of stream look at that there's\nactually a video for that so we got tons\nof people who use the guide and they're\nlike hey how do I give this to Someone\nLike You Can't and then our devs started\nworking on it because people were like\nhow do we gift the guide so if you guys\nknow someone who could benefit from this\nstuff you can gift it now the problem\nwith all of our twitch and YouTube\ncontent is that it's Standalone so the\nmost you can ever get is like surface\nthe whole advantage of the guide is that\nyou can go Way Beyond surface"
