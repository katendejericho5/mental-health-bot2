    "transcript": "so the feeling of being overwhelmed\ncomes from a relationship between\npassive challenges and active challenges\nnow what does that mean so a passive\nchallenge is something that you are\nchallenged with that you did not choose\nso when life throws you difficulties\nthose are passive challenges and\noftentimes this is what makes us feel\noverwhelmed because there are too many\nthings that are outside of our control\nand when life is sending us a bunch of\nstuff that are outside of our control we\ncan't fix them if we can't fix them we\nfeel overwhelmed there's another kind of\nchallenge though which is something\ncalled an active Challenge and an active\nchallenge is a challenge that you choose\nto take so if you set a goal for\nyourself and you decide to move towards\nit that's an active challenge is it\ndifficult yes but you are choosing the\ndifficulty your mind feels overwhelmed\nwhen your passive challenges outweigh\nyour active challenges"
