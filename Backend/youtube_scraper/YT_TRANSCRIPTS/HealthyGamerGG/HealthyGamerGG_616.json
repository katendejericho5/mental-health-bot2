    "transcript": "the decision to be independent and not\nrely on something someone else's help is\nthe height of privilege I get to choose\nthe terrifying thing and even after I\nhad made that choice it wrecked me for\nthree days despite all of my resilience\nand all of my yogic training and all of\nmy meditation smacked to the ground and\nI still had a safety net I can only\nimagine what life is like if you do not\nhave that safety net and you don't get\nto make the choice you're just getting\nbodied left and right by your material\ncircumstances security is the foundation\nof mental health and so if you all are\nlike struggling like I hear it and I\nthink that like that's what's so\nchallenging right is everyone's like oh\nlike work on your mental health and it's\nlike yeah and like you should do that\nand that's really important but like\nlet's be honest going to see a therapist\ndoesn't necessarily get you a place to\nlive it doesn't necessarily find you\nsomeone who loves you it doesn't\nnecessarily give you Independence it\ndoesn't give you purpose it helps it's a\ngreat starting point a lot of people who\nare starting from Square zero"
