    "transcript": "if you're feeling overwhelmed you don't\nactually need to fix the problems that\nmake you feel overwhelmed because\noftentimes those problems are completely\nout of your control what you actually\nneed to do is pick a completely\ndifferent set of problems but you need\nto pick it and as you start to work on\nthose you'll see a cognitive shift\nbecause literally the equation in your\nmind is if active challenges outweigh\npassive challenges I feel in control but\nif passive challenges outweigh active\nchallenges then I feel overwhelmed and\nI'm unable to take action so you don't\nneed to conquer the feeling of\noverwhelmed at all you just need to\ndisarm it or unplug it by paradoxically\ntaking on different challenges"
