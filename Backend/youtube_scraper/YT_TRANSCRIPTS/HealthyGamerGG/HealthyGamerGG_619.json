    "transcript": "a healthy mind does not exist simply\nwithin one body a healthy mind is really\nbuilt through relationships and if we\nsort of look at Humanity like we're kind\nof tribal right so a lot of our mental\nwell-being comes from outside of us and\none of those social creatures absolutely\nand one of the most devastating things\nis that even when I make kind of content\nright where people like how do I fix\nthis the really scary thing is that I'm\nnot sure that the way that problems are\nfixed can solely be done by you and in\nfact I wonder if we've actually done\npeople a huge disservice by telling them\nhey if you are mentally ill this is\nsomething for you to fix because then\nwhat happens is that it sort of places\nthe responsibility on them and I think\neveryone has some degree of\nresponsibility but then if you fall\nshort then it becomes your fault again\nwhich can then you know repeat the cycle\nand push the narrative that you believe\neven further into you right which is\nthat you're to blame yes"
