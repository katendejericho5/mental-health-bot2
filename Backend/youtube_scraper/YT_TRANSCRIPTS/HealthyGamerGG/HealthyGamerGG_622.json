    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nsuccessfully deal with feeling\n[Music]\noverwhelmed and a lot of people think\nthat if I'm overwhelmed I need to\novercome that feeling I need to use\nstrength or willpower or discipline to\njust get over it and if I'm mentally\nstronger I can conquer the feeling of\nbeing overwhelmed as it turns out you\ndon't need to do that and in fact\nthere's actually a really in way to\nunplug the feeling or disarm it or kind\nof make it go away on its own in order\nto understand how to do that we have to\nunderstand how the mind feels\noverwhelmed in the first place and it\nmay not be quite what you think so the\nfeeling of being overwhelmed comes from\na relationship between passive\nchallenges and active challenges now\nwhat does that mean so a passive\nchallenge is something that you were\nchallenged with that you did not choose\nso when life throws you difficulties\nthose are passive challenges and often\ntimes this is what makes us feel\noverwhelmed because there are too many\nthings that are outside of our control\nand when life is sending us a bunch of\nstuff that are outside of our control we\ncan't fix them if we can't fix them we\nfeel overwhelmed there's another kind of\nchallenge though which is something\ncalled an active Challenge and an active\nchallenge is a challenge that you choose\nto take so if you set a goal for\nyourself and you decide to move towards\nit that's an active challenge is it\ndifficult yes but you are choosing the\ndifficulty now here's the really key\nthing what a lot of people think is that\nbeing overwhelmed is the sum of the\nchallenges that you face if I'm feeling\nmore challenged or there more things\nthat I'm dealing with I must feel\noverwhelmed that is actually incorrect\nyour mind feels overwhelmed when your\npassive challenges outweigh your active\nchallenges so another way to kind of\nthink about that is when you are dealing\nwith more things that you chose not to\ndeal with as opposed to the things that\nyou chose to deal with this is when you\nfeel overwhelmed it's not the total sum\nof challenge it's are you dealing with\nmore things that you chose to deal with\nor things that you didn't choose to deal\nwith I'd like to take a moment to thank\ntoday's sponsor Milano as a psychiatrist\nit's incredibly important for me to stay\norganized not only for my patients but\nalso for things like YouTube videos and\nthat's where milanote comes in milanote\nis an easy to use tool that helps me\norganize my ideas and channel my\ncreativity using visual boards and what\nI love about milanote is that allows me\nto collect information like clip images\nfrom the internet as well as plan tasks\nin the exact same place and even take\nnotes it's also really cool that\nmilanote has over a 100 built-in\ntemplates that make it easy for me to\ncreate resources for my patience or\nstoryboard my next YouTube video it's\nalso really cool that milanote exists\neverywhere that I want it to be there's\na desktop app for it there's a mobile\napp for it so even when I'm browsing my\nphone if I see something really\ninteresting I can clip it and stick it\nright into milanote and the best part is\nthat milanote is free with no time limit\nso if you're ready to take your\norganization and creativity to the next\nlevel check out the link in the\ndescription below and get started with\nyour next creative project with milanote\ntoday now this can feel seem kind of\nconfusing because it sort of feels like\nokay well if life is throwing me lots of\nstuff I can't choose to take on other\nchallenges like I'm not going to take on\nother problems if I can't deal with the\nproblems that I have already which is\nexactly the problem when we do that when\nwe give up our active challenges then\nthe ratio of passive challenges to\nactive challenges actually goes up we\nhave way more passive challenges because\nwe're cutting out things that we want\nand this actually reinforces the feeling\nof overwhelmed and this is how we end up\ngetting stuck and so we sort of\ndiscovered that the solution to this may\nseem completely counterintuitive which\nis to actually increase the number of\nactive challenges in your life and if\nyou're skeptical of that it makes\nperfect sense because it is\ncounterintuitive but there's actually\nreally good data to back this up and we\nkind of discovered this principle in the\nmost bizarre place which is with eating\ndisorders and you may start to wonder\nokay what does that have to do with\nanything that we're talking about so\nclinicians made a really interesting\nobservation that the more out of control\nsomeone's life is the more disordered\ntheir eating becomes so if you take\nsomeone with an eating disorder and you\nhospitalize them against their will and\nyou sort of let's say they get\nhospitalized for an addiction problem\nwhat you'll sort of find is that now\nthat I can't control my usage my Eating\nDisorders actually get worse another\nsituation is that when people with\neating disorders get into a emotionally\nneglectful situation or their parents\nare very controlling their disordered\neating gets worse and as we worked with\nthese people what we sort of discovered\nis as they lose control in other parts\nof their life what they do to avoid\nfeeling overwhelmed is to start to\nreally control their eating so they make\nthat challenge of eating so great that\nit gives them a sense of control in life\nand it sort of protects against the\nfeeling of being overwhelmed and so we\nkind of discovered something really\ninteresting and this also kind of\nexplains why disordered eating is so bad\nthe more out of control my life becomes\nthe more difficult the challenge that I\nput on myself the more I'm going to eat\nlike two leaves of lettuce and I'm going\nto eat very few calories and I'm going\nto torture myself but even though the\nchallenge becomes harder and harder and\nharder it gives me a sense of control\nand counteracts the feeling of\noverwhelmed and it's not only in eating\ndisorders that we've sort of discovered\nthis we kind of have applied this to\ntreatments for depression so there's a\ntreatment for depression called\nbehavioral activation and the way that\nthis works is kind of like okay I'm\ndepressed because there are all these\nthings that I can't control right people\ndon't like me I don't have a job I don't\nhave a romantic partner I have no\nprospects in life and so we kind of feel\nlike okay I can't fix all these problems\nso I'm depressed and so what clinicians\nactually figured out is we can do\nsomething called behavioral activation\nwhich is we have to get this person to\nchallenge themselves in any T tiny minor\nway and if they can start to activate\ntheir behavior and challenge themselves\nin some way I'm going to get up I'm\ngoing to clean the dishes I'm going to\ndo my laundry that somehow that helps\nthem gain control of their life and\nactually causes the depression to go\ninto remission and this doesn't make any\ncognitive sense right let's like\nacknowledge that for a second because if\nyou're in the mind of that depressed\nperson and you're thinking to yourself\ndoing the dishes doesn't make a\ndifference because I'm alone I don't\nhave a job or I'm in a dead-end job\ndoing the dishes doesn't actually fix\nthose problems and so that's the reason\nthat we don't do the dishes in the first\nplace but what we sort of have figured\nout scientifically is that by doing the\ndishes by fixing problems that are not\nthe problems that overwhelm us it\nactually makes us feel less overwhelmed\nnow I'm taking control of over my life\nand this becomes really really important\nbecause once I stop feeling overwhelmed\nthen I can start to tackle those other\nproblems and this is also something that\nwe really have to Tunnel down into for a\nsecond let's just play this tape through\nthere are things outside of my control I\ndon't have any control in life therefore\nI feel overwhelmed if I feel overwhelmed\nhow capable do you think I am at\ntackling those problems being\noverwhelmed in the first place\nhamstrings us because our mind is\ntelling us all the time you can't fix\nthis this is out of your control this\nproblem is too big this problem is too\nbig this problem is too big and so this\nis where being overwhelmed becomes kind\nof a self-fulfilling prophecy where once\nour passive challenges rise and we start\nto feel overwhelmed then we engage in\navoidance behaviors and the cycle\nrepeats itself so interestingly enough\nthe answer to that problem it is\nactually unplugging the feeling of being\noverwhelmed and the way that we stop\nfeeling overwhelmed is to actually\nincrease our Challenge in a completely\nunrelated area and once we increase our\nchallenges in a completely unrelated\narea we increase those active challenges\nas we increase those active challenges\nand we start to work on those things our\nmindset changes now we feel confident in\nourselves we feel in control and now\nthose very same problems that used to\nfeel overwhelming now we have the\nconfidence to deal with them and so\nsounds really bizarre in\ncounterintuitive but if you're feeling\noverwhelmed you don't actually need to\nfix the problems that make you feel\noverwhelmed because often times those\nproblems are completely out of your\ncontrol what you actually need to do is\npick a completely different set of\nproblems but you need to pick it and as\nyou start to work on those you'll see a\ncognitive shift because literally the\nequation in your mind is if active\nchallenges outweigh passive challenges I\nfeel in control but if passive\nchallenges outweigh active challenges\nthen I feel overwhelmed and I'm unable\nto take action so you don't need to\nconquer the feeling of overwhelmed at\nall you just need to disarm it or unplug\nit by paradoxically taking on different\nchallenges"
