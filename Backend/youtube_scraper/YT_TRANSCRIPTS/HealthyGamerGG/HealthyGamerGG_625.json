    "transcript": "and so if AI can ever cross the barrier\nof substituting for a therapist what\nthis fundamentally means is we have now\ntrained a computer or an artificial\nintelligence to replace an actual human\nbeing in a relationship context and if\nwe ever cross that barrier I think what\nwe should be worried about is way more\nthan making a job obsolete because if an\nAI can actually substitute for a human\nbeing it'll be able to substitute for\nhuman beings in other kinds of\nrelationships like friendships maybe\neven parental relationships maybe even\nromantic relationships and the really\nfunny thing is that this is actually\nalready starting to happen with this\nconcept like waifus there are some human\nbeings out there who have relationships\nwith imaginary or virtual people they'll\ngo on dates with their waifu and so what\nI'm really concerned about is if AI ever\nreplaces human beings in relationships I\nliterally don't know what's going to\nhappen to the human race"
