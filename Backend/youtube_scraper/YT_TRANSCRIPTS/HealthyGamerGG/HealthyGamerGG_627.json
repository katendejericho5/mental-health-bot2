    "transcript": "everyone today is talking about the\nimpact of AI on various Fields including\nmental health and people are asking the\nquestion can an AI do therapy in my\nopinion is absolutely yes\nand then there's another interesting\nquestion though which is can an AI\nreplace therapists and to that my answer\nis actually probably not and you may be\nthinking for a second hold on a second\nif a AI can do therapy how can it not\nreplace therapists in order to\nunderstand how an AI can do therapy and\nat the same time not replace therapists\nwe have to understand how therapy\nactually works and we're going to start\nwith sort of a historical framework so\nlet's remember that therapy is built on\nthe foundation of something called\npsychoanalysis which was done by people\nlike Sigmund Freud and Jung and\nessentially what they would do is have\ntheir patients lay down on the couch and\nthey would sit behind them and the\npatients would do something called free\nassociate which is just basically think\nout loud in the psychoanalyst would say\nvery little and they would do this for\nabout one hour a day so you basically go\ninto the office you lay down and you\njust talk about whatever kind of things\npop into your head and the analyst is\nsitting behind you and like just paying\nattention and eventually what they would\ndo is come to these ideas about what's\ngoing on in your subconscious they would\ntranslate all this random crap you were\nsaying in sort of formulate okay this\nperson has this kind of problem in their\nsubconscious and then they would sort of\nwork on that in some way and then\npresumably this person would get better\nif this sounds like it's kind of a load\nof crap\nother people sort of agreed with that as\nwell including the behaviorists so the\nbehaviorists came along and they were\nlike hey all this crap with the\nsubconscious sounds like BS and at the\nend of the day like whatever is\nhappening in the unconscious is not\nnearly as important as what people\nactually do and instead of Plumbing the\ndepths of the unconscious what we should\ndo is help people change their behavior\nand this sort of idea evolved into\nsomething called cognitive behavioral\ntherapy which isn't concerned with the\nsubconscious what it's concerned with is\nthe relationship between our thoughts\nthe things that we think our feelings\nour emotions and our behavior and if we\nwork on these three components we can\nhelp human beings and we did a bunch of\nresearch on both of these things and we\nfound that they're basically both\neffective and so then what happened is\ntherapists were trying to figure out\nokay these things are fundamentally\ndifferent one is fixing your unconscious\nwhich will then result with natural\nchanges to your thoughts your emotions\nyour behaviors whatever\nand over here you've got a different\nCamp who's like forget about the\nunconscious let's just fix thoughts or\nemotions and behaviors and so which one\nis better and so as we started to study\nall of this stuff what we basically\nfound is that all of these things are\nequally effective which really confuse\npeople because these are fundamentally\ndifferent things and so then what we did\nis we tried to figure out okay if these\nthings are all equally effective what's\ngoing on here and what we stumbled upon\nis this concept of common factors that\nif you look at progress within therapy\nit doesn't really have anything to do\nwith a particular methodology it comes\ndown to certain relationship aspects so\ndo you trust your therapist do you\nbelieve your therapist can help you does\nyour therapist actually listen to you is\nyour therapist somewhat non-judgmental\ndo they challenge you at the right times\ndo they have some kind of framework that\nthey can share with you to help you\nunderstand your problems and essentially\nthe value of therapy has to do not with\nthe the methodologies of therapy but\nrather with the actual relationship you\nhave with your therapist and this is\nkind of what we concluded that the\ncloser you are with your therapist the\ntighter y'all's relationship is the\nbetter you will get and so we thought we\nhad figured it out that basically it has\nto do with the relationship of the\ntherapist but then something else\nhappened as we developed more\nsophisticated cognitive behavioral\ntherapy protocols like on week one we're\ngoing to do this on week two we're going\nto do this on week three we're going to\ndo this kind of exercise and a good\nexample of this is something like\nprocrastination so if you struggle with\nprocrastination is procrastination a\nthought a behavior or a feeling is it an\nemotion you're kind of scratching your\nhead you're kind of thinking well it's\nkind of all of the above right I engage\nin some avoidance behaviors I feel some\nemotions and I have particular thoughts\nand that's exactly how CBT Works what\nCBT does is it takes this problem like\nprocrastination and breaks it down into\nthese individual components and then you\ncan Target those individual components\nand thereby reduce the procrastination\nso we essentially developed protocols\nfor these kinds of things and the more\nprotocolized we got the more it became\nweek one week two week three the more\npeople started to think okay if this is\na protocol do you actually need a human\nto do it can a computer run a patient\nthrough the protocol and Achieve good\nresults and so we started studying\nsomething called computerized CBT which\nis essentially cognitive behavioral\ntherapy delivered by a computer or a\nprogram\nand this is what was kind of bizarre is\nwe started studying CBT it seemed to be\nvery effective and some studies even\nfound that CBT or computerized CBT was\njust as effective as CBT administered by\na therapist and so this should be kind\nof confusing right because we discovered\nfrom common factors research that it has\nto do with a human and we looked at\nthese computerized CBT trials and we\nsort of discovered okay you don't\nactually need a human so which is it and\nnow we really start to understand that\ntherapy is two different things so one\npart of therapy is sort of helping\npeople understand their mind it's\nproviding them with a framework a\ncertain amounts of knowledge or even\ntools or skill sets that can help them\nwith their mind and this is sort of\nresponsible for half of the effect of\ntherapy the other part of therapy seems\nto be something that's a little bit more\nempathic or sort of forming a human\nconnection and by having trust in a\nhuman being it sort of activates all of\nthis empathic circuitry that sort of\nhelps us heal helps us sort of\nunderstand ourselves in a different way\nwhen a therapist treats us in a\nnon-judgmental and compassionate way we\nsort of integrate that into ourselves\nand we change for example our self\ndialogue so when someone treats us with\ncompassion we learn self-compassion and\nthat's a little bit different from\nteasing apart or breaking apart how\nprocrastination is thoughts emotions and\nbehaviors and so these are kind of the\ntwo elements of therapy and so now we\ncan begin to see how an AI may be able\nto do therapy like it may be able to run\nhuman beings through a CBT protocol and\nit may be very successful at helping\nhuman beings tease apart how\nprocrastination is thoughts behaviors\nand emotions and these are three\ndifferent things and we can tackle them\nindividually and at the same time it may\nnot be able to replace a therapist\nbecause I don't think an AI has reached\nthe point of actually substituting for\nhuman connection and so a lot of\ntherapists are really concerned about\nbeing placed by AI this is a big concern\nfor a lot of people out there right can\nmy job be done by an artificial\nintelligence but in my opinion that's\nnot actually the biggest problem the\nbiggest problem is not whether an AI can\ndo a job the really tricky thing is that\nif an AI can substitute for a therapist\nwhat that means is AI has crossed a\nfundamental barrier at this point the AI\nis not doing a job at this point an AI\nis a replacement for a human and so if\nAI can ever cross the barrier of\nsubstituting for a therapist what this\nfundamentally means is we have now\ntrained a computer or an artificial\nintelligence to replace an actual human\nbeing in a relationship context and if\nwe ever cross that barrier I think what\nwe should be worried about is way more\nthan making a job obsolete because if an\nAI can actually substitute for a human\nbeing it'll be able to substitute for\nhuman beings in other kinds of\nrelationships like friendships maybe\neven parental relationships maybe even\nromantic relationships and the really\nfunny thing is that this is actually\nalready starting to happen it's actually\nstarted to happen many years ago with\nthis concept like waifus there are some\nhuman beings out there who have\nrelationships with imaginary or virtual\npeople they'll go on dates with their\nwaifu they'll even sometimes like\nhave some kind of robot or like physical\npartner that can sort of gratify them\nsexually we sort of know that there are\nvirtual reality kind of girlfriends out\nthere that are sort of programs or AIS\nthat you can kind of go on Virtual dates\nwith and so what I'm really concerned\nabout is if AI ever replaces human\nbeings in relationships I literally\ndon't know what's going to happen to the\nhuman race and so this is an area where\ntheoretically I'm an expert but honestly\nI can't predict the future any better\nthan you can and so we'd love to hear\nfrom you about what you think about this\nproblem would you actually want an AI to\nreplace a therapist hell let's think\nabout this for a second if we could\ntrain an AI to be me a duplicate of Dr K\nthat was accessible to you is that\nsomething that you would actually want\nor do you think this is the kind of\nthing where that would be one step on\nthe road to disaster and that's what's\nso scary about this right because if\nwe're sort of thinking about it and I've\nthought about this recently do I want to\ntry in an AI to be me maybe I could help\nso many people but are we actually\nmoving in the wrong direction by\ncreating things that seem to be good for\nus so please let us know what you think\nand honestly what you say may help us\nhelp inform us about like whether we\nactually create a Dr K AI or not\nforeign\n[Music]"
