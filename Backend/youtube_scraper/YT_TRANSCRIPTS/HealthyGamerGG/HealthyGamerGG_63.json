    "transcript": "so now let's talk about mix signals the\nmain thing is just simply to identify\nwhat the different parts of your\nemotions are telling you because this is\nalso true like this is good it's not a\nbad thing to have mixed emotional\nsignals it's very healthy to have them\nbecause life is not one-dimensional\nright when someone says I love you\nthat's not just a good thing there are\nall kinds of problems that can come with\nI love you there can be warning bells in\nyour mind these are good things not bad\nthings and so then just simply try to\nnotice what you are feeling right okay\nlike I'm feeling mixed about this and\nyou can even take a piece of paper and\nyou can write it down and the reason\nthat paper is good is because it's hard\nto analyze a thought in your head\nbecause you can usually only think about\nyou can really only think about one\nthing at a time so you can have the\nthought or you can analyze the thought\nand if it's in your head when you\nanalyze the thought the thought itself\nwill disappear where it's easy to\nanalyze what is on paper because then\nthe paper is holding the thought itself"
