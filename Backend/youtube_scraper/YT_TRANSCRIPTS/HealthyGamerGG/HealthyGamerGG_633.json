    "transcript": "I'm I'm tempted to ask you a personal\nquestion I go knock yourself out\nwhatever you want I mean so so you know\nI'm just curious about how you you're\nyou're thinking about this thing and I'm\nwondering like are you terrified that\nyou're gonna have to oh 40 year old\nStephen or 45 year old Stephen is going\nto be looking back and thinking\noh like what are the mistakes that I\nmade now\num yeah kind of but like this is a this\nis one of those uh balancing acts so on\none sense you know people ask me\nsometimes my fans will be like oh like\nyou should write a book on something\nit's like why would I put anything I\nbelieve right now onto paper when in\nthree years I'm probably gonna think\nabout everything I was you know stupid\nso in one sense yeah I kind of think\nabout that but then in another sense I\nwould think if I looked back five years\nfrom now and I was the exact same person\nI'd be worried that I'd stop growing you\nknow that would be a concern of mine so\nwhat I what I the way that I try to\nthink right now is I I only want to take\na strong position on something that I\nfeel incredibly grounded in and for\neverything else I just want to leave\nmyself open to change there are like I\nthink there are like four or five like\nthings politically where it's like these\nare things that are true and I'm\nprobably never gonna move off these and\nI never have\num but for everything else I I try not\nto be so merry like I'll try to Cavite\neven I feel like you know socialized\nmedicine is very important in the United\nStates we need this you know unless\ntheir studies showing otherwise right I\njust I try to try to get my mind open so\nI'm like open to changing the future\nyeah it sounds like you're reluctant to\nwrite a book because something will be\nset in stone\nI feel like a lot of people when I see\nso I've existed on the internet for like\n13 years now\num and and I think part of my continued\nsuccess is that I'm able to kind of like\nadapt and change as like society and\ntime goes on while still holding on to\nsomething that is important or something\nthat makes me me I'm not just like new\narea totally new person but there's\nstill like that core thing of me there\nand then there's moving through time\num something that gets scary for me is\nI'll see especially because I do\npolitical stuff right I'll see political\nfigures that have been in a polit like\nif you joined a political org and then\nyou've got a stake in that political org\nand then you start doing content with\nthat political org you have it feels\nlike you've robbed yourself of the\nability to grow right like let's say\ntomorrow\num Ben Shapiro wakes up and he has an\nepiphany and he's like you know what I\nactually think that government\nentitlement programs and Welfare are\nprobably one of the most important\nthings in the United States could he\neven say that publicly it would probably\ndestroy him to do it\num would he even be able to feel that\nthere's probably some degree of\nideological and audience capture going\non where it's like well I'm a\nconservative I don't know if I should\nthink that this is probably wrong I'm\nstupid like my audience is going to hate\nme for it\num so yeah that's that's something that\nI kind of I see some people who will\nlike I am the Socialist I am the\ncapitalist I am the libertarian and then\nthey get so locked into that phase that\nthey've robbed themselves of even have\nthe opportunity to grow change as they\nget older\nuh so I politics is not my area of\nexpertise but I'm really curious so I\nheard about this tweet that Ann Coulter\ndid where she was like talking about\nabortion rights or something I don't\neven know the details it's like third\nhand do you know what I'm talking about\nno but I've probably seen it as Ann coul\nJones about abortion what do you think\nit says\num well I I mean she was like she was\nthe original staunch like lady kind of\nlike [ __ ] conservative lady so I\nimagine for a long period of life she\nwas Ultra super against it has that\nopinion changed recently or\nyeah\nI'm just I'm Googling this now to see\nwhat it is sorry I don't know why I'm\nGoogling it you could just tell me yeah\nI mean I don't know the details of what\nshe said but she was talking about how\nlike this is like where abortion the\nRestriction of abortion rights in\nAmerica has like gone too far or\nsomething I don't know what the oh I\njust saw this on April 5th she said\nplease stop pushing strict limits on\nabortion or there will be no Republicans\nleft is it this tweet yeah I think I\nprobably uh-huh what do you think about\nthat\num I think it's absolutely true I've\nalways said that there are like I think\nthat there are two big issues that um\nthe political parties have right now\nwhere if they could just loosen up on\nthem they would get a whole bunch of\nfollowers for Republicans I feel like\nthey need to drop the ultra strict\nabortion thing and just concede that\nlike abortion from like first trimester\nat least is okay and it would just open\ntheir base up so much and for Democrats\nit's the obsession over guns they just\nneed to like leave the AR-15s alone\nthey're you they're very sparingly used\nin shootings and it would open them up\nto a whole bunch of like new people but\nthose are like two issues that both\nsides are really dug in on and they lose\nI think a lot of political Capital over\nboth of them yeah but the abortion thing\nis a really big one for republicans and\nit like motivates the hell out of\nDemocrats to go to the polls and vote\nand so what do you think about her kind\nof saying her more recent tweet\nwell I mean that just sounded like\npolitical strategy to me I don't know if\nthat was like reflecting like personal\ngrowth you know\nwell so because because what I'm kind of\ncurious about is why do you think that\npolitical parties can't grow right\nbecause you're sort of saying if you\njoin a if you join let's say like a a\npolitically oriented content creation\nengine\nthat that sort of staunches your growth\nwhereas one of the things that I've been\nsuper curious about is like why can't\npeople change their minds like we talk\nabout changing your mind as a politician\nas the biggest sin that you can you can\ncommit what do you think that is\nI feel like people\num this is something that I try to keep\nin mind\num I'm gonna play a little bit of a\nlanguage game here but it captures an\nidea\num I am a person that likes capitalism\nbut I'm not like a capitalist or I might\nbe a person that plays PC games but I'm\nnot a PC Gamer I think that people will\ntake the ideas and rather than them\nhaving a strong identity that like\nconnects to these ideas those ideas are\nkind of absorbed into the identity and\nthey become part of the identity and\nwhen something is part of your identity\nit becomes very very very hard to change\nthat without feeling really bad about\nyourself I I tend to believe that people\nhave almost completely binary opinions\nof themselves like you're either\ncompletely good or completely bad it's\nvery hard to accept any fault in\nyourself without it having a lot of\ncognitive dissonance\nI think that's where things like Health\nat every size comes from right like I\ncan't like love myself if I also accept\nthat there's like an issue with my\nweight so the weight thing actually\nisn't a big deal at all you know and I\nthink with um with politics I think it's\nsimilar where you you're not just like a\nperson who is a republican you are a\nrepublican that is who you are you don't\njust have Republican ideas you are this\nthing and so to change your mind on it\nbecomes very very difficult because it's\nlike recognizing and then expelling a\nfault within yourself I think that's my\nfeeling on it interesting yeah that\nmakes a lot of sense\num you know my the only thing I would\nadd to that is that I think that that\nquality is actually quite fluctuate\nso if you look at this is more from\nEastern psychology but the more black\nand white and identified with a\nparticular quality you are correlates\nwith the amount of emotion that you feel\nespecially negative emotion\nokay so even if you ask\npeople of Die Hard political parties if\nyou can engage them in a calm discussion\nor anyone who has strongly held beliefs\nthis has been my experience anyway that\nif you can engage them in a calm\ndiscussion they themselves so this is\nlike literally what we do in addiction\nPsychiatry and motivational interviewing\nis you've got someone who's in denial\nI'm not an alcoholic so this is an ego\nthing\nyou know they don't think about alcohol\naddiction as a disease or whatever they\nsay I am not a alcoholic so there's\nthere's an aspect of ego that arises and\nthis is the identification that you're\ntalking about and the really interesting\nthing about ego is ego arises anytime\nyou have negative emotion as a defensive\nmechanism to protect you from pain so\nwhen someone says hey you just wrecked\nour car or you were driving with the\nkids drunk they could have died\nthat thought is painful and thus the ego\narises and tries to protect you from it\nby denying the really interesting thing\nabout disarming that is that if you can\nremove the negative emotion from the\nequation people are actually able to\nadmit their mistakes\nand one of the things that I'm just you\nknow noticing is that in in our current\nSociety if you make a mistake anyone who\ndisagrees with you and this is kind of\nwhat you were saying about you know you\ncan't get away with what you did 10\nyears ago if you make a single mistake\nlike we don't let people make mistakes\nanymore we just you know I I think that\npersonify them yeah absolutely and you\ncan't ever admit that you were wrong\nyeah real quick it's so funny something\nthat you said about this I'm sure a lot\nof the therapy techniques everything you\nlearn can probably be um uh can Pro you\ncan probably find them in police\ninterrogations too do you ever watch any\nof these interrogation videos I've seen\nsome of these yeah that thing you just\nsaid about removing negative emotion to\nget somebody to kind of admit a mistake\nit's a very important interrogation\ntactic if you've got a criminal that's\ndone something bad\num in your an interrogation you're not\ngoing to sit there and say didn't you\nkill him didn't you kill him didn't you\nkill him usually as their interrogator\nyou're going to try to build up a lot of\nlike they were really unfair to you\nweren't they like you know you probably\nwanted to hit that guy because like who\nwouldn't like anybody would want to hit\nhim in that circumstance like it was\ntotally unfair for you like I would\nprobably attack right you're removing\nthe negative uh emotion related to like\nor rather like the Judgment from them\nadmitting something bad and it's like\nyou're kind of like building a rapport\nwith them there and then it gets people\nmore freely in those interrogation rooms\nto admit their mistakes it's just funny\nthat you said it that way because I\nremember in the videos where a couple do\nthat and then the person will start\nvolunteering information because they\ndon't feel like there's like any\nnegative judgment anymore so yeah yeah I\nmean I think it's about building an\nalliance is the broader idea of what we\nwould talk about you know and I saw\nthere was a video recently where there's\nsomeone who's being reviled by the\ninternet because they were in a DUI and\npeople are just stunned by the level of\ndenial and it's like well when you're\naccusatory and stuff like that people\nare just gonna do weird psychological\nstuff but yeah I wish I it's so hard are\nyou talking about the woman that was in\nthe room or something different I'm not\nsure but I tend not to comment on\nspecific people I just know that's fine\nyeah I would something that I try to I\ntry to get people to understand this all\nthe time even when I'm arguing with\npeople and I hang up a call and my chat\nwill be like oh why are they so stupid\nwhy didn't they just admit they were\nblah blah blah really really hard to\nadmit fault in the middle of a thing\num like I tell people like I'm probably\nnot gonna do it and I really I don't\nexpect anybody to do it usually if I'm\nhaving a conversation with somebody I'm\njust there to kind of like plant the\nseeds but it's very very very rare and\nit takes an exceptional human to be like\nyou know what I think I was wrong in\nthis circumstance generally people need\nto cool off and then hopefully whatever\nwords you left them with will start to\nlike take hold and then like there's\nlike a quiet admission later and then at\nsome point maybe like yeah I think\nyou're right about this you know but um\ngetting people to change their mind In\nthe Heat of the Moment is almost\nimpossible and nobody ever seems to\nrecognize that even though we all have\nthat problem every human being has that\nproblem you know yeah I mean I I\nthink we sort of understand that in the\nclinical World pretty well right even\nwhen we've got\nand and I I just wonder a little bit\nabout just the antagonistic\nrelationships of especially like\npolitics where it's like\npeople are just so at each other's\nthroats there's something that I have\njust this Instinct I have no idea if\nthis is right or wrong and this could be\nthe height of Dunning Kruger but that\nyou know if you kind of get people to\nsit down and like just have a Frank\ndiscussion with them where first of all\nyou try to understand their View\num which I think is is something that's\nvery very missing in today's society we\nall try to convince even then if you\nsort of think about it like we talk\nabout something you're good at right\ndebates debates are sort of the default\nway of discussing different views and\nthere's this idea that even in that\nframe there is a winner and a loser that\npeople don't\nI mean I guess this is hopefully a good\nexample I don't think I'm debating you\nabout anything but I think we're either\num I don't think people of differing\nviews sit down and like have discussions\nfor the purpose of like learning\nsomething together or even trying to\nunderstand the other side it's about I'm\ngonna poke holes in this other person's\nargument because I'm right and they're\nwrong as opposed to hey this person\nbelieves something drastically different\nfrom what I what I do\nmaybe I need to learn something because\nthis really makes no sense\num yeah I mean I I super agree\num one of the things that I kind of\npushed for a lot in in conversations is\nlike to just understand why a person\nfeels the way they do\num what like there's like one truth that\nI've kind of like stumbled upon that I\nfeel very strongly about I don't think\nI'll ever change my mind on it is um\npeople can be people's feelings\nsometimes can be very irrational but\npeople's feelings are never ever ever\nrandom like they always feel something\nfor a reason and I think it's important\nto figure out why they feel the way they\ndo right somebody might be incredibly\nracist or incredibly sexist or\nincredibly whatever and it might be like\neven the way they like well I think that\nanytime I run into this type of person\nit's going to be in trouble it's like\nthat's not a rational belief that's not\ntrue like we the data the stats blah\nblah blah but it's important to\nrecognize well why do you feel that way\nbecause that feeling didn't come from\nnowhere so it's either the type of media\nthey're consuming it's some experiences\nthey've had it's things they've been\ntold by family or friends and it's\nreally important to identify that\nparticular thing to understand why that\nperson feels that way because a lot of\npeople go into some of these\nconversations and send me like oh well\nthe reason why we disagree is obviously\nbecause this guy is evil and it's like\nwell no I mean it's probably not evil\nthere's probably a reason why he\ndisagrees with you you know so so I'm a\nlittle bit confused why do you say that\nemotions are rational\num I'm sorry when I'm saying rational I\nmean like in the uh like let's say\nsomebody says that um there's a minority\nthat they see on TV so they think well\nanytime I run into that person I'm\nprobably gonna get robbed we would say\nthat like that's in a way that's like\nirrational because statistically\nspeaking this is probably not going to\nhappen\num the the feeling itself I guess isn't\nirrational because it's built on some\nparticular thing but like the way that\nthat belief manifests in the world like\nthe outcome that you think is going to\nhappen that's not very rational yeah but\nthe feeling is the feeling is there for\na reason it's important to identify why\nthe feeling is there yeah so I mean I I\nwould I would kind of\nI think we're saying the same thing but\nI would I think it's a little bit more\nsemantics but I think even for what you\njust said if there's a reason for them\nto feel that way which can be deduced\nright that implies that there is\nrationality behind it and that's like\nliterally what we sort of know is that\nif people are experiencing an emotion if\nyou even look at something like a trauma\nresponse which is the textbook\ndefinition of an irrational response so\nif I hear a door slam I believe I am in\ndanger and that someone is trying to\nhurt me but that's not you may look at\nthat from an objective standpoint and\nsay that is irrational but actually like\nwhat we sort of know clinically is that\nthis is actually a completely rational\nbelief it has to do with the way that\nour brain processes information and the\nway that it attaches a certain\nassociations to particular stimuli and\neven when it comes to things like racism\nand stuff like that there's a really\ngood test which I think is publicly\navailable\num\nsome kind of perception test out of a\nlaboratory at Harvard that essentially\nmeasures how racist you are about the\nimplicit bias test yeah maybe it's\nimplicit biased us the really\ninteresting thing is that you know even\neven people of ethnic minorities are\nracist towards ethnic minorities because\nit's some of the way that we're\nconditioned\nyeah yeah I agree yeah"
