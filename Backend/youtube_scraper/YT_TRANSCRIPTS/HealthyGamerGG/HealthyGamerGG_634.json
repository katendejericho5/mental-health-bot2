YouTuber who has an\namazing Channel where he focuses on\ncommunication skills\num so I don't know if you all have seen\nCharisma on command but it's amazing so\nhe does such an in-depth analysis of\nvarious social interactions and I think\nis incredibly needed\num in today's world where I think that\nlike there's sort of this global social\nskills atrophy so we're going to be\ntalking to him a little bit about his\nperspective on\nmen's mental health dating and a couple\nof other topics so\num yeah we're super excited for that so\njust a reminder that mental health\nawareness month is May

things that we think are\ngoing to be the most impactful to y'all\nso we did a deep dive into understanding\ntrauma which I I think we got a lot of\npositive feedback on so you all are free\nto check that out\num last Friday we did a deep dive into\naddiction so how can you understand\naddiction as a process the addictive\npersonality we didn't go into a whole\nlot of details around particular\nsubstances but just what do you as a\nhuman being need to know about addiction\nsat stream was last Friday and then\num I think we're streaming this\nWednesday as well so stay tuned so we've\ngot a lot of great content kind of\ncoming out for y'all\num and we'll even have something from\nthe community that hopefully y'all will\nenjoy that'll be coming out later this\nmonth so stay

we were on steak and eggs\nrecently so we're traveling around this\nweekend we're going to be at the\nAmerican Psychiatric association\num doing some stuff there so stay tuned\nto that\nso we'll be traveling around to\ndifferent places and trying to help\npeople wherever they are\num so you know thank you to everyone\nwho's been a part of this community so\nfar y'all are the reason that we are\nwhere we are uh we really hope that\nwe've been able to be helpful to you and\nthat's really what we're focused on just\na couple of quick updates you know for\nthose of y'all that are interested in\nmore in-depth education like Beyond\nlet's say a 20 minute YouTube video\ncheck out Dr K's guide that's where a\nlot of our I would say like kind of\nTimeless information or perspectives is\nstored there so if y'all are looking for\na comprehensive approach to depression\nand that sort of includes clinical stuff\nbut also like spiritually like how to\nfind purpose in life how to deal with\nthings like existential problems that's\nall in the guide to depression there's a\nguide into anxiety which teaches us a\nlot about just how our mind functions\nour guide to ADHD and doing stuff which\nis about ADHD but also like doing stuff\nso what I tried to do there is figure\nout okay like everything that I've\nlearned about the Mind from seven years\nof training to become a monk plus\nbecoming a psychiatrist\nhow can we kind of reduce that to\ninformation about like how to understand\nbehavior and how to like get stuff done\nand then of course we have our\nmeditation guide for those of you all\nthat are interested in in-depth\nperspectives on meditation I think um\nthe ADHD and the the meditation guide\nare the most popular and so if you all\nare interested in more than what we can\nprovide let's say in one stream or one\nvideo that's to be found in the guide we\nalso have a lot of really cool community\nevents going on this month\num so kruthi our CEO did a\nan event last week on entrepreneurship\nwe've got a lot of other you know Social\nSandbox and these other kinds of things\nuh going on on Discord so check all that\nstuff out\nit's all free\num so

second year in a\nrow based on some of the outcomes from\nour coaching program\nso cool let's hop in with Charlie\nokay\nCharlie you ready\nalrighty\nlet's\nhello hello hello I do not see your\ncamera oh wait is it maybe it's me hold\non\nI don't see your camera that's the only\nthing\nbut we can move there we go\nall right hey man\nhow are you I'm doing great dude how are\nyou excellent on the meat let me put you\non I have a big screen in front of me\nlet me blow this up awesome\nall right now it's like real life yeah\ndude what's going on man not too much\nI'm very excited a little bit nervous I\nhave not done live streams in the past\nso this is a new thing for me yeah well\num you know I think it's just a\nconversation I think people are\noftentimes a little bit nervous at the\nbeginning but I think as we get into it\nI'm sure it'll be a good conversation\nyeah um can you just start off by\ntelling us a little bit about because I\nI don't I don't know that everyone knows\nwho you are I'm pretty sure most people\nare familiar with your content but can\nyou tell us just a little bit about what\nkind of content you make and what kind\nof you find interesting about it yeah so\num the the most recent thing is I'm\nactually not very involved with Charisma\ncommand but what I started with that\nyou're definitely referring to which I'm\nknown for on YouTube is charisma on\ncommand uh and that is a YouTube channel\nthat was birthed from my own shyness at\nthe time I was very introverted uh and\nfelt that I missed the memo on how to\ncomfortably interact with other people\nand so approached it in kind of an\nanalytical way okay and then shared that\non the internet so what that looks like\nif you might have seen our videos or\nheard my voice is I take some of the\nmost popular people out there a lot of\nthe Marvel actors sometimes singers or\nathletes or that sort of thing and talk\nabout what it is that they're doing in\ntheir interviews and other videos where\npeople seem to find them you know\nfascinating confident connected all\nthose sorts of things\nyeah so so it started sorry let me just\nfix one thing real quick sure um I'm\ntrying to\nuh\noh\ngive me sorry about this there's one\ntechnical difficulty no sweat that we\nare trying to fix live\nand\nI'm gonna try again sorry about that\nokay\nGG\nI am so one of the things that we are\ngive me just one second\nthey're all good I I've uh this is why I\ndon't live stream but I've been in this\nposition before so I totally understand\nokay\nalmost done\n[Music]\nokay done\nI think\nokay good enough sorry about that so so\nit sounded like you started with uh um\nCharisma on command to kind of conquer\nyour shyness and then um so what are you\nup to now\nso I'm in between right now um the uh\ntrying to find the aligned next project\nand I've started with the podcast which\nis how we got in touch reached out to\nyou to have a conversation also have\nworked on the side on a Dungeons and\ndragon show uh which is literally right\nover here yeah total hard left turn but\nis very much in line with where I came\nfrom was the more reserved nerdy bookish\nguy uh and so we filmed two seasons now\none of which were in the midst of\nreleasing to a small audience uh which\nis Us in costume and accents playing\ndungeons wow dude and and what do you\nwhat do are you a player in in this d d\nshow are you like DM or what okay yes\nI'm a player though I I think actually\nwhat I'd like to do is learn to DM I\nlove\nthe collaborative storytelling and\nsetting up a playground for my friends\nto participate in is just a very\ngratifying experience so I've done a\nhandful of just off-camera DM things\nthat I've had a great time doing that's\nawesome man how long have you been\nplaying d d\nuh about a year and a half I think we\npicked it up around pandemic time we\nwere trying to find something to do that\nwas uh new and different and I could be\ndone inside without you know all of the\nin-person interaction uh and that was\nwhere we found Dungeons and Dragons and\nI it was a shame that it took me so long\nto you know because it was around when I\nwas a kid but I think I don't know it\nwas either too nerdy or had the\nreputation of being too nerdy that I\nnever gave it a chance but when I found\nit it just it connected in a huge way\nabsolutely man so I I play D D kind of\ngrowing up I was also a nerdy kid yeah\nand super shy and and really enjoyed it\nand it's it's interesting even now I\nrealized part of what I loved about\nbecoming a psychiatrist was that I\nreally like stories like I think that's\nthe one thing that I really enjoy about\nlife so I used to read a lot\num you know even in terms of like gaming\nand stuff like I liked stories I liked\nthe Cooperative storytelling aspect of d\nd yeah and um even with my kids now when\nwe do like bedtime and stories and stuff\nwell it'll be like a little bit\nCooperative where do they get to make\nchoice is about what they do I love that\nand so it's it's a lot of fun and and\nwhat I really love about being a\npsychiatrist is like hearing people's\nstories and like oftentimes they are far\nmore riveting than most of what you see\nin in fictional portrayals yeah yeah\nhave you uh played it all as an adult or\nhas that fallen off since you were a\nchild um so I've played eight times in\nthe last two years I would say we try\nheroically but as my friends and I have\ngotten older and had kids and things\nlike that it becomes harder to to meet\nup but we try sure yeah yeah no that's\nthe hardest thing is to get that Weekly\ngame going for a bunch of adults that\nhave different things but that's that is\nthough that honestly is the hardest part\nof getting a stream is to find five\npeople that can\ncommitment yeah that's cool man that's\nwhy that's awesome that's that's a\nreally big pivot I'm I'm really curious\nabout you want to tell us a little bit\nabout how you decided to do that or what\nwas going on sure\num yeah I was feeling burnt out of\nCharisma on command uh for a number of\nreasons one of which is that I didn't\nknow my this about myself at the time\nbut I when I feel most alignment is when\nI am\nwhat is uh fun for the audience and\neducational for the audience aligns with\nsomething that I am learning I really\nenjoy going from zero to one but I don't\nenjoy doing the sequel so if I was a\ndirector I would like making the first\nAvengers but not necessarily the second\nthe third Adventures I like figuring\nthings out for the first time and I felt\nthat I'd gotten to a place with Charisma\non command where I was applying the same\nanalytical filter to just new people\nevery week and that was losing\nuh I was losing connection with with the\nthing that got me there in the first\nplace as the business grew\num and so for a number of reasons one\nself-reflection but I've also had the\nGood Fortune to do some therapy in the\npast and have things like breath work\nmeditation I've done psychedelics and\nthose opportunities for deeper in a\nreflection uh connected me to the place\nthat Charisma on command was born from\nwas which was that Curiosity that\nlove of being on the edge and in the\npresent moment and Charisma on command\nhad gotten to a point where I was I\ncould I was doing it for memory I was\ndoing it not from this place of like\nCutting Edge present exploration but\nfrom I know how to do this this is old\nhat and so for that reason I needed to\nto find either a new angle on the\ncompany or something entirely new and I\ndecided to to just make that hard left\nturn yeah that's awesome man so can you\ntell us a little bit about I'm curious\nhave you had any experience with\nayurveda\num you know it's so funny my friend just\nbrought this up he told me that I was a\nvatapita yep you're absolutely\num and so I\na previous iteration of me would have\nbeen very skeptical of these uh\ndifferent kinds of modalities especially\nones that were older traditions of you\nknow what do they know but I find myself\nsincerely curious and I just just\nlearned that and I'm trying to find uh\nthe the more traditional wisdom all\nthose sorts of things I'm trying to\nincorporate so I would love to learn\nmore about it and and how you might\napply that to you know me or anything\nit's it's uh you have what what I would\ndescribe as a very classic problem of\nyeah you know your best work is an\nexploration and wrote stuff becomes very\nvery boring I'm also\num and so I I sort of have noticed the\nsame thing about myself that like doing\nthe same thing over and over and over\nagain gets boring and that I do my best\nwork when there's some amount of\ndifference or innovation\num and and I understand that so we\nreached out to you because we wanted to\ntalk a little bit about Men's Health and\npotentially like shyness and dating or\nis that I mean but it's not doesn't we\ndon't have to focus on those things\nuh I am so that I can do that again\nthat's all in me where I find that I'm\nmost interested is the newer mental\nhealth exploration but there is a\ncross-section between those two that I\nthink is uh we can we can probably find\nuh the things that led me towards the\nmore outward looking Men's Health dating\ncan I make women like me and how that\nhas evolved over the course of my life\ntoo how do I feel about myself and why\nwas I looking outside for some of that\nreflective validation that sounds\nperfect dude can you just tell us about\nthat Journey absolutely\num so it was very shy growing up and uh\nthat wasn't a problem for me because I\nhad my core group of friends until I I\nyou know hit puberty and I wanted girls\nto like me and that became a a pain\npoint and I also think I didn't know it\nat the time but that was there there's a\nweighing mechanism or can feel like\nyou're judged by your male peers\nsometimes by if you can get girls to\nlike you and that became sort of uh in\nsome ways\nan indicator of masculinity even from\nthat that adolescent age and so I didn't\nknow it at the time I think I had both\nsincere authentic desire to connect with\nwomen but also uh what does this reflect\nabout me and I became very curious and\ninterested in\num how can I be more outgoing can I be\nthe leader of this group of people what\ncan I do to get this girl to want to go\non a first or second date with me and so\nthat took me into the whole era of my\n20s uh which was\nreally extroverted outwardly focused\nwhere my Mantra was don't be yourself\nChoose Yourself and the wisdom that was\npresent there was I have these old\nhabits they are not reflective of who I\nam deep down because I'm just being shy\nall the time and I'd like to choose a\nmore outgoing engaged personality so\nthat I can connect with people I didn't\nknow it at the time but I was also\nprobably far too willing to not far too\nwilling was appropriate for that age but\nfor right now I was trying on a bunch of\ndifferent personalities and I didn't\nnecessarily have the discernment at the\ntime to know oh this one is core to who\nI am and this one is a bit of a\nperformance and so my 20s were amazing I\ntraveled the world I lived in multiple\ndifferent countries lived learned\ndifferent languages practiced Jiu Jitsu\ntraveled with a group my friends that\nwere really tight and built the business\nof Charisma on command\nand then towards the end of my 20s was\nin a relationship that ended and I was\nin heartache and I had suspected that\nhaving achieved everything I want the\nmillion subscribers on YouTube doing\nwell financially had a great group of\nfriends and and a girl that I liked but\nI was probably sadder than I'd ever been\nbefore after this breakup and that\nstarted a period of the last five six\nyears which has been\nokay I'm not going to go to the world to\ntry to meet every single need I'm not\ngoing to say hey I feel lonely let me go\nhang out with a person or hey I feel\nlike I'm lacking in status let me see if\nI can you know enter into this group uh\nwhere are those holes inside of me and\nso the last five or six years has been a\nrecapitulation and a deeper\nunderstanding of who I am why I behaved\nin some of the ways that I behave which\nwere not necessarily bad but I think\nwe're\nmotivated by a sense of lack and\nscarcity\num\nand trying to find a deeper inner peace\nconnectedness with myself from which I\ncan then go out into the world and like\noh there is a sincere extrovert in me\nbut it's not this forced extraversion\nthat I felt I had to do in order to be\nliked or outgoing or those sorts of\nthings so that's that's the broad\noverview of where I've been and within\nthat there's you know a million sub\nstories that we can dive into any one of\nyeah dude what an amazing journey man so\nit sounds it sounds very um\ndevelopmentally appropriate is the term\nthat I would use right so like shyness\nand then\num sort of sort of focus on the\nextroversion and then sort of being\nperformative and then recognizing like\nhey I'm trying to fill internal holes\nwith external things yeah yes and then\nthan therapy psychedelic spirituality\nand meditation for this phase right\ntotally I and I'm glad that you said\nthat because I can sometimes mistakenly\nsay I was doing it wrong back then or I\nshouldn't have done that and and really\nwhen I'm actually aware it's like that\nwas perfect or the phase of my life that\nit was I needed that experience I could\nnot have left from shy to grounded in\nmyself I needed to go out into the world\nto find that you know which of the needs\ncan I meet by interacting with other\npeople and which of them have to be met\nfrom inside of myself\num so I'm really happy that I have that\nphase I don't discourage people from\ndoing the types of things and the\nexploration that I did but just for me\nright now I'm so much more interested in\nthe inner World\num than you know what to say to get the\ngirl to like you or any of that kind of\nstuff and I'm happy that I have those\nvideos cataloged because if somebody\nasked me that question I could say hey I\ntalked about that\na couple years ago and this is where you\ncan sort of find that answer\nyeah so I wondered can I follow up on\none or two things yeah yeah so um you\nmentioned that you know part of this\nthis journey of Discovery has been sort\nof figuring out what's a part of your\ncore personality and what feels a little\nbit more like performance how do you\ntell the difference\noh well I've I never had this mechanism\nbefore at first it felt like everything\nis closed you try them on you do it like\nI had I don't know that I had a\nconnection with who I really was and\neven the shyness that I experienced as a\nkid was a bit of a cover for who you\nknow for what felt like me these days I\nfind myself from a felt energetic sense\nof connection with my gut and my heart\num and I it's when I'm aware for\ninstance of my butt against this couch\nand my belly and the breath in my belly\nthe words that come out are honest they\nare authentic to who I am\nbut when I can get into like this\nsometimes agitated sometimes nervous\nsometimes excited state I could come up\ninto my head\nand now I'm just saying things that sort\nof make sense uh but lack the you could\ncall it alignment or Integrity uh of\nconnection with with deeper parts of\nmyself\num and so that's like that that noticing\nhas been incredibly powerful for me uh\nand I would I had no mechanism of doing\nthat when I was younger and so when\npeople would say just be yourself I was\nlike oh man what lazy advice that is\ntotally inactionable and totally wrong\nbut I see the Deep wisdom in that though\nit is you know potentially very hard to\napply\nyeah so speaking of actionable stuff I\nmean it's can you tell us a little bit\nabout how you went from shy to being\nextroverted and kind of traveling and\nand building Charisma on command what\nwas that just like\nthat was so um I again didn't know it at\nthe time but it was uh did it with a\nbunch of close friends and there was\nwonderful pieces of that but there was\nalso elements of codependency so there\nwas a lot of like\num healthy pushing one another but we we\nformed a web of needing one another in a\nway that I think grew past healthiness\nbut that was necessary at that time in\nmy life so we had a group of of guys and\nthe Mantra was if something scares you\nbut is not dangerous you have to do it\nand so there was so like you know I want\nto go talk to that girl or there I'm at\na networking event and I admire that\nspeaker but I don't want to you know go\nup and tell them that I read their book\nand I appreciated it and that Mantra\nserved us incredibly well it opened up\ntons of opportunities The Rush that you\nget no matter how it goes with that\nperson is uh so affirming and makes you\nfeel like Superman you're like oh my\ngosh the world is such a uh is so much\nmore full of possibility abilities than\nI felt it was before so we had a couple\nof like you know rules about uh how we\nwould engage with the world and then\nafterwards we would discuss what went\nwell what didn't go well where did I get\nscrewed up\num and so we took that sort of mentality\nout into our lives uh eventually I read\nthe four hour work week and within that\nit was talking about finding where your\npassion meets a market need and the\npassion that I had was in understanding\nhow I could transform myself to be\nbetter like by men women alike and so\nthat was where Charisma and command\nstarted within that it had the idea of\nforming a muse business so that you\ncould travel the world and trying to\nretire early in life rather than saving\nthat traveling taking the middle of the\nday off doing nothing on a Wednesday for\n65 we said okay what if we could do this\nat 23 and I think at 24 I moved to\nBrazil we lived in Brazil Las Vegas\nVancouver Medellin Colombia traveled\naround and did all of this stuff with a\ngroup of friends in in those different\nplaces and so every day was uh Tim\nFerriss style optimized you know we had\nwe had all of our little sub goals that\nwe would hit social uh related to health\nand what we were eating if we were\nworking a little bit on the business and\nthen having fun and we would like you\nknow grade ourselves at the end of each\nday so we were\nhyper optimized it was a ton of fun uh\nand I'll pause there if there's anything\nwithin that that is uh of Interest yeah\nso Charlie I'm I'm um\nhmm\nI'm trying to think about what so can\nyou tell me a little bit about how you\nfound this group of people like what\nwere those conversations like where did\nthese people come from yes so one of\nthem was my best friend from 10th grade\num and so we uh talked to each other and\nit was a lot of like sharing the mentors\nand books that we had so the four hour\nwork week was one of them uh the book\nthat made me realize I could talk to\ngirls was the game and I was like oh my\nGod you can go out and you can use\npickup lines and girls will like you\num fortunately we we adjusted that\napproach fairly early in our but that\nwas that was eye-opening to me that you\ncould get a different reaction based on\ndifferent things that you said\num and then within that\nmy friend and I started um going on\ninternet forums and we offered like a\nfive dollar class on the things that we\nwere learning via skillshare and so 10\npeople showed up one of those people\ndropped out of college and came with us\nat another class we went to that guy\ncream like dropped out of his thing and\ncame with us so we were\nwe had a an awe a real Aura around us at\nthe time we had a sense of uh infinite\npossibility uh you know you don't have\nto do the nine to five you don't have to\nbe constrained and that attracted people\npretty powerfully we were also fairly\nEvangelical about it we couldn't shut up\nabout it and that was a mistake that I\nthink we made was rather than having the\nsecurity and groundedness enough in our\ndecision to leave our job and go abroad\nthere was a codependent desire to\npersuade everyone that this was the best\nway to live their life as well and so I\ndefinitely you know there was good\nthings that came to that which is we\nconvinced I think nine people to quit\ntheir jobs and move to Brazil but it\nmight not have been the best choice for\nevery single one of those people I'm\nsuper amazed by your Insight you know I\nwas noticing an internal Judgment of\ngenerally speaking when we're\nEvangelical it's the person we are\ntrying to convince the most is ourselves\nyes yes\num and and and I'm just so fast I've\nnever heard of anyone doing this kind of\nthing because it sounds like you guys\nare like uh you know you're like a crew\nyeah is going about and trying to\nextract the most out of life whereas we\nwere the Gringos we were the Gringos in\nevery country that we went to this\nroving band of guys\num we were I think all like solid human\nbeings and and tried to spread good\nPositive Vibes wherever we went but uh\nit was it was a really special time and\nI I look back on it uh very very fondly\nand so what do you think\nwhat do you think y'all were looking for\nyou know I'll speak to myself because I\nhave seen everybody is not everybody\nsome of us has come around to a similar\nplace that I have which is like oh\nI see the healthy young man exploration\nof the world in there I also see the\ndrive of I'm not enough let me layer all\nof these accomplishments on top of this\ncore of lack in order to feel\nenough uh and then I can be confident\nthen I can have the things that I want\nand then I will feel excellent\num so for me what I was looking for at\nthe time I mean some of it was like I\nwanted a way\nto live my like I think what I'd seen in\nmy parents generation and my dad in\nparticular was someone who sacrificed\nprofessional satisfaction in order to\nprovide for his family\num and that I don't think was I wish\nthat he'd had another option or found\nanother option but when I thought of\nthat I was like that seems soul-sucking\nit seemed soul sucking for him and I\ndidn't want that for myself but one of\nthe things that I wanted was\nto create from my heart and to love what\nI did for work to love the thing that\ngenerated money\num and that was part of it and then uh I\nknow I was also looking for validation\nfrom other people I wanted people to\nlike me\num\nand I was looking to become someone who\nwho I thought was worthy of a tremendous\namount of validation but within that\nthere was also a bunch of healthy\nexploration and travel and we learned\nlanguages and so there was there was um\nyou could you know the shadow was mixed\nin with the light in terms of what\nmotive hitted me at that point in my\nlife yeah it's really interesting how\num you're kind of touching on a\nparticular behavior Can we tend to think\nabout things as healthy or unhealthy but\nwhat I'm really appreciating about the\nway you're describing things is that\nit's like neither or both right there's\nhealthy exploration and then there's\nalso essentially gratification of the\nego\nwhich stems from things like insecurity\nand yeah two is developmentally\nappropriate for someone in their 20s\nyeah totally totally so finding uh\nfinding the Forgiveness to say the type\nof nuanced thing that I said and that\nyou reflected back to me which is yeah\nit was totally appropriate for the time\nframe and one of the things that has\nbeen frustrating is because I was so\nenergized at that point in my life and I\nhad a winter session I would say in my\nearly 30s where I needed to like stop\ngoing out as much slow the travel down\nuh shrink my circle and myself and uh\noftentimes I ask myself can't we just go\nback to that crazy fun exploratory\nperiod that was so fun and I've realized\nit that was perfect for that time but\nI'm no longer\nit's no longer appropriate and I'm no\nlonger capable of having this that you\nknow entering twice into that same river\nif you will to use the old Parable um\nso yeah and and you've mentioned this\nterm codependency a couple of times what\ndo you mean by that\nuh so for me what I mean is\nI think that there's obviously were an\ninterdependent species we need one\nanother in important ways\num when I think of a healthy dependency\nI think of authenticity and Clarity in\ncommunicating your needs to someone else\nI think of taking ownership\nappropriately of for instance if I'm\nfeeling anxious and I'm seeking a\ncompliment for you from you I might do\nall sorts of uh backdoor ways of getting\nit from you that can be blown out at at\nlength in a relationship and becomes\ncodependent because now I am not being\ndirect and I'm getting my needs that are\nappropriately met by me from you so that\nthat's what I think of when I think of\ncodependency is both a combination of\nindirectness inauthenticity and\nan unwillingness to meet certain needs\nso what we wound up with I think it's\nsome of the friendships were lopsided\nrelationships where the weaknesses in\none person would never get addressed\nbecause the one the other party would\nalways hold that particular thing and so\none of my things was\nI am very uncomfortable uh or I'm\nchanging this I had been very\nuncomfortable in saying when I felt my\nboundaries crossed when I felt that uh\nmy needs had not been taken into account\nand in having a\ncalm perhaps a bit angry conversation\nbut uh for me that was either\nI didn't feel it at all never brought it\nup never said anything or it built up so\nmuch that I was so angry about it and\nhad held resentment for so long and\nthere was not this appropriate level of\nyou are crossing boundaries this needs\nto change a stop or and this is the\nthing that I've never done I never broke\nup with any girlfriends I need to step\nback from this relationship so that has\nbeen a process for me as well as going\num I'll pontificate for a moment here\nbut I I can see I conceived of love as\nthe primary piece being closeness then\nthe most important part of loving\nsomeone was that you maintained a very\nclose relationship you saw each other\noff and you talked all the time\num and what can get sacrificed for me is\neither\nif if someone's needs aren't being Met\nMyself themselves something else\num and then what happens is for me\nI stop accepting them the way they are\nand I start coming up with strategies or\nthings that I can do to transform or\nchange them so that my needs are met as\nopposed to saying\nthe most important piece of Love is\nacceptance\nI can see where you are in your life and\nI can communicate to you but if you're\nunwilling to meet a need what is\nappropriate is with love to separate to\na farther thing maybe we don't hang out\nevery day maybe we see each other once a\nweek and I've had to uh\nand what I've noticed is that if you\ncould then you can maintain the love the\nlove the love can sustain throughout\nthat and not develop into resentment but\nI built up many relationships because I\nwas so unwilling to step away from so\nmany relationships that uh resentment\npain\num and just you know a lack of alignment\nbuilt up in several areas of my life\nthat that I needed to to adjust\num are you comfortable with me asking\nyou a couple more questions about that\nwhole scenario because I think it's\nincredibly insightful and could be very\nillustrative\nyeah yeah I want to be careful to\nprotect the identity of some people but\nI would love to talk about this topic\nyeah absolutely so yeah I applaud your\nboundary setting there yeah\num\nreally more talk not so much about a\nparticular person but just your\nrelationship with those things if that\nfeels comfortable yeah yeah and just let\nme know if I overstep or something\nthere's a thousand other things I can\nask you okay sure\nso what did it so I you laid out this\nscenario and let me just see if I heard\nyou correctly that\nyou know so love meant closeness so\nthose two things were almost synonymous\nand so something about accepting someone\nand oh so that was one piece and then\nthe second piece that I kind of heard\nyou mention was that if you had an unmet\nneed\num not any unmet need but maybe some\nneed that is related to the relationship\nin some way and if that person was not\nable to meet that need was not willing\nto meet that need didn't understand that\nyou wanted them to meet that need\num then you would engage in behaviors\njust try to sort of squeeze it out of\nthem and I apologize if I'm kind of\nputting you in a bad light I think it's\nreally common no no it's able to do that\nI do in my relationship\num relationships\nand and so over time what you really\ndiscovered is that okay like if you're\nexpecting this person to meet your need\nand they're not meeting that need and\nyou're not able to articulate that that\ncan over time lead to some resentment\nyes and and I'm also hearing or reading\nbetween the lines here that something it\nwas you had to come to some realization\nin order to distance yourself so can you\ntell us a little bit about does that\nsound accurate so far by the way yeah\nokay that feels right so\num what I'm really curious about is what\nwhat made it hard for you to distance\nyourself\nwhat did it mean to you to stay so close\num one of the things this is I mean\nenergetically is I think I didn't know\nthis about myself but I think I'm fairly\nempathic meaning like I can when someone\nelse gets upset I feel that in my system\nand uh I mean I can I think this one I\ncan share is that uh there's probably a\nfair degree of enmeshment between me and\nmy mom when I was young uh and\nI felt her anxiety off it she's a fair\nshe's a fairly anxious person and to\nmitigate that I made adjustments in\nmyself so I'm sorry I've sort of lost\nyour question but this does feel like\nthe root of of what you said you haven't\nlost my question okay okay this okay so\nI'll we'll come back to exactly what you\nsaid but I'll establish this as sort of\nthe ground that I've uncovered is that\num\nI could confuse my feelings and my needs\nwith someone else's very easily very\nvery easily and I can give examples from\nthis\num once you know a small one was uh\nremember wrestling as a kid and it my\nmom and the audience\nyou know they're very frightened for me\nand uh my experience of it was I was one\nof the youngest kids and I came in\nsecond place that was like awesome and\nher experience was\nfear and panic but for me what that\ntotaled up to is I quit wrestling you\nknow I I I\nfelt the stress of causing that panic in\nher made me not want to do that thing\nand so one of the behaviors that grew\nout of that is I learned never not just\nwith her I do not struggle publicly it\nlike when somebody sees me struggling\nthat old it triggers this old thing in\nme this old discomfort of I am burdening\nthem in a way that is very uncomfortable\nfor me to experience\num and so I you know just in\nre-understanding I used to tell people\noh building the business was nothing so\neasy I I never did any homework I never\nstudied and going back and be like oh my\nGod I paid so much close attention in\nclass yes I never studied but I would\nput my head down and fake sleeping so\nthat so that people wouldn't think I was\nworking hard I mean there were these\nlike adaptive behaviors so\njust to give an example and then catch\nme back up so I'm coming back to your\nquestion now\nI I love where you're going okay you\nhave more to say or oh I mean I could I\ncould go Ad nauseam about this but the\nuh what this what I have learned is that\nthere is a way to discern what my\nfeelings are and what other people's\nfeelings are that was a trial and still\nis for me to really sort through and I\nthink\nit affects everything it's a Hallmark of\nnow my relationship with my girlfriend I\nthink started from a place of uh the\nfamiliar\nI have total control everything that\neveryone feels is because of me that's a\nvery familiar comfortable powerful safe\nplace for me to be for her she was happy\nto play the role of you know a lot of\nwhat I feel is because Charlie did\nsomething or didn't do something and\nwe've had to within the last year and a\nhalf\nreally take a look at\nthe places that for me make me feel\npowerless which is\nyour feelings like there are things\nexisting in you my girlfriend or you any\nperson in my life that I did not cause\nthat I cannot fix that I cannot mend or\nor make better and my job is to sit with\nmy own discomfort with that and your job\nis to tend to your needs dick you know\ntell me when there's something that I\ncan do directly that could help meet a\nneed in you and own when that thing\nisn't working for you and there's\nsomething else that you need to find in\nyourself and so that process has been\njust playing out in so many areas of my\nlife I set like I'm a codependent velcro\nthing like I find ways to hook into\nother people and it is often in a way of\nsupport help advice and what I have not\nbeen capable of doing that I am learning\nto do is sit old space listen uh allow\npeople their struggle without interfere\nHearing in it when it is not asked for\nwow\nso quick question love everything you're\nsaying yeah are you okay not answering\nmy question directly\nsorry so take me back to the question\nexactly forget about the question for a\nsecond if that's okay well it's okay I\ncan't how do you how do you feel if you\ndon't answer the question\num how do I feel like I've let you down\nlike like you wanted something for me\nand I didn't I didn't know I did give it\nto you all right yeah yeah yeah but\nyou're not responsible for my feelings\nright that's exactly what you're\nlearning and it's so beautifully\nIllustrated because here you are you're\nlike oh like what was your question\nagain like bro honestly from the bottom\nof my heart pure authenticity I love\neverything that you're saying okay\nI I don't the question is from my\nperspective the question is just to hear\nmore of what you have to share I'm not\nlooking for anything\nis that that\nthe first time someone said that to me\nI went\nright you know I like rolled my eyes and\nuh\nI appreciate that that is something that\nI need to that is so hard for me to\nallow to sink in I'm not looking for\nanything when it is authentic and I\nbelieve you\nthat hits my nervous system like I want\nto let it in but oh God I'm afraid to\nyeah and it's uh\ngosh I I'm so excited to continue\nlearning to receive that because\nwhat a yeah what a relief that that\nwould be yeah I mean so if I can share\nsomething else about that so\nto put it simply Charlie the reason I'm\nnot interested in you necessarily\nanswering like if you do great is\nbecause I think\nwhat you have to share is the most\nvaluable thing the valuable the value\nthat I'm hearing when I just listen to\nyou speak is not in a particular answer\nlike I'm looking for this bit of\ninformation you gave me that information\nor you didn't give me that information\nhonestly my my authentic feeling of this\nconversation is just hearing you talk\nlike whatever you want to talk about\nlike I don't care\nit's just your representation of your\nexperience the way that you're\ndescribing things I mean the way that\nseriously it's like\nI mean you might as I don't know if\nyou've ever formally studied psychology\nbut you're fluidity with the concepts is\nis amazing and part of what I actually\nreally appreciate about what you're\nsaying is that your fluidity with the\nconcepts is very experiential and so I\nthink that if you have two psychiatrists\nfor example talking about and maybe\nyou're a psychiatrist and I just don't\nknow but\num talking about something like in\nmanagement or codependency it's going to\nbe so clinical because in psychiatry\nour perspective is from the outside\nlooking in\nso we like describe behaviors as opposed\nto describing the subjective experience\nso I love talking to you because I think\nthe way that you describe things will\nactually resonate more with the average\nperson than two experts talking about it\ngot it yeah because what like this this\nexample about wrestling right where I'm\nnoticing that you feel really and even\nthe reason I kind of poked you there and\nlet me know if I crossed a boundary\nis that I'm noticing that wow this guy\nis like real it's really important to\nhim to answer my question and even\nthough he's sharing something really\nvaluable he kind of keeps coming back to\nit and and so I think that that's a good\nexample of you know the wrestling story\nand and even in terms of your\nrelationship like\num\nyou know just how tricky it is\nespecially in a relationship because if\nyou look at relationships to a certain\ndegree we're responsible for our\npartners feelings right like it's our\njob to help them feel better and that's\nwhat especially a romantic relationship\nis about\nand at the same time we can cross the\nrealm into toxicity so quickly\nif we become solely responsible\nand the other tricky thing that I\noftentimes see in these kind of\ncodependent relationships is that as you\nstart taking more of that space your\npartner starts taking less and then\neventually the burden of their feelings\nFalls to you and you feel wholly\nresponsible for their feelings yeah and\nthen you know you don't have 100 power\nand then that leads to a whole host of\nchallenges in terms of you trying harder\nbeing more controlling\num you know as well as them sort of\ndumping the responsibility on you and\nboth you all agree that if they feel a\nparticular way it's your fault which is\nreally when relationships become very\ndifficult\nyeah yes that I\nthat all hits yeah\num I'm trying to remember what my\noriginal question was but I I mean I I\nmean I'll just say what you reflected to\nme um I appreciate it it you helped put\nme a bit at ease and you are right that\nthere is\nI want people to get what they ask of me\nand I worry that they don't and your\nyour indication is a really powerful way\nof saying that I think increasingly the\nright people for me\nwill want me you know they will want me\nand and not that I'm never going to have\na tantrum or a fit or a problem but that\nthe thing that they will generally come\nback to is\nyour presence your you know the the\nyou-ness of it all is the value and\nthere are times in which I might ask for\na particular favor and I guess I would\nlike that thing\nbut generally this relationship is built\non you me connecting yeah beautifully\nsaid man yeah so\num can I keep asking questions please\nplease yeah so so you talked about\npeople want the Eunice of you how does\none figure out what the Unice of you is\nI mean I will I could try to I'll tell\nyou subjectively for me\num psychedelics were incredibly helpful\num did it in a safe space with a\nfacilitator and all those things uh\ngosh I mean I I'll take you there\num\nwhen I was little I was molested and one\nof the things that\nthat did with me was it created a\nprofound sense of confusion in me of who\nI was\num\nsecondarily to that which was also\nchallenging and I didn't again I didn't\nknow any of this at the time my\nperspective on the time was it this\nhappened it didn't bother me it was\ntotally okay some people are bothered by\nthat but I'm just one of the lucky ones\nthat did not get affected by that and\nthat was true for 20 plus years I like\nwas aware vaguely that this has happened\nand as I've Revisited in psychedelics\none of the things that happened on one\nof the nights was\nI was freaking out having a very hard\ntime and in my belly was like you tell\nthis guy that was taking care of me at\nthe time tell them you're gay tell them\nyou're gay tell them you're gay\nand I was like no no I could do that no\nthat's not and and it came up I said I'm\ngay\nand then it didn't taste right didn't\nfeel right in my throat\nand what came out after was I just burst\ninto tears and said I was molested\nand\nwhat I have found in me is that there\nare often these blocks these things that\nI am afraid that represent confusion of\nwhat if this were true and for me it was\nyou know growing up in the 90s gay was\nthe thing that you said to someone to\ninsult them it was the the wrong thing\nto be and my era I think a lot of people\nat some level hold well I won't tell I\nwon't say what other people but what I\nheld was totally okay for other people\nto be gay but this is not okay for you\nand so the fear of things that could be\ntrue about me I think stopped me from\nexploring what was really there and so\nthat's just one example the inability to\ntruly go am I did do I you know that\nthat that curious exploration was off\nlimits and so the deeper thing which was\nbehind that was this experience happened\nto me\nI have convinced myself that I liked it\nin order to cope with it and what was\ndeep deep in there uh after you know\nmore Journeys was how painful this\nexperience was how\num\nI mean I thought fast forward I\neventually through this convinced my\nfamily and my parents to join me in like\nan MDMA journey and in that uncovered oh\nthis is hard uh with my dad I\nwas able to share with him the\ndevastation of\nthat experience for me something that I\nwas so ashamed to share\num and particularly how hard it\nseparated me from him and I felt\nI couldn't go to him anymore was what I\nfelt I felt uh crushed and\njust\nuh\nlike Soul crushed I I was was the way\nthat it felt and\njust the shame at which was heaped on in\nother ways in this relationship with\nthis person\num\ndictated a lot of my personality for a\nlong time the avoidance of things that\nmade me feel shame and so\nthe the meanest of me oftentimes has\ncome through acknowledging and\nexperiencing and feeling pain\nbecause it is my pain and these are\nthings so I realize probably what has\nhappened is things that are me I\nseparate from and I create stories that\nare more comfortable so rather than\nbeing the me that is in pain that had\nthis experience happen I'll be this\nother guy who is totally fine totally\ncool totally happy and I built up a\nwhole set of habits over the course of\nmy life of being something else to the\ndegree that I forgot what it felt like\nto check who I was inside and I was so\nused to different mental images of\nmyself that became me that yeah that I\nlost contact with with the meanest so\nfor me it's been a process of in many\ncases uncovering very difficult emotions\nshame pain self-loathing all of these\nother things\nfeeling them as fully as I can and in\nthat I touched deeper into who I am\num and a lot of that confusion is\nresolved authentically rather than\nresolving that confusion with a\nstatement of I'm straight you know or\nlike any any sort of dictate that I\nmight put out into the world I can I\njust feel who I am much more clearly\nthese days yeah I think it's it's\nbeautiful\num\nI mean I I don't I don't mean to say I\nunderstand I understand what I honestly\nI what it ended with was I was just how\nyou felt who you are instead of defining\nwho you are your words\nyou know and I I think we see that so\nmuch right now where people will talk\nabout I am a this or you know I'm a\nleader I'm an alpha or whatever right\ninstead of like being one and and I I've\nkind of noticed\nit's I I I really love a lot of your\ninsights Charlie just about how it's\nalmost almost a little bit mutually\nexclusive I don't think that's precisely\ntrue but that you know the more we talk\nabout who we are the less\nthe more we Define our identity by words\nI think we sometimes get away from\nourself and we'll strive to be\nparticular things but I'm also hearing a\nvery you know honestly\ngreat journey of\ntrying to Define yourself in a\nparticular way learning a lot about\npositivity and growth and and learning a\nlot about okay if you do set your\nintention in a particular direction that\nyou can actually make progress I hear\nthat your 20s were were sort of like a\nperiod of empowerment really\nsort of like yeah a\ndisenfranchisement early on followed by\nempowerment and then now you're kind of\ninto this acceptance phase where it's\nnot about power or lack of power but\nwhatever you are is what you are and\nthat's hopefully enough yes yes I think\nthe 20s and they were wonderful but\nthere was a bypass going on in my 20s\nit's like can I just teleport to\nconfidence can I speak the confidence\ninto myself can I speak the inner\nokayness into myself\num the uh achievement affirmation all of\nthose sorts of things as opposed to the\npath that I've taken now is I am going\nto sit with and move through the exact\nopposite of what I want to feel which is\nself-loathing or shame or confusion and\nrather than resolve any of those things\nI will allow those things to be resolved\nby being with them and the profundity of\nbeing with is something that I am just\nbeginning to understand and learn uh I\nwas always a doer a fixer a changer if\nyou like I'm great with advice I've got\na YouTube channel full of it but what I\ndidn't have in my internal system in my\nlife and I didn't see the value of was\nbeing with people being with myself in\nexperiences that were just uncomfortable\num I just tried to change whatever I\ncould to to bring back that state of\ncomfort as quick as possible and I see\num the immaturity in that now\nyeah I think uh it's interesting I've\nnever heard the word immaturity used to\ndescribe that but yeah it makes a lot of\nsense yeah\num and I I think that you know the\navoidance of pain is frequently what\ngets us into the most trouble\nI know one thing I've sort of noticed is\nis a psychiatrist is that people tend to\navoid pain first of all which makes\nperfect sense but honestly I've seen\njust as many lives ruined by positive\nemotions\nand being uncontrolled being out of\ncontrol with your positive emotions yeah\nand I'm not just talking about Mania I'm\ntalking about falling in love with\nsomeone I'm talking about you know\nreally love is destroyed just as many\nlives that I've seen that you know hate\nhas which sounds really bizarre to say\nbut I've kind of seen it in terms of\nwhat people will tolerate because they\nlove someone\num what people will inflict on someone\nbecause they love someone and it's sort\nof like this possessive sort of Love\num and also\nwho the other people that you were\nwilling to hurt if you are in love with\na particular person yeah yeah I my my\nsense and totally uh I use the word in\nthe same ways that again I feel like\nthat for me is Obsession you know what\nI'm what I'm learning is that there is\num\nthe way that I'm trying to experience\nnot trying uh I'm genuinely experiencing\nlove it's tough to hurt someone from the\nlove that I am increasingly feeling\nversus the love that I did feel which is\nwhat you described was possessive\nobsessive uh and it was actually very\nmuch about what this relationship fills\nin me which is why I will go to these\nlinks to deceive or get what I want or\nyou know hurt someone else or do any of\nthose sorts of things in it um and yes\nit it felt like an intoxicating\nexperience but only because I was not\naware of the deeper wound that this was\nacting as a salve for\nyeah I I would say that what I'm sort of\nhearing there is it can really be\nsummarized with this phrase I don't know\nif you're familiar with like attachment\nand Detachment from kind of Eastern\nphilosophy but this is what's kind of\nconfusing is in the west we tend to\nthink about emotions as like positive or\nnegative in a clinical perspective I\nthink we have a slightly better\nunderstanding that you know there is no\nsuch thing as a positive or negative\nemotion\nemotions are just emotions but generally\nspeaking I think what the yogis kind of\nfigured out is that it is not an emotion\nthat is good or bad it is our\nrelationship to the emotion which\ndetermines whether it's helpful or\nharmful so there are two Sanskrit words\nattraction the vaish is repulsion\nand essentially if we are attached to\nlove then it becomes obsessive\nand similarly if we are repulsed from\nshame then that becomes harmful yeah so\nit's when we're kind of tranquil with\neach one whether we allow them to be\nthat we actually form the healthiest\nrelationship with our emotions which is\nthose are just emotions\nbeautiful I love that I find myself\nincreasingly called towards Eastern\nphilosophy Eastern uh traditional\nmedicine and those sorts of things I\nfound um\nagain I feel like I really have done the\nWestern thing and I've gotten a lot of\nvalue it's not a western thing uh the\nthe main thrust that I have seen to me\nwhen I think of the west I think of sort\nof uh Victor Frankel I think of finding\nmeaning in pain which to me is making\nthis moment refer to something else like\nrather than sinking into the moment\nlet's find something larger something\nbigger that we can connect this moment\nto to confer something onto this moment\nand the Eastern thing seems to be\ncan I stop referring this moment to\nsomething else and be in this moment can\nI have presence\nuh for what is and not need to\nnecessarily connect it to make it mean\nanything it can just be and I don't know\nif that's how you experience it but for\nme go ahead I would say there's um so I\nthink that that is both correct and\nthere is something on the other side\ntell me about that so\num so let me start by asking you just\none more question that I'm happy to\nexplain so when you say okay so what's\nyour understanding of what the goal of\nthe Eastern perspective is\nso\nuh and again these calling anything the\nEastern perspective I recognize a ton of\nstuff but when I feel it it it feels\nlike presence would be the one word it\nwould be entering into the now\num and seeing the beauty of what is\nwithout needing to change alter or or\nshape it and there's also the you know\nthe Dao the going with the flow allowing\nyourself to become one with\nthe everything\nbroadly so that's my that's my broad\nunderstanding yeah yeah so so I I think\nI think well said and I'm not\nyou know I understand some Eastern\nConcepts but it I'm not objectively you\nknow the the knower of Truth by any\nmeans but what I would say is that you\nknow being in the now is actually the\nfirst step and and I really love the way\nman Charlie I just love the way you\ntalked it so I love the way that you're\ntalking about meaning or sorry pain as a\nreferential thing right so what we're\ngoing to do is we've got this experience\nand instead of sitting with the\nexperience we're going to derive\nsomething out of it right we're going to\ndistill it into something that's\nvaluable so we're going to take a\nnegative and we're going to transform it\ninto a positive the problem with that is\nthat there is a fundamental judgment\nthat the negative is worse than the\npositive and so we're still moving away\nfrom one thing and moving towards\nanother thing yeah now there's a lot of\ngood research around why that's healthy\nso if you look at post-traumatic like\nthe research on post-traumatic growth\nand post-traumatic stress disorder what\nwe sort of know is that as people go\nthrough these terrible experiences like\ngenocidal experiences that there's a\nthey're two camps of people and some\npeople will develop psychiatric\nillnesses and some people will sort of\nbecome stronger and then that can be the\nsame group of people eventually people\nwill kind of go down the route of\npost-traumatic growth and and a key just\nsort of like scientifically\nimportant part of that is the\ndevelopment of meaning or narrative\naround your experience\nyeah so Victor Frankel I'm kind of with\nyou\num but I think the really interesting\nthing is that maybe you'll you'll get\nthere one day or maybe you'll arrive\nsomewhere I hope so let me know is that\nI I think that there is a being in the\nnow almost you'll eventually see that\nthere is this transcendental purpose as\nopposed to a referential purpose I don't\nknow how else to describe it but even\nbeing in the now is part of even if you\ntalk about the Dao or the flow that that\nthere is a Continuum of stuff and that\nis really what like that purpose is it's\nnot purpose in the microcosm it's like\npurpose at the macrocosm and I even\nthink when I worked with people with\ntrauma\nreally when I there's sort of the\nreferential purpose\nbut there's also like a Transcendent\npurpose that people can get to which is\nlike recognizing that that too was part\nof my path almost in the same way that\nyou are and and to recognize that what\nwe're talking about with purpose is that\nlike in life I am what I am the now is\nthe now and then this is the progression\nof my life and that's okay and what I'm\nsupposed to do on this planet on this\nEarth in this life is to just go down\nthe path that I was meant to go down\nand this is where some of these broader\nConcepts like Karma which I think are\nare very poorly understood like you know\nI think these really start to come in\nand and\nyou know being in the now is great but\nit's interesting because I think that\nthat Duality is actually dissolved the\nfurther down you go\nI like it yeah I'm definitely not there\nbut I could have I had Peak experience\nof that let me see\nI've had moments where it feels that uh\nthe where I've been able to be with the\nnow and look back and go\noh I feel the connectedness of all of\nthis I feel the\nuh beauty of this path that appeared to\nhave gotten off course because this\nthing wasn't supposed to happen and it\nwas so wrong and it shouldn't have been\nthat way and it should have been\ndifferent and now\nwithout forcing it I think one of the\nthings that that um again is healthy for\na phase but that I'm trying to ease off\nof is to take some of these profound\nideas like everything happens for a\nreason and repeat it as an empty\naffirmation to oneself that is not\nsinking in a deep level but I've been\nable to recently to sink into that\nthe depth of that to us too too deeper\nand deeper degrees and uh with\nauthentically sinking into it and I see\nwhat you're talking about how\nyes it's not just this point it is this\nflow this River this larger this larger\nthing yeah so I I think when we talk\nabout these Concepts like Dao or Dharma\nDharma\num karma karma that I think it's all\nlike the same thing and there's this\nweird sort of transcendental kind of\nthing it's also interesting because I I\nwould even\nthat I would encourage you to examine\nwhether\nso we're talking about it I'm talking\nabout it as if it's on the other side of\nwhere you are right now right because\nyou're working on being present and\nstuff like that but I would even it the\nmore I'm hearing you speak I wonder if\nactually you've gotten a glimpse of that\nand interestingly enough the more that\nyou realize that there's Transcendent\ntranscendental purpose the easier it\nbecomes to be in the now yeah because if\nthis is all a part of my life\nI don't need to do anything except for\nbe here now and present and that is\nsufficient\nand and it's almost quite liberating if\nyou get a glimpse of that to recognize\nlike\nyou know this is just what I'm supposed\nto be and so I don't need to be anything\nelse and then it becomes easy to be in\nthe present yeah yeah I appreciate that\nthat this is actually something very\npres you know to my this last week these\ncouple days that I've struggled with\num the old me felt on my path when I was\nworking in my Tim Ferriss optimized way\nwith my four things achieved every day\nnot like that that made me feel on the\npath and I sense a larger path that is\nasking me to let go of a lot of those\nthings and to have more space less\nrigidity to how I just for this phase in\nmy life not forever\num\nand to let something larger percolate\nand and Bubble Up and the glimpses that\nI have had\nthat move man yeah I feel it uh\nthere's a knowing that is\nsemi-obscured in me that I both long for\nand fear of the\num\nthe gift of my life the way that it is\nheaded what it has been\nand\nyeah the depth of beauty that that will\nbecome and all those things and what I\ncan get stuck in is fear that I didn't\ndo what I needed to do today to make\nthat happen uh and so I I appreciate\nwhat you've said and I'm working with\nlike when you have the glimpse of the\nthe larger transcendental it's like no\nit's all working out inevitably\nperfectly as it needs to be it makes\nthese days where I don't have a podcast\nor I haven't produced a video or I\nhaven't done something\nit lets me understand that they\ncontribute just as much as those days\nwhere I am totally productive and and\nmake the thing happen in the way that I\nyou know was used to doing\nyou know what I feel for me and again I\nthink that there's different stages I\nthink that there's some people\nthat really need to um\nthey need to get on their grind and they\nneed like that's that's where they are\nfor me\nuh the this where what I do that I'm not\neven totally aware of with space and\nsilence is probably even more productive\nthan what I do with activity and\num\nand and you know contribution in the\ntraditional ways that I'm that I'm used\nto it can I push and or play with you a\nlittle bit please please push\nso\nCharlie when you when you say okay\nthat's equally productive right\nI'm trying to figure out how to say this\num\nwhat do you think is better for\neverything to be equally productive or\nfor something to be less productive and\nthat be okay\nI hear you\num\nperhaps productive is not the right word\nthat they are\nbecause I I agree that it is if we if we\ntake productivity to mean what is this\nadding to uh\nto your uh ability to influence to your\npower base to your ability to impact\nother people's lives in a direct manner\nto your ability to earn money or\nwhatever to the money that you have at\nyour bank\num\nI still think that there is a tremendous\ndegree of productivity to space that I\nhave underestimated like a lot of my\nvideos I wrote from I read from space so\nI'm from I'm not disagreeing that\nthere's value to that\nyeah the reason I'm pushing you is\nbecause I think there's there's so still\nthere is a value you are valuing\nproductivity even in a non-traditional\nway over non-productivity yeah yeah\nright so so I I think this is where\nI want to say I've worked and I don't\nmean to\nplease let me know if I come across as\nlike condescending or Superior no in any\nway but no no I appreciate it I I I've\nworked with a I've learned a lot from\nyou\num\nI've worked with a lot of people who are\nvery successful and I I've noticed this\nthing that they kind of fall into which\nis like okay like now you've seen the\nvalue of space right but at the end of\nthe day are you okay taking space if\nthere's no value\num\nright because if we're really talking\nabout acceptance\nyou should be have no dwesh or repulsion\ntowards wasting your time yeah and yes\nand there's there's something incredibly\nliberating which maybe you've already\nexperienced which is like you don't need\nto be productive all the time it doesn't\nhave to have productivity in a different\ndimension I I I completely support the\njourney that you're on\nbut yeah I know I and and I appreciate\nthis no I I I think that you are keyed\ninto something that is not\nfully germinated in me which is I'm\nworking through this constant need to\nproduce give prove my worth Etc and I'm\nfinding intermediate steps of oh well\nthis counts as productivity\nyou've got to be careful because you'll\nhijack the Eastern stuff yeah if you\nknow and what you'll do is the the\nproductivity mind will be like oh like\nif I become an enlightened Transcendent\nindividual imagine how much more\nproductive yeah\nright so you know it's it's going to be\ntricky because I I think the the\nchallenge that you face is going to be\nhard man\nand yes I've complete I'm excited for\nyour journey I have complete confidence\nin you and I I think it's gonna be hard\nto be less\nit's going to be uh absolutely brutal no\nit's\nno one 100 percent uh\nyes these These are\nyou can call them coping mechanisms to\nmaintain the core of my old belief\nsystem whilst rearranging some of the\nfurniture uh\nand\nyeah and I the good news is it seems\nthat life in its infinite wisdom is\ninsistent that I learn this at a deeper\nlevel\nbecause it's not uh it's you know I\nreally am so well taken care of uh this\nhas actually been part of my journey is\nto really recognize and receive which is\nhard the gifts\nof my life that are like I have the gift\nof having enough money to take a break I\nhave the gift of a supportive group of\npeople around me who care to see me\nreally find acceptance without pushing\nprodding or controlling and to like uh\na lack of deservingness can be activated\nthat I think runs deep\nuh that well how come and not everybody\nelse gets this and how come just me and\nit doesn't feel it could feel on right\nand like I'm not allowed to enter into\nthat space until I\ndonate enough give enough contribute\nenough which which I you know I don't\nthink there's an end to that\nyeah beautiful man I I I'm very excited\nfor you and I didn't I didn't mean to\npoke you too much I mean I I don't I\ndon't appreciate it I'm you know I'm\ngood I think it's gonna You're Gonna\nLove It On on the other side when you\nsort of\nyou know you'll realize one day that\nI I hope and maybe you'll come to a\ndifferent realization and the\nrealization I have is incorrect I don't\nthink so though because I think you're\nyou're I'm already seeing the seeds but\njust like you said you've got to be\ncareful because that\nyou know now I know the productivity of\nspace and the value of space that's\nactually falling into your old trap\nwhich is value yeah which is what does\ndoes this thing have value does this\nhave value does this have value yes\num\nversus is this thing\nexactly right yeah and so it's it's\nseriously something that I think the\nhardest thing that sometimes I'll try to\nhelp people learn I don't know that you\ncan really teach it is that\nso there's this kind of aspect where\neveryone's like trying to see the Silver\nLining right we're going to practice\ngratitude and we're gonna like be\npositive and all this kind of stuff but\nI I think honestly sometimes the the\nmost\ntranquil things someone can learn is to\nactually dispense with all that stuff\nand to say okay this actually isn't as\nproductive there isn't a w here there's\nno way to pull a w and it's okay to take\nthe L\num\nand once you're okay taking owls I think\nthere's another layer of the kind of\npiece that comes with it\num yeah but totally totally I I uh\nI mean it's it's\nwords fail when you get to that I think\nit's just what the only thing that's\ninside of me is just I am that that's\nthe only thing that I could that I can\nadd to that yeah so as long as as long\nas you found that then you're gonna be\nfine the rest of it is just you just got\nto give it time to grow and and I I\nthink I've heard so much just amazing\nself-awareness from you that I I think\nyou've got the stuff unlocked that's\ngonna work I'm excited to watch your\njourney thank you thank you\num\nso I I know we've been talking for a\nlittle over an hour we've got about half\nan hour to 45 minutes left so I was\nwondering what you would prefer\num I can ask you more questions we can\ntalk a little bit about men mental\nhealth relationships\num if you've got questions for me I'm\nhappy to answer them\num yeah well\nmaybe doing a follow-up in some way or\nmaybe on your end or something but\nwhatever whatever you want to do good\npoint I was I was gonna say but I'll\nsave that perhaps to my end because I\nwanted to ask you about ayurveda and uh\nand to learn from you about\num\nwell maybe you could just give me a\nlittle bit of how you use that in your\ninteractions or practice and here here I\ngo again with how do you use this no\nthat's fine right so just noticing it is\ngood I mean yeah use it right yeah\nthat's okay I'm I'm curious yeah so\nlet's just do a little bit of background\nabout Irma though so ayurveda's\ntraditional Indian medicine there's a\nlot of cross-pollination between\ntraditional Chinese medicine and\ntraditional Indian medicine I mean this\nmay be a statement that upsets a lot of\npeople but I think they're very\nequivalent in a lot of ways\njust the way that they view the body and\nthe human being is very similar and is\nvery different from the way that we view\nit in the West\nso in the west we tend to be very\nreductionist so what we do is we take a\nhuman being and we split them up into\ntheir parts and then we kind of dive\ndown and then we split apart into more\nparts and apart into more parts we sort\nof have a molecule we have an atom we\nhave uh you know\nprotons and neutrons and electrons and\nthen we have quarks similarly we have a\nhuman being we have a brain we have a\nheart we have a stomach we have\ngastroenterologists cardiologists\nneurologists psychiatrists so we're sort\nof we split the body apart\nand we focus on a particular organ\nso the first thing that's different\nabout the eastern systems of medicine is\nthat they are\npattern they're about patterns of of\npeople as opposed to individual like\norgan functions and so what they sort of\nused were kind of like heuristics or\ntools of understanding to describe\npeople so what they kind of noticed is\nthat if you look at organ function or\nyou look at any particular thing\nthat there are people who have shared\ntraits across organ systems yeah so for\nexample they noticed that some people\nget bored very easily they work their\nhardest so there are some people that if\nthey're doing something new they can\nwork for 12 or 16 hours a day or even 20\nhours a day but if they're doing\nsomething old\nit'll be a struggle to work for even\nfour hours a day\nand they also noticed other patterns\nlike these people for example\nwill be prone to constipation that they\nwill be prone to things like asthma\neczema things like that\nold hands and feet right cold hands and\nfeet yep yeah right so they also will\nhave angular features\num other kinds of observations they made\nor that the the top of their eyelid\ncovers a chunk of the iris of the eye\nand they made all kinds of interesting\nobservations\nand so then what they tried to do is try\nto figure out okay like what are we\ngoing to call this right because there\nare features across eyes skin all the\norgans and so they used elements and so\nI don't think that they ever really\nthought that if I biopsy someone I will\nfind wind but you know Vata is sort of\ncategorized by wind\nyou know what they mean by that is that\nthese people are kind of dynamic like\nwhat are the qualities of the wind so\nthis is like stuff that they developed\nlike 4 000 years ago yeah because they\ndidn't have it and I feel I feel a\nstrong connection to wind very like it's\nwhen I found out I was about I was like\nall right that's a little yeah and I\nhave the cold hands cold feet you know I\nit was surprisingly uh\nfor me yeah and and so if you kind of\nthink about people who are Vata their\nmind is like the wind so they get\nexcited about things the wind can blow\nreally hard it can stop blowing it can\nchange direction and so the wind\nsometimes is not quite as consistent\num these people also tend to be dry so\nlike they'll have constipation and\npotentially dry skin and things like\nthat\num\nand so if you kind of look at it\nscientifically like\nI was under the impression there was a\nlot of very good science behind ayurveda\num and looked at a couple of Trials and\nthankfully a couple people in my\ncommunity pointed out that some of the\nyou know research papers I were talking\nwas talking about were not actually the\nbest so I kind of did a re-evaluation of\nsort of the scientific basis behind\nayurveda there isn't a whole lot of uh\ngood scientific evidence that\ncorroborates this there's some Gene\nallele studies that detect some\nstatistical significance but it tends to\nbe quite small that even vatas will\nshare particular alleles so if you look\nat like the way that we metabolize\ncholesterol for example vatas are more\nlikely to have a particular allele at\ncholesterol metabolism whereas bit this\nwill have something puffers will have\nsomething\nI think the the more of the data that\nsupports it and there's really not much\nso some genetic support of some of these\ntheories\num frankly it's it's quite light\nI think part of the problem that we run\ninto with ayurveda and science is that\nthe system of ayurveda is not designed\nto be studied by Western science correct\nso so if we look at Western science what\nwe try to do is we assume that a disease\nis an isolatable thing so what we'll do\nis these things called randomized\ncontrolled trials well we will control\nfor all of the individuality and then we\nwill try to isolate a disease process in\nsome kind of intervention the\ninteresting thing is that runs\ncompletely contrary to the principles of\nayurveda which is that you can't control\nfor all of these factors because people\nare individuals\num one of the biggest differences I\nthink between Western medicine and\nEastern medicine is that Western\nmedicine is generally speaking assumes\nthat all people are the same now a lot\nof Western doctors will take issue with\nthat\nbut if you really think about I think\nthe more you understand it the more you\nrealize it's true so if you look at\nthese things like fda's recommendation\nof 2000 calories a day just the fact\nthat we have a recommendation of a\nuniform number of calories for all human\nbeings speaks to our sort of\npopulation-based approach if something\nworks in Western medicine how do we\ndecide if it works we measure 10 000\npeople and if on average\nit helps people more than Placebo then\nwe say it works yeah\npart of what you discover in clinical\nmedicine\nso if we're talking about like\nantidepressants and stuff is that really\nwhat I've seen is that there are three\npopulations of patients with a mood\ndisorder like major depressive disorder\na third of them antidepressants work\nreally really well a third of them you\nget maybe some benefit and a third of\nthem they really don't work at all\nand so what we see in Western medicine\nis we assume that all major depressive\ndisorder all bipolar disorders basically\nthe same we have evidence-based\ntreatments but in ayurveda the\nfundamental thing that they assume is\nthat people are different\nso each person has a unique cognitive\nfingerprint or maybe not unique but\nthere are patterns that we can observe\nand we sort of see this because we know\nthat some people are like what we call\nBig boned right where they're going to\nbe their metabolism is going to be heavy\nset and there's also a concept from\nWestern medicine like endomorphs\nectomorphism mesomorphs\num Maps really really well so these are\nkind of independently discovered in the\nwest as well\nand so what ayurveda basically says is\nif we look at people who like you know\nare have high metabolisms they can eat\nas much as they want to they won't get\nvery fat other at the other end you have\nthese slow metabolism kind of people\nthat are going to be big boned or\nwhatever so we know that metabolically\nthere are like three groups of people\nwhat ayurveda basically says is that\nit's just not metabolically you can look\nat the mind and there are three groups\nof people you can look at digestive\nsystem\num you know skin all of the organ\nsystems have manifestations of these\nparticular things\nyou know in your case\nis that just sort of like a kind of a\nscientific disclaimer about you know\nwhat do we know what do we not know I\nthink there's also some really\ninteresting scientific\nstuff around so for example if you look\nat like Blockbuster drugs like statins\nwhich are like cholesterol medication\nthat everyone takes these are actually a\nmedicine that was developed by\ntraditional Chinese medicine so it was\nused by Chinese doctors\nthe other thing that we tend to see from\na science standpoint is that when\nsomething in the East works it gets\nco-opted to the west and we don't really\ngive it credit\nyeah um and then what we sort of say is\noh yeah like Chinese medicine is fake\nand like Western medicine works but it's\nlike hold on a second who actually\ndiscovered this yeah\num now going on to so any questions\nabout that just kind of backdrop maybe\nfor us no that's that's that's that's\ngood uh I I appreciate the um\nthe description that you had about\nreductionist westernist ways again an\nolder version of me would go ha proof\npositive this is nonsense and I see what\nyou're saying about this is not designed\nto be measured by a reductionist\napproach that is looking for alleles\neven it's supposed like it's supposed to\nbe treated holistically and the question\nis does this work when broadly like when\napplied to a person so so I I think just\nas a from a scientific nerdiness\nstandpoint I think if we want to see\nayurveda studies for ayurveda that need\nto be something called cohort studies as\nopposed to argentines so we need to do\nis we need to take 100 people give them\nayurvedic treatment and we need to take\na hundred people give them Western\nmedical treatment and we need to see\nwhen an ayurvedic person diagnoses each\nperson individually and applies whatever\nrecommendations they have does that\npopulation\nhow does how do their outcomes compare\nto the Western medicine doctor and I\nthink if we design studies that way\nwe'll see more value yeah and then and\nperhaps even just a placebo statement\nwhere they're where they're given\nnothing because I'm sure there are\nplaces where even if Western medicine\none on average it's it does seem to me\nyou talked about that third for whom\ndepressants don't work there are these\npeople that when they are treated not\nwith the Western interventionists take\nthis pill approach flourish now is that\na large number or a smaller number I\ndon't know but there seems to be an\nimportant Niche that should exist for\npeople to to have these holistic\ntreatments yeah I mean I I think we're\nmoving in that direction so you know\nbefore doing this whole YouTube and\ntwitch thing my area of expertise was\nactually an evidence-based complement to\nan alternative medicine so really\nunderstanding okay how do we apply this\nstuff\nand I I started a clinic actually at\nMass General Hospital where I was using\nsome of these principles you know and\nwith appropriate oversight and stuff and\nwe saw really good outcomes and patients\nreally loved it so we filled up pretty\nquick\num I'm kind of going on to you I imagine\nyou're asking because of the vatapeta\nthing\nyeah I'm the I mean it started I've uh\nthe psychedelics were way out of my uh\nthat was not something I ever would have\nconsidered except that I was extremely\nsad after a breakup I've seen when\nhandled appropriately tremendous\npositive impact from those things which\nmade me go what have I written off\nbecause it seemed too out there and then\na friend said the word ayurveda the\nother day he told me I was about the\nPitta I looked it up and that's that\nplus what you just shared is sort of the\nextent of my understanding yeah so in in\nterms of vatapeta I'm curious whether\nyou're vatapeter pittavata but that's\nthat's because you can have a primary\nand a secondary so just to you know\nshare with you what my understanding and\nI'm not a trained ayurvedic physician by\nthe way so this is an amateur hour okay\nso vatas are tend to be like the wind\nand fit this tend to be like fire so if\nyou think about the what are the\nqualities of fire it tends to be\nit burns right so it's like kind of\nconsistent but it doesn't burn forever\nso once it runs out of fuel it'll kind\nof extinguish\nkind of the more you feed it the more\nit'll burn so fit this tend to be driven\nfocused\num quite like sequential like I'm gonna\ndo this and I'm gonna do this even your\npersonal journey is like very bit\noriented it's like yeah I had my shy\nphase and then I graduated to this and I\ngraduated to this and I graduated to\nthis whereas more of a Vata journey is\ngoing to be like then I did this random\nthing and I did this random thing yours\nhas a lot of linearity to it so if this\nwill be quite linear\nand then vatas will be kind of all over\nthe place so you really do have a\nvatapita kind of thing which is and what\nI what I see when I work with people\nprofessionally is you're gonna have a\nproject that you're gonna sync\neverything into for some amount of time\nand then you're gonna get bored of it\nand you need to do something new yeah\nmyself I was studied to become a monk\nfor seven years then I went to med\nschool and did that for a while now I\nguess I'm doing this\nstarting to get bored of this a little\nbit\nwe'll see what happens\num and so what we sort of see is like a\nnice amount of variety and I think a big\npart of understanding your Dosha is that\nyou can kind of craft your life to be\noptimal for your cognitive fingerprint\nso one thing you've got to be careful of\nis that you can get scattered too easily\nanother thing that you've got to be\ncareful of is that you know there are\nobsessional qualities with Bita\num and so vatapetas sometimes have what\nI would call as like rotating obsessions\nright so you're not obsessive about one\nthing you're not going to be like doing\nviolin for 40 years but you're going to\nget really far into something and then\nyou'll kind of move on to something else\nand just to understand you know not to\nlet so sometimes you have to be a little\nbit restrictive in terms of\nyou know is this really time to move on\nam I sitting in this too long also\npittas like need to kind of learn how to\nlet go some and especially when it comes\nto things like relationships and stuff\nbut those will be quite\num tenacious for a lack of a better term\navatas can be quite flighty\nkafas tend to stay in relationships for\nfar too long\num but on the upside will also stay in a\nrelationship and work through their\nproblems\nso these are all more like observational\nkind of things there's like you know old\nIndian literature about this but we\ndon't really have good scientific\nstudies but I think observationally it\ncan be quite strong cool yeah I mean the\nthings the things that connected with me\nand again these are coming from my own\npersonal Reflections that I've had uh\nthere's many things but the cold hands\nand feet is something that I've had for\na long time and again this was in sort\nof a medicine Journey but uh the\ncodependency thing and how how that sort\nof connected and why the Vata thing came\nI had a journey one where wind came up\nsuper strong for me but also the\nsensation of losing connection with my\nheart and feeling like that was one of\nthe first things that I looked to give\naway like like it's take this you know\nand and in the sense of\num\nwhere to to be liked I I lose connection\nwith self and the a lot of several\nJourneys therapy all that stuff as I\nfeel connection with my heart and I\nliterally feel my heart beat which\nsometimes no matter how hard I tried I\ncouldn't I could not locate it without\nlike pressing on it as I do that I\nliterally feel my hands warm up I feel\nmy feet warm up and so\nsome of the things that it pointed to\nout of balance just in the little quiz\nthat I took I found to be\nuh oh this this is what it can look like\nout of balance what if I paid attention\nto some of these particular things that\nwere highlights as in as as a potential\nuh problematic symptom when this is out\nof balance and address that and that\nthat has been a just an interesting\nthing to pay attention to the last few\ndays yeah it's it's really interesting I\nwas thinking about Mata when you were\ndescribing so when I asked you this\nquestion earlier about how do you know\nwhat's like core personality and how do\nyou know what's performative\nyou basically described grounding so\nwhen your energy gets too high and you\nhave too many thoughts yeah that's avata\nperturbation and then the more that you\ncan literally like get closer to the\nEarth\nand it's interesting because the body\npart that you started with was your\nbuttocks and the gluteal region right so\nto be seated to be grounded somewhere\nand and kind of like the more you're in\nyour own head the further away from\nyourself you become the more grounded\nyou are in your body which I think is\nreally interesting because I'm I have a\nlot of thoughts I don't know if you've\never heard the phrase normative male\nalexithymia\nI'm not\nso this is this is the other thing that\nkind of I realized it's really\ninteresting to hear how physical your\nemotional Journey has been which is\noftentimes What Men really need to do\num and there's this concept called Alexa\nthymia which is color blindness of your\ninternal emotional state\nso a lot of men like literally don't\nknow what emotions they're feeling what\nthey're feeling yeah yeah so we're\nfamiliar with frustration and everything\npisses us off like if I'm ashamed of\nmyself I'm pissed off if I'm yeah if I\nfeel rejected by someone unloved I'm\ngonna be pissed at them you know I'll be\npissed at myself I'm not depressed I'm\ngonna be pissed at myself yep yep um you\nknow if I'm anxious about something I'm\ngonna lash out at that person and try to\nbe like controlling towards them and and\ntry to control my own life\nand so one of the really interesting\nthings is that there's a term normative\nmale alexithymia and what some\npsychologists have discovered is that\nit's normal for men to not understand\ntheir internal emotional state yeah and\nso for a lot of men what we do\nunderstand is like the feelings in our\nbody so the the window to understanding\nyour emotions as a man is oftentimes\nactually using your body yes so\nunderstanding what am I feeling\nphysically right now then you can ask\npeople like okay if you've got a lump in\nyour throat like what emotion do you\nthink that could be\nand then they're like I don't know maybe\nfear and that's like that argue you're\nfeeling afraid they're like wow yeah I'm\nfeeling afraid like I feel like like\nthat's fear oh crap I never knew that\num\nso it makes a lot of I mean just\neverything that I'm hearing from you is\nis making me you know it's really lovely\nto hear kind of your journey and using\nyour body to understand your emotions\nand how your EQ has essentially been\nboosted yes no I I what you just said\n100 I mean first off I I discovered the\nground probably six months ago it was a\nrevelation like it was life-changing uh\nto go holy cow and and but for me it's\nthe support of the ground which I just\ndidn't notice uh it what a blessing and\ngift it is to feel the ground uh and\nI've lost it for a long time the other\nthing the um I can't say it back to you\nbut the male the male inner color\nblindness uh totally relate to that I\nagain shame is something that I I didn't\nknow that I had any shame probably up\nuntil six months to a year ago what I\nknew that I had was anger I had and I\nwould feel my fist and I had come to oh\nthis isn't always anger sometimes this\nis\ntrying to crawl out of my own skin\nbecause I feel so uncomfortable with\nmyself and in yes like the the higher\ngradation of understanding of these\nexperiences\nimplies of radically different approach\nyou know the way the way that one\nhandles anger and the way that one\nhandles shame uh for me at least I'll\nsay uh it that was such a difficult\nlearning but again Another Blessing gift\nto go oh my God this is shame that's\nwhat this is uh and that's why when\nsomebody talks about it I feel angry at\nthem no I'm I'm ashamed I'm not angry at\nyou for bringing this up necessarily\nthough that can be activated I'm feeling\nshame and I want tenderness versus you\nknow I would feel shame get angry get\naway from me was was the reaction so\noften so it's been uh\nyeah the body has been that place where\nI have found\nthe ability to separate out what is\nactually occurring inside of me yeah\ncool man yeah yeah love the ground\nmy guy\num yeah you know it's interesting I I\ndon't know if I'd quite call this a\nmeditation technique but\nI was uh working in a psychiatric\nhospital and and one day people were\nungrounded so I did something that maybe\ncould have gotten re-fired who knows I\nthink it was probably safe but so when I\nasked all my patients we all went\noutside so there's a group of about 10\nof us and what I asked the patients to\ndo is just spin in the circle we're\ngoing to spin around like a kid until\nyou feel dizzy and the second you feel\ndizzy laid on down on the ground\nso hyper activate your vestibular system\nand then like if you want to feel the\nground and you want to know what it is\nto be grounded this is such a beautiful\ntechnique\nbecause then you're going to feel the\nwhole world spinning around you but\nthere's one place of solidity and you'll\nfeel it on your back such an amazing\nsensation wow\nand I think we sort of know in\nPsychiatry that for people who are not\nin a good mental head space we tend to\nuse grounding meditations basically when\nwe teach mindfulness on the inpatient\nunit it's almost always a grounding kind\nof meditation yeah that's super cool I\nlike that the uh for I I think the way I\nfound the ground was not dissimilar\nwhich is I had to through uh you know\nfor me with psychedelics but I don't\nthink it has to be for anyone\nthe structure that I had built in myself\nhad to get broken down so that I could\nhit the ground so I could relax into the\nground and same thing that you're\ndescribing with the dizziness is I'm\ngonna I'm gonna mess up your vestibular\nsystem for a moment so that you can feel\nwhat is solid even when you're spinning\nand feeling and falling apart super cool\nwhat a beautiful way to put it so yeah\nyou can feel you know when everything is\nspinning you can feel yeah that's\nawesome yeah so what what are you how\nare you feeling about the conversation\nis there something in particular we want\nto talk about is that enough about\nayurveda oh I I will definitely ask you\nmore if you uh would love to love to\nhave you on our cast um but no that's\nthat's a really good understanding for\nme and I'm happy to go I've got time we\ncan go in any direction or whatever if\nit's time to wrap up I'm also cool with\nthat\num so I'm a little bit curious like do\nyou have thoughts about what's going on\nwith men nowadays yeah let's do it male\nMental Health\nyou know when you described men I think\nyou're dead on like what is normal for\nmen is to not know their inner World\num I feel like it's with the word that\nI've recently learned and appreciated is\nsubclinical which is to say we have a\nculture\nit has made normal illness so I'm not\nsure that what is happening with men\ntoday is necessary to occur inside of\nmen but I think yeah in our culture it\nseems to\num\nI could I'll speak to my cohort which I\nthink is a little bit different perhaps\nthan people that that you might often\nspeak to\nthere's um\nand forgive me if I'm wrong but I know\nthat you talk a lot about dopamine and\nand getting uh you know addicted to\nscreens and the uh inability to sit with\nboredom because you're just your brain\nstill like get me some more of that\nstuff and how many ways there are for\nthat outlet\num what I've seen in my cohort of men is\nmen that you know shunned that found a\nway to cut that off optimize that and\nthen leaned heavy into performance which\nis perhaps just another dopamine trap\num but what I see in them which is\nreally beautiful now that it's shifting\nis that they have\nuh they're disconnected from femininity\nand my cohort the way that we've dealt\nwith that is by going heavy into\nrelationships and that was like the one\nBastion and our lives where they where I\nand my friends were able to relax and\nnot produce not work sit back and watch\na movie because it's a date night and\nthat's acceptable on a date night and\nwhat has shifted amongst my friends is\nthat I feel like perhaps it's aspects of\nmature masculinity perhaps it's a more\nfeminine aspect in ourselves but we have\nbeen able to provide one another as\nfriends with space\nlistening to one another's problems\nwithout jumping in with advice judgment\nor shame in order like that's not how we\ndo it here time to like turn it around\nand change it\num and what I have seen from my friends\nand myself is that we're sort of a\ncohort of kids that were had super\nenmeshed mothers like that's all of my\nfriends\nand uh\nas as because of that we take massive\nlevels of responsibility we feel\neverything\num in in both the you know in a way that\nis beneficial and detrimental is our\nfault so we're constantly taking\nresponsibility and we can overstep uh we\ncan allow that to make relationships\ntoxic because the question is what did I\ndo wrong she said I did something wrong\nI need to adjust I'm not doing enough\nand as we are more there for one another\num\nsome relationships are ending with\ngirlfriends some relationships are\ntransforming and uh there's there's more\nsincere and open expressed love which I\nwould say I think that's a broad thing\nprobably across our society that men\nhave had to settle for respect as the\nhighest thing to Aspire to and do not\nhave a lot of experiences of Love of\nlike you don't have to earn you don't\nhave to earn it you just you are and\nthat's enough for you to be sort of what\nyou pointed me towards\num that's that's my broad sense for my\nlittle my little corner of people that I\nthat I interact with yeah it's it's um\nreally interesting to hear I I think uh\ncan I just process what you said for a\nsecond please please\nI I wonder\nyeah let me just can I think for a\nsecond yeah yeah\ncalculating your time\nhow common do you think it is for people\nto be enmeshed with their moms\nokay so my sample size is totally messed\nup because\nI'm not sure\nyeah I mean so that's what I'm kind of\nwondering is I'm wondering actually like\nmaybe the assumpt the mistake we're\nmaking is that we're assuming that your\nsample size is very specific to you oh\nwell perhaps I you know and okay I'll\nI'll be so bold as to make a\ngenerational claim that I've seen for me\nand if this reflects the people you've\ntalked to\num my grandpa was an orphan who fought\nin World War II I mean that guy\nGod bless him had a hard material\nphysical existence he had 10 kids that\nhe provided for materially and I don't\nthink was an emotional presence for\neither his wife or his kids\nhis daughter my mom and you know my dad\nof the same generation what they\nprovided for their children was uh in my\nSuburban town which I felt was very\ncommon was you're going to be well taken\ncare of materially and we're involved\nemotionally for like very much there\nwhen I see my mom though\nthe thing that was being processed I\nfeel like for her even as she had kids\nwas this I never felt like I had that\nemotional deep connection that I wanted\nwith my family let's do it now we're\ngonna be tight and um pendulum swung the\nother way yes and so my generation and\nthe people that I see around me\num they described them about the best\nmom in the world she was always there\nit's a lot of it's a lot of those things\nand I think what took me a while to\nacknowledge was not the wrongness of it\nfirst I acknowledged the wrongness\nbecause I was angry\nbut the pain that was\nthe enmeshed unit that we became from a\nvery very young age and did not fully\nindividuate and the way that I handled\nthat was I mean I told you I left the\ncountry I want to like I tried to get\nfar away from that but couldn't it was\nthat was like my system was so\ncomfortable with that sort of a setup\num\nand the you know the gift of having had\nboth the physical support and a lot of\nemotional love as well which came with\nsome enmeshment things is that I feel\nthe opportunity in my generation to make\na different mistake when I have kids\nwhich I had I don't know what that\nmistake will be but I feel that I before\nI have kids\nuh that I have the opportunity to do a\nlot of healing and a lot of okayness\nwith myself such that my kid is offered\nthe opportunity at least for me to just\nbe to just you know to be who you are\nyou do not have to tend to my emotional\nneeds\nI had I chose to have you my job is to\nprovide the love this is an asymmetrical\nrelationship and I'm totally down for\nthat\num and of course there will be things\nthat I that I receive and get from that\nrelationship but I think it's more in\nthe vein of\nthe joy of watching you be you is the\ngift that I'll get\num and of course I'll make mistakes and\ndo things wrong yeah\nbut yeah so that's I don't know if that\ngenerational lineup is is what you see\nwhen you talk to people but that's\ncertainly big in my group yeah I mean I\nI think that's that's what's so\ninteresting is because I also think\nabout\nbeing enmeshed with a mom is a\na not normal thing but the more that I'm\nsort of hearing you talk about it and\njust the the subjective\nthe subjective way that you describe it\nI think is actually sounds quite common\nto me yeah and especially as you're\nbringing in these generational aspects\nright so we had like the generation of\nWorld War II vet veterans who were\nemotionally unavailable\nfocused on material things\nprovided for their families right\nbecause that's what the major\nresponsibility\nand then the generation above us we're\nnew to these emotion things and so maybe\nthey got\ntoo emotionally involved\nand it's it's really interesting because\nI I'm not hearing anywhere that you had\na bad mom you know no she was this is I\nmean this is what people I'm so thank\nyou so much for reminding me and saying\nthat but people can sometimes think when\nI say this that I had a bet she was\nwonderful yeah and and yes and there was\npain and there was there was this thing\nyeah and and it's it's it you know I I\ncertainly that's why I sort of mentioned\nexplicitly because I'm not you know I'm\nhearing that you had a very loving\nmother Who provided for you and and took\ncare of you and and things like that but\nas you're kind of saying I I think that\nthere is I wonder if there is something\nyou know because something's going on\nwith men yeah I'm not quite sure what it\nis I I certainly see responsibility as a\nbig part of it like I've had patients\nwho were making seven figures and are\nsuicidal this is another really\ninteresting statistic potentially up to\n60 of men who kill themselves may not\nactually have any mental illness there's\nsome really fascinating studies on that\nwhere we're not quite sure but I think\none of the trickiest things we\nunderstand is or we're starting to\nunderstand and I'm really appreciating\nas a clinician is that suicidality\ndoesn't necessarily equate to mental\nillness\nyet especially with the men that I work\nwith\na lot of them it's not like their mind\nis malfunctioning so when we think about\nmental illness we think about pathology\nthis is not the way that it's supposed\nto function and for a really long time I\nthink we just assumed and we sort of\nstill do we sort of take suicidality as\na mark for and I definitely think it\nwarrants like a clinical evaluation\nbecause if there is an illness that can\nbe medically treated like we don't want\nto miss that by any means\nbut the really disturbing thing is that\nsome of the people that I've worked with\nI wouldn't really\nthey don't fit the standard profile of\nsomething like a mood disorder yeah\ninstead what I see is a lot of\noverwhelming responsibility\nan attempt to live up to that\nresponsibility\nand inevitable failure because the\nresponsibility is inappropriate and it's\nin many ways it's similar to what you're\ndescribing but go ahead\nno that I mean I'm not as familiar with\nthe broad patterns but when you do say\nthat that that matches very much my\nsubjective experience\num\nwhich is I think it's possible that\nthere is a generation and certainly in\nmy neighborhood there was of mothers\nthat wanted to heal through having\nchildren when I hear you know they\nwanted that that was\ntheir their connection point with the\nworld was to have that child as opposed\nto having a connection point with\nthemselves and then I'll speak only you\nknow to my own limited family there's\nalso the element that I haven't\nmentioned of the inability to\nacknowledge like there's a shame in\nacknowledging daddy issues if you're a\nman or mommy issues if you're a man\nbecause you know those those terms in\nthemselves can feel derogatory to\nmeaning or childlike but my relationship\nwith my dad had a massive impact on who\nI became the wonderful things and the\nnegative things are the negative things\nthe the things and one element of that\nwas feeling as if I contributed to\nlike when I saw him uh working to\nprovide for his family that I had made\nhis life worse when I saw his\nfrustrations and holding that he'd be\nbetter off without me and I and you know\npeople had different levels of\num emotional fluency with their dads for\nme mom was the I love you the hugs and\nall of that my dad was catch in sports\nand he was present but um the tenderness\nlike there was not that that level of\ntenderness had to dip by age three four\nfive I don't know when where we couldn't\ndo the hugs anymore and we couldn't do\nthe the sincere depth of I love yous\nlike that that that was inappropriate\nand as I look back it was like recently\nI've gotten some of them I've uh through\nsome of the work we've done together\nlike the hugs that he has given me have\ntransformed my life and I'm not I cannot\nexaggerate the the I could have done it\nwithout it and it would have taken me a\nwhile but oh my God receiving some of\nthat and going\nhe loves me\nI have been a gift to him\nwhat a what a\nlike earth-shattering for me to let that\nto let that\num in and I know that everybody has\ntheir own different family configuration\nof which that may or may not be true for\nthem but the I'm I don't want to reduce\neverything to the mother wound and the\nfather wound but that has been a real\naccess point for me to\nbecome more Soulful more whole and to\num\nnot fall into the categories that you\nare describing that men are falling into\nof you know self-harm and all those\nsorts of things it's so interesting\nbecause\nso many of the things that you're saying\ncan lead to some of the people that I've\nworked with\nyou know when you kind of say that to\nrealize that I'm a burden like that's\nthe first step on a path that can end in\na very dark place yeah I think the other\nthing that I'm I'm sort of appreciating\nis just how touch starves so Society is\na whole this is not exclusively meant by\nany means I think we're becoming a\nsociety where women are also\nincreasingly touch starved yeah\num and but men I I think I I know so\nmany men who like you said like we don't\nit's kind of weird but I almost sort of\ntalked this up to the the general\nhomophobia of the 80s and 90s right\nwhere I also grew up in a place where\ngay was a derogatory term like I grew up\nin East Texas and and to be gay was the\nbiggest insult that you could possibly\nhave and there was just a complete lack\nof acceptance and the other really\ninteresting thing that I kind of notice\nwhen I think about my own life is that\nit was because of that homophobia that\nmy friends and I were not allowed to\ntouch each other yeah right like we\ncouldn't hug or we couldn't do any of\nthat stuff\nand if you kind of look at you know the\nway we're wired I mean we're wired to\ntouch if you look at like Aboriginal\nsocieties and stuff like that I remember\nthere was I was in India and and this is\nmy first summer in India and there was\none of my friends or mentors was getting\nmarried so I was like 21 at the time he\nwas like 28 or something\nand he had two of his friends like come\nup to him and they like flanked him on\neach arm so he had one arm around each\nof their shoulders and they were like\nboth rubbing his belly\nand they were like like\ncooing at him I don't know what else to\ncall it\nand and you know my East Texas mind was\nlike what is this you know and they were\nlike joking with him about oh you know\nyou're gonna get married now and they\nwere talking about how he's gonna like\neat well or something like that and just\nthat level of touch was just absolutely\nforeign yeah\nand and like you know friends in India\nlike men will hold hands when they like\nwalk which is a little bit unusual right\nso like or at least to me it was yeah\nand so I think that there's there's a\nbig lack of you're talking about the\nhealing power of just like hugging your\ndad and yeah and like you know I wonder\nif that's a huge part of it like just\nI I think it is and also like the the\nlevel of disconnection for me from my\nbody that would have let me know hey\nthis is something I want like I couldn't\neven feel the lack of that uh it's we\nonly are aware of these problems because\nseven steps down the line somebody does\nsomething dramatic hurts themselves but\nthere's also I mean even the men that\nyou're describing don't have mental\nillness there's an entire I know them of\nsuccessful High producing leaders that\nare uh trying to medicate\nthe internal world with external success\nand they're not addicted to drugs in the\ntraditional sense but they are they are\naddicted to that cycle that uh for me it\ncannot be\ntended to in that way at least that's\nwhat I have come to learn and uh\nI think it's probably true for them as\nwell but yeah there's the the other ways\nin we're not even aware of yeah I think\nthat's well said and I think the\nunfortunate thing that I've found and\nthere's some Eastern teachings to\nsupport this is that I think you have to\nkind of go through that to recognize its\ninsufficiency so oftentimes when I when\nI work with people in general I mean\nwe're talking about men right in the\nsecond but I think it applies to women\nas well where\nyou know you can't know\nthat something is not going to make you\nhappy until you actually have it\nand there's a really interesting kind of\nuh conundrum in in the east as if you\nlook at all the people who attained\nEnlightenment I'm not sure if you're\nkind of familiar with this concept of\nlike you know Buddha became enlightened\nyeah\num so if you look at all the people who\nbasically are like the religious figures\nand if we kind of look at it from a\nhistorical perspective these pop people\nwere probably enlightened\nand the really interesting thing is in\nin India you know you have four castes\nand the highest casts were the brahmins\nor the priest cast and they were the\nclosest to God they were the teachers of\nmeditation but there are no enlightened\nbrahmanas\nall of the enlightened people were\nactually from the noble cast so Buddha\nwas a king or Prince\num you know like the RAM and Krishna\nwhich are considered avatars of Vishnu\nor also Kings or princes and so it's\nreally interesting because you would\nthink that\nshouldn't the priests be the ones that\nare enlightened because they're the ones\nthat are teaching meditation and there's\na really simple kind of take on this\nwhich is that you can't really\nmove towards spirituality Until you\nrealize that material Pursuits are\nunsatisfying yeah and so just talking\nabout you know the journey that you're\non like it's like I don't mean to demean\nyour experience but it's lovely to see\nhow you're on this journey and it's kind\nof textbook of like material success and\nthen kind of like finding yourself and\nthen like you know and and once again I\nreally don't mean to demean it because I\nhonestly not at all but Jim Carrey has\nthat commencement or acceptance speech\nhe's talking to I think college grads\nwhere he says you know I hope you get\neverything that you dream of so that you\ncan realize that that's not the answer\nand yeah I am so grateful to have been\nable to get those markers early in my\nlife and uh what yeah gosh so grateful\nto have done that and I and I wish\npeople the success that they imagine as\nlong as they're not hurting other people\npartially for that reason it's like I\nhope you get it and then you go oh is\nthis it you know is is this did this do\nthe thing that I thought it would do\num\nbut you had said something about men one\nthing that I just wanted to to mention\nsomebody brought this up to me and I\nthought that it was poignant was that\nwith the exception of perhaps handshakes\nand the occasional bro hug a lot of the\nuh touches that men receive from other\nmen are violent and meaning like you\nknow if you're touched you might perhaps\nit's spanked or it's a it's a knock on\nyour arm or uh you know God forbid\nyou're molested or something like that\nand it's I have felt and this is\nsomething I had to unlock that there was\na protectiveness in me not extending\nmyself towards other men there was I\ndon't want\nto let that like again a not knowing who\nI was confused maybe I'm that that\nperson and at times I think I could have\nlet that out with rage and uh\nso that there's there's uh self there's\nthere's another protectedness which is\nI'm not going to do that to you let me\nstay in my own private island of not\ntouching and not acknowledge that this\nis something that I wish that I had in a\nsafer way\nyeah it's it's interesting I mean I I\nthink that mirrors a lot of my own\nexperience when I started dating\num you know early on my girlfriend\ndescribed what I had as a bubble and she\nwas like any time I get inside the\nbubble like you recoil and she was very\nintentional about like bursting my\nbubble it made me really uncomfortable\nat the time I mean I'm glad that she did\nit now but\num you know it's it's so interesting to\nthink about I had not quite thought\nabout it that way but even in my own\nlife how like like touch was like alien\nto me like physical touch until I\nstarted dating and then yeah it became\nnormal more normal yeah for me I mean\npart of part of it and I'm working\nthrough it still\num to recognize\nagain because I I have the tendency to\nbeat myself up for the ways in which I\nfall short of uh perfect loving person\num but to recognize for me the confused\nlove that came from I'm not going to\ntouch you I am not going to argue I'm\nnot going to place my hand on you\nbecause some part of me is\nfears harm uh coming through me to you\neven though it's not rationally\nconnected there's an emotional there's\nan emotional hook in me especially with\nthe uh the people that I'm closest to\nit's like I can hug strangers but the\npeople that I'm closest to need to be\ntaken they need to be more protected\nthan than a stranger does I love this\nphrase confused love because I I Can\nOnly Imagine\nyou know how does like an eight-year-old\nor ten-year-old like understand that\ninstinctively\nthere should be some kind of physical\ncontact in a moment like this but that\nI'm not getting that yeah and and even\non a subtle level I wonder how at a\nminimum confusing it is\nand at the top and traumatic it is yeah\nand even just hearing your own story we\nwe did a stream on trauma where you know\none of the biggest things that I've\nlearned about trauma is in my opinion\nit's like the great chameleon so it\nlooks like all kinds of things yeah and\nit manifests in so many different ways\nit can look like ADHD it can look like\ndepression like chronic depression it\ncan look like even an endless Pursuit\nfor success\num you know it can look like so many\ndifferent things\nand so yes\nthe story is anyway go ahead\noh I I you just said endless chameleon\nI'm like yeah\nthat's that resonates uh\ngosh it's and it's also for me has been\num I think of it you know there's all\nthese it's got tendrils and it's like oh\nthis one thing affects it affects if I\nhug my brother or not it affects uh the\nrelationship I mean we don't need to I\nknow we're late in the Stream I don't\nneed to get into the particulars at this\npoint but it has had\nwide-ranging the various traumas of my\nlife have had wide-ranging effects in\nplaces that I would never guess and I'm\njust very glad to have well maybe that's\nnot the right word\noh it's just nice to reconstitute myself\nas well yeah it's just no I go it's\nreally nice yeah absolutely man because\nI think you know you mentioned earlier\nthat it kind of effect it affects your\nsense of self which is really what\ntrauma does yeah and and thereby it\nmanifests because then what happens is\nwe carry it with us\nand it touches all these other parts of\nyour life and even some of that hunger\nto be good\nright you can't have that hunger of\nbeing good unless you feel like you're\nnot good yeah and one of the simplest\nways and there's a lot of really\nfascinating science and even like theory\nof mind so if we look at young children\nthey don't have well-developed theory of\nmind\nso what that sort of means is that they\ndon't understand that there are other\nconscious beings that can affect things\nand so if I don't have an understanding\na cognitive development that other Minds\nexist out there\nif I get hurt it's my fault\nand that's actually like evolutionary so\nif you're like if you're a one-year-old\nchild who's learning how to walk and you\nfeel pain you have to accept\nresponsibility otherwise you'll never\nlearn how to walk because if you blame\nsomeone else every time you fall over\nlike you're never going to learn how to\nwalk and so we have some of this\nevolutionary circuitry but the downside\nof that the price we pay is that if\nsomething traumatic happens to us\nit's my fault and that's where you know\nthe subjective experience of that is\nshame but it's so much it's more deeply\nwired than that yeah and that for me the\nillusion of control I mean what you're\ndescribing is you know the the\nprotective illusion of control that we\ncan adopt at times in order to cope with\nwith difficult experiences is just you\nknow gotten blown out of proportion uh\ncertainly in my life and go ahead yeah\nyeah I was just going to say I think\nthat that illusion of control just like\nyou were kind of saying like everything\nyou're describing I think sort of I'm\nnot trying to diagnose you or anything\nbut it's it's like consistent with what\nI've seen and I think these are not even\nyou mentioned subclinical earlier these\nare not necessarily even diagnosable\nthings this is just how human beings are\nwhere you know if you were in a\nsituation where you were made to feel\nbad and someone else took power over you\nand you know if other people\nif what you feel is dependent on other\npeople I think you connected these dots\nyourself then if I can control the other\nperson I can control the way that I feel\nand so the way to control my feelings\nwhich first of all by the way you can't\naccept them right you got to control\nthem you got to make them go away gotta\nhave the good ones you gotta have the\npride you got to have the appreciation\nyou got to have the you know and you\ncan't have the bad ones is by\ncontrolling other people's behavior and\nso we see that too that control freaks\ncan sometimes that can be a trauma\nresponse\nyeah and and for me it was while not\nacknowledging that this was me\nself-medicating through other people it\nwas all I'm just so worried about them\nI'm so you know I just need them and\nwhat do you need them to be better for\nthem and and not recognizing oh for them\nfor me it was was a huge piece as well\nyeah I've never so Charlie seriously I'm\nloving\nso much of the way that you use language\nself-medicating with other people is a\nphrase that I've never heard before I\ndon't know if that's is that used\nelsewhere I I don't know I don't know\nit's brilliant bro like thank\nyou I had not read it I'll take credit\non the stream but then I'll give it a\nGoogle\nI mean I'm sure someone else has said it\nsomewhere but but just the way that you\narticulate stuff I think really captures\nthings oh thank you thank you I I can\nsee why your you know YouTube channel is\nso freaking successful because with the\nway that you use words is really amazing\ndude really I think you've got a gift\nwith words\nit translating Human Experience\nthank you it has been a real that that\nwas a huge and I know again I know we're\nalready down uh the gift of Charisma on\ncommand was to take something that felt\nthere's something deep in there which is\nI want to share my experience and be\nunderstood and\nthat has taught me to use language in a\nway such that I get a response or\nresonance and it's really\nnot the I I've had to learn it's not the\nonly way but it is a powerful way to be\nwith someone to be understood to be\nconnected and though not the only way I\nhave learned the value of sitting in\nSilence with someone and I've learned\nthings about myself and other people\nthat I have would have never been able\nto communicate uh or or feel in any\nother way so it's uh blessings and\ncurses often are are the same exact\nthing yeah I think that's you've\nstumbled upon a principle called advait\nvedanta which is non-dualism which is\nthat there's no such thing as a blessing\nor a curse that everything is just you\nknow what it is yeah well I'll have to\nask you on on uh when we have a\nconversation for me but I I'm so curious\nabout your seven years as a monk we can\nwe can table that for now but I'm still\ninterested no I think the the sentiment\nthat you just shared is actually a great\nplace to wrap up just about you know how\nlife is a series of blessings and curses\num so thank you very much for you know\ncoming on stream today do you want to\njust tell people so where should we find\nyou now should we yeah I mean Charisma\non command or you want to point us\nthere's a lot of things sales videos\ncoming out I'm not making them but you\ncan check out Charisma on command if\nyou'd liked it before I hope you\ncontinue to uh I have a podcast called\ndropping in we'll hopefully have you on\nsometime soon and you just have been\ndropping in podcasts and those are yeah\nit's all YouTube is what I do these days\nokay awesome man and um what about your\ndidn't you have one oh your DND thing D\ndon't thank you for not letting me\nforget yeah it's called Uh improv and\nDragons uh and it's got four episodes\nthat are out right now put\ngive it a look if you're not a DNB\nperson give it give it five minutes see\nif it if it's up your alley I put a\ntremendous amount of uh heart and effort\nI'm a novice in it and uh I'm very\nexcited to continue that storytelling\nhopefully in five plus years you'll see\nuh\nall of the lessons that I'm learning at\nthis first one which I recognize is uh\nin some ways leave something to be\ndesired but still has still has the\nheart in there will be\nuh borne out to a beautiful like\neverything ties together uh story in\nfive years so if you want to check out\nthe early days of that it's at improving\ndragons wow dude that's awesome so\nimproving dragons dropping in is your\npodcast and Charisma on command and\nthank you so much for coming Charlie\nyeah thank you for having me I wish you\nall the best on your sharp left turn in\nyour career I think it's gonna be great\nand if I can leave you with one last\nthing\num if it's if it's okay if I give you\njust a tiny bit of advice is that\nacceptable so one thing I would just\nstrongly recommend is you don't need to\nbe ready to have kids I know it sounds\nweird\nI I hear this too much where uh you know\nand this may not be true of everyone\nlike if you're not ready to have kids\ndon't have kids but there are some\npeople who are like I need to be perfect\nbefore I have kids and you need to sort\nout all this emotional stuff so that you\ncan appreciate like honestly my biggest\nlearning from having children is that\nthey teach you you try to prepare so\nmuch but they teach you so well\nand and you don't need to be ready for I\nmean they'll make you ready that's what\nthey do\nyeah and and so you know I'd encourage\nyou if the time feels right and if you\nknow you're with the right person or not\nwith the right person or whatever you\ndecide to do with your life but but\nyou're great dude like you're gonna be a\nfantastic dad like I I uh I feel really\nstrongly about that so that's the one\nthing I would leave you with thank you\nyou're good I hear that you'll be fine\nit'll be fine and and I'll have times if\nnot fine and that will be okay as well\nyeah absolutely\nso I appreciate that yeah take care man\nthank you so much for coming today thank\nyou so much all right do I click off\nhere how do we do the the stream thing\nI'm gonna click a button and then I'ma\nhang up on you okay sounds good okay\nwell that was fun chat\nso cool oh my God okay so I was taking\nFurious notes and I feel inspired to\nmake like a dozen YouTube videos out of\nthis\nso there's so many Concepts that Charlie\njust has such good language like his\nexperience his journey like it's the\nwhole package chat\nhe is he is a mega Chad he's a sigma\ngrind set alpha male all of those things\nand now he's getting in touch with his\nfeminine side which is the most Alpha\nthing you can do\nand you know there's the pursuing\nsuccess like also kind of bizarre that\nthere's like a history of trauma and\nlike all the success and it's like not\nenough and there's a little bit of\npsychedelics thrown in I feel like he is\nan encapsulation of all of the stages of\nour community because we have everyone\nright and he's kind of like\nall of them\nso I hope you all enjoyed it I hope you\nall learned something I'm truly just\nstunned and and it really makes me\nappreciate how much we can learn from\npeople who are not experts\nright so I think one of the biggest\nthings that we're we're almost missing\nin well I guess we're not really missing\nit because of social media and whatnot\nbut what I think is so cool is just\nhearing him talk about his journey and\nlike how trauma is like a part of it\nand has defined many things but also\nlike is a part of his journey and how\nhe's grown out of it\nI think you know a couple of takeaways\nso a couple things to remember one is\nthat psychedelics you have to be super\ncareful right we don't recommend them\nfor a reason\num we hear success stories the problem\nis that\nhow can I say this\nthe people who become successful\nYouTubers and have a lot of\nself-actualization and direction in life\nare the ones who had good experiences\nthe people who have bad experiences you\nwill never hear about I mean you'll hear\nabout them potentially from our\ncommunity because we talk to everybody\nbut you know so you've got to be super\ncareful about a selection bias there\num but a couple of other things that I\nthink he's just a walking advertisement\nfor I think one amount of like\nunderstanding your body\ngetting some therapy having a strong\nsupport network we saw some animals in\nthe background and I think like hugging\nyour dad right or like like engaging in\nsome sort of\nyou know meaningful physical contact\nwith like other human beings\nand I think so many Concepts that I\nthink are really interesting to think\nabout just about how men relate to their\nemotions and by the way this is not\nexclusively men anymore so I suspect\nthat in the next 20 years we're going to\nsee a lot of the problems that men face\ntoday women are going to be facing them\ntoo it's already starting to happen so\nloneliness touch starvation there are\nsome ideas that women can find\ncompanionship or love like whenever they\nwant to it's not really true I think\nwe've seen that in our community and\nhuge amount of gratitude to all the\nwomen who have spoken up in our\ncommunity and shared their experiences\nit's not necessarily easy to be a woman\nin this world it's not necessarily easy\nto be a man\nand and I think really about sort of\nunderstanding your emotions the role of\nyour emotions not retreating for your\nemotions there's just a lot of good\nstuff in there\nbecause especially what we see is that\nwhen see when you can't sit with your\nemotions\nyou end up out of control in your life\nbecause you don't control what you feel\nyou just control\nwhat you do when you feel something\nand so if my whole life is lived in\nreaction to my emotions\nother people get to control me because\nif they can evoke an emotion they get to\ncontrol my behavior\nand this is what we feel like sometimes\nright so you get into these\nrelationships these toxic relationships\nparents significant others friends where\nthey make you feel a particular way and\nthey manipulate you they're emotionally\nmanipulative\nbut someone can only be emotionally\nmanipulative\nif an emotion within you leads to a\nbehavior\nas long as that link is there you can be\nemotionally manipulated\nbut the moment you are able to be with\nan emotion and not react to it is the\nmoment that you will be free of all\nemotional manipulation\nand this too what do we do when people\nare emotionally manipulative we try to\ncontrol them we try to control the\ncircumstances right we try to put\nourselves in situations where they can't\nmanipulate us\nbut instead\nwe should be controlling this\nso I'm trying to prevent this person\nfrom being emotional I'm not going to\nanswer the phone\nbecause when Mom or Dad call they're\ngonna guilt-trip me into going home I\ndon't want to go home so I'm going to\navoid them\nright and if even if you think about\nthat that's emotionally reactive I'm\nafraid of them so I'm gonna not answer\nthe phone and then what do mom or dad do\nor whoever they find some way to get to\nme they call the cousins they message me\nhere they show up on my doorstep and\nthen they make me feel guilty for not\nanswering the phone don't you love us\nand we've done everything for you and so\nlike you're responding to your emotions\nresponding your emotions responding to\nyour emotions\nyou want freedom from all that learn to\nsit with your emotions\nand people say that's hard\nyou're right it is difficult it is very\ndifficult it is doubly difficult because\nwe\nspecifically avoid and ignore training\nthat skill when we're growing up\nstop crying or you are crying here let\nme give you a toy let me make the crying\nstop let me use something from the\noutside like an iPad or a phone or a\nscreen nowadays\nlet me use one of these devices to take\nyour emotions away maybe you use a\ndevice to take your emotions away having\na bad day let's binge watch something\nand so you lose control over yourself\nand if you don't control yourself other\npeople can control you it's that simple\nso if you want to get out of this\nif you don't know where to start you're\nlike my emotions are too much start with\nyour body\nstart with the physical sensations of an\nemotion that you feel and just sit with\nthose\nright so if you feel some kind of\nemotion just sit down close your eyes\nlay down on the ground go for a walk and\npay attention to what you're feeling\ndescribe as many things that you can\nthat you're feeling\nand as you notice each and every one of\nthose things you will notice that\nsometimes with increased awareness there\nis an increased intensity\nbut this is where there's a really\ninteresting principle of Neuroscience\nthat rotating the awareness through your\nbody reduces the impact of the negative\nsensation\nso this is kind of weird I'm going to go\nI'll explain this maybe in a little bit\nmore detail so there's a study there's\nstudies done on people with chronic pain\nokay\nyou guys want like a mini lecture like\nwe're gonna\nokay so let's understand that people\ndon't understand how pain works so we're\ngoing to talk about this so in our brain\nwe have this thing called the\nsomatosensory cortex and in the somatos\nsensory cortex we have something called\nthe homunculus\ndo you guys know what this is\nso I'm going to try to pull up\noh man\nokay here we go the cortical homunculus\nokay you all see this so this thing\nis the cortical homunculus\nso in the part of our brain where we\nfeel Sensations\nwe have a map of our brain so if I touch\nsomeone let's say over here or sorry if\nI touch someone on their hip let's say\nthis part of their brain lines up and so\nwhat you'll kind of see is that some\nparts of the brain are big in some parts\nI mean some parts of the body are big\nand some are small so if you look at the\nhand why is the hand so big it's because\nliterally more of our brain\nis focused on the hands so that's why we\ncan touch things very finely here\nwhereas if you look at things like the\nback there's less of our brain is\ndevoted to that\nso the bigger the part on the homunculus\nis the more sensitive we are to touch\nso researchers were looking at chronic\npain\nokay\nand we had this map\nof our body in our brain that's where\nour somatosensory cortexes that we feel\ntouch and so what they noticed\nor a couple things the first is that the\nhomunculus is not fixed\nthat a particular part of the more of\nour brain can be focused on one part of\nour body\nand that the funkules actually rotates\naround so our whole Savannah sensory\ncortex is not can be locked into one\narea\nso if for example I'm getting a massage\nand someone is rubbing my shoulders the\nmajority of my somatosensory cortex will\nbe tuned into the shoulders it's\nactually a lot more fluid than the\nhomunculus would suggest so that's\nactually an incorrect representation\nthere's fluidity in our somatosensory\ncortex\nwhat does this mean for pain\nso what we found in people who have\nchronic pain is that they're homunculus\nis not fluid there is a part of their\nbrain that is locked in\nto a particular part of their body that\nis the party that has that part that is\nthe part part of the body that has pain\nand now so what we thought\nwas that since someone is hurting more\nof their brain is focusing on the pain\nbut it's actually a two-way street it's\nbecause the brain is locked into the\narea where the chronic pain exists that\nexacerbates the pain\nif you all want to understand this very\nsimply if you're getting an injection if\nyou're distracted by something the\ninjection will hurt less if you are\nprimed to the injection like getting a\nblood draw or you know getting a shot\nthen it will hurt more what we pay\nattention to is what hurts\nso how do you fix chronic pain really\nfascinating you rotate the awareness\nthroughout the body\nso as you focus on a different part the\npain actually goes down and once you do\nrotating awareness of the body like\nthrough a body scan in meditation\nthen what happens is it frees up the\nhomunculus and it's no longer locked\ninto the painful part\nfascinating\nokay so this research you guys can look\nup the the lab so there was a someone\nnamed Dr Kerr at Harvard Medical School\nwho was a specialist in this kind of\nstuff did somata sensory research\nand she had a very young research\nassistant at the time you may find a\npublication for current This research\nassistant\nso this is what's interesting when it\ncomes to understanding your emotions if\nyou say my emotions are intolerable and\nfocusing on that part of my body will\nonly make the emotions worse\nthis is why we are going to use rotating\nawareness of the body\nand if you notice one sensation and then\nnotice the next and notice the next and\nnotice the next all of them will\ndecrease\nand you will be able to tolerate the\nmotion if you can tolerate the emotion\nand you can cause it to kind of melt\naway then you will not react to it and\nyou will not be controlled by it\nsimple\nhard to do takes practice but simple\ntons of Neuroscience to support it\nquestions\nwill this work if I get stabbed what a\nfascinating question\nthe answer is probably to some extent\nright so we know that Adept meditators\ncan actually resist painful stimuli\nthis there's there have been studies on\nI wouldn't you know I think if you got\nto do something go for it but you know\nthat's not an experiment that anybody\nshould be running\num\nis it possible to sit with our for our\nemotions for too long\nI'm going to go ahead and say no\nso let me explain what I mean\nsitting with your emotions for too long\nis probably not going to happen\nwhat oftentimes happens the too long\npart comes from not sitting with our\nemotion but engaging with our emotion\nso when we engage with our emotion we\ngive it life we give it strength we give\nit energy\nso if I'm feeling bad about myself and I\ngot dumped by my ex\nand I'm feeling a particular way and\nthen I go stalk my ex on social media\nI'm engaging with the emotion\nin each picture I see of my ex out there\nhaving fun maybe dating other people is\nare they dating are they not dating I\nsee pictures of her with someone else\nthat's engaging with our emotion it's\nnot sitting with it\nand so if we engage it it gets energy\nand you all may have seen this where you\ncan engage with your anxiety you can try\nto fix your anxiety right you can feed\nit let me run through all the\npermutations\nand so you go on\nworking with it working with it you even\ntry to conquer it you try to suppress it\nyou try to push it away and it comes\nroaring back the second you let down the\nWalls\nso if people sort of think okay can I\nsit too long with my emotions no you can\nengage with them and the more you engage\nwith them the stronger they'll become\nbut sitting with them generally speaking\ndecreases it\nnow some people may say but I've sat\nwith my emotions for a long time and it\ndoesn't work\nto which I would say okay first of all\nI'm sure that there's a portion of the\npopulation that that may be true for but\nI'd say that even in my experience I\ndon't think you you're sitting with it\ncorrectly but you've got to be careful\nabout right because\nthere's a side note that we've got to be\nreally careful about if we say hey\nsomething doesn't work for you you need\nto try harder that's a very dangerous\nthing because ha you know it's an\ninfallible hypothesis if you're not\ntrying hard enough then\nit could you know it's kind of like when\nI talk to some people some people will\nyou know pick something like let's say\nprayer nothing against Prayer by the way\nbut people will be like yeah you know\nthe reason these are problems are\nhappening is because you're not praying\nhard enough it's like that's an\nunfalsifiable hypothesis at the same\ntime I've worked with a ton of people\nwho've been depressed for a very long\ntime and they've tried sitting with\ntheir depression\nand usually what happens if they're\nsitting with their depression for a long\ntime it doesn't work is that the\ndepression is a cover for something else\nso what they really need to be sitting\nwith is underneath the depression\nI've tried sitting with anger but it\nnever works that's because you have to\nsit with what's fueling underneath\nand in the case of depression what is it\nit's self-loathing it's anger it's\nhatred it's shame\nit's not sadness why are you so sad\nbecause my life is going nowhere\nbecause I got the short end of the stick\nwell what's the emotion underneath that\nyou're pissed at someone else for giving\nyou the short end of the stick or you're\npissed at yourself\nfor being given an opportunity and not\ntaking it\nthat's what leads to chronic depression\nin terms of anger I'm angry angry angry\nwhat's underneath the anger shame I'm\nashamed of myself I feel unloved I'm\nafraid I'm unlovable\nand so I'm going to get angry\nat the opposite gender or maybe even my\nown gender if I'm gay\nI will hate this class of people because\nsomething I'm afraid that they don't\nthey won't accept me\nor they've rejected me and now I feel\nlike I'm rejectable\nand so if I lack that self-love I'm\ngonna blame someone else\nso generally speaking I think that\nsitting with an emotion works\ncaveats generally speaking it works\nso glenton is saying I can't feel the\nemotion that anger masks though that's\nalso common\nthat's why sometimes it helps to have\nsome help\nright so this is where like doing\npractices so if you can't feel it\nthat's because oftentimes we're\ncolorblind we're alexathymic\nand the cool thing is that we can like\ndo things to increase our awareness of\nthing things in the same way that you\ncan train your palate to detect certain\nflavors\nyou can train your sense of touch\nyou can train your ears so when we're\npracticing auscultation in medicine\nlike the first time I listen to\nsomeone's heart I couldn't tell what I\nwas hearing he listened to ten hearts a\nhundred hearts a thousand Hearts ten\nthousand hearts\nI probably listen to somewhere around\n5000 or so I would guess\nthen you'll be able to detect a lot of\ndifferences so if you can't detect your\nemotions that's why we have some of\nthese things like community events like\nright in the fields certain kinds of\nmeditations things like that\nright you can even journal or do other\nkinds of things\nokay\nso the voice is going out\nI want to thank all y'all for coming\ntoday\num really appreciate I know we're at a\ndifferent time and especially our EU\ngang it's probably super late for y'all\nbut uh really loved having Charlie on\nand um really loved his perspective so\nstay tuned to the stuff that we're doing\nduring mental health May we're doing all\nof these things to help y'all\nand we're all about raising awareness\nbut we're also about doing more than\nraising awareness because awareness\ndon't cut it\nso we have a lot of different stuff\nhopefully things that are a little bit\nmore applicable to y'all\nthat will help you in some concrete way\nthat's what we're really focused on and\nthe reason that we have these kinds of\nconversations is to raise awareness but\nhopefully I'll learn something from this\nyou learn something you take away\nsomething from our addiction stream you\ntake away something from our trauma\nstream you understand that trauma is now\na chameleon and that maybe you're not\nscrewed up and you don't you're not a\nwaste of space maybe there's a part of\nyou that feels that way because you were\ntaught that about yourself\nbecause someone else made you feel that\nway but that doesn't mean it's true for\nyou\nand so our hope is that by elevating not\njust awareness of mental health but\nawareness of yourself that we're able to\nhelp you\nand as always stay tuned to our twitch\nYouTube whatever Twitter\num and even if you all you know if you\nguys haven't checked out things like Dr\nK's guide or coaching feel free to check\nthem out that's where we have more\ncomprehensive resources that are like we\nanswer all the questions\num because if y'all have Bunches of\nquestions about things like ADHD\nmotivation meditation depression anxiety\nunderstanding yourself understanding\nyour identity that's all in Dr K's guide\ncheck out coaching if y'all are looking\nfor one-on-one support or group support\nwe see a lot of benefits for people who\nactually it's interesting because a lot\nof this Charisma on command stuff is\nlike stuff we kind of practice not those\nspecifics but we practice a lot of\nemotional awareness awareness of\nyourself how to interact with other\npeople how to listen that's part of the\nthose are the tools of group coaching so\nthen we tackle particular problems using\nthose tools but you have to learn\nemotional awareness how to listen to\nyourself other people will be listening\nto you\nthey'll learn how to ask you questions\nso that you can gain understanding of\nyourself that all happens in groups so\ndefinitely check that out\nand if y'all are not interested in that\nstuff or whatever but you still\nappreciate what we do\nplease just share what we do with other\npeople so that helps us too so you know\nif you guys donate and stuff that's cool\nbut if y'all can't afford that totally\nfine as well we've got healthy gamers in\nabout 132 countries across the world at\nthis point\nso feel free to just share our Resources\nwith other people that's why we build\nthem and that's why most of our stuff is\navailable completely for free\nand the last thing is if y'all are\nlooking for other kinds of events and\nthings like that if you guys are looking\nfor more accountability and involvement\ncheck out our Discord server\ncool\nwe'll see y'all I think on Wednesday and\nthen where\nI think at Amer or I'm going to be at\nAmerican Psychiatric association on\nFriday\ncool"
