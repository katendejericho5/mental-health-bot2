    "video_title": "This is How Emotions Ruin Our Logic",
    "transcript": "so we have to understand this really key\nrelationship between emotions and\nAnalysis which is that the more\nemotional we are the more likely we are\nto actually hijack our analytical\ncircuitry and then the emotions are\nactually in control and they're pulling\nthe strings of our logic so when I'm\nsmart if I'm a kid and I'm smart I start\nto lean on logic more and more and more\nso what we sort of see is that kids who\nare smart and are quite logical will use\nlogic to solve their problems it makes\nsense right so if I'm logical and if I'm\nsmart I'm going to use my intellect to\nsolve problems what that means though is\nthat we tend to have underdeveloped\nfaculties when it comes to emotional\nawareness and emotional processing so if\nyou look at kids who are very logical\nthey will use their logic to overcome\ntheir emotions they will sort of set\ntheir emotions aside they will sort of\nlike suppress their emotions and they'll\napproach things in a very cold and\nlogical manner"
