    "transcript": "what is the one evolutionary signal that\nour brain needs to signal to us that hey\nthis strategy is not working how does\nthe brain know that hey we need to\nrethink how we approach this and we need\nto learn a new way of handling this it\nturns out that the most powerful signal\nto rewire your brain is starvation\nbecause a million years ago when our\nbrains evolved here's the sort of idea\nright so like if I'm living my life and\neverything is going really well then\nwe're fine we don't need to change\nanything because if it ain't broke don't\nfix it how does our brain know that\nwe're starting to screw up when we can't\nfind food anymore because our brains\nhave evolved for survival right not to\nlive in this digital age where we're\nbombarded with all the stimuli and so\nwhat's going on in today's society we're\nactually inhibiting the starvation and\nfasting signals that induce neurogenesis"
