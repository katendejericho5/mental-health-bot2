    "transcript": "we're going to be doing a deep dive\ntoday in the understanding trauma\n[Music]\nbecause trauma manifests as so many\nproblems and it's the kind of thing\nwhere trauma is sort of a whole brain or\nwhole person\neffect\nand so you can't slice it up into one\npiece because trauma sort of affects\nevery aspect of who we are how our brain\nfunctions how we form relationships so\nit's the one topic that it's been really\nhard for me to try to chop up into\npieces\nwhat does this mean for you what this\nmeans for you is that a lot of what I'm\ngoing to teach today may not fit right\nat the beginning because what I'm trying\nto do is paint a picture of how trauma\naffects a human being and so I I ask\ny'all to bear with me and stay through\nto the end and hopefully what we can do\nis help things click\nso what is trauma and how does trauma\nmanifest and this is where in my\nexperience as a psychiatrist trauma is\nthe great chameleon of mental illness\nand what do we mean by that that means\nthat trauma looks like\nall kinds of other stuff\nso what I've sort of found working with\npeople over and over and over again is\nthat they come in with a particular\nproblem like a lack of motivation or\neven things like I keep on making the\nmistake the same mistake over and over\nagain or I have chronic depression I've\nbeen depressed my whole life\nand it turns out even things like\naddictions all of these are trauma\nmasquerading as something else\nand so this may sound kind of surprising\nbut let's actually look at some of the\nmanifestations of trauma okay so let's\nstart with this so trauma is the great\nchameleon and what that means is that\ntrauma looks like other things so here's\na list of things that trauma masquerades\nas chronic depression\nso what does this mean this means that\nthere are some people out there who say\nI've been depressed my whole life\nso in Psychiatry we understand that mood\ndisorders like major depressive disorder\nand bipolar disorder are episodic so\nthey come and go but there are some\npeople out there who have been depressed\ntheir whole life okay it turns out this\nis more likely to be due to something\nlike trauma there's also other\ninteresting evidence to support this for\nexample there was recently a\nmeta-analysis that came out that\nchallenged or made a very strong\nargument that depression is not caused\nby a serotonin imbalance in the brain\nand if you ask them okay if it's not\ncaused by a serotonin imbalance in the\nbrain what is it caused by and they\nbasically said trauma okay so if you've\nbeen depressed your whole life or for\nextended periods of time could be trauma\nrelated\nsecond thing impulsivity\nor a lack of unifying\nDirection\nand how are these two things related\nwell I live my life kind of in an\nimpulsive way so I don't have any sort\nof Direction I just kind of do what I\nfeel like in the moment\nsound familiar\nokay\nnext up\nvulnerability\nto repeated mistakes\nwhat does that mean this means you make\nthe same damn mistakes over and over and\nover again\nsound familiar\nturns out there's data that that's\nrelated to trauma the inability to take\nrisks\nafford\nto take risks\nturns out related to trauma\nnumber five\nbeing a people pleaser\nI am a people pleaser\nI don't know how to stop\nturns out could be related to trauma\nthis is another one\nokay\nreally important one something called\nthe paralysis of initiation\nwhat does this mean\nthis means that sometimes we can't bring\nourselves to start stuff\nwe essentially live life in a reactive\nmanner if something happens to me\nthen I can respond to it if I have some\nsort of external stimulus I can act but\nI can't initiate things on my own\nturns out it's related to trauma\nnumber seven\ncan't\nmoderate relationships\nwhat do you mean by\nwe can't moderate relationships or maybe\ncan't engage in moderate relationships\nso the relationships that I engage in\nare super extreme\nso it's like\neither it's like we're BFFs or\nwe're enemies or I'm a doormat and this\nperson like treats me however they want\nto\nI always call them they don't call me\nright it's like there isn't balance in\nrelationships\nokay\nnext thing really really common\nis\nsomatic problems\nand what does this mean that means\nproblems with your body\nand then you you may say but Dr K if you\nhave problems with your body isn't that\na medical illness\nsort of so if there is a diagnosable\nmedical illness then it is a diagnosable\nmedical illness if you do something like\na biopsy and you have inflammatory bowel\ndisease and we understand that there's a\npathophysiology to your physical\nproblems right you have an illness then\nit's an illness\nbut what we see in people with trauma is\nthat they have all kinds of physical\nproblems\nwhich if you go to a medical doctor\nthey're going to tell you to see a\npsychiatrist these are things like IBS\nchronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia\npots\npostural orthostatic hypertensive\nsyndrome\nthere's all kinds of weird so if there's\nsomething weird going on with your body\nthat a doctor is like eh I don't know\nwhat's wrong with you\nchances are it's related to trauma so if\ny'all are\nlooking at this and you're saying but Dr\nK this sounds like really\ncommon stuff\nbut I thought trauma was like pretty\nrare like and maybe you're listening to\nthis and you're kind of thinking like\nwait a second like I wasn't abused or\nanything like that or maybe\nunfortunately you were but this sounds\nlike really common stuff that everyone\ndeals with\nyou are correct this is really common\nstuff that everyone deals with and it\nturns out that it's related to trauma so\nlet's do a quick analysis of some\nstatistics okay so remember when I said\nthat major depressive disorder may not\nbe caused by serotonin imbalance but\ncould be related to things called\nadverse childhood experiences or Aces\nthe percentage of the population that\nhas had adverse childhood experiences\ncould be up to 60 percent\nnow what we've sort of discovered about\ntrauma is that there are things called\npost-traumatic stress disorder\nwhich requires you to have like five out\nof nine of these very discreet things\nlike hyper vigilance and like\nre-experiencing and Nightmares and stuff\nlike that\nbut it turns out that the mechanisms of\ntrauma like all of us basically have\nsome kind of traumatic experience in\nlife right because our parents aren't\nperfect schools aren't perfect kids\naren't perfect and as we have these\nkinds of traumatic experiences we don't\nhave to have five out of nine it can\nmanifest as like one out of nine so even\nif you're not diagnosed with a\ntrauma-related illness because your\nfunction is not impaired you can have\nthis common crap and you can have like\ntwo of them and it turns out that we\nunderstand the mechanism of this stuff\nrelates to trauma trauma is sort of a\nunique illness and the reason it's so\ncommon is because trauma is not a\npathology of the brain or the mind\nit is an a normal adaptation to a\ntraumatic circumstance or experience so\nthis is something that's that we have to\nunderstand when we look at mental\nillness\nwe assume that mental illness is\nsomething in the mind that is not\nworking the way that it's supposed to\nit's a pathology so if you look at like\nautoimmune illness okay so this is when\nour immune system attacks us that is not\nwhat the immune system was designed for\nthe immune system was designed to attack\nthings that are not us okay\nso this is what we call a pathology it's\na part of my body that is malfunctioning\nwhen we look at something like let's say\nbipolar disorder\nwe're not and if we look at a manic\nepisode in bipolar disorder or psychosis\nright so in a manic episode we don't\nsleep\nand we hallucinate\nso the brain is not supposed to\nnot sleep it's a normal thing to sleep\nevery day it is also a normal thing for\nthe things you see to actually be there\nright like our eyes are supposed to\nperceive things that are there not\nthings that are made up bipolar disorder\nis a pathology it is a malfunction of\nthe brain but trauma is different trauma\nis not a malfunction it is an adaptation\nto a circumstance\nokay so this is part of the other reason\nwhy it's so common and white can\nmasquerade as so many different things\nbecause really what trauma is is our\nbrains attempt or our whole body's\nbeings attempt to deal with crappy\ncircumstances it's a survival mechanism\nright it's an adaptation\nthis is something that really needs to\nbe understood so if you have some kind\nof trauma and you're kind of screwed up\nas a result you're not actually screwed\nup and this is why I think there's a lot\nof Hope for people with trauma even\nthough their problems seem really really\ninsurmountable it's actually very\nsurmountable because there's not\nactually anything busted with you\nit's just your body or brain's attempt\nto adapt to a bad circumstance okay so\nthe circuitry actually works and we'll\nget into that all right what is like the\nmechanism through which the Mind adapts\nto stuff okay this is where I'm going to\ndraw a little bit on Eastern psychology\nbecause I think they explain it really\nreally well\nso as we go through life we have\nexperiences okay so something happens\nout there\nand if let's say someone I'm at the\nplayground and someone throws a ball at\nthe back of my head and it hits me in\nthe back of the head\nso there's some kind of sensory\nexperiences that happen there are\nemotions that come with that sensory\nexperience because what is an emotion\nan emotion is a very very rapid\nway to present information to my mind so\nI don't have time for analysis so\ninstead what my mind is going to do is\nit's going to make me feel angry and\nanger is a way that I know how to\nrespond rapidly in a situation so anger\nis like when we don't have time to sit\ndown and think about what's going on our\nbody has these scripts that it's like\nokay activate anger now that we're\nactivating anger like I know how to\nrespond immediately within the situation\nso anytime there are experiences there\nare emotions that come with those\nexperiences\nthen what happens is those emotions\neither get processed and digested\nproperly or they don't and if they don't\nget processed and digested properly they\nsink into us then what happens if we\nface that circumstance again like we see\nthe kid who threw the ball then those\nemotions arise back up okay so they come\nback up and now all that has to happen\nis I have to see the kid and I feel\npissed off even though nothing has\nhappened so our mind stores that emotion\nrecognizes some kind of pattern the\nemotions arise again and this is a\ntrigger okay now as we go into the\nscience of trauma\nwhat we kind of discover is that there\nare five major domains\nthat trauma affects within a person\nokay the first thing it affects\nis our affect which means our emotions\nso it changes the way that we relate to\nour emotions and specifically it does a\nlot of stuff with anger and also\nself-destructive Behavior\nyou may Wonder wait what does that have\nto do with emotions so if you think\nabout like a lot of the self-destructive\nbehaviors we engage in everything from\ncutting or self-harm to even things like\naddictive or shooting ourselves in the\nfoot or procrastination all has to do\nwith affect dysregulation\ntrauma dysregulates the way that we\nmanage our emotions\nsecond thing that affects is our sense\nour consciousness\nand\nattention so what do I mean by\nConsciousness so our ability to focus\nour ability to go to sleep or\nbe mentally checked in right so we'll\nstart to check out mentally third domain\nthat it affects is self-perception\nor identity\nas we go through traumatic experience\nand we'll go into all this detail okay\nit changes the way that we view\nourselves\nfourth thing it affects is relationships\nthe reason it affects relationships is\nbecause\ntrauma is\nalmost always inflicted by another human\nbeing and so when other human beings\ninflict trauma on us\nit changes the way that we view\nrelationships okay and so we carry\ncertain important learnings oh like\nwater and cold crocodile we start to be\nscared of any body of water\nokay the fifth thing that it affects is\nour somatic self\nso we sort of know is that there's tons\nof research that starts with even Freud\nwho notice that people who have\ntraumatic upbringings have changes to\ntheir body and they have lots of somatic\ncomplaints okay so these are the five\ndomains that trauma affects so what does\nit take for something to be traumatic\nthe most important element\nis coercive control an environment of\ncoercive control\nnow this is what's kind of confusing for\npeople because people think okay hold on\na second so isn't sexual assault\ntraumatic and the answer is it can be\nand then some people may say but hold on\nwhat about things like genocide isn't\ngenocide traumatic and this is where\nlike literally according to the data the\nanswer is that it can be\nso if you look at a population that is\naffected by like a genocidal War right\nand hopefully some of them Escape which\nis why they're still alive what we\ndiscover is not everyone develops PTSD\nnot everyone who's in a prisoner of war\ncamp experiences PTSD not everyone who's\na sexually assaulted experiences PTSD\nso what a trauma research has sort of\nfigured out is that a key aspect is\ncoercive control and what does that mean\nthat means that you grow up in an\nenvironment where someone is co-\ncoercing you and controlling you so what\npeople sort of figure out is and this is\nwhat's really interesting you can look\nat trauma research research and what you\nactually figure out is when researchers\nlook at\nlike guards from concentration camps and\nabusive parents what they figure out is\neveryone uses the same techniques and so\nhuman beings intrinsically know\nhow to control other human beings it\ndoesn't have to be taught it's\ndiscovered\nso here's kind of what happens in the\nmind of an abuser what they want to try\nto do is destroy your autonomy\nand so what they the way that they\ndestroy your autonomy is by imposing\ncertain kinds of limits\nbut this is what's really important so\nthey make some sort of petty or\narbitrary rule the rule doesn't have\nlike much function right it doesn't\nreally matter if I put my jacket away or\nput my shoes away but the abuser is like\num you\nyou do it in this order because I told\nyou so and so what they're doing in that\nmoment is destroying your autonomy this\nis key\nkey part of traumatic\npeople abusers\nis that what they want to do is if they\ntreat you unfairly all the time then\nyou're gonna mentally check out because\nthere's like this person is unreasonable\nthey're like the weather there is\nnothing I can do to control them\nbut the moment the person starts doing\nnice stuff to you\nnow suddenly you know\nokay I can get the nasty parent or I can\nget the good parent\nand so the way that they chip away your\nautonomy is by actually creating an\nenvironment where the person who is\ntraumatized feels like they are in\ncontrol by like not pissing this other\nperson off\nso they know that this person is capable\nof kindness\nand so if I behave properly then this\nperson will be nice to me there it\nengenders the dependence on the abuser\nfor all things good and all things bad\nright because that's the only way it's\ngoing to happen so I become dependent on\nthis person because this is the person\nthat brings me the treats and this is\nthe person that brings me the punishment\nbut if I ever get the treats from one\nperson and the punishment from another\nperson then I'm going to become\nindependent\nbecause I'm going to say F this person\nso the in the abusive relationship what\nthey actually do is they're very careful\nwe sort of see this we'll call it love\nbombing right\nlike this person is nasty to me and then\nthey love mommy what happens in the mind\nof the abused person is that this abuser\nbecomes God\nthis is the bestower of health and\nhappiness\nthis is the bestower of being able to go\nto bed at night\nwithout\nbruises on my body\nand so when this happens and this is\nwhat people will intentionally do\nthey'll create Petty rules right things\nthat are not justifiable and there's a\nlot of unpredictability\nbecause if there's unpredictability then\nthe person kind of like engages in the\nbehavior we sort of see this with loot\nboxes where when there's a random\nreinforcement schedule we play the game\nover and over and over again\nand so if I know that sometimes if I\nbehave myself if I get a chocolate cake\nI'm gonna keep playing the game over and\nover and over again\ntraumatic abusers were the original loot\nbox\nflute box 1.0\nokay\nand so over time what this person will\ndo is engender dependence on the person\nwho has been traumatized\nas we become\ndependent on the abuser\na couple of things start to happen the\nfirst is that independent action\nbecomes insubordination\nand when independent action becomes\ninsubordination what does that do to\nyour sense of autonomy destroys it if\nyour sense of autonomy is destroyed how\ncan you initiate actions you can't\nbecause you were taught that independent\naction is insubordination\nsecond thing\nis that in traumatic relationships\nthere is no room for trial and error\nbecause if I talk back\nI'm gonna get beat\nI can't test boundaries it's about\nsurvival\nno Impala or gazelle\ngoes up to the edge of the water and\ndebates the crocodile\nit's insane we debate people in places\nlike video games where there's no real\nconsequence we do not debate crocodiles\ncrocodiles we also don't debate\ncrocodiles but so this is where we see\nanother aspect of the paralysis of\ninitiation for people who are\ntraumatized\nwhich is that if I have learned that\ntrial and error is absolutely a mistake\nI can't try anything\nwhat that means if I can't try anything\nit has to be a perfect success\nand until I can get it to a perfect\nsuccess I cannot start\nso if you are someone who looks for\nPerfection before you get started could\nbe a trauma response\nso what we discover in research on\npeople who've been traumatized is they\nhave emotion focused coping so if I'm\nhurt I focus on fixing my emotions\nbecause I can't control anything outside\nof me\nso I can't stop my parents from being\nabusive I can't stop the prisoner I mean\nthe the guards from hitting me\nall I can do is focus on my internal\nemotional state because I fundamentally\ndo not have control around me\nso then my brain learns when I am\nsuffering don't change anything out\nthere because changing stuff out there\nis futile what I need to fix is in here\nso I'm gonna do what\nI'm a dissociate\nor I'm going to use drugs\nright so there's very high correlation\nbetween substance use and people who\nhave been traumatized\nbecause fundamentally the way that you\nlearn how to fix problems is within\nbecause I can't control anything outside\nthen you carry that learning with you\nso now when my professor says your paper\nwas due today and I did not receive a\npaper\nso I have to dock you 10 points\nbut give it to me by the end of the\nweekend and you can still get a Beat\nthis is a problem\nand how do we deal with problems we deal\nwith them using emotionally focused\ncoping so how do I fix this problem\nI get smashed\nbecause this hurts\nand what do I do when things hurt on the\ninside can I fix things on the outside\nno no no no no I cannot fix them on the\noutside so I have to fix it on the\ninside so when I have problems\nproblems\nare fixed\nby fixing\nemotions\nand in order to fix our emotions we're\ngoing to do stuff\nlike get addicted to substances\nand now we begin to see like why this\nsort of becomes an addiction because\ninstead of fixing the problem itself all\nI know how to do is use substances to\nfix the emotions because that's the\nstrategy that worked and if I'm fixing\nthe emotions and that's the strategy\nthat worked and I'm getting drunk let's\nsay or smashed then Monday rolls around\nmy paper is even later and now I get a c\nand now I get a c\nwhat am I going to do I'm going to drink\nmore and so it becomes a cycle\nof increasing problems followed by\nworsening emotions followed by increased\nproblematic behaviors\nso this is what's bizarre is there's so\nmany different things going on there's\nrelationships there's identity there's\neven the inability to concentrate\nthere's emotional suppression\nthere is inability to think about the\nfuture there is living life reactively\nthere is focus on emotional coping\ninstead of actually fixing your problems\nall of this is related to trauma and it\nmanifestes so many different things\nso many different things\nright our big list of chronic depression\nI'm a I can't stop watching porn\nI'm living my life like an NPC\nif someone comes up to me and initiates\nI can do stuff\nbut I can't have Direction\nwhat do you want I want an amalgamation\nof what other people want now what do\nyou want\nI don't know what I want why don't you\nknow what I want I don't know who I am\nwhy don't you know who you are well\nbecause my brain when I was growing up\nadaptively fractured different parts\ncreated problems like hemispheric\nlateralization and we are not even\ntouching on things like cortisol and all\nthis kind of crap\nand since I dissociate from my emotions\nand I have no upward momentum in life\nall of this negative energy and anger is\ngoing to start manifesting in weird ways\nin my body\nnow asking the important questions\ncan you change\nanswer is\nabsolutely remember that our brain is\nfragmented\nbut it isn't broken\nso I've had a ton of very positive\nexperiences\nas a psychiatrist\nin helping people with trauma people\nthink that things like borderline\npersonality disorder or narcissism are\npermanent because it's the way I was\nwired right\nthankfully not correct\nyou can put all these pieces together\nyou can absolutely wind up\nhere\nlike this again absolutely\nand the data even supports this\n91 percent of people have borderline\npersonality disorder will be in\nremission at the 10-year mark\nthe natural history of the human body\nand mind is to heal\nthat is the natural history of the human\nbody and mind that's what's super cool\nabout it don't give up hope because\nremember you're not actually broken\nnothing is I mean it's pathology but\nit's not a malfunction of some\nfundamental circuit right it's not like\nyou've got like a lysosomal storage\ndisease where there's some like\nneurotransmitter or some receptor that's\njust coded incorrectly and you're like\nSol not like that at all\nwe just have to put the pieces back\ntogether\nhow do we do that number one\nsafety\nand stabilization is like high cortisol\nhigh stress\nHigh emotion\nleads to dissociation\nleads to fragmented identity\nright\nit's the first thing you've got to do is\nbe safe\nvery hard to heal trauma\nif you're actively getting traumatized\na simple way to put it\nis you can't how to learn how to swim if\nyou're drowning\nthe right way to learn how to swim is\nget out of the water\ncatch your breath and then go in slowly\nso this is where I hate to say this\nand I wish that we lived in a world\nwhere you could just listen to this\nlecture wake up tomorrow and by force of\nwill\nfix yourself but it starts by fixing\nyour environment\nnow what does fixing your environment\nlook like thankfully it's so I would say\nstrive for Independence or limitations\naround the toxic people\nso this is where you don't have to fix\neverything\nwatch out for your mind that's like\nwhat it does with that right so look at\nthe reactions of your mind\nsometimes it's as simple as seeing a\ntherapist for one hour a week that can\nbe enough\nof a platform for you to rest on and\nstart to Branch out in the rest of your\nlife but safety and stabilization is the\nmost important thing\nthe second thing is we need to deal with\nanxiety\nand emotional coping\nwe need to the foundation of a lot of\nthis stuff is the disintegration of our\nemotions that doesn't mean the absence\nof emotions that means literally the\ndisintegration\nso this is why things like DBT or\ndialectical behavioral therapy\nare so effective we also have things\nlike EMDR\nWorks somewhat differently these are two\nevidence-based treatments\nbut we also know that things like\nmeditation\nexercise\nEtc can all work for this kind of stuff\nvery practically\nwhat this means is that if you are\nexperiencing some kind of negative\nemotion the most important thing to do\nis don't go towards the emotional coping\nmechanism\nokay so here's what happens when I have\nnegative emotion\nthere's emotional coping\nwhich reduces negative emotion\nand now what I've done is I've taken\nthat right hemisphere\nand I've shut it off\nbut the whole point is we need that\nemotion\nwe literally need the emotion it's a\npart of the integration\nso we've got to stop doing this\nnow this is what's super cool\nwhen we do something like psychotherapy\nwhat we do is we help this person take\nthat emotion\ngo over to Broca's area\nand put it into language\nnow if I'm about to say something that I\ndo not expect many of y'all to believe\nbut it is true\nlanguage\ncan substitute for action\nbiggest misunderstanding in society\ntoday is that if you have a problem you\nhave to fix the problem\nliterally\nFreud came up with this concept and it\nhas been tested\nlanguage can substitute for action\n100 percent\nwe see it time and time again in our\ncoaching program we see it in\nPsychotherapy a lot of people don't sign\nup for the stuff because they're like I\ndon't understand how talking about it\nmakes any difference\nthe problem still exists\nand literally what I hope I have done at\nthis point\nis when you articulate\nthere is integration\nwhen there is integration there is Flow\nState\nand when there is Flow State there is\nImprovement\nbecause here's the problem so here's the\nother thing to remember\nthe frontal lobes are here too\nthese are the parts of your brain that\nplan and execute tasks but as long as\nthis corpus callosum is severed that\nemotion you cannot use to fuel you\nso literally this is what we've seen\nthere are people who have been\ntraumatized and they will go to\npsychotherapy we will teach them how to\nintegrate their emotions and they turn\ntheir life around\nyou know how to find a job you know how\nto build a resume you know how to Google\nthat crap you know how to ask GPT to do\nit for you the problem is not in not\nknowing how to do it the problem is that\nyour brain doesn't do what it's supposed\nto do why does your brain not do what\nit's supposed to do because it's split\ninto a million pieces it's not a brain\nit is a thousand different fragments\nthat are all dissociated from each other\nand can't actually do anything\nlanguage is a substitute for action\ncrazy\nbut true\nand we kind of know this right so\nthere's like stuff about cognitive\ndissonance just to give you all a random\nexample\nif you get someone to say that they're\ngonna do something or believe that\nthey're gonna do something it makes them\nmore likely to do it you know what I\nmean\nso like that cognitive like once you say\nsomething you're like it's hard for you\nto not do it there's all kinds of\nconnections like literally in your\n[ __ ] brain\nBroca's area where we articulate things\nand the frontal lobes where we plan and\nexecute action especially on the left\nside of the brain are connected\nand we sort of know that like\nif we look at things like motivational\ninterviewing and coaching and stuff like\nthat our methodologies we don't teach\npeople anything we just get them to\narticulate it and you can't articulate\nsomething unless you understand it once\nyou understand it I'm not talking about\ninformation I'm talking about\nunderstanding then you start doing it\nand what do you do when you start doing\nit what is the thought that you have oh\ncrap this was actually way easier than I\nthought\nthis is the value of understanding\nunderstanding comes from integration\nintegration comes from articulating your\nemotions\nso articulate your emotions\nthe last thing\nI'm going to teach y'all a meditation\nick\ntatva\nabias\nliterally take 10 minutes a day 15\nminutes a day and just do one thing\nI'm not even saying make it productive\nif it's hard to do productive things you\ndon't have to do productive things\nput this away when you eat\nwhen you're taking a poop\npoop\ncompletely\ngrab a cup of tea and drink it\ncompletely\nwhen we do\nput your full attention into the one\nthing it can even be a breath\nfor one moment do it with me now close\nyour eyes\nfeel the breath\nthat's it\nand for a moment think about nothing\nelse\nchop wood carry water\nfocus on one thing at a time\nthat's it\nif you look at trauma treatments they're\nvery very complicated\nbut I hope today that if y'all have\nhopefully I don't know how to do this\nbut\nI tried to explain what trauma is\nso don't give up hope because actually\nthe majority of evidence suggests that\nyou will get better\nthere are things that you can do to\naccelerate it\nand the cool thing is that no matter\nwhich of these problems you have and\nmaybe the reason that you don't have a\ndiagnosis is because you don't have all\nof them because remember in mental\nillness we need the majority of it but\nwhat I found time and time again is\nwhether people are like directionless in\nlife living life on autopilot can't\nconcentrate keep on running away to\nemotional coping mechanisms this is a\ntrauma is the gold mine to transform\nyour life\nbecause it is the fundamental way that\nour brain works and the way that we\ninteract with the world the way we find\ndirection the way we execute tasks the\nway we form relationships all of it can\nbe found in trauma which is why it is\nthe great chameleon because it looks as\nlike a thousand different problems but\nit's all one problem and that problem\nhas to do with the way that your brain\nworks\nand if you can conquer this one thing\nand honestly it's not that hard you can\nstart I mean it's really hard but\nit's very doable\nand start with simple things like don't\nrun away from your emotions articulate\nyour emotions\nthe real tragedy of this stuff is that\nthe reason we suffer the Buddha says the\nreason we suffer is avidya ignorance\nwhich really confuses a lot of people\nbut this is why\nif you play a game and you don't\nunderstand the rules\nit's going to be painful but once you\nunderstand the rules okay item timings\nrotations\nthe flow of the map you can play the\ngame well\nand if there's one thing you want to\nlearn about how to play the game of life\nwell understand trauma\n[Music]"
