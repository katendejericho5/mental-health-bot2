get started so welcome to another\nhealthy gamer GG stream my name is Olive\nkenoja just a reminder that although I'm\na psychiatrist nothing we discuss on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice\neverything is for educational or\nentertainment purposes only\nif y'all have a personal concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional and hopefully you all will\nunderstand the importance of that at the\nend of today's lecture\nSo today we're doing a deep dive into\naddiction\nand I'll talk about that a little bit\nmore in a few seconds when I sort of do\nthe intro to the lecture\num but basically today is sort of like\nmy take\non how\na lay person should understand addiction\nand I think part of the problem that we\nhave is that oftentimes when we teach\nstuff about addictions\nwe're teaching things from a clinician's\nperspective so here are the different\nthings that we understand about\naddictions and like here are the risk\nfactors and all that kind of stuff\nbut the risk factors for addiction\neither apply to you or don't apply to\nyou right and and so\nit's kind of like\nif you're in a high risk situation for\naddiction like what do you do about that\nso today's lecture is going to be a\nlittle bit different because it's sort\nof\nyou know here if I was addicted to\nsomething and I have been addicted to\nthings in the past here are the here are\nthe things that I would have wanted to\nknow\nlike if I could go back and give 15 year\nolds self myself from when I was a 15\nyear old\nif I could try to explain if I just had\none hour or 75 minutes with 15 year old\nme this is what I would explain\nit's not a whole lot of detailed like\nclinical stuff there's going to be a lot\nof Neuroscience and a fair amount of\nclinical stuff but it's not about like\nbeing complete we're not going to talk\nabout particular substances like this is\nhow you get addicted to this we're going\nto talk about in general why do human\nbeings get addicted to things\nlike how does that work\nso this is part of our mental health uh\nMay initiative so here at HG we may is\nmental health awareness month and we've\nbeen sort of doing stuff pretty\nsignificant for mental health May for\nseveral years now it's kind of like a\nreally busy month for us it's a month\nwhere we do our best\nto help the people in our community who\nneed it the most we try to help Humanity\nin May a lot of people focus on Mental\nHealth Awareness which is cool\none of the things that we find though is\nthat awareness is like sometimes not\nenough right you actually have to help\npeople like get to where they go they\nneed to go\nso we are trying to do the most high\nimpact stuff that we can this month to\ntry to help you all the most so if you\nignore us the other 11 months of the\nyear that's totally fine but I strongly\nrecommend that you check out the stuff\nthat we do this month because we have\ntried to select the things because so\nmany people's eyes are on us at this\nmoment we've tried to select the things\nthat we believe will help you the most\nand so doing a deep dive into addiction\nis really a good example of that we did\na deep dive into trauma last Friday and\nwe've gotten an immense amount of\npositive feedback around that\nso we also will try to pick certain\ntopics that we think people don't\nthat people are sort of misunderstanding\nso we had a YouTube video about this is\nwhy you really feel intimidated so for\nexample like\na lot of people struggle with feeling\nintimidated sometimes they don't even\nreally realize that that's what they're\nfeeling\nand then we don't quite understand like\nthe psychological or Neuroscience\nmechanisms of why we feel intimidated\nand in feeling intimidated prevents us\nfrom doing so many different things in\nlife\nright so if I feel like these people are\nbetter than me or better looking than me\nor more popular than me or more\nentertaining than me then I won't go do\nsomething like go to a party or apply\nfor a promotion or go to happy hour\nafter work so feeling intimidated leads\nto avoidance and avoidance leads to so\nmany of our problems and that's where\nlike so kind of so we're trying to do is\nwe're trying to pick these issues that\npeople are really struggling with that\nthere may not be a diagnosis for\nright and that's what really we're\nreally about at HG is not providing\nClinical Services it's that there's all\nkinds of stuff that you can struggle\nwith with your mind in your life that\naren't necessarily clinical in nature\nbut we still can use all of our research\nand understanding in like even some of\nthe teachings of the Buddha to sort of\npackage that up and help you all\novercome a discrete problem\nand so feel free to check out that video\nit's something that I was really excited\nto make like I thought it was kind of a\ncool concept\num and so that's on our our YouTube\nchannel\nokay a couple of other things so in\ngeneral uh you know we have a lot of\nother product Services\num community events things like that\nwhich all are more than welcome to check\nout I understand that um like Ruthie our\nCEO did uh with one of uh one of her\ncolleagues did a really awesome Discord\nevent yesterday I think around like\nentrepreneurship or relationships or\nsomething like all of the above I'm not\nquite sure\num so you know we have lots of different\nthings where if you y'all are interested\nin stuff like that right so we don't\nlike stream entrepreneurship uh um\ncontent but where you know three four\nyears ago we started out with a team of\none which was yours truly and now we\nhave a team of over 120 people\nin over 12 countries across the world we\nhelp we've had like coaching clients\nwe've had over 12 000 coaching clients\nin 119 countries and our outcomes are\npretty good we're going back to the\nAmerican Psychiatric association today\nbecause of some of the work that we've\ndone I mean this this month because some\nof the work that we've done\num so we've got kind of good outcomes\naround that sort of stuff and where\nwe've got papers that are being reviewed\nfor publication all that good stuff\nand so feel free to check out our\ncoaching program I think we're full at\nthe moment but you can definitely get\nadded to the wait list and and you know\nnew spots open up every day\nso don't let that deter you and if you\nall are interested in more comprehensive\ncontent we've got\num some stuff coming out for you all\nhopefully by the end of the month so\nstay tuned for that and if y'all want\nmore detailed information on like Dr K's\nperspective on meditation like how do I\nunderstand meditation how do I find the\nright meditation check out Dr K's guide\nto meditation and then we also have\nguides on ADHD and doing stuff so if you\nwant to do a deep dive into motivation\nand behavioral change check out the\nguide to ADHD because it has a big\nsection on that majority of it is\nactually about that\nand then we also have guides on\ndepression and anxiety\nokay\num\nso yeah questions before we get can one\novercome addiction by himself what a\ngreat question we'll get into that\nOkay so\nhere's how I know how to start the\nlecture and how I know\nwhether I should take a question so when\nyou all start asking questions that are\na part of what we're going to cover\ntoday\num that's when I know we should start\nthe lecture okay so I'm gonna just\nanswer answer Jason's question real\nquick so what would it take to get the\nphase connect girls on here I'm not sure\nwho they are\num\nbut we actually are going to have a\nvideo coming out around a about Ai and\ntherapy hopefully within the next week\nor so so it's in post-production\nokay okay\nlet's talk about addiction\nso\nwhat we're going to talk about today is\naddiction but it\naddiction from sort of a subjective\nperspective\nso there's a lot of information we have\non addiction there's a lot of good\nresearch there's a lot of good clinical\ntrials there's a lot of good\nNeuroscience studies things like that\nbut the problem is that most of the\nresources I've seen on addiction are\nkind of coming from a clinical\nperspective so usually the resources on\non addiction are here's what we know\nfrom like research and we're going to\ntry to explain all of that stuff to you\nso most of the resources on addiction\nwill talk about okay what are the\ndiagnostic criteria for an addiction\nthis lecture is going to be different\nthis lecture is essentially\nout of all the work that I've done on\naddiction if I had one hour or 75\nminutes\nwith myself at the age of 15 what would\nI teach myself\nhow would I explain to a 15 year old kid\nor 18 year old kid or 21 year old kid\nthis is how addiction works\nwe have to understand why we get\naddicted to things and this is where a\nlot of people will get caught up in all\nkinds of different substances or kinds\nof addictions like are we going to talk\nabout internet addiction or binge eating\nor cocaine addiction or alcohol use or\nmarijuana or whatever and those are all\nimportant conversations\nbut the key thing is that if you are\nstruggling with something\nyou need to understand the underlying\nmechanisms that allow a human being and\nbrain to get addicted to a substance on\na fundamental level what is going on\nand once you understand the underlying\nmechanisms\nwhat you will discover\nis that if you're trying to ask how do I\novercome an addiction all of the answers\nwill be at your fingertips why because\nyou understand the nature of the thing\nyou understand exactly what's going on\nso if I'm playing a video game and I\nlose a particular match and I go back\nand I watch a replay if I understand the\nunderlying mechanisms\nof how do you win at a game and how do\nyou lose in a game then I can understand\nokay what are all the things that I need\nto do differently do I need to practice\nmy aiming do I need to practice my\ncoordination with my team is our\nstrategy wrong or our tactics wrong or\nis our Loadout wrong\nright so it how do you win a game is\nlike it depends on what's wrong\nand so once we understand all of the\nunderlying mechanisms My Hope Is that\nyou all will understand from kind of a\nstart to finish perspective how to\napproach your addiction\nor someone else's\nand so let me give you all a quick\noverview so we're going to start with\nNeuroscience okay then we're going to go\ninto and I hate to say this but we have\nto do neuroscience and Neuroscience can\nbe very intimidating I'm gonna do my\nbest to simplify it for y'all\nthen what we're going to do is\nunderstand how an addiction develops and\nyou may ask yourself wait why wouldn't\nwe start with how an addiction develops\nit's because once you understand the\nNeuroscience everything about how an\naddiction develops will become easier to\nunderstand\nso then we're going to go into things\nlike risk factors and environment and\nall that kind of stuff because we\nunderstand that\nthe development of an addiction has to\ndo with the circuitry in your brain and\nif we understand that then we'll\nunderstand how for example abuse in\nchildhood leads to addiction\nonce we understand that we're going to\nlook at sort of a snapshot of the\naddictive personality so once we\nunderstand developmental forces in\nNeuroscience we end up with a person who\nhas built a particular way and so we're\ngoing to take a slice of that person and\nwe're going to try to understand okay\nwhat is this thing called an addictive\npersonality what's going on here\nand then what we're going to do is go to\nSolutions and this is the one lecture\nthat I'm going to do where I think like\nSolutions are actually going to be 50 of\nthe lecture\nbut the reason that Solutions are not 50\nof the lecture is not because\nthere's like 15 15 tips to overcome\naddiction that's not what we're talking\nabout once you understand the underlying\nmechanisms you will understand that\nthere are so many different dimensions\nthat you can tackle an addiction in your\nlife\nand in my clinical experience and I've\ndone a fair amount of work in addiction\npsychiatry\nit's understanding how addiction affects\nevery dimension of your life that\nactually leads to the best results\nso for some people they may start to\nthink oh this is overwhelming because I\nhave to do so much\nyou don't have to do so much this is\nactually good news because if you're\nstruggling and you did not realize that\nthere are 50 things that you can do you\ncan start doing any of those things and\nmake progress\nso while the instinctive reaction may be\nto be overwhelmed I actually get very\nvery very optimistic when I have a\npatient who comes in and who does none\nof these things what terrifies me is\nwhen I have a patient who is doing\neverything right and they are still\naddicted\nthere's a lot of low hanging fruit\nokay\nso\nlet's get started\nso let's start with this\nwhat is an addiction\nokay\nso\ngenerally speaking the way that we\nDefine an addiction\nis that it is engagement\nof a behavior\ndespite\nnegative consequences\nokay\nso in a nutshell\nyou keep doing something even though\nit's a bad idea\nthat's kind of the definition of an\naddiction so generally speaking this\nresults in some kind of impairment of\nfunction\nso a big question that people have is\nhow do I know if I'm addicted\nright because you can like drink alcohol\nor use marijuana and maybe you're\naddicted maybe you're not how do you\nknow\nand the question is\nis it impairing your function in some\nway is it negatively impacting\nyour physical health\nis it negatively impacting your mental\nhealth\nis it negatively impacting your\nprofessional success\nyour academic success\nyour relationships\nand if you are engaging in a behavior\nthat is causing problems in these\ndimensions then that's the nutshell of\nwhat an addiction is there's lots of\nclinical diagnostic criteria and stuff\nbut this is where remember the goal of\nthis is to like help you understand okay\nare you addicted or not\nokay\nnow\nwe're going to dive straight into\nNeuroscience okay\nso\nthe first thing to understand is that\naddictions\nhave discrete phases\nso when I use an addictive substance\nthere is the first phase\nof kind of like enjoyment\nokay\nso this is where in the first phase when\nI start using a substance or playing a\nvideo game or something like that like\nit's fun\nmakes me feel better\nokay\nand then what starts to happen is as we\nuse the substance more and more we enter\nthis phase of habituation\nso at this point we're kind of like it\ndoesn't really Elevate us in a lot of\nways so at the very beginning there are\ncertain circuits that are involved here\nlike dopamine and the nucleus accumbens\nwe'll get into more detail of this later\nbut this is kind of like the first time\nyou do something there's no habit\ncircuitry involved right it's just kind\nof like I'm gonna do this thing and it's\nfun and like it starts and it ends\nthere's no long-term changes or\nadaptations it's one stimulus one\nresponse end of story\nthen what happens is we start to\nhabituate to it so as we get a stimulus\nin our brain over extended periods of\ntime our brain starts to adapt\nand then we start recruiting habit\ncircuitry\nand then the third stage of an addiction\nis when we're screwed\nokay\nin a nutshell\nand you may say okay Dr K what do you\nmean by screwed so at some point\nwe get to the point where our brain is\nso used to this thing where over here\nit's creating let's say here's our\nBaseline\nit's creating a positive move from our\nBaseline and our habituation use of this\nsubstance kind of keeps us here and then\nwhen we get to the screwed phase our\nBaseline actually moves down here\nand now what happens is we need the\nsubstance to feel normal\ndoes this make sense like we kind of get\nused to it and now what happens is our\nBaseline experience is dysmorphia I mean\nsorry dysphoria\nokay so this is the point at which we\ncan't function normally without the\nsubstance it's not giving us anything\npositive it is taking\naway\nthe negative\nin our Baseline is negative\nokay\nthis one we're screwed this one we're\nreally addicted at this point we can't\nstop\nand why can't we stop it's because our\nBaseline is down here so in order to\neven be functional in order to go\nthroughout your day and be able to work\nand hang out with other people and not\nbe stuck in your head and not be like\nfilled with like anxiety and and\nwithdrawal and all this kind of crap we\nneed the substance at this point we\nbecome dependent\nwith me\nokay\nnow we have to talk about a couple of\ndifferent neuroscientific mechanisms\nand and a couple of different\nneuroscientific systems and then we're\ngoing to get to parts of the brain so\nthe first thing that we have to talk\nabout is tolerance\nso imagine that I have a\nlet's say I have my phone\nwhich has a MP3 player and then I have a\nset of speakers\nnow I want so in my phone I've got\nvolume\nI have a thing\nokay and then in my speakers I have\na volume dial and then over here I have\nan output dial\nor this is the actual stuff that I hear\nokay so let's say that this is too loud\nthis is kind of the volume that I want\nand this is too quiet\nlet's say okay\nand so let's say that this is I'm going\nto sign a number 15 over here so I like\nmy volume at 15. so what can I do\nso if I have let's say a volume of 3\nover here\nthen if if it's quiet on my phone what\nI'm going to do is increase the volume\nto a 5 over here and so 3 times 5 equals\n15. conversely if I have if I jack up\nthe volume to 15 on my phone then I'm\ngoing to turn down the volume on my\nspeakers to still get 15.\ndoes that make sense so I've got two\nthings I've got a signal and I've got a\nreceiver and I have to modify those two\nthings to keep stuff in the middle range\nthis is the goal\nso what happens when we have an\naddiction\nlet's say I've got three molecules of\ndopamine\nand then I have\nfive dopamine receptors and the dopamine\nsignal that I'm looking for is 15. okay\nthis is like what feels good this is how\nI enjoy myself I get a 15. so I've got a\n5 over here I've got a 3 over here works\ngreat\nnow\none day\nI decide to use\nmarijuana\nokay\nand then what marijuana does is I'm\ngoing to add marijuana artificially ads\nlet's say two more\nand if I use it once it's no big deal so\nI get a 5 times 5 equals 25 holy crap\nI'm having so much fun this is more fun\nthan Baseline\nbut our brain is smart\nif I get five if I add two from\nmarijuana very very frequently our brain\nis like hold on this is like too high so\nthen what it ends up doing is it down\nregulates our receptors it literally\ntakes the receptor off of the cell\nmembrane\nand now we've gone down to three\nand so now what we see is that I have a\n5 over here and a 3 over here for a 15.\nactually this marijuana is not a great\nexample of this let's assume that this\nis alcohol okay a better example\nslight neurochemistry difference\nso now we've got a problem though\nbecause in this new system where we use\na substance regularly\nour brain adapts to it this works for\ncaffeine too by the way okay so now let\nme ask you all a question if I don't use\nalcohol\nI've down regulated my receptors\nand now I only have the regular stimulus\nwhat signal do I get nine this leads to\ndysphoria\nwithdrawal\nokay and now what's happened\nand this is the habituation process by\nthe way this this x right here is\nexactly what an habituation is and now\nonce we reach this point now we've\nbecome screwed\nnow you may Wonder okay and so we'll we\nstart to see a couple of things so one\nis that the risk of addiction increases\nwith the regularity of use\nthe more often you use it the more\nlikely you are to become addicted\nsecond thing that we know about\naddiction is that the size of the\nstimulus that you provide correlates\nwith the level of addiction\nso what happens for these people\nnow I I need this is a baseline okay so\nif I add two more\nnow I'm at five and then I get to 15.\nbut if I ever want to get back to the 25\nbecause that was fun right when I get\nhigh I'm not looking to be Baseline I'm\nlooking to have a good time so how do we\nget to 25 well we've got a you know\nincrease to about eight or nine\nso now what we need to do is get up to\nnine\nso we're going to add one two so one two\nthree four five six seven eight nine\nand so nine times three\nis twenty seven great\nand so if I start to use nine a lot\nwhat's going to happen\noh this is too high we need to get down\nto 15. so we're going to knock one of\nthese out right then we're down to two\nand now even though I'm using nine all\nthe time what I end up with\nis 18. well this is back to normal\nand now if I stop using 9 if I go back\ndown to five\nnow five times two is only ten\nso now I can't use less I need to use\nmore\nthis is tolerance we must understand\nthis principle\nokay\nnext thing to understand\nso there are a couple of like\ninteresting tidbits that come out of\nthis so in my experience anytime I\nif people space out their usage by a\nminimum of four days this is sort of\nanecdotal okay there's some Neuroscience\nto support this then the likelihood of\ntheir that they're addicted is very low\nif people are using daily likelihood of\naddiction is very high\nokay so when people are saying how much\nis too much depends on the substance\nthere's a lot of individual\nneurochemistry but I'd say kind of at a\nminimum\nit needs to be four days apart\nand generally speaking looking at drug\nhalf-lives and things like that\nideally closer to a week\nokay\nquestions\nuh are you all lost\nhold on a second\ndo you all understand this or no\nokay I'm gonna keep going then\nokay\nso now the next thing that we need to\nunderstand is that when most people talk\nabout addiction\nthey\nfocus on dopamine so this absolutely\nhappens with dopamine in the nucleus\naccumbens\nso as we acclimatize to dopamine this\nalso causes other problems like once we\nhave a low level of dopamine receptors\nthe problem is that non-drug activities\nfeel less fun because if we look at like\nthe signal from a book\nlet's say a book is a three and then\nlet's say something like going for a\nwalk is a two\nor listening to music\nis a three so then what happens with\npeople who get addicted is their\nreceptors are down regulated and things\nthat are otherwise would be enjoyable\nare no longer enjoyable enough and this\nleads to something called anhedonia or\nthe inability to enjoy activities that\nare otherwise would be fun\nnow this also creates a cycle because\nnow the only way that I can have a good\ntime we see this a lot in gaming\nespecially is that I have to play games\nbecause the dopamine stimulation from\nbooks just isn't good enough\nso I need High adrenaline stuff\nbut there's another really important\ncircuit that we need to talk about but\nlet's finish talking about dopamine so\nthere's a couple of other things that we\nneed to understand about dopamine in the\nnucleus accumbens okay\nI'm actually just going to talk\nnope\nJesus\nlet's lock that\nhuh\nokay let's go\nso I'm going to just talk about this\nokay\nso\nwhy does our brain have a nucleus\naccumbens so let's go back from an\nevolutionary standpoint\nas living organisms we engage in\ndifferent kinds of behavior\nour brain needs a way to reinforce some\nbehaviors and not reinforce other\nbehaviors okay our brain essentially\nneeds to learn\nso like let's say a million years ago\nwhere some kind of primordial organism\nand we've got like two\nthings that we can eat we've got like a\npotato\nand we've got a cooked potato\nand so if I take a bite of the regular\npotato and I take a bite of the cooked\npotato one of them is going to taste\nbetter and so our brain needs some way\nto like\nunderstand which of these two behaviors\nis better\nand that circuit is dopamine in the\nnucleus accumbens\nso when we do something that is\nrewarding to us and helps our survival\nwe will release dopamine in the\nsubjective experience of that as\npleasurable\nso generally speaking the things that\nimprove our chances of survival are the\nthings that give us pleasure why does\nthat stuff give us pleasure it's because\nthe way that we're coded\nis that if this thing helps me survive\nI'm going to make the organism feel\npleasure and if I make the organism feel\npleasure it will learn to do that\nbehavior again so pleasure and learning\nare tied together\nvery interesting thing and very\nimportant to understand\nthat's why we have both of these things\nhappen in the nucleus accumbens\nso now the question becomes why are\ncertain substances addictive and other\nsubstances are not addictive human\nbeings don't get addicted to catnip\nwe don't get addicted to\ndirt\nwe don't get addicted to ice\nso the reason that certain substances\nare addictive is because from a chemical\nstandpoint\nwe have all this circuitry mapped out\nand the circuitry is designed to\nreinforce the right behaviors\nso why is orgasm and sex so enjoyable\nit's because it's required for the\npropagation of the species right so\nimagine two sets of organisms one that\nhad no pleasure from sex and one that\nhad a ton of pleasure from sex which\nones do you think would actually like\ncontinue to survive right the ones that\nenjoy the sex\nso now what's happened in our current\nSociety is we we have figured out that\nthere are some plants out there right\nthere's like millions and millions of\nplants and some of them have compounds\nthat by coincidence activate this\ncircuitry\nbut now things are really confusing\nbecause when they activate the\ndopaminergic circuitry what are we\nlearning because remember we're learning\nsomething generally speaking though\nwe're supposed to be learning things\nthat help us survive\nthis is why the behavior becomes\nuncontrollable\nbecause what we're doing is we're\nlearning our brain is like we need this\nthing this is helping us survive\nso we learn and this is why like from a\nconscious level and remember this is in\nthe nucleus accumbens it's in a\nprimitive part of the brain that like\nanimals have\nso then what happens in addiction is\nfrom a cortical perspective your\nawareness or your intelligence\nrecognizes that this is a problem\nlogically you can look at it and it's a\nproblem but you can't control the\nbehavior why is that it's because you're\nlearning circuitry is like we need this\nthis is what helps us survive the very\nmechanisms that have allowed human\nbeings to evolve and survive not just\nhuman beings monkeys crocodiles fish\nthe very mechanisms that have allowed\nliving organisms to move towards the\nright behaviors are the same things that\ndrugs hijack and so now all of that\nprimitive mechanism is telling you to\nuse use use\nit has nothing to do with like conscious\nthinking or anything like that because\nnow your brain is learned\nthis is what I need\nand think about when you learn stuff you\ncan't like overcome it right so once I\nlearn how to walk\nlike I can't just start it's like stop\nwalking or start walking a different way\nor once I learn how to speak in a\nparticular language or once I learn how\nto use particular words it's really hard\nto like unlearn stuff\nso our behaviors are shaped by our\nlearning circuitry I know it sounds\nreally really simple but like do you all\nget that because I don't think most\npeople really understand that\nbecause what it does is it hijacks your\nlearning circuitry and then you learn\nhow to do stuff and then you do the\nbehavior automatically because your\nbrain has learned it okay\nso that's the dopaminergic circuitry\nthere is another circuit that we need to\ntalk about which is also affected by\naddiction this is no joke the Kappa\ncircuitry of the brain\nokay\nso we have these things called Kappa\nreceptors\nand Kappa receptors\nalso get adjusted when we use substances\nKappa receptors are sensitive to stress\nokay\nso what what happens is when we are in\nhigh stress periods\nlike our stress molecules like cortisol\nand more specifically CRF so it's not\nreally cortisol it's CRF it's a cortisol\nprecursor\nactivate something called the Kappa\nreceptor and so the Kappa receptor is\nwhat detects stress\nwhen we're stressed Kappa receptors turn\non Okay\nso the really interesting thing is that\nwhen we use substances of abuse\nthey up regulate Kappa receptors so\nremember that dopamine is getting down\nregulated\nare sensitive we're becoming numb to\ndopamine we are building tolerance to\ndopamine\nbut when it comes to the Kappa receptor\nWe are Becoming sensitive to stress\nnow let's understand why that is\nnow let's say I'm stressed out\noh no there's so much stress\nand then I start using drugs what\nhappens to my stress\nmy stress decreases\nso the more that I use drugs we're going\nto go back to this for a second\ntime to do maths chat\nso let's say I have three molecules of\nstress\nand I have five Kappa receptors\nand when I use drugs\nit reduces my stress if I use drugs\nregularly my body's like hold on a\nsecond we need to get to 15 brah we only\nhave one so what is our body going to do\nadd a bunch of Kappa receptors\nbecause we got to get to 15. and now\nlet's say that we have a normal amount\nof stress\nholy crap now if I have 15 Kappa\nreceptors and I have three stress\nmolecules I'm going to end up with a 45\nstress level\nand now I'm going to feel so stressed\nout\ny'all get this\nis the exact exact opposite but same\nprinciple of dopamine\nnow why is this important\nthis is important because when people\nare stressed out they will use drugs\nright because how do you modulate the\nsignal what have you learned\nabout\nhow do you control that stress if my\nstress is 45 and I'm hypersensitive to\nstress what can I do to make two of\nthose stress molecules go away\nI can get high\nso now we understand a really really\nreally important part of overcoming\naddiction\nit is\nexponentially more difficult to overcome\naddiction when we are in a stressful\nenvironment this also explains why we\nrelapse when we're stressed out what is\nthe connection between stress and this\nit is literally that and let's\nunderstand this okay so this circuitry\nthe CRF circuitry is the same circuitry\nthat activates if you lose a [ __ ]\nlimb\nso if I'm in a car accident\nand my leg gets knocked off heaven\nforbid that doesn't happen\nand I am bleeding out and I am dying\nCRF skyrockets\nI get a c i get 15 CRF molecules\nI have five Kappa receptors\nand I get a stress signal of 45.\nand so my body is like holy [ __ ] son you\nare dying do whatever you can in that\nmoment if my brain had learned some way\nto reattach my leg and stop bleeding out\nit would absolutely do that do y'all get\nthat if it had any behavior that it\ncould to make that stress go away it\nwould make it go away\nthis is the circuitry that is involved\nwith addiction\nit is our survival circuitry\nand so when we get stressed out this is\nwhat our body thinks and our body is\nlike holy [ __ ] son\nthis is terrible we gotta fix this no\nmatter what which is why we use it's not\njust dopamine\nit is survival mechanisms which have for\nmillions of years have literally kept\nyou alive which are now like going\nhaywire they're like do whatever you can\nto make this go away because we are\ndying this is the same circuitry that\ninterprets the signals for I am\nliterally dying and withdrawal are like\nthe same and if you talk to people\nwho go through withdrawal it feels like\nthey're dying there's all kinds of\nphysiologic signals and stuff there too\nright but this is really important to\nunderstand\nbecause this is also why stress leads to\nrelapse\nand we'll get to this more in a couple\nminutes\nbut now\nthe important thing to understand is\nwith the Kappa circuitry\nif you're in a stressful situation it is\nvery hard to quit your addiction\nand so dealing with your stressful\nsituation and managing stress is one of\nthe most foundational things at\novercoming addiction and the biggest\nmistake that people make in overcoming\naddiction is you try to overcome that\nAddiction in a vacuum and you don't\naddress the other parts of your life\nand if the situation created the\naddiction you can't overcome the\naddiction in the same situation I mean\nyou can theoretically but it's\nincredibly hard\nokay\nnow\nlet's talk about\nhow addiction develops\nokay\nI'm going to skip some of the\nNeuroscience we'll we'll do it a little\nbit more um\nwe'll we'll do some come back to it\nokay\nso let's talk about the development of\nan addiction\nso human beings\nneed three things growing up\nthey need nutrition\nthey need physical security and they\nneed emotional\nsecurity\nthey need emotional support physical\nsafety and nutrition\nso we have to understand something about\nthe way that human beings develop\nso the first thing to understand about\nhuman development is when we are growing\nup\nwe are not making new neurons we are\npruning neurons so when we're born we\nactually have the most number of neurons\nthat we'll ever have in our life in fact\nwe have the most number of neurons we'll\never have in our life even prior to\nbirth\nso the process of growing up is not\nlearn the process of learning is not\nmaking new things it's actually getting\nrid of connections\nokay\nso this becomes really important because\nthere are a lot of things that\nwill adjust which neurons we get rid of\nand I'll give you all a simple example\nof this okay now that we understand the\nKappa system\nIf I Grow Up in an environment that is\nstressful\nwill I prune my stress sensitive neurons\nabsolutely not\nbecause we require these neurons in\norder to survive and function in this\nsystem\nif I grow up in\nan environment of security our brain is\nlike oh all this [ __ ] that makes us\npanic and needs us to survive in these\nstress systems that keep us awake at\nnight and like you know make danger feel\nmore real we don't need this stuff\nbecause we're not using it\nif your brain doesn't use something you\nlose it this is why we forget languages\nthis is why we start sucking at video\ngames if we stop playing them\ndoesn't quite explain why we suck at\nvideo games even if we're grinding it up\nso if you grow up in a secure\nenvironment you will literally\ncut away your stress response system\nbecause you don't need it\nand then what happens is as you go\nthrough normal life you will experience\nless stress there are some human beings\nout there who are like kind of magical\nbecause they're like wow they like\nhandle things so well this is such a\n[ __ ] show and they're resilient and\nthey're confident in themselves that's\nbecause they've pruned away half of\ntheir stress circuitry\nright you're kind of weird\nso if you look at studies of mothers\nwith depression\nthe CRF remember which is the stress\nsignal in the brain and the Kappa system\nis up regulated in children as young as\none year old\na mom with depression will have a child\nwho's one year old who is hypersensitive\nto stress\nso now let's understand how does adverse\nchildhood experiences\nlike growing up in a traumatic household\nor whatever neglectful household parent\nand this is where we get to all the risk\nfactors right there's a lot of data\nabout this is a risk factor this is a\nrisk factor this is a risk factor it's\nreally simple you don't have to study\nall those risk factors all you need to\ndo is understand what is it what's the\nmechanism through which these risk\nfactors matter and the one mechanism\nthat matters is does this result in a\nsurvival benefit to having\na stress sensitive brain and if the\nanswer that question is yes it's a risk\nfactor for addiction done\nfinished\nso if I grow up with a parent who's\nphysically abusive\ndoes my brain need to be able to handle\nstress yes check abuse leads to risk of\ndepression I mean it's a risk of\naddiction why does it lead to risk of\naddiction because of the Kappa system\nbecause what happens is since our Kappa\nsystem is so upregulated I need some\nsort of artificial substance to down\nregulate the signal because my brain is\nso [ __ ] sensitive why is it sensitive\nbecause it needed to be sensitive in\norder for me to not get beat\nyou'll get this\nokay\nI see a question will I ever be okay 100\nyes you will be why because we can prune\nneurons later this is beautiful I know\nit sounds like oh my God am I screwed no\nyou just need to prune those neurons now\neasier to prune to neuron than it is to\nbuild a neuron neurogenesis is very\ndifficult\nthis is why there's a lot of Hope don't\ngive up hope okay\nso\noftentimes what we see is stressful\nsituations will basically increase our\nrisk of addiction\nnow let's talk about\nif we grow up in all these situations\nand let's just go through a couple of\nother points okay the first is that\npeople are like okay like what about\ngenetics\nso our current understanding of\naddiction\nis that it is a genetic vulnerability\nplus environment\nokay\nit like you can have someone who's an\nalcoholic who has a child who's not an\nalcoholic\nand now hopefully like I don't need to\nexplain to you why it is not just\ngenetics because you all understand the\nKappa system you understand the up\nregulation of the Kappa system when our\nbrain is forming\nwhich exposes us to the genetic\nvulnerability everyone has the genetic\nvulnerability what determines or not\neveryone let's say 50 people have the\ngenetic\nvulnerability why is it that only 10\npercent of them get addicted the reason\nis because some of them grew up in the\nkind of environment that primed their\nKappa system and made them prone to\naddiction\nwhat this also means is that even if you\nwere genetically screwed changing your\nenvironment can change the addiction\nvery important to understand\nokay\nso\nnext thing\nif we look at fundamentally so if we\nhave this negative environment right and\nour brain grows up in a certain way what\ndo we end up as\nokay\nwhat we end up as is something that\npeople will call kind of like this\naddictive personality so some people\nwill get addicted to one substance some\npeople will get addicted to all kinds of\nthings so let's understand this concept\nof addictive personality\nso addiction is about your relationship\nto the thing\nthe reason we get addicted is because\nthe thing\ndoes more things for you than it does\nfor the average person\nthis is why addiction forms so what do I\nmean by that so last time I checked I\ndon't have an alcohol use disorder\nso I'm not addicted to alcohol which\nmeans that I can have a couple drinks\narguably even have a good time and only\nenjoy it\nand then tomorrow I'm totally fine\nbecause all the alcohol does for me is\nlike it's some kind of arguable\nenjoyment I don't even really enjoy it\nfor some people it does other things so\nfor some people it helps us regulate our\nemotions\nso when I need like regulation of my\nemotions I will meditate\nor I will go in like get a hug from my\nkid or whatever\nright there are other ways that I manage\nmy emotions\nI feel pretty good I'm not trying to\nflex on you right so I'm just explaining\nso\nwhat what what happens is if I have ways\nto get my needs met\nthen I don't need the addiction it\nbecomes an addiction when the only way\nthat I can get my need met or the\nprimary way in which I get that need met\nis going to be through the substance so\nif my life becomes really really\nstressful and hugs for my children don't\ncut it anymore then I will need a\nsubstance to make myself feel better\nokay\nso what ends up happening is\ndrugs can start substituting and\nfulfilling other kinds of needs\nand generally speaking what we see in\npeople who are addicted\nis that the fundamental problem is that\nI am not able to manage myself\nso I require the drug to do all kinds of\nlike internal management\nand and what I I that may not make a\nwhole lot of sense so let me explain\nso if I grow up in a traumatic situation\nand I feel bad\nwhat is my solution to feeling bad it's\nnot to meditate it's to change my\nbehavior and react to my environment in\na particular way right so if I have an\nabusive parent the more invisible I\nbecome the more safe I will feel so if\nyou think about that child what does the\nchild learn the child learns that if\nthere's a problem in here where is the\nsolution the solution is out there\nonce a child learns this they this is\nthe birth of an addictive personality\nbecause now\nthe solution to problems in here comes\nfrom the outside\nso if I feel unloved let me go and have\nsex\nif I feel unhappy let me go get high\nand we'll even see the addictive\npersonality in like spirituality there's\nsome people who are spiritual addicts\nI don't I don't know like I want to find\nlike connection with the Divine so I'm\ngoing to go to this Retreat and then I'm\ngoing to go to this Retreat and then I'm\ngoing to go to this Retreat I'm going to\ngo to this Retreat I'm gonna do this I'm\ngoing to do this I'm going to do this\nI'm gonna feel connected I'm gonna feel\nconnected I'm gonna feel connected why\nthe [ __ ] are you going traveling all\nover the world to feel connected to\nyourself you're right here\nso fundamental problem that happens in\nthe addictive personality is that human\nbeings learn that the way to manage and\nrelate to this crap over here has to do\nwith outside\nso another thing that we see in the\naddictive personality is failure of an\nindependent identity\nthe development of an independent\nidentity\nso what that sort of means is that\npeople get Amalgamated with their\ncaregivers\nso whether I feel good about myself\ndepends on how this other person treats\nme\nthat my emotions become their emotions\nand why does that happen it's because it\nhas to happen for survival\nif I'm happy and my abuse of parent is\npissed off I better not be happy\nso I have to become one with them\nwhen they become pissed I need to be\ntuned into that I can't be happy anymore\nso we lose sight of ourself\nand now we're going to go back to\nNeuroscience okay so hopefully now the\nNeuroscience will make sense\nso what are the deficits that we see in\naddiction\none thing that we see nope foreign\nwe see deficits in the insula\nthe insula is responsible for\nintrospection\nand awareness of the self\nso what happens\nhow does this result in addiction\nso if I don't know so remember that the\nway I'm managing my emotions is through\nsubstances but if I am unaware\nof my emotions\nbecause I have been colorblinded to my\nemotions\nbased on the relationship of my\nstressful upbringing\nnow what happens is I'll tell y'all what\nan insular deficit addicts sound like\nDoc I was doing good for six weeks and\nthen I don't know what happened I just\nrelapsed\npeople don't just relapse there's always\na reason but it is the internal\nblindness from the problems in the\ninsula that result in a deficit in\nintrospection which results in an\nunawareness of my emotions and then as\nmy emotions\nescalate\nhow does how have I learned because I\nhave an addiction addictive personality\nthat how do I deal with negative\nemotions I turn to the outside\nand why do I turn to the outside it's\nbecause I don't even know what's going\non under the hood how am I supposed to\nfix what's under the hood if I I'm\ncolorblind to what's under the hood it's\nthe only option that I have is drugs\ny'all with me so we see insular deficits\nfor people who have addictions\nokay let's talk about a couple of other\nthings that happen\nso our brain is smart\nand it has this region of our let me\njust make sure I want to do this in this\nokay so let's talk about\nthe PFC in frontal lobes\nso our brain is smart\nthere's a concept called incentive\nsalience\nand so what our brain does is figures\nout\nthat not only is there the drug there's\nthe stuff associated with the drug\nthat then gets me primed for the\nenjoyment okay so for example this is\njust how our brain works so anytime\nthere is something that is rewarding our\nbrain figures out okay what are the\nassociated stimuli\nso for example if I go to a restaurant\nand I hear everyone's having a good time\nI see some people are at the bar having\nmargaritas I start to anticipate the\nenjoyment of the food and it makes me\nhungry so once you step into a\nrestaurant you're gonna feel hungrier\nwhy is that it's because our brain does\nthis really simple thing where it\nAssociates stimuli with like the reward\nso even though I'm not\neating yet\nthe associated stimuli with eating will\nmake me hungrier and will actually cause\na release of dopamine even then\nwhich causes me to Crave even more\nso when we start to use drugs what\nhappens is or other addictive substances\nis our frontal lobes get conditioned\nthrough incentive salience and then what\nhappens\nis we start to get cravings\nfrom Associated stimuli\nso what does this mean this means if I'm\naddicted to alcohol and I go to a\nbarbecue even going to the barbecue is\ngoing to make me want to drink alcohol\nthink about when you enjoy playing video\ngames\nwhen is when is the most hype right\nbecause the actual game sucks because\nyour teammates are [ __ ]\nbut boy it's like yeah like let's party\nup and let's cue let's go baby\nlet's go this game is going to be epic\nwe're gonna love it\nit's gonna be great\nyou with me\nso then what happens is we start to\nassociate all of these stimuli and then\nonce because our brain is able to tie\nthese things together it's like\npavlovian conditioning and then even the\nassociated stuff will trigger the\nbehavior\nso if for example I'm addicted to video\ngames and I watch things or I subscribe\nto a subreddit or whatever where people\nare posting clips of playing and things\nlike that if I watch Twitch stream or\nYouTube stream or whatever all the\nassociated behaviors will trigger the\ncravings\nokay\nthat's mediated by our frontal lobes\nthe other thing that we tend to find is\nthat people who are addicted to things\nhave impulsivity\nso they don't really think things\nthrough\nand they don't really like think about\nthe consequences of their actions so\nwhen people are addicted to stuff like\nwhen I queue up for one game right or in\nmy case it's like playing a turn-based\nstrategy game like let's say something\nlike SIV or Stellaris or I'm playing no\nman's Sky nowadays\nand like\nyou know or Total War Warhammer\nlike you don't load up Total War\nWarhammer for like one turn right it's\nlike one turn becomes 15 becomes 50\nbecomes 500.\nand so what happens in in people is that\nwe start to like we don't think about\nthe consequences of our actions this is\nalso mediated to certain degree by\nthe frontal lobes okay so we need to do\nand then what happens is if we have an\nImpulse which also relates to our lack\nof awareness we don't really know where\nthe impulse is coming from we'll engage\nin the behavior so ah [ __ ] it let me\njust load it up you also want to\nunderstand impulsivity and frontal lobe\ndeficits just look at your phone\nand what I mean by that is pay attention\nto how quickly you open up your phone\nwithout being aware of it at all before\nyou even realize it you'll open up your\nphone and you'll like be browsing\nsomething okay\nit's another deficit\nnext thing that we're going to talk\nabout\nso this is also where there's a deficit\nin an inhibitory control\nokay\nthere are other parts of the brain like\num reward and consequence prediction\nwe are already kind of talked about this\na little bit are impaired\nokay\nso what this sort of means is we don't\nreally think about the consequences of\nour actions when we use drugs or\naddictive substances we assume that\neverything is going to be okay like\nanytime you get you know I had patients\nwho are addicted to heroin\nthey're not like thinking like oh yeah\nthis is going to absolutely ruin my life\ntomorrow I only have 50 bucks left I'm\nhomeless I'm going to use all this money\ntoday and then unless I find 50 more\ndollars tomorrow which is hard to find\nI'm going to go through terrible\nwithdrawals and I'm gonna feel awful and\nI'm going to feel like I'm dying\nthey don't think like that they're just\nlike\nI've got 50 bucks now tomorrow is\ntomorrow\nokay another deficit\nthe last thing that we're going to talk\nabout\nis my favorite new part of the brain so\nhow do you all imagine we pronounce this\ncan you all read this\nwhat do y'all think how do you read this\nword\nlet's realize that I can't actually hear\naudio so okay that's silly\nokay so this is when when you get a\nyou know lecture that's someone who's\ntrying to give lectures in person you\nmove them to the internet I can't\nactually hear you all at all okay so\nthis is the Avenue\nokay\nthe habanula\nI think the habandula\nis the\nmost interesting\npart of the brain that we almost know\nnothing about or like most people don't\naren't aware of the habanula but the\nhabanula is like\ncritical\nso the first thing is the habanula is\ncalled the stock of the pineal gland\nokay so for those of you that know the\npineal gland produces melatonin but in\nmeditative Traditions the pineal gland\nis really important it's the physical\ncorrelate of the\nthird eye\nsome autopsies done in the 50s and 60s\nfound that lifelong meditators had\nengorged pineal glands so you take these\nmonks that like meditate all day and\ntheir pineal glands are huge\nthe pineal gland is somehow associated\nwith like spirituality\nand generally speaking for most human\nbeings the pineal gland shrinks over the\ncourse of your life unless you meditate\na lot in which in case it's engorged\nso the habanula is responsible for a\ncouple of things\nit's responsible for anti-reward\nso what that sort of means is that when\nwhen we think about\nthings that we will dislike the habanula\nis involved so the habanula like we\nthink about you know dopamine is like\nwhen we like something the nucleus\naccumbens and dopamine activates when we\ndislike something the habanula activates\nthe habanula is also where we get\nexpectation from\nso for example like right now everyone's\ntalking about how tears of the kingdom\nis such a great game so if I hear lots\nof great reviews about a movie or video\ngame or something like that I form an\nexpectation\nif I form an expectation my enjoyment of\nthe thing is likely to be lower\nso what part of the brain governs this\nprinciple it is the habanula\nokay\nthe last thing that the habanula does is\nsince it creates expectations\nthe habanola does something really\ninteresting it gate keeps dopamine\nrelease\nso just think about that for a second\nbecause now this should make sense\nso the habanable habanula inhibits\ndopamine\nand what does that mean let's think\nabout this if I have an expectation of\nsomething\nand the expectation is really high\nwhen I actually go and do that thing it\nis less enjoyable\nif it's less enjoyable that means\nthere's less dopamine but what is the\nconnection between expectation and less\ndopamine it is the habanula\nso in order\nfor you to get a normal or a high\ndopamine response\nyou have to miscalc it's kind of this is\nwhere things get a little bit confusing\nbut you essentially need to like\nmiscalculate your expectation\nthis is something called a positive\nlet me think about positive error\nprediction\nreward\ncalculation\nso basically what this means and I'll\nI'll explain it hopefully a little bit\nbetter in a second so first thing is\nthat as soon as we have an expectation\nit inhibits dopamine that's why it's\nless fun\nso in order to bypass that gatekeeping\nwhat you have to do is have an\nunexpected Joy\ndoes that make sense because the second\nI have an expectation I'm going to\ngatekeep and I'm going to inhibit\ndopamine release but if my experience is\nunexpectedly good\nI.E the habanula did not predict it then\nyou get normal dopamine\nokay\nnow let's understand this\nthis also kind of explains why oh like I\nwent to work and I was not expecting to\nhave a really good time\nand since I had a really good time man\nthat was so much fun\nso lack of expectations lead to\nenjoyment\nexpectations lead to less enjoyment\nby the way associated with the pineal\ngland\nI'm wondering does that have anything to\ndo with monks and meditation really\ninteresting right because what do like\nwhat all these like monks teach like\nwhat do we teach let go of expectation\nand enjoy will be yours they figured\nthis out\nso a lot of our meditative Practices Act\non the habanula\nby letting go of expectations\nand this is where even when you look at\naddiction\nwhy do we get addicted to stuff\nwe don't get addicted to stuff because\nit's as fun\nit's it's not we don't get addicted to\nstuff because it's just as much fun\nevery single time\nthink about when you play a video game\nyou play up one video so I play DotA\nright so like let's use mobas\nlet's be fair half of the games are [ __ ]\nwhy on Earth do we keep playing\nbecause every once in a while there's\nthat one epic game that you did not\nexpect\nand it blew away your expectations\noutmaneuvered the habanula gave us this\nburst of dopamine that we never expected\nand holy [ __ ] that is so reinforcing\nthat we're gonna do it again\nso when you talk to people who use drugs\nthey're chasing that first high this is\nwhy they've called heroin chasing the\ndragon\nright because every time you get high\nit's not the same you want that first\nexperience again you want that\npre-expectation experience again\nyou want that like epic game every\nsingle time you queue up but the more\nepic games you have the less epic they\nbecome the less enjoyable they become so\nyou need more\nthis is the cycle of addiction this is\nwhy addiction is a trap and it all comes\ndown to the habanula\nwe're looking for because think about\nthe things that you're addicted to think\nabout why you [ __ ] keep getting back\nwith your ex\nsuch a train wreck\nbecause there was that one time man it\nwas when it's good it's so good baby\nlet's go son\nI know it's not always that good but it\ncould be that good this time\nI know that 15 times it's been [ __ ]\nlet's get back on that horse son\nlet's she's texting me again\num yeah let's go I'm feeling bad about\nmyself let's text her\nI know it's a train like but remember\nremember back when it was good baby\nlet's go back there\nI want that again\nall of that [ __ ] comes from the habanu\ny'all with me\nquestions does that make sense I have no\nidea if I'm making sense or not I have\nnever heard addictions taught in this\nway I've never seen addictions taught in\nthis way so I have no idea if what I'm\nsaying makes sense\nbut do you all understand that's why we\nget addicted to stuff it's not because\nof what we expect it's because we are\nchasing the unexpected\nbecause when we first used that\nsubstance it was beyond our wildest\ndreams\nand if you all have used drugs you know\nexactly what I'm talking about\nthat first time that you really got high\nit was like Wow there is a dimension of\nlife that people who have never gotten\nhigh do not understand\nthey're the normies out there and then\nif you use something like heroin or\ncocaine or meth\nyou get this whole other you've unlocked\nsome weird bonus realm of life\nand then your whole life is spent trying\nto get back to that bonus realm but the\nproblem with our [ __ ] neuro circuitry\nis that the more that we use the further\naway from it we get\nand we're chasing it and chasing it and\nchasing it and it happens less and less\nand less and then we habituate\nto this right and then we enter enter\nthe crap Zone remember there's the\noriginal use then there's the\nhabituation then there's the word of the\nscrewed phase\nwe're now even normal life is no longer\nsufficient for us\nmediated by the habanula\nokay\nnow\nI think that's neuroscience\nso let's explain\nlet's go back to this idea of what makes\nus addicted\nokay so we're at one hour so we're gonna\ngo for maybe 30 more minutes okay I'm\ngonna try to wrap up\nso\nwhat makes us addicted is our\nrelationship to the thing\nand hopefully this makes sense now so\nwhat do you mean by the relationship to\nthe thing for some people alcohol is\njust alcohol but for some of us\nit is the way that we manage our\nemotions it is the way that we connect\nto other people is the way that we feel\nnormal it is the goal of life\nbecause man do I feel like I'm living\nso as we get addicted to stuff we start\nto run into different kinds of problems\nokay\nso\n[Music]\nlet me just rest my voice for a second\nokay\nso as a result of some of this these\nproblems in the insula and as a result\nof some of these problems with Kappa\nreceptors\nwe become hypersensitive to negative\ninternal States and we are also blind to\nnegative internal States so what does\nthat do to someone it messes with their\nrelationships okay so we also have like\nrelationship problems because we don't\nindependently develop in those traumatic\nsituations and we become really reactive\nto the way to the to our circumstances\nand so what happens when you put all\nthis stuff together is like you're not\nliving your life\nlife for someone who's addicted feels\nlike\nif y'all ever played those games where\nyou jump on a platform and the platform\ncrumbles away\nand so you have to jump onto the next\nplatform and jump onto the next platform\nbecause just to advance and survive\nthere is no stability this is what life\nis like for someone who is addicted\nyour whole life every day you get up and\nthe ground is crumbling away and you've\ngot to jump to something else you've got\nto jump to something else you've got to\njump to something else there's no\nsecurity there's no stability you can't\nbe with yourself\njust sitting there by yourself is\ncomplete torture so this impacts our\nrelationships\nwe turn to other people not only our\nsubstances but we turn to other people\nto meet our needs\nand then the problem with being addicted\nis that you're actually kind of two\npeople\nif you look at people who are addicted\nthey have the part of us that is like oh\nmy God things are crumbling and then\nthere's the part of us that is actually\njumping and Landing it over and over and\nover again so what you see in people who\nare addicted is that they're two people\none is falling apart and one is crushing\nit\nright there are the times where you're\nhigh and there are the times that you're\nactually living life you've got these\nfunctional alcoholics that are going\ninto work every day and they're crushing\nit right left and Center you've got\npeople who you're in relationships with\nand on some days they get the good\nversion of you where you're like let's\ngo you know\nDr Chad thundercock in the house and\nthen other days they get that reactive\nperson they get the terrified person\nthey get the person who's the floor is\ncrumbling underneath them\nand so the life of someone who's\naddicted is like some kind of weird ping\npong between two states\neither everything is falling apart or\nthings are going amazing and then what\nhappens is like what do you need for\nthings to go amazing you need the\nsubstance\nand so you avoid that part of yourself\nthat is crumbling you avoid the negative\nemotion you avoid you react to your\nemotions and you seek things outside to\nfix you internally\nthat can be relationships that can be\nstuff at work that can be drugs that can\nbe whatever\nso the basic problem\nis that you are not comfortable with\nyourself\nso then what we end up seeing\nas you go through life like this there\nare other consequences that develop so\nwe're just going to focus on one which\nis the development of Shame\nso as people use substances for longer\nperiods of time the one emotion that\ntends to rack up is shame\nbecause the the cognitive parts of you\nremember your higher order brain\nfunctions your analysis is intact\nit's all these other parts of your brain\nlike your expectation circuitry your\nlearning circuitry you can't learn but\nyou certainly know there's a problem\nand so then what happens is you start to\nrealize like holy crap like I'm my IQ is\ngood\nI'm talented\nthere are things about me that are good\nbut I keep screwing it up\nand so paradoxically what you see is the\nmost devastating self-esteem in people\nwith addictions\nbut the more devastating the most\ndevastating self-esteem are actually\ncomes from the people who are the most\ncapable\nbecause the more capable you are the\nmore of a [ __ ] up you are if you don't\nreach your potential\nand that shame piles up over and over\nand over again and as the shame piles up\nremember we're emotionally reactive\nso what do we do to fix it all kinds of\nthings out there\nas we do things out there as we react to\nthose emotions and we use more drugs we\nengage in more unhealthy relationships\nour life moves in the wrong direction\nthe more that our life moves in the\nwrong direction the more squandered\npotential we have the more shame we have\nand what is our antidote to shame get\nhigh\nthen we're stuck\nwith me\nso\nnow\nhow to fix it\ngood news\nvery fixable\nvery very very very very fixable\nnow I'm going to hit hit you all with a\nlot of stuff okay\nso\nwhat we're going to do to understand how\nto fix it is we're going to understand\nbrain stuff we're going to understand\nmedication we're going to understand\nPsychotherapy we're going to understand\nall the different deficits in the brain\nand things that you can do for each\ndeficit in the brain we're going to\nunderstand relationship stuff we're\ngoing to understand identity stuff we're\ngoing to understand professional stuff\nwe're going to understand spiritual\nstuff we're going to understand\neverything because real addiction\nhealing requires work on each and every\none of these levels\nand for those of you saying oh my God am\nI screwed you're not screwed at all\nthere's a lot of low-hanging fruit you\ncan get started in any one of these\nthings in the same way that all this\nstuff weaves together\nit can be dominoes in the opposite\ndirection\nso don't give up\nand if y'all think that I have a good\nunderstanding of this or if I've been\nable to explain something that makes\nsense to you have faith that I will be\nable to explain to you something that\nwill give you a road out of this give me\na chance chat\nwe start with the brain\nokay we're going to start with\nmedication\nso\nhopefully I've explained to y'all that\nthis is kind of complicated\nthere's environment stuff there's\nrelationship stuff there's emotional\nreactivity stuff there's spiritual\nperspectives\nthis is why medication is important\nbecause all that crap ultimately\nfunctions comes down to the brain right\nthe stress systems and all this sort of\ncrap the habanula the gatekeeping of\ndopamine all this sort of stuff the cool\nthing about medication is that\nmedications short circuits all of this\nstuff\njust like bypasses a lot of it right\nbecause all this stuff has to happen\nthrough our brain so if we look at\nmedications like Naltrexone\nso Naltrexone actually inhibits\nthe positive effects this is a sign for\ninhibition\npositive effects\nof things like opiates\nand once we inhibit the positive effects\nwhat does that mean\nif we inhibit the positive effects\nwe are shutting off the dopamine in the\nnucleus accumbens if we are shutting off\nthe dopamine in the nucleus accumbens we\nare not reinforcing that behavior and\nthere's also something else really think\ncool that we're doing we're not learning\nbad behavior\ny'all does this make sense because\nremember that the nucleus of Commons is\nresponsible for Learning and this is why\nyou keep on doing stupid [ __ ] because\nthe part of your brain that is actually\nlearning is separate from the part of\nyour brain that does conscious analysis\ncompletely different circuits in the\nbrain\nand so once we shut this thing off then\nlike all the learning of the bad\nbehavior also gets inhibited and it\nhelps people okay\nso there are lots of medications that\nyou can use the advantage of medications\nis that it just takes one of these\npieces and it just short circuits them\nand then you get all kinds of Downstream\neffects we're not going to go too much\ninto medications but they can absolutely\nhelp\nokay now let's talk about the different\nbrain parts\nso remember we talked about the insula\nthe insula is responsible for\nintrospection\nthe core of the problem is with no\nintrospection this is an i\nwe are unaware of emotions\nand if we're unaware of emotions\nand we are reactive in nature\nthen what's going to happen is\nwe're going to go about using drugs\nor whatever you're addicted to\nwithout understanding why you're just\ngoing to wake up one day and you're\ngonna be like yeah like yesterday I was\nable to resist but today I can't resist\nwhat's different who the [ __ ] knows\nmaybe the phases of the Moon\nno it is because there is emotional\nunawareness\nso there are literally studies that will\nshow that\npeople who have addictions do not know\nwhat they are feeling so how do we fix\nthis\nthings like body scans\nor even things like psychotherapy\nthese are both things and the goal here\nis emotional awareness we even have had\nour community event of right in the\nfields\nwhere we like trained people to increase\ntheir EQ\nwe suspect also things like coaching\nwill increase EQ\nwe have a study on that that's running\nright now so we can't say that 100 but\nwe're pretty confident\nso you may say what's the point of a\nbody scan so here's something that you\ncan do you want to strengthen your\ninsula\nbe aware of what you're feeling in your\nbody chest tightness\nstuff in the throat\npylo erection\nthat means your hair is standing on end\nright when your hair stands up\nand so then what you can do because\nwe're emotionally unaware right and the\nother reason that we're emotionally\nunaware is because we grew up in a\nsituation where we were\nwhere is this\ndidn't I write this somewhere\nI guess not oh yeah nope I didn't write\nit so we grew up in a situation where we\nwere not emotionally taken care of\nso as a result of not being emotionally\ntaken care of we don't know what our\nemotions feel like so we start with body\nscans\nwhat are you feeling in this moment\nstart to release that tension so this\nlevel of meditation of body scan\nmeditation can help us with insular\nImprovement\nwhen we do things like Psychotherapy and\nour therapist articulates our emotions\nfor us it strengthens our insula once we\nunderstand what our emotions that we're\nfeeling something then we can develop\nalternatives\nthe problem with developing Alternatives\nand this is the problem that a lot of\npeople run into they're like okay I'm\naddicted to stuff I should develop\nalternate Coke mechanisms it doesn't\nwork you're just like okay maybe I'll\ninstall an app and start meditating why\ndoesn't it work because you don't even\nknow when you're supposed to use the\ncoping mechanism\nyou're kind of like developing this\ncoping mechanism in a vacuum\nand instead like the coping mechanism\nneeds to be used when you're using an\nemotion\nor feeling an emotion and as you use the\ncoping mechanism when you're feeling an\nemotion that will reinforce the behavior\nand you'll actually learn how to cope in\nan alternate way\nteaching people to cope coping\nmechanisms when they're like\non the beach doesn't do you any good you\nneed to learn how to use coping\nmechanisms when you actually have\nsomething to cope with and if you are\nemotionally unaware you don't even know\nwhat you need to cope with\nokay so solution number one just the\ninsulin we have so many other options\nokay so body scan meditation if you guys\nwant one thing or therapy\nyeah okay remember the next thing we\ntalked about incentive salience and what\nis incentive salience I may not have\nexplained it very well this is basically\nconditioning\nand what does that mean that means that\nour brain learns that there are\nassociated stimuli\nthat get us ready\nthey start to release dopamine\nand induce cravings\nso if I go to a restaurant I'm going to\nget hungry\nif there's candles and incense and\nMarvin Gaye playing\nyou know and someone puts on their robe\nand wizard hat then I'm gonna get\naroused\nokay so one of the things that we need\nto do if we want to conquer Cravings we\nhave to get rid of the associated\nstimuli\nhas nothing to do with like conquering\nactually conquering craving is not right\nit has to do with decoupling the\nstimulus from the craving so what we can\ndo this is why when people are trying to\nget sober you know they stay away from\nbars\nso\nkeep good company\nso if you have friends who get high\nevery weekend don't hang out with those\nfriends\nif you have a problem with drinking\ndon't go to a bar don't go to barbecue\nthink a little bit about what are the\nthings that induce my cravings\nthere are a couple of other things that\nyou can do though so this is where a\nplan of avoidance\nis what you need\nand then some of you all may say but I\ncan't avoid that stuff forever\nof course not but you don't need to\navoid it forever you just need to avoid\nit long enough so that you can take care\nof all of this other stuff and when\neverything else is fixed you can go back\ninto the environment and you will have\nno trouble whatsoever I used to be\naddicted to video games I love playing\nthem now but it ain't no problem\nyou can strengthen everything else it's\nan issue of what you want to tackle\nfirst so you need to think about what\nare your triggers and avoid the triggers\nthat lead to craving\nsomething all may say but that's hard no\nproblem we'll give you another option\nthe other thing that you can do for\nconditioning is so that very practically\nthat's like if you have a problem with\ngames avoid twitch streams you know\navoid subreddits\nall this kind of stuff\nokay\njust for a while uninstall\nthe other thing that we can do\nis decouple\nthe stimulus and the association\nthis is my favorite\nso one way to decouple\nis to\nactually just\nget close but don't engage in it so this\nis where if we look at exposure and\nresponse prevention\nthis is a very important principle from\nPsychiatric treatment where what we'll\ndo is like if someone has a phobia\nthey have an association\nlet's say someone's claustrophobic so\nthe thought of going into an elevator is\nassociated with a physiologic response\nyou're not even in the elevator\nbut even thinking about the elevator\ncauses some kind of response and so what\nwe want to do is decouple that through\ncontinued exposure\nokay so every time we think about an\nelevator and nothing bad happens\nwe actually our response decreases so if\nwe spend a lot of time thinking about\ngoing into elevators eventually thinking\nabout going into an elevator is not\nscary anymore doesn't trigger the\nphysiologic response then the next step\nthat we're going to do is we're going to\ngo and look at the elevator we're not\nthinking about it now we're actually\nseeing the doors open and close\nand then now this will trigger response\nwe're going to keep doing that until\nthat's no longer scary then what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to step into\nthe elevator and we're going to step out\nof the elevator\nwithout writing it we're just going to\nstep in and step out that triggers a\nresponse we keep doing that until we\nbecome\ngood with that and then what we're going\nto do is we're going to step into the\nelevator and we're going to close the\ndoors but we're not going to go for a\nride we're going to let the door start\nclosing then we're going to hit the open\ndoor button\nso this is the principle of exposure and\nresponse prevention\nso this has to be done at some point\nwith addictions and this is where I'll\nuse an example I wouldn't recommend this\nfor things like heroin right like you\ndon't want to like walk up to\nyou know like look at a bunch of needles\nand stuff but eventually you need to\nbut in something like video games I'll\ngive you all a simple example so if\nyou're addicted to a video game sit in\nthe lobby for 15 minutes\nand then quit\njust load up the lobby hang out for a\nlittle while and then quit\ndo it intentionally\nset a timer on your phone\nsit down load up the game\ndon't queue and then quit\nokay\nso those are the two ways that we deal\nwith the conditioning aspect\nbecause there's all kinds of\nassociations that are pushing us in a\nparticular direction\nnext thing we're going to talk about\nis the Kappa circuitry\nso remember\nthat addictions activate our make our\nstress circuitry hypersensitive\nso what what that means is that if you\nare stressed out\nyou are way more likely to use and this\nisn't just an emotional coping mechanism\nkind of thing that is there too what\nthis means is that literally our stress\ncircuitry is like hyperactive\nso this is why if we look at people who\nget\nsober they will go to places like rehab\nwhat is the value of rehab it's like a\nlow stress environment\nright you've got all these super\nexpensive rehabs like out on the beaches\nin Miami and stuff like that and you're\nlike super chill and you get massages\nand you do yoga and all that kind of\nstuff\nand why is that it's because it's a low\nstress environment it's really hard to\novercome addiction if you're in a\nstressful environment\nvery practically what this also means is\nthat you can do meditations\nthat\nreduce\nyour stress response\nand activate\nyour parasympathetic nervous system\nso these are uh practices like triphasic\nbreathing pranayam\nvilom\nextended exhalations will lower your\nstress levels and as they lower your\nstress levels they will make you able to\nresist addiction that has nothing to do\nwith dopamine or or emotions or anything\nlike that it is simply controlling that\nvariable of stress you can also try to\nreduce the stress in the other\ndimensions of your life if you're trying\nto get rid of an addiction\nand this is where I know it sounds kind\nof weird but like\nas an addiction psychiatrist sometimes\npeople come in\nand they'll be like okay I want to like\nget sober from alcohol and I'm like not\nyet\nand then they get really confused\nbecause they're like\nbut isn't alcohol bad it's like yeah but\nyou're not going to succeed until you\nput a couple of things in order in your\nlife\nyou have to have a low stress\nenvironment no don't have to but it\nmakes it way easier\nand this is where if y'all are thinking\noh my God it's so hard to do this stuff\nthe whole point of this stuff is as you\nguys do these individual things getting\nsober will become easier\nand at the end it's almost effortless\nonce you control for all of these\nvariables which you can do a little bit\nat a time that's how people get sober\nthey fix one little thing at a time\ninstead of this big problem of\novercoming my addiction with willpower\nthat's a recipe for failure\nokay\nnow let's keep going\nall right next\nokay\nlet's talk about PFC\nimpulsivity\nso one other thing that I would\nrecommend that y'all do\nis\npractice restraining your impulses\nand there's one really good example of\nthis\nthat I think is just a really simple\nthing that you can do\nwhich is pray before eating\nso generally speaking we know that the\nbrains of people who are addicted to\nstuff are more impulsive and so what we\nwant to do is create tiny tiny\nsituations where when we're about to\nenjoy something we delay that\ngratification for a little bit\novercoming an addiction is not about\nconquering the addiction it is about\nwriting out the impulsive urge\nthat's what you have to do because the\ncraving won't last forever you just have\nto out you have to procrastinate\nbasically is what you need to do\nand so when I say pray before eating\nI don't care if you pray to a particular\nGod or you don't have to pray to God you\njust need to stop before you eat\nand intentionally close your eyes you\ncould give gratitude you can pray to God\nyou can you know do some kind of\ninvocation for Hope Just Close Your Eyes\nfor a second and express some amount of\ngratitude hey I'm about to eat this food\nI'm grateful that I'm here right now I\nknow my life is hard if you want to ask\nfor help you can ask for help like you\ncan ask for help from the Divine the\nuniverse whatever the key thing though\nis that I think one of the interesting\nthing that that's happened is if you\nlook at a lot of spiritual practices or\nreligious practices they help train our\nbrain in particular ways like fasting\npraying before eating they train us to\ndelay gratification\nanother thing that you can do is before\nyou play a game\nlike we said sit in the lobby so anytime\nyou queue up for something or you're\nplaying a video game wait five minutes\non the loading screen\njust wait five minutes\nand you're like that's boring that's the\n[ __ ] point\nlearn how to train your impulsivity and\nyou can do a five minute delay\nokay\nnow next part of the brain that we're\ngoing to talk about have we talked about\nthat yeah\nso there's another thing that there's\nanother technique that we have a whole\nvideo about called urge surfing and\nthat's to recognize that Cravings are by\ndefinition temporary and so all you need\nto do is write out the craving if you\ncan control the impulsivity eventually\nthe craving will go away okay\nso just write it out next thing that\nwe're going to talk about is remember\nthat there are\nprediction errors\nin addictions\nwhat does that mean that means that I\ndon't understand the consequences of my\nactions I don't think about the\nconsequences of my actions so there's a\ntechnique here called play the tape\nthrough\narchaic now ancient knowledge because we\ndon't have tapes\nthrough to the end\nso anytime you're thinking about using\nplay the tape through if I use today\nwhat's going to happen tonight\nwhat's going to happen tomorrow\nhow will I feel tomorrow\nwhat will work be like\nwhat will studying be like\nwhat will my relationships be like\nwill I cook for myself\nwill I eat out\nwhat'll happen\nwhat's going to happen day after\ntomorrow\nthink through all of the consequences of\nyou deciding to use tonight will you\nexercise\nif you use\nwhat will happen to your diet\nwill you work on your screenplay\nplay the tape through to the end what\nwill this weekend look like\nplay the tape through just think it\nthrough all the way to the end and you\ndon't have to do this perfectly so\nthere's going to be some resistance with\npeople like but how do I know what to\nthink about and I don't think it helps\nwhat you are doing it's not about doing\nit successfully you all have to\nunderstand the point of doing this is\nthat there's a part of your brain that\ncannot predict the future well enough\nso it's going to fail you don't have to\ndo it right you just need to keep\npracticing it and as you play the tape\nthrough over and over and over and again\nyour brain will literally learn how to\npredict\nas it learns how to predict it will\nactually restrain you from using it'll\nbecome automatic\nyou don't need to do it right you just\nneed to do it and the Brain will take\nover the fundamental problem in\naddiction is that the brain is working\nagainst you instead of you it working\nfor you\nand so what we need to do is just like\njust use it it's not about doing it\nright or wrong it's just about like\ngetting the rust off\nright\nI don't need to actually I mean there's\nbenefits to exercising right or wrong\nbut any kind of exercise will move me in\nthe right direction I just have to go\nfor a walk every day that'll move me in\nthe right direction so don't let the\nperfect be don't let perfect be the\nenemy of good\nokay\nnow\nthe last thing so we um\nwe kind of talked about emotional\nawareness we talked a little bit about\nreactivity\nso a general goal of this is to reduce\nreactivity\nokay so remember that the core of the\nproblem\nis to\nis that my relationship with myself is\nnot good my ability to tolerate my\nimpulses my emotions all that stuff is\nnot good I seek other things to fix\nthose problems\nso now\nwhat I'm going to end with is sort of\nlike\na psychological narrative spiritual sort\nof perspective so these are all the\ncircuits but there's a deeper layer to\nthis\nso when I have these circuits that work\nthis way I end up living a life that is\nless than ideal as I live a life that is\nless than ideal I become ashamed of\nmyself as I become ashamed of myself I\nstart to form an identity\nof a particular person I'm a bad person\nand I feel shame so what I want you all\nto really understand\nis that as I form this identity\nI don't want to be that\nI don't want to feel this shame so what\ndo I do I move away from here\nand I go out into the world and try to\ntry to fix things out here I'm\nconstantly trying to get away from\nmyself I'm constantly trying to get away\nfrom myself\nand the more that I try to fix my life\nout there\nthe worse it becomes\nbecause then what ends up happening I\nstart engaging in relationships\nwhere if I can get this person to love\nme I will feel good about myself I use\nanother person's esteem of me as a\nsubstitute for my self-love\nI throw myself into work in a really\ntoxic way\nbecause if I can be the best at work I\ncan feel good about myself\nand then what happens is if my\nself-worth is tied up into work or tied\nup into relationship my life becomes a\nping pong ball\nand a good day at work makes me feel\ngood about myself a bad day at work\nmakes me feel bad about myself I lose\ncontrol of my life\nbecause I don't get to decide how I feel\nabout myself\nthey get to decide how I feel about\nmyself\nand as they get to decide how I feel\nabout myself I can't control them but\nyou know what I can control whether I\nget high today\nthis is the core of the problem\nit's all an externally focused\nproblem-solving strategy\nsomeone's saying I'm addicted to\naddiction absolutely this is why we have\nan addictive personality how do you fix\nthis\nyou have to be okay with what's in here\nso from a Psychotherapy perspective that\nmeans working on your shame\nyou got to go and talk about your shame\nright\nand then what happens is as you work\nwith a psychotherapist what they're\ngoing to do is they're going to help you\nunderstand\nthat hey this ain't your fault\nor even if it is your fault this is\nreally wild\njust because it is your fault does not\nmean you are a bad person\nmaking a mistake does not make you a bad\nperson\nif you understand that\nyou've got one of the biggest steps\nfigured out if you don't understand that\nor that feels foreign to you that's what\nyou need to work on\na mistake is an action it's not a person\nthe problem is that so many of us grow\nup in situations where our actions\nbecome our value\nwe don't get to be decent human beings\nand get bees on tests\nwhether I'm a good human being or a bad\nhuman being did I get an A or did I get\na B\nso you have to tackle that shame whether\nyou want a journal whether you want to\ngo to therapy whether you want to\nmeditate whatever you want to do the\nshame must go away\nand once the shame goes away then we can\nstart to develop an identity of\nourselves that we are comfortable in\ndoes that make sense like that's if\nyou're ashamed of yourself you can't be\nhappy with yourself\nthe shame is what's getting in the way\nof your identity\nand this is where at the end of the day\nthe real value of spirituality\nis that the true self\nis behind all of that shame\nso I don't know if this kind of makes\nsense may not make sense but I'm going\nto say it anyway because maybe one\npercent of y'all that understand this\nand for those of you all that I'm gonna\nsay it\nwhat I am\nis\nme\nit's neither good nor bad arguably it's\ndivine sometimes it's amazing there's\nsome kind of inner peace the problem\nwith people with addictions is they have\nno access to that inner human being who\nis peaceful\nbetween me and the inner peace that we\ntalk about with meditation or\nEnlightenment or whatever is this Wall\nof Shame and negative identity so\nanytime I move internally all I\nexperience is shame and negativity and\nso then I have to run away from it and I\nhave to externalize my attention I have\nto either have sex or binge eat or play\nvideo games or use drugs to get away\nfrom my internal self I'm running away\nfrom myself\nbut the problem is that the real\nstability of self-worth is actually on\nthe other side of that wall of Fire\nit's on the other side of the shame\nit's on the other side of the low\nself-esteem and for you to realize that\nactually you're just you\nyou're perfect there's nothing wrong\nwith you\ncan you acquire addition additional\nskills absolutely can you become a\nbetter human being can you become a\nbetter student can you become a better\nfather can you become a better partner\ncan you become a better friend\nabsolutely but there's not anything\nfundamentally wrong with you\nand so the real\ncure for addiction is to connect with\nthat part of you\nand so this is why we see that spiritual\nhealing for addictions is so powerful\nthat once you realize that hey what is\non the inside is not something to be not\nsomething I need to run away from\nthe addiction will collapse like a house\nof cards and I have seen it happen over\nand over and over again\nonce you realize that there's decentness\nin here you don't need to run away from\nhere you don't need to run away from\nyour emotions you're not a pathetic\nhuman being and then you don't need to\ncope with anything\ndo you all get that addiction is coping\nthere's dysphoria that we don't know how\nto deal with and if we take away the\ndysphoria which is exactly what the\naddiction tries to do but only\ntemporarily\nonce we no longer need to run away from\nourselves we don't need any kind of\naddictive substance\nthere's nothing to run away from\nso if you really want to conquer\naddiction\nit's all of the above\nthe end goal is to love yourself\nbe okay with what's happening in here as\nemotions arise you deal with those\nemotions in here this is where the\nemotion takes place\nas you start internalizing your\nawareness\nyou will start to conquer the addiction\nbut before we get to that point we\nsometimes need to do things like\nPsychotherapy or get some kind of help\nthrough journaling or whatever\nand in addition to that there's all\nkinds of other stuff that we can do we\ncan practice body scans to increase our\nemotional awareness we can play the tape\nthrough to the the end to help our\nbrains make stop making bad decisions\nwe can control our impulses either\nthrough focusing meditations\nlike taratica is really good for that\nthey're all of these deficits in the\naddicted brain and we think about that\nas a bad thing in a sense it obviously\nis\nbut the good news is that for every\ndeficit it is something that you can fix\nit is something that you can work on and\nas you fix one thing the next thing will\nbecome easier the next thing will become\neasier the next thing will become easier\nas you reduce your the sensitivity of\nyour Kappa receptors you will literally\nneed fewer fewer drugs\nliterally\nand so there's absolutely like I don't\ncare how bad your life has been\nI would say that I have seen one or two\npatients out of probably five thousand\nthat I think are unable to conquer\naddiction\nliterally unable\nbut the success rate is like\n4998 out of five thousand and I'm not\nsaying that those 4 998 people conquered\naddiction what I'm saying is that there\nare only two people that I can think of\nthat I do not think that this will work\nfor them if applied in the right way\nforeign\nquestions\none hour and 35 minutes chat\ntake some time sometimes\nwill you take a break to heal your\nthroat yeah\nbut this is more important\nI probably got 10 minutes of voice left\nin me so make it good chat\num why wouldn't it be possible for them\nso I think sometimes the the neuro\ncircuitry is just so hardwired\nand sometimes there's like just such a\nsevere lack of self-awareness that the\nperson really needs\nlike an externally controlled\nenvironment\nto\nmanage their addiction\nhere we are talking about how to help\n4998 people and everyone's like well I\nwanted to help everybody\nI gotta be honest I I just think that\nyou know there's limitations to this\nmethodology\nokay what's your take on experimenting\nwith micro dosing with psychedelics so\nlet's talk about psychedelics for a\nsecond\nso I've had some patients who have had\npositive outcomes from using\npsychedelics even to overcome addiction\num that being said I think that\npsychedelics you have to be really\ncareful about because even the clinical\ntrials that suggest psychedelics are\ngood\nare clinical trials that are done in a\nvery controlled way\nin my controlled way I don't necessarily\nmean just Medical\nwhat I mean is that the therapeutic\nvalue of psychedelics\nseems to be very tightly linked to the\nenvironment and processing that's done\nafterward\nso when you do like 16 sessions of\nPsychotherapy with like two or three\ndoses of psychotherapy uh psychedelics\nto\nprocess appropriately that's what leads\nto good outcomes Even in our old\nspiritual Traditions like you look at\nlike Shamanism or something like that\nthey're not just done by someone sitting\nat home who's feeling bad about\nthemselves they're done under the\nguidance of someone who is adept at\ntheir use and has a whole structure of\nsafety around it\nso\nwe have to understand that it is not the\nPsychedelic\nthat is responsible for the healing it\nis the whole package that is responsible\nfor the healing\nso that's why I would strongly advise\nagainst them because we just don't\nreally know and I've seen lots of\nexamples of like psychedelics being used\nby people who are depressed and it just\ngives them PTSD\nlike so it's playing with fire right so\ncan fire do a lot of good yeah\nabsolutely but it can also do a lot of\nbad\nmicro dosing I'm even more against\nso this is where if we look at the the\nscientific data there's there's\nscientific data that supports the\npossible therapeutic value of\nactually hide higher dose of\npsychedelics\nso there's you know researchers at\nHopkins talk about the heroic dose\nso you need to use a limited it seems\nlike clinically what is probably going\nto be good is limited use but a\nsufficient dose micro dosing I think\nthere's actually a meta-analysis that\ncame out recently that shows that it's\nlike probably pretty harmful so I know\nit's like all the rage but that feels to\nbe really much more like an addiction as\nopposed to like some kind of growth\nrelated thing\nhow do you suggest procrastinating on a\ndrug or waiting out a craving so check\nout our video on urge surfing I don't\nknow exactly what it's called it may be\ncalled something else\num\nbut I think that's where like you know\nyou don't have to resist all of the\nurges all the time that's where we want\nto control things like environments so\nthat the Cravings are manageable\nso if I'm in early stage recovery and I\ngo to a bar where everyone's drinking\nand alcohol is my drug of choice it's\ngoing to be really hard to resist the\nurge\nit's easier to perhaps resist the urge\nto go to the liquor store and buy\nsomething because there's a long Gap\nbetween urge and action so you first\nthing you want to do is try to set your\nenvironment up so that you cannot\nquickly capitalize on an urge\nso simple example when I'm working with\npeople who are addicted to gaming is\nI'll tell them to log out\nof all of their Auto login things\nincrease the barrier that you have to\novercome because that'll give you time\nto write out the urge\nand then you could use things like\nbreathing exercises or going for a walk\nor even just getting up and like pacing\nin your own house\nyou can also do things like Splash cold\nwater on your face\nthough all those things will help with\nurges\nand then you can also do things like\ntrain a habit so you may say okay but if\nI have an urge to play it's hard to get\nmyself up to splash water on my face so\nthen what I would say is build a habit\nof before you play any video game you're\ngonna get up and wash your face\nand you're going to log out of all of\nyour devices and then if you do those\nsequence of things your gaming will\nactually go down\nwhat types of psychotherapy do I\nrecommend what a great question\nso the short answer is it depends\nso Psychotherapy the recommendation of\npsychotherapy is based on you as well as\nwhat your goals are\nso for addictions I think motivational\ninterviewing is excellent\nbut I also think that depending on what\nkind of addiction you have\nyou may really want trauma-informed\ntherapy\num I'm a big fan of like mindfulness\nstuff I think we've sort of figured out\nthat mindfulness adds a layer to therapy\nthat\nis just additional it's just like\nadditional gravy\nso it it doesn't it's just a net\npositive so I think we were sort of\ndiscovering that any therapy\ntherapy gets you so much value and then\nif you add some kind of meditation on\ntop there's just an additional value to\nbe gained\ncan you be addicted when you quit weed\nfor months\nmaybe probably not\nbut this is where you have to think a\nlittle bit about your relationship to\nwheat\nso one of the trickiest things that\npeople will do\nis they will their addictive brain\nwill give them a hurdle to jump over\nbefore they get free use so if your\nbrain is like oh like if you're really\naddicted what your brain may actually do\nis say\nhey if we can quit for a week that means\nwe're not addicted so then we're fine\nthen we can use as much as we want\nso it's really interesting to think a\nlittle bit about how the addictive brain\nworks and how it'll sort of like it'll\nset targets for you\nthat will allow you to be convinced that\nyou're not addicted and once you're sure\nyou're not addicted the addiction can\nrun wild\nwhat are your thoughts on food and sugar\naddiction\neverything that I've said applies\nso what we sort of know is that there's\nsome common mechanisms to all addictions\nand that's like a lot of the stuff that\nI was talking about about managing your\ninternal stuff with external things\nand then we also know that there are\nsome unique things to different\naddictions\nand there's a reason why some people get\naddicted to food it's because the way\nthat they're wired makes them vulnerable\nto that particular thing and there are\nparticular nuances to food and sugar\naddiction for sure\nbut everything applies\nwhy do I have an addictive personality\neven though I grew up in a healthy\nhousehold\nwhat a good question so I can't say for\nyou specifically but let me think about\nthis\nso a lot of times we have addictive\npersonalities because we grow up\nin situations where\nwe are taught\nto manage our internal emotional state\nthrough some sort of external thing\nbut sometimes we have let me let me I\ndon't know if that makes any sense give\nme a second let me think about that\nagain\nokay\nif we grow up in a traumatic household\nsometimes we'll develop an addictive\npersonality and what is an addictive\npersonality an addictive personality\nmeans that\nI use something outside of me\nto fix something inside of me\nthat's the core of an addictive\npersonality that's why it's an addictive\npersonality you don't get addicted to\njust one thing\nyou get addicted to all kinds of stuff\nand why is that it's because\nfundamentally the way to fix what's in\nhere is by using something out there it\ndoesn't really matter what that thing\nout there is\nso if I feel bad about myself if I'm\nunhappy one way to fix that is to get\nother people to love me so I get\naddicted to relationships and sex\nanother way to fix feeling bad about\nmyself is to use drugs right because I\ncan make those negative feelings go away\nanother way to fix the insecurity within\nme I don't love myself I'm not worthy of\nlove is to accomplish a lot of things in\nthe external world to be number one to\nbe CEO to be a millionaire to be an\nalpha\nbecause I don't feel good about myself\nso I have to prove it I need proof\nand the only time you need proof is when\nyou don't have belief\nright\nso if I don't believe I'm a good person\nI need proof\nand so you can even have an addictive\npersonality if you grew up in a healthy\nhousehold\nbecause the core part of it is how do\nyou feel about yourself\nwhat do you get from pursuing that thing\ndiving into this diving into that\nlearning this thing\nand oftentimes what you'll discover is\nthat you're using that thing to fix\nsomething in here\nand I've seen addictive Personalities in\npeople who grow up in happy households\nbut even in those happy households there\nare subtle things going on\nremember that 64 percent\nof the population\nhas adverse childhood experiences or\ntraumatic experiences growing up\n64 percent\nbut when 64 percent of people look at\nwhen we look at people growing up it's\nnot like 64 of their people think that\ntheir childhoods are traumatic in some\nway the number seems way lower\nand so you can cause that psychological\ndamage\nwith\nunexpected things\nforeign\nyep\n64 is high\ntrauma addiction absolutely go hand in\nhand\naddiction and ADHD go hand in hand\nthere's uh we have a a YouTube video\nabout ADHD and addiction because if you\nlook at a lot of these neuro\nNeuroscience stuff right so impulsivity\nfrontal lobe executive dysfunction all\nthat stuff makes you vulnerable to\naddiction\ncan a family appear healthy when it\nisn't absolutely\nso this is the other thing to understand\nis that even healthy families can be\nunhealthy right no family is perfect no\nparent is perfect\nso the unfortunate reality is that you\ncan try to be the best parent that you\ncan and you're still going to screw up\nyour kids in some way\ninto the process of being human is in\nrecognizing like I had a great childhood\nin a lot of ways I also had a video game\naddiction and all kinds of problems\njust because no one's perfect and that's\npart of humanity and so what you have to\ndo as a human is like recognize okay\nwhat what did your parents not do\nperfectly which you can't blame them\nbecause it's not like they go to\nParenting school and for like 50 years\nbefore they have kids right most of it\nis Instinct in what we're taught and\nthen you have to do some work yourself\nwhat books do you recommend that are\ninsightful helpful in recovering\nprobably\num the body keeps the score it's a book\nabout trauma\nbut\nyou know I read Gabor mate's\nin the realm of hungry ghosts and it's\nlike okay\nlike I think it's a really great book in\nsome ways but\nmaybe just not my cup of tea\nI I guess here's here's the big problem\nthat I have is people will ask what\nbooks do you recommend\nso what's the purpose\nof reading a book\nthe purpose of reading a book is to gain\nsome sort of information or\nunderstanding and when I think it comes\nwhen it comes to addiction\nthis is actually half the problem is\nthat\nthe information or understanding that\nyou need isn't going to come from a book\nyou're looking in the wrong direction\nlook within yourself\nlike I know it sounds kind of cliche but\nreally I think that's like a huge part\nof it\nis that people with addictions look to\nthe outside to fix what's in here\nand even looking to the outside to\neducate yourself about what's in here is\ngoing to be worth a fraction\nof what you can learn by paying\nattention to this\nif you want to know what book to read\nwrite read the book that you write about\nyour own internal experience\nwrite a book about why do I do these\nthings how do I feel about myself\nwhat is it that increases my cravings\nWhat is it that decreases my Cravings\nwhy is it that I'm able to resist a\ncraving on one day and not resist the\ncraving on a different day\nhow to quit porn\nso\ngood question\nso how to quit porn if you've tried\neverything\nso remember that addiction is very hard\nto overcome in a vacuum or in your\ncurrent state of life\nso the number one variable that\ncorrelates with pornography addiction is\nmeaninglessness\nso if you really want to quit\npornography what you need to do is build\na life of meaning\nand what that sort of entails is some\namount of introspection like what do you\nwant from life because if you want to\nquit pornography you have to re have a\nreason to not\nwatch\nand the whole problem is that\nyou don't have a good enough reason to\nstop watching porn\nfor my health what is that\nfor my relationships to help me move\nforward why do you need to move forward\nwhat do you really care about\nso I'd say if you're struggling with\npornography go and do something\nsubstantial for other human beings\nnumber one\ngo like volunteer or whatever and do it\nconsistently for like six months\nthat'll help you develop some sense of\nmeaning\nbecause pornography addiction is all\nabout\nmy relationship with my internal\nfeelings I'm bored I don't feel good\nabout myself\npornography addiction is an emotional\ncoping mechanism\nso you have to feel good about yourself\nand you can't just overcome that by\nstopping watching pornography you have\nto go and do something on the outside\nand the second thing you've got to do is\nask yourself what you want from life\nand then once you understand what you\nwant from life if you're like I don't\nknow or I guess I want what other people\nhave\nthat's not good enough right it's not\ngoing to actually motivate your behavior\nand then the third question you've got\nto ask yourself is once you figure out\nwhat you want from life\nwhat are you willing to sacrifice in\norder to get it are you willing to\nsacrifice pornography in order to\nachieve that thing\nand the answer is probably going to be\nno which is why you need to go back to\nquestion number two and keep asking that\nquestion until you find something that\nit is worth giving up pornography for\nand until you find that thing you're\ngoing to be addicted to porn\nokay maybe time for one more question\nokay\num\nokay this is a good question\nokay so man so many good questions okay\nall right let's start with this one\nhow long does it take to reverse the\nchanges of addiction\nso I'd say that within two weeks\nyou see some reversals\nadditional reversals will start to\nhappen in about three or four months I\nthink there's another kind of like\nthere's kind of like plateaus of\nprogress so even within one week of\nsobriety you'll start to see some\nchanges in the brain\nthree to four months out you can still\nsee some long-term changes\n12 months to 18 months is when you\nreally start to see some solid changes\nin life not within you\nbut within life\nand then I would say three to four years\nout you're going to be completely\ndifferent\nbecause once you start seeing that\nmomentum it takes time for momentum to\nbuild\nso just to give you all an example I had\na patient who was addicted to heroin\nit took him about one week of sobriety\ntwo weeks of sobriety to like stop\nfeeling terrible every day but they\nstill felt kind of crap\nso they felt kind of neutral until about\nfour months in four months in is when\nthey started to feel good like feel\nnormal\nit then took him about 18 months to\ndecide to enter into a graduate program\nand become a therapist themselves\nand about three years out they finished\ntheir degree and like you know gotten a\nnice place that they were renting had\nlike a nice house or in a stable\nrelationship and we're like starting to\nearn back money and then like four years\nout they were like living a normal happy\nlife where they were helping other human\nbeings\nhad a mortgage were engaged that's how\nlong it takes\nthoughts on 12-step programs so I think\n12-step programs can be good for a fair\nchunk of people\nbut if a 12-step program doesn't work\nfor you there are all kinds of other\nalternatives to 12-step programs\naren't we just a placing replacing\naddictions with addictions\nnot really\nso some people wonder whether life is a\nseries of upgrading art addictions\nso I used to use drugs to cope now I use\nmeditation to cope am I still not just\ncoping in life\nso if you feel like life is a series of\nupgrading addictions here are the break\npoints that become really important\nso the first is if you move away from\ndrugs to a healthy coping mechanism are\nyou still coping yes\nbut the big difference is that once you\nuse a healthy coping mechanism\nthe coping mechanism does not create\nadditional damage\nso when I use drugs it causes me more\nproblems when I use a coping mechanism I\nmay not fix the underlying issue but I'm\nnot hurting myself in the future\nso that's the first break point\nbut you're still right that as long as\nyou're using a coping mechanism it's not\nfixing the underlying problem and that's\nwhere the real freedom from addiction\ncomes in\nso once we start no longer needing to\ncope that is when we're done with the\nball game we've won the game at that\npoint now how do you get to that\nwe conquer the need to cope when the\nstuff in here is no longer bad\nso if I feel ashamed of myself if I\ndon't love myself if I lack the ability\nof self-compassion I need to use drugs\nthat kind of\nself-hatred I can then replace the drugs\nwith meditation which is healthier\nand as I replace it with meditation I\nstop screwing myself up in life which\nthen really tills the soil\nfor self-love but eventually what I want\nto do is get through that shame and\nstart to realize that I'm actually a\ndecent human being\nand once I realize that I'm a decent\nhuman being I don't need to meditate\nevery day\nto avoid negative emotions or cope with\nmeditation negative emotions once I love\nmyself I can start to meditate every day\nto build something positive as opposed\nto get something get rid of something\nnegative\nand once I do that then I've won the\ngame\nforeign\nall right chat\ncan THC be a good thing sure\nit can\nso we know that for example I think like\nthe best examples of THC being a quote\nunquote good thing or in patients with\nchronic opioid addictions\nor people who are in chronic pain so we\nknow that THC can be used as a harm\nreduction strategy for people who are on\nvery high pain pain medication we also\nuse THC have used THC for decades in\nthings like cancer treatment because it\ndoes things like stimulate appetite when\nyou're in chemotherapy and you don't\nfeel like eating anything and so we I\nmean we've been using THC medically for\nmany years so it can it can be a good\nthing absolutely\nall right chat\nso thank you very much for coming today\num\nyou know for those of you all that\ncaught this a little bit later maybe go\nback and watch the beginning so today we\ndid a deep dive into addiction and sort\nof trying to explain like what y'all\nneed to understand about addiction it's\nnot about the details of a particular\nsubstance or diagnosis but how can you\nunderstand how and why an addiction\nforms and once we understand how and why\nin addiction forums we also\nlay the foundation for how we can fix it\nand so hopefully that's been helpful to\nyou all we're doing a lot of stuff like\nthis during mental health May so stay\ntuned to our various channels and things\nlike that we'll be bouncing all over the\nplace we're going to be doing travel\nwe're showing up on some podcasts we're\ndoing some interviews and we're trying\nto basically figure out what is the most\nhigh impact stuff that we can do\npart of the reason that we're doing deep\nDives on trauma in addiction and not\ndeep Dives on things like depression\nanxiety ADHD\nor meditation is because we actually\nhave deep Dives for those things already\nas Dr K's guide so if y'all like today's\nstream but you want even more right so\nwe've got about 20 to 30 35 36 videos on\ntopics like depression anxiety\nmeditation and ADHD so check out Dr K's\nguide we also have things like\nworksheets and exercises a lot more\ndetails on how to implement Solutions\nlike here is the actual meditation\ntechnique for this particular problem we\njust don't have time for that so just to\ngive you all an example\num you know each guide has a script\nthat's about a hundred thousand words\nand is like one full week\nof like videos in terms of filming and\nwe just can't do that all the time right\nso today we sort of gave you all 90\nminutes on addiction if you guys want\nmore on that we'll we're we may build a\nguide or something like that but if you\nguys want those other topics we've got\nway more as well as implementation\nstrategies so check those out\num and then lastly thank you to all of\nyou for the support that you all give us\num we're really grateful for all the\ndonations all the subs things like that\nwe also recognize that a lot of y'all\nare not able to afford Mental Health\nResources that's part of the reason why\nHG exists we do this stuff in live\nstreams for free you know we have all\nthese YouTube videos and stuff like that\nwe've got another product that's coming\nout in a couple weeks stay tuned to help\nyou all even more\num we have all these community events on\nDiscord and stuff like that to help you\nall learn EQ and learn about your\nemotions we recognize that not everyone\ncan afford stuff and we also it's really\ncool but HG is now in 132 countries\nand so we also you know recognize a lot\nof y'all don't have resources so we're\ngoing to do our level best to produce as\nmuch stuff as we can and make it as uh\navailable as as possible and so huge\nthank you to everyone who supports Us in\nterms of donations trying out our\nproducts and services so we take all of\nthe revenue to build additional stuff\nand even if\nthere's no Revenue that's actually okay\nso huge shout out to platforms like\nYouTube because we earn ad revenue and\nwe use that Revenue to build free\nresources for y'all\nand the last thing is that if y'all\ncan't\nsupport us financially totally fine it\nactually really helps us if you share\nour work with your friends so even\nsharing your work or sharing videos or\nwatching videos or being a part of the\ncommunity
