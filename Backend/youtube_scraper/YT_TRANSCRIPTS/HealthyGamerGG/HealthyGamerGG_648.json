    "transcript": "when someone says I'm willing to try\nanything we're not actually willing to\ntry anything that's crazy I only want to\ntry things that work but let's\nunderstand perfectionism and\nprocrastination okay the procrastination\nis a symptom of the root of\nperfectionism right so why is it hard\nfor them to get started they even laid\nthis out so if I want to be perfect I\ncan't get started until I know it'll be\nperfect and so we can't get started\nbecause we're setting an impossible\nstandard for ourselves because we need\nto be perfect I need a plan that will\nachieve Perfection and I'm going to\nfigure out the perfect Plan before I get\nstarted because what's the point in\nstarting without a perfect plan because\nthen I'll do all this work and it won't\nbe perfect and that won't be good enough\nso why even bother getting started in\nthe first place so the procrastination\ncomes out of the desire for perfection"
