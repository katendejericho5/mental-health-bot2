    "transcript": "everything that we know about how to\nstudy efficiently also works for playing\ngames so I'll ask y'all a couple\nquestions do you do better the first\ntime you fight a boss compared to the\nsecond through fifth time the first time\nevery single time yeah every single time\nright this is like a common pattern so\nthis means that there's something like\nwe do really well like you get the boss\ndown to 20 health and then you wipe and\nthe second time you go in and you get\nlike two-shotted right yeah that's what\nhappens the science of performance and\nall the stuff around learning I did this\nwithout Eldon ring I actually like\napplied this because I didn't have four\nhours of grind right so what I would do\nis I'd play a boss for like maybe like\n20 to 40 minutes and then I'd take a\nbreak and then what happens especially\nwhen you sleep is all of your learning\nthat happens in in short-term memory\nactually consolidates into long-term\nmemory and so even when I was playing\nradon and stuff I would not Redondo\nRadigan yeah right so what I would do is\nlike I'd play for like half an hour\nevery morning and then like in four or\nfive days I beat it it was easy so if\nyou play for five hours at a stretch\nYou're Gonna Lose okay all right so\nthat's like an actual good way of\nhandling it all right that is amazing"
