    "transcript": "the thing about Dark Souls Lore is like\nnot everyone is into it right but the\npeople who are into it like really crave\nit oh yeah it's really interesting\nbecause I watched like lore videos for\nDark Souls one two and three yeah and\nthen I understood enough about how they\nput the story together to where the cool\nthing about Elden ring is like I decided\nI'm not gonna watch any lore videos I'm\ngonna figure out for myself oh my God\nand so it's actually like sleuthing and\nthis is the problem is that if you look\ntoday like if you look at wow for\nexample like you go to wow Wiki and\neverything's on there there's no\nDiscovery in games not only is\neverything on there the future patch has\nbeen data mined from the public test\nyeah absolutely all of the cinematics\nThe Voice lines have been put on there\nand you already know who's gonna yeah so\nlike Discovery like back when I you know\nwhen I was growing up we were talking\nabout the NES there wasn't the internet\nso you had to games were full of\nDiscovery like every game you played you\nhave to figure things out"
