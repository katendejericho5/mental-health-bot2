    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about how to\nlearn from our mistakes\nand this may sound like a really simple\nthing but if you really stop and think\nabout it this is something that I\nstruggled with and a lot of people\nstruggle with because sometimes we do\nthings right that we know aren't correct\nbut we keep doing them as an example\nI'll wake up and the first thing that\nI'll do is get on my phone or start\nplaying a video game or start browsing\nReddit and I know in the back of my mind\nthat once I start doing this my day is\nruined we know that we should be\nexercising more and then we exercise one\nday right and when you exercise for one\nday you feel so much better and you're\nlike wow this is amazing I have so much\nmore energy\nbut then the next day rolls around and\nyou seem to forget that I want to take a\nmoment to thank our HD coaches I've\ntaught it a lot of different places and\nworked with a lot of different people\nand honestly our coaches are some of the\nbest people I've ever worked with he\ncoaches have helped over 10 000 people\nfind purpose Direction and improve their\nmental health after about 20 weeks of\ncoaching the average client experiences\na 58 Improvement in sense of purpose in\nlife a 45 Improvement in feelings of\nanxiety and even a 35 reduction in\nfeelings of Despair and this isn't just\nme saying this at this point we've done\nthis for three years run six research\nstudies and even presented our findings\nat the American Psychiatric association\nNational Conference over 100 000\nsessions later I can confidently say\nthis works so if you're interested in\nchecking out he coaching for yourself go\nto healthygamer.gg coaching to learn\nmore and this is a huge problem in\nsociety today because we know what we\nshould be doing and every once in a\nwhile we actually do it but when we do\nit despite the positive reinforcement we\ndon't seem to implement changes in our\nlife it's almost like there is a\nsubconscious block from what we know we\nshould be doing and despite all this\nevidence we don't seem to be able to\nlearn and if you want to understand this\nphenomenon it turns out that you need to\nunderstand the science of neurogenesis\nso this is something that we've got to\ntake a step back and understand\ngenerally speaking when we are born most\nof the neurogenesis which is the\ndevelopment of brain cells is already\ndone so we don't really grow a whole lot\nof new brain cells this is why patients\nwho have strokes kind of like that part\nof your brain doesn't really regenerate\nso sometimes Strokes will lead to\npermanent deficits it turns out that\nthere's one part of the brain in which\nwe see neurogenesis and that's in the\nhippocampus the hippocampus is the part\nof our brain that governs learning and\nmemory and so it would make sense that\nif we're going to create new neurons the\none part of our brain where we would do\nthat is where we learn new things and\nform new memories if I learn to play an\ninstrument at the age of 20 or you know\nI go on vacation at the age of 30 or if\nI have my first child I'm constantly\nforming new memories and learning new\nthings and so it also makes sense that\nif that neurogenesis in the hippocampus\nis inhibited in some way then we may not\nbe able to learn from our mistakes and\nthis is exactly what happens there's a\nreally cool experiment that scientists\ndid which was published in the journal\nNature around how rats learn and more\nimportantly what inhibits their learning\nso the experiment goes like this we drop\na rat in a pool of shallow water where\nthere's one platform where the rat can\nrest so it has to swim around swim\naround swim around until it finds the\nplatform so let's say the platform is in\nthe top right\nso over time what happens is the rats\nwill learn right so I drop them into the\nthe water they swim they discover where\nthe platform is the next time I drop\nthem in the water they swim around they\ndiscover where the platform is but over\ntime three or four times they figure out\noh okay there's a platform right here so\nthey swim straight to it\nthen the scientists do something tricky\nthey move the location of the platform\nand what they discovered is that there\nare two kinds of mice there are some\nmice that if we move it from the top\nright to let's say the bottom left there\nare some mice that when we drop in they\nkeep on making the same mistake they\nlook for the platform in the top right\nthey keep swimming their keep swimming\nthere they start to get distressed\nthey're worried they don't seem to be\nlearning from their mistakes and on the\nflip side there are other mice that sort\nof figure out okay the platform is no\nlonger here let me go look for it\nsomewhere else and they're able to find\nthe new location of the platform and\nthen the second time you drop them in\nthird time you drop them in they go\nstraight back to where the safe space is\nso there's two kinds of mice here and\none seems to be learning from their\nmistakes in one dozen and it turns out\nthat this also goes to neurogenesis what\nthey sort of discover is that some mice\nwill code a particular kind of behavior\nand then they are unable to wipe that\nbehavior clean and sort of re-encode a\nnew form of behavior on the other hand\nsome mice are able to wipe that old\nBehavior clean and replace it with more\noptimal Behavior sounding familiar this\nis the problem that a lot of us face\nright where we sort of learned a\nparticular thing like hey it's actually\nokay to play video games it doesn't cost\nme very much but then as I get older it\nstarts to cost me more and starts to\ncost me more and starts to cost me more\nand I may be consciously aware of it but\nit's like something deeper in my brain\nis not able to learn that lesson\nso what separates the mice that are able\nto learn from the mice that aren't and\nit turns out there's one thing it's not\nwillpower it's not motivation it's not\nsome kind of supplement that you can\norder online it's actually fasting so\nthis is really interesting why is it\nfasting let's think about it for a\nsecond okay\nwhat is the one evolutionary signal that\nour brain needs to signal to us that hey\nthis strategy is not working how does\nthe brain know that hey we need to\nrethink how we approach this and we need\nto learn a new way of handling this it\nturns out that the most powerful signal\nto rewire your brain is starvation\nbecause a million years ago when our\nbrains evolved here's the sort of idea\nright so like if I'm living my life and\neverything is going really well then\nwe're fine we don't need to change\nanything because if it ain't broke don't\nfix it how does our brain know that\nwe're starting to screw up when we can't\nfind food anymore because our brains\nhave evolved for survival right not to\nlive in this digital age where we're\nbombarded with all the stimuli and so\nwhat's going on in today's society we're\nactually inhibiting the starvation and\nfasting signals that induce neurogenesis\nso the number one thing that causes\nneurogenesis is actually fasting or\nstarvation because this is our brain's\nway of saying hey this crap is no longer\nworking because we're starving and since\nthis is no longer working we need to\nwipe the Slate clean and learn a new way\nof functioning but what's happening in\ntoday's society\nno matter how many mistakes you make\nchances are you're still getting high\ncalorically dense food so what's\nhappening in your brain even though on a\nconscious level you're recognizing man\nmy life is going nowhere or I keep on\nwinding up in the wrong relationships or\nI wake up every day and I play video\ngames if you're ordering calorically\ndense food from like ubereats or\ndoordash or whatever if I'm eating pizza\nat the end of the day or I'm eating all\nthis calorie dense food what does my\nbrain actually think about the situation\nit's like hey bro or girl we don't have\nto worry about anything because we're\nstill getting calorically dense very\nrich food we've won the game of life\nbecause we're still getting this really\nnutrient rich food and when we get\nnutrient-rich food what it literally\ndoes is inhibit neurogenesis in the\nhippocampus which prevents us from\nlearning from our mistakes and this sort\nof makes sense right because what our\nexperience of this is is that we\nconsciously know that's the cerebral\ncortices it's like the top level of our\nand we know there's a problem but\nsomehow what we understand up here is\nnot changing our wiring down below and\nthat's exactly what we see with\nneurogenesis so now how do you fast so\nthis is also where I think we're\nstarting to see a lot of kind of\ncorroboration from the kinds of fasts\nthat people do so the first thing is\nwhen we're talking about fasting one of\nthe sensitive signals there is actually\nglucose or sugar this is part of the\nreason why I think we're seeing a bunch\nof low carb or minimal carb or ketogenic\ndiets because if you kind of look at\nthese people right who are like on\nketogenic diets and stick with it they\nseem to be like crushing things not just\nin terms of their diet but in terms of\nthe rest of their life right these are\noftentimes motivated people who are\ndoing better at school they're doing\nbetter at work so if you're trying to\nfigure out how to fast a couple of\nthings to consider is low carbohydrate\nintake probably will help induce\nneurogenesis there are also other things\nyou can do like exercise and stuff like\nthat\nthat helps induce neurogenesis\nthe second thing to consider is that you\nknow you have to be a little bit careful\nabout how to fast so if you're thinking\nabout doing some drastic form of fasting\nlike a three-day water fast I would\ndefinitely talk to a doctor before you\ndo that but basically any kind of\ncaloric restriction so if we're talking\nabout 1800 calories a day we'll probably\nstart to induce these signals low\ncarbohydrates will probably try to\ninduce these signals and the third thing\nthat you all can try is actually\nsomething like intermittent fasting and\nthis catches on pretty easily because\nbasically you restrict your eating to\neight hours a day and in eight hours a\nday it's hard to actually eat 2 000\ncalories\nso if y'all are struggling to figure out\nwhy can't I learn from your mistakes and\nit may feel to you like something is\nbusted like even though you know on some\nlevel it's like there's another part of\nyou that refuses to learn from your\nmistakes and it turns out that if we\nlook at the science of neurogenesis that\nis exactly what is going on and so what\nyou actually probably need to do is\nstart inducing neurogenesis and if you\ncan do that what you'll literally find\nis that you're able to learn from your\nmistakes that what you understand up\nhere translates down into the rest of\nyour brain and the rest of your life\nthere's one last thing that I have to\nthrow in if y'all are looking for proof\nof this concept there are actually\nstudies done on cognitive flexibility\nwhich remember is correlated with\nneurogenesis and people who play video\ngames and what we discover is that\nGamers who have higher levels of\ncognitive flexibility are higher rank in\nfact there's only one cognitive variable\nthat correlates with rank in League of\nLegends and that is actually your\ncognitive flexibility so not only will\nyou be able to learn from your mistakes\nwhen you start learning from your\nmistakes you'll actually climb the ranks\nwithin gaming and probably within the\nrest of your life\nforeign\n[Music]"
