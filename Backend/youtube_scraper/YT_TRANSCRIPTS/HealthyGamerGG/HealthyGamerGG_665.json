    "transcript": "male suicide rates are increasing it's\ngone from about 18 out of a hundred\nthousand I think to about 22 out of a\nhundred thousand it's on the rise and\nwhat causes this I know it sounds kind\nof weird honestly I think a big part\nthat is underappreciated is homophobia\nmay say what the hell does homophobia\nhave to do with male suicide so when I\nwas growing up everyone was so\nhomophobic and so what are men not\nallowed to do touch each other is a\nnation and a society we became so\nhomophobic that dudes stopped touching\neach other and so then what are you left\nwith the only place that you get touched\nis by your mom or by a romantic interest\nand why is that screwing up romantic\nrelations it's screwing up romantic\nrelations because now let's assume\nheteronormative for a second the women\nin our life are responsible not only for\nour romance but are becoming responsible\nfor the touch starvation that we have in\nall of the other dimensions in their\nlife in our lives and so now this woman\nis responsible for fulfilling all of my\ntouch needs because I'm not allowed to\ntouch another man"
