    "transcript": "when's the last time you had a good\ncrack and the thing is like we don't\ntalk about having a good cry even the\nmen that I worked with especially they\ncan have a bad cry they can go into the\ncorner of their house when no one's\naround and be in isolation and cry\nthat's hard for a lot of dudes but the\ngood cry is something that's really hard\nto find the good cry is when you're\ncrying usually someone else is there and\nthen you feel good we know how to feel\nbad when we cry as a society but we've\nlost the ability for the good cry that's\nwhat happens in therapy right half of\ntherapy is the good cry it's like the\ncry and it's like you know and we'll I\nusually like talk about hugging my\npatients and stuff we figure out what\nthe right boundaries are and then we'll\nhave a hug so I hope you all are able to\ngood cry and give other people around\nyou the chance to go to cry just ask\nthem when was the last time you had a\ngood cry and people thought what's wrong\nwith you like come on man you know and\ngive people that chance it's okay to cry"
