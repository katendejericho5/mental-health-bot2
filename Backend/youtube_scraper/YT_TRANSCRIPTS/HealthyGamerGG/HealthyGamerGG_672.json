    "transcript": "teaching the parents how to let their\nkids fail is one of the most important\nthings that we offer and it's hard\nbelieve me it's hard because if he does\ngets to see oh my goodness he's not\ngoing to get to Harvard or Yale oh my\ngoodness his future is destroyed we will\nnot be able to find a good girl I want\nto have ivy league daughter-in-law\neducated but not too educated son must\nbe more educated right so you can't let\nyour kid fail because then that has\nconsequences so then you protect your\nkid from the consequences you don't let\nthem you don't let them damage their own\nlife and in doing so you infantilize\nthem and then you accept responsibility\nfor their situation even though you\ndon't have the power to control their\nsituation suddenly their grades are your\nfault but you can't do the setting boy I\nhave no doubt in my mind that there's a\nhandful of Indian parents out there that\nwould take the tests for their kids if\nthey could and then you have a man-child"
