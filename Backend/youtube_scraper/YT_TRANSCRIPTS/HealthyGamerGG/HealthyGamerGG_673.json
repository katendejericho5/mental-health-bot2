    "transcript": "sometimes the reason that we're\nrebellious when we're told not to do\nsomething is because we discovered early\non that the things that are forbidden\nfor us are actually really fantastic\nlike sometimes that's what it is so\nimagine that I grew up in a household\nwhere I wasn't like allowed to drink\nlet's say Coke right all the other kids\nget to have Coke and all the other kids\nget to play video games I don't get to\nplay video games I don't get to have\nCoke I don't get to have Sprite I don't\nget to have any soda Pepsi nothing and\nso like when I go to my friend's house\nand I have a soda and I get to play\nvideo games I'm like wow this is really\namazing I love this stuff so some of us\nthen learn what's the lesson that that\nchild learns the child learns that oh\nthe stuff that is restricted to me is\nlike actually fantastic and so once you\nlearn that if you've been raised in a\nvery restrictive household then you're\ngoing to have some programming or\nconditioning to run into the direction\nof what you've been warned away against"
