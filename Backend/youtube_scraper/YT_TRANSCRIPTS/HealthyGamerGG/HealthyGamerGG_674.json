    "transcript": "yeah so any chance that playing a lot of\nvideo games blinds us to our passions\nabsolutely so here's the key thing that\na video game does it does not cause you\nto internalize or introspect at all what\nvideo games do is they take your mind\nand they externalize it towards a\nparticular thing and they keep it\noccupied over here without any effort\nfor like a period of hours and so\nthere's no sense of like internal\nExploration with a video game all it is\nis like that straight dopaminergic stuff\nwithout like any of the other stuff\nthat's part of the reason that we're\ngetting disconnected from our passions\nbecause we don't know how to look within\nanymore I'm not saying they're bad I\nlike them too I play I played Lost Ark\nyesterday that's okay"
