how y'all doing\ntoday we doing good\nchat meme review\nabsolutely how yall doing today welcome\nto another healthy gamer G stream my\nname is all kenoa just a reminder that\nalthough I am a doctor nothing we\ndiscuss on stream today is intended to\nbe taken as medical advice everything is\nfor education or entertainment purposes\nonly so if youall have a concern or\nquestion please go see a license\ntherapist or mental health professional\nor just any kind of medical professional\ndid yall know that you can just talk so\nI I got this interesting question\nrecently they're like how do I find a\ntherapist you can just talk to any\nmedical professional and they should be\nable to refer\nyou the legend has arrived who where are\nthey I don't see\nthem how am I doing I'm a little bit\nsick today so we've decided to make a\ncall and audible on what we're going to\ndo so instead of doing our standard\nmental health meme because I don't know\nif I can talk for two hours today what\nwe're actually going to do is two things\nwe're going to do a guided meditation\nwith the throaty voice and we're also\ngoing to do Dr K's guide to sexy talk\nThe Art of Seduction by Dr K step one\nget viral\nfitis step two use these words to seduce\nyour prospective\npartner right you start by telling them\nhey maybe one day so you know what's\nactually funny is that when they teach\nyou how to\ncommunicate it actually does translate\nto skill in communication in other parts\nof your life right because you're very\naware of things like body\nlanguage and\ntone and things like that and you're\nvery aware of the link between the mind\nand the\nbody and you know honestly most of\narousal is not physical TBH like if you\nlook at the science of\narousal um it it's it's mostly\nmental right and and this is why things\nlike fetishes exist because there is\nsome sort of arguably benign\nstimulus that creates a physiologic\nreaction\num yeah right and it's it's why you know\nsome women that I've talk to for example\nwe say that forearms are\nhot right talking so you know we'll\nteach you we'll teach you everything I\nguess one day if we ever make a a doctor\ncase guide\nto communication maybe we'll have a\nportion on sexual\ncommunication all right but enough\njoking around we have memes to attend to\nbut how how are youall doing today\nchat yall doing good are we on YouTube\nnow we bounce back and forth I think it\nkind of depends so sometimes um you know\nwhat we've noticed is that there's a\ndifferent audience in each place so if\nwe've like talked about particular\nthings on Twitch we may come back to\nYouTube and and you know we we're just\nwe're here\nto teach people about their mental\nhealth and so it turns out there are\npeople on more than one platform so\ntherefore we are on more than one\nplatform it's about as simple as it\ngets dating coach yeah dude let's\ngo let's go so you know our coaches can\nhelp y'all with a lot of\nthings um we just help yall with stuff\nlike\nmotivation and finding purpose and\nlearning how to set boundaries and\nbuilding work life balance\nand you know I don't know that they\nspecifically help you with dating but\none thing that I think we do see a fair\namount is that when people are in\ncoaching for a while they wind up in\nrelationships but I don't know that we\nactually help specifically with dating\nwhat we're usually pretty good at though\nis helping people understand okay what\nare your insecurities and issues that\ntrans\ntranslate unfettered into your dating\nlife and if we can help you with that\nstuff then we can it sort of translates\nright so we have we have a saying in\nPsychiatry that we I think we translate\nover to coaching which is that all boats\nrise together and it turns out that if\nyou just make a human being like more\nemotionally aware and help them process\ntheir emotions and and sort of help them\nfigure out tasks and goals and if they\nstart becoming more successful um on\nwait a minute hold\non no I do not want to log out but one\nsecond are we streaming on\nTwitch chat we shouldn't be streaming\nare you all hear from twitch this\nfrightens me\nchat honestly you know one of the\ngreatest regrets that I have is\nthat okay great we're not okay\num one of the one of the interesting\nregrets of you know having a happy\nrelationship which I'm incredibly\ngrateful for not no real regrets but I\nhave this morbid curiosity about online\ndating like what is it like to date\nnowadays um you know because it seems\nrough\ny' oh no this is something that my kids\ngot me but you know maybe I should turn\nit around\nI don't know that I'm the number one dad\nTBH do you watch us on Twitch yes\nnope how do I make this go away close\npole okay\num it's horrible yeah so so you know\nthat that's what's so tricky is like I'd\nlove we'd love to help y'all more\nexplicitly with that but I I think the\nbiggest challenge that I run into\npersonally is that like I have no\nexperience with it right so who am I to\ntell y'all this is going to work if you\nwere trying to date\nonline yeah so we we're going to try to\nhelp yall with that we just don't you\nknow unfortunately like let me see which\nwhich text am I reading nowadays I'm\nreading the vishuda Maga which is a\ngreat text by the way but I don't know\nif the Vish Maga says anything about how\nto succeed in online\ndating\num okay\nI see that someone has a question hi hey\nI'm a so matd Malone is saying welcome\nMaddie um I'm a psychology student how\ndid you cope during your studies some of\nthe content is super confronting how did\nyou feel while studying oh what a great\nquestion so here's the thing about\nstudying Psychology and Neuroscience\nespecially is that it is always\nincredibly overwhelming so if you're\nstudying psychology or Neuroscience\nyou're just going to get overwhelmed\nit's the default fault and the problem\nis because Psychology and Neuroscience\nis so\nintertwined and so what's happening is\nit's it's kind of like you don't\nunderstand what the picture is because\nyou only see one piece of it you learn\none piece and you learn another piece\nand you learn another piece but the way\nthat our mind works is that it organizes\ninformation like on the whole right so\nonce we understand what the picture is\nwe can fill in the appropriate gaps but\nPsychology and Neuroscience is so\nbecause you can't understand the whole\npicture as a whole you have to\nunderstand one piece at a time so what\ndoes one part of the brain do it does\nthis but how does that interact with the\nother parts of the brain it interacts\nwith all of the other parts of the brain\nit does this with this part of the brain\nthis with this part of the brain this\nwith this word of the brain so it's it's\nlike tons of memorization but one day if\nyou stick with it it's going to\nclick and if it clicks then everything\nbecomes easy like you start to like it's\ncool like then you understand okay how\ndo all these parts fit together but it's\nit's really hard for pretty much\neveryone I think at the\nbeginning\nso Neuroscience is fascinating but it's\nso hard to\nunderstand and and it's it's because\nlike I'm just trying to think about like\nother so like for example you can learn\naddition without learning\nsubtraction right like you can learn\nlearn the\nequation the area of a square without\nlearning the area of a\ntriangle like you can learn discret\npieces but with Psychology and\nNeuroscience it's a reductionist\napproach to something that is actually\nlike irreducible right the mind is like\na global kind of\nthing thanks for the tip Wheezy we\nappreciate it shall we dive in\nchat you're ready to go let's do\nmemes\nokay so let us react to\nsomething all\nright\noh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry muted\nmuted muted I got it the reason teachers\nare leaving is not because of teacher\npay and I will tell you why I'm a band\ndirector which means I get paid more\nthan most teachers it's an incentive to\nshow up and stay late for sure but it's\nnot enough even if every teacher in the\nstate of Texas got a $10,000 raise per\nyear we would still be dealing with some\nof the same issues we're dealing with\nright now let me just tell you what I've\nbeen dealing with in the last 48 hours\nthere's a list yesterday I broke up an\nassault in my bhole not a fight an\nassault a kid punching another kid in\nthe head at least four or five times\nsome mystery kid decided to get creative\nover the last 12 hours when I wasn't\npaying attention and literally took\nevery single string off of every single\nFrench horn that we own making them\nunplayable I set up a drum set station\nfor my percussionist I was so excited\nbecause they have been begging me all\nyear to play drum set took 24 hours for\nsomebody to break the high hat people\nstealing and using instruments that AR\nAR theirs even if it's in a locker I had\nanother kid hit somebody else in the\nface when their trumpet was on their\nface because they were blowing it in\ntheir Direction I had another kid in the\nsame class flip me off and then try to\nlie about it and before you come at me\nin the comments saying I knew what I\nsigned up for yeah I do get it but I've\nbeen told from multiple people on my\ncampus that the band kids are the best\nacting well- behaved students on campus\nand I still have to deal with this\ngarbage every single day this is not a\nmoney problem it's not an admin problem\nit's not a a parent problem it is an\nemotional disregulation problem never in\nmy 13 years of teaching have I ever had\nsuch a problem with kids keeping their\nhands to themselves and keeping them\nfrom destroying property I understand\ntheir kids and part of our job is to\nkeep them regulated and to teach them\nhow to do it but I have repeated myself\nso many times this year I have posted\nthings on the wall I've given them\nlectures I've written them up I've\nfailed them the corrective measures that\nwe've used in the past do not work\nanymore these kids do not care if they\nfail they do not care if they're written\nup they do not care if they get oss the\nonly thing that most of them care about\nis how they're going to be entertained\nin the next 5 minutes of their life and\nI try not to be a millennial teacher\nthat blames technology because I am\nsteep in technology I love Tik Tok I use\ntechnology in my class all the time but\nit's as if some of these kids have\nliterally given up fun life it's like\nthey've given up on doing anything\nspecial and they're 12 they're 12 I was\nso excited to start this year because I\nwanted to make some kind of an impact\nand get back into the classroom but I\nfeel like I've been chasing my tail all\nyear I love my kids but I'm beaten and\nabused and tired the system doesn't work\nand we are failing them and the teachers\nwe're failing teachers\ntoo yeah so this is\nwild I had an inkling that things were\nthis bad but I didn't realize things\nwere like this\nbad and like for the record I kind of\nagree right so this is where let's\nunderstand this so when you've got a\nbunch of bad kids we want to blame\nthings we want to blame the school\nsystem we want to blame their\nparents but something has changed right\nso anytime\nsystemically all of the kids are getting\nworse I don't think you can blame\nparents I don't think you can blame\nteachers there's a systems change change\ngoing on and what this teacher kind of\ntalks about is like absolutely true and\nlet's run through it so the first thing\nthat we've got to understand is that as\nwe start using\ntechnology the rate of ADHD is going up\nand even if the rate of ADHD as a\ndiagnosis is going up the attention span\nacross the whole is getting worse so\neven though we're let's say we've\nincreased the rate of ADHD diagnosis by\nit's gone from let's say it's like 6 %\nto 11% so maybe we've doubled it but\nwhat you have to remember is that the\npeople who are subclinically ADHD so\nthey don't it's not so bad that they get\ndiagnosed but there's a whole\nsubclinical population which is getting\nworse too so let's understand what\ntechnology does it makes us more\nimpulsive it's not just emotional\ndisregulation it makes us more\nimpulsive okay so we're not able to\nrestrain our actions there's absolutely\nemotional disregulation and that's what\ntechnology does we've got tons of\nstudies that show that using social\nmedia makes us worsens our mood worsens\nour attention and so this is happening\nto kids earlier and earlier and earlier\nI have a seven-year-old kid who asked me\nwhen do I get my\nphone I got my first phone when I was\nlike 18 or\nsomething and the earlier that you\nexpose children to things that shape\ntheir brain the worse things get so we\nknow know for example there's evidence\nthat marijuana is a gateway drug and why\nis it a gateway drug is it because you\nbecome morally degenerate if you start\nsmoking pot and then you start using\ndrugs and you get off\ntrack probably not what actually happens\nis when you use marijuana in the\ndeveloping brain it Alters your dopamin\nnergic and reward circuitry to make you\nmore vulnerable to Addiction in the\nfuture so what's happening is these\ndevices are being used to regulate our\nemotions so we know that video game\nthere there are fmri studies which show\nthat blood flow to the brain in our\nnegative emotional circuitry decreases\nwhen we use technology so if I'm feeling\nlike I'm having a bad day I can play a\nvideo game and my emotions will be\ncalmer and then it'll cause me to\ntilt so there's impulsivity there's\nemotional\ndisregulation and there's also temporal\nmyopia she's saying that 12-year-olds\nhave given up on life what is temporal\nmyopia when you get dopam energic crap\nyou stop thinking about the future right\nbecause your brain is existing in\n15minute segments and y'all May\nrecognize this too if you sit down and\nclose your eyes for 5 minutes your brain\nis going to go wild I need to do\nsomething I can't there's no patience\nit's temporal myopia and so all the kid\nthinks about is like hey if I ruin a\nbunch of violins LOL\nright and then I'm going to start\nfilming it to become an influencer and\nprank people by ruining their day and\nall this kind of crap it's all about\nimmediate\ngratification and this we've seen in in\nkids with ADHD they literally cannot\nthink about the future they're myop\nmyopic when it comes to the dimension of\ntime and so we have a whole generation\nthat is temporarily\nmyopic and this is the result\nwhat's the answer it's actually honestly\npretty simple we need a new set of\ntraining for human beings how do you\nstop technology can you try to regulate\nit\nsure by the time you regulate it right\nand there are like hearings going on in\nthe US about whether we're going to ban\nTik Tok the damage from Tik Tok is\nalready done even if we ban Tik Tok hell\nwe do it too we have YouTube shorts\nInstagram reals everyone has already\nfigured out that oh hey shorter and\nshorter form content gets people\nengaged right damage is done so you can\ndo government regulation sure what are\nwe going to do teach an army of\npsychiatrists absolutely we should do\nthat but what are we going to do are we\ngoing to send every kid in school to a\npsychiatrist can't do that it's the\nparental parents need to do better\nparents have never had to deal with\ntechnology like this before do you all\nrealize like how how hard it is to be a\nparent today when it comes to technology\nall your kids everyone's kids kids are\ngetting cell phones at the age of seven\nso I have to start fighting this battle\ntoday as a\nparent and this is the thing about\nparenting that we don't understand how\ndo you learn how to\nparent you grow up with parents you\nlearn what your parents\ndid right that's how we learn parenting\nit's not like we take classes you don't\nhave to take a\nclass just need Pi in and out in and out\nright that's all you need and that works\nthere's no parenting courses for\nImpala or chimpanzees or human beings\nand it's worked for\nlike the history of existence of life\nforms on the planet and it's not working\nanymore because our parents didn't have\ndidn't have to deal with this so they\ncouldn't teach us how to deal with\nthis so we need to do is train each and\nevery human being it's the only way it\nworks that's how what we do in society\nright we teach each and every kid it\nneeds to be a part of school we need\nemotional literacy classes in\nschool we need emotional regulation\nclasses in school it needs to be a core\npart of everyone's education and the\ncool thing is like why do I believe this\nwill work because it has and you can say\nDr K what do you mean it has this\nteacher is struggling\nif you're listening to this right now\nchances are it's helped you that's how I\nknow it works because we started this\ncrazy experiment like four years ago hey\ncan we teach average people about their\nmental health and can they get better at\nlife turns out the answer is\nyes yes and what do I base that on I\nbase it on you if you're new to the\ncommunity you may be skeptical but if\nyou've been with us for a while you know\nwhat I'm talking\nabout each and every human being needs\nto understand how their mind works how\nto control your mind how to understand\nwhat influences your mind for you to be\nin control of Mind instead of mind being\nin control of you you want to know what\nthe core problem that this teacher is\ntalking about the children are not in\ncontrol of their minds their minds are\nin control of\nthem that's it and as a society why do\nwe see mindfulness with a meteoric rise\nit's because it's the one thing that is\na program that teaches you how to\ncontrol your\nmind you want to know how to fix your\nlife get control of this everything else\nis\neasy then you say it's\nhard or I don't think I can have you\never been\ntaught has anyone ever sat down and told\nyou hey here is how your mind\nworks no\nand then then why because we have this\nwe have this psychology student asked\nthis question hey I'm studying\npsychology it's overwhelming because the\nway that the West has studied the mind\nis as a population not from a a sample\nsize of one Freud listened to people\ntalk and inferred all these complicated\ntheories about the\nmind the best text on the mind in the\nEast comes from this guy named pangali\nhis text is 400 sentences 300 sentences\n318 lines that's that's it because he's\ntalking about the Mind from the\nsubjective hey here is how your mind\nworks from the inside not what is an\nedible complex CU what do you do with\nthat if you're a human being and you're\nlike oh [ __ ] maybe I have an edible\ncomplex you read a book about the edible\ncomplex what do you do with\nthat the yogis figured out hey if you\nhave a desire here's how to control it\nif your mind is wandering here's how to\ncontrol and we do our best to give that\nto y'all right that's why we have stuff\nlike Dr K's guide and we have these\ncommunity events like right in the field\nso if you want to learn how to control\nyour mind start with the guide join\nwhatever we happen to be doing at the\ntime right and that's the core of the\nproblem is now we have something in\nsociety that is so good at taking\ncontrol of our mind it's getting better\nand better and better and it's\nthis hijacking your brain\nbecause we don't know how to defend and\nwe've relied on other people to defend\nfor us because it worked before\nseven-year-olds started asking for\nthis can't regulate it away should there\nbe regulation sure do teachers need\nburnout training\nabsolutely but we got to teach everybody\nthis stuff it's the only way it's going\nto\nwork questions\nyeah Melissa chin chinich is saying I I\ndesperately wish Humanity less hopeless\nI get change comes from within but it is\nhard when it feels like everyone else\ncouldn't care less about being\nbetter it feels that\nway right it feels that way and why does\nit feel that way where do you get that\nkind of information\nfrom we get it because the people who\nare the most\nhopeless are the ones that we see the\nmost so this teacher for example is\ncompletely hopeless and that's why she\npopped\noff oh the text is pangali yoga sutas\nand even then like half the lines aren't\neven related to the mind I think it's\nsuper\nsimple hard to understand we can maybe\ntalk about it one\nday okay should we move on the reason\nteachers are leaving is not because of\nteacher pay and I will tell you why I'm\na band director which means I paid more\nthan most teachers it's an incentive to\nshow up and stay late for sure but it's\nnot enough even if every teacher in the\nstate of Texas got a $10,000\nra we would still be dealing with some\nof the same issues we're dealing with\nright now let me just tell you what I've\nbeen dealing with in the last 48 hours\nthere's a list yesterday I broke up an\nassault in my van not a fight an assault\npunching another kid in the head at\nleast four or five times some mystery\nkid decided to get creative over the\nlast 12 hours when I wasn't paying\nattention and literally took every\nsingle string off of every single French\nhorn that we own making them unplayable\nI set up a drum set station for my\npercussionist I was so excited because\nthey have been begging me all year to\nplay drum set took 24 hours for somebody\nto break the high hat people stealing\nand using instruments that aren't theirs\neven if it's in a locker I had another\nkid hit somebody else in the face when\ntheir trumpet was on their face because\nthe\nhell dude Tik Tok just did it for me\nBruh Bruh it just started can you\nbelieve that you want to talk about\ntechnology inserting itself I didn't\ntell it to Play It Again it just did it\non its own I was like Hey thank God I\ndon't have\nheadphones you you'll get that what I've\nhad to learn how to do to survive in\nthis technological day is to plug in\nheadphones and take them\noff y'all get that like think about that\nsomeone at Tik Tok was like if there is\nan idle window that is open for some\namount of time [ __ ] them start playing\nthe video do you get\nthat like someone made that decision to\nprogram it that\nway we don't care bro you left\nwhy come on back and you know why they\nwaited like five minutes because they\nrealized that if we start autop playing\nright away the person is going to get\npissed and they're going to close the\ntab so I can almost bet you\nmoney that they\ntested some people start Auto playing\nright away some people were going to\nwake 30 seconds some people were going\nto make 1 minute some people were going\nto make four wait four minutes and then\nthey figured out that like 5 minutes cuz\nI didn't close the tab I just paused\nit y'all get that like this is what\nwe're up against the only way to survive\nis to train\nthis all right I don't even remember\nwhat I was talking about let's move on\nlet's go chat\nright so that that's that's what they\nsomeone's saying you can mute the tab so\nnow there's like this War I guess maybe\nFirefox is looking out for\nme cuz like there's there's a war\nbetween like Hey we're going to Auto\nmute tabs for you we're on your side and\nthen who's Firefox competing against\nthey're competing against Chrome and\nSafari so everyone's in competition and\nthey're trying to win you over you're\nthe prettiest Bell of the\nball and once they win you over what do\nyou they they get\nyou right so if I'm using this platform\nthey get my ad Revenue they get my eyes\nthey get the advertisers CU I'm\npurchasing\nstuff you want to know what I want to do\nI'm going to run an experiment about\nwhether you can mine someone's\nsubconscious by analyzing their Tik Tok\nfeed I wonder if we took 10 people I've\nbeen thinking about this recently and we\njust looked at their Tik Tok feed could\nI make predictions about what their\ninsecurities are because the algorithm\nis really good at figuring it\nout is Tik Tok better at diagnosing\ndepression than the psychiatrist\nis we'll see\nthose are the kinds of experiments that\nI want to run but you know we'll see\nchat whe that's doable I don't know if\nthe NIH is going to fund\nthis so then the question kind of\nbecomes right so this is where we got to\nrethink mental health so here we are\nadministering things like phq9 and and\nall these like surveys well like maybe\nwe don't need\nto maybe we can just let Tik Tok do it\nfor\nus right they're they're good at it they\ndon't even realize what they've stumbled\non I mean they know what they've\nstumbled on they don't psychiatrists\ndon't understand what they've stumbled\non you don't need Sigman Freud to\nanalyze your dreams you just need to\nlook at a Tik Tok feed I'll tell you\nwhat your problems\nare right\nhow difficult is is it to get funding\ndepends on who you are and what what\nyou're\nstudying all\nright that's why we appreciate when\ny'all like donate and stuff like that\ngoes towards our research so we're doing\nlike six studies right now that are all\nself-funded basically because we study\nthese things because we think they're\nimportant and you\nknow other people don't they want to\nstudy what's a new medication that will\nimprove depression by 4% more than an\nSSRI all right let's see what's that\nwhat's next Millennials you guys were\nborn into a world that promised so much\nbut didn't deliver whereas we were born\ninto a world that was just\nF and we knew it was cuz of the internet\nso we got very low expectations we know\nthe world's going to end in our\nlifetimes and we just don't really\ncare like one girl in Sweden\ncared and that that made the news like\nwe sent her around the world like look\none of them wants to live have you seen\nit I feel like even the person who named\nthe generations knew you were done for\nright they're like yeah we're going to\ndo it alphabetically all the older\npeople they Gen X in the middle they're\ngen why all the kids they're gen Z I'm\nguessing someone at that meeting was\nlike hang on um what about the\ngeneration that comes after gen Z\nthey're like yeah good one\nCraig come on Craig time's running out\nfor them that's that's why we called the\napp Tik Tok\n[Applause]\nokay all\nright so I'm G to do something I'm gonna\nlet's see if this plays again y'all\ny'all help me out okay chat it auto\nplayed holy crap I caught it this time\nbut it auto\nplayed\nokay so this comedian is\nhilarious and also right\nso the problem with the millennial\ngeneration is that we were sold a\nformula for Success that did not work so\nwhen I was growing up they all said go\nto\ncollege get a degree go to graduate\nschool you'll be special and then with\nthis thing behind you don't worry about\nstudent debt by the way with all the\nstuff behind you you're going to be\nsuccessful but what had happened is\neveryone had sort of figured out at\nleast in the US that everyone's going to\ncollege and everyone's taking out loans\nand 18-year-olds don't understand the\nvalue of a dollar so we're just going to\nkeep on jacking up loans and education\nprices and loans and education prices\nand they even pass legislation in the\nUnited States that you cannot declare\nbankruptcy and get rid of your student\nloans corporate malfeasance you ran your\nbank into the ground you can declare\nbankruptcy commercial real estate you\ncan wipe that debt clean baby let's\ngo you can wipe all the debt clean you\nwant except for student\nloans that's the one thing we're going\nto saddle you with no matter\nwhat and so this generation My\nGeneration got\nscrewed I'm one of the lucky ones right\nbecause my parents had enough resources\nto get me through\nthings and then the next Generation yall\nwere like hey the gener above us is like\nso we mentally checked out and now\nthere's this existential\nnihilism we even have a word for it\nthere's a class of people who embrace it\ndoomers these people are so common that\nwe gave them a word they're the\ndoomers because here's what happened is\nthat like all the stuff that was\nsupposed to work doesn't work and so now\neach

let's do\nit okay\nokay let's move\non all\nright oky doie Pokey\npokei let's see what's\nnext and I really feel like we don't\nspeak about this enough is people don't\nrealize how often men are EXP\nexperiencing a lack of intimacy and the\nonly place that they can experience that\nintimacy is through\n[Music]\nsex we've created a society where men\nare so afraid to be vulnerable with each\nother to be you know sensitive with each\nother to care for each other to love\neach other is there anything I can do to\nhelp you I can use a hug I'll give you a\nhug\nseems like you got a lot going on man\nit's all right it's all right\nman I hope we get to the place where\nguys go oh I actually I actually didn't\nneed the sex I need it to be held and I\nlive in a society where it's hard to be\nheld unless I'm having sex because as\nguys you can't just go to a guy and be\nlike just hold\n[Music]\nme oh this is nice for you\nnever know how\nmuch there are many sex workers who\nwho've talked about this where they'll\ntalk about how many men will pay them\nand then say hey can we just\ntalk I\nam I want to kill\nmyself fill this\nup that is exactly how it\nworks by the\nway there's no fun for men's mental\nhealth and it's the biggest killer for\nmen between like 21 and 45 and no one\ntalks about it no one even mentions it\nlad men just kill themselves and no one\ncares we need to change it I would have\ngone with you to the\nend fires a\nm you know what you used to be no paric\nwhat did I used to be\nnice you used to be nice and did you\nnever used to be\n[Music]\noh\nGod maybe you never used to\nbe what do you want to be when you grow\nup kind\n[Music]\n[Music]\nall right\nchat so real talk for a\nsecond I know the music was good and I\nknow Trevor Noah was\ncompelling but this is true in a\nnutshell\nso male suicide has been a problem for\nlike 60 or 70 years it's on the climb\nwe don't really talk about it very\nmuch and if youall want to know like in\na nutshell we can tell y'all I can tell\ny'all honestly what I think about it and\nit's maybe a little bit surprising so\nthe first mistake that we make about\nmale suicide is that it's a mental\nillness\nproblem and this may surprise yall\nbecause you're thinking like hey if\npeople are killing themselves aren't\nthey mentally ill I recently saw a\nreally interesting study I don't know if\nit was a meta analysis or not up to 60%\nof\nmen have no evidence of mental illness\nwhen they kill themselves up to\n60% think about that for a\nsecond cuz we\nassume that if you kill yourself you are\nmentally ill there is something busted\nin your\nbrain and when we make make that\nassumption we actually Doom a lot of\npeople to the path of suicide because\nwhat this study suggests and this is\nwhat I've seen in my clinical practice I\nwould say up to 60% makes sense too I\nwould say about half of men that I've\nworked with who were suicidal are not\nmentalo what that means is that the\nworld that they live\nin puts them in unwinable circumstances\nwhere quitting the game is the only\noption they're not ill\nthey're hopeless there's a big\ndifference and the moment that we\nstarted calling hopelessness\nillness we stopped trying to help those\npeople where they need help because what\nwe said is that the problem is in\nyou right so when there's a man who's\nsuicidal what do we say by calling it\nmental illness hey bro the problem is\ninside you it's not your circumstances\nsure as hell ain't my fault or their\nfault the problem is in you and you need\nto fix it which is exactly what we do to\nmen you have a problem in life you need\nto fix it you struggle with something\nyou need to fix it and by labeling all\nsuicidality as mental illness we have\ndone the same damn thing again because\nnow who's responsible for fixing your\nmental illness you are to a certain\ndegree your\nprovider it's your fault it's not the\nworld that you get live in it's not the\nexpectations that you have to\nface and so this is the really\ninteresting thing anytime we have a\nsystemic observation about a class of\npeople we try to fix the\nsystem\nright and it's good that we do\nthat so I worked in a jail for three\nmonths it was 3 weeks before I saw a\nwhite person as a patient think about\nthat for a\nsecond and what we know as Society does\nthat mean that white people are less\nlikely to be criminals no not at all we\nneed to fix the\nsystem but there's one system that we\ndon't fix in favor of\nmen right and that's when it's against\nthe\nmen and we call it a mental illness\nproblem now I'm not saying that\nsuicidality is not related to mental\nillness I'm also not saying that you\nshould not seek mental health treatment\nif you are suicidal because even though\n50% of them I would not diagnose someone\nwith a disease doesn't mean that I\nwasn't able to help and because that's\nwhere the help\nis and so our society has changed and by\nthe way since n\n1990 mental illness I mean Su male\nsuicide rates are\nincreasing it's gone from about 18 out\nof 100,000 I think to about 22 out of\n100,000 so we've gone up by like\n25% 20% it's on the rise and what causes\nthis I know it sounds kind of weird\nhonestly I think a big part that is\nunderappreciated is\nhomophobia you may say what the hell\ndoes homophobia have to do with male\nsuicide so when I was growing up\neveryone was so\nhomophobic and so what are men not\nallowed to do touch each other I\nremember when I first went to India at\nthe age of 21 I had a friend who's\ngetting married\nand so he was like 28 or 29 I was 21 at\nthe time so he like his friends heard so\nthese two Indian dudes walk up to this\nguy and he puts his arm around both of\nthem and they put their arms behind his\nback and one of the dudes starts rubbing\nhis belly so it's like three dudes like\none dude like a dude on you know like\nwings of like dudes and they're like\nlaughing and they're like oh bro like\nyou're gon to get married and one dude\nis like touching another dude's belly\nI'm like what is this this is gay I grew\nup in East\nTexas and touching another dude is like\noff\nlimits and so as a as a nation and a\nsociety we became so homophobic that\ndudes stopped touching each\nother and so then what are you left with\nthe only place that you get touched is\nby your\nmom or by a romantic interest and why is\nthat screwing up romantic relations it's\nscrewing up romantic relations because\nnow let's assume heteronormative for a\nsecond the women in our life are\nresponsible not only for our romance but\nare becoming responsible for the touch\nstarvation that we have in all of the\nother dimensions in their life in our\nlives and so now this\nwoman is responsible for f fulfilling\nall of my touch needs because I'm not\nallowed to touch another\nman I've heard from school teachers who\nare like I'm not allowed to hug my\nkids I can't touch\nthem I've had\npatience mix race\ncouples hugging their kid at a\nplayground people will call the\npolice if you're mixed race if you're\nmixed race couple and you're a mom and\nyou have a kid that doesn't look like\nyou everyone assumes you're a nanny if\nyou're a dude everyone assumes you're a\npedophile\nit's\nwild CU here's the thing what people\ndon't understand is that mental illness\neven or not mental illness let's talk\nabout mental\nhealth mental\nhealth the foundation of mental health\nis connection our brains in order for\nour brains to be healthy they need other\nhuman beings so what does our gut need\nto be healthy it needs like a balanced\ndiet what does our skin need to be\nhealthy we we have to bathe occasionally\nmaybe put some coconut oil on whatever\nwe have certain things that our organs\nneed to be healthy right you need a\ncertain amount of water for your kidneys\nto be healthy what does the Mind need to\nbe healthy it needs other humans or\nconnection of some\nkind and now what we've done is we've\nreduced the scope of mental illness or\nmental we've reduced the scope of mental\nhealth to mental illness and mental\nillness exists fully within one\nperson and just think about this for a\nsecond right cuz our science is getting\nbetter we have so many more brain scans\nwe have so many of these evidence-based\ntherapies we have third generation antis\npsychotics like aeropol which can now be\nused for depression we have all of this\nstuff our science is getting better and\nwe're losing the war on Mental\nHealth why it's because we assume it\nexists within one person it's the one of\norgan of the body that requires someone\nelse and this is why dogs and cats have\na protective effect on suicidality and\nmental illness because if you're a dude\nyou can't touch other people you can't\nask people to touch you right even if I\nsay it there's going to be a thousand\npeople like H didn't touch me bro like\ntheing pedophile creepy you can't do\nthat you can't walk up to someone and\nsay Hey can I have a hug what are they\ngoing to do they're going to call you a\ncreep so if you really look at the\nresearch what are the two variables that\ncorrelate the most with male\nsuicide it's isolation and thwarted\nbelongingness what does that mean\nthwarted belongingness that's a mouthful\nit means this person is trying to fit in\nand the world is not letting\nthem and I've seen this in men who are\nprivileged one patient I'm going to call\nhim Thor because he's like Thor he's\ntall he's handsome he's muscular he's\nsuccessful\nand Thor is on the verge of suicide\neveryone's confused why he makes seven\nfigures a\nyear happily married has kids and what\nhappens if you're a successful man today\nif you do your duty people come and ask\nyou for\nhelp right because that's what a man's\nsupposed to do you're supposed to help\nother people can't look out for yourself\nthat makes you an\n[ __ ] so soon he's taking care of this\nperson and now he's taking care of this\nperson and now he's taking care of his\nparents and he's paying this person\nmedical bills paying this person's\nmortgage and the people keep coming and\nkeep coming and keep\ncoming on the flip end of the spectrum I\nremember working with a a guy in\njail in jail at the age of 19\nsuicidal how'd you get here I sold drugs\nwhy'd you sell drugs because my family\ntold me that a man provides and I have\nto sell drugs it's the only way I can\npay the rent why are you paying the rent\nfor four adults in your house I don't\nknow they just told me that I needed to\ndo\nit thwarted\nbelongingness you try to do what people\nask you to do and you're not allowed to\nask for help and by the way you're\nmentally ill so take this\npill one day at the end of a therapy\nsession Thor told me that he loved\nme now this is a problem for a\npsychiatrist we literally have classes\nabout\nthis don't tell patients you love them\nand sure as hell don't hug them I've had\nsome supervisors tell me that you should\nnever touch a patient there are good\nreasons to believe that because\nsometimes people are traumatized and\nwhatnot right so I'm not saying that\nit's it's bad but it's like now\nwhat like this person has no men that he\ncan say this too and we've formed a bond\nand now what do I say I didn't know what\nto say CU all my training in that moment\nwhat did I want to say I wanted to say I\nlove you too bro and then it would be\ndone but I can't do that\nright so the one person that men are\nallowed to go to and they can convey\ntheir feelings to is not allowed to tell\nthem that they love them like by our\nProfessional\nStandards to Made Real five head move I\njust started crying because I felt so\nsad because that's what I wanted to say\nbut I couldn't and so I started crying\nturn on the Waterworks baby trump card\nand then we had a good cry\ntogether right and I think he got the m\nmessage and then we\nhugged and I talked to my supervisor\nabout it we kind of you know talked\nabout it and things like\nthat and this is the problem\ntoday is that like we're we don't let\nwe're not taken care of men because we\nexpect men to take care of themselves\nand even by labeling it mental\nillness we're reinforcing that thing\nbecause then it's not our responsibility\nit's their responsibility\nand despite advances in mental health\nand mental health treatment and all this\nkind of stuff male suicide is still on\nthe\nrise and no one's talking about it why\nbecause they're privileged why do we\nneed to help the\nprivileged right and there's a good\nargument for that\ntoo and now today we're we're\ninvalidating their experiences people\nare asking for help and we're shooting\nthem down we're like hey it's all stupid\nmental illness inside you and by the way\nwe did that to women for decades and\ncenturies and that was terrible\ncenturies 200\nyears when women complained we as a\nprofession of Psychiatry called it\nhysteria you're\nupset girl it is because of your\nuterus we don't have to take your\ncomplaints seriously because you're ill\nyour uterus is making you act that way\nand that lingers\ntoday where when women get upset people\ndon't take them seriously oh you're just\nbeing emotional whether you're being\nemotional or not you can still have a\nvalid\ncomplaint the medical profession does\nthis I've heard horror\nstories about\ngynecologists who are usually Men by the\nway who don't take their patient\nseriously because they're women and\nthey're emotional still lingers to the\nday we did this [ __ ] for 200\nyears I hope we learned our mistakes so\nthat men don't have to suffer it too is\nthat fair no but I don't want fairness\nin this situation if we screwed up and\nwe did an injustice to an entire 50% of\nour population for 200 years I'd hope we\ncan learn from that and not do it to the\nother half a win here is not equality a\nwin here is learning from our\nmistakes so if you're a dude who's\nstruggling with suicide by all means go\nsee a mental health professional doesn't\nmean you're mentally ill but it also\ndoesn't mean that mental health\nprofessionals cannot can help they can\nhelp they can absolutely help and it can\nbe so awesome just to learn hey I\nactually do not have a diagnosis this is\nan appropriate\nreaction to a terrible\nsituation there's nothing wrong with\nme that can be liberating\nand for the rest of\ny'all try to hug someone that you know\nask dudes in your life do you need a\nhug and for those of you that have been\nburned by hugging men which I don't\nblame you for if you're not ready to do\nit yet don't do\nit right because that like this is the\nproblem is like we can't really blame\nwomen for this one because when\nsometimes when women are enter enter in\nthe space and they offer a hug dudes are\nso starved for any kind of thing that we\ndon't know how to deal with it and then\nwe dump all of our needs onto this\nperson and we become inappropriately\nattached if there's a starving dog at\nyour doorstep and you feed at\nonce and you get annoyed when it comes\nback and it starts [ __ ] all over\nyour patio I can't blame you for being\nannoyed but let's understand that if\nthere's a starving dog in your feet at\nonce it's going to come back because it\nhas nowhere else to\ngo so give invite the men in your life\nto cry invite the men in your life to\nhug\nyou and dudes start touching other dudes\nand I can guarantee you that that [ __ ]\nis going to get\nclipped why because we cannot listen to\nthat statement without thinking about L\ngay\nright and that's the\nproblem because the only part of this\ntalk that is ever going to get seen is\nthat\nclip questions I\nguess right\nlike people are saying Oscars like start\ntouching people up yeah\nman because the memes is what\nspreads seriously I mean like this ain't\ngoing to work\nchat it's not working what we're doing\nis not working\nI don't know I just know what people\nneed if you want to offer it to a\nstranger go for\nit and for the record it's not like I we\ntalked about a woman like a week ago\nwho's struggling with touch starvation\nso we're starting to see equality but in\na really bad\nway it's sad I'm not saying that women\ndon't have their fair share problems\nthey absolutely do maybe even more than\ntheir Fisher but it ain't a\ncompetition just because one person has\nbreast cancer doesn't mean that we can't\nhave compassion for testicular cancer\nand the right move is not trying to make\nit even it's improving both of their\nlives yeah so Josh Hutchinson is saying\nbig virtual hug so I'm blessed so first\nof all thank\nyou I appreci iate it and this is the\nproblem because what's happening in\nsociety is that we are getting\ntechnology to start fulfilling our\nneeds instead of interacting with\nsomeone and purchasing groceries I can\nhave them delivered to my house without\na single interaction instead of going\nsomewhere and ordering food and\ninteracting with a waiter or waitress I\ncan now have something delivered to my\nhome instead of playing games with other\nhuman beings like soccer and football\nand\n[Music]\ntag and I used to play a game with kids\non my street called\nmultitype which was like when you pick a\nbrand of a particular thing and then you\nget to use that thing in some kind of\nimaginary\ncompetition so like my brother picked\nLego and I picked GI Joe so like when we\nwere playing he could use Lego things\nand I could use GI I don't even know\nwhat the game was we used to make that\nkind of crap up\nbut now we have video games so we don't\nneed to interact with another\nperson and now we even have you know\nwhat used to happen is we' like if I'm\nstruggling at work I would go talk to a\nmentor and talk things through with\nanother human being if I'm struggling\nnow I have chat GPT that does a better\njob than a mentor\ncan we're substituting all of our\nneeds through technology but there's one\nneed that technology has not been able\nto reach yet and that's physical touch\nand boy\nwhen when that happens we're\nGG right we've\ngot\ndevices we have AIS we've got wuss this\nis all coming\ntogether and soon we'll have someone\nthat can talk to you can listen to your\nproblems someone\nsomething and there will be a physical\ncomponent but so far what we're seeing\nis that technology is like a\nhalflife it makes us like a\nvampire it doesn't give us like the full\nthing it just gives\nus a fraction of the thing\nechoing horror saying we need hug bots\nso yes and no the echoing horror of that\nis that we don't need hug Bots we need\nhugs we shouldn't develop Bots to hug\npeople I mean maybe we'll end up doing\nit and I'm not saying that it won't be\nhelpful someone will do a clinical trial\nabout the efficacy of hug Bots and\ndepression they'll show a positive\neffect because I guarantee you there's\ngoing to be some positive effect we\ndon't need hug Bots we need hugs why\ncan't we as humans just do it bro\nwell you know what may save us seriously\nis like cats and\ndogs and cows and\npigs and pet rats that may be what saves\nus it's they're doing good work I don't\nthink we we don't really acknowledge you\nwe talk about solutions to the Mental\nHealth crisis we don't really\nacknowledge that like our best allies\nright this is like I don't know\nlike the rohim showing up at the siege\nof uh what's that uh can't believe it's\nan embarrassment that I'm forgetting the\nname Helms\nDeep the road room showing up is like\ncats and dogs like they're the only\nthing that's keeping us in the game we\ndon't even realize\nit do you need a hug I would like one\nbut thankfully I'm lucky enough to where\nI've got a family that can give me\nthat right and the real challenge is\nthat for a lot of us we only get it from\nour family and I got it when I needed\nit but you know we can't as men we don't\ncuddle with each\nother and that's a\ntragedy right that's why we have cats\nand\ndogs and romantic partners and to a\ncertain degree kids but only until a\ncertain age\nright yes Anonymous 247 is saying guys\nstart\nfamilies you need help with that and\nthat's my\npoint as a dude you can't start a\nfamily someone else has to start one\nwith you you have to join one\nfor dudes it's just solo\nq that can be a sad way to play the game\nof\nlife there's this person in India called\nthe hugging saint\nam I crying I got a little emotional\nthere but I'm good now not to say that\ncrying is bad the other thing that y'all\ncan do seriously is like have a good cry\nso we're going to talk about this for a\nsecond so sometimes I'll ask my patients\nand I learned this from one of my\nsupervisors who was at Mass General\nHospital as well and was from down\nsouth so this guy would be like when was\nthe last time you had a good cry he'd\nask his patience this question when was\nthe last time you had a good cry and\nthen like something about the way that\nhe said he was just like he was some\nkind of wizard CU he just say that and\nlike people would be they just start\ncrying and he'd like hug them and there\nyou go let it out let it out there it's\nall right now it's all right he just\nlike had this beautiful silky smooth\nsouthern\naccent and the thing is like we don't\ntalk about having a good cry even the\nmen that I worked with especially they\ncan have a bad cry they can go into the\ncorner of their house when no one's\naround and be in isolation and cry\nthat's hard for a lot of dudes but the\ngood cry is something that's really hard\nto find the good cry is when you cry and\nusually someone else is there and then\nyou feel\ngood we know how to feel bad when we cry\nas a society but we've lost the ability\nfor the good\ncry that's what happens in therapy right\nhalf of therapy is the good cry it's\nlike the cry and it's like you know and\nwe'll I usually like talk about hugging\nmy patients and stuff we figure out what\nthe right boundaries are and then we'll\nhave a we'll have a\nhug so I hope y'all are able to good cry\nand give other people around you the\nchance to good\ncry just ask them when was the last time\nyou had a good cry and people like\nwhat's wrong with you like come on man\nyou know and give people that chance\nit's okay to\ncry you don't have to fix\nit especially as dudes we want to fix\neverything you don't have to fix it just\nlet him cry it'll be a good\ncry a good cry is when you're usually\nsad or in grief and then you start\ncrying and someone accepts that and then\nyou feel\nbetter yeah and now we're seeing it in\nchat like I haven't cried with someone\nsince dude how though I don't cry I hear\ny'all\nand this is where I haven't figured out\nlook I'm a decently smart guy pretty\nwell trained learned a lot of stuff I\nhave not yet figured out and I'm going\nto work on it how to teach people how to\ncry over the\nInternet yeah this person who's\ngot I think it's cilic the the E Eastern\nEuropean Russian characters cuz the\ncorner is the manly way to cry you're\ndamn right if you're crying at all\nbetter Cry Like A Man by yourself or no\none can see you or hear\nyou is there a cry meditation I'm going\ntry to figure it out\nchat people like I haven't cried in 10\nyears\nokay and we see that sometimes on stream\nwhen we interview people right like so I\nknow\nwe can try it\nnow you don't want to try it let's\ntry so the first thing is it's really\nsad that you haven't cried in a long\ntime\nseriously like think about the life that\nyou have to\nlive where you are not allowed to cry I\nmean sure you're allowed to\ncry but you can't actually do it you\ncan't blame anyone for not\ncrying right people will tell you that\nit's okay to cry but you know it's not\nokay to\ncry cuz people will treat you\ndifferently and that's\nsad and it's honestly kind of tragic\nthat you've had to carry this around all\nby yourself for such a long\ntime and there there's no end in sight\nand you've kind of given up on\nthat cuz it's been 10 years what's 11\nwhat's 12 what's 13 what's 14 that's\njust your lot in life you've been like a\ngood boy and you've just accepted\nit and it's so tragic that you're\nmissing something in life and you've\ngiven up complete hope that it'll ever\nbe there you've just taken it off your\nplate you've gotten rid of the\npossibility that you'll ever be able to\ncry and the Really tragic thing is\nyou're kind of okay with that you've\nlearned how to survive being cut off\nfrom a part of\nyourself and what's really tragic is\nthat you've had to learn how to survive\nbeing cut off from a part of\nyourself and you deserve\nmore you should be able to\ncry and not be judged for it\npeople should be able to respect you\neven if you\ncry but you've lived a life where that\njust hasn't been an\noption right and what are you doing now\nfeels bad\nman because even if I'm trying to help\nyou get there you don't want to\ngo and that's okay it's okay that you\ndon't want to go it's okay that you're\nnot ready yet it's okay you're not doing\nanything\nwrong right whatever you're doing right\nnow is totally fine don't beat yourself\nup for it I'm not going to judge you for\nit I'm not going to say hey you should\nbe crying if you want to cry cry if you\ndon't that's okay we're going to be\npatient and whenever you're ready we are\nhere you may not be ready now you can\nlisten to a recording of this when\nyou're by yourself it's late at night no\none's around whenever you're ready you\ncan do\nit you can do whatever you feel\nlike it's all okay\nright so some people are saying now that\ngot me I did tear up a bit but you can't\ndo more don't know more just a little\nbit just a little bit that's enough feel\nthe lump in my throat no\nmore so shui is saying you're making me\nwant to hug and cry with everyone yeah\nthat's what we need to do\nI met someone recently that I'd known\nfor a long\ntime over the\ninternet and I met them\nand my first response was actually just\ncrying like I just started crying and\nthey started crying and then it was\ngreat and we just hugged and then we\nlike got on with our life it's okay to\ncry and if y'all don't know how it's\nprobably cuz no one showed you\nhow right if you're a\ndude anyone teach you how to cry did\nyour dad cry in front of you did your\ndad cry with you did your brothers cry\nin front of you did your brothers cry\nwith you did your friends cry with you\nin front of you of course not then how\nthe hell are we supposed to learn what\nyou did learn from them is your dad got\nkind of emotional and the lump was in\nhis throat and he choked it down so what\ndid you learn you learn how to choke it\ndown\nright yes some someone saying I took\nshrooms and it\nhelped I'm happy it worked for you but I\nwouldn't recommend\nit all right shall we move\non yeah fist bumping is how men hug\nnowadays that's the\nproblem should fist bump with your whole\nbody\nall\nright let's do this\none I'm going to tell you what it's like\nto be a mom in America right now I\nstarted taking a picture of my son every\nsingle day before school because I want\nto make sure that in the event of a\nschool shooting I know with certainty\nwhat he wore to school that day I told\nmy son that even though the teacher\ntells him otherwise I want him to be the\nlast in line if the fire alarm is pulled\nbecause statistically it is a higher\nchance that an active shooter is pulling\nthe alarm to L lure the children out\nthan an actual fire I refuse to get my\nson light up shoes because he can't hide\nin a closet if his shoes are lighting\nup I'm adding a bulletproof insert to my\nkid's backpack for his school supply\nlist next\nyear meanwhile people are more worried\nabout their second amendment than my\nsoon to be second grader and yet still\nevery single day my son is expected to\nplace his little hand over his heart and\npledge allegiance to a country that\ndoesn't give a [ __ ] if he's safe at\nschool I don't know chat I\nmean things are so messed up in America\nright now\nyeah I mean so I'm with y'all that it\nseems a little bit paranoid seems a\nlittle bit\nparanoid right but I I want to say that\nwe've had something like 300 mass\nshootings in 2023 in\nAmerica so the scary thing about being a\nparent in America right now is you can\nwatch that and you can think wow\nthat that's\ntoo that's\nuh that lady's\nparanoid but here's the thought that I\nthink a lot of parents are having In\nAmerica which is how paranoid do I need\nto\nbe to keep my child alive\nright because it's\nhappening there was a school shooting a\nfew months\nago about like 60 or 70 miles from where\nI live maybe a little bit\nmore and everyone we kind of know right\nlike oh like this is happening all over\nthe place no one thinks it's going to\nhappen to\nthem do you want to take that kind of\nchance with your kids\nlife I think there's we we've done stuff\non school shootings before like we've\nalready talked about it I think that\nthis it's kind of simple like there's\nfrom a data perspective the answer is\nsimple\nit's reduce the access to\nguns and I think like even if you kind\nof think this through I think there's\nsome\nproblems with like we can give people\nmore guns to protect them because I just\nwant youall to imagine this scenario\nokay let's say you hear some gunfire in\nlike a public place\nlike a shopping mall and you walk in and\nyou've got your gun ready and you see\nsomeone standing up with a handgun out\nshooting in a particular\ndirection what do you do you pull out\nyour gun and you shoot him right cuz\nthey're\nshooting and then a few seconds after\nthat you get shot you're like what the\njust happened cuz the person that you\nshot was the person that was trying to\nshoot the original shooter and was\ntrying to defend everyone and you just\nshot them and then someone else walked\nin and saw you shooting at someone and\nthey were like oh crap there's the\nshooter and they shot\nyou how are you supposed to when\neveryone's got guns how are you supposed\nto identify who the bad guys\nare like really like I'm not trying to\nbe political\nhere I'm just trying to ask like let's\nplay the tape through to the\nend like literally what do you do in\nthat\nsituation now there's like four people\nshooting at each other who's the good\nguy and who's the bad\nguy right all yall are\nsaying Turn friendly fire off yeah\nso video games have controls like that\nreal life does it you can't turn\nfriendly fire off in real\nlife there's no way to do\nthat\nright it's that that that's like that's\nthe problem this is why you could play\nFPS games like do y'all real like yall\nhave played have y'all ever played an F\nFPS game with friendly fire off any kind\nof FPS with friendly fire off is a train\nwreck this is why all of the FPS games\nhave friendly fire on right where you\ncan't hurt your allies because otherwise\nyou literally cannot play the game\nthere's no point in strategy tactics\nVictory because you're just going to be\nshooting your allies and it's GG that's\nthe world we live in the actual real\nworld we live in is\nthat you can't design a game like that\nbecause it's\n[ __ ] the only salvation that we've got\nis that there's no auto aim there's no\naim assist only salvation we've\ngot even drg doesn't have friendly fire\nright like I think if you hit someone\nwith a bullet it doesn't hurt them they\ncan take damage from Gren ades and stuff\nbut the other thing about drg that makes\nit acceptable even if you do have\nFriendly Fire is it's threedimensional I\ncan grappling hook to the [ __ ]\nceiling and I can build platforms and I\ncan dig a trench you can't do that\nIRL the games in which there's some\ndegree of Friendly Fire have like the\nability for basically the characters to\nfly\ndrg mentioned of course drg is\nepic you all know what I'm doing with\ndrg I'm\nwaiting like I want to wait like a year\nor two until there's like a whole new\nset of missions we're going to go back\nthrough it you can't just sign up when\nthere's just one new mission you got to\nwait till like 3 or\n4 life has a bad game design\nbrah life has arguably the worst game\ndesign arguably has the\nbest I don't know so the cool thing\nabout life though is that even if\nthere's a crappy game design we can to a\ncertain degree change the\nrules that's what's cool about it so we\nhave some command console\nfunctionality right we have things like\nscience you can at least party up and\nTackle problems\ntogether okay\nokay let's move\non sorry y'all if the last one was too\nloud death is just the end what's the\npoint what's the point in what Liv might\nas well just kill\nyourself um this one we need higher\nvolume right but if death is just the\nend what's the point what's the point\nyou want live in might as well just kill\nyourself so if you're watching a movie\nand you're really enjoying it something\nwith Kevin Harting yeah and someone\npoints out that this will end eventually\nyou just go oh forget it then what's the\npoint and just turn it off no cuz I can\nwatch it again well I think life is\nprecious cuz you can't watch it again I\nmean you can believe in an afterlife if\nthat makes you feel better doesn't mean\nit's true but once you realize you're\nnot going to be around I think that's\nwhat makes life so\nmagical you know this place makes me\nwonder yeah what's that\nBo which would be\nworse to live as a\nmonster or to die as a good\nman one day you'll eat your last meal\nsmell your last flour hug your friend\nfor the very last time you might not\nknow it's the last mon so that's why you\nshould do everything you love with\npassion you know treasure the few years\nyou've got because that's all there\nis I watched Ride Along too five times\nwell you haven't wasted your life then\noh\nbeautiful got to hand it to Ricky\njvas doing some strong work\nthere all\nright so there's one really important\nthing to understand\nand that is time is a\nscam\nokay so if we think about what screws us\nup most of the time in\nlife it is\ntime why do you waste today because\nthere is tomorrow that which can be done\nat any time will be done at no time why\nis procrastination so successful\nprocrastination is a solution by the way\nI wait till the end the last minute to\nget things\ndone time in our conception and\nrelationship with time causes us so many\nproblems so if I think about eating some\nfood the enjoyment from the food is in\nthe\nfood everything else is a scam oh I can\neat it tomorrow so I'm going to take it\nfor granted therefore I don't enjoy\nit appreciate today because it'll be\ndifferent\ntomorrow you know when everyone who's\nask these questions what do you wish you\nknew when you were now that you're older\nwhat do you wish you knew when you were\nyoung people like take care of your body\nright which is true by the way why\nshould you take care of your body it's\nbecause in order to be healthy the older\nyou get the harder you have to work it's\nlike an exponential difficulty curve\nright it's a it's kind of like one of\nthese games that\nlike there's round two and round four\nand round they don't end you just keep\ngoing until you die that's what life is\nand it gets exponentially harder because\nyour back hurts and your immune system\nstarts falling apart and your kidneys\nare falling apart and now you need\ndialysis and you can't think clearly\nbecause you have so much ammonia\nnitrogen in your brain your brain is\nclouding in your 20s you could be\nlike eat\n[ __ ] don't take care of your body and\nstill like everything\nworks time is what screws us up so\nmuch right I'm 30 years old should I go\nto college I'll graduate when I'm 34\nfour years from now you're going to be\n34\nanyway I got a late start in life other\npeople are ahead of\nme someone else graduated when they're\n16 and I'm\n18 I still haven't graduated\ntime screws Us in so many\nways so why does like all these people\nlike\nbudha what do they do where's all this\ncrap with meditation and stuff the point\nis to get rid of the dimension of\ntime if you can get rid of the dimension\nof\ntime your life will become comes so much\neasier it's kind of\nweird say you're eating a\nsandwich can you get a better sandwich\nin the future are you comparing it to\nyour sandwiches of the\npast both of those will decrease your\nenjoyment this is a sandwich and this is\nit even if there's a food that you\ndislike if it is the only time in your\nlife that you are going to get to try\nthat food you will actually enjoy it\nmore today is all I\nhave how am I going to spend\nit and you may say okay if today was the\nlast day of my\nlife I would live the most honic day of\nmy\nlife and so even if that's the case\nthink about it for a second right\nbecause we don't actually live to\nmaximize our joy we don't wake up in the\nmorning and think to myself how am I\ngoing to pack as much awesomeness into\ntoday today as I can we wake up and we\n[ __ ] scroll and then a little bit of\ndopamine there and a spurt there and a\nlittle bit there and now watch something\nnow I'm wandering over here and now I'm\nhungry so I might as well eat something\nwe don't actually try to even enjoy\nevery\nday we just avoid work because we can do\nit tomorrow and then we feel guilty\nabout that and we manage that guilt with\nsome kind of like lukewarm pleasure\nit's like a\nhalflife with not enough effort and not\nenough enjoyment and not enough of every\nanything and so if you start to like\nlive without the dimension of time\nsomething interesting is going to\nhappen you want to go into Hedonism and\ntry I'm saying have a great day treat\nyourself you know line up a great\nday you say what about tomorrow well\n[ __ ] you're going to procrastinate\nanyway so you're not going to lose\nanything might as well enjoy\nyourself and once you start doing that\nsomething cool will\nhappen because the more hedonistic you\nbecome at some point when you go to bed\nyou're going to think to myself you're\nnot actually going to think this was an\namazing day maybe the first day you do\nit second day you're you're going to\nthink to\nmyself I'm actually not happy with today\nThird Day the more days that you have of\nhedonistic enjoyment the more regret you\nwill have at the end of your day and\nthen you will discover something really\nimportant in addition to the Hedonism if\nyou do something\ngood if you help out another human\nbeing if you actually do study for a\ncouple of hours because think about when\nyou go to bed at night what are you the\nmost proud of what makes you happy and\nfulfilled I don't know if you all have\nexperienced this but there's this good\ntiredness\nit's like if you went for a hike you\nfeel tired at the end of the day but in\na good way it's like I used this body\ntoday and it was good there's some days\nthat you do a good job at work and you\nabsolutely crush\nit and you feel tired you feel\ncognitively drained or you have a fight\nwith your significant other and you all\ntalk things through and youall feel\nemotionally\nspent learn how to feel\nspent that's good\nthat's the problem is we get confused\nbetween tired and\nspent if you want to start like really\nenjoying life and that's the cool thing\nis once you feel spent you actually are\nokay with that even if it was painful in\nthe moment you feel good about yourself\nand then what'll start to happen is\nyou're going to start cultivating that\nbecause the Hedonism isn't\nenough and when we say live every day to\nthe fullest this is what we're talking\nabout be spent at the end of the day not\ntired\nspent you may say how do I do that well\nyou know those things that are hard that\nyou feel spent at the end of the day\nthat's how you build your life because\nthe more that you spend your days\ninstead of wasting them the more your\nlife will move in the right direction\nand don't get scammed by your mind\nbecause your mind will say it isn't\nenough\nit hasn't happened\nyet our mind screws us with the\ndimension of\ntime I have so many\npatients will start treatment\nPsychotherapy plus medication let's say\n6 months in 8 months in their life is\nnow good they are happy they are healthy\nthey're doing well at\nwork going on vacation they come into my\noffice what do they want to do they want\nto stop the\nmedication and it's fine right so if\nthey want to stop the medication it's my\nresponsibility as a doctor try to do\nthat in as safe as way as possible this\nis where I tell them to hold on a\nsecond you've spent all of this energy\nto get to where you are just enjoy\nit what if I'm on the SSRI too long talk\nabout that here's the data here's what\nit shows chances are you'll be\nfine we always worry about the future\nand it paralyzes Us in the\npresent we're so terrified of someone\nbreaking up with us that they we drive\nthem\naway if you're in a relationship enjoy\nit enjoy it if you're eating a meal\nenjoy it if it's not good enough you can\nenjoy it\nanyway last last thing I'll leave youall\nwith if you really want to understand\nthis because Yogi figured this out was\nbrilliant mind has two fluctuations that\nlead to\nsuffering worry\nanxiety is in the\nfuture regret is in the past when your\nmind goes to those two places you will\nend up with worry and\nregret then you may say to yourself no\nno no but in the present I can be\nanxious no you can't can't be anxious\nunless you're in the future if you walk\nup to someone and you you're anxious in\nthe moment you start to think if I open\nmy mouth I'm going to be I'm going to\nsound like an idiot what are you\nactually thinking about you're not\nthinking about the present you're\nthinking about the future consequences\nof the present\naction there's a physiologic level to\nanxiety as well which can absolutely\nexist in the present right so we know\nsome things from science that maybe the\nyogis missed maybe they\ndidn't but if you really think about it\nyou can't this is why mindfulness is a\ntreatment for both depression and\nanxiety because anytime your mind exists\nin the present you can't have a regret I\nam ashamed ashamed of what you're not\nashamed of the present you're ashamed of\nthe\npast the nature of it you can't feel\nguilt over what you're doing now you can\nfeel guilt of things that have been done\nin the past or you can have an\nanticipation of guilt in the future\nwe experience guilt in the present it's\nthe only time we experience\nthings so if you can Free Yourself of\nthe dimension of time you're freed of a\nlot of different\nthings\nquestions good night Samuel\nokay yeah well said see time isn't the\nCure time is the\nwound\nbrilliant time heal all heals all wounds\ntime also causes them\ncan I look to the future if I expect\npositive outcomes my friend if you are\nexpecting you're already in the future\nyou can't have an expectation about the\npresent you can only have an expectation\nof the future that is the definition of\nan\nexpectation for those of you that are\nasking about executive dysfunction and\nefficiency check out Dr K's guide to\nADHD and doing\nstuff we'll teach you how to do\nstuff I hope you can read this but have\nyou ever heard about emotional numbness\nabsolutely check out videos on\nAlexia which we'll talk about in a\nsecond and um yeah we're probably going\nto do something specifically around\ntrauma soon\nso can it be both so let's understand\nhow time can heal all\nwounds so in this text that we talked\nabout earlier banali yoga\nsutras the first sentence or actually\nmaybe the second\nsentence is\nyog which\nmeans yoga is the sensation of\nfluctuations of the Mind\nso this is what a lot of\npeople\nmiss the nature of mind is\nimpermanent so no feelings last forever\nwe may think oh my god I've been guilty\nfor 15 years and it'll never go away not\nactually how it works explain why in a\nsecond so the nature of the mind is that\nit changes this is why we get bored\nbecause the mind can't sit on one thing\nit needs something new I'm bored give me\nsomething else\nthe other thing about the nature of mind\nso if we think about a fluctuation so\nthere's a still mind and then there's a\nfluctuation what is a fluctuation it\ncould be a sensory input I see something\nI smell something delicious cooking now\nI'm\nhungry it could be a memory right so now\nmy mind is thinking about this thing it\ncould be an\nemotion but the nature of emotions is\nthat they don't last forever so the mind\nalso returns to homeostasis\nthis is the sensation of the fluctuation\nof the\nmind and you may say but what about\nemotional let's think about that right\nso how long does the happiness of your\nwedding day\nlast groomzilla and bridezilla want the\nperfect\nwedding so I can have my perfect day of\nhappiness and if you have your perfect\nday of Happiness are you happy for the\nrest of your life\nno unfortunately not\nif you have a thrilling experience with\na video\ngame let's say we're about to lose and\nit's one V5 and I like come back and I'm\ngoing to like 5V one Rampage and like\nyeah GG last minute comeback\nwooo does that last forever once you\nhave one comeback in a video game are\nyou done playing the game because you're\nhappy for the rest of your life no you\nactually need to play the game over and\nover and over again again to evoke that\nexperience if it was permanent you would\nonly have to play the game once and\nyou're done GG I'm\nout games have figured this\nout nothing in the mind is permanent so\nwe're going to get people to keep\nplaying and this is what our life\nbecomes since nothing in the mind is\npermanent we have to chase the same crap\nover and over and over again to get the\nsame result in the\nmind got to get high today got to get\nhigh tomorrow got to get high the next\nday got to get high twice on Friday\nthree times on Saturday twice on Sunday\nbut man I wish it was three times got to\nqueue up again got to find a new game\ngot to do more more more this sandwich\nis good I need to find a better\nsandwich so the nature of the mind is\nthat it's\nfluctuate and so how does time heal all\nwounds because if the Mind returns to\nhomeostasis and nothing is permanent\nif we have a wound in the mind it will\nreturn to homeostasis and this is what\nwe\nsee studies on\ngenocide show that populations who\nexperience\ngenocide not everyone even gets\ndiagnosed with PTSD some people are\nresilient and actually come back to\nnormal and live healthy normal\nlives that's kind of wild it's the\nnature of the mind to return to the\npresent That's How Time Heals all wounds\nnow how does time cause\nalls because it it is in that dimension\nof time that the Mind\nsuffers so when you enjoy something in\nthe moment it's chill in fact your mind\nshuts\noff I learned this the most powerfully\nwhen I was walking on the beach one day\nI was walking splashing in in the waves\nand I was watching a Sunset and it was\nlike a perfect\nmoment holding hands with my wife my\nwife is pregnant with our first\nkid was quite pregnant we know\nthat hell is going to break loose pretty\nsoon baby's coming soon and then it's\nlike game is over life is over but in\nthat moment it was a perfect moment and\nit was just perfect for me anyway she\nwas like eight months pregnant so she\nmay have had\ndifficulty and then our mind adds the\ndimension of time if I start thinking\nabout the future and how I won't be able\nto do this again it destroys the\nmoment if I start worrying about the\npast it destroys the\nmoment literally when people are filled\nwith regret and shame and guilt with\nnegative self- attitude in\ndepression food becomes\ntasteless life feels\nempty I've been dumped I can't taste\nfood in grief I become\nanhedonic the food is the same\nwhat's changed is your capacity to taste\nit and no one says food is tasteless\nwhen they're like chilling in the moment\neveryone says food is tasteless when\ntheir mind is filled with\nregret or\nworry I can't relax why not because I'm\nworried about the\nfuture you can't be worried about the\npresent you're worried about the future\nthe only place that worries exist the\nnature of a worry is that is a thing\nthat has not happened yet\nthat's the definition of a worry the\ndefinition requires the dimension of\ntime and so with all this meditation\ncrap what are they trying to do they're\ntrying to teach you to come to the\npresent and once you start coming to the\npresent you get good at it then you\nbecome\npeaceful and what's kind of wild is like\nthis is why people with meditation can\nhandle\nhardship I was in the o one\nday op ating room as a third-year\nmedical\nstudent and one of the surgeons got\npissed at me for many of my colleagues\nthat would send them into a tail\nspin because my colleagues are like\npeople who are straight A students I\nlike man this guy's an\n[ __ ] that ain't on\nme right what's happening in this moment\nif the dude gives me a bad grade he\ngives me a bad grade I didn't do\nanything wrong I can't actually do\nanything about that\nright it's kind of weird oh but you're\ngoing to get a bad if I get a bad grade\nI get a bad\ngrade iron is I got honors in the\nrotation one of his colleagues triying\nto convince me to be a surgeon because\nthey realized that I wasn't doing\nanything wrong but we get so bent out of\nshape about crap that is out of our\ncontrol in the future if I get a bad\ngrade I get a bad grade what am I going\nto get kicked out of school\nno in the present do what you can focus\non the present\nyou can't get get an A on a test but you\ncan study\ntoday and if you never study today\nyou're not going to get an A on the test\nor maybe you will maybe you will walk in\nand your answer sheet gets mixed up with\nsomeone else's answer sheet and you end\nup getting an\nA so learn to live in the\npresent how do you do that you can start\nby meditating\nbut practically it's just like be where\nyou are right\nnow right because if you think of the\nthing is we avoid the present because we\nthink it's\npainful but most the pain that actually\nhappens in our mind is not from the\npresent it's actually from the future\nand from the past\nbecause even if you think about it you\nyou all may say but no Dr K I hate\nstudying what does hating studying\nactually look like in the\nmind it's not the present I give you a\nhint oh my God it's been 15 minutes and\nI've only read one page I have 47 pages\nto go\nthat's what hating studying looks\nlike it's the\nfuture oh my god I've studied for three\nhours and I don't even remember what I\nstudied in hour\none that's what hating studying looks\nlike I'm not saying it's easy and it can\nbe uncomfortable right cuz getting your\nmind to sit in the Pres because mine\ndoesn't like sitting in the present so\nmind is like oh this is boring I want to\nbe doing something else I want to dot\ndot dot now it's moving to the future\nagain so I'll give you all an\nexample of like how studying works when\nyou're in the\npresent yal MX plus b when you actually\ntry to understand\nthat how is it that yal MX plus P why is\nis there a plus b instead of a minus\nB why is it yal\nMX why isn't it ax equals or a y equal m\nplus\nb when you ask those questions you're\nactually learning and when you're\nactually learning it's interesting it's\nkind of like weird how does that work\nbut you're not when you're thinking why\nor how does this work you're looking at\nit you're not thinking about the future\nand you're not thinking about the\npast\nright all right we've got time for maybe\na couple\nquestions\nand then we got a wrap\nyeah so you know there's one thing\nthere's one big shortcoming of this\nwhole philosophy that I haven't been\nable to\nconquer and that is\nnausea so here I\nwas thinking like oh my god I've\ndiscovered pain comes from the past and\nregret and suffering comes from the\nfuture and\nanxiety you cannot suffer in the present\nyou can suffer in the future and you can\nsuffer in the past you can do not be\nanxious in the present the anxiety is\nabout what your\nfuture and then I got a stomach bug and\nI started vomiting and I vomited so much\nand I was sitting there and I used all\nof my yoga training cuz my stomach was\nterrible and I felt nauseous and I was\nlike I've learned the yogic secret\nsuffering is in the future I didn't give\na crap about vomiting 5 minutes from now\nI was like this is terrible I wish this\nwould go away I can't wait until I get\nto the Future please Future come\nnow I don't know\nman and I'm sure there's an enlightened\nperson out there who maybe knows the\nanswer to that\nquestion I couldn't detach from\nit and even when I work with patients\nwith anxiety things I I will teach them\nor like I will teach you the secret I'm\nDr Kay come learn the secret of anxiety\nwhich is in the future and then they\nhave a [ __ ] panic attack they're like\nI feel like I'm I'm I'm dying are you\nworried about dying no I conquered that\npart it just feels like my my heart is\ngoing to stop beating my heart is\nsending me\nsignals that get activated when people\nare dying and my brain is getting the\nsignals I know it's a panic attack I'm\nnot worried about the future Dr K I'm\ngetting the signals that I'm dying and\nthey hurt I'm\nlike yeah I don't know what to do about\nthat but by all means y'all play around\nwith it and figure it out for me and if\nI figure it out I'll let y'all\nknow so one good point so inverted\nGoblin is saying actual vomiting is all\nin the present just like orgasms that is\nwhy orgasms part of the reason they feel\nso good so if you read these yogic texts\nthey'll say that there are two things\nthat naturally bring the Mind perfectly\nto the present and one of them is\norgasm I was advertised a segment on\nsexy talk\nokay maybe one\nday I'm sick right now which is I guess\ngood\nbut okay you guys want the rules of sexy\ntalk\nokay so I'll see how many I can come up\nwith right now so rule number\none a lot of people think about about\ntalking dirty so people think that okay\ntalking dirty is sometimes creepy right\nso we'll see like these text messages of\nlike oo\nwoo right and it's like oh I've got like\na throbbing whatever like a hard\nwhatever a wet whatever or whatever you\nknow like some\nsome some combination of variables it's\nnot that and sometimes people find that\narousing and other times people think\nit's creepy okay and then everyone talks\nabout boundaries and and things like\nthat and and all that kind of stuff\nwhich is good and all that but let's\nunderstand like the first most basic\nrule anytime you're doing dirty\ntalk you want to\nconvey that you find this person\narousing so sometimes when people do\ndirty talk they talk about their own\npleasure or they say say things that\nthey find arousing right like the oooo\ncrowd but you're not thinking about the\nother person you're thinking about\nyourself\nand so even if you use the same\nsentences who are you thinking about\nwhen you\ntalk so if you say to the other person I\nam aroused does that turn you on or does\nthat turn them on and then you may say\nWell they're not interested in arousing\nme then don't dirty talk them for [ __ ]\nsake that's the key thing about Dirty\nTalk they have to want to arouse you and\nthen you start start saying\nthings and then you're like but how do I\nget\nthem how do I get them there you can't\nget them there then don't do the dirty\ntalk\nokay so dirty talk is for their benefit\nnot your\nbenefit right that's like rule number\none so think about the other\nperson and this is where like but I\ndon't know what they like so that's why\nyou got to Pilot a couple of things\nright some people\nlike you got to figure out like what\nthreshold of word to\nuse and so you can suggest more and you\ncan like you gradually want to start\nwith\nsuggestive like you can even say\nsomething like here's a\nsimple input right I can't wait to see\nyou I've been thinking about you all day\nso early\nstage you want to say that you don't\nwant to stay at at the\nend right if you're in the middle of the\nact or towards the end you don't want to\nsay I've been thinking about you all day\nbecause then the person is going to be\nlike what have you been thinking you\nshould be thinking about like what are\nyou you know can't say so you start off\nwith like\nsuggestive what is that's not even dirty\nand that's the\npoint and then you see how they respond\nright if they're playful they'll say\nwhat have you been thinking\nand if they're playful and they're\naggressive then you're\nlike I can't get it out of my mind but\nI'm embarrassed by\nit right and then it's like and then you\nwant to pull them in a little\nbit oh what are you thinking that's so\nembarrassing tell me\nmore like 99% of the time that's the\nanswer you're going to get and now\nthey're inviting you you get what I'm\nsaying you don't want to come out with\nit you lead them into\nit right and Cody bent is saying who\nneeds a good spanking that's not what\nyou\nsay yall get that so start\nsuggestively and suggestively doesn't\nmean you know something involving\ngenitals anyway and then there's there's\na progression which I I'm not prepared\nfor in the moment but that's like step\none and\ntwo okay like you'll get the principles\nthere right and it's not like offensive\nbecause if the person isn't interested\nin\nyou or they're like you know you like\nyou shock them a little bit you're also\nlike so let's say that they're\ninterested in you so then you know\nthey'll they'll be like what have you\nbeen thinking cuz now they've made you\nuncomfortable\nnow that they've made you uncomfortable\nthey're in control if they're in control\nthey can be safe if they can be safe\nthey can sort of accelerate or you know\nput the brakes on what have you been\nthinking now you have me intrigued and\nthen it's like well look honestly get\none or two drinks in me and then maybe\nyou'll find out and it's like bam son\ngood job right because they'll say okay\nwhen and where or they'll say yeah\nI don't think that's going to happen\nyou're like cool sorry I brought it up\nand then you back out or if you're\nembarrassment is kind of a turnoff for\nthem you know they'll\nlike they'll take a step back you kind\nof got to get a feel for where they\nare and that's that's the whole point is\nlike you don't want to you know push\nthings that's when you become creepy\nit's it's all it's about really about\ncommunication the biggest problem with\ndirty talk is everyone's like it's\nsomething I'm going to do to you no it's\nnot something you do to someone it's\nsomething you do with\nsomeone it's communication it's empathy\nit's paying attention to their\nsignals right it's not just like first\ndo this then do this then do this then\ndo this you have to understand what the\nprinciple is we want to open up with an\nappetizer and even before the appetizer\nwe want to open up with an Amo\nB and after that appetizer we're going\nto move on to the main\ncourse\nanyway this one\nday not\ntoday start with that\n[Music]\nanyway I love\ny'all lots of hugs all\naround\nright yeah y'all will know what dessert\nis dessert is when you've been satisfied\nby the full entree and then you do\nsomething that makes them feel even\nbetter so you can do some kind of you\nknow fix some something to\neat cuddle\nmaybe a\nmassage ask them hey can I make you a\ncup of hot tea and read you Harry Potter\nbook four well we don't do that anymore\nbecause I think you know the cancelling\nof Harry Potter you want me to read you\na story you want a bedtime\nstory and like that's how works\nwell right it doesn't end with orgasm\nthat's the other big mistake that people\nget it's like orgasms like\nGG yeah everyone talks about\nseconds right and that's where it's like\nlike intimacy is more than\nsex Aftercare is\nop the cancelling the calling them of\nthe Uber\npeople think that Alphas will call Ubers\nafter you're done having\nsex but the alpha doesn't call an Uber\nthe alpha calls Uber\nEats um\nhimadri sheer ganguli I'm not quite sure\nbut if you've had an acute issue where\nyou're like struggling to be normal like\nnormalize then I'd say Seek a mental\nhealth\nevaluation right so there's this thing\ncalled something called adjustment\ndisorder which is sort of how we\ndescribe people who aren't mentally ill\nbut are just dealing with hard things it\ncould be something in that realm but you\nprobably shouldn't see someone\num I guess there's a time delay on chat\nbecause y'all seem to be reacting\nto now this guy knows how to get women\npregnant okay to be clear chat I've only\ngotten one woman pregnant that I know\nof so I don't know how to get women\npregnant I know how to get one person\npregnant and knowing how to get that\nperson pregnant isn't going to do you\nall any good\nokay is there some way to
