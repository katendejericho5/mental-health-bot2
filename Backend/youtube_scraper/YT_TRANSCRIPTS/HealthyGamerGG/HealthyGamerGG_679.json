    "transcript": "I want to talk to you all today about\nhow to gain control in a world that is\ncomplete chaos\nI've seen this come up more and more\nwhere it seems like society as a whole\nis becoming more depressed I see people\nsort of making posts about okay like how\ndo I exist as a man today right like I\ncan't support a family I'm saddled in\ndebt like I I can't buy a house it seems\nlike\nthere's just more despair everywhere we\nlook and the problem is that the scale\nof problems that people are dealing with\nmaybe that you're dealing with like you\njust can't fix them right you can't fix\nthings like climate change and I heard\nrecently that you know some parts of the\nUnited States have passed bills that\nallow like 14 year olds to work\novernight in restaurants and like meat\npacking plants and things like that like\nwe can't control what is going on today\nand the problem is that what's going on\ntoday it seems like kind of like the\nworld is going to hell right so much\nstuff is getting worse it's like for\nabout a hundred years is the human race\nwe were focused on Surviving and we sort\nof achieved that and even today like\nsurvival is not too hard but somehow at\nsome point we like started prioritizing\nsurvival over like hope and so the world\neveryone's living really long but\neveryone is becoming incredibly hopeless\nthe climate is changing there's runaway\ninflation people are saddled in debt\nthere's even like these these things on\nthe horizon that are really terrifying\nlike you know the number of new children\nbeing born is like stagnating so there\nare some societies where like we won't\nbe able to take care of old people\nanymore\nand so we kind of look at the world like\nwe've created something where you know\nsure we're not dying and there's\nimprovements in things like infant\nmortality and medicine and we kind of\nmanaged covid in some ways but like so\nmuch stuff is getting worse\nand the challenge is if you're like\nexisting in this world I hear people\nstruggling it's like how do I live\nright how do I wake up every day and\ndo something because all of the effort\nthat I put forth seems like it's not\ngonna be enough\nand believe me I see it too it's like I\ncan't fix those problems right like you\ncan't fix climate change you can't fix\ninflation you can't infix wealth\ninequality you can't fix that we're like\nyou know managing to destroy our oceans\nyou can't fix how tall you are and what\nonline dating is looking like and like\nyou can't fix any of that stuff so how\nthe hell do you deal with it\nand it's funny because I see this meme\nthat's been circulating recently about\nyou know the it's like the bus meme\nwhere there's like this person who's\nlooking in one side and they're like\nthey're really sad because they have no\ncontrol in their life and on the other\nside someone is really happy because\nthey have no control in life and that\nseems to be sort of the answer right is\nbecause we can kind of acknowledge that\nwe have no control but then there's like\nsome people who are able to be happy\nwith it and that seems to be a big part\nof the answer but like we don't really\nknow how to do that\nand so I'm going to share with you all\ntoday like how to move from one side of\nthe bus to the other side of the bus how\ncan you move from being devastated by a\nlack of control in your life to actually\nbeing at peace with having no control\nover your life and bizarrely how you can\nactually start to gain some control by\nacknowledging that you have no control\nhey there thanks for watching and I'm\nglad these videos have been helpful a\nlot of times I'll read the comments and\nsee people asking well what do I\nactually do about it which is a great\nquestion and unfortunately the resources\nout there haven't been that great which\nis precisely why I started HD in the\nfirst place HG coaches are trained on a\ncurriculum that integrates my\nunderstanding of what motivates us what\nparalyzes us and most importantly what\nleads to Lasting behavioral change if\nyou're ready to take the next step HG\ncoaches can help you build the life that\nyou want they've helped people build\ncareers help people find relationships\nbuild networks of friends and even do\nthings like discover their passions or\npursue Hobbies so if this sounds like\nlike something that you'd be interested\nin check out the link in the description\nbelow and this is a problem that is\nbecoming increasingly worse frankly\nbecause our brains were not evolved to\ndeal with the society that we live with\ntoday so we have to understand that like\nsociety's changed rapidly over the last\n200 years over the last 2 000 years but\nour brains have evolved over like\nmillions of years hundreds of thousands\nof years and so if you kind of think\nabout what have our brains evolved for\nso what was like the scope of bad news\nthat the human brain could get\nright so we lived in like tribal\ncommunities for like most of like Homo\nsapiens existence maybe like 50 people\n100 people 200 people maybe like 50\nkilometers away there was like another\ntribe and so you wake up every day and\nlike what's the bad news that you can\nget like you only get bad news from your\ntribe maybe someone got sick maybe\nsomeone you know had an accident but\nit's not like the amount of information\nthat is coming into your brain is like\nproblematic it's the other way to think\nabout it is like you can think about\nanimals like chimpanzees and how much\nnegative information or hopeless\ninformation do chimpanzees get and so\nhuman beings haven't evolved for this\nHigh stimulation world that we live in\ntoday our brains have evolved for like\nthese low stimulation natural\nenvironments where maybe once in a while\nthere's kind of like a drought and you\nkind of wonder what you need to do about\nthat but on a day-to-day basis like\nthings are pretty chill that's how they\nare for animals that's how they've been\nfor the majority of human history and\nthat's what our brains have evolved for\nand so generally speaking even then when\nour brains faced a problem like a global\nproblem like a big problem like a\ndrought or a fire or someone in our\ncommunity who's been injured or died\nwhile they were hunting or something\nlike that\nour brains can process that and figure\nout how to deal with it if there's a\ndrought okay we need to like we know\nthere's like a river that's a hundred\nkilometers away so we need to move in\nthat direction we can kind of fix that\nproblem so even in the scale of global\nproblems our brains are able to process\nthat and sort of come up with an answer\nbut if we think about the world today\nthe high stimulation internet\nInformation Age this is the information\nAge and what do we get overloaded with\ninformation so now our brains are sort\nof like overburdened because how do I\nfix climate change how do I fix\ninflation how do I navigate dating how\ndo I navigate you know this Mental\nHealth crisis how do I navigate\nnarcissistic relationships how do I\nnavigate being bullied by some random on\nthe internet how do I navigate the fact\nthat my tweet didn't get as much likes\nas it got yesterday\nthis is what your brain is trying to\nnavigate and it has no idea how to do it\nbecause that's not what it was designed\nfor\nand so what do we do in this situation\nright because we're getting overburdened\nby problems that we can't solve and our\nbrain does not know how to move forward\nso we're seeing an unprecedented level\nof existential depression hopelessness\nand despair and it turns out that\nthere's actually an answer to this\nproblem and human beings sort of figured\nit out actually a couple thousand years\nago when Society started ramping up so\nas Society started to develop what we\nnoticed is that human beings started to\ndespair more about the future about\nthings that were out of their control\nand the best example of this I think\nactually comes from the Hindu tradition\nand there's this text called the\nbhagavad-gita which is a conversation\nbetween a prince and his charioteer and\nthe prince is despairing because there's\na civil war that's about to break out on\non one on the prince's side there's good\nguys and then on the opposite side are\nactually his cousins and on the opposite\nside is a lot of people that he loves\nand respects so his grandfather who he\nloves and respects is on the opposite\nteam his teacher is on the opposite team\nand he's despairing because he's like I\ndon't want to kill my grandfather I\ndon't want to I don't want to destroy\nthe kingdom I don't want like what's\ngonna happen like we're fighting and\nthere's no there's no gonna there's no\nwinning here there's just gonna be\nlosing because even if we live live\nwe've killed half of our family and\nwe've devastated the kingdom and so he's\ndespairing and he's like you know what I\ndon't want to fight like I'm done like\nit's not I can't fix this problem\nso it's charioteer who's Krishna turns\nto him he's kind of believed to be\ndivine or whatever because he why is he\nDivine because he figured this out right\nso he shares with Arjun the prince\none piece of wisdom and the whole\nconversation is Central around this kind\nof one piece of wisdom which is and what\nhe tells Arjun is that as a human being\nyou are not entitled to the fruits of\nyour actions\nall you are entitled to is the actions\nthemselves\nso it sounds kind of bizarre but what he\ntells Arjun is that you can't really\ncontrol whether the kingdom is ruptured\nwhether if you go into battle against\nyour grandfather you can't control\nwhether your grandfather dies or not\nmaybe you could die you can't control\nwhether you're gonna die you can't\ncontrol whether your grandfather's gonna\ndie you can act\nright but even if you go into combat\nsometimes you lose and so what he tells\nArjun is that fundamentally you do not\ncontrol anything outside of you you\ncan't control whether you win the war or\nlose the war you can't control whether\nyou live or die you can plant a seed\nevery single day for the rest of your\nlife and none of them may turn into\nplants all you can control as a human\nbeing is your actions\nand so I went to India and I like\ndiscovered this philosophy it was taught\nto me and I sort of implemented and\ntransformed the way that I started to\nlive my life\nand if you guys want to learn how to do\nthis how can you transition from being\nterrified of all of the things that are\ngoing wrong in the world that fill you\nwith Despair and paralysis because you\ncan't fix them and you're damn right you\ncan't fix them\nright and there are people out there who\nare telling them that yes you can fix\nthese problems if you're a dude who's\nfive foot three balding and overweight\nit's gonna be hard to find\na healthy relationship through online\ndating this is a reality that a ton of\npeople like experience\nand the challenge then is in that\nsituation you can't make someone fall in\nlove with you and I want you all to\nthink about this for a second what are\nthe things that you try to control in\nyour life do you try to get people to\nlove you do you try to get people to\nrespect you do you try to be the best\nright you can't you literally cannot do\nthat it's impossible you cannot control\nsomeone else's thoughts\nand the more that you realize that the\nbetter off you're going to be and so\nwhere does this journey start so I'm\ngoing to teach y'all really simple\nmeditation technique okay simplest\nmeditation technique that I've ever\ntaught so I want you to take your hands\nand I want you to put them in front of\nyou and then I want you to make Fists\nand then I want you to close your eyes\nand clench your fists\nand then your hands are kind of touching\nin front of you and now I want you to\nkind of move them out\nand clench your upper body\nand feel the tension and now come back\ntowards the center gently keep your eyes\nclosed and just feel your body\nand now take a deep breath in and out\nand relax\nlet your arms come back to your sides\nkeep your eyes closed and I want you to\nfeel\nwho you are in the second feel your body\nfeel notice your mind\nand notice right now in this moment what\ncan you actually control\nif you really pay attention\nyou're going to recognize and you can\nopen your eyes now like this is it\nthis is everything you can control you\ncannot control anything outside of this\nI'm trying to film something right now\nbut I can't control whether the hard\ndrive records it I can't control whether\nthe camera messes up I can't control\nwhether the power goes out I cannot make\nthis video do you all get that all I can\ndo is show up click a button turn\neverything on and try to shoot it\nwhether it actually gets made or not is\ncompletely out of my control there are\nthousands of things that can happen that\nI have no control over\nso if you want to start this it starts\nwith this very simple exercise and and\nwhat I encourage you all to do is sit\nthere for five minutes and literally\nlook at what you have control over in\nthis life all it is is this it's this\nbody I can control what I do with my\nfingers to a certain extent I can\ncontrol what I do with my mind right and\nsome of us don't have control over our\nbody or our mind and that's it\nonce you realize this it starts to\nchange a lot of different things\nonce you realize that\nhey I can't make this person fall in\nlove with me once you start to realize\nthat okay if I'm five foot two and I'm\nbalding I may not be able to find a\npartner online you can't control that\nand normally what that causes us to do\nis it leads to despair but that's only\nif we're focused on the outcome\nso if I wake up every day and I focus on\nwhat I can actually do which is what\nthis instrument what this human body is\ncapable of what's bizarre is this leads\nto peace and it leads to success and the\nreal tragedy is that the more that we\nspend energy trying to control things\noutside of us the worse things actually\nbecome because think about it for a\nsecond right if I spend my entire day\nworrying about how to get this person to\ncontinue to love me or not break up with\nme or how I get this promotion or how I\nget an A on a test\nI can't make this person love me and I\ntry and since I fundamentally cannot use\nmind control I can't make that person\nlove me and so I try and I try and I try\nand it's impossible to do so what does\nthat mean it means I inevitably fail the\nmore that I try the more that I fail the\nmore that I fail for an impossible task\nthe more despair I have and that's\nnatural as well because the brain is\nlike hey we've tried this it didn't work\nwe tried this it didn't work we tried\nthis it didn't work we tried this it\ndidn't work I see this all the time when\npeople are talking about dating they're\ntrying trying trying failing failing\nfailing therefore it is impossible and\nit's fundamentally because they cannot\ncontrol another human being all you can\ncontrol is yourself\nand this is something that like I kind\nof discovered luckily right so I went to\nIndia and someone had I I was lucky\nenough to where someone taught me this\nprinciple and I started implementing it\nright I started closing my eyes every\nday and focusing on this person that I\nam and this is the only thing that I can\ncontrol\nand the Really bizarre thing is when I\nwas in college I was focused on getting\nA's and I wanted to be the best and I\nwanted to go to Harvard I wanted all\nthese outcomes\nand what did I end up doing I was so\nworried about being the best that I just\ndidn't study\nand I started failing and failing and\nfailing then I applied to medical school\nthe first time and got rejected from 40\nmedical schools applied again next year\n40 more applied third year hey I got\naccepted to one place and I started med\nschool and at this point I had learned\nthis like philosophy it's even today how\nI try to live my life you know why did I\nkeep applying if I kept getting rejected\nreally simple because there's only one I\ncan't control whether I get in or not\nall I can control is whether I apply\nreally simple I had family members\ntelling me hey this is stupid you should\ndo something else what about Plan B Bro\nyou've been doing nothing for three\nyears I was like you know what this is\nall I control I'm gonna I'm gonna do it\nso when I started med school that\nphilosophy was front and center I didn't\ncare about my grades I cared about hey\nwhat am I going to do I'm going to learn\nmedicine\nand it got to the point where when I\ngraduated\nit's kind of a cringe story I didn't\neven go to my graduation ceremony there\nwas like an award ceremony because in my\nmind I had not even considered there's\nno way I'm going to win in the war\nright because like I'm this degenerate\nwho's like failed a bunch of classes I'm\nnot even looking at my grades I'm just\nfocused on learning the material turns\nout I won two Awards and didn't even\nshow up it never crossed my mind\nand even today I'm not saying this is\nlike it's not I'm not trying to flex on\ny'all I'm just sort of saying that if\nyou sort of think about it right think\nabout how much energy you waste thinking\nabout despairing about things that are\noutside of your control and I've been\nthere I've been so terrified of not\ngraduating from failing a class that I\ncan't even study\nI've been so terrified of being alone\nthat anytime I talk to someone I'm\nthinking about oh my God this person is\ngoing to discover that I'm a loser and\nthat I've never been on a date before or\nthat my dates have been catastrophic and\nI'm trying to go out on dates on people\nbut I can't even ask them out because I\ncan't get a rejected so like we go on\nthese dates where I think it's a date\nand they don't think it's a date because\nI don't have the balls to ask him out\nthis is the crap that goes on in my head\nand how did I end up finding a\ngirlfriend I decided to be celibate\nstopped worrying about it focused on\nwhat I can actually control and that's\nthe freaking irony right and there's\nscience to back this stuff up\nthat if you want to attain a flow State\nyou can't be focused on the outcome you\nhave to be focused on the action\nand so it starts with this\nclose your eyes for a moment and just\nrecognize what you are this is it buddy\nthis is all you can control anything\nthat you can feel you can control and\nthink about all the people that you're\nworried about you don't want this person\nto do this you don't want this person to\ndo this I've worked with people who've\nbeen traumatized and they're like oh my\nGod like you know it's terrible right\nbecause you can't control someone if\nyou're in an abusive situation you don't\nnecessarily have the freedom to get out\nof it\nand other people can give you advice\njust leave\nyou can't do that all you can control is\nin here and the real tragedy is even in\nhere is a struggle\nliterally the purpose of HG and why we\nstarted doing this is to help you win\nthe war in here we're not out there\ntelling you to go fix climate change\nwe're not out there good telling you to\ngo fix the economy we're not worried\nabout any of that crap because all of\nthat stuff even if you think about the\nphilosophy of what we're doing here we\ndon't solve The World's problems because\nwe can't I cannot save this Mental\nHealth crisis\nI can't fix climate change I can't do\nany of it\nand yet I wake up every day and I'm\npretty excited about life I'm grateful\nfor life I sometimes get these\nterrifying thoughts of the world that my\nchildren will inherit\ncan't control that what can I do I can\ntry to help I can show up I can make\nthis video I can teach you this\nprinciple I can give you one exercise to\nget started\nand the rest honestly is up to you\nbecause I can't fix you\nright I may be as brilliant or whatever\ntrained here or whatever like studied in\nIndia I cannot fix you\nall I can do is share this with you the\nrest of it is entirely in your ball\ncourt\nand the Buddha for example conquered\nthis problem and it took him like 10\nyears\nI haven't conquered it I learned some of\nit and that took me eight years and the\nstruggle that you have is a hundred\npercent real I do not mean to minimize\nit but if you really want to understand\nhow can you be at peace with the fact\nthat the world is going to hell you be\nat peace because you can't control that\ncrap anyway\nall you can control is yourself and the\ncool thing is that if you start there in\nwhatever this tiniest way that you can\nand it could be something as simple as\nafter you're done with this video you're\ngoing to get up and you're going to take\na shower for the first time in a week or\nyou're going to fix yourself a healthy\nsnack or you're going to open a textbook\nand start studying or you're going to do\nsomething else like and this is what we\ntry to teach you the rest of what we do\nis all about teaching you how to conquer\nyourself\nand the last story that I'm going to\nleave you all with is\nwhen I became a doctor\nI trained at some pretty good places had\namazing teachers and I worked really\nhard\nand\nI can't stop death\nI had patients with cancer\ngot diagnosed can't fix them I'd\nsometimes had patients who were\ntraumatized suicidal I can't fix them\neither I can try but I cannot fix them\nand so the last thing the thing that I'm\nincredibly grateful for is I've been\ngiven a life\nwhere\nthere are times where I've thought that\nI can fix other people and boy did life\nshow me how wrong I was\nand this is the really crazy thing what\nthe really beautiful thing about working\nwith a patient who's terminally ill is\nwhen you share this philosophy with them\nthey can find peace with death\nthey can find peace with okay this is\nactually out of my control I cannot\ncontrol whether I live or die\nand so what I'm going to do is just live\nevery day to the fullest\nand that's what I'm encouraging you all\nto do I completely agree that the world\nis going to hell there's Despair and\nhopelessness all over the place there's\nclimate change inflammation you know\nrelationships are getting screwed the\neconomy is getting screwed the oceans\nare getting screwed everything's getting\nscrewed and you can't do anything about\nthat\nwhat can you do\nclose your eyes make a fist put your\narms together feel that because that's\nall you can control and once you start\nfocusing on that\nfingers crossed the solution that worked\nfor Arjun the solution that worked for\nBuddha and the solution that has worked\nfor hundreds of people that I've taught\nit to will work for you too but hey\nhere's the crazy thing you say but what\nif it doesn't work I can't control\nwhether it works and you can't control\nwhether it works the only thing that's\nimportant is whether you try"
