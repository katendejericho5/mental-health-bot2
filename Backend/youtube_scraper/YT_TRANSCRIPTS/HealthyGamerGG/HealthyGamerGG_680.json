    "transcript": "so as a doctor right I can go to work\nand I can do a really good job and I can\ntry my hardest but I can't necessarily\nsave a life and that's what's so tricky\nis that when we work really hard we\nthink oh I deserve to save this life or\nI did everything that they could why\nisn't this person living it's just not\nhow it works so medicine teaches you how\nto walk that tightrope really well which\nis that in this life all you can do is\nlike control your actions but you can't\ncontrol how anyone else responds and the\nreally beautiful thing about this is as\nyou start to really focus on what you're\ndoing instead of expecting other people\nto behave in alignment with what you\nwant it actually frees up a ton of brain\nspace because instead of worrying about\nhow this other person is going to behave\nand how can I get them to do this and\nhow can I make sure I get promoted\ninstead of worrying about all this that\nkind of stuff I'm going to focus on my\nwork I'm going to focus on what makes me\nhappy I'm going to focus on how I want\nto live this life and if these people\nwant to recognize it the value in that\nthat's fine if they don't want to\nrecognize the value in it why do I want\nto waste my time being upset that\nsomeone doesn't recognize my value that\ndoesn't help me at all"
