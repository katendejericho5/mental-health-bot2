    "transcript": "today I'd like to teach y'all how to\nfollow through\n[Music]\nbecause if we look at the world there\nare two groups of people there are\npeople who are disciplined and there are\npeople who are lazy and the disciplined\npeople have a bunch of willpower so when\nthey set their mind to something they\nkind of focus on it stick with it day\nafter day they're kind of exercising\nevery day eating healthy every day and\nthey're able to actually follow through\nand then there's the rest of us who get\nreally excited about stuff but\ninevitably end up getting less excited\nabout it and while we may order a bunch\nof equipment like I'm gonna order a\nguitar and I'm going to order all these\nlike classes or books or whatever or I'm\ngoing to learn how to code or I'm going\nto Garden like whatever the task is I'm\ngoing to start doing yoga I'm gonna\norder a yoga mat and incense and all\nthis kind of stuff eventually we'll sort\nof get bored of it right and even in\nthat process we'll sort of start to use\nwillpower so the Mind naturally wants to\nyeah the mind doesn't want to do yoga\ntoday and then what we'll do is we'll\nuse our willpower to overcome it and\nthen we get engage in a war with our\nmind that we may win on some days right\nso you're like yeah I want to learn yoga\ntoday I don't feel like it but I'm gonna\nforce myself hey there thanks for\nwatching and I'm glad these videos have\nbeen helpful a lot of times I'll read\nthe comments and see people asking well\nwhat do I actually do about it which is\nsuch a great question and unfortunately\nmy experience has been that the\nresources out there aren't actually that\ngood at helping people create\nsustainable change which is why I\nstarted HG in the first place he coaches\nare trained on a curriculum that\nintegrates all of my understanding into\nwhat is motivation what paralyzes Us and\nhow to create lasting behavioral change\nso if you're ready to take the next step\nhe coaches are ready to build the life\nthat you want they've helped people\nbuild careers find relationships build\nnetworks of friends discover what their\npassions are and pursue their Hobbies so\nif this sounds like something that you'd\nbe interested in check out the link in\nthe description below as the days go by\nthe number of days you can kind of force\nyourself to do it start to decline and\nbefore you know it you take that guitar\nyou take that yoga mat you take those\nbooks that you order that you were going\nto to read and they joined the graveyard\nof other things that you used to be\nexcited about but now you don't do\nanymore so in order to overcome this in\norder to understand how to follow\nthrough I'm going to teach y'all a\ntechnique that actually makes it easy\nand the key problem is that we don't\nreally understand how our mind works and\nsecondly that we try to overcome our\nmind right because that's what willpower\nis the Mind wants to do one thing but we\nuse willpower to overcome that and force\nit into doing something else so instead\nwhat we're going to do today is learn\nthe natural tendencies of the mind and\nactually use the natural direction of\nthe mind to follow through and one thing\nthat I want you all to pay attention to\nis the tendency of your mind to switch\noff of this video as best as you can\nstick with it and make it to the end of\nthe video but if you get the urge to\nswitch off the way that you manage that\nurge will actually be really really\nimportant data that will sort of prove\nthe point and really teach you how to\nuse this principle in order to get\nstarted we have to understand two things\nabout the mind the first is that the\nmind is very very curious and likes to\nengage with new things which I'm sure\nyou understand right so these new things\nwhether it's new TV shows or even like\nlearning particular instruments or\nwhatever it gets excited about that\nstuff and once it gets excited if it\nengages with that stuff there may be\nsome kind of dopamine release or\nsomething like that the second thing to\nunderstand about the mind is that it\ndevelops tolerance to any kind of\nstimuli so this is something that you\ncan understand very simply by like when\nyou put on your shirt in the morning you\nfeel the shirt when you first put it on\nbut then you acclimatize to it right\neven when you go into something like a\npublic restroom it smells really bad for\nthe first few seconds that you're there\nbut the longer you stay in the restroom\nthe more tolerable the scent becomes and\nthis also happens with dopaminergic\nstuff so the first bite of let's say\nlike a piece of cake that you eat or the\nsecond or third bite may be really\nreally tasty but as you eat more bites\nof a piece of cake or a piece of pizza\nthe enjoyment starts to decline and we\nsee that of course with technology and I\nwas like addicted to video games at some\npoint point I would play a particular\nvideo game for six hours eight hours and\nthen I noticed I didn't even enjoy it\nanymore so I would switch to a different\nvideo game and that's the problem right\nyou decided that you wanted to do\nsomething but then your mind is like\nyeah I'm bored of this so what I'm going\nto teach you is instead of overcoming\nthat tendency of the Mind overcoming the\nCuriosity and tolerance of the mind\nwe're actually going to use the tendency\nof the mind to be bored to actually help\nus follow through which may sound\nimpossible but this is actually like\nsort of an evidence-based technique that\nworks in addiction Psychiatry what we're\ngoing to learn how to do today is urge\nsurf so urge surfing is a technique that\nwe use in addiction Psychiatry to help\npeople withstand the Cravings to\nsubstances that they're addicted to so\nI've used this very successfully in\npeople who are addicted to things like\nalcohol and heroin and cocaine and the\ngeneral principle is that if we look at\nthe Mind\nurges or Cravings arise but if we're\nable to tolerate that for some amount of\ntime if were able to surf on top of the\nurge instead of give in to it over time\nthat urge will actually go away and just\nthink about it for a second right so our\nmind develops tolerance to particular\nthings and gets bored of stuff so if you\nhave a particular urge or craving over\ntime the mind will get bored of the urge\nor craving if you don't give in so you\nmay want like let's say a piece of pizza\nbut if you can't get it let's say you're\non an airplane and you want a fresh\npiece of pizza that you can't get a\nfresh piece of pizza on an airplane so\nyour mind wants the pizza for a little\nwhile but do you spend six hours of a\nflight wanting that pizza over and over\nand over again of course not your mind\nnaturally develops a tolerance to its\nown craving and then it'll shift to\nsomething else and Cravings can be\nincredibly incredibly intense so I'm not\nsaying that this is easy but this is\nliterally a technique that we can use in\npeople whose brains are addicted to a\nsubstance so their whole brain is\naligned towards wanting this thing and\nand that's the only satisfaction that\ntheir brain is interested in and yet\nurge surfing works so paradoxically all\nwe're going to do when we urge surf is\nfirst of all notice that you have the\ndesire for something and let's say this\nis what's kind of interesting is if I'm\ntrying to follow through with one task\nwhat we really need to recognize is the\ndesire to switch is a craving in and of\nitself and so here's the thing to\nunderstand when we're talking about\nfollow-through what our mind essentially\ndoes is develop tolerance to the current\nactivity and then craves a different\nactivity so if we sort of think about\nwhat follow through or why follow\nthrough is difficult it's not so much\nthat staying on task is hard the real\nchallenges that our mind desires\nsomething else and I invite you to just\nthink about that for a second when you\nare struggling with following through so\nit's not just that okay I started\nreading this book and it's hard to read\nit but the question is why is it hard to\nread it's because your mind would rather\ndo other things oh watching a TV show or\nchecking something on social media or\nlooking at memes or or texting a friend\nor playing a video game or watching\npornography there are all kinds of other\nthings that your mind craves rather than\nfinishing the book so we really need to\nunderstand is that our minds difficulty\nwith following through actually has to\ndo with cravings for other things and\nthe way that we manage those Cravings is\nthrough urge surfing so anytime that\nyour mind wants to switch that'll feel\nlike a craving and then what we want you\nto do is surf on top of it right so\nnotice the urge arise within you notice\nthe desire for your mind to do this do\nthat do all those kinds of other things\nand you may your mind wants you to give\nin to it it'll tell you all kinds of\nthings it'll say things like oh this is\nboring it's a waste of time we'll do it\ntomorrow it'll use all kinds of\ndifferent dialogue to try to trick you\nbut underneath all of that dialogue is a\ncraving a craving for something else a\ncraving for dopamine and so what we want\nyou to do is just surf on top of that\nurge notice the craving and just don't\ngive in to it right what we're asking\nyou to do remember that following going\nthrough is about doing something\nconsistently but what y'all may be way\nbetter at is doing nothing right that's\nso much easier to do it's not actually\nbecause resisting a craving is difficult\nbut some of us are pretty good at doing\nnothing we're pretty good at\nprocrastinating and that's what urge\nsurfing really is no Cravings will last\nforever that's a natural tendency of the\nmind that no feelings will last forever\nso Joy from your wedding day does not\nlast a lifetime Joy from graduating does\nnot last a lifetime the Heartbreak from\na breakup or getting dumped thankfully\ndoes not last for a lifetime and if we\nsurf on that urge what we'll find over\ntime is that our mind will get bored of\nwanting something and then instead of\nfollowing through on Switching tasks our\nmind will naturally return to the thing\nthat we want to do and so paradoxically\nthe best way to follow through if you\nhave if you struggle with like willpower\ndiscipline have low conscientiousness is\nto just surf on top of the urge just\nsort of tolerate that craving and then\nkind of return back to the task so there\nare a couple of things to consider the\nfirst is that some of y'all may be\nsaying okay well but my Cravings are\nreally really powerful and this won't\nwork for me because my Cravings are\nreally really powerful it's so hard to\ndo so notice what your mind is doing\nright there right instead of actually\ntrying the technique or even starting\nwith something small what does your mind\ndo it uses the one case where you're\ndestined to fail and it sort of says no\nno don't even try this right because\ndon't even try this it's not going to\nwork notice what your mind is doing it's\neven resisting the desire to try it and\nthat's what the Mind does when you\nactually stumble upon a technique that\nwill work with the mind what it'll do is\ntry to convince you as best as possible\nto not engage in it the next thing to\nconsider is that you don't have to start\nwith the biggest craving right because\nthat's not what your mind says your mind\njust talks about the scenarios in which\nthis won't work it doesn't say oh yeah\nthis may work for 25 of our Cravings\nthis may work for may help us follow\nthrough 25 more what the Mind naturally\njumps to when it doesn't want to do\nsomething is the scenarios in which\nyou'll fail and the other thing to\nunderstand about urge surfing is it is a\nskill that is to be built up over time\nso even if you think that your Cravings\nare way too powerful and I get you right\nI worked with a bunch of people who have\nreally strong Cravings I've struggled\nwith them myself there are some Cravings\nthat may be too hard to handle you don't\nhave to handle those let's just focus on\nthe 25 that you can handle and the last\nthing is if you've made it to this point\nin the video I want to invite you all to\npay attention to your desires to switch\noff of the video I would bet that\nchances are over the course of this\nvideo at some point your mind wanted to\nswitch off and notice how long that\nimpulse lasted so have you been\nstruggling has this whole video been\nsort of a a long-term struggle with the\ndesire to switch off this video If you\nreally pay attention what you've\nactually already done is urge surf\nyou've already had cravings to switch\noff to something else maybe\npull out your phone or maybe you did\npull out your phone and what you'll\nnotice is so I invite you to kind of pay\nattention to how you made it to the end\nof this video because chances are you\nnotice the craving the craving arose and\nthen the craving actually melted away\nand that's urge surfing and if you've\nmade it this far you've already done it\nso all you need to do is just apply what\nyou've already done today to the other\ndimensions of your life\nforeign"
