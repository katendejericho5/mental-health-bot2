    "transcript": "so what does boredom actually boredom is\na stimulation seeking emotional state so\nour mind has figured out hey if we're\nnot getting the stimulation that we want\nwhat I'm going to do is make this person\nfeel bored and once they start to feel\nbored we are going to seek some kind of\nexternal simulation which will then\nrelieve the board up furthermore if\nwe're getting stimulated from the\noutside what we're going to be doing is\nsuppressing all of our internal signals\nand this is where if you want to start\nlistening to your internal voice what\nyou actually need to do is Stop drowning\nit out from the outside so the thoughts\nin our mind come from two places they\ncan either come from our sensory organs\nor something like internally memory or\nthings like that so if you kind of think\nabout you know what are you excited\nabout today are you excited about seeing\na particular movie or playing a\nparticular game or eating a particular\nfood how did you have that excitement\nwhere did that thought come from chances\nare it came from a sensory organ and as\nlong as we are being bombarded by the\nsensory organs it's going to be very\nhard for our internal thoughts to\nactually arise"
