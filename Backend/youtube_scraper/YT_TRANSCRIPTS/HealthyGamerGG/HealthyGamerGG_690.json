something\nnope\nchat box is busted okay\nhold on wait a minute\nall right whatever\nwelcome to another healthy gamer GG\nstream my name is Olive canoji just a\nreminder that although I'm a\npsychiatrist nothing we discussed on\nstream today is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly\nand um so I know that we oftentimes\nstream on Twitch today we're streaming\non YouTube because we've done a couple\nof different weed streams on Twitch and\ntoday we figure we'd talk to y'all over\nat YouTube\nso hope you all are doing well welcome\neverybody we've got like tons of\nquestions\nso\num how you all doing today\ny'all doing good\nit's fully legal and and yeah we're live\nstreaming today so we're going to talk\nto your questions about stream I mean\nabout weed uh so we've got some\nquestions that we people have like\ntweeted at us some really common\nquestions that people have so we're\ngoing to take a look at some of those\nbut if you all have questions and stuff\num\nuh you know feel free to ask them do I\nneed to smoke to watch this probably not\nyou know that's that's a good question\ngood question\num\nand you know someone saying I'm high\nright now I'm not surprised some people\nuse marijuana that is that is correct\ny'all are correct good morning doing\ngreat y'all y'all doing good\nokay\num so y'all want to hang for a little\nbit you all want to dive right into the\nquestions\nwhat do y'all think\nlet me see\num\nare you Dr Kush I don't think so but you\nknow someone did recently\nit's kind of funny\nsomeone sent me a link\nwhen when they found out that I was\nstreaming about weed apparently there is\na Dr K stream of weed there's a stream\nthere's a strain of weed called Dr k\num it's called Dr K OG and it it has\nnothing to do with us but apparently the\nK and Dr kog stands for Dr Kevorkian\nand I was just really surprised because\nI was like wait what is this is someone\nis someone branding a weed product for\nus\num hang on for like okay okay I'm while\nyou guys are saying hang on I'm gonna\nsee something real quick\ndoes this twitch chat come up\nlet me started the the YouTube chat okay\nit doesn't look it looks like it doesn't\ncome up okay let me see how I can get\nokay we're gonna troubleshoot for a\nsecond chat\num\nso this is okay so he said this is what\nI need to do so go to YouTube\nand then\nlet's see if I can figure this out\nhealthy gamer GE\nand then we're live streaming\nand then YouTube is playing an ad nice\nand then what I'm going to do is pop out\nchat\nokay\nand then\nI'm gonna go give me a second chat\nbecause I want you all to be able to see\nthe chat\nokay so then we're gonna do this\nand then we're gonna do\noh no it's working\noh wow okay okay it worked it worked it\nworked it worked chat\nokay\num let me see if does this one work\nokay it sort of works\nthere it goes well\nokay what is this one\nokay\nso let's just okay all right so sorry\nabout that chat let's get started\nso let's Dive In\num I am working on this\nlet's start let's just start at the top\nchat\nokay\nso\nwhy do people say weed isn't addictive\neven when someone oh hold on y'all can't\nsee this\nBoomer okay\nwhy do people say weed isn't addictive\neven when someone has an obvious\ndependency not asking to instigate if it\ncomes off that way I've witnessed weed\ndependency and I have a pretty bad\nreaction to weed myself but I know it's\npretty helpful to others I don't think\nit's a cure-all though and I've I've\nJust Seen A lot of people say something\nlike X month sober and it's weed and it\nseems to rub some smokers the wrong way\nis it a science thing or maybe an issue\nof wording so let's understand something\nabout weed dependency okay and can you\nget addicted or not\nso in order to understand why there's\nconfusion here we have to start with two\nconcepts of addiction\nso the first concept of addiction that\nwe're talking about is\nsomething called physiologic tolerance\nand dependence so there are sub Subs all\nsubstances when you start to use them we\nwill develop some degree of physiologic\ntolerance to them okay\nso if we think about caffeine for\nexample the first time you have caffeine\nit'll completely wire you but if you\nhave caffeine every day your body\ndevelops tolerance to it and then you\nkind of become dependent on it what does\nthat mean that means that in the absence\nof caffeine you will experience\nwithdrawal because your body is used to\nthat substance\nfloating around and when it's no longer\nthere your body kind of like craves that\nsubstance\nso in some cases this physiologic\ndependence can be like very profound and\nvery damaging so in the case of alcohol\nuse dependence or benzodiazepine which\nare these drugs like Lorazepam or Valium\nXanax\ndiazepam things like that\nthis tolerance that we can develop can\nbe so profound that in the absence of\nthe substance it can actually induce\nseizures so what tends to happen is that\nonce we use a lot of substance like\nwe're getting a high signal so what our\nbrain kind of does is turns down the\nvolume on that signal and then in the\nabsence of that\nthere's sort of like a withdrawal\nexperience that you have so what tends\nto happen with weed is that we don't see\na whole lot of physiologic Tolerance but\nyou can develop some physiologic\ntolerance so generally speaking\nwithdrawal from weed is not as severe as\nlet's say opioids or alcohol\nand since the withdrawal is not as\nsevere it is sometimes actually\ncompletely absent in some people people\nwill say you can't get addicted to weed\nbecause they're talking about the\nphysiological tolerance there is\nevidence by the way that there's some\nphysiologic tolerance that people who\nchronically use weed and the absence of\nweed will develop things like\nirritability and anxiety and stuff like\nthat in the worst case scenarios I've\nseen you can even get something called\ncyclic vomiting syndrome which I I tend\nto see almost exclusively with heavy\nmarijuana users so but a lot of people\ndon't experience a whole lot of\nphysiologic Tolerance and it's generally\nspeaking not life-threatening so that's\nwhy people say you can't get addicted\nI absolutely believe that people can can\nget addicted to weed even without the\nphysiologic tolerance because there's\nalso a psychological dependence\nso what this sort of means is some\npeople who use weed use it because it\nallows them to function right so if I I\ncan't go to a party without being high\nbecause I have such bad social anxiety I\nhave difficulty falling asleep without\nweed I need weed to relax I need weed to\nhave fun it's hard for me to enjoy\nmyself in the absence of weed and so\nwhen we see a lot of heavy usage or\nwe'll get to what heavy is but when we\nsee a lot of usage what we tend to see\nis that there are some people who almost\nrequire weed to be able to engage in\nlife in in a sort of like normal or even\nenjoyable way there's absolutely that\npsychological dependence\nand when we talk about addiction what is\nsort of the threshold of addiction\ngenerally speaking if the substance\nimpairs your function\nand you cannot stop that's what\nconstitutes addiction\nso if marijuana is negatively impacting\nmy relationships if it's negatively\nimpacting my physical health my mental\nhealth my ability to do school if it's\nnegatively impacting like professional\nthings\nand despite the fact that it's\nnegatively impacting me if you are not\nable to stop and this is where you got\nto be a little bit tricky right because\nyou may be able to tell yourself that\nyou are able to stop but if you don't\nactually stop and it's causing damage to\nyour life then that sort of qualifies as\nan addiction\nand so I think marijuana can absolutely\nbe addictive and the some of the\nconfusion around it is simply because it\ndoesn't develop the same kind of\nphysiologic Tolerance that other\nsubstances do now this person was also\ntalking a little bit about okay like\nwhen I talk to people\nwho are\nwho are weed smokers and then you use\nsome words like X month sober it seems\nto rub smokers the wrong way yeah I mean\nsometimes you run into all kinds of\npsychological defense mechanisms like\ndenial and like you know all kinds of\nother stuff like they get rubbed the\nwrong way because if you're sober it\nimplies they're not sober it implies\nthey have a problem they know they have\na problem but they're trying really hard\nto be in denial so if anyone says\nsomething that sort of challenges that\ndenial they'll push back against you\nreally hard right and and so if you kind\nof think about it like why is it so\nimportant for some people who use weed\nto convince you that it's not a problem\nand this is where you know I quote the\nfamous Bard Shakespeare me da think he\nor she protesteth too much\nand so oftentimes in Psychiatry when we\nsee that when I kind of see that\nsomeone's like trying really hard to\nconvince the world\nthat it's not addictive that speaks more\nto their psychology and potentially even\ntheir dependence\nthan otherwise now it doesn't mean that\nthere aren't you know people out there\nwho are making good arguments which\nwe'll get to later on about you know why\nmarijuana maybe should be legal or can\nbe used medicinally and things like that\nbut just something to consider okay\nokay\nwheat is a gateway drug\num so I saw most posts saying that weed\nisn't a gateway drug alcohol is and so\nforth as if wheat is this like holy\nthing sent by God blah blah blah so\nlet's talk about whether weed is a\ngateway drug or not\nso\nthere is good evidence that weed is a\ngateway drug okay and let's understand\nhow it's a a gateway drug why it's a\ngateway drug and why we kind of believe\nthat okay actually let me ask you a\nquick question do you all want iPad do\nyou guys want like bullet points and\nstuff or you all just want to talk\nwhat do y'all think\nyay no\nuh\num what do y'all think\nokay let's do it give me a second then\nso I'm gonna load this up and then let's\ndo it\nyou know what's hilarious\nyo honey you want to hear something\nhilarious\nso\nright now we are streaming on YouTube\nso in order to stream on YouTube\nI opened up YouTube to try to get the\nchat box and boy the ads that are being\npopulated on my screen are hilarious\nchat\nokay so let's do this\ncan I just show you this real quick\nso I don't even know what this ad is for\nbut this is too this is too funny\nwe have a weed stream right you guys\nwant to see how brilliant YouTube is\nlook at this guy\nthis is the dude\nthis is what I see on an ad for like\nit's like how on Earth does YouTube even\nknow\nthis is brilliant\nokay and hey what happened to the chat\nbox\ndid we lose this\nbra\noh there it is okay y'all see it now\nokay\nokay so let's do this oh\nfail chat fail okay so weed is a gateway\ndrug so a lot of people will wonder is\nweed a gateway drug yay or nay so let's\nunderstand this okay\nso in my opinion weed is absolutely a\ngateway drug so how do we know this I\nbase this on three things the first oh\nblue okay let's let's stick with it is\nthere a things called epidemiologic\nstudies\nso an epidemiologic study\nis when we just look at populations and\nwe survey them\nso if we take two groups of people\nhere's group number one here's group\nnumber two and group number one is\nsmoking a joint\nokay there's smoke in a joint and then\nwhat happens is if we go three years in\nthe future\nwhat is the likelihood that this these\npeople will use more drugs\nit's higher okay whereas these people\nuse less drugs so if you look at like\npopulations this population studies so\nif you take like let's say 4 000 people\nwho use pot three years later are they\nmore likely to use additional drugs\nharder drugs than people who don't smoke\npot the answer is yes okay so on the\nglobal population level it appears that\nmarijuana usage is associated with\nincreased drug use later in life okay by\nthe way the percentage of people who use\nmarijuana in the last 12 months is about\n18 okay\nbut the thing about an epidemiologic\nstudy is that an epidemiologic study is\nnot causative so there could be\nsomething like there's a counter\nargument to this which is that okay if\nsomeone is using pot in the first place\nmaybe they have a home life that is more\ntraumatic maybe they have a pre-existing\nanxiety disorder maybe there's something\ngoing on in their life that is leading\nto the pot usage that independently\nleads to more drug usage right so if I\nhave bad anxiety maybe I drink and I\nsmoke pot\nbut it turns out that we have actually\nsome evidence that\nmarijuana usage has a causative factor\nfor additional drugs and there are two\nmajor mechanisms\nthe first is when we use marijuana in\nadolescence\nespecially\nit Alters\nour brain\nchemistry around dopamine\nand so what it actually does is it makes\nour brain more sensitive\nto\nor it predisposes our brain to be more\nvulnerable\nto The Addictive effects of additional\ndrugs okay and some of this is also has\ngenetic components to it okay depending\non what kind of you know genes you've\ngot\nbut basically what happens is when we we\nuse marijuana while our brain is\ndeveloping it Alters our dopamine\nchemistry and that alteration to\ndopamine chemistry makes us more\nvulnerable\nto\nusing additional drugs okay\nthe second way that marijuana\nis sort of a gateway drug is if we think\nabout marijuana what does marijuana do\nmarijuana makes things more fun right so\nif we think about it right like let's\njust be honest so like marijuana makes\nlike playing certain video games more\nfun it makes food taste better it makes\nmusic more enjoyable it enhances the\nexperience of other normal things okay\nsexual activity and so the other thing\nthat people have discovered is that when\nyou use marijuana other drugs that you\nuse with marijuana can be enhanced in\ncertain ways so the benefit that you get\nfrom using additional drugs while you\nuse marijuana as well can enhance the\nbenefit that you get and the more that\nyou enhance the benefit of other drugs\nthe more likely you are to be dependent\non them so question number two\nreally simple\nis weed a gateway drug\nanswer is\nyes\nokay\nokay\nwhat is considered heavy marijuana use\nfor you guys okay so this is I guess on\non a weed related subreddit but let's\ntalk about heavy use normal use people\nalso have questions about you know is\nthere a safe amount of marijuana to use\nso let's talk about this\nso there is some evidence that marijuana\ncan be safely used without problems\nthat evidence is\nin some ways pretty substantial and in\nsome ways preliminary\nthe reason I say that it's kind of both\nof those things is for a long time we\nweren't doing research on marijuana\nand so when we weren't doing research on\nmarijuana as a safe substance and we\nwere just looking at it as a substance\nof abuse so we were doing research on\nmarijuana addiction for like 50 years we\nweren't you looking at it the normal\nusage because you couldn't study it\nright and so what happens when you do a\nbunch of studies on addiction is you see\nyou're selecting the addicted population\nto begin with and so it skews your\nanswers\nso now that we're having more evidence\nit seems that there are a fair number of\npeople I'm not really sure what it is\nthe evidence is kind of preliminary on\nthe percentages\nthat can use marijuana somewhat safely\nso if you look at like marijuana\naddiction it may be somewhere between\nseven and nine percent and if you look\nat the number of people who have used it\nin the last\n12 months it's like 18 on average in the\nUnited States\nand and so\nyou can kind of say that okay like maybe\nabout half of people or probably\nhonestly more than half of people is my\nguess can use marijuana safely now what\ndo I think is a safe amount of use this\nis what's also interesting so on this is\nwhat's kind of tricky is people will ask\nthese questions what is a safe amount of\nmarijuana that I can use\nand that's where like there is not a\nsafe amount of marijuana because this is\nweird people are different\nso for some people like if you ask what\nis a safe amount of alcohol to use for\nsome people the safe amount of alcohol\nto use is zero ever for the rest of your\nlife\nthere was a long time where where\nmedical sort of expertise was like two\ndrinks a week are okay more than that is\nwhen you start to have problems the\nWorld Health Organization recently\nreleased somewhat of a politically\ncharged I don't really think it's\npolitically charged but it has that\neffect\num bulletin saying that actually no\namount of alcohol usage is safe which I\nthink is probably correct\nand if we're really talking about\nmarijuana that is probably the most\ncorrect answer is that no amount is safe\nand at the same time for a lot of people\nworking as a psychiatrist I've worked\nwith a lot of people and also like you\nknow I have colleagues and stuff who\nwill use marijuana and I think if you\nuse like once a week or maybe once every\nother week like it's probably not going\nto cause too many problems but this is\nwhere the really tricky thing is that we\nknow that whether a certain amount is\nsafe or unsafe is really highly\nindividualistic\nand and what we know is that for example\nthere are some genetic variants that are\nvariants your neurotransmitters and\nreceptors and things like The receptors\nreally not neurotransmitters that will\nmake even a small amount pretty unsafe\nand so that's really a conversation that\nyou need to have with like someone who's\nan expert and it's really highly\ncustomized and that's what's so\nfrustrating about these questions is you\nall want to know\nis it safe or not safe and this is why\nI'm sort of saying to y'all even though\nit may upset you it depends and why am I\nsaying it depends because\nhalf y'all watching out there are\nlooking for me to say it's safe\nhappy all out there may be dependent on\nmarijuana and if Dr K says it's safe hey\nthat's the green light that's what your\ndenial needs hey Dr K said it was safe\nsee I knew it was safe I'm using it\nevery day\nand it's okay right I'm different so I\nwould say that if you're using marijuana\non a daily basis that is almost\ncertainly problematic almost certainly\nis my guess\nand so if you're looking for me to like\nfor license to use I'm not going to give\nit to you all I hate to say it\nokay\num\nand at the same time like as we get more\nand more data I I'm guessing that we'll\ndiscover that once weekly usage or once\nevery other week is probably going to be\nsafe is my guess\nokay\nall right let's keep going\nall right and the other thing to think\nabout is like when we see posts like\nthis what is considered a heavy\nmarijuana usage for you guys\num\nyou know and it's like what someone\nlooking for right are they looking for\nlike license to continue using are they\nreally going to cut back like I'm not\nreally sure so I think you just got to\nbe careful about what's driving a\nquestion so if you find yourself asking\na lot of these questions like hey what's\na safe amount to use what's a heavy\namount to use like what are you looking\nfor like are you looking for some kind\nof license\nfor your behavior and if the answer that\nquestion is yes then you need to be\nsuper careful because here's what's kind\nof tricky about\nthe the mind is that\nthe mind will sometimes\nif you're if you're addicted\nto something\nwhat the mind is looking for is a\nrationalization for you to continue\nusing\nand so it's kind of interesting because\nwhy are you asking this question as\nopposed to a different kind of question\nright and I'm not saying that the\nquestion that can't be a good question\nbut you've got to be super careful about\nthe addictive mind because sometimes\nit'll shape the questions that you ask\nand it's sort of creating like a rigged\nsystem\nso in science when we do surveys on\npeople we will like validate the\nquestions before we ask them so we'll do\na lot of psychometrics on surveys before\nwe ask a question because the way that\nyou ask a question can influence the\nanswer\nand what I see in a lot of people who\nhave like kind of subclinical or like\ndenial addictions is that they'll ask\nrigged questions because they're looking\nfor particular answers and once your\nbrain once the addictive part of your\nmind is looking for an answer that gives\nyou license to use then you've got to be\nsuper careful okay if y'all want another\nexample of this by the way\nso how does the addictive mind work\nso my favorite version of The Addictive\nmind is\nI can quit anytime I want\nokay so now version one of the addictive\nmind is I can quit anytime I want\ncool right it's not a problem\nand then what we sort of know is that if\nyou're in denial since I can quit\nanytime I want\nI don't need to quit I'm in control\ntherefore I can keep using that's layer\none okay Of The Addictive mind\nI can quit I'm in control\nLayer Two this is when things get really\ntricky\nI can quit anytime I want and I'm aware\nthat if I don't actually demonstrate the\ncontrol then I have a problem so I'm\ngoing to quit for two weeks\nand even then the addictive mind is like\nah yes we're gonna quit for two weeks\nand since we're able to quit for two\nweeks now we can use every day because\nnow we have proof that we're in control\nso there's a subtle layer of the\naddictive mind that will\ntest you\nand give you proof that you're in\ncontrol\nand then you may ask yourself the\nquestion well hold on a second\nhow do you know that that this is really\nnot control right how do you decide and\nThat's Where It's Tricky why did you\npick two weeks where did that number\ncome from\nso the addictive mind will pick the\nnumber that it knows that you can\naccomplish to trick you into thinking\nthat you're in control it didn't pick\ntwo years\nright y'all see that\ngotta watch out for the addictive mind\nIt's Tricky\nright so the the game that it's playing\nis rigged\nokay next\nI'm a very motivated person\nalways a go-getter I make lists every\nday and love Crossing completed items\npretty much OCD with lists I got a uni\ndegree I and I got a job marijuana has\nhelped me create and then reach these\ngoals and dreams but I am an addict no\nway around it I'm not sure whether it is\nhelping me while I'm doing my errands\ncertainly works as a reward after but\ndon't have the willpower to wait my\nspecific example is working on cars\nexercising making money outside of my\nday job I'm restoring an old Corvette\nand my daily driver needs serious work\nit has been dragging on for weeks things\nI have no desire to work on them without\nbeing high and having fun while doing it\nthis parallels with most tasks actually\nso weed keeps me productive but then\nagain how productive am I being I'll get\nhigh\nI'll get high work on it a bit then\nwander off next thing I know I'm\nwatching TV shows on my computer before\nthe sun goes down I would like to hear\nanybody else's experience with Camden\ncannabis coupled with productive\nenergetic mind\nso this is also really common this is\nsomething that I think is not talked\nabout often enough\nthat if we really look at it a lot of\npeople\nwill say that marijuana helps their\nproductivity\nand I\nI agree that people have the perception\nthat it helps their productivity and\nthat it does in a lot of ways help their\nproductivity so let's understand\nhow marijuana can help productivity\noh whoops\nokay\nokay so a lot of people will say\nmarijuana actually helps my productivity\nand I agree\nso up\nso let's take a look at why how\nmarijuana can help productivity and why\nit's a problem so the first thing is\nthis person acknowledged that they're\naddicted but it kind of helps them so\nthey're sort of stuck\nand this is the first problem with\nmarijuana is that it makes things easier\nwith weed\nwhich in turn\nmeans that without weed\nit's harder\nso anytime the mind is faced with these\ntwo decisions it's always going to pick\nthe easy path right like\nwhen there's an easy way to do things\nand a hard way to do things like our\nbrain is going to choose the easier one\nand so then what happens is we're sort\nof addicted to easiness\nnow how can Marijuana make us more\nproductive\nthere are a couple of things to consider\nthe first is that sometimes we have\nsomething for which marijuana has a\ntherapeutic benefit so let's say someone\nhas anxiety or chronic pain\nand if I have anxiety or chronic pain or\nI have insomnia\nwe're going to talk about weed and sleep\nlater\nthese things will result in a decrease\nin productivity\nso if I have weed\nand I actually reduce these things\ninhibit these things what that sort of\nmeans is that I inhibit my loss of\nproductivity and then I ended up being\nmore productive\nright so if I've got chronic pain and\nit's hard for me to focus on work and I\nget high and it reduces my chronic pain\nthat makes it easier for me to work and\nlet's be honest this is what medicine\ndoes right this is the point of medicine\nthe point of medicine is hey if you've\ngot anxiety we can give you anti-anxiety\nmedication so that you can function\nnormally and you can get a net benefit\nto your function\nyou all got that\nso this is where some people can\nexperience\nthat marijuana can help them with their\nproductivity\nthe third thing that can sometimes make\nmarijuana help with productivity\nis that a lot of the things that are\nproductive\nare not fun\nright so we've got two options so even\nif we think about the we have different\nwords for productive and fun they're not\nthe same word the activities\nfundamentally aren't the same\nwhen we're saying hey I'm playing video\ngames I'm being productive no I'm having\nfun these are two fundamentally\ndifferent things and we separate them so\nthe really cool thing about marijuana is\nthat what it does is moves things that\nare this category into this category and\nthis category of things is easy to do\nright\nit's fun\nmakes it easier\nso we tend to find is that marijuana\nmakes certain activities more enjoyable\nand when marijuana makes activities more\nenjoyable like stuff that's boring then\ncan kind of become more fun\nso if marijuana makes you more\nproductive I can see a lot of reasons\nwhy it would do that I still think it's\na huge problem\nand why is that\nit's because\neven though this kind of makes things in\ngood in the short term so if we kind of\nlook at our productivity\nokay\nso let's say this is kind of Baseline so\nsome of us are operating kind of down\nhere let's say I have anxiety so my\nproductivity is problematic and if I\nlook at what we does weed will elevate\nit to maybe over here\nokay but then the problem is if we look\nat someone who starts over here what's\ngoing to happen if they smoke marijuana\nit's going to bring them down here\nso the problem with using weed for\nproductivity\nis that you we you will never go above\nthis line\nthat's the problem and if you look at\nother treatments for anxiety so let's\nsay that I use like you know\nPsychotherapy or cognitive behavioral\ntherapy or I do sleep training or\nwhatever for insomnia insomnia is a huge\none by the way because if you don't get\na good night's sleep it's really hard to\nwork\nright so if you use Alternatives you can\nget up here\nso when people say that it helps their\nproductivity I think this is the effect\nthat weed will have on productivity and\nif your Baseline is high it'll lower it\nif your Baseline is low it can\nabsolutely help in the short term\nbut it caps how high you can go it\nlimits your ceiling\nnow it is important to mention that I\ngotta be honest with you all I've seen\nsome situations\nvery specific situations in which I have\nseen weed\ndo this\nokay and substances of abuse\nand the one situation in which I've seen\nthis happen tends to be with creatives\nand I wish I could say that some amount\nof meditation yogic training learning\nhow to live your life Etc will help you\nget here without weed\nand I do think that all of those things\nwhen I work with creatives that's what\nwe try to do but just to be completely\nhonest with y'all based on the\nexperiences of these people they have\ntold me in no uncertain terms even after\nperiods of sobriety and meditating and\ndoing yoga and doing diet and all this\nkind of stuff doing Psychotherapy with\nme for like two years they will still\ntell me that sometimes when they use\nmarijuana they will get some degree of\ncreativity that or inspiration that they\nhaven't been able to achieve elsewhere\nand the interesting thing if you really\ntalk to him about it is it's not linear\nso meditation will help them in one way\nand weed will help them in a different\nway they're sort of like this Divergent\nquality\nto the kinds of benefits that you get\nfrom each and that's just to be honest\nwith y'all I'm not recommending that you\nuse it and I would say that those are in\nthe minority of people and I would also\nsay that sobriety overall and fixing\nthese other problems like anxiety and\nchronic pain and insomnia in healthier\nnon-weed dependent ways will end up\ngetting you higher overall\nokay\nquestions\nlet's see\nis chat Frozen\nokay\num\nyeah so when we talk about CBD so let's\ntalk about CBD for a second\nuh\nokay so so this is a good question Are\nTour Carvalho saying what if it changes\nthe ceiling altogether to a different\ndimension instead of the X Y plane you\nare drawing it maps to different things\nthat's exactly what I'm saying so the\nreason that I say this is that when you\nlook at the creativity benefit from\nmeditation the creativity benefit from\nmeditation is in this direction\nand the creativity benefit from weed is\nin this direction\nand they seem to not be\nwhile they both improve in a particular\nthing\nwhile they both Improvement the quality\nof improvement is different right so I\ncan make a dish tastier\nby adding salt or adding Spice in both\ncases it could be tasty it tastier both\ncases are improved but the way in which\nit improves is different\nthe reason that I'm in favor of this\nroute is because weed usually comes with\nsome amount of this with it too and\nother kinds of problems\nokay\nall right\nokay so if you guys want to talk about\ngray matter development that's coming I\nsee there's a question about what about\ngray matter development let's do it\nokay\nso marijuana and productivity\nfellow adhders who use weed for\nconcentration hey all my issues with\nwheat are numerous but I'm what I'm but\nwhat I'm really having trouble with is\nthat I have ADHD and it truly helps me\nconcentrate if I get buzzed and I can\nactivate hyper Focus do all sorts of\ndifficult tasks but then I have trouble\ncontrolling it and get super stoned in\nthe exact opposite\nnot sure what I'm really looking for\nhere in these responses maybe someone to\ntell me I'm not the only one most of my\nfriends laugh when I say I concentrate\nbetter on weed\nso this too is actually very common\nso if we're talking about ADHD and weed\nsome people find that it helps them\nconcentrate\nso let's understand something\nso\nADHD tends to be a hyperactive mind\nso the first thing that's kind of\nconfusing is that when we have a\nhyperactive mind\nand we add a stimulant\nhow does a stimulant because the mind is\nalready fast right you're thinking a\nthousand different thoughts\nand you're getting distracted very\neasily how does a stimulant slow down\nyour mind kind of weird right\nso the part of the the\nbrain that stimulants actually stimulate\nare your frontal lobes\nand specifically your inhibit\nyour inhibitory\nfunctions of the frontal lobes so what\nyou actually stimulate are the breaks\nso in your mind if I have a random\nthought my frontal lobes are able to\nstop that thought so I'm my frontal\nlobes are able to pump the brakes and\nstop that line of thinking so that I can\nreturn to what I need to the problem\nwith ADHD is my ability to slam on the\nbrakes to stop a particular kind of\nthinking is impaired so what we actually\nstimulate is our breaks it's easier to\nslow down\nso now let's look at something like\nmarijuana so what does marijuana do\nmarijuana slows down our mind\nright so there are two ways this is\nwhat's kind of confusing to people is\nhow can a stimulant slow down your mind\nand how can Marijuana slow down your\nmind so generally speaking marijuana has\na slowing effect on the mind we don't\nthink of marijuana as a stimulant it's\nkind of like a relaxant right\nso for some people who have a\nhyperactive mind if you add marijuana it\nkind of slows them down and allows them\nto focus some\nnow there are a couple of problems with\nthis that we kind of see here and this\nperson is like sometimes I can activate\nhyper focus and do all sorts of tasks\nbut sometimes I get super stoned and do\nthe exact opposite and that's the basic\nproblem with drugs\nis that the which way you kind of go is\nnot going to be the same right so\nsometimes it'll help you and sometimes\nit'll hurt because marijuana is going to\ndo other things like make you more\ndistractible\nin other ways\nright and not all kinds of\ndistractibility are the same\nso in marijuana you can get absorbed\ninto other tasks right it's easy to get\nabsorbed into stuff there's a sense of\nlike time dilation and some of these\nother experiences that people will\ndescribe and so like that can sometimes\nwork in your favor and sometimes not\nwork in your favor\nthe other problem with marijuana and\nADHD is that people with ADHD will have\nan altered dopamine circuitry so they\ntend to be more impulsive\nand more vulnerable to addiction\nso we see a very very high comorbidity\nof ADHD and like abuse of substances so\nwe have a whole lecture on there's a\nthere's a lecture on YouTube we actually\nhave a whole guide Dr K's guide to ADHD\nand doing stuff which is a guide to\nteach y'all how to do stuff like if you\nthink about the Neuroscience of like\nactually doing stuff like how does that\nwork we actually break it apart piece by\npiece and we'll teach you how to do\nstuff we also have certain things there\nabout\nwhen you do Psychotherapy for someone\nwith ADHD a lot of it is not like\ntalking about your feelings a lot of it\nis like learning organizational and\nproductivity skills so this is what's\nreally interesting when you teach\ncertain productivity skills to people\nwith ADHD\neven after you finish treatment for a\nperiod of two years they can be\nessentially asymptomatic from a not\nasymptomatic complete improvement from\nADHD so it can be like equivalent to\nbeing on stimulant medication once you\nstart to implement these organizational\nand productive techniques the cool thing\nabout these organizational and\nproductive techniques is they're not\nrestricted to people with ADHD\nanyone can use them and increase their\norganization output and productivity\nokay\nquestions\ncan weed cause long-term anxiety even\nafter years of having stopped it\nprobably but rarely is my guess we're\ngoing to get to that in a second okay\nthese are great\ncan supplementing weed with a meditation\npractice help one reach Enlightenment or\nsomething close I don't think so we're\ngonna get to that too these are great so\nit sounds like you guys have all these\nfantastic questions we'll talk about\nmeditation and stuff as well\nokay\num\nso I guess this is a\npaper\nso some people are wondering about the\nimpact\nof cannabis use and the effectiveness of\ntreatment so people will ask questions\nlike okay if I'm on weed\nand does it interfere with my ability to\ntreat anxiety or depression and actually\nthe answer unfortunately is like yes\nokay so let's understand this\nhow does weed interfere with treatment\nso this is really interesting\nso when we're doing psychotherapy\nyou're exploring your mind\nyou're forming new neuronal connections\nyou're reinterpreting particular things\nyou're processing emotions\nyou're changing your sense of self\nyou're even changing your behaviors\nyou're learning all kinds of new stuff\nin psychotherapy\nso if we think about what marijuana does\nmarijuana can make it hard\nto\nimprove in Psychotherapy because\nmarijuana impairs the function of the\nMind\nso what I tend to do so when I teach\nmy patient's meditation\nwhy do I combine the meditation with\nPsychotherapy I combine the meditation\nwith the Psychotherapy in a very\ntargeted and focused way so from a\nmeditative standpoint I try to observe\nokay what are the\nproblems in this person's mind how can I\nuse meditation to strengthen those\naspects of mind and once their mind is\nstrong the yield that they get out of\npsychotherapy\nis actually improved right so the mind\nthat goes into Psychotherapy will\ndetermine the effectiveness of the\npsychotherapy\nso if I'm like distracted and can't\nfocus and stuff like that I can't do the\nwork of psychotherapy but if my mind is\nclean focused if I'm observant if I'm\naware of my internal emotional state\nbecause I've meditated to become aware\nof my internal emotional state and my\npsychotherapist asks me what are you\nfeeling right now and I can articulate\nit right away because I have that high\nlevel of awareness\nthat will improve the impact of\npsychotherapy\nin the same way the converse way if my\nmind is impaired by marijuana usage\nthere's data that shows that it impairs\nthe benefit of psychotherapy now\nfrom a meditation medication standpoint\nthere's also pretty good evidence that\nwhen we mix substances together they can\ninterfere with each other sometimes they\ncan work in synergistic ways and\nsometimes they can work in antagonistic\nways\nso we know that for example\ntwo let's say sedating medications can\nwork synergistically\nbut we also know that some medications\nwill decrease the effectiveness of other\nmedications\nso it's like it's a really complicated\nkind of system right where every\nmedication can interfere with every\nother medication in a unique way can be\ncompletely neutral can increase its\nEffectiveness decrease its effectiveness\nwhat we know about things like ssris\nwhich are the first class first line\nagents for things like anxiety disorders\nis that marijuana tends to interfere\nwith them\nso generally speaking\nsomething that we kind of know in mental\nhealth treatment is that the more sober\na person is the more effective treatment\nis likely to be\nthat's just what the data shows\nnow there are some situations\nwhere we can utilize substances\nfor therapeutic benefit\nright so we know that that's possible\nwe're seeing a lot of interest in\npsychedelics for example and their\ntherapeutic use and things like PTSD\nso there are cases of that\num you know where sometimes people like\nmarijuana does have therapeutic benefits\nin anxiety disorders the problem is that\nit can also engender dependence and even\nresult in rebound anxiety\nso you've got to be a little bit careful\nthere\nI personally would not recommend the use\nof\num\nmarijuana if you've got an anxiety\ndisorder\nokay next\ndoes cannabis help with chronic pain\nI've been told by doctors that there is\nno evidence to suggest in any way that\ncannabis can help\nyet I've been told by many\nwith chronic pain that's suffering for\nyears that can help relieving 50 of the\npain or more so does anyone know if it\ncan actually help absolutely it can help\nI think we've actually got pretty clear\ndata on this\nso let me just\nlet me just pull this up\nchronic pain\nopioid\nmarijuana\nuh\n[Music]\nuh so\nthis is too old\nsee since 2022.\nyeah here we go\nlet's just take a look chat\noral synthetic cannabinoid products with\nhigh THC to CV radio shows and\nsublingual extracted products may be\nassociated with short-term improvements\nof chronic pain\nokay\nso I'm pretty sure that there are a\ncouple of very promising studies\nthat show that if you have a high opioid\ndependence\nso if you're on a high level of opioids\nthat adding some level of marijuana\nusage can reduce your opioid burden so\nI've seen a couple of cases of people\nwho have chronic pain who have actually\nhad really good outcomes by adding\nmarijuana now marijuana in some cases is\nan FDA approved treatment for certain\nconditions that involve pain and\nespecially things like nausea and stuff\nso in patients with cancer for example\nit's been FDA approved Marinol\num is FDA approved to help with like\nnausea and it may have some it's used\noftentimes off-label for pain as well so\nI think that there's like pretty good we\nkind of know I know that the reviews\nsaid that it can be used short term\nbut what I've sort of more seen\nclinically I don't use it myself because\nI don't treat chronic pain and I\ncertainly don't prescribe marijuana\nbut I've seen like good outcomes\nanecdotally that marijuana can be used\nin conjunction to reduce opioid burden\nespecially and that's where we really\nwant to think about a risk benefit\nanalysis that you should absolutely talk\nto your doctor about\nright because the child the goal there\nis not that oh like it's an excuse to\nget high watch out for the addictive\nmind the goal there is that can we\nreduce your overall medication burden\nand can you get more benefit by getting\noff of uh by reducing your opioid usage\nby adding marijuana which is a very very\nsophisticated calculation to make which\nI would not make by yourselves\nbut I think we do have some evidence and\nwe just like pulled up a quick review\nright that at least I guess when you do\na meta-analysis it shows it looks like\nthere's short-term Improvement\nand that also kind of makes sense to me\nthat once we start using marijuana\nchronically as we've sort of talked\nabout it doesn't work as well let's\nstart we start to develop some degree of\nour tolerance maybe we'll start to\ndevelop addiction things like that\nokay\nall right\nnext up\ncould you explain we'd induced psychosis\nsure\nso we'd induce psychosis is a growing\nproblem\nand why is we'd induced psychosis a\ngrowing problem let's understand a\ncouple of things\nso what is the relationship actually I\nthink I'm going to go back to the iPad\nchat\nwhat is the relationship\nbetween\nweed and psychosis\nlet's understand this\nso\none thing that there are two\nrelationships to weed and psychosis\none is that weed can temporary\ntemporarily\ninduce psychosis\nokay so how does it do this\nso psychosis is caused by an abundance\nof dopamine signal\nin the brain\ntoo much dopamine\nokay\nso when my dopamine levels are really\nhigh in the brain it results in\npsychosis so if I look at things like\ncocaine\namphetamines\nthese are very dopaminergic and so\nfrequently result in psychosis so like\ntoo many nights working in the Ed chat\nworking with people who are high on coke\nand are like hallucinating and stuff\nnow why is this becoming an increasing\nproblem\nso generally speaking wheat is really\ninteresting\nlast time I checked it's got a bunch of\npsychoactive compounds\nand some psychoactive compounds appear\nto have a antipsychotic effect\nso weeds got different kinds of stuff\nright so it's got THC it's got CBD it's\ngot all kinds of other stuff and some of\nthese may be pro-psychotic\nand some of these may be antipsychotic\nwhich is why six thousand years ago when\npeople used weed they would have some of\nthese hallucinogenic kind of experiences\nbut\nthey didn't seem to be too extreme so\nwhat's happened over the last 50 60\nyears\nwe have\ngenetically selected\nfor certain strains of weed\nand which strains of weed have we\nselected for we've selected for the ones\nthat have more of a dopamine impact so\nweed has become more concentrated and\nmore psychoactive so it's become more\npotent and as a result we're seeing the\nthe incidence of psychosis actually\nincrease because weed is getting\nstronger\nthere are also cases of synthetic weed\nbig problem so I trained up in Boston\nMassachusetts\nat Mass General Hospital and we saw a\nton of K2 usage what is K2 it's\nsynthetic weed and boy did people get\npsychotic\nthe crazy levels of psychosis like super\ndangerous stuff stay the hell away from\nK2 y'all it's very dangerous stuff okay\nnow the other thing to remember this is\njust one other thing to understand\ndopamine signaling\nif I have something like schizophrenia\nand I am hallucinating\nwhich is one form of psychosis by the\nway\nwhat is the treatment for that we use\ndopamine blockade\nso if we look at medications like\nhaloperidol what do they do they inhibit\ndopamine when they inhibit dopamine they\nmake the hallucinations go away\nright so I'm hearing voices I take my\nschizophrenia medication and the voices\ngo away\nso if we increase dopamine more likely\nto hallucinate and become psychotic if I\ndecrease dopamine less likely to become\npsychotic and slows down hallucinations\nnow there's a second thing that we have\nto be worried about when it comes to\nweed this is the really dangerous stuff\nso weed in adolescence\nokay so the other thing about this\npsychosis by the way is once the weed\nwears out once the signal that is\npumping up the dopamine goes away the\npsychosis goes away\nthis is temporary right\nthe really tricky thing is that when we\nlook at studies of weed especially in\nadolescence there are some scenarios\nwhere people who use weed can develop\nschizophrenia\nso now this is a situation where\nsomething about the usage of weed\nespecially in adolescence\nseems to accelerate the likelihood or\neither accelerate the progression of\nschizophrenia or maybe even develop\nschizophrenia\nmy personal take having looked at all\nthe the evidence is that these are\npeople who are genetically predisposed\nto schizophrenia and now the problem\nwith this is that once you develop\nschizophrenia you can even cut out the\nweed and The psychosis can remain\nscary stuff y'all hate to break it to\nyou but scary stuff\nnow\nonce again based on my reading of the\nevidence my guess is that there's a\ngroup of people this happens rarely by\nthe way okay so if you use weed in if\nyou use like weed in adolescence and\nyou're like 25 years old and you're like\nyou haven't developed schizophrenia\nchances are you've dodged the bullet so\nschizophrenia tends to develop pretty\nyoung so we're talking about like 16 18\n21 25 very very rare for someone to\nrandomly develop schizophrenia like at\nthe age of 40.\nmy reading of it is that\nwhen\nyou use marijuana it accelerates the\ndevelopment of your schizophrenia so if\nyou're predisposed to it if you're kind\nof on the fence it'll like push you over\nthe edge\nand if you're developing it slowly which\nschizophrenia by the way develops very\nvery slowly so even when someone gets a\ndiagnosis if you talk to them there's\nusually something called a prodrome\nwhich is years before the schizophrenia\nactually develops they have these like\nvery very very minor hallucinations so\nthere's like a schizophrenia prodrome\nwhere you start to hear like slightly\ndifferent sounds but the sounds have no\nmeaning so you'll hear like tinkling or\nlike static or like something like that\nif you're hearing that kind of stuff\ndon't freak out it could be something\nlike tinnitus some of that stuff goes\naway but by all means get evaluated if\nyou're worried\nso this is what's really concerning\nis that when it comes to weed and\npsychosis sometimes it appears to\naccelerate the development of\nschizophrenia or even in my opinion\nexceedingly rare cases cause causes a\nstrong word you're kind of on the fence\nand it pushes you over let's put it that\nway\nso take away\nif you\nbecome psychotic when you use pot don't\nuse pot\nokay\nsimple hate to break it to y'all why do\nsome people get psychotic when they use\npot and why do other people not get\npsychotic when they use pot the answer\nis it depends it depends on what\nwhat kind of weed are you using how\nconcentrated it is it synthetic that\nincreases the chances is it super\nconcentrated increases the chances\nthen there's genetic predispositions so\nwe know for example that there are\num you know different gene mutations\nlike akt1 and com T that will increase\nthe likelihood that you're going to have\naddiction psychosis things like that\nthere's all kinds of studies we don't\nhave to get into all those details right\nnow because practically like what good\nis that to y'all like you can't go out\nthere and get I mean maybe you can now\nget like an akt1 Gene test and come to\nGene tests and things like that but we\nknow that there's a lot of genetic\ncomponents okay\nquestions\nokay this is a good question what does\npsychosis look like great question\nso psychosis I tend to think about\npsychosis as a couple of different\nthings\nso the first thing is that psychosis\nis not a diagnosis it is a symptom\nso it's kind of like fever fever is not\na diagnosis it's just a symptom so the\ndiagnosis could be covid could be a\nbacterial infection could be multiple\nmyeloma could be an autoimmune condition\nall of those things can lead to fever\nand lots of things can lead to psychosis\nso psychosis can be caused by or\nactually\nlet's do it this way\nno\nstop it\nstay there no\ndude bruh\nbruh\nI'm going psychotic chat\nokay so psychosis can be caused by lots\nof different things okay\nso it can be caused by substances\nso this is a temporary increase in\ndopamine\nit can be caused by particular diagnoses\nlike let's let's say schizophrenia or\nschizoaffective disorder\nand this is where this person's brain is\ndifferent where their regulation of the\ndopamine system is not good so they have\nan over abundance of dopamine in a\nparticular part of their brain the real\nchallenge the real tragedy of\nschizophrenia is even though we think\nabout dopamine as a pleasure chemical\nit also does things like causes us to\nhallucinate and stuff and maybe I should\nhave started there but it unfortunately\npeople with dopamine the schizophrenia\nsorry their dopamine system is so messed\nup that they actually enjoy life less so\nthat's really tragic\nbut psychosis can also be caused by\nother things like trauma\nor things like borderline personality\ndisorder which is associated with trauma\nso you can even get periods of acute\npsychosis that can be induced by stress\nso what is psychosis\nparanoia\ndelusions\nhallucinations\nokay\nand so when we think about these what do\nthese share these are all divorced from\nreality\nand the divorcing of reality can also be\nmade in two ways so we're going to\nexplain a little bit about how these\nthings are different\nso what is a hallucination\na Hallucination is a sensory experience\nthat does not have a correlate in the\nreal world\nso I am hearing a voice\nokay even though no one is talking\nthere's no one there to talk this is a\nhallucination so I am I have a sensory\nexperience that does not is not coming\nfrom anywhere except in my own mind so\nyou can have visual hallucinations you\ncan have auditory hallucinations\nnow paranoia\nis a little bit different\nso paranoia is an interpretation\nof signals\nthat exist\nokay\nit's an interpretation\nand by the way high levels of dopamine\nmake us more paranoid too okay because\nthat's our danger signal\nso what does this mean this means that\nif I'm paranoid I'm walking down the\nstreet and I see someone parked in a car\njust parked on the side of the road this\nis a real stimulus that person is really\nthere there's really a human being\nparked by the car\nnow if I have a normally functioning\nbrain there are a thousand reasons why\npeople are parked in their cars maybe\nthey're waiting to pick someone up maybe\nthey're they don't text and drive right\nso they pulled over so they could send a\ntext message\nMaybe\nthey're taking a phone call there can be\na thousand reasons why people are pulled\nover\nif you're paranoid I'm gonna take a real\nstimulus in the outside world and I'm\ngoing to interpret it why is that person\npulled over they're following me it's an\ninterpretation of a real stimulus\nlast thing\nis delusion\nnow a delusion is a fixed belief system\nso what happens\nis when the paranoia kind of\ncrystallizes it can become a whole\nbelief system so it's not just that hey\nis that person kind of watching me like\nI'm not sure I'm kind of paranoid what\nwas that outside is it danger I'm not\nsure I'm kind of paranoid it's an\ninterpretation of a stimulus and\ndelusion Rises to the level of a whole\nbelief system\nso now the FBI is following me the mafia\nis following me so when I hear something\noutside it's not is someone out there\nit's oh crap that's the FBI or every\ntime I see someone parked by the side of\nthe road it's\nthe FBI when I'm on the highway and I'm\ndriving my car and I exit and I see\nsomeone else go across all the way\nacross the highway and exit right behind\nme holy crap that person just came all\nthe way across the highway that's the\nFBI it's a whole belief system that I\nuse to kind of interpret things okay so\nthat's what psychosis is it can be any\nthree of these things\ngenerally speaking\nsubstances will make us hallucinate or\nparanoid but usually don't create\nsubstantial beliefs because it's whole\nbelief systems we see more hallucination\nin paranoia whereas when we're talking\nabout things that are more chronic like\nschizophrenia or even delusional\ndisorders\nthat's when we have delusions but people\nwith delusional disorders usually don't\nhallucinate it's all about an\ninterpretation and a belief system does\nthat answer your question\nby the way you all want to hear\nsomething Wild\nI once had the patient who was literally\nfollowed by the FBI for like a decade\nabsolutely wild it does really happen\num\ngot it\nit's it's wild\nthis is what's kind of weird it's it's\nwhat's enjoyable crazy sad about being a\npsychiatrist which I love\nso one of the things that I've learned\nas a psychiatrist one of the most\nimportant things you can do as a\npsychiatrist okay\nso I've had lots of people who\nso like I was saying so I once had a\npatient who was actually being followed\nby the FBI for like a decade\nand so when we think about mental\nillness what we tend to think is that\nthese are people that should not be\nbelieved\nright that's what we think about mental\nillness we shouldn't believe these\npeople because on the one hand they're\nhallucinating\non the other hand they're suicidal\nright so we shouldn't trust them because\nthe whole point of mental illness is\nthat their mind is not right their mind\nis functioning incorrectly\none of the most humbling and amazing\nexperiences I've had as a psychiatrist\nthe more I learn The more I've learned\nto believe patience\nfor the love of God if you are a\ntherapist out there believe your\npatience I know that their mind can be\nmalfunctioning it's kind of bizarre I\ncan't even explain it but the most\nimportant thing that I've been able to\ndo for patients is to actually believe\nthem\nand somehow that helps I don't know how\nI don't know exactly how it works but I\nthink it's so important to believe\npatients and if you were a patient it\ndoesn't mean that you're right but it's\nimportant for people to believe you\nright and when someone says hey I'm\nsuicidal\nthe most important the biggest mistake I\ncan make is to think that this person is\nwrong\nwhat I really need to do if I want to\nhelp this person is start with the\nassumption that they're right and they\nhave a damn good reason that they're\nsuicidal\nsaw a really shocking study the other\nday by the way that up to 60 percent of\nmen who kill themselves\nhave no evidence of mental illness\nso I think one of the biggest tragedies\nthat we're perpetrating right now\npotentially\nis that when we look at male suicide we\nare assuming that this is a pathology of\nthe mind this person is sick\ninstead of\nunderstanding that it's possible that\nhalf of the men who kill themselves or\nmore\ndon't kill themselves because they're\nill they kill themselves because they're\ngenuinely in a position where death is\nthe only way out\nand we do something really dangerous by\nassuming that it's mental illness\nis that if we assume it's mental illness\nwe don't try to fix the problems that\nare pushing them towards suicide\nreally really scary thing that's going\non and I'm not saying that mental\nillness does not lead to suicide and\npeople shouldn't get therapy and things\nlike that I think they should absolutely\ndo that but another simple example to\ndrive this home\nso when I have a patient who's in a\ntraumatic and abusive relationship and\nthey're suicidal\ntherapy may help them somewhat the\nsuicide but the most important thing I\ncan do for that person's suicidality is\nto help them build a life where they're\nno longer abused\nit's to change something in their life\nnot to change them\nand part of the reason that I think that\nwe're seeing so much mental illness\nnowadays is because the world that\npeople are living in is getting\nmore difficult to live in survival is\nthere\nrelationships connection love respect\nIndependence\npaying your bills owning a home\nhaving friends these things are getting\nharder and harder to achieve\nwhich is why we're seeing a spike in\nmental illness\nand we can therapize them I think\ntherapy is great if y'all are in those\nsituations by all means see a therapist\nbecause I've helped people with their\nsuicidality hopefully form a plan and\nthen ultimately make a change in their\nlife and any patient who comes to me my\ngoal is to get them to leave\nfor them to have such an amazing life\nwhere they no longer need my support\nbut we've got to be super careful\nbecause I think a lot of this Mental\nHealth crisis\nis not going to be fixed by therapists\nit's like a societal responsibility and\nif you guys want some data for that\nreally quick segment\nso New York City\nhad this program called housing first so\nif you were homeless\nin order to get\nsubsidized housing or free housing you\nhad to be sober\nso you have to you're homeless you're on\nthe streets you're addicted to whatever\ncrack cocaine alcohol\nyou have to become sober first and if\nyou become sober that's a prize and you\nget a place to live\nunder that policy everything was\nterrible so New York City city did\nsomething really bizarre they said\nhousing first we don't care if you're\nsober or not we're going to give you a\nplace to live\nwhat they actually found with the\nhousing first model is that giving\nsomeone housing helps them conquer\naddiction not the other way around\nand so it's a really revolutionary\nPublic Health Discovery to understand\nthat you have to help someone build a\nlife that is worth living and then\nmental illness becomes easier to deal\nwith\nreally real tragedy that's going on\nright now\nand I'm all for seeing therapists and\nlike you all should absolutely do that\nI'm all for increased mental health\nfunding because we do not have enough\nMental Health Resources that's part of\nthe reason we're here today\nand also like the Mental Health crisis\nthat we see today is not going to be\nsolved in my humble opinion exclusively\nby sending every human being on the\nplanet to see a therapist we've got to\nactually fix the lives that they go back\nto when they leave the therapist's\noffice\nand by the way if you all disagree or\nyou think I'm wrong please let me know I\nhave an open mind about it please\neducate me\nokay\nso I saw someone saying hey I'm not\nquitting weed\nso\nif y'all are kind of thinking like hey\nI'm not gonna quit weed I need it\nI know it sounds kind of weird but I\nthink that's okay\nright so no one can force you to quit\nand the whole point about substances\nthis is wow\ncan you all hear that\nI'm gonna just wait until this thing is\ngone and then we'll start over\num\nall right\nyeah so so orange dibbleberg is saying I\nfeel that people were born to poor\nfamilies have an insane disadvantage\nbecause of that we're\nall saying not to be materialistic but\nmaterialistic things help us\nso much to say about that\nso I have one simple experience of like\nmy own personal mental health that I\nlove to share because people will say\nokay like don't be materialistic right\nbut\nif you want to be mentally healthy you\nhave to be secure so there's one period\nin my life where I was basically\non the cusp of being homeless\nand I had sort of I'd moved to Boston\nhad three hundred dollars and that was\nall the money that I had had to find a\njob I had you know a place to stay where\nI was paying like 78 a night or\nsomething like that and I had set up the\nsituation where I found a couple of\nRoommates had never met them before they\nwere like Hey we're going to sign this\nlease I was like have you all seen the\nplace they're like no we haven't seen\nthe place I went and checked out the\nplace we were all going to split split\nthe round evenly they're giving me a\ncloset and they're two big rooms and I\nsaid hey like I don't think this is fair\nbad roommate situation kind of fell\napart and I had two days to figure out\nwhere I was going to live\nI could the anxiety was through the roof\nI didn't know what was happening in my\nlife\nanxiety was through the roof I could not\neat I was so nauseous to my stomach I\ncould not eat I could not sleep I\ncouldn't eat I couldn't sleep I started\nto feel weak I had no idea what to do my\nmind couldn't focus everything was\nfalling apart\nthankfully I ended up\nsort of bouncing back\nbut my experience of that was quite\neye-opening because this was a 72-hour\nperiod of my life\nand the crazy thing is that I'm so lucky\nthat I was never actually going to be\nhomeless I had a safety net where I\ncould have called an aunt or an uncle I\ncould have called my mom or dad\nthey could have given me a plane ticket\nI could have moved back in with my\nparents there I had so many say even\nthough I was kind of on the cusp of\nhomelessness it really felt that way\nbecause I had decided\nthat I was not going to ask for help and\nI was going to do it myself\nbut I hope you all understand this\nthe decision to be independent and not\nrely on something someone else's help is\nthe height of privilege\nI get to choose the terrifying thing and\neven after I had made that choice it\nwrecked me for three days\ndespite all of my resilience and all of\nmy yogic training and all of my\nmeditation smacked to the ground\nand I still had a safety net\nI can only imagine what life is like if\nyou do not have that safety net and you\ndon't get to make the choice\nyou're just getting bodied left and\nright by your material circumstances\nsecurity is the foundation of Mental\nHealth\nand so if you all are like struggling\nlike I hear it\nand I think that like that's what's so\nchallenging right is everyone's like oh\nlike work on your mental health and it's\nlike yeah and like you should do that\nand that's really important but like\nlet's be honest\ngoing to see a therapist doesn't\nnecessarily get you a place to live it\ndoesn't necessarily find you someone who\nloves you it doesn't necessarily\ngive you Independence it doesn't give\nyou purpose it helps it's a great\nstarting point and I've helped a lot of\npeople who are\nstarting from Square zero\nat one point seventy percent of the\npeople in my practice\ncould not pay a single dollar for my\ntreatment\nand so I've helped a lot of people who\nare like homeless and stuff like that\nand like you got to start somewhere so\nby all means get some help\nbut let's not confuse the utility of\nmental health treatment\nwith the sufficiency of mental health\ntreatment to fix the problem\nnow someone else\nwas saying I'm not ready to quit weed\nyet\nso I know it sounds kind of bizarre but\nI hear you\nand I don't think you need to\nright so let's understand something\nabout weed and substances in general\nwe don't get addicted to things that\ncause US problems we get addicted to\nthings that fix problems\nthat's why we get addicted the benefit\nthat we get from the substance outweighs\nthe harm that it does to our life\nliterally\nright so I had a patient who was\naddicted to heroin\ngoing through divorce\nfired from work\nhad spent a lot of their savings on\ndrugs\nkids are alienated\nI couldn't understand I was like bro why\ndon't you just quit it's ruining every\npart of your life\nand he's like bro you don't understand\nmy life is falling apart and anytime I\nget high\nit gets put back together\nI've got two options live a life that's\nfalling apart or live a life where\neverything's fine\nwhich would you choose\nand so if you're not ready to quit\nhonestly that's okay\ndo I think you should work towards\ngetting ready absolutely\nright so when if you it's kind of\ninteresting because if you look at\naddiction\npsychiatry in the treatment of addiction\nyou have to want to quit I no\npsychiatrist or therapist can quit for\nyou the only way it works is if you want\nto\nand if you're not ready yet that's okay\nthere's always tomorrow\nbut\nhere's the big butt\nreally think about why you're not ready\nyet and think about whether you want to\nbe ready one day\nand when I work with people who aren't\nready to quit which by the way FYI is\nthe majority of people\nwho are not ready and that's okay dude\nlike it takes time like you have to walk\nyour journey like it takes time to get\nready\nand just think about what it is that you\nneed to be ready and work towards that\nright like it's okay for you to because\nsometimes you need to sleep sometimes\nyour anxiety is crippling I get that\nbut just because you're not ready to\nquit today does not mean that you should\nstop moving towards readiness\nso if you've got anxiety don't stop with\npot\nget some kind of help\nright learn to meditate see a therapist\nmaybe start medication\nquestions\nthese thought exercises are difficult\nyou're damn right they are Vern\nso Michelle 137 is saying I'm trying and\nthat's all you can do\nright\nall you can do is try\nman of great wealth is asking can you be\nmy therapist well if you're a man of\ngreat wealth maybe I'm gonna say yes but\nthe answer is sadly no\nso a couple years ago I made a choice\nand it was a hard choice and it's a\nchoice that in a lot of ways that I\nregret\nI decided that I wanted to help\nmore people in a less impactful way\nthan help a handful of people in a very\nimpactful way\nwhich is what I used to do so I used to\nhave a full clinical practice and a job\non top of that\nso I used to do about\n36 hours of therapy a week or you know\nlike outpatient practice and then I had\na job at a Addiction Rehab\nand what I actually found is like I was\nsaying kind of earlier like\nthere is a tide of people who need\ntherapy and there was no way I was going\nto get through them all if I continue\nthat for the rest of my life I would\nhave seen or not you know until\nretirement I would have I would have\nbeen able to help a thousand people\ntoday there are 3 000 people right now\nthat are listening and I can't help you\nnearly as much as I help people in my\noffice and that's okay\nbut I hope that I can help\n3 000 people a little bit\ndo you think it's healthy to use weed in\nmoderation so we've talked about that a\nlittle bit but here's the problem\nso probably for some people there is a\nhealthy amount of there's a moderated\nusage of weed that's possible I do\nbelieve that\nthe tricky thing\nabout healthy weed that's used in\nmoderation\nis that if you are someone who cannot\nuse weed in moderation\nyou will take that statement and you\nwill use it to fuel your addiction\nso if you're addicted very few addicts\nunderstand that they're truly addicted\nmost addicts think that this person who\nuses 20 more than me is addicted but I'm\nokay\nthis is how the addictive mind works\nright because it's not going to let you\nhave an excuse\nto stop using because it wants the\nsubstance so it'll twist and turn and\nit'll keep moving the goal posts\nand so if you're using\nand you're justifying it to yourself you\nmay not think it's justification you may\nthink it's logic\nbut when the addictive mind is active\nit's subtle and it'll always make the\ngoal posts so that you can end up with\none decision which is okay to keep using\nthat's how you know what an addictive\nmind is no matter how you twist and turn\nthe conclusion is always the same it's\nokay to keep using\nright so Adam not 22 is saying I I went\nfrom smoking every day all day to about\nonce or twice a day if at all because it\nstopped making things better the way it\nused to if you can't moderate anything\nit's time to stop I completely agree\nand I'd encourage you Adam to keep going\nright take a couple days off see what it\ndoes\nSam boss is asking hey Dr K I was\nwondering if is it more common that men\nget more anxious what a great question\nso if you look at the data\nthe prevalence of anxiety disorders in\nwomen is greater than in men and\nsomewhere between two to three times\nmore common in women than in men\nbut there's a big butt there\nI do believe first of all the data is\nshowing that that gender gap\nis moving towards equality right which\nis what we want in this Society\nso the gender gap appears to be\nshrinking over time\nthe second thing is that I think that\nthe same\ncore fear\nmanifests as an anxiety disorder in\nwomen and manifests in men in a\ndifferent way\nso worry about the future for men\nmanifests in my experience is pressure\nso there are some men that I worked with\nwhen when they come into my office they\ndon't complain of worry\nwhat they complain of is pressure\nand if you really ask them\nwhat do you mean by pressure they're\nlike I don't know how to make it work\nI don't know how I'm gonna juggle this\nand do this and do this and do this I've\ngot to reach this expectation and I\ndon't think I can do it\nand so if you really tunnel down into it\nwhat is that it's actually anxiety\nI'm worried about the future but they\ndon't experience it subjectively as\nworry\nso if you think about what is anxiety it\nis fear of consequences of the future\nI'm worried that this person will fire\nme I'm worried that this person will\nbreak up with me I'm afraid of this\nconsequence\nthe thing is with men they just\nexperience it differently\nthey experience it as pressure\nbecause when you're afraid of the\nconsequence the way that we're sort of\nlike\nsocietally trained as men is that when\nthere is fear of a consequence it's not\nsomething you worry about it's something\nthat you fix\nso I think the same root results in\npressure\nsometimes like self-loathing some\nsometimes self-hatred sometimes a\nfeeling of insufficiency in men and will\nlook like an anxiety disorder in women\nand since when we were conceptualizing\nour core of anxiety a lot of it was\nheavily influenced by female patients\nand that's not like I don't think that's\na discrimination or anything I think\nit's just very simple Freud had a couple\nof women that were anxious and then we\ndeveloped these diagnostic criteria and\nthe diagnostic criteria were more based\non women and then since more women\nmet these criteria they were the ones\nthat got diagnosed they were the ones\nthat got treated so all of our\nexperience was in the manifesto\nmanifestation of anxiety within women\nI don't think it's like discrimination\nbut I do I don't think that men or women\nsuffer any different any different\namounts I think the way that it looks\nis different\nand I think for far too long we've sort\nof\nactually I\nI think for far too long we've sort of\nlike had this gender-based bias in our\nmental illness diagnosis schema and\nwe're aware of it in some ways so for\nexample men are more likely to be\ndiagnosed with sociopathy or narcissism\nand women are more likely to be\ndiagnosed with borderline personality\ndisorder and histrionic personality\ndisorder\nbut all of these manifestations share a\ncommon root\nand it just looks different\nin these two different genders because\nof maybe genetics maybe hormones maybe\nupbringing chances are all of the above\nso stop chasing the expectation that\nweed is causing all your problems I\ndon't know it depends on what your\nproblems are\nbut generally speaking all of your\nproblems are not caused by one thing\ngenerally\nthe real tragedy there for being\nstraight up honest\nis that for a small subset of people all\nyour problems let's be straight are\nbeing caused by one thing we love to\nlook at multi-factorial causes of\nproblems but I gotta be straight with\ny'all sometimes all your\nproblems are caused by weed or alcohol\nsometimes all your problems are\ncaused by one person in your life a\ntraumatic person an abusive person a\nmanipulative person could be a parent\ncould be a romantic partner could be a\nboyfriend girlfriend\nhonestly that's been my experience for\nabout a fourth of people that I've\nworked with there is once the one thing\nthat is up their life\nand getting out of that household this\nis another you know hot take\nso I hate to say it but I've seen I I've\nhad so many patients who have turned\ntheir lives around by joining the\nmilitary swear to God this is not\nsponsored by any military\nbut like for some people it has been the\nright move I'm not saying that you all\nshould join the military military has\nall kinds of problems with it but for\nsome people just to be honest like it's\nlike the ability to get out of a\nhousehold and I think it's tragic that\nwe live in a society where that's the\nway that you have to get out of the\nhousehold but for some people that's\nwhat it takes\ndo more long-form content interviews\nokay\nthanks for sharing your opinion\nthanks for spamming chat your message\nhas been seen\nI'm not saying that y'all should join\nthe military what I'm saying is I'm\nusing it as an example\nof sometimes you just need to GTFO from\nyour circumstances and that will fix\nmost of the problems\nuh what is your treatment for cannabis\ntreatment what is my opinion on cannabis\ntreatment for autism symptoms\nso I don't have a straight opinion\ngenerally speaking I would recommend\nagainst it but I I think I I realize\nthat that's an opinion but here's the\nthing\nautism is such a heterogeneous\npresentation\nso like autism can look completely\ndifferent in two different people\nand marijuana usage can look completely\ndifferent in two different people\nand so even if you look at things like\nanxiety disorders there's more\nuniformity for anxiety disorders or ADHD\nso it's easier to say this is the impact\nof marijuana on anxiety or ADHD\nthe heterogeneity of autism makes it\nharder for there to be a clear\nconclusion at least for me I'm not\nan expert on autism so there may be\nmental health professionals out there\nwho have a clear answer on I'm just not\nknowledgeable enough to have a strong\nopinion about it\nand that doesn't mean that your question\ndoesn't deserve a better answer that\njust means that I'm\nI'm not knowledgeable I I lack the\nexpertise to be able to answer it but I\nwill absolutely look into it for you\nokay we've got a couple more things so\nlet's get to them\nforeign\nwhy can't I smoke anymore I smoked a lot\nwhen I was younger but I haven't touched\nit in years because no matter the strain\nit gives me panic attacks\nokay\nso\nsometimes when people use a lot of\nmarijuana they can get something\nthey can get a rebound syndrome\nso anytime we have a substance\nthat we use a lot we develop a tolerance\nto it\nand when we develop a tolerance to it\nthe absence of it causes a rebound of\nthose things now the worst\nversion of this that at least I've seen\nit's just when I've seen suffering okay\ndoesn't mean that you have it better if\nyou have like panic attacks is something\ncalled cyclic vomiting syndrome\nso cyclic vomiting syndrome is a\nsituation where anytime you don't use\nmarijuana\nyou have\nin what I've seen to be crippling nausea\nso I'm sure there are milder versions\nout there that's just not the patients\nthat I saw right so I\nand so what what sort of happens with\ncyclic vomiting syndrome is you use\nmarijuana\nyou develop some degree of nausea\nthen for a while marijuana can help the\nnausea so we marijuana is an FDA\napproved treatment for chemotherapy and\ncancer-related nausea for example\nso we know it's therapeutic for it but\nin a small subset of people it creates\nrebound nausea so the second that the\nmarijuana wears off the nausea comes\nback and even comes back worse\nso this is also very similar to caffeine\nso if I drink coffee every day and then\nI don't have it I feel so terrible\nwithout coffee\nand that can happen not only with like\ntiredness and coffee which is a pretty\ncommon experience it can happen with\nnausea and marijuana it can also happen\nwith panic attacks anxiety and marijuana\nso we talk about this in a lot of detail\nin Dr K's guide there's a whole lecture\non something called rebound anxiety\nand rebound anxiety has a lot to do with\nsubstances and what happens is our body\ngets used to the substance\nand since we have these anti-anxiety\nsignals that we're dumping into our body\nwe ramp up our endogenous anxiety\nand then once we remove the marijuana\nthen the anxiety can ramp up\nand then we get this kind of like panic\nattack now this person is also talking\nabout I get panic when I smoke marijuana\nand if we kind of go back to the\npsychosis stuff\nremember that marijuana can have an\nanxiolytic or anxiety relieving effect\nor it can have a paranoid\nhyperdopaminergic hallucinating kind of\neffect\nand so for some people they experience\nsomething like a panic attack which I\nwould venture neurochemically is a\nlittle bit closer to paranoia\nbut it can absolutely happen and over\ntime there's this hypothesis called like\nthe kindling hypothesis\nwhere\nif you have a bad outcome from a\nsubstance\nthe next time you use it the ability to\nhave that outcome actually increases\nso rather than developing tolerance you\nactually develop sensitization\nto the substance\nand we've seen that too and that's kind\nof confusing because sometimes people\nget kindled where it's kind of kindling\nright so you like start a small fire and\nthen you like when you add substance\nthat grows and grows and grows and grows\nand grows so we can develop\nhypersensitivity to it so allergies are\nanother example of like this kindling\nkind of phenomenon\nwhat are the sometimes the first bee\nsting that you have doesn't cause\nanaphylaxis the second beast thing you\nhave can can be more dangerous\nso we can see both of those and so\nsometimes marijuana can absolutely\ninduce panic attacks and stuff like that\nthat's why chat hate to break it to you\nthat's why y'all should kind of steer\nclear of it\nokay\nnext up\ndid I break my brain development because\nI smoked weed 20 to 30 times between the\nages of 12 and 17.\nwhat a great question\ndid you break your brain development\nJohn Pepe\nthe answer the short answer is\nno but you didn't do it any favors\nso we're going to be completely honest\nwith y'all\nhere's what we know about adolescent\nbrain development and marijuana so when\nwe when the brain is developing\nwe don't want to tamper with it\nbecause when the brain is developing\nit's kind of like wet concrete and any\nimpression that you make in the wet\nconcrete will then solidify and will\nthen be there forever\nokay so the brain is sort of like sort\nof like that thankfully it's not quite\nlike concrete\nso if you add a substance the brain\nadapts to the substance and assumes it's\nthere all the time so it wires around\nthe substance which means that sometimes\nyou can get a dependency on the\nsubstance\nso we know for example that if you use\nmarijuana\nin adolescence it Alters the formation\nof your dopamine circuitry which can\nthen make you more prone to other kinds\nof addictions and things like that\nthe good news is that there's a lot of\nmixed evidence about whether you've\nscrewed your life up\nso the worst studies suggest that\nmarijuana usage during adolescence costs\nyou\nfour to ten IQ points\nthe worst ones okay\nso you may have lost five points IQ\nif you used a lot of marijuana during\nadolescence\nthe good news is that those studies are\nby no means conclusive\nso a lot of studies will show that\nactually your IQ is like pretty\npreserved or maybe it's four points or\nthe reason that those IQ points were\nlost is not because of the marijuana\nusage itself but maybe the circumstances\nin your life that push you to marijuana\nusage in the first place like untreated\nanxiety or adverse childhood experiences\ntraumatic households things like that\nokay so the good news is even though\nthere are some studies that'll be like\nminus one to int GG\nthe good news is that those studies are\nfar from conclusive\nand the even better news\nis that the brain is plastic\nso there aren't a whole lot of studies\nthat show that you can boost your IQ for\nexample\nbut my clinical experience working with\na lot of people who started marijuana\nusage early on is that you can adapt to\nwhatever happened to your brain and\nessentially live a relatively normal\nfunctional successful life\nthe real cost of using marijuana in\nadolescence is that if you want to get\nback to normal\nor if you want to get back to the\nfullness of your potential it's a\nsteeper climb\nso you didn't do yourself any favors but\nI don't think you bricked your brain\nand to be completely honest like five IQ\npoints is not worth that much\nokay so the standard deviation of IQ is\nlike I think 20 points\nand like I don't think there's a huge\ndifference in terms of outcomes whether\nyour IQ is like 100 or 105 it doesn't\nmake that big of a difference\nI know it's scary to lose IQ but\nokay\nso we've got a couple more that we're\ngoing to try to fire through okay\num\nokay so I don't use cannabis anymore in\none of the largest factors in my\ndecision to quit was that it seemed to\ndegrade my ability and willingness to\nspeak and articulate clearly all the\ntime even when not high do you think\nthat that that's related to\nwell-established degenerative effect on\nshort-term memory is there something\nelse have you seen research on this\naspect of its effects what a great\nquestion\nso this is kind of complicated but there\nare a couple of things to consider\nthe first is that marijuana is fat\nsoluble\nso if you use a lot of marijuana\nthere's a chance that even post being\nhigh it's dissolved into your adipose\ntissue and then it kind of leaks out and\nmay continue to affect you in subtle\nways\nthis is why sometimes people like two\nweeks after getting high can still test\npositive for THC in the urine because\nit's still floating around\nso it's possible that if you are using a\nlot it kind of built up and was\naffecting you in some minor way\nanother thing to consider is that if you\nused it during periods of brain\ndevelopment it may have altered your\nbrain development\nand so if it altered your brain\ndevelopment we can have difficulties\nwith like you know\num speak articulation and stuff like\nthat the good news is that if we look at\nthings like the development of stutters\nif we look at difficulties with\narticulation if we look at public\nspeaking stuff even if there was\nsomething that\nwas changed in your brain it usually\ndoesn't mean it's permanent right so\nthere are treatments there's like speech\ntherapy for things like stutters so\nthese people's brains have wired in a\nparticular way and we literally have\ntherapy that can fix it\nif it has a an effect on short-term\nmemory I'm not really sure I haven't\nlooked at that so I don't really know if\nthere's like a clear link between\narticulation and short-term memory but\ncould be\num\nokay I think that\nwe talked about that\nokay some people say marijuana makes\nthem more anxious and depressed and\nothers say that it helps them less and\nbe less anxious anxious and depressed\nwhat's the difference between these two\ncamps and is one lying to themselves\nwhat a great question\nokay so let's take a look at this\nso when some people say anxiety help\nmarijuana helps with my anxiety or\ndepression other people say that\nmarijuana makes my anxiety a depression\nworse which one is correct and the\nanswer is probably both\nso if we look at mood\nor anxiety\nwhat do we know about marijuana\nso let's say this is Baseline normal\nanxiety\nso if you are\nhighly anxious\nwhat marijuana can do\nis\nrelieve your anxiety because it has an\nanxiolytic effect\nnow this becomes a problem because if we\nuse a lot of marijuana\nto fix our anxiety over and over and\nover again as we've already discussed we\ncan develop some tolerance\nand so then what can happen is our\nBaseline can really get solidified here\nbecause we become dependent on the\nanxiety so even though it helps it can\nlead to worsening anxiety over time\nthe other thing that we know about\nanxiety\nor sorry marijuana is that generally\nspeaking substances like alcohol and\nmarijuana\ncan help us COPE in the short term but\ncan lead to long-term problems so the\nmore that I use marijuana what it\nactually does\nis\nchanges my Baseline every time I use it\nokay so maybe this is a better way to\nput it and so then what happens is when\nI get now when the marijuana wears off\nI need more\nand then I use it again and then it\nlowers my Baseline and I need more\nthis is definitely what happens in\nalcohol so over time chronic use of\nmarijuana tends to worsen anxiety and\ndepression\nso we tend to see is that marijuana\nactually does both it has short-term\nbeneficial effects and generally\nspeaking long-term negative effects\nso if you ask someone what do you notice\nwhat they'll notice is within 24 hours\nor even not let's be honest within an\nhour of starting to use marijuana they\nwill notice a Improvement and the other\nreal tragedy here is that our brain is\nmuch more likely to notice instant\nreinforcement\nand way harder to notice long-term\neffects\nthat's just the way that our brain works\nso if you look at the addictiveness of\nmedications\nthe faster it hits your brain the more\nlikely it is to be addictive and the\nmore likely you are to be reinforced so\nif you look at like Pavlov pavlovian\nconditioning Pavlov would ring the bell\nand then he'd give the dogs food\nif he rang the bell today and gave the\nfood 24 hours later the dog isn't going\nto learn anything from it\nright it can't form that Association so\nthe more of a time lag there is between\na change in your mood and the slower it\nhappens the more the less likely we are\nto notice it\nand probably what's happening with\npeople who some people who notice that\nmarijuana has negative effects on their\nanxiety and mood is it's gotten so bad\nthat they can no longer ignore it or it\nstops working\nand what happens with people who who say\nit helps is I would bet that on average\nit has especially if they're daily users\nit's actually worsening their Baseline\nmood but the effect is small and so\ngradual that they don't notice it and\nwhat they really notice is this\nokay\nwhat defines chronic use\nI would say\nyou know at a minimum every day is\nchronic use I mean I would say even\nevery other day or things like that or\nit would qualify as chronic use in my\nbook I think anything more than once a\nweek or twice a week is probably more on\nthe level of chronic\nTBH\nand um\nyeah but I don't know there may be a\nmore technical definition that I'm just\nnot aware of somewhere\nokay\nso\nthat's the wrap for today\num\nyeah thanks a lot for coming y'all it's\nbeen a lot of fun to\nuh\ntalk to you all today about weed really\ngrateful to everybody for all the\ncomments that they had all the questions\nthat y'all put together sorry for the\ndelay in the Stream time I got sick\nso we had uh you know\ndelay that but it's been awesome also\ncatching up with y'all on the YouTube\num\nand good luck with everything I think\njust a couple of you know closing\nthoughts if y'all didn't catch the full\nstream you know we answered a bunch of\nquestions I want to say 12 15 20.\nand it's been great being here\nif you all are struggling with weed on\nthe whole I do not recommend regular use\nof weed I think it does more harm than\ngood I do think that there's a lot of\nshort-term benefit\nand if you're using weed on a regular\nbasis I would strongly recommend that\nyou have a trial of serious sobriety\nso what I'm talking about is like six\nmonths or a year of abstinence\na couple of other closing thoughts if\nyour brain is developing right now do\nyour best to steer clear of weed because\nthere's pretty good evidence that it\ndoes not help\ndoesn't break your brain thankfully the\nbrain is resilient the brain can adapt\nyou can learn new things there's a lot\nof neuroplasticity that happens later in\nlife so if you kind of use a lot of weed\nin your teenage years you're not screwed\nbut\nmuch like anything else that you like\nneglect the proper development of it's\ngoing to take some time to play catch-up\nlast thing is if y'all aren't ready to\nquit\nthat's okay\nyou know people are joking I'm watching\nthis hide that's okay too right you got\nto start somewhere\nsomeone who's saying I'm watching this\nhigh\nwell like\nwould it be better if you watched it\nsober\nmaybe less fun let's be honest\nbut the truth of the matter is that at\nleast you watched it\nright so this is where like people will\nbe so judgmental if you use weed they're\nlike you should stop and you should stop\nbut like hey at least you watch this and\nyou educated yourself you may have moved\none step forward towards sobriety and if\nyou decide that that's not what I do\nit's your life\nall I can do is try to equip y'all with\nthe information of what the pros and\ncons are and it's up to you to decide\nwhether you want to do it and whether\nit's worth it\nthe real tragedy that I see in the real\nconclusion that I've come to doing a lot\nof addiction psychiatrists it's usually\nnot worth it\nall right so you all take care\nmuch love\nand\num thank you very much for being here\nadios everybody"
