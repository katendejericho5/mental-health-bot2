    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about healthy\nversus unhealthy anger so how do we know\nwhen anger is healthy and when it's sort\nof like something that we should be\nexperiencing and is okay to experience\nand how do we know when anger is\nunhealthy and in either case we're also\ngoing to teach you all some techniques\nto get control of your anger\nso anger is an incredibly tricky emotion\nbecause first of all it causes us to\nlose control right when we get angry we\ntend to do things that we will regret\nlater we tend to damage relationships\nmaybe shoot ourselves in the foot in\nterms of like work or school or things\nlike that the anger gets control of us\nand then we end up doing things that we\nregret the other reason that anger is\nsuch a problem is because we know that\nanger causes people to do things that\nthey regret and so then what we do as a\nsociety is we tend to demonize anger\nright when people are publicly pissed\noff or they express their anger in some\nway we all Retreat from anger so as a\nwhole we tend to demonize the emotion of\nanger and so we all sort of think about\nokay like there's some emotions that are\ngood emotions right like joy and peace\nand tranquility and love and compassion\nand curiosity all of these things are\ngood emotions and then they're the bad\nemotions like anger and sadness and\nguilt and shame and what we try to do is\ncultivate lives where we experience a\nlot of the good emotions and try to\nminimize the experience of the negative\nemotions and anger is one that is\nparticularly like difficult to deal with\nbecause anger is the one that is\noftentimes like harmful to other people\nand so since we demonize anger it's\nreally hard to figure out like okay like\nhow do I know when it's okay to feel\nangry when is it okay to feel angry what\nshould I do if I'm feeling angry is this\nsomething that will hurt other people or\nis this like an appropriate healthy\nemotion that I should be experiencing I\nwant to take a moment to thank our HD\ncoaches I've taught it a lot of\ndifferent places and worked with a lot\nof different people and honestly our\ncoaches are some of the best people I've\never worked with he coaches have helped\nover 10 000 people find purpose\nDirection and improve their mental\nhealth after about 20 weeks of coaching\nthe average client experiences a 58\nImprovement in sense of purpose in life\na 45 Improvement in feelings of anxiety\nand even a 35 reduction in feelings of\nDespair and this isn't just me saying\nthis at this point we've done this for\nthree years run six research studies and\neven presented our findings at the\nAmerican Psychiatric association\nNational Conference over 100 000\nsessions later I can confidently say\nthis works so if you're interested in\nchecking out he coaching for yourself go\nto healthygamer.gg coaching to learn\nmore so let's start by looking at\nhealthy anger and let's start by also\nlooking at why we get angry in the first\nplace\nso we have to understand that anger is\nlike a conserved emotion not just in\nhuman beings but across like animals as\nwell right so anger isn't a bug it's a\nfeature our brains are all designed with\nthe capacity for anger and in fact we\neven look at things like developmental\npsychology where there are kids who are\nin their who are two years old and in\nthe U.S we'll talk about the terrible\ntwos which is when kids start to get\nreally like angry this is when children\nare literally developmentally learning\nthe capacity for anger and so anger is\nlike absolutely a healthy part of our\nbrain and let's understand what it's\nthere for so anger is there to protect\nour territory so if you think a little\nbit about like let's look at the Animal\nKingdom right when do animals get angry\nlike if one animal has like let's say\nI'm a tiger and I've like hunted\nsomething like I've hunted a deer and\nthen I'm eating my deer and if someone\nelse another animal tries to take that\ndeer away from me as a tiger I'm going\nto get angry you will see anger in the\ntiger you'll see sort of this\nterritorial defense and that's what\ntends to happen in the animal kingdom\nright anytime the territory of an animal\nis violated the response is anger so\nanger is a defensive and protective\nemotion and if we sort of think a little\nbit about it like anger does all kinds\nof stuff to the brain it like lowers our\ncapacity to feel pain right it causes us\nto engage in conflict and kind of\nprotect ourselves so anger is actually a\nhealthy emotion when it is used to\nprotect our boundaries or territories\nso when we sort of don't feel that\nhealthy anger and this is like one\nmanifestation of unhealthy anger we sort\nof become doormats right so in when\npeople like violate my territory I will\nlike let them do that so if someone\nlet's say steals something from me at\nschool and I don't get angry enough if I\ndon't feel that anger if I feel fear\ninstead I will let people take things\naway from me\nin places like work or things like that\nlike oftentimes we'll also hear about\nyou know toxicity in the work\nenvironment or toxicity from bosses or\neven situations like sexual harassment\nor will will sort of hear tons of stuff\nin our community about like abuse of\nHome situations abuse of Partners abuse\nof parents and what those people will\noftentimes do is violate our boundaries\nand then if we don't have a healthy\namount of anger we will let people kind\nof do that\nthere's a whole complicated reason why\nthat is but I just want to point out to\nyou all that when we don't protect our\nterritory that can sort of be an\nunhealthy form of anger as well and so\nideally what we want to do with anger is\nanger is a signal from our brain our\nbody that hey this is mine and you don't\nget to take this away from me this can\nalso be kind of problematic because even\nwhen we feel healthy anger sometimes we\ncan lose control of it and if we let the\nanger get the better of us even if it's\nappropriate we'll end up with sort of a\nnegative outcome right so if if I'm in\nan abusive situation at home and my\nparents control my living situation and\nI get angry with them they will punish\nme for it okay\nso the first thing to understand is that\nanger is healthy and generally speaking\nwhen your territory or your boundaries\nare violated anger is actually a healthy\nand normal response we still want to be\nable to control it but this is like an\nappropriate expression of anger\nso what is inappropriate anger so\ninappropriate anger tends to come from\nthwarted expectations comes from a sense\nof deservingness or entitlement so if we\nkind of think about it how does a\nthwarted expectation activate our\nterritory circuitry in the brain right\nso think about it for a second like okay\nwhat does an expectation have to do with\nthis is territorial protection circuitry\nso if we really look at expectations\nwhat an expectation is is it something\nthat it's a territory that we've claimed\nthat we don't really own that's really\nwhat an expectation is right it's this\nidea that hey this thing is going to\nhappen this thing is mine I deserve this\nbut then I don't get it which means that\nI end up getting angry so let's just run\nthrough a couple of examples so let's\nsay that\nI like a girl and if I like a girl or a\nguy whatever right I will invest a lot\ninto the relationship so I'll get this\nperson flowers I'll call them all the\ntime I'll be an emotional support we'll\nhang out when we go out to dinner I will\npay for them and so we sort of think\nabout this like I like this person I'm\ninterested in this person but the more\nthat I invest in the the relationship\nthe more I start to form a territorial\nwall around this person this is my\nterritory I'm expanding into this this\nspace and this person owes me and then\nif this person starts dating someone\nelse or doesn't return my texts or\nthings like that I get incredibly angry\nright other examples of this that I've\nseen a ton we see this a lot in our\ncareer coaching program for example is\npeople who work really hard and then are\nreally upset that they don't get\nrecognized or they they don't get the\npromotion that they believe that they\ndeserve so this is another example of\nI'm going to invest a lot of energy and\nthen I expect a return\nand when I expect a return and I don't\nget it I end up getting really really\npissed off\nwe also see this in our community with\npeople like Gamers right and if you play\nvideo games you know what this is like\nbecause when I queue up for a particular\nvideo game and I have teammates and I'm\nhaving a really good game and someone\nelse throws the game I tilt really hard\nand what is that what is tilt it's a\nthwarted expectation I did not deserve\nto lose this game I should have won this\ngame because I was playing really well\nand this person didn't do what they were\nsupposed to do so I'm gonna get really\nreally really pissed off about it\nso if we look at what is the nature of\nunhealthy anger it is thwarted\nexpectation it is when we claim\nterritory right so I've claimed that\nthis is a win I should be winning here\nthis person should love me by now I\nshould get this promotion these are\nthings that I should have and that I am\nentitled or owed to owed and so when we\nthwart that expectation when that\nexpectation gets thwarted we lose this\nterritory that we believe we owned and\nthen we get really really pissed off\nso now the question kind of becomes okay\nhow do we deal with that right so first\nof all how do we tell if this is really\nmy territory or it's not my territory\nand in either case if I get upset how\nshould I deal with that so let's\nunderstand a little bit about the\nphysiology of anger so when we get angry\nand we get kind of kind of get this\nterritorial violation right whether it's\ntruly our territory or not which we'll\nget to our body engages in a whole\nphysiologic response so we activate\nsomething called the sympathetic nervous\nsystem so this is the part of our our\nbody that basically protects us causes\nus to engage in in battles so it sort of\nactivates our fight or flight response\nand in either case even if we're running\naway from things we still need our body\nto be very very focused and and have a\nton of energy right so when we get angry\nwe activate this part of our nervous\nsystem that prepares us for action in\nthe sympathetic nervous system does all\nkinds of other things cognitively so it\ncauses us to like be like really really\none-pointed so it becomes really hard to\nthink about other things it causes us to\nsee things in black and white so we\ndon't really like consider all these\nother things that may be relevant like\nlet's say I'm playing a video game and\neven if I played well maybe you know the\nreason that I'm having a good game is\nbecause my team has been making\nsacrifices for my sake and they haven't\nbeen making those sacrifices for my\nteammate's sake and that's why they're\nfeeding so there's all kinds of things\nthat we don't keep track of when our\nsympathetic nervous system is active we\nsort of get this tunnel vision and we\nsee in terms of black and white so one\nof the key things that we can do to get\ncontrol of our anger is to disable that\nsympathetic nervous system activation we\nactually want to shut down our\nadrenaline response at least temporarily\nand one of the simplest ways we can do\nthat is with breathing so if we look at\nlike sort of anger anger is a concerted\nphysiologic response right so we'll\nwe'll sort of release adrenaline\nadrenaline travels all through our body\nand activates all kinds of things it\nchanges the way that we think it even\ncauses us to clench our muscles changes\nour facial expression and very\nimportantly it changes our heart rate\nand our respiratory Rhythm so our heart\nrate starts going fast blood pressure\ngoes up in our respiratory rate changes\nas well right so I'm going to breathe in\nan angry way\nthat is the the pattern of angry\nbreathing so what can we do so this is\nwhat's really interesting if we change\nour pattern of breathing it will\nactually deactivate our sympathetic\nnervous system so if you look at the\nangry pattern of breathing it's rapid\ninhalation deep and rapid exhalation\nright\nso all we need to do to reduce our anger\nis to slow down our respiratory rate and\none of the simplest things that you can\ndo is just stop breathing for about 10\nseconds 15 seconds so just pause your\nbreath if you're feeling angry you can\nslow down your breathing so you can\nstretch out one breath to 10 seconds or\n12 seconds so six seconds in six seconds\nout or what what I found is really\neffective is you can just pause your\nbreathing for 10 seconds so hold your\nbreath and count to ten and then breathe\nslowly okay so that's one thing you can\ndo it'll literally change your\nphysiology your mind will become a\nlittle bit less like kind of tunnel\nvision you'll be able to like calm down\nand relax a little bit the other thing\nthat we're going to teach you is\noftentimes when we feel angry there's\nsomeone else involved\nand so one of the things that you can do\nis like literally tell that person that\nyou're feeling angry and take a step\nback from the situation so you can let's\nsay you're in an argument with someone\nor you're talking to your parents and\nthey're pissing you off or whatever you\ncan sort of or someone has just told you\nafter you've invested a year of your\nlife and getting them to fall in love\nwith you that they're dating someone\nelse\nyou can even just say to that person hey\nI'm feeling frustrated and angry right\nnow I need to take a a step back from\nthis conversation or this interaction\nyou literally said that hey I'm feeling\nfrustrated right now I need to take a\nstep back from this conversation okay\njust use those words and then if you can\ntake a step back if you're in a\nsituation where you can't really control\nthat like you're in the middle of a game\nright you can maybe mute them or just\nsay hey y'all I'm feeling kind of pissed\noff like I'm gonna go on mute for a few\nminutes to try to like Focus you know\nget my focus back\nor if you're in a situation at home\nwhere that doesn't work like you can't\nalways control that but you can just you\ncan still say it right so you can tell\nyour parents even hey I'm feeling really\nlike frustrated and angry and it's hard\nfor me to listen to you right now can I\nplease take a step away from this\nconversation and literally what you can\ndo is like leave the room and I've used\nthis actually in clinical settings as\nwell which is like you know if there's a\npatient who's like yelling at me when\nI'm trying to help them in the emergency\nroom sometimes first of all it's\nappropriate for me to be angry with them\nand this is something that I learned\nwhich is really bizarre right so I was\ntraining in residency at the time and\nlike there was a patient who was high on\ncocaine and was very abusive to the\nstaff I went in to try to help them they\nstarted cussing me out and using racial\nslurs and things like that and so I went\nand I talked to my attending here's a\nhealthy here's an example of healthy use\nof anger by the way so he goes and he\nsays he walks right in and says hey\nyou can't be doing this this is\ncompletely inappropriate you're in a\nhospital there are nurses here there are\ndoctors here everyone's here to help you\nthe police brought you in and instead of\ngoing to jail we are trying to help you\nso the way you're behaving is completely\ninappropriate we come in here over and\nover again to try to help you and you\njust yell at us\nso what we're gonna do is step out of\nthe room you can stay here as long as\nyou want to we'll check back in an hour\nor two hours or three hours and when\nyou're ready to talk to us you better do\nit in a polite way and if you're not\nready to talk to us in a polite way you\ncan you can stay here as long as you\nwant and then he stepped out of the room\nright and even when I've sort of talked\nwith patients who are very difficult\nI'll say hey I'm feeling kind of like\nfrustrated so I use that same technique\nsort of with this with people like that\nright where they're like yelling at you\nyou can kind of say hey like I'm feeling\nreally frustrated by this conversation\nI'm here to help you and I feel like I'm\nnot being heard you're not really\nlistening to what I'm saying I can also\nsee that you're feeling frustrated and\nthat people around here don't seem to be\nlistening to what you're saying so I\nneed to take a step away from this\nbecause you deserve to be listened to\nI'll be back in 15 minutes I hope we can\ncontinue the conversation that right and\nthen you just step out so acknowledge\nyour feeling of frustration or anger and\nunless you're in a real heavy power\nDynamic kind of situation step out of\nthe conversation and just give yourself\nthe opportunity to calm down so that\nthose are two things that you can do in\nthe moment to get control of your anger\nthe next thing that we have to talk a\nlittle bit about is the origins of\nunhealthy anger so if I have these\nthwarted expectations if I really want\nto fix that\nit's not just about managing the anger\nin the moment it's about why am I\ngetting into these situations in the\nfirst place and when I work with people\nwho are chronically angry\npissed off at life they're so mad about\nyou know this political party and\nthey're so bad about the government and\nthey're so mad about capitalism and\nthey're so metal but socialism and\nthey're so bad about men and they're so\nmad about women they're just mad about\neverything they're mad at this game at\nit this game at it this game what's\ngoing on with those people who are\nchronically angry\nthese people have inappropriate\nexpectations\nso this is what's really tricky is when\nwe get angry oftentimes the mindset that\nwe'll have is I deserve this right and\nsince I didn't get something that I\ndeserve I deserve to be angry and the\nangry anger is Justified but if you\nreally want to get control over anger\nit's not about what you deserve\nit's about what you expect\nso there are all kinds of people who\ndeserve all kinds of things but that\ndoesn't necessarily make them angry\nthe anger so and this is where like I\nwork with people who are you know 15\nyears old and have been diagnosed with\ncancer\nsome of them will get really angry but\nsome of them won't and they'll say I\ndon't deserve this it makes me sad it's\nunfortunate but I'm not going to get\npissed and tilt about it how do I move\nforward so even in those situations\nstuff happens all the time to people\nthat they don't deserve but they don't\nnecessarily get angry about it right\nit's okay to feel some amount of anger\nbut the key thing is if you want to stop\nbeing angry like all the time what you\nreally need to focus on is not what you\ndeserve but how did you come to expect\nthis\nand as we recognize that we will start\nto get a lot of long-term control over\nour anger so pay attention to instead of\nasking yourself what do I deserve ask\nyourself\nwhy did I expect this to happen right\nand that's where a lot of really really\nlike healing stuff starts to happen\nthat's where you start to get a lot of\ninsight into your own behavior into the\nbehavior of others why did I expect that\nthis person would date me because each\ntime I gave them something I wanted\nsomething in return but I never actually\nlet them know right I never actually\nwent out and asked them why did I expect\nto be promoted there are four people who\nare up for promotion why did I believe I\nwas entitled to this it's because I\nworked really hard well the other three\npeople may have worked really hard too\nright but what why did I think I\nexpected\nso this is where you really have to\nTunnel down into why you expect this in\nthe first place and this is what we try\nto really help people with especially in\nthings like career coaching is\nunderstand that what you expect and what\nyou do are two separate things and\nthere's a beautiful way to kind of think\nabout this which is that what we sort of\nencourage people to do is focus on the\nactions but don't expect a particular\noutcome so if you're working really hard\ntowards something don't do it in the\nexpectation that you're going to get\nsomething back so if you have a friend\nthat you're attracted to or if you have\na friend if you want to support them you\nshould support them because you think\nthat's the right kind of thing to do not\nbecause you want to be owed something in\nreturn and similarly at work that's the\nkind of situation I know this is like\nkind of weird and may even be\ncounterintuitive but if you want to go\nthe extra mile go the extra mile because\nyou want to learn something or because\nyou want to help the company and if they\nfail to recognize that that's on them\nso this is really important that if we\nreally want to get to the origins of\nthat unhealthy anger it comes from our\nexpectations and specifically from our\nsomewhat inappropriate expectations\nbecause in this world we can't control\nwhat other people do and the whole point\nof unhealthy anger is we are expecting\nsomeone else to do something we are\ntaking territory over someone else's\nbehavior and when they don't behave the\nway that they're supposed to they're\nfeeding they're not going out with me\nthey decided to promote someone else we\nget pissed but this is the key thing we\ncan't actually control that right we\ncan't make anyone fall in love with me I\ndon't get to determine every time I\nqueue up who's on my team right I don't\nget to determine what my who my boss\npicks to promote all I can control is my\nactions and so that's what you should\nreally focus on and so try to figure out\nokay where did I start to expect this\nwhy did I expect this how did this\nexpectation build up and as you go\nthrough that process what you'll start\nto discover is that some of the\nexpectations you have in life are a\nlittle bit inappropriate and as you\nstart to adjust your expectations now\nthis has nothing to do with what you\ndeserve or how much effort you put in\nthis is what's also a little bit tricky\nit's like I can I can work really hard\nand try to do a good job and still not\nexpect that something goes my way this\nis also something just to give you all\nan example of like the Nuance of this so\nas a doctor right I can go to work and I\ncan do a really good job and I can try\nmy hardest but I can't necessarily save\na life and that's what's so tricky is\nthat when we work really hard we think\noh I deserve to save this life or I did\neverything that they could why isn't\nthis person living it's just not how it\nworks so medicine teaches you how to\nwalk that tightrope really well which is\nthat in this life all you can do is like\ncontrol your actions but you can't\ncontrol how anyone else responds and the\nreally beautiful thing about this is as\nyou start to really focus on what you're\ndoing instead of expecting other people\nto behave in alignment with what you\nwant it actually frees up a ton of brain\nspace because instead of worrying about\nhow this other person is going to behave\nand how can I get them to do this and\nhow can I make sure I get promoted\ninstead of worrying about all this that\nkind of stuff I'm going to focus on my\nwork I'm going to focus on what makes me\nhappy I'm going to focus on how I want\nto live this life and if these people\nwant to recognize it the value in that\nthat's fine if they don't want to\nrecognize the value in it why do I want\nto waste my time being upset that\nsomeone doesn't recognize my value that\ndoesn't help me at all\nand so just to summarize anger is a\nreally tricky emotion it's a tricky\nemotion because first of all we demonize\nit as a society secondly it oftentimes\ncauses bad things to happen it sort of\nmakes us lose control and potentially\neven hurt people\nand the third thing that's like honestly\nreally tricky is everyone's like yeah\nanger is incredibly healthy like get in\ntouch with your anger but when we get in\ntouch with our anger like sometimes it\nkind of screws us right like we end up\nhurting people people don't talk to us\nanymore and even sort of getting in\ntouch with this healthy anger can\nsometimes cause us to lose control so\neven if people are saying okay yeah\nanger's healthy like you should get in\ntouch with the question is like how and\nthat's the key thing to understand is\nthat if we want to get in touch with our\nanger if we want to develop a healthy\nrelationship with anger we have to start\nby understanding what is healthy anger\nand what is unhealthy anger once we\nunderstand those two things that anger\nis a defensive mechanism designed to\nhelp us protect our territory\nand then we can understand okay when is\nanger appropriate when is it okay and\nwhen is it not okay\nthe last thing to consider is that in\neither case even if anger is appropriate\nand someone violates your boundary\nwe still want to be in control of it\nright and that's where we can use some\nof these things like breathing\ntechniques or even taking a step away\nbecause oftentimes we don't need to act\nthem and Bear right we can literally\nstep away for like five minutes or 10\nminutes or 15 minutes or a day or a week\nor whatever and then come back to the\nsituation and sort of channel that anger\nin a healthy way where you can say hey I\nreally think what you did was\ninappropriate and I consider it to be\nlike a violation of my boundaries I\nreally don't think it's fair or\nappropriate for you to behave this way\nwith me at all you can sort of feel that\nanger in there but don't let it get\ncontrol of you and then you can sort of\nlike lay a boundary with them right and\nso if you want to develop a healthy\nrelationship with anger start by\nunderstanding the difference between\nhealthy and unhealthy anger and then\nfurthermore employ some of these\ntechniques to really understand where\nyour expectations come from and even\nwhen you're feeling angry how to not let\nit control you"
