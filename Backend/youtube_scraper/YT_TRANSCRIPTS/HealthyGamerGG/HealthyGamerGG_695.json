    "video_title": "So What Is Dr. K's Guide to Mental Health?",
    "transcript": "all right so this is Dr K's guide so it\nstarted off as a thing in the middle\nthat we went off in different directions\nbut as it's grown we've had to like\nreshape it so we have four basic guides\nwe have anxiety depression meditation\nand ADHD so a big part of Dr K's guide\nis that it's not just about the illness\nit's about non-clinical perspectives on\nthe illness as a psychiatrist sometimes\npeople will come into my office and\nthey'll say I am depressed and then I\nwill do a clinical evaluation on them\nand then I'll determine that they do not\nmeet criteria for major depressive\ndisorder but what they actually have is\nlike an existential depression so\nthey're like directionless in life they\ndon't know what they want to do with\ntheir life and so as a clinician what\nI've had to learn how to do is I'll lean\non like my monk training in those\nsituations because I don't know that\nthey necessarily need like Psychotherapy\nfor like maladaptive thought patterns so\nwhat we try to do in Dr K's guide is\nbasically it's the way that I think\nabout about other human beings so when\nsomeone comes into my office what I\nbasically kind of do is like I have a\nbranching logic in my mind and let's\njust use the depression track as an\nexample the first thing is like are we\ntalking about clinical depression or\nnon-clinical so in the case of clinical\ndepression we'll teach a little bit\nabout Neuroscience we'll talk about\ndifferential diagnosis bipolar disorder\nor treatment principles and this is\nessentially education so it's not a\nsubstitute for treatment but this is the\nteaching that I do about these things to\nmy patients or other people so if I go\ngive a talk about depression or I'm\nteaching medical students about\ndepression this is the stuff that I'll\nshare with them but then for a lot of\npeople\nthere's non-clinical stuff too why do we\neven have negative emotions how do we\nunderstand negative emotions and then\nwhat we'll see is that some parts of the\nguide have like overlaps so is the\nSanskrit word for suffering so sometimes\nwhen people come into my office like\nthey have this almost spiritual\nsuffering\nthey don't know what they're doing in\ntheir life and how do we overcome that\nspiritual suffering how do we find\npurpose in life and then even if we go\ndown to negative emotions what we'll\nsort of do is we'll we'll teach some\nabout Vedic psychology so this is kind\nof like the yogic perspective on the\nmind and then what I've sort of found is\nthat people who come in and say I'm\ndepressed will often have these five\nkind of psychological complexes called\nsome scars so people will say oh I've\nfallen behind and if you guys were\npaying attention at the beginning of\nstream look at that there's actually a\nvideo for that another example is\nprotective hopelessness so we kind of\ntalked a little bit about that too so\nthat's just the depression track though\nso you can get that guide if you want\nand then in the ADHD guide for example\nwe talk about the clinical stuff right\nso we talk about what's this so someone\nwas asking are there features of ADHD so\nthat information is there this is not a\nsubstitute for diagnosis or treatment\nbut it's just the information it's what\nI would teach medical students which I\nthink patients should know by the way\nhow do I approach treatment for children\nwith ADHD what about treatment for\nadults with Ada HD and what about\nparenting a child with ADHD now this is\ndefinitely not treatment because this is\ntargeted towards parents they're not\neven the ones with the illness but what\ncan you know as a parent about ADHD if a\nloved one if my cousin for example had a\nkid who had ADHD this is what I would\nexplain to them and then we go into some\nof the clinical stuff like ADHD and\ndepression things like that but then a\nbig part that I'm really happy with is a\nbig part of the ADHD guide\nis the doing stuff path so it's Dr K's\nguide to ADHD and doing stuff and we\nwere struggling with the name for a\nwhile because it's like what is this and\nI was like okay this is a guide about\nlike if you don't know how to do stuff\nlike you want to do stuff but you can't\ndo stuff that's what this guide is about\nso it teaches us a lot about the science\nof thought\nso what do we need to know about the\nNeuroscience of motivation what do we\nneed to know about dopamine reward\ncircuitry and one of the biggest\nproblems that I see nowadays is everyone\nis talking about dopamine but they don't\nrealize that there's way more to the\nproblem it's almost as if your\nmotivation has a lot of different\ncomponents to it and one\nneurotransmitter cannot solve everything\ndo you think understanding permissive\ninfluences on motivation is really\nimportant I think so are you wondering\nwhat on Earth is permissive influence\nthat means that there are some things in\nyour life which will cause motivation to\nflourish and there are some things in\nyour life that will cause your\nmotivation to tank and as you think\ncritically about that like my friend\nwho's gonna come over and we're going to\nget high and we're going to play League\nof Legends all night what do you think\nthat friend does for you the next day\nright so the motivation is complex so we\ngot tons of people who use the guide and\nthey're like hey how do I give this to\nSomeone Like You Can't and then our devs\nstarted working on it because people\nwere like how do we get the Guide so if\nyou guys know someone one who could\nbenefit from this stuff you can gift it\nnow the problem with all of our twitch\nand YouTube content is that it's\nStandalone so the most you can ever get\nis like surface the whole advantage of\nthe guide is that you can go Way Beyond\nsurface\n[Music]\nforeign"
