    "transcript": "so one of the things that we have to\nlearn as psychiatrists and something\nthat I really focus on teaching is that\nyour responsibility is to help not to\nfix often times what we find in people\nwho are empathic is that they don't do\nthis right they're checking up on their\nfriend they're texting them every day\nand then what paradoxically happens is\nthat your friend stops being responsible\nfor their life because you are taking on\nall of the responsibility as you take on\nall of the responsibility you start\nsiphoning their burnout into yourself so\nwe need a way to limit or regulate our\nemotions when we're empathic with\nsomeone best way is as we said just\nlimiting what you sign up for and this\nmental shift will be incredibly helpful\nbut then we can also do a lot of\nstandard emotional regulation techniques\njournaling going for walks self-care\nright we're not getting so caught up in\ntheir stuff that we start neglecting\nourselves it's time to set limits with\nthem take care of ourselves meditate eat\nhealthy go for a walk pet your cat\nwhatever it is that you do play some\nvideo games go for it"
