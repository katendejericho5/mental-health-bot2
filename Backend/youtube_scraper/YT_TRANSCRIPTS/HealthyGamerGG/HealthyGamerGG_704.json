    "transcript": "a lot of times the reason that people\nhate their jobs is because they're not\nrecognized in their jobs the effort that\nthey put in is not appreciated they have\ntrouble advocating for themselves and\npeople are playing politics sometimes\nit's because the job is really really\nreally boring and even in those cases\nwhy don't those people quit those jobs\nwell because they're afraid of the\nconsequences of quitting a job what if I\ndon't find another job what if people\nwon't hire me somewhere else so even if\nyou look at each of those scenarios\nabout why we hate the job what we\nactually discover is that it's not the\njob itself that actually keeps you stuck\nit's all of your attachments related to\nthe job it's wanting to be appreciated\nby your boss wanting to be recognized\nwanting to be respected by your peers\nwhich by the way is what leads you to\nwork extra hard to get that recognition\nso any way you cut it what you really\ndiscover is that attachment and ego are\nreally the things that kind of hold us\nback in life"
