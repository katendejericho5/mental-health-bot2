    "transcript": "so imagine what your life would be like\nif you were not always trying to shape\nand control other people's perceptions\nof you because that's what a lot of\nanxiety turns into this is how people\nbecome doormats I can't afford to have\nthis person dislike me and since I can't\nafford to have this person dislike me I\ncan never set a boundary with them since\nI never set a boundary with them I\nbecome a doormat and they start to\nbecome abusive because I don't check\ntheir behavior there's never a\nconsequence for their behavior and then\nthe anxious person gets stuck they\nbecome frustrated with themselves they\nbecome frustrated with the other person\nbut they don't know what to do about it\nand so the real antidote to all the\nstuff at the end of the day is\nDetachment is to separate yourself a\nlittle bit from the ego okay so this\nperson dislikes me so what right and\nthis is what people may tell you why do\nyou care about what this person thinks\nand you're like I don't know I wish I\ncouldn't but I do and then how do you\nsolve that how do you develop that\nattachment you go back\ndetachment you go back when did I learn\nthat I cannot afford to piss anyone off"
