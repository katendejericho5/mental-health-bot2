    "transcript": "if stress is what's motivating our\naction how on Earth are we supposed to\nfeel a sense of accomplishment when it's\ndone so think about the times in your\nlife when you feel accomplished stress\ncan have something to do with it but\nit's usually like something that you set\nout to do the first thing to understand\nis that if you're motivated through\nstress and procrastination the natural\nthing is that you're going to end up\nwith a sense of relief instead of a\nsense of accomplishment what are you\nexpecting so other people you may look\naround with other people who are like\nhigh-fiving each other because yeah like\nI crushed the exam fantastic those\npeople weren't super stressed before\nthey started the exam so even though you\nstudied hard and you should feel proud\nof yourself the question is what was the\ndriver of the original motivation and\nyour internal motivation is going to\ndetermine whether you end up feeling\nrelief or accomplished"
