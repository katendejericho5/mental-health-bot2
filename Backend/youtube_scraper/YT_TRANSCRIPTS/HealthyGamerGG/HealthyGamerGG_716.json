    "transcript": "today we're going to talk a little bit\nabout anxiety and by the end of the\nlecture I'd love to equip you with some\nbasic understanding of anxiety starting\nwith what is anxiety how does it form\nhow does it manifest in the present and\nhow to approach it\nthe truth of the matter is that anxiety\nis getting worse at an alarming rate and\nthis video is for three kinds of people\nthe first is it's for people who may\nhave gotten treatment for anxiety but\nare looking to better understand the\nproblem or kind of improve what they can\ndo about it the second thing is that\nthis is a video for people who may have\ntried anxiety treatment but found that\nit didn't really work for them very well\nand we're going to dive into a little\nbit about why that could be and the\nthird thing is this is a video for\npeople who just want to understand\nanxiety who may not need to engage in\ntreatment aren't really interested in it\nmaybe it's not that severe and you just\nwant to understand a little bit about\nhow this stuff works within you hey\nthere thanks for watching and I'm glad\nthese videos have been helpful a lot of\ntimes I'll read the comments and see\npeople asking well what do I actually do\nabout it which is a great question and\nunfortunately the resources out there\nhaven't been that great which is\nprecisely why I started HD in the first\nplace HG coaches are trained on a\ncurriculum that integrates my\nunderstanding of what motivates us what\nparalyzes us and most importantly what\nleads to Lasting behavioral change if\nyou're ready to take the next step HG\ncoaches can help you build the life that\nyou want they've helped people build\ncareers help people find relationships\nbuild networks of friends and even do\nthings like discover their passions or\npursue Hobbies so if this sounds like\nsomething that you'd be interested in\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow so let's start by understanding a\nlittle bit about what we know already\nand also what we've learned recently\nso the biggest problem that I see today\nwith anxiety is that we view it as a\nmental condition and there's kind of\nlike a good reason for this right so if\nwe look at our initial explorations of\nanxiety in the west they were done by\npeople like psychoanalysts so people\nlike Freud and Jung would talk to other\npeople and understood anxiety as a\nprocess of the mind and they're not\nwrong right so based on a lot of the\ndiscoveries they made and some of those\nwe'll share with you all today really\nsolid stuff we've developed treatment\nprotocols like cognitive behavioral\ntherapy or psychodynamic therapy that\nactually statistically improve people's\nexperience of anxiety so that's great\nit's like kind of a mental thing\nthe challenge though is that a lot of\nrecent research that we've discovered\nshows that anxiety is not localized to\nthe mind and this sort of like makes\nsense if you stop and think about it we\nas human beings are like whole organisms\nright and our brain exists within our\nbody and even the functions of our mind\ncan be influenced by what's going on in\nour brain and even be influenced by\nwhat's going on in our body so I think\none of the reasons that we're seeing\nanxiety get worse despite the fact that\nwe're spending more money on Research\ndespite the fact that we are training a\nbunch of therapists despite the fact\nthat we're like investing a lot in brain\nscience and all this kind of stuff like\nwhy is anxiety getting worse it's\nbecause the professionals that usually\ndeal with anxiety are specialized in the\nmind right so if you look at a therapist\nor psychologist chances are they're not\na medical doctor but they're someone\nwho's focused entirely on the mind which\nis not necessarily a bad thing I'm not\nit's not an indictment to therapist and\nlet's remember that they have effective\nmethods right we have effective methods\nbut their education is lacking in\ncertain major areas that we've actually\ndiscovered now contribute to anxiety\nlike the heart and autonomic nervous\nsystem and even stuff like brain gut\nstuff and gut microbiome so we're going\nto be diving into that\nso this is why I think even we've had a\nlot of people in our community who have\ngone to see therapists and this is\nwhat's kind of frustrating right is if\nsomeone complains about anxiety on the\ninternet people say go see a therapist\nand that is a great move don't get me\nwrong I'm all for it you should\nabsolutely do it if you've never done it\nbefore but also that some people don't\nthat doesn't seem to help some people or\ndoesn't help them enough\nand so that's why we're going to be\ntalking about sort of a start to finish\nperspective on anxiety\nso let's start by understanding what\nanxiety is\nso anxiety is essentially a heightened\nBaseline of worry around projected\nthreats\nso generally speaking our mind and our\nbody has a whole system that is designed\nto respond to threats okay and this is\nwhere like our adrenaline is going to\nincrease our heart rate is going to\nincrease we're going to change we're\ngoing to make changes to our gut so\nthere's all kinds of changes that our\nbody and brain and mind are going to\nmake any time we're faced with a\nstressor\nso the real challenge with anxiety is\nthat what is a true stress what is an\nactual stress and what is a perceived\nstress is messed up\nso whereas 99 people may think this is\nsomething that you don't need to worry\nabout your brain is telling you hey this\nis a real threat\nso the first thing to understand about\nanxiety is it it is a heightened\nawareness or a heightened emphasis on\npotential threats and so for a normal\nperson what they may experience is\nthey're not worried about it because the\npossibility of it happening is like\npretty low so I don't need to stress out\nabout stuff that like may not happen\nright if you struggle with anxiety\nyou're gonna think that that's like\nabsolutely insane you have to think\nabout everything that may not happen\nbecause that is how you avoid those\nnegative situations and protect yourself\nso if that's something you resonate with\nthat is the Crux of anxiety there are\nreal threats that our body responds to\nbrain responds to mind response to and\nthen there are these perceived threats\nand the problem is that people with\nanxiety move the perceived threats into\nthe real threat column and so everything\nfeels like a real danger and our body\nand our brain and our mind respond\naccordingly and they tell us to freak\nout so let's understand how that\ncalibration gets messed up\nso most people with anxiety have some\nkind of negative experience in childhood\nthat teaches them to be worried so\nanxiety is a problem in adulthood or\nmaybe adolescence but at its core it's\nactually a survival strategy or an\nadaptation\nso let's kind of put ourselves in the\nshoes of a five-year-old or a\nsix-year-old right so this is a\nfive-year-old or six-year-old that maybe\nhas an alcoholic parent\nso how does the five-year-old survive in\nthis situation they have to think about\nthe parent a lot right because what are\nyour tools as a five-year-old can you\ncreate physical space are you\nfinancially independent can you adjust\nyour diet can you create sort of like\nboundaries around how you manage your\nemotions can you use a meditation app to\nmanage your emotions can you effectively\ncommunicate using words and theory of\nmind and empathy to calm people down of\ncourse not you can't do any of that all\nyou can do is think how can I survive\nso when your parent comes home and\nthey're drunk what are all the things\nthat you can think through all the\npossibilities of how you're going to\ndeal with if they're feeling like this\nif they're feeling like this if they're\nfeeling like this I gotta clean up my\nroom before they come home so they don't\nget pissed off right so you start to\nthink and engage in behaviors to try to\nadapt to the circumstance\nand so what you learn as a five-year-old\nand remember this is like the part of\nour the time where our brain is like\nlearning the fundamentals of how the\nworld works so we're learning things\nlike how does gravity work right so how\nstrong is gravity how are relationships\nformed how do I deal with challenges and\nwhat anxious kids discover is that the\nway that I deal with challenges is I\nthink about it a lot\nand I will think about it so I can\nfigure out how to best adapt to it\nbecause fundamentally I cannot change\nthe outward problem I just have to think\nmy way to success\nthis is the Crux of how anxiety is born\nthese kids then carry that into\nadulthood so how do I approach problems\ndo I approach problems through\ncommunication do I approach problems\nthrough boundary setting no if I have a\nproblem I am going to think through it\nuntil I figure out what is the best way\nto solve it because that's the only\nthing that works and remember that these\nfive-year-olds this works for them right\nthis is why anxiety is so hard to kick\nis because when you're five you have no\npower but what goes on in your head all\nyou the only option you've got is to\nthink through a thousand scenarios and\nthink about how you're going to handle\neach one and then when your mom or dad\ncomes home that's when you activate some\nplan but fundamentally you are not in\ncontrol and so you have to plan for\ncontingencies and this is what happens\nin the mind of someone who's anxious\nso now let's bring that person to\nadulthood what's the strategy that your\nbrain learned when you were learning how\nto walk and when you were learning how\nto talk what else did you learn you\nlearned that if there is a problem out\nthere fundamentally I can't fix the\nproblem\nso what I have to do is deal with it\nright and the more that I think about it\nthe more effective my strategies will be\nand this is where people who are anxious\nwill oftentimes invest a ton of energy\nfor even a tiny amount of control or a\ntiny amount of improvement it's\nfundamentally not a good trade but it's\nthe only trade that their brain learned\nhow to make\nso now you're thinking about all these\nscenarios and you even recognize as an\nanxious person that thinking about this\ndoesn't help and yet you do it anyway\nwhy is that it's because that's what\nyour brain learned how to do\nwhen your brain developed this strategy\nwhen it learned how to play the game it\nhad the power and abilities of a\nfive-year-old and so that's the only\nstrategy it knows how to do and this is\nwhat's so damn confusing about anxiety\nnot only for the person who's\nexperienced anxiety anxiety for for the\npeople around you they're like why don't\nyou just dot dot dot\nwhy don't you just talk to your boss\nwhy don't you just email your professor\nand ask him for an extension\nit's so confusing right and you may be\nbe beating yourself up because all\nyou're doing is thinking about it\ninstead of actually doing anything about\nit and you're incredibly frustrated by\nyourself other people are frustrated\nwith you and they make it seem so easy\nand then you feel terrible about\nyourself because you're like why can't I\ndo this\nit's a really good question it's because\nyour brain learned that doing stuff\ndoesn't work\nyour brain learned one survival\nmechanism which is think it through and\nadapt to whatever crap comes your way\nand this also can become a\nself-fulfilling prophecy because as you\ndo less about it right if you don't\nemail your professor if you don't have a\nconversation with your boss problems\nwill arise and as problems arise your\nworst fears become true but now since\nyou've been anxiously thinking about it\nyou're kind of okay at doing damaging\ndamage control and then what is the\nconclusion that your mind comes to your\nmind is like thank God we spent all of\nthat time thinking through every single\npermutation and combination because when\nour professor did email us and say Hey\nwhere's your paper what's wrong why I\nhaven't received it yet you had\neverything planned\nand planning leads to survival\nso this is the way that the anxious\nbrain works it reaches a new level of\nhomeostasis which is that it starts to\nsee greater threats and tries to\napproach problems\npurely mentally and this is explains\nkind of the experience of people with\nanxiety which is why you can sit in bed\nand do nothing to solve your problems\nand anxiously be thinking about it over\nand over and over and over again so\nthat's things from a mental perspective\nand we'll get into a little bit more\nabout how to deal with that and\ntherapists can absolutely help with that\nokay but there are a couple of other\nthings that I think we need to explore\nthe first is that our cardiovascular and\nautonomic nervous system so this is the\nsystem that governs things like\nadrenaline relaxation you know danger\nsignals this system is very very active\nwhen it comes to anxiety and so a big\npart of what we do especially as medical\ndoctors is we'll try to medicate anxiety\ngenerally speaking most of our\nmedications have been neurologic in\nnature so they affect the brain but\nwe're starting to see a lot of really\ninteresting research around non-anxiety\nmedications for anxiety things that\naffect your heart rate things that\naffect your immune system can also be\nbeneficial for people with anxiety so\nlet's understand how this works\nthis is really cool our heart adapts to\nchanges okay so if you are walking down\nthe street and you get jumped by a pack\nof wolves your heart rate will increase\nour body responds to that change it\nAlters the way that it reacts to a\nparticular environment so our heart rate\ngoes up okay when we're in a relaxed\nsituation our heart rate goes down our\nbody is able to adapt\nto particular stresses\nin people who are anxious that\nadaptation ability is weakened so what\nwe sort of see is that things are always\non kind of high alert so we see less\nvariation in the body's ability to adapt\nto a stressor because we're already\noperating at high levels of stress at\nBaseline and why are we operating at\nhigh levels of stress at Baseline that's\nbecause we learned as a five-year-old\nthat the world is a dangerous place\nand we can't count on other people we\nhave to be on high alert all the time\nhyper vigilance is a survival strategy\nand that gets baked in to our neurons\nnot just neurons in the brain but\nneurons all over the body our body's\nability to adjust its heart rate in\nresponse to stress is blunted in people\nwith anxiety\nso we also see this in cases of things\nlike PTSD so if you look at the heart's\nability to modulate its activity after\nyou get diagnosed with PTSD your ability\nto modulate activity goes down you are\nalways on high alert\nthere's other really interesting things\nthat people have been able to discover\nso some people some researchers have\nalso been able to predict which emotion\nyou are feeling by looking at your heart\nrhythm they can predict with 75 accuracy\nthe way that your heartbeat determines\nyour emotion they figured this out okay\n75 accuracy we're not 100 of the way\nthere yet but we're pretty good at that\nso this is where we start to see a whole\nother realm of consideration about\nanxiety which is that when you're\nphysiologically active it's going to\nchange the way that you think because\nremember our body and brain are moving\nin concert it's not like the mind is\ncompletely disconnected from the heart\nlike those two things work together so\nwe know for example that adrenaline\ncauses perceived threats to become and\nfeel more real it causes a focusing of\nthe mind on the particular threat so\nwhat what do we see in anxiety\nclinically we see distractibility it's\nnot distractibility you're not\ndistracted you can't focus on what you\nwant to focus on because your mind is\nhell-bent on focusing on anxiety it\nforces you to focus on the the threat\nand this is physiologically mediated\nso if we can control our heart rate and\nif we can control our autonomic nervous\nsystem we will reduce our anxiety\nthe third angle that a lot of people are\nnot really familiar with especially when\nit comes to therapists and this isn't an\nindictment on them it's just they're not\ntrained in that right because we're just\nlearning this stuff\nis gut health\nso this is super wild but the bacteria\nin our gut heavily influence our anxiety\nlevel\nso there are a lot of different\nmechanisms at play here the first is\nthat people with irritable bowel\nsyndrome also have some degree of\ndepression and anxiety we also see cases\nlike inflammatory bowel disease which is\nwhen you get an autoimmune inflammation\nof your intestines\nwhen people have autoimmune inflammation\nof their intestines they're they also\nexperience worsening depression and\nanxiety\nso we've also discovered that depression\nand anxiety are to a certain degree\ninflammatory conditions\nsince their inflammatory conditions this\nis wild if I take a patient with IBD\ninflammatory bowel disease and I give\nthem an immunomodulatory agent I\nliterally like kind of shot off or\nsuppress their immune system their\nanxiety improves\nyou see clinically significant\nscientifically valid results of anxiety\nreduction when I modulate someone's\nimmune system\nwhat is going on there\nlet's understand okay so we have guts we\nhave our gut bacteria okay got our\nintestines and stuff and in our\nintestines we have a lot of bacteria\nthat live there and hang out there by\nthe way you have 10 times as many\nbacterial cells in your body as you have\nhuman cells okay that's wild so you\nactually the number of cells in your\nbody is like nine to one ten to one\nbacteria to human cells so you've got a\nton of bacteria in there now let's\nunderstand what are these bacteria doing\nso we have a symbiotic relationship with\nthose bacteria so over a million years\n10 million years whatever\nwe've grown up as human beings\nand we have all this bacteria that live\nin our gut and the bacteria does stuff\nfor us so bacteria will do things like\nbreak down food that's why it lives in\nour gut they'll do things like consume\nparticular nutrients and they will also\nproduce particular nutrients because we\nhave a nice relationship with our\nbacteria right they're going to live in\nthe gut and they're going to Farm\nnutrients for us and we are going to\nprovide them with some degree of\nprotection and whatnot there's some\nbacteria which are healthy bacteria\nwhich do not activate our immune system\nbecause our immune system is learned hey\nthese are our allies we should not\nmess with them right they're helping us\nso now what has changed the most in our\nsociety over the last hundred years diet\ndiet has transformed completely Twinkies\ndid not exist a hundred years ago right\nyou didn't get all those different kinds\nof food we didn't have frozen food or\nanything like that we just ate what was\nfresh we ate what was around we had a\nvery limited kind of food\nso then what happens is once we start\neating different food what happens to\nour gut bacteria\nso as we make dietary changes like let's\nsay I eat a piece of broccoli so\nbroccoli can be broken down and consumed\nby certain kinds of bacteria and those\nare the commensurate bacteria those are\nthe bacteria that help us out so they\nbreak down the broccoli because human\nbeings have been eating broccoli for a\nwhile right we've been eating like green\nleafy stuff and foraging and whatnot\npotatoes and things like that a little\nbit of meat whatever\nand so we we will grow the bacteria\ndepending on what we feed them\nso now as we eat more processed foods\nwe are selecting for the bacteria\nthat can eat processed foods and so have\nthose bacteria been in our guts for a\nmillion years absolutely not these are\nnew bacteria they're foreign bacteria\nthey're the twinkie eating bacteria so\nas we develop these Twinkie eating\nbacteria in our guts they cause\ninflammation because this is our body's\nlike hey like we've never seen this\nbacteria before this guy doesn't belong\nhere let's attack it\nso as we increase the inflammation in\nthe gut\nthat inflammation travels all the way to\nthe brain right because when we have an\ninfection if I have like a cold let's\nsay and even the cold is localized to my\nnose I feel the inflammation all over my\nbody the fever if I've got like the flu\nor something like that is going to be\nall over our body so our body will\nrespond in a complete way in a total way\nin a holistic way to even inflammation\nwithin the gut there's also now evidence\nthat certain kinds of bacteria have been\nlinked to Parkinson's disease\nAlzheimer's disease as well as anxiety\nand we'll get to that in a second\nso gut bacteria become really important\nnext thing to understand gut bacteria\nwill produce things and consume things\nthat we put into our body\nso what does this mean\nso we know that as psychiatrists we will\nprescribe serotonergic medications to\nhelp people with anxiety we will\nincrease serotonin signal in the brain\nwith medication\nso what about gut bacteria so this is\nreally fascinating there are some kinds\nof gut bacteria that will gobble up\nthe serotonin precursors so there are\ncertain neurotransmitters there are\ncertain building blocks that's where\nthey come from right that come travel\nfrom our gut to our brain and then we\nturn those building blocks into things\nlike neurotransmitters like dopamine\nserotonin Etc there are some bacteria\nthat will gobble those up so if they're\ngobbling it up there is not enough\nbuilding blocks going to the brain to\nmake serotonin or whatever else there\nare other bacteria that not only don't\ngobble it up but will produce excess and\nshare it with us this is a trading\nsituation where we give you food in a\nsafe place to stay and you are going to\nproduce neurotransmitter precursors for\nus building blocks you're going to send\nthem to the brain and we're going to\nturn them into neurotransmitters\nso as a clinician when I work with\npatients with anxiety the ones that are\nable to adhere to an anti-anxiety diet\nare the ones that I can bring off of\nmedication way more easy I'll start\nsomeone on an anti-anxiety medication\nlike an SSRI if they adhere to good diet\nfor about a year and I pull them off of\nthe SSRI they do fine it's the ones that\naren't able to adhere to the diet that\nhave more problems on average\nso what is our gut bacteria doing for us\nthree things one is the good bacteria is\nproducing neurotransmitters for us\nbasically and it's not causing\ninflammation and the ones that are bad\nfor us are consuming the building blocks\nthat we need\nand furthermore are causing inflammation\nand remember that what is inflammation\ngoing to do to your heart it's going to\nelevate your heart rate as inflammation\nelevates your heart rate that is going\nto send signals to your brain to make\nyou more anxious\nwild right and this is the shortcoming\nis that we don't understand this stuff\nin clinical practice we haven't really\nimplemented it yet\nso just to give you all an example there\nis one bacteria that I I kid you not is\ncalled ruminococcus\nI have no idea how where that name came\nfrom I looked for it it is literally\ncalled ruminococcus rumination\nand when ruminococcus levels are low in\nthe gut bacteria anxiety is high the\nseverity of anxiety increases more\npeople if you have low ruminococcus\nlevels chances are\nyou will have anxiety\nright it's wild there are four or five\nother bacteria that are very focused on\nanxiety okay or related to anxiety the\nlast thing that we're going to talk\nabout maybe second to last is the mind\nso when it comes to the mind there's a\nlot that you can do here there's also\nwhere seeing a therapist is a really\ngood idea but let's understand what the\napproach in therapy is okay especially\nfor those of you all that feel like okay\nmy anxiety isn't that bad that I need to\nsee a therapist but I still want to get\ncontrol of it this is important to\nunderstand so the first thing that\nyou've got to do is understand\nthe wiring of your brain in terms of\nwhat is a threat so go back and this is\nwhy a lot of therapy focuses on\nchildhood what are the lessons that you\nlearned in childhood so in The Vedic\nmodel like this is the model that our\ncoaches use when they're sort of trying\nto promote Wellness we'll sort of focus\non the formation of something called a\nsamskar\nso a samskar is like a ball of energy\nthat shapes the way a ball of emotional\nenergy that shapes the way that you\nperceive the world\nokay\nso when we have a samskar it like it\ntriggers this activity in our brain that\ncauses us to perceive things as threats\nbut that is all based on this ball of\nemotional energy\nso if you go back and you actually pay\nattention to your experiences in\nchildhood you will find that even\nthinking about them will cause tears to\ncome up we'll evoke fear and we'll evoke\nPanic that means that that emotion is\nsitting there in your brain in your mind\nand is shaping the way that you see the\nworld\nso you have to go back and ask yourself\nokay I am let's say you're anxious about\na particular thing I'm worried that\npeople will abandon me let's say\nwhere did you learn to be afraid that\npeople will abandon you chances are it's\nbecause you had some kind of traumatic\nexperience in childhood where someone\nabandoned you and so then your brain\nlearned hey we can't trust people\nand so you carry that learning with you\nforward to the present day the problem\nis it helped you survive back then now\nit makes your life hard today so you\nhave to go back and digest that\nemotional energy\nthe second thing that you can do is\nunderstand the effect of the anxiety in\nthe present and now we have to\nunderstand something really important\nabout anxiety\nwhen someone is faced with anxiety as we\nexperience more anxiety\nwhat people with anxiety do is this\nanxiety is caused by a situation right\nother people may not believe that it's\nreal but that's neither here nor there\nand so what do you do as someone who's\nanxious you try to control the situation\nbecause if you control the situation\nyour anxiety will come down anyway\nI'm afraid someone is going to break up\nwith me\nthey could break up with me this is a\nreal situation my anxiety is high how do\nI fix this\nI'm going to get them to promise never\nto break up with me\nI'm going to engage in behaviors to\nbring down to control the situation\nbecause if I can control the situation\nthen the anxiety will come with it you\nsee these two things are tied\nand so what do people with anxiety do\nthey try to control the world around\nthem\ncontrolling the world around you is\ndifficult arguably impossible\nand if you can't control your partner or\nyour boss or your professor or your\nfriends or your parents\nwhat do you do you keep trying in your\nhead over and over and over again and\nwhy do you never solve your problems\nyou never solve the problems because\nit's someone else you can't control\nanother human being then why don't you\nquit why do you keep trying to solve the\nproblem because that is the survival\nmechanism that you learned\nright that is anxiety in a nutshell\nso we try to control the circumstances\naround us we try to control other people\nto bring our anxiety down that's a\nlosing formula\nbut that's what we do so what else can\nyou do\nthere are two or three things to\nunderstand here one is that we can\ndisconnect this safe situation low\nanxiety dangerous situation high anxiety\nwe can control this disconnect we can\nactually be like this where our anxiety\ncan be high in the situation to be safe\nor the situation you can feel unsafe and\nwe don't actually have to control it to\ntolerate our own anxiety\nwe can learn how to tolerate anxiety\nbecause this is what people with anxiety\ndon't learn how to do right because what\nthey learn is a survival mechanism is as\na five-year-old you can't teach yourself\nto tolerate anxiety you just have to\ndeal with it\nso what you can practically do is learn\nhow to tolerate some of these anxieties\nso this is where if you look at like\nevidence-based treatment for phobias for\nexample what therapists will do is\nexposure therapy so we're going to put\nyou in a situation that activates your\nanxiety but we're not going to let you\ncontrol the situation\nyou're just going to wait until your\nbody returns to homeostasis which it\nwill do\nwhy doesn't that happen in people with\nanxiety because we spend so much time\ntrying to control the situation escape\nfrom the situation that we never develop\nthe ability for tolerance\nright if a social situation makes me\nanxious and I decide to avoid it what\nhappens to my ability to tolerate\nnegative emotion it goes down because\nI'm controlling the situation and since\nthe situation is controlled my anxiety\nis controlled\nI never learned tolerance\nso this is where I would say sit with it\nand understand exactly what you are\nsitting with it's hard to just sit with\nit but understand this is what you\nshould tell yourself\nin this moment my mind is terrified of\nthis this feels a hundred percent real\nnotice your physical\nSensations\nright this is my body trying to protect\nme from this\nand this is a reaction that my body\nlearned if you've done some scar\noriented worker therapy you can even go\nback and you say this is how my body\nlearned to survive here and tolerate it\nfor as long as you can\nright start low okay I'm going to go\ninto the social situation for five\nminutes and I'm not going to pull out my\nphone for five minutes\nand then afterward you can escape into\nyour phone go for it right so start to\nlearn how to tolerate that negative\nemotion as you learn to tolerate the\nnegative emotion the negative emotion\nwill start to come down as the negative\nemotion starts to come down you will be\nable to engage with things around you\nokay\nthe last thing to consider kind of\nrelated to this is watch out for the tie\nbetween your anxiety and your behavior\nso when we are anxious especially if we\nhave if we have an unhealthy\nrelationship with anxiety we are going\nto use Behavior to control our anxiety\nright so I will plead with someone not\nto break up with me or I'll start crying\nor I'll avoid things\nso watch out for that instinctive\nreaction of behavior to make yourself\nfeel safe and try not to engage in it\nright away this is also a central\nprinciple of cognitive behavioral\ntherapy so if you need help with that\nwork with a therapist\nthe last thing and this is a little bit\noff the wall but this has honestly\nhelped a lot of people that I've worked\nwith\nis to detach\nso if you really look at anxiety anxiety\nusually has to do with the ego and what\ndo I mean by that I'm opening a whole\nnew can of worms which we can do a whole\nnew video about but\nif you think about anxiety the\nconsequence always has to do with you\nthis person won't like me this person\nwill think I'm stupid this person won't\nrespect me this person won't give me\nopportunities this person will break up\nwith me\nanxiety is usually about sometimes it\ncan be around things like health related\nstuff like you know other kinds of fears\nand stuff but a lot of times it has to\ndo with ego it has to do with I in some\nway\nand so there's another process which is\nits own thing of detachment\nwhere you sort of separate yourself from\nthe ego\nand so what if someone doesn't like you\nso imagine what your life would be like\nif you were not always\ntrying to shape and control other\npeople's perceptions of you\nbecause that's what a lot of anxiety\nturns into this is how people become\ndoormats\nI can't afford to have this person\ndislike me and since I can't afford to\nhave this person dislike me I can never\nset a boundary with them since I never\nsat around with them I become a doormat\nand they start to become abusive\nbecause I don't check their behavior\nthere's never a consequence for their\nbehavior and then the anxious person\ngets stuck they become frustrated with\nthemselves they become frustrated with\nthe other person but they don't know\nwhat to do about it\nand so the real antidote to all the\nstuff at the end of the day is\ndetachment\nis to separate yourself a little bit\nfrom the ego and okay so this person\ndislikes me\nso what\nright and this is what people may tell\nyou why do you care about what this\nperson thinks and you're like I don't\nknow I wish I couldn't but I do\nand then how do you solve that how do\nyou develop that attachment you go back\ndetachment you go back\nwhen did I learn that I cannot afford to\npiss anyone off\nthat's the samskar that is controlling\nyou that is preventing the detachment\nonce again there are practices that you\ncan do right meditative practices\nspiritual practices things like that\ncan help you develop Detachment we have\na whole path on that in in Dr K's guide\nto meditation so but for you all to\nunderstand this is also where there's\nstudies that show that spiritual\nperspectives to anxiety can be\nincredibly helpful one of the mechanisms\nthrough which things like mindfulness\nand even some of the the studies on\npsychedelics show that the mechanism of\naction here is that they separate you\nfrom your ego and so that's another\naspect to consider\nso if you're trying to deal with anxiety\nI know it's a super challenging and\noverwhelming topic but my hope is that\nif you understand how anxiety develops\nand what the mechanisms are in the in\nthe body and the brain and the mind that\nyou can develop a system to kind of\ntackle it\nif you're already working with a mental\nhealth professional My Hope Is that you\ncan integrate some of the stuff into\nyour existing treatment\nif you're not working with a mental\nhealth professional I strongly recommend\nyou get an evaluation and then you can\nalso if you don't need to then you can\nalso use some of these techniques to\npromote Health right and this is another\ncore problem with our system of medicine\nin the west is that we treat sickness we\ndon't build health\nand so how does anxiety work in the body\nand in the brain first of all it is a\nlearned experience it is a change in\nyour Baseline\nto perceive normal things as highly\nthreatening why did you learn that how\ndid you get wired like that because\nthat's what you needed to survive\nso how can we fix this problem\nthe first is we can change our diet we\ncan eat certain foods healthy diet\nthings that are more traditionally eaten\nby human beings so like you know this is\nwhere a lot of that sort of like keto\ndiet sort of comes in it's not so much\ngrains that's necessarily a problem it's\nthat a lot of these grains are processed\nwhich we didn't grow up eating\nso there's a lot of details also on diet\ny'all can check out Dr K's guide\nbut you can also think about some of\nthose probiotics and things like that\ndefinitely something to consider but the\nmore inflammation in your gut there is\nthe less healthier your gut bacteria is\nthe more likely you are to be anxious\nsecond organ system we're going to talk\nabout is the heart the heart is\nincredibly important it's not just the\nheart by the way the heart is just the\none thing that we use to measure and\ncapture all the other parts of our body\nso if we look at the exercise benefits\non anxiety we're just focusing on the\nheart but exercise is going to have\nbenefits on the kidneys which are going\nto affect your anxiety it's going to\nhave benefits on your liver your\nskeletal muscle all of these things will\naffect your anxiety and this is the core\nshortcoming that we see with therapy\ntoday is that therapists are solely\ntrained in the mind but anxiety does not\nsolely exist in the mind\nso you can do everything from heart\nchakra meditations to exercise\nyou got to slow down that physiology\nand the last thing that we're going to\nfocus on is the mind and that where\nthat's where you have to understand how\ndid I program this in the first place go\nback to that digest that emotion because\nthat will be driving your anxiety you'll\nfeel that emotion come up and it's going\nto be an emotion from the past\nand so as you digest and process that\nemotion your anxiety will weaken in the\npresent\nthe next thing that you can do is manage\nyour anxiety in the present by building\nthe capacity for tolerance and not\nengaging in those default behaviors that\ncontrol the situation\nbecause the more that you control the\nsituation the more you are artificially\nshort-circuiting your anxiety and then\nif you if that's the way that you've\ndone things which is usually how you do\nthings then you end up with this\ndisaster scenario where the way that I\ndeal with my anxiety is controlling the\nsituation\nbut if the way that I deal with my\nanxiety is controlling the situation and\nI can't control the situation then what\nhappens then you get tortured with\nanxiety over and over and over again\nyou're thinking about something for a\nwhole week and you can't fix it you\ncan't fix it you can't fix it but you\nkeep trying you keep trying you keep\ntrying\nand you're exhausted\nas you get exhausted your frontal lobes\nweaken your willpower weakens you eat\nunhealthy food you stop exercising and\nthen you The Dominoes start to fall and\nthe anxiety gets out of control\nso I sincerely hope that this has been\nhelpful to you today for you to\nunderstand where does anxiety come from\nhow does it manifest and what are the\ndifferent levers that I can pull because\nit's far beyond the mind\nand if all that stuff isn't enough\ndo the spiritual stuff check out\nDetachment by all means and the more you\ncan cultivate that the more it'll make\neverything else easy so good luck"
