    "transcript": "why is shopping hard why does shopping\ntake any more than 60 or 90 or three\nminutes five minutes it's because we\nbrowse and when we browse we buy crap we\ndon't need and why do we buy it because\nwe browse and we're looking for crap\nthat we don't even need and that's how\nthe website is designed and I'm not\nsaying that Amazon is evil it's just how\nthe whole internet is designed the whole\ninternet is designed for you to come in\nfor one purpose and then for you to hang\nout for three hours doing crap that you\ndon't need to do but if I only have\neight hours of Technologies I can't\nafford to spend half an hour wasting my\ntime browsing crap that I don't need the\nother thing that I found is that my work\nbecame incredibly focused so I do a fair\namount of writing and what I would do is\nsit down and like write everything out\nthis is my pile of papers from stuff\nthat I I do so since I'm not allowed to\nuse technology I'll start work before 10\nbut I don't break my technology fast so\nI'll like print things out and I'll like\nlook over it I'll collect all my\nthoughts and then when I sit down to\nwrite instead of writing for an hour and\na half that's a stream of Consciousness\nthat has to be edited later I have all\nmy thoughts collected I write for like\n20 minutes and I'm done it's really\nbizarre"
