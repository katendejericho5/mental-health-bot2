    "transcript": "this is what's really wild is like I\ndon't know if you all realize this you\nknow how long it takes to read a book\nthe average book is 80 000 words the\naverage human reads at the pace of 300\nwords a minute which means that the\naverage person can finish the average\nbook in six hours and we have 40 hours a\nweek of free time and we've already\naccounted for cooking cleaning exercise\nerrands and crap like that so I read\nfour books in two weeks because I don't\nhave anything else to do it was actually\nreally great I just started doing all\nthe stuff that is on your to-do list\nthat you don't have time to do and why\ndon't you have time to do it it's\nbecause you spend four hours a day on\nyour cell phone and seven hours a day on\na screen and only some of it is work but\nthe thing is work doesn't have to fill\nout eight hours this is the other Wild\nThing the average person spends eight\nhours at work but they really only do\nbetween three and six hours of\nproductive work a day and you know this\nright most of what you do at work is\ngetting distracted and then eventually\nyou'll do some work so what would happen\nif we started making everything\nefficient this is what intermittent\nfasting for technology has helped me do"
