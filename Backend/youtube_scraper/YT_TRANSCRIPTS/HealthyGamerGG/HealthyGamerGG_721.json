    "transcript": "so Alexa thyme is the inability to\nexperience your internal emotional state\nand what I kind of view this as is\nalmost like an emotional color blindness\nwe don't really realize but a lot of our\nproblems actually come from an inability\nto experience our internal emotional\nstate and there's actually a lot of\nscience that shows that being unaware of\nwhat you're feeling can lead to all\nkinds of problems so alexithymia has\nbeen associated with problems with\nmotivation and finding direction and\npurpose in life and Alexa thyme is also\na culprit for problems in relationships\nwhen we don't understand what we're\nfeeling it creates all kinds of stresses\nin relationships we start to send mixed\nsignals because someone asks us hey is\nit okay if I you know go to this party\nwithout you and you're like yeah it's\nfine like whatever and then you kind of\nfeel resentful but you don't know how to\nvocalize that resentment and so as a\nresult it kind of sabotages your\nrelationship because you said it was\nokay but now you're punishing this\nperson for something that you gave them\npermission for"
