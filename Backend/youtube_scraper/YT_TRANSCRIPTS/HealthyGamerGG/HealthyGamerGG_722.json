    "transcript": "so we're about one week in into\nintermittent fasting for technology and\nthe experience has been really\ninteresting so the first thing that I\nkind of noticed is like how much time I\nwaste on technology and being able to\nreally like restrict technology usage to\neight hours a day has completely changed\nthe structure of my day-to-day I try to\nspend at least one hour a day outdoors\nand what I found is that actually\ninstead of just like waking up in the\nmorning and like sitting down at the\ncomputer and figuring out what I need to\ndo for the day which is usually what\nused to happen I would sit down like\nlook at my calendar and like just try to\nfigure out check my email check slack I\nused to just spend an hour to just like\nchecking stuff without actually doing\nwork and what I found now is that what\nI'll usually do is since I don't want to\nbreak my fast I'll come outside with a\npiece of like paper and a pen and I'll\nactually just think a little bit about\nokay what do I want to accomplish today\nlike what do I need to do and so rather\nthan having like the internet or\ntechnology prompt me about what's\nimportant I start to spend time really\nlike thinking about okay like this is\nwhat I need to accomplish today"
