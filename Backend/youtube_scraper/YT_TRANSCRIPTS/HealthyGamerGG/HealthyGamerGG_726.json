    "transcript": "and that's where I stumbled upon\nsomething that I think is really really\namazing and it's actually like helped me\na ton which is intermittent fasting for\ntechnology\nhere at HG we help people develop\nhealthy relationships with technology\nand this is becoming increasingly\nimportant because as we're sort of\ngetting more and more research on stuff\nwe're discovering that there are\nnegative impacts to social media and the\nmore time we spend playing video games\nlike the more sort of impacts our\nmotivation we're also sort of seeing\nsome problems develop with things like\nstreaming and parasocial relationships\nstuff like pornography addiction and so\nwhile technology has a lot of really\ngreat uses in our life it also causes us\na lot of problems hey there thanks for\nwatching and I'm glad these videos have\nbeen helpful a lot of times I'll read\nthe comments and see people asking well\nwhat do I actually do about it which is\nsuch a great question and unfortunately\nmy experience has been that the\nresources out there aren't actually that\ngood at helping people create\nsustainable change which is why I\nstarted HG in the first place he coaches\nare trained on a curriculum that\nintegrates all of my understanding into\nwhat is motivation what paralyzes Us and\nhow to create lasting behavioral change\nso if you're ready to take the next step\nhe coaches are ready to build the life\nthat you want they've helped people\nbuild careers find relationships build\nnetworks of friends discover what their\npassions are and pursue their Hobbies so\nif this sounds like something that you'd\nbe interested in check out the link in\nthe description below and so some people\nwill come up with things and we do this\nin our community as well where we've got\nlike a particular coach for example who\nruns these like dopamine detox sessions\nwe have all kinds of like limitation\nattempts at technology but the challenge\nis that it's really hard right let's say\nI do a dopamine fast for two weeks and\nthen like\nI come back to it and then it's sort of\nlike okay well how do I reintegrate\ntechnology\nwe'll see this also with stuff like\nthings like pornography addiction or\nvideo game addiction more so with video\ngame addiction but like how do we sort\nof reintegrate this technology if we\ntake an extended break from it right so\npeople will take these breaks but then\nthe questions that I always get is like\nokay what's the right amount of\ntechnology to use because it's really\nhard because even if you work really\nhard and you sort of take a big break\nfrom technology you've got to come back\nat some point right because technology\nis a part of every part of our life it's\npart of work it's part of it's how we\nhave fun it's how we socialize so we\ndon't spend time on screens but I'm\nstill needing to like text people to\nmake plans and stuff like that so it's\nin every corner of our life and it\nbecomes really hard to not let it bleed\nin\nand that's there's a very good reason\nwhy it's hard to let it not bleed in\nit's because the developers of things\nlike apps and various technology\nplatforms want to bleed into our life\nright that's the way they design stuff\nso they design stuff with different\nkinds of colors and if you take a look\nat any icon on your phone I can\nguarantee you that that icon has been\nextensively tested even things like the\npitch and tone and frequency and volume\nof notifications on your phone are\ndesigned to kind of pull you in and\nthat's the huge problem with tech is\nthat I have a lot of good legitimate\nreasons to use it right like I've got to\ncheck my email for work I've got to get\nback to this person so we can meet up\nfor dinner or whatever I need to\ncoordinate with my personal trainer so I\ncan get physically in shape I need to\nlook up a recipe so that I can make\nmyself a healthy dinner there's all\nthese like healthy uses of tech\nthe problem arises that the second we\nstart using the device there's all this\nstuff out there that is pulling us in a\ndifferent direction because once I look\nat one recipe like\nyou know whatever platform I'm using to\nlook up the recipe doesn't want me to go\nbecause the longer I stay on the\nplatform the more money the platform\nmaker makes so they design lots of\nthings they show you other things and\nthose thumbnails are actually very\ncarefully chosen the titles are\ncarefully Chosen and we click on the\nnext thing and we click on the next\nthing we click on the next thing\nso in the past when people develop\nsolutions for technology there's one\ncore problem and that core problem is\nokay how do I reintegrate it right if I\ntake a vacation for two weeks or do a\ndopamine detox or dopamine fast and I'm\ngonna go be like doing all this\ndifferent stuff how do I reintegrate it\nand that's where I stumbled upon\nsomething that I think is really really\namazing and it's actually like helped me\na ton which is intermittent fasting for\ntechnology\nso I was trying intermittent fasting in\nmy own life because I'm trying to you\nknow experiment with different diets and\ntry to understand okay like what's\nhealthy what's not healthy and so I\ntried intermittent fasting I thought it\nwas like really really interesting so I\nI liked it a lot for a lot of reasons\nand then I kept on getting these\nquestions from our community it's like\nokay I've done a dopamine detox for two\nweeks like now what do I do how do I\ndevelop healthy technology habits I'll\nget this question from parents as well\nlike how much screen time is too much\nscreen time and like all this kind of\nstuff and then I thought to myself well\nwhat if we just took all the principles\nof intermittent fasting and applied them\nto Tech what if we restricted our\ntechnology use to eight hours a day\nbecause I think that solves\nautomatically a lot of problems so I\ndecided to actually try it so for about\na two now it's been almost three week\nperiod i implemented intermittent\nfasting for technology and what does\nthat mean that means that I restrict all\nof my Technologies to eight hours a day\nand you may say to yourself but hold on\na second like how is that possible like\nhow are you going to have fun right\nbecause like if I say something like\nthat what's your initial reaction I\ncan't restrict technology usage to eight\nhours a day so you really can't do that\nright because I have to work for eight\nhours and work requires technology right\nand if I have to work for technology\nthat means that my entertainment will\nbecome Amish like I can't do anything\nfun using a screen you mean I can't\nwatch movies I can't watch TV I can't\nplay videos I can't do any of that stuff\nwhat if I need to look up a recipe then\nwhat so it sounds impossible but this is\nwhere actually it's like really really\nfantastic and it is way more manageable\nthan you could possibly imagine\nso let's try to understand a little bit\nhow this works so as I started to\nimplement a technology restriction to\neight hours a day I noticed it solved a\nlot of the problems that I try to help\npeople with so with like a dopamine\ndetox okay how do I reintegrate it it's\nkind of fixed because you can only use\nit for eight hours a day you don't have\nto worry about it invading every corner\nof your life in terms of stuff like\nvideo games like how much is too much\nwell that depends like if you've got\ntime for it and you finish everything\nthat you need to do then you can play\nvideo games and by the way I've been\ngaming a fair amount during this time\nit's like actually not that big of a\ndeal it's bizarre\nand then there's also another huge thing\nthat I kind of discovered which is that\neveryone is like out of time nowadays\nright like everyone's like oh my God\nlike I go to work I commute like I cook\nI exercise and that's all the time I\nhave in the day like I don't have time\nfor anything right it's just like work\neat sleeps rinse and repeat cycle which\nmakes sense right that's the experience\nthat a lot of people have and it's like\noh my God like what's the problem it's\nlike it's capitalism right and like\npeople are working me harder and I work\nso much and all this kind of stuff and\nI'm not saying that people don't do that\nright so that's definitely the case but\nI think there are some things that we've\nmissed so let's start by understanding\nhow many hours we actually have in a\nweek there's about 168 hours in a week\nlet's assume that we sleep for eight\nhours a day so that drops us down by 56\nhours a week down to 112. Let's assume\nthat we work for about 40 hours a week\nthat drops us down to about 72 and then\nlet's also assume that there's 10 hours\nof other miscellaneous work a week I was\nactually checking myself and I tend to\nwork a little bit more than 40 hours\num also you got to like go grocery\nshopping and stuff like that so let's\ngive that another 10 hours a week okay\nso now we're left with 62 hours after we\ninclude work\nand sleeping so first thing that I want\nyou all to notice is like we still have\na lot of time left in the week but let's\nadd a couple of other things so let's\nassume that we spend about one hour a\nday like cooking and cleaning right so\nthat moves us down from 62 to about 55.\nlet's say I spend about half an hour\ngetting ready every morning with like\nshowering shaving and all that kind of\nstuff so that's an additional 3.5 hours\nso we're down to about 52 hours a week\nand let's say that we want to exercise\nan hour a day right which who exercises\nan hour a day so even if we're left at\nlike 52 hours if we're gonna exercise\nfor an hour a day we're down to like 45\nhours\nwhich is a lot it doesn't sound like\nonce we include cooking cleaning work\noverflow work com like maybe if you want\nto add commute you can add that let's\nsay half an hour each way which is seven\nhours a week right so one hour a day so\nnow we're like maybe in the 30s it\ndoesn't feel like we have 35 to 40 free\nhours a week and you're correct you\ndon't have 45 40 to 45 hours a week\nwhere does that time go well it turns\nout that the average human being spends\nabout four hours a day on their cell\nphone right and it's not necessarily\nproductive work so that's like 28 hours\nright there and that doesn't even\ninclude the seven hours a day that we\nnormally spend on screens on average\nokay and if you're watching this your\nusage may even be a little bit higher\nbecause you're a member of this\ncommunity and you're watching this on a\nplatform right now\nso once we include seven hours a week of\nscreen time like okay now we're talking\nabout 49 additional hours that's total\nscreen time or computer usage actually\nnow we can sort of see what what's\nhappening right because we don't have 50\nextra hours a week\nwell so this is what's really cool is\nwhen I started doing intermittent\nfasting for technology I actually gained\nabout 40 hours a week it's like\nabsolutely wild because where does that\ntime go like think about it right if you\nwork 40 or 50 hours a week you sleep 56\nhours a week you cook you clean you\nexercise a little bit like you're not\nleft with 40 hours a week where does it\ngo it goes into technology that's why\neveryone is like I don't have any time\nanymore well how many hours a day do you\nspend on cell phones and screens\nand what are you even doing during that\ntime\nso here's what I noticed once I actually\nstarted restricting to eight hours a day\nthe first thing that I noticed is that\nin the mornings I waste a lot of time on\ntechnology and I'll sort of justify it\nto myself thinking about work so I'll\nlike like I'll you know I'll start early\nin the morning like and sometimes I'll\nwake up and do yoga and stuff but on a\nbad day I'll pull up my phone and the\nfirst thing that I do is I check my\ncalendar and I see like okay what do I\nneed to do today like what time do I\nneed to get up how many hours do I have\nto be a degenerate before work starts\nand you may do the same thing\nand then what happens you start thinking\nabout the stuff that you have to do but\nyou don't actually do it right so I\nspend time like checking my Calendar\nchecking my email and mentally making a\nlist of tasks that I need to do that day\nthen depending on how many hours I have\nto be a degenerate I may like browse\nReddit and if I'm browsing Reddit for\nlike half an hour 45 minutes every trip\nto the bathroom I'm taking my cell phone\nmeans that taking a piss instead of\ntaking 30 seconds takes 10 minutes\nright and then like when I read when I'm\nlooking stuff on Reddit like oh I'm\ngoing to keep up with some drama I'm\ngoing to maybe like look at a scientific\nstudy here they're like you know\nbut most of the time I'm going to be\nlooking at how the world is all going to\nhell and no one can meet anyone and\neveryone's lonely and there's suicide\nand there's war and there's inflation\nand so now I've lost an hour of my day\nmaybe even 75 minutes and what have I\naccomplished all I've done is stress\nmyself out for the day I've got a bunch\nof crap but did I actually do it no I\njust like looked at what I have to do\nit's like when I'm staring at like a a\nbook and just\nnot reading it right it's a complete\nwaste of time\nso the other challenge that I had is oh\nmy God like what if I need to get all\nthis stuff done eight hours is not\nenough work is not enough time to get\nall my work done so I started freaking\nout so then I did something really cool\nso I held that boundary and then I\nstarted realizing oh I can work a lot\nwithout technology\nso then what I started doing is like\nsitting down with a piece of paper and I\nwould like write out like everything I\nneed to do today I'd make shopping lists\nI'd like you know figure out okay what\nare the tasks that I need to do I'd\nthink about what my priorities are at\nwork before being prompted by something\nlike calendar or email so paradoxically\nwhat started happening is I started\nfocusing on like bigger picture stuff\nand more important stuff all the crap\nthat I should be doing that I don't have\ntime to do because I'm getting bogged\ndown in meetings I'm actually starting\ntoday thinking about that stuff so this\nis what my day used to look like I'd\ncome into this office I'd sit down at\nthis computer and I'd basically try to\nfigure out like okay what am I gonna do\ntoday and now what my day looks like now\nthis is not something that I really\nexpected is this okay so I use so much\nmore paper than I did before and what I\nbasically will do is like sit down and\nI'll try to like kind of map out what my\nday actually looks like I'll take a ton\nof notes of all different kinds here's\nactually here's the pile of papers just\nfrom the last 24 hours\num and what I've really found is that it\nfocuses me so much more and that's when\nit kind of hit me that like you know\nusually we sit down to use a device and\nwe don't really know why we're using it\nand the more that devices can do\nmultiple things the easier it is to not\nknow why you're using it when you sit\ndown so when I sit down now at my\ncomputer it's like what am I actually\ntrying to do like okay well I can do\nsome work I can play some games I can\ncheck my email I can pay some bills\nthere's like a thousand different things\nthat I can do on my on my computer or my\nphone which means that when I sit down\nto use it my mind is not focused and if\nmy mind is not focused that means that\nit's way easier to get distracted right\nand that's what all these apps and like\nYouTube suggestions and like Reddit\nposts like that's what they're there for\nthey're there to distract the mind and\nwhat I've discovered now is since I've\nstarted limiting my technology use and I\nactually like map out like what I need\nto do today before I I actually even\nlike get started when I sit down to use\na device what I actually discover is I\nknow exactly what I'm doing so I sit\ndown and I'm like okay I've got a\nlimited number of times so I got to do\nthis this this this and this and then my\nmind is really focused and I find that I\ndon't get distracted and I actually find\nthat like eight hours of Technology use\na day is actually way more than enough\nwhich I never realized until I actually\nsat down and started doing this\nthen I break my my technology fast right\nso I tend to start my window was 10 a.m\nto 6 p.m right so I'm not touching\nanything on a screen until 10 A.M so\nlet's all like do yoga and other crap\nlike that and then I like break my fast\nand then what I found is when I actually\nuse the technology I'm incredibly\nfocused\nso I have a shopping list so if I would\nneed to get stuff from Amazon or\nwhatever I just log on I type in the\nthings I have in the cart and I check\nout\nand if you think about like why is\nshopping hard why does shopping take any\nmore than 60 or 90 or three minutes five\nminutes it's because we browse and when\nwe browse we buy crap we don't need and\nwhy do we buy it because we browse and\nwe're looking for crap that we don't\neven need and that's how the website is\ndesigned right and I'm not saying that\nAmazon is evil it's just how the whole\ninternet is designed the whole internet\nis designed for you to come in for one\npurpose and then for you to hang out for\nthree hours doing crap that you don't\nneed to do\nbut if I only have eight hours of\nTechnologies I can't afford to spend\nhalf an hour wasting my time browsing\ncrap that I don't need the other thing\nthat I found is that my work became\nincredibly focused so I do a fair amount\nof writing and what I would do is sit\ndown and like write everything out this\nis my pile of papers\nfrom stuff that I I do\none thing I found is that I also print\nout a lot of stuff so since I'm not\nallowed to use technology I'll start\nwork before 10 but I don't break my\ntechnology fast so I'll like print\nthings out that's the one real downside\nI guess it's bad for the environment so\nI'll print stuff out and I'll like look\nover it I'll collect all my thoughts and\nthen when I sit down to write instead of\nwriting for an hour and a half that's a\nstream of Consciousness that has to be\nedited later\nI have all my thoughts collected I write\nfor like 20 minutes and I'm done it's\nreally bizarre\neven when it comes to like meetings and\nstuff like that I'm really focused I\nknow what I need to do I've thought\nabout everything I'm not getting\ndistracted by stuff I do absolutely\ncheck my email and then I add other\nthings to the list that I need to take\ncare of\nbut I want you all to think about this I\ndon't know if you all have ever had to\nwork on the same day that you're\ncatching a flight\nand so this is the kind of thing where\nif you have to leave work by like 1 pm\nto catch your flight what do you do when\nyou get to work you're incredibly\nfocused right I got to do this this and\nthis because I got to be out the door at\n1 pm I don't have any time to waste and\nso you don't waste any time and you're\nout by 1 pm and the world doesn't fall\napart this is what every day has turned\ninto like my work is incredibly focused\nI shop quickly and I'm done the really\nbizarre thing that I discovered is\nremember my window is 10 to 6 but I'll\nstart work before\nbecause I would sometimes finish work\nearly\nlike I'd finished work around like 3 30\nor 4 like finish my last meeting and\nthen I'd play video games for like an\nhour or two until 6 pm and then once 6\nPM rolls around like then it's like okay\nmy technology window is closed\nso that means I gotta do something else\nlike spend time with my kids\nor go outside or go for a walk or read a\nbook\nand this is what's really wild is like I\ndon't know if you all realize this you\nyou know how long it takes to read a\nbook the average book is 80 000 words\nokay\nthe average human reads at the pace of\n300 words a minute\nwhich means that the average person can\nfinish the average book in six hours\nand we have 40 hours a week of free time\nand we've already accounted for cooking\ncleaning exercise errands and crap like\nthat so I read four books in two weeks\nbecause I don't have anything else to do\nit was actually really great I also\nstarted like gardening and other crap\nlike that like I just started doing all\nthe stuff that is on your to-do list\nthat you don't have time to do and why\ndon't you have time to do it it's\nbecause you spend four hours a day on\nyour cell phone\nand seven hours a day on a screen and\nonly some of it is work but the thing is\nwork doesn't have to fill out eight\nhours this is the other wild thing\nthe average person spends eight hours at\nwork but they really only do between\nthree and six hours of productive work a\nday and you know this right most of what\nyou do at work is getting distracted and\nthen eventually you'll do some work so\nwhat would happen if we started making\neverything efficient this is what\nintermittent fasting for technology has\nhelped me do make everything efficient\nso let's talk a little bit about how to\nmake this happen what we're going to do\nfor if for technology is actually pull\nfrom a lot of like intermittent fasting\nprinciples from like Diet stuff okay so\nthe first thing that's really important\nis you've got to plan your day just like\nyou plan your meals in an intermittent\nfasting if you do not plan your meals in\nif you will fail so you really have to\nthink ahead of time about what you're\ngonna eat when you break your fast and\nlike what's gonna happen in the same way\nyou have to think ahead of time about\nhow you are going to deploy The Limited\nresource of Technology\nand this in and of itself cuts out so\nmuch of the waste right because if I\ndon't get this done I can't do it and if\nyou violate that then you're SOL\nso let's start by just thinking through\nokay what do I need to do so this is\nwhat I need to do for work this is why I\nneed to order stuff online this is the\nstuff that like I need to check into\nhere's the doctor's appointment that I\nneed to investigate things like that\nthe second thing that we we really need\nto be prepared for is when I was\nlearning in intermittent fasting I\nlearned something really interesting\nwhich is that you're going to need to\nchange your relationship with hunger\nin the same way if you're doing if for\ntechnology you need to change your\nrelationship with boredom\nso right now the way that we exist is\nwhen we get bored we have some\ndopaminergic crap that we reach for that\ndoesn't really fulfill us and doesn't\nhelp us doesn't isn't actually making us\nfun it just alleviates boredom for some\namount of time and it even can get to\nthe point where we are so it doesn't\neven do a good job of alleviating\nboredom so we need a second device I\ndon't know if you all like if this\napplies to you but when you're watching\nTV and scrolling on your phone at the\nsame time\nso if you're hitting that point then\nthat's a huge problem so for these two\nweeks prepared to be like a little bit\nbored and the key thing to understand is\nthat border man gonna kill you and it's\nlike okay to be born and just think a\nlittle bit about okay like what's more\nimportant to me gaining 40 hours a week\nor being less bored like that's\nliterally what the trade-off is because\nwhat we're doing every time we satisfy\nour boredom is we're losing an hour of\nour life every week okay so change your\nrelationship with boredom understand\nthat just like hunger it's a sensation\nit's a concern it's a worry and there's\nall kinds of stuff that you can do that\nmay not quite fix it this is where I\nfound that originally for me like going\nfor walks was really really important so\nI'd go for a walk I'd take papers I'd\ntake a book and I'd sit down at a park\nbench and actually like do my work there\nor think or do some kind of recreation\nokay\nso we're about one week in into\nintermittent fasting for technology and\nthe experience has been really\ninteresting so the first thing that I\nkind of noticed is like how much time I\nwaste on technology\nand being able to really like restrict\ntechnology usage to eight hours a day\nhas completely changed the structure of\nmy day-to-day the first thing is like\nI'm working right now and this is where\nI spend I try to spend at least one hour\na day outdoors and what I found is that\nactually instead of just like waking up\nin the morning and like sitting down at\nthe computer and figuring out what I\nneed to do for the day which is usually\nwhat used to happen I would sit down\nlike look at my calendar and like you\nknow just try to figure out check my\nemail check slack check Reddit and like\nI used to just spend an hour or two just\nlike checking stuff without actually\ndoing work and what I found now is that\nwhat I'll usually do is since I don't\nwant to break my fast I'll come outside\nwith a piece of like paper and a pen and\nI'll actually just think a little bit\nabout okay what do I want to accomplish\ntoday like what do I need to do and so\nrather than having like the internet or\ntechnology prompt me about what's\nimportant I start to spend time really\nlike thinking about okay like this is\nwhat I need to accomplish today is there\na couple of other caveats which I had to\nsort of think about which I didn't\nreally think about ahead of time until I\ntried it so you'll probably have to do\nthis too the first is when I refer to\ntechnology what I usually mean is\nelectronics so in my case like I had a\ncouple of simple exceptions so like I'm\nallowed to use a car and like a\nmicrowave and things like that like I'm\nallowed to like use things that are\ntechnological devices okay I'm allowed\nto use a yoyo if I really need to Tech\neven though it's like you know\ntechnically technology\nthe other thing is I let myself use GPS\nand then I let myself use a phone to\ncoordinate like social plans and stuff\nso for example if my kids are going to\nlike you know their friend's house for\ndinner like I'm allowed to text their\nparents to go pick them up the key thing\nthere is that once I start using my\nphone I'm going to be really really\nstrict about okay like I'm only gonna\ntext them and I'm only going to take\nphone calls and stuff the other thing\nwhich I unfortunately had to do is since\nI'm a practicing physician\nstuff relating to patients like was the\nexception here so if I get like a call\nfrom a patient and the patient is like\nhey I've run out of this medication can\nyou please call in you know some kind of\nrefill or something like that or I need\nlike I got a brain scan or I what\nhappened this week is someone called me\nbecause they needed me to like look at\ntheir EKG and things like that this is\nmore Physical Medicine stuff but like\nthat was kind of the big rule breaker\nthat I sort of allowed for myself so if\na patient needs me to use technology\nafter hours like it's totally okay to\nuse it so you may figure out a couple of\nthings that are like exceptions to your\nrule which is totally fine but I\nstrongly strongly strongly urge you to\ntry to restrict as many things as you\ncan\nand so let me give you all a couple of\nexamples of things that I struggled with\nso one question is what about music and\nwhat about audiobooks so usually I'm\nsomeone who really likes listening to\naudiobooks when I'm doing things like\nthe dishes and so oddly enough what I\nsort of decided was that I was actually\ngoing to cut both of them so no audio\nbooks except within the window and then\nlike no music originally I allowed\nmyself to listen to music if I'm doing\nlike stuff that is not otherwise\ntechnology related so if I'm reading a\nbook and I'm you know sitting with my\nkids and we're like playing like you\nknow there's music on the background\nthat's totally fine so you may discover\nthat there are a couple of exceptions\nand you've got to kind of figure that\nout for yourself\nso just to summarize right now we all\nstruggle with not having enough time\nthere's also this really simple question\nof how do I use technology in a healthy\nway and so far the approach that we've\ntaken is to try to like cut it out\nentirely right but the moment that we\nstart getting back into it it's very\nhard to set limits on our technology\nbecause we're using it for like a quote\nunquote good reason right so like maybe\nI'm I need it for work which is like\nkind of number one like I use it to\ncommunicate with family members I use it\nto do research that's another thing I\nstopped doing like stupid ass random\nresearch that never turned into anything\nlike if I sat down I would do research\nbut then I would like turn it into\nsomething that was a big thing that I\nkind of discovered is that like there's\nso much unproductive work that you do at\nwork and so if you have to restrict your\ntechnology usage you're just gonna like\nsit down and actually get it done there\nare a couple of core problems that\npeople are dealing with today number one\nthey don't know how to use their\ntechnology in a healthy way right we\nsort of will try to restrict it we'll\nsometimes even go to drastic lengths\nalmost like a crash diet where I'm going\nto cut out all technology for two weeks\nand we've advocated for this at times we\nsort of have groups of people who do\nthis on Discord we have coaches who will\nhelp people with things like you know\nbuilding healthy technology habits and\nso that's all really great the real\nchallenge is that even if we try to set\na healthy limit something is going to\nget in the way we need to work and once\nwe start working this is where there's\nlike billion dollar companies out there\nthat are trying to steal your attention\naway from work\nand then we end up slipping into\ntechnology the second thing that we've\nobserved across the whole is if you talk\nto people no one has time right\neveryone's running out of time there's\ntoo much to do\nI've got to work so much and I'm what\nthis is life it's a get up go to work\nfinish work commute home exercise do\nlaundry eat and go to sleep after half\nan hour of recreation\nthat's what it feels like right but what\nI think a lot of people are missing is\nliterally if you do an hour calculation\nin the day we still have about 40 hours\nleft in the in a week where does that\ntime go well it turns out there's\nstatistics for that\nfour hours a day of cell phone usage six\nhours and 45 minutes a day of other\nkinds of screen time and so that's where\nour time is going\nso it's a really simple solution which\nis restrict all of your technology usage\nto eight hours a day\nand you may start to Rebel oh my God but\nwhat about this but what about this but\nwhat about this but what about this and\nthat's exactly what we want you to do we\nwant you to think about all of those\nproblems and then solve them within the\nspace\nthat you have right because our\nattention and Technology usage is kind\nof like a gas\nit fills up what whatever container we\ngive it and the more that you start\nrestricting it to eight hours a day the\nmore you'll figure out okay I can\nactually be incredibly efficient even\nthough I'm breaking my fast at 10 A.M I\ncan start work two hours earlier and if\nI start work two hours earlier when I\nsit down at the computer I bang stuff\nout way faster\nand I still have time for recreation by\nthe way I still get eight hours on the\nweekend and what do you think I do on\nthose eight hours on the weekend I may\nnot start in the morning I may start at\n2 pm\nright or even 3 P.M or 4 P.M and then\nI'm putting my kids to bed they're in\nbed by let's say nine and then like I\nhave three hours to game so you can\nabsolutely do that and it's kind of an\nintentional thing but once those three\nhours over you're done\nand so it's time to go to bed\nso I strongly encourage you all to think\nabout intermittent fasting for\ntechnology I think it's a very very\nelegant solution to a lot of the\nproblems that we face and you'll be\namazed at like how much time you have\nonce you start to implement it all that\ncrap that you wish you would do like\nread a book which by the way takes five\nhours did you realize that the average\nhuman being can read a book in five to\nsix hours\nwe spend one book's worth of time on our\ncell phones every single day so you'll\nfind that you have a lot more time to do\nthe things that are actually important\nto you and that actually like leads to a\nway better life so definitely give it a\nshot and feel free to add your\nexperience in the comment section below"
