    "transcript": "and I think the other problem that we\nsort of see is that when you are\nemphasizing the dangers of technology to\na parent and then that parent goes and\nsits with their child what does that\nconversation look like you've got to\nstop playing the video game don't you\nrealize how terrible it is oh my God I\njust read this thing there was this\nstudent who was playing this video game\nand they got docs and they were stalked\nand someone followed them and so that\nparanoia and fear is front and center\nwith the parent now when you sit down\nand you talk to your kid how do you\nthink your kid is going to respond to\nthat do you think they're going to agree\nof course not no I play this game every\nday there's nothing wrong with it so\nfrom the very get-go the parent is\ncoming in with a completely different\nperception and so parent and child are\nnot on the same page and then it becomes\na push and pull where I'm trying to\nconvince you no it's okay to play a\nvideo game I've been doing it my entire\nlife and the parent is like no no it's\nnot okay so there's a fundamental\ndisagreement"
