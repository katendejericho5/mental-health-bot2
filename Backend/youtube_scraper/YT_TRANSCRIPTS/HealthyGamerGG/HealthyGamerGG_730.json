    "transcript": "so when we really think about what\nDetachment is so like here's the world\ndown here and here's us up here and we\nkind of sit in the middle and I know\nthat sounds kind of weird what do I mean\nby that so we kind of sit over here and\nwhat we think Detachment means that we\nthink it means removing ourselves from\nthe world but if you really look at it\nwhat Detachment truly means is removal\nfrom our own ego so when we remove\nourselves from our ego that's when we\nactually become detached let's say I\nwant to dance at a party the music is\nfantastic I really really feel like\ndancing what is it that keeps me from\ndancing because I can hear the music I\nwant to move maybe I don't know how to\ndance but who the hell cares right\ngenerally speaking people who like\ndancing to music don't care if they know\nhow to dance or don't know how to dance\nyou can still dance to the music and\nenjoy it but what is it that keeps you\nfrom enjoying that moment in the world\nit's not the world itself it's your own\nego it's this idea that oh my God if I\nstart dancing I will look stupid because\nI don't know how to dance"
