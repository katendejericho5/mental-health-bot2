    "transcript": "people who are sensitive to rejection\nreally negotiate against themselves when\nit comes to social situations so you\nwill take any kind of neutral situation\nor any kind of situation and you will\nassume the worst and secondly blame\nyourself the most so if someone says hey\nI'm sorry I can't hang out today or they\ncancel the last minute you're not going\nto interpret that as oh this person is\nflaky or they're sick or this is a\nproblem on their end you are\nautomatically going to interpret that as\na problem on your end so you need to\nreally be aware of the way that you\nactually like give yourself very little\ncredit and you give them a bunch of\ncredit you're sort of really willing to\nnegotiate yourself and always take on\nthe mantle of being the bad guy because\nremember in the household that you grew\nup in whose fault was it if mommy or\ndaddy were mad it was your fault you\nneed to be quieter I can't believe you\ndidn't put away your toys and they kind\nof blame you for all this kind of stuff\nso you get into a pattern of blaming\nyourself so become aware of that pattern"
