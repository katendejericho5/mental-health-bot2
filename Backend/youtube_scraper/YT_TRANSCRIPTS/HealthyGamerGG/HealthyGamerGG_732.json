    "transcript": "all right my friend welcome\nhow's it going good dude how are you\nI'm great\num and what do you go by my friend\nfish ish\nyeah\num and so what are we talking about\ntoday ish\nuh we're talking about\num\ndating\n[Music]\nI guess I just wanted to share my\nperspective on\num yeah I guess like somebody who's been\nsold this idea that you know if you do\nXYZ then like\nwomen are gonna flock to you\num I guess I spent\nthe large part of basically my whole\nlife\nfeeling like there's something wrong\nwith me and I need to fix myself\nand I've been on this like\ndecade long journey of like fixing\nmyself I'm like fixing one thing after\nthe other after the other after the\nother and I'm like\nnow I'm like 32 and I'm still like\nlonely and I'm still single and I'm just\nlike confused and I've tried literally\neverything under the sun\nto fix things externally and\nnow I'm at a place where I'm like\nmaybe the problem is not external it's\nokay that's where I'm at okay\num\nwell I mean I\nhow can I say this my first thought is\nlike that sounds tiring\nexhausting yeah\nwhat's that like\nit's like this uh constant\nlike internal drive to be\nuh\nenough\nand just trying to do everything\npossible to just be enough\nand yeah like I wake up every day and\nI'm just like what can I fix today like\nwhy am I not enough why am I still\nlonely\nI\nfeel like\nI have a lot of things in life that um\nyou know I have a lot of things going\nfor me and\nI just can't it kind of\nexternally I feel like yeah I can see\nwhy I have a lot of things going for me\nbut internally I still feel\nlike a lot of like self-loathing and a\nlot of\num\nyeah I just I I just don't have a sense\nof self like of self-worth\num regardless of all these external\naccomplishments that I've been able to\nhave in my life like it kind of just\nmeans nothing because all I really want\nis like intimacy and connection and I\njust don't have that in my life and just\nconfused as to how to like find that\nyeah dude I'm sorry you're in that\nsituation I'm sorry I'm grinning you\njust seem like such an amazing dude\nthank you and um I guess that's part of\nI guess that's part of why I'm confused\nbecause um I guess\num when I share like my struggles with\ndating or whatever to people I guess\nthat I get invalidated because they're\nlike well you're so handsome and you're\nso like intelligent you're like so funny\nand like they let's rattle off all these\nthings about me and I'm like I get it I\nsee it cognitively like intellectually\nmaybe if I wasn't myself I'd be like\nokay why is this guy struggling with\ndating but I guess I'm just carrying a\nlot of Shame and things inside of me\nwhich make me unable to access\nfeeling of like I'm worth something\nso it's just been confusing to me okay\nis it okay if I just start off by like\nasking you a couple questions about your\nbackground and it sounds like you've\nbeen on this journey for 10 years can we\nlearn a little bit about that like\nsure what what have you been up to like\nit sounds like you fixed a lot of stuff\nexternally\nyeah what did you fix and how how\nuh I guess\nI think the things that's that was\nplaguing me since childhood was like\nsocial anxiety\nso\num like I had to move out of my parents\nhome like maybe like 10 years ago I\nmoved countries\nand you're like one person in the\ncountry I moved to and I kind of\nwanted to start this journey of like you\nknow being independent and like\nthings for myself and\nyeah so social anxiety was the first\nthing I fixed and I guess\nfound self-improvement self-help and\njust started reading\nbook after book after book and consuming\nYouTube and blah blah blah\nand I guess a lot of that was like\nmental masturbation but also some of it\nwas like I put into action certain\nthings I guess like exposing myself to\nthings I'm scared of like progressively\noverloading and\nto the point where okay like I can now\nshrink a coherence sentence without\nhaving panic attacks and like I can now\ntalk to people without\nlike you know feeling like intense\nphysical Sensations\nand\nand then after that I was like okay\num I'm like\nish can I jump in for a second what does\nit feel like to say that\nright now yeah\nwhat does it feel like to talk about\nyour progress\nhonestly I I feel proud of myself and\nI don't think I've ever felt that before\nand it's been recent that I'm like\nactually noticing that I have a lot of\nthings to be proud of\nso there's a big difference between\nhaving a lot of things to be proud of\nand being proud of them\nyeah\nsure\nand where are you right now\nyeah I I have a lot of things to be\nproud of like because I can make a list\nof things but I can't feel can't feel it\nbut so when I was asking you about you\nknow what you've accomplished did you\nfeel some pride\nat the time probably not because I was\njust like\nthey're still a lot of things wrong with\nme so I've got to keep going keep going\nI'll keep fixing myself\nit's just like okay our social anxieties\nticked off the list now I need to like\ngo to the gym I've got to get ripped\nokay got it like in a good body\ngoing down that path and then like\nI got to make money and then going down\nthat path\nand then it's like I gotta start a\nbusiness and I'm going down that path\nand it's like\nall these different things\nthat like\nI'm just like okay how can I I'm just\nbeing sold that idea that like money\nlooks status like get all these things\nand be the most high value man\nall that [ __ ] and it's just like\ndoing all of that\nand\nthrown off feeling like I'm valuable and\nit's just weird\nwhat are you feeling right now\nI actually don't know what I'm feeling\nright now okay\nso uh you said that then you started\nworking on the gym right and it sounds\nlike you got in shape and then\nand what was that ex experience like for\nyou\nagain I was I think I was just doing it\nfor not for myself but for like\nexternal validation or\nbeen sold I guess just being like Oh\nlike\nif I get into shape once I get into\nshape then I can be worthy of like women\nor like worthy of respect or\nwhatever\num so\neven though I was like a cop like\ngetting into shape it just didn't feel\nlike again it was I was just like I need\nto get bigger I need to like lose more\nbody fat and\nyeah I just just felt like there was a\nchore I just felt like I don't even know\nwhy I'm doing this but apparently I have\nto be a high value man that's what they\ndo so\nyeah\nokay\num and then what about the the whole\nmaking money career\nStuff how to can you tell me a little\nbit about that\nyeah\num so\nI mean I\ngone into programming\nI've been into programming since the\nyoung age so I never really thought much\nabout like what I wanted to do it's just\nsomething that I just fell into\num\nand yeah just kind of just kept going\nand I just kept like\nchasing money even though there was a\ncertain point where I was like I don't\neven enjoy this but\nbecause I was just I guess um\npretty depressed and like\nI just didn't\nknow\nlike I don't really care I just wanted\nto just kind of survive\nbut\num there was this like lucrative aspect\nof it where I was just like oh I can\njust keep I think making more money and\nmore money and more money and then\nthe my whole like uh I guess\nintention to make money was to like fix\nmyself so I could like make money and\nthen like figure out how to fix myself\neven more so like that was pretty much\nwhy I wanted to make money to like\nfigure out what's wrong with me and like\nthrow money at that\nand\nyeah kind of like\ngot to a place where I'm like in the top\npercentage of like income earners in the\ncountry and like that student feel like\nanything because I just still felt\nbroken inside I'm still like none of\nthis [ __ ] means anything and I guess the\nmore money I made the more like negative\nemotion I felt because I was like\nconvincing myself that if I made more\nthan like I could be happier or like\nI could like spend money on things to\nfix myself and\nand then it just became like this thing\nwhere\num\nyeah I was just\nused like\nspending money to get rid of this these\nnegative emotions and\nand develop yeah and keep going\nyeah just develop like I guess like\naddictions to things like buying random\nstuff that I don't need and like\njust uh again like the addiction to like\nself-improvement self-help\njust like learning buying courses and\nlike paying for like mentorship and\ncoaches and blah blah blah and like\nyeah\num\nand and what has that experience been\nlike what are you feeling now\nI just feel uh\nI just feel like it's just like kind of\nridiculous for me like just looking back\nat it like\neverything that I kind of\ndid I just feel it's ridiculous yeah\nwhat's ridiculous about it\nI don't know I just I just wish like at\nthe start of this journey someone just\ntold me like I should just go to therapy\nand just spend money on therapy and just\nlike\ndo that\nand I think I would have been all right\nand have you tried therapy\nI have yeah\num I again like that\nthat whole journey was\num\nlike\nI didn't have great experiences with\nlike early on\num\nlike exposure it's like mental health\nprofessionals so like I would like seek\nit out and also\nwhere I live like there's like a\nshortage of mental health professionals\nso like it's kind of like I've seen like\neven like when I'm in like a really\ndepressed state like even picking up the\nphone making phone calls difficult so\nlike even asking for help or admitting\nthat I need help was like really\ndifficult and then\nI got over that step and I like asked\nfor help and then be like oh like the\nwaiting list is like eight months so\nlike we'll put you on the waiting list\nand I'll be like\nokay like\nI guess I just I need to fix myself then\nlike I can't rely on someone else so\nso it'd be like in and out of\ntrying to seek professional help and\nthen being like Oh like let's try like a\nspiritual route and I actually let's try\nself-help books and then\nI guess I would go to like mental health\nprofessionals and then\nget diagnosed with a bunch of different\nthings\num\nand then I'd get like medicated and then\nI'd try like a cocktail of medications\nand then\nsome would work some wouldn't work some\nwould be like\neffective short term and then some would\nbe\ngive me side effects and then\nlike I would just keep trying that over\nthe years like okay maybe maybe this\ndiagnosis is right maybe I can try this\nmood stabilizer you try really hard\ndon't you\nI try really hard yeah\nI'm curious who can you rely on\nmyself\nI'm seeing that\num so and and can you tell tell us a\nlittle bit about kind of this like the\nmentorship throwing money at the problem\nwhat did that look like and\nwhat was that like for you\num\nwell the first five years was just kind\nof like I guess mental masturbation like\njust\nI would have like this did you say\nmental masturbation or Mentor\nmasturbation\nmental masturbation\nA-L\nyeah okay and what does that mean\nthat just means like\nI guess\num spending money on things and like I\nguess buying courses online like for\nexample like\nhow to pick up woman or some something\nlike that or like how to\nBuild A Drop Shipping Company like just\nbuying these things\nand like going through them but not\ndoing anything with it okay and that\nwould be like first five years of just\ndoing that and I guess it was just it\nserves some like\nthis intellectual curiosity of like not\neven intellectual curiosity but I guess\num\nfeeling like I was improving myself with\nlike knowledge like learning stuff not\ndoing anything with it\nand then\nthe last five years was kind of like\nokay like the the problem that I wanted\nto fit now was like loneliness it's like\nhow do I fix that\nand then\num there's one half internet which is\nlike invalidating my loneliness and then\nthere's\ncertain pockets of the internet we're\nlike I know exactly how you feel I know\nI know I know how to fix it\nand that Center like the world of like\ndating coaching and like pick up\nartistry\nand\num yeah kind of like\nI knew that like some of the stuff was\nshady you know and I knew like maybe\nthis was not\nhelpful but I was curious about it and I\nwas like lonely I was like didn't really\nhave any other Alternatives options so\nI explored that and um\nagain like trying different things\num\nI'd go to like\nboot camps and then I would like learn\ncertain things and then\nthat'd be the intellectual part of me\nwhich is like oh this is this is not\nworking like and maybe there's like\nanother approach\nthat like do like multiple approaches\nand like compare all of them and then\nlike\nit would just it's just like a mess so\nit's kind of like I've just learned like\nhad this database of like information in\nmy head of like I guess this problem of\nlike loneliness like solving my dating\nissues\nand now it's like realizing it's full of\nbunch of [ __ ] and I'm just trying to\nunlearn everything that I've learned\nokay essentially and and can you tell me\nso you mentioned earlier that there was\nlike you know a lot of investment\nwithout application\nand in terms of like the dating stuff\nand relationship stuff I mean have you\nhave you tried to apply it or is that\nsort of remained somewhat kind of\ntheoretical in the database\nyeah so in the last five years I've been\napplying it and what's that been like\nit's it's kind of just been\num\nwhat it's been like is like I kind of\nlearned to create this like mask\nof like\nhow to present like project these like\nqualities of myself and project like a\nfalse confidence\nand project like bravado\num\nand\nI was like attracting women and I was\nlike\nsleeping with a lot of women\num and I thought like that would like\nincrease my self-worth so I finally like\ndamn I used to be an InStyle now I'm\ngetting like delayed a lot\num\nbut then the thing was like I felt like\neven more lonely and isolated because\nnow I've learned that like the real me\nwhoever that is is unattractive and like\nwomen only like this this mask that I'm\nputting on\nand\nand I'm I'm happy that like I don't get\ntoo much too deep into that like I\nlearned\nlike I guess after a certain period of\nlike doing this over and over again like\nthe first time was cool\nthe first time of like implementing this\nthing and like getting laid was cool but\nthen like you just keep doing it it's\njust like at what point\nlike and how many women are like at what\npoint\nwill like become confident or will I\nlike increase my self-worth\nso um\nyeah so I kind of learned that like\nthe mask was attractive and\num I wasn't whoever I was and like\nI guess now in the last\nfew years I've been slowly trying to\nlower that and be myself and be\nvulnerable and\num\nmaybe nowadays like in the past year or\nso it's been over correcting in the\nother way which is like maybe I'm like\ntoo vulnerable like overshadowing too\nmuch and that's causing people to be\nlike yo\nthat's too much so it's just confusing\nwhat can you give us an example of that\nan example of what over sharing in\npeople like yo bro that's too much\nthat's just in my head but I guess there\nwas um\nlike a woman that I went on a date with\nmaybe yeah uh the end of last year and\num I really thought\nconnected to her\nmore than any other girl that have been\non a date with in the last few years and\nat this point I've been on like almost\nat least 100 dates\nand a lot of them have been first dates\nand I don't get many second dates or\nthird dates\num but anyways like so I went on a date\nwith this girl and\nI guess we would talk talking about like\nchildhood traumas and stuff on like a\nfirst date which is\nI don't know if that was like trauma\nbonding or that's like\nwhatever\num so in hindsight it kind of felt too\nintense too soon and like she ended up\nghosting me and\nI guess that was like\num\nthat was damaging to me because I I\nguess like I was like okay I've lowered\nthis mask\nand I finally revealed myself\nand still I get like ghosted and\nI'm just make I don't know what else to\ndo\num\nit's like she's rejected the real me\nand so like\nit takes me a while to like recover from\nthose situations dating experiences like\nI would like go back and work on myself\nfor like a few months and I'd like you\nknow get in this really good state of\nlike my routine journaling meditation\ngoing to the gym and like yoga and like\nI just feel like super good about myself\nand I'd be like yes I'm ready to date\nand I'll go on a date and then\nI would just\nnot hear from a girl your ghost did\nafter the first date and then I'd be\nlike oh [ __ ] this and then\nit would just be another\nkind it's just like the cycle that just\nlike never ends\nI think we're seeing a little bit of lag\nyes\nI think we're fine\num\nso what's your understanding of why\nthere aren't many second dates or third\ndates\nthat's the question that I I can't\nanswer\num and I guess\nthis is like\nthe people that know the answer is like\nthe dating coaches or like and then each\ndating coach would have their own like\ninterpretation of why that is\nand then one would have their own\nmethodology and formula of like how to\nrun a date and like this is what to do\nis what not to do and what to say it's\nnot what to say and then another dating\ncoach would have a different opinion\nand um\nlike honestly I don't know\num and\nand it's bemusing to a lot of people\nwhen I express it\num and\nthe only people that would know\nis like the woman that I go on dates\nwith\nand\nI sometimes I like something I'm doing\nrecently is like asking for feedback\num\nI guess yeah you have to take that with\na lot of salt because uh\npeople don't want to hurt your feelings\nand\nI think sometimes some of the feedback\nhas been good like I guess things like\noh like you weren't making enough eye\ncontact or like\nuh the date felt like an interview and\nI'm like okay cool I can improve those\nthings\nand then other times has been vague like\nI don't I don't feel a romantic\nconnection\nwhich is weird because the woman that\nsaid that to me like just to me on the\nday like she initiated the kiss and\nstuff like that so\nit's just weird and then\nthe the last girl I went on a date with\nlike\num\nwe were like met Our dating app she was\nlike flirting with me and she initiated\nme to get off the app and then like\nflirting or week over text I asked her\nout went on date\nand then I thought the date went really\nwell\nlove to see you again she's like yeah\nI'd love that too and then I text her\nthe next day or the day after I'd be\nlike hey um when when you're down to\nlike hang out again\nand then I don't hear from her for a few\ndays and then she's like hey so I've\njust been thinking um\nI'm just not into dating at the moment\nbut um\nI think you're a really inspirational\nguy and I'd love to be friends with you\num\nI'd love to hang out with you against\nfriends\nand friend zone so I'm just like\nyeah so then that first time that's\nhappened to me but it's kind of like I'm\nan inspirational guy which is the\nbiggest bad kind of compliment I've ever\nreceived but like\nuh so yeah confused and that's kind of\nlike what prompted me to like\nexpress myself and just being like I\ndon't know what's going on but\nI guess now that\nI've um\nkind of\nexplode therapy again and I think I\nfinally found like a therapist that I\nclick with and a form of therapy that I\nresonate with\nand I think the answer for now the\nworking answer is complex PTSD which\nkind of like leaks out\nin ways that people can detect and that\nis why I yeah can't seem to\nform relationships or get second dates\nBeyond just like\nthe initial uh this guy's attractive\nthis guy's amazing on paper but then\nsomething\nnot right like\nwhat's not maybe that's a story in my\nhead as well\nthat people can\ndetect\nI don't know\nshould I have kind of a weird question\nyeah sure do you protect other people\nfrom yourself\nyes\nwhat do you think that's a help me\nunderstand I don't even know what the\n[ __ ] the question meant what did but you\nhave an answer and you seem pretty\nconfident I have an answer yeah yeah\nwhat do you mean by that\nI protect people from my darkness\nin that I have\nSuicidal Thoughts all the time\nI have like great\ndark emotions that come out of nowhere\nand I have no idea what they're about\nwhere they come from\nI guess\nthe diagnosis that I've received for\nthat as a bipolar one bipolar II bipolar\nthree cyclothymia and all of those\ndidn't really make sense so it's kind of\nlike I would have phases where\nall of a sudden I'd go from like\ncheerful and like happy to just like\nthis deep dark depression for no reason\nand I protect myself uh to protect other\npeople from that because I don't I feel\nlike I have a lot of friends I have good\nfriends I'm grateful and I have family\npeople I can rely on trust to talk to\nabout these things but it's like a heavy\nburden for them and to like put on them\nall the time be like\nso that's that's I protect people from\nthat\nokay\nso let's ask a couple more questions\nso let's say you meet someone and you\nreally like them\nshould they date you\nyes or no\ngood what's the yes what's the no\nuh the yes is I think um\nthink I'm kind\nI think I'm\nuh\nI think I'm curious I I make\nI'm really interested in people getting\nto know people\num\nI will text you back\num\nI will organize dates and I'm down to do\nromantic [ __ ]\nand\nI\npeople a woman complain about\nemotionally unavailable men but like I'm\nemotionally over available so like I'm\nhere if you want to talk about emotions\nI'm here\num\nyeah I guess\nmakes me dateable sure um I think there\nare many things about you that are very\ndateable\nthank you\num\nuh no what makes me Undateable is\nyeah mental health and\nmy emotional instability\nand\nyeah just just this feeling of Terror\nthat's like just\ntakes over me sometimes and just uh\nunsure why or what that's about\nand I guess there'd be moments where\nwhen I'm with a woman and we're on a\ndate and then they'll be like what's\nwrong are you okay\nand I'll be like I\nI would have to lie about that sometimes\nso I I don't myself no what's wrong\nI just the only explanation I have is\nthis\ncertain situations trigger memories from\nchildhood and like that's why I guess I\nget like emotional flashbacks or\nwhatever I just learned that term a\ncouple days ago but I guess that's\nwhat's happening and um\nbecoming more and more aware of these\nthings\nseemed like a good guy is sure you a\ngood guy\nI think so yeah so like let's say you\nliked someone is it a good idea for them\nto date you\nthey have the emotional\num bandwidth to handle my intensity\nand if they are empathic enough to like\nsupport me\non just yeah just whatever's going on in\nmy head which\nvery confused by sometimes\ndo you test them\nnot consciously okay what but I totally\nget that what do you think unconsciously\nyay nay\nprobably\nokay\nbecause I mean I I had kind of one\nthought which is that so you seem\ncompetent\nright like you seem like you learn\nthings and like you know how to improve\nthings and you kind of like you're\nyou're very good at I don't mean this in\nlike a dating way but like playing the\ngame right so you know how to like move\ntowards you could you can put afford a\nlot of intentionality and effort and get\nto where you want to go\nand so you've done that over and over\nand over again\nexcept for this one thing\nwhich then kind of begs the question one\nis oh my God I can't get to where I want\nto go this is the one uh problem that's\nunsolvable\nor that sounds kind of weird maybe\nyou're actually just as good at this as\nyou are at everything else\nand where you want to go with this is\nexactly where you're winding up\nwhat do you think about that\nhelp me understand that last spot like\nyeah it's kind of bizarre and I I think\nthere's a part of me that wonders are\nyou like so kind that when you go on a\ndate with someone\nand if you really like them like you\nwant to protect them from having a\nrelationship with you\nsometimes yeah\nso I mean I wonder if some of this is\njust like the reason you have difficulty\ngetting second and third dates is\nbecause you're a very effective\ncommunicator and you kind of like know\nhow to keep that from happening\nnot saying it doesn't hurt I'm not\nsaying that consciously you intend\notherwise\nbut it just makes me wonder\nwhat do you think\nwhen you say effective Communicator\num and I don't want that\nuh what do you mean by that yeah\nuh\nso so so I'm I'm kind of like I think\nthere's a lot more that we can talk\nabout I don't know that this is spot on\nbut\nso when there's someone like\nish\nthink for don't think too much about\nthis question right like should someone\ndate you\ngives it a good idea\nsometimes good\nright so so that that shows the work\nthat you've put in\nbut that it took some work to get to\nsometimes right yes and you were like\nthe and so I there's something there's a\npart of me that's like I I kind of I can\nsee a really tricky situation I don't\nknow if it's actually what's happening\nwhere the more that you connect with a\ngirl the more that you actually want\nthem the more that you care about them\nthe more you realize you know what\nyou're probably off better off with\nsomeone else\nand I don't think it's conscious\nbut I think there's It's tricky because\nif you're like genuinely a good person\nand you genuinely care about people and\nyou try to protect them like the best\nsolution is like don't date me\ndoes that resonate with you at all\nI think so I think either at a\nsubconscious level yeah I think if I'm\nlike\nyeah I think\nthe woman that I was talking about that\nI really connected with last time\nshe expressed to me that like she used\nto date like a famous musician or\nsomething and like that really triggered\nme because I was like what is she doing\non a date with me or she can like\nliterally date anybody that was one of\nmy first thoughts\nand then I guess after the date\nduring the date we were talking about\nlike gender norms and stuff and like\nI I noticed that she said that I was\nlike she noticed I noticed she said\nsomething like I like I like initiating\nthings sometimes\nso then at the end of the day she's like\na lot like I had a great time and then\nlike\nyou know it was it was an amazing day\nand um I was like\num oh maybe you should initiate the\nsecond day like maybe maybe you should\nplan the second day\nand\num he was like yeah I'd love that and it\nlike text me and I think yeah for four\ndays like I didn't text her because I\nwas expecting her to set up the day and\ntext me\nand maybe that was a way for me to\nprotect myself against\ngetting hurt getting rejected and maybe\nsubconsciously I was like don't date me\nI yeah I mean I I'm not it's an\ninteresting idea I\nthat just seemed there's so many other\nvariables there\nI\nso so for like second dates and third\ndates what happens after that\nI haven't gone many second dates\nwhat happens after your first date\num most often it's just like um\nI would text them again like if I hey\nlove to see you again I had a good time\nand\neither I'd get ghosted\nuh or I would um just be like hey I\nwasn't feeling it or just some variation\nof just some pleasantry\nand then most recently friend zone which\nis like a new one um\nand yeah\ndo you have fun during dates\nsometimes\na lot of sometimes\nyeah honestly like I think I think the\nbecause\nI would say like the first\n20 or 30 dates that I've been on in my\nlife like it was really like exposure\ntherapy for me like I'm just doing this\nto like I'm socially anxious so I just\nwant to like literally just sit here and\nlike have like a five minute\nconversation then a 10 minute call I was\ndoing that right so it's like\nmy flight of flight response was just\nlike triggered during dates and then wow\nthat's really impressive dude\nthank you that you could do that that\nsounds really hard\nyeah thank you\nso I guess my early dating experiences\nwere just that like exposure therapy\num\nand like\nI would I would say that I wasn't really\nhaving all that much fun because I was\njust like in this like\nhyper Vigilant state\num and recently my dating experiences\nhave just been like I guess going\nthrough this the toxic dating pickup\nstuff would be like getting an outcome\nso I'd be like the outcome is getting\nlaid like the whole thing is and I guess\nit makes sense for a marketing\nperspective because it's like do this\ncourse and you'll get laid like there's\nan outcome it needs to have an outcome\nwas when buying to it\nso it would be like yeah I'm going on\nthese dates and I'm doing this like\nPlaybook of like things to do things to\nsay and like how to like escalate\nphysically and then like how long to\nspend on a day before you like invite\nthe girl home and then\nyou know like do this and and like have\nsex like this and then just what it's\nlike this whole formula and I'm like\ndoing it going through the motions\nand I'm just like this is just stupid\nbut like at the same time I don't really\nknow this this is the only thing that\nkind of like Works quote unquote so I'm\njust like let's just keep doing this and\nuh more do it more do it more MTF I\nrealized like I wasn't really having fun\nbut\nat least I was getting late that's\nbetter than like jerking off so\num but I realize I'm just like\nmasturbating with another person so it\nactually didn't make me feel any better\nyeah I think that's very insightful\nhow are you feeling now\nI don't I don't really know honestly\nI feel a lot of different things but I\ndon't really know if there's one thing I\ncan pinpoint yeah what are you feeling\nwhat are the different things\nI feel\nI feel like this is like kind of surreal\nthat I'm talking to you like that's\nprobably like the overwhelming feeling\nit's like\nlike discovering you and just like kind\nof like fanboying over you and I'm like\nnow I'm talking to you it doesn't feel\nreal\num that's kind of like\nyeah probably the main thing I'm feeling\nand\nwhy is it well we got we gotta get past\nthat I mean\nyou know\nI guess we're lag Spike for a second\num I was gonna say like we gotta we\ngotta you know get past that get to the\nactual stuff like okay sure I mean which\nI I guess maybe I'm not helping but I I\ndon't\nyeah okay so\ncan I think for a second\nmaybe more than a second-ish\ndo you have friends who are women\nI not in real life but I have\nrelationships with my cousins I have\npretty good relationships and they're a\nwoman\nokay\nand um it sounds like you had somewhat\nof a rough childhood or something right\nbecause you mentioned cptsd\nyes\num\nare you\ncomfortable telling us about the impact\nof that you don't have to go into detail\nbut I'm curious like you know what\nso you said that 10 years ago you\nstarted this journey of fixing yourself\nand what I'm curious about is where did\nyou get the idea that you're broken\num\nyeah I guess just emotional verbal\nphysical abuse from growing up\num\nfeeling a little bit like not a little\nbit but like body just more fear as well\num\nlearning that like my face is deformed\nin some way I'm picking that up from\nyeah people around me\num\nuh\nbeing bullied and just being feeling\nlike I'm just quiet and I don't talk\nmuch and that means there's something\ndefective about me overwhelming that's\ncan't quite a felt also like I like a\nblack sheep of the family just this\nweird kid in the corner\ndoesn't say much\num doesn't have much to say\njust hyper Vigilant I think yeah I think\nI think the effects of all of that is\njust hyper vigilance like I didn't\nI don't really feel safe\num I was always on on edge on guard like\nand\npeople pleasing is another effect like\nbeing feeling responsible for other\npeople's emotions and\nfeeling like\nI'm responsible for anything like it's\nmy fault I'm a bad person and yeah\nit's interesting how you can\narticulate it so well but that doesn't\nhelp very much does it\nno\nwhat are you feeling now\nuh I feel like um\nno actually like what I said about like\nthe fan blowing stuff what I feel is\nlike\nI feel like\nbeing seen in my vulnerability\nis like\nI feel like\nI'm feeling proud of myself like\nand it's like a form of self-acceptance\nto like put my face on the internet and\nlike talk about these things which I've\nbeen terrified to talk about\nso\nI feel kind of like\nI feel like Joy a little bit of Joy\nabout myself\nyeah I've been wanting to tell you that\nI'm proud of you this whole time but I\nwas afraid that that would not work out\nwell\nI'm feeling PR I'm feeling proud of\nmyself and I'm proud of you\nthank you\nnow I'm uncomfortable but yeah yeah\nwhy is that\nnever been told that before\nand now you're checking right making eye\ncontact making sure what is what is my\nfacial expression saying\nI saw that little glance\nyeah\nyou're in danger mode now right\nyes it feels very scary right now yeah\nit's tough man\nshould we make a dick joke\nsure\nlove my dick jokes\nas do I hey that's something we share\num\nyou ready to hear this dick joke\nsure my dick\nthanks\nyeah so I I think it's it's interesting\nhuh\nso what's it like to have someone\nbe proud of you\nunfamiliar\nunfamiliar unknown Danger\nyeah I see that so I asked you a couple\ntimes what you were feeling and actually\nwhat I saw in your face was like\nactually genuine positive emotion it's a\nflash\nnot that\nthat was different\nbut\nthat there we're getting a little bit\nbetter that caught you\nright and and it can be hard\nit can be hard\nand and I I think it's like you were you\nwould say I don't know and I think it's\nso interesting because what I'm hearing\nis you're very familiar with your\nnegative feelings but like positive ones\nare just\nyou know there's touches of Joy like and\nyou've had to work so hard for each each\nof those\nuh what I think is honestly really I\ndon't think you are sad but like what\nmakes me sad hearing your story is how\nhard you've had to work for every slice\nof something positive in your life\nthat sounds incredibly unfair to me\nany thoughts about that\nyeah\num\nit's exhausting\num and\nI guess myself about it\noh\nbut\nto be\nuh we're lagging for a second let me see\nif I can enjoy oh there we go it looks\nlooks like we're back\num you were saying that you were the\nlast thing that we caught was you were\ngaslighting yourself\nyeah gaslighting myself and that like I\nhave like on paper I have a lot going\nfor me in my life\nso it's like I should feel happy I\nshould feel Joy I should like feel some\nlike positive emotions and and the fact\nthat I don't makes me feel guilty it's\nlike I compare myself I'm like people\nhave it so much worse than me\nif they're happier and like\nthat's that's part of that and I feel\nshame I feel guilt for that that\ncompounds\nthe negative emotions\nand like\nyeah yeah I think um\nso I want to just share another thought\nthat I kind of noticed so when you\nstarted going to the gym how did you\nfeel about yourself\nI felt um\nwhen I have soft discipline and I\ndemonstrate self-love to myself taking\ncare of myself it makes me feel good\nabout myself\nbecause I'm showing myself that I'm\nworthy of taking care of\nand\nbut then there's that uh\nachiever thing that comes in which is\nlike\noh [ __ ] like I'm I should be like\nI've gone to the gym like now like x\namount of time and my body fat is still\nnot this and then that's like\nthe shame comes in and I look around and\nI'll be like [ __ ] like all these other\npeople are like way better than me like\nand then it comes like okay let's fix\nthis again let's get a personal trainer\nand then it just gets into this like\nlike be better let's do more and be more\nvaluable whatever and that [ __ ] it up\nand but like the initial like okay I'm\nwaking up I'm packing my Bears and going\nto the gym cool but then when there's\nlike outcomes and stuff and I'm like\nshaming myself or like feeling guilty\nfor not\nreaching these outcomes these arbitrary\nthings that I said for myself then\nit doesn't feel good yeah so ish what\nI'm noticing is that when you're taking\naction you can feel proud of yourself\nbut when you accomplish something\nparadoxically it seems to evoke shame I\ndon't think you it's very paradoxical at\nall but\nlike that's what I'm hearing does that\nseem right to you\nyeah it's almost like I can't be proud\nof\nthe accomplishments almost like don't\nregister I can't be 100 and what do you\nthink that does for your sense of\nself-worth\nmakes it worse\nabsolutely\nso the reason I I mean maybe I'm\novershooting here a little bit and I\nthink that I'm really happy to hear that\nif there's complex PTSD involved and\nsome of that other stuff that you're\nseeing a therapist because I would work\non this with them but\nI just want to point out to you like\nwhat I see is that you take the W's in\nyour life and you turn them into owls\nyeah\nlike that just ain't gonna work man\nthere's no\nyou know\nand and this is where I can share some\ninformation like any thoughts or\nreactions to that before I keep going\nyeah resonates\nand I think here's the real problem\nlike oh do you actually so let me ask\nyou\nhow do you think someone does that how\ndoes someone how does that happen to\nsomeone's mind\nand if you want to just think about your\nown life that's\nyou'll find an answer there but if not I\njust love to hear your thoughts before I\nshare my perspective\num\nI guess it's just\nlike zero time for generalized but like\nI guess Asian parents anymore it's just\nkind of like\na minus why is that not an A plus yep\ndo this like why can't I came second in\nthis national competition why don't you\ncome first\num\nyeah all these other kids are better\nthan you\num\nlike\nthis cousin or that cousin is doing this\nand that like you're a piece of [ __ ]\nlike in comparison\nso it's just like I don't know\nnothing I ever do is ever going to be\ngood for seeking the validation of the\nperson seeking approval of the person\none person that I've wanted my whole\nlife\num it's never going to be enough I could\nbe\nuh I could be like a superhero and a\nstore wouldn't be enough it could be a\nphilanthic person a billionaire blah\nblah blah it wouldn't be enough let's do\nsomething else so\nthat's my that's my guess yeah\nwhat are you feeling now\nI don't yeah I kind of I don't really\nknow again\nokay\nso is it does it bother you that I keep\nasking you that question and do you feel\nuncomfortable saying I don't know and\nlike oh my God like I should know the\nanswer\nyeah it's like I should know the answer\nyeah I don't think I'm not knowing yeah\nsorry I I just noticed now I'm piecing\nthings together\num\nI don't think you're dumb for not\nknowing\nokay can I please explain why\nsure\nso you beat yourself up right random\nSuicidal Thoughts lots of Shame\nwhat were you taught about yourself ish\nwhen you were growing up\nwhat did you learn about who you are\nalert that I was ugly\num my face is defected\num I learned that\nI'm weird because I don't talk much I\ndon't say much\nI'm not that I was too sensitive\num\nI learned that\nI shouldn't trust people\nI learned that money is everything like\nif I get money then I'm gonna be okay in\nlife and\nfriends are gonna betray you people are\ngoing to betray you\num\nuh did Friends betray you or you learned\nthat from your parents that friends\ncan't be trusted\nI learned that from\nmy caregivers yeah\nthey told you that friends can't be\ntrusted\nokay\nso\nI mean here's the thing right so like is\nso no one no one has ever expressed\nbeing proud of you\nlike for realsies\nthe fact that I have to think so much\nabout it probably says\nmaybe somewhere but I can't really\nremember I mean so can I tell you what I\nI yeah go ahead actually I do remember\none time\nis um well I guess the only time in my\nchildhood was\nwhen I like\nwhen I achieve things is the sounding\nmoment\nI felt someone was proud of me\num\nand the first time was\nyeah I won this like\na national competition of like web\ndesign and I was like in the newspaper\nthe local newspaper and stuff\nand that was the first moment where I\nfelt like\nsomeone was proud of me and I learned\nthat like in order to make people proud\nof me I need to like achieve things\nand that's the only way I need to be the\nbest otherwise\nit's not good enough and who was proud\nof you\nmy dad\nI'm gonna just need a second to digest\nthat\num\nyeah so here's what I'm hearing-ish\nI think so like you kids learn language\nright and did you grow up in a in a\nbilingual household\nyes\nso do you mind if I ask what language\nwas spoken at home\nEnglish and Telugu okay\num so you know like if you think about\nit like how do you learn Telugu like\nit's just what's spoken at home right\nyes and so but\nlanguages are not the only things that\nwe learn we also learn\nabout ourselves like we're going to\ninternalize whatever\nyou know\nwe're going to internalize like whatever\nwe're taught about ourselves so like\nkids like I'm sure you've seen little\nkids that are entitled little pos's that\nthink they're the you know\nthe best thing that God ever created and\nlike how do they learn to believe that\nit's because that's what they're told\nthey're told that you have a different\nset of rules for you all the other kids\nget one set of rules but your daddy or\nMommy's little special boy and you get a\nwhole different set of rules where you\nget to break whatever rules you want to\nand it's gonna be okay because Mommy and\nDaddy are powerful and we're going to\nprotect you from consequences\nokay\nand and I think the reason that it's\nlike like Pride makes you uncomfortable\nor like other people and this is where\nit's you know\nthe fact that it was your dad is\nactually devastating because we don't\nreally know and we're not gonna ask\nactually on on purpose because I think\nthat goes a little bit I mean you can\nsay if you want to but I'm not trying to\npressure you but\nyou know sometimes when you have a child\nwho has a parent who they're trying to\nlive up to\nand there is one case of pride\nthat [ __ ] the kid\nbecause now they have like one\nopportunity that they have in North Star\nwhere they know this works and they go\nchasing that thing over and over and\nover again\noddly enough what's actually bizarrely\nhealthier in my experience is that if\nthe parent is has zero chances of the\nabuser\nhas a zero\ninteraction of Pride then the child\nhopefully will find another human being\nand then they'll get Pride from\nsomewhere else but if you get it once\nit's almost like more damaging because\nthen you know it's possible like you\nfelt it before and it feels so good and\nthat feeling is like oh my God it's\neverything you've ever wanted\nyes because if you could do that then\nyour self-worth would be good right\nbecause like\nand and so I think what's kind of\nchallenging here so first of all I don't\nthink your dating problems have anything\nto do with\nanything except for in a sense you\nI I do think that and that also I don't\nthink is your fault and I have a couple\nof thoughts for you about\nspirituality and stuff but you know my\nfirst thought is like you've got to be\nyou've got I don't want to trigger the\ncomplex in you that says I need to be\nbetter\nokay so like that we have to be super\ncareful about because that's actually\nlike playing into a bad belief set\nso I don't know does that make sense\nyeah so if you need to be better that\npresumes that you're unacceptable in\nyour current state\nso there are things that you can do and\ngrow but like\ndon't let that part of you that says oh\nmy God I have to do this to be a decent\nhuman being you're a decent human being\nalready you're a good dude\nI think you have a lot like can I tell\nyou what I see\nsure and pay attention to yourself okay\nand if you don't know how this makes you\nfeel ask yourself is that a positive\nfeeling and I just don't recognize it\nbecause it's kind of unfamiliar okay\nokay\nso first of all I see someone who was\nborn into very hard circumstances\nmay have had\nsome advantages to be sure but was\nreally born in a place where they were\nlike\nnot loved very much\nand I think that that's sad and I think\nthat's unfair\nI see someone who despite\nall of the challenges of their\nupbringing\nhas through sweat Blood and Tears like\nrisen out of that\nand has done everything that the world\nhas asked them to do\nand I think it's incredibly sad that you\ncan do all of the right things and still\nend up in the place that you are and\nthat's what feels the most unfair to me\nand what I see is someone who's\nincredibly resilient I see someone who's\nincredibly courageous I see someone who\ndespite life taking every opportunity to\nbeat you down refuses to be beaten down\nI see endurance stamina\nI don't see hope\nbut there's I don't I don't know what's\ndriving you maybe it's desperation and\nmost of all I see someone who's\nincredibly tired\nand who I want nothing more for you than\nto be able to rest\nI want nothing more for you than to be\nable to go on a date and not have to\nthink about all that stuff\nI want you to be able to go on a date\nand instead of asking yourself how do I\nget this person to like me or notice me\nor love me or get laid I want you to I\nwould love it if you could go on a date\nand ask yourself is this person right\nfor me\nis this person deserve to date me do I\nwant to be with this person\nmost of all I I'm I'm proud of you dude\nI think it's like I'm proud of you\nand what you've accomplished\nthanks\ncan you stop saying thanks by the way\nlet's try again\nwait what do I say instead I don't know\nyou don't say anything\nokay so I want you to notice what thanks\ndoes to you okay so we're gonna try it\ntwice a little experiment so first\nI'm proud of you\nthanks\nwhat did that do when you say that\num let's try without maybe you'll notice\nthe difference\nI'm proud of you\nit's like sinking in more of the second\nsecond time yeah so I think you kind of\nlike deflect it with the thanks because\nthanks is like you're closing it off\nyou're like moving on\ndoes that make sense\nokay yeah right because you're you're\nyou're like that's actually like\nblocking the interaction you're not like\nand I know it's polite I know you've\nlearned how to do it\nbut what did it feel like hearing me say\nall that stuff\ngood\nin what way\nit's about validating\ndo you deserve\nyou deserve to be valid like validating\nalso it's like\nis it real though\nit's starting to become it's starting to\nfeel like I deserve it\ndo you deserve it\nyes\nis that the is that your heart speaking\nor your headset that's my mind yep what\ndoes your heart say\nmy heart is still it is\nthere's a whole construction site there\nwith like walls everywhere yeah yeah so\ndo we need to get you to say yes do we\nneed to have you believe that you\ndeserve happiness\nno you're damn right we don't\nwhy not\nI don't have evidence for that yet\nokay\nright answer in my opinion the wrong\nconclusion\nI mean sorry the right conclusion but\nthe wrong reasoning so here's why so I I\nthink you're great the Way You Are\neven if you don't have evidence like I\ndon't think you need to fix that I think\nthe biggest problem is is that you don't\nneed to fix really anything I think\nyou're great the way that you are\nand I don't\nI know that's gonna sound foreign to you\ndoes it sound foreign\nyou see when I um\nget into like phases of I guess\nself-care and like routine\nso when I'm doing a lot of meditation I\nlove journaling and I'm like\nyou know doing things chasing my\npassions and things like that like I do\nfeel I get into states where I do feel\nthat and\nhowever it's like these phases are like\nthree to six months at a time and then\nlike if I don't do like there's like\nfive things I have to do every morning\nto feel like that I feel worthy of Love\nor feel self-compassion and self-love if\nsomething slips and then the routine\nFalls away then I'm back to just\nself-loathing so it's very fragile but I\ndo feel that and I have felt that but\nit's like\nmy understanding of it is like I'm just\nbypassing and I'm not like the phases\nwhere I feel amazing it's like I'm just\nbypassing the actual group of like\nthing yeah I can I can totally\nunderstand that and and that's why like\nI know it sounds kind of bizarre but\nlike\nthis is so tricky-ish because all of\nyour effort is to get away from that\nthing\nyep but it's a part of you and you just\ncarry it with you\nyes and so you can block it out for\nthree six months at a time and I think\nhonestly like this is where like real\nhealing like\nhas got to take place but in your case I\nthink that healing is going to be hard\nbecause I think of for a big part of\nthat healing is actually accepting that\nyou don't need to be any different\nyeah\nright you've been chasing you've been\ntrying to fix something like over and\nover and over again and it's like and\nthis is where like you said okay I fixed\neverything externally now I need to fix\nit internally actually you don't need to\nfix it internally because you ain't\nbroken\nyou're actually fine just the way that\nyou are like you know you suffer a\nlittle bit sure or you suffer a lot sure\nand that may sound kind of bizarre\nbecause here you are at randomly having\nsuicidal thoughts house is not broken\nbut that that's just that's just a piece\nof you\nhmm\nand it's kind of like this is a really\ntrick I can see why it's really hard for\nthis to work because or everything\nyou've tried quote unquote hasn't worked\nbecause bizarrely like the more that you\ntry to fix it the more that you\nreinforce the idea that you're broken\nyes\nand so bizarrely like it's really weird\nbut you gotta kind of like say like okay\nlike here's the thing okay so if I say\nyou're broken how does that you're\nbroken ish how does that sound\nvalidating okay now here's the weird\nthing I agree\nyou're busted like fundamentally busted\nokay I'm serious\nyeah\nhere's the other wild thing I think\nthat's perfectly okay\nI think you had some trauma growing up\nand there's a PC that's kind of [ __ ]\nI don't think it determines the rest of\nyour life\nI don't think that you need to fix it I\nthink it's just a consequence of your\nkarma\nand that it's not your fault and it's\nactually not your responsibility to fix\nit that what you should fix are the\nthings that you want to fix\nforeign\nnot what you should fix\nhow does that sit with you\num\nthe thing with like\num the responsibility is like\nI do feel like it's part of my karma and\nI don't have resentment towards the\npeople person that like you know\ninflicted this pain onto me\nbecause\nI have empathy for the person and like\nI've worked on letting go of that\nresentment because I feel like\nor people who hurt people\nso\nI know that but then it's like\nI feel like what's happened has happened\nand I've kind of made amends with the\npast and but like I'm still carrying\nthis like Cannonball of like\nsome scars or whatever\nI feel like it's my responsibility\nto fix that\nto like and and I guess healing is\nanother thing\nMaybe It's tricky to be like is this\nanother thing to fix and that's what I'm\nconfused about like yeah because\nI go to there if I go to therapy and\nthen I also do you like spiritual\npractices and all these things and\nis that\nlike you're trying to I'm trying to\ndigest these unprocessed emotions\nthrough meditation and stuff and is that\nnot fixing another thing yeah so it\nwould be not fixing as well yeah your\nbeautiful question I think you're gonna\nhate the answer\nand unfortunately I've got one for you\nsure does it need to be fixed absolutely\ndo you need to heal ish 100 percent\nbut it's not your responsibility\nokay\nso I can hear if I want to but I don't\nnope you can't heal if you want to other\npeople had to do it for you\nhow\nit's a good question\nhow does that sound to you\nit sounds good because\nsomething that I've recently been able\nto do is like ask for help\nmore than I've ever done in my in my\nwhole life and\nI'm proud of myself for that because\nit's very hard to do because I've been\ntaught that I can't ask for help and I\nhave to be hyper independent and fix\neverything myself but\nI think\nother people helping me\nyeah like\nI mean I'm talking to you and that's\nthat's like I'm allowing you to help me\nas opposed to\nreading like 13 books on spirituality\nand trying to figure out myself\nso yeah I think\nI agree with that yeah so I Think It's\nTricky right because\nthe the biggest kind of scam that we\ntell ourselves so like who made you this\nway ish\ndid you create this for yourself\nno\nso the biggest scam that we tell\nourselves is when someone else does\nsomething to us\nthat we're the ones who can fix it\nthis is I mean it's not\na hundred percent true because there's a\nlot that you can do\nbut when I say there's a lot you can do\nyou've done it all\nyeah right like you've done your piece\nbro I don't know what else to do yeah\nyeah so it and this is what's hard about\nlife and I think this is where like we\nsee the end of what like personal\ndevelopment can do I'm not saying stop\ndoing yoga and like do your five things\nand all that kind of stuff by all means\nright\nbut I I think there's there's this this\nquestion of like I asked you some time\nago like who can you rely on and like\nthat's the problem because I I think\nthat at some point like if someone else\nhas taught you how to hate yourself\nsomeone else really has to teach you how\nto love yourself\nand that's what's so terrifying is like\nthen it's out of our control\nand that's also what's so liberating\nbecause you're damn right it's out of\nyour control so you can chill the [ __ ]\nout\nand you don't have to wake up every day\nand do your five things and go sign up\nfor this course and go sign up for that\nof course because when it's in your\ncontrol when you're the only one who you\ncan rely on like everything is on you\nand you're looking for a relationship\nbut like you're a monolith like there's\nno Mutual\nanything\nwhat do you mean by that monolith like I\nthink you're you're like you've got all\nthese walls like you're you're a solo\nyou're like a pillar and there's no\nthere's no I would guess like not a\nwhole I know that you kind of like\ntrauma bonded or maybe like share it a\nlittle bit too much and there's like a\nvery practical sense that people may not\nbe ready for that but I I don't know if\nyou\nuh something about this makes makes me\nfeel like you're not really ready to be\ninterdependent with someone\nyeah\nso what I'm hearing is that you can be\nvery emotionally available\nyou can be someone's therapist\nand there are times where you flip\nthings around where you open up too much\nand you dump on them but I'm not hearing\nthat you're ready to be interdependent\nokay\nbut I I think it's going to be tough but\nI think you should do it actually\nexactly I'm optimistic for you like I\nthink you can heal like I think work\nwith that therapist I think reaching out\nto the internet and having the internet\nanswer your call is like\nbecause you're deserving of help like\nyou're and you don't have to do it on\nyour own\nand like start I'm happy to hear you're\nstarting to rely on other people because\nI think that's when you're going to\nreally feel like\nbecause like one day you're gonna think\noh I don't deserve it\nthoughts Reflections questions\nyeah so the thing with like\nbeing not ready for interdependence\nit's become this thing was like at what\npoint am I ready and not knowing that\nbecause it's like\nas if I look back on my\nlife for the last again maybe even 20\nyears like all I've ever wanted was like\na girlfriend or like some kind of\nlong-term\ncommitted healthy relationship\nand\nI guess like at what point am I ready\nfor that and how do I determine that I'm\nready for that the other part of the\nquestion is\num\nlike\nrelying on some like being\nin a relationship wouldn't\nlike\nallow somebody to support me or like\nlove me in the way that I guess\nwould make me feel like I'm worthy of\nhelp\nyeah I'm sorry I didn't catch that last\npart being in a relationship wouldn't\nallow someone to would allow somebody to\nlike take care like yeah no bro you got\nto find that relationship before you're\nready for it\nyou can't let writing this\nstop you from\nbut then you said I'm not ready for\ninterdependence I'm like yeah yeah\nright ready\nuh probably after you've become\ninterdependent or after you've found\nthat person\nI know it sounds kind of weird\nbut to be honest like I I I think that\nwhen you're when you're ready and I\ndon't know what exactly what I mean by\nthat like I think you should continue\ndating but I I think try to as best as\nyou can like be yourself like work with\nthat therapist heal some of that trauma\ndon't overly emotionally dump\nbut I think like really the main thing\nis like open yourself up\nto something without thinking about the\noutcome\nright and and really like\nwhat I would\nand I think this is plagued with\nproblematic so this is the least\nconfident thing that I feel like good\nabout but I would say like if you want\nto go on a date like really just try to\nI know it sounds kind of generic and I'm\nsure you've tried this before but really\njust try to get to know someone and try\nto see like\nhow does this person make me feel\nwhat amount do I want to share how do I\nfeel about them because I I think that\nthere's a certain organicness which is\ngoing to be required I don't think\nyou're going to heal a hundred percent\nand then be ready for a relationship\nI think oftentimes the most impactful\nrelationships happen when we're not\nready\nand that's where some amount of\nyou know like caution control but also\nlike foolishness like foolishness is an\nimportant part of every really\nsuccessful relationship I don't think\nyou're being stupid enough\nyou know\nyeah\nand and I think it's just you're trying\nso hard dude like just let let them do\nsome of the work\nsure let other people carry you ish like\nyou've been carrying yourself for long\nenough dude\nyeah there's definitely\nlightness there's a playful side of me\nwhich is silly and sarcastic and\nthat's what I want to like engage with\nbecause it's fun yeah but\nit's locked away\ntrying to be\nwhy is it locked away\nagain maybe I was just taught to like\nthat's\nit's not alpha or like just some\n[ __ ] about some conditioning about\nwhat to say what not to say what kind of\njokes to make\nso it's like again like I said there's a\ndatabase of [ __ ] which is old [ __ ]\nthat I'm just I'm like trying to delete\nthe row by row like every day like good\nyeah I I I see your situation is\nactually like a lot more unlearning than\nlearning\nyeah there's including like the most\nimportant stuff to unlearn is all the\ntraumatic [ __ ]\nand and I think like because you're not\nI don't see you being you\nsometimes you're you I think you've\nlearned how to\nyou know mine it from time to time\nyeah I don't know who I am like\nto be honest like yeah and I think I've\ngrown up like a social chameleon like I\ncan be whoever you want me to be you can\nplay characters\nso finding out\nwho I am\nI don't know it's the Eternal question\nbut\nI don't know\njust because you've asked it so far\ndoesn't mean it's eternal\nwell it's been it's been the question\nare you acting for us today\nno yeah I think we know you quite well\nwhat am I acting today\nyeah I I believe you I I think I've\nwe've seen\nmeasures of it but I I think that you\nare showing the more positive side of\nyourself\nyou're taking some of those instinctive\nreactions and then turning them into\nwhat Dr K and the community want to hear\nwhich is like yeah I can love myself\nsometimes like yeah\nit's like honest yeah\nyeah there's a bit of performance as\nwell yeah for sure I think but we see\nthat too and I think we see through it\ntoo is but sometimes it can feel very\nhard for people to be seen through or is\nthis hard for you today\nuh in what way\nare you thinking that you're misplaying\nor like oh my God like I should have\nsaid this or I should have done this or\nI looked stupid here or sounded stupid\nthere I don't know the answers\nlike during this during me talking to\nyou not so much but I think like leading\nup to this and there was a lot of\nbecause I've watched a lot of these\ninterviews there's a lot of like\nthings I want to talk about like blah\nblah blah but it's like it's not being\npresent it's not being spontaneous and\nthat's what a conversation is so\nyeah\nyou're proud of yourself\num\nI see that\nthat's that's very neither [ __ ] water\nbottle\nyeah nervous nervous yeah right yeah\ninteresting\nyeah so I will I won't torture you much\nlonger because I like and that's like\ntake take the pride take the love and\nyou eat it you eat every last bite-ish\nwe're gonna give it to you\nand no I mean I I think um\none thing I would recommend is like\ndon't overthink this dude like don't\nwatch it again anytime soon like\nseriously don't watch it\nlike give yourself at least a month like\nI'm really concerned about what your\nmind will do you're gonna pick up on all\nthe wrong things you're gonna think oh I\nI should answer this question\ndifferently like honestly I'm not\nI'm very happy with today you don't have\nto be\nabout how how do you feel about today\nI feel good\ndo you have any questions or thoughts or\nReflections like\nand we still have to go\nI guess just um\nfrom a practical perspective moving\nforward like\nwell\nshould I kind of focus on I guess the\nmain thing is like stop trying let go\nunlearning things but in terms of like\nmoving forward to\nuh with my goal in mind which is like\nyou know\none day\nhaving kids or like being in out the\nloving committed relationship\nwhere would I how do I go from here like\nand like what does that kind of look\nlike I know that's a big question but no\nit's it's a very it's a very big\nquestion and I have a very\nwhat I think is a good but unsatisfying\nanswer you need to stop trying to go\nfrom here\nthat's the [ __ ] problem\nokay\nnow what does that look like that's hard\nbut this is what I mean it's like yeah\nlike you're right-ish like you've been\nlike paying attention because you're\nlike a good you're Indian\nyes you're good Indian boy and you've\nbeen paying attention you know what the\nright answer is right so you're like how\ndo I like go on from here you try harder\nto not try\nso you've spent your whole life trying\nto make other people happy trying to\nmake yourself happy for the last 10\nyears you've been growing and changing\nand moving on from here I think you need\nto sit down for a little while\nstop trying\nso trying is like good for a lot of\nthings it'll make you the money that it\nmakes you it'll get you the body that it\ngets you\nit'll get you laid\nbut you've been your strategy has been\ntrying\nand and\nI know it sounds kind of weird but like\nsit\nwith yourself and don't move on\nlike because you don't need to go\nanywhere\nand I know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike if you want those things in life\nI'm not saying that you\nif you sit around\nthat are gonna happen but like in your\ncase let them come to you\nlike on a weird\nI don't know like\nMorning Show yoga pants wearing kind of\nway like you're you're like trying so\nhard to find a relationship that you're\nnot letting a relationship find you\nthat's the kind of thing that like 10 of\npeople out there will hear that be like\noh my God that's so profound and like 90\nwhat the [ __ ] does that even mean\nbut I mean seriously like this is one of\nthose situations where just like slow\ndown man like give yourself a month or\ntwo months like continue going to\ntherapy continue with your routine but\ntry stop trying so hard try to like be\nwith yourself for a little bit\nand the Very the other practical thing\nis don't shut people down who are proud\nof you\nlet people be proud of you let people\nExpress gratitude\nhow do I you know how you said like\ndon't say thank you in that way\nhow do I like absorb that like how do I\ntake compliment or like that kind of\nthing\nso this is going to be wild\nso if that's the right question and\nyou're just you need to do something\nbetter okay fine\nso here's what I would I would ask them\ncan you help me understand that\nso when they say like ish I think you're\nan amazing human let's try\nokay\nish I think you're an amazing human\nbeing\ncan you help me understand that yeah\nabsolutely so like I think that you've\ngot a lot of advantages and I think\nyou've had a lot of hardships and I\nthink the fact that you're still on this\nEarth is like I can understand why that\nperson wanted to be your friend and was\ninspired by you because I think you're\nthe kind of person that inspires people\nlike she thought that oh my God if I get\nlaid this guy's gonna move on but like I\nneed this person to help me transform my\nown life\nso that that I can understand a lot\nbecause when I when a lot of people look\nat you they see someone who's been able\nto transform their life\nhow's that\nit's good\nright\nlet's just uh say nothing is this weird\nlike yeah it is it is [ __ ] weird yeah\nso so you could you could\nyou could like like but I I would I\nwould pick and and choose\nlike who you want to say that with but\nif you genuinely because I I think the\nother thing that happens is like it's\nreally your way of shutting down the\nconversation I think a part of you\nbelieves it but a part of you doesn't\nright when people like say nice things\nabout you\nyeah that's paranoia\nyeah so so and that's where like in that\nmoment I I don't know if this is getting\nkind of very minute but there's a\nthere's a lot of like shutting off of\nyour mind or closing off of your mind\nwhen you say thank you\nright and so what I what I encourage you\nto do and it probably feels to you like\noh my God I'm fishing for compliments\nright if I like ask people to explain it\nbut like if you can do it with an open\nmind really try to understand because\nhow the [ __ ] can this person think this\nabout me\num\nand just ask them can you help me\nunderstand that it didn't seem to me\nlike what I did was that significant\nright and you can just own that piece\nand then like have them say something\nand then like really try to listen to\nwhat they have to say\nokay\ndoes that help or yeah yeah it does\nnow one\nI don't know mind like okay that's\nthat's usually a good sign do you have\nother questions or thoughts\nI mean I've got a million questions\nabout like I I think I just don't need\nto\nI've learned that knowing things is\noverrated so I don't want to know\nanything\nI don't want to do anything anymore\nI think that sounds fantastic\nso that I mean I I hope you're not\npretending to be what we want you to be\nbut I think that's a prime example of\nexactly what we're talking about you've\ngot a million questions but you're not\ngoing to ask a single one because\njust be right go cuddle your cat and\nlike\nI don't know what you're gonna do for\nthe rest of the day but like go go do\nsomething for you like be exist and live\nand feel\nyeah I'm going to like a\nan acting class something that I've\nalways wanted to do\nI'm really excited for that and I'm just\ndoing this for myself and\nyeah\nbeautifully other people there so\nI hear you\nthey're gonna be other people there nice\nthere's gonna be other people there Adam\nmaybe I'm not I'm I get to perform in\nlike an intentional way I get to maybe\nI've been acting my whole life and why\nnot do it intentionally yeah go and have\na good time\nyes okay okay\nlistenish thank you very much from our\nperspective I I really appreciate you\nposting I don't know I I actually took\nso this was kind of a funny story but my\nteam reached out to you separately from\nme\nright\nand so I didn't know that they reached\nout to you but I I saw your post tonight\nDMD real quick\num I don't know if I'm your if you\nresponded back I don't know if I'm gonna\nsee that but I think you know you're\ndeserving of help dude and you're gonna\nget it like you don't have to do it all\nyourself like life is multiplayer game\nmy dude\nand good luck to you and thank you for\ncoming on and being vulnerable and\nhonest and sharing I'm really happy to\nhear that you found a therapist that\nyou're really working with I think that\neases my mind a lot\nand I think that things are going to get\neasier for you pretty soon as my\nhonest hope and also belief\nso take care of my dude\ncheers adios\nlet me how do I click this up\nokay chat\nso thoughts\nquestions\nYeah man so I I think that's the thing\nright so this guy is struggling to\nconnect\nand and this is like this is the tricky\nthing\nso\nwe try so hard\nto connect with other people\nand in doing so\nwe fail to connect with them because the\nharder that you try to connect to\nsomeone\nthe harder it actually becomes to\nconnect\nand so this is like what's so weird\nright is like ish comes on today\nand he's like yeah I have a lot of stuff\nto be proud of and I'm I've learned and\nwe can see right like in his answers I\nthink his answers were pretty honest\nhe's like sometimes he's worked so hard\nhe's like carved out positivity from\nlike Stone\nlike it wasn't like\ncutting through paper it was like he had\nto carve out each one of those answers\nand he comes on here and he's like yeah\nI'm kind of like\nyou know I mean I I hope he wasn't bsing\nus too much because he's probably good\nenough to BS if he wanted to\nbut I didn't get that and and if you\nreally pay attention I think one good\nthing to watch in this interview is so\none thing that we in terms of\ncommunication training is micro\nexpressions\nso if y'all if y'all want to watch again\nish\nif you're watching no watching okay dude\nyou just let it be we're done you\ncouldn't do it better you don't need to\nlearn from it more or you go cuddle your\ncat\nbut if y'all watch his expressions and\nand I think sometimes I would kind of\nput him on the spot and I realized maybe\na little bit too late but\nI think some of what he was feeling and\nwhat's really confusing because what\nconfuses him and this is true of a lot\nof people who have been like traumatized\nand also are very like functional\nright so like you all work really hard\nand you know those negative emotions and\nyou use those negative emotions as like\nfuel forward but what really confuses\npeople and scares them I mean if you\nlisten to him\nI'm like are you feeling proud right now\nand he's like yeah it's terrifying\nlike that he used the word Terror\nand we like we get so bewildered and\nwhen we feel that Terror because we've\nbeen taught that we shouldn't be proud\nof ourselves\nand when you feel that Terror what it\ndoes is it engages all of these like\nadaptive mechanisms which are generally\nspeaking unhealthy or don't help you\nso what I'm guessing May really happen\nwith this guy is that he goes on dates\nand he does have some moments of genuine\nconnection but it just scares the [ __ ]\nout of him\nand once it scares him he like goes into\nsome weird like mode\nand then that shuts off the connection"
