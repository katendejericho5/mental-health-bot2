    "transcript": "lot of Asian Americans and families care\na lot about saving face if you're\nstruggling first of all you've got to\nfix it yourself and secondly you better\nnot ask anybody else for help because\nwhat if people find out oh my God you're\ndepressed like you better not see a\ntherapist what if someone finds out that\nyou see a therapist you know what if you\ntell someone no oh my God that would be\nso embarrassing because if you were\nseeing a therapist or if you were\ngetting help for problems that would\nreflect poorly on us as parents that\nmeans that we're not raising you right\nthis other kid down the street or that\nboy down the street he's not in therapy\nand he's getting A's and his parents\nsmack him more than I smack you like\nwhat is your problem we can't let\nanybody know and so since there's this\nemphasis on Saving Face it means that\nyou can't go to other people for help\nbecause that's incredibly embarrassing\nand makes us look bad look what the hell\nis wrong with you not only are you\nscrewing up now you're gonna make us\nlook bad that's a terrible idea"
