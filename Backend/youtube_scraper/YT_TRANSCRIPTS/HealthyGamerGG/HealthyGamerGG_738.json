    "transcript": "and as you go to a party there will be a\nlittle voice in your head that says hey\nyou're not worth being friends with hey\npeople don't like you this is a lesson\nthat you learned and that's what a lack\nof confidence looks like right it\nmanifests in the moment and tells you\nsomething about yourself it says hey\nthese other people can do this but you\ncan't because they are this way and you\nwere this way and so what you'll see is\nthese lessons that you learned early in\nlife will manifest in your mind and will\nprevent you from actually acting and\nthen you can struggle with that lack of\nconfidence sometimes you can overcome it\nsometimes you can't so the next thing\nthat we need to do is when that lack of\nconfidence surfaces we need to pause\ndon't fight it don't overcome it don't\nconquer it just sit with it and say hey\nokay hold on a second here's that lack\nof confidence here's that feeling and\nthis is what if you pay attention it'll\nbe an image an echo a mirror it'll be\nlike a little piece of that it's that\nemotional energy that is unprocessed and\nstored in your mind"
