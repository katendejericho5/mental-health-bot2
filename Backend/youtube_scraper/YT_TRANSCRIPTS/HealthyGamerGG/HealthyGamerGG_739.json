    "transcript": "so healthy gamer what's a healthy use of\ngames or Tech it's a great question so\nwhen we think about addiction what we\nthink of as addiction is something that\nimpairs your function it impacts your\nacademic life your professional life\nyour physical health your relationships\nyour mental health right so what I\nconsider healthy technology use is\ntechnology use that doesn't hurt you\nit's the ability to actually enjoy the\ntechnology that you use and what we sort\nof see is that the first half hour or\nhour that you play a video game it's\nactually fun but by hour two by hour\nthree by hour four the enjoyment goes\ndown and that's when we fall into an\naddiction we're using the thing but\nwe're not even having fun so what we try\nto encourage is for people to understand\nokay how much enjoyment are you having\nfrom the technology do you want to take\na couple of pictures absolutely but what\nyou want to remember is how much you\nenjoyed looking at that work of art how\nmuch you enjoyed being there how much\nyou enjoyed being with those people it's\nto evoke a memory not to replace it"
