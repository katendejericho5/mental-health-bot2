    "transcript": "today we're going to talk about\nsomething that is a highly contentious\nhighly challenging and really\ninteresting subject how to avoid the\nfriend zone\nthe friend zone is a really contentious\ntopic especially between men and women\nbecause for a lot of men they're really\nfrustrated by being friend zoned and a\nlot of the advice out there is about how\nto get out of the friend zone how can I\ntake this platonic relationship and\nconvert it into a romantic relationship\nunfortunately that doesn't work very\nwell especially because a lot of women\nhate being girlfriends owned so when\nthey what they sort of see is a platonic\nrelationship and they have no interest\nthey value that platonic relationship\nand they actually have no interest or\nwill actively resist any kind of\nromantic relationship and this leads to\na lot of frustration usually on both\nsides and what I tend to see a lot which\nis actually really really scary is that\nthis is a repetitive cycle especially\nfor some men where we'll kind of see\nthese these kind of situations where\nlike I was reading a post the other day\nfor example where someone was saying I\nfeel like every time I get really\nattached to a woman dot dot dot and the\ninteresting thing about these posts if\nyou talk about people who are frustrated\nwith the friend zone is they start with\nI am really attached to this woman I had\nthis person who was a friend and I\nstarted to get feelings for her and then\nhere's all the aftermath that happened\nand then the question kind of becomes\nokay how do I get out of the friend zone\nwhich doesn't tend to work very well so\nit's really frustrating because first of\nall people will find themselves in this\ncycle over and over and over again that\na lot of the advice about you know how\nto kind of get out of the friend zone\ndoes it seem to land very well and\nfurthermore it kind of runs against the\ninterests of the person that you\nactually have a friendship with\nand so this can be incredibly\nfrustrating and what I'd love to do\ntoday is to teach y'all a little bit\nabout first of all like the science of\nlove and to understand why we catch\nfeelings but most importantly to help\ny'all avoid getting into a situation\nwhere you actually have romantic\nfeelings for someone who's a friend and\nyou may say but hold on a second like is\nfirst of all is that possible and\nsecondly like but I really like this\nperson and I really want to create a\nrelationship with them and we're going\nto dig into all of those things hey\nthere thanks for watching and I'm glad\nthese videos have been helpful a lot of\ntimes I'll read the comments and see\npeople asking well what do I actually do\nabout it which is a great question and\nunfortunately the resources out there\nhaven't been that great which is\nprecisely why I started HD in the first\nplace HG coaches are trained on a\ncurriculum that integrates my\nunderstanding of what motivates us what\nparalyzes us and most importantly what\nleads to Lasting behavioral change if\nyou're ready to take the next step HG\ncoaches can help you build the life that\nyou want they've helped people build\ncareers help people find relationships\nbuild networks of friends and even do\nthings like discover their passions or\npursue Hobbies so if this sounds like\nsomething that you'd be interested in\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow\nso the first thing that I kind of want\nto point out is that for a lot of people\nunfortunately this really feels like a\ncycle okay so this is sort of what it\nlooks like I maybe I'm friends with a\nwoman and then I start to catch feelings\nfor her and then I start to like you\nknow spend a little bit more time with\nher I'm a little bit afraid of like\nconfessing my feelings so some people\nwill kind of advise me to like you know\njust shoot your shot and move on kind of\nthing but that can be really hard for\nsome people so you end up sort of in\nthis relationship where you're afraid of\nrejection so what you end up actually\ndoing is investing in the relationship\nwell maybe one day she'll start catching\nfeelings for me too maybe if I like kind\nof show her that I'm such a good dude\nand by the way she will frequently say\noh yeah I wish I could find a boyfriend\nthat was just like you and that's like\nso incredibly frustrating for someone\nwho's who's their friend right because\nyou're like well then why don't you date\nme if you're looking for something like\nme there's actually really good\nscientific reasons for that and a lot of\nfrustration that we experience come\ncomes out of a lack of that\nunderstanding\nso going back to the cycle so you're\nlike kind of investing in this\nrelationship a few months go by you\nfinally kind of like confess your\nfeelings right because things rise to a\ncritical level where then you like vomit\nYour Love out on the other person they\nexperience a sense of whiplash they\nreject you you then feel terrible which\nby the way when you get rejected by\nsomeone especially in a situation of\nunrequited love it causes all kinds of\nlike damage to your self-esteem and\ndisorganization of your thoughts and\nstuff it's actually quite traumatic and\nso then you spend some amount of time\nrecovering for that right so like now\nyou invested six months in the\nrelationship now you're kind of damaged\nnow three months go by for you to like\nput yourself back together and then you\nmeet someone else you sort of are\nfriends with them again and then like\nthe whole cycle repeats and the real\nproblem is that every time\nyou kind of like a friend zone\nrelationship falls apart you've invested\nlike nine months or a year or even more\nof your life that you can never get back\nand as the cycle repeats over and over\nand over again there's some people out\nthere who are like in the friend zone so\noften that four years will go by five\nyears will go by and they're like I\ndon't understand why I can't find a\nrelationship\nso what what I'd love to do is help you\nall understand a little bit about what's\ngoing on in the friend zone explain a\nlittle bit about the science of love and\nalso tell you all how to avoid that\nsituation and really open yourself up\nfor a relationship\nso let's start with a really really\ninteresting study so researchers did\nsomething really cool which is they took\na group of men and they split them into\ntwo groups and what they did is they\nsent one group on a stable low height\nBridge\nto have some kind of romantic\ninteraction with a woman they took the\nsecond group of men and they sent them\nto a very very high altitude rickety\nBridge Okay so the only difference in\nthis experiment is that one bridge is\nlike safe and stable the other bridge is\nlike kind of scary and the researchers\nactually found something really really\ninteresting which is that any kind of\nemotional activation on the part of\nespecially men leads to more romantic\nfeelings so this has nothing to do with\nattractiveness it has nothing to do with\nhow pretty they are or or like sexual\nMarketplace value or any of that crap\nwhich is mostly pseudoscience by the way\nwhat it what what they really found is\nthat the more emotionally active a man\nis the more likely they are to\nexperience romantic feelings now a lot\nof women can be this way too but this\nspecific study was focused on men so\nwhat does that mean and what does that\nexplain so the first thing is that when\nyou have a platonic relationship between\na man and a woman what a lot of women\nwill do is share a lot of emotions right\nso this is like an emotionally intimate\nrelationship where we can cry together\nwe can like talk about our deepest\ndarkest fears and for a lot of women\nthey will interpret this as friendship\nthis is what friends do friends are\nemotionally intimate with each other the\ncultural and conditioning experience of\nmost men is that emotional vulnerability\ndoesn't necessarily come with in any way\nshape or form\num any kind of like platonic interaction\nright so for a lot of men and this is\nwhat the research kind of supports is\nthat any sort of emotional interaction\nincreases the kind of romantic Bond\nbecause keep in mind in terms of the\nHigh Altitude rickety Bridge that's not\nlike it's not like a romantic situation\nright it just evokes fear and other\nkinds of emotions but the experience of\nany sort of negative emotion especially\nfor men or vulnerability can lead to\nsort of a romantic feeling so now we can\nsee one really important thing which is\nwhen two people are emotionally intimate\nthat some people are actually okay being\nemotionally intimate without it sort of\nleading to romantic feelings whereas\nother people the more emotionally\nintimate they are the more they\ncorrelate that with Romance the second\nthing that we're going to talk about is\nthat you can really only emotionally\ninvest in one person at a time from a\nromantic perspective so there's like\nresearch that sort of shows that\nbasically if you're like romantically\ninto one person then it's hard to become\nromantically involved with someone else\nnow I know that there are a lot of like\nTV shows out there and things like that\nthat show these love triangles as if\nthey are standard but if you really look\nat the research like usually what\nhappens is like you start falling out of\nlove with one person before you fall in\nlove with someone else right if you look\nat like research on Affairs and things\nlike that what you tend to find is that\nfalling out of Love Actually precedes\nfalling in love with someone one else\nand if you sort of think about it right\nso if you're in love with one person\nsomeone else could be in love with you\nand you'll be completely oblivious to it\nbecause you have no space for them so\nthe real challenge with sort of\ngirlfriend zoning or having romantic\nfeelings for a friend of yours is that\nwhile you are emotionally invested in\nthat person and reciprocity is like\ncompletely separate so we're not we're\nnot even talking about that yet you\ndon't have the space in your life to\nfall in love with someone else and this\nis what leads to that kind of cycle and\nwhat leads to so much wasted time\nbecause once you start catching feelings\nfor for someone\nthen you it's going to be really hard to\ncatch feelings for someone else and the\nmore that you stay kind of connected to\nthat relationship the worse off things\nare going to get\nso once you catch feelings what\ndetermines whether those feelings will\nkind of grow or what determines like\nwhether those feelings will shrink\nso this is where the first thing that we\nkind of talked about was that emotional\nactivation which can be any kind of\nemotion by the way so what tends to\nhappen is once you start catching\nfeelings for someone\neven if you like listen to her complain\nabout her ex-boyfriend if that's like\nemotionally empathically engaging for\nyou you will fall more in love with them\nthe second thing that's important to\nnote is that the more exposure you have\nwith someone that you have romantic\nfeelings for the more likely those\nfeelings will grow so now we see like\nanother really interesting implication\nwith the friend zone relationship which\nis that if I have romantic feelings\ntowards you and you don't have romantic\nfeelings towards me the more time we\nspend together the more my romantic love\nwill grow and the more neutral yours\nwill remain right so this is really\nimportant because we don't really\nunderstand like we this is not something\nthat we get but this is scientifically\nsort of true which is that once you\nstart on the path of love more time\ntogether increases that love but it's\nnot like spending one year together if\none person is in love and the other\nperson isn't in love spending one year\ntogether is not going to like increase\nthe amount of Love on on both sides and\nthis is something that's really easy to\nunderstand if we think about a mutual or\nreciprocal love right when you fall in\nlove with someone and they fall in love\nwith you it's kind of like intense and\nyou guys want to spend more time\ntogether y'all are hanging out all the\ntime and the more time you spend\ntogether the more in love with each\nother you fall now take that scenario\nand just move it to a situation of\nunrequited love that's where when one\nperson is loved the exposure still\nincreases that love but for the person\nwho like feels like this is a platonic\nrelationship it's never going to\nqualitatively convert a platonic love to\na romantic love\nand the third aspect that we're going to\ntalk a little bit about is actually\nattachment style so this is one reason\nwhy I think so much of the advice around\nthe friend zone doesn't land if you look\nat it a lot of people will say oh if you\nkeep on getting friend zoned just do\nthis or just do this or if you do this\nlike this is what you got to start stop\ndoing and this is what you got to start\ndoing everyone will give generic advice\nwhat people I've never heard a single\nperson give advice about the friend zone\nwith any kind of consideration that the\nadvice needs to be tailored to the way\nthat you form relationships so the\nscience of attachment Theory\nis like the science of like how human\nbeings form relationships and one\nCentral tentative attachment theory is\nthat not all human beings form\nrelationships in the same way and so if\nwe look at the science of attachment\nTheory what we discover is that\ndepending on your attachment style\nyou're prone to fall in love in certain\nkinds of ways so one example is if you\nhave an anxious ambivalent attachment\nstyle which is sort of what we kind of\nthink of as someone who's like afraid of\nrejection maybe low self-esteem you're\nkind of like hyper Vigilant to what\nother people think about you you're\nreally worried about relationships you\nstress a lot around relationships and if\nyou do this what we actually discover is\nthat the more ideal this person seems to\nyou the harder it is to let them go and\nyou may kind of scratch your head for a\nsecond and say well hold on a second\ndoesn't if this person seems more ideal\nto me wouldn't I like wouldn't that make\nit harder for anyone to let go and this\nis what's kind of bizarre but the answer\nis actually actually no different people\ncan let go of Ideal things because they\nfeel more secure in themselves and the\nmore secure in themselves they feel the\nmore able they are to like let something\ngood go the other really interesting\naspect of anxious ambivalent attachment\nis that\npart of the reason these people feel so\nideal to you is because you don't have\nother people in your life right so what\nanxious and ambivalent attachment people\nwill do is they will form\ntight relationships with very few number\nof people and I'll put it to you kind of\nSimply like let's think about it this\nway let's say I I'm hanging out with 10\ndifferent women\nhow perfect will any one of those women\nseem let's say I'm hanging out with one\nwoman how perfect will that woman seem\nand this can be reversed for men and\nwomen too where even if I'm a woman and\nI'm hanging out with 10 different dudes\nand I have 10 different relationships\nplatonic romantic flirting whatever\nbut if I only if there's like really\nonly one dude in my life it's way easier\nto get romantically attached to that\nperson and idealize that person so this\nis what's really tricky is even this\nprocess of friend zone we begin to see\nthat some of the way that even you were\nraised can influence why you get into\nthe friend zone all this stuff once we\nstart to put it together can paint us a\nclearer picture the first is that you\nmay not have too many women in your life\nand then what happens or men then what\nhappens is you start hanging out with\none person the more that you hang out\nwith one person the more other people\nleave your life and the more this\nperson's esteem rises in your eyes\nas you start to catch romantic feelings\nnow suddenly each of your interactions\nmeans different things to both of you\nthe more that you become emotionally\nvulnerable with this person the more\nromantically attached you become whereas\nfor them it's just a friendship so even\none shared experience is affecting the\ntwo people in very different ways\nthe other problem that we tend to run\ninto is as we get romantically involved\nwith people we increase our exposure to\nthem and we know that increased exposure\nwhen you're in love leads to Stronger\nfeelings of love and as we put all of\nthese things together what you end up\ndoing is investing in a platonic\nrelationship with a romantic idea in\nmind the more you invest in that\nrelationship and the less like recip\nreciprocity there is the more resentful\nyou become and the more you actually\nlike cut out other things out of your\nlife and then you wind up in the friend\nzone you end up losing six months nine\nmonths or a year\nso now the question becomes okay fine\nlet's assume that this is true there's a\nlot of like nuance and science behind\nthis that maybe people don't understand\nI know that like in the dating world and\nstuff like that everyone is talking\nabout alphas and betas and stuff like\nthat that stuff has basically been\nscientifically debunked it's not\nscientifically valid okay so now the\nquestion becomes okay so what should you\ndo about it and this is where I want to\ncome back to where most people's story\nstarts which is\nI've caught feelings for this person now\nwhat do I do and that's the kind of\nthing where oftentimes when we see\npeople like talk about it when they\nreach help it's not when they first\ncatch feelings it's when the feelings\nhave grown so much that it kind of\nbecomes overwhelming this is sort of a\nsituation of like imagine like weeds in\nyour garden if you leave those weeds\nuntended in your garden and they grow\nand they sprout what are they going to\ndo they're going to start to choke out\nall the plant life that you want they'll\nbe so big and their Roots will be so\ndeep that they it takes so much effort\njust to like tear them out so oddly\nenough what we actually want to help you\nall do is avoid catching feelings in the\nfirst place or the second that you find\nthat you catch feelings that you alter\nyour behavior to prevent the situation\nfrom happening\nso this is where the first thing that we\nneed to do is be emotionally aware right\nso this is why a lot of the stuff that\nwe do at HG like our community event\nright in the fields or what we try to do\nin like group coaching or personal\ncoaching is we help raise people's EQ or\nemotional quotient we help people like\nunderstand their feelings more and be\naware of their feelings more and most\nimportantly we help them once they're\naware of their feelings not let their\nfeelings control their actions\nso what you need to do is the moment you\nstart to have romantic feelings for\nsomeone in your life the natural ideas\nto hide these right because oh this\nperson is just my friend and if I tell\nthem like they're going to reject me and\nwe're just friends and people and girls\ndon't like to be girlfriends on so I\ncan't say anything\nand this is where actually you can say\nsomething and what you can say can be\nreally really impactful helpful and\nactually maintain the Friendship so the\nmoment you notice that you're catching\nfeelings for someone what you should\ntalk to them about it and this is what\nyou can say hey so I know we've been\nfriends for a little while but I'm\nstarting to notice like some kind of\nromantic feelings\nwhat do you think about that right so\nhave a conversation with your friend I\nknow it sounds terrifying but approach\nthem kind of as a friend like hey like\nwe have a relationship right like hey I\nhave this pile of feelings and like what\ndo you think we should do about these\nfeelings should I suppress them should I\nlet them go could you possibly feel the\nsame way have you ever felt that way\nabout me and just have a Frank\nconversation about it you can actually\ngive them the space to say oh like this\nis what could happen right maybe they'll\nsay yeah sometimes I've had those\nfeelings too I've actually seen that\nhappen and then people will talk about\nokay how can we try to try this\nrelationship or not can it work can it\nnot work you can have a really mature\nconversation and I know it sounds kind\nof bizarre\nbut the earlier on you do it the more\nlikely you are to actually successfully\ntransition the relationship because once\npeople have a solidified idea of what\nthe relationship is and that can be\nDivergent right so once you've let your\nlove for this person grow out of control\nthen it's really hard to just be friends\nand similarly for the other person once\nthey've let that friendship really\nsolidify it becomes even harder for them\nto become romantic so what I tend to see\nin relationships that transition from\nFriendship to romantic love is that it\nusually happens within the first three\nmonths or most people will happen in the\nfirst six months transitioning to\nromantic love later tends to like the\nchances tend to go down with time so the\nearlier you have this conversation\nactually the more likely it is to like\nsucceed in terms of switching it over to\nromance\nthe second thing that this allows you to\ndo is let's say that they reject you and\nthey say they're not really rejecting\nyou per se and that's a whole other\nconversation they're saying hey I'm not\ninterested in this relationship so this\nis a really really key fork in the road\nbecause at this point what you\nabsolutely need to do is say okay fine\nthank you for letting me know I think I\nneed to take a step back from some of\nour interactions while I sort through\nthese feelings\nand so this is where someone may say oh\nmy God does this mean you're abandoning\nme as my friend am I losing my friend no\nyou're not they're not losing you as a\nfriend honest to God they're not you\njust need some time away from them to\nsort through your feelings and then you\ncan let them know like hey this\nfriendship matters to me a lot I need to\nlike sort of take care of some of these\nromantic feelings kind of on my own and\nonce I've done that I'm happy to\nre-engage okay I need some time as your\nfriend now this is a really really\nimportant step why because of everything\nthat we've talked about in terms of the\nscience so once you step out of the\nrelationship at month two you kind of\nlike take a step back\nthose romantic feelings will actually\nWilt over time because remember that\nincreased exposure intensifies romantic\nfeelings the second thing that's going\nto happen is as you take a step back\nfrom them that emotional vulnerability\nand that emotional activation will also\ndecrease and that emotional activation\nis what leads to these feelings of\nromantic love\nthe third thing that'll happen and this\nis really really really important\nis that you will create the space in\nyour own heart mind biology\ngonads wherever we don't know where it\nworks but we sort of know this\nscientifically you will create the space\nto form romantic attachments with other\npeople and this is what's really\nimportant once you create that space and\nyou don't intensify the love with your\nfriend\nyou can actually like fall in love with\nsomeone else and once you fall in love\nwith that person\nhopefully you can sort of like try this\nwhole thing again then you can actually\ngo back to your friend and you can\nresume the Friendship without catching\nfeelings for them so I know it sounds\nkind of bizarre but this is like\nactually works there's actually a lot of\nscience behind this stuff and the\nproblem that a lot of people have with\nthe friend zone is they don't understand\nit's not just about falling in love\ninitially it's about the way that as you\nengage with this person what happens to\nyour sensation of love it intensifies it\nbuilds up builds up builds up and then\nwe confess no one who's in the friend\nzone has a casual conversation about\nbeing in love right it's always a\nconfession because those feelings have\ngrown so much that they become\noverwhelming I can't resist them anymore\nand now I must confess my love and then\nthis other person is like blindsided by\nit and then they reject you and then you\nfeel really hurt and you've invested six\nmonths and then you're damaged and your\nthoughts are disorganized and your sense\nof self is Disturbed your self-esteem is\nin the pits and then you spend six\nmonths recovering from that and by the\nway there's someone else on around month\nfour month five that starts to listen to\nyour problems\nright they're like oh my God yeah we're\nsuch good friends and you confess to\nthem how much this girl hurt you and\nthen they listen to you and you all cry\ntogether and what does that do what did\nwe learn from the High Altitude rickety\nbridge now you start to form romantic\nattachments with this person\nbut this person is your friend\nand then you're like okay no no no no\nI'm not gonna tell them they're just my\nfriend you spend more time with them you\nincrease exposure you'll get closer and\ncloser emotionally\nbut you can't say anything and then the\ncycle repeats itself\nso it sounds super bizarre\nbut I think the solution to the friend\nzone is not to get out of the friend\nzone it's to never get into it and this\nis where you may say but Dr K you can't\ncontrol who you fall in love with\nthis is what's bizarre actually you can\nand I want you all to think about that\nfor a second\nwe know so much about Neuroscience we\nknow so much about psychology we know\nabout where trauma comes from we know\nwhere narcissism comes from we know\nwhere low self-esteem comes from hell we\neven know the mechanism to which\npsychedelics create ego death in a\nconnection to all other human beings we\nknow things about behavioral economics\nwe know things about how to predict like\nwhat the market is going to do we know\nhow to get people to buy Oreos we know\nso many things about neuroscience and\npsychology there's just one area where\nneuroscience and psychology falls apart\nwhich is love it's too mysterious right\nwe can't understand it we can understand\neverything else about human beings but\nwe can't understand love that's absolute\nBS we actually understand love really\nwell and you can actually shape who you\nfall in love with now that initial\nattraction you may not be able to shape\nbut if you really want to avoid this\nwhole friend zone cycle you have to\nstart by first of all being emotionally\naware of yourself and the moment you\nhave romantic feelings you should\nrecognize those second thing you've got\nto do is have a conversation right then\nand there\nand that can be incredibly challenging\nbecause oh my God I'm afraid of\nrejection it's not a rejection right\nyou're not asking them out and this is a\nkey part of it you are trying to solve a\nproblem with your friend you're saying\nhey I have this pile of feelings it's\njust feelings feelings will come and\nfeelings will go if you've been in the\ncycle of the friend zone three or four\ntimes what happened to the first person\nthat friendzoned you are you still\npining over them no those feelings go\naway then you fall in love with someone\nelse and then you repeat the cycle\nso feelings can come and go and that's\nokay the key thing to understand to\navoid this whole situation is awareness\nof the feelings\nhave a conversation about it early and\nfor you to understand what are the\nscientific factors that can make this\nstuff get out of control and once you\nstart controlling for those factors you\nwon't invest into the wrong relationship\nand in fact you will open yourself up to\nadditional relationships that can get\noff on the right foot"
