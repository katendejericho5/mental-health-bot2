    "transcript": "but at healthy gamer one of the things\nthat we've come to realize is that\ntechnology is here and it's here to stay\nthat's sort of treating it like the\nenemy is actually not the right move\ninstead I think the real problem with\ntechnology right now is that it's been\ndeveloped and used by people who are not\ntrying to accomplish Noble Pursuits\nthey're developing technology to try to\nsell video games and entertain people if\nwe look at things like social media I\ndon't think that social media platforms\nare evil but I don't think that the\npeople who develop social media\nplatforms their primary goal is to make\nthe world a better place their primary\ngoal is to try to disseminate content\ngenerate ad revenue and they're sort of\nthat's their their primary goal"
