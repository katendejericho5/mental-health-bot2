    "transcript": "today we're going to talk a little bit\nabout Detachment apathy and motivation\nand a lot of people like myself will\ntalk about the value of Detachment right\nwe'll say that based on all these\nspiritual Traditions that you should\ndetach from the world and as you detach\nfrom stuff you'll be happier you'll be\nmore content you'll be more free and\nsometimes even more productive hey there\nthanks for watching and I'm glad these\nvideos have been helpful a lot of times\nI'll read the comments and see people\nasking well what do I actually do about\nit which is such a great question and\nunfortunately my experience has been\nthat the resources out there aren't\nactually that good at helping people\ncreate sustainable change which is why I\nstarted HG in the first place he coaches\nare trained on a curriculum that\nintegrates all of my understanding into\nwhat is motivation what paralyzes Us and\nhow to create lasting behavioral change\nso if you're ready to take the next step\nhe coaches are ready to build the life\nthat you want they helped people build\ncareers find relationships build\nnetworks of friends discover what their\npassions are and pursue their Hobbies so\nif this sounds like something that you'd\nbe interested in check out the link in\nthe description below but a lot of times\nthat seems really confusing for people\nright because if you really think about\nit it's your attachment to things that\nactually gets you motivated and moving\nforward and a lot of people get confused\nby this concept of Detachment versus\napathy because if I detach from stuff\ndoesn't that mean that I stop caring and\ncaring is the only thing that actually\nkeeps me going\nand a lot of people who will listen to\nto people talk about Detachment will\nkind of conclude that okay I can't\nafford to be detached because if I\nbecome a detached then like I'm gonna\nsit around and do nothing in fact this\nsort of apathetic nihilistic mentally\nchecked out stuff is actually what I\nstruggle with every day what I struggle\nwith is to find motivation and so today\nwhat we're going to do is explain a\nlittle bit about the difference between\nDetachment and apathy and in some ways\nhow they're almost completely Polar\nOpposites and we'll talk a little bit\nabout the value and explain why\nDetachment can be so good and most\nimportantly we're going to sort of\nexplain to you all the mechanism behind\nwhich Detachment actually helps people\nmove forward\nso in order to understand this we have\nto start with an understanding of how we\nnormally motivate ourselves\nso normally I have some kind of internal\ndrive and I have some sort of external\nresistance so a good example of this is\nthat let's say I'm ambitious and I want\nto accomplish a lot but I hate my job so\nthis is the sort of situation where I\ndon't want to work I don't really enjoy\nwork it's kind of like this barrier that\nI have to overcome and what allows me to\novercome the barrier of the boringness\nof work the toxicity of work the\ndiminishing returns that I get from\nputting in effort what I have to do to\novercome the negative situation at work\nis some amount of ambition and so some\nof you all may sort of really wish that\nyou were more ambitious right because we\nsee people who are doing the sigma grind\nset and they're like super super\nambitious and they will tolerate a ton\nof pain and they're like yeah like you\nknow I'm going to be hardcore and like\nyeah like life sucks because you've got\nto like be super ambitious and so what\nwe sort of do is we have this internal\ndriver that we use to over come the hump\nof resistance and then what happens is\nthere's this little like equation that\ngoes on in our head right work sucks so\nmuch so that sort of creates a certain\namount of resistance and if I'm\nambitious enough I can overcome the hump\nof disliking work and that actually\nleads me to action which then leads me\nto benefits like success and money and\npromotions and things like that\nso this is sort of normally how we\nmotivate ourselves there's sort of this\ninternal struggle between the world\nsucking out there and me ramping myself\nup internally really juicing myself to\novercome those negatives another really\ngood example of this if we want to step\nout outside of work for a second is\nloneliness and anxiety\nthis is something that we deal with a\nton in this community I've helped a ton\nof patients with this kind of stuff\nwhere it's like okay so I'm socially\nanxious and it's hard for me to make\nfriends when I go out and I meet people\nlike oh my God it's like so painful like\nI look stupid I sound stupid everyone's\njudging me all the time social media\ndefinitely doesn't help that kind of\nstuff so what happens is we kind of move\nout into the world we get bludgeoned by\nour social anxiety and then we retreat\nand when we Retreat what starts to build\nup a sense of loneliness and so there's\nsome research that shows that this is\nthe Loneliest generation in the history\nof humanity and so the loneliness builds\nand builds and builds and builds and\nbuilds until it overcomes the resistance\nfrom the social anxiety right so here's\nthis barrier of social anxiety we try to\nyou know move out into the world and we\nget swatted back and then the loneliness\nRises Rises Rises Rises and once the\nloneliness surpasses the anxiety Then\nwe're so desperate that we can't afford\nto be anxious anymore and then we start\nmoving forward\nand so if we think a little bit about\nwhat drives us forward in life it's this\nthing over here right it's that level of\nanxiety it's that feeling of loneliness\nit's the desperation of always being\nalone\nand this is what we sort of think about\nas caring because sometimes that stuff\nlike if that gets too toxic or too\nharmful what we end up doing is becoming\napathetic right so like if I don't have\nthat driver so I have social anxiety\nover here and the loneliness is building\nup over here but if I become apathetic\nif I mentally check out at work if I\nsort of numb myself from the loneliness\nthat's really what apathy is I stop\ncaring about life and then I'm kind of\nstuck\nand so that's usually how we work right\nbecause if we're apathetic we're not\ndoing anything and the only thing that\nwe can use to overcome that hump is\nactually caring a lot the more I care\nabout my job the more that I care about\nnot being alone anymore the more I'm\nactually going to motivate myself\nforward\nbut this is not really like a healthy or\nsustainable way to live life right in\nthe case of ambition it results in\nBurnout and in the case of like you know\nloneliness like it's it's so terrible I\nmean hopefully you all don't know but\nunfortunately chances are many of you do\nthat the struggle between loneliness\nsaying anxiety sucks like no matter how\nyou cut it even if the loneliness Rises\nto the point where you move out into the\nworld it's still a painful experience\nand so what a lot of people will think\nis that okay like I can't afford to give\nup my attachments I can't afford to give\nup the loneliness I can't afford to give\nup the the ambition because then how am\nI going to do anything\nand this is where Detachment enters the\npicture\nbecause Detachment is not about\ndetaching from the world it's actually\nabout detaching from yourself\nso when we really think about what\nDetachment is so like here's the world\ndown here and here's us up here\nand we kind of sit in the middle and I\nknow that sounds kind of weird what do I\nmean by that so we kind of sit over here\nand what we think Detachment means that\nwe think it means removing ourselves\nfrom the world right like I'm gonna stop\ncaring about stuff but if you really\nlook at it what Detachment truly means\nis removal from our own ego so when we\nremove ourselves from our ego that's\nwhen we actually become detached now\nwhat does that mean\nso I'll give you all kind of a simple\nexample let's say I want to dance at a\nparty so I'm hearing the music the music\nis fantastic I really really feel like\ndancing\nwhat is it that keeps me from dancing\nbecause I can hear the music I want to\nmove maybe I don't know how to dance but\nwho the hell cares right generally\nspeaking people who like dancing to\nmusic don't care if they know how to\ndance or don't know how to dance you can\nstill dance to the music and enjoy it\nbut what is it that keeps you from\nenjoying that moment in the world it's\nnot the world itself it's your own ego\nit's this idea that oh my God if I start\ndancing I will look stupid because I\ndon't know how to dance people will\nthink I'm an idiot people it's going to\nbe so embarrassing what will people\nthink so in that moment there you are\nexisting in the world and you have\nsomething in the world that you want to\ndo that you really want to do that you\ncrave doing that you are jealous when\nyou see other people who are able to do\nit and you're unable to do it and what\nis it that keeps you from doing it it's\nnot actually the world it's not because\nthe music sucks the music is fantastic\nwhat keeps you from doing it is actually\nyour attachment to your own ego so this\nis the thing that's really really\nimportant to understand when we're\ntalking about detaching we're not moving\naway from the world towards ourselves\nwe're actually moving away from\nourselves and actually towards the world\nand this is why people who are eight are\ndetached are able to dance like there\nain't no tomorrow they're able to\nactually live life to the fullest if\nthey go to karaoke they can just sing\nkaraoke and not worry about what other\npeople think imagine what would happen\nif you went to a party and you didn't\ncare what other people thought because\nif you really tunnel down into it what\nis it that when we say care what other\npeople think what aspect of other\npeople's thoughts do you actually care\nabout you care about their opinion of\nyou their opinion of you is attached to\nyour ego in the way that you're viewed\nright when a narcissistic person has a\nbig ego what does that mean that means\nthat everyone needs to think positively\nabout the narcissistic person\nso this is the key thing to understand\nthat Detachment and apathy and we'll get\ninto this a little bit more in a second\nor actually complete opposites and what\nwe're not removing ourselves from the\nworld what we're actually doing is\nmoving more into the world and removing\nourselves from ourselves\nso what does that mean in terms of that\nmotivation kind of diagram that we were\nthinking about right because here's my\nambition here's my feeling of loneliness\nand then there's the resistance that I\nencounter so that resistance is things\nlike oh my God what will people think or\nI dislike my job and so if we look at\nthat resistance that keeps us from\nmoving forward in life that resistance\nis usually composed of emotions and ego\nand so what a Detachment actually does\nis it lowers that resistance and the\nbeautiful thing is that once we lower\nthe resistance once there is no hump to\novercome then we can be driven forward\nby all kinds of things we no longer need\nambition to act we no longer need that\nloneliness to move out and engage with\npeople and that may sound a little bit\nweird but let's like tunnel down into\nthat so what Detachment actually does is\nlowers that resistance and how does it\ndo that because let's go back to the\nsocial example I'm really lonely and I\nhave social anxiety so let's tunnel down\ninto okay what is social anxiety social\nanxiety is the concern of what other\npeople think about you right that's what\nsocial anxiety is I'm worried what other\npeople are going to think now if I\nstopped worrying what other people\nthought that would be freeing that would\nbe amazing in the most important thing\nis that if I stopped caring what other\npeople thought I don't need loneliness\nto drive me to engage with other people\nI can engage with other people through\nall kinds of other things like hey that\nperson likes something that I like that\ncan drive me to form a connection with\nthem\nwhat about the work scenario right\nbecause in work but I genuinely hate the\nwork so this is where you got to stop\nfor a second and you really got to think\nwhy do you hate the work so if you\nreally talk to people and we do this a\nlot for example through career coaching\nwe worked with hundreds of people now\nand we understand why people hate their\njobs a lot of times the reason that\npeople hate their jobs is because\nthey're not recognized in their jobs the\neffort that they put in is not\nappreciated that they have trouble\nadvocating for themselves and people are\nplaying politics\nsometimes it's because the job is really\nreally really boring and even in those\ncases why don't those people quit those\njobs well because they're afraid of the\nconsequences of quitting a job what if I\ndon't find another job what if people\nwon't hire me somewhere else so even if\nyou look at each of those scenarios\nabout why we hate the job what we\nactually discover is that it's not the\njob itself that actually keeps you stuck\nit's all of your attachments related to\nthe job it's wanting to be appreciated\nby your boss wanting to be recognized\nwanting to be respected by your peers\nwhich by the way is what leads you to\nwork extra hard to get that recognition\nso any way you cut it what you really\ndiscover is that attachment and ego are\nreally the things that kind of hold us\nback in life and since we're so attached\nto the opinions of others we have to\nstart to use these dirty fuels these\ntoxic motivators like ambition and\nloneliness to actually move us forward\nand then we get kind of stuck because we\nbelieve that Detachment means getting\nrid of our ambition or getting rid of\nour loneliness whereas that's not\nactually what we're saying at all we're\nnot saying that you're getting rid of\neither of those what we're saying is\nthat Detachment lowers the resistance\nand so hopefully this is kind of making\nsense and I want you all to just think a\nlittle bit about what would life be like\nif there was no resistance to what you\nwanted to do if you had a particular\ndesire and your ego didn't say hey\nthat's going to make you look stupid or\nyou weren't operating out of like fear\nof consequences or things like that what\nwould your life actually be like and\nthis is where a lot of people think well\ndon't I need ambition or loneliness to\nmotivate me no because once the the\nresistance drops down to zero then all\nkinds of stuff can motivate you interest\nin particular things curiosity all kinds\nof stuff actually naturally starts\nmotivating you why aren't you motivated\nEnough by those things right now because\ncuriosity is not enough to overcome the\nego\nright you can be curious about learning\nhow to dance and hey like you go to a\nparty and you're like hey like let me\nlike learn how to dance right let me be\ncurious about this that's beautiful but\nthe problem is that that curiosity is\nnot enough to overcome the ego which is\nwhy you don't live a life that is driven\nby curiosity you live a life that's\ndriven by loneliness or ambition\nand so this is the beauty of Detachment\nbecause it lowers that resistance it\nseparates us from the ego and it\nactually starts allowing us to live a\nlife that's based on things like\ncuriosity and interest as opposed to\nlike desperation loneliness or ambition\nand so hopefully now you're kind of\nthinking okay so like this sounds pretty\ncool like lowering that resistance seems\npretty neat so then the question\nnaturally becomes how do we cultivate\ndetachment\nand so now what we're going to talk\nabout is sanskrit phrase called vairagya\nso virage is the Sanskrit word for\ndetachment and there are certain ways\nthat we cultivate Detachment and the\nmost important way that we cultivate\nDetachment is actually through awareness\nso this may sound kind of confusing\nbecause in the west especially we have\nthis idea that the way to get better in\nlife is to do more stuff right like\npeople who succeed are doing more stuff\nthan people who don't if you want to get\nahead you have to network more you got\nto play politics you got to update your\nprofile on LinkedIn the more you do the\nmore you get right and this is something\nthat a lot of like success influencers\nand sigma grind set folks are like work\nharder like have your hustle and have\nyour side hustle and have your side side\nhustle in your mini side hustle and like\nright you got to do more to get more\neven at work right people will say like\nit's the go-getters who get promoted and\nso this is the really bizarre thing but\nthat's actually not how it works and if\nyou talk to people who are lonely or are\nambitious what you'll find is that they\nexert a lot of effort right so even if\nyou're someone or you maybe have a\nfriend who's like stuck at home and\nstruggles with anxiety if you actually\nask that person how much effort are you\nexerting\nthey may be like self-judgmental and\nthey'll say oh I don't do anything but\nif you actually look at the struggle of\ntheir day-to-day life it's actually\nreally hard right because even going out\nis like climbing a mountain these little\nthings that are easy for other people\nrequire so much effort from the person\nwho is more attached who is more engaged\nwith their ego\nso this is where it's kind of bizarre\nbut the source of iraqia the most\nimportant source of Iraq is actually\nawareness and what do we mean by that or\nhow does that work so this is really\nsimple where awareness precedes control\nso if you've ever had dental work done\nthis is like the classic example that I\nuse and you're numbed you can't control\nanything if you can't feel it you can't\ncontrol it right you can also look at\nthings like let's say people who are\nalcoholic and in denial they are unaware\nthat there is a problem and without\nawareness that there's a problem they\ncan't really fix it but if you talk to\nsomeone who's an alcoholic and is like\ngoing through divorce proceedings and\ngetting like written up at work the\namount of effort they're putting forward\nis actually astronomically High every\nsingle day that they live is a struggle\nin a fight and your spouse is arguing\nwith you your kids are mad at you bosses\nare writing you up there is so much\neffort but there is no awareness and we\nalso know that based on evidence-based\ntreatment of alcoholism what is the\nsolution the solution is actually\nInsight or awareness right and you we\nkind of hear it in places like\nAlcoholics Anonymous where they start\nevery meeting with awareness building hi\nmy name is all Oak and I am an alcoholic\nand that is so foundational because once\nyou understand that they're once you\nunderstand what's going on once you have\nawareness of not just the problem but\nthe whole system then things actually\nbecome effortless\nand there's one really good example of\nthis which is like I don't know if y'all\nplay video games but like if you're good\nat a video game people will look at you\nand will say wow that is so amazing\nyou must work really hard to be good at\nthe the video game it looks so effortful\nbut when you're good at a video game you\nactually don't expend a whole lot of\neffort it's actually easy for you right\nbut the question is why is it easy for\nyou because you understand you\nunderstand the mechanics of the game you\nunderstand the meta of the game the more\nthat you understand the more easy things\nbecome\nand this is the key thing about\ncultivating Detachment this is what the\nYogi's figured out is that if you want\nto live an easy life that is also\nhappens to be like more productive then\nyou need to actually start with\nawareness because as as long as we are\nnumb to stuff and as long as we don't\nunderstand how things work it's we can\nexert all the effort in the world and\nit's going to yield very few returns\nand so then the question becomes okay\nhow do we cultivate this awareness and\nthis is where there are a couple of\nsimple answers the first is meditation\nand now some of y'all may be listening\nto this and thinking okay so so are you\nsaying just meditate and like sort of\nright but I don't want you all to just\nmeditate what I want you all to\nunderstand is even if you're thinking\nokay meditation doesn't work for me I've\ntried it a bunch it doesn't help with\nthese problems you're missing the point\nwhat I want you to understand is why\nmeditation works why we use meditation\nas the key way to develop Detachment\nbecause Yogi's tested all kinds of stuff\nand what they settled on is meditation\nand why is that it's because meditation\nis the practice literally the practice\nwhere we skill up our ability to be\naware so the first thing is you should\nmeditate and what does that meditation\nmean it means just be aware of stuff\nthe second thing that I strongly\nrecommend that you do is spend time with\nyourself\nso if we're talking about awareness a\nkey thing that we really want to be\naware of is our reactions to stuff\nbecause it is in our reactions to stuff\nthat we actually find our attachments so\nif we go back to dancing at a party what\nam I attached to it's going to manifest\nin the way that I react when I'm at the\nparty so if I want to dance and the\nmusic is fantastic and I really want to\ndance and then notice the reaction that\nyou have within yourself and that\nreaction will actually give you insight\ninto the nature of the attachment we\nspend so much time trying to overcome\nthat reaction right we wrestle with\nourselves we try to overcome and Conquer\nanxiety that we don't ever spend any\ntime just sitting there and observing it\nand so that's the the problem is that\neffort over that anxiety is not going to\nultimately lead to success what's\nultimately going to lead to success is\nawareness and so notice your own\nreactions to things and in in that sense\nspend a little bit more time just with\nyourself and the last thing that I want\nto share with y'all is a little bit of\nhow you could be reacting to this video\nso I want you all to notice that when I\nsay hey like spend some time like\nnoticing things notice your reaction to\nthings maybe try meditating what is your\nreaction to this video right there's a\ndecent chance that there's a fair number\nof y'all that are saying oh my God he's\nsaying just meditate I've tried that\nbefore it won't work\nso that's kind of interesting right so\nif you've been following me this far or\nthus far hopefully you kind of like kind\nof buy what I'm selling in the sense\nthat we have these driving motivators we\nhave these resistances and we rely on\njacking up our motivation to overcome\nthe resistance and wouldn't it be\nawesome if we no longer had that\nresistance you're like yeah yeah yeah\nyeah yeah yeah but once I start telling\nyou okay all you need to do is be aware\nthen what is your reaction to that it's\nlike no no no no that's not going to be\nenough because I've tried so hard and it\nhasn't worked exactly\nso stop trying so hard notice your own\nintrinsic reaction because chances are\nthat if you really tunnel down into that\nand this is how you want to know how to\nbuild awareness we're going to do it\nright now tunnel down into that why are\nyou so skeptical that this is going to\nwork if you tunnel down into your\nskepticism there's going to be emotion\nthere right there's going to be fear\nwhat if it doesn't work or it's going to\nbe frustration and regret I've tried\nthis before and it didn't work\nI don't want to waste my time there's\ngoing to be all kinds of emotions\nnegative emotions tied to your\nresistance\nto doing what I'm asking you to do right\nbecause that's what it is it's the\nresistance and what is the resistance\nit's emotion and anytime there's\nnegative motion there's ego and so now\nwe see in this moment\nthat if you try to push forward you'll\nfeel that resistance and it'll actually\nit's actually telling you don't do it\ndon't do it don't do it and how do we\nactually overcome that notice that\nreaction we can do it right now notice\nthat reaction why is it that I'm so\nresistant to trying this why is it that\nI'm so resistant to meditating because\nI've tried it and it didn't work I've\nbeen burned I've wasted my time I can't\nafford to waste time anymore and if you\nhave those kinds of thoughts what is\nthat those are attachments right you\ncan't afford it oh my God the only times\nwe can't afford things are when we're\nattached to things I can't afford to set\nboundaries with my boss I can't afford\nto rock the boat in my relationship\nwhen you can't afford to do something\nthat's an attachment\nso I know it sounds kind of bizarre but\nthe truth of the matter is that\nDetachment and apathy are actually\ncomplete opposites and it's the fact\nthat we get confused about that that we\nassume that those are the same thing\nthat we actually try not to cultivate\nDetachment because we've started to\nbuild a system of motivation that relies\non attachment to overcome our resistance\nthat's the only way we can move forward\nbut if you really want to be free of all\nof that crap and be free from the only\nmotivator being this toxic motivator or\ndirty fuel like ambition or loneliness\nor desperation then you have to\ncultivate Detachment and the beauty is\nthat cultivating Detachment from your\nown ego allows you to actually live more\nfully within the world"
