    "transcript": "I think the challenge though is that if\nwe really look at it the best antidote\nto video game addiction is actually\nself-understanding so the challenge\nright now is that platforms are not\nregulating themselves right their goal\nis to try to increase the amount of time\nthat users use the platform and\nfurthermore even if we look at policy\nand things like that if we look at\nscientific studies it takes five years\nto basically do a scientific study and\nso the institutions that we've relied on\nto protect us are not moving as rapidly\nas technology is evolving right does\nthat kind of make sense to people like\ntechnology is just moving so fast and so\nour Approach at healthy gamer is that we\ncan't sort of rely on the government to\nfix the problem we can't really rely on\nvideo game developers to fix the problem\nso what we really have to do is teach\npeople themselves about their own\nattention how do you control your\nattention how do you understand what\nyour desires are how do you accomplish\nwhat you want and so our focus is on the\nindividual because we sort of can't rely\non anyone else to fix the problem for us\nso we've got to fix it ourselves"
