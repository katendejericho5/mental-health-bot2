    "transcript": "so we have this thing called Dr K's\nguide to mental health which is a course\non Mental Health but there are a couple\nthings that are a little bit different\nabout this course the first is that when\nwe think about a course we think about\nit as linear right you start with lesson\none and you go all the way to lesson ten\nbut our course on Mental Health has like\nkind of a branching logic where when you\ncome into the course it gives you an\nassessment that sort of sees okay does\nthis person suffer from anxiety do they\nsuffer from depression do they have ADHD\nand then based on their answers it\nactually gives them a customizable track\nthat sort of meets their educational\nneeds they also have choices where there\nare Branch points where you can learn a\nlittle bit about okay how can I learn\nabout meditation or do I need to learn\nabout medication and so it sort of\noffers this branching logic and I think\nthat what we've tried to do at healthy\nGamers create sort of customizable\nexperiences for people that are both\nentertaining and helpful"
