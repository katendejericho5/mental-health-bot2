    "transcript": "if you are in a relationship and you\nreally want to make it work which I\nthink is worthwhile right that's why\nwe're making this video this is a video\nabout don't run for the hills because\nthat's what our media tells us our media\ntells us hey if you've got a crazy ax\nleave but the truth of the matter is\nthat people with borderline personality\ndisorder are human beings and are just\nas deserving of healthy relationships\nand love and stability as anyone else\nthe unfortunate thing is chances are\nthey were traumatized at some point in\ntheir life which makes it harder for\nthem to successfully do that and so as\nyou ride that roller coaster I'd\nstrongly recommend that you actually see\na therapist and so do everything that\nyou can to stay stable yourself because\nremember their sense of self relates to\nwho you are right they become a mirror\nso the key thing and this is how\nrelationships help people with BPD is\nthat the more stable you are the more\nstable they will become so don't give up\non them because they're wonderful\nbeautiful human beings and don't fall\nfor the highs or the lows good luck\nyou're gonna need it"
