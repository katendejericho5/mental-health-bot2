    "transcript": "all right so today we're going to talk\nabout how to successfully have a\nrelationship with someone with\nborderline personality disorder\nso this is something that I've been\nwanting to talk about for a while\nthere's a lot of resources out there uh\nfor people with borderline personality\ndisorder there are also places like\nsupport groups for people who are dating\npeople or in relationships with people\nwith borderline personality disorder but\nI've worked with a lot of people with\nBPD and I've worked with a lot of people\nwho've dated people with BPD and the\ntruth of the matter is that oftentimes\nBPD is viewed as a red flag and what a\nlot of people will will get in terms of\nadvice is that hey like your family and\nfriends will tell you if someone has BPD\nlike you should break up with them right\nbecause the relationship is such a\nroller coaster and there are so many red\nflags and they're so emotionally\nmanipulative and you're like you're not\nsure what's going on you're dating this\nperson they're like they're getting\nbetter and everything seems fine and\nthen you wake up tomorrow and it's like\nyou're back to square one it can be\nincredibly incredibly like a wild ride\nwhich can be emotionally exhausting and\nso the the sad truth is that a lot of\npeople will sort of like end up avoiding\npeople with BP D and it sort of makes\nsense because that can be a very\nchallenging relationship to have and\nthis isn't really enhanced by like media\ndepictions of BPD so if you look at\num you know how the media and TV shows\nand movies will kind of portray people\nwith BPD It's usually the crazy\nex-girlfriend and a lot of people out\nthere will sort of like you know they'll\nhave a crazy ex-girlfriend who was like\nit was one hell of a roller coaster of a\nrelationship and so this is I think\nreally important because people with BPD\nactually do get better they can form\nvery very wonderful healthy\nrelationships I've seen that happen over\nand over again and the truth of the\nmatter is that sometimes we fall in love\nwith someone who has a diagnosable\nmental illness and I don't think that\nit's good to just discard that person\nbecause they have a mental illness and\nsometimes having a mental illness can be\nreally hard on your partner as well as\non yourself so what I'd love to do today\nis talk y'all through a couple of things\nthe first is help you all understand\nsome of the basic 6 of BPD the second is\nhelp you understand how some of the core\nfeatures of borderline personality\ndisorder can manifest within a\nrelationship and the third is some\nprinciples that I've seen have sort of\nled to more successful relationships\nwith people with BPD so let's kind of\nstart with some basic facts so the first\nthing to understand about dating someone\nwith BPD is chances are they will get\nbetter so the research suggests that 35\npercent of people with BPD will actually\nbe in remission at one year so that\nmeans that BPD kind of goes away after\none year for about 35 percent of people\nbut what about like higher odds so if\nyou look at people with BPD 10 years out\n91 percent of them are in remission and\nthey actually hit a 99\nremission rate at about 16 years so what\nthat means is that a lot of people will\nthink that if someone is a crazy\nex-girlfriend if they stay with that\nperson that person will remain crazy for\ntheir the rest of their lives and this\nis what you have to put up with for the\nrest of your life but the truth of the\nmatter is that for the majority of\npeople BPD actually resolves and the way\nthat it resolves is by having oftentimes\na stable relationship and so the reason\nthese people get stuck is because\nthere's kind of too much to handle too\nmuch of a roller coaster they get dumped\nand then like the whole cycle kind of\nrepeats itself they feel more insecure\nwe'll kind of get to that but the first\nthing that I want to tell you is that if\nyou're in a relationship with someone\nwith BPD or you have BPD that the good\nnews is that actually like you know 99\nof people are actually okay after about\n16 years and 35 percent of people are\nbetter after one year so it kind of you\nknow Paces out that way so the second\nthing that we have to talk a little bit\nabout is the gender breakdown in BPD so\nabout 75 percent of people who have BPD\nare women and this is part of the reason\nwhy I think they're characterized this\nway in movies and like TV shows and\nstuff yeah our media portrayals are\nusually focused on women and that's\nthere's like some amount of like truth\nto that right because the majority of\npeople who have BPD happen to be women\nsome recent research is suggesting that\nthe ratio is actually closer to one to\none or fifty percent and today what\nwe're going to talk about is some of the\nexamples that I'll use will be sort of\nfocused on a woman with BPD because\nthat's most of the experience that I've\ndealt with but there are absolutely\ncases and we'll touch on these as well\nwhere men can have BPD too and those can\nbe really challenging relationships okay\nso don't give up hope you don't have to\ndump them we're not saying that you\nshouldn't dump them if that relationship\nisn't right for you but I I want to tell\ny'all first and foremost that having BPD\neven though it can be a red flag does\nnot mean that it is an insurmountable\nproblem in a relationship so let's move\non to understanding a couple of the core\nfeatures of BPD the first thing to\nunderstand about BPD is that these\npeople have difficulty with emotional\nregulation so if you look at the brains\nof people with BPD they actually suffer\nmore than the average human being and\nhow can you say that Dr K like oh my God\nlike isn't all suffering equal how can\nwe compare suffering like everyone is\nentitled to suffer yes that's true\neveryone is entitled to suffering we\nshouldn't compare suffering but\nyou can actually do brain scans on\npeople with BPD you can actually study\ntheir reactions in their brain and what\nyou discover is something that's really\ninteresting so the amount of time that\nit takes the average person to feel a\nnegative emotion is like let's say\nsomewhere between 5 and 30 seconds\npeople with BPD feel negative emotions\nmore rapidly than people with normal\nbrains they feel those emotions more\nintensely so they feel worse faster the\nmeasurable blood flow to the negative\ncircuits of their brain is actually\nincreased so they literally feel that\nemotion more intensely than average and\nthis is the actually most damaging thing\nin my clinical experience is the amount\nof time the duration of that negative\nemotional experience is way longer than\naverage so whereas I may get really\nupset for like 20 minutes or 30 minutes\nlike after about half an hour I'll kind\nof cool down whereas if you look at some\npeople with BPD they it will ruin their\nentire day or that negative emotional\nexperience can last for like 24 hours so\nthis is something that's really\nimportant to understand because there's\ngoing to be a high amount of emotional\nactivity in their brains the second\nthing to understand about BPD is that\nthe way that they feel about themselves\nis highly tied to the way that they are\ntreated so if you look at the core\nproblem of BPD in my opinion this is\nkind of my take as a psychiatrist it is\na sense of self that is not well\ndeveloped so what does this kind of mean\nthis means that let's say that I have\nlike an opinion of myself right I\nbelieve hey my name is alok I'm like\nkind of like a decent dude I'm not\nperfect I'm not terrible and so as I\nmove through the world I will get\nfeedback right so if someone like yells\nat me at a grocery store I have this\nsense of self which is different from\nthe way that I'm treated and so that\nprovides me with resilience if someone\ncalls me a piece of crap I'm not going\nto believe that because I have an\ninternal sense of self some similarly if\nsomeone walks up to me and is like hey\nyou are the greatest thing since sliced\nbread you are the Messiah you are\nbeautiful you are amazing you were\nperfect I'm actually not going to\nbelieve that either because I know hey\nlike I'm flawed just like any other\nhuman being so the way that I what I\nthink about myself is based on an\ninternal sense of self-worth and so\ndepending on how I'm treated I'll kind\nof like buffer against the way that\npeople treat me so if you look at when\nthat sense of self-worth is not well\ndeveloped like teenagers are a really\ngood example of this right so when\nyou're a teenager if everyone starts\ntreating you like crap you are going to\nfeel like crap and that's normal that's\npart of the normal developmental process\nso in the case of BPD the core problem\nis that their sense of self isn't very\nwell developed so they're not as\nresilient to other people's changes and\nso they become hypersensitive to the\nchanges of other people the third really\nreally core feature to understand about\nBPD people with BPD have a huge fear of\nAbandonment and there's a very very\ntight Coral relation between childhood\ntrauma and the development of BPD and\nchances are the nature of that trauma\nsomehow creates a fear of Abandonment\nwithin the person with BPD okay so now\nthat we understand these three core\nthings difficulties with emotional\nregulation a very not resilient sense of\nself and a fear of Abandonment will\nstart to see how these manifest in\nrelationships so if you look at the\ndiagnostic criteria for BPD like you\nliterally look at like how we diagnose\nBPD one of the core features of the\ndiagnosis is a pattern of intense and\nunstable relationships so why is this so\nit kind of comes down to understanding\nthis emotional regulation piece if you\nlook at a normal relationship it'll be\nkind of like a bell curve in terms of\nemotional experiences so most of the\nemotional experiences that you have with\nyour partner will be like kind of\nmediocre right like you're like cooking\ntogether you're doing dishes maybe\nyou'll get into a little bit of a fight\nyou celebrate your birthday and it's\nlike pretty fun and it's like pretty\nchill it's like not that wild it's like\nlife is pretty normal with most people\nthe thing is when you're dating someone\nwith BPD those relationships can be more\nu-shaped so instead of most of the\nexperiences being emotionally in the\nmiddle they're actually emotionally at\nthe extremes and it feels like a real\nroller coaster because you know the\nexperiences that you're having are like\nreally really wild it's like oh my God\non one day like this relationship is\nintense and it's beautiful it's amazing\noh my God we're like so in love and it's\nlike so like oh my God this this person\nis the one we spent 72 hours together\nand we didn't spend a minute apart and\nit was like oh my God it was like all\nthe movies and then when you leave on\nMonday morning and you don't answer a\ntext it's like whoa now we're suddenly\nswinging to the other end of the\npendulum what is wrong with you why\ndon't you text me back like I thought we\nhad something real I thought you were\nthe one I thought you meant it when you\nsaid you loved me like they'll say all\nkinds of like really nasty emotionally\nmanipulative toxic stuff right and then\nyou're like oh my God this is terrible\nand then y'all meet again and then she\nstarts crying and then you feel terrible\nand you're crying and then you guys hug\nand then like you're together again and\nlike you're past it all and you really\ndo love each other and love conquers all\nand then you know you start to get an\nerection and then you have makeup sex\nand it's like oh my God we're back to\nthe other end that's what relationships\nwith BPD can be like it's one hell of a\nride right with a very very wild\nemotional swing so why does this happen\nit happens because of the difficulty\nwith emotional regulation so what people\nwith BPD do is when they start to feel\nabandoned right because you had these\nthree days where y'all were joint at the\nhip and then you don't text someone back\nwhat that person does is they start to\nfeel abandoned as they start to feel\nabandoned remember they start to suffer\nmore than you do so whereas like fear of\nAbandonment may hurt you a little bit\nlike it's real really intense for them\nand lasts for a whole day and then what\nthey start doing is they start engaging\nin behaviors to kind of bring you back\nand so then they'll start texting you\nreally toxic stuff right or it'll like\nthey'll like like bounce between like\nreally toxic and like really sad things\nthat like really pull at your\nheartstrings they're like apologizing\nI'm so sorry I'm crying like oh my God\nlike will you ever forgive me and it's\nlike then you feel like an [ __ ] they\nmake you feel guilty so you're like yeah\nof course I'll forgive you it's okay\nright and so it's like your emotions\nbecome this ping pong ball and why do\nyour emotions become a ping-pong ball\nbecause their emotions are ping pong\nball and they're kind of getting bounced\nall over the place which brings us to\nthe the second thing that's very common\nin BPD relationships which is the\nfeeling of mixed signals well kind of\nlike a pendulum this kind of comes down\nto this fear of Abandonment so sometimes\nwhat happens when people have BPD is\nwhen they're engaged in a relationship\nyou know what's going to happen is like\ntheir things are going pretty well and\ny'all are having lots of fun but in the\nback of their mind they've been\nabandoned so much in the past right\nbecause they got abandoned as kids\nthere's like that seat of trauma back\nthere and then they've had so many\nrelationships which were so amazing and\nhow did those emotion relationships\nalways end up the other person always\nended up leaving right because like they\ncouldn't deal with the crazy so they\nleft and so each time someone can't deal\nwith the crazy it traumatizes them\nfurther increases the fear of\nAbandonment so now what they know\nthey're going to try to protect\nthemselves and they're going to try to\nprotect you and the way that they're\ngoing to do that is when things are good\nthey're going to start to when is this\nother shoe going to drop when are things\ngoing to go back to the way that they\nalways end up because remember it\nhappened seven times eight times nine\ntimes ten times so it's got to happen\n11th time right so then what they'll\nstart to do is they'll start to push you\naway and they'll start to test you right\nthey'll start to say things that will\nfeel a little bit weird it'll feel\nreally emotionally manipulative and all\nthis emotional manipulation by the way\nis pretty unconscious so that's like\nsomething you got to give them a pass\nfor if you can so they'll start to like\ndo things like oh yeah you know I know\nthat this week has really been fantastic\nand I know that we're deeply in love but\nyou know I know it won't last we'll say\nsomething like that and you'll be like\nno no no no baby like of course it'll\nlast like no no don't think that like\nI'll be here for you forever and they'll\nsay no no no you won't you know you're\njust saying that today but tomorrow\nit'll change right no relationships last\nforever and you're like no baby no no no\nand so then you reassure them so let's\nthink about what's happening in that\nmoment remember that they have\ndifficulty regulating their own emotions\nso what they rely on is you to regulate\ntheir emotions so you become the\nmechanism of their emotional equilibrium\nso if I'm feeling abandoned I'm gonna be\na little bit pathetic you won't love me\nforever and then what do I evoke in you\nwhat I evoke in you is no no no baby\nI'll be around forever like I love you\nforever oh my God oh my God you're the\none for me and then the fear of\nAbandonment goes away right that's great\nyou fix the problem it's beautiful and\nnow though something subtle has happened\nso now you start to Bear the emotional\nburden of their roller coaster you're\nnot only managing your own roller\ncoaster now they have made you\nresponsible for their roller coaster and\nyou've been a willing recipient and so\nthen what happens is they'll start to\npush you away right they'll they'll\nstart to they'll say it the first time\nyou're like yeah baby I love you forever\nbabe and then a week goes by and they're\nlike oh yeah you're gonna break up with\nme like no I won't and then the month\nlater they're saying it again and again\nand again and again and again and again\nand again and it can manifest in other\nways too but they start to push you away\nstart to do things that kind of piss you\noff they start to pick fights and then\nyou're like fine you want me to leave\nI'll leave and so you get fed up and you\nwalk the door now all of their fears\nhave become true and so then what they\ndo is they activate a completely\ndifferent circuit which is reeling you\nin so now that they are actually being\nabandoned there's the fear of\nAbandonment and then there's the actual\nabandonment and when they start to\nbecome abandoned they activate a whole\nother set of survival mechanisms to pull\nyou back because oh my God now it's\nhappening the sky is falling everything\nis falling apart engage emergency\ntechniques DEFCON 5 and so now they\ncompletely change their tune I'm so\nsorry will you ever forgive me I'm such\na piece of crap I can't believe I did\nthis to you you deserve so much better\nthan me please tell me anything anything\nI'll do anything you know I'll do\nanything to bring you back and by the\nway my life has been so hard and and\nyou're so perfect and I love you so much\nright and this is when we get into a\nthird thing that kind of happens we'll\nactually we'll table that for a second\nso then what happens is they engage in\nall of these behaviors they'll go Full\nSpeed Ahead on whatever they can do to\nbring you back anything you want\nanything you want anything you want just\ncome back just come back just come back\nand so they say I've changed babe I've\nchanged I'll do anything for you and\nthen you come back and now you're here\nagain right so all of those survival\nmechanisms disappear all those reeling\nyou in mechanisms disappear and now the\nfear that you're going to abandon them\nagain happens again and then they start\npushing you away put pushing you right\npushing you away and so this cycle\nrepeats over and over and over again and\npeople get fed up with it and they're\ndone like honestly like I was talking to\none of my patients a couple years ago\nwho's a gamer and they were saying like\nyou know what this feels like is it\nfeels like I'm in a game of Mortal\nKombat and I'm fighting against Scorpion\nand Scorpion's like get over here jerks\nme in and then uppercuts me all the way\nback across the screen and as soon as\nI'm over there it's get over here again\nand then jerking me back and so you're\ngetting jerked this way and jerked back\nthat way and it's like it's too much to\nhandle so the third thing that we're\ngoing to talk about which kind of\nrelates to this right so once you've\ngone away they're like I'll do anything\nyou're perfect please please please the\nthird thing that that people with BPD do\nis something called splitting so\nsplitting is when you take remember it's\nnot the bell curve so most people aren't\nnormal they take that and they shove\npeople to the sides so they idealize\nsome people and they demonize other\npeople this can cause real problems in\ntreatment situations especially like\ninpatient situations where they'll\nidealize the doc after and they'll\ndemonize the nurse they'll treat the\nnurse like absolute crap the nurse hates\nme the nurse is pathetic I dislike the\nnurse and oh my God the doctor is\namazing the doctors cured my trauma like\nyou're the best doctor I've ever seen\nand oh my God I just wish the nurses\nwere a little bit more like you and then\nas a doctor you're like what do you mean\nby that they're like well they're so\ncruel to me and what they'll try to do\nis they'll split so they'll idealize\nsome people they'll demonize other\npeople and they can create conflict\nbecause now the doctors are getting mad\nat the nurses right because the doctors\nare like oh my God the people issues\nwith BPD are like you're so amazing\nyou're so awesome and then you go and\nyou're like hey we need to talk about\nthis patient the way that y'all are\ntreating them it's really inappropriate\nthe way that y'all are not behaving with\ncompassion and then they create conflict\nwhat is that idealization look like in\nthe relationship and now we gotta pause\nfor a second right because when you date\npeople with BPD or when you see these\nlike crazy ex-girlfriends on like TV\nshows and stuff or crazy ex-boyfriends\nyou gotta ask yourself like and everyone\nasks themselves right why on Earth are\nwe dating these people right like why\nwould you ever date a crazy chick or a\ncrazy dude and your family members and\nyour friends are like why on Earth are\nyou in this relationship like I don't\nget it it seems so toxic it's such a\nroller coaster and that's because they\ndo not understand what it's like to be\nidealized because for this person oh my\nGod if you have any iota of insecurity\nyourself dating someone with BPD is the\nbest thing in the universe this is why\npeople with BPD always end up with\nnarcissists by the way not always but\nmany times statistically there's a\ncorrelation there because what happens\nis they idealize you they're like oh my\nGod for those 72 hours you're so amazing\nall my previous boyfriends have been so\nterrible i've been abused so much I'm so\nhurt I was thinking about killing myself\nsuicidality is very common but every\ntime I talk to you it makes it go away\nand oh my God I was so hurt and everyone\nis terrible and I'm suicidal but the\nmoment that I get that penis everything\ngets better you may make it all go away\na lifelong of trauma just with your dick\nis just gone and if you were a dude holy\ncrap that is so addicting and what does\nthat look like for the women who are\ndating men with BPD they're good looking\nthey're intelligent they're funny\nthey're engaged with you and oh my God\nthey have the sensitive side oh my God\nthey cried in your arms and y'all made\nlove and like until the sun came up and\nthey confessed their trauma to you and\nthey're like I was going to kill myself\nuntil I met you and you found this\nperfect human being this this damaged\nthis broken this traumatized but oh my\nGod you can fix him you can fix him they\nidealize you holy crap is it addictive\nand then they demonize you and what's so\naddictive about that is like oh my God\nthis relationship is so good 50 of the\ntime and the other 50 of the time it's\nsuch a mess and so if you're dating\nsomeone in this situation you're like\nhow do I move things in the right\ndirection because if if we can go to 55\n60 75 80 90 like then this relationship\nis working I can make it work because\nwhat do they say the second that you're\nlike I'm done with this this is too much\nthis is too crazy all my friends say\nyou're crazy they're like I'll change\nbaby I'll change for you please give me\nthe D that's all I need right and\nthey're like okay fine and that's what\nhappens right and so what people don't\nappreciate is that like sure you think\npeople are stupid for dating the crazy\nperson but there's a damn good reason\nthat you're dating that person that's\nwhat they don't see and this is where if\nyou look at human behavior it's the\nrandom reinforcement schedule which is\nlike if you look at like slots and stuff\nand gambling right it's like being\nperfect 50 of the time and being crap 50\nof the time is more likely to engage you\nthan being like mediocre all the time\nand so this idealization demonization\naspect is really hard to deal with\nbecause on one day you're God's gifter\nto this person and you fix everything in\ntheir life and on the other day they get\nangry with you because you're starting\nto pull away with them and they treat\nyou like absolute crap okay so this I\nidealization is really important to\nunderstand the next thing that we're\ngoing to touch on so this is kind of an\ninteresting aspect is when we talked a\nlittle bit about you know they don't\nhave a a strong internal sense of self\nwhat that can sometimes look like is\npeople with BPD are really good at\nplaying chameleon and remember that they\ntheir own emotional state is kind of\nlike a mirror of what you feel so if\nyou're angry they're angry or if and and\none way that that can look and this can\nbe kind of confusing for people is that\nthey will adopt the mannerisms and\ninterests of people around you so\nsometimes you'll meet someone and it's\nlike wow I'm into underwater basket\nweaving and this person is like super\ninto underwater basket weaving I'm into\nan anime they're into anime like oh my\nGod I found a dude who like loves to\nlike cook like that's amazing like\nthat's pretty cool right so I found a\ndude who loves to like organize things\nin glass jars in the pantry like that's\nwild and so some of the things that can\nbe really confusing is when you first\nmeet this person they can start to\nbecome a little bit of a chameleon and\nkind of like shape themselves to your\ninterests and then the problem problem\nis that as the relationship goes on like\nthat's not a genuine interest on their\npart they were just kind of not really\npretending but they were absorbing a\npiece of your identity is really a\nbetter way to put it and then like it\nbecomes kind of frustrating because you\nkind of feel like a little bit LED on\nyou feel a little bit deceived I don't\nthink the deception is intentional it's\njust people with PPD are a little bit\nlike a mirror where they like what you\nsee in them is what they see right so\nthey start to become a little bit of\nreflection now if you're listening to\nthis you know and and maybe you're a\nfriend or family member said like oh my\nGod like why would you date this person\nlike I may be painting a really bad\npicture of oh my God clearly you gotta\nrun for the Hills right but no actually\nyou don't need to run for the hills like\nwhether you run for the hills or not is\nultimately like your choice and you have\nto really think about whether you know\ndon't feel guilty either way but I don't\nwant you to leave them because they have\nBPD but I don't want you to stay with\nthem because out of guilt my hope is to\neducate you and if you decide hey I\nreally want to try to build a\nrelationship with this person I want to\ntry to help y'all understand this as\nbest as you you can okay so how do you\nsucceed in a situation like this so the\nfirst thing is don't give up okay so\nlike I shared at the very beginning BPD\nis something that for the vast majority\nof people enters remission in a stable\nrelationship is something that can be\nreally really impactful and positive\ntowards that and the other aspect of\ndon't give up is remember it's a roller\ncoaster so what that sort of means is\nthat even if things feel really really\nreally awful if you can kind of be\nneutral for long enough the awful\nperiods will disappear and even if\nthings feel really really really really\namazing that'll kind of like normalize\ntoo so in a bizarre way the main reason\nthat I would say don't give up on people\nat BPD is because time is actually on\nyour side things will naturally turn\nreturn to an equilibrium so like you\ndon't have to react to a particular\nthing which is the core of the problem\nright is they have all of these\nbehaviors and we end up reacting to them\nand then as we react to their behaviors\nwe evoke a whole different set of\nbehaviors all a scorpion and then we end\nup reacting to those so we're sort of\nfelt like it feels like we're being like\nyo-yoed back and forth in this\nrelationship so as best as you can try\nnot to give up and remember that things\nwill return to equilibrium so the second\nthing that I would strongly strongly\nrecommend is that you do your best to\nset boundaries with compassion so this\nis actually really hard but like people\nwith with BPD will interpret meaning in\nactions that you have that is not what\nyou meant so for example let's say I'm\ndating someone with BPD they'll text me\nand I don't answer their text because\nI'm at work they will feel the reason\nI'm not texting them is because I don't\nlike them or I don't love them or I've\nmet someone else these are the kinds of\nthoughts that go through their head and\nI know this because I've had tons of\npatients with BPD and so what I do as a\npsychiatrist is try to help them\nunderstand that okay like you can have\nthat emotional reaction but the way\nyou're reading the situation isn't\nnecessarily and so what we try to do is\nwe try to set boundaries with them hey I\nmay not be able to text you at work but\nyou don't want to do it in emotionally\nreactive way and you want to try to do\nit as compassionately as possible and\nthe whole problem in relationships with\nBPD is that when we set boundaries\nthere's a lot of negative emotion\nassociated with it I don't know why you\nconstantly text me what do you expect I\ncan't text you all hours a day I have a\nlife and oh that is the worst thing to\nsay because now you have a life and you\nhave a life outside of them and that\nevokes the fear of Abandonment it's\nhappening again and so it's this this\nwhole cycle and mess so instead what you\nwant to do is set boundaries but set it\nwith compassion hey I'm sorry that I\nwasn't able to answer your text the\ntruth of the matter is sometimes when\nI'm at work I I can't afford to be\ndistracted I'm sorry that that hurts you\nI recognize that hurts you I'm going to\nthink long and hard about what I can do\nabout that I do really care about you\nbut there are some things that you know\nI can't do for you and that boundary\nsetting can also be in relation to like\nemotional regulation so this is another\nkey thing that we really have to do is\nyou have to start weaning yourself off\nbeing the source of their emotional\nregulation I'm not saying that you can't\nemotionally support them but as long as\ntheir method to manage their own\nemotions is you you're going to burn out\nso this is where I would strongly\nencourage that you encourage them and\nmaybe even with them start to develop\nalternate emotional regulation skills a\ngreat way to manage their emotions\noutside of your relationship is actually\ntherapy this is one of the times where\nI'm not going to say sign them up for\ncoaching you should see a trained\ntherapist because we're talking about a\ndiagnosis okay you can also do things\nlike meditation mindfulness there are\nall sorts of other emotional regulation\ntechniques like yoga and things like\nthat but they you're going to have to\nstart to they in order for this\nrelationship to survive there must be\neffort put into emotional regulation\nthat does not rely on you okay so that's\nreally critical the next thing that\nwe're going to talk about is a little\nbit weird but this is don't overreact to\nthe highs the biggest mistake that I see\na lot of people who have relationships\nwith BPD make is that they hate the lows\nso we're totally fine getting rid of the\nlows but we don't want to get rid of the\nhighs right like dude when a woman tells\nme that the only thing in life that it\nwill will fix all the trauma is my dick\nthat's really addictive right because\nwe're men and like we our self-esteem is\nbased on the performance of our penis or\nsinus of our penis or whatever and\nespecially if I have a average sized\npenis or less than average sized penis\nlike that's going to mean so much to me\nso one of the key things that I found\nworking with people with BPD and people\nwho are dating BPD is that you can't\ngive in to the highs as well so you need\nTranquility from the highs and the lows\nso if there's something super amazing\nthat you all are about to engage in you\nneed the same amount of restraint which\nis something that in society we never\ntalk about right we're all for getting\nrid of the lows but no one's like hey by\nthe way you should temper your highs you\nshould not not lean into the best parts\nof your relationship what that's insane\nbut the key thing in BPD is that we\ndon't want to be reactive right we don't\nwant to follow the yoyo when it's on its\nown we don't ride the roller coaster all\nthe way up because as soon as we go all\nthe way up there's going to be a plunge\nright so we want to stay as neutral as\npossible the next thing that we're going\nto talk a little bit about is\nencouraging the dialectic so this is\nsuper cool but there's one of the best\nevidence-based treatments of uh for\nborderline personality disorder\nsomething called dialectical behavioral\ntherapy and this is a comp it's\nbasically cognitive behavioral therapy\nwith some amount of mindfulness and\nEastern Concepts mixed in and the way\nthat the therapy was developed is\nactually super cool too because there\nwas actually a psychologist who had BPD\nherself and she's been pretty open about\nthis and her experience was that you\nknow treat therapy didn't offer quite\nenough and so then she got into\nmindfulness and she discovered like one\nkey concept from Eastern thinking which\nin Sanskrit is advait vedanta which then\nshe found like okay this is what's\nmissing from therapy and the cool thing\nis that this is not an aspect of therapy\nthis is actually an aspect of advaith\nvedanta in the meditative traditions and\neveryone should be learning this kind of\nstuff so what does it mean to encourage\nthe dialectic so remember that people\nwith BPD have very black and white\nthinking right they split so either you\nare an angel or you are a demon there's\nnothing in between and so in the\nexperience of people with BPD is often\nthat if you're mad at me that means you\nhate me if you are mad at me that means\nyou don't love me so they tie everything\ntogether they cannot sit with the idea\nthat someone is angry with me and loves\nme at the same time so literally the\ntherapy that we try to engage in is to\nteach people that hey someone can be mad\nat you and love you at the same time\nthat someone can treat you really well\nand not love you at the same time\nbecause the sad truth is that oftentimes\npeople with BPD will wind up in abusive\nrelationships with narcissists and those\npeople will treat them well sometimes\nbut actually not really be invested in\nthem or will take advantage of them so\none of the key things that you can do in\nthe relationship is encourage the\ndialectic and even ask questions like\nhey if we're having a fight right now\nwhat do you think about whether I love\nyou or not if we're findings does that\nmean that I can love you at the same\ntime or does that mean that I don't love\nyou that's where you can have like a\ncalm conversation hopefully and you can\nwork at it that hey just because I'm mad\ndoesn't mean that I don't love you just\nbecause I don't text you doesn't mean\nthat I dislike you just because you keep\non asking me whether I find other women\nattractive and I one time say yes\ndoesn't mean that I'm Gonna Leave You\nright there are all kinds of things and\nencourage that dialectic where both\nthings two conflicting things can be\nsimultaneously true I can be frustrated\nwith you and love you I can be busy and\ncare about you I can be mad at you and\nhave compassion towards you so that\ndialectic becomes really important the\nlast thing and this is also really\nimportant is to stay stable yourself so\nI strongly recommend that if you are in\na relationship and you really want to\nmake it work which I think is worthwhile\nright that's why we're making this video\nthis is a video about don't run for the\nhills because that's what our media\ntells us our media tells us hey if\nyou've got a crazy ax leave right and\nthe internet tells you hey if she's\ncrazy Lee tells you hey if he's crazy\nleave that's what everyone is telling us\nto do your family your friends but the\ntruth of the matter is that people with\nborderline personality disorder are\nhuman beings and are just as deserving\nof healthy relationships and love and\nstability as anyone else the unfortunate\nthing is chances are they were\ntraumatized at some point in their life\nwhich makes it harder for them to\nsuccessfully do that they have so many\nadaptations in survival mechanisms and\nMal adaptations that dating them can be\nreally hard and so as you ride that\nroller coaster try to stay stable\nyourself so what does that mean that\nmeans sometimes seeing a therapist\nyourself once again goes kind of Beyond\ncoaching if your problem is like hey I\nhave trouble getting out of bed in the\nmorning or I'm trying to figure out what\nto do with my career like you know\nwhatever if you want to learn how to\nmeditate get Dr case guide whatever but\nif you're in a relationship with someone\nwith BPD I'd strongly recommend that you\nactually see a therapist and so do\neverything that you can to stay stable\nyourself because remember their sense of\nself relates to who you are right they\nbecome a mirror so the key thing and\nthis is how relationships help people\nwith BPD is that the more stable you are\nthe more stable they will become so\ndon't give up on them because they're\nwonderful beautiful human beings and\ndon't fall for the highs or the lows\ngood luck you're gonna need it so one\nlast kind of like quick disclaimer so a\nlot of the stuff in this video has been\nkind of like hyperbolic and I want to\nshare with you all that the actual\nexperience of people with BPD and a lot\nof these examples are like widely\nvariable right so\npart of the challenge of trying to\neducate people on the Internet is that I\ntry to say things that will resonate and\nconnect with people but at the same time\nI could be playing into an exacerbating\nstereotypes so from the bottom of my\nheart if I've offended anyone I'm really\nsorry I try to be entertaining and\neducational but I want all y'all to\nunderstand that what we were talking\nabout today was sort of hyperbolic and\nthere's actually a lot of variability\nwith the way that people with BPD will\npresent and manifest\nforeign"
