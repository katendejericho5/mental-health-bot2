    "transcript": "when I was growing up I used to watch\nthis show called Sesame Street the thing\nabout Sesame Street is when you're\nwatching TV as a kid Sesame Street gives\nyou a story over 30 minutes so my\nattention span was 30 minutes but now if\nyou look at things like apps what we\nnotice is that first there were blogs\nand in order to engage with blogs you\nhad to read three pages and that has now\nturned into Twitter 160 characters we\nstarted with YouTube right where people\nused to make 20 minute videos now we\nhave Tick Tock which is like 60 seconds\nor less as the pace of technology is\ngetting quicker our brain no longer\nneeds to pay attention for extended\nperiods of time and if you watch your\nchild on an iPad they scroll quickly\nright they get bored of something they\nclick on the next thing they click on\nthe next thing they kind of give in to\ntheir boredom and they rely on the\ntechnology to give them stimulation\ninstead of training their mind to pay\nattention to something for an extended\nperiod of time so I think we are seeing\na technological impact on our attention\nas a whole"
