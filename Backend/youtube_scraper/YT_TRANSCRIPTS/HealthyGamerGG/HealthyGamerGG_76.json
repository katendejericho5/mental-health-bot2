    "transcript": "so see people who slip into one-way\nrelationships do so usually because of\nsome kind of insecurity when you grow up\nin a situation where your value as a\nhuman being is not shown to you when you\ndon't grow up with an intrinsic sense of\nvalue some people learn that my value is\nbased on what I provide and if you learn\nthe lesson of my value is based on what\nI provide then you will try very very\nhard to provide value for someone else\nto demonstrate your Worth to them and\nthey'll be fine with that because hey\nyou're so nice you're a wonderful person\nyou're giving me stuff you're giving me\nstuff I'm the beneficiary and so then\nthe problem is that if you try to set a\nboundary with them or you try to talk to\nthem or you try to set a limit or you\ntry to confide your own stuff this can\nbe very hard for you because you feel\nlike this person doesn't deserve to\nlisten to this you know this person like\nI don't need to bore them with my day so\nyou'll hear all of these like you'll\nnotice all these like selfworth\nself-esteem kind of thoughts and\nemotions arise when you try to create a\nreciprocal relationship"
