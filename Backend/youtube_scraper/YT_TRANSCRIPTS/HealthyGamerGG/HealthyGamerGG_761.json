    "transcript": "all right my dudes today we're going to\ntalk about birth control\ngenerally speaking men are totally fine\nwith blood right so like if you talk to\nmost dudes like we're totally cool\nwatching a scary movie where some you\nknow Monster is tearing people apart or\nwe're totally fine playing video games\nwhere there's like blood and gore and\nguts and like finishing moves and Mortal\nKombat or like whatever so we're totally\nfine with that unless it's menstrual\nblood and if it's menstrual blood we're\nkind of like denethor from Lord of the\nRings I don't know if you all have seen\nthat or remember that whereas Suddenly\nIt's like flee flee Flee for your lives\nlike this dude has been sitting there\nfighting the armies of Sauron for like\nhis entire life and one thing happens\nand suddenly he drops everything and has\nto run away and goes completely crazy\nthat's what we're like when it comes to\nmenstruation hey there thanks for\nwatching and I'm glad these videos have\nbeen helpful a lot of times I'll read\nthe comments and see people asking well\nwhat do I actually do about it which is\na great question and unfortunately the\nresources out there haven't been that\ngreat which is precisely why I started\nHD in the first place HG coaches are\ntrained on a curriculum that integrates\nmy understanding of what motivates us\nwhat paralyzes us and most importantly\nwhat leads to Lasting behavioral change\nif you're ready to take the next step HG\ncoaches can help you build the life that\nyou want they've helped people build\ncareers help people find relationships\nbuild networks of friends and even do\nthings like discover their passions or\npursue Hobbies so if this sounds like\nsomething that you'd be interested in\ncheck out the link in the description\nbelow so today we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about menstruation female\novulatory Cycles which I know are not I\nknow it sounds kind of weird but this is\nnot like bizarre esoteric knowledge that\nis reserved only for doctors and like\nPagan witches right like this is these\nare normal bodily functions that every\nhuman being should know about in the\nsame way that women should understand\nlike okay this is an erection not every\ntime a dude gets an erection does it\nmean he's aroused right there's all\nkinds of basic stuff about the opposite\ngender that we don't really know so\ntoday we're going to teach y'all about\nthat because it will help you you a lot\nokay\nso let's start by understanding the\nfemale menstrual cycle so women have\novaries and men have testicles these are\nboth called gonads okay so gonad is the\nthe non-binary term for like the sex\nhormone producing part of our body\nso women's ovaries are situated kind of\noutside of their uterus so if you look\nat the the anatomy of a woman right so\nthere's a vagina and then there's a\ncervix and then beyond the cervix\nthere's a uterus and then the uterus has\nthese two things called Fallopian tubes\nand then the Fallopian tubes sit right\nnext to these things called the ovaries\nwhich are the female equivalent of\ntesticles in ovaries you have a bunch of\neggs so basically what happens in the\nfemale menstrual cycle is we've got two\nphases one is called the follicular\nphase which is when an egg is developing\nor a follicle is developing and then\nyou've got something called the\novulatory phase which is when the a\nwoman enters ovulation which if you\ndon't even know what that is we're gonna\nexplain that so in the ovaries there are\nthese little things called follicles and\nthen the follicle kind of supports an\negg when women ovulate what happens is\nthe egg kind of spits out of the\nfollicle and is prepared to be\nfertilized so the menstrual cycle is\nusually divided into 28 days and the\nfirst 14 days are the follicular phase\nwhich is when we're sort of getting\nready to be pregnant\nand then once the egg is ready we enter\novulation which is when the follicle\nspits out the egg and then there's a\nwindow of about three to five days\nleading up to ovulation and through\novulation where a woman can get pregnant\nand if a woman is not pregnant during\nthat time it doesn't become pregnant\nthen what happens is they enter into the\nphase of menstruation\nso let's talk a little bit about the\nfemale menstrual cycle\nso we have to understand there are two\nthings going on during the female\nmenstrual cycle the first is that we are\npreparing an egg and by we I mean women\nfor fertilization and the second is we\nare preparing the uterus for a pregnancy\nso these are two separate things right\nso if we've got a fertilized egg it\nneeds some place to hang out and grow\ninto an embryo a fetus and eventually a\nchild so these are two things that are\nkind of going on so we're going to first\ntalk about egg preparation so in the\novaries we have these little guys called\nfollicles and for the first 14 days of\nthe menstrual cycle this is called the\nfollicular phase where these follicles\nare being prepared and basically the\novary selects one follicle which has one\negg\nand then once that egg is kind of primed\nand ready it spits the egg out and then\nfor a period of about 24 hours that egg\ncan be fertilized if it gets fertilized\nin that time then what happens is it\nimplants into the wall of the uterus and\nbasically during the follicular phase\nthe the walls of the uterus are growing\nand growing in what way they're sort of\ngetting vascularized which means that if\nthere's a new human being that's going\nto be growing there or any animal if\nit's going to be growing there\nwe need a lot of blood flow to the\nembryo so during this 14 days that the\negg is getting ready\nthe uterus is actually building up a\nbunch of tissue to prepare for pregnancy\nokay\nnow if there is no fertilization of the\negg or the Egg doesn't implant then the\nuterus is like hey we built up all this\nlike vascular tissue we don't need this\nanymore and that then it induces\nmenstruation and what menstruation is is\nwe're shedding the the wall the lining\nof the walls of the uterus so we built\nup all this vascular tissue that can\nliterally sustain a new life and now we\ndon't need it anymore so we're going to\nget rid of it and that's what that\nmenstrual blood is so let's understand a\ncouple of things first the first is the\naverage amount of volume in menstruation\nis about two tablespoons or 30 to 40\nCC's this is it\nthis is all the blood there is I don't\nknow why dudes get so scared this is a\nsmall quantity of blood this is not very\nmuch right but since it's menstrual\nblood oh my god let's get terrified it's\n30 to 40 CC's for the average woman\nsecond thing we have to understand\nis that there's really only a three to\nfive day window where a woman can get\npregnant if they have a normal menstrual\ncycle so remember that\nafter ovulation so ovulation is when the\nfollicle spits out the egg there's a\n24-hour window before the egg kind of\nfalls apart maybe 36 but the key thing\nto remember this is where nature tricks\nyou is that sperm can stay alive in the\nuterus for a couple days before that so\nthere's really only a three to five day\nwindow every month where if a woman has\na normal menstrual cycle she can get\npregnant\nand so as we talk about birth control\nthat's something that's really important\nto remember okay\nso just to summarize menstrual cycles\nfirst of all are not scary it's okay\nit's a normal cycle it has 14 days of\nthe follicular phase then we spit the\negg out if the egg gets fertilized\nimplants into the uterus and we're on to\npregnancy but if it doesn't implant in\nthe uterus there's some stuff that\nhappens in over the course of the next\n14 days that's it kind of everything\nkind of winds down and then we sort of\nend up with menstruation okay so now\nlet's talk a little bit about birth\ncontrol so what we're going to do is\nreview a lot of different types of birth\ncontrol sort of what the efficacy is and\nconsiderations for when you should use\neach one so the first thing that we're\ngoing to talk about is we're going to\ndefine efficacy so what do we mean by\nefficacy of birth control so all of the\nstudies on birth control look at people\nwho are using a particular method for\none year\nand what is the chance they end up\npregnant or not pregnant if you're using\nthat method of birth control for one\nyear so for example when people say\ncondoms are 90 effective what does that\nmean that means that if people are\nhaving sex using condoms for the period\nof one year ninety percent of them will\nnot get pregnant ten percent of them\nwill it does not mean that a single\nusage of a condom means that there's a\n10 chance you're not rolling the dice\nwith a 10 chance that someone gets\npregnant and now it sort of makes sense\nbecause if we understand the menstrual\ncycle and women can only get pregnant\nthree to five days out of the month if\nthey have normal menstrual cycles and\nthen we're using a condom and sometimes\ncondoms grow up all that stuff has to\nalign in order for someone to get\npregnant okay so efficacy is using that\nbirth control over the period of one\nyear what are the chances that it\nprevents pregnancy\nso let's talk a minute about condoms so\ncondoms are special they're very special\nand very unique from other levels of\nbirth control for a couple of reasons\nthe first is that they're generally\nspeaking one of the only methods of\nbirth control that can prevent STIs so\nthis is really important because when we\nhave sex they're usually two things that\nwe're trying to avoid one is we're\ntrying to avoid pregnancy unless you're\ntrying to get pregnant which is totally\ncool\nand we're trying to avoid the\ntransmission of sexually transmitted\ndiseases okay so the condom is really\nthe only one that can prevent STIs so if\nyou are concerned about getting an STI\nor you're having sex with someone and\nyou don't know what their sexual history\nis you don't know what kind of you know\nPartners they've had or or how sexually\nthey active they are with other people\nit's probably a good idea to use a\ncondom so this is where even if you're\non birth control as a woman it may be a\ngood idea to use a condom anyway if\nyou're concerned at all about STIs so\nlet's talk for a second about STIs\ngenerally speaking there are two kinds\nof STIs there are viral infections and\nbacterial infections so bacterial\ninfections thankfully we can treat\nreally really well now so there used to\nbe old infections like syphilis like\nback in the day that would cause all\nkinds of problems they can damage your\nspinal cord get into your brain over\ntime and cause all kinds of you know\nbrain damage and stuff like that but\ngenerally speaking we can give people\nantibiotics to treat things like\nsyphilis gonorrhea chlamydia you take\ncoarse antibiotics and you're actually\nlike cured of the STI which is why it's\nreally really important that if\nsomething is happening with your junk\nwhether you're a dude or a woman or\nsomething in between if you've got like\na sore or something nasty down there or\na vesicle or a rash you need to go see a\ndoctor right away\nand why is that well because a lot of\ntimes when something goes wrong with\nyour body especially if it's junk you\ndon't want to show anyone you're just\ngoing to cross your fingers and hopes it\ngoes away and this is the thing your\nimmune system's pretty good so after a\nweek it may go away like it may actually\ndo that because our immune system is\npretty good the problem is that a lot of\nthese infections can be dormant for some\namount of time and then can cause damage\nlong term so if you ever see something\ngoing on with your junk you should\nabsolutely go see a doctor okay\nsecond kind of infection you can get is\ncalled a viral infection so viral\ninfections are a little bit trickier\nbecause we don't have great treatments\nthat will eradicate them so good\nexamples of viral infections are HIV\nwhich is essentially a lifelong\ndiagnosis things like herpes viruses and\nother very common viral infection which\nsomewhere between by the way 25 and 40\nof the population has okay\nso herpes will kind of stick with you\nbasically lifelong\nthe good news is that even with viral\ninfections\nwe're pretty good at treating them so\nfor herpes for example the severity and\nfrequency of outbreaks tends to go down\nover time most people actually not most\nbut you know 25 to 40 percent of people\nhave it and and it's not like ruining\nlives right left and center the other\nthing is HIV now has a normal life\nexpectancy we've got really good\ntreatments for HIV now there's also\nsomething that's really important to\nunderstand is if you are having sex with\nsomeone and it's kind of a high risk\nsituation the condom breaks or you don't\nuse a condom even if you've had sex we\nnow have something called post-exposure\nprophylaxis which means if you have sex\nwith someone without a condom who may be\nHIV positive you can actually start\ntaking retroviral medication after the\nsex like 24 hours later and it can\nactually prevent HIV infection so if\nyou're concerned at all about viral\ninfections you should absolutely once\nagain go see a doctor okay the third\nthing that we're going to add which is a\nlittle bit of a caveat is not everything\ngoing on with your junk is a sexually\ntransmitted infection so I've seen some\nrelationship ships get really really\nmessed up through this but let's say\nsomeone ends up with a rash their\npartner ends up with a rash everyone\nassumes it's sexually transmitted but\nthere are all kinds of other infections\nthat aren't transmitted via sex that can\nhappen to your junk so one example is if\nthe pH in the vagina changes you can\nstart to get fungal infections in there\nthere are some medications that will\ninduce you know fungal infections with\npenises or vaginas or things like that\nso not everything that is not all\ninfections of the junk is necessarily\nsexually transmitted bacterial vaginosis\nis another good example of that okay so\nyou can still get it treated right so\nit's it you should absolutely get it\ntreated but just because you have an\ninfection of your junk doesn't mean that\nyou necessarily got it from a partner\nthat's why you should once again go do\nwhat see a doctor very good okay so\nthat's condoms\nfrom birth control standpoint condoms\nare about 90 effective\nso if you don't want to use condoms now\nwe kind of move into predominantly\nfemale methods of birth control so the\nmost common female method of birth\ncontrol is probably the pill okay\nso how does the pill work remember now\nthat you all understood the female\nmenstrual cycle so remember that the\nfollicle grows and then spits out the\negg so how does female birth control\nwork female birth control works by\naltering hormones so that we pres\nprevent that ovulation and follicular\ndevelopment okay depending on what kind\nof birth control you use things can be a\nlittle bit different about what part of\nthe cycle it targets but essentially if\nthere's never an egg that gets ovulated\nout no one can ever get pregnant so what\nwe can do is add levels of estrogen and\nprogesterone which you kind of take on a\nregular basis and depending on what\ncombination you take it'll sort of\nprevent a different part of that\nmenstrual cycle\nthis is where it's important to remember\nthat different kinds of birth control\ncan be right for different sorts of\npeople so this is where it's also\nimportant for dudes to understand that\neven though you're taking a pill every\nday a lot of these birth controls can be\nvery unpleasant so you're taking\nhormones like estrogen and progesterone\nwhich can lead to things like more minor\nstuff which can be very not Minor by the\nway like bloating or cramps which are\nvery unpleasant and they can eat birth\ncontrol can even do things like cause\nstrokes and blood clots so also PSA if\nyou're on birth control and smoking you\nshould really not be on that combination\nand talk to a doctor about it\ndrastically increases your risk of\nstroke\nand blood clots so birth control there\nare a couple of different kinds if a\nparticular kind of birth control is not\nworking\num you know you can try to take a\ndifferent formulation that has different\nhormonal balances generally speaking uh\noral contraceptive pills are somewhere\nbetween 95 and 98 effective and why is\nthat so why aren't they 100 effective or\n99 effective it's because oftentimes\nhuman beings will forget to take pills\nso there's a certain amount of human\nerror\nbut basically somewhere between two and\nfive percent of people who are in oral\ncontraceptive pills can end up pregnant\nso moving on Beyond oral contraceptive\npills the next thing um which I think is\na really fantastic form of birth control\nis something called an IUD so an IUD is\nan intrauterine device so remember that\nthe egg gets spit spit out gets\nfertilized by a sperm and then that\nembryo has to implant into the wall of\nthe uterus to\ncreate pregnancy\nso what an intrauterine devices is it's\nsomething that is implanted into the\nuterus through the vagina through the\ncervix and into the uterus so it usually\ndoesn't interfere with sex because sex\nis in the vagina okay\nwhat it essentially does is creates a\nminor inflammatory environment or it\nreleases a local hormone like\nprogesterone which is just affects the\nuterus that prevents pregnancy so the\ncool thing about intrauterine devices is\neven though we can use hormonal\ncontraception there aren't systemic\neffects you won't end up with bloating\nor cramping or headaches or other kinds\nof problems because instead of hormones\nflooding all through your body because\nyou're taking a pill right when I take a\npill goes to my stomach distributes all\nthrough my body there's a localized\neffect in the uterus that will prevent\npregnancy\nso the cool thing about iuds is they\ntend to be 99 effective\num and basically they you know it's very\nhard to get pregnant on IUD because\nthey're very well designed and why is it\nquote unquote Superior to oral\ncontraceptive pills it's because you\ndon't have to worry about remembering to\ntake your medication every day you can\nleave an IUD in the uterus for five\nyears or even longer so it's like a you\nknow one-time thing that you can kind of\ndo if you're not planning on getting\npregnant anytime soon you can get it\nchanged out every five years and so it's\nkind of like a good solution if you're\npretty sure you're not going to be\npregnant anytime soon or don't want to\nbe pregnant\nso there are a couple of other methods\nto deliver hormones and essentially and\nhave the same effect as oral\ncontraceptive pills so there are\nhormonal they're both controlled patches\nso this is something that you slap on\nmaybe once a month right so instead of\ntaking a pill every day you can just\nslap on a patch\num and and they work similar to oral\ncontraceptive pills it's hormonal in\nnature they're also shots that you can\nget either monthly or every three months\nthat will also prevent pregnancy you get\na shot sort of does something to your\nhormone levels and there are even things\ncalled other implants where people can\nyou know put a like a little implant\nsubdermally so right under the skin that\nslowly trickles out hormone hormones\nthat will prevent pregnancy\nall three of these things tend to be\ncomparably effective we're probably\ntalking about somewhere around 98\nefficacy and then there's the last form\nof birth control which also tends to be\nsomewhat drastic or permanent which is\nthat you can get a vasectomy if you're a\ndude right so if you're 100 sure that\nyou're done having kids you can get a\nvasectomy and what is a vasectomy so we\nhave our testicles\nand then we have our penis right so what\nhappens is our penis is where the\nejaculate comes from\nand the testicles is where the sperm\ncomes from so somehow the sperm has to\nget from the testicles to the penis and\nit usually does that through these these\ntubes called the vas deferens and if we\nsnip those tubes what happens is the\nsperm can never get to the actual semen\nand so you're shooting blanks so this is\nusually close to a hundred percent\neffective some people will talk about\nvasectomy reversals just FYI vasectomy\nreversals are not very effective so I\nthink there's something like 60\neffective if you do them within a year\nor two so if you wait a couple of years\nafter getting a vasectomy you may not be\nable to have kids naturally okay so it's\nsort of a permanent birth control\nsolution it's a surgical option for men\nfor women there are a couple of\ndifferent things that you can do one is\nin the most drastic cases some women\nwill have hysterectomies usually they\nhave hysterectomy which is a removal of\nthe uterus by the way\num usually for medical reasons so\nsomeone's got like uterine cancer or\nsomething like that you can just remove\nthe whole uterus the other thing that\nyou can do is remember that they're the\novaries and there's the Fallopian tubes\nand the Egg travels down the fallopian\ntube into the uterus you can get your\ntubes tied which is when you sort of\nsever or tie those Fallopian tubes that\nthe egg can never reach the uterus and\ncan never get fertilized that's another\nsurgical option for women\nso these are drastic that are basically\nkind of 100 percent\npermanent sort of things\num methods of birth control\nso hopefully at this point I know I've\ntossed a lot of information at y'all but\nI do think it's really important for men\nto understand female birth control and\nwhy is that it's because most of the\noptions are actually like available to\nwomen right and we as men need to first\nof all not be afraid of the period it's\nnot a terrifying thing and you know\nwomen have them every month and it's not\nit doesn't invoke Satan or anything like\nthat it's just women have periods it's a\nnormal part of their physiology we\nshould also understand as men like a\nlittle bit about things like STIs and\nstuff like that and by the way if you're\na woman and you didn't understand this\nstuff because you grew up in a household\nwhere people didn't want to teach you\nabout birth control fantastic right so\nthat's great too\nso remember that condoms are really the\nonly effective protection against STIs\nthere are some female condom equivalents\nwhich basically don't get used very much\nbut condoms are about 90 effective I\nthink uh IEDs tend to work really really\nwell if you don't want to get pregnant\nfor a long period of time if you are on\na hormonal based birth control is a dude\nyou need to understand that those don't\ncome without side effects so oftentimes\nthe reason that women are reluctant to\ntake birth control is because it makes\nthem feel like crap and so that's\nsomething that is a long-term\nconversation hopefully between you and\nyour partner about condom use and other\nthings like that and most of all I want\nall y'all man woman everything in\nbetween to stay safe and don't get\npregnant unless you want to get pregnant\nso if you've got a uterus or ovaries I\ndon't care what you identify as if\nyou've got a uterus and ovaries in your\nmenstrual if you're ovulating then you\ncan get pregnant right so just remember\nthat so everyone should act accordingly\nand hopefully this information has\nhelped you all to stay sexually safe\nsexually healthy and not wind up with\nunnecessary pregnancies"
