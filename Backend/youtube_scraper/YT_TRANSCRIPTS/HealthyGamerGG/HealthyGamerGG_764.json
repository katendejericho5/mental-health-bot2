    "transcript": "today I want to talk to you all about\nwhat to do if Solutions don't seem to\nwork\nand I've worked with a lot of\na lot of being inside I've tried\neverything and nothing seems to work\nI've tried supplements I've tried\ntherapy I've tried to exercise I've\ntried dating coaches everything that I\ndo doesn't seem to work and I'm truly a\nunique case and there are a lot of\npeople out there who are always looking\nto try something new because there's a\nlot of good stuff out there to try right\nif we kind of look at scientific\nresearch people are researching new\ncompounds and they're like podcasts and\nlife hacking and biohacking and even\npeople like myself who are like oh hey\nyou should try this new thing and so we\nhave so many solutions out there and\nit's getting to the point where even if\nyou tried a bunch of them there's a real\nproblem of okay like what do I try next\nand if you look at it statistically\nthere are 1.8 million research articles\npublished every year and that number is\ngrowing how are you supposed to know\nwhich ones work for you and so this is a\nvery serious problem that a lot of\npeople have and is becoming increasingly\nimportant even in the field of medicine\nso as we have more and more treatments\nand more and more research articles how\ndo you know what's going to work for you\nand this is the challenge with science\nin general which is that if you look at\nscience science is based on populations\nright so if you look at a study on let's\nsay\nomega-3 or fat you know fish oil on\nlet's say depression what they'll do is\nthey'll take a thousand people half of\nthem\nomega-3 and half of them nothing a\ncontrol right and then what they'll\ndiscover is that okay like there was a\n15 Improvement but of the 500 people who\ntook the supplement it's not that every\nsingle person improved by 15 it's that a\nthird of them improved by 70 percent a\nthird of them improved by 30 percent and\nthen a third of them improved by zero\npercent didn't improve at all and this\nis what science does so science is about\nthe law of averages and so then\nindividuals are left with a serious\nproblem is how do I know which science\nis going to work for me and this is\nprecisely why we have clinicians because\nsometimes you need another human being\nto tailor science to your particular\nperspective right to your particular\ngenetics your particular upbringing your\nparticular physiology and so then the\nquestion kind of becomes how do we\nnavigate this problem and so what I'm\ngoing to love what I'd love to do today\nis share with you all a particular\ntechnique that is very very effective if\nSolutions haven't worked for you so far\nhey there thanks for watching and I'm\nglad these videos have been helpful a\nlot of times I'll read the comments and\nsee people asking well what do I\nactually do about it which is such a\ngreat question and unfortunately my\nexperience has been that the resources\nout there aren't actually that good at\nhelping people create sustainable change\nwhich is why I started HG in the first\nplace he coaches are trained on a\ncurriculum that integrates all of my\nunderstanding into what is motivation\nwhat paralyzes Us and how to create\nlasting behavioral change so if you're\nready to take the next step he coaches\nare ready to build the life that you\nwant they've helped people build careers\nfind relationships build networks of\nfriends discover what their passions are\nand pursue their Hobbies so if this\nsounds like something that you'd be\ninterested it and check out the link in\nthe description below and so what I'd\nlove to do is share with you all the\ntechnique that I kind of stumbled into\nthat day but I think is actually better\nIllustrated\num through the people who sort of\ndiscovered it more formally so there's\nthis tested shift to take to get into\nmed school called The Medical College\nadmissions test at least in the United\nStates and when I was studying for it\nI'd sort of hit a plateau I was kind of\nin the top 20 to 25 percent and I kept\non trying to figure out okay what am I\ndoing wrong what am I doing wrong what\nam I doing wrong and despite the fact\nthat I kept on looking at my problems\nand trying to find Solutions trying to\nfind Solutions it just wasn't working\nand then I kind of had this really\nbizarre idea that seemed a little bit\nunusual and I kind of leaned into that\nand I found that surprisingly once I\nemployed this technique or this\nmethodology I actually bumped up quite a\nbit so in order to understand this\ntechnique I'm actually going to go to\nthe original researchers who really sort\nof fleshed out this technique and this\nstory actually starts in France with two\nPhysicians so these Physicians were\nfocused on public health specifically\nmalnourishment and they'd been\ncontracted by the country of Vietnam to\nimprove malnourished children in rural\nVietnam and they had a huge\nmalnourishment problem over 50 percent\nof kids in this rural section of Vietnam\nwere malnourished and weren't getting\nenough food so these Physicians did what\nany good Physicians do who are out there\nto save the world right they said okay\nwell like we will comment we will come\nnourish your children because how do you\nfix malnourishment right so what do you\ndo if kids are malnourished you feed\nthem it's not that complicated so they\nshow up in Vietnam and the government\nhas promised them all kinds of stuff\nyeah we're going to give you this amount\nof food Aid We're going to give you this\namount of money things like that so they\nshow up there they've taken actually a\none-year break from their day jobs to\ncome and solve world hunger in this\nrural corner of Vietnam and the\ngovernment actually tells them you know\nwhat we're incredibly sorry but um all\nthat stuff we promised you none of it's\nhere maybe corruption maybe we over\npromised who knows what happened here's\nwhat we can give you we can give you a\ntranslator a van and some accommodation\nplease fix the problem and so these two\ndoctors are like well how are we\nsupposed to solve malnourishment without\nany food and the government was like\nplease please please try do what you can\nyou've come all this way and then the\ndoctors were like well we've like\ndedicated a year to this project and now\nall the food Aid is going let's see what\nwe can do so they went and they they\ntook their van and they took their\ndriver and they kind of drove around for\na while and they started exploring this\npart of Vietnam and then one of them\nkind of had a really interesting\nRevelation which is well hold on a\nsecond like all these people are poor\nright they're all like rice Farmers\nthat's what like most of them do for\ntheir job and it's not like some of them\nare super rich or have access to great\nfood they're actually all in the same\nsituation they're all rice farmers and\nso one of the the docs basically asked\nthis question why isn't the\nmalnourishment 100 right why doesn't why\ndoesn't everyone have malnourished kids\neveryone's poor everyone's a rice farmer\nbut half of the kids are not\nmalnourished and so they started looking\ninto not the problem they looked into\nthe people who don't have the problem\nand what they essentially discovered was\nsomething really interesting that of the\nthe the parents of the children who were\nhealthy had a couple of behaviors which\nthe other parents didn't one is anytime\nthey were out weeding in the rice field\nthey would see some kinds of like\nCrustaceans like little shrimps clams\nthings like that right because it's like\nrice paddies there's lots of water so\nthere's like little crustacean shrimps\nand stuff growing in there they have an\napron literally this is their solution\nand anytime they saw shrimp they'd scoop\nit up and stick it in the apron so they\nsaw a clam or muscle or of any kind they\njust scoop it up and stick it in the\napron the other thing that those parents\ndid is that there are certain weeds so\nweeds from a rice field perspective\nwhich are actually very nutritious but\nare considered Poor People's food so a\ngood example of this in the United\nStates is something like mustard greens\nif y'all are familiar with that so these\nvegetables are really really cheap\nreally good for you taste a little bit\nmaybe not as tasty not as sweet whatever\nand they're generally eaten by people\nwho are of low socioeconomic status so\nmustard greens which and collard greens\nare another good example are very like\nfibrous right so collard greens taste\ndelicious if you make them right but\nthey were traditionally eaten by\nAfricans and slaves so they're\nconsidered poor people food so similarly\nthere were some greens that were viewed\nas poor people food which half of the\nfamilies would not eat they just weed\nand throw away but the other half\nrealized oh these are edible and\nnutritious I'm actually going to eat\nthem and and we're going to cook them\nand what these researchers essentially\ndiscovered is that the reason that half\nthese people are are not malnourished is\nbecause they do these two things and so\nthey stumbled on something that they\ncalled positive deviance which is this\nidea that when there's a problem you\ndon't actually have to go looking for a\nsolution a solution already exists and\nall you have to do is duplicate it and\nso this was kind of a radical and\nrevolutionary idea because what they\nactually ended up doing is implementing\nsome behavioral changes and they\nactually fixed the problem of\nmalnourishment without a single dollar\nworth of food Aid and so even going back\nto when I was studying what I sort of\ndiscovered was I started to ask myself\nhold on a second I keep on focusing on\nthe problems that I got wrong but I'm\nnot asking the questions why do I get\nmost of these questions right what is\ngoing on in my mind that leads to the\nright answer as opposed to just focusing\non what leads to the wrong answer and\nwhat I actually discovered was something\nreally interesting which is that when I\nwhen I took the test depending on my\nframe of mind depending on whether I was\npaying attention in a particular way\nthat's what led to the right answers\nwith hard questions sometimes and\ninstead of focusing on studying physics\nor biology or chemistry like over and\nover and over again oh I missed this\nquestion that must mean that I need to\ngo back and read the chapter on\nchemistry instead what I did is sort of\nApplied positive deviance and that's uh\nsituation of studying and I kind of like\nactually boosted my score a ton so we're\ngoing to talk a little bit more about\npositive deviance and basically what\npositive deviance suggests is that you\nactually don't need any solutions and\nthe right way to improve your life is to\nnot fix your problems and this is\nsomething that is especially ineffective\nfor people who have tried a lot of stuff\nto fix their problems and I know it\nsounds kind of bizarre but how can I\nimprove my life if I don't fix my\nproblems it's it's a subtlety but it's\nactually really important which is that\nwhat you need to do is apply positive\ndeviance to your own life and\npractically what that means is don't\nfocus on the days that you screw up try\nto duplicate or understand the days that\nyou did really well and so I'll give you\nall just an example of like people come\nto me and say hey I have trouble\nstudying right please evaluate me for\nADHD give me medication and then I'll\nask them a simple question I'll ask them\nokay so like do you can you never study\nand the answer is never no yes I can\nnever study I cannot study a single day\nthe answer that I always get is yeah\nlike maybe like one day out of 15 I do a\ngood job studying and if you're\nlistening to this video you know that's\ntrue too you know that there are times\nin your life where you actually do a\nreally good job and then you ask\nyourself why can't I be like this every\nday right there's one day that you're\nsuper focused you get everything done on\ntime you wake up in the morning you\nstudy for three hours you do all your\nwork for the day and then you're free\nfor the rest of the day it feels\ndeliberating feels so good and then the\nnext day you stumble you get distracted\nand then you ask yourself okay how do I\nstop this distraction how do I fix that\nproblem and what positive deviance\nessentially does is it doesn't focus on\nthe problems it focuses on the solutions\nso what positive deviance is all about\nis take that one day that you did do a\ngood job and as ask yourself what are\nthe factors that lead to this success\ninstead of focusing on all the stuff\nthat knocks you off your game try to\nduplicate that which puts you on your\ngame so practically how do you do that\nit starts with this so if you have a\nproblem start by asking yourself okay\nwhat is one case in which this problem\nwas not applicable right so start don't\nworry about the problem itself ask\nyourself okay what's like one good what\nwhat's one situation where I was able to\nstudy what's one situation where I did\nmake a friend what's one situation where\nI was able to set a boundary with\nsomeone right you can be whatever you\nwhat's one day that I was able to\nexercise what's one day that I was able\nto eat healthy what's one day that I ate\na sandwich instead of fried chicken or a\nsalad instead of a sandwich because each\nand every human being has some successes\nin their life and what positive deviance\nthen does is the problem is that you can\nget a generic answer from an expert\nwho's a scientist or look at research\nstudy but the Apple application of that\nresearch study isn't going to be a\nhundred percent because they weren't\nresearching you all the scientific\nliterature out there is not about you\nit's about the average person and so\nwhen you translate stuff from the\naverage person to an individual there is\nsomething that's lost in efficiency so\nhow do you get that efficiency back you\nlook at your life and you look at your\nSolutions you look at your successes\nthis is the principle of positive\ndeviance so more practically start by\nlooking at the days that you actually\ndid really well and don't worry that\nit's only one percent of the time or two\npercent of the time or three percent of\nthe time because what we're going to do\nis duplicate the successes instead of\ntrying to fix the failures that's the\nthe key of positive deviance so the\nsecond question you should ask yourself\nis okay what was going on in the 24\nhours prior to this success so if you\nwhatever your target is let's take\nexercise for example oh I woke up one\nmorning and I exercised right and then\nwhat everyone tries to fix is oh I'm\nlazy how do I stop being lazy forget\nabout being lazy how are you not lazy\nthat morning right because this is what\npositive deviance suggests is that the\nanswer is already there you don't need\nto come up with a solution that already\nexists and just like the these people\nwho were trying to solve nourishment in\nVietnam they were trying to fix the\nproblem with 50 of the kids and instead\nof what they discovered is hey 50 of\npeople are doing it right we just need\nto duplicate that and so as you look at\nthe success that you have let's say you\nexercised one morning look at when did\nyou go to bed the night before what did\nyou eat the day before you know what was\non your mind were you stressed out did\nyou play video games and look at all of\nthe factors that led to that success so\nusually what we want to do is a\nqualitative analysis on our positive\ndeviance so there's the average and then\nthere's the deviation that's negative\nwhich is below average and there's the\ndeviation that's above average that's\nwhat we want to focus on then we want to\nask ourselves why and so try to look at\nas many factors as you can so stressors\nsleep diet you know what you did the day\nbefore and see what led to that success\nthen what we want to do is develop a\nhypothesis and try to duplicate those\nthings again so instead of focusing on\nokay I need to exercise in the morning\nthat's not the Target that you need to\nshoot for what you need to shoot for is\nI need to make sure that I do not talk\nto my friends and log on to Discord\nafter 8 pm at night that's the actual\nthing that I need to focus on because if\nI can do that then I'll wake up the next\nday I'll feel really good and then I\nwill actually be able to exercise so it\nshifts our Target and then you may say\nbut okay but how do I but that's really\nhard for me or like going to bed on the\nnight before is really hard then you can\ndo a positive deviant study on that too\nwhat are the times when you've gone to\nbed on time what were the factors that\nallowed you to go to bed on time so you\nwant to do a qualitative analysis\ndevelop a hypothesis and then ideally\nshift your Target and focus on that\nand what you'll discover if you kind of\ndo this process it's it's an iterative\nprocess so you try it you see how it\ngoes maybe it improves your success a\nlittle bit more and if it improves your\nsuccess a little bit more then you ask\nyourself the question okay how was I\nable to be successful this time what\nelse did I miss if you get something\nwrong you kind of go back to the drawing\nboard and you can do a second\nqualitative analysis you ask yourself\nokay what could I be missing or you just\ncontinue living your life and this is\nthe other big part of positive deviance\nis that it's not just about fixing a\nparticular problem now what I want you\nall to do if you really want to\nimplement positive deviance in your life\nis pay attention going forward this is\nreally important right so as you go\nabout your day you will naturally have\nsome successes and this time though as\nyou have some successes instead of just\nthinking man I wish I could do this\nevery single day and getting frustrated\nwith yourself by having a failure\ntomorrow you're going to pay attention\nto every aspect of the success take\nnotes generate hypotheses think about\nwhat actually worked for you because\nwhat positive deviance actually tells us\nis that if you want to fix your problem\nyou shouldn't focus on finding a\nsolution to the problem you should\nactually duplicate those few times that\nyou actually did do a good job and then\nas you start to implement those changes\nyou'll discover something very very\ninteresting which is that fixing the\nproblems that feel unsolvable are\nactually way easier than you ever\nanticipated and you don't need to ask\nanyone else for help because you've\nactually fixed them in the past there\nhave been some successes in the past and\nall you need to do is duplicate them\nforeign"
