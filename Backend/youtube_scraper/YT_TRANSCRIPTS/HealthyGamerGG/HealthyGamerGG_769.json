    "transcript": "because I feel like when a guy is scared\nto speak to me because I'm a girl and\nhe's attracted to me and he's scared of\nrejection I don't know anything about\nhim I've never met him or spoke to him\nhe's working up the courage across the\nroom what he's done is he doesn't know\nme he doesn't like me he's looked at me\nthat's it that's all he knows what my\nbody looks like and now he's scared he\nwon't get what he wants thank you so\nmuch for staying up late I know you're\nin EU time and um but I love it I'm a\nnight owl it's it's absolutely fine I'll\nbe up till like 6 a.m okay\num but I'd love to just get your\nthoughts about everything that's going\non with like deep fakes and you know if\nyou have any perspective to add\num\noh I I how much time have you got I I\nfeel like I have so much to say it's\nit's a really hard thing to Broach\nbecause I feel like most of the people\nwho are watching right now\num like as in onlookers to the whole\ndrama from start to finish I I feel like\nthere is a distinct lack of empathy and\nthat a lot of people cannot actually\nvisualize what about this is so painful\nand damaging and so I'm seeing that\nwe're being met with a lot of confusion\nas to like what's the harm why do you\ncare this just comes with the territory\nthese sorts of remarks and uh it's it's\nreally difficult to articulate and\nunfortunately a lot of I'd say like I'm\nstruggling to find a single woman\nwho hasn't been assaulted or had some\nreally heavily traumatizing experience\nwith a man and one of the symptoms of\nhaving experience with that sort of\nthing is being numbed being\noverwhelmingly numb or disassociating\nwhen things like this happen and it's\nreally really hard when everyone's\ntrying to get you to explain what's so\ndamaging about it to get in touch with\nthose feelings in the immediate\naftermath of finding out that it's\nhappening and I think that's probably\nsomething that quite a lot of us have in\ncommon you've experienced this whether\nwe're streamers or not is that when\nyou're immediately asked to justify why\nyou're hurt at a time where you're most\nlikely to be very numb and\nstruggle the most to articulate how\nyou're feeling\nthat that's a fascinating point I mean\nbecause my first question just as you\nstarted talking like the first question\nthat popped into my mind is how is it\ndamaging so I have no doubt that it's\ndamaging I've seen overwhelming research\nand I've worked with some people who\nhave had who have been in non-consensual\npornography situations but can I mean is\nit okay if I ask you like are you able\nto provide some insight\nI mean I feel like\nwhen I first sawed a pornography that\nwas made out of someone's likeness it\nwas Anita sarkeesian and she made a\nseries called feminist frequency and a\npopular stream I disliked her so he\nbasically immobilized his entire\nviewership against her and she just\nreviewed computer games and people\nstarted photoshopping her face onto\npornography and specifically sex acts\nthat were considered degrading\num to mock her the first instance I had\nof this was not someone who's lonely and\nparasocial wanting to masturbate over\nsomeone that they are emotionally\nconnected to my first experience of this\nmy first knowledge of existing was as a\nweapon to humiliate and degrade women\nso I've only ever known it as an attack\nI've never really like this is the first\ntime I've ever seen it or heard it\ndescribed in a parasocial sense and\nobviously I understand it like I already\nI explained it to my audience as well I\nwas like I'm pretty sure that we have a\nsaturated Market of boobs and that you\ncan see boobs whenever you like for free\non the internet\num but what people crave and what's much\nrarer is intimacy yeah and so when you\npick someone like your boss to get deep\nfaked and people submit pictures of\ntheir bosses to deep fake and their\nfriends and family like these are the\nkinds of things that deep fake markets\nplay into and a lot of the paid\ntransactions happen for\num so I get it I understand that these\nare people who want a sense of some\nsemblance of connection and it's a\npseudo collection connection it's not\nreal but at the same time I'm very very\nvery aware that there is a mix of\ndominance and humiliation gym tied into\nthis but these people are expressing a\ndesire to dominate and humiliate me and\neven the people who pretend that they\ndon't get it and go I don't understand\nwhat's the harm it's just a cartoon it's\nnot real\num a lot of Studies have shown that if\nyou get a person if you get man and make\nhim play computer games and he's playing\nagainst another player who he can't see\nor interact with if they give that\nperson a male Avatar and he beats that\nperson or he gets beaten by that person\nthat that male Avatar out does him\nhe will be given a chance to adjust the\nAvatar of the opposite player after\nbeing beaten and if it's a male\ncharacter they don't add anything sexual\nto the Avatar but if it's a female\ncharacter and that character beats them\nthey'll add sexual attributes to their\nAvatar to Mock and ridicule them and\ntake them down a peg\num there's a huge desire for porn of\nlots of different body types not just\nthe stereotypical Beauty standard\nanymore because people are out there\nlooking for someone who looks like their\nneighbor or someone they know personally\nand there's a huge appetite for porn\nwhere an employee humiliates their boss\nby sexualizing her and you know by you\nknow so like I I feel like on some level\neven if it's unconscious a lot of the\npeople who pretend they don't know why\nit's weird or upsetting\num would do this unconsciously would\nrespond to being dominated by a female\nor outperformed by a female by doing\nthis and a lot of the studies tried to\nfind like the same behavior in women\ntowards men and it isn't there generally\nspeaking most women will not sexualize a\nman who's who's outdone them or\nhumiliated them or overpowered them or\nis like in a higher position at work so\nI I don't I I find it serious I question\nwhether people genuinely don't get it or\nwhether it's just a gas light I just I I\nI I I I have as I'm suspicious of people\nwho pretend they don't understand what's\nwrong with this\nso I can maybe offer some explanation\nthere because\nso on the one hand I I take things at\nface value but I could not I had a lot\nof trouble empathizing\nwith\num\npeople who have been in this scenario so\nlike if I it's taken a long time for me\nto learn to just accept if people are\nhurt that they're hurt\nbut I think a big part of\nwhy it could be hard for men to\nunderstand this is because\nwe may not respond the same way or We\nBelieve\nwe may not respond the same way simply\nbecause we have not experienced a sexual\nobjectification\nso I put I try to put myself in this\nperson's shoes and I ask myself hey if\nthere was a picture of my genitals on\nthe internet like how much would it\nbother me\nand and even amongst men like you know\nthe pictures of genitals are freely\nadvertised\nright like sometimes we'll send them to\npeople because pictures of our genitals\nbeing out in the public is not something\nthat would bother us\nI'm saying Us in general not but and so\nI I do Wonder so it's really interesting\nto hear you say I mean I do think that\nthere are a lot of people who\nprobably understand on some level it's\nharmful and just don't care\nbut I it's kind of like almost leaning\ninto what you said is that men don't\nget objectified quite as much and\ntherefore we may not understand what the\nharm is if we haven't experienced it\nourselves\nuh I mean one of the ways that I have\nbecause I've experienced that too that\ndisconnect and it's that if I posted\npictures of my genitals on the internet\nand it spread people would change their\nbehavior towards me significantly the\nminute that I seem sexually available in\nany way shape or form I'm fair game to\nhumiliate physically assault rape and\nattack\num and this happens to porn stars there\nare many porn stars who get murdered on\ntheir doorstep because a fan of their\nwork will think that they're easy and\nthat they will just sleep with anyone so\nthey'll turn up and go hey I'm here you\nshould sleep with me and they'll be like\nwho are you get off my land and they'll\nbe like how dare you you're a [ __ ]\nyou'd sleep with anyone so why are you\nturning me down what I'm not good enough\nfor you I'm better than all those men\nyou've slept with and you'll sleep with\nanyone how dare you insult me like this\nand then they murder them and that's\nhappened to so much that exact scenarios\nhappen to many many sex workers and so\nthere's this idea that the minute you\nare consensually sexual everyone can\nhelp themselves to you and I've\nexperienced this and I've seen it and\nI've seen it happen to other people\num there are\nthere are so many ways I could describe\nthe way it changes the treatment of you\nand the consequences\num can you tell me a little bit about\nthat\nthere was a woman who had\num she was coming with someone so she\nwas doing something sexual on the screen\nfor this person they recorded it and\nleaked it and it ended up on a revenge\nporn website and lots of people saw it\nand all her friends were messaging her\ngoing have you seen this she begged them\nto take it down they did not she had two\nchildren and the Deep fake it wasn't a\ndeep fake it was just revenge porn but\nit was used against her in court to say\nthat she was not a fit mother\nand so because someone leaked that\nfootage without her consent she lost\ncustody of her children\nyeah um\nthat it's also used against women in\nrape cases so if you get raped police\nwill spend months doing a back to ground\ncheck on you and decide whether or not\nyou could have ever possibly been raped\nbecause if you've had too much sex\num you're obviously consent there's no\nway you couldn't have consented\nso people will decide whether they\nbelieve you when you report a rape or a\nsexual assault based on your sexual\nhistory and if you have any sexual\ncontent out there of any kind you'll be\nconsidered a [ __ ] if you once had a\nstint of doing only fans or whatever to\nmake ends meet and then you start to be\na teacher and you train for years and\nyears to be a teacher you can be fired\nas a teacher because you once had a\ncareer in only fun so there's this idea\nthat once you're a sexual person is a\nwoman like maybe if you had a picture of\nyour genitals out there nothing would\nchange no one would care in fact the\nrevenge porn websites that were\nreleasing and keeping all of these\npictures would quite often Target\nmusicians and show pictures of their\ngenitalia and nobody nobody changed\ntheir behavior towards these rock stars\nand these males who were on the site it\nwas purely the women who had physical\nconsequences who were fired who were\nstalked you had dreams of men because it\ndidn't just leak the\nthe Revenge pawn it leaked to your\ndetails as well that go Oh Yeah from\nhere I was looking at some research that\nshowed that 50 of things that are\nuploaded to revenge porn websites\nhave names and locations attached to\nthem right this is an older study so\nthis study's like five years old but\num and and so it's like the revenge porn\ncomes with the doxing which is\nterrifying\nyeah\nyeah so like that that if I saw a\npicture of someone's dick and was given\nthen their address and their number\nthere is no part of me that would want\nto go ring them up and go hello I saw\nyour dick but for some reason when we do\nthat with women there are lots and lots\nof men who will dog pile on that and go\nha and then immediately start harassing\nher just because I've seen her naked and\nthey now have her details and so like\nwhat's your understanding of like why\npeople may think that that's okay\nwe stigmatize female sexuality as a flaw\nwith them\nokay\num I think we stigmatize female\nsexuality quite a lot so\num men can gain status from sex but\nwomen lose it\num and it's even defined to how we treat\nwomen medically our understanding of\ntheir sex\num so help me understand that last\nstatement what do you mean by it affects\nhow we Define people medically\nthere are loads of ways in which we\npressure women and their Lifestyles like\nI constantly am being told\num I will run out of eggs and I will\nregret my entire existence if I don't\nlower my standards and get with a man\nnow like I have people who are up in my\nchat and say what are you doing with\nyour life stop [ __ ] around in front\nof the camera you need to find a husband\nbefore you're too old and left on the\nShelf because you've produced all of\nyour eggs and you're at the end where\nyou won't be able to produce anymore and\nyou won't be able to have kids and\nyou'll die alone and you should panic\nbecause this is your entire Worth right\nand we found out very very recently\num through chemotherapy the the idea\nthat women produce all of their eggs in\nthe womb and then that's it that's all\nthey have is a myth because there were\npeople who were supposed to be rendered\ninfertile by radiation\num\nand the eggs are actually recovered and\nthey produced more eggs after the\nradiation therapy after the chemotherapy\nand this was a revelation women can\nproduce more eggs what and yet we've\nbeen using this pseudo fact that we\nassumed without any further research I\nmean I'm pretty sure this could have\nbeen very easily found out I'm pretty\nsure this could have been found out much\nearlier but every woman who goes through\nchemo has been told when we do this to\nyou you won't be able to have kids you\nknow and so like I am being pressured\nand have felt this pressure my whole\nlife to change my mind about not wanting\nchildren because it's been considered a\nbiological fact that I will run out of\neggs and things like this so I have to\ngo and find a man and I have to be loyal\nto him now and so like there are lots of\nbiological facts and medical facts that\naren't actually true about a woman's\nbody like the idea that your vagina gets\nloose if you have too much sex and then\nyou'll be all too used up and no man\nwill want you and like these things are\nbeing presented as medical facts I'm\nbeing told female can't pair bond if\nthey have too many sexual partners so I\nwon't be desirable unless they settle\ndown with one man like these things are\nbeing used against me and then used to\nsay that I'm used up or somehow less of\na woman or less worthy and so like it\nties into like our medical understanding\nof human beings and we use that as if\nit's fact to justify mistreating women\nsaying they're used up saying that\nthey're leftovers so I I'm gonna can I\njust add a couple of things to that\nadd some maybe push back a little bit\num so the first is that\nthis idea that having sex with different\npenises\nloosens the vagina is like let me just\nit's patently false right so there's\nthis like there's a very simple\nexperiment like if I eat big big burgers\nand I eat lots of different food it's\nnot like my face ends up like if I've\ntaken big bites all the time it's not\nlike my face is like wobbly afterward\nright I can take as many big bites as I\nwant to for burgers and hot dogs and\nsalads and sandwiches and it's not like\nmy face is loose and it can't like chew\nfood like it's just not\nI I have no idea where this comes from\nit's not when you say it's like\nwe use no that's not biologically\naccurate it and I don't understand what\nthe biological differences between\nhaving sex with a lot of different\npenises and one penis over and over and\nover again like that's physiologically\nthe same thing\nyeah right like there's no\nand so some of that stuff is just false\nI think that what I what I tend to see\nis that for a lot of discussions around\nthis stuff like people's understanding\nof medicine and biology is very wrong\nso so that you're you know you're kind\nof like too old and stuff like that from\nfrom the medical standpoint I'm not\nactually so surprised that for a long\ntime\nwe believed what we believed in medicine\nI think that's actually still largely\ntrue because the chemotherapy makes me\nthink probably what happened is you're\ngiving someone chemotherapy first and\nthen you're giving them another agent\nafterward which stimulates stem cell\nproduction\nand if you artificially stimulate stem\ncell project this is my sense if you\nartificially\nstimulate cell stem cell production with\na certain medication you may be able to\nmake new uh eggs that makes actually\nperfect sense that that could happen but\nI wouldn't go as far as to say that our\nmedical I mean our medical establishment\nmay have been wrong but I think there's\na lot of data to support that\na lot of the ooh Genesis or egg\ndevelopment happens actually before\nbirth\num but say that we become like that we\nonly have a short period of time to have\nkids has been used against women to\npressure them and there are whole\ncultures that call women on the shelf or\nleftovers after 25 based on the idea\nthat they're at their most fertile when\nthey're young oh and it's been a\njustification to molest young women who\naren't you know fully developed in under\nthe guise of saying I'm getting everyone\nshe's most fertile it's natural so I do\nthink that medically we deliberately\nmisunderstand how women's bodies work in\norder to justify assaulting them\ndegrading them and considering them\nlesser I think that's well documented\nyeah so I I would just I think there's a\nNuance there I'm not disputing at all\nthat people will use biology to justify\nnegative or harmful actions\nI just think that these are incorrect\nbiological assumptions or they're being\nco-opted for like poor purposes so even\nif there's a certain window in which\nwomen can get pregnant\nwhich I think we sort of biologically\nunderstand that that's true that there's\nsomething called menopause after which\nit's very hard for a woman to get\npregnant and there's something called\npuberty before which it's very hard for\na girl to get pregnant\nthe biological facts and using\nbiological facts for justification are\ntwo completely separate things in my\nmind and in my experience a lot of the\npeople who are using biology to justify\nsomething actually don't understand\nbiology just like this penis thing like\nit makes no biological sense\nlike there's no date like where is that\ncoming from\nyou know it doesn't it doesn't make any\nsense and so even people who say that oh\nlike women are at their maximal fertile\nthat may be a biologically true fact\nbut that doesn't justify any kind of\nbehavior or the value judgment that we\nplace on it is like completely different\nin my mind and and that that's where\nmaybe we agree to disagree but like\nI'm not disagreeing that people will use\nbiology and but it's my experience that\nmost of the time when I hear people\nsaying [ __ ] like that they actually have\nno idea what they're talking about they\nactually have the biology like very\nwrong\neven if they're justifying it for\nwhatever it's just that they just have\nno clue like they don't actually\nunderstand biology\nI I don't know we got regardless of like\nbecause I can give you a long history of\nlike medically what's happened to women\nbecause of the stigma towards whatever\nbut I think it's beside the point I\nthink like the main thing is that I feel\nlike the reason why you having a dick\npic leaked and me having like any lewd\npictures leaked the reason why we'd have\ndifferent set of consequences and why\nthat might be a disconnect\num is both social and personal and that\nis that a lot of women have personal\nexperience of being dehumanized\nmistreated and being put in danger the\nminute people consider them to have a\nsexuality\num and this is really emphasized in sex\nworkers who quite often been missing or\nget murdered all the time and nobody\ncares about them because they're [ __ ]\nlike it's very rare that it's ever\ninvestigated when a sex worker gets\nmurdered by her clients for example they\ndisappear no one looks no one cares\num and the you know know this whole idea\nof a pure victim changes how whether or\nnot people believe someone who has been\nassaulted whereas like someone who's had\nsex a thousand times with a thousand\ndifferent men could still say no to one\nof them and end up being raped and yet\nit's still used as evidence in court as\nto decide whether or not a woman has\nbeen raped or not is her sexual history\nthings like this so I think like there's\nthat aspect and then the overarching\nsocial aspect that people don't really\nconsider is that\nmen are not often considered sexual\nbeings and they do not have their\nsexuality positively acknowledged so\num for example they're rarely ever\ncalled Beautiful the rarely ever admired\nfor their sexuality and the way that\nwomen are so women are hypersexualized\nand men are under-sexualized and so when\nwomen get hypersexualized and it's a\ndanger to their safety and it feels\ndegrading and terrifying a lot of men\ncan't empathize because they picture\nthemselves being lusted after by lots of\nwomen and they'd love that they'd love\nto be sexually acknowledged and so like\nand for women they're like I wish it\nwould stop I would give anything for it\nto stop so when men complain about not\nbeing sexualized and not having their\nsexuality acknowledge being turned down\nfor sex by their wives\num not being called Beautiful\nremembering compliments for years\nbecause it happens so [ __ ] rarely the\nwomen are like why would I sympathize\nwith you that sounds like heaven like\nyeah and so\nthat's it's it's really hard to\nempathize with the opposite position\nbecause there's a certain level of Envy\nlike there's a set like inv men who can\ngo unacknowledged and be invisible on a\ncasual walk on a summer's day whereas I\nhave to weigh up do I want to be baking\nhot and sweaty and uncomfortable or do I\nwant to be in danger because those are\nmy two choices and so I I feel like that\nthat's an aspect of why this is\nhappening in front of mainly a male\naudience and they have no idea how to\nempathize I think that's that's a really\ncool way of framing it and Anita like\ncan I just Echo what you said\nso I\nit's it's such a good point that women\nare hyper sexual uh sexualized or I\nwould say\neven my experience has been it's not\njust sexualization but appearance and\ncompliments women are judged based on\ntheir appearance even if it's not sexual\nso sexuality is a certainly they're\nhypersexualized\nand I've met so many men that and now\nit's kind of clicking for me like a\ncouple things after hearing what you\nwere saying one is that I've met so many\nmen that do remember a single kind thing\nthat was told to them years ago like\nthey don't get compliments\num I remember my own experience of\nstarting to receive compliments at some\npoint in my life and being really really\nconfused and thinking that people were\nmaking fun of me because I had grown up\nto be\nat best ignored and generally speaking\nridiculed or insulted for my physical\nappearance and so it was really\nconfusing for me at the beginning\nand then the other really interesting\nthing just the kind of thinking about\nhow different our experiences are so on\nthe one hand men are sending dick pics\nand I'm not saying all men you know so I\nthink a lot of us are decent men out\nthere are sending dick pics unsolicited\nto women\nand on the flip side they're paying for\nboobs\nright so the idea that like if a\nthousand women started sending me boobs\ntomorrow\num a lot of men may think that that's\nthat they would like that kind of thing\nand and this is where I have worked with\nsome men who have been sexualized and\nthis is where like\nthey learn real quick that it's not the\ngrass is greener kind of thing that they\nwere thinking in fact it's very\ndegrading\num and just just like it is for women\nand so interestingly enough the the men\nthat I've worked with that tend to be\nhypersexualized\nreally really hate it and they basically\nwill have experiences that are very\nsimilar to women\nnow that's that's a really interesting\npoint about the lack of compliments and\nhow we we treat people that's\ngreat helps me understand\nthe way that I've bridged the Gap from\nmy male friends who don't quite\nunderstand and don't empathize with me\nis I go stop imagining loads of women\ndoing this to you imagine men doing this\nto you imagine going into a prison and\nhaving to work there and all the men\nthere maybe most of them weren't done\nfor rape or anything sexual but you\ndon't know which ones have been done for\nsomething that's at all and they're all\nlooking you up and down and licking\ntheir lips and wolf whistling at you and\ngoing come on sweetheart come closer to\nthe bars I won't bite and you have to\nendure that every single day and work\naround them and not know what's going to\nhappen to you that's what we're\nexperiencing you were imagining loads of\nwomen fawning over you complimenting you\nbeing desperate to sleep with you no\nwe're dealing with the prison scenario\nthat's imagine that and then they get it\nthen it clicks if they deal if they\nimagine having to deal with mail lust\nthey suddenly understand the discomfort\nso much better yeah I I think it's the\nthe huge point there it's I think it's a\nbrilliant uh analogy is a big part of it\nis like do you want this sexual\nattention and the whole challenge that a\nlot of women face in some men too is\nthat they don't want the sexual\nattention they don't want to be\nsexualized I'm not interested in a\nsexual relationship with you the\nscenario is not imagine that people are\nlusting after you that you are lusting\nafter that's not the scenario the\nscenario is Imagine people are lusting\nafter you that you are not interested in\nyeah\num\nyeah that's this is very enlightening\nthank you so much for sharing all this\nstuff Anita\nthank you for having me I think like the\nthe thing that I've noticed is that this\nhas been going on for so long but\nnobody's ever taken it seriously or ever\ncared and like I said a lot of it's been\nused to attack people that you dislike\nboth male and female\num usually watching someone get shafted\nwas a way to humiliate them we even draw\ncaricatures of politicians\num being in sexually degrading\nsituations in order to humiliate them as\nan expression of hatred for them and so\nlike historically since this whole thing\nhas begun it's been a way to humiliate\nand debase and kind of degrade someone's\npopularity and things like this I mean\none of the earliest examples I can think\nof is in the medieval times there was an\noutbreak of people persecuting witches\nand burning witches and they used to use\npaintings they made caricatures of women\nkissing the ass of the devil or licking\nthe ass of the devil so there are\nactually medieval paintings of like\nanalingus as a way to say like witches\nare evil they're terrible people they\nsuck up to the devil you should hate\nthem you should find them we should burn\nthem like as far back as I can think\nwhen it's drawing people in sexually\ncompromising positions has not just been\na fantasy it's specifically been a way\nto justify harming women it has been\nsomething that we've ubiquitously\nthroughout history used as a humiliation\ntactic and so like I I find it really\nstrange when people then do that for\nhundreds of years to the point where\nsuch an established thing came out of\ntime I've seen Trump being done in the\nass by Putin as a caricature by so many\ndifferent artists\nlike\nhow do people not know what this means\nto the artists and what their intentions\nare towards the esteem and like the\nsocial standing and everything of the\nsubject matter like this is a thing that\nhas existed for so long but also we\npredicted it into the future like I've\nrecently tweeted about how\nStar Trek and Deep Space Nine had a\nhollow deck where you could simulate\nrealities and how some of the characters\ngot in trouble in various situations for\nsimulating people they knew and putting\nthem in sexual positions I've seen those\nepisodes TNG right yeah yeah and deep\nDeep Space Nine like they did a really\ngood episode on it where\num the Ferengi who were known to be\nheavily misogynistic\num there was a client who wanted a\nHolodeck simulation to sleep with Kira\nand\num so he's stalking Kira trying to get\ngood pictures of her face so he can\ntranspose it onto like a model to sleep\nwith in the Holodeck and he finally gets\nall together they clock onto what he's\ndoing so they replace it they if they\nchange it before he sells it so that\nit's his face on a female model so that\nwhen the client goes in and opens the\ncurtain he thinks he's going to sleep\nwith a simulation of Kira he sees a\nsimulation of a woman with a Ferengi\nhead\num and so like that in that in that\nsituation they wrote that whole\nsituation for her to be angry and she\ndoes she attacks Quark for this and like\nthey empathize with her they know it's\nhumiliating the whole situation is set\nup to say like he's trying to stalk and\nhumiliate her for his own prophet and\nshe's angry and it's not okay and then\nlike the generation that was raised on\nthis sci-fi is asking me why I'm\nbothered about being deep faked\nso what I'm hearing from you Anita is is\na very Central Point about\nthe usage of sexual material\nor how people interpret sexuality and\nalmost it like gives people license\nto violate people's boundaries to treat\nthem unwell that we and we as a society\nare also using sexual material to\ndominate and humiliate people\nand so you're what I'm kind of hearing\nyou say loud and clear is hey hold on a\nsecond when we've got political cartoons\nthat have Trump and Putin doing things\nor other people doing things it's clear\nthat when sexuality gets entered into\nthe picture it denigrates humiliates\npeople it has real consequences and and\nby the way that's I've read research\nthat mirrors a lot of what you're saying\nso it's really interesting but the\nnumber one reaction to women after\nrevenge porn is how they adjust their\nlife\nthey start to live different ways or not\nnot just women so ten percent of men as\nwell\num well will change the way they live\nthey change who they see they change how\nthey commute they change how they walk\ndown the street\ntheir whole life changes based on this\nkind of thing and it kind of makes sense\nright because if sexual denigration is\nassociated with all of these things\nincluding if you're viewed as a sexual\nobject or you put out or you're sexually\nactive that entitles people to a\nparticular access to you then I I think\nyou're making a very strong case of\nforget about the emotional impact for a\nsecond\nthe real life impact is quite profound\nin terms of how you're treated\nhow you're not taken seriously by law\nenforcement how it gives people license\nto crap on you in a particular way\neven in terms of the medical\nestablishment which I I'll own by the\nway I mean like even things like the\ndiagnosis of Hysteria being related to\nthe womb is a really good example of\njust like\npeople not really understanding women\nare having empathy for their like\nexperience of things\nI mean the fact that back in the\nmedieval not medieval\narids you could literally get clinically\ndiagnosed for a fingering or a vibrator\nfrom your doctor like the first vibrator\never invented was by a doctor he would\ncure hysteria\nwhen men were horny it was considered\nlike a natural thing but when women were\nhorny it was considered hysteria and\nsomething that needed to be cured and a\nmedical condition like that's how much\nwe just dislike female sexuality that we\njust consider it craziness\nI mean I completely agree with you I\nthink there's another layer to this\nwhich is that\nI think the reason that it was such an\neffective treatment I'm not disputing\nthat it was an unfair way to\ncharacterize problems and diagnoses and\ntreatment but one interesting takeaway I\nremember when I was doing my research on\nthis is how much better the mental\nhealth of people can become when they\nstart having orgasms\nright so if you just like like\nyou know how much does orgasm improve\nmood it actually improves mood quite a\nbit especially if it's consensual and\nstuff like that unclear about things\nlike masturbation and stuff but like\nyou know like some sometimes it it\nreally helps\nand and so I I can sort of see a\nperverse logic to like oh like hey I\ndiscovered this device and this is a\ndoctor who does not know what a female\norgasm is and he's like I've discovered\nthis device and it seems to help people\nand I will apply the device and then\nthey will shake for a while and the\nhysteria has left the body the humerus\nhave balanced and it's like they didn't\nknow what an orgasm was\nit's ridiculous\nand it's funny how that knowledge was\nlost and found wasn't it because the up\nsuck theory of like female orgasms and\nthe motion of the Kegel muscles tugging\nup the semen into the womb and it being\nnecessary to arouse her first in order\nto conceive was actually an idea that\noriginated in ancient Egypt and so a few\nthousand years before it was considered\nabsolutely integral to reproduction to\ngive her an orgasm and then by the time\nwe get to the invention of the vibrator\nsomehow knowledge was lost and forgotten\nand we think oh what's wrong with her\nshe must be crazy if she wants sex like\nhow how does that happen like how do we\nkeep having to ReDiscover that women\nlike sex that that's also an interesting\nU-turn what is this up suck Theory I've\nnever heard\noh so and during various times\nthroughout history\num it was considered like so when a\nwoman\nuh climaxes there is a Kegel motion that\ndoes this inside her body and so they\ntheorize that that had evolved or that\nthat mechanism existed to pull semen\ndeeper into the body and you know\nthrough the cervix and into the womb and\nthat the abstract technique is this idea\nthat the function that a female orgasm\nhas is to ensure conception like that it\nactually has a function in regards to uh\nyeah moving sperm and so like that idea\nthat theory has existed for an\nincredibly long time and it's actually\nin\num it's documented throughout the ages\nlike there have been recommendations for\nthis including in ancient Egypt it's\ninteresting Theory I'm not sure exactly\nwhat happened in the West\num I know that a lot of people will talk\nabout abrahamic religious influence I\ndon't know how fair of an argument that\nis like puritanism and things like that\nbut you know in the East I think uh\nsexuality was viewed quite differently\nso in in Japan and stuff it was and you\nknow like from my culture there's the\nKamasutra the Kamasutra which is in in\nactually one of the major goals of life\nis is God so there are four reasons why\nhuman beings exist on this planet and\none of them is actually the satisfaction\nof material desires which we've been\nokay with but even in India the same\nthing kind of happened there was like\nthis puritanical kind of wave where a\nlot of those old Concepts like got\nburied and and there's some kind of\ncultural influence that happened where\nsexuality in India is very repressed\nright now and there's a lot of really\nbad I mean it's not just now it's been\nhappening for like a hundred or hundreds\nof years\nnow there's more awareness of it so\nthere's sexual assault is really really\nbad\num and and even like by police and stuff\nin some regions and it's it's like\npretty can get pretty bad out there\nwe have the same thing here in the UK\num there has been a mass wave of\nscandals regarding even the police\nsexually assaulting\num people and getting away with it and\nin various ways and having like hundreds\nof victims knowing that there's no one\nto report them to they're the police\num so like this has been quite a serious\nissue here as well and we have less than\na one percent conviction rate for\num for rape here so of reported rapes\nvery few of them actually get uh\nconviction in court\num so yeah like it's I feel like it's\nsomething that's quite right spread\nglobally unfortunately\nyeah\nso I I have one kind of maybe tangential\nquestion so\num a fair number of people\nthat I've worked with Will\ncomplain about being friend zoned\nover and over and over again and let me\nknow if this is a little bit too off\ntopic but one of the things that I've\nkind of noticed is that sometimes like\nmen are so this is kind of a hypothesis\nI'm putting forward\nis that men are so starved for\ncompanionship compliments\nEtc that anytime an even remotely sexual\nobject provides them with that they sort\nof really jump into\n[Music]\nromanticizing or sexualizing this person\nand I've noticed the correlation between\npeople who are compliment starved and\ncomplaints of those same people being in\nthe friend zone do you have any thoughts\nor experience about that\nyeah plenty I mean\num I have uh quite a few male friends\nbecause I have a lot of the places I\nsocialize have very male dominated\ngaming climbing ax throwing do all sorts\nof everything I've ever gotten into\nevery hobby I've ever had I've been\nsurrounded by men so I make a lot of\nmale friends and one of the things I'll\nsay is yes the compliment thing is a\nproblem because like I'm quite I like to\ncompliment people I like people to know\nthat they're being seen in a good light\nI had a lot of social anxiety growing up\nand I was always feeling deeply\nembarrassed about things people didn't\neven notice but I was so sure that I\nshould be insecure about so whenever I\nget the opportunity to put people at\nease and let them know that they feel\nthey are appreciated I will in a\nplatonic way that I could totally get\naway with with female friends and they\nwouldn't assume anything of it if I\nliked their nail varnish or if I thought\ntheir hair looked great or things like\nthis\num but with men it's much more difficult\nand I feel like I'm working on eggshells\nbecause I feel like sometimes well most\nof the time men are not told\ntaught social skills as well and then if\nthey even if they are taught social\nskills they're not taught what is a cue\nfor a woman to like them or not like if\nyou go how do I know if a girl likes me\num wikiHow and things like that will\ntell you if she touches her hair if she\nlikes laughs at your jokes if she makes\neye contact with you it's like what so I\nhave to look at the floor never laugh if\nyou say something funny it's a try not\nto laugh challenge or I'll get [ __ ]\nzoned\num because like from the opposite side\nit feels like [ __ ] zoning if you don't\n[ __ ] me I'm wasting my time and I'll\nleave you as a friend so I I feel like\nwhen when like there's two sides to this\nI need it am I I've never heard this\nhypothesis either which I think is\nbrilliant which is that half the\nproblems in the world today are caused\nby men learning social skills and dating\nfrom wikiHow come on\nI mean like I've gone on chat because\nlike people there was this study that\nsaid point out all the women who are\nflirting with the photographer right and\nin this study most of the men just\npicked all the women who were smiling\nthey couldn't tell the difference\nbetween a woman smiling and a woman\ncoming on to the photographer like in\nthe photo\num so like I feel like we don't teach\nmen what uh a reciprocation looks like\nwe just don't and I've really noticed it\na lot because\num when I was a child when I was a\nteenager they'd be like I don't get it I\nyou laugh at my jokes we spend lots of\ntime together we have these long chats I\nthought you were into me you've been\ncoming onto me this whole time and I'm\nlike\nyeah and this is French I'll be like no\nthis is just friendship dude I thought\nyou were my friend yeah and a lot of the\ntime if you ask them hey are you coming\non to me they deny it but then they're\nstill mad at you like a lot of them are\ntoo embarrassed to say that they like\nyou directly so they'll say indirectly\nin ways that would be considered\nfriendship from a woman and so like I\nwill happily spend one-to-one time with\na friend I will talk about deep things I\nwill care about them I will be a source\nof emotional support and some men don't\nget a lot of that from their male\nfriends because it's considered gay or\neffeminate or just uncomfortable\num so they take the piss out of each\nother and they they don't they test the\nboundaries of each other as a way to\nplay and have fun but they don't really\ngo deep into like what's troubling them\nor they don't look for support from each\nother or admit when they're feeling weak\nor upset and so when guys feel\ncomfortable enough to do that with me\nthey see it as a form of intimacy\nwhereas I see that as surface level\nfriendship because among females that's\nnormal we we are taught to be\ncommunicators we are allowed to develop\nsocial skills we are given opportunities\nto emote and share ourselves and it's\nnot considered humiliating or debasing\nso we Bond and we develop social skills\nand empathy in a way that men are\ngetting denied by certain ideas of\nmasculinity so if you have like a toxic\nidea of masculinity if you have like a\nreally traditional dad it pressures you\nand goes Boys Don't Cry don't play about\nBarbie people think you're gay all this\nsort of [ __ ]\num\nand so you grow up in that environment\nand you don't know how to relate and no\none's ever supported you before and you\ndon't know what that looks like and you\nhave it looks like a special\nrelationship when you make a female\nfriend it looks like you have an\nintimate connection because what is just\nthe basic moral human default of support\nand friendship to a woman comes across\nas intimacy towards man in that\nsituation I I I I saw this dichotomy\nkind of in an interesting way so I one\ntime had a patient\nwho was disclosed was crying about a\nmoment in their life where they felt\nlike really good and their girlfriend\nfilmed it and thought it was beautiful\nbecause this is like a man talking about\noh like you know\nlike this was a time in my life and like\nI was afraid that this was going to\nhappen but it turned out and so it was\nlike just a deeply emotionally\nvulnerable moment\nuh she shared it with her friends\nbecause she thought it was beautiful and\nthe dude like absolutely flipped out\nand and it occurred to me like since\nI've worked with men since then I've\nsort of realized that\nit's almost like\nwhat the way that women feel vulnerable\nand correct me if I'm wrong here but\nthere's a certain vulnerability around\nsexual parts in terms of women that men\ndon't feel in terms of their sexual\nparts where we feel really vulnerable\nembarrassed is actually emotionally\nso\nthis is where since then I've talked to\nsome men and I think this has had some\ndecent effect where I try to explain to\nthem that how would you feel if someone\ntook your Mo like when you were crying\nbecause you were whatever and someone\nshared that with the world like how\nwould you feel like you're comfortable\ndoing that with your partner and the\npeople that are really really close to\nyou but if someone shared that with\npeople how would you feel and that's how\nwomen feel when you feel when you share\ntheir genitals they're like boobs or\nthings like that and and that's been one\nthing that I I found to be somewhat\neffective I don't know if it's actually\naccurate this is just what I've pieced\ntogether in terms of what and this is\nhow like so emotional intimacy for men\noftentimes has less to do with genitals\nand has more to do with or intimacy has\nmore to do with emotional vulnerability\nwhich is also part of the reason why men\nwill get confused in terms of girlfriend\nzoning people because\nemotional vulnerability and support is\npart of a platonic relationship\nbut for some men it's actually not and\nso when you get that from someone you\nthink that you get that from two places\nyour wife or your mom\nand the person you're hanging out with\nain't your mom\nanyway\nand and I I feel like you asked me\ninitially uh if I had any experience\nwith the friends or anything yeah I do\nbut I feel like I get [ __ ] zones because\nI'll have friends who swear down that\nthey're not interested in me\nromantically and they'll be supportive\nand they'll act like a friend for a\nwhile and then they'll come on to me and\nI'll be like whoa no dude and they'll be\nlike okay well I need a straight answer\nis there gonna be something more or am I\nwasting my time and they kind of make\nout like that if everything that we've\nlike a 10-year friendship was just a\nwaste of time if it doesn't result in a\nrelationship now and that's hideous and\nupsetting and I'm like well it's not\ngoing to result in a relationship and\nthen because I didn't [ __ ] I get put in\nthe [ __ ] zone I'm no longer a friend\nbecause or anything else like I get\nshifted out of the way in this weird\nlittle Zone where I was a waste of time\nand I thought I had a friend but it\nturned out I had someone waiting for me\nto sleep with them and they act like a\nvictim and they make it all\nShakespearean like whoa is me for Allah\nso I have feelings for you and it hurts\nme so deeply to see you not be with me\nand get on with your life and so I need\nto know do you like me or I must go\nYonder on the past just green and it's\nlike no dude this isn't some tragedy\nwhere you are victimized if I don't\nsleep with you you're literally saying\nsleep with me or I dump you as a friend\nand that's a horrible thing to do with\nsomeone you're acting like the victim\nhere you're not I treated you like\neveryone else you watch me treat\neveryone else the way I treat you and\nassumed you were special that's not on\nme and that's not me hurting you and\nthat's not fair and so like I hate the\nfriend zone because it is a horrible\ndescription of a very manipulative thing\nto do and that is to say that it's a\nZone you're put in that you can\nnegotiate your way out of that you can\nbargain with people and manipulate their\nfeelings by being impressive Enough by\ngiving enough gifts by buying enough\ndiamonds and [ __ ] chocolates and\nthat's so insulting to say that you can\nbuy my feelings that love or attraction\nis negotiable and they know it's not\nbecause if a dude they weren't attracted\nto or someone in an age bracket or a\nweight bracket that they weren't\nattracted to was hitting on them and\nbuying them stuff and giving them time\nand attention and going golfing with\nthem and listening to their problems all\nthis [ __ ] they listen to me they list to\nme but I listen to your problems I spent\nall this time with you are you saying I\nwas wasting my time like if someone did\nthat to them\nthey know that feelings are not\nnegotiable that chocolates don't buy\nlove that that's not how that works but\nthey tell each other you can get out of\nthe friend zone you can manipulate and\npressure a girl to like you even if she\nsaid no and that is the friend zone is\nthis creepy way this creepy way of\nplayfully saying you don't have to\nlisten to consent you can ask her how\nshe feels and if she says no and she\nsays you're a friend and puts you in\nthis Zone you can force her you can make\nher change her mind and it's creepy I\ndon't spend time with people who use the\nterm friend zone because if they believe\nin the friend zone they're a manipulator\nbut they don't even know it and being in\nthe [ __ ] Zone over and over again has\nbeen painful losing friends of years\nthat I didn't know were never friends\nis horrible and I'm the [ __ ] in that\nstory\nso that that's interesting I've never\nquite appreciated until you explain that\nhow\ngeographical the friend zone really is\nright because if you think about it as a\nspace it implies that you can move out\nof it\nyeah\num and even then a lot of people will\nthink that they've been moved into the\nfriend zone\nI have been friend zoned right so like\nthat's like it it implies that that's\nnot where you started out you didn't\nspawn in the friend zone you zoned in\nor were teleported to the friend zone\nwhich is interesting because it implies\nonce again that you can move out of it\nand I've seen that frustration as well\nin terms of\nso people will try to get out of the\nfriend zone and and when I work with\npeople like this what I sort of see is\nthat they're investing investing\ninvesting and they're not seeing a\nreturn on their investment and so then\nwhat they'll try to do is double down\nand like invest more and more and more\nand then you build more and more\nresentment\nand then the real tragedy is that\nthat resentment carries with the person\nthey carry it with them into their other\nrelationships\nthat resentment then makes it harder for\npeople to be attracted to them\nbut can oftentimes evoke emotional\nsupport because you've got someone who's\nlike wow I can see that you're hurting\nlet me be compassionate to you because\nyou're hurting because you're carrying a\nlot of resentment and then feelings get\ntangled and then the whole cycle kind of\nrepeats\nso I I interestingly enough for a lot of\npeople who have been chronically friend\nzoned the way that I've seen them get\nbetter and we've seen this actually a\nlot\nis is just in terms of letting go of\nthat resentment like it's it has nothing\nto do with the outside world it really\nhas to do with what you carry\nand this is my one of my big complaints\nabout a lot of the perspectives that\nwe'll see kind of in the manosphere is\nthat\nwhat I think a lot of people don't\nreally understand and this can be true\nof women too by the way is that the EXP\ntheir experience of the world is\ninfluenced by their actions\nso if I get friend zoned all the time\nthat\nthere's something I'm doing so the most\ncommon thing is a fear of rejection that\nprecludes people from\nmaking their intentions know early and\nso then they fall into this thing where\nI'm afraid you're going to reject me so\nI'm gonna do nice things so you like me\nand I'm gonna sack the deck in my favor\nuntil\nI demonstrate to you that I'm so nice\nand then when I shoot my shot I'm gonna\nhave a 99 chance of success\nyeah\num\nbut anyway I think we've kind of gotten\na little bit off topic I'm enjoying\ntalking to you I was just wondering\nthough do you think that\nthere's something else that people need\nto understand about\ndeep fakes non-consensual pornography is\nthere anything else that you want to\nshare kind of about your experience or\nyour understanding or\nit's cool that people are starting to\nhave this conversation and they're\nstarting to empathize with the people\nwho've been put in this situation but\nI've not seen anyone empathize with the\nsex workers who have gone through all of\nthe work it go it takes to be a sex\nworker which is a lot you have social\nstigma it's really hard to back out and\ndo any other job at thereafter you\nsometimes have to mutilate yourself to\nkeep up with the beauty standard and be\nable to do your job so you're paying for\nsurgeries and they're agonizing you know\nall of these sorts of things and you\nknow it takes a lot of expertise it's a\nreally hard thing to do it's very taxing\non the body and it can be traumatic at\ntimes as a really high turnover rate\nit's a really [ __ ] hard job right and\nthen you imagine you went through all of\nthat to produce work and someone said\nthanks I want this but not you so we're\njust going to put someone hotter's face\non it so we can have this piece of work\nthat you put all of that effort into\num but you're not enough so we're gonna\nmake it look like someone else and so\nlike like somebody had their work stolen\nfrom them something that they had to\ndedicate their entire life to be to\nbuild around like being a sex worker is\nfar and someone yeah their work is being\nstolen like my face is being used but\ntheir body and their work is being used\nand they're not seeing any profit from\nthis it's being stolen and no one's\nmentioning them as also being a victim\nof this\nwhy do you think that is\nbecause people don't care about women\nwho have sex like for the same reason we\ndon't look into the murders of sex\nworkers like people don't respect them\nand people dehumanize them when people\nmasturbate over someone they don't think\nabout them or care about them\nand so like sex workers are not just\nstigmatized they're dehumanized because\nthey're consumed they're not a person in\nporn they are a product even the way\nthey're referred to as some [ __ ] gets\n[ __ ] and then you reference which hole\nthey get [ __ ] in that's the way we\ntalk about sex workers in porn we don't\ntalk about them and their names often we\ndon't humanize them and especially with\nwomen that I rarely ever see anything\nlike beautiful princess gets worshiped\nit receives head from two men at once\nit's never like that it's usually like\nsome woman being horribly degraded and\ncalled names and slapped around and and\nso like if people desire to see that\nfrom someone they generally don't\nempathize with them\num have you even experienced in person\npeople who've been attracted to me not\nempathizing with me and so I feel like\nbecause we objectify sex workers we\ndon't think about their feelings or how\nthey're affected by us and I reckon\nthat's a big part of why people like me\nand Katie Cinderella and Maya have\nreceived our name is everywhere right\nnow where people talk about the effect\nit's had on us but I don't know a single\nname of any of the sex workers who had\ntheir work stolen and who were\nconsidered not good enough that their\nwork wasn't sexy enough until we put\nsomeone else's face on it\nyeah that's that's really interesting do\nyou have any thoughts about\nhow do we start tackling that problem\nit's hard because this has been so\nhistoric\num people try to blame things like hook\nup culture and stuff for how hypersexual\nwe are right now but\nI think it previous hookup culture\noh yeah by thousands of years\num I think we've been databasing and\ndehumanizing sex workers and women like\nwomen have been Spoils of War for\nMillennia so but there were times of\nequality and I think like looking back\nto the times where we had oh yeah\nespecially my country\num before the Christian Invasion and the\nRomans we had equality women were\ndoctors leaders Fighters soldiers we had\nancestral swords that were passed from\nWoman to Woman\num like women were considered equals in\nfact one of the tactics of war that the\nRomans did was ridicule for the men for\nlooking across at the women instead of\ndown at them and they're like huh you're\nnot even men you treat your women as if\nthey're equal to you and that actually\ncaused a stir in our community and made\nmen feel embarrassed to share power do\nyou mind sure I'm so curious what what\ncommunity are you referring to like when\nyou say my community what\nis it okay that I asked that as in\ncommunities as in people British like\nokay okay you know the Anglo-Saxons and\nVikings like all of these groups\nokay but like in Europe as well like\nthey have been documented like there\nwere Viking\num women who were Fighters and leaders\nand you know they had standing and they\nwere considered equals it wasn't\nconsidered that women were property or\njust brood mares like they were\nconsidered people and so there was whole\ncultures that established long-standing\nequality that was brought of them and so\nI would say like it is not this brand\nnew Progressive thing we need to invent\nlike this has it been established before\nand we lost it which says to me that\nthere was a time there have been many\ntimes in many places where this wasn't a\nproblem and if we can learn more about\nthose cultures we can learn how it was\nestablished and how it was lost and like\nwhat we need to get back to I and I\nthink it's a good question like how do\nwe deal with this issue where we consume\nand degrade and we consider penetration\nto be a way to degrade people and like\nhow do we get to a point where we can\nempathize with sex workers and things\nlike this and I think like a world where\nwe segregate men and women is a huge\nplace where we establish this resentment\num I'd say the place where I would look\nto start it is the toys section\nof children's like uh toy shops and\nstuff like this because there is a blue\nsection and a pink section it's so\nsegregated if you look at Lego the early\nadverts for Lego boys and girls were\nplaying together with colored Bricks now\nif you look for Lego you have to go to\none side of the toy shop to find Lego\nfor girls and another side for Lego for\nboys and we segregate male interests we\nproject male\nthings to do and female things to do on\nchildren and segregate us from each\nother we're not playing with the same\ntoys with each other we're being told\nthis is what your group does over there\nand if you try to cross it the parents\nPanic they're like no don't pick up that\nBarbie son don't pick up the pink dress\nson the kids at school will bully you\nboys don't do that and they genuinely\nare fearful for their kids if they cross\nthose boundaries they're incredibly new\nright\nand the issue with this is like if you\nsegregate us early you get things like I\nget people in my chat going how do I\ntalk to girls it's like we're people\nwhat do you mean we don't speak\ndifferent languages and they're not\nasking me how to like hang out with\nwomen and make female friends they're\nnot asking me how to talk to a grandma\nor like their niece who's like 10 or\nwhatever they're asking me how to be a\nstud how to say stuff that will seduce\nwomen they're attracted to they don't\nphrase it like that but that's what they\nmean and like so they're like I would\nget scared and nervous when I talk to\nwomen how do I talk to women in a way\nthat will make them like me how do I be\na giga Chad to women what do you go for\nin a man like I think they ask these\nquestions I can't I can't speak to this\nspecifically the people you're referring\nto I'd like to defend some of the men on\nthe internet\nthere where I think sometimes so here\nhere's my experience of it first of all\nI think\nthe world would be a way better place if\ndudes who had trouble talking to women\nspent a lot of time talking to grannies\nlike I think honestly that is I think a\nbrilliant idea yeah so I\nand and I I think I'm with you that\nmen will struggle to talk to women I I\ndo think though that some of that is\nlike there's almost like an exposure\ntherapy around anxiety sort of thing\nwhere I've worked with a lot of men that\nthey're not just trying to be Chads like\nthey really just struggle to talk to\nanyone of the opposite sex\nand and it's it's it's it's it's just\nsuper challenging for them like their\ninternal emotional experience is not I\nmean it may be like conditioned by\nsociety and judgment and stuff like that\nbut literally they're like moment to\nmoment experience of communicating with\nsomeone of the opposite gender who is\nanywhere in the ballpark of like\ndateable for them\nis very hard\num and and I I think it goes back to\nkind of what you were saying that these\nare skills that we don't necessarily\nexplicitly teach\nboys and I think that's actually even\napplying to girls now too so I've\nnoticed that the the way that we're\nespecially in the digital age like more\nand more women or that I've worked with\nare having difficulty in social\nsituations\nand some of the stuff that you're kind\nof saying implies that I I'm not saying\nI don't think you're actually implying\nthis but just to clarify like\nI think a lot of these challenges social\nsocialization even women talking to\nwomen or how does a woman talk to a man\nwithout inciting girlfriend zone or\nthings like that that women are actually\nstruggling with a lot of communication\nas well\nlike I'm not afraid of rejection from\nmen not because I think that they're\nalways going to want to date me or\nanything like that but because I don't\nidentify and segregate men according to\nelderly men [ __ ] men and children\nand like I don't have this like I'm\napproaching man and what if he doesn't\nwant to date me and if what if he\nrejects me I'm just like there is a\nperson wonder what he's doing and I go\nspeak to the person and I think like\nwhen I'm asked how do I how do I talk to\ngirls how do I get girls to like me I\ndon't think I'm really being asked how\ndo I relate to women because like that\nisn't actually a real question like you\njust they're just people like the answer\nto that is unanimously and most people\nknow this they're just people talk about\nthe things you're passionate about\nlisten to the things they're passionate\nabout talk to them like you would a guy\nand if you can't talk to them like you\nwould a guy it's probably because you\ntalk terribly about women to guys so\nlike like this issue is like I feel that\nI would I would push back heavily\nagainst so so I I do think so I think\nthis is where your conditioning has\ngiven you a particular experience where\nyou can see people as people\nright but like that's the whole problem\nis that there's a lot of people who see\nwomen as females they don't see them and\na lot of them genuinely don't know\nso how can like any that's like if I\nwere to tell you how do you start seeing\nyour box as a person\nlike do you know how to start seeing\nyour box as a person\nthe case like why is it in question that\nwomen are people\nexactly that's my point so so some\npeople actually grow up in particular\nsituations where that and this is what\nyou've been saying too is that if we\nlook at how women have been objectified\na lot of people grow up in situations\nwhere there's strong cultural forces\nthat do not I mean this is what you've\nbeen saying is that there's strong\ncultural forces which do not\nshape\npeople's perception of women as people\nand so some people genuinely have\ndifficulty understanding how to do that\nthat's why they struggle\nwhich is kind of what I was trying to\ndescribe too like yeah that there's this\ncategory of [ __ ] people that might\nreject you and it's like how do I I'm\nscared that I won't get what I want out\nof you like that's how it sounds to a\nwoman when you're saying like I'm scared\nof rejections like when that just means\nthat you want to date them and you're\ncommunicating with this nervous\ntentative like how do I speak to you and\ngive what I want and it's like but like\nnormally when the average person who's\nlike socially addressed talks to people\nthey don't immediately want like they\ndon't immediately categorize this bar of\npeople and go I'm scared to talk to them\nin case they don't sleep with me what if\nthey reject me like that's how it sounds\nand so it's like really hard for me to\nempathize with because I'm being asked\nhow do I get girls to like me how do I\nget them what do I say what's the cheat\ncode code pants all right so so let me\nask you this when you talk to men what\nare you afraid of if anything\nusually I am not initially afraid of men\nlike to a degree that people are\nsurprised by like if I see a drunk man\nstumbling around in the street most\npeople would give him a wide berth but\non multiple occasions I walk over and go\nare you lost are you okay do you know\nwhere you're going like I got told off\nby a police officer who watched my\nYouTube video where I was recording and\ntalking about Tourette Syndrome on the\nstreet and I saw a man passed out on the\nfloor so I just went oh free friend\npicked him up took him to a like\nwell-lit Hotel sat him down started\ntalking to him got him an Uber found out\nwhere he lived and got him home I'm not\nafraid of men I should be all of my\nexperiences would probably I'd be\njustified in being afraid I've had bad\nexperiences with men but I'm not afraid\nof them I'm not afraid of being rejected\nby them I'm not afraid of being attacked\nby them I just see them as other people\nright so so I I think that's that's\nawesome that you're able to get that to\nthat place having talked to a lot of\nwomen I'm not saying all women are like\nthis by any means but a lot of women\nhave come to have a default fear of men\nand consider men to be untrustworthy and\nwhat my experience having worked with\nboth sides of the aisle is that when men\nare afraid of rejection and women are\nafraid of being taken advantage of or\npressured or manipulated or attacked\nthose fears come from experiences\nand so it doesn't surprise me that you\nhave difficulty empathizing with someone\nwho's afraid of rejection because you\nsay yourself you don't you're not afraid\nof rejection that seems completely\nthat's not it doesn't sound like that's\nan experience that you've had a lot of\nso it makes sense that you would have\ndifficulty empathizing with someone\nwho's afraid of rejection\nrejected a lot like I spent most of my\nlife not being diagnosed with Tourette\nSyndrome so people thought I was crazy\nand people didn't want to spend time\nwith me people weirded out by me like\nthere's a scene in The Joker the latest\nJoker movie where he has a laughing tick\non the bus and everyone's side eyeing\nhim and everyone's uncomfortable and\nscared of him I was that guy for most of\nmy life when I tried to hang out in\nsocial groups they didn't like me when\nother kids were making friends they\nwouldn't include me teachers would even\nreject me and not want to help me and\nthings I know what it is to be rejected\nso I\nyeah yeah so so then I'm a little bit\nwhat what about your experience does not\ntranslate into empathy for men who are\nafraid of getting rejected\nso there's a difference there right\nbecause you're saying there's like these\nare these are apples and oranges\nas I'm hearing you that's what I'm\nperceiving so I'm curious what's what's\ndifferent I'm not disputing that by any\nmeans\nso it sounds like definitely if you've\nhad on diet I mean even if you had\ndiagnosed Tourette's like that's a\nrecipe for constant rejection in schools\nas well as professional situations and\nall kinds of other places\nmy nose is too big and ever since I've\nheated my nose and I haven't been able\nto get over it and it really deeply\naffected me and there was a time where I\nbought a guy flowers when I was young as\nwell and he didn't understand the\ngesture and when I'm not gay why would I\nlike flowers and he threw them away I\nthink one day he'll wake up like in his\n30s or something and go oh and realize\nwhat I was trying there but for now like\nhe was insulted right I've been rejected\nby boys and it traumatized me as a kid\nit it hurt me so much how how is it that\nyou don't fear rejection if you've been\ntraumatized by rejection\nbecause I feel like when a guy is scared\nto speak to me because I'm a girl and\nhe's attracted to me and he's scared of\nrejection I don't know anything about\nhim I've never met him or spoke to him\nhe's working up the courage across the\nroom and I've seen the scenario a few\ntimes\nwhat he's done is he doesn't know me he\ndoesn't like me he's looked at me he's\nlusting after me he likes my ass or tits\nthat's it that's all he knows what my\nbody looks like and now he's scared he\nwon't get what he wants\nand he thinks that that's this cute\nnervous shy nerdy thing like that makes\nhim a vulnerable little squish who's so\ninnocent he's he wants to speak to a\ngirl but he's so afraid and nervous but\nhow it comes across to me is he's\nfeeling a lot of pressure to get what he\nwants from me he wants to get close to\nmy body it's all he knows that's where\nall of the admiration comes from and\nhe's scared of not getting it he'll be\nhumiliated if he walks up to me and I'm\nnot immediately oppressed and like him\nback the way he likes me and it's like I\nfeel like that's a lot of pressure\nwhereas like if these people knew me\npersonally and they were scared of\nrejection that would be different and\nquite often that turns into the friend\nzone scenario but often the men that I\nhave bumped into and had experiences\nwith who are scared of rejection are\npeople who don't know me people who just\nlooked at me and now they're like scared\nto talk to me in case I reject them and\nit's like why do you even want to get\nhim with me at this point you don't even\n[ __ ] know me and you're scared that\nI'll turn you down like I haven't even\nthought about whether or not I'll date\nyou like you're a stranger to me how do\nyou how do you know so it sounds like\nyou're you have an understanding of\nwhat's going on in their head and\njudgments that they're making about\nlike you're because you're saying that\nthere's there's all the stuff going on\nin their head right like they're placing\nall this pressure they're like\ngirlfriend zoning you they're like\num where do you get that understanding\nthat this is what's going on in their\nhead\nI've had friends that I have\nbrought into my life and accepted if\nyou've talked to me about how they felt\nwhen they first spoke to me or they've\ntalked about I like this girl I see her\nat the grocery store all the time but\nI'm scared to talk to her in case she\nregret rejects me and they know nothing\nabout her they're scared that she won't\nfancy them back immediately like and\nthat's weird to me I don't get it like\nthat's not actually being rejected they\nshe can't know you how could she reject\nanything about you she doesn't know you\nlike if you're gonna have one\nconversation with her and be scared\nyou'll get rejected like the most\nrejection you can get is that she\ndoesn't want to hang out with you or\nisn't interested in the conversation\nyeah this this that's this makes a lot\nof sense so so I'm I'm now understanding\nso I I just connected a couple of dots\nso if you believe\nI would bet money that 90 of the men who\nare listening to this conversation\ndo not believe that you need to be known\nto be rejected\nso you just said like right huh\nlike I think you have to know someone to\nactually reject this yeah so rejected if\nsomeone tries to speak to me and and\nthey're like they don't like if I do\nsmall talk and I'm like huh nice weather\nwe're having here and they're just like\nyeah and they walk away like I'll take\nthat as they don't really feel like a\nconversation but I don't feel rejected\nyeah my intention I think this is this\nis awesome because I think this is huge\nI don't understand exactly what the\nimportance of this is but\nI wonder if it has something to do with\nthe dehumanization and and it's it's\nhard I can't put it together and I've\njust had a long day but something about\nthe statement that you just made that\nyou can't get rejected if someone\ndoesn't know you that's that runs\ncontrary to so much of my experience in\nthe experience like you can get rejected\nso easily and in fact\nI I would imagine that a lot of men that\nI know would agree that\nit's easier to get rejected without\npeople knowing you\nand I wonder if huh like how do you want\nto expand on that because how how is it\npossible to reject someone if you don't\nknow them\num\nit's a good question I I'm I'm just\nconnecting these dots so I'm gonna like\nthink about it and see if I can get you\nan answer but I think this is something\nthat warrants further explanation I\nwonder if it has something to do with\nlet me just think\nI think it has to probably do with the\ndifferential interpretation of one\ninteraction\nso if I ask someone to hang out and they\nsay no\nthe reasons they say no could have\nnothing to do with me\nyeah right but I think especially men\nare raised in a way where\na no results in like lower status\nlike so if I'm a dude and I ask out a\ngirl and she says no\nnone of my friends care about the nuance\nthey don't care that she's a lesbian or\nthey don't care that she's not\ninterested in dating or she's asexual or\nyou know they they have they don't care\nwhat I get judged on is whether they say\nyes or no\nand oftentimes when I may judge myself\non\nand because if you kind of think about\nit right so like also historically men\nare the ones who are open to being\naccepted and rejected like even if you\nthink about this idea of proposing\nso like\nin that scenario\nthe one who's on Deck to be rejected or\naccepted is the man like that's a common\nscenario societally so on deck for\nacceptance or rejection is men and I\nhate to do this I'm going to kind of do\nit but I gotta add a bunch of\nof caveats here because I hate\ninterjecting\nanimal biology into humans because I\nthink for the most part the human mind\nis so complex that a lot of like mating\nTheory doesn't apply\nlike I just don't think that human\nbeings act based on like observations of\nlike animal mating patterns\nbut if you look at a lot of animal\nsituations and humans are not different\nwhere frequently it is the man it is the\nmale who will\nbe accepted or rejected\nand I think that for a lot of the\nmanosphere like they read way too much\ninto this and they don't really\nappreciate that women have it's not like\nhigh value men and low value men like\nwomen are thinking human beings that can\nmentalize and have complex internal\nenvironments and who they choose to\nengage in a relationship with has way\nmore than height and how much money they\nhas and there's actually overwhelming\nbiological evidence to support that\npoint because the truth of the matter is\nthat most women\nwho in most people who have\nrelationships and will procreate are\naverage\nthey're not exceptional\nwhich means that average dudes are\ngetting laid and having families and\nhaving fulfilling lives all the time\nthis whole hypothesis that oh it's only\nthe high value males that procreate\nthat's actually like factually very\nincorrect\nokay I think I gotta go\nhi sweetie\nI'll be there in a second okay can you\ngo close the door\nokay well\nokay\neveryone stay on camera give me give me\ntwo minutes\nDaddy's trying to make the world a\nbetter place for y'all when y'all are\nlike 10 years older\num\nanyway so I I think it's it's\ninteresting and it's a beautiful\nquestion Anita I wish I had a better\nanswer for you that's the best I can\ncome up with at short notice\nI wouldn't trust that answer I'm not\nputting my money down on it but there's\nsomething about this whole idea of\nproposing where I think like\nacceptance or rejection is it's sort of\nlike the male part of the dynamic\nwhich is sort of false because the woman\nalso I'm a woman who initiates I'm a\nwoman who will only date a man that I've\nasked out I don't accept offers like I\ndon't I've never said yes to someone\nwho's asked me out I only ever ask\nsomeone else out and\num I laid that down from my friends I'm\nlike if I've never asked you out I'm not\nattracted to you I don't like being hit\non whatsoever and a lot of them crossed\nmy boundary and hit on me anyway and\njustify it by saying I know I didn't\nlisten to you but traditionally a man\nhas to offer and I'm like to find out\nand I've already said you've found out\nif I've never expressed an interest in\nyou that I'm not interested in you so\nlike I feel like where there's a\ndisconnect here is that I don't feel\nlike I've rejected someone for anything\nif I don't have time to talk to them or\nI don't know whether it's safe to stop\nto them in this alley and I feel like\nI've not made a judgment of you because\nI don't know you yeah and so I haven't\nrejected you but you might feel rejected\nand you might feel the consequences of\nother people perceiving you as someone\nwho's been rejected and that I am being\nheld responsible for that even though so\nthat might not actually be the case\nbecause I don't know you I didn't make\nany assumptions based on you whatsoever\nyou've not been rejected by me because I\nknow nothing about you I haven't pushed\nout anything about you I just couldn't\nstop for a chat and so I couldn't give\nyou a window to hit on me yeah I can a\nwindow to try anything and I don't owe\nyour window to try anything either like\nthis idea that I've rejected you if I\ndon't give you an opportunity to apply\nfor a role in my life\nbut I never even advertised like that's\nnot really rejection either like maybe I\njust don't want to be hit on right now\nor like maybe it is I just don't date\npeople like you specifically but then\nthat's not actually a measurement of you\nthat's a measurement of my standards and\nmy life and what I'm doing right now and\nstill you can't really take that\npersonally like I wouldn't take that\npersonally as someone who has put myself\nout there for rejection like I and I do\nget rejected I don't take rejection that\npersonally and I don't see it as a\nmeasure of me whether or not this person\nsays yes or no and I feel like I don't\nknow for me that just looks like\nmaturity I feel like that's a place\nyou're supposed to revive at when you're\nolder\nI don't know I would agree I mean so I\nagree with a lot of what you're saying\nso I think your perspective is quite\nmature I was going to use the word\nenlightened but I think also that's so\nthis is the tricky thing right is a lot\nof what you're saying is not the norm\nso you kind of say okay I don't date\npeople that I don't ask out which is\nfair like you do you and it's awesome\nthat you've come to a place where you\nunderstand\nyou know you've dealt with rejection\nyou've overcome rejection you've\ndeveloped faith in yourself you don't\nreject people until you learn who they\nare and you give them in a sense a fair\nchance not that anyone deserves that\nchance or anything like that I think\nthis is where things get really\nconfusing because a lot of the dudes\nthat I've worked with\nit seems like\nthey're trying to and I think there are\nproblems here even in this thinking\nyou know the standard that you set\nis quite different from the standard\nthat a lot of people set\nand I think what a lot of the challenges\nthat something about being a man means\nthat you have to meet other people's\nstandards you don't get to determine\nyour own standards which is exactly what\nI think needs to happen so the journey\nthat you've gone through is you've like\nbeen through a lot of crap and then\nyou've decided through some amount of\npersonal growth and a lot of suffering\nthis is the way that you want to live\nyour life\nfor some reason\na lot of people that I work with and\nthis can absolutely be true of of women\nas well where a lot of women like don't\nget to determine what kind of Life they\nwant to live\nthey don't get to the self-determination\nis not an option for them\nand that's true for a lot of men as well\nwhereas like I don't get to choose what\nmakes me happy my value is determined by\nmy acceptance of other people by other\npeople's acceptance of me and that's a\nthat's a story that\nespecially boys get fed from day one\nright like\nso I a lot of this is making sense to me\nI think your your views are perfectly\nvalid I think it's great that you feel\nthat way and I'm also beginning to see\nhow it could be hard for you to\nempathize with these people because I\nthink you've come to a place that is\nforeign to them\nbut anyway\nand and this is where I've seen women\nwho are like this too where like you\nknow their value is based on\nmeeting some kind of external metric\nlike the number of children I have or\nlike you know being prom queen or like\nwhatever there are lots of women who are\nhave those kinds of things and what I've\nwhat I think the the fear of rejection\ncomes from people who are raised in that\nkind of idea that you don't have\nintrinsic value as a human being who you\nare doesn't matter it's how you perform\nhow much money do you make how tall are\nyou\nwhat's your body count\nwhen you express interest in someone do\nthey say yes or no your value as a man\ndepends on these variables\nand I think that that's harmful like\nand I think that's harmful too yeah and\nI try to be the kind of friend I don't\nrate any of my male friends by whether\nor not they get laid or whether or not\nthey've been turned down like I have\nmale friends who struggle things like\nsocial cues\num have been virgins their whole life\nand I think they're cool as [ __ ] and I\ndon't measure them by their sexuality\nwhatsoever and I have friends who are\nsex workers who've mated with thousands\nof people and I don't care whatsoever\nlike sometimes it's really interesting\nto hear about their life stories and the\nthings they've experienced but like\nneither of these ends of the spectrum\nmean anything to me in terms of their\nvalue and so it's so alien to me that\npeople are walking up to me thinking\nlike if they come up to me and they're\nscared of rejection because like they I\nthey think that I designate their value\nthat that's my responsibility that\nwhether I say yes or no or it's harmed\nor not defines everything about them\nthat's that's such a beautiful point\nright so I think that the experience of\nwomen in this situation I'm generalizing\nhere but is that once again so if a man\nthinks that their value and they've been\nconditioned to believe that right\nbecause there are a lot of men and women\nwho will judge them based on these\nthings and now what happens is it's\nterrifying because your value as a human\nbeing now becomes not part of your own\nagency\nbut how you were treated by others and\nthen what happens is they put the\npressure on the women to accept me\nbecause if you accept me I'm worth\nsomething if you don't accept me I am\nworth nothing and that's not a fair\nresponsibility to put on the what like\nand this is how we get to if you break\nup with me I'ma kill myself\nright that our value becomes tied into\nhow people treat us\nand I've seen that a ton too\nand so this is I I just need to sleep on\nthis because I this is I've learned so\nmuch today and I want the opportunity to\ntry to give you a better answer to what\nis I think a very important question\nI love I've learned a lot from you today\nand I really loved the discussion I feel\nlike it got into like a whole other\ndirection than I expected but I enjoyed\nit and I don't want to hold you anymore\nbecause I feel like you've got places to\nbe and things to do\num but I really appreciate being invited\non today and talking about all of this I\nhope we get to talk again because yeah I\nknow I always grow every time that's the\nsame I I think I think you do just such\na good job of articulating\na lot of people will talk about this\nstuff but I feel like the way you put it\ntogether\nreally helps me understand a lot about\npeople what people's experiences are\num and I I do have I I got stuff to do\nand um but I want to thank you from the\nbottom of my heart for coming on today I\nknow that this this even this kind of\ndiscussion can Garner a lot of like\nunpleasantness\num and this is where once again I think\nthere's a gender Dynamic here where I\nthink the amount of toxicity that you\nmay be opening yourself up to by having\nthis conversation is probably different\nfrom what I'm opening myself up to\nuh and and I mean what I said earlier\neven though I was kind of saying it\njokingly that I have two daughters and\nthey're entering this world and I'm\nscared for the world that they're coming\ninto\nand I think that there's like a lot of\ndangerous directions of like where\ngender Dynamics is going\nand my hope is that more conversations\nlike this will make things better for\nmen and women both\nso thank you very much from the bottom\nof my heart and I hope you don't get\nFlack or you know\nhate are you still can I raid you are\nyou\nI I decided not to stream this one I am\nbut like uh thank you for the offer and\nfeel free to rate somebody who uh who\nshould I rate can you please tell me\nokay uh how about\num\nhow about any future\nAnnie fuchsia\na-n-n-i-e-f-u-c-h-s-i-a she's really\nlovely okay let's do it\nso thank you very much Anita take care\nhave a good evening night\nadios bye everyone bye"
