    "transcript": "today we're going to talk a little bit\nabout imposter syndrome and let's start\noff by understanding what the experience\nof having imposter syndrome is like\nthe people with imposter syndrome\noftentimes feel like imposters they feel\nlike they're living a fake life they\ntend to be terrified that one day\nsomeone will figure out that they don't\nactually belong\nthey sort of have have this impression\nof themselves that they've somehow\nmanaged to skate by and trick everyone\ninto thinking that they're competent and\nso they always kind of feel like the\nHouse of Cards is about to come tumbling\ndown so it's a very stressful experience\nto feel like an imposter and to have\nimposter syndrome hey there thanks for\nwatching and I'm glad these videos have\nbeen helpful a lot of times I'll read\nthe comments and see people asking well\nwhat do I actually do about it which is\na great question and unfortunately the\nresources out there haven't been that\ngreat which is precisely why I started\nHD in the first place HG coaches are\ntrained on a curriculum that integrates\nmy understanding of what motivates us\nwhat paralyzes us and most importantly\nwhat leads to Lasting behavioral change\nif you're ready to take the next step HG\ncoaches can help you build the life that\nyou want they've helped people build\ncareers help people find relationships\nbuild networks of friends and even do\nthings like discover their passions or\npursue Hobbies so if this sounds like\nsomething that you'd be interested in\ncheck out the link Link in the\ndescription below there are a couple of\nother key features which are really\nimportant to understand the most\nimportant is actually that someone's\naccomplishments don't actually lead to a\nsense of competence so if we look at a\nnormal person when I succeed or\naccomplish something what tends to\nhappen is my self-esteem gets a boost\nright like after all I was successful I\ndid a good job I should feel better\nabout myself but with someone with\nimposter syndrome the opposite actually\nhappens when someone with imposter\nsyndrome succeeds or accomplishes\nsomething instead of at actually\nboosting their competence they somehow\narrive at the conclusion that they've\nfaked it that they don't actually\ndeserve to be successful they they\ndidn't actually achieve something\nthrough their own effort and so\nparadoxically the better they do the\nworse they feel about themselves and so\nwhere does imposter syndrome really come\nfrom how does someone start to think\nthis way and so research shows that it\nactually begins usually in childhood so\nthere are two main sort of profiles of\npeople who develop imposters syndrome\nthe first profile is sibling of a golden\nchild or gifted kid so these are\nsituations in which someone grew up\nhaving a usually an older sibling who's\nvery very accomplished and frequently\nthat families would make comparisons\nbetween the person who eventually\ndevelops imposter syndrome and The\nGolden Child these are situations in\nwhich growing up you know parents will\nsay things like oh you know your oldest\nsibling is so smart they're so talented\nthey do such a good job it seems like\nthe older sibling is effortlessly\nsuccessful and meanwhile you've got the\nyounger sibling who's terrified and\nstruggling to keep up because they've\ngot very very big shoes to fill a lot of\nParental expectations and if my older\nbrother and sister are able to do it I\nshould be able to do it too\nthe other interesting thing is that the\nother group of kids who grew up to have\nimposter syndrome actually deal with\nthose pressures directly themselves they\nare sort of viewed as a gifted kid or\nGolden Child and these kids tend to come\nfrom high achieving families that put a\nlot of pressure on their kids and the\nkey thing here is that parents of\nchildren who grow up to have imposter\nsyndrome will appreciate the child's\naccomplishments but won't appreciate or\nactually denigrate the efforts that the\nchild has to go through so these are\nparents who wouldn't sort of say hey you\ndid you got an A that's a really good\njob you must have worked really really\nhard to get that a in fact what these\nparents will do is they'll say they'll\nsort of assume that the child should get\nan a right because you're smart and\nbecause we're smart and because you're\nso smart and talented everything should\nbe easy for you and so when they start\nto deal with a child who sort of and\nkind of put a pressure on them that\neverything should be easy for you what\ndoes that do to the child it creates a\nvery very scary situation where oh I\nmanaged to do a good job which is what I\nwas supposed to do right so like I got\nan A that's what I'm supposed to do but\nit's supposed to be easy for me but it\nactually it was hard for me and so what\nstarts to happen is they start to lose\nconfidence in themselves and they start\nto believe that achievement should be\neffortless in nature and if I am having\nto work hard to get an A then there must\nbe something wrong with me so these are\nthe two backgrounds that lead to\nimposter syndrome if we kind of tunnel\ndown to what is the common shared\nfeature the most common feature of\nimposter syndrome is this idea that the\nmore success you have the more you\naccomplish the less competent you feel\nin yourself and this is something that I\nwas I got super interested in so when I\nwas doing my residency at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital we got a lot of kids\nwho were like college students from MIT\nin Harvard and places like that and I\nsaw something really Czar which is that\nthese kids should feel really confident\nin themselves right these are some of\nthe smartest kids most talented kids\nmost accomplished kids in university in\nthe United States and yet they have\nreally bad self-esteem problems and as I\ncontinued working with kind of like high\nAchievers I noticed that imposter\nsyndrome kept on cropping up over and\nover and over again and I got kind of\nconfused right because as I worked with\nlike Bankers from places like Goldman\nSachs or like you know other really\ntalented people entrepreneurs CEOs\nthings like that game developers from\nlike you know very prestigious companies\nI was super surprised that I was seeing\nmore and more and more imposter syndrome\nand so I started to think a little bit\nabout okay hold on a second like why is\nthis okay so we sort of know that the\nmore you accomplish you're not able to\ndevelop a sense of competence but why is\nit that all of these people at high\nperforming institutions are winding up\nwith imposter syndrome because I thought\nthat imposter syndrome is like a bad\nthing right these are people who are\nsuffering with imposter syndrome they're\nstressed out all the time they're afraid\nthat everything is going to come\ncrashing down around them but this is\nwhen I sort of realized that imposter\nsyndrome isn't a bug it's actually a\nfeature and if you look at research on\nimposter syndrome which you begin to\nrealize and if you work with these\npeople is that the reason that imposter\nsyndrome is so prevalent and is so hard\nto deal with is because it's actually an\nadvantage in some ways\nso imposter syndrome is essentially an\nAdaptive response it's something that's\na painful adaptation it's an adaptation\nthat leads to suffering but it's\nabsolutely an adaptation so let's\nunderstand why imposter syndrome is\nactually hard to kick and what it\nactually does for people so let's start\nby looking at a normal person okay so a\nnormal person works really really really\nhard and then they accomplish something\nthey succeed in some way and when they\nsucceed in something they feel good\nabout themselves and what do they do\nthey go out and they celebrate on the\nflip side someone with imposter syndrome\nwhen they work really really really hard\nand they achieve something how do they\nfeel about themselves they feel\nterrified they feel like oh my God I got\nso lucky I barely scraped by I got so\nlucky that the professor likes me\notherwise I wouldn't have gotten an A\nand so what do they do after they get an\nA they actually double their efforts\nthey actually work twice as hard they\ndon't relax at all they actually work\nharder because remember if in your mind\nyou are maintaining this elaborate\nfacade that could come crumbling down\naround you at any moment you can't relax\nat all right because if if you make a\nsingle mistake everything's gonna come\ntumbling down you have no sense of\nReserve you have no sense of resilience\nyou can't rely on things to work for you\nand it's because you're kind of like\nscrewing up right like you're on the\nverge of everything coming crashing down\nthere's no room for relaxation and so\nnow we can begin to see that the\nbehavior of someone with imposter\nsyndrome actually leads them to more and\nmore success which is precisely why you\nhave more and more imposters in more\nsuccessful places\nand for the record you know back in\nresidency I did a lot of work with like\nhomeless people I worked in the jail for\na few months and I didn't see a single\ncase of imposter syndrome in the\nhomeless population there aren't people\nout there who are like oh my God I'm not\nreally homeless like people are going to\nfigure this out and that everything is\ngoing to come crashing around in fact\nimposter syndrome correlates with\noutward achievement and so this is the\nreally bizarre thing is that these are\npeople who should feel really confident\nin themselves in fact imposter syndrome\njust as a quick historical side note was\nactually discovered in high functioning\nand high performing women who despite\nthe fact that they were very very\nsuccessful felt like imposters\nso now that we understand that imposter\nsyndrome actually encourages people to\nwork extra hard and is sort of like an\nadaptation that leads to more success\nand accomplishment how do we tackle this\nand this is where things get a little\nbit tricky because technically imposter\nsyndrome is not actually a psychiatric\ndiagnosis so you can't be diagnosed with\nimposter syndrome because it's not even\nofficially recognized by therapists\npsychologists psychiatrists and\nfurthermore it's not something that the\naverage psychologist or psychiatrist or\ntherapist gets any training in so if you\nlook at the formal kind of curriculum\nthat therapists get trained in imposter\nsyndrome usually has zero hours of\ntraining and this is something\nunfortunately that we've had to deal\nwith at healthy gamer because we get a\nlot of clients in our coaching program\nwho've actually tried therapy and\ndiscovered that the amount of help that\nthey got with imposter syndrome was\nhighly variable so the therapists were\nreally good at dealing things with like\nanxiety disorders and mood disorders but\nunfortunately we've seen a lot of\nunfortunate outcomes in terms of\nimposter syndrome and therapy now this\ndoesn't mean that you can't get help\nfrom a therapist and I've worked with a\nbunch of people with imposter syndrome\nand I think I've been able to help them\na lot I have a lot of colleagues who've\nbeen very successful but you should know\nthat your mileage may vary\nso today what we're going to do is talk\na little bit about how imposter syndrome\ngets maintained so that you can\nchallenge some of the cognitive patterns\nthat you may be dealing with so\nresearchers have discovered something\nreally interesting when it comes to\nimposter syndrome since it's not really\na diagnosis it kind of gets maintained\nthrough particular patterns so unlike\nsomething like a mood disorder which may\nbe like neurotransmitter mediated or\nthings like that like maybe a serotonin\ndeficiency or for example a panic\ndisorder is an inappropriate activation\nof your adrenaline system it seems like\nimposter syndrome is actually reinforced\nthrough particular cognitive patterns\nand what we're going to share with you\ntoday is what those patterns are how to\nfind them and even how to counteract\nthem so the first pattern involving\nimposter syndrome is not attributing\nyour success to your effort so if you\ntalk to an imposter and you ask them\nokay why are you successful you'll get\nlots of answers that have nothing to do\nwith them oh I I ended up going to\nHarvard because my parents are smart I\nended up going uh getting promoted\nbecause I'm lucky I ended up Landing\nthat contract because uh you know the\npeople thought I was very friendly or\nthey took pity on me the successes of\npeople with imposter syndrome are\nactually never taken on by themselves so\nthey always attribute their successes to\nsome external factor or luck and when\nyou do that what that sort of means is\nthat you can't log a w in the W column\nright because you don't really deserve\nto be successful that success has\nnothing to do with your actual\ncompetence\nand so this is what's really interesting\nthere's actually research that shows\nthat you can actually ask someone with\nimposter syndrome to think a little bit\nabout what they did to deserve a win and\nthis is the kind of thing that we'll\nteach our coaches and it actually works\nsurprisingly well is simply to ask\nsomeone so anytime you have some sort of\naccomplishment you sort of think a\nlittle bit about what you did to deserve\nit\nand think a little bit past your\nknee-jerk reactions for why you're\nsuccessful so instead of just assuming\nthat you were lucky and that's why you\ngot an A oh it turns out that I missed\none review session and that review\nsession wasn't on a test that's why I\ngot the a whereas this person is\nignoring the 90 of the stuff that they\ndid right they went to class every day\nthey did their homework every day they\nwent to all the other review sessions\nthat were on the test they got notes\nfrom a friend so there's a really\ninteresting cognitive pattern that\nhappens in people with imposter syndrome\nwhich is that they actually devalue\ntheir own efforts that lead to success\nso what you want to do if you struggle\nas an imposter is any time you're\nsuccessful pay attention to that first\nthing that your mind says which is that\nyou're lucky and instead think a little\nbit about what did you do to deserve\nthis\nthe second cognitive pattern that\nmaintains imposter syndrome is that we\nattribute other people's successes to\nhard work so when someone else gets\npromoted when someone else gets an a\nthat's because they worked really hard\nand they really deserve it right they\ndidn't get lucky there was no nepotism\ninvolved or anything like that everyone\nelse's successes they deserve but my\nsuccesses I don't deserve so the second\ncognitive pattern that we need to attack\nis that one so this is a situation where\nwhen you see someone else succeed what\nis your default response in your mind\nwow they really deserve it and so this\nis where what we actually want to do is\nflip the script a little bit and start\nto ask yourself well what are the\nadvantages that they had in what ways\ndid they get lucky and even articulating\nsome of this stuff starts to challenge\nthis cognitive pattern the third\ncognitive pattern in imposter syndrome\nis an emphasis on pleasing others so\nwhen when you're successful or not it\nreally has nothing to do with you so\nyour idea of success if you're an\nimposter is is what do other people\nthink so if I get an A and this is where\nkind of that high achieving families\nDynamic comes in when I get an A what do\nother people think about it that's what\nimposters care about so if you're a kid\nwho grew up with a sibling who was a\ngolden child even if you get an A no one\nis proud of that accomplish in and of\nitself right they're not proud of that\naccomplishment what they're proud of\nwhat you're kind of doing is you're\ncomparing your accomplishments to other\npeople so one of the things that we know\nabout people with imposter syndrome is\nthey're very very concerned with\nexternal opinions and external\nvalidation and that's why we're so\nterrified of of you know everything\ncoming crashing down and people will\nwill it'll be revealed that we're\nimposters and we don't actually deserve\nour success so when you succeed the mind\nof someone that with imposter syndrome\nis going to default to thinking about\nwhat other people think so when I get an\nA on a test I'm not happy until my\nparents say good job kid you're so smart\nwhen I do a good job at work what I\nreally care about about I can't relax or\nfeel competent or feel proud until my\nboss says good job and once I've made my\nboss happy I have maintained the scam\nright this is another day that's gone by\nat work where they haven't figured out\nI'm incompetent and my boss still thinks\nthat I'm a good person right so we\nreally care what other people think and\nwe're not able to take pride in our own\naccomplishments the idea that I can be\nproud of something and someone else may\nbe disappointed in it is completely\nforeign to someone with imposter\nsyndrome that just does not compute at\nall there's no way I can be proud of\nsomething and someone else be\ndisappointed in something\nand so this is the thing that we kind of\nwant to tackle is to develop a sense of\npride in our own accomplishments and\nthat too can be done somewhat simply by\nsimply asking yourself okay when you do\na good job at something how do you feel\nabout it and you may say well how do I\nknow if I've done a good job well you\njust think about it for a second right\nso if you went to work today\nyou can ask yourself what can I be proud\nof that I did today if you cooked a meal\nwhat can you be proud of what are you\nactually satisfied with was the meal\ntasty to you is there any part of it\nthat you can be proud of and the key\nthing is that people with imposter\nsyndrome actually skip this step they\ntry really hard to skip that step and\nthey substitute it with well what did\nother people think about the meal that I\nmade so if you want to challenge this\ncognitive pattern of imposter syndrome\njust stop for a second and think a\nlittle bit about what can I take prior\npride in what can I actually be proud of\nso at the end of the day imposter\nsyndrome is something that we're seeing\nmore and more and more and bizarrely the\npeople with imposter syndrome are the\nones that kind of deserve it the least\nso the more accomplished you are the\nmore likely you are to to feel imposter\nsyndrome and we've seen this a lot in\nour career coaching program in our\ncreator coaching program where we work\nwith people like YouTube creators and\ntwitch creators and all of them have\nimposter syndrome and why is that it's\nbecause imposter syndrome is not\nactually it while it's harmful it's also\nadaptive so it's a harmful adaptation\nand how is it adaptive well that's\nbecause someone with imposter syndrome\ninstead of celebrating when they do a\ngood job what they actually do is panic\nand work twice as hard and if you really\nthink about it instead of celebrating if\nyou're panicking all the time and\nworking twice as hard do you suffer sure\nbut you're also going to be very very\naccomplished and very successful because\nyou're working hard all the time and as\npeople are able to acknowledge the\nthings that they've done that deserve\nsuccess as people are able to\nacknowledge that if someone else is\nsuccessful maybe they got a little bit\nlucky too and lastly as people are able\nto take pride in themselves instead of\nrelying on someone else's validation\nthat's when you see start to see\nimposter syndrome get a lot better"
