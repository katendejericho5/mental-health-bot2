    "transcript": "in life there are some things that we\ncan't control and some things that we\ncan control and the biggest problem that\nwe run into is when we let the things\nthat we cannot control control the\nthings that we can control this is when\nwe truly lose at life we get so caught\nup about I'm a disadvantage and I felt\nthis way back when I was applying to med\nschool I looked at this and it pissed me\noff because I looked at this and I said\nif I was a different ethnicity I would\nhave gotten into med school years ago\nbut since I'm Asian the deck is stacked\nagain me but there's a flip side to that\nargument which is since I'm Asian my\nparents could pay for MCAT classes I\ncould spend time studying for the MCAT\nand not worry about how how I was going\nto pay for rent and feed myself and\nstuff like that so Indian comes with\nsome advantages I don't know if things\nbalance out or not but whatever the\nworld is the way it is the right thing\nto do is not cry about it the wrong\nthing to do is cry about it because in\nthis life there are a lot of things that\nyou can't control which are going to be\nstacked against you that's life"
