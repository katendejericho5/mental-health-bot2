    "transcript": "and this is why it's so hard because\nachieving Perfection starts with letting\nPerfection go we don't want to though\nbecause if we let it go then there's no\nguarantee and that's a big part of grief\nwhen a relationship ends I want to hold\non to that relationship why do I want to\nhold on to that relationship because\nthere's no guarantee that I'll meet\nsomeone in the future so a big part of\nthat grief process is embracing the\nuncertainty so if you struggle with\nperfectionism and feel overwhelmed\nbecause you know you can do it and you\ndon't want to settle what you actually\nneed to do is grieve it's not settling\nit's letting go of that Perfection and\nparadoxically as you let go of the\nPerfection you actually take a step\ncloser to it"
