    "transcript": "what really bothers me about this or I\nthink what we need to acknowledge is I\nwant you to like look at where your lack\nof compassion is coming from why is it\nthat when someone says hey this hurts a\nlot this is what pain looks like this is\ndevastating for me why is it that you\ncan't hear what they're saying because\nchances are you have probably\nexperienced the exact same thing that\nthat person is experiencing because I\nwould bet money that if you are an\n towards people who are victims\nof non-consensual pornography there have\nbeen times in your life where you told\nsomeone else hey I am really suffering\nand everyone ignored you what did people\ntell you especially if you're a man you\ndon't deserve to suffer what are you\ncomplaining about it comes with the\nterritory because this is what we tell\nmen who suffer you're privileged right\nand so what happens to us we hear this\nstuff we reach out for help we say hey\nI'm hurting and the World Turns to us\nand says screw you you should be able to\nhandle it comes with the territory the\nworld has treated us like so we're going\nto turn around and treat other people\nlike"
