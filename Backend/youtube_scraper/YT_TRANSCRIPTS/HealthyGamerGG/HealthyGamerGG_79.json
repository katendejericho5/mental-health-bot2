    "transcript": "the worse your ADHD is at the age of\nlet's say 6 or S the more symptoms of\nADHD you have the more likely you are to\nbe obese at the age of 16 so it turns\nout that these two conditions are very\ntightly connected because in ADHD we\nhave altered reward processing which\nmeans that the dopamine release that we\nget from food is much more potent and is\nmuch more likely to lead to obesity on\nthe flip side we tend to think of fat\ncells or adipocytes as cells that are\njust storage but they're not storage\nthey're actually hormonally active and\nit turns out that fat cells actually\nproduce certain chemical signals that\nwill worsen ADHD there's this chemical\ncalled brain derived neurotrophic factor\nwhich is something that literally\nstimulates growth of neurons and what we\nknow is that kids who have low bdnf are\nmore likely to develop ADHD and it turns\nout that the more fat cells you have the\nmore that they interfere or stop the\nproduction of bdnf"
