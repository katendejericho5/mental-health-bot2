    "transcript": "how do people change if you want to\nchange let's start by understanding how\npeople change is doing stuff how people\nchange hold on a second let's think\nabout that doing stuff is not how people\nchange it's what it looks like after you\nchange do you all get that\nthe doing stuff comes after the change\nnot before the change so this is really\ngreat because if you're just a watcher\nyou can actually change and then you can\nstart doing stuff but all you have to do\nis watch so what I'm going to do is make\nsort of a leap which I think is a fair\nleap to make I'm going to substitute the\nword change with the word learn so if we\nlook at like fundamentally in our brain\nwhat parts of our brain govern changing\nit's the same parts of our brain that\ngovern learning right so I'll give you a\nsimple example let's say that I burn my\nhand on a hot stove next time around do\nI burn my hand again no I've changed my\nbehavior what circuits in the brain\ngovern that kind of change the learning\ncircuits of the brain"
