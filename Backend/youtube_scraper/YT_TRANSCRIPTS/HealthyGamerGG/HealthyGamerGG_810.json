    "transcript": "so if we really think about it when we\nconquer our desire to play video games\nand we engage in another Behavior there\nis no no reward in fact what we actually\nexperience is punishment from that\nbehavior and if we are if the our brain\nexperiences punishment when we go to the\ngym or when we're productive what kind\nof behavior do you think it's going to\navoid and what kind of behavior do you\nthink we're going to reinforce\nhere if you want to get control of your\nlife and understand how the mind works\ncheck out a DIY guide to mental health\nthe link is in description huh\nI want to talk to you all today about\nhow to stop playing video games this is\nsomething that I struggled with a lot\nand a lot of the people in our community\nhave talked about this a lot where you\nknow you know you should be doing stuff\nbesides playing video games or maybe\nusing the internet or social media and\nwe kind of know in the back of our mind\nthat we should be more productive maybe\nI should be exercising maybe I should\nlearn how to cook maybe I should do my\nschoolwork maybe I should work on my\nresume there are all kinds of things\nthat we know we should be doing the\nproblem though is that video games are\nactually just way more fun right where\nthat's why they sort of become addictive\nbecause any moment that we spend playing\na video game there's going to be some\nkind of reward whereas all this other\nstuff that we should be doing for some\nreason it's just really hard to motivate\nourselves to do that and so what do we\nend up doing we end up trying to conquer\nthat desire we wake up in the morning\nand the first thought in my mind is okay\nlike I want to play games today I don't\nwant to work on my resume I don't want\nto exercise I don't want to do any of\nthis stuff and if you're like me what\nyou end up doing is fighting with\nyourself right you try to conquer that\ndesire you try to use willpower and\ndiscipline and you win for a day or\nmaybe two but if you're like me\neventually the the real challenge is\nthat you know you're going to lose right\nso you can conquer that desire with\nwillpower on day one you can conquer\nthat desire with willpower on day two\nmaybe even day three or day four but\ninevitably you're going to slip right\nyou're going to go back to the video\ngame and the challenge that I faced and\nmaybe you feel this way too is that\nconquering your desires to play games\nfeels like a war that you will\neventually lose sure you can win a\nbattle here you can win a battle there\nbut that desire to play the game in that\nconstant struggle that you have is never\ngoing to go away and so what I'd love to\nshare with you all today is actually how\nto change that because what I've\ndiscovered and this is what's so bizarre\nis that you can actually change that and\nI know that if you sound kind of\nskeptical of that let me just start by\nsharing a story from a patient that I\nworked with as an addiction psychiatrist\nso I don't know if you'll know this but\nyou know alcohol is quite addictive so I\nnoticed something really strange when I\nwas working with patients who are sober\nwhich is that once they were sober for a\nwhile they started to make really weird\nstatements like they would say yeah I\ndon't even think about alcohol anymore\nit's not actually a problem at all I\ndon't even want to drink and I got\nreally confused by that because I had\nsort of been raised to believe that the\nwhole point of being addicted to alcohol\nis that you have this genetic\npredisposition you have these like\nchemicals in your brain and these\nneurotransmitters and neurons that make\nyou addicted to the substance that you\ncrave the substance you want the\nsubstance and despite the fact that it\nruined your entire life you can't resist\nthe substance and so I started to wonder\na little bit wait hold on a second\nwhat's going on here because these\npeople aren't sober anymore through\nwillpower they're not sober through\nconquering their desire something has\nchanged about the way that their desire\nmanifests or more importantly they\nactually desire to not drink anymore and\nso what I'd love to share with you all\ntoday is how to shape your desire that\nyou no longer even want to play video\ngames that may sound absolutely insane\nbut actually it's quite simple and the\nmain principle that we're going to focus\non today is behavioral reinforcement so\nlet's start by understanding behavioral\nreinforcement within video games\nso generally speaking we have the\ncircuit uh in the brain or this part of\nour brain called the nucleus accumbens\nand the nucleus accumbens is a very\ndopaminergic circuit so usually what\nhappens is when dopamine is released in\nthe nucleus accumbens it reinforces a\nbehavior we want to do it more and the\nsubjective feeling of reinforcement in\nthe nucleus accumbens is actually\nenjoyment pleasure so when we sort of\ntalk about all this dopaminergic stuff\nlike social media or video games or\nthings like that we enjoy doing it and\nthose behaviors get reinforced which is\nwhy they're so hard to kick and this is\nthe basic problem with video games right\nis that they're fun so every time we\nplay them that circuit of our brain gets\nactivated we get a little Spurt of\ndopamine and then the behavior gets\nreinforced the next day when we wake up\nwe're thinking about video games we want\nto play video games because our brain\nour nucleus accumbens is like hey we\nneed more dopamine so let's play again\nand so then we fall into this trap of\nokay since I have this natural impulse\nto play the video game that's what my\nnucleus accumbens wants I try to\nrestrict it I try to conquer I try to\ncontrol it and so let's understand a\nlittle bit about what happens in terms\nof reinforcement when we actually\ncontrol the impulse to play a video game\nso let's say I wake up in the morning\nand I want the video game I want that\ndopamine energy expert but I decide not\nto so I use my willpower I activate my\nfrontal lobes and I control the desire\nand then what I'll do I'll say okay I\nneed to be productive so I will go and\nexercise I'm going to go to the gym\ntoday so then I go to the gym and I work\nout for I was planning on going for an\nhour but I'm kind of deconditioned\nbecause I play games all day so after\nabout 20 minutes I'm huffing and puffing\nand then I come home because I'm\nexhausted right so I want you all to\nthink about that for a second what do\nyou think I'm actually reinforcing in\nthat moment do you think that I'm saying\nto myself yeah I went to the gym today\nno actually I feel terrible I feel out\nof breath I feel ashamed because I was\ngoing to work out for an hour and I\ncould only last 20 or 25 minutes I feel\nkind of embarrassed with myself I don't\nreally feel good so if we really think\nabout it what am I actually doing in\nthat moment am I actually reinforcing\nthe desire to exercise\nabsolutely not the same is true for\nsomething like being productive for a\nday right so let's say I I have a test\nthat's a week from today and I decide\nthat I'm not going to procrastinate\nright so I'm going to study for a little\nwhile so I get up and I I force myself\nto study and I study for two or three\nhours and how do I feel at the end of\nthat study do I actually feel great\nabout myself usually no I start to think\nall these kinds of thoughts like man\nlike I can't believe that I have to so\nmuch work to do I wish I'd gotten\nstarted earlier there are all kinds of\nthoughts that I have but I usually don't\nfeel great I don't think at the end of\nthose two hours man I'm definitely going\nto get an A a week from now right this\nis I'm doing so awesome so if we really\nthink about it when we conquer our\ndesire to play video games and we engage\nin another Behavior there is no no\nreward in fact what we actually\nexperience is punishment from that\nbehavior and if we are if the our brain\nexperiences punishment when we go to the\ngym or when we're productive what kind\nof behavior do you think it's going to\navoid and what kind of behavior do you\nthink we're going to reinforce so even\nspurts of productivity are spurts of\ndoing the right thing actually leads to\navoidance by our brain we actually start\nto avoid productive stuff because we\nactually don't enjoy it at all when we\ndo it and this is what actually happens\nis we can fall into this cycle where I\ntry to resist the video game I resist\nfor a day or two it doesn't really work\nout and then I I crash right so I\nrelapse I start playing again and then I\nhave to resist again so I muster up all\nmy willpower and energy but the second\ntime around it feels harder to kick the\nhabit and the third time around it feels\neven harder to kick the habit and the\nmore that you try to kick the habit the\nharder it becomes and if you kind of\nthink about that wait like that's so\nweird why is that it's because each time\nyou try to kick the habit and you fail\nto a certain degree or it's too\ntemporary what you're actually doing is\npunishing yourself because all you're\ndoing is paying the cost without\nactually seeing any benefit so let's\njust think about exercise for a second\nright how many days do you have to go to\nthe gym to actually see positive\nreinforcement from the gym right it's\ngot to be months it's not going to be a\ncouple of days it's not going to be a\ncouple of weeks we're talking about\nthree months four months five months six\nmonths and if we look at it through the\nlens of reinforcement we can now see why\ngoing to the gym is hard because every\nday that we go to the gym we actually\nfeel worse and there's this alluring\nvideo game over here that we can kind of\ntap into at any point and it'll give us\nthat straight Spurt of dopamine so this\nis the first thing that we have to\nunderstand is that overcoming video game\naddiction is not actually positively\nreinforcing it's actually punishing and\nover time can induce our brains to avoid\nproductivity instead of video games\nso now the question becomes okay what do\nwe do about it so our strategy has to be\none where we start reinforcing the right\nkinds of behaviors instead of when we\nengage in a behavior actually being\npunished for it we need to cultivate\nparticular ways to where our brain can\nactually enjoy the activity and that\nstarts with first of all catching your\ncreative impulses so if you're like me\npart of what you may have experienced is\nthat there are times throughout the day\nwhen you do get a little bit excited\nabout things that are not video games\nmaybe you get excited about reading a\nparticular book or maybe you get excited\nabout I don't know painting or maybe you\ndo get excited you watch some workout\nvideo or something or you see someone\ncanoeing and you're like man that would\nbe a lot of fun to go canoeing or go\nswimming there are these impulses that\nwe have towards the right behaviors now\nthis is really important because these\nimpulses come naturally they're not\nsomething that we have to force\nourselves into so this is not like\navoiding a video game to go exercise\nthis is sort of catching a natural\nimpulse in my case it's writing so\nthat's kind of what I'm going to focus\nfocus on but you can absolutely apply\nthis to whatever your creative impulse\nis or what kind of impulses you have so\nI started by simply jotting things down\nso the first thing that we're going to\ndo is if you have some kind of impulse\ntry to capture it in some way so I\nstarted carrying around a notebook I\ninstalled a Notes app on my phone and\nwhat I what I started doing was just\ncapturing my thoughts I started taking\nsome of that creative impulse and\nactually turning it into something so\nthat's actually step one is that when we\nhave that creative impulse we want to\ncapture it and we want to put it down\ninto something now this does a couple of\nthings the first thing that it does is\nit trains us to start engaging in things\nthat are not video games since we\nalready have that impulse we don't have\nto overcome anything but we can kind of\ncapture it and we want to sort of get\nstarted with some kind of work the\nsecond thing that this does is gives us\nan opportunity for something to reflect\non and that's going to be the second\nstep that we do so if we think a little\nbit about how can we start to encourage\nour minds to have the right kind of\nDesire I want you to imagine a scenario\nlet's say that a friend of yours is\nthinking about I don't know writing a\nmaking a video game and as they start\ntelling you about the video game you can\nget excited about it too so you may want\nto give them suggestions you may want to\nsay oh hey I think you should have this\nI think you should add that and then you\nkind of get excited about it the two of\nyou all talk about it maybe even talk a\nlittle bit about collaborating and now\nsuddenly there's excitement there's\ndesire and if we kind of think about it\nwhat triggered that desire what\ntriggered the desire was the input that\nyour friend gave you your friend started\ntalking about the video game that they\nmade so if we want to cultivate the\nright kinds of desires we need the right\nkinds of inputs and this is why writing\nstuff down can be incredibly important\nso what I started doing is writing stuff\ndown and then I would reflect on it\nright so I would pause and I would look\nat it sometimes I would read it so this\nis where a lot of people fall short\nbecause they may try to capture that\ncreative impulse but then if you never\nreflect on it or never turn it into\nanything what is that actually going to\nreinforce what that's what your brain\nwill actually learn is that there is no\npoint in writing these things down\nbecause we never turned it into anything\nit's actually a complete waste of our\ntime you spent 15 minutes writing\nsomething down and then a year later you\ndid nothing with it so then your brain\nactually reinforces hey this is a waste\nof time we actually should not capture\nour creative impulses so how do you\nswitch that around you actually spend\ntime reflecting on it if you write for\n15 minutes and you wake up the next day\nand you read what you wrote what you'll\nstart to discover is that your mind will\nbe sparked in the right way you'll start\nto have more and more desires you just\nlove to think about it maybe you feel\ninspired to write a little bit more and\nso as you start to reflect on things\nyou're actually giving your brain the\nright kinds of inputs that will get you\nexcited and then once again you\ncapitalize on those inputs so the second\nthing that we really have to learn how\nto do is reflect on whatever our\ncreative impulses are in the case of\nsomething like exercise you can still\nreflect on it even if you don't feel\ngood about it you can sort of pause\nafter you go to the the gym and you can\nkind of start to ask yourself some\nquestions you can say okay well how do I\nfeel about what happened today instead\nof actually defaulting to oh man this\nwas an absolute mess and you know\nthere's no way we're ever going to do\nthis again stop and pause and reflect\nand think a little bit critically what\ndo I like about today what are the wins\ntoday and what are the losses today\nbecause here's the wild thing if you\nactually go to the gym for the first\ntime and you spend 25 minutes there\nthat's actually a huge W right for the\nfirst day you exercised and that's\nactually a huge win but unless we're\ncareful unless we reflect properly what\nwe end up actually doing is punishing\nourselves for going to the gym because\nwe don't see it as a w all we see are\nall of the thousand things that we did\nwrong right all we actually experience\nis all these negative thoughts I should\nhave gone a year ago I should have gone\nlonger I can't believe I'm so weak you\nknow why am I wasting my time because\nthis is actually what your brain is\nlearning so how do you change the\nlearnings you change the learnings by\nactually reflecting on it once you start\nreflecting on the exercise you'll start\nto see okay well actually you know at\nleast it was a win that I went today I\nwent for 20 minutes today if I'm lucky I\ncan go for 20 minutes tomorrow or maybe\nI can shoot for 25 minutes everyone's\ngoing to start gotta start somewhere and\nas you start to go through that\ncognitive process you actually start to\npositively reinforce the desire to\nexercise\nthe third thing that we're going to talk\na little bit about is honestly\noriginally I thought that this was kind\nof BS okay and that is practicing\ngratitude so I heard about all this\npractice and gratitude crap when I\noriginally got into alternative medicine\nand especially when I was becoming a\npsychiatrist and even as a psychiatrist\nI thought that practice and gratitude\nwas like a waste of everyone's time I\nreally did not understand it because in\nmy mind here's what I kind of discovered\nwas like okay people are like telling me\nI should be grateful for stuff but why\non Earth would I be grateful about\nanything when I have all of this crap\nthat I need to do you know all my mind\nwould see are all the things that need\nto get done I can't spend time being\ngrateful for the tiny little portion of\nthing that I do things that I do right\nwhen I've got a bunch of stuff that I\nneed to be doing better so every fiber\nof my being thought that practice and\ngratitude was BS but as I've grown and\nlearned this is actually a huge huge\nhuge part of cultivating the right kind\nof Desire so what is practicing\ngratitude do so if we go back to our gym\nexample let's say that I went to the gym\nfor 20 minutes planning on going for an\nhour and now I come home I feel ashamed\nof myself and I feel weak so let's pause\nfor a second did I actually do the right\nthing today and the answer is\nunequivocally yes right because I got up\noff my ass I went to the gym and I\nexercised at least for 20 minutes that\nis way way way better than sitting at\nhome and playing video games even if I\nlook at something like writing I used to\nwrite and the first thing that would\nhappen is I would think to myself how\nbad this writing is I would read it the\nnext day I try to reflect\nand all I would see is criticisms in my\nmind I can't believe that it's so bad I\nhave so much work to do I would only see\nthe negatives with my actual progress\nand you think about that for a second\nif all the progress that you make is met\nby negatives in your mind what are you\nactually going to reinforce because\nevery time you actually take a step\nforward your mind punishes you for it\nand so how do we stop that how do we\nmake it so that even if I go to the gym\nfor 20 minutes sure it's 20 minutes or\n25 at least I did it right and that\nanswer is gratitude this is the huge\nvalue of practice and gratitude you need\nto learn how to practice gratitude if if\nwhen you make take the right step\nforward if you make some kind of\nprogress if your mind yells at you about\nall the negativity if it yells at you\nabout how you should have started\nearlier or it's not enough or what will\nother people think or someone else does\nit better than me if your mind responds\nto your step forward with all of these\nnegative thoughts then you need to\npractice gratitude because as your mind\nresponds with all of those thoughts what\nare you actually reinforcing your mind\nis punishing you for making progress in\nlife\nand just think about this because this\nis exactly why we get addicted to video\ngames because when we take a step\nforward if our mind punishes us for\nProgress what do you think we're going\nto end up doing our brain learns our\nnucleus accumbens learns hey we can\nwrite and exercise and learn how to cook\nand try to be social which you remember\nwhen you tried to be social and you were\nfilled with with anxiety and you went to\na party and no one talked to you and it\nwas a really really painful experience\nas soon as you leave does your mind tell\nyou man you made a You made huge\nprogress today right you actually like\ngot up off your ass and you went to a\nparty and sure it was rough but you did\na good job kid like good job that's not\nwhat your mind said your mind says never\nagain and when our mind says never again\nto progress what is it going to say to\nvideo games it's going to say absolutely\nall the time let's go so practicing\ngratitude is the process of any time you\ndo something acknowledging that there\nare negatives acknowledging we're not\nsaying that there isn't a long way to go\nwe're not saying that you know you are\nout of you aren't out of shape like all\nthose things can be true and you can at\nleast appreciate some kind of positive\nright you can say at least I went today\nand once you start cultivating that what\nyou're actually going to be doing is\npositively reinforcing the behavior and\nso if we do these three things if we\nstart by capturing our creative impulses\nor capturing our impulses reflecting on\nour impulses and practice and gratitude\nwhat we will actually do is reinforce\nthese behaviors in our mind as we start\nto reinforce these behaviors in our mind\nour desires begin to change because\nwhere does desire come from it comes\nfrom what's been reinforced in the\nnucleus accumbens since video games are\nso good at reinforcing stuff in the\nnucleus\nsince video games are so good at causing\ndopamine to be released in the nucleus\naccumbens that's literally why we get\naddicted so what we need is to start\ncultivating the right kinds of desires\nand the way that we cultivate the right\nkinds of desires is by actually\nprocessing in the right way are creative\nimpulses reflecting on our creative\nimpulses and even practicing gratitude\nso here's the crazy thing about being\naddicted to video games even when you do\nthe right thing your mind punishes you\nfor it and as long as your mind is\npunishing you for doing the right thing\nit will always be a war that you will\ninevitably lose the way to win this war\nis by actually altering your desires and\nthen the question becomes okay hold on a\nsecond how do I do that and this is the\ncycle that will lead to an alteration of\nyour inborn desire because once I start\ncapturing my creative impulses once I\nstart reflecting on those things and\nonce I start practicing gratitude that\nkind of progress address becomes\npositively reinforced once that progress\nbecomes positively reinforced then my\nmind wants it again right that's the\nwhole point behind the nucleus accumbens\nwhen the nucleus accumbens lights up it\nactually influences our desires the next\nday and this is the problem with video\ngames is that they're so good at\nlighting up the nucleus accumbens the\nmoment they light up the nucleus\naccumbens you've created a desire to\nplay a video game tomorrow a simple way\nof looking at this is when I play a\nvideo game and I have fun what do I want\nto do tomorrow I want to play more of\nthe video game if I play a video game\nand I don't have fun I don't want to\nplay that video game tomorrow so what we\nneed to start doing to create the right\nkind of Desire is to actually pause\nreflect and practice gratitude on our\npositive moment in our positive momentum\nin life and once we start to do that our\nbrain will naturally start to create\ndesires that are sort of good for us\nit'll start to want to exercise man I\nfeel so good after exercising I really\nenjoy cooking I really enjoy writing I I\nreally enjoy hanging out with my friends\nand our natural desires will start to\nchange and once our natural desires\nstart to change this is how we achieve\nthe state of an alcoholic who's in\nlong-term sobriety and doesn't even want\nto touch the alcohol anymore because\nthat's absolutely possible and this is\nthe sequence of events to really shape\nyour desire to no longer even want to\nplay video games"
