    "transcript": "and essentially what's going on here is\nthat I have a thought it leads to a\nparticular action and since the action\nrelieves my mental stress that behavior\nactually gets reinforced so the tricky\nthing about OCD is that the more that we\ngive in to our compulsions the stronger\nthe compulsions become and this is\nactually what's so devastating about it\nis we get stuck in the cycle because the\nonly way that we know how to fix this\nthing is actually by giving into it I am\nseeing in your future something that is\ntransformative helpful and fun\nI don't know what it is but maybe it is\ndown in the link in the description now\nso I want to talk to you all today a\nlittle bit about OCD or obsessive\ncompulsive disorder and I think that\nthis is really important because one of\nthe things I've noticed is that people\nsort of increasingly have anxiety and\npeople are also like somewhat\nperfectionistic so a lot of times people\nask me questions about you know I'm\nanxious all the time or I'm very\nperfectionistic like how do I deal with\nthose kinds of things and one of the\nthings that I found as a psychiatrist is\nthat people don't really know what\nobsessive-compulsive disorder is and\noftentimes what we'll kind of do is\nmislabel it and by mislabeling it what\nwe end up doing is sort of making it\ndifficult for us to like get the\nappropriate treatment or help for it so\nI'd love to talk to you all a little bit\ntoday about OCD and the other reason\nthat this is important is because I\nthink OCD has some of the most unusual\nPsychotherapy\num involved with it so in my experience\nsort of treating people with OCD the\nangle I take in Psychotherapy is I\nactually quite different from how I do\nPsychotherapy for basically everyone\nelse and the reason that I think this is\nimportant is because I think that\nPsychotherapy for OCD gives us an\ninsight into a fundamental skill that is\nprobably the most important thing for\nfor all people so if I had to take one\nskill that I teach people in\nPsychotherapy and I had to if I had to\nteach or if I could teach that to every\nhuman being on the planet what I'd\nactually do is draw that skill from\nPsychotherapy for OCD and the reason for\nthat is because OCD is this this disease\nwhich we'll dive into in a second which\nis all about obsessions so we have\nparticular thoughts that are kind of\nintrusive unwanted or don't sit well\nwith us and compulsions so compulsions\nare actions that we take in response to\nthought so even if you look at the\nNeuroscience of OCD what we sort of know\nabout the Neuroscience of OCD is it's\ncaused by this particular part of the\nbrain that starts with sort of where our\nattention goes so it's a disorder of a\ntension so certain thoughts will\ndominate our mind and then furthermore\nthose thoughts once they once they start\nto dominate our mind will lead to\nbehavior and these are what we call\ncompulsions and these compulsions are so\nsevere that they'll sometimes end up\nhurting us so for example like a really\nclassic thing that people are familiar\nwith is excessive hand washing so I'm so\nconcerned about having germs I have this\nthought in my head oh my God my hands\nare dirty my hands are dirty my hands\nare dirty and even if I know it's\nirrational I can't control that thought\nand the only way I can get rid of that\nthought is to wash my hands with\nblistering hot water and soap seven\ntimes in a row to the point where my\nhands are peeling they're cracked\nsometimes people will even get\ninfections from excessive hand washing\nwhich then launches the OCD into a whole\ndifferent cycle so if we really look at\nOCD we what we sort of know is that in\nthe brain it's kind of involved in this\nthis set of circuitry that sort of\ndictates the connection in between\nthoughts and actions and specifically\nwhat happens in OCD is people have\nthoughts that are so strong that they\nlose control of their actions and so the\nmost important thing about treatment for\nOCD is that we want to teach people how\nto not be controlled by their thoughts\nhow to sever the link between thoughts\nand actions and the reason this is\nimportant for everyone is if there's one\ncore skill that I could teach every\nhuman being on the planet it would be\nhow to separate your thoughts from your\nactions how to act independent of the\nway that you're thinking or feeling and\nalso how to have particular thoughts and\nfeelings which make you feel bad and not\nbe kind of beholden to them enforce\nyourself into action so really good\nexample of this is uh you know unhealthy\nCopic mechanisms so if I have particular\nthoughts or particular feelings let's\nsay I'm feeling lonely let's say I'm\nfeeling unlovable in order to get rid of\nthose thoughts and feelings I may do\nsomething like call an ex who's always\ndown to you know hang out or whatever\neven though they're really toxic for me\nso what we sort of see is that a lot of\nwhat we struggle with in life like I\nwant to play video games today I feel\nbored I don't feel like working so we\nhave all of these internal impulses and\nthen we give in to those internal\nimpulses so oddly enough I think if you\nhad to summarize the goal of OCD\ntreatment it's almost to like make\npeople disciplined and so what that sort\nof means is that this is a\nscientifically verified technique that\nhelps about 83 percent of people\nseparate their thoughts from their\nactions and keep in mind these are\nthoughts that are so powerful and so\noverwhelming that they will lead to\nmajor problems in these persons in these\npeople's lives so we're gonna kind of\nthat's part of the reason that I want to\nteach about OCD and let's kind of dive\ninto a little bit more detail so the\nfirst question is what is OCD so like I\nmentioned earlier OCD is characterized\nby thoughts or obsessions and\ncompulsions so obsessions are basically\nthoughts that have a couple of key\nfeatures the first is generally speaking\nthey're intrusive I.E you don't want to\nthink about them right so you're going\nabout your day and you kind of like or\nenjoy yourself and then suddenly certain\nkinds of thoughts will crop up so good\nexamples like the most common forms of\nOCD intrusive thoughts are things\nrelated to contamination and hygiene so\nsometimes people will kind of feel dirty\nother times it'll be something related\nto Danger so you'll have intrusive\nthoughts about people kind of getting\nhurt or having accidents or things like\nthat one way and part of the reason that\nI think this is important to discuss is\nbecause a lot of times people come in\nand will say I'm anxious about you know\nmy kids getting hurt or I'm always\nworried about bad things happening to\nother people that's not really an\nanxiety disorder for a lot of those\npeople what that really is is OCD so a\npreoccupation with particular people\ngetting hurt yourself getting hurt bad\nthings happening things like that\nanother really important part of OCD is\nthat oftentimes the obsessional thoughts\nthe intrusive thoughts are very like\nimmoral in nature so you'll have\nthoughts about hurting other people\nsometimes they're sexual in nature so\nyou sort of have these thoughts that we\nwould kind of associate with being very\nimmoral or being a degenerate in some\nway so those are some of the really\ncommon ways in which obsessions will\nactually manifest so we're concerned\nabout danger we're concerned about\nhurting other people we're concerned\nabout kind of uh you know forbidden\nthoughts thoughts of contamination\nthings like that\num so the uh the other aspect that's\nimportant to talk about actually is that\nthe other way that people with OCD will\nkind of manifest is with thoughts around\nsymmetry or organization and this is\nwhere we have to draw a really big\ndistinction between OCD and ocpd so OCD\nis obsessive-compulsive disorder and\nocpd is basically what we call being a\ncontrol freak so people with ocpd which\nis obsessive-compulsive personality\ndisorder is actually completely\ndifferent from OCD a lot of times\nnowadays especially on social media\npeople will use statements like oh my\nGod I'm so OCD if anyone rearranges the\nshoes in my house I get completely bent\nout of shape or I need my bathroom\norganized a certain way or I need the\nkitchen organized a certain way and\npeople who are essentially Control\nFreaks and need to have something done\nin a particular way those people are\nocpd OCD once again is a little bit\ndifferent they may be not obsessed they\nmay be sort of very focused on symmetry\nor organization but there's a big\ndifference which is that usually OCD\npeople know or people with OCD know that\nwhat they're asking is irrational they\nkind of recognize that these thoughts\nare intrusive and I don't want it I wish\nI could be okay with some of this stuff\nwhereas ocp ocpd people are are\ncompletely fine with their ocpd they\nactually want everyone to conform to\ntheir way of thinking their thoughts are\nnot intrusive they're not trying to get\nrid of their thoughts they genuinely\nthink that this is the way that things\nshould be and everyone should listen to\nme so this is a key a feature which in\nPsychiatry we call ego syntonic or ego\ndystonic which means is it okay with you\ndo you think that this is actually good\nor do you actually want to get rid of it\nin the case of OCD this is ego disc\ntonic which means that people with OCD\nusually don't like the thoughts they\ndon't like having the thoughts they try\nto actually make the thoughts go away\nand people who are ocpd are ego syntonic\nwhich means that they actually they\ndon't they don't think that anything's\nwrong with them they actually think that\neverything is wrong with other people\nthe shoes need to be arranged this way\nand it's the fact that other people are\nso disorganized and barbaric that they\ndon't want shoes arranged this way but\nthis is the right way to do it and so\nthat's a key differentiating feature so\ngoing back to OCD so we know that we've\ngot kind of obsessions that have four\nparticular types right so contamination\nsymmetry thoughts of danger and\nsometimes kind of like like forbidden or\nBlasphemous or kind of scandalous\nthoughts the other things about these\nthoughts are that they tend to be as we\nmentioned intrusive which means that\nyou're kind of going about your day and\nyou don't want to have those thoughts\nthe thoughts can also be so severe that\nthey're like they impair your focus so\nonce a once an obsession actually crops\ninto your mind like you're not able to\nfocus on other things and this is what\nreally makes OCD like a bad disorder is\nthat along with the obsessions there\ntend to be compulsions so compulsions\nare behaviors that we engage in which we\nmay recognize are irrational so we know\nlike logically that washing my hands\nseven times washing my hands once should\nbe enough like logically I know that if\nI use soap and water like that should be\nsufficient but a key thing about all\nthese compulsions is that they're sort\nof like even though they're illogical or\nsometimes they'll even be sort of\nmagical in nature so I'll give you all\nan example so I had a a patient who\nanytime their family was taking some\nkind of long distance Journey like a car\nride that was over about an hour and a\nhalf or any kind of plane or something\nlike that they had to repeat some kind\nof like mental magical spell in their\nmind and if they said a particular\nstatement to themselves seven times in a\nrow that would mean that whatever kind\nof dangers their family was like exposed\nto would be staved off and if they\ndidn't repeat this prayer seven times in\na row for each person that's traveling\nby the way then something bad was going\nto happen and even if you ask this\nperson like hey what do you think about\nthat they'd say you know I know it makes\nno sense like there's no way that the\nthoughts that I have in my head are\ngoing to determine whether a plane\ncrashes or not but I really have to do\nit because if I don't their plane will\ncrash so there's some amount of\nunderstanding that the compulsions don't\nactually like relate to what people are\ndoing or it's some sort of weird magical\nor mystical connection so compulsions\nare repetitive behaviors that we use\nthat may be a little bit illogical but\nwe feel sort of out of control with them\nright we have a compulsion to do them\nand the key feature here is that the\ncompulsions actually reduce our mental\nstress so if we look at the purpose of\ncompulsions if you talk to someone who\nhas OCD they have particular thoughts\nand then the only way they can get\nrelief from those thoughts the only way\nthey can calm down the thoughts the only\nway they can go back to studying the\nonly way they can enjoy a movie is if\nthey go through the compulsions so\nengaging in the compulsion whether it's\na physical compulsion of like you know\nturning on and off the stove seven times\nthat's a really classic thing or\narranging things in a particular way or\nsometimes we forget that compulsions can\nbe mental in nature too so they don't\neven have to be outward acts that we\nhave to engage in the compulsion and\nthen what happens is once we engage in\nthe compulsion then the obsession kind\nof calms down relaxes or goes away and\nso this is sort of in a nutshell what\nOCD is and we're going to Tunnel down\nkind of a little bit further into\nunderstanding why this is such a problem\nand kind of what's going on here okay so\nthe first thing that I kind of want to\ntouch on is that we sort of know that\nOCD comes from this part of the brain\ncalled the\ncorticostriatal thalamic circuit so\nthere's a particular part of our brain\nwhich is it's a circuit that's involves\nthree or four regions and this thing\nforms a circuit that basically governs\nattention with action and reward so what\nwe're thinking about what we do and what\nwe end up the benefit that we get from\nit and the tricky thing about OCD is\nthat once I have these obsessional\nthoughts once I have all these negative\nthoughts let's say they're like kind of\nforbidden sexual thoughts or something\nlike that I don't want them they're\nintrusive they're distracting me from\nstudying and I feel bad about myself for\nhaving them so that's is another thing\nthat happens with OCD is that people\nwill start to make judgments about\nthemselves for having the thought so if\nI'm having like kind of forbidden sexual\nthoughts I think of myself as a\ndegenerate or a pervert that in in turn\ncan induce things like shame and can\neven lead to some amount of things like\nsuicidality so if I'm sort of having\nthese thoughts that I can't control then\nwhat I sort of discover is that I feel\nso bad for having these thoughts whereas\nif I take a shower if I'm having a\nobsessive intrusive sexual thoughts if I\nshower three times that'll wash away the\nimpurity or wash away the sin and then\nwhat happens is I'm sitting there\nstudying and I have to go into the\nshower and I have to wash three times\nand I leave I come back and then I end\nup like studying for a little while and\nthen the thoughts come back and then I\nhave to go back and I have to shower so\nif we kind of look at what's going on in\nthe brain here we have a particular\namount of mental distress and our brain\nlearns that in order to relieve the\nmental distress what I have to do is\nengage in the compulsion and so this is\nwhy this corticostriot thalamic Circuit\nof our brain kind of gets bent out of\nshape we know that this circuit in our\nbrain becomes hyperactive in people with\nOCD and essentially what's going on here\nis that I have a thought it leads to a\nparticular action and since the action\nrelieves my mental stress that behavior\nactually gets reinforced so the tricky\nthing about OCD is that the more that we\ngive in to our compulsions the stronger\nthe compulsions become and this is\nactually what's so devastating about it\nis we get stuck in the cycle because the\nonly way that we know how to fix this\nthing is actually by giving into it so\nthis is what makes Psychotherapy for OCD\nactually a little bit different when I\nlook at most of my patients that I do\nPsychotherapy for part of what I I sort\nof think about is I want them to\nunderstand themselves right we want to\nunderstand okay what is the origin of\nyour feelings how did you come to feel\nthis way you know what do you believe\nabout yourself there's all kinds of\nstuff offer around identity in the past\nand sort of like understanding like how\nyour mind developed in this way but with\nOCD it's actually a little bit different\nbecause in Psychotherapy for OCD we\nactually don't care about the content so\nwe don't care that you have let's say an\nobsession around\num cleanliness or you have these\nintrusive thoughts that are harmful in\nnature or sexual in nature there are\nsome areas of of psychotherapy that will\ndo that kind of work like so psychonalic\na psychoanalytic perspectives will kind\nof focus on that kind of perspective on\nOCD but generally speaking what what I\nfound to work the best is not to dig\ninto the content of your thoughts so\nwhatever the thought is like we don't\nreally care in a sense right so whether\nyou're worried about cleanliness or\nwhether you're worried about hurting\nother people or whether you're afraid\nthat other people are gonna like their\nplanes are gonna crash the content of\nyour OCD the content of your obsessions\nis not actually the important thing the\nimportant thing that we try to teach in\nPsychotherapy for OCD is actually the\nability to tolerate your negative\nemotions and not give in to the\ncompulsions and the reason that I think\nthat's incredibly important is because\nthat fundamental skill is actually the\nskill that the Buddha yogis and monks\ntry to entrain in India so for thousands\nof years we've had the spiritual\ntradition that is trying to separate out\nour actions from our our be our thoughts\nand so what we try to do in\nPsychotherapy for OCD is as these\nthoughts start to arise within you you\nstart to feel particular things right so\nif I let's say I have a forbidden sexual\nthought so as this thought arises I make\ncertain judgments about myself I feel\nbad I have difficulty focusing I start\nto think of myself as a bad person and\nmy brain has kind of figured out that\nthere's one thing I can do to make these\nthoughts go away which is let's say\nshower three times the tricky thing is\nthat if I shower three times it works\nright so if I go into the shower soap up\neverything wash everything off and then\ngo through that two two more times I may\nstart to get raw skin my skin may start\nto dry out but the thoughts get relieved\nand this is the problem with OCD is that\nessentially what we end up doing is\nharming ourselves through relieving our\nobsessions the only way we know how to\ncalm down our mental struggle or our\nmental anguish is by going through these\nbehaviors and so essentially what we\nwant to teach is the ability to tolerate\nthat negative emotion and not give into\nthe behavior and the reason that I think\nthis is important even if you don't have\nOCD is because this is a fundamental\nskill that everyone needs to learn right\nif we really think about it what causes\nUS problems in life it's essentially a\nlot of mental anguish right so if I\ndon't want to go to a party because I\nfeel embarrassed if I don't want to go\nto a party because there's someone there\nthat I asked out a week ago and it's\ngoing to feel awkward so what do I end\nup doing I end up not going to the party\nI end up using an avoidance strategy to\navoid triggering that negative emotion\nand so then and people with OCD do this\nthe same thing one of the key Hallmarks\nof the actual diagnosis is the\ndevelopment of avoidance behaviors right\nso if certain things will trigger\nobsessional thoughts and then I have to\ngo shower three times then I can't watch\nany TV or anything like that that could\ntrigger even a remotely sexual thought\nand so then what happens with people\nwith OCD is they start to build walls\naround their life and they're not able\nto actually like live a full life\nbecause they're so terrified of\ntriggering the OCD that they start to\navoid particular aspects and we see that\nin in normal people as well that when I\nstart to avoid negative thoughts when I\nstart to avoid particular situations\nwhen I start to avoid putting myself in\nan uncomfortable State I start to close\noff the doors of opportunity in my life\nat the end of the day OCD I think is\nsomething that's that's horribly\nhorribly misunderstood you know at the\ntop of the list the the most important\nthing that's kind of like um relevant to\nOCD is that it's not ocpd so one of the\nthe biggest misnomers is that being a\ncontrol freak is not really what OCD is\nOCD is characterized by having intrusive\npersistent thoughts that are\nego-distonic I.E I don't want to have\nthe thoughts I don't think they're good\nthoughts I don't think they're logical\nthoughts I wish they would just go away\nand the second consequence of OCD or the\nsecond piece of it is some kind of\ncompulsion that our brain figures out\nthat we can either go through a mental\nprocess or a physical process some kind\nof action even if the action is mental\nlike repeating something to myself over\nand over and over again in my head I can\nengage in some kind of action that will\nrelieve the obsession the reason that I\nthink this is really important is\nbecause if you actually ask someone who\nhas OCD what do you feel they'll\ndescribe anxiety so they'll describe oh\nI feel really worried I'm terrified\nthey'll describe a lot of anxiety and\nfear so a lot of times what they think\nis that they've got an anxiety disorder\nor their anxiety is really bad well\ntruly what it is is OCD the other\nproblem with OCD is that as human beings\ntend to do we develop our own intuitive\nadaptations to the OCD and the problem\nwith those adaptations is that those\nadaptations actually cause oftentimes\nmore damage than the OCD itself if I'm\nyou know if I'm kind of like triggered\nby particular things in my surroundings\nthat triggers kind of the obsessional\nthoughts and then the only way I can get\nrid of them is the compulsions the best\nstrategy for me is to avoid big parts of\nlife in general because then I don't\nhave to if the thoughts don't get\ntriggered then I don't have to worry\nabout the compulsions and it's the only\nway that I can feel safe the other big\nproblem with OCD is that oftentimes this\nwhole cycle leads to a lot of Shame so\nthis is where people with OCD will come\ninto my office and they'll describe to\nme oh I'm depressed I'm suicidal but the\nmore that I do a diagnostic evaluation\nin them the more I discover oh this is\nnot a mood disorder this is actually a\nconsequence of untreated OCD which is\nintense shame for these intrusive\nthoughts that we never asked for but\nsince I'm having these thoughts all the\ntime it must make me a bad person right\nI must be a degenerate and the only\nthing that I can think of is to take my\nown life to provide relief and protect\nthe world from how awful I am so OCD\noftentimes masquerades as lots of other\nthings the last thing to consider is\nthat in terms of psychotherapy for OCD I\nthink it's really important because the\nskills that we teach in Psychotherapy\nfor OCD I think are the most\ngeneralizable to the rest of the\npopulation and what we really kind of\nTarget or focus on is this idea that if\nyou feel mentally unwell within your\nbeing that there are always actions in\nthe outside world that you can take and\nthose actions that you take in the\noutside world can actually relieve the\nmental distress within right so if I'm\nfeeling mentally unwell or if I'm\nbothered by the asymmetry of my\nworkplace I can spend 15 minutes\norganizing everything and that makes me\nfeel better the problem is that every\ntime I do that what I'm essentially\ntraining my mind to do is to solve\ninternal discomfort with external\nactions right I'm training my mind that\nthe only way to get rid of this internal\nfeeling is to act in a particular way\nand we see this a lot in our community\nlet's say like I'm procrastinating right\nI feel bad about myself I feel bad that\nI'm not studying and I should be\nstudying and I want an A and the only\nway I can manage these emotions is to\nengage in some kind of unhealthy\nBehavior so I'm going to spend the day\ngaming I'm going to procrastinate and\nbinge watch some anime I'm gonna do\nsomething I'm gonna spend some time on\nTwitter or social media I'm gonna do\nsome anything but what I the work that I\nneed to do and so if you look at like\nthis fundamental idea of okay if you do\nthis what is your brain what is your\ncorticostrito thalamic portion of your\nbrain what does that circuit learn about\nthe solution to feeling fat on the\ninside what it learns is that oh the\nnext time we feel bad we should actually\njust start playing a video game because\nthat's what fixes our problems right\nthat's what leads to a relief if you\nthink about if there's a reward\ncircuitry involved here I'm feeling bad\nand if I engage in a behavior that\nbehavior gets reinforced because the\nreward is really good I don't feel bad\nabout myself if I start playing a video\ngame and so what we actually end up\ndoing is reinforcing the negative\nbehavior and that circuit seems to be\nwhat's hyperactive in OCD so this has\nbeen a kind of a really quick overview\nof OCD there's a lot more that we could\ntalk about in terms of the the details\nof like what Psychotherapy for OCD is\nlike the Neuroscience of OCD is really\nfascinating even psychoanalytic\nperspectives on OCD are really\nfascinating but this is kind of a quick\noverview that I really wanted to share\nwith you all to really help you\nunderstand a little bit about what OCD\nis why it's so devastating and a little\nbit about even how treatment for OCD can\nbe useful for every human being on the\nplanet I saw that uh"
