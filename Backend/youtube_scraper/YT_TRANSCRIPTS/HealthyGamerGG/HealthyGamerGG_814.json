    "transcript": "so if I'm sitting in this computer chair\nall day right and I'm not like\nexercising or anything like that if I'm\nnot physically active what I've actually\nseen an alarming amount of is young\npeople that have like blood pressure\nproblems so I'm talking about 20 year\nolds 25 year olds that will have\nsymptomatic dizziness when they stand up\nfrom their computer chair because\nthey've been sitting in the computer\nchair all day there are many people who\nwill offer solutions for life do this\nand you will be happy do that and be\nhappy it is my opinion that you must\nunderstand yourself first that is why we\nmade Dr K guide check it out nah so\nlet's talk a little bit about brain fog\nso I think brain fog is an increasingly\nimportant thing to discuss because it\nseems to be like rapidly Rising so we\nknow that for example uh 19 out of 20\npeople on the planet now have basically\nhad kovid we also know that about 10\npercent of people or up to about 10 the\nnumbers probably closer to seven or\neight percent are people who have covid\nhave brain fog but we also know that\nbrain fog seem seems to be increasing\nlike across the board and the reason\nthat this is such a big problem is\nbecause brain fog is one of the worst\nthings to have for a couple of reasons\nthe first is that if you have brain fog\nand you go see a medical professional\nchances are they'll like punt you\nsomewhere like they'll tell you to go\nsee a therapist or they won't really\ngive you any sort of constructive help\nright so if you go to a doctor and you\nsay well like I've got you know my my\nbrain doesn't seem to be working quite\nright well first of all like what does\nthat even mean and then the doctor May\norder some kinds of tests right they may\nsort of check to see if you have an\ninfection they may sort of check your\nblood counts they may check a couple of\nthings but at the end of the day brain\nfog really isn't a diagnosable condition\nand it also appears to not really be a\ntreatable condition so a lot of times\nwhat happens when people struggle with\nbrain fog which by the way can be like\nincredibly debilitating so when we talk\nabout rain fog what we're sort of\ntalking about is like difficulties with\nconcentration difficulties with short\nand long-term memory usually more\nshort-term memory so people are\nincredibly forgetful people tend to find\nthat they require lot more effort to do\nlike basic cognitive tasks so studying\nis harder work is harder it just seems\nto be kind of like incredibly\ndebilitating without sort of having any\nkind of like um you know Smoking Gun in\nterms of what's causing it so oftentimes\nwe sort of accept that like okay yeah\nlike if I've got the flu or covid that's\nthe reason it's hard for me to work but\nthe problem with brain fog is that it\ntends to persist for very long periods\nof time doesn't have a clear cause and\nthen even if we go seek help from\nmedical professionals oftentimes they'll\norder some tests or maybe evaluate us\nbut then they don't really have any sort\nof like treatment or anything\nsignificant they can do to help us which\nis exactly why it's so frustrating the\nother thing that tends to be kind of\nunfortunate in a lot of ways is that a\nlot of times if you go see a medical\ndoctor and they can't find something\nwrong with you but you are still\nstruggling and those the ways in which\nyou are struggling are not testable\nright so this isn't something like I've\ngot wheezing in my chest or my blood\npressure is very high or my heart rate\nI've got an arrhythmia I have a rash or\nsomething like that if it's something\nlike cognitive what usually medical\ndoctors will do is if they can't sort of\nfind something very specific what\nthey're going to do is send you to a\nmental health professional they'll refer\nyou to a psychiatrist because if we\ncan't find what's wrong with your body\nit sort of must be in your head or the\nbest doctors will still sort of\nacknowledge that it's psychosomatic\nwhich we'll get to in a minute but\nthey'll sort of send you to a mental\nhealth professional and then the problem\nkind of becomes okay so let's say I go\nsee a therapist whereas like if you I\ndon't know if you guys know this but as\nas you've trained to become a therapist\nyou get a total of zero hours of\ntraining in how to deal with with brain\nfog right it's like it's not a DSM\ndiagnosis so it's not like a psychiatric\nillness which is what people are trained\nin we're trained in stuff like trauma\nand anxiety and depression but brain fog\nreally isn't something that we're taught\nabout and so then the problem is that\nthe answer that you're kind of given is\nmental health help which can be helpful\nin some ways but then the other problem\nis that as we learn learn as we'll sort\nof discover today brain fog actually is\nnot a psychiatric illness there's a lot\nof strong evidence that it is actually\nphysiologic in nature and neurologic in\nnature so the solutions that people with\nbrain fog are being given are ones that\nare actually like not very useful like\nscientifically so let's kind of tunnel\ndown into this and understand a little\nbit more about what brain fog is and\nwhat we can do about it so the good news\nis that we do have a lot of research\nrecently into sort of what causes brain\nfog or what are some of the culprits and\nthe neat thing about that is as we\ndiscover what the mechanisms of brain\nfog are will also naturally start to\ndiscover what are some potential\nSolutions so let's kind of dive into\nthis okay so brain fog first of all\nappears to be increasing so as we kind\nof tunnel down into this people as brain\nfog has been sort of On The Rise and as\npeople have been sort of getting covered\nwhat we've discovered is that like the\ninterest in brain fog is increasing the\nresearch in brain fog is increasing and\nthere are a couple of key things that\nwe've learned the first is that brain\nfog seems to be associated with\ninflammation and specifically Mast Cell\ninflammation okay now this is important\nfor a couple of reasons the first is\nthat if things are inflammatory in\nnature first of all we sort of can kind\nof infer that they're not psychiatric in\nnature or there's that gets a little bit\ncomplicated but there seems to be a\nphysiologic cause and specifically the\ntarget seems to be mast cells so there's\na lot of evidence that shows that mast\ncells are actually correlated with the\nextent of brain fog and what we sort of\nhave discovered is that brain fog\nappears to be like inflammation\nspecifically within our central nervous\nsystem or brain so I don't know if you\nguys have sort of felt that like you\nknow if you get the flu or covet or some\nkind of infection and you have this\nwhole body inflammation or if you have\nsomething like lupus what you're going\nto experience is some amount of\ncognitive impairment right you don't\nfeel quite as energetic it's hard to\nstudy it's hard to focus your short-term\nmemory will be negatively impacted and\nso we sort of know that inflammation can\ncause these problems and we also know\nfrom lots of research that mast cells\nseem to be in implicated the other thing\nthat's kind of interesting is that this\ninflammation also seems to be associated\nwith obesity now I know that there's a\nlot of tension on the internet nowadays\naround fat phobia and things like that\nI'm not trying to be fat phobic or or\nplace value judgments on people who are\noverweight but what we do know this is\nsomething that a lot of people don't\nrealize is that adipocytes or fat\nstorage cells in our body are not just\nstorage they're actually\nendocrinologically active and\nimmunologically active so that means is\nthat the number of adipocytes or the\nsize of adipocytes that we have in our\nbody correlates with a certain amount of\ninflammatory activity or correlates with\nsome amount of endocrine activity so we\nknow that these are not just benign\nstorage parts of our body they're\nactually physiologically active and can\nactually lead to inflammation okay and\nwe also know that obesity is actually\ncorrelated with brain fog a couple of\nother things that we sort of have\ndiscovered is that when it comes to the\nMass cells the mast cells are actually\neither on themselves or right next to\nthe mess mast cells we have these things\ncalled crh receptors and crh is\nessentially a stress uh it's not a\nstress hormone itself but it's a it's a\nsignal that causes the release of a\nstress hormone so what we sort of know\nis that here we've got our crh receptor\nand let's say here's a mast cell and so\nin crh comes in over here it activates\nthe Mast Cell the key thing here is that\nif we say Okay inflammation is one of\nthe causes of brain fog and it's\nmediated through the mast cell what\ntriggers the Mast Cell well it seems\nthat stress specifically crh is one of\nthe key things that induces Mast Cell\nActivation which then in turn leads to\nbrain fog symptoms okay you may say well\nlike what's the point of all this all\nright like I don't understand why we're\nlearning this science well the reason\nwe're learning the science is because\nhopefully as we start to understand the\nmechanisms this will also open the path\nto understanding how we can sort of\ncombat brain fog okay the next thing\nthat's kind of really interesting is\nthat brain fog is also associated with a\ncondition called pots so pots is\npostural orthostatic hypotension\nsyndrome which is essentially a\ncondition that has to do with low blood\npressure specifically that is postural\nin nature so if you want to get kind of\na quick understanding of what it feels\nlike to have Pots if you are laying down\nin bed and you jump upright out of bed\nfirst of all don't do this if you've got\nblood pressure problems because you\ncould fall over but if you jump right up\nwhat you'll sometimes notice is that if\nyou stand up Suddenly you'll start to\nget a little bit of dizziness and what\nthis sort of what was responsible for\nthe dizziness is that as we stand up the\nblood flow to our brain actually\ndecreases and it takes a few seconds for\nour heart and our our vasculature to\nkind of adjust to the effect of gravity\nbecause remember that when we're laying\ndown right so we're not really fighting\nagainst gravity but when we stand up now\nour heart and blood vessels actually\nhave to pump blood this way to sort of\nget to cerebral to increase cerebral\nperfusion or to get blood flow to our\nbrain so some of y'all may have\nexperienced that if you stand up\nSuddenly you'll feel dizzy for a second\nor two and then your body essentially\ncompensates what happens in people with\npots is that their ability to compensate\nis somehow impaired so when they stand\nup or sit up they tend to have low blood\npressure which impacts their cerebral\nblood flow the key thing here is that we\nknow that brain fog is associated with\nlow cerebral perfusion which is a fancy\nway of saying we know that people with\nbrain fog actually have less blood going\nto their brain okay so there's or it\nrequires more blood flow to complete\nparticular cognitive tasks so the other\nway to kind of think about it is if\nyou've got one person with brain fog and\none person without brain fog the amount\nof blood that this person needs to\ncomplete a memory task is higher versus\nthe amount of blood that this person\nneeds is relatively lower so people with\nbrain fog there seems to be be something\naround cerebral perfusion as a cause of\nbrain fog another thing that's really\ninteresting is that as people have sort\nof looked at certain chemical compounds\nand they've essentially found that\nflavonoids and specifically something\ncalled luteolin seems to reduce\ninflammation has a neuroprotective fact\nand appears to improve brain fog okay\nnow we got to talk about flavonoids and\nludiolin for a second something has been\nhappening recently with our diet so we\nknow that for example people are eating\nmore processed foods which is a part of\nthe problem but one of the reasons why I\nthink that brain fog is actually getting\na lot worse is because of the the way in\nwhich our food is actually grown so over\nthe last let's say 20 to 50 years we've\nstarted to use a lot of fertilizers and\nI'm not like anti-gmo or anything like\nthat but we have selected for vegetables\nand so flavonoids are oftentimes found\nfrom green leafy vegetables so the the\nrate at which vegetables are being grown\nis actually increasing so you used to\ntake let's say like six months to grow a\ncrop of spinach and now we've really\naccelerated their growth rate using\ncertain kinds of genetic modifications\nand fertilizers and the result of that\nis that sure it grows really quickly but\nthe nutrient density is actually\ndecreasing so we know that with some\nkinds of food specifically so in some\nways the nutrient density is exactly the\nsame that it used to be but in other\nkinds there are some kinds of nutrients\nwhich the faster you grow the plant the\nless the plant kind of absorbs\nparticular things or is able to create\nparticular things and so what we're\nactually finding is that there's a\ncorrelation between rapid growth or\nrapid growth of a plant is inversely\ncorrelated with its nutrient density and\nthis is something that I sort of\ndiscovered kind of in an interesting way\nso I went hiking last year in Alaska and\nI found some wild raspberries and the\nwild raspberries were like really really\nsmall they're like not nowhere near the\nsize of like the raspberry that you get\nyou know at a grocery store and so we\nwere picking wild raspberries and eating\nthem and like they were super sour like\nthey didn't taste you know as they\ndidn't look as beautiful people they\nsort of like tasted like incredibly sour\nbut there was something oddly delicious\nabout the wild raspberries that when I\nwent back and like got my my Supermarket\nraspberries like sure they were big and\nthey were juicy and they were sweet but\nthere was something that I could almost\nlike tell a difference between like the\nnutrient density between the wild\nraspberry and the one that I could get\nat the supermarket so there is some\nevidence that as\num you know we're sort of having more\nand more rapidly growing foods that\nthere's a correlation with sort of a\ndecrease in nutrient density and this\nbecomes really really important because\nwhen it comes to absorption we only\nabsorb about 10 percent of flavonoids\nfrom our diet so what that means is that\nour body is very very inefficient at\nabsorbing some of these compounds which\nin turn means that if we're reducing the\nnutrient density from our Foods it makes\nit like sort of like since our our\nabsorption is so low if we kind of cut\nthe nutrient density in half we're\nending up with a lot less of these\ncompounds in our diet and then as a\nresult we're sort of having less of this\ninflammatory protective effect in\nneuroprotective effect a couple of other\nthings that we've sort of found that are\nassociated with brain fog are poor sleep\nso about 90 percent of people with brain\nfog will uh report having poor sleep or\ninsufficient sleep and then the last\nthing that's kind of interesting is that\nwe also know that dehydration appears to\nbe correlated with brain fog as well and\nin one study 88 percent of people who\nhad brain fog qualified or reported some\ndegree of dehydration so this is kind of\ninteresting right because now we're\nstarting to see that first of all and I\nwant to show you all one other thing\njust directly from a paper there's also\num some evidence that so just to kind of\nthe last thing is what about things like\ndepression so there's actually some\nstudies that have specifically examined\npsychiatric comorbidities and uh brain\nfog and what they've actually found is\nthat psychiatric comorbidities are not a\nassociated with the cognitive impairment\nof brain fog at least in certain\ninflammatory conditions this is a paper\nabout Cog chronic fatigue syndrome so we\nknow that brain fog that's sort of\ncaused by these like\na sort of mysterious inflammatory\nconditions appear to be not psychiatric\nin nature which is really really\nimportant I think this is actually\nwhat's really unfortunate is because\nlike a lot of times doctors will send\npeople to mental health professionals to\ndeal with brain fog because they sort of\ndon't know what else to do and if we\ncan't figure out what's wrong with you\nlet's send you to a therapist because\nthey'll be able to sort it out but as we\ntake a look at this what we actually\nfind is that there's a lot of\nphysiologic sources of brain fog so now\nlet's take a look at these six things\nand try to understand a little bit about\nokay like if these are the causes of\nbrain fog and that's it you know we're\nnot quite there yet so this is just some\nevidence that implicates these are some\nof the mechanisms what does that tell us\nabout why brain fog is getting worse now\nthat we sort of know these are the\nthings that are involved with brain fog\nyou know what's going on in our society\nwith all these things the first thing is\nthat obesity is on the rise okay so what\nwe're going to do is just take a quick\nlook at these and very simply try to\nfigure out is this this getting worse in\nsociety or not is obesity getting worse\nabsolutely is General inflammation\ngetting worse absolutely is stress\ngetting worse absolutely now here's an\ninteresting one what about blood\npressure right is blood pressure on the\nwhole getting worse and what we actually\ndiscover is that as we are getting to a\nmore and more sedentary lifestyle\nwhat we're starting to do is have a\ndeconditioned cardiovascular system so\nif I'm sitting in this computer chair\nall day right and I'm not like\nexercising or anything like that if I'm\nnot physically active what I've actually\nseen an alarming amount of is young\npeople that have like blood pressure\nproblems so I'm talking about 20 year\nolds 25 year olds that will have\nsymptomatic dizziness when they stand up\nfrom their computer chair because\nthey've been sitting in the computer\nchair all day and so we're seeing that\nthis kind of stuff this sedentary\nlifestyle is actually getting worse as\nwell\num the other thing that we sort of\nmentioned already is that there's let's\nsay vague non-conclusive but strongly\nsuggestive data that our diet as a whole\nis getting worse and this isn't just\nabout processed foods this is also about\nthe lack of nutrient density in a lot of\nour fruits and vegetables is sleep\ngetting worse absolutely right so as\ntechnology usage gets worse we've got\nissues with blue light impaired\nmelatonin production low quality sleep\nright not to mention all these other\nthings like lack of physical exercise\nand and stress and stuff like that that\nsleep on the on the hole is getting\nworse and what about dehydration are we\nas a whole getting dehydrated and this\nis one where I'd say like I'm not really\ntoo sure so we do know for example that\num in one study specifically on pots\nthat 88 of people are associated or who\nhave brain fog also will sort of endorse\nsome degree of dehydration and this is\nalso important from a blood pressure\nstandpoint because proper hydration is\none of the most important ways to keep\nour blood pressure up specifically when\nsomeone has been in like a car accident\nor something like that to keep blood\ngoing to people's brain what we'll sort\nof do is is use two wide bore\nIVs to pump in Saline or blood products\ninto people so one of the ways that we\nmaintain blood pressure in the brain is\nby actually like injecting people with\nsaline right so we sort of like give\nthem bunches and bunches of fluid and as\nwe increase their fluid it maintains\ntheir cerebral perfusion so what we're\nsort of seeing in in society today is I\nthink we're seeing an increase in\ncaffeine intake which is dehydrating and\nthis is especially a problem for people\nwith brain fog because what we sort of\nfound is that some people will treat\nbrain fog with things like stimulants\nbut what I've really found is that a lot\nof people who are struggling to focus\nwhat are they going to do they're going\nto drink coffee right so we see that\nbrain fog is oftentimes associated with\na higher level of caffeine intake and\ngenerally speaking a lot of our diet has\nbecome unhealthy and people may not be\ndrinking enough water it kind of depends\non who you are where you are but one of\nthe things that I've definitely seen\nwith brain fog is an increase in\ncaffeine intake that's almost\ncompensatory that can result in some\namount of dehydration and as we get\ndehydrated what we're actually doing is\npotentially making our blood pressure\nworse okay so now the question becomes\nall right so if this is like what's\nassociated with brain fog like the quick\nquestion is okay what do I do about it\nright and this is where the sort of\nfrustrating thing sometimes when you go\nto a medical professional and they don't\nknow what's wrong with you is they'll\ntell you to just be healthier right\nthey'll say okay if you've got brain fog\nlike why don't you just just do the diet\nand exercise right just exercise more\ndiet more spend less time on your screen\njust get better sleep we're kind of\ngiving these like General like ideas\nabout you know like what you should do\nto get healthy like those are just the\ngenerally healthy things to do and it\ncan be quite devastating because a lot\nof people will have brain fog and\nthey'll go to doctors and they'll go to\ntherapists and people aren't really able\nto help them much\num the good news this is good or bad\nnews depending on how you look at it is\nthat a lot of times you know when people\nhave brain fog they actually end up in\nmy office because you know so prior to\ndoing this whole healthy gamer thing my\nprimary area of Interest was actually\nevidence-based complementary and\nalternative medicine so I was focused a\nlot on sort of scientifically valid\nmeditation techniques yoga techniques\nherbs things like that so I had a clinic\nwhere people would refer their patients\nto me who were interested in like more\nnatural remedies so what I sort of found\nas a clinician is that when people would\npeople would get referred to me a lot\nright so what would happen is like\nsomeone some doctor would be like okay\nokay oh yeah like this person is\ncomplaining of these vague stuff like\nlet's send it to Dr kenoja because Dr\nkenoja handles these people well so\nthere's a psychiatrist this person has\nsomething wrong with their head right so\nlet's send them to a psychiatrist they\nwould come to me and the thing is I'm a\npsychiatrist right so I'm a psychiatrist\nso I'm trained in evaluating people for\nmental illness and as these people come\nto my office and I kind of evaluate them\nand they've got this vague like brain\nfog sort of stuff what I sort of quickly\nconclude is that I don't think this\nperson has mental illness I don't think\nthis person is like ill in their mind I\ndon't think they have anxiety I don't\nthink this is a depression this isn't\nbipolar disorder it's not like their\nmood is very bad kind of is the root\ncause oftentimes what we'll see in brain\nfog is that their mood is bad but that's\nsecondary to being unable to do things\nso it's hard for me to study it's hard\nfor me to work I you know I'm not doing\nas well I'm not progressing my energy\nlevels are low I can't think I can't\nconcentrate that's what causes the low\nmood it's not like the low mood comes\nfirst it's a consequence of then I'm\nkind of stuck in the situation where\nthese people are coming to me for help\nand it's like you know\nI'm kind of the last stop right on the\ntrain to Nowhere let's say and so so I'm\nI'm sort of trying to figure out okay\nhow am I going to help these people and\nthe good news is that actually like I've\nhad really good success I can think of\nmaybe one or two patients and if you're\nwatching this I'm still sorry about not\nbeing able to help you substantially but\nfor the most part I'd say about 80 to 90\nof the people that I've worked with who\nhave brain fog I've actually been able\nto help pretty substantially and it\nwasn't like I therapized them what we\nactually found is that by targeting all\nof these different dimensions it can be\nactually you could sort of figure out a\ngood plan to sort of improve your brain\nfog so a couple of other things so\nanother medical disclaimer that this is\nsomething that what I'm going to share\nwith you all now is stuff that I have\nfound useful in my clinical practice\nI myself used some of these uh\ninterventions like so I had pretty bad\ncovet about a year ago and was also\nnoticing some amount of brain fog so I\nkind of went through my own like brain\nfog regimen and I found that like I\nbasically am completely recovered from\nthat but remember that this is not\nmedical advice and that each and every\none of you should really talk to a dog\ndoctor about all of these things and\nsort of try to figure out a customized\nplan but here are a couple things that\nwork the first is yoga or Tai Chi and\nspecifically I found sheer shasan to be\nvery effective so sheer shasan is a\nheadstand pose so it's this particular\nasan where you're upside down right so\nit's a yoga posture where you're upside\ndown it's definitely something that\nrequires some degree of training so I\nwouldn't try that at home you really\nneed a good teacher to teach you how to\ndo it but cheers is literally like\nyou're just doing it a headstand right\nso your head is at the bottom and your\nfeet are at the top and the cool thing\nabout cheersen is that it it really\ntrains your body to maintain blood\npressure to your brain so it really like\nwork wreaks havoc on your cerebral\nvascular system and your vascular system\nnot in a in a negative way but it sort\nof trains you to be like upside down and\nas you're upside down it trains your\nbody a little bit to handle blood flow a\nlittle bit better so sheer shawson or\nany kind of yoga or tai chi I think will\nprobably be effective there's also good\nevidence that yoga and Tai Chi are have\nlike anti inflammatory and stress\nreducing effects so I'd recommend yogurt\nor Tai Chi specifically probably\nslightly more recommend yoga over Tai\nChi and that too some of the yoga\npostures that you should do are ones\nthat have postural changes so bending\ndown and touching your toes you know\ndoing your the hand above your head\nmaybe doing something like downward dog\nor parvatasan or things like that but\nyoga is actually really good at like\nhaving your body move in particular ways\nthat require you to maintain blood\npressure so yogurt Tai Chi is number one\nsecond thing that we have to consider is\nobesity so this is where some amount of\nexercise is actually really important\nbut we're going to Tunnel down into what\nkind of exercise so it's not just\nreducing obesity for its own sake\nalthough we do know that adipocytes are\npro-inflammatory right so we talked a\nlittle bit about that but specifically\nthe kind of exercise that we want to do\nis going to be cardiovascular in nature\nand ideally has you using your legs and\nwhy is that so there are a couple of\nreally important things to understand\nabout sedentary lifestyle and the impact\nof sedentary life Style on specifically\nour leg muscles our our heart is here\nokay and our heart pumps things and\ngenerally speaking our blood tends to\npull at the bottom of our feet right\nbecause of the effect of gravity so\nthere's one really interesting thing if\nyou look at your body what you'll sort\nof find is that even if you look at the\nback of your hand okay it's kind of out\nof focus but if you look at the back of\nyour hand you can see veins right even\nif you look at like your head or your\nneck you can see veins so veins tend to\nbe pretty peripheral when it comes to\nthe top half of your body but if you\nlook at your legs it can be very hard to\nsee your veins and the reason for that\nis because a lot of times our major\nveins in the legs are actually on the\ninside of the leg and we actually rely\non our skeletal muscle the muscles in\nour legs to pump blood back to the heart\nso anytime I walk what the contraction\nof the skeletal muscle anytime I take a\nstep is actually helping Blood come back\nto the heart so one of the things that I\nfound is that with a Century lifestyle\nwe're walking less as we're walking less\nwe're getting more blood kind of pooling\nin our lower extremities so we're seeing\nincreases in stuff like varicose veins\nand stuff like that and all of that is\nassociated with a sedentary lifestyle so\nany kind of exercise specifically that\ninvolves walking and a high level of\ncardiovascular like workout is actually\nreally good so this is one of the\nsituations where you know I wouldn't\nrecommend specifically like bench\npressing so bench pressing will increase\nyour cardiovascular weight but like\ngetting gigantic muscles on your arms is\nnot actually or your chest is not\nactually what we're really shooting for\nhere what we really want to do is engage\nthat skeletal muscle in our legs and\nideally start to exercise and get to a\ndecent heart rate right so essentially\ncardiovascular activity using the legs\nis what we want to Target so that'll\nalso have the added effect of hopefully\nreducing our obesity and a couple of\nother things the next thing that we want\nto do is really think a little bit about\nour diet so remember that there's\nactually studies that show that let me\njust show you all a quick paper so brain\nfog inflammation and obesity key aspects\nof Neuropsychiatric disorders improved\nby ludiolin so we know that some of\nthese flavonoid compounds specifically\nsomething called ludiolin which I think\nis\nand extracted from usually olives and\nthis is a potentially another reason why\nthe Mediterranean diet\num has like positive anti-inflammatory\neffects is because of the prevalence of\nolive oil so you may have ludiolin in\nthe Mediterranean diet at a high level\nas well so people can also supplement\nwith ludiolin but this is definitely\nsomething that I would encourage you to\ntalk to your doctors about because\nluteolin can be biologically active with\nother compounds like medications and\nthings like that but we sort of know\nthat supplementing with flavonoids and\nludiolin can actually have a positive\neffect on brain fog so the other simple\nway to kind of think about this though\nis that if you eat nutrient dense greens\nthat'll also do the trick so it's not\njust healthy diet in general it's sort\nof thinking a little bit about okay what\nare the dietary inputs that I need to\nkind of compensate for the brain fog and\nthe specific thing about ludiolin and\nflavonoids is that they seem to have\nvery positive effects on the parts of\nour brain that appear to be affected by\nbrain fog so remember this this Mast\nCell active Innovation this high level\nof inflammation there's very strong\nanti-inflammatory anti-oxidation and\nneural protective effects of flavonoids\nand ludiolin so that's something that I\nwould definitely recommend that you all\ntalk to your doctor about the last thing\nto generally consider\num is to remember like two super basic\nthings the first is sleep and caffeine\nso sleep is incredibly important so just\nabout every person that I've worked with\nwith brain fog has needed to have some\nkind of improvement in their sleep so if\nyou're not sleeping properly sleep is\njust the general time that our brain\nuses to heal itself right so if we're\nlike not sleeping properly or our sleep\nis Disturbed or we have too many\nsubstances on board if we use marijuana\nto help us sleep if we use alcohol to\nhelp us sleep even if we take exogenous\nmelatonin I'm sometimes a little bit\nconcerned about the high level of\nexogenous melatonin use even though from\na medical standpoint it's very very safe\nbut I think good sleep is huge for brain\nfog the last thing to consider is once\nagain hydration so this is where you\njust got to be drinking lots and lots\nand lots of fluid so if we're talking\nabout this blood pressure effect we got\nto remember that like fluid intake is\nvery very important for maintaining a\nhealthy blood pressure so you've got to\nreally look at what what's your liquid\nintake over the day are you drinking\nlots of soda are you drinking lots of\ncaffeine are you drinking enough water\nhow often are you urinating what is the\ncolor of your urine you generally want\nto be urinating like a light yellow\ncolor if your urine is completely clear\nyour fluid intake may actually be too\nhigh if your urine is very concentrated\nor you're not urinating very frequently\nthere's a decent chance that you're not\ndrinking enough so these are the last\nkind of two things to consider so it's\nunfortunate that brain fog has been\nreally like expanding very rapidly I\nalmost get the sense that there's like a\nsilent epidemic of brain fog that's\nhappening in our society today and the\nmost devastating thing about that is\nthat as it's affecting more and more\npeople the solutions that we're offering\npeople with brain fog don't seem to be\nworking very well so if you go see a\nmedical professional it's a good thing\nto do by the way because they can rule\nout other causes right so if it's\nsomething like anemia Mia or vitamin B\ndeficiency there are a lot of things\nthat can kind of contribute to brain\nfog-like symptoms the downside is that\nif it's true brain fog then chances are\nit's not one of those vitamin\ndeficiencies and you should rule all\nthose things out but then your doctor\nhas sort of left it like kind of like I\ndon't know what to do and then sometimes\nwhat they'll end up doing is just\nreferring you to a therapist or just\ntelling you like oh eat healthy and\nexercise which is actually part of the\nsolution don't get me wrong but then the\nother problem is that once you get\nreferred to a therapist the therapist\nmay be able to help you in some ways but\nthe real problem is that brain fog is\nnot a psychiatric Condition it's\nactually a physiologic and neurologic\ncondition and so oftentimes what our\nmedical system actually does is sends\npeople to the wrong professionals and\nthen when therapy or Psychiatry kind of\ndoesn't work for you then you're sort of\nleft feeling like okay well I've tried\neverything where it was it turns out\nthat you actually tried you started with\nthe worst thing right because it's not a\nmental illness and then people feel\nreally really hopeless then you kind of\ncome back to your your doctor and you\nsay hey the therapy isn't working and\nthen they're kind of like shrug their\ntheir shoulders and we don't really know\nwhat to do so my hope today was to share\nshare with you all a little bit about\nyou know what are the mechanisms of\nbrain fog what are we sort of what are\nwe starting to understand about it and\nsome of the stuff that I found to be\nsomewhat useful for some of my patients\nas well as for myself in terms of my own\npost covid recovery remember that your\nmileage may vary and that this is\nabsolutely a situation where you want to\ntalk to a medical professional first to\nget evaluated for all kinds of these\nother things right and if you do that\nhopefully what we'll we'll start to see\nis that your brain fog will actually get\nbetter and I would say that like 80 to\n90 percent of the people that I've\nworked with with brain fog with some\ncombination of the stuff that we just\ntalked about will actually get better so\nhopefully that helps you\nforeign"
