    "transcript": "and then the other thing is that so so I\nI'm gonna go ahead I don't know what\nchat thinks but I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay I don't think you really did\nanything wrong here cool so what do you\ngo by my friend\nsorry can you repeat that what do you go\nby what do you want me to call you today\noh coming James James\nwelcome James nice to meet you\nhey so what's your situation\nwell\num I was seeing a girl and I was kind of\na little bit stressed and annoyed\nbecause I didn't know where my boundary\nwas between going to her place and not\nat a time I felt like I wanted her to\nkind of try push on our behalf\nuh but we broke up recently it was\npretty rough not gonna lie\nsorry to hear that man\nthanks\nis that it\noh I don't know which situation you want\nme to explain the push for change or how\nthe breakup actually went oh well so so\ngenerally speaking I I think that so\nwhat's your understanding of what we're\ndoing today\nuh am I the [ __ ] yes so what I mean\nso so far what I've heard is that you\nwere in a relationship and y'all broke\nup\nso I'm not seeing any [ __ ] Behavior\nthere is there anything that you're\nconcerned about that you may have done\nincorrectly\nuh yeah I feel guilty and I feel like\nthe [ __ ] even though she broke up\nwith me\nand okay so why don't you can you tell\nme a little bit about\num\nwhat's your understanding of why she\nbroke up with you\nso when I went to sear I flew from\nDublin to Croatia to see her\n[Music]\num\nI was on pain medication for some sinus\nissues things were clear I was like okay\ncool but then suddenly they got very\nvery bad very quickly\n[Music]\num\nI was like\ngoing through horrible headaches stuff\nlike that stressing her out a lot how\nare you stressing her out\nwell I could see that\nlike she almost didn't know what to do\nshe was a bit overwhelmed\num there was a time in a restaurant\nwhere she got frustrated because I was\nabout to faint\num\nyeah\nshe was getting frustrated because you\nwere about to faint what what made you\nwant to fame or not made you want to but\nwhat was causing your near fainting so I\nlater found out that\num I was actually taking a bad reaction\nto the pain medication\nI was told they didn't have a certain\nsubstance they did and that was causing\nme to feel faint feel dizzy slurred\nspeech terrible terrible stuff I was\ntrying to ask for help and she didn't\nreally take me anywhere\nand I saw her getting frustrated and I\nfelt guilty what what kind of help were\nyou asking for\nto see a doctor\nI see so you were asking her to help you\nsee a doctor\nand what did she say\nuh the first time she called her mom to\ntalk\num her mom was then\ntalking to me like do you need to see a\ndoctor are you feeling okay and I was\nlike No I I don't know how I feel right\nnow it just feels bad\num\nyeah\nI thank God and shouted out by her mom\nactually layered out there you got what\nby her mom\nher mom then started sharing I mean\nblaming me once my girlfriend went to\nthe bathroom\nwhat was she shouting what was she\nblaming you for what was she saying\nsaying like it was irresponsible of me\nto come\num I shouldn't be playing with my\ngirlfriends or my ex's feelings\nlike if I was sick I should never have\ntried to come what are you doing here\nlike you're not strong enough that sort\nof stuff\nwhat do you think about that\nI want to say\nit's like not true but I still feel that\nguilt like it is my fault\nand what do you think I thought I felt\nbetter\nwell like if I didn't get sick if I took\ncare of myself maybe things would have\nbeen different\nI thought it was okay but I didn't know\nsomething like this could have happened\nokay and um\nso what do you think is responsible for\nthe way that you\nwere feeling when you were in Croatia\nwhat do you think is responsible for\nyour sickness\nphysically or\nhow do you understand why you were sick\nin Croatia\nI mean\nsorry words are kind of catch me I have\nfeelings though just not the words\nthey're hard that's fine take your time\nguilt shame and then blaming myself\nthat's what comes up\nokay\nso I can I can notice that\nit's like when I ask you a question what\nI'm sort of getting from you is that\nthere's almost like this um\nit almost feels to me like a geyser\nwhere there's like this Fountain of like\nguilt and shame that's kind of\ndominating your mind when I ask you a\nquestion is that fair to say\nyeah it's kind of floating the space to\nbe honest\nright so I'll ask the question again\nbecause I think it's important to try to\nit may not be possible so no blame but\nto try to kind of push past that so my\nunderstanding is that you were\nill\nwhen you visited your then girlfriend in\nCroatia correct\nyeah and prior to going to Croatia you\nwere ill and then you had seen a doctor\npresumably\nyeah and the doctor did what\nso the doctor said hey take these\nmedications this antibiotic and this\npainkiller when you need it if it clears\nup between this day you're good to go\nokay so did the doctor tell you not to\ntravel to Croatia or anything like that\none doctor said be cautious about it the\nother doctor said if you're feeling good\non that day things have cleared there\nshould be no reason why you can't and\nhow how did you feel\nthat day on the day I left I almost felt\nfantastic okay my nose was clear there's\nno so would you say that you followed\nthe doctor's medical advice\nI say so yeah yeah sounds like it to me\nright so if your doctor didn't say don't\ntravel\nand they said be cautious about it and\nif you're feeling good on the day you\nhave to leave then you're fine to go\nbecause if you take antibiotics and\npainkillers\nand then while you when you got there\nwhat stressed your girlfriend out\nso\nat first I just kind of had like a pain\nin the head and I was like oh I'll just\ntake a painkiller not realizing me\ntaking the painkiller was going to cause\nthe effects later\nso\nI was\nkind of drowsy\nnot really present trying to be\num\nI kind of felt like I was like that kid\nbeing driven around in the back seat of\nyour car and you're like okay we have to\ntake care of him now\nokay so you were ill and what's your\nunderstanding of like what was causing\nwhat caused the way that you were\nbehaving\nwell now I know it was that bad reaction\nto the pain medication okay\nso\nand then the mob starts yelling at you\nright\nyeah that was after visiting a\nrestaurant the first time now earlier\nwhen you were first sharing the story\nyou said something about\num\nyou said something about boundaries can\nyou tell me a little bit about that\nyeah so like\ntwo weeks probably before\num\nthere is a situation where me and my\ngirlfriend or ex needed to talk about\nsomething important\nbut\nprior to that her dad I decided I'm not\nwelcome in their shared Apartments\num I always find that very difficult\nbecause\nwe didn't have space to talk really\nabout important things unless it was in\na public Cafe and a shopping store yeah\nso what what I'm confused what what is\nthat so\nbut y'all are long distance right\nno actually I was going to visit her um\nwhile she was visiting family but she\ndoes like live two hours away from me\nregularly I see so so and so I'm\nconfused so her dad was not okay how old\nis she\nuh 20 or something and she pays for half\nthe rent half of everything in the\napartment so so y'all but but y'all\ndon't live together\nno and so I'm confused so the dad\ndoesn't want you to visit her at her\napartment\nyep I wasn't even allowed to pee in the\nhouse traveled two and a half hours to\nget there and was told going a shopping\ncenter and that was upsetting\nand so what what was the way it sounded\nlike you pushed a boundary\napparently so and what was the boundary\nthat you pushed\nI don't know my girlfriend wasn't very\ncommunicative I tried asking what's\ngoing on I was allowed to stay at her\napartment before that but something\nchanged and she wouldn't tell me and I\nnever got to know and so this was a few\nweeks before you visited her in Croatia\nand so who who invited you to Croatia\nmy girlfriend did\ndid she invite you\nyeah she said hey\njust come over we can chill out\nall things through\nso I'm super confused so so you're\nliving in Dublin and she lives two hours\naway\nno I'm living well\nnear Dublin that I can get too easily\nshe's living into a Dublin area I see\nand so you're but does her family live\nin Dublin tour she's living there on her\nown\nso her father lives in Dublin her mother\nlives in Croatia I see okay and so\nyou're not welcome and and when you say\nshe pays half the rent her dad pays the\nother half\nexactly I see okay so she lives with her\ndad\nso you're not welcome in the roommate's\nhouse\nbut are you being invited by your\ngirlfriend there\nat times I was and then it just all show\noff basically but I was invited to hang\nout adjacent to her apartment\nbecause her apartment is right next to\nthe travel line and all that yeah okay\nso James this is where so what do you\nthink here that what do you think you\ndid here that could be perceived as\nbeing an [ __ ]\nin that context I think how I any of\nthese contexts I was\nmy mind went blank there sorry for\ninterrupting I should have let you\nfinish\nI'll ask the question again so I like\nwhat do you think you did wrong here\nwhat do you think you're guilty of\nhow I talked about it maybe or brought\nup put my girlfriend's how I made her\nfeel\ndid I push something I I don't know\nI feel like I did something wrong\nokay you feel like you did something\nthat's why we're asking these questions\nokay\nso here's what I'm hearing and you let\nme know if this makes sense to you or\nnot\nso I know this the situation seemed a\nlittle bit confusing but it sounds like\nyou all both live in Ireland\nright yeah\nand there's this with this first\nbusiness of you used to be able to visit\num yep\nbut now her dad who is also her roommate\nwhich is weird\nlike uh you know set some limits or\nboundaries on you being able to visit\nI I yeah\nokay so that's like one issue and then\nyou were invited by her and then her dad\nis like by the way you can't\nuse the bathroom like what do you think\nabout that yep\nI felt like I was treated like a dog to\nbe honest being told no go outside so I\nso I'm gonna ask the question again I'm\nnot concerned with how you feel in this\nmoment I'm gonna ask you what do you\nthink about that\noh\num\nI think\nI I don't know what right words to use\nokay it's not about right words or wrong\nwords so so let me and I I know I'm I\nmay be a little bit difficult right now\nso I apologize for that but I do think\nit's important because if we're so\nhere's the key thing to understand\nif we're the [ __ ] or not doesn't\ndepend on our feelings\ndoes that make sense\nit depends on our actions\nI can hear you say that but it's not\nmatching up with what's inside\nperfect right so that's why we're doing\nthis\nbecause oftentimes we think that we our\nguilt\ndetermines whether we feel guilty or not\ndetermines whether like that's how our\nmind tells us we did something wrong or\ndidn't do something wrong does that make\nsense\nsame thing I hear what you're saying it\njust doesn't match okay so I'll try to\nlet me just kind of start from the top\nso let's forget about the roommate\nsituation for a second let's focus on\nthe trick yep\nso if one person gets invited\nto visit someone else and you go and you\nvisit someone else\nand that person becomes sick\nill and has a medication reaction\nthat was unexpected and is due to a\ndoctor prescribing a medicine which we\ndidn't know how you would react\nso like the person who followed the\nmedical advice they were told by the\ndoctors be cautious take this medication\nand if you feel well you can go and they\ndo what the doctor says and then they\nshow up and they have a bad medication\nreaction\nyeah\nI don't think that's that's their fault\ndoes that make sense\nI\nI see where you're coming from so I'm\ngoing to say this as a doctor not your\ndoctor but generally speaking if I\nprescribe a medication to a patient of\nmine and they have a bad reaction I\ndon't blame them for it\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nright so like some there's one reaction\ncalled anaphylaxis\nwhich is like when people can't breathe\nokay it can be potentially fatal I don't\nknow if you've ever heard of like an\nepinephrine pen or an EpiPen\nbut it's a reason I have to carry them\nhuh\nmy family have to carry them so you're\nfamiliar with them so someone needs an\nEpiPen is a doctor I'm not like screw\nyou [ __ ]\nit's not the patient's fault if they\nhave a medication reaction right\nyeah I don't blame someone for needing\nan EpiPen it's actually quite absurd\nand then the other thing is that so so\nI'm gonna go ahead I don't know what\nchat thinks but I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay I don't think you really did\nanything wrong here\nlike because what I'm hearing is that\nyou had a medical reaction that was\nunforeseen\nand more importantly unanticipatable\nbecause we're not we didn't hear\nanything about like anyone expecting you\nto have this reaction and that you\ntraveled somewhere else you were invited\nby someone and you were a guest of\nsomeone's\nand you got sick\nand then when you got sick yeah her mom\nwas like you're weak I don't know why\nyou're here\npretty much yeah yeah and I don't think\ngetting sick is a sign of weakness\nespecially if it's a medication reaction\nthere are some sicknesses that you could\nconceivably blame people for\nlike if you've been smoking for 40 years\nand you get lung cancer like arguably\nyou can blame someone for that but I\ndon't think a medication reaction is\nsomething that you can blame someone for\nand so I'm not really hearing that you\ndid anything out of line in fact what I\nwould say is that it sounds like people\ninvited you to be their guest and then\ngenerally speaking like I think it's the\nresp like if I invite someone into my\nhouse and they get ill\nI think it's reasonable for me to try to\ntake care of them\nright because that's what you do for\nguests in your home\nyou don't\nbut does that make sense yeah\nlike if you have like a friend visiting\nyou for Christmas and then they they get\nthe flu or something and they're like\nhey can you take me to go see a doctor\nwhat do you think the right move is\noh doctor let me do it but hold on James\nwhat if you don't like them\nwhat do you think the right move is\nthere\ndoctor\nbut but but you don't like them\nis it still important to take him to the\ndoctor\nyeah\nabsolutely man\nwhere does diminished smash come from\nI think the mismatch comes from\nsomewhere along the way I'm not quite\nsure why but somewhere along the way\nlike people are blaming you for this and\nyou're happy to take it\nso what I'm noticing is that they're\nblaming you and you're feeling guilty\nwhich is not a mismatch does that make\nsense\nthe problem here is that there should be\na mismatch\ndoes that make sense okay\nbecause because her parents are blaming\nyou and you're feeling guilty\nyeah that's not a mismatch do you\nunderstand that\num actually I don't sorry so like if I\nblame someone even if I'm wrong forget\nabout right or wrong for a second\nif I blame someone and even if they're\nnot wrong if they feel guilty and they\napologize do you get how there's like\nHarmony in this situation\nit may be incorrect but I'm blaming\nsomeone and someone is happy to take the\nblame that's what guilt is\num okay you see what I'm saying like\nyou're feeling guilty and they're\nthinking you're an [ __ ] so like y'all\nare kind of okay with that it's wrong\nbut there's agreement\nokay I see you see what I'm saying like\njust because everyone agrees doesn't\nmean that anyone is right\nbut what I'm kind of noticing here is\nthat like you're feeling guilty and\nthey're blaming you and people who feel\nguilty\ncan't push back against people who blame\nthem\ndoes does that make sense\nI I got you\nwhat are you hearing James what are you\nunderstanding\nso\nsomeone feels guilty\nthat matches with someone blaming them\nso\nthey don't push absence there's the\nmatch absolutely it's fit into place and\nif one person blames another person and\nthe other person feels guilty\ndoes that mean that a guilty person made\na mistake\nit could you're correct it could\nbut it's not a definite yes\nyou get that\nI do yeah so I think the problem here is\nthat so first of all I don't think\nyou're the [ __ ] unless we're like\nmissing something\nlike unless you're showing up like\npressuring your girlfriend into going or\nthings like that that then I think it's\na whole different ball game\nso if we hear it's just\nyep sorry you were saying no go ahead oh\nuh\nno it was just me turning up I felt good\non the first day the second day I was\nstarting to feel bad\nI was just getting worried and stuff\nlike that\num the episode happened I asked hey I\nneeded to see a doctor\num didn't get to see one\nthen the mom was very very harsh I was\noverly stressed out I didn't know what\nto do or think\nyeah so I mean I don't think you did\nanything wrong here it sounds to me like\nhonestly like you had a bad reaction to\na medication\nand then if anything the one thing that\nsort of maybe makes sense to me is that\nmaybe the reason you feel guilty is\nbecause your girlfriend is stuck between\nyou and her parents\nwhat do you think about that\nis not something I thought about\nright so her parents clearly don't like\nyou but she does yeah\nso I think what we're sort of seeing\nhere huh\nwell no we're broken up now yeah\nex-girlfriend but but I I think what\nwe're kind of like what I'm saying\nsometimes this happens where essentially\nlike\nshe's not able to set appropriate\nboundaries with her parents so she wants\nyou to come over but she's not like she\ncan't go all in on that\nand then so you get pulled in and then\nthey push you out\nit's like this is absurd dude I\nif my roommate or my kids\nif my kids invited someone over that I\ndidn't like\nI would still let them use the bathroom\nin my house\nyeah like that doesn't I don't think you\nknow I mean\nI think if someone was invited to my\nhouse by someone else in my house I\nwould let them use the bathroom unless I\nwas concerned about theft or something\nyou know maybe some situations\nbut I want to say like even if there was\na convicted felon who was invited to my\nhouse I would let them use the toilet\nlike I wouldn't have them go down this\nlike unless I had a plausible threat of\nthem being behind closed doors and you\nknow if they were gonna I don't know\nlike flood the toilet I I can't think of\na scenario a reasonable scenario in\nwhich I would not let someone use the\nbathroom and like you said you felt like\nyou were treated like a dog which is\nwhat you were treated like\nI mean I think the [ __ ] here seem to\nbe her parents\nwhat do you think about that\none parent's yeah I can see\nwhich one\ndid that for sure\nthe mom\nI I don't know if she said those things\nout of\na place of anger or worry or\nsomething else\nI mean I don't I mean whether it was\nanger or worry this is where like so\nthis is the other thing James like it's\npossible that we're getting such a\nbiased story from you\nthat we're we're missing something\nprobably but I I mean I I don't think\nthat there's this is where like it\ndoesn't matter where she was coming from\nyou were ill you had a medication\nreaction they wouldn't take you to see a\ndoctor\nlike what the [ __ ] man yeah\nI was just told to get on the plane and\nuh\nbrought back to our own how to go to the\ndoctor legere an hour after my flight\nambulance brain scans all that stuff\nit was horrifying okay so like that even\nreinforces the story so if you're\ntelling me you got urgent medical\nattention and someone a medical\nprofessional was so concerned that they\nscanned your brain\nlike yeah basically right because like\nthis is where the medical professional\ndecides it's not you know we just don't\ngo around scanning people's brains\nchances are you got a CAT scan which\nexposes you to some radiation so we\ndon't just order them willy-nilly right\nwe only really order them like when we\nneed to\nbecause they're expensive and they\nirradiate you\nso we don't want to just do it so I mean\nit's good test to run if people are\nconcerned but we just don't go around\ncat scanning people\nand and so I think the biggest issue\nthat I'm hearing here James is that\nsomewhere along the way like\nI don't know if you've been in an\nabusive Dynamics before but this sounds\nto me like sort of an abusive Dynamic\nwhere people are blaming you and\nsomething about the way that your mind\nthinks like you accept that blame\nbut I'm not hearing that you did\nanything wrong here\nI just feel like it's\nagain me kind of having a moment of\nweakness I guess\nlike\nyeah I still feel bad when I have those\nmoments\nsure I guess\nand I mean I I think that that kind of\nmakes sense\num in the sense that you're concerned\nabout\nyou don't like feeling weak\nlike I can empathize with that but I\nthink this is where this is showing us\nhuh\noh no it's more so showing us or having\nto\nlike let it out I guess\num yeah so that I mean that's where like\nI can I can empathize with the feeling\nuh\nbut I think this is where\nI also don't think that\nI I don't think I I don't think that\nbeing ill is a sign of weakness\nit can feel that way\nbut\nyou know I I mean you got sick dude\nyeah I got sick\nI don't think that makes you weak you're\nwelcome to disagree\nsorry I'm just reflecting good\nit's not something you should apologize\nfor\nanything you want to add or any\nquestions I mean so I I think uh twitch\nchat is pretty confident\neighty percent of people\noh I haven't been checking Twitter you\nshouldn't actually switch but 82 percent\nof people don't think you're the [ __ ]\nhere\nand my guess is that the rest of the\npeople just think you're trolling or I\nthink some of the people were one person\nsaid yes and I'm pretty sure they're\ntrolling\nno I I wish like afterwards I I still\ncan't retype correctly because uh I keep\non making typos and stuff like that it's\noh it's a whole thing\nbut yeah so I I don't think you're the\n[ __ ] here brain stuff\nit sounds to me like you got sick and it\nsounds like\nyou know your girlfriend was caught in a\nsituation where she couldn't set\nappropriate boundaries and like advocate\nfor getting you medical attention which\nis bizarre\nand yeah I feel like\nkind of like\nI was there for her a little bit\nwhen she had stuff that you know needed\nattention\nbut now I had that same or similar\nissues\nand it was like oh can't touch this okay\nuh throw it away oh break up with him\nokay just get get rid of them can't deal\nwith it yeah so that sounds brutal dude\nit has been and it I mean I I don't I'm\nnot really hearing much that I think is\nyour fault and this is where\nyou know it can it can hurt to break up\nwith someone but I think that like being\nin a relationship with someone\nwho can't set boundaries\nto protect you from people in their\nlives right this isn't just parents this\nis like things like x's and stuff like\nthat I don't think those relationships\nend up being very healthy\nso if you like someone and you want\nsomeone in if you if you want to be in a\nrelationship someone and you want that\nperson to be in your life you've got to\nbe able to advocate for them and have\nthem be in your life\nuh hold on one second\nyeah okay good\nconcerns mother all that sort of stuff\nwell we're concerned for you too dude\nbut I don't think you're the actor no\nreally\nthis whole Community has just been like\nreaching out I'm I don't know where to\nput the feeling\nlike\nyeah strangers coming out helping asking\nif I'm okay\nit's yeah it's wild yeah the community\nis great\nmaybe they can help you it really\nreally is maybe they can help you learn\nwhat you're worth\nI don't think I know that actually yeah\nI can tell\nand that's okay\nhmm\nand so hang around for a while and we'll\nsee if we can figure it out together how\ndoes that sound\nI like that yeah\ncool man good luck to you\nthank you"
