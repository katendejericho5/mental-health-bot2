    "transcript": "we don't really acknowledge this I think\nconsent is incredibly important but most\nof the advances in relationships don't\nhappen with explicit consent perfect and\nwhat do you go by my friend\num\nmy post was like I mean an assault for\nacting weird with my girlfriend\num so I\nI tell the story yes\nokay\num so it was at the party and I was\ndrunk and she was not\nand at some point we were together in\nthe middle of the room full of people\nand she kissed me and it was really nice\nbut after the kiss I untied her hair and\nI said something like make me happy\nand I used to do something else grab a\ndrink or I don't remember\num but I did this because I am really in\ncomfortable to to show love and love\naffection in public like kissing in\npublic and putting in comfortable for me\nso to me it was like\nout of my comfort zone and I I wanted\nher to do the same\nso I and I yeah what do you mean by you\nwanted her to do the same it's the same\nmeaning what\nuh same as uh getting out of the comfort\nzone\nI see so you felt uncomfortable and so\nyou wanted to make her uncomfortable\nuh somehow I don't know if out of the\ncomfort zone is uncomfortable but yeah\nprobably yeah okay\nall right so then so you pull uh you\nremoved something from her hair\nyeah that was tied and okay\nand then you left the room\num yeah but not really far away just\nlike a\nfew meters away okay\nyeah in my head it was um\nyou know when I'm drawing uh everything\nseems uh\nmore classy and just better I think it's\nnot\nalcohol does do that sometimes yeah and\nso then what happened\num she didn't say anything to party on\nthe night\nbut later on she took me she talked\nabout it with her friends and uh\nit was weird and she didn't really like\nit\nand uh it's something that\nMichael decided to wake up\nso after a few times after this we woke\nup\nuh when you say a few times after this\nwhat does that mean what were the times\num it's two weeks\nOkay so\nand and so you said you you pulled\nsomething out of her hair like did it\nhurt her in some way\nno just no just like removing like a\nclip or like a you know a hair tie or\nsomething\nyeah because I think her hair are really\nbeautiful and\nI like it better untied okay\nand then\nand then what did you say\num\nI said it in a in my foreign language so\nit's not the same yeah but that's fine\nit looks\nit's like um he wants a\num you want the French\n[Music]\noh it's something like make me happy or\nplease me but so but what what does that\nor yeah what is the French can you tell\nus in French\n[Music]\num\nizo\nokay and so what does that mean can you\nI understand what the translation is but\nwhat's like the tone of what that means\nit's like\num\nI um\nI make her happy with accepting the kiss\nso I expect her to do something to make\nme happy as well\nso is it is it like flirtatious\nfor stage\nso so I mean is it is it like a nice\nthing to say or a mean thing to say or a\nplayful thing to say\nuh maybe a little bit playful depending\non who do you mean it\nand how did you mean it\nyeah it was a bit um\nlike a little bit challenging I guess\nokay was it sexual\na little bit okay\nand what's your understanding of why she\nbroke up with you\num\nthere was a\nsome event like this that happened and\num books a lot of event happened then\nshe didn't felt in love anymore\nand uh [ __ ] so because I wasn't love\nanymore I think she stopped to care\nabout me and the ocean the relationship\nso I think that's it\nso she wasn't in love anymore she she\nbroke up with me because she fell out of\nlove\nyeah I think did she talk about this\nincident when y'all broke up\num yeah what did she say\num she didn't say much about it just um\nwhat uh I said like she told she asked\nher friends about it and uh she thought\nit was weird\nand uh yeah she didn't didn't like it\nokay\nand what do you think about it\nuh I agree that it's weird\n[Music]\nof course I wouldn't\nhave done it if I wasn't drunk\nbut it's not so bad\nI think uh help me understand why you\nwouldn't have done it if you weren't\ndrunk\noh because it's\num I am\na little bit shy so if I wasn't drawing\nI I'm not sure I would accept the kiss\nand uh yeah if it's too ballsy For Me\nMaybe in front of people doing this I\nsee so accepting the case you wouldn't\nhave done what about the the the the\nwords that you said in the pulling the\nstuff out of her hair\nyeah yeah this is what I I was talking\nabout I wouldn't do this either okay so\nyou wouldn't have done any of it\nno so and maybe do you what do you think\nabout it now that you're I'm presuming\nthat you're not drunk right now now that\nyou're no you're no longer drunk what do\nyou think about what you did\num yeah just like I said I think it's\nit's stupid like it's it's fully real I\nmean\nit's not something I will do what's\nweird about it\num\nall right\nI I I don't know it's just uncommon and\ncome on and uh not something\nshe would expect me to do okay\num\nthis so\nI I and how long were you all dating\nuh six months\nokay\nand um have you all talked about her\nhair before\nno uh\nuh not not really really but I think she\nshe knew that I liked her hair\nbut then I nothing nothing\nokay so I and like I'm just not sure\nlike what's normal in a relationship for\na kind of what stage you were at so\nsometimes like it's okay\nfor someone to like mess with or play\nwith your hair right so like for example\nI'm married and sometimes my wife messes\nwith my hair and that's like okay in our\nrelationship\nI don't always like it but it's\nsomething that we're okay with do you\nknow if like I mean is that something\nthat y'all had done\nin terms of like I think\nyeah I think it's it would be okay if it\nwasn't in public\nbecause we were kind of in the middle of\nthe room\nand\nyeah it wasn't just uh playful like it\nwas after a kiss and\nyeah I think this is why it's weird\nokay but uh otherwise it will be only\nokay to to do this\nokay\nso\num and what do you think do you think\nthat you were out of line\na little bit yeah\nin what way do you think you were out of\nline\nbecause she didn't want her hair to be\nuntied\ndid you know that she didn't\num\nshe didn't she didn't tell me but I\ncould um\nsomehow I think I knew it I mean no I\ndidn't knew she didn't want\nto untie but\nI mean if they were tied\nmust be a reason\nokay\nand do you think that um\nand and how drunk were you\num\nputs you well in like to me it's close\nto my limits\nthe close to your limit of being drunk\nso you're definitely drunk but if you\nwere more drunk you would have been like\nsick kind of thing\nmaybe yeah yeah I was really really\ndrunk okay\nso you know I think so twitch chat voted\n41 thinks that everyone here is the\n[ __ ] 33 think that you're the [ __ ]\n25 don't think you're the [ __ ]\nwhat do you think\nI didn't understand how many things\nuh so the most people think that both\nyou and your girlfriend are at fault so\neveryone sucks\nokay 40 of people think that everyone\nmade mistakes\nthirty percent of people think that\nyou're the [ __ ]\ntwenty percent of people don't think\nyou're the [ __ ]\nokay\nwhat do you think 33 and 25.\nwhat do you think most people most\npeople think we both are [ __ ] yes\nthat's the number one\nand and this is where so here here's my\ntake okay\nso the first thing that we have to\nacknowledge is that if you were drunk\nthere is a decent chance that your\nmemory of the situation is off in some\nway\nyeah\nso the first thing that I'm gonna kind\nof say is that like we've got to be\ncareful here because you may have\nremembered things in a particular way it\ncould have been worse it could have been\nbetter like who knows\nso I think if you're getting pretty\ndrunk and you're like doing things that\nyou all don't normally do I mean that's\nwhat happens when people get drunk but I\ndon't think and it kind of bothers me a\nlittle bit that you were like I wouldn't\nhave done this if I wasn't drunk\nyou know so that kind of makes me wonder\na little bit\nbut then as we tunnel down into that it\nseems like the reason that you wouldn't\nhave done it isn't that you think it's\nwrong it's that you're shy\nright yeah so yeah so yeah I'm not I'm\nnot sure but I wouldn't have done it\nyeah so I think the only thing that I\nthink is really assholish about this for\nyou is that she made you uncomfortable\nand then you did something to make her\nuncomfortable\nyeah\nso like that I think is\n[ __ ]\nso is it Justified Maybe\nright so if I if I call someone\na nasty thing\nare they justified in calling me a nasty\nthing maybe\nbut I mean it sounds to me like you felt\nuncomfortable that she did something\nthat you didn't really consent to or\nfeel comfortable with and so your\nresponse to that is I'm gonna do\nsomething that she doesn't like or\ndoesn't make her comfortable\nand that doesn't sound right to me\nI think the other thing in terms of the\nmistake here is not necessarily in the\nbehavior but in the way that the\naftermath of the\noccurrence\nso the other kind of question here is\ndid she know that public displays of\naffection make you uncomfortable\nno yeah that's it was a that's what I\nwas gonna say it's she didn't actually\ndon't know she didn't know\nno\nso so I mean so this is where I think\nthat like you know I think the real\ntragedy here is that you all didn't like\ntalk about this\nand when people say like communication\nis the foundation of a relationship I\nthink this is oftentimes people don't\nknow what that means what that means is\nthat if your partner does something that\nmakes you uncomfortable the right way to\nhandle it is not to make them feel\nuncomfortable but to talk about it\nyeah\nbut I think maybe there is another\nreason\nfor me to act like this and what is that\nmaybe I I thought that it was some kind\nof teasing to kiss me in public like\nthis and uh\nmaybe it was just my answer to\nto the teasing sure it it's that that's\nthe thing right so sometimes in\nrelationships I don't think you're wrong\nthere that like sometimes in\nrelationships part of the natural\nprogression of the relationship\nis to kind of like up the ante and and\nenter into like uncomfortable spaces\nthe key thing though I think is that\nusually that needs to be done with like\nsome amount of being on the same team as\nopposed to like I did this to you so\nyou're going to do it to me or vice\nversa does that make sense\nyeah yeah I mean this doesn't sound to\nme like a horrible violation of consent\nand maybe I'm wrong there but like you\nknow if you're dating someone for six\nmonths I think like\nplaying with their hair which is one way\nthat you could perceive this I think is\nlike something that\nis probably\nokay\nI mean presuming that nothing you know\npresuming they haven't made it clear one\nway or the other but the the honest\ntruth about relationships and I think\nthis is something that we kind of like\nyou know we don't really acknowledge\nthis I think consent is incredibly\nimportant but most of the advances in\nrelationships don't happen with explicit\nconsent\nso simple things like for example\ndo you mind if I eat a french fry off of\nyour plate like sometimes a lot of stuff\nhappens in the comfort of relationships\nthat happens kind of like subconsciously\nand like it's not like we ask for\npermission for every single thing\nis it okay if I kiss you like that's a\ngood thing to ask consent for is it okay\nif I kiss you for one second two seconds\nthree seconds\ndo you have to ask for consent every\ntime you kiss like generally speaking in\nrelationships we don't do that\nlike there's a certain amount of like\nnavigating things forward and that can\nabsolutely get people into trouble don't\nget me wrong\nI do think we should probably be having\nmore conversations around consent not\nless but I think the real mistake here\nthe only two things that I really\nthought that that you know one thing is\nthat if she I mean if she didn't know\nyou you didn't appreciate it being\nkissed in public and y'all have been\ndating for six months\nthen you know I think if y'all kiss in\nprivate at some point that starts to\nbecome public unless you lay a boundary\nfor her\nso had you laid some kind of boundary\nno\nso so then then I think the only real\n[ __ ] thing that I think you kind of\ndid here is that she made you feel\nuncomfortable and based on what you're\nkind of sharing with us there was a part\nof you that was like she made me feel\nthis way so I'm gonna make her feel this\nway\nwhereas I can sort of get that\nyou know if there's a public display of\naffection you can kind of be flirtatious\nI I don't know if you are familiar with\nthat word in English\nyeah yeah it's yeah\nand so this sounds to me like within the\nnormal bounds of flirtation like if your\npartner kisses you in public\ntouching her hair in some way and making\na suggestive comment especially\ndepending on the tone and stuff like\nthat maybe completely acceptable I'm not\nhearing something that was degrading or\novertly sexual\nwhich I but I don't understand the\ntranslation or the connotation or things\nlike that so\nbut I think really what I'm here the\nonly real thing because I I think what\nyou tried to do in that moment is become\na Chad for a second\nright yeah probably this is you in\npublic and you're like Chad mode baby\nbut it sounds like you're not really\npracticed at that so it may have come\noff a little bit cringy\nand creepy\nand you know that's unfortunately part\nof like you know even Chad stumble from\ntime to time on the road to chadhood\nbut along the way it's perfectly\nreasonable that as you're stumbling you\nmay be an [ __ ] somewhere in there\nno\nwhat do you think\num I think maybe my understanding about\nwhy I did this might be wrong\nlike I\nI justify myself with saying that um\nI did I did this to make her own\ncomfortable\nbut I don't know like I'm not sure\nbecause uh\nI was drawing and\nI don't really know why I did this yeah\nso I mean I but like that that's kind of\nthe tricky thing so I think the other\nmistake here is getting really drunk\nyeah right which like at the end of the\nday you're still responsible for your\nbehavior when you're drunk\nbut I'm I'm also not hearing that\nyou're like your girlfriend's friends\nthought it was weird but I'm not even\nhearing that she really found it to be\nlike violating or anything like that\num a little bit I think when you say you\nthink what do you base that on\num when she told me about it\nso what did you think\num\nI don't remember everything but because\nshe told the her friends about it I\nthink it was something big for her\nokay I mean yeah so you know\nI I think it's kind of an edge case but\nI definitely think there are things here\nthat you could or should have done\ndifferently\nlike just to be on the safe side but I\nmean we're not you know we're talking\nabout removing some stuff out of\nsomeone's hair now this is like what\nwould cross over into [ __ ] territory\nif she likes her hair a particular way\nand you like it a different way and then\nyou consistently\nturn her hair into something that you\nfind enjoyable or like pleasing to look\nat as opposed to what her preference is\nbut that I'm also not hearing because\nit's not like you guys had conversations\nabout hairstyles and stuff it sounds\nlike you just tried something and it\nsort of didn't work out\nyes that's not something I wouldn't do\nso and furthermore the drunkenness it's\nnot like I wouldn't do it because I'm a\nmoral person and when I become drunk I'm\nimmoral it sounds like really the\ndrunkenness removes the shyness\nwhich you know is\nso I I mean I think it's kind of an edge\ncase but the real tragedies here I think\nis that you didn't really talk about it\nand also that you know there wasn't any\nkind of serious conversation afterward\nwhich there probably should have been\nand then probably like getting super\ndrunk like doesn't help\nyes that's I came to the same conclusion\nyeah\nso you know my my sense is you were\nprobably a little bit of the [ __ ] but\njust a little bit\nhow does that sound to you\nyeah I think\nyeah I agree yeah yeah I think I think\nthe same\ncool\nyeah thank you you're very welcome good\nluck to you my friend\ngood luck to you dude"
