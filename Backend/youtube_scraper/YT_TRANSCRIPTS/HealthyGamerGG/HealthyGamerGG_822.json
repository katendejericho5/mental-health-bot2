    "transcript": "and so paradoxically the more we invest\ninto something the more we view\nourselves as an author the more that we\nstrive for success in writing the harder\nit becomes to write there are many\npeople who will offer solutions for life\ndo this and you will be happy do that\nand be happy it is my opinion that you\nmust understand yourself first that is\nwhy we made Dr K guide check it out nah\na writer who never writes I identify a\nlot with Dr K what Dr K says about\ngifted kids except I'm 40. my failed\nCollege sensor long behind me I've\nachieved a lot in life truly but good\nfinancial success is not among my\nachievements 13 years ago I dedicated my\nlife to writing fiction I've written a\nlot outlined even more but shared little\nI fear failure comparison and how those\nfailures would sink my chances of\nkeeping a future reader this fear is so\nall-encompassing that I would rather not\nwrite and just play video games or write\nPathfinder module tools anything but\ntell the stories that I could sell\nprofessionally to make money for my\nfamily does anyone have any insight into\nhow I might overcome this limitation\nstorytelling has been my passion since I\nwas nine and I would love to do it as a\nprofession I know writing very well this\nis not a skill issue it's 100 a\npsychological issue what a beautiful\nbeautiful post so we've talked a lot\nabout gifted kids but those gifted kids\nsometimes grow into adults and the hard\nthing about being an adult and not being\nsuccessful is that while you're a kid\nyou've got potential you've got time\nlike even if you screw up a little bit\nwhen you're 18 19 20 you got time to\nsort of get back on track and sort of do\nwhat you're supposed to do but then you\nkind of grow into an adult and then\nyou're on the downhill right you're 40\nyears old maybe you're 35 maybe you're\n45 and sure Dr chaos all this advice\nabout how you can put your life together\nwhen you're in your 20s but some of us\nare kind of over the hump and then we're\nkind of struggling because this is\nsomething that we really want to do\nright and you can sort of look at your\nlife and you can say I've accomplished a\nlot I've grown a lot but there's just\nthis one thing and then the real weird\nParadox here is that it's not even a\nskill issue you know you're good at it\nright you've been dedicating your life\nto it it's been your passion your entire\nlife or maybe you discovered it a little\nbit later and you're putting in the\nhours and you're putting in the work and\nyou know you're confident that you can\ndo it you feel stuck and despite the\nmore that you practice the more that you\ntrain you're never ready to actually\ntake the plunge you practice and you\npractice and you practice and you're not\nready and you're not ready and you're\nnot ready so how do you overcome this\nbecause at some point you begin to\nrealize practicing I don't know if I can\never like write the perfect novel right\nat some point you got to take the plunge\nbut you can't and that feels kind of\nweird right so what's going on here so I\nwant you all to put yourselves in the\nmind of a 40 year old whose passion has\nbeen writing their entire life who spent\n13 years training their craft so this\nperson hasn't been financially\nsuccessful they've figured out all all\nthe other parts of their life this is\ntheir white whale this is their raid\nboss this is the final challenge so\nyou're a 40 year old you've got to make\nsomething of your life right there's a\nlot of pressure you gotta make something\nof your life and now you've invested all\nof your energy into this and so what if\nyou fail right so this sort of becomes\nokay I'm afraid of failure the person\neven knows that I compare myself to\nothers we even know that but why can't\nwe overcome this and it turns out that\nall the things that we think we have\ndone to set ourselves up for Success\nactually are the things that paralyze us\nright because if this was my passion\nsince I was nine and if I take the\nplunge and if I fail then what am I I've\nbeen writing for 13 years I'm so good at\nit it's a hundred percent not a skill\nissue I'm supremely confident why can't\nyou write it's because of the ego\nbecause what you want to be is an author\nright and as the years of your life fly\nby endures and opportunities close\nbehind you you've got one door left\nyou're all in on this one thing you want\nto be a 6 successful author and what\nexcuse do you have you've got the skill\nyou've got the passion you're one of\nthese success stories right oh yeah this\nperson started writing at the age of\nnine oh my God and they devoted their\nentire life to it and then they\npublished their first novel and what a\ngreat success it was and this is what\nyou strive for as you've made sacrifices\nas you've made Investments you've got\none door left to be a successful author\nthat's what you really want to be and so\nyou learn about how to become a\nsuccessful author you practice you do\nthis you do this you do this all the tea\nyourself up for success and\nparadoxically the more effort you put\ninto trying to be successful the more\nparalyzed you become because think about\nit if you go all in on this thing and\nyou lose you lose everything and now we\ncan also see why this person has moved\nforward in other parts of their life how\nhave they been successful in so many\nways well because that wasn't as\nimportant to them does that make sense\nbecause you could afford failure over it\nthis isn't who you are this isn't who\nyou strive to be this isn't what what\nyou were put on this Earth for and so\nall of those things you can take a\nchance but I want you all to think for a\nsecond about how crushing it would be to\nbe 40 years old be passionate about\nwriting since the age of nine spend 13\nyears on your craft and get rejected\nthen who are you that final door closes\nthe reason that you were put on your\nEarth all of your passion all of your\neffort all of it goes down the drain and\nno wonder we can't write right because\nit's a [ __ ] coin flip and if the coin\nflips the wrong way it's over it's GG\nyou're not a successful author what are\nyou then a failure you are a failure and\nyou just can't handle that right you\ncan't handle being a failure and so now\nwe understand okay of course like who\nwould who wants to go all in on a coin\nflip can you do that especially when\nyou're 40 when it's too late to learn\nsomething else when it's too late to\nPivot into something else oh my goodness\nand so paradoxically the more we invest\ninto something the more we view\nourselves as an author the more that we\nstrive for success in writing the harder\nit becomes to write and so then what we\ndo we go optimizing all the things that\nwe can we're going to learn this I'm\ngoing to do this podcast I'm going to\ntake this course I'm gonna join this\nwriting group I'm going to do all of the\nthings around the periphery it except\ntake the plunge so what do we do about\nthis situation this is where once again\nit's going to be kind of simple also\nvery difficult and remember that the\nmore complex the answer is the easier it\nis for the mind the Mind loves\ncomplexity right that's how you're able\nto do all of the periphery because the\nmind tells you oh look being successful\ninvolves 15 variables and then the mind\nis it's thrilled because now I can do a\nI can do B I can do c I can do D I can\ndo E I can do I can make all of this\nprogress while staying perfectly still I\ncan be paralyzed and progress at the\nsame time right I can take another class\nI can do another podcast I can listen to\nthis I can do all these things that will\nteam me up for success with ever ever\nwithout ever having to take the plunge\nand the answer is quite simple and that\nis to recognize that you can't be a\nsuccessful author the whole idea is\nfalse it's an idea of the ego of the\nahamgar and now we see why there's so\nmuch comparison so y'all been paying\nattention and you know about a Home\nGuard you know that a humgar is a\nconsequence of the comparison I mean a\ncon comparison is a consequence of a\nhome God because I want to be a\nsuccessful author well what does that\neven mean what does it mean to be a\nsuccessful author what does it mean to\nbe a failure as an author is getting a\nbook rejected mean that you're a\nsuccessful author does getting a book\naccepted mean that you're a successful\nauthor because ultimately being an\nauthor is not about being it's not about\nsomething you are it is about what you\ndo so this is where I think everyone who\nstrives to be a successful author I\ndon't know about everyone but many\npeople who strive to be successful\nauthors never become successful authors\nso how do you become a successful author\nyou write right and then you do the next\nthing you write something you you're\nworried about sharing it with people\nsharing it with your family and whatnot\nand what if they think you're good\nenough or what if they think you're bad\nenough you're so concerned about the\nsharing and instead what you should be\nconcerned about is the writing because\nthe idea of being a successful author is\nan amalgamation of lots of different\nthings and the problem is you can't do\nall of those things at once you could\neven say that part of being a successful\nauthor is dealing with rejection but the\nproblem is that you can't deal with\nrejection because in your mind like that\none rejection means so much for your\nfuture so you are tying the actions of\ntoday to a destiny of tomorrow and if\nyou are tying the actions today to\nDestiny of tomorrow you can never act\ntoday because how could you just imagine\nfor a moment if you made one choice\ntoday that would determine the rest of\nyour life and furthermore if that choice\nwas whether you become a successful\nauthor or not imagine how paralyzed you\nwould be\nif you're unlucky you don't even have to\nimagine it you know you can't afford to\nmake the choice\nthat's what it comes down to and that's\nwhere you have to realize it's all false\nall of it is false all you can do is\nwrite all you can do is submit what\nyou've written all you can do is go to a\nconference and find an agent all you can\ndo is what you can do it's not your\nplace to be successful or not successful\nthis is a concept that I think is best\nexplained in the bhagavad-gita which is\na religious text from the Hindu\ntradition but there's this concept of\nKarma far Karma means action and father\nmeans fruit as a human being you are\nentitled only to your actions never to\nthe fruit of your actions I can ask\nsomeone out but I'm not entitled to them\nsaying yes I can write a book but I'm\nnot entitled to publishing it and so now\nwe understand why a whole generation of\npeople is paralyzed because we get so\ncaught up on controlling the one thing\nthat is out of our control when I plant\na seed in the ground and I try to grow a\nfruit tree does it grow or not grow I\ndon't know that's not for me to decide\nall I can control is what I do so what\ncan you do this is the answer forget\nabout who you are forget about what you\nwant to be you want to be a successful\nauthor well I have no [ __ ] idea if\nyou can do that neither do you because\nwho said you could see the future you\ncan't see the future and yet you live\nyour life as if you can you live your\nlife looking for the formula that will\nguarantee you success and now we\nunderstand why you're paralyzed because\nwhat actions can you take that will\nguarantee success what do you have to do\nto be able to predict the future because\nif you can figure that out then you'll\nact and you stay paralyzed because you\ncan't see in the future and you're\nlooking for a guarantee and you fear\nfailure so focus on the action don't\nwrite for anyone else don't write to\nbecome successful acknowledge that\nwhether you are successful in this life\nor not is not yours to determine all you\ncan do is give everything that you've\ngot that's all you can do give it your\nall and what if it's not enough then\nit's not enough this is the wild thing\nif you want to be free of that there is\na beautiful piece in giving everything\nwhat we've got in it not being enough we\nstart with that being the ultimate fear\nbecause what what if I give it\neverything I've got and it's not enough\nthat means that I'm not good enough\nbecause I gave it everything and if you\nreally look at why we self-sabotage part\nof the reasons that we self-sabotage is\nto protect our ego because what we want\nis we want to reserve something right so\nif we're not top of the class we can say\nto ourselves oh well I half-assed it\nthat's my excuse so we are terrified of\nthe idea of giving it all and not being\nenough but there's something beautiful\nthat we don't realize is when you give\nit your all and it's not enough it's\nliberating it's not crushing it's\nliberating you may say well how the hell\ndoes that happen well because I gave it\nmy all and I know there's not a damn\nthing I could have done so it isn't my\nfault I did everything that I was\nsupposed to do and Medicine teaches you\nthis when you try to save a life and you\ncan't doesn't matter that you trained at\nHarvard or not doesn't matter you can do\nwhatever you want to you can call\nconsults you can call the chief of\nPsychiatry the number one Hospital in\nthe United States and you can ask for\ntheir help and it's still not enough you\ncan do everything that you want to do\nand then you begin to realize how humble\nyou truly are it humbles you because you\ncan't control life all of this training\nall of this power all of this medical\ntechnology and I do not have the power\nover life or death obviously and it's\nliberating because then what I'm going\nto give it everything that I've got if\nit doesn't work out it doesn't work out\nso don't try to live a life of success\ntry to live a life Without Regrets give\nit everything you've gotten if it's not\nenough that ain't on you right if you're\njust too damn stupid to write\nsuccessfully or the market doesn't want\nwhat you want that's actually totally\nokay because you gave it everything\nyou've got you controlled everything on\nyour side of the equation so focus on\nthe action if you want to write write\ndon't worry about whether people will\nlike it or not like it that's not what\nwriting is about write the story that's\nin here write the story that you want to\ntell and you're going to write that\nstory and you're going to look at it and\nyou're going to say this is trash\nso be it you're going to stick it in the\ndust drawer you're going to walk away\nfor a month you're going to come back\nyou're going to pull it out you're going\nto read it and it's absolute trash and\nyou're going to make it a little bit\nbetter you're going to take that chicken\n[ __ ] and one step at a time you're going\nto turn it in a chicken salad you make\nyour first edit we're going to toss in a\nlittle bit of mayo second edit toss in a\nlittle bit of salt a little bit of\npepper it's edible now but it's nowhere\nnear where you know it can be then we're\ngoing to add some pickles add a little\nbit of celery add some cayenne now it's\nlooking pretty good and the Greeks\nunderstood this really well because they\ntalked about genius which is not that\nthe skill of the rider exists within you\nyou are not a genius genius is something\nthat happens to you it's An Occurrence\nit's an RNG event and the beautiful\nthing about that perspective is that it\nremoves ego from the equation it assumes\nthat you are not responsible for the\nsuccess or the failure and so recognize\nthat all you can do is what you can do\nand if it's not good enough it's not\ngood enough you ain't you can't predict\nthe the future how on Earth do you know\nif it's good enough or not good enough\nyou're afraid it won't be good enough\nset that fear aside acknowledge it set\nit aside and start to write"
