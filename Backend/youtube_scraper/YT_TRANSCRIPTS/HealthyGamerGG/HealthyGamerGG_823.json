    "transcript": "the world that we lived in is not the\nworld in which our brains were developed\nright so our brains evolved for a\nparticular kind of lifestyle and I think\nwhat we're actually seeing is that as\nHumanity has progressed a lot we've lost\nsight of like particular things that our\nbrain used to rely on hello\nhere if you want to get control of your\nlife and understand how the mind works\ncheck out a DIY guide to mental health\nthe link is in description huh so let's\ntalk a little bit about emotional\nprocessing so I want to start with a\nstory so I was once working with someone\nwho was in the field of finance and they\ncame to my office and they were\nconcerned that they were going to get\nfired and so they were say they came in\nand they said I'm really anxious and I\nsaid okay well what are you anxious\nabout I said well I'm paranoid I'm gonna\nget fired and so we as we kind of dug\ninto it what we found is that you know\nthis person's anxiety was sort of\nturning into a vicious cycle where they\nwere you know they were afraid that they\nwere going to get fired which in turn\nmeans that anytime they were presenting\nso they'd once a week they would kind of\npresent to all the partners and stuff\nlike that about the work that they were\ndoing the deals they were working on\nthings like that and so the more anxious\nthey became like the more they would\nstumble over their words like oh my God\nlike the partners are all listening like\noh like I can't screw this up I can't\nscrew this up and since their mind is\nnot on what they're actually supposed to\nbe presenting but it's so focused on not\nwanting to screw everything up what\nwould happen they would screw up right\nthey would stumble over their words\ntheir presentation wouldn't kind of come\nout clear and so they were just really\nconcerned and terrified and they just\nhad to get a control of this anxiety so\nthey kind of came to my office and\nthey're like you know can you help me\nlike with the anxiety and so we talked\nabout lots of different stuff it was\nreally interesting what ended up\nhappening we'll sort of share what what\nhappens at the end of our talk today but\nso we started working on that and I\nthink one of the key things that I sort\nof noticed as I was talking to him is\nthat things seem to be getting harder\nright if we kind of look at people today\nlike I talked to a lot of people and it\njust seems like things are just getting\nharder I get the sense that we're\ngetting more or kind of rung out right\nas we go through life I'll talk to\npeople who are teenagers in their 20s\nand their 30s like life seems to just be\nsqueezing everyone dry and even if you\nlook at some of these like things like\nthe the kind of anti-work movement or\ndating like life there just seems to be\nlike more suffering like I get the sense\nthat people today are going through life\ntrying to take as little damage as\npossible because every time you like do\nsomething in your life like it's not\ngoing to go well and you're gonna like\nlose a piece of yourself like in online\ndating for example everyone's like every\nsingle date I go on it's like I lose\nlike this tiny part of myself right like\nI went on another date I dug real deep I\nyou know match with 5 000 people I went\non one date and when things didn't\nreally work out and now it's like am I\ngoing to be alone forever and so it's\nkind of like life just the more you go\nthrough life the more like battered and\nbruised you get and there's this kind of\nidea that what doesn't kill you makes\nyou stronger but I get the sense that\nwhen I talk to people like they're just\ngetting kind of it's like death by a\nThousand Cuts as they try to move\nthrough life they're just getting more\nand more shriveled and kind of patched\nup and defunct and like it just it just\nseems like we're not able to recover\nfrom things the way that we used to\nright and so I was kind of thinking\nabout this because his life actually\ngetting worse like you know if we look\nat it humanity is advancing in so many\ndifferent ways hopefully we'll have\nhuman beings on Mars soon you know\nmedicine is advancing technology is\nadvancing like we have commercial\nflights into space now like you know we\nhave\ncell phones right so we can do all kinds\nof stuff like video games are super cool\nthere's like VR technology we developed\na covid vaccine in two years you know\nlike cancer treatments are improving\nlike if you look around like things seem\nto be getting better right if you look\nat the humanities progressing but why\ndoes it feel like we're getting worse\nright why is Humanity as a whole\nprogressing but it feels like every\nperson I talk to who's trying to go\nthrough life is just getting like worse\nand worse right it almost feels like you\nstart life with some amount of happiness\nand each negative experience you have\nlike takes away some happiness and it's\nnever to be gained again I get the sense\nof of a very limited resource that\npeople are kind of like getting rid of\nas they try to go through life and so I\nthink we have some terms like burnout\nfor example which is at an all-time high\nso why are like so many people burnt out\nwhen we have so many things that make\nour life convenient so if we think about\nwhat used to what should burn us out\nlike what should burn us out it's like\nyou know effort but now I can get food\ndelivery to my door I don't have to have\nto sit up to work or be entertained like\nI can now do all my work or\nentertainment at my fingertips\nyou know I can watch a Breaking Bad on\nthe toilet if I want to like there's all\nkinds of stuff I can I can take off my\nswitch off the dock and and you know\nwalk into the bathtub and then like play\nswitch like there's so much convenience\nnothing should be getting easier but it\nfeels like things are getting harder hey\nChad subscribing to our

subscribe wait they have to\nhit subscribe and click a bell now and\nso if we want to understand okay like\nwhat's going on here so are we just\nwrong or we like you know some of the\npeople from the older generation are\nlike young kids nowadays they're so\nungrateful that they're so lazy like you\nknow is that what's going on is is a\ngeneration have we just gotten kind of\nyou know lazy like what's What's\nHappening Here what's changed has\nanything changed is this just a\nperception and what I kind of realized\nis that the world that we lived in is\nnot the world in which our brains were\ndeveloped right so our brains evolved\nfor a particular kind of lifestyle and I\nthink what we're actually seeing is that\nas Humanity has progressed a lot we've\nlost sight of like particular things\nthat our brain used to rely on took for\ngranted so easily that now that we've\nsort of lost it we're kind of really\nconfused about what we even lost because\nwe weren't even aware of it and in\nessence I think that's emotional\nprocessing and as a society what we've\nlost sight of is the ability to\nemotionally process in fact it was so\neasy to do before that we don't even\nthink about it necessarily like a skill\nright like we kind of took it for\ngranted because now we have all these\nlike resources around emotional\nprocessing right go see a therapist but\nlike ten thousand years ago or twenty\nthousand years ago there weren't\ntherapists and it's all not like human\nbeings were having trouble with\nemotional processing right they were\njust kind of going about and living\ntheir lives so I want to share with you\nall an interesting perspective from like\nevolutionary psychology around how the\nbrain processes emotions and what we\nwill discover is okay once we understand\nhow the brain processes emotions we'll\nsee how Society has changed and if we\nsee how Society has changed we'll maybe\nbe able to detect have we lost the\nability to process emotions and then the\nquestion kind of becomes okay if we\nfigured out that we have lost the\nability to process emotions what can we\nstart to do differently how can we\nreclaim the lives that we used to have\nso that emotional processing becomes\neasier okay so let's start with kind of\nhow Society used to exist so the first\nthing is that we used to live in\ncommunal groups right so there's like a\ngroup of people and so there was a\nlimited amount of stuff to get you\nexcited on a daily basis there was like\na lit like the scope of conflict was\nlike narrow right you maybe live in a\nvillage of let's say somewhere between\nlike 50 and 500 people and see there are\nonly so many people you can have beef\nwith whereas like now if you look at the\nworld today like I can post something on\nTwitter and the 10 000 people that\ndisagree very strongly with what I said\nCan attack me on Twitter from all across\nthe globe even though it's a tiny\nfraction of the world right they can\nstill pile on and attack me so the first\nthing to understand is that we used to\nlive in kind of a communal society and\nif you look at how human beings managed\nconflict so let's say look we have some\nkind of conflict and then like what\nwould happen after the conflict let's\nsay I get into an argument with someone\nin my town or in my tribal group okay\nwhat happens after that emotional\nexchange so I'm kind of ramped up\nemotionally right like what do I do so\nlet's say I go like out foraging and so\nI'm walking through the Wilderness and\nI'm sort of physically paying attention\nto things but mentally like what am I\ndoing like I'm just sort of like my mind\nis kind of doesn't have anything to do\nright and so our my mind is kind of in\nidle mode like there's not I'm not\nengaged in an argument then but I have\nlots of time where my mind is idle and\nI'm sort of doing some physical things\nwe also see this with humans in terms of\nrote labor right so we humans used to do\na lot of like rote labor that was\nmentally like idle so let's say I'm\nrepairing fishing nets or you know I'm\nI'm making a fire right which used to be\nlike an hour long Endeavor or I'm like\nsharpening a spear or I'm maintaining\nI'm tanning leather or something like\nthat like there's all kinds of like\ntasks that human beings used to do all\nthe time which required physical effort\nbut essentially gave idle time for the\nmind and what's kind of interesting\nabout that is if you allow yourself to\nhave idle time in your own mind what\nyou'll discover is that that's when you\nactually do a lot of processing right so\nif I have a conflict with someone and\nthen I go for a walk and I give my mind\nthe chance to think through it I'll sort\nof feel better at the end of the walk or\nin a communal Society maybe I'll go for\na walk with a friend or I'll go foraging\nright with a group of people and we kind\nof talk a little bit about what happened\nand then I'll kind of like process it\neven in terms of the rote labor where\nlike if I'm sitting there repairing\nfishing nets and I had a conflict with\nmy let's say wife last night that's a\ngood chance for me to kind of like think\nthrough things and so one of the key\nthings as I kind of look at really study\nI remember reading about anthropology\nand some of these you know tribes in New\nGuinea and sort of the psychological\nimpact or their what their psychological\nlives were like and I was struck by the\namount of idle time that they have to\nessentially like process stuff because\nthere's nothing else to do and now if we\nkind of think about it how is Modern\nLife different and what we discover\nabout Modern Life is that we essentially\nhave no time to process that processing\nis actually like a subconscious or\nrelatively automatic activity that that\nhappens over long periods of time so we\nsort of know this right so there are\nsome theories in Psychiatry about dreams\nand stuff as methods of emotional\nprocessing that essentially like a lot\nof these thoughts and stuff will be\nactive in our unconscious but we sort of\nknow that that emotional processing to a\ncertain degree like takes time and takes\nlike space and if we really look at\nwhat's changed in our society it's been\na loss of time and space because we\ndon't have idle time anymore right now\nwhen I'm taking a walk what am I doing\nI'm listening to an audiobook listening\nto a podcast listening to music now when\nI have a conflict with someone what\nhappens do I go for a walk afterward do\nI have time to think about it while I'm\nrepairing my Nets no of course not I\ncreate mental distraction so what we're\nstarting to see is that as we accumulate\nthese negative experiences let's say I\nhave a bad date what I end up doing\nimmediately after the bad date it's not\nlike I've got idle time in my mind in\nfact what I want to do is distract\nmyself and then what happens is as I\ndistract myself I don't process any of\nthose emotions they kind of just go\ndormant right because after a bad date\nyou kind of want to like distract\nyourself from those emotions but then\nwhen you wake up the next morning what's\nwaiting for you what's waiting for you\nis those emotions and so the second you\nwake up you're like oh my God like that\ndate was so terrible and then what do\nyou do you pull out your phone and you\ndistract yourself from that processing\nin the moment moment and as this goes on\nagain and again and again what we tend\nto see is that our life is filled with\nnegative impacts that we don't allow\nourselves time to actually process and\neven in the history of humanity we have\nsome events like funerals are a good\nexample of this where we sort of have\nactive participation without any sort of\nintellectual goal does that kind of make\nsense like when I go to a funeral it's\nnot like we're there to do anything we\njust kind of communally gather and we\njust sort of share random thoughts about\nthe person and something about that\nexperience it's not like we're there and\nwe're going to be like okay what are the\n16 ways in which this person impacted\nyour life let's think through them let's\nthink about how you're going to replace\neach of these things that this person\ndid for you that's not actually what\nfunerals do for us that's not how they\nhelp us process grief right they just\nsort of create this like time and space\nthat sort of has this this intensive\nparticipation without actually a whole\nlot of like mental work and so our mind\nis allowed to almost be on autopilot and\nsort of process that grief in these\nfuneral kind of situations and if we\nlook at life essentially what we've lost\nis all of that kind of time because now\nwe're doing something constant we'll\nalso this is also why I think that memes\nare so telling right because if after\nI've been through traumatic dating\nexperiences why do I love the memes that\nI love I think the reason we love the\nmemes that we love is because we've got\nso much buried emotion that it takes\nsome kind of humorous single image to\nevoke that emotion and it resonates with\nus right that's why we love memes so I\ndon't even think it's a coincidence that\nwe've seen a rise in memes correlating\nwith the lack of emotional processing\nand the more we love memes because it\nspeaks to what we struggle with in life\nright because those things are things\nthat we hold on to we have all these\nnegative experiences each date that I go\non each time I send out a job\napplication in this massive pool each\ntime that someone gets back to me after\nI've applied to a job and they're like\nhey can you upload your resume into our\nspecific portal and retype everything\nand it's like that's why I sent a resume\nright each of these tiny little\ntraumatic experiences we have and then\nwhat do we do as soon as I'm done\nuploading my resume into the 16th you\nknow corporate portal because they want\nit formatted in their way what do I do\nafter 16 of those I'm so exhausted that\nI'm gonna go play a video game I sure as\nhell ain't gonna stop and think about it\nright I'm not gonna like be idle I need\nto get the hell away from this and so\nour society has given us so much space\nto distract ourselves from our emotions\nthat we never end up processing them and\nthis is why it feels like as we go\nthrough life we lose a piece of\nourselves with each negative experience\nbecause we do lose a piece of ourselves\nthe difference is that in the past we\nknew how to find those pieces we could\nget them back because we had this\nprocess of kind of emotional healing and\nthe lack of this also kind of explains\nsome of these like emotional\ninteractions and some of these things\nlike trauma dumping on the internet\nwhere like now I've got this like\ngigantic pile of emotion that subsurface\nhas been buried down with dopaminergic\ndistraction and then occasionally I'll\nlike explode on someone on the Internet\nor we'll see people who get really\nreally caught up right or very very\nangry we'll see so much tilt and anger\non the internet why is that it's because\nnone of this stuff gets processed and\nsometimes what happens is people will go\ninto like vomit in some corner of the\ninternet right they'll make some rent\nbut even if you think about the rant\nwhat happens to that person after they\ntype out their rent they just go back to\nthe distraction so what we're almost\nseeing is like these surface level\nemotional managements it's not like that\nperson is getting to the root of the\nissue right they're just ranting for a\nlittle while and then they go do\nsomething else and then the emotions\npile up again and then they kind of like\noverflow and rant again so what we're\nseeing is that our society this sort of\nnatural emotional processing has been\nreplaced by this very like surface level\ndistraction and sometimes even this like\nverbal diarrhea kind of stuff which we\ncall like venting but venting is not the\nsame as emotional processing all it does\nis get rid of the stuff on top and then\nwhat we really have have to think a\nlittle bit about is okay so like what do\nwe do about the stuff down below how do\nwe actually process our emotions and\nstart to feel a little bit better about\nlife how do we recover from the damage\nthat has been done and that's where I\nthink that what we've really lost sight\nof is some of this deeper emotional work\nand if we think a little bit about the\ndeeper emotional work what are the\nattributes of it right so the first is\nthat it requires time the second is it\nrequires space the third is it requires\nsomething like exploration and so what\nwe've managed to actually do is create a\nsystem of professionals that in a\ncertain amount of in a restricted time\nin a restricted space can go deeper than\nyou normally would right these are what\nwe call therapists in the case there are\neven other kinds of professionals right\nlike coaches if we think about life\ncoaches or career coaches or things like\nthat like we have a pretty robust\ncoaching program what we've really found\nis that coaches are really good at\nunderstanding those kinds of problems\nand then helping you do that emotional\nwork so that you can actually like move\nmove forward and achieve your goals\nwhich going back to our original case at\nthe beginning so here's just a prime\nexample of that right so this is a\nperson who came in and was really really\nconcerned about losing their job and so\nwhat ended up happening is we talked\nabout it they're like okay like well why\nare you so stressed out about losing\nyour job and what they sort of told me\nis that you know I'm really a team\nplayer like I like working on teams\num they were a professional athlete and\nhad done a lot of Team oriented Sports\nand so that what they were really\nlooking for is like a team and what they\nreally hated the most the root of all\ntheir problems at this particular\nfinancial institution was that it was\nlike really competitive it was sort of\nlike a dog eat dog kind of world right\nso what would happen is if they were\nworking on a deal with a couple of\ncolleagues the colleagues would try to\nmake themselves look good by like taking\nthe credit and as they started taking\nmore and more credit the person I was\nworking with started to feel really\nreally anxious because now they're\nlosing credit for their work people are\ngoing to think that they're a waste of\nspace people are thinking that they're\nnot carrying their weight and that\ntriggers all the anxiety and then\nthey're afraid they're going to get\nfired and why are they going to get\nfired it's because they can't Advocate\nthemselves for themselves in a room the\nway that other people can right they\ncan't sort of like take all the credit\nbecause that's just not who they are\nthey're like a team person not like a\ncompetitive like I'm gonna you know take\neverybody else's credit and so 18 months\nafter this person came into my office\nrequesting help with anxiety so that\nthey wouldn't get fired they actually\ndecided to quit and this is exactly the\nvalue of emotional processing once you\nstart to figure out we have these\nsurface level emotions that we deal with\nbut once you actually start to do that\ndeep emotional work you start to figure\nout okay what is it that I dislike about\nthis place how are these experiences\nactually affecting me how are these\nexperiences changing the way that I look\nat myself how do I want to look at\nmyself how do I want to live in this\nworld what kind of stuff do I actually\nwant and once we start to do that deep\nemotional work and once we actually\nfigure out okay this is deeply how I\nfeel about it once I give myself time\nand space and keep in mind that this\nperson worked with a professional for 18\nmonths discover what you actually want\nprocess each of those events and how\nthey made you feel about yourself and\nthen ultimately what you're going to be\nable to do is quit you'll be able to be\nfree of it you'll be able to actually\nmanufacture your own destiny you'll be\nable to actually make decisions that are\naligned with who you are but we've lost\nsight of who we are because we're so\nbusy distracting ourselves and having\nthese emotional volcanic eruptions\nwithout ever actually getting to the\nroot of it so people may be wondering\nokay practically like what does this\nentail right how do I do this this\nsounds great so let's remember that\nthere are a couple of things that if we\nkind of look at anthropology we can sort\nof look at what human beings used to do\nto process and we can try to create\nthose in a sort of targeted way so the\nthing the first thing you know at the\ntop of my list is journaling and\njournaling is a little bit tricky\nbecause people say like oh like you\nshould Journal but then I don't know if\nyou all are like this I'm kind of like\nthis where I didn't know how to journal\nbecause everyone says you should Journal\nbut no one teaches you how to journal\nright because even journals are like\nprivate it's not like if I start\njournaling the age of 12 no one's\nsupposed to read it so how am I supposed\nto get feedback on whether I'm\njournaling properly or improperly and\nthat's where some people say there's no\nproper way to journal it's for you but\nthis is what's really frustrating is if\nyou're kind of like me where you're kind\nof like a logical scientific person if\npeople are in touch with their feelings\nthey can figure out how to journal on\ntheir own but I don't know how to\njournal I need like I need to understand\nwhat's the point what am I trying to do\nlike and they're like that's not the\npoint of journaling no BS it can be the\npoint of journaling right so if no one\nteaches us how to journal so I'd love to\nDuty with you all today is just teach\nyou a little bit about journaling so\nthere are a couple of different ways you\ncan journal the first is that you can\nwrite about experiences that are\nemotionally charged for you this is the\nsimplest way to journal and the cool\nthing about journaling is that it\ndoesn't have a particular endpoint right\nso when you say well what am I supposed\nto write about you know how do I know\nwhen I'm done well it kind of doesn't\nmatter because the journaling itself\nit's not about doing the journaling the\nright way or the wrong way it's that the\njournaling is going to be a substitute\nfor that sort of idle work and giving\nyour mind time to start processing and\nthen your mind will do the subconscious\nprocessing on its own own so I would say\njust write about experiences that are\nemotionally engaging for you and what\ndoes that mean emotionally engaging it\nmeans things that made you feel good or\nfeel bad now sometimes people may be\nkind of confused and they're like okay\nbut like I don't want to journal about\nthat right so sometimes people run into\nresistance around journaling around\nemotionally active experiences which\nmakes perfect sense because they're\nemotionally engaging and sometimes we\ntry to avoid that crap and since we\navoid we want to avoid that crap that's\nhow we end up in the dopaminergic crap\nright that's how we end up in video\ngames and social media and Twitter and\nReddit and memes because we're trying to\navoid it so then the other thing that\nyou can do if that's even too\nemotionally charged for you you can\nwrite about what happened or this week\nyou can just jot down thoughts that you\nhave things that you want to think about\nthings that you want to jot down right\nand you may say but but then what's the\npoint of that like I don't need to recap\nwhat happened this week or what happened\ntoday that doesn't do me any good and\nthat's where once again I think you're\nkind of missing the point which is that\nthe goal is not cognitive the goal is\nnot to logically decide side at the end\nlike pros and cons lists that's not what\nthe goal is the goal is to actually\nremember what we're missing in society\nis time and space idle time for our mind\nto kind of digest what's happened to us\nso all you need to do is engage in some\nkind of activity that gives your mind\nthat time and space it actually doesn't\nneed to be very goal oriented so you can\nwrite about emotional experiences you\ncan write about your day you can jot\ndown thoughts or ideas or things that\nyou're interested in all right so\nsometimes I'll when I Journal I'll kind\nof make notes about philosophy or\nscience or what I think is wrong with\nthe world and all of those things can be\nincredibly productive because what we're\nreally trying to do is give our minds\nsome more of that time and space to\nactually do that deep emotional work\nwhich it'll do on its own you don't have\nto Speed it along now a couple of other\nthings that people will do to sort of\nhelp with emotional processing so you\ncan of course work with a professional\nso especially depending on the kind of\nprocessing you're trying to do I'd say a\ntherapist is a really good idea if\nyou're the kind of processing you're\ntrying to do is to try to figure out\nokay what do I want want to do with my\nlife am I looking for direction or am I\nlooking to unburden myself from the past\nif your primary goal is to unburden\nyourself from the past I'd definitely\nrecommend therapy if your goal is to try\nto figure out what you want from this\nlife I think coaching or spirituality is\nactually like a better fit so there are\nother things that I think are really\nreally conducive to this so remember\nthat the requirements that our ancestors\nuse were sort of rote physical activity\nwith mental idle time so any activity\nlike that I think will sort of help you\nemotionally process so my personal take\nis like I love hiking and we sort of\nknow this right we know that when people\ngo hiking for three months in the\nmountains they come back as different\nhuman beings right like they're like\nthey know what they want from Life they\nlike found themselves in in you know the\nHimalayas after a six-month hike and\nthey like just become different people\nand if you kind of think a little bit\nabout it well hold on a second how does\nthat work well essentially what they did\nis gave themselves a steroid shot of\nemotional processing they gave\nthemselves so much idle time and\nphysical activity that they processed a\nbunch of stuff and it all happened\nsomewhat subconsciously that they come\nback as transformed people so nature I\nthink absolutely helps but it's really\nthose couple of components that you have\nto have some amount of physical Demand\nwith mental idleness without a clear\nmental goal because that's not really\nemotional processing so these are a\ncouple of tips that I'd really suggest\nif you're someone who feels like going\nthrough life just takes more and more\nout of you what I really found is that\npeople really struggle with this because\nevery experience becomes has to be\nperfect because you can't afford the\nloss does that make sense like you know\nyou can't waste your life dating this\none person because if you've wasted two\nyears on this person what are you gonna\nlike that's those two years are gone and\nyou're never going to be able to get\nthem back and we've lost the ability to\nrecover from our injuries in life which\nis part of the reason that we've become\nso miserly with actually making\ncommitments right and if I can't recover\nfrom the emotional damage if I'm going\nto be traumatized by dating this person\nI have to be so much more hesitant to\ndate them in the first place as I become\nhesitant to date them in the first place\nI stop actually living life because I'm\nafraid of making mistakes and so I think\nwhat we've really lost more than\nanything else is the ability to\nemotionally process and as we get little\npieces of our soul clipped Away by the\nexperiences of life and as we turn to\ntechnology we we don't really allow\nourselves to heal and recover from it\nbecause technology is so good at\ndistracting and so if you find yourself\nin this kind of situation I'd strongly\nrecommend you take a look at emotional\nprocessing you start to do some of these\nactivities like journal or meditate or\ngo see a therapist or coach or if you've\ngot the time go find yourself in the\nHimalayas for six months like that's\nfantastic go do that but in the absence\nof that hopefully this has been a little\nbit helpful and if you want to start\nsomewhere start with journaling\nforeign"
