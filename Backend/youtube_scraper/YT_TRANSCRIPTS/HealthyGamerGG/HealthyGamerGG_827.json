    "video_title": "Does Money Actually Buy Happiness? A Psychiatrist Explains",
    "transcript": "so people would give someone like a nice\nexpensive chocolate and they'd ask them\nto eat the chocolate and what we sort of\nfound is that if you eat the chocolate\njust by itself and you really sit down\nand you enjoy it it actually like brings\nyou a lot of Happiness if you tell\npeople how much the chocolate costs or\nespecially if they have to pay for it it\nreduces the happiness so a lot of people\nwonder whether money buys happiness or\nnot right there's kind of this age-old\ndebate of does money buy happiness and\nthere's even been some research on this\nstuff right where people are kind of\nlike uh I think there was a very famous\nthere's a very famous like happiness\ncourse at Yale that cites some of these\nstudies that essentially what\npsychologists who look at happiness have\ndiscovered is that if you make like\nbetween 100 and 150k a year I think the\nnumber was 100K but I think there's been\ninflation that money does buy happiness\nbut up to a certain point and that\nBeyond a certain point of money we it\nactually doesn't correlate with\nincreased happiness at all and so we\nsort of know right now based on this\nlike new scientific research that does\nto a certain degree money buys happiness\nbut on the flip side we also know that\nthere are these like spiritual\nTraditions with people like monks right\nand yogis and these are people that will\nsort of say like yeah you know these are\nlike these are the people that their job\nis to try to become happy like that's\nwhat enlightenment is right it's this\nlike mythical state of like permanent\nhappiness Nirvana Bliss and they\ncultivate that state and apparently the\nway that you do that is not by acquiring\nmoney but actually by disacquiring money\nby actively getting rid of all of your\nstuff so we have these monks who are\nsitting there meditating all the time\nand they're apparently the ones that are\nlike the closest to becoming perfectly\nhappy and so then we're kind of stuck\nright because it's like okay so wait\nhold on a second but which one should I\ndo like I want to be happy in life so\nwhat do I do do I grind for money do I\ntry to make a hundred thousand dollars a\nyear do I make 150 000 a year or do I\nbecome like a monk like should I learn\nhow to settle right so should I learn to\nlike be happy with what I have or should\nI try to get more and if you say I\nshould be like a monk but whole hold on\na second because there's all these\nresearchers that say I need to make 100\nto 150k a year they say that that's\nwhat's going to make me happy so we\ndon't know right we don't know like\nshould I chase money or should I not\nchase money I want to be happy but which\none is it and then then we run into this\nother problem which is that okay if we\ndecide that all right so let's say we're\ngoing to listen to the Yale researchers\nright because it's Yale and they're\nbrilliant and they say 100K a year Okay\ncool so then the question is all right\nso if I need to make 100K a year to be\nhappy should I major in something that\nmakes me miserable so that I can get\nmake money because that's what everyone\ntells me to do and then we enter into\nthis other debate which is like passion\nor do I major in stem do you like become\nan artist and do I make like video games\nor board games or do I like get a job\nthat provides like security and money\nlike do I major in computer science or\nelectrical engineering or chemical\nengineering so which is it right so okay\nhold on a second so if you're saying\nthat I need 100K to be happy let me live\nlet me major in something that's going\nto get me a good job and once I have\nlots of money I'll be happy right so\nthen that you sort of go down that path\nbut people don't seem happy doing that\nand now you're kind of confused because\nthen you like kind of go back to the\nmonk thing and it's like okay as I if\nI'm studying in engineering should I\nchange Majors or should I push through\nit right and eventually happiness will\ncome so we all get tangled up around\nthis business of okay should I try to be\na monk or should I grind to become happy\nshould I make lots of money and then\nlike that'll kind of buy me happiness\nlike which one which one should I do and\nthe interesting thing is that I don't\nthink that these two paths are actually\ndifferent at all in fact I think what\nI'd love to share with you all today is\nas we understand the nature of happiness\nstress we understand what money does for\nus and what it doesn't do for us and\nfurthermore once we understand what\nmonks actually do when they meditate\nwhat we'll actually discover is that\nthis problem of okay should I major in\nsomething that I dislike should I pick a\ncareer because it makes me money or\nshould I do what I love should I go the\nmonk route and move away from material\npossessions or should I try to make a\nbunch of money because that'll make me\nhappy what we'll actually discover is\nthat it's neither or they're both\nthey're all the same there's actually\nOne path there's actually no discrepancy\nor disagreement between the Monk and the\nhappiness researchers so let's start by\nunderstanding a little bit around about\nstress so the first thing that we've got\nto understand is that when we're\nstressed out it has all kinds of\ndifferent effects on our body and our\nmind so we know that when we're stressed\nout our body will secrete different\nkinds of hormones or chemicals right so\nwe'll release things like adrenaline\nwe'll release things like cortisol and\nwhat cortisol does to our body and our\nbrain is quite diverse so it'll do\nthings like make us more sensitive to\nstimuli so this is a huge thing that\ncortisol does so for example cortisol\ntravels to this part of our brain called\nthe reticular activating formation which\ngoverns how we sleep and How Deeply we\nsleep and it basically activates some so\nthat smaller noises will wake us up okay\nso like when we have cortisol in our\nsystem our sleep is light we don't get\ndeep restful sleep but it's not just\nthat kind of stimulus that it makes us\nsensitive to cortisol also increases the\nsensitivity of our pain receptors so\nthings will hurt more when we're in a\nhigh stressful State emotions will hurt\nmore physical injuries will hurt more we\nalso know that for example autoimmune\nconditions like eczema asthma psoriasis\narthritis all of these things will flare\nup and will become more active when we\nare stressed out we also know that\ncortisol for example makes a lot of our\ninput so our eyes our ears things like\nthat a lot of our sensory organs will\nbecome hypersensitive as well because\nthe goal of cortisol is not to Keep Us\nAlive for the moment it's to help us\nstay alive over 24 or 48 hour period so\nthe classic example of when cortisol is\nreleased is if I run into let's say a\ntiger in the woods and then I run away\nfrom the tiger that's usually governed\nby adrenaline but once I get away from\nthe tiger for a long period of time I\nneed to stay alert and that's\nessentially what cortisol does and what\ncortisol does is sacrifices long-term\nhealth for short-term survival so now we\nlive in a society where cortisol can\nalmost be like constantly flowing\nthrough our system because in the past\nwhen we were hunter-gatherers it wasn't\nthat big of a deal because you know we'd\nrun into a tiger every now and then but\nnow what's happening is like when when\nthe first of the month rolls around and\nI pay my rent I'm already worrying about\nhow to pay my rent at the end of the\nmonth so I'm in this constant stress\nState as I increase this amount of\nstress I start to worry more I become\nsensitive to negative stimuli I have\ndifficulty sleeping I kind of feel bad\nso this is what stress does to us it\nmakes it very hard to be happy when\nwe're in a stressful State because I'm\nnot sleeping I'm sensing of the pain\nstimuli I'm worrying all the time the\nmind of someone who has a bunch of\ncortisol in their system is also looking\ninto the future so I can't enjoy the\npresent right I just paid my rent on the\nfirst of the month and I'm already\nworrying about the 30th of the month how\nam I going to make my rent next month so\nI can't even enjoy the 29 days that I\nhave to pay rent so we start to see that\nfrom a physiologic and psychologic\nstandpoint stress and a lack of\nHappiness are correlated so what does\nthat have to do with our discussion\naren't we talking about money and\nhappiness well let's try to understand\nwhat a 100K buys us or what 150k buys us\nbecause we know that this seems to be\nthe magic number and if you think about\nwhat 100 to 150k buys you that 200k 300K\nor 400k don't or that 50k 60k or 70k\ndon't right why is this number magical\nthe number is magical because that\namount of money buys us security so I\ndon't have to worry about paying my rent\nusually if I get sick I can afford to\npay my bills I can afford food if my car\nbreaks down I can probably probably get\nit fixed I may be able to travel some I\nmay be able to do some amount of\nenjoyment I may be able to do some kind\nof recreation I'm allowed to have sort\nof recreational experiences at 100 to\n150k so if we really look at what's\nmagical about that number what it really\nprovides for us is security what it\nreally does is that's the amount of\nmoney that we need to lower our cortisol\nlevels right because now I'm not\nstressed about making unless I'm\noverextended and stuff like that and you\nall may know people who make 150k who\nare stressed out of their minds because\nthey're they're the you know they live\nlike multi-millionaires when they only\nmake 100K so you can absolutely get into\nthat situation but it turns out that\nwith the happiness researchers\ndiscovered essentially was that this\namount of money provides security and so\nnow let's think about the monks for a\nsecond right because I mean they're not\nlike you know what's their deal like\nthey don't have any money they certainly\ndon't have 100K they don't have 150k but\nthey seem to be pretty happy and pretty\nchill so now I'm going to ask you all\nthe question do monks have security does\na monk need to worry about whether\nthey're sleeping at night does a monk\nneed to worry about where their next\nmeal is coming from does their monk need\nto worry about getting promoted does a\nmonk need to worry about politics with\ntheir boss maybe right depending on\nwhere you're among but so this is what's\nreally interesting is we we sort of say\nthat monks are not materialistic but\nwhat we also actually see is that monks\nare actually very secure in their\nday-to-day life for the most part like\npeople pay for their food through\ndonations they're like housing is\ngenerally like accommodate most monks\ndon't have to worry about paying rent at\nthe end of the month there's usually\nsome kind of charitable organization or\nsomething like that where like monks\nwill have you know they'll get medical\ncare and things like that like I I\nhaven't seen you know I've never seen a\nGoFundMe from a monk trying to pay\nmedical bills you'll see GoFundMe for\nfrom people all the time especially in\nthe United States but it's not like\nmonks are out there you know struggling\nto make ends meet now some of them will\nchoose to be uh you know like poor and\nessentially we'll take vows of poverty\nand we'll then we'll also rely on the\ncharity of others but if you kind of\nthink about how can that develop as a\ntradition how can I choose being broke\nas a way of life because that's what the\nmonks do they're like my way of life is\nI ain't gonna do [ __ ] and they're still\nalive after 10 years 20 years 30 years\nhow is that it's because they actually\nhave their security provided for them\nit's the first thing to understand is\nthat the happiness research in the monks\nactually agree that the purpose of money\nis security when it comes to happiness\nthe second thing to understand is that\nif we look at happiness there's a\ndifference between gaining happiness and\nlosing happiness and especially with\nwhat insecurity does is it takes\nhappiness away it doesn't give you\nhappiness but it makes it so that if you\nhave some amount of Happiness let's say\nI have 50 units of happiness but then I\ncan't pay my rent at the month at the\nend of the month I lose 30 units of\nHappiness that's what stress does to us\nit takes our happiness away it doesn't\ndirectly give it to us so this is the\nfirst thing right is now that we kind of\nlook at this once we understand how\nstress Works once we understand what\nmoney actually does for happiness and\neven when we look at monks we start to\ndiscover that actually all of these\nthings are aligned the purpose of money\nin in terms of how much it deals with\nhappiness is essentially security now\neven if we know that it still doesn't\nreally answer our original question\nright because our original question is\nlike should I major and establish should\nI become a stem person like electrical\nengineering or like lawyer or whatever\nor should I do what I love it doesn't\nhelp us even this amount of information\ndoesn't help us make the choice which\none should I do because if you're saying\nthey're actually consistent I still\ndon't know how to pick and that's why\nthankfully there's like way more\nresearch on happiness this I'm going to\nshare with you all a little bit more so\nthe first thing it appears that a lot of\nhappiness correlates with something\ncalled savoring so savoring is the\nability to enhance or extend a positive\nemotional experience I take some issue\nwith the word emotional there but a\npositive experience we know what it\nmeans to savor something right but\nessentially what happens is the more\nthat you're able to savor things the\nmore happy you are and we also know that\nfor example money can negatively impact\nsavoring so if I buy there's literally\npeople that studies on this right so\nthere's a causative this is a causative\nstudy by the way not correlation which\nis a huge difference so people would\ngive someone like a nice expensive\nchocolate and they'd ask them to eat the\nchocolate and what we sort of found is\nthat if you eat the chocolate just by\nitself and you really sit down and you\nenjoy it it actually like brings you a\nlot of Happiness if you tell people how\nmuch the chocolate costs or especially\nif they have to pay for it it reduces\nthe happiness now this is a really\nimportant finding okay because what this\nmeans is that if I'm rich and I buy\nsomething nice and I think about how\nmuch I paid for it it will actually\nreduce the quality of savoring this is\nwhat in in scientific research is called\nkind of the Dual nature of money and\nhappiness which is that money will allow\nyou for certain possessions and things\nlike that we'll get to that in a second\nbut the more that you think about money\nthe less you're actually able to savor\nthings and so this is a really important\nthing to understand is when we're really\ntalking about what is happiness we're\nsort of really zeroing on on this\nquality of savoring there are a couple\nof other really interesting things that\nwe discovered from happiness research\nthe first is that spending money on\nexperiences is worth more than spending\nmoney on possessions okay so like if you\nhave some amount of Happiness doing\nstuff with it as opposed to getting\nstuff with it will actually make you\nmore happy so let's say taking trips or\nlike going white water rafting or going\nto a museum like paying tickets for a\nmuseum is worth more happiness than\nlet's say a micro transaction in a video\ngame so getting more stuff and being\nable to do things doing stuff is\nactually worth more happiness than\ngetting stuff second really interesting\nthing is that savoring experiences that\nare ordinary or extraordinary leads to\nabout the same amount of Happiness so\nthat sort of means is that it's not like\na 15 cup of coffee is more enjoyable\nthan a five dollar cup of coffee or a\nthree dollar cup of coffee or a ten\ndollar cup of coffee the experiences\nthat we go through you don't have to\nvisit the best museum in the world you\ncan just visit a decent Museum that sort\nof prioritizing experience is important\nbut it's not like extraordinary\nexperiences are worth more than ordinary\nexperiences so I can go climb to the top\nof Mount Everest which maybe that's an\nexperience but or I can hike for an hour\nand that's a certain degree that there's\na lot of happiness in both of those so\nit's not like the fancier stuff that\ngets posted on social media with the\nreally epic Vistas in the tallest\nmountain in the world is is better than\nthe second tallest mountain in the world\nlike if you climb to the top of any\nmountain and you look out it's going to\nbe really enjoyable so it's not like the\nextraordinary is actually greater than\nthe Ordinary second really and really\ninteresting thing third thing that's\nalso kind of novel from happiness\nresearch is that generally speaking\nspending money on other people brings\nmore happiness than spending money on\nyourself so this is kind of interesting\nas well so we see it like a lot of the\nvalue of altruism whereas like if I work\nhard and I give something to another\nhuman being that actually makes me\nhappier than having stuff myself and so\nif we look at some of these novel\ndiscoveries about the nature of money\nand happiness we discover a lot of\nthings that are also actually very\nconsistent with monks so the first is\nthat a monk can Savor a simple cup of\ntea right like especially if you go to\nlike with this monasteries and stuff\nthey'll have like\num you know barley tea or green tea or\nsomething like that and they'll sit\nthere and they'll like enjoy like a\nsimple cup of tea and it's in the\nenjoyment of the simple thing the ACT\nthat's really where the happiness comes\nfrom and that's really what monks train\nto do right right because if you think\nabout okay what is meditation if you\nlook at like these Zen Masters being a\nmonk is a formal training in savoring\nbeing a monk is a formal training and\nextracting as much happiness as we can\nout of any experience and so the cool\nthing about being a monk is the more you\nlevel up your savoring skill the more\nthat you are able to actually extract\npositive enjoyment out of even seemingly\nneutral or negative experiences and\nthat's really where the monk training is\nis really valuable but as we end up\ndiscovering you know now we get a little\nbit closer to the answer to our question\nwhich is a lot of people will say like\nokay so should I should I go down this\ncareer path even if it doesn't make me\nhappy because I'll get money because\nmoney buys happiness right up to a\ncertain point well no that's not really\nhow it works money provides Security\nmoney also gives us the opportunity to\ncreate experiences money gives us to a\ncertain degree the ability to help\nothers which will make us happy so\nthat's what money does but the basic\nproblem is that we think that the Choi\nis what's going to make us happy right\nbecause that's what really screws us it\nwas like should I pick a or should I\npick B and the real lesson to take away\nfrom all this stuff is that the choice\nis not what brings the happiness it's\nthe way that we experience the choice\nthat brings happiness so it's not about\npicking the right major it's how do you\nlive your life with a particular major\nright so even if I pick a major that I\ndon't like and I work in a way that you\nknow I don't find it doesn't really\nattract me but I can still enjoy lots of\nthings about it right so I've had this\nexperience myself where like you know\nyou can still really enjoy a cup of\ncoffee in the morning even if you hate\nyour job and you can really enjoy the\nfeeling of relief when you're done with\nyour job that you hate and then the\nother really wild thing is that even\nparts of your job once you learn how to\nsavor there are parts of your job that\nyou used to dislike which you can start\nto like so what we actually discover is\nthat like the monks and all the\nhappiness we search are actually\nperfectly aligned and I think the best\nexample of this that I'll leave y'all\nwith actually comes from the world of\ndating so right now everyone is out\nthere they're looking for the perfect\npartner and that was the promise of the\ndating apps right is that you tell us\nexactly what you want and we will find\nit for you we will look amongst all\nthese billions of people on the planet\nyou give us a checklist of everything\nthat you're looking for and we'll match\nyou with the perfect person because\nthat's what's going to lead to happiness\nright it's getting everything that you\nwant whereas I come from a culture that\nit traditionally has arranged marriages\nand if you kind of think about it having\nan arranged marriage you don't get to\npick [ __ ] you don't get to pick any of\nit someone else picked it for you and so\nif picking what we want is the way that\nwe get happiness then it should follow\nthat everyone who does online dating\nshould be perfectly happy and that no\none who has an arranged marriage will\never be happy right because they have no\nchoice because the choice is what\ndetermines the happiness but what we\nactually discover is that if you look at\narranged marriages it's people who\nchange their experience within the\nmarriage it's not the choice itself it's\nhow they live in the marriage it's how\nthey learn to love someone it's how they\nlearn to accept someone it's how the\nother person learns to love and accept\nthem that you can have incredibly happy\nmarriages so the pro problem that we\nface when we're trying to think okay\nshould I do a or should I do B which one\nwill make me happy first of all there's\nno there's no dispute between the\nhappiness researchers and the monks we\nall actually agree that you need some\namount of security and then the rest of\nit is determined by how you live your\nlife that you prioritize experiences\nover possessions that you try to use\nyour money to help other people as\nopposed to yourself but you need to be\nable to have the money to help other\npeople and still pay your rent and the\nmore that you you begin to realize that\nthen you'll start to realize that it's\nnot the choice that brings happiness\nit's what you do with it it's how you\nlive after it's how you learn how to\nsavor whatever comes after the choice\nthat will ultimately bring you the\nhappiness oh yes people are asking love\ncan be learned 100 so if you want to\nunderstand why there's so little love in\nthe world it's because we forgot that\nlearn love is a skill that you can learn\nand we assumed that it was something\nthat was pre-packaged perfectly formed\nand then you go find it so this is like\nwe're like a society who thinks that\nchairs can be found on the street\ninstead of being built and now we're\nwandering around the whole society is\nwandering around looking for chairs\nbecause in your household there were\nchairs so he stopped learning how to\nlove and instead we started looking for\nit so Dr K confused about picking\nbetween Pro gaming and CS major what\nshould I do so I can't tell if you're\ntrolling or not but let's assume that's\na serious question because that's a\ncommon concern for a lot of people\ntrying to think about sincere interest\nin Pro gaming so I'm going to share\nsomething okay don't read too much into\nit I've worked with about seven or eight\nEsports teams let's say and sometimes\nwhat happens after a team has trouble is\nthey think about should I switch this\nplayer out or not should we find a new\nnew player they think which is the right\nchoice should we stick with what we have\nor should we find a new player and\nthat's where like my answer to them is\nthere isn't a right choice or a wrong\nchoice it's that whatever you pick is\ngoing to require work all that's\ndifferent is the kind of work that it's\ngoing to take after your choice see we\nthink that making the right choice\ncreates the right result but it's not\nthe choice that that creates the result\nit's what you do after the choice so\nI'll say this a lot also like in in\nmedical school where people are like\nokay well I love surgery and I love\nPsychiatry which one should I pick which\none will make me happier and that's\nwhere I think people are losing the\npoint they're like thinking like if I\npick something it'll make me happy and\nthat's why those people wind up unhappy\nbecause they think that the happiness\ncomes from the choice it's created\nafterward and as long as you think that\na particular thing is going to make me\nyou happy and you strive for that thing\nand then you get it and then what\nhappens those people aren't happy you'll\nget that this is why people who look for\nhappiness outside of themselves never\nfind it and I don't mean that in like a\nhere's my spiritual tweet for the day I\nmean like literally think about it right\nif I think that because they think that\nhappiness is just like something that\nyou acquire right it's like you open a\ntreasure chest and Boop here's the\nhappiness I found it now I'm good it\ndoesn't work like that it's created this\nis why the research on savoring is so\nimportant what we discover is that\nprioritizing experiences and learning\nhow to savor is actually what we leads\nto happiness and so you can go and this\nis what we end up with right like I want\nthis thing this thing will make me happy\nand you get that thing makes you happy\nfor like a day then you want something\nelse you're so excited to play this\nvideo game this video game is so great\nso great oh my God it's so much fun and\nthen you finish and then what how long\ndoes the happiness from the video game\nlast if video games actually made people\nhappy the industry would be dead we\nwouldn't need any more because we'd be\ndone so this is what it means it's not\nlike some profound like oh like\nhappiness comes from women like\nliterally it's not like some weird\nspiritual metaphor it's like you can eat\nas many [ __ ] cookies as you want to\nin life you can eat a cookie today\nyou're gonna want one tomorrow you can\neat one tomorrow you're gonna want one\nthe next day you get tired for them for\na little while then you'll want\nsomething else and then you're gonna eat\nthat and you'll be happy for a little\nwhile and then a month later you're\ngonna want a cookie again this is not\nsome profound spiritual realization this\nis just like just pay attention to\nyourself for like all of five minutes\nand you will discover this that the\nhappiness doesn't come from the object\nitself it comes from your experience of\nthe object so should you major in CS or\nshould you become a pro gamer that\ndepends on how you live your life after\nafter making the decision there isn't a\nright decision or a wrong decision\nshould I take job a or should I take job\nB well job a has these benefits and\nthese weaknesses job B has these\nbenefits and these weaknesses so whether\nyou're happy or not is not which job you\nchoose it's which way are you going to\nplay the game after you pick a job am I\ngoing to take advantage of a b and c and\nam I going to supplement and deal with d\ne and f that are the weaknesses if the\nanswer is yes you will be happy in your\njob so what we've done is a society of\nwe have seeded control of our happiness\nto the outside world we've given up\nwe've given up on our relationships\nbecause finding the right person I met\nthe one it's the search for the one\nwhich implies that the happiness from\nthe relationship comes from the other\nperson and boy when we surrendered our\nhappiness in a relationship to the other\nperson that's when we get [ __ ] because\nthey're responsible for it now and\nwhether we become happy or not depends\non their behavior we lose control of Our\nLives same thing is happening in work\nthis job will make me happy as soon as\nas I get to the end of the rainbow I\nwill be happy and then you're not happy\nso what do you do you go find another\nrainbow and then you grind towards the\nend of it and then you're not happy for\nlong enough so you look for another\nrainbow this promotion next promotion\nnext promotion 50 Grand more 100 Grand\nmore 200 Grand more that'll be happy\nright and all y'all are like if you\ndon't make go 200 Grand a year 300 Grand\na year like of course that'll make me\nhappy think about all the crap I'll be\nable to do it there's research that says\nthat after 150k it doesn't do anything\nwe've seated control of our happiness to\nthe outside world and boy has the\noutside world loved taking it from us\nright oh yeah\nyeah I'm gonna make you happy yeah you\nwant happiness I can give you happiness\n5.99 this DLC 2.99 this micro\ntransaction you need more lives on this\nlevel of jelly whatever crunch 99 Cents\nI'll give you I'll make you happy just\njust give me a dollar give me two give\nme five give me ten give me a hundred\ngive me a thousand I want to be happy I\nneed I need a a diamond in order to be\nhappy in this relationship I need a\ndiamond that's worth fifty thousand\ndollars without the diamond I'm not\ngonna be happy this is what I need to be\nhappy I I deserve it I deserve the best\nbecause I have self-esteem and in that\nmoment what you're doing is surrendering\nyour happiness to literally a chunk of\ncarbon and we wonder why no one is happy\ntoday because we gave it up and there\nare people who are happy to profit off\nof it they're like great you go girl you\nwant a 50k let me show you ads for 60k\ndiamonds and we wonder it's not a knock\nagainst women by the way men are the\nsame for men it can be I need my\nsignificant other we're assuming a\nheterosexual relationship to have tits\nthat are this big\nsame thing\nsports cars whatever so if you're\nwondering what should I do so here's\nwhat I'd say start by prioritizing your\nsecurity learn how to savor and\nprioritize experiences over possessions\nand spend your money on other people at\nleast some these are the four things\nthat'll make you happy in life easy ah\nthis is great so this is a wonderful\nquestion how does the experience of\ngoing to a museum differ from the\nexperience of gaming beautiful so the\nmain difference is one is easier to\nsavor and one is harder to savor so\nremember the ability to savor is the\nability to enhance and extend a positive\nemotional experience so gaming is only\nfun while you're gaming and then the\nsecond you're done with a match what do\nyou have to do to continue having fun\nyou don't save her at all you just jump\nright in so the difference between a\nmuseum is a museum is more conducive to\nsavoring and then people may say but\nhold on a second Dr K I've savored some\nof my video game experiences as have I\nand those are the video game experiences\nthat I love and don't regret for a\nmoment that's what being a healthy gamer\nis about savoring your game I still\nremember ladder matches from Starcraft 1\non island maps when I was playing\nprotoss like I still remember Dungeons\nand dragon sessions I still remember a\ncouple of Epic comebacks in Dota I still\nremember playing Unreal Tournament those\nare the experiences that are worth\nsaving but what I think is actually like\nworse about gaming is that gaming itself\nis not monolithic there's some games\nthat could be savored like I think Eldon\nring is moving in that direction right\nyou can Savor Elder ring you don't have\nto micro transact your way to anything\nit's not about winning or losing it's\nlike there isn't a best weapon and a\nworse weapon the best weapon is what\npeople like what kind of armor do you\nwant to wear it's like fashion Souls\nlike forget about best I'm gonna create\nan experience and even if you're a video\ngame designer and this is where like\nwe've done Consulting for video game\ncompanies what we Advocate is this is\nthat we think about video games is evil\nthey're not evil parents think about\nthem as evil whether they're evil or not\ndepends on how we make them so like even\nif you're playing a video video games\nsavor it I know it's kind of bizarre\nafter you play for a little while go for\na walk think about how much fun you had\ntoday because one of two things will\nhappen either you'll savor it and it'll\nbe just as fun to walk as it will to\nplay or if you're like me at one point\nyou'll make a shocking discovery which\nis that actually you didn't enjoy it and\nactually you feel like you're waking up\nfrom being passed out from drinking too\nmuch and you're hungover from playing\nway too much and that's when you know\nyou're an unhealthy gamer if you can't\nsavor it don't play it savoring is the\nability to enhance and prolong or extend\na positive experience\nforeign"
