    "transcript": "so that's when I started planning to\nhurt people and and so what I'm kind of\nhearing is that you were already being\njudged for being guilty of particular\nthings that you had not done welcome my\nfriend\nwell\num so let's start with this can you tell\nme a little bit about what you go by\nuh so I typically go by JC or Jeremy in\nthe real world so either is fine so um\nthanks for coming today JC uh and and I\nunderstand that you have a little bit of\nan unusual background or experience\nyes very much so and can you tell us a\nlittle bit about that\nuh so growing up uh\nI hit a point in my life uh in middle\nschool where I almost hurt a bunch of\npeople okay\nand can you tell me a little bit about\nhow you kind of got to that point\nuh so\nkind of tldr uh very unstable home life\nplus being bullied okay\nuh to give like a very quick recap uh my\nolder brother when I was six was\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder okay uh\nand my dad was retired Navy and a\nfirefighter so he only really understood\nrank and wasn't very emotionally\navailable okay uh he also had had a\nvideo game addiction so he would come\nhome when he wasn't working and\nbasically sit on the computer and play\nuh on a website called Pogo so like card\ngames and stuff like that interesting\nand watch the TV uh my mother was hard\nworking as well my older sister was very\ncontrolling and they were also very\nSheltering because of what they did as\nwork\nwhat does that mean well they were very\nSheltering because of what they did his\nwork uh so my dad as a firefighter dealt\nwith a lot of the worst parts of society\nsometimes\nuh I remember one time I came from home\nschool when I was about nine\nand my mom stopped me and was just like\nhey uh do you remember that girl that\nwent missing uh your dad was on the\nsearch party that found them so you're\ngoing to be extra good today and give\nyour dad space uh\nso that was\nwhen you have parents that deal with\nthat type of situation fairly often uh\nthey're very protective of their kids\nbecause they don't want that to be their\nkid interesting so so when your mom was\nsaying\nyou need to be extra good today you're\nsort of interpreting that as them being\nprotective of you\nyes so it's not necessarily of me but\njust like don't cause any drama like you\nknow if you don't get the dessert you\nwant don't\nyou know make a big deal out of it so\nmore\ndon't let drama happen that doesn't need\nto happen because your dad's already\nstressed I see so so for you to not add\nto the stress yeah and complaining about\nI'm just a little bit confused because\nwhat does that have to do with being\noverprotective\nuh so just with my dad constantly\ndealing with like finding and dealing\nwith kids in very bad situations and him\nnot wanting me to end up in those\nsituations uh they pretty much didn't\nlet me do anything outside of got it\nlike to maybe a block away so like\nalways individual range of the house\nyeah never going to birthday parties or\nsomething unless they were physically\nthere but they were always working all\nthe time so that makes a lot of sense\nwhat I was kind of just noticing is that\nit seems that\nyou know your mom was also placing some\ndegree of responsibility on you for\nkeeping things smooth because your dad\nwas already stressed out yeah\nyeah wow that's wild dude so it sounds\nlike your your family was quite\num\nunderstandably\nyeah concerned about your safety and and\nused I think the word controlling\nearlier\nyeah so so it sounds like you were and\nthat's what you would call an unstable\nhome life\nuh there's a lot more that kind of comes\nwith that just because uh keep in mind\nthis is also the first generation with\nthe internet and social media uh so\nFacebook is literally coming out okay\nwhen I'm hitting middle school so okay\nthey don't know how to deal with that\nbecause nobody knows how to deal with\nthat because that's never existed before\nuh there's not a lot of good resources\non Mental Health uh so having a child\nthat's diagnosed with this relatively\nnew disease uh that's bipolar disorder\nokay and you said your brother was six\nuh I was six when he was dying you were\nsix okay okay so he was I think 11 or\n12. okay\nuh and so everything that comes with\nthat uh it didn't make for a very stable\nor welcoming home life what does that um\nand if you don't want to share more\ndetails you know about your brother and\nfamily like that's totally fine but I'm\nkind of curious\num what comes with that because I've\nseen a lot of different responses to an\n11 year old being diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder uh so drug use uh just very big\nmood swings it could be fun hanging out\nand then all of a sudden he's very angry\nuh very rebellious so a lot of arguing\nwith my parents and so I'm the little\nkid just sitting in the corner\nlistening to yelling matches uh in the\nliving room and and what do you remember\nabout your experience of those things\nuh so a lot of it I just essentially was\njust like my job is just to stay out of\nthe way and just not be noticed and okay\nmakes sense right like so yeah stuff is\ngoing down in the house and and you're\nnot really sure it's not your\nresponsibility to deal with you're\nyou're kind of trying to be you don't\nwant to add to the you don't have to\npour gasoline on the fire so yeah you\ngotta kind of just\ntry to keep your head down yeah it makes\na lot of sense\nyeah so a couple of that with school\nlife uh so in second grade uh I became a\ngifted kid uh my condolences\nhow did you become a gifted kid\nuh I was just really good at math and uh\nthere was like some test that they had\nme take and like I was already doing\nlike sixth grade level math in like\nsecond grade and they're like okay yeah\nyou need to be challenged more and so\nwe'll take you out of school for a week\nand put you in these other classes to\nchallenge you more\nand what was that like\nuh that was an interesting uh there was\na level of clout that came with it at\nleast\nat like the young age uh as it got older\nit became less cool but\nokay so it sounded like you were a\nlittle bit proud of being a gifted kid\nyeah yeah it's like good for you yeah\nyeah so but also you know when you are a\ngifted kid you tend to\nnot develop those social skills and not\nalready kind of have them naturally so I\nlike to IQ my way out of things help you\nunderstand that what do you mean by tend\nto not develop social skills how's that\nrelated to being gifted\nuh well I guess it had more to do with\njust my situation in general with my\nparents being overprotective uh like I\nwould I never went to a birthday party\nuntil I think I was like 12. wow and so\nlike it was I didn't have anything\noutside of school when it came to social\ninteractions okay well school and church\nbut Church there wasn't really much\ninteracting it was just sitting there\nand listening to the guy talk for the\nmost part okay\nand do you mind if I ask what kind of\nchurch you were attending growing up uh\nit was a Southern Baptist Church okay\num and what do you mean by I was\nintrigued by this phrase IQ your way out\nof things can you tell me about that uh\nso kind of think like character build\nlike you always you kind of Stack Up in\none stat like the IQ stats so it's like\nI'm not gonna I don't have social skills\nbut what I can do is study psychology\nand then\nbe like okay well I don't understand\nthis necessarily but psychology says if\nI do this people will like me and so\nit's not necessarily the intuitive\nsocial skills that's taking more broad\nGeneral things and\napplying the intellect to it and did you\nfind that that was effective\nuh much later on in life uh there was a\nlot of other things that I had to deal\nwith first as we'll kind of get to okay\nsure\nso that's kind of growing up up until\nmiddle school and so this is where like\nthat lack of social skills really\nstarted to show okay\nand bullying became a very like daily\npart of my life and then also puberty uh\nI was also in the closet and this is in\nthe south in early 2000s so there's not\nuh any type of positivity towards that\nokay or understanding of it uh to say\nthe least so and can I answer that\nquestions about that so when you say\nbullying um what what did that look like\nwhy did it have like what's your\nunderstanding of how it started\nuh people figured out that I didn't have\nsocial skills and so they would be just\nlike hey like this person likes you you\nshould go say this because they're into\nthis and then I'd go do that because I\nwanted friends and then they would react\nnegatively towards that interaction and\nso it was like that type of things okay\nso they realized that you could be taken\nadvantage of and if they told you to do\nsomething\nyeah so that worked for a little bit and\nthen it just name calling uh and then\nthat led to depression and then there\nwas just some\nreally just outright bullying uh we\nwould walk to class and or walk to lunch\nin a line and so there was one time I\nstill vividly remember I was carrying my\nlunchbox\nand there were three kids that were\nliterally trying to jump and Stomp The\nLunchbox out of my hand with a teacher\nthree feet in front of us and the\nteacher was just like y'all should stop\nand like that was their only punishment\nit was them being told to stop and did\nthey stop\nuh they did it one more time and then\nstopped\nand and what do you mean uh stomp on\nyour lunchbox are you holding your\nlunchbox yeah so we're walking in a line\nand so like uh it had a handle\nand so I was just holding it by my side\nand they were walking in line they'd run\nup and then like take their foot and try\nto get it in between the handle got it\nand the rest of the lunchbox and\nliterally just\ntried to stomp it to the ground what\nkind of stuff did you take to launch it\nin Middle School uh so I took a peanut\nbutter sandwich a bag of Doritos and\nthen some sort of like Debbie cake or\nzebra you know Star Crunch one of those\nthings uh and I literally I had that\nevery single day from like the time I\nwas like five up until\nlike I think 11th grade when I finally\nstarted buying school lunches when you\nwhen you uh say peanut butter sandwich\nwas there jelly on there too it was just\npeanut butter no just peanut butter\ninteresting wasn't that dry\nyeah\nI don't know why I just I liked it\nthat's okay\nyeah\none of the very weird rude quirks I had\nthat was inconsequential interesting\nokay so so it sounds like you were\nbullied quite a bit and and I'm also\nhearing that maybe teachers didn't step\nin or I mean did people know you were\nbeing bullied like how did people\nyeah\nour town was very well focused if that\nmakes sense so\num\nuh so\nbasically our our entire Town's economy\nran around the high school football team\nbecause they were so good they were\nnationally ranked uh my sophomore year\nwe had a game that was 103 a six\nwow and football so like\nthat was like everything like the\nsponsorships like it was either that or\nthe military base that was nearby okay\nuh and so athletes got a pass for\nnope\nGigi so you were saying um that that you\ngrew up in a football town yes and\nathletes got a pass yeah so one of the\nkids that was doing it his dad was a\ncoach of a different sport uh and so\nthey said they didn't want to give up on\nSports because that was their big thing\nand so it took a lot for athletes to\nkind of get actually punished for stuff\nI see\nand and so do you remember kind of what\nyou\nwhat you were thinking what you were\nfeeling what your experience of like\ngoing to school as a middle schooler was\nlike\nuh so it was I my goal was just to\nsurvive for quite a while and it there\nwas a point where just like the bullying\njust kept adding up I remember\nthere's one moment in particular where\nuh in gym class afterwards I was getting\nbullied a lot because of I think I\ndropped a pass or something like playing\nflag football or something like that but\nlike\nagain football town so like that's a big\ndeal\nand I just remember\nyou mean you failed to catch a ball yeah\nokay yeah uh and so I don't know if that\ncan't remember exactly what all was said\nI just remember being so angry at being\nbullied and uh nothing being done about\nit uh that I told someone was like so I\nwas really mad and came up to me was\njust like hey what's going on you look\nmad and I was just like I'm going to do\nthis thing to hurt people and then he\nwent and told the teachers as he should\nhave and this person was a peer of yours\nor an adult yes uh it was a peer okay uh\nand so I got suspended for a week and\nthey held a council to decide what to do\nuh and so they put me on some like\nprobationary thing uh once I came back\nfrom being expelled uh they held it\nthey're not from being were you involved\nin that no it was uh teachers and\nadministrators being like okay like\nsomething led to this situation like\nwhat was it and what did they do you\nhave any sense of what they concluded\nuh I don't all I know is that they\nsaid hey if you mess up two more times\nthen you're getting expelled okay\nso so their response was punitive yes\nand what did your how did your family\nreact to this all this stuff like would\nit like you know kind of even tracking\nback did they know that you were being\nbullied\nuh to a certain extent but there was\nvery much like this kind of toughen up\naspect like\nyou just gotta not let it affect you kid\nand like they'll stop if you just don't\nlet them get to you type mentality okay\nI remember specifically uh just to kind\nof address like further address the\ndynamic at home when I was getting\npicked up from school uh that day\nuh\nmy dad said to me in the hallway as we\nwere walking out was do you know how bad\nthis makes me look\nand that Moment's Forever burned into my\nmind uh and I remember walking by and\nthere was a chick that was on the tennis\nteam with me and I like now like helped\nme because like I didn't know what to do\nthere wasn't any type of physical abuse\nor anything going on I want to make that\nclear but there was just a lot of\nemotional neglect and that really\nexemplifies like what home life was like\ndo you remember how you like how you was\nit so it sounds like you mouth helped me\nto an acquaint acquaintance friend\nacquaintance would probably be the best\nway to describe it okay and and what\nwhat were you thinking in that moment do\nyou remember\nuh I was that was also the very first\ntime I had ever gotten trouble at school\nin general okay uh and so there was a\nlot of emotions it's just like why am I\ngetting punished for being bullied why\nis nobody who's supposed to be keeping\nme safe safe why is it that he doesn't\nmy dad doesn't care about how I got to\nthis point he's only mad that it makes\nhim look bad\nthat's rough man so uh\nso when so that kind of happened and\nwe're kind of got out what I had said\nand so when I eventually came back to\nschool it also got out that I could only\nmess up two more times before I got\nexpelled and so\nuh this is where the zero tolerance\npolicy when it comes to fighting I think\nactually\nhurts in a sense uh\nand for those of you that know what that\nis it's the two kids are in a fight it\ndoesn't matter who started it both kids\nget in trouble\nand so kids knew I can't fight back or I\nget expelled uh I remember there was I\nthink three or four weeks later after me\ncoming back we were watching Remember\nthe Titans for the umpteenth time and\nthis kid kept uh throwing this pen at\nthe back of my head because we were\nsitting on the floor just trying to be\nannoying to me and so I just set the pin\nlike I grabbed it and set it in front of\nme and then he started pushing me and\nthen he started punching me in the back\nof the head\nin the middle of the class while we're\nwatching this and then we both get in\ntrouble because the coach was like you\nshould have got up and moved and so\nsince both of you can't come up with a\nsolution to have solved this problem I'm\nwriting both of you up and so at that\npoint I had one more strike left and\nthat was for me getting punched in the\nback of the head in class and how did\nyou what were you\nhow did you appeal after that man\nso that's when I started to think well\nI'm I've got to do something now uh and\nthen this is when the bullying really\nstarted to pick up even more because\neverybody was just like he's got one\nmore and\nit kind of makes it really like pushing\nyou to the edge yeah it became almost\nsomewhat of a sport to an extent uh I\nremember like because of all this like\npeople were saying like you're gonna\ngrow up to be a rapist a murderer or a\nstalker or gay I don't know why all four\nof those are considered the same level\nbut Southern Georgia at the time\nuh and so it was really building up to\nthis point and then that's when I kind\nof snapped and that's when I started\nbeing like okay well if that's what I'm\ngonna be when I grew up\nthey're already right about that last\none why wait on those first three\nso that's when I started planning to\nhurt people and and so what I'm kind of\nhearing is that you are already being\njudged for being guilty of particular\nthings that you had not done\nlike people are thinking that you're a\nrapist a stalker yeah um and and it\nsounds like you mentioned earlier that\nyou were in the closet at the time so it\nsounds like you\nmaybe were you aware of your sexuality\nat that point\nI was at that point okay and so and did\nother people know too or was it just a\ngeneral insult it was just a general\nanswer okay\num\nso Broken Clock can be right twice a day\nhuh yeah you know if you say enough bad\nthings about some somebody you know\neventually one of them's somewhat true\nyou know and uh and so I'm a little bit\ncurious like when you got written up by\nthis teacher because the two of you had\nfailed to come up with a amenable\nsolution like what was your reaction to\nthat\nwell like I was mad like the like even\nmore mad because I was just like why am\nI getting written up for this it's\nclearly no one's looking out for me and\nit's I've got to look out for myself and\nso like at that point like even the like\nadministrator uh who we got sent to his\noffice he was just like well that kid\nlooked like he had remorse and you look\nlike you had no remorse for this\nsituation and so like I was being\nlectured\nso I see so so you didn't do anything\nwrong\nyeah you didn't demonstrate any remorse\nbecause you didn't do anything wrong no\nhe didn't say that he was just like you\ndidn't do any remorse and so that looks\neven worse on you because right he\nobviously was sad about the situation\nand you're both written up for it so you\nmust have done something bad too\nand so you're not willing to own up to\nwhat you did on that and he is and\nyou've got one more strike mister and so\nI don't know what you think you're doing\ncausing all these problems\nand so\nmany failures at different levels of\nauthority throughout my life kind of did\nyou I mean did you try to explain\nuh anytime I tried to he was just like\nyou're just making excuses\nso it this was a very gradual thing over\nyears that that's built up\nwow\nand and so I can imagine you felt quite\nresentful or oh very much so and what\nwhat kind like what was that like for\nyou or what were you kind of thinking\nuh I so I can't pinpoint an exact time\nthat this happened but during kind of\nthis period is when I started to have\nlike in a disassociated state uh\nand so I think like the easiest way to\ndescribe it for people who don't know\nwhat that is is like if you've ever seen\nYu-Gi-Oh like the Original Series where\nthere's like Yugi and then there's like\nthe Pharaoh that's like a different\nperson inside him that is having a\nconversation it was very similar to bat\nand I kind of felt like two parts of me\nstarting to split apart into like this\nvery hyper intellectual in this very\nemotional person\nand like them kind of fighting for\ncontrol Within myself\nand and what what was each one striving\nfor\nuh\nit varied day to day and so it was kind\nof like they were trying to convince\neach other who was right in this\nsituation and what should be done about\nit and so like once this kind of\nhappened it sometime around then is when\nlike they it became very clear it was\nlike separate like it was kind of like\nthey were being pulled apart\nand then all of a sudden it became like\nvery separated between this very hyper\nintellectual like just get through this\nlike you know you only got five years\nleft now you can move out and then never\nhave to deal with any of this again\nthat's just five years left yeah only\nhalf of your life that you've existed up\nuntil this point left yeah and then\nthere's the anger like let's do\nsomething and so like there was this\nvery clear like split between the two uh\nat very like kind of around that point\nuh ends\nat that point the kind of angry guy was\nwinning and so like The Logical guy was\nlike okay let's start\nplanning our revenge uh and then that's\nwhen and so vengeance is what you were\nlooking for\nyeah so like at that point like because\nof all the bullying and what had been\nsaid uh about me and this is again Cliff\nNotes version these are just some of the\nhighlights of many things that happened\nuh\nat that point I was just like okay like\nlet's start taking notice of things so\nwe can hurt the people who have been\nhurting us the administrators aren't\ndoing anything to protect us they're not\ngoing to do anything to protect them\nthis very English\nand they're not going to do anything to\nprotect them what does that mean\nthat was just like the mindset I had at\nthe time it's like well they're not\ndoing anything to help me so if I do\nsomething to them\nyou know so so they're like it sounded\nlike you were constructing a list\nyes there there is very much a list made\nuh and\nI'm not going to get into details as to\nuh I think for obvious reasons but I\nstarted planning uh and I actually got\nthrough uh a dry run uh and so\nagain not going to go in any details but\nuh\nI made sure my plan was going to work uh\nand kind of tested it to a certain\nextent so can I ask you JC so like were\nthere particular people that like what\nwould someone have to do to make it on\nthe list\nuh\nthey were like the list kind of came\nimmediately and it never changed got it\nand so it was like these are the people\nthat are kind of like the ones that do\nit the most and the ones that lead\neveryone else to do\nand and were you\nand and so I'm not getting the sense\nthat you were like\nindiscriminately gonna hurt people it\nsounds like you were really looking for\nsomething like justice or vengeance\nuh there was planned for collateral\ndamage uh to put it lightly uh but those\nwere the people I was going to make sure\nface justice so it was like justice in\nyour mind yeah it was very much like\nall right this is it like\nif this is all I'm gonna be why wait you\nknow they were right about the gay thing\nso they're probably right about these\nother three\nyeah\nand and what were the kinds of um so\nwhen when you use the when when I hear\nthe word justice I kind of think about\nlike justice for crimes and in your mind\nwhat was\nwhat were the crimes that these people\nhad committed\nuh like bullying lying about me just\ngenerally making my life hell okay\nso then then what happened\nuh so I had gotten through my dry run uh\nand then I was waiting for the next time\nfor this to take place uh to actually\nfollow through with the plan and a girl\nfrom a fellowship of Christian athletes\ndecided to befriend me uh\nand then over the next month I watched\nher get bullied into Oblivion out of\ntalking to me and like being friends but\nshe stood up for like a good month and\nmade an effort and then that's\nwhen kind of my logical side of that\ndisassociated state carded to take\ncontrol again and be like okay like\nno The World Isn't entirely evil and\nlike it started to push back against\nthat and\nso like that's kind of that month is\npretty much like the very singular thing\nthat stopped me from following through\nso so that that's so interesting I mean\nso you said that this person decided to\nbefriend you how do you understand\nwhat they how does that how do you\nunderstand that\nuh she literally walked up and it was\nlike I'm gonna be your friend now\nso like she kind of was tired of it uh\nobviously with her Christian tired of\nseeing me being bullied and everything\nthat was going on she was also a\ncheerleader like so she had some stuff\nto lose for befriending the weird guy\nwow\nand so that really it shook my world\nview but why did she do that what do you\nuh because of her worldview uh because\nwhich was what you know uh Christianity\nso like helping out the least of these\nuh you know that type of mentality\nand so she didn't have the best way she\ndidn't have the uh\nyou know PhD that she needed to help me\ndeal with all my problems but she\nprovided community and enough of a\nchallenge to the way I was viewing the\nworld at the time to\nmake me pause and think about what I was\nabout to do\nhow did you respond when she walked up\nto you and said we're gonna be friends\nnow\nI didn't believe it until probably like\na week later and then watching her go\nthrough some of the same stuff that I\nhad went through and\nor that I was you know being put through\non behalf of me\nand so very christ-like she's like yes\nand and so so what was it like like what\ndid people do to her\nuh started rumors that she was doing\nfavors uh for me to put at PG uh oh the\nIrish yeah oh yeah just you know there\nanything that you can think of middle\nschool insult-wise like you know like\nwow this was in Middle so she was like\n13. yeah so that we were all 12 13 at\nlast time not easy to do when you're 13.\nno\nso people especially when you're yeah\nespecially when you're a popular\ncheerleader sure so like that\nyou know as Hallmark movie is that is\nyou know like that really did kind of\nagain just shook my world view uh and\nthat's also is about the time that I\ndon't know if you know who Lecrae is uh\nhe's a\nfamous Christian rapper but he put now\nan album called Rebel\nand uh it's very much like all Christian\nphilosophy of like here's the way the\nworld is and why and he does it in like\nhip-hop and\nlike he he's tackling like all these\nquestions that I had like why is the\nworld like this and stuff like that and\nso that's when\nlike\nagain just it all kind of came down to\nlike my world view is very skewed at the\nfront and so that's what allowed me to\nthink I should be able to do these\nthings and so it was that underneath\nstarting to shift of my world view that\nokay people are bullying me but does\nthat make it what they're saying true\nyes or no but before we go down that\nroad can I ask you a couple more\nquestions about this yeah this uh person\nso when when they started getting\nbullied\nor when they started so it sounds like\npeople started rumors were there other\nthings that happened\nuh people stopped hanging out with her\nyou know after lunch like we all had to\nlike go through the line sit down at\nlunch and the line and then we'd go\noutside to like the little patio area\nafter we finished eating to make room\nfor the rest of the students to have\nlunch and like people would stop sitting\nwith her outside and\nyou know social isolation how did that\nmake you feel or how did you understand\nthat what did you think was happening\nthere\nlike At first I was just like why is she\nputting up with us like what's going on\nand then I kind of realized like two\nweeks into it oh this is happening\nbecause she's being nice to me\nokay\nand so it took me a minute to kind of\nrealize like okay this is what's\nhappening and then that's what really\nagain\nShifting the world view is like the main\nthing that I think helped\nor starting to question that is really\nwhat helped so but how did you\nunderstand\nyou know if she's suffering because of\nbefriending you like what how did you\nunderstand that like okay so two weeks\nin you're starting to figure it out I'm\nresponsible for this or she's doing like\nthis is happening to her because she's\nbefriending me like what did that what\ndid you think about that\nso part of it I was just like she's an\nidiot for doing this but then two it's\njust like it's nice that somebody cares\nand is actually like not just saying it\nand so like it finally like gave me some\nsort of like external validation that I\nwas worth something okay so it sounds\nlike you started to feel like you were\nworth something yeah yeah so you and and\nyou mentioned that the shift in the\nworld view so like can you kind of\ndescribe for me before this happened\nwhat was your world view\nso at this point I was very uh\ntrying to think I think it's\nmaterialistic isn't necessarily the\nright naturalistic I think is the like\nbest way to describe it where like help\nme understand there is no\nthere is no Supernatural there is only\nthe physical think uh\nRichard\ndawkins-esque okay if that makes sense\nwhere it's just like uh we're all just\ndancing to our DNA okay if you've read\nuh\nof course I quote the book I can't\nremember the name of the book but it's\none of his more famous ones\num and and so so like like life is just\nit's biologically like reductionist\nyeah and what what else did you kind of\nbelieve about the world like what did\nyou believe about like people and\nuh I just believe that all people were\njerks looking out for themselves and so\nso humans are fundamentally selfish yeah\nuh how did you understand what was\nhappening to you\nuh\nagain just like everybody's dancing to\ntheir DNA type mentality uh and\nso it wasn't necessarily them choosing\nus just like this is all just a natural\nprocess and so\nwhich is kind of ironic thinking like\nRevenge doesn't even fit into\nthat world view true and so that also\nkind of gave me pause for thought like I\nwas just like\nwhy would I want revenge if like this is\nall just biology sure so so it sounds\nlike I started moving around questioning\nthat world view and and one of the\nthings you kind of realized is like okay\nlike if this is just genes and DNA then\nhow can I blame them\nyeah and what else changed for you in\nterms of your world if you said it was\nrocked what what were some of the\nfoundations that were kind of affected\nuh so the main one was just that\nrelational aspect it was just like okay\nif everybody's selfish\nwhat was her motivation to doing this\nand then like seeing that actually\nplayed out you know the Christian faith\nto a certain extent just actually lived\nout in somebody\nand so just\nexperiencing that was like okay it even\nif it's in their DNA like there's still\nnothing that makes sense about that and\nwhy they would do that uh and so this is\nwhen I just started to kind of question\neverything uh\nfast forward a few years I had a teacher\nnamed Mr Jordan teaching AP government\nand it didn't matter what kid yes uh it\ndid not matter what uh your political\nphilosophy was he would challenge you on\nit and so uh it was funny anytime\nsomeone would just be like\nspout some liberal view he'd be like\nhe'd spout the conservative anti-point\nto it and then a conservative kid would\nbe like yeah that's right and then he'd\nspout the part of the liberal view that\nthe other kid didn't understand back to\nthe conservative kid and so his kind of\nwhole philosophy is if what you believe\ncan't withstand a question it's not\ngoing to withstand life hmm\nand so that's when I really started to\nbe again this is where again gifted kid\niqing my way out of things I was just\nlike now I'm just gonna Master\nphilosophy and understand the world at\nthe deepest level uh\nand so that's when I just started\nreading you know about Islam Hinduism uh\nyou know all the different sects of you\nknow like Protestants and protestantism\nyou know Reformation the Catholic\ntradition and what history are you\nlooking for JC\nuh I was trying to construct a world\nview that was consistent with reality\nand also consistent with itself there's\na lot of different World Views that I\nsaw that were just like\nhumanism really didn't make sense to me\nuh just because it's very much we come\nup with our own meaning and it's just\nlike well\nlike\nif we're coming up with it like that's\nvery similar to\nlike the naturalism world view I had\nbefore just pretending to be religious\nokay and so just through all these\nstudies and years of it I kind of\neventually settled on Christianity uh as\nlike the overall world view okay that\nmade the most sense and and so it's what\nwere the what were the features of the\nworld that you saw at that point that\nyou were looking for like so you were\nlooking for a philosophy to explain a\nparticular set of observations about the\nworld right it has to be consistent with\nthe world so what were the observations\nabout the world that you had made\noh why are humans jerks sometimes was\nkind of the main one\nand then like how can people also be\ngood but or like do good things but also\nlike what makes people different and\nuh like how can I explain like why some\npeople are in good situations and some\npeople are in bad situations uh one of\nthe most challenging questions I got uh\nwas okay well that may be true in\nAmerica but uh\nwhat if you're in South Africa and\nthey're a hotel with uh people outside\nwanting to kill you because of your race\nit's like how does your worldview\naccount for that one and it's like\nit doesn't so I need to think deeper\nabout it and so it's uh you've done a\nlot of work\nyeah so the way he put it is like you\nguess again Mr Jordan is like you guys\nhave an American world view or you guys\nhave an American view you don't have a\nworld view and so again wisdom from the\nAP class\nsounds like he had quite an impact on\nyou uh yeah um just mainly just telling\nus to question everything and not be\nafraid of being wrong because it's about\nmaking progress not perfection\nand so it sounds like you\nI'm still I appreciate you kind of\nsharing with us uh what started to turn\nthings around as well as\nI think what was kind of an accelerant\nfor your growth\num but I'm a little bit curious so like\nyou know back when we left you in middle\nschool and now you're an AP Government\nyeah you still had one strike right so\nlike what happened with the kids did\nthey stop picking on you like how did\nyou avoid getting expelled like what\nhappened to the bullying\nso Napoleon continued but like at that\npoint I was just like I just got to make\nit to Summer and then I'll figure\nsomething out okay\nand then my freshman year of high school\nuh\nthey started a like\nprobation program or if you didn't get\nin trouble for the first like six like\nfirst semester then we would wipe your\nrecord clean because we don't want that\naffecting you going to college or trade\nschool or whatever and so\nand that part never got public and so I\nwas just like I just got to make it\nthrough these six months and then also\nit was combining middle schools sure uh\ninto the high school and so there was\nmore kids who didn't necessarily know\nabout\nwhat had happened the year before and\nthen I had also obviously parents had\nstarted to get counseling for me uh that\nwasn't done so how did that happen\nuh so they already had a counselor in\nplace because of my older brother being\nbipolar so they just kind of started\ndragging me into those sessions uh and\nso\nand and do you feel comfortable sharing\na little bit about what those sessions\nwere like or\nuh it was very much like what can you do\nyourself like there is very much a it's\nall my dad's fault because he's a\nX Y or Z that's what you were thinking\nyeah and so it's just like my life is\nfalling apart and everything is because\npeople in Authority aren't doing their\njobs uh okay\nand then\nit was very much like okay like let's\nsay all of that is true what can you do\nto make it and so it was disregard\nwhat's happening to you to a certain\nextent and it's like how do you handle\nthese situations the best you can\nyes they may not be the best situation\nbut you can still handle them in a best\nway\ninteresting and so it sounds like you\nyou really took that to heart yes\neventually and now how long did that\ntake\nuh probably a good year and a half okay\nto start applying it in any manner uh\nand and you started seeing the counselor\nwhen you were 13 like after the initial\nsuspension\nuh no we we were already seeing them\nbecause of again my brother and I was\nalready experienced depression uh up\nuntil that point as well and had you\never talked to your counselor about what\nwas going on at school\nyeah uh so they're not\nthe the plan if that makes sense sure\nbut definitely about the bullying and\nstuff like that and so and what did the\ncounselors like how did they respond to\nthat\nuh they're just like you know what\nthey're saying isn't true so why accept\nit as true it's like you can choose if\nthese things are not all this kind of\nwent any or out the other got at that\nage because I was just like another\nauthority figure who is lying to me at\nleast in my mind at that point well can\nI just pause and reflect for a second JC\nso the first thing so first of all I\nwant to just really thank you from the\nbottom why heart for having this\nconversation\num I think that\nand we'll we'll if we get some uh some\ntime down the road there's a video I\nwant to share with you and I'd love to\nhear your thoughts about it it went\nviral recently about someone who was I\nguess stalking a girl and and goes to\nreport something to the police and then\nuploads the video himself\nbut I just like a couple of interesting\nobservations the first is\nwhen you talk about\ngetting better\nyou don't actually mention the counselor\nwhich is so interesting because I think\nnowadays myself included as a mental\nhealth\nprovider right as a psychiatrist and\nDoctor we frequently will recommend and\nI still would recommend it and we'll\ntalk about that maybe a little bit\ntowards the end but we recommend mental\nhealth treatment but what I what I'm\nreally hearing from your story if we\nlisten to you the really transformative\nFactor was a peer not a counselor\nand a teacher who like taught you a\nphilosophy to question whereas like\nright now I get the sense that and we've\neven seen this frustration in our\ncommunity where like everyone's like\njust go see a therapist and there are\nsome people out there who have seen\ntherapists and what's it's kind of\ninteresting because you kind of say it\ntook you about a year and a half to\nreally start with this sinking in and\nfor a while it was in one year out the\nother you even saw your therapist as\npart of the authority framework that\ndoesn't really know what's going on\nwhich is really interesting and and that\nthat's just something that all right you\nsaid obviously I was seeing a counselor\nit wasn't obvious to me at all in fact\nI'm surprised to hear that because\nusually what we assume is that if\nthere's a counselor in the picture like\nyou're going to be fine yeah\nso this is where I think we America and\nthe Western General is hyper\nindividualistic and then more Eastern\ncountries tend to be very Community\nfocused and it takes both uh like you\nneed both a community\nand you know a solid framework to live\nlife from like you can't just exist uh\nlike CBT is great but you still need\nCommunity because you're a human being\nyou know you're not designed to be on an\nisland by yourself that's why solitary\nconfinement so\nand so when you say it takes both takes\nboth to what what's what's the outcome\nyeah to be a healthy human like you\ncan't be a healthy human because humans\nare more or less by definition\nrelational beings and so you need both\nCommunity as well as\ncounseling and so a lot of people go\nvery hard into one or very hard on the\nother and you need both to\nyou know you need mentors as well as\ncommunity\nit sounds like you have done a lot of\nreading and done a lot of thinking\nuh yeah this again this is 15 years ago\nso I've had 15 years to make progress\nfrom this point uh so wow that's that's\nawesome man\num so\nokay so it sounds like the The Bullying\nsort of faded away some you learned how\nto kind of handle it a little bit better\nand\num\nand then you've spent 15 years sort of\nlike\nlearning exploring like is there\nanything else that you kind of want to\nshare about what your world view is now\nunderstand the world\nso it's very much I still believe in\nquestioning things uh the one thing that\nI've realized is like everybody has a\npresupposition of some kind like\noriginally mine was very naturalistic\nit's like the world is only\nthe physical atoms in the universe and\nit's like that in and of itself is an\nassumption that cannot be proven and or\ndisproven uh and so I think the most\nchallenging thing that I've been working\nthrough probably the past like four to\nfive years is having a world view that\nallows for\nother people to have World Views that\naren't the same as yours\nand so being able to understand it from\nother people's perspective\nso JC let me ask you like um can I ask\nyou like some more almost like general\nquestions or questions that are more\nabout\nexternalizing your experience the first\nthing is what do you think are the\nfeatures that lead to someone becoming\nlike you know incredibly violent and\nhurting lots of people\nuh so I would definitely say lack of\nmentorship like have not having a mentor\nand then also not having a community\nokay there's actually a great uh\nnon-profit near where I live called a\ndeliver hope and so they work with youth\nthat are put in the juvenile detention\ncenters and stuff like that since they\nstarted and essentially what they do is\nthey pair up people with a mentor and\nthat Mentor meets with them once a week\nand checks in on them like No Agenda\njust goes and hangs out with them and\nmakes sure they're doing okay be that\nbigger brother figure and since they\nstarted the reincarceration rate for\njuveniles dropped 98 percent\nwow\nthat's why so\nso I think that's a very big factor uh\nthere was a I'm trying to think of his\nname uh I believe it was votie bockham\nhe is a pastor in Zambia\nuh\nhe was talking about how in the\nAfrican-American Community as like the\ndrug war happened and father started to\nbe taken out of the homes that's when\nviolence started to rise in those\ncommunities and then now we're seeing a\nvery similar split like fatherlessness\nin the white communities and now they're\nexperienced the same\nincrease in violence in\nwhere their kids hang out which is\nschools interesting so I don't know\nexactly if that's correct or not but I\nthought that was a very interesting\nobservation that goes along with\nas mentorship gets taken away healthy\nmentorship takes gets taken away then\nthat's when a lot of these like\nworldview questions\ndon't have anybody to go to to answer\nthem uh and so that's where having that\nCommunity especially ones with mentors\nis so important I\nthank you so much so it sounds like\nyou're you're kind of saying a lack of\nmentorship is incredibly key a lack of\ncommunity is very very important and\nyeah if that is heavily responsible or a\nbig influence in terms of whether people\nbecome violent or not\num what would you say\nso like\nwhat what are like the features of the\nmindset that lead to mass violence\nuh so like what does it look like if I\ncould like x-ray someone's mind like\nwhat do you think I would find\nuh definitely a disassociation okay\nso what do you mean by that so like uh I\nthink as a clinical term like the\ndisassociated state where like they're\ndetached from themselves Okay and like\nnumbness and it's\nuh like a lot of cognitive dissonance as\nwell\nso not being able to\naccept facts to a certain degree okay\nand so\nyeah I think that's kind of the two big\nones is that it's developing again I\nthink it all comes back to world view\nand then lack of community I think those\nare the big things that and and what\nkind of world view would you say people\nwho\nuh you know do become violent like what\nkind of world view do you think they\nhave\nuh I forget who coined the term uh but\nthey called it an anti-world View and so\ninstead of you having a world view where\nyou believe in said principles it's you\nare anti this\nlike it Nazi Germany is a perfect\nexample it's not that they're built on\nfor something it's they are built\nanti-semitic they're anti\nanyone that's not\nand so instead of it being about\nprinciples that are healthy it's about\nthose people are bad\nand that's the driving force and in your\nmind who who are the bad people and what\nmade them bad\nuh obviously all my bullies and then\nauthority figures for not doing their\njobs and what was it to protect to\nprotect kids and be that Mentor okay and\nand was there something that it was just\nthat they bullied you or was there some\nother feature that you saw as like\nunifying your bullies and and kind of\nlike separating you from them is there\nanything like that\nyeah the bullying served as a way to\nlike even reinforce that US versus them\nmentality and me uh and so because they\nwere so against me personally for\nwhatever reason that was very easy to\njustify uh the US versus the mentality\nand then generalize that across the\npopulation so yeah I mean I think that\nmakes a lot of sense because they're\nessentially creating the US versus them\nDynamic which then you're just picking\nup and playing the game that they're\nkind of laying out yeah you're just I\nthink yeah I think the big thing is just\nover generalizing that it's like were\nthose people bullies and were they\nagainst me yes but does that mean every\nhuman on earth is no uh and I think\nthat's the other key factor with this\nquote unquote anti-world view is\nuh I think we've all heard uh who is it\nDaryl\nDaryl Davis uh the guy that uh the blues\nmusician who like went and hang out with\nKKK members and then yeah so like their\nwhole world view was built on like or\nlike the kkk's worldview is based on\nlike this one black person I met didn't\nlike me and so therefore all black\npeople are this way and Daryl comes\nalong is just like no we're not and so\nit's racism is again that over\ngeneralization of that one bad\nexperience with one person and then\nextrapolating falsely\nsome reason and\nyou know usually it's race uh or\npolitical belief or whatever it's sure\nso that Republican or Democrat was mean\nto me so therefore all Republicans Or\ndemocrats are mean and so you mentioned\nearlier about being unable to accept\nfacts what I'm also wondering is in my\nexperience working with people who are\nkind of like\non this path in some way for lack of a\nbetter term\num not only is there an inability to\naccept facts but there's also a belief\nthat certain things are factual\nwhat do you think about that\nuh I think that goes back to that over\ngeneralization okay so they're going to\nfind something that is true and then\nover generalize that to the population\ngot it so so they they sort of start\nwith like a Cornerstone of of something\nthat may be factual and then really\nextrapolate that and assume that the\nwhole Foundation that they build is\nfactual yeah they'll take something\nthat's situationally true and make it\nuniversally true I love that\num and so what do you what do you think\nneeds to happen for people who are kind\nof on this path of of potentially\nheading towards violence like what\nwhat do you think\nneeds to happen\nI said I think mentorship is the best\nway uh there's a movie called absent uh\nI'm trying to remember who was the\ndirector but I found out about it\nbecause uh James Hetfield was a part of\nthat and it's all about how absent\nfathers uh and like them finding father\nfigures and like what they went through\nand well they didn't necessarily choose\nviolence a lot of them chose drugs or\nsomething else just not having that\ninvolved Father Figure in some way shape\nor form I think that's one of the key\nthings and while\na biological father may not be a\npossibility in all situations having a\nmentor figure fill that role I think is\njust extremely important sure so I I'll\nacknowledge that for sure\nand I'm going to push back against that\na little bit is that okay yeah\nchallenging my worldview I like that I\nmean I I don't I agree with you 100 I\nthink there's just a shortcoming that I\nsee there which I'd love to get your\nthoughts on which is so earlier we were\ntalking a little bit about you know the\nthe message that you got from your\ncounselor which is like yes this thing\nis bad and yes it is true and\nthat's not necessarily in your control\nand what concerns me about a lot of your\nSolutions and I think they're good ones\nfor the record is that like if I'm the\nperson who's struggling I can't or maybe\nthis is where I'm wrong but\nI I view like lack of mentorship you're\nkind of talking about it as a societal\nproblem an absence of fathers but like\nwhat like if I'm 13 years old and I'm\nthinking about hurting my classmates\nlike what do I do\nokay so I always miss I was\nmisunderstanding your question I thought\nyou were asking more like what could we\nas a society do versus no I I I I was it\nwas a open question so I think you\nanswered it fine so now let's tunnel\ndown a little bit further\nso if I was that person again\nI would again just start looking for\nways you're generalizing and things that\naren't true so yes this person may be\nbullying you or you know whatever is\ncausing whoever it is that's the enemy\nin your mind\nmake sure you're not over generalizing\nfor one\nand then you're going to have to take\nsteps backwards to why are you angry and\nif that anger is Justified\nwhat is the healthy way to deal with\nthat anger\nand\n99.99 of the time it's not to hurt\nsomebody else like that's one thing to\nbe angry to like protect somebody like\nif somebody's over here punching my\nfriend like there's going to be some\nanger and I'm going to go and defend my\nfriend but that's more out of love for\nmy friend as opposed to that if you're\nlooking at those situations\nit's you've got to realize\nit's not your place to do it\nand that there is also like things that\nare better moving forward\nyeah so I'll I love that answer and I'm\ngonna continue to push yeah because like\nwhen you're saying you know start to\nrealize you're over generalizing but\nlike I think part of the problem is that\nyou know in your mind it's not an over\ngeneralization so what how do you think\nwe kind of deal with that right because\nthese people believe\nthat this is it's not a generalization\nthis is a truth mm-hmm\nyeah this this would be honestly I don't\nhave a great answer for it outside of\njust seek mentorship uh so there is\nagain that there's only so much you can\ndo by yourself with the limited amount\nof knowledge you have and that\nmentorship could just be listening to a\npodcast that challenges your worldview\nlike it may not be an individual person\nat first but uh I think just kind of as\na society we've kind of gotten to a\npoint where we don't\nreally let our World Views be challenged\nand so like violence or is like a\ngeneralized or anger is a generalized\nresponse to that uh and so\nmaybe not start with something that\nchallenges like the fundamental\nexistence of your worldview but\njust ever so slightly disagrees with it\nso so\nwhat I'm going to kind of take away from\nthat and that's fine like I mean you\ndon't have the answer I don't have the\nanswer I don't think anyone has the\nanswer if someone had a very clear\nanswer I don't think we would be in this\nsituation yeah so I think that's fair\ngame but what I'm sort of what I'm\nalmost taking away from that or this is\nhow I interpret it and apply my own\nat this time filtering what you're\nsaying is that at the end of the day I\nthink it's actually a really important\npoint that\nthis may not be solved entirely on your\nown yeah which is really interesting\nbecause I think that oftentimes when it\ncomes to people who are considering\nviolence in this situation the weight of\nthe responsibility is placed on that\nperson right we blame that person for\nthinking these things we blame that\nperson for having these kinds of like\nthoughts and intentions and stuff like\nthat and is there some amount to blame\nthere do we want to restrict their\nbehaviors and potentially even punish\nthem like absolutely but one thing that\nI'm hearing from you is that I think\nyour story kind of illustrates it I\ndon't know that you could have brute\nforced your way out of that hole and in\nfact what your story kind of illustrates\nis that it takes a guardian angel to\npull someone out of there right and and\nlike that's like that terrifies me\nbecause I think you could be right\nand what that sort of means is that the\nresponsibility actually doesn't\nnecessarily fall on the person\nit falls on us\nI think to a certain degree like it's\nnot a hundred percent either way I think\nthere's a sliding scale between\nindividual responsibility and corporate\nresponsibility\nand so as we take like let's say to get\nto a certain point our responsibility as\na society has to be at like 50 percent\nso like if overall we're if we drop\nbelow 50 between the individual\nresponsibility and corporate\nresponsibility we're going to have a bad\ntime in some way got it and so I'm just\nusing that as a\ngeneralized number no sure uh hard fact\nbut I think there's only so much an\nindividual can do to get there and then\nif the corporate responsibility like\nkeeps shrinking that's going to go away\nor if the individual's responsibility\nstarts shrinking in their capacity then\nit gets closer to that point\nso yeah so I'm really hearing its shared\nresponsibility and furthermore that\nthere's also only so much that Society\ncan do and at some point the individual\nhas to start taking responsibility for\ntheir feelings their thoughts their\nreactions their behaviors\num trying to improve their life\nwhat would you like so let's say that\nsomeone's watching this which is exactly\nwhy we're doing it and is having\nthoughts of violence what would you\nrecommend for someone like that\nuh reach out to a healthy gamer\nCommunity I mean that's you know number\none uh you know it's Community like\nthat's okay you get something get some\npeople involved in your life yes like uh\nyou know that this may not be the best\nplace to be able to help with these\nspecific issues but I'm sure uh Dr K in\nthis community knows who to send you to\nokay I don't know that we do but all\nright so so but what I I think the\nmessage that I'm hearing is\nso don't isolate yourself yeah so so but\nit really is reach out to help but like\nwhat what do you think how do you think\nsomeone should reach out to help\nbut for help\nso this is where\nit's difficult depending on where you're\nat because there are places with great\nmental health situations And Then There\nAre Places without it uh and\nuh there's obviously like the National\nSuicide Hotline uh I think that would be\na good place as well because even if\nit's not necessarily suicide you're\nstruggling with it's still that desire\nfor violence and it's just towards\nothers instead of yourself\nthere's a lot of parallels there and\nthey would have\nthey would probably have the better\nresources than healthy gamer would to\ndeal with these situations yeah I mean\nso so I'm I'm really proud of our\ncommunity and I I just don't know\num\nso just like that yeah just like that\ngirl uh in middle school she wasn't\nfully equipped with a PhD to deal with\nme uh yeah but there was enough\nCommunity there to help me then start to\napply what the counselor was saying\nyeah so I I and I I face formed a little\nbit as a meme but but I I do think that\nwe've uh opened our doors in a good way\nto a lot of people who have participated\nin toxic corners of the internet and I'm\nactually like really happy like it was\nRocky for a while but now I think that\nthere's actually like more and more\nproductive discussion for example around\ngender Dynamics and stuff like I see a\nlot more compassion a lot more desire to\nunderstand\num a lot more like\nyou know like\nuh so I recently saw a post that was\nreally interesting about a woman who\nposted about her experience on dating\napps and and how she basically like\nalways has matches\nand how she even acknowledges that like\nI never realized that like men had it so\nhard and my experience is completely\ndifferent it's like it's a never-ending\nsource of matches for me\nand she also went on to kind of share\nthat what I started to realize is like I\nparticipated in the app not out of a\ndesire and I may be like you know\noversimplifying here but I certainly am\nbut that it was really like ego\ngratification for her\num and and to to feel like really really\nvalidated and and feel great about\nherself which I think is kind of\ninteresting because\nI think a lot of the the kind of\nin-sellish mindset believes that sort of\nthing but to hear another person sort of\nsay hey this isn't good or healthy or I\nactually don't want this\num and it can be somewhat true I thought\nwas just really eye-opening\num\nso it sounds like you're kind of saying\nlike reach out for some kind of help\nyeah uh like I said it's there is a sort\nlike I said it's a sliding scale and you\nknow like I said at the beginning like\nWestern ideology tends to be hyper\nindividualistic it ignores that\nCommunity plays a role in people's\nwell-being at all and it's all pull\nyourself up by your bootstraps and then\nEastern communities tend to be the\nopposite and it's all about you were\nborn into this family and so that is\nyour community now and forever and it\ndoesn't matter who you are you are not\nan individual you are part of this unit\nand I think the truth is somewhere in\nbetween that as well as responsibility\nfor what's going on in the world yes\nthere's some ultimate individual\nresponsibility but there's also\na level of corporate responsibility that\nwe share sure as fellow human beings\nabsolutely man\nso uh\num JC let me ask you kind of like uh\nthis is going to be sort of like a maybe\nan inflammatory question and let me know\nif you don't want to answer it\num is there any part of you that regrets\nnot becoming violent like what do you\nthink about the path that you chose to\ntake and and do you think that\nyou know do you regret it at all I know\nit's kind of a weird question\nI don't regret\nnot being violent but I also don't\nregret going through that thought\nprocess to a certain extent to then be\nable to understand people uh so I don't\nnecessarily regret going down that path\nbut I definitely would have regretted\nfinishing out that path if that makes\nsense makes a lot of sense so what I'm\nhearing is that it sort of really helped\nyou understand a lot about\nlife and like how to organize the way\nthat you interact with the world the way\nthat you understand yourself are you\nkind of so if you didn't regret going\ndown that path how happy are you that\nwith where you are now and like what do\nyou think about not choosing that path\nuh I think it's it's really helped me\nunderstand\nwhy people get angry at smaller things\nthat are much smaller at least in my\nmind so it's just like\nif I can get that angry about\nname I'm gonna minimize you know\nminimize my trauma now but uh like I can\nif I can get that mad about name calling\nuh you know of course now I understand\nhow somebody could get mad and be\nviolent about\ntheir candidate not winning or you know\nsomeone saying something against their\nreligious view it's like I can\nunderstand that I'm not going to agree\nwith it but now I can at least\nunderstand\nhow their thought process got them there\nand empathize with them as humans and\nthen maybe Point them be like hey I was\non that path too here's a better one\nso you do think the path that you took\nis better\nyes what makes it better\nuh\nso just it better for Humanity as a\nwhole again I think\njust like that's my individual\nresponsibility pouring into the\ncorporate responsibility for other\npeople\nwhat does that mean\nso just like there's individual\nresponsibility uh for me and my life\nthere's also\na part of my individual responsibility\nthat plays into like the societal\ncorporate responsibility that affects\neveryone else so to be a little bit more\nConcrete in what ways do you think the\npath that you chose is better than the\none that you didn't\noh one I didn't kill people uh I think\nthat's a net positive okay so you you\nsee that as a net positive yeah\nso uh and then two uh it's allowed me to\nthen help other people through things uh\njust because I've\nbecause I went through this at such a\nyoung age I had to question everything\nand get down and like understand all\nthese very deep questions very early on\nuh and so there's been times where I've\nhad friends uh\nlike who were like having marriage\nproblems and me who's never dated\nanybody in my entire life uh\nwould sit down with him and just like\nwell it sounds like you're holding this\npoint of world view and that's just not\ntrue because of X Y and Z and that's why\nyou're so being able to dive so deep\ninto all these like philosophical things\nis they were just like well here's your\noverarching thing that you're dealing\nwith that's affecting your marriage or\naffecting the relationship with your\nchild and so while I don't necessarily\nhave the idea of how to apply that in\nyour situation like\nhere's like at least like a general\ntheme you could maybe think about and\nrun with\nyeah so I'm hearing that this whole\njourney in addition to you know not\nhurting other people which is is a net\npositive for you and I think most people\nwould agree with that I certainly agree\nwith that\num I'm also hearing that you actually\ndeveloped a lot of compassion and\nunderstanding and that by sort of taking\nresponsibility in your own life\nyou've now been able to be a part of\nlike the positive Community for other\npeople yeah\nthat's great man I'm I'm really happy to\nhear that and\num yeah anything else that you want to\nadd or any questions that you've got for\nme otherwise I think we can move over to\nuh watching that clip and then maybe\nlike getting your thoughts on it\nuh I don't really think I have any\nquestions uh I just think like I said\nyou know we have that corporate\nresponsibility but there's also that\nindividual responsibility and so it's\nnever going to be a hundred percent\nclear as to whose fault it is uh\nbut\nas long as we can start acknowledging\nthat Nuance is there uh I think we can\nmake progress as a society to not put it\nall on them but then also not ignore\nlike well we pushed them to that point\nand it's their fault they did that uh\nbut at the same time I think there's\ncertain cases where nah that was a\nhundred percent on them or 98 online\nyeah so I I I freaking approach things\nwith that perspective I think it would\nbe helpful I really like the the frame\nthat you put about you know we may have\nso I think people are ultimately\nresponsible for their actions but we're\nin for\nyou know a lot of trouble if we don't\nacknowledge how we push people\nyeah right so so we like I kind of think\nabout society as like the risk factors\nfor something and certain things that\nhappen will amplify the risk\nand at the end of the day you can like\nyou know blame someone for smoking let's\nsay but what were the risk factors that\nthis person was dealing with did they\nhave parents who smoke what was the\nadvertising situation like were\ncigarettes easily available like there\nare all kinds of risk factors that go\ninto whether someone engages in a\nbehavior in a society I think we're\nresponsible for those risk factors But\nultimately the I believe that the\nultimate responsibilities with the\nindividual yeah I think the inverse of\nthat is true like the risk factors of\nyou going to college and getting a\ndegree or going into trade school like\nthose are also like we can take that\nsame idea and put it on the positive\nSpectrum as well oh absolutely so so\nthere are and there yeah so I think when\nwe when we use the phrase risk factor\nthat implies that this is a negative and\nwe're looking at negative outcomes but I\nwould completely agree that you know\nthere's lots of data for example that\num building something positive\nhelps people achieve an outcome like my\nfavorite recent study was one that\nlooked at pornography addiction and the\nfeeling of meaninglessness in life and\nthe more meaningless someone's life is\nthe more likely they are to be addicted\nto pornography and so the the converse\nof that is how do you reduce\nmeaninglessness it's helping people find\nmeaning which is like one of these\npositive risk factors where we sort of\nhelp people discover meaning and then\nwhat we tend to see is that their\naddictions improve\nso I completely agree with that anyway\nlet's hop was there anything else that\nyou wanted to share that we didn't talk\nabout or that you didn't that I didn't\nask about\nno I I think we covered pretty much all\nof it okay or actually there was one\nthing that I did want to\nmention so\nuh and this is just more so on the lines\nof uh like the types of attackers uh so\nI was what you would consider like a\nlone wolf uh is the terminology for it\nand I think that our discussion was very\nheavily focused on that type of person\nwho\nbecomes and thinks about it of\nthemselves there's still\nother factors like that uh those who are\nlike radicalized and so those who have\noutside people trying to push them\nactively push them not\nlike to do make them do that\nintentionally not just pushing them by\nbeing bullies and then there's also\npeople with\nuh\nI'm not sure the technical term for it\nbut like the I guess like the\nstereotypical schizophrenic person like\nserial killer from movies like those are\nseparate issues from\nmy situation and those need to be\ncontextualized differently\noh yeah I would completely agree with\nthat I think I recently saw a mental\nillness analysis of people who commit\nMass violence\nand um finding I don't remember what the\nexact uh details of the study were I\ndon't remember the numbers but\nessentially discovering a shockingly low\namount of mental illness in people who\ncommit Mass violence yeah and and so in\nin the data actually shows that while\npeople with for example schizophrenia\num may be more violent than the average\nperson and even then I'm not sure if\nthat's entirely true the percentage of\npeople who have a psychotic disorder who\nare violent is actually like very very\nvery small yeah and so usually when we\nsee like people who are mentally or who\nhave some kind of diagnosis who are\nviolent the most common cause is\nsomething like substance use so a lot of\npeople who are like high on like meth or\nwhatever and like they can become\nviolent like pretty easily but generally\nspeaking most people who are mentally\nill including bipolar disorder or\nschizophrenia are not violent yeah so\nI'm glad you kind of Drew that\ndistinction and it's also interesting\nbecause we've done some work\num and in sort of helping some\ninstitutions like the United Nations\nunderstand this process of\nradicalization and inciting people to\nviolence which is actually like a\ndifferent process from what you're kind\nof describing so I really appreciate you\nkind of drawing those distinctions\ncool dude okay so let's get ready to\ncheck this video yeah let me um let me\njust figure out how we're gonna do this\nso what I'm going to do we're going to\nwatch it on the reddits\nokay I don't know if I if I share us uh\nI don't know if you're going to be able\nto hear this\ncan you see this yeah okay so\num all right and then let's go to\nuh\nokay so let's let's go ahead and take a\nlook at this is what you're seeing right\nokay so let's go ahead and watch a song\nfor a woman that I kind of like and I\ngot there and she saw me and she\nimmediately pulled away and uh I I\nwasn't forcing her to listen or anything\nyou know I just wanted to play the song\nfor her you know give her her own choice\nif she wanted to be with me you know\ndoes she know you yeah I worked with her\nthere for like five six months\nrelationship\nno we were talking a little bit but it\nnever really got serious okay\nokay but anyways\nI pulled up there and I was in the other\nparking lot and I saw her get in a car\nand I was like oh shoot it's my moments\nI pulled up their next turn she pulled\naway from me and uh\nso I chased her a little bit just\nbecause I'm I don't know women are crazy\nlike I felt like she like wanted me\nJason so much crazy well it's just like\nI only went like a couple blocks down\nthe street I'm just saying don't you\nthink chasing somebody's crazy when\nthey're obviously don't owner oh I had\nmy song playing and I wanted to like her\nto hear it maybe\nright so what else happened\num well anyways\nher her father called me up and he made\nsome threats to me into my life and so I\njust want to have his name on file\nI think he said he's gonna stab me like\nbut he's like cussing him\nhe said he says I'm gonna do something\nto you I swear I do something to you for\nchasing your daughter yeah but it wasn't\nchasing it was like going down a couple\nstreets like that's like fun to women\nlike women like that a little bit of\nexcitement no they don't\nwhat about like BDS and porn where women\nlike to have rape fantasies\nwhat who knows what most women do like\nhaving rape fantasies okay do you say\nshe does I don't know\nbut fairness you don't\nwell so what do you want us to do well I\njust want you to get his name on file\njust in case he does do anything to me I\nknow his doctor's name\nwhat do you know his name I know her\nname I don't know his name he called me\nfrom a restricted phone number okay\nhere's my suggestion\nleave her alone\nwell this is one song I made and this\nwas the final chance of it's going to\nhappen\nokay let's just pause for a second so\nwhat do you what do you think about this\nso far\nso the main thing I'm noticing is like\nthe inability to read social cues uh and\nthen also like a lot of cognitive\ndissonance uh as to he believes so much\nthat\nshe's going to like him\nthat he's justifying all of her actions\nas\nways that she's showing that she likes\nhim even though that's not the case and\nso I think that's a clear example of\nlike the cognitive dissonance of oh well\nwomen like to be chased that's why she\nwas running away from me\nand so I think that's like a very clear\nokay so is that is that something that\nthat I I mean I'm going to kind of set\nyou up here through JC so please take\nthis with a grain of salt but like you\nknow like you having been in a very dark\nplace is that something that you can\nkind of like understand\noh yeah there is definitely a lot of\ncognitive dissonance between what was\nhappening uh in my life and the way I\nwas relating to people it was\neverything somebody did was\nan attempt to bully me even if they were\nnice or even if it was genuine like it\ntook a lot for me to uh like I said with\nthis girl to realize it took me a week\nfor me to be like okay she's not setting\nme up for some\ntrick here and so there is that\ncognitive dissonance in my mind it's on\nthe opposite spectrum of Everybody Hates\nMe and so anything somebody does towards\nme\nis some sort of setup he's kind of got\nthe inverse of that where it's\nshe likes me so therefore everything she\ndoes is a way to show her she likes me\ngot it even though that's not true so\nwhat I'm kind of hearing is\nonce you have a conclusion in your mind\nthat conclusion shapes the information\nas opposed to the information shaping\nthe conclusion yes okay\num and and just you know for one thing\nthat I'd encourage you to do as you're\nkind of thinking about this what I'm\nreally looking for JC is like your\nunderstanding based on your experience\nas opposed to\ninferring what this person believes does\nthat make sense yeah so I actually don't\nthink it's fair for us to assume\nparticular things about this person the\nreason that I'm uh watching this clip\nwith you is because I think that you've\ngot like a unique perspective on being\nable to relate to some of these things\nand I'd love it if you could sort of\nshare that part does that make sense\nyeah yeah should we keep going yeah\num actually before we do let me just ask\nyou so there are a couple things that I\nnoticed about this video I'm not even\ngonna comment about the person\num what do you notice about the cops\nthey're very defensive and their hands\nare already on their tasers they're\nexpecting something to potentially\nhappen and but also I know that can be a\nhabit for some that can be training as\nwell uh there's a lot of police\ndepartments now that uh because it's\njust kind of natural to put your hands\nsomewhere they're training them to put\nthem on their non-lethal or less lethal\noption so that way that's the first\nthing they'll react to versus their\nlethal option if something turns violent\nand and what do you think so that the\ncops are basically like advising someone\nand and now I'm gonna kind of ask you to\nlean a little bit in on your own\nexperience\num how receptive do you do you imagine\nsomeone in this situation is to what the\ncops are saying\nhe or it feels like he showed up with an\nagenda of like I'm right and so like he\ndoesn't or I wouldn't care what the cops\nwere saying to me it's I have come to\npresent my case and XYZ needs to happen\nand so therefore you need to do XYZ why\nare you not doing XYZ and so I'm\nwondering if this kind of relates to\nwhat you were saying even when you were\nworking with a counselor about in one\near and out the other mm-hmm\nso just yeah just to share a little bit\nabout my experience with this sort of\nstuff so what I'm sort of noticing is\nthat\num\nI I don't think they're taking this\nperson's concerns seriously and I'm\nreally concerned when I see an\ninteraction like this that these cops\nare not being that person\nthat you needed right yeah they're\nthey're not actually like listening to\nhim they're\num and even if you disagree factually\nwith what he's saying and I'm not\nblaming the cops for this because I\nthink that it's a it's a shocking kind\nof situation right and they're giving\nvery very clear Direction about what is\nthey're trying to show this person hey\nlike if you pull up to someone and and\nthey drive away like you should\ninterpret that appropriately or\ndifferently from the way that you are\nbut this is something that I've kind of\nnoticed is that when people\ntrigger a particular kind of like you\nknow and so people are calling this\nperson a stalker which may be more fair\nbut you got called a stalker too right\nand and once we sort of trigger this\nkind of response that it's like very\nvery ostracizing\nyes and and so what I'm also kind of\nnoticing here is a complete lack of\ncompassion based on kind of like a\nsurvival and a fear response which once\nagain is understandable\nyeah but I think that this that's\ncommonly what happens\nall right let's keep going\nto hurt you over their daughter\nyeah but that's the thing is she needs\nto have her own free will man you don't\nunderstand I'm a man myself bro and I\nhave needs myself she's choosing her\nFree Will by telling her Daddy what\nhappened to you and I'm telling you stay\naway from her because he will hurt you\nprobably she's being controlled by him\nthat's fine that's her choice right free\nchoice Free Will I think she should go\ndo porn okay you need to leave it's\nlegal you need to leave well we're not\ndoing anything you need to leave I'm\nhaving discussion on it I'm having a\ndiscussion until you leave are you\nthreatening me with the rest\nyou know I'll leave under\nfree to do it every monkey right here\nbut we're not doing anything else\nyeah but there's something Twisted about\nthat there's something Twisted about\nI was going to let her make her own\nchoice after the song\nand I just don't think she had a\nreasonable opportunity to make a choice\nbecause I'm gonna blow up and I'm gonna\nbe a famous DJ and I'm gonna be like how\nold is she uh two years older than me\n27.\nI'll speak with her you should be\nworking today\nI think so you\nhave I believe so uh but I can't stop\nrecording the video\nall about her job she works right\ncorrect okay I'll speak with her and\nI'll get back with you okay all righty\nsounds good thank you guys\nso I'm gonna go ahead and stop here\nbecause I don't wanna\num show this person's face but\num\nI mean they put it on the internet yeah\nwhich is you know their choice but we're\nnot going to kind of go there I'm just\nkind of curious like\nyou know what what amount of like what\ndo you relate to in this this video and\nI I realized that your situation was\nlike somewhat different yeah\num but like you know what what do you\nrelate to what can you help us kind of\nunderstand like\nI would say the biggest thing that I\nnoticed is\nthere's like already at a conclusion in\neveryone's mind in that conversation as\nto what's going on\nthere's no back and forth to try and get\nto what's going on like the officer has\nalready made his assumption it appears\nthe guys already made his assumption\nabout what's happened there's not a\ndialogue it's I'm right no I'm right\nthey're competing and they're just\ntalking at each other saying I'm right\nno I'm right that's the big thing that I\npicked away from that conversation and\nis that similar to kind of what you went\nthrough\nof very much so how so\nspecifically in the instance where I was\nbeing punished for getting punched in\nthe back of the head uh like it was very\nmuch no you did something wrong it's\nlike I sat there and got punched in the\nback of the head how was that wrong it's\nlike well you should have come up with a\nsolution it's like I came up with the\nsolution but he couldn't come up with\none and so that's what we both got\nwritten up it's like\nwell why did he look sorry and you did\nit and so that very much like\ngaslighting uh at least in my case\nwith that situation but I think a lot of\nthat was very for that interaction there\nthere was\njust preconceived notions on both ends\nthat were just slapping up against each\nother versus\ntrying to come alongside each other and\nbeing psyched well why do you think she\nwould leave\ncould it be versus oh no she definitely\ndoesn't like you so just back off that's\nyeah and that may be true but\nuh I think\ncorrect me if I'm wrong but like with\nAlzheimer's it's not the best idea to\njust be like no no this is what happened\nGrandma it's like entering into their\nworld and just being relationally with\nthem yeah it depends yeah uh\nso\nlike I think taking a approach of\ngetting into their world view enough\nto then make that small course\ncorrection uh versus trying to just deny\nthe way they're seeing things outright I\nI think one of the things that I took\naway from\nuh your story JC was that you know you\nkind of emphasize questioning but what I\nalso like what I sort of noticed is that\nthere's dialogue right and and what I'm\nkind of hearing you react to is that\nthat in your situation there really\nwasn't dialogue in this situation you're\nnot really seeing dialogue\nthat there and and that's what really\nkind of terrifies me about this is that\nI think when we when I've worked with\npeople who are sort of like let's say in\nthis vein\num\nwhat what I've sort of found is that\nthere is\nan appropriate\nuh fear-driven reaction\nthat can sometimes really get Amplified\ninto labeling people right and in this\ncase like you could argue that stalker\nis somewhat appropriate\num but but then I I think kind of like\nwhat I've also seen is that people will\nsort of kind of do the same thing that\nyou were kind of thinking about doing\nwhich is like well if people are blaming\nme for being a stalker like if people\nare calling me a stalker and all I did\nwas play some music like I might as well\nright and I've seen this a lot also in\nin the patients that I've worked with\nwho have addictions\nand when they get blamed for being an\naddict even if they're sober because\nlike oh like because you're an addict\nright yeah and and then what they'll end\nup doing is like well if I'm gonna like\nI might as well use if people are gonna\nlike treat me like an addict and it's\nkind of this weird\nsort of logical fallacy or it's kind of\nlike if I'm gonna if I'm doing the the\ntime I might as well do the crime yeah\nand and it's it's really kind of a\nharmful sort of situation and what I'm\nreally terrified by is after hearing\nyour story\nI I'm not sure what the right answer\nhere is but I'm I'm concerned that in\nsituations like this people who are\njudged harshly which may be somewhat\nappropriate there's also a lack of\ndialogue lack of compassion lack of like\nbecause I'm not sure that in this\ninteraction this person really digested\nor understood anything that the cops\nwere saying\nyeah it's very hard\nthat you don't really win arguments by\ngoing you know uh hey you're just wrong\nand I'm right\nand that's how a lot of conversations go\nand then that when it becomes that hey\nyou're just wrong and I'm just right\nthat then feeds into the US versus them\nmentality uh\nand so whenever you're having those\nconversations it's very difficult to\nbreak that down if somebody is already\napproaching it from that perspective and\nto have those conversations\nyeah any other kind of thoughts about\num any light that you can shed based on\nyour own experience about like in this\nsituation or anything that you would\nkind of suggest for people who are sort\nof feeling this way\nuh I would say\nagain reach out and try and have a\ndiverse Community uh I think that's\ndefinitely the thing that has helped me\nout the most uh\nbecause I didn't just stick in my\nSouthern Baptist bubble uh you know uh I\nhung out with Assembly of God people\ncharismatics uh it was a Hindu kid that\ngot to talk to a little bit uh who's a\ngreat above me so I only got to see him\na couple times at lunch and so just\ndiversifying the input in my life\nkind of accelerated and let me kind of\nsee one where everyone was coming from\nbut then also kind of\njust process other World Views and then\nalso see okay like maybe this is right\nor maybe this is right or maybe they're\nboth paradoxically true in some way and\nwe can\nand I can think through both of them\nexisting simultaneously\nand so not just having\none side or one person speak into your\nlife\nyeah I think that that's that's a really\nfantastic point I mean I think what\nwe've sort of seen from our Research\ninto online radicalization is that Echo\nChambers are a huge part of it yeah and\nthat you know it's it's really the\npeople and this is what I'm really\ngrateful to our community for and and I\nappreciate the you know the plug that\nyou offered secretly I'm about I'm\nterrified that a lot of like people who\nare on the road to violence are now\ngoing to show up after watching this I\ndon't know if we can handle that but\num what what I think is really fantastic\nabout our community is that we do offer\nlike different perspectives that's a big\npart of what we're about I don't think\nwe offer and there's a slight caveat\nhere which is we're not we're not\nactually here to offer different\nperspectives we're actually here to grow\nas individuals and as part of that that\ninvolves sharing your perspective and\nlistening to the perspective of others\num I think the biggest problem that we\nsee in our community I would say is that\npeople don't really re acknowledge I\nthink\nthat\neverything that you say impacts other\nhuman beings and so a lot of people feel\nostracized from other communities and\nwill come to us but also to remember\nthat there is an individual\nresponsibility here about how you speak\nand that your words can be helpful or\nharmful to other people and it's not\nactually all about you\nyeah and we're here for you but you\nshould also be here for us\num\nthe other thing that I would kind of say\nin this situation is like I'm going to\ndo a straight plug for therapy I know\nthat when you sort of originally talked\nabout\nuh\nyou know what really helped you the most\nit was actually a pier which I think is\nreally powerful and there's research\nthat actually shows that that's\noftentimes the case yeah um if I can\nclarify that it's therapy definitely\nhelped like CBT was a huge part of it so\ncognitive behavioral therapy learning\nthat but it takes kind of both because\nyou need a stable community to then like\nreally process those things unless\nyou're just extremely mentally strong\nalready uh and so it takes both uh not\njust up here it took the peer to give me\nenough hope to then try the CPT and so\nyeah so it both were needed it's funny\nthat you mentioned that because we\nactually like the data very much\nsupports that view that\num just to give you like a couple bits\nof data from our own internal stuff so\none is that we find that so we have a\npeer support coaching program and we\nfind that it's very complementary to\ntherapy like that the two were\ndefinitely not replacements for each\nother\num and and that like they work well\nsynergistically actually kind of like\ndiet and exercise and then the other\nthing that's really interesting about\nthat is that I would say somewhere\nbetween maybe 10 and 20 of people who\nenter our coaching program will then go\non to therapy like in a very like\namicable and positive way because they\nkind of realize that oh like actually I\nlike I can talk to people and there's\ntheir meat needs that I have that are\nnot being met through coaching and then\nthey'll they'll actually move into\ntherapy the main reason that I was kind\nof talking about a therapy in this\nsituation is if if people are watching\nthis and can relate to you\nand can relate to the person that we\nwatched\nI think the challenge is that oftentimes\nif you go to peers or if you do\nsomething like go to police you're going\nto get the reaction that this person got\nwhich is\nI would argue both appropriate and\nlacking in some degree of compassion\nright and it's our you could also make a\nvery good argument that it's not a\npolice officer's job to offer compassion\nit's their job to ensure safety which is\nexactly what they're doing so this isn't\na criticism of the police but if we\nreally think about okay where is the one\nplace that you can go where you can\nshare anything\nand it is literally the person's\nresponsibility\nto try to demonstrate some degree of\ncompassion understanding and empathy and\nengage you in dialogue that is designed\nfor like your benefit without being like\nharshly judgmental and writing you off\nlike that's like literally what a\ntherapist's job is yeah and and so when\nI see interactions like this I kind of\nthink a little bit about okay like what\nhow would this person's life we're\npresuming that they're not in therapy\nmaybe they are who knows\num but how would this person's life be\ndifferent if there was like a single\nhuman being because what I really heard\nfrom your story is like it just takes\none human being\num\nto to Really you know you've been pushed\nto the edge people are bullying you the\nauthority figures that are supposed to\nprotect you are like they're not on your\nside and in fact they're being played\nand sort of almost willingly played or\neven just like apathetically played by\nthe people who are actually bullying you\nso it's like there's just a lack of\nsafeguards the other thing that I think\nreally I I I really empathize with and\nand really like struggle when I think\nabout what these people are going\nthrough is that\nyou basically should have had\na number of different things that should\nhave gone like gone well for you like\neither you had friends or you had\nteachers who were kind of aware or\nauthority figures who like like\nrecognize that this kind of isn't your\nfault you had teachers who were standing\nthree feet away when you were getting\nbullied and like didn't really do much\nabout it\nand you even had a parent who when you\ngot suspended their first response was\nlike do you realize how this makes me\nlook\nas well as what other kinds of\nchallenges that that the people in your\nhousehold faced right like sometimes\npeople struggle with addiction sometimes\npeople struggle with mental illness like\nthat's sort of not their fault but what\nI'm really kind of noticing is that this\noutcome came from a failure of multiple\nsafeguards yes and I think what we're\nwhat we're really lacking in society is\nan appreciation of like how many things\nhave to go wrong and this is what I love\nabout the conversation with you is\nreally appreciating how many things have\nto go wrong to push a human being to the\nedge of violence yeah and I I don't get\nthe sense that\nwe as a society have elucidated that or\nunderstand that instead what we tend to\ndo is respond reflexively with judgment\nwhich once again may be like somewhat\nappropriate right because yeah in this\nthere's still an individual\nresponsibility that I hold for\nabsolutely getting to that point right\nand then Society maybe made that choice\neasier but it was still my choice\nabsolutely and I and I love that Nuance\nbut I think that's also where like we've\ngot to kind of acknowledge that\npeople who are prone to violence are not\nusually born that way that it takes like\nfailure after failure after failure that\nreally pushes them to the edge and and I\nI actually think a lot of people who\noftentimes push to the edge of violence\nwill actually decide I'd say the\nmajority decide not to commit violence\nin fact it's the it's a real real\nminority that goes down that route\num and I think there's probably data to\nsupport that but and this is one of\nthose things where all the people who\ndecide not to do stuff like we never\nhear from them right yeah I mean so\nyou're kind of the exception which is\nwhy we're grateful that you came today\nbut most of the time they just\nget close to the edge and then they sort\nof like pull back and then they go on 15\nyears later to build some kind of life\nand then you're never gonna know yeah\nanyway I I really appreciate you coming\non any kind of like last thoughts or\nquestions before we wrap up for the day\nuh no uh I mean just\nI think just again just it as long as we\ncan keep approaching that Nuance uh and\nstart to have that individual and\ncorporate responsibility discussion uh\nwhen addressing not only violence but\nany other social ill uh I think that\nwill move things forward a lot\nbetter than the bickering we typically\ndo in politics yeah amen\nbecause it it just feels like you the\none side it's all individual person and\nand it's all about them and then the\nother side it's no it's it only the\ncommunity's fault that this person's in\nthis situation and it's\nwe need that Nuance in every\nconversation not just this one\ncool so it sounds like that's that's I\nmean any other final words directed like\nif there's someone who's considering\nviolence who's watching this right now\nlike anything that you would wanna any\nmessage that you want to send loud and\nclear to them\nuh it's not worth it for one uh\nthere's way more\nopportunities in life than you think uh\nand\nas difficult as it is to think that\nthere is a future for you there is\nand so hold on to that future you know\nit may seem like a long time away uh but\nthe things that you are going to learn\nfrom struggling through this is going to\nhelp you help other people never to even\nget to this place that you're at and so\nyou can help people stop halfway down\nthe path versus 99 way down the path and\nthen they don't have to go through that\nlast 49 that you went through\nyeah well I I can Echo that and I just\nwant to say JC thank you so much for\nhaving this conversation because that's\nwhat I really hope is that you having\ngone through this dark period in your\nlife like\nso hopefully someone's listening to this\nand and can see that 15 years later like\nyou know you can be intelligent be it\nsounds like you're somewhat content with\nlife and and not you know really really\nupset about everything oh no no life is\npretty life is going pretty good yeah so\nand and I that's the challenge right is\nwhat we tend to glorify especially\nthrough the media is the people who\ncommit violence and then the people who\nare relatively content in life 15 years\nlater like we never hear from them and\nso I think what we're almost seeing is a\nselection bias towards violence and kind\nof like media\nkind of inflammation where there's also\nresearch about for example suicide\nclusters and things like that that when\nthere's\nwhen we popularize either violence or\nsuicide that we'll see an uptick in\nthose kinds of behaviors and I you know\nwe never hear from the people who ended\nup building something in their life so\nthank you so much for sharing and thank\nyou so much for coming on and hopefully\naltering the trajectory of of some\npeople who are in really dark places\nyeah\nI said I came on just to try and give\nsome people hope and you know it is a\nlong path but to get back but it is a\nhundred percent worth it cool well thank\nyou very much JC take care buddy thank\nyou\nalrighty\nyeah so\num\nyou know it's kind of tricky because we\ndon't have these kinds of conversations\nright like we don't have these kinds of\nconversations\nand I sort of get why\nyou know it's it's so much easier to\nread a click bait article about someone\nwho commits violence it's so much easier\nto watch something that is so viscerally\nand emotionally engaging like we did\ntoday\nand it's really easy to like toss\njudgment out\nbut when I when I hear JC's story\nI hear a lot of things\nthat\nare really not in his favor\nso we're hearing a parent who was\narguably emotionally unavailable\na parent who struggled with an addiction\na sibling with mental illness\num you know parents who were somewhat\noverprotective were also hearing like a\nlittle bit of like\nyou know JC needing to somehow balance\nout the Badness of what their dad saw in\ntheir job which is a big responsibility\nto place on a kid\nand then you throw bullying into the mix\nyou throw\nsexual discrimination into the mix you\nthrow\nauthority figures who aren't really like\nlooking out for you into the mix you\nthrow parents who are more concerned\nabout their own image than helping their\nchild who's struggling\nand what do you end up with\nright\nyou have a kid who everyone's calling a\nrapist a stalker whatever gay\nyou know and and you've got no like\npeople are doing bad stuff for you\npeople are supposed to be looking out\nfor you there's supposed to be a system\nin place\nthat is supposed to provide fairness and\njustice\nand when someone takes that when that\nsystem that's supposed to provide\nfairness and Justice provides neither of\nthose things\nyou know what I really heard from JC is\nthat like\nyou have to take justice into your own\nhands become a vigilante\nright because no one else is looking out\nfor you\nand the other really shocking thing is\nthat it doesn't take much\nit takes just a little bit of compassion\nit takes one person showing up and\nsaying hey I'm gonna be your friend\nand so like if you're listening to this\nand you're thinking about violence the I\nstrongly strongly encourage you all to\nlike listen to JC because he understands\nwhat y'all have gone through\nright because he's gone through it\nhimself like he was thinking about doing\nthings and even as he put it did a dry\nrun\nand he was sure he was going to be\nsuccessful\nand when things feel really really Bleak\nright we think oh like\nthe hurt that I feel is so bad that\nnothing will be able to fix it\nI need to commit a very great Act\nand that's not just we're not just\ntalking about violence here we're also\ntalking about things like I failed out\nof college so this was mine\nyou know I basically failed out of\ncollege and the only way I can make up\nfor it\nis to go to Harvard for example right so\nthe worst that we feel about ourselves\nthe darker our life becomes the greater\nthe thing that we need to do to balance\nit\nand when you're in a really really dark\nspot you think that it takes a huge\namount of stuff\nto actually fix your life\nbut if you really listen to JC's story\nand I'd say that data supports this the\nscience supports this it doesn't\nactually take a huge amount of stuff it\ntakes a tiny amount of stuff to\ncompletely turn around the trajectory of\nlife\nthis is where we have to understand\nthere's a difference between velocity\nand acceleration\nso even if you have\na very strong let's say negative\nvelocity all it takes is a tiny bit of\nacceleration in the opposite direction\nto actually move you in the right\ndirection\nthis is the big thing that I think\npeople don't understand about recovery\nin life\nI've worked with patients who have been\nusing heroin for 30 years\nand they think oh my god I've been using\nheroin for 30 years it's going to be so\nhard for me to become sober\nhow many days do they have to be sober\nto be one year sober\nthe same amount of days as if you were\naddicted to heroin for two years\nwhat does it actually take to turn your\nlife around you just need a tiny amount\nof compassion\nyou need like one person\nand that's why I would like this is a\ncase where I would strongly recommend\ntherapy\nright because there is there's someone\nout there who's trained to be able to\nhandle\nall of the dirty thoughts that you have\nand that's what we're trained for\nwe go through years of training to be\nable to sit with the darkness inside you\nand that's okay\nit actually doesn't take a lot it takes\nactually very little and I've seen that\ntime and time again gives me hope for\nHumanity\nso if anything my clinical experience\nhas taught me it's that like things are\nnot as bad as we think they are but I\ndon't blame anyone for thinking that\nbecause why did you get to think that\nway it's because you've been failed I\nmean the world has let you down over and\nover and over and over and over again\nright we see like a ton of different\nessentially safety nets\ngive way\nand so it just takes a little bit it\nactually doesn't take a lot which is\nhard to understand\nand the last thing is that for those of\nyou that\naren't having thoughts like that\nrecognize that\nin order to alter so if we go back to\nwhoever this the the guardian angel was\nright this like 13 year old girl who\nlike walked up to a kid who was\nstruggling and said I'm gonna be your\nfriend\nand diverted some amount of mass\nviolence\nand so we think about like being a\ndoctor is like oh like I'm gonna be a\ndoctor and I'm gonna save lives\nyou don't have to be a doctor to save\nlives you just have to be a good human\nbeing\nand so as best as you can we're not\nsaying that you're responsible for\ndiverting you know people who are\nthinking about Mass violence but like\ntry to be a decent human being\nbecause it doesn't take a whole lot like\nyou don't have to give a whole lot of\ncompassion to like help someone who's in\na really dark place\nand what I'm hearing here is that you\nknow we we sometimes hear about this\nkind of stuff where like in Uvalde Texas\nrecently there was a school shooting and\nthere were like literally like 50 or 100\nor 100s I don't even know\nof police officers outside the school\nand we can kind of blame them for not\nstopping the shooting or whatnot but I\nwhat I want y'all to really realize is\nthat the one 13 year old girl\ndid more\nfor the people in that school than a\nhundred police officers\none 13 year old girl did more than\nparents teachers whatever\nand so like this is the key thing that I\nthink we need to take away is that we\ncan do a lot\nwe can do so much\nbut somewhere along the way we started\nbelieving\nthat we can't\nwe started looking at the world and\nseeing that\nthe darkness in the world is so great\nthat the problems are so gigantic that I\nhave become insignificant\nbut I can't actually make an impact\nand that's when we started that's the\nreason the world is the way that it is\nbecause we as human beings started\nbelieving that we were ineffectual\nand the moment we start believing we're\nineffectual is when the world goes to\n[ __ ]\nthis can be true of the world and it can\nalso be true in your own life when you\nstart believing that oh I can't fix this\nbecause this problem is too big\nthe moment you start thinking that is\nactually when your life starts going to\nshed\nso it's kind of bizarre\nbut what we actually need to do\nis\njust acknowledge that we have power in\nthis world\neven in your own life or in some other\nlife\noh sorry I'm getting distracted by the\ngarage door but\num\nso like just just acknowledge for a\nmoment that it doesn't take a whole lot\nto start to move your life\nin the other direction\nand acknowledge that it also doesn't\ntake a whole lot for you to move\nsomeone else's life in the right\ndirection\nand acknowledge that the garage door can\nhas a powerful impact on the world too\nokay\nany questions before we wrap up for the\nday\nso this is a pretty good question one is\nhow do you express compassion for\nsomeone that you truly despise\nso this is where it's going to sound\nkind of weird I'd say you don't have to\nstart there\nright you don't have to start there\nso I'd say like you don't have to\nexpress compassion for every human being\nit's good if you do\nbut cut yourself some slack start by\nexpressing some compassion towards\nyourself\nfor struggling\nto express compassion for someone else\nand when you're ready to really think\nabout it try to remember that human\nbeings are to a certain degree a product\nof their circumstances\nand that oftentimes even the people that\nwe despise are living life in the best\nway that they can\nso I I think that's where like if you\nthink about people that you despise\nyou know there's a certain amount of\nthat that is their fault but that\nthere's a certain amount to that that is\nlike\nwas kind of the life that they grew up\nwith and I think the more that you\nacknowledge that like hopefully you can\nreduce the amount that you despise them\nlike from a hundred percent down to\nlet's say 50 or 60 percent and then in\nthat Gap hopefully there's space for\ncompassion to grow\nso thanathoth is saying so as long as I\nbelieve in myself and keep working I'll\nfix my life eventually\nso let's think about that for a second\nso as long as I believe in my life and\nkeep working I'll fix my life eventually\nlet's flip that statement around\nif I don't believe in myself and if I\nstop working\nwill my life be fixed\nthe answer to that question is clearly\nno\nright so this is the tricky thing is the\nmind says how if I do this I'll get it\neventually right it's looking for a\nguarantee but flip the question around\nwill you do it eventually I know this is\ngoing to sound kind of weird I have no\nidea\nbut you're like wait Dr K if you have no\nidea like why should I do it and I'm\ngonna say well consider the opposite if\nyou stop believing in yourself and you\nstop trying what's going to happen well\nthat certainly ain't gonna work so you\nmight as well try\nand it's that attitude that I'm gonna\ntry and I don't even know if this is\ngoing to work that's actually the best\nattitude to have\nbecause it's when you look for your life\nbeing fixed eventually\nthat then what starts to happen\nbecause you're like I've been doing this\na year my year my life is not fixed I've\nbeen doing this for two years my life is\nnot fixed I've been doing this for three\nyears my life is not fixed I'm doing\nthis for four years my life is not fixed\nwhen is it gonna be fixed when is it\ngonna be fixed when is it going to be\nfixed and as long as that eventually is\nin your mind you're actually like never\ngoing to be satisfied with your progress\nbecause you're looking for a fixed life\nso I would say that this is exactly what\nwe mean by like when we say like there's\na mindset shift because everyone's like\nshift your mindset\nit is mindset performance mindset growth\nmindset you must mindset once you but\nthe how what does it look like to shift\nyour mindset means literally to notice\nsome of your thoughts and not operate\nwithin those thoughts\nI would even argue that if I do this\nwill it work eventually is the old\nmindset\nit's just\nthe reflection of it but it's still the\nsame mindset which is that if I do a b\nand c it'll be fixed at some point\nand I think the right mindset is even if\nit isn't going to be fixed and I don't\nknow it's going to be fixed I'm going to\ntry anyway because that's what I can do\nand once you start living life that way\nit's not only liberating but things get\nway way easier\nright it's like the difference between\nokay like how many how many people do I\nneed to ask out before I get married if\nI keep asking people out I'll get\nmarried eventually right\nand so you're making it like a numbers\ngame so like then you ask out a thousand\npeople and lo and behold you're still\nnot married the right attitude is okay\nwhat can I do today to try to find\ncompanionship\nwhat can I do today to try to find\ncompanionship\nand the more that you focus on the here\nand now as opposed to\nfilling in like grinding towards your\ntrophy in life like it doesn't work like\nthat\nand why do we think it works like that\nthat's because what Society has\nconditioned us to think\nright because like everywhere in our\nlife we're conditioned to think that you\nhave to grind towards something\neven if we listen to JC he's like five\nmore years of this and then I'm free\nhe got freed way before five years\nfour years of college and then I'm then\nI live my golden life\nI get a good job the Holy Grail then you\nstart your good job and you're like\nthree years of this [ __ ] until I get\npromoted then I can do what I want\nfive years of this [ __ ] until I get\npromoted then I can do what I want\nand now you even have these fire people\nright\nFinancial Independence and retire early\nso instead of retiring at 65 I'm gonna\ngrind my ass off for 25 years and then\nI'm gonna live the good life at 55.\nall the same thing eventually eventually\neventually eventually\nif you want to transform your life get\nrid of the word eventually\nthink about how damaging the word is\nI'll get around to it eventually\nI'll go to the dentist eventually I'll\nbuy floss eventually I'll do my homework\neventually I'll be happy eventually\nI'll find love eventually\nget rid of the word\nnotice what your mind is doing everyone\nsays just do it\nthat's one translation of it but the\nquestion is how\nthe the method of just do it the how is\nin the word eventually notice what your\nmind says and what behaviors do you\njustify by using the word eventually\nand any behavior that comes out of the\nword eventually is one that you should\nbe very critical of\nso if your mind says eventually dot dot\ndot then be very careful about that\nstrategy and once you start to change\nthat your life will turn around"
