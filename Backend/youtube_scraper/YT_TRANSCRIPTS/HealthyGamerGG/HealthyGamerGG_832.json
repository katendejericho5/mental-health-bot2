    "transcript": "if I want this person to like me what\nI'm going to do is I'm going to pretend\nto be into the stuff that they're into\nright so if this person is into metal\nbands I'm going to pretend to like oh I\nlove metal too so you kind of become\nthis chameleon in life where you don't\nhave your own Joys preferences desires\nyou kind of adapt and absorb the desires\nof other people all right so let's talk\na little bit about borderline\npersonality disorder today so borderline\npersonality disorder I think is one of\nthe most misunderstood and stigmatized\ndisorders out there a couple of the most\ncommon misconceptions or first of all\nborderline personality disorders like\npermanent right because when we think\nabout certain illnesses these are things\nthat happen to you so something like\nanxiety is something that happens to you\nand hopefully with treatment or therapy\nor medication can be cured but when we\ntalk about personality disorders like\nborderline personality disorder\nnarcissistic personality disorder we\nthink about these things as part of your\npersonality which means if they're part\nof your personality you're kind of\nscrewed because it's like who you are so\nthat thankfully isn't true the other big\nthing about borderline personality\ndisorder is that these people tend to be\nstigmatized very very very heavily so\nsometimes it's very hard to form and\nmaintain relationships people with BPD\nare oftentimes viewed as manipulative\nand very like prone to doing things like\nlying and stuff like that will be sort\nof very like emotionally contentious and\nthe last thing with BPD is that they\ntend to be very poorly characterized in\nmedia so if you look at things like the\nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend this is something\nthat's usually viewed as like BPD so\nwhat I'd love to do today is talk to you\nall a little bit about what BPD looks\nlike from the outside so what other\npeople see when they look at someone who\nhas BPD what BPD feels like on the\ninside so what are sort of some of the\nsubjective experiences of people who\nstruggle with BPD we're then going to\ntalk a little bit about the formation of\nborderline personality disorder I.E\nwhere does it come from is it genetic is\nit in your brain is it controllable is\nit psychological and then then we're\ngoing to end with sort of talking a\nlittle bit about treatment and prognosis\nso are there treatments for BPD do they\nwork what can I expect if I have BPD so\nlet's start first with talking a little\nbit about what does it look like from\nthe outside so people with BPD tend to\nhave uh there are three sort of big\nthings that people tend to see with\npeople who have BPD the first is a\npattern of unstable relationships so\nwhat this sort of means is that people\nwith BPD can become really really good\nfriends with other people like very\nquickly they can sort of fall into\nsomething like oh I've never played\nguitar but like now I'm going to join a\nband and I'm going to play guitar and\nwe're going to go touring like for three\nmonths all over the US and it's going to\nbe fantastic we're gonna go over the\nworld so they can fall into things\nreally quickly they can also like fall\ninto romantic relationships really\nquickly like I met this person a week\nago and now we're talking about moving\nin the problem is that these kinds of\nrelationships tend to be really unstable\nso it's it's very very high octane high\nspeed but also like things crash pretty\neasily yeah I moved out of my apartment\nI bought a guitar I've been touring for\na month and now there's all kinds of\ninterpersonal conflict or I moved in\nwith this person two months in and now\nwe're fighting all the time so they tend\nto have a uh what people sort of see\nfrom the outside is that this person\nit's hard for them to maintain stable\nrelationships over time the second thing\nthat we tend to find is that they have\nif you look at this person what you're\ngoing to see is strong emotional\nreactions so this can be very\nfrustrating from a relationship\nstandpoint because if you're in a\nrelationship with someone with BPD\nromantic Platonic Family or any of the\nabove you may find that small things\nthat you do will evoke strong negative\nreactions so for example like let's say\nyou forget a friend's birthday and then\nwhat's gonna happen is the friend will\nget really really upset with you and\nthey'll like start like doing all this\nweird kind of stuff where they're like\nyou ask them hey what's wrong and\nthey're like oh nothing's wrong but you\ncan tell that something's wrong but they\nkind of like won't communicate it to you\nso you'll see strong emotional reactions\nlike if you get the wrong birthday\npresent maybe they'll they'll sort of\nexplode or what you'll kind of see is\nthat they're if you start to pull away\nif you don't talk to them quite as much\nlike they'll start to engage in a lot of\nwhat feels like manipulative Behavior or\nguilt tripping or gaslighting to try to\nget you to kind of re-engage if if\nyou're friends with someone who has BPD\nor maybe you experience this as well\nsometimes there'll also be like benign\nthings that will cause you to feel\nreally really angry or really really\nashamed of yourself or really really\nguilty that there's essentially a strong\nemotional response the last thing that\nwe tend to see kind of from the outside\nof someone who has VPD is that this is\nsomeone who may not really understand\nentirely who they are they get really\nexcited about stuff but they don't seem\nto have a consistent trajectory in life\nthey may get excited by particular\nthings very easily but if you sort of\nask them like who are you what do you\nwant from life sometimes they'll be able\nto give you answers right they'll say\nthings like the only thing I want from\nlife is you I just want you I just want\nyou I just want you but that's not\nreally that that's not them right they\nsort of almost have this distorted sense\nof self-image so that's sort of what\nborderline personality disorder can look\nlike from the outside once we move to\ninternally so what is the subjective\nexperience of people with BPD so the\nfirst is that they tend to have a fear\nof Abandonment and what that sort of\nmeans is that if you have BPD what what\npeople with BPD are oftentimes afraid of\nis screwing up relationships they're\nreally really afraid that let like if I\nsay the wrong thing or if I do the wrong\nthing that I'll drive this person away\nthey really do believe like people are\ngoing to leave them people are waiting\nto leave them people are looking for any\nkind of excuse to leave them and if you\nhave those kinds of thoughts like oh my\nGod like this person is looking for an\nexcuse to break up with me we've been\ndating for six years and since the third\nmonth they've been looking for an excuse\nthey've been looking for an excuse\nthat's what your subjective experience\nis like if you have BPD and so\noftentimes what it feels like is that\nrelationships are incredibly incredibly\nstressful because you're walking this\ntightrope of if you seem too clingy\nthey're going to break up with you if\nyou seem to stand off and standoffish\nenough they're going to break up with\nyou and this isn't just we're sort of\nusing romantic examples here but this is\nalso in like family relationships so if\nyou have like a parent-child\nrelationship with BPD this is the kind\nof thing where your parents are\nterrified that you're going to leave you\nor you're going to be terrified that\nyour parents will you know marry someone\nelse and then like abandon you and\nthey're going to be like they're going\nto have step kids and they're going to\nlove their step kids more than they love\nyou or if you're the parent you're\nafraid that your your kids are going to\nleave the house and then they'll never\ncall you again they hate to come home\nfor Christmas which oftentimes happen\nhappens right because you use them to\nmeet your emotional needs which we'll\nget to in a second so what we sort of\nsee is that there's a fear of\nAbandonment but subjectively what that\nfeels like is sort of a fear that you're\ngoing to screw up relationships and that\nthese people are going to leave you the\nother thing that's really interesting\nabout the subject active experience of\npeople with BPD and this is something\nthat I think we really lack compassion\nfor because some of the behaviors that\npeople with BPD exhibit can be so\nfrustrating is that their internal\nemotional experience hurts so [ __ ]\nmuch so people with borderline\npersonality disorder their experience of\nlife can be incredibly painful so I want\nyou all to kind of think about it this\nway where like I can rip a Band-Aid off\nand that's like it hurts for a few\nseconds like maybe it hurts for maybe 10\nseconds and it's like a 6 out of 10 pain\nbut if I've got BPD the pain signals of\nlife especially emotional pain are\nactually Amplified so things like\nbreakups will actually like almost in an\nobjective way we're talking about\nsubjective but if you kind of rate the\nemotional pain from a breakup and if you\nif you take two people one person with\nBPD one person without BPD it'll hurt\nway more for the person with BPD so it's\nalmost like their nerves are on fire\nwhen it comes to emotional pain so it it\ncan almost be really confusing for\npeople with BPD because they recognize\nthat this life feels harder than what my\nother friends are kind of going through\nthat I've had three friends they all\nlet's say went through a romantic\nbreakup and they're able to bounce\nbounce back after like two to six months\nbut one year later I'm still feeling so\nso so hurt over this kind of thing and\nthis is this sort of complicates\nrelationships because what ends up\nhappening is that I don't get over it\nright so I'm hurting and normally like\ntwo months after a relationship people\ngive me a lot of support but then they\nget tired of it after four months five\nmonths six months eight months and so\nthen what ends up happening is that like\npeople stop supporting me emotionally\nbecause I kind of need more emotional\nsupport because it actually hurts more\nthan the average person the other very\ncommon experience in BPD is subjective\nfeelings of emptiness so this is where\nwe kind of like\num you know you kind of feel like empty\non the inside like you don't really know\nwho you are you don't really know what\nyou want from Life a lot of times the\ngoals that you set are just to get rid\nof the pain it's not necessarily moving\ntowards something it's moving away from\nsomething so what I really want is I\nwant to get rid of this loneliness and\nI'm even willing to get back together\nwith my abusive partner Because unless\nthey're around I feel really untethered\nin life and I feel kind of empty on the\ninside I don't really know who I am the\nlast thing that oftentimes happens with\npeople with BPD is that they'll\nsometimes dissociate or disconnect from\nlife and this is probably a neurologic\ncoping mechanism where since there is so\nmuch pain that we experience\nsubjectively and we'll get to the\nNeuroscience of why this happens in a\nminute what they end up actually doing\nis like detaching or dissociating from\nthat pain and they kind of feel\ndisconnected and if you kind of think\nabout it that relates to the feeling of\nemptiness because the more that I\ndisconnect from myself the harder it is\nto discover who I am so in terms of the\nsubjective experience of BPD the four\nkind of most common things that I've\nseen as a clinician first is a fear of\nAbandonment second is just really\nintense emotional suffering like as a\nclinician I think my patients with BPD\nemotionally suffer more than the ones\nwithout BPD and I know that's sort of a\ncomparative statement and I'm not saying\nthat someone who has severe depression\nor schizophrenia and psychosis suffers\nmore than someone who has BPD but I mean\non average the normal experience of life\nif you have BPD is more painful than not\nhaving BPD there are also a lot of\nfeelings of emptiness and some amount of\ndissociation or Detachment so what this\nsort of results in is when you take\nthese two kinds of things like these\ninternal feelings what this results in\nis a number of different behaviors that\nBPD people with BPD engage in so as I'm\ngoing through life afraid of Abandonment\nfeeling empty on the inside feeling a\nlot of emotional intensity in order to\ncope with that I'll engage in certain\nkinds of behaviors and this is really\nwhere the disorder part really comes in\nbecause the more that we see these kinds\nof behaviors the more uh outcomes get\nworse for people with BPD so the first\nthing that they tend to do is engage in\nimpulsive behaviors right so this goes\nback to the like I'm going to fall\ndeeply deeply in love with this person\nbecause I'm going to feel such an\nemotional High hanging out with them\nthis is the this is the best person even\nthough my last 10 relationships have\nbeen train wrecked this person feels\ndifferent this person truly loves me\nthis is real love this is what\neveryone's talking about in the movies\nso I'm gonna move on in with them so we\nsee a lot of impulsive behavior there's\nalso High correlations with eating\ndisorders and BPD we also see self-harm\nbehaviors which I think are really\ninteresting because self-harm behaviors\naren't always suicidal in nature this is\nsomething that a lot of people don't\nunderstand self-injurious behavior and\nsuicidal ideation are not always the\nsame thing suicidal ideation is when I\nwant to kill myself and end my life\nwhich by the way people at BPD are very\nhigh risk of so that's that's a very\nreal risk but the self-injurious\nbehavior doesn't necessarily correlate\nwith that when I've worked with patients\nwho have BPD when I ask them why do you\ncut or why do you burn or why do you do\nself-injurious Behavior what I tend to\nfind is that it's almost a meditative\npractice for them I'm not advocating for\ndoing that but if you ask them okay when\ndo you cut well I cut when I feel\nemotionally really really when the pain\ngets so intense on the inside and I'm so\nunloved if I start cutting that pain the\npain of the physical sensation of the\ncut actually knocks the emotional pain\nand the fear of loneliness and\nabandonment out of my mind it's a very\nintense focusing technique and even if\nyou look at the methods of\nself-injurious behavior that people with\nBPD engage in it's oftentimes things\nthat are not damaging to the body but\nactually experience the highest amount\nof pain so if we look at people who cut\nin BPD what they tend to do is very\nsuperficial Cuts they don't do deep Cuts\nthey're not trying to hurt themselves\nbut if you look at the superficial part\nof the skin that's when we actually have\nvery very sensitive nerves so we have\nthese nerves that will do light touch so\nyou can just do a very light touch and\nyou can feel it right even if you think\nabout tickling right it's a very light\ntouch evokes a lot of response so a lot\nof pain actually if you sort of focus on\njust on the very surface the the\nintensity of the pain is actually higher\nso engage in self-injurious behaviors\nwe'll also see substance use disorders\nas being very comorbid with BPD and\nwhat's that about it's once again I'm\nfeeling so much pain on the inside I\nwant to forget it right and if I get\nhigh if I get drunk if I use some kind\nof drugs then it's going to make all\nthat pain go away and the last kind of\nbehavior that we'll sort of see from\npeople who are who have BPD is what from\nthe outside looks like manipulative\nbehavior and we'll kind of get into that\nin a second but essentially what happens\nis that there are different ways I can\ndeal with feeling empty or bad on the\ninside and one of the ways I can feel\nbetter is to feel loved by someone else\nright so if I'm feeling very abandoned\nand I do something that evokes love and\ncaring from other people then I'll feel\nbetter about my salt so these are some\ncommon behaviors which oftentimes create\nall kinds of problems in the lives of\npeople who struggle with BPD now what\nI'd love to do here is actually pause\nfor a second and just share with you all\nmy understanding so if we take all this\nstuff when we kind of boil it down at\nits Essence what is BPD here's what I've\nkind of come to understand this is sort\nof a clinical perspective and also based\na little bit about on my you know years\nof training is in yoga and meditation so\nwhen we go through life we have a sense\nof self and that sense of self is\nsomething that we carry with us and can\nrespond to the things around us so for\nexample if I am confident in myself and\nthings don't go my way let's say I get\nfired from a job I won't let getting\nfired as a from a job determine my value\nas a human being right so if I've done\ngood work in this world and I believe\nthat I'm a good person and I'm a parent\nand I'm a good friend and I'm a good\nhusband and I'm a good doctor even if I\nget fired from a job that one incident\ndoesn't determine German who I am so we\nhave this sense of self and what we know\nfrom BPD is the core issue in my opinion\nis that the sense of self is distorted\nor not formed very well so I don't\nreally know who I am so this sort of\nresults in feelings of emptiness we also\nsort of see a link with trauma so\noftentimes what happens with BPD is that\npeople will grow up in traumatic\nsituations and when they grow up in\ntraumatic situations the sense of self\ncannot form in a healthy way so where\ndoes that confident sense of self comes\nfrom come from it essentially comes from\nlike a nurturing and caring environment\nwe'll get to that a little bit in a\nsecond too when we talk about the\ndevelopment of BPD but the core thing is\nthat I don't know who I am on the inside\nthat's the core feature so then we can\nsee a lot of other things one is that\nhow I feel about myself is determined by\nhow people treat me so if people treat\nme with lots of love and care I in turn\nlove and care myself if people treat me\nwith hostility anger resentment then I\nwill sort of feel like a really terrible\nperson\nso who I am is determined by how I'm\ntreated that in my opinion is the core\nfeature of BPD and explains all kinds of\nother things because this explains why I\nneed people to love me all the time\nbecause if someone stops loving me and\nit's not necessarily if they stop loving\nme if they travel somewhere for a week\nand then without that daily reassurance\nof their love I'm not able to love\nmyself and I start to feel empty I start\nto feel abandoned even though I\nlogically know that this person still\ncares about me but I require that kind\nof input from the outside to determine\nmy my worth and so what that also\nresults in is like kind of becoming a\nchameleon and so this kind of creates a\nlot of problems in relationships because\nif I want this person to like me what\nI'm going to do is I'm going to pretend\nto be into the stuff that they're into\nright so if this person is into metal\nbands I'm going to pretend to like oh I\nlove metal too so you kind of become\nthis chameleon in life where you don't\nhave your own Joys preferences desires\nyou kind of adapt and absorb the the\ndesires of other people the problem\nthough is that as you kind of become\nthis chameleon you're like yeah I'm\nsuper into battle too in order to engage\nwith them you may not actually be super\ninto metal so you almost create this\nkind of false contract with the people\naround you that you pretend to be into\nmetal you pretend to be in in the metal\nyou're super into it and then three\nmonths go by four months go by five\nmonths go by you're not really into\nmetal so it starts to become hard to\nmaintain that facade as it's hard to\nmaintain that facade people start to\nlike realize oh you're actually not that\ninto metal so that they stop inviting\nyou to stuff and if they stop inviting\nyou to stuff that triggers the fear of\nAbandonment and then you're like no no\nI'm really into metal I promise I'm into\nmetal I'm into metal I'm into metal one\nof the most tragic things that I ever\nsaw was a a person who had BPD who was\nin a relationship with someone who\nwanted to be in an open relationship and\nthey were sort of like all in because\nthis is what my partner wants I don't\nwant them to leave me so I'm going to\nagree to an open relationship even\nthough it's not what I want and then\nonce you enter into an open relationship\nand your partner is like you know having\nsexual relations with a lot of other\npeople that actually exacerbates the\nfear of Abandonment and really just\ncauses all kinds of behaviors to explode\nso the core issue here is that we don't\nreally know who we are on the inside and\nso who how we feel about ourselves is\ndetermined by how we're treated now what\nwe're going to do is get into a little\nbit about how BPD develops so we sort of\nknow because just a couple of like\nNeuroscience things to start off with\nthe first is that BPD has a high level\nof heritability so there's a strong\ngenetic component so the uh the genetic\ncomponent of BPD explains about 37 to 65\npercent of BPD so what that sort of\nmeans is that there's a strong genetic\ncomponent now I think some of these\nstudies are a little bit flawed because\nI think that it's not just the genetics\nit's also the upbringing of the\nhousehold so if you have a parent with\nBPD I think that accounts for a lot of\nthe development of BPD in the child so\nso it could be some amount of nurture as\nopposed to Nature because you've got a\nparent who's got BPD so what we see in\nthe brains of people with BPD is that\nthey have increased emotional\nresponsiveness so what that sort of\nmeans is that if something bad happens\nto me it may take me 10 seconds or 15\nseconds to get really angry whereas\nsomeone with BPD will get angry within a\nsingle second so their the amygdalas of\npeople with BPD are actually a little\nbit smaller which people may think okay\nso they remember the amygdala is our\nfear center of the brain as our survival\ncenter of the brain so does smaller mean\nless no usually smaller in the brain\nmeans more because we're not able to\nregulate it as much so people will feel\nnegative emotions more intensely and\nfaster the other thing that we know\nabout the brains of people with BPD is\nthat they experience those negative\nemotions for longer than someone who\ndoesn't have BPD so that sort of means\nis that I'll get pissed over 30 seconds\nand then I'll stay pissed for about an\nhour hour and a half whereas someone\nwith BPD will get pissed within one\nsecond and they'll stay pissed for like\neight hours so their experience\nday-to-day of Life Changes because of\nthe way that their brain actually works\nso we also have evidence that there's a\ndysregulation of the stress system so\npeople with BPD will be in high stress\nStates for longer periods of time and\nthey're also very uh sensitive to\nstimuli so what does that kind of mean\nthis is really one of my favorite\nstudies on BPD is one where they looked\nat facial expressions so what they did\nwhat researchers did is they took a\nfacial expression like this and then\nthey videotaped going from a smile to an\nangry face like this and then this right\nso if you actually take that clip and\nyou turn it into a hundred Stills what\nyou'll find is that there's a hundred\npercent happy and a hundred percent\nangry and most people if you look at the\nmiddle when I'm halfway between smiling\nand angry most people can't really tell\nwhat I'm feeling like if you take a\nnormal brain and you show them that\npicture of 50 happy 50 angry people will\nbe kind of confused what happens is I\nneed to get to 70 anger for a normal\nbrain to tell that I'm angry right so if\nI'm 50 angry like uh people can't really\ntell what I'm feeling once I hit 70\nanger then people can tell the\ninteresting thing is that for people\nwith BPD they can detect the anger at\nonly 30 anger so even when someone is 70\nsmiling and seventy percent happy the\nbrain of the person with BPD actually\ndetects anger in that situation so I\nwant you all to imagine what it's like\nto go through life when the people\naround you even if they're 70 happy if\nthey're only unhappy with you 30 if what\nyou detect there is that this person is\nunhappy with me imagine how life how\nhard it is to go through life when\nyou're doing 70 right but all you can\nsee is the 30 of unhappiness that people\nexperience so what we tend to see in\npeople with BPD is that they're very\nvery sensitive to the negative emotions\nof others they're very very empathic\nwhich once again fits in with this I\nidea of I don't know who I am so my\nsense of self is going to be determined\nby how other people treat me in order\nfor that to work I have to be very very\nempathic the challenge is that the kind\nof empathy that I have is biased it's\nbiased towards the negative so what I\ntend to see is the dissatisfaction the\nfear the disappointment the anger in all\nof my relationships and then what I\nstart to do is I start to react when\npeople are 70 happy even though they're\nstill happy I'm like oh my God this\nperson is upset with me and then I'll\nstart to ask them hey why are you mad at\nme the person's like I'm not mad at you\nI feel okay like I'm a little bit\nfrustrated but it's not that big of a\ndeal oh my God why are you frustrated\nwhat did I do wrong and then what\nthey'll sort of do is create these\nfrustrating Dynamics with the\nrelationships that they're in so now\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\nwhat do we understand about the\ndevelopment of BPD so we know that\nthere's a high correlation between\ntrauma and BPD but my favorite theory of\nthis actually comes from Marshall\nLinehan who is the developer of\nsomething called dialectical behavioral\ntherapy brilliant psychologist who if\nmemory serves correct they can could be\nwrong here but I I think she herself has\nBPD and kind of talks about that and so\nwhat what she sort of believes is that\nwe have in order to develop BPD what we\nneed is a neuroscientific vulnerability\nI.E a brain that is sensitive to\nnegative emotion\nplus an invalidating environment so you\ncan have a brain that's sensitive to\nnegative emotion but if you grow up in\nthe right environment what that sort of\nmeans is that you'll get enough\nemotional reassurance to where you'll\nlearn that like over time like when\nyou're four years old five years old\nthat even though I feel really angry my\nparents are there to kind of create a\nsafe space for me so I can kind of calm\ndown and I can develop some security I\ncan start to feel good about myself even\nthough I was feeling bad a little while\nago and on the flip side what we kind of\nsee is if you have that that\nneurological vulnerability to intense\nnegative emotions and you are in an\ninvalidating environment what that sort\nof does is like then when those negative\nemotions arise like they get Amplified\nand they don't get toned down by your\nenvironment so what this also means is\nthat if you have a neurotypical brain in\nan invalidating environment but if you\naren't neurologically sensitive to that\nnegative emotion even if the environment\nis somewhat invalidating it's not that\nbig of a deal because your brain is able\nto sort of like regulate its own\nemotions internally so this is why\nthere's a correlation with trauma but\nwhat we tend to see is that some people\nwith BPD don't grow up in necessarily\ntraumatic households some of them will\nreally grow up in invalidating\nenvironments and then you'll you'll have\nlike invalidating environments let's say\nyour mom is invalidating but you've got\nthree kids in the household and only one\nof them will grow up with BPD even\nthough they all have the same invaliding\nan environment when what's the reason\nfor that it's because the other two kids\nhave brains that are not sort of like\nhave an itchy trigger finger when it\ncomes to negative emotion so I I really\nlike this Theory I think it's very\nexplanatory where there's a neurological\nvulnerability plus an environmental\nFactor so a key thing that people sort\nof think about especially when we talk\nabout personality disorders is does this\nmean I'm screwed because this is a\npersonality disorder right you're\ntelling me Dr K that my brain is busted\nI have a small amygdala and like if I've\ngot a small amygdala and I don't know\nwho I am on the inside does that mean\nI'm essentially screwed because I engage\nin all these manipulative behaviors and\nI'm screwed I'm screwed I'm screwed I'm\nscrewed the answer is actually\nshockingly no actually BPD is I know it\nsounds kind of bizarre but actually has\none of the best prognoses of personality\ndisorders so the first thing to\nunderstand is that there are very good\ntreatments for BPD one of my favorite\ntreatments for BPD is something called\ndialectical behavioral therapy which is\nessentially cognitive behavioral therapy\nwhich with this mindfulness component\nadded to it so the mindfulness helps us\ndo things like regulate our emotions\nright gives us healthy alternative\ncoping strategies two things like\nsubstance use or cutting and then the\nother cool thing is like this Eastern\nyoga meditation stuff helps us discover\nwho we are as people and so in in my\nexperience of working with with BPD\npatients like they actually end up doing\nreally well because we sort of do this\nweird like yogic find yourself inner\nJourney thing and it actually works\nreally well so in terms of statistics\nthis is really shocking but if you take\npatients who are hospitalized due to\nBorderline Personality Disorder so these\nare people who are in such a crisis\nwhere they get hospitalized potentially\ninvoluntarily they get locked into a\npsychiatric ward two years after\nhospitalization 34 percent of them are\nin remission four years after\nhospitalization 49 of them are in\nremission six years after\nhospitalization 68 percent of them are\nin remission in a decade after\nhospitalization 86 percent are are in\nremission which is kind of Staggering\nright so what we're saying is that you\ncan be so sick that you get hospitalized\nand 10 years out if we take a thousand\npeople with BPD and we just measure them\n10 years out we're not really sure who\nengaged in what level of treatment by\nthe way but we just look at the\nstatistics the odds are that 860 out of\na thousand people will be in remission\nnow what does remission mean that means\nthat not having significant symptoms for\na two-year period okay only about six\npercent of people who are in remission\nwill have recurrences so are we kind of\ncatching people on a good day and that's\nwhy like these statistics are so good\nbut actually the prognosis for BPD is\nlike actually really really good and we\nhave very very good treatments for it\nthere's also a lot of evidence that\nshows that having stable relationships\ncan rapidly improve BPD so all you need\nheat is really like one person who's\nkind of a stable Source in your life to\nreally improve things so one study that\nI looked at suggested that there was\nsomewhere around a 50 remission rate at\ntwo years if you have a stable\nrelationship but remember that you don't\nnecessarily have to have a stable\nrelationship people find remission in\nall kinds of other ways and when people\nsort of wonder about that this is kind\nof my experience of it as a clinician is\nthat remember that the key thing here is\nthat you don't really know who you are\nright so you sort of Define yourself\nbased on how other people treat you if\nyou take people who are really confused\nabout their identity let's say a 21 year\nold who's been hospitalized if you look\nat the difference between a 21 year old\nand a 31 year old a lot has changed\nbetween a 21 year old and a 31 year old\nthe first thing that's happened is their\nbrain has fully matured and what we sort\nof know is that strong frontal lobe\ndevelopment mediates or reduces the\nsymptoms of BPD so just literally like\nyour brain maturing can reduce the\nsymptoms of BPD just aging so every year\nthat goes by like your could be better\nfor you the other thing that 10 tends to\nhappen is we don't really know who we\nare at the age of 21 and by the age of\n31 a lot of us have it more figured out\nright we sort of have figured out a\nlittle bit more about who we are and so\nas we sort of develop the sense of\nidentity over time as we sort of\ndiscover who we are hopefully we can\nfind some good supportive relationships\nhopefully our brain develops a little\nbit hopefully we learn how to regulate\nour emotions hopefully we actually\nengage in treatment like dialectical\nbehavioral therapy or learn mindfulness\nor meditation as we kind of do all those\nthings BPD can actually get better so\nborderline personality disorder is one\nof the most misunderstood diagnoses out\nthere I think it gets a really really\nreally bad rap especially because if you\nknow people who have BPD it can be\nreally hard to engage in relationships\nwith them whether they be family\nrelationships platonic relationships you\nknow all kinds of stuff this can be hard\nbut the good news is that with the right\nkind of treatment and even maybe just\ngetting older a lot of this stuff kind\nof resolves on its own we're not really\nsure about too much there but we do know\nthat the prognosis is actually pretty\ngood so if you have BPD if you suspect\nthat you have BPD I strongly encourage\nyou to get evaluated get treatment and\nmost importantly don't lose hope"
