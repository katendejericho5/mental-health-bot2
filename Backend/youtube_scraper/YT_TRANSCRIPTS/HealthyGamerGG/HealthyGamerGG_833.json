    "transcript": "and so I think the key thing that I\nreally heard from you is that by\nspending some time actually like\njournaling and understanding your\nfeelings you were then able to\ncommunicate things to the chef that\nallowed them to respond to you in kind\nof a positive way helped you kind of\nfeel better and it sounds like things\nare actually a little bit better at work\nto hold on let me adjust your audio for\na second\num just because you sound a little bit\nquiet\nhey can you count to ten for me\nyes one two three four five six seven\neight perfect\nand um welcome what do you go by my\nfriend\nuh I go by uh uh mangastin mangastin\num\nyes okay and mangastin what's what's the\nemotion that you struggle with the most\nuh it's a plethora of emotions I would\nsay okay it can range from anything\nlike anger sadness\nof Happiness sometimes I guess you\nstruggle with happiness\nI mean uh not that I struggle but uh it\ncan be really intense uh but that's\nmostly when I'm having that difficulty\nwhen uh I'm having like anger or sadness\nbecause it can be prolonged throughout\nthe day\nand uh yeah\ninteresting so can you tell me a little\nbit about uh you know when you say you\nkind of\nstruggle with these emotions what is\nthat what does that mean struggle to you\nI mean that uh if\nthe like the feeling overwhelms me like\nI can't shake it off it it keeps dying\nfor like two hours well it depends\nsometimes but it usually kind of stays\nfor long\nand\nwhat's that been like for you to have\nemotions that feel so I'm kind of\nhearing that\nit's not a particular emotion but that\nemotions feel pretty overwhelming for\nyou at times\nyes that is correct and how long has\nthat been going on\noh well\n[Music]\nI\nwas really sure I would say it's been\ngoing on for\nsince I was young\nyeah definitely\nand what's that like to have\noverwhelming emotions\nuh\nwell\nI think the the thing that annoys me the\nmost is like it can uh\nyou can\ninfluence my judgment a bit too much uh\nlike I I can't think clearly let's say\nlike\nuh I'm just completely overwhelmed\nsometimes by by the feelings\ncan you was there something in\nparticular that you wanted to talk about\ntoday\nuh not something in particular uh no so\nthen can I ask you just a couple of\nquestions about\num some of the stuff that you've shared\nso far like you say that your emotions\ninterfere with your judgment is it okay\nif we talk about that\nyeah and so when you say they interfere\nwith your judgment what do you mean like\ncan you give me an example or tell me a\nstory yes yes I can yes uh so like\nyesterday when I was at work\num\nI was uh three or four months ago my\nboss told me that you know I could uh I\ncan raise your pay\nand then you know I waited uh I saw that\nit doesn't happen so I was like okay\nmaybe I should ask see what's going on\nuh and like the head chef I work with he\ntold me well it's because you're not\nperforming well enough\nokay that's fair uh but uh I would have\nliked to be told that no we not asked\nthat hey I can't really raise your pay\nbecause\nno you're not performing well enough\nwhere uh it's just like if I didn't ask\nI just would have I wouldn't have been\ntold this\nand uh it kind of pissed me off in a way\nuh I\num\nalso the the fact that I wasn't because\nI know why I'm not performing well\nenough I'm not performing well enough\nbecause\num I have a hard time focusing just my\nmind just wanders\nit's really\nit's kind of frustrating sometimes I\nwould say\nand\nuh I guess I was angrier more on the\nfact that I can't focus other than the\nfact that hey I didn't get my you know\nmy race\nhmm\nso and and how did that did something I\ndon't I'm not hearing anything about\nimpaired judgment there\nso what just let yes yes uh so uh in my\nmind uh I was like\nI could uh\nI was thinking you know irrational about\nit but off of me was like I was so angry\nlike I just wanted to like yell at\nsomebody or something and it just kept\ngoing on in my head for like\nsix hours or some something it it was it\ntook me really a long time to come off\nlike the head chef came to me and hey\nyou know why what's up with you and I\nwas like you know this is uh pissing me\noff and then you know I kind of calmed\ndown after did you tell him this is this\nis pissing me off\nyeah yeah because uh usually when\nsomebody asked me if I you know I have a\nfeeling of how I'm doing I would say\nlike I'm fine just like a default\nresponse\nand I I struggle really hard to actually\nbe be honest and say what's actually\nbothering me and then maybe because I I\ndon't say it I like I have a hard time\nmaking like a genuine connection with\npeople\num\nyeah and what what makes it so what\nhappened when you told the head chef\nthat you were upset about what they were\ntelling you\noh well kinda told me about his\nexperience he was really nice about it\nhe was like you know this happened to me\nI wasn't the fastest when I started out\nuh you know if\nsomething policy you can tell me you\nknow you're like friends here you know\nyou can consider me don't consider me\nlike a strict boss or uh yeah don't\nconsider me like the boss you know I'm\nkind of like your friend here you know\nso take it like that and I I understand\nthat it's just really hard to\nuh\nbe honest when uh you know when\nsomething is bothering me it's like I\ndon't wanna\nupset people or I don't wanna bother\nthem with my problems oh I think I think\nthat's the main reason so that's why I\ndon't express it okay\nso let me so how did you when when the\nchef was like Hey I want you to tell me\nabout this kind of stuff we're kind of\nlike friends here\nhow did you feel after that\nI felt a bit more relief\nI was still a bit upset about it but it\nwas a bit better though it was really\nhard for me to like actually say uh\nI could yeah if I didn't do the fields\nthing where where you know I I open I\nwrite my feelings I don't think I would\nhave been able I'll just give give him a\nreason but not the exact reason why why\nI'm upset okay well I think a lot\nokay now you're saying so uh mangastin\nyou're saying I felt a bit better\nI still feel felt a bit angry\nso I'm trying to understand when you say\na bit and it took you a little while to\ncalm down\nso\nI'm gonna I'm gonna kinda\nask about that\nbecause in my mind if you feel a bit\nbetter\nyou shouldn't still feel a bit angry if\nyou feel a bit better you should feel\nvery angry\nright so so you're using the words a bit\nin a little\nin a way that sound kind of confusing to\nme I mean maybe maybe I'm not saying\nthat your feelings are wrong it's just\nare are you do you think you're using\nthe right words there or is that kind of\nan automatic response\num\nwell I can't say I felt a lot better\nafter telling him what's bothering me I\nI did feel\nall right a bit better quite a bit\nbetter\nyeah quite a bit better but in a way I\nwas still upset about it though I don't\nthink I was it was constantly bothering\nme in my mind as much okay\nand and so\nand it sounds like you have trouble\ncommunicating your feelings to people\nbecause you're afraid of burdening them\nit end up also like um\nuh I have a hard time communicating them\nif there's like a group of people I I\ndon't think I can do it like if it's\none-on-one yeah maybe maybe I can but if\nit's like a group of people like I can\nso were you concerned about burdening\nthe chef this time when you shared your\nfeelings\nuh I don't think so I I was was just uh\num\nI it was just hard for me to express\nthem okay that that was my obstacle so\nmangaston let me ask you a question when\nyou feel worried about burdening people\nhow much of that thinking is\nif I can't communicate my emotions like\nI'm gonna give them useless information\nthat it's then going to be like their\nresponsibility to kind of figure it out\nand that's not really fair to them I\nshould be able to communicate better\nuh I'm I'm excited what was the yeah\nsorry that was a terrible question so so\nsometimes when we feel like burdening\npeople\nor sorry when we feel like I don't want\nto burden you\nbut part of that burden is that if I\ncan't communicate clearly\nit's hard for other people to like\nunderstand and figure out what I'm\ntrying to say\nand and that's a burden right\nuh is it like a button for them I think\nyeah like do you feel like you're\nburdening you're they have to figure out\nhow you're feeling\nyeah if I look from their perspective\nit's quite uh quite confusing okay\nso do you think that you handled the\nsituation well\n[Music]\nin the beginning maybe I should have\nbeen honest about it and not be upset\nabout it or you know an extended period\nof time well what do you think helped\nyou become less upset\n[Music]\num\nexpressing it\nokay\nand how does that work\nwhat do you think how does that help you\nfeel better\nuh\n[Music]\nexpressing my my emotions uh and being\nhonest I guess I think\nI think being honest around around the\nyou know the people around me maybe\nis that what was it like to share the\nway that you felt\nwere you afraid of how the chef was\ngoing to respond\nno I I was more I was\n[Music]\nit uh\nI found it really difficult to say it\nlike my mind in a way maybe wanted to\nsay\nsomething that's uh that may be related\nbut it's not the exact issue\nokay\num\nand and\nbut but you it sounds like whatever you\nsaid was well received\neven if you didn't get it 100 right\nyes so uh in this particular case I\nthink I I was completely honest okay and\nand what and you said something about\nyou you you did some activity before you\ntalked to this person\noh uh yeah I was just working in the\nkitchen alongside him but did you I\nthought you said something like you you\ntried something about journaling your\nfeelings or something\noh yeah yeah uh I meant that um\nthe things you guys posted a few days\nago with the writing the fields and uh\nyou know journaling my feelings there\nand uh I thought I should apply this in\nmy\nyou know in my day-to-day so I decided\nthat hey I should I should express my\nfeelings in front of him okay so\nmangastin is it okay if I just like try\nto summarize what I heard from you and I\nthink a couple of takeaway points from\npeople who are listening\nand then if you have any anything you\nwant to add or ask questions we can do\nthat\nokay so the first thing is that\nsometimes we experience a lot of emotion\nand the emotion can feel very very\noverwhelming\nand especially when emotions feel very\noverwhelming they can be very hard to\ndescribe\nor communicate or even understand\nand you've seen that when you get\noverwhelmed by your emotions that it\nstarts to impair your judgment\nand when it impairs your judgment you\nstart to like maybe make mistakes\nand then you kind of don't know how to\ncommunicate you don't really know how to\nreach out for help and so it's almost\nlike the emotions Bounce Around inside\nyou for a very long time\nright and so for hours you'll be upset\nand you're afraid I mean maybe afraid is\nthe wrong word but you're hesitant to\nshare these kinds of things with other\npeople because you kind of don't want to\nburden them and it's so confusing in\nhere like how are you like how is how\ncan someone even help with that\ndoes that make sense\nlike if you don't really know like if I\ncome up to you among us then and I say\nhey I'm upset and you're like what are\nyou upset about I don't know all kinds\nof stuff\nand then it's like how are you supposed\nto help me with that\nthat's actually my responsible right and\nlike you're like I I'm I don't even know\nhow to ask people for help because like\nhow like how are they supposed to help\nwith this mess of emotions that even I\ndon't understand and then if they ask me\nquestions like I'm not going to know how\nto answer them like what upsets you I\ndon't know all kinds of crap\nright\nso that's really common\nthe other thing but but I think this is\nreally important that what you sort of\ndiscovered is that\nvocalizing your emotions especially and\nthis is kind of like I think really you\nshould give yourself a pat on the back\nuh because\nyou're in a situation where you have a\nsuperior and you're angry about\nsomething that they told you and usually\nin that kind of situation\npeople are even less they don't want to\ntalk to their Superior because I'm not\nit's kind of like there's a power\nDynamic there right where if the\nsuperior tells me something I'm not\nallowed to be upset at that because\nthey're the boss and I have to listen to\nthem\nbut you are able to communicate how you\nwere frustrated\nand something really cool happened which\nis that that the the chef was like\nactually supportive of you and even\nthough you were bringing a negative\nemotion\nto this person\nthey didn't get upset with you for\nbringing in negative emotion they heard\nwhat you had to say and actually like\nencouraged you to treat them like a\nfriend\nand told you that you know gave you some\nwords of encouragement\nwhich is like pretty awesome because I\nthink a lot of times when we have\nnegative emotions we're very scared to\nshare them\neven with our friends and especially\nwith like in work situations where we\ndon't want to tell the boss that we're\nangry\nand I think the key thing that I'm sort\nof hearing from you is that you spent\nsome time actually writing out your\nfeelings which helped you understand\nthem\nand I suspect this is where I'm going to\nkind of make some assumptions that\nyou know when when you kind of feel\nguilty for\ntalking to people about your emotions\nand burdening them I think part of the\nreason you feel that way is because\npeople haven't been able to help you in\nthe past\nor they haven't responded well is that\ntrue\nit is so can you tell me a story about\nthat like a time where you tried to\nshare something with someone and what\nhappened\nyeah actually\num and now not that I remember\num I wanted like a few years ago to\nstart drawing\nand uh I was I Pro I procrastinate a lot\nand uh I just I don't even know maybe\nback then I don't know where to start\nand uh\nI was kind of like stressed about it\nbecause you know I I really want to do\nit but I was not sure where to start so\nI guess I just talked with some people\nonline\nand uh I don't remember the exact\nconversation but somebody like all of me\nto you know go upstairs psychiatrist\nand at that time I was like I'm having\nthis issue but\nI already have to like seek a seek out\nprofessional help for for this small of\na problem and like they felt like I\ndon't know they seemed like they're\noverwhelmed by by me yeah so if they\nsaid\ngo see a psychiatrist it makes you feel\nlike this problem is like too big for\nthem to handle right\nuh up I felt like it wasn't that big of\na problem uh it's just their response\nfelt like it had no empathy yeah\nso so I and yeah keep going\nyeah I just had to say like like really\nhit me like a hammer\num so so it sounds like in the past the\nway that you've communicated has\nresulted in people not responding in a\npositive way\nyeah yeah I I I'm having a hard time\nremembering remembering exact moments\nbut I do feel like this this is a\nconcrete one that did happen maybe more\nhappened but I'm not remembering them\nyeah that that's okay so I I think that\nthis is what I'd kind of say so I think\nthe key takeaway that when I listen to\nyou is\nso the first thing is that emotions can\nBounce Around inside you and be really\noverwhelming and affect you for a very\nlong period of time\nunless you deal with them in some way so\nsometimes we deal with them by like\nunhealthy coping mechanisms like playing\nvideo games or using drugs\nthere are we can also do healthy things\nlike maybe exercise or meditate or or\njournal or whatever but a really\nimportant thing that we can do is talk\nto other people about our emotions and\nwhen we talk to them it can help us feel\nbetter but the other cool thing is that\nwe can actually improve our\nrelationships either at work or\nlike friendships or romantic\nRelationships by vocalizing our feelings\nthe challenge is that most of us are not\ntaught\nhow to vocalize our feelings how to\nunderstand our feelings so since we're\nnot taught that when we try to\ncommunicate our feelings to other people\nthey respond in ways that are kind of\nhurtful and we kind of feel like\nyou know this this isn't really working\nI'm burdening other people it's not\nhelping at all\nand so I think the key thing that I\nreally heard from you is that by\nspending some time actually like\njournaling and understanding your\nfeelings you were then able to\ncommunicate things to the chef\nthat\nallowed them to respond to you in kind\nof a positive way helped you kind of\nfeel better and it sounds like things\nare actually a little bit better at work\nyes\nso I think that's fantastic dude I think\nthat's like that's like literally why we\ndo all this stuff is is to yeah\nI'm sorry no go ahead\nyeah I was really happy when when I saw\nthat video and like I listened to it\ntwice I just thought of\nuh expressing my feelings or journaling\nthem it was so enticing yeah I I really\nwant yeah a fantastic dude so so you\nknow what I would recommend to you is\num\nis just keep doing that so like this is\nwhat we kind of find is I know it sounds\nkind of weird but even problems like\nprocrastination\ncan be due to or influenced by\ninability to regulate our emotions\nso like when we're procrastinating like\nwe we want to do something but we're not\nreally able to do it\nand sometimes like what we use to\nprocrastinate so let's say I\nprocrastinate by watching YouTube or\ntwitch\nand when I procrastinate what that\nactually does when I watch YouTube or\ntwitch what it actually does is destroys\nmy motivation but soothes my emotions\nbecause when you watch like stuff on the\ninternet and like look at memes and\nstuff you kind of get some dopamine you\nkind of like stop you forget about all\nthe problems in your life and stuff like\nthat but the problem is it destroys your\nmotivation so in order to cope with our\nnegative emotions we sacrifice our\nmotivation\nand what that looks like is\nprocrastination\nand so I I'd strongly encourage you to\nkeep on understanding your emotions I\ndon't think it's a bad idea for you to\nget a clinical evaluation by the way\nbecause some of the stuff that you know\nthere's a there's a new subtype of ADHD\nthat people are thinking about it's not\nofficial yet but some people have\nhypothesized\nthat there's an emotional dysregulation\nsome type of ADHD now I have no idea\nwhether you have ADHD or not we're you\nknow it's not really my job to do a\ndiagnostic evaluation on you but you you\nmentioned that you have difficulty with\nFocus\nand that you feel a lot of really\nintense emotions and sometimes people\nwith ADHD can experience both of those\nthings so it's not a bad idea to to get\nchecked out for something like that\nokay\nhow does it feel if I say something like\nthat\nuh\nit's all right\nI I I think that everything else I I'm\nnot like I said I can't say if you have\nADHD or not but I think everything else\nstill applies and that's really the\nstuff that I feel confident about which\nis that the more you understand your\nemotions the more your communication\nwill improve the more your communication\nimproves the more your relationships\nwill improve and you even said that\nsometimes it's hard to connect with\nother people because you can't show them\nor or vocalize your emotions so what\nthey kind of get is like\nalmost like a\nrobotic or or blurry version\nof mangustin\nright\nlike they don't get to see the real you\nit's all blurry because you don't know\nhow to communicate like what you're\nfeeling and stuff and then it's hard to\nform connection so I think if you just\nkeep doing what you're doing like I I'm\noptimistic for you\nany uh comments or questions before we\nwrap up\num\noh\nI was wondering like\nwould it be that\n[Music]\num\nmy my difficulty of focusing on\nsomething uh be related to not uh\nexpressing my feelings or like as they\nbuild up a lot because it's really easy\nto like play back you know watch read\nsome memes and forget about troubles but\nwhen you gotta focus on something with\nyour mind to be there in the present\nlike those like those problems can come\nup back to you\nuh yeah what do you think\ndo you think your focus has to do with\na lot of emotion on the difficulty with\nFocus has a lot to do with with emotions\non the inside\nyeah definitely okay so if you're the\nanswer to your question if you think\nit's definitely I completely agree\nI I think you you're looking for\nconfirmation I'm happy to provide I\nthink I think it's really important to\nremember that if we just think about it\nright when we're angry\nit's very hard to focus on things that\nwe're not angry about or like anger\ncauses hyper Focus but we lose control\nof it\nso there's even evidence that shows that\nwhen we have do you know adrenaline is\nyeah so when we we normally have\nif you look at our field of vision which\nis what we can see\nwe can kind of see 180 degrees\naround us\nso like even if you have if you wave\nYour Arms by your the sides of your head\nyou can kind of see them moving with\nyour eyes but when we have adrenaline\ngoing through our body\nwe can't see stuff on the side all we\ncan see is a 30 degree window in front\nof us\nso we become hyper focused in One\nDirection when we have adrenaline\nwhen we feel angry we tend to release\nadrenaline and the same thing happens\nwith our thoughts\nour thoughts become very very obsessive\non one area when we feel angry and we\ncan't think about other things\nthat's the experience of anger\nand so if you have difficulty focusing\nemotions have a lot to do with that and\nusually a tranquil mind can focus the\nbest so I I think I completely agree\nwith what you're saying which is\nemotions can absolutely interfere with\nFocus\nand that's also one of the reasons why\nwe see in that sub this new potential\nsubtype of ADHD an impairment of focus\nthat is coupled with emotional\ndysregulation\nI want to say that\nI hope I'm saying it correctly the SRI\nLantra at the focusing exercise the one\nwith the lotuses\nI I I I I did it I did it for like a few\nweeks and I I could like build the\nImprovement in my folks like I was more\nmore called great or more uh yeah that's\nwhy we teach it\nI mean guess then it sounds like you're\ndoing a lot of stuff right dude\nyou just keep walking your journey man\nthank you I will take care my friend\nif you found this video helpful check\nout Dr K's guide we've spent hundreds of\nhours writing and filming to help people\nunderstand their mind so that they can\nbuild the lives that they want so check\nout the link in the description below\nforeign"
