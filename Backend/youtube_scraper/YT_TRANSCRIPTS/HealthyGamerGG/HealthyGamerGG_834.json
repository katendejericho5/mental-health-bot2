    "transcript": "so we have this event going on right now\nwhere we're helping our community track\ntheir emotions so here's all the\nemotions that people are feeling what's\nthe number one emotion that people are\nfeeling turns out it's tired now that\nmay sound kind of weird to you because\nis being tired and emotion to begin with\nright I thought like being tired was\nlike a state of energy like isn't tired\nlike a lack of sleep so is it like\nphysiologic like is it mental can you\nfeel mentally tired or is tiredness just\nkind of a physical perspective what\nabout people who you know are not\ndepressed or anything like that aren't\nburnt out and sort of take care of\nthemselves exercise but they just kind\nof like when they wake up in the morning\nthey kind of feel they feel like life\nhas no zest there's no excitement is\nthat depression like what is that so\nwhat I'd love to do is talk to you all\ntoday about tiredness and what we're\ngoing to do is approach tiredness from a\ncouple of different angles so we're\ngoing to start by talking about the\ntiredness as an emotion so is it an\nemotion and what does that even mean\nlike how is tiredness and emotion and\nsort of related to that the mental\naspect of being tired because I know it\nsounds kind of weird but if you really\nthink about it human beings all have the\nshared experience of being able to be\nfought to be tired right so like we can\nall feel tired and if we all can feel\ntired tiredness must serve a particular\nfunction and if we really want to\nunderstand how to overcome tiredness\nwhat we need to do is understand why we\nfeel tired in the first place not in a\nsense to to fix it but what is the\nfunction of feeling tired which I know\nit sounds kind of weird but we think\nabout tiredness especially in today's\nsociety is purely a negative thing to\nget rid of right energy is good\ntiredness is bad but we never stop to\nreally think about hold on a second like\nhuman bodies and brains and subjective\nexperiences exist for a reason there\naren't good emotions and bad emotions\nthere are just emotions and emotions are\njust information right so even something\nlike fear or anxiety is your brain's way\nof telling you to be worried about\nsomething so then the question kind of\nbecomes okay like what is tiredness for\nlike why do we feel tired and the cool\nthing is once we start to understand\nthat we can start to see scenarios in\nwhich we feel tired and then we'll\nunderstand why we feel tired in those\nscenarios and where it's really coming\nfrom and once we discover where where\nit's coming from we can start to take\nsteps to combat it overcome it or even\nsort of accept it as information so\nfirst thing that I'm going to share with\nyou all is a story okay so I was working\nwith a patient who hated going back home\nfor the holidays so really like was like\nenjoyed having time off from work but\nreally really hated going back home for\nthe holidays the holidays were just so\nexhausting and it's not just being there\nso this patient was telling me she was\ntelling me one day that you know she got\na phone call and on the phone like she\nshe picks up her phone she looks at it\nand she sees oh it's in my Mom calling\nand just the sight of her Mom calling\nwas enough to feel exhausted she's like\noh my God\nI can't deal with this and so let's like\nstop and think about that so first of\nall you may find that that's your\nexperience as well that you feel tired\nbut you can feel so tired suddenly which\nis kind of weird right because if we\nthink about tiredness we think about it\nas a lack of energy and if I've slept a\nfull eight hours and I ate a nice you\nknow keto low carb meal I shouldn't feel\ntired that's what we tell ourselves\nright I shouldn't feel tired because we\nthink about tiredness as a physiologic\nstate we don't think about it as an\nemotion and then what we end up doing is\nwe try doing all kinds of physical\nthings let me try the supplement let me\ngo get some vitamin D let me go do this\nthing I'm going to cut out gluten from\nmy diet because we cannot have the\ngluten\nright all kinds of stuff that we do\nphysiologically because tiredness is a\nstate of energy and yet we continue\nfeeling tired and sometimes we even feel\ngood about ourselves until you see the\nPing oh it's your boss emailing you\nagain at four o'clock on us on a Friday\nand then how do you feel you feel tired\nso let's try to understand what\ntiredness is and why we feel tired so\nlet's go through this so if I see a\nphone call from let's say a parent that\nI don't want to talk to or someone who's\nlooking for money or soliciting\ndonations I don't know if you all felt\nthis way I feel this way where I'm\nwalking down the street and sometimes\nyou see those people with the binders\nyou know what I'm talking about those\npeople the binders and a good cause and\nthey look at you and they like try to\nmake eye contact and then they like wave\nright and then you're like oh my God and\nthen you feel tired I don't want to talk\nto this person I don't want to be rude\nwith this person I know if I talk to\nthem they're going to ask me questions\nthat are going to make me feel guilty so\nnow I have a choice between losing some\nmoney or feeling bad about myself\nbecause I'm not making the world a\nbetter place and all this kind of stuff\ngoes on in your head in the span of like\nthree seconds and you feel exhausted so\nwhat's going on there right how does\nthat work so tiredness is actually an\nAdaptive mechanism created by your brain\nto help you avoid kind of useless work\nokay I know it sounds kind of weird but\nhere's what happens so like let's let's\ntalk about something like paying your\ntaxes so here's where I am right now and\nI gotta pay my taxes in the workload\nfrom paying my taxes is so high that my\nbrain looks at that and says there's no\nway we're going to be able to pay our\ntaxes today we can't do it the estimate\nof the workload is very very high and\nthen what it does is it makes us feel\ntired so tiredness is our brain's\nresponse to a perception of a high\nworkload so when we see a super high\nworkload what we naturally feel is tired\nand you may say to yourself but hold on\nDr k\nisn't that when you should have a burst\nof energy shouldn't we if the task is\nreally big shouldn't I need a ton of\nenergy so that I can complete the task\nand I want to work on my taxes for 24\nhours and then tomorrow I will be done\nwith my taxes it'll be great it'll be\nliberating but instead what you do is\nyou feel tired so let's think about the\nsituation which our brain evolved when\nthere are things that have a ton of work\nour brain sort of calculates okay this\nis going to be a ton of work and it may\nnot even succeed so generally speaking\nthe more work that something requires\nthe chances of success are going to be\nlower so if I wake up today and I say\nokay like I'm going to become president\nof the United States or Secretary\nGeneral of the UN that takes a ton of\nwork the likelihood of that succeeding\nis going to be low I'm going to start a\nbillion dollar company I'm going to\nstart a company that's going to use\nteleportation technology and invent time\ntravel technology the amount of effort\nrequired for that is going to be very\nhigh and generally speaking if we look\nat what the greater effort is required\nfor something the lower the chances are\nfor success and so then how does our\nbrain prevent us from wasting energy on\nlow success probability things that\nrequire a high amount of energy\ninvestment it makes us feel tired\nbecause what is tired tired is don't do\nit don't bother don't try stop I'm not\ngoing to give you the energy I'm not\nwilling to invest this amount of energy\nfor such a rare difficult thing now this\nbrain evolved prior to the development\nof taxes right so now what we're sort of\nseeing is that this fundamental\nmechanism which is like our brains\nevolved and they're like oh let's go\nclimb to the top of that mountain and\nyou look to the top of the mountain\nyou're like oh my God that's like so\nmuch climbing no way dude I'm tired so\nif you really think about it what does\ntiredness do it discourages you from\ninvesting energy in like really really\nlong-term questionable kind of things\nand now the problem is that we live in a\nsociety where we've got stuff like\npaying taxes which absolutely have to be\ndone but our brain doesn't know how to\ncalculate paying taxes it doesn't know\nhow to say okay we're gonna have to put\nin four hours a day for the next 10 days\nand then we'll be done it's not actually\nhow long it takes to pay your taxes\nright but if you think about how long\ndoes it feel like it feels like it's\ngoing to take a really really really\nlong time and then even at the end of\nfour hours of paying your taxes today\nare you going to be done with it is it\ngoing to be finished other examples of\nthis include writing a dissertation I\ngotta write my dissertation today you\ncan't write your dissertation day it\ntakes a year oh my God that's so much\nwork I'm so exhausted I can't even do\nanything today so when our brain\nestimates that there's a very very high\nworkload with unclear chances of success\nor progress that's visible it protects\nus from wasting energy into that thing\nthere's no point if we're going to try\nto climb to the top of Mount Everest\nthere's no point in climbing the first\nfive thousand feet if we're not going to\nmake it to the top you know because it's\nlike okay like let's say Everest is what\ntwenty six thousand feet or 29 000 feet\nor something like that right what's the\npoint of going up 25 000 feet turning or\nturning around and coming back there's\nno point you didn't climb Everest I went\nto go climb Mount Everest everyone asks\nyou what was it like at the top and\nyou're like I don't know I turned back\nright there's you might as well not have\ngone and so that's how our brain\noperates it looks at this really far\ngoal in the future and it's like hey\nlet's not waste our time in this boom\nlet's flip the tired switch and so\nfeeling tired is actually an energy\nconservation strategy it's a way to\nshape our Behavior it's a way that our\nbrain is making calculations and then\nusing emotions to keep us from making\nmistakes the same way that it uses\nanxiety to keep us from making mistakes\nthe same way that it uses anger to help\nus lay our boundaries and not get taken\nadvantage of by other people it uses\ntiredness to keep us from wasting our\nenergy now the problem is that\noftentimes we need to invest that energy\nright like it's actually worthwhile so\nif y'all want to understand tiredness\nwhat I encourage you to do is start by\nnoticing in your mind what is the\nscenario in which I'm tired because it's\nsudden right it's like you see that like\noh my God I don't want to go home for\nthe holidays my parents are divorced I\nhate Christmas with divorced parents\nbecause no matter what I do neither of\nmy parents is going to be happy right\none of them gets me on Christmas Eve and\none of them gets me on Christmas Day and\nat 11 59 pm on Christmas Day I know I'm\ngonna hear the car come up parents is\ngoing to come and they're going to want\nme for the rest of the day and so I've\nspent one night with one parent and that\nwas like sort of fun but I knew that\nthis was gonna happen the next day so I\ncan't really relax and then as I walk\nout the door one parent is going to be\ntearing up and the other parent is going\nto be like resentful and needy like come\non let's go we're gonna have so much fun\ntoday we gotta make up for all the fun\nthat we didn't have yesterday let's go\nhave fun let's do it man and the thought\nof going home for the holidays just the\nthought of it of being in that situation\nis exhausting the thought of going home\nfor the holidays and telling everyone\neveryone's like ah little Outlook how\nare you doing today my love what are you\nup to nowadays oh nothing auntie I'm\nstill applying to medical school I'm 26\nyears old I have no money I have no\nprospects failed a lot of classes and\nI'm not really doing much how are you\num\nyour son just got a job at Google\nfantastic you must be so proud so\ntiredness is actually an emotion and\nthat may sound kind of weird but\nremember that emotions are not\npsychological things they're physiologic\nthings too our body and our brain are\nconnected our mind and body are\nconnected so the experience of emotion\nlumps in the throat butterflies in the\nstomach tightness in our chest\nerection of the penis is an emotion\narousal lust you bet your ass that lust\nhas physiologic correlations right\nthat's an emotion and so similarly if\nemotions are both physiologic and\npsychological and we experience a lot of\ntiredness in our body why do we assume\nthat that's physiologic exclusively\nphysiologic in nature why can't it be\npsychological too because tiredness is\nan emotion we even use the right\nlanguage you say I feel tired it's a\nfeeling and it's our body's natural or\nMinds natural response to tasks that we\nfeel are very very difficult to\naccomplish and so we say don't even\nbother like like don't do the taxes\ntoday you can do them tomorrow start the\ndissertation tomorrow you don't answer\nthe phone call today right and then what\nhappens when you don't answer the phone\ncall by the way what's going to happen\n10 minutes from now what's going to\nhappen tomorrow what's going to happen a\nweek from now what's going to happen a\nmonth from now the phone calls keep\ncoming and they keep coming and they\nkeep coming and eventually maybe they'll\nstop but even if they stop you still\nfeel exhausted and that doesn't make any\nsense from an energy perspective because\nyou didn't even do anything you didn't\neven talk to anyone you just hit the\nphone on silent and continued unpaused\nyour video game and kept playing how is\nthat exhausting there's no amount of\nenergy like it's I click buttons all the\ntime it doesn't Tire me out so of course\ntiredness is an emotion of course it's\nmental in nature so the next time you\nfeel tired think a little bit about like\nokay what about this is exhausting\nbecause it ain't the energy it's not the\ncaloric burning that my body has to do\nin order to turn the phone on silent\nright it's not the the calories I have\nto burn to listen to my aunt tell me\nabout how their kid is so amazing like\nI'm just sitting there I can listen to\ncrap all the time it doesn't exhaust me\nin fact sometimes I rather enjoy it have\nyou heard of an audiobook so it's not\nenergetic it's all emotional and so then\nthe question becomes okay like like how\ndo we understand this so like ask\nyourself right pause and notice oh wow\nI'm feeling incredibly exhausted what is\nmy body telling me not to do then the\nquestion becomes why is my body telling\nme not to do it and that's where the\nanswer lies to notice first of all\nthere's nothing wrong with you right you\nmay be totally fine physiologically but\nthat this is a signal just like all\nother emotions emotions are information\nfrom the body and the mind to you and\nthen as you start to add okay this is a\nsignal like this is my body telling me\nnot to do this I feel so tired oh my God\nthis person wants to go out on a date\nagain this is the fifth date I'm just\nkind of tired tonight that's your body\nkind of telling you hey we're not that\ninto them right it's a waste of energy\nthat's what tiredness is tiredness is a\nsignal that there's a part of you that\nfeels like this is is a waste of energy\nsince it's a waste of energy we're not\ngoing to waste it we're going to help\nyou feel tired that way we don't have to\nexpend anything and as you ask yourself\nokay what am I why is this does this\nfeel like a waste of energy to me what\ndoes this encounter what will this\nencounter actually do how will I feel if\nI were to do the tired thing or the\nthing that makes me feel tired how would\nI feel at the end of it and now here's\nwhere something magical happens you get\nto really get underneath the tiredness\nbecause your mind will tell you one of\ntwo things if I spent two hours working\non my taxes today how would I feel at\nthe end of that if you stop and you\nactually ask yourself you say actually\nI'd feel pretty good or your mind may\nsay oh we'd still feel terrible because\nwe have so much left to do even if you\ndo two hours of work there's so much\nleft to do therefore logically don't\nstart at all right because that's what\nour mind tells us just ask yourself if I\nstarted on my dissertation today if I\nread one chapter of one thing how would\nI respond and my mind would be like oh\nyou read like one chapter of like 100\nyou have so much left to do so let's not\neven start because we have 100 chapters\nthree don't even bother reading the\nfirst one and it's like what and if your\nmind is telling you that how the hell\nare you ever going to do anything so\nthat's when you start to really realize\nokay hold on a second how is my mind\nmaking this calculation and as you start\nto really understand oh actually if I\nwent like give you all another example\nI'm going exercising so if I exercise\nhow am I going to feel at the end of it\nam I going to feel good or am I not\ngoing to feel good because a lot of\ntimes the things that we feel tired\ndoing we actually feel really good when\nwe're done doing them it's like hey I\nmade some progress today awesome I\nexercise today awesome and if our brain\nis telling us hey like you're gonna feel\nworse after making progress then that's\nthe problem that's when we need to start\nto think a little bit about wait wait\nhold on a second how am I arriving at\nthe conclusion that I'm gonna feel worse\nafter I do something that I should be\ndoing and that I need to be doing how am\nI feeling worse and then you tunnel down\ninto that and as you tunnel down into\nthat you can make a discovery holy crap\nmy brain is actually disincentivizing me\nto make making progress in life no\nwonder I'm stuck and if you do a good\njob what something magical will happen\nwhich is that remember we said that the\ntiredness is a feeling that the brain\nevokes when it estimates the amount of\nwork that you have to do and it\nestimates that since we're not going to\nget there there's no point in trying\nit's an energy conservation strategy but\nas you start to really understand okay\nif I do this I'm actually going to feel\ngood as you start to take that end point\nand you start to like really be more\nmore critical of it what you'll start to\nrealize is that your brain actually\nrealizes okay hold on a second maybe\nthis isn't such a waste of energy and\nnow we also see why certain productivity\ntechniques work which is taking a large\nabstract task and chunking it into\npieces because if I have a hundred\nchapters to read that's a lot of\nchapters but if my Target today is one I\nhave completed my target then it's not a\nwaste of energy reading chapter one\nchapter lets me finish one chapter\nthat's actually a pretty good trade and\nthen suddenly we feel less tired in\nterms of like relationship stuff it's\nalso really really really important to\nunderstand this kind of thing right so\nwhen it comes back to visiting family\nfor the holidays for example why do I\nfeel so tired when I see this phone and\nthe reason I feel tired is because I\nknow that this person is relying on me\nfor their emotional needs and I cannot\nfulfill their emotional needs so what\nthey're going to do is suck me dry\ntrying to feel fulfilled emotionally and\nI'm gonna feel drained at the end of it\nand it's never going to be enough right\nbecause next year we'll come around and\nthey'll still be emotionally needy\nthat's why you feel so exhausted because\nat the end of this conversation I'm\ngonna feel exhausted and it's not like\nthe car the calls are gonna stop in fact\nthey're going to start leaning on me\nmore so tunnel down ask yourself what\nabout this makes me feel tired if I were\nto do this how would I feel afterward\nand that's really the answer to that\nquestion is going to be how you overcome\ntiredness\nforeign"
