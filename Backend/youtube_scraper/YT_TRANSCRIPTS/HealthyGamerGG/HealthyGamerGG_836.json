    "transcript": "we think about negative emotions as bad\nthings because they're so powerful right\nfear and anxiety are so crippling but we\ndon't realize is we frequently will\nmanipulate ourselves into harnessing\nnegative emotions for our benefit hello\nhello\nso tell me a little bit about\n[Music]\num\nwhat what burns you out my friend\nokay so I'm gonna start with myself so I\nuh uh nitin you can call me nitin okay\nI'm Indian okay India undergrad in UF\nwith a bunch of other stuff in between\nokay and\num\nokay\nand so what burns me out when I uh so\nthe so what Brazil is like when I\num want to work when I've given a task\nor something that involves like\nlong-term effort to be put in like over\na week is what I considered long term I\nam able to do it if it's like has a\ndeadline and consequences attached to it\nlike a homework assignment for example\nbut if it's something that is either\nlike something some sort of project that\nI want to work on or that I try to work\non for my career\nI am like I get burnt out like after a\nfew days of work without any like\nexternal validation on progress that\nI've made and the key part is that the\nprogress has to be tangible and I need\nto be able to notice that progress as\nwell\nbut the problem is like if I'm doing a\ntask and I'm able to notice the tangible\nprogress but without the external\nvalidation I still get burnt out and I'm\nunable to I get paralyzed and I'm not\nable to do any of those tasks following\nthat if that was clear yeah so let me\nsee if I understood it and then you tell\nme if it was clear so it sounds like\nyou're able to actually do good work\nfirst of all if there's a deadline or\nsome kind of external pressure\nso in terms of college and school work\nlike you can actually work pretty\neffectively is that fair\nuh I wouldn't say effectively because I\nevery almost every like not almost every\ndeadline I've procrastinated to like the\nlast day hour or whatever time it\nrequires and summer did it like at 11\n59. okay\nso but I'm able to finish you're able to\nfinish but in a procrastinating kind of\nway and what you're what you're really\nstruggling with is that there are some\nthings let's say for your personal\ngrowth\nthat don't have a deadline right there\nis no 11 59 PM because you're just doing\nit for you\nand you struggle to do those things\nyep\nthe exceptions to when you struggle to\ndo them have to do with two things the\nfirst is that if there is a deadline\nif there's tangible progress and even if\nthere's tangible progress you need\nexternal validation\nto continue doing stuff for yourself\nokay\num I assume this is frustrating for you\nyeah it's ready tell me a little bit\nabout that\nso uh is it fine if I start with a few\nexamples sure I think that'll okay so uh\none of the things that I've tried to do\non multiple occasions like so I'm 23\nright now so I'm\nso since I was like 16 15-ish I've tried\nlike on multiple locations that are on\nthe keyboard\nuh no classes or whatever just by myself\nI've watched like probably more than 100\nto 200 YouTube videos on turning the\nkeyboard Basics music theory whatnot\nand uh I found that like the when I\nfirst started I was able to stick to it\nfor like a month and then I stopped and\nthen a few weeks later I try again but\nthen this time I'd be able to do it only\nfor like a few weeks and then I try\nagain after a few weeks or a month then\nit has two for even lesser until the\npoint I just do it for a day then I\nstopped for like a long time but in like\n2020 I came back to it like after a few\nyears and I was able to stick to it for\na month again\nbut then the same pattern repeated\nitself and until I just not play the\nkeyboard but the thing is I like every\ntime\nI am actively interested in doing\nkeyboard I'm I'm and I do all the\nyoutubing research all that but when it\ncomes to actually practice you know\ndoing anything related to it I just end\nup freezing like after that certain\nperiod of time I've done it in the\nrecent\nokay and uh\none positive thing like in the question\nit was like what I've done to like what\nI've done to deal with it so I've only\nsucceeded like let's in one aspect and\nthat was recently uh still not sure\nwhere it's going but in like so I\nfinished undergrad in the US and now I'm\nback in India doing like a boot camp and\nlike data science it started a month and\na half ago\nso all new people\nin a classroom nine to five Monday to\nThursday\nand uh I started going to the gym right\nafter my classes\nand uh it's been a month and a half and\nI'm still consistently going to the gym\nand I think the most important part\nthat's keeping me going to the gym is\nthe fact that when I after I met a few\npeople in class I told them that I'm\ngoing to the gym\nafter class and then every few days I\nwould like when I was leaving class I\ntell them I'm going to the gym like to\nget get the like external like\nconfirmation that they know that I'm\ngoing to the gym and that I know I'm\ngoing to the gym and then which ends up\nget making me go to the gym\nthe past week however\noh sorry you can go nope keep going\nuh the past week however like there was\ngroup projects and we only had to come\nin for a few hours like so this week\nMonday Tuesday Wednesday I only had to\ncome in a few hours on Monday and\nTuesday\nso uh before this there was dasara\nholidays at for those who don't know\nit's like a week off or like vacation in\nIndia so there's the classes during that\ntime\nand when I when I came back it was\nplayed into the school project so I just\nleft by myself came by myself and\nthere was no like interaction with\nanybody else and I I physically walked\nby the gym every day so I walk I stopped\nat the gym but I just I'm paralyzed to\ngo to the gym and I just end up going\nhome like it happened for three days and\nthen Thursday which\nyesterday\nfor me right now probably\nyeah so I I went out of my friends and\nthen after meeting them I told them I'm\ngoing to the gym now and then said bye\nthen I walked past the gym again and I\nactually entered a point too okay\nOkay so\nuh so I I think I think you're doing\nokay I can understand how this is\nfrustrating because what I'm hearing is\nthat\nas long as someone else knows you're\ndoing something as long as you\nalmost like make a promise to that\nperson then you'll live up to it\ndoes that make sense\nyeah like it's not really a a promise\nmay not be the right word but once you\ntell them you're going to the gym\nthen\nit's almost like like you've made a\ncommitment and you don't want to let\nthat commitment down and you don't want\nto disappoint them by lying and not\ngoing to the gym because what if they\nfound out that you didn't go to the gym\nthen how would you feel\nuh-huh\nso the the first thing yeah yeah\nso the first thing yeah go ahead oh\nso I just wanted to say like I feel that\nlike in currently but in the past like\nI've\nuh had the same similar thing to with uh\nwhat was it\noh similar to the thing to Jim but there\nwasn't actually like it was on Discord\nthough it was my high school friends I\nwas in college in us and I like post all\nmy workouts on Discord and I'd say I'm\ngonna work out\nand then after like a few months I like\nsay I'm gonna work out but then I don't\nwork out\nand then it just died from there so I\ndon't know how far this is gonna go but\nlike so there's a part so I we're gonna\ntalk about sort of like a short term and\nlong-term approach to this okay the\nfirst is how do you unders understand\nthis\nlike what do you think is going on\ninside you that this is like why do you\nthink you function this way do you have\nany sense of that\num\nI I'm dumb but like from what I can tell\nuh\nso I from what I can tell I I feel like\nI burn out or like\nhave all these problems when\nI\ndon't have enough stimulus like I don't\nknow how to put it like if I don't have\ntime to myself to think\nthen I'm fine but then if I have time\nfor myself to think that I'm not fine\nand uh whenever it's a long-term task\nlike ah like in the first part of that\ntask you're totally into the task and\nyou don't have and you're not like\nactive I mean you're not like you're\nactively on the task and you don't have\nlike thinking time for yourself if you\nknow what I mean but then I know you go\non that's that's brilliant so focused on\nit yeah\nlet me let me let me yeah yeah I'm gonna\ninterrupt you on purpose because I don't\nwant to move past this point so this is\nbrilliant so when I when you say\nstimulus I'm gonna try to reframe that a\nlittle bit so if you are so not really\nstressed but as long as your mind\ndoesn't get a chance to start making\nexcuses and make you lazy you're fine\nhey Chad subscribing to our YouTube\nchannel allows us to help more people\nwith their mental health thanks to your\nsupport so far we've already reached\nthousands of people from across the\nglobe so help us out and hit subscribe\nwait they have to hit subscribe and\nclick a bell now does that you does that\nresonate with you like because like as\nlong as there's like other stimulus like\nbut if you're left to your own devices\nyour mind is going to start to say well\nwhy like why bother you're gonna start\nwalking past the gym like you know\nif if a friend was next to you and y'all\nwere walking past the gym and you had\ntold him hey I'm gonna go to the gym and\ny'all were walking past it together you\nwould say bye and then go into the gym\nbecause you didn't have time by yourself\nbut if you're if the 10 minute walk to\nthe gym you're in your own head then\nyour mind starts doing stuff and\nsabotages your effort it's your\nmotivation starts to decrease all this\nkind of stuff right\nyeah now that you've said that like it\nkind of brings true for almost\neverything yep so we're going to get\ninto that so we can't give your mind\ntime to think\nright\nwe can't give your mind a chance to\nprocrastinate and start to make excuses\nso in this situation\nis your mind your friend or your enemy\nenemies absolutely so what are the\nthings that you use\nto defeat your enemy that is the mind\nyou create an external accountability\nwith other people\nbecause if you tell people hey I'm gonna\ngo to the gym\nthen if you don't go to the gym you're\ngonna feel guilty\nashamed disappointed\nright\ndoes your mind like to feel guilty\nshamed or disappointed\nno have you been made or have you felt\nthat way in the past\nI have tell me about that\nso like I was saying like it the gym\npart like when I was like two few years\nago when I was working on myself I went\nto the gym for a month and then I'd say\nI'm going to the gym but then I wouldn't\ngo to the gym and then I feel guilty for\nthat and then I go back to the gym for a\nfew days and then after a point in time\nin that time I felt like\nI felt guilty too many times and I just\ngot desensitized to that and I just\nstopped doing it so I don't know how far\nthis territory takes me in the let's go\nearlier than the gym\nyou're Indian right\nyeah do you have any like\nlike have you been made to feel guilty\nor did you feel guilty even before a\ncouple of years ago like can you\nremember the first time you know like\nwhen you feel disappointed in yourself\nwhen you don't go to the gym and you\ntell yourself you're gonna go\nyeah like I'll tell you kind of what I\nmean so you know you can go to the gym\nif you don't tell someone\nI mean sorry you know you can go to the\ngym if you tell someone if you tell your\nfriend hey I'm gonna go to the gym today\nyou know that you're gonna go you can\nhave confidence in yourself but then\nthere's a small part of you that's like\nI wish I wasn't this way\nwhy do I have to rely on telling someone\nelse that I'm gonna go to the gym to\nlike go to the gym and there's like a\ntiny little part of you that feels like\nalmost ashamed or disappointed with\nyourself that you have to go through\nthis to go to the gym you just can't go\nto the gym for yourself\nyou know what I mean\nyeah\nyeah do you remember like that feeling\nlike what like do you remember if you\nfelt that you know five years ago seven\nyears ago ten years ago like do you\nremember a time where you really started\nto feel like\nkind of like really disappointed in\nyourself or people made you feel really\ndisappointed in yourself\num\nso the\nso I feel like until like the 10th grade\nwhich is like I think sophomore year\nhigh school for all you guys in America\num\nI was like\nI didn't have time to think\nlike I just didn't have time to like I\nwas having fun in school I was having\nfun one time at home\nand I didn't just didn't I just don't\nremember having the type of thing\nlike in like the last two years 11-12 uh\nthere was a situation where we were in a\nrobotics competition\nand uh one first year went fine the\nsecond year like all my friends decided\nto form a\nrobotics team without me\nand then\nthat was very I felt like I did\nsomething wrong and I was like\nI was like it was definitely my fault\nand I felt like really guilty for like\nwhatever they\nwhy why did I felt guilty like\nfor them I don't know how to say it like\nI felt guilty for\nlike the fact that whatever I did to\nmake them not put me in the team\nbut then that ended up fine but then\nthat ended up fine afterwards yeah that\nwas the first thing I can remember okay\nyeah so so I I that feels important to\nme but feels a little bit off base so I\nwould encourage you to continue thinking\nabout that but let me ask you one other\nquestion\nwhy do you want to learn piano or\nkeyboard\nso\nI really want to be able to be good at\nthe piano why I I just want to like why\num\num\nwho because\nyou go ahead\nbecause I feel like I don't have any\nskills\nokay\nand what does it feel like to not have\nany skills\nwho are you until you learn the keyboard\nah\nlet me ask you actually a different\nquestion who will you be tell me about\nthe person you'll be when you start\nexercising every day and you learn the\nkeyboard tell me about that person\nthat person would be\neither equal to or better than all my\npeers and what tell me about that person\nthat person like do you want like I\ndon't understand the question like you\nI think okay I understand you don't\nunderstand the question I suspect you\nhave an answer though so let me ask it\ntry to ask it in a different way maybe\nit's a dumb question but not dumb but\nbad question\nI think that your mind thinks about and\nimagines what it is like\nonce you start exercising regularly and\nand like you have a vision of yourself\nright and you think to yourself like oh\nlike it's gonna be so awesome\nwhen I'm a badass at the piano and I'm\nripped\nit definitely thinks that tell me about\nlike when you think about that person\nyou could be how do you feel about\nyourself\nso if I'm actively learning the piano\nand going to the gym then I feel great\nby not actively going I'm not talking\nabout when you're going I'm talking\nabout you you've thought about what it's\nlike if you sp every week for the next\nthree years if you go to the gym and you\nplay piano the way that you want to\ntell me about that person\nthat person would be confident would be\ndrip hopefully yep and then would have\nthe confidence to say I am doing this I\nam doing that absolutely I am Nathan are\nyou smiling right now\nyes yeah can you all hear him smiling\nwhat are you feeling when I ask you that\nuh embarrassment\nOkay and like Joy yeah\nright\nyeah\nand so embarrassment because we're we're\nlike not letting you hide\nbut joy because like that's what you\nwant to be you want to be joyful you\nwant to be amazing\nyou want to have skills\nand\nwhat does it feel like to not be that\nperson\num\nhard question it\nit feels like\nit feels like I don't fit anywhere like\nI I don't I'm not worthy of kidding\nanywhere yeah right\nand so you'd fit better\nif you could do more stuff\nright\nlike people would respect you if you\ncould play the piano people would\nrespect you\nif you were in shape\nI don't know what your sexuality is or\nwhat your romantic status is but maybe\npeople that you're attracted to\nwould give you attention\nyour friends would be impressed\nyou know you know what I mean\nyeah like you could hold your head up\nhigh like you could be confident in who\nyou are instead of\nbeing who you are right now\nyeah\nmake sense\nmm-hmm\nso let's try to understand what's going\non here okay\nI'm gonna do my best to share some\nthoughts you let me know if it kind of\nworks for you or not\nso the first thing is that the mind is\nthe enemy we've figured that out right\nbecause when left to its own devices\nthe mind will prevent you from doing\nyour goals and we'll get to why that is\nin a second right so remember if you're\nleft to your own devices if you're given\ntime to think\nthen you're not going to go to the gym\nyou'll stop playing piano but in order\nfor you to achieve your goals\nand let's like dig into that in order\nfor you to achieve your goals you can't\ngive yourself time to think and\nfurthermore guilt is a very strong\nmotivator for you so here's what I think\nis going on with you you don't like who\nyou are\nand you've decided that you're going to\nchange and you can't continue being who\nyou are you need to be you can't be\nnothing you need to be ripped piano\nplaying nithin\ncan't be this knit then it's not good\nenough can't be the hey I didn't get\ninvited to the robot robotics team\nNathan we're done being that loser we're\ngonna be Chad Nathan right yep so the\nother thing is you want this thing\nbecause you're tired of being who you\nare and so you're a smart guy so you've\nfigured out\nthe best way that you can to become\nsomething else\nwhich is that your mind does is gonna\nget in the way right because you're\nyou've knit the loser Nathan's mind\ncan't motivate itself\nloser Nathan's mind is your enemy so\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna trick\nit we're gonna out maneuver it\nwe're going to defeat it and what works\nreally well guilt\nso you create situations for yourself\nwhere you've realized I hate feeling\nguilty in your robotics class when you\ndidn't get picked you felt so guilty\nyou're like never again\nNathan did you tell yourself never again\nyeah absolutely so now you've got a gift\nyou have a key you have an answer never\nagain\nso how can you create situations where\nthe idea of never again will motivate\nyou you create artificial guilt you tell\npeople hey I'm gonna go to the gym you\ncreate a stimulus for yourself and you\nyou never want to feel that guilt again\nso as long as that guilt\nis like possible then you'll avoid it at\nall costs that's the way that you\nmanipulate your mind do you see that\nso you have to you're using guilt as a\ntool\nto get your mind to do what it needs to\ndo\nright it's like your mind is like a\nhorse and the guilt is the whip\nand you're telling it you better move\nand the thing is every time you tell\nsomeone I'm gonna go to the gym that's\nyou picking up the whip you're creating\nthe whip you're creating the motivation\ndo you see that because when you don't\ntalk to them and even then like when\nthey don't validate you you're like then\nthe whip doesn't work anymore and then\nthe horse stops moving\nso you're creating like this sabotaging\ncycle but it's not really sabotaging\nit's also effective\nbecause this is the only way you've\nknown how to motivate yourself\nyeah\nokay\nso now what do we do about this I know\nit sounds kind of weird but I don't\nthink you have to abandon that strategy\nquite yet is it unhealthy for you in the\nlong term absolutely but I think if you\nneed to the goal here is for you to get\nto the gym and achieve some of your\ngoals okay so if telling people is what\ngets you to the gym every week that you\nget to the gym whether it's through\nguilt and whipping yourself or through\nlike a love for your body or whatever it\nis doesn't matter every day that you go\nto the gym is a win do you get that\nyeah so if you've got to do that by all\nmeans do that\nthe long-term strategy though is for you\nto like think a little bit about where\nthese goals come from\nand for you to realize that you don't\nlike who you are and you believe that\ndoing some external action is Gonna Give\nYou confidence in yourself\nthat's never gonna happen\nso people who are like I'm not proud of\nmyself let me go make money then I will\nbe proud of myself\nI'm not proud of myself I feel ashamed\nof myself let me go get beautiful\nright let me go get cosmetic surgery let\nme go get a boob job let me go get this\nkind of thing and that kind of thing and\nand let me drive a fancy car and then I\nwill feel better about myself because\nthe world will love me\nwhy do you need the world to love you\nbecause you don't love yourself\nthat's it's that simple\nyeah that's true\nso I think all of your goals are coming\nout of a non-genuine place they're not\ncoming out of inspiration\nthey're not coming out of like love and\ndevotion\nthey're coming out of a hatred of being\nWhere You Are\nwhat do you think about that\nso as you said I think that's true right\nyou're right than the fact that all my\nmotivation or whatever it is that I'm\ndoing coming from it for myself\nbecause I\nI I don't like who I am right now and I\nfeel like what you said about like air\nbeing a temporary strategy I feel like\nlike as of right now like I don't know\nhow it'll be a little bit aspect no I\nwhat my mind is telling me is that\nthat'll be your only strategy until you\nget to that chat\nyeah until then\nlike there's nothing there because\nyeah I don't know\nit so that's why I'm saying I'm saying\ndon't abandon the strategy because I\ndon't think that you can get rid of it\nquite yet\nbut there is a different strategy and\nthat starts with and I don't know that\nwe can do all of this today but what I\nwould encourage you is start to think a\nlittle bit uh Nathan about when you\nstopped\nbeing proud of yourself\nand instead of saying\nright after my uh gifted child which is\nhigh school right\nso not surprising and then the other\nthing is I right now the problem is that\nall of your goals are not going to\nactually give you confidence\ndoes that make sense because you're\ntrying to impress other people\nbut the more that you impress other\npeople like that doesn't make you\nconfident it just impresses other people\nand sometimes you get into the Trap of\nimpressing more and impressing more and\nimpressing more and impressing more and\nyou can never make the whole world happy\nyou can never make everyone love you\nso what I want you to do is think long\nand hard about what's a single thing\nthat you can be proud of\nfor yourself\njust think about it and I want you to\ntry to do that thing it's not about\ndoing it for a month or a year or a week\nwhat is just something that you can say\nlike this is not for other people this\nis not to feel better about myself this\nis something that I want to do for me\nand I'm the one who matters\nI kind of like already have that thing\nwhat is it it doesn't help me like\nanything else so I really like helping\nother people achieve their goals\nit's like I don't know if it's\nsabotaging myself but I really\nenjoy like thoroughly enjoy like it\nhasn't gotten I haven't gotten tired of\nit but helping other people with their\ngoals\nokay so I want you to do it's fine to do\nthat but I want you to really pay\nattention to yourself\nokay and here's the main question you've\ngot to ask I want you to go and help\nsomeone\nand then look in yourself and try to\nfigure out do I feel good because of the\nway that they thank me or do I feel good\nbecause I made the world a better place\nI feel good because\nthey're in a better place than they were\nthe day before\nbut then I feel bad because I'm still\n[ __ ]\nlike I don't feel envious or jealous of\nthem but I feel I feel honestly I feel\ngood for them about myself that I did\nsomething I feel good that they're in a\nbetter place than they were the day\nbefore if I succeeded in helping them\nokay but I still feel like [ __ ] at the\nend of the day as far as is that is that\nokay\nyeah I felt like it's fine okay so if if\nI gave you two options\noption one is that you become the knit\nthen of your dreams\n[Music]\nhandsome\neligible bachelor\nripped plays the keyboard data scientist\nboot camp\nworks for a famous company you're making\nme smile right\nworks for a company where your parents\ncan brag to all their Social Circle\nabout their son nitin who works at\nGoogle Map\ns\nright\nand then you've got another nitin\nwho every day for the rest of his life\nmakes one person's life better\nworks at a mediocre company makes decent\njob makes decent money\nbut nothing to brag about\nwhen when you know anytime your family\ngets together\nthey always talk about your cousins and\nother people who are doing amazing\nthings and then when they ask your\nparents how's Nathan doing nithin's\nparents say oh he's okay\nbut you get to help one human being\nevery single day which one do you pick\nthat's a hard question but if I have to\nbe honest with myself I picked cabinets\nand if\non the condition that I am happy after\nbecoming Channel if I if I if it's\nambiguous\nI'd still picture it doesn't matter okay\ngood so I think you need to be honest\nwith yourself right\nso right now what I'm hearing is that\nyou value that which totally fine so I\nthink you should by all means become\nChad nitin\nbut I I want you to just play around\nwith this stuff really pay attention to\nyourself for helping people and I think\nthat that the one thing I'll give you\nkind of like one last kind of pointer\nwhich is\nwhen you help people and you're still\nnothing at the end of that\ncan you be okay with that\nright can you like kind of acknowledge\nfor a moment that okay maybe I'm not a\nbetter person but like that's okay I've\nmade the world a better place\ncan you accept yourself\nyes\nso just keep playing around with it I\nthink you're actually going to be okay\nlike you've just got to work on this\ninternal stuff you've got to work on why\nbecause the the thing is the reason that\nyou're not confident in yourself is\nbecause you're not confident in yourself\nright so like this is the last kind of\nparadoxes that the way that you get\nconfident in yourself is by accepting\nyourself for who you are even if that's\nnot chatting it then\nyou'll really be confident because even\nChad Nathan strives for something else\nstrives for something else strives for\nsomething I'm not good enough\nright that's the road of Chad Nathan\nbut if you really want to be confident\nin yourself you have to be able to say I\nhelped another human being my life is\nstill a mess but you know what I can\ntake some pride\nthat the world is a slightly better\nplace and I'm gonna go to sleep\npeacefully tonight and tomorrow I'm\ngonna work on me\nand once you're able to do that you'll\ndevelop confidence\nand you must forsake the path of the\nChad to become the Chad\nkind of see why this is kind of see what\nlike the center is going to be hard it\nis going to be hard\nyou know and the problem is that you\nalways take the easy Road\nyou just pull out the guilt Whip and\nsmack yourself\nto make progress that's easy does it\nhurt absolutely but don't tell me it\nisn't easy it's so easy to go for to the\ngym when you brag to everyone that\nyou're gonna go when you show them oh\nyou [ __ ] y'all don't actually\nexercise I'ma go to the gym today and\nI'ma let you know\nmm-hmm\nso I agree it's going to be easy oh it's\ngoing to be hard\nI think that also is like a little\nproblem because\nI I don't feel comfortable like telling\neverybody like bragging like I'm doing\nthis I'm doing like the gym is one thing\nbut then everything\nI need to find people yeah because you\ncan't you can't be arrogant then they're\nnot going to be impressed with you\nyeah you gotta you gotta make him\nimpressed with you without making it\nseem like you want to impress them I'm\nwith you\nsomething to figure out by myself I\nguess well you don't have to figure it\nout by yourself you know we're around\nI don't know that I'm gonna have a whole\nlot more time but there are a lot of\npeople in this community who are here to\nhelp you\nand I think you're on a good journey my\nfriend I'm excited for you\ntake care\nyou too and thank you for doing all this\nthank you for the community for being\nthere thank you help me with the\nproblems and you all are awesome thank\nyou very much\nthank you good luck my friend\nthank you\nyeah so we got to be super careful about\nsee we we think about negative emotions\nas bad things\nbecause they're so powerful right fear\nand anxiety are so crippling I can't\neven leave the house because I'm anxious\nbut we don't realize is we frequently\nwill manipulate ourselves into\nharnessing negative emotions for our\nbenefit\nright so we'll tell people oh yeah I'm\ngoing to go to the gym because if I\ndon't go then I'll feel guilty\nso we've figured out how to trick\nourselves into doing what we want to do\nharnessing negative emotions and it\nworks so I'm not saying don't abandon it\nwhat I'm saying is that it's not a good\nlong-term solution\nbecause then ultimately what you're\ngoing to end up doing is it's like your\nproductivity is tied to suffering\nand that's unhealthy is it going to lead\nto success sure\nbut it's unhealthy and the key thing is\nthat there is another way\nbut we never explore that way because\nthis one is so good\nwhy does everyone procrastinate it's not\nbecause procrastination is a problem\nit's because it's a solution if you\nfound this video helpful check out Dr\nK's guide
