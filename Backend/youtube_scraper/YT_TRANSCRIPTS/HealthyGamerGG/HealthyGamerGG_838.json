    "transcript": "to give up on my goals because they're\nincompatible in the world feels like\nsacrificing a part of myself why should\nI have to give up on my goals when it's\nincompatible with the world like you're\ntelling me just give up my goals are\nincompatible with modern living I've\nbeen listening to a lot of Dr K's stuff\nlately and something that resonated with\nme was the world demands too much of you\nit's not just you he emphasizes finding\nwhat your goals are what you want in\nlife in another video there were the\nquadrants of things people should do\nshoulds wants duties Etc he says if you\nstick in the shoulds you have an empty\nlife successful or no so what do you do\nwhen the shoulds are the only things you\nhave time and energy for I've discovered\nthat my goals are all centering around\none thing I don't want to spend eight to\nten hours a day doing what other people\ndemand of me I don't want to work I have\nhad the most fulfilling parts of my life\nwhen I'm between jobs and I thrive in\ndirect proportion to how much free time\nI have I don't just sit on the couch I\ndo things I do Hobbies I see friends I\nvolunteer I exercise but when I have to\nwork all of that goes all of that mostly\ngoes out the window because I need a lot\nof recharge time no matter what job I've\nhad it always ends up this way I don't\nget a choice to do my goals because I\nhave to eat and keep a roof over my head\nI'm horrendously jealous of two kind two\nof my friends who got windfalls and are\nnow living the life that I want I see\nthem weekly it kills me inside I hate\nwork I hate the very concept of work and\nI'm so tired of doing the dog and pony\nshow for a company just to stay alive\nwhat happens when the world demands too\nmuch is the world demands you work what\nhappens when the should is so draining\nthat you don't get anything you actually\nwant when the thing you're passionate\nabout is freedom and a lack of\nobligation so this is a fantastic post\nand I love it because it captures the\nfirst thing I love about it is that it's\nlike a leveled up post so this is\nsomeone who has watched some of our\ncontent has already learned some stuff\nand now we're getting to like the level\ntwo level three and level four questions\nokay I'm with you I understand that\nliving a life that other people want me\nto live is unfulfilling but I'm in a\nsituation where what the world demands\nof me is not what I want there just\nisn't space for what I want when the\nworld demands something of me right and\nif we look at like the title of the post\nmy goals are incompatible with the world\nwhat I want like just isn't possible and\nthere are other people out there who\nhave what I want and it is possible for\nthem but it's possible for them because\nthey got lucky and I know what's\nfulfilling to me I've had periods of\ntime where I don't have to go enslave in\nin some job for eight to ten hours a day\nand then I go out and I live life with\nzest so it's not like life isn't\nenjoyable I life is enjoyable I like a\nparticular kind of life and that's not\npossible it's fundamentally incompatible\nand so let's think about this for a\nsecond right because if what I want is\nincompatible with the world how do human\nbeings respond to that if what you want\nis impossible because you have to work\nright like you can't just have freedom\nfrom obligations which I totally get\nthat you want you know I want freedom I\nwant to live my life I don't want to\nlive as some corporate slave totally get\nit but this is the world that we live in\nmy goals are incompatible with the world\nso what do you do in that situation the\nnatural thing to do is to be resigned\nright because we can't wave a magic wand\nand change the world so then it's like\nokay so like what are you telling me\nthat if I if the world is a particular\nway and I have particular goals what do\nI do about it and what people will tell\nyou is they'll be like well you know\nmaybe change your goals because you\ncan't change the world and so then what\nwe do is we sort of settle we compromise\nwe're kind of like okay like I guess I\nhave to give up on my goals and become a\npeon and do what the world demands me to\ndo right so what we actually like when\nyou want something that is impossible or\nfeels impossible what it naturally leads\nus to do is become resigned to become\nresentful hey chat subscribing to our\nYouTube channel allows us to help more\npeople with their mental health thanks\nto your support so far we've already\nreached thousands of people from across\nthe globe so help us out and hit\nsubscribe wait they have to hit\nsubscribe and click a bell now and then\nit's like then we're unhappy right and\nthat's not that to give up on my goals\nbecause they're incompatible in the\nworld feels like sacrificing a part of\nmyself why should I have to give up on\nmy goals when it's incompatible with the\nworld like you're telling me just give\nup so it leads to a ton of resentment\nresignation we don't want to do that\nright we don't want to resign like we I\ndon't want to give up what I want in\nlife isn't the purpose of life that it\nshould be fulfilling and like you know I\nshould be happy and I know what makes me\nhappy like why is the world this way\nmakes perfect sense so let's start by\ntalking a little bit about the science\nof Happiness there's a great course on\nhappiness which is taught by professor\nat Yale which is anyone can sign up for\nso they made it publicly available\nreally cool so they come cover some\nresearch which shows that so what I'm\nkind of hearing from this person is that\nif they had freedom if they had\nwindfalls like their two friends then\nthey would be happy because then I would\nhave the freedom to do whatever I want\nand what the research on happiness shows\nis that if this is let's say money or\nfreedom and this is happiness that\nessentially as we get more money we\nbecome more happy and then it either\nlevels out maybe even starts to decline\nnow this is confusing for a lot of\npeople so this number over here is one\nhundred thousand US dollars but I think\nthis was prior to inflation I suspect\nthat this number is actually 150k now so\nwhen we say money doesn't buy happiness\nwell sort of it buys happiness it buys a\ncertain amount of Happiness up until a\nparticular point and what I tend to see\nand this is kind of weird right so like\nwell doesn't more money buy more\nhappiness so it's like let's look at\ncelebrities\nso celebrities tend to have a lot of\nmoney right so celebrities are like in\nterms of their money or Freedom they're\nall the way out here with let's say net\nworths of 10 million dollars but they're\nnot all perfectly happy in fact\ncelebrities seem to be like some of the\nmost kind of like they have all kinds of\ntrouble and like it you know a Content\nhappy and down-to-earth celebrity is\nsuch a rarity that the few of them that\nwe see we are like wow this person is so\namazing they're like a Down to Earth\nhumble happy celebrity the normal\nexperience appears to be of celebrities\nthat their life is like suffering that\nwe don't understand it's like once in a\nblue moon they're like a desert rose\nthey're like wow that person is so down\nto earth you see thousand clips of them\non social media meanwhile you've got\nlike all these Publications that are\nlike oh this person is doing this and we\nlike love to hate on celebrities they\nalso talk about how much they suffer\nlike my life is hard right and we're\nlike screw you no it's not so if we look\nat it from a data perspective we\ndiscover something really bizarre which\nwhich is that past 100 or 150k maybe it\nstabilizes but maybe even it goes down\nand this has been my experience so I've\nworked with a lot of people some\ncelebrities but I've worked with a lot\nof people who are very successful and I\nwould completely agree that money to a\ncertain point buys happiness but what\nmoney buys is security\nto a certain degree freedom and what it\nreally buys is like freedom from worry\nlike it's really hard to be happy\nwithout a roof over your head it's\nreally hard to be happy when you have to\nworry about paying bills at the end of\nthe month it's really hard to be happy\nwhen you're thinking about going on\nvacation and you really have to like\nplan for months and months and months to\nbe able to afford it it's really happy\nto it's really hard to be happy when you\ngo on vacation and things end up being\n20 more than you budgeted for because\nyou didn't budget for that and you had\nto work six months to get here so all of\nthose things I completely agree have to\ndo with happiness but what we also kind\nof know from a data perspective right so\nremember this is research that shows\nthat you can make let's say 500 000 and\nyou get the same amount of happiness or\nmaybe even less than 100 or 150k which\nis really bizarre but that's what the\ndata shows and we sort of see that in\ncelebrities so this is where I'd say\nthere's another thing here which I don't\nknow if this is maybe starts like this\nbut this is what I would say is Dharma\nor fulfillment and there's data to\nsupport this as well that are needs and\nsecurity and money are kind of the white\nline and they'll help us get so far but\nbeyond that in order to be happy we need\nsomething else so this is kind of what\nthe Buddha said so the Buddha was like\nultimately happiness has nothing to do\nwith money it has to do with your\nattachments and freedom from attachments\nwe also see this with like Maslow's\nhierarchy of needs where Maslow was kind\nof like the more of your needs that get\nmet the more\nself-actualization you need to be happy\nright and even now if we look at it\nglobally something really interesting is\nhappening across the world technology is\nadvancing there's more security than\nthere's kind of ever been right and\npeople may say what are you talking\nabout there's climate change in the\nthreat of nuclear war what do you mean\nthere's more security a hundred years\nago infant mortality was like 20 do you\nall realize this I don't know if y'all\nare from one of these cultures because\nthere's a lot of them where they don't\nname a baby until they're like 20 days\nold like think about what kind of\nculture doesn't name their children\nuntil they're 20. happens in Indian\nculture I think it may happen in June\nculture as well I've seen so many\ndifferent cultures where they don't name\nthe baby and why is that it's because a\nlot of them used to die so we you know\n500 years ago people were dying of\nstarvation some of them are dying now\nthat's not good but we lose more people\nfrom obesity than we do from starvation\ntoday right that like cardiovascular\ndisease and obesity and diabetes this is\ndoing more damage to us than starvation\nand poverty which is really bizarre so\nas a society we're moving up Maslow's\nhierarchy of needs and there's one\ndimension of medicine that is getting\nworse and that's mental health\neverything else is getting better HIV\nused to be a lethal diagnosis people\nlive almost normal lifespans if they get\ndiagnosed with HIV today polio would\n[ __ ] people and kill people any\nbacterial infection before the invention\ndiscovery of penicillin has\nrevolutionized survival so for like a\nhundred thousand years human beings were\ndying of pneumonia and now like if you\nget a bacterial infection you get\nazithromycin and you're okay it's no\nlonger a lethal illness you just go to a\ndoctor they give you a prescription hell\nin some parts of the world you don't\neven need to see a doctor you just go\nget antibiotics you're fine the one so\nas we're moving up as a society as we're\nmoving up Maslow's hierarchy of needs\nwhat do we discover mental health is\ngetting worse because we're getting\ncloser to the self-actualization as a\nsociety We are following this curve and\nwe've hit this point and so now we're\nseeing people be more unhappy okay so\nthat's the kind of the first thing to\nunderstand now the next thing to talk a\nlittle bit about let's go back to the\npost for a second so I've discovered\nthat all my goals are centered around\none thing I don't want to spend eight to\nten hours a day doing what other people\ndemand of me I don't want to work I\ndon't get a choice to do my goals\nbecause I have to eat and keep a roof\nover my head I'm horrendously jealous of\ntwo of my friends who got windfalls and\nare now living the life that I want I\nsee them weekly and it kills me inside\nso if we're talking about this we need\nto understand something so the first is\nthat if you get more freedom it will\nmake you more happy\nup until a point so I don't doubt that\nfor a second that like if you're working\nso hard that you don't get a chance to\ndo your hobbies you don't get a chance\nto exercise you don't get a chance to\nsocialize I totally understand why you\nwould feel unhappy but the first thing\nthat I want to point out is that the\ngoals that I'm hearing this person say\nare kind of different they're not\nnecessarily moving towards something you\ncould kind of say they're moving towards\nFreedom which makes sense because that's\nthe value that this person has but what\nI am really hearing is this person's\ngoal is to not do something and to me\nnot doing things and chasing something\nlike freedom is not quite what fulfills\npeople like I don't know if that kind of\nmakes sense because you can make an\nargument that yeah their their goal is\nfreedom makes sense but what I'm really\nhearing from this person is I want the\nlife that someone else has I want the\nlife that someone else has I see my\nfriends they got windfalls and I did not\nand it kills me inside and my goals are\nincompatible with the world so if you\nreally like this is going to be tricky\nbecause now I'm going to say something\nthat I think in some ways may not be\ncompassionate but if you really want to\nknow the answer to this situation we\nhave to understand some like harsh\nthings about the world and ourselves the\nfirst is that if the world is a\nparticular way and you are unhappy with\nit you have far more power to change\nyourself than you do the world do you\nhave power to change the world\nabsolutely but I'm gonna go out on a\nlimb and saying that if you want to\nchange the world you got to change\nyourself first I'm not saying that the\nworld is a is a perfect place and that\nit shouldn't be worked on but if you\nyour goals are fundamentally\nincompatible with the world I think\nyou've got to look at your goals because\nthose are way easier to change now\nhere's the problem with that so like if\nyou tell me like oh so I need to change\nmy goals right but like you don't want\nto change your goals that doesn't feel\nfair to you if you're listening to this\nand you're like but I want those things\nright I want freedom I want friends I\nwant those windfall profits that let me\nlive the life that I want I'm jealous of\nthese people I'm envious of them and so\nif I told you like oh okay so then if\nyou're envious of people maybe the\nsolution is to no longer be envious\nright so let's say I said okay like if\nyou meditate for a while you'll no\nlonger feel jealous you'll learn to be\ncontent with what you have because that\nis how you become happy in life you\nmeditate your way to contentment right\nlike we know that the science and all\nthat good stuff do you want to meditate\nyour way to contentment of course not\nyou don't want to matter you don't want\nto be content what you want is to have\nyour desires fulfilled when you're\nenvious if I gave you a meditation that\nyou could do for six months and at the\nend of that you would not feel one ounce\nof Envy would you actually do it but I'm\nguessing a fair number y'all would not\nand why is that because that's not\nactually what you want you don't want\ncontentment you want what your friends\nhave because to be content means to give\nup your jealousy it means to give up\nyour desires it means to settle and we\ndon't want to settle F no because I'm in\nlike that's not what life is about the\nroad to happiness you're telling me the\nroad to happiness is [ __ ] subtle\nyou're telling me that the road to\nhappiness is not achieved leaving what I\nwant like those are my goals you're\ntelling me to give up my goals to be\nhappy how about achieving my goals why\ndon't you help me do that because I\ndon't want to give up my goals that's\nlike giving up right it's it's\nresignation it's resentment is there a\ncouple things we got to understand about\nif you have a bunch of jobs and you say\nI don't like any of them I am\nincompatible with the world there's a\nsubtle issue there so it's very possible\nthat you don't like any of them it's\nvery possible that your job jobs suck\nI'm not saying that isn't possible but\nanytime we're approaching a problem in\nlife there's a part that is the world\nand there's the part that's us and how\ndo you know that is a simple way to give\nyou all a simple example I want you all\nto think about an Olympic silver\nmedalist the person who gets the silver\nmedal they're the number one loser and\nthey're also an Olympic silver medalist\nis that something to be proud of or is\nthat something to be frustrated about do\nyou think the silver medalist envies the\ngold medalist if I went to a silver\nmedalist and I said hey you should be\nhappy you're the second best person in\nthe world that's amazing you're better\nthan 7 billion other people good job and\nthe interesting thing is are there\nsilver medalists who are like yeah I\nknow I'm very proud of my\naccomplishments it's great I'm happy for\nthe person who got the gold I wish I\ncould have done it but you know what I\nworked really hard I'm proud of it and\nthen there's the other kind of silver\nmedalist that's like you know what\nyou're right I wish I got the gold I\nworked so hard to just get a freaking\nsilver I don't care about the 7 billion\npeople that I'm better than I'm just\nlooking at the one person that I'm\ninferior to do both of those\nperspectives kind of make sense can you\nimagine that both of those people could\nfeel that way absolutely but their\nsituation is exactly the same they both\ngot the silver medal so what's the\ndifference why is One content and one is\nunhappy it's your perspective it's the\npersonal attitude it's not the world\nit's you so this is something that's\nreally important to understand or do the\njobs that you have suck maybe I don't\nknow I'm not saying that they don't but\nthere is some element that you control\nover whether your jobs are the worst\nthing in the world or acceptable or even\nenjoyable I'm not saying that you have a\nhundred percent control but you've got\nsome control there and if you're in a\nsituation where you say my goals are\nincompatible with the world you've got\nto figure out what you do control so\njust to give you all a little bit more\nlike kind of a scientific analogy so\nthere's this thing called the placebo\neffect which means that if you believe\nthat something will work for you it\nclinically will have a benefit even if\nit is completely biologically inert and\nthe placebo effect can be seen in\nchemotherapy drugs these are things that\nliterally like kill cancer and if you\nbelieve it works it has a greater effect\nthe other thing that's kind of\ninteresting is the placebo effect has a\nlesser-known cousin called the nocebo\neffect which means that if you don't\nbelieve something will work it won't\nwork for you the therapeutic value of a\nmedication that a patient does not\nbelieve in decreases even if it's the\nsame biological compound but if I don't\nbelieve it'll work it'll work less we\ncan also see this in other areas like\nrelationships so the one thing that\npredicts happiness and connect the\nstrongest variable that can that\npredicts happiness and contentment in a\nromantic relationship is faith in the\nrelationship which may sound kind of\nweird because isn't the faith determined\nby the quality of the relationship it\nturns out that at a minimum it's a\ntwo-way street if you believe in a\nrelationship that relationship will\nactually be better just like if you\nbelieve in a medication that will be\nbetter so I want you all to just think\nabout this let's say that I don't\nbelieve that I can I believe I am\nincompatible with the people with the\nworld I'm incompatible my goals don't\nline up with the people that in the\nworld or that I date when I go on those\ndates what do you think is going to\nhappen you think I'm gonna have a great\ntime you think the people that I date\nare going to be like oh you don't\nbelieve like you have goals that are\ncompletely incompatible with me let me\nchange so that I can make you happy what\ndo you think that what do you think that\nperson is like on a date do you think\nthat they're gonna have fun no of course\nnot and then what do they end up doing\nthey end up blaming the people that they\ndate right I'm incompatible with the\nworld I am what I am and so this in the\nsame way like when it comes to your job\nif you hate with every fiber of your\nbeing every single job that you've gone\nto right because if you've tried tons of\njobs and none of them work for you what\ndo you think is the common denominator\nis it the job or is it you clearly it's\nyou and this person even says it they're\nlike I'm incompatible I don't want to do\nthis and therein the subtle thing I\nthink could be happening which is that\nthe jobs that you engage in have a\nhealthy amount of nocebo effect you're\ngoing into it Kicking and Screaming so\nyou're not going to have a good\nexperience that's kind of like but wait\nthat doesn't sound wait so you're\ntelling me I just have to just have to\nlearn how to enjoy some crappy job and\nthat is the the solution to happiness\nthat doesn't feel right right isn't it\nlike aren't I supposed to have\nself-determination and build the life\nthat I want shouldn't I move towards my\ngoals and my goals or like freedom and\nenjoyment sure absolutely but I think\nthat there's something here internally\nthat you can adjust because I think if\nyou really think about it there's\nsomething subtle going on here which\nkind of goes back to this issue of\njealousy which is what do you really\nwant more do you want what someone else\nhas or do you want to be happy because\noftentimes when when we really I think\nit really comes down to jealous is we\ndon't want to actually let go of our\njealousy right you know if you really\nthink about it like I don't want to have\nto settle with not having a windfall I\nwant the world to be fair I want that\nwindfall and if I were to tell you okay\nI can give you a meditation practice\nthat will have you be content with what\nyou have you want the windfall you want\nwhat you want you don't want to be happy\nscrew that I don't want to settle I\ndon't want to be content you want what\nyou want you want the windfall you want\nthe lives that they have I don't want to\nbe content with this and therein lies\nthe problem because you actually don't\nyou don't want to be content you want\nsomething else and if someone goes\nthrough life without prioritizing\ncontentment or happiness this is exactly\nwhat you're going to see why aren't they\nhappy because they don't want to be\nhappy what they want is what someone\nelse has so I don't know if this like is\nrobbing people the wrong way or if it's\nsinking in or even if I'm making any\nsense a very practical perspective there\nare a couple things to consider the\nfirst is if you don't like any of the\njobs I'm not saying that you should just\nlearn to be happy there I'm saying that\nif you value freedom you should make a\nconcerted effort to move towards your\nvalues and what that means is oftentimes\nsacrifice so I'm not saying you should\njust be content with your job you should\nwork on that angle a little bit but also\nlike what are the jobs that are the most\ntolerable what are the jobs okay if you\nhave to work eight to ten hours to have\nthis amount of free time can you get\npaid twice as much therefore you have to\nwork half as long so instead of\nsacrificing eight to ten hours you will\nsacrifice four to five hours a day is\nthat possible now this is where a lot of\npeople say well no it's not\nthat's why I'd say like I'm not so sure\nabout that it's probably possible it's\nare you willing to make the trade to\naccomplish it well no because I don't\nwant to go to school I don't want to do\nthat I don't want to do this so I'd say\nvery practically by all means like try\nto optimize your life towards Freedom if\nyou care about freedom and that's what\nyou find fulfilling that's a wonderful I\ndon't think it's a goal I think it's a\nvalue and so then your goals should be\ndetermined by that value so if what you\ncare about is the freedom to do what you\nwant to your goal should be how do I\ncreate a life of freedom for myself\nbecause I don't really accept that\nthere's nothing you can do to improve\nyour financial situation that you can't\nget some kind of events degree that you\ncan't you know save up for whatever like\nthere's got to be there's going to be\nsome kind of plan now you may be\nwondering well like why is it so hard or\nnot you may be wondering but I think\nthere's a reason why it's really hard to\nthink that way which I don't blame\nanyone for if you're kind of in that\nsituation and what is that reason it's\nbecause of the windfall so when you look\nat someone else and you're like they\ndidn't have to do that crap why should I\nlike they just got it and that's what I\nwant like why how is it fair that you're\ntelling me that I have to work my ass\noff get an advanced degree double my\nincome grind for five years so that I\ncan work four hours a day and maintain\nmy current lifestyle and someone else\nover there just gets the windfall and\nthey don't have to go through all that\ncrap how is this fair that I have to\nadjust my goals I have to do internal\nwork when other people have it easy and\nthis is sort of the simple thing to say\nis it's not fair right sorry life isn't\nfair which is sort of true and sort of\nnot true to be honest that's kind of a\nweird thing to say I know but but what I\nreally encourage you to do is like\nreally think about the jealousy because\nreally what's getting you hung up if\nthose people didn't exist I wanted to\njust think about this for a second if\nthere were people around you that did\nnot get the windfall then what would\nyour life be like would you be happy and\ncontent would you be moving towards your\ncareer in advancement and all that kind\nof stuff think about that right if there\nwas no jealousy and you could just focus\non building the life that you want to\nand moving towards your goals if there\nwas no one around you that when you\nlooked at them you were like oh that\nperson is so lucky and I'm unlucky if we\ncould remove the unfairness from the\nequation in your head how would that\nchange the way that you look at life\nbecause it's transformative because then\nwhat happens is when you talk to people\nwho are not jealous of other people\nthey're just living their own life right\nthey're like oh it's great that someone\nelse has something but like I'm in this\nsituation I'm gonna focus on me I'm\ngonna try to figure out how do I work\nfour or five hours a day and that's\nreally what you need to do right like\nyou need to start living your life but\nyou can't because of the jealousy\nbecause every step forward you take\ninstead of thinking about how many steps\nyou need to take or that it's progress\nor that's moving towards your values all\nyou're looking at is you're looking at\nthe one person who's like you know at\nthe airport when you're walking and\nyou're lugging your bags and that little\ncart Drives By with two people sitting\non it and you're like lugging your bags\nand they're just taking a ride and\nthey're like me me and they're like\nweaving around people and everyone moves\nout of their way right because it's a\nfreaking airport cart why don't I get to\nbe on the card I get it like it makes\nsense like jealousy is such a natural\nemotion and yet I don't think that\nwanting to be on the cart helps you in\nany way shape or form in fact noticing\nthe cart and focusing on the cart all it\ndoes is makes the road that you have to\nwalk actually artificially worse because\nyou're thinking about the cart you gotta\ncarry your luggage whether they're on\nthe cart or they're not on the cart\nright you got to carry the luggage you\ngot to walk to your gate no matter what\nand that's gonna suck a certain amount\nwhat I'm saying is that if you want to\nstart living towards like your goals and\nbuilding the life that you want to\njealousy has no place and I think\nthey're right when they say comparison\nor jealousy is the thief of joy and like\nI don't know how to say this but you're\nnever going to live a fulfilling life\nand find Joy if you're chasing what\nother people have this is the big\ndiscovery that the Yogi's made in in the\nEast is that the satisfaction of desires\ndoes not lead to happiness it can lead\nto Temporary enjoyment it can lead to\npositive emotion and pleasure but it\ndoesn't lead to contentment and this is\nalso what Maslow discovered right so he\nwas like okay so there's like food and\nshelter and then there's like other\nkinds of psychological needs and at the\nvery top is self-actualization and so if\nyou're in this kind of situation where\nyou're looking around and sort of saying\nokay the world is unfair I want you to\nFirst think a little bit about your\njealousy and like where that comes from\nand why it's so hard to let go the other\nthing is by all means plan for a life\nlike Advance professionally you know but\ndon't grind because the world wants you\nto grind this is another important thing\nwhere it's like I don't want to be a\ncorporate slave for the man then don't\nbe a corporate slave for the man work in\nthe corporation for yourself do it for\nyou right it's kind of like when people\ntalk about quiet quitting quiet quitting\nis when people stop going the extra mile\nthat's not quitting that's called Junior\njust doing your job so by all means go\nto work and just do your job or more\nimportantly like this is what I really\nrecommend is when you go to work go for\nyourself start doing things for yourself\nand don't worry about what other people\nare doing because it doesn't help you at\nall and so think a little bit about\nwhere that jealousy comes from and the\nlast point that that I want to share\nwith you is people may ask okay so like\nwhat do you think Dr K is the world fair\nor unfair and this is what I'd say I\nhave certain beliefs but the most\nimportant thing about this discussion is\nnot what I believe it's for you to\nfigure out what you believe and to find\nyour central Compass is the world fair\ngreat at least now I understand it or\neven if you decide the world is unfair\nand then you say okay the world is\nunfair and I'm going to do something\nabout it that becomes a goal to fix as\nopposed to something to be resigned\nabout and one thing that I can guarantee\nyou is anytime a human being\nreconciles their place with the fairness\nof the world good things happen we're\nnot saying it's fair we're not saying\nit's unfair the important thing is for\nyou to determine your relationship with\nthe fairness of the world and for even\nif that means you know what it sucks I\nam unlucky and they are lucky and to\naccept that and say okay what am I going\nto do about it how do I succeed in a\nworld that's unfair that can be\nincredibly empowering and Incredibly\nhealthy and lead to a lot of success or\nto say you know what the world is fair\nand instead of focusing on their\nwindfall profits I am ignoring all of\nthe things that I actually have that are\nlike my advantages because that\nabsolutely happens when you engage in\njealousy when you look at other people's\nlives and you're like this person has a\nb and c it's very easy to forget that\nyou have d e and f and I'm not saying\nthat the point value of both of those\nthings is the same but it's so easy to\nlose sight of what you have in your\ncorner when you're looking at what you\ndon't have right because it's not what\nI've got in my arms I'm looking out\nthere and naturally I look at the things\nthat I don't have because those are the\nthings that I don't have and then we\nforget about what's here and then\ndespite the fact that I've actually got\nstuff all I see is unfairness in the\nworld which is like that's gonna create\nproblems so it's a really common issue\nthat we think you know oh like I'm\nincompatible with the world and I'm not\nsaying that that's fair and I'm not\nsaying that you aren't what I'm saying\nis if you really want to stop being that\nway or improve your life like I I don't\nknow how to say this like there's a\ncomponent that you control there's\nabsolutely a component that you control\nis it fair that you have to control it\nno it's incredibly sad it's incredibly\nsad and I've worked with patients who\nhave been through traumatic experiences\nand they can look at other people and be\njealous like I'm so jealous of you know\nmy friends who are able to engage in\nhealthy romantic relationships and my\ntrauma is so bad that it's so hard for\nme and when I sit with those patients I\ndon't say well you've got these\nadvantages what I say is yeah it is\nunfair what are we gonna do about it I'm\nso sorry that you had a life that this\nhappened to you and that there's been\nthis much psychological Damage Done is\nit fair absolutely not are you unlucky\nabsolutely but what you do from this day\nforward is still your choice so what are\nyou gonna do about that unfairness are\nyou gonna say oh like give up because\nsometimes my patients do that right and\nI don't even blame them and yet it's my\njob to help them stop giving up and it's\ntheir job to help themselves stop giving\nup because when once you've given up\nonce you've decided my goals are\nincompatible with the world that is an\nunsolved you've created a problem that\nis not solvable and in doing so you've\ndoomed yourself to failure so there is\nsome internal component there that\nyou've got to work with not saying it's\nfair that you have to do it it's not\nfair it's just something you got to do\nor you can choose not to do it and\ncontinue living the life that you want\nand that I don't want for anyone in this\nsituation because the bizarre thing is\nwhen people start working on it I've\nnoticed that things get better like it's\nkind of weird but sometimes they get\nbetter in spite of you right because you\nyou don't want to have to work and I get\nit like I don't know if I'm kind of\nspeaking too much here but like you wish\nthat the world was in such a way where\nyou didn't have to compromise right that\nyou didn't have to do that work you\ndidn't have to do all that extra stuff I\nget it but this is the low the world\nthat we live in and do I wish it was\ndifferent do I wish you got your\nwindfall absolutely but be a little bit\ncareful because I've worked with people\nwho have gotten windfalls and you'd be\nsurprised at how similarly they feel\nwith you\nforeign"
