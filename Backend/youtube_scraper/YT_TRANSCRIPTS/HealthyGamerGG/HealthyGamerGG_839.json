    "transcript": "so your engagement with technology\ndoesn't just have to do with laziness or\ndiscipline or you sucking at life it has\nto do with a lot of like the state of\nyour mind your internal emotional state\nyour fatigue State all those kinds of\nthings\nso I wasted five to six hours watching\nYouTube and now I don't want to do\nanything anymore\nso I've I have some homework that I\nneeded to do over the weekend but\ninstead of utilizing my time to do stuff\nI just blew five hours watching YouTube\nand now I hate myself and I don't feel\nlike I deserve anything or anyone\nI've tried to be productive several\ntimes and now that has failed I don't\nwant to do anything anymore I want to be\nperfect like everybody else when it\ncomes to their lives but I find that\nhard and I want to cry when I can't do\nanything that other people can do\nI hate my life because I'm worth nothing\nand I feel like I'm incapable of\neverything that is presented to me I\nwant to get rid of this thing of not\nbeing productive and all that this\nhappens frequently as well and I'm\nhopeless about it I hate life\nso\nsometimes\ninstead of doing what we need to do\nwe end up watching lots of YouTube or\nsomething else right play video games\nspend time on Reddit like whatever\nwhatever pick your poison\nthe truth of the matter is though\nsometimes it's like we have stuff that\nwe want to accomplish\nand YouTube kind of gets in the way\nand then what happens is when we like\nslip up right by like five hours of\nYouTube\nwe hate ourselves\nand then we don't feel like we deserve\nanything\nwe want to be perfect but we're the very\nopposite of perfect our mind becomes\nvery very black and white it's like I\ncan't believe I wasted a whole day\nI want to get rid of this thing I'm\ntired of not being productive anymore I\nwant to be productive again help me be\nproductive again\nso what do we do in this situation\nso I was kind of reading this my first\nthought is\nwell I wonder what's going on in\nsomeone's brain\nso I didn't really know I was like okay\nwhat is watching five hours of YouTube\ndo to your brain so I know like\nlong-term effects of chronic technology\nusage social media usage video games\nthings like that but at the five hour\nmark what's going on in someone's brain\nso the first thing that I did is I asked\nthat question and the answer is that I I\nsaw were actually terrifying so the\nfirst thing that we're going to do is\njust like do a quick dip into\nneuroscience\nokay\nso there's some PA we're going to talk\nabout oh yeah so let's start with this\nso there is this field called\nconsumer Neuroscience which terrifies me\nas a psychiatrist\nbecause what this means is that there's\nlike a group of people out there who are\nstudying the brain using things like\npsychometrics functional neuroimaging\nand behavioral data to figure out\nhow to get you to like buy stuff and\ncontinue using\nthe internet\nokay so the impact of motivation to\nwatch YouTube subjective Nora's\nbehavioral control information success\nmodel to watching YouTube engagement\nnow this is important\nmeasuring dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nsignals predict the success of\nmerchandising elements at the point of\nsale\nbrain activity forecasts video\nengagement in an internet attention\nmarket so here's something that\nterrifies me\nyour free will\nis now known as the internet attention\nmarket and there's a lot of research out\nthere\nabout\nhow to get people\nto like\nhow to like take this internet attention\nmarket and like engage people with it\nand sell things\nokay\nnow this is what's really interesting so\nthe key thing that I kind of took away\nfrom this that I thought was a little\nbit different\nis a lot of research on the anterior\ninsula so let's try to understand the\nNeuroscience real quick\nso here's what I I thought of when I\nlooked at this I was like okay I can\nunderstand that people get distracted\nand they don't want to you know\nstart doing homework it's boring so you\nopen up YouTube because you feel a\nlittle bit distracted but then what I\ngot kind of curious about is why do we\nwaste five hours on YouTube because it's\nnot even fun after the first hour what's\ngoing on there\nand that's when I sort of discovered\nthat there's all all kinds of\ninteresting stuff and one of the key\npieces of Neuroscience here is the\nanterior insula and the anterior insula\nis actually\nheavily involved with like\nInsight\num it's also involved with the orgasm\nwhich is kind of interesting\nbut\nit in involves like it involves a lot of\nlike awareness and like a lot of our\nConsciousness comes from the anterior\ninsula so when we're kind of thinking\nabout\nokay like what do I want to do when\nwe're like regulating ourselves when we\nthink a particular way about ourselves\nlike a lot of this like emotional\nawareness of what we're doing and like\nbeing conscious is the anterior insula\nand what we know from all this\ncommercial Neuroscience is that\nbuying things online and spending more\ntime on the Internet is inversely\ncorrelated with anterior insular\nactivity\nso what that sort of means is that the\nmore aware I am the less likely I am to\nengage in with YouTube for five hours at\na stretch\nand actually what tends to happen is as\nwe use technology what this internet\nattention Market is doing\nis finding ways to make us less aware\nand what do I mean by finding ways to\nmake us less aware so when I watch a\nparticular video\nso right now like I'm aware of my\nsurroundings what I need to do today my\nmind is tracking all kinds of stuff\nwhen I watch a video the engagement\nlevel of that video is in how much it\nallows me to forget\nright so my you know poison of the month\nthis this month is watching these like\nlike\nsurvival catching foraging eating\ncooking things with fires\nright it's like some dude who's like out\nin the wilderness who's like making\nfires and catching things and and\nhunting for food and stuff like that and\nit's like that's like when I watch that\nvideo for 30 minutes like I completely\nforget about everything else that's\ngoing on in my life\nin my anterior insula shuts down and\nthere's data that shows that the less\nactive your interior insula is the more\nlikely you are to engage in this\ninternet attention Marketplace the more\nlikely you are to watch YouTube for hour\nfour five six seven eight nine ten\nso this is like the first thing that\nyou've got to understand is that if\nyou're in this situation and you're\nblaming yourself\nfor being so lazy instead of being so\nmotivated like I don't think you really\nrealize how outgunned you really are\ndid you get a little distracted sure\nbut there's a whole emerging field of\nconsumer Neuroscience which people are\npublishing papers about and having\nconferences on and things like that\nwhere people are like literally learning\nlike like this is terrifying I'm going\nto just show you all this again\nlike look at this\none\nI don't know if y'all so\nyou know\nwe're using\nNeuro Imaging to figure out\nhow to\nengage people with point of point of\nsale devices\nright it's kind of weird\nlike there's so much stuff going on here\nthat's super terrifying\nso now let's try to understand a little\nbit about okay if I wanna like let's go\nback to the issue at hand which is I\nneed to do homework and I can't because\nI got distracted on YouTube for five\nhours so we're gonna break this apart\ninto a couple of things the first thing\nis why do we start watching something or\nstart engaging with technology the\nsecond thing is why do we persist in\nengaging with technology the third thing\nis what does long-term engagement with\ntechnology do to our brain and our\nmotivation and our self-esteem and how\ndo we pull everything how do we kind of\ntie everything together at the end okay\nso first thing why do we start using\ntechnology\nvery very very well understood I feel\nincredibly confident in what I'm about\nto say\nwhen I'm trying to do homework I don't\nwant to do the homework but chances\nwhether I do the homework or don't do\nthe homework actually depends on my\ninternal emotional state\nthe more confident in myself I feel the\nless fatigued I am\nthe less uh the the more\nI care about myself and the more\npositive emotions I feel the more likely\nI am to do the homework\nhow do we know this well we know that\nwhen we reach for technology what it\ntends to do is suppress our negative\nemotional circuitry\nand so generally speaking the worse we\nfeel about ourselves the more likely we\nare to use technology the more fatigued\nwe are the more likely we are to use\ntechnology this is part of the reason\nwhy\nespecially like a lot of these financial\ndecisions are getting worse so if you\nlook at people who are like buying\ncrypto or Wall Street bets or even like\nonline gambling sites the reason these\nall three of these things are so\nsuccessful from a provider standpoint\nwe're not talking about the purchaser\nwe're talking about like the exchange or\nyou know like like day trade uh sorry\nretail trading like Robin Hood or like\nall these things are so successful\nbecause they allow you to make decisions\nwhen you're fatigued\nso it used to be that markets were open\nonly at a particular time\nso if you wanted to make a trade you had\nto open it like you had to like go\nthrough some some hoops as well as there\nwas a particular time that you had to\nmake trades so you couldn't be like\ndrunk at 3am in the morning and spend a\nhundred thousand dollars by buying some\nmeans meme stock\nbut what we've discovered is that as our\nbrains become more dysregulated and as\nwe can make purchases in the wee hours\nof the morning when we're drunk when\nwe're High when we're tired whatever\nit leads us to make bad purchases and\npeople are profiting off of this\nso your engagement with technology\ndoesn't just have to do with laziness or\ndiscipline or you sucking at life it has\nto do with a lot of like the state of\nyour mind your internal emotional state\nyour fatigue State all those kinds of\nthings\nthat's why we start using and what our\nbrain has figured out is I feel bad\nabout myself let me engage in this\ntechnology which will self-soothe and\nshut down my negative emotional\ncircuitry\nthen what happens that's how we start\nusing technology then what happens like\nwhy do we end up using technology for\nfive hours so as technology becomes more\nengaging we start to see suppression of\nthe anterior insular cortex which is our\nawareness\nso then we don't realize that one hour\nbecame two became three became four\nbecame five\nand I love this personally in the\nturn-based strategy games right so if\nyou guys play turn-based strategy game\nyou'll understand this very well one\nmore term one more turn one more turn\nI'm going to load up a game of civ4 fall\nfrom Heaven at 5 pm on a Friday and I'm\ngoing to come back to awareness Saturday\nmorning at dawn\nright that's what technology does we\nlose that insular cortex stuff\nthen what happens is we blame ourselves\nbecause now it's like oh my god I've\nstayed up all night I'm so undisciplined\nand then what happens is we start to\nhate ourselves\nokay\nlike look at this language incapable of\neverything\nI want to be perfect I've tried to be\nproductive\nand so all of that negative emotion\ncomes roaring back\nand when all that negative emotion comes\nroaring back\nthat in turn leads to things like\nprocrastination because it's hard to\nfocus on homework when internally you're\nfilled with self-loathing\nright like that kind of makes sense\nright the more self-loathing I feel the\nharder it is to do homework\nand then we call this thing\nprocrastination but what we know is that\na lot of procrastination has to do with\nincorrect emotional processing and\nincorrect emotional awareness\nwe just call it procrastination because\nwe're not even aware of what we feel on\nthe inside\nand at the end of the cycle we feel so\nbad about ourselves that we're teeing\nourselves up for failure next time\naround\nso once I feel really terrible about\nmyself do I sit there and process up my\nemotions talk to my friends go see a\ntherapist work with a coach do I like\nlike actually like take this kind of\nsituation and and like really work\nthrough it and undo all the emotional\ndamage of course not\nI make a post on the internet\npeople give me like Solutions they're\nlike hey use this task management system\nwhich can be useful don't get me wrong\nbut none of that emotional stuff gets\naddressed\nand if none of that emotional stuff gets\naddressed you can use whatever task\nmanagement systems you want to if you\nwake up in the morning and you feel like\nyou're a waste of a human being it's\ngoing to get really hard to be motivated\nright because what kind of stuff\nmotivates people\ninspiration motivates people excitement\nmotivates people confidence motivates\npeople\nbut at the end of this whole cycle we're\nbeating ourselves up we have a bunch of\nnegative emotion and the whole cycle\nrepeats\nso what do you do in this kind of\nsituation so a couple of simple things\nthe first is recognize your black and\nwhite thinking\nso if you're thinking in All or Nothing\nstatements if you're saying\nyou know I'm I'm a complete waste of\nspace other people are perfect I can't\nsucceed in anything I do\nblack and white thinking is a sign of\nemotional activity in the amygdala in\nthe hippocampus it means that you're\nemotionally charged and you're not\nthinking logically it means you're\nthinking emotionally\nright so if you think about people who\nuse a lot of black and white language\nthey're very emotional thinkers they\nthink they're logical but they're really\nnot logical right because like the truth\nof the matter is the world is a nuanced\nplace and very few things are black and\nwhite\nlike it's just not how reality is\nthere is an a religion that is better\nthan all the other religions or a\nreligion that is worse than all the\nother religions\nmaybe that's a charge statement that's\ngoing to get invoke a lot of black and\nwhite thinking and engage emotions if\nyou responded to that and now you feel\nemotions you'll kind of see what I'm\nsaying\nright but people who talk that way tend\nto be very black and white thinkers and\nif you challenge them on that they will\nget very emotional\nthey'll use logic sure but like behind\nthe logic is a bunch of emotion\nand so you've got to decompress that\nemotion\nso notice the black and white thinking\nand then start to ask yourself okay how\ndid I start to feel so bad about myself\nstart to notice a little bit about when\nI'm sitting down to do homework how do I\nfeel about that\nand this is the key thing if you're if\nyou're one of these people I can\nguarantee you what you're going to say\nin that moment is who cares how I feel\nI need to do it\nwho cares what I feel and it's by making\nthat statement you lose emotional\nawareness because now you're not\nexploring it you're actively devaluing\nit and when you actively devalue it and\nwhen you actively suppress it and ignore\nit then it starts to manifest in other\nways like procrastination lack of\nmotivation spending five hours watching\nYouTube\nbecause negative emotions have to be\ndealt with\nthey will deal with you and keep dealing\nwith you until you deal with them\nso you've got to become more emotionally\naware become aware of your black and\nwhite thinking start to ask yourself\nquestions like how do I feel about doing\nhomework today do I want to do it do I\nnot want to do it\nwhy don't I want to do it well I need to\ndo it who cares what I want well like I\ncare what you want right what you want\nshould be important to you and oddly\nenough by acknowledging what you want or\nwhat you care about\nand giving that value you actually make\nit easier to do the task\nI'll give you all a simple example\nso let's say that\nI'll just give you all kind of an\nexample so I I was out a couple weekends\nago with my kids\nand one of them wanted to eat something\nthat wasn't available\nokay so they're like Dad I want this\nfood\nand then I've got two options I can say\nI don't care what you want you're gonna\neat what we give you\nright you have to eat what we have what\nwe've got like we've only got one thing\nwe can't get it so like I don't really\nit doesn't matter what you want you've\ngot to eat what we give you or I can say\nhey I understand what you want I'm sorry\nI can't give it to you\nI'll do my best to get it for you next\ntime\nbut I didn't know that you wanted that\nearlier and I'd really appreciate it if\nyou ate this anyway\nand I'm going to do my level best to get\nit for you next time\nhow does that sound\nwhich one do you think leads to like\nbetter success\nin both cases the kid may end up eating\nit but in one case they're going to eat\nway better than the other\nright\ndoes that kind of make sense so we have\nto acknowledge like and this is where\nlike sometimes\nyou know we make sacrifices because we\nhave to make sacrifices but it's really\nnice to acknowledge the sacrifice\nand be honest about it right\nit's really nice to say hey like I'm\nsorry that you have to do this\nit really sucks\nI really appreciate that you're doing it\nI'm grateful\nlike that's going to lead to better\nstuff down the road but that's not how\nwe talk to ourselves\nneed to do it\nwhen you need to do something over the\nweekend you're going to end up\nprocrastinating until the last minute\nit's how it works\nso unfortunately it's really common to\nlike get ourselves distracted\nwith technology usage it turns out\nthere's a lot going on in the brain\nit starts with why we start to use a\ntechnology which tends to be the most\ncommon reason is like emotional\nsuppression\nand not having to face our emotions then\nwe get sucked into it and we blame\nourselves for watching it for five hours\nwhen we don't even acknowledge that\nthere's a whole\nton of like people who are doing\nconsumer Neuroscience to keep you there\nfor five hours\nthere are people with phds and MDS and\neconomists and all kinds of stuff\nworking to keep you on that website for\nfive hours because there's an attention\nMarketplace and what is being bought or\nsold in the attention Marketplace you\nare\nand then we blame ourselves\nand with a complete lack of compassion\nand a lot of black and white thinking\nand self-blame we set ourselves up for\nfailure tomorrow because then tomorrow\nif I'm a POS who wastes all my time\nwatching YouTube and I'm filled with\nself-loathing how am I ever going to be\ninspired to actually like do my homework\nnever gonna happen it's going to be a a\nslog\nevery single time every single time you\nbring yourself to do your homework it's\nlike you're dragging cattle\nit's so hard\nand then since it takes so much effort\nfor you to even do homework for a little\nwhile you're mentally fatigued mentally\nexhausted and then what do you think you\nreach for\ntechnology because now you're fatigued\nand so it's super super challenging\nunfortunately increasingly common and\nwhy is it increasingly common is it\nbecause people are becoming lazier and\nmore disciplined on the whole no\nit is because there is an attention\nMarketplace which people are getting\nvery Savvy to in learning how to\nmanipulate and they realize that if you\nspend six hours on YouTube instead of\ntwitch\nor twitch instead of tick tock\none of those platforms gets money and\nthe other two don't\nand all the platforms want money\nand they're happy\nto\ngive you the content that you want to I\ndon't think necessarily the platform's\nare nefarious by the way\nI think a lot of times the platforms are\nout there trying to like do good\nthey're like hey we're just entertainers\nright we're not worried about that kind\nof stuff but as this stuff is evolving\nit's starting to get out of control and\nsometimes we end up being the victims\nand that's where you can rage at the\nplatforms all you want to I don't know\nhow effective that's going to be this is\nwhere ultimately I think you've got to\nunderstand what's going on in my mind\nand what can I do about it\nso hopefully that helps if you're\nstruggling with productivity and end up\nyou know using a technology platform for\nlike six hours and procrastinating"
