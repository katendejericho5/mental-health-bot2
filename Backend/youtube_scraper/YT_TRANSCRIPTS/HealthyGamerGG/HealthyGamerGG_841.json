    "transcript": "which by definition means that instead\nof having people who excel at their jobs\nwe end up with a whole company where\neveryone is mediocre\nlet's take a look at some ADHD tick\ntocks on burnout\nvery excited to offer you the\nopportunity to take on more\nresponsibility here you mean like a\npromotion like an opportunity oh my God\nI'm very excited to offer you the\nopportunity to take on more\nresponsibility here you mean like a\npromotion like an opportunity like an\nunpaid promotion so you get it yeah okay\nI was really hoping\nwe are going to fill that role with an\nexternal hire who we're going to offer\njust like and obscene compensation\npackage okay honestly though like like\nan embarrassing amount of money right I\ncan't offer you an interview though to\nkeep your hopes up so you'll take on all\nthe roles responsibilities while we look\nfor a replacement if I do a good job\nmaybe you will give me the permission\nabsolutely not I intend to keep you in\nyour current role at your current salary\nuntil you burn out and quit of course\nyeah yeah cool\nI'm all right so this is great for a\nnumber of reasons\num so first let's understand like how\naccurate this is so I think this can be\nvery accurate so in my experience there\nare two kinds of companies some\ncompanies will do this where they'll\nsort of figure out that someone is in a\nparticular role and it's more trouble\nthan it's worth\nto move that person out of a role\nand then like find a replacement so\nlet's just think about this let's say\nthat there's like a managerial position\nthat opens up at your company and you\nwant to get promoted so right now they\nhave to fill and train one role right\nbecause even if you get promoted you're\ngoing to have new responsibilities\nthere's going to be an onboarding\nprocess there may be some other Dynamics\nat play so like let's say you've got\nfive different colleagues and you get\npromoted and now they're reporting into\nyou that can create different kinds of\ntrouble\nso if they promote you not only do they\nhave to onboard and do that kind of\nstuff but they also have to potentially\nfill your role that is now vacated so\nnow they have to onboard two people so\nthere are kind of two transitions so\nsometimes companies kind of think like\nthis and they will you know they'll kind\nof do this sort of stuff the other thing\nis that sometimes companies do want to\ngive people opportunities to do extra\nunpaid stuff\nand that's one of the ways in which\ncompanies\nwant or give people opportunities to\ndistinguish themselves and that's where\nI'd say like we've got to be a little\nbit careful here because there are two\nkinds of companies that I've seen\none is like okay this is actually an\nopportunity for you to distinguish\nyourself and here's the key thing\nif you do a good job at distinguishing\nyourself what is the outcome\nbecause for some places that actually\nresults in hey we really noticed that\nyou went above and beyond so you were\nactually like that's an advantage for\npromotions raises new projects\nEtc moving over to this other team like\nthere are actually advantages to going\nabove and beyond the challenge is that\nthere are some companies that expect\npeople to go above and beyond for no\nadditional stuff even like\nlongitudinally and overtime and they\nexpect everyone to do extra unpaid stuff\nyou know and that's just kind of like\nhow it is\nthe other thing to keep in mind which I\nthink we got kind of got to say is that\nI think a lot of tick tocks like this\nthey resonate with a lot of people but I\nthink there are other perspectives to\nconsider here\nthe first is that sometimes if you're\nlet's just talk about outside hires so\nI'm going to just tunnel down into this\nso if there's a managerial spot that\nopens up and you work at a particular\ncompany you may think okay like they\nshould promote from within and like I'm\na good candidate so this is where\nsometimes like unfortunately like\npromoting from within is not actually\nthe best option so I'll give you all\njust a simple example so I've worked\nwith real estate Developers for example\nthat have real estate agents that are\nlike really good at sales and a\nmanagerial position opens up and so\npeople may think like okay like so I\nshould be first in line to be promoted\nbecause I do a really really good job at\nsales\nthe challenge though is that that\npromoting people within a company\nactually oftentimes changes their\nresponsibilities and just because\nsomeone did really good at their current\njob doesn't mean that they'll actually\nadapt well to the responsibilities of\nthe promotion\nso if you're good at sales like you may\nnot be as good at managing as you are at\nsales and you can look at someone like\nMichael Scott as a prime example of that\nright that's fictitious but it's based\nin reality there's another really\ninteresting aspect here called the Peter\nPrinciple\nwhich is sort of tongue-in-cheek I don't\nknow how data based it is but it's this\nidea that we promote people to the level\nof their incompetence\nand I know that sounds kind of weird but\nwhat that sort of presumes is that most\npeople at companies are not ideally\nsuited for the job that they have and\nhere's how the Peter Principle Works\nlet's say I'm really great at sales I\nexcel\nI do really fantastic I distinguish\nmyself I get promoted to a manager if I\nexcel at being a manager what happens I\nget promoted to let's say VP or c-suite\nor something like that but if I do a\nmediocre job as as a manager what\nactually happens is I never get promoted\nand I just kind of stagnate there which\nmeans that what we're selecting for is\nthe people who do really really good at\njob a actually get promoted out of it\nuntil they start doing mediocre and once\nthey start doing mediocre they sort of\nstay there because they're not able to\ndistinguish themselves which by\ndefinition means that instead of having\npeople who excel at their jobs we end up\nwith a whole company where everyone is\nmediocre so it's a really interesting\nprinciple and something to kind of think\nabout when you're sort of considering\npromotion\none thing that I would highly highly\nrecommend is that if you're interested\nin getting internally promoted you\nreally think a little bit about what\nthat\nwhat how that job skill sets may be\ndifferent from your own and make a\nstrong case not on the work that you've\ndone but why you would be a good fit for\nthat position\nand so that's it's a it's a good good\ntake though I think sometimes\nunfortunately this is absolutely the\ncase where they'll just sort of give you\na pro forma interview to kind of like\nkeep you there I have absolutely seen\npredatory companies like that\nonly one cup I don't know why it came\nout like that what's up\nquite quitting I have heard yep\nbasically an idea that people are burnt\nout so they're not actually quitting\ntheir jobs but they're quitting going\nabove and beyond so they're not letting\ntheir job take over their life\nwhat do I think I don't love the quiet\npart but I get it\nwhat employees gonna tell their boss I'm\ntoo stressed I need help finding balance\nnot enough\nso they either stay stressed or they\nactually quit or they take steps to\ndecide to do it themselves and quite\nquit\ndo I think our people are I don't know\nbut a good way would be to bring it up\ntake out the quiet part I bet a ton of\nexecutives are having this same\nconversation but not raising it to\nemployees\nwhat if you were to ask employees what\ndo you think about quiet quitting many\nmight be shocked that you're bringing it\nup at all\nbut managers have to be open to finding\nways to have conversations about\nproductivity having their own lives\nI'm happy to write out what they can say\nthis is not a wing it topic hey Luke so\nthat's actually really fantastic I love\nthis person's take on it because they're\ntalking about actually engaging in\nconversation\nso here's the problem that we've created\nwith the term quiet quitting\nso do employers want their employees to\nquiet quit\nright like if you think about it that\nsounds like a fireable offense\nand so even with the phrase quiet\nquitting what you've done is make it\nhard to actually engage in a\nconversation\nbecause it's like hey like who here is\nquiet quitting like what employee is\ngoing to raise their hand when they're\nlike yeah I'm quiet quitting and what\ndoes quiet quitting mean it just means\nnot going above and beyond it means just\ndoing your job which by the way is also\nreally bizarre because why on Earth are\nwe calling doing your job quitting since\nwhen did doing your actual job become\nquitting like what the hell is going on\nhere this whole phrase is like so\nproblematic and we've started to call\nokay yeah these guys are quitters what\ndo you mean quitters how are they\nquitting well they're just doing their\njob it's like what the hell\nthat's not quitting that's doing your\njob the whole phrase is so\nmisdirected misunderstood and\num I don't know how to say this like\nit's like\nit's damning\nso you can't have a conversation about\nit which is what I think this person is\nkind of alluding to is that people need\nto learn how to have conversations about\nit\nthe other thing to consider about quiet\nquitting is why are people quiet\nquitting this is important I don't think\nit's always because of burnout so\nburnout is on the rise and people not\ngoing above and beyond is on the rise\ndoes that mean that the two are related\nthey can be but here's the biggest\nreason that I see for quiet quitting\nso when you go above and beyond\nwhat do you get in return\nif you don't get promoted if you don't\nget a raise if you don't get recognition\nwhy would you continue going above and\nbeyond\nit's not burnout it's just pavlovian\nso when someone puts in extra effort if\nthat effort is recognized that's ideal\nright and if people if that effort isn't\nrecognized then people are going to stop\ndoing it\nright\nnow there's an interesting thing that we\nfound in coaching which is that there\ncan be a cognitive bias at play here\nwhere everyone thinks they're doing\nextra whereas sometimes what they're\nsort of doing is like\nthat's not really extra it can actually\nbe part of their job or they're doing a\nlot this is the other thing that we see\nso often in in career coaching is that\npeople are doing extra that doesn't\nactually like the company doesn't value\nor people don't really care about and in\nthat case I think it's totally fine to\nnot invest that effort I mean we'll\nadvocate for people to think about what\nthe company actually cares about and\ninvest extra in a way that the company\nwill appreciate as opposed to just\ninvesting extra\nbut I think this is like a really really\nimportant point to kind of think about\nand I think the whole phrase is so\ndamning that it's very hard to talk\nabout and like I don't know when doing\nyour job how we started calling doing\nyour job quitting\nit's like I can see how\nthis phrase has caught on so much\nbecause I think there's a group of\nmanagers out there who fundamentally\nbelieve their employees are lazy\nand if you're a manager who\nfundamentally believes your employee is\nlazy having them do their job\nis quitting in your eyes and somewhere\nalong the way what's also happened is\nthat going above and beyond has become\nthe standard\nright where it's like oh everyone like\nwe want go-getters we want people to go\nabove and beyond I think going above and\nbeyond honestly I think it's great like\nI I don't I I gotta be honest with y'all\nso when I was in med school I tried to\ngo above and beyond when I was in\nresidency I tried to go above and beyond\nhere at HG I tried to go above and\nbeyond I still try to go above and\nbeyond\nI think it's good it's just you need to\nhave a relationship where people\nrecognize that and you go above and\nbeyond in a way that is understood and\nhopefully appreciated\nthree signs or cortisol levels are high\npart two hi my name is Christine Cohen\nI'm a mental health dietitian who helps\nstress professionals overcome burnout\nnaturally in their 30s the first one is\nany level of anxiety so that is chronic\nanxiety that any level of anxiety is a\nsign of high cortisol you experience at\na mild level all the way up to anxiety\nand\nsecond is finding yourself feeling\nreally frustrated really irritated often\nall the way up to exploding rage this is\na sign that your cortisol levels are\nhigh\nand the third is intense cravings for\ncarbs sugar salty and even alcohol\nthroughout the day but definitely later\nin the day and after dinner if you\nexperience these symptoms often it's a\nsign that you're living in fight or\nflight mode and your cortisol levels are\nimbalanced\nto learn more about why this is\nhappening and how to naturally balance\nyourself back out go download my free\nguide and learn more\nso I'm not sure so this person is a\ndietitian so they may know more about\nthis than I do but some of the some\nstuff about this like makes me kind of\nconcerned\num so the first is that I'm not quite\nsure if they're talking about cortisol\nor they're talking about burnout\nor if they assume that the two are\nautomatically linked so I know this\nsounds kind of weird and this person may\nknow more about this than I do but like\nI'm not sure that hyper cortisol and\nburnout are actually like correlated it\nmakes sense that they are because\nburnout is sort of a high stress State\nyou have a high level of cortisol and\nthere's a lot of stuff here that I think\nis scientifically like it you know it\nsounds like they really know what\nthey're talking about in terms of\ncraving of of carbohydrates and stuff\nthat can be consistent with cortisol\nbut when they say any level of anxiety\nI'm That Kind of confuses me because I\nthink like anxiety like mild anxiety and\nfeeling anxiety is not a sign of\nhypercholesterolemia or Addison's\ndisease and I mean it can be\nright so like anxiety is one of the\nmanifestations of high cortisol but this\nis once again I think this isn't so much\nabout this person as it is about Tick\nTock which is like\nyou know I think some degree of anxiety\nis within the normal range of Human\nExperience\nand so I I'm just not sure when I when I\nwatch stuff like this I don't know if\nthis person uh you know if this is I'd\nlike to think that this is a restriction\nof the platform because in 56 seconds\nhow can you accurately explain cortisol\nburnout anxiety and help people\nunderstand what's going on could it be a\nhigh cortisol level sure could it be a\nburnout level uh burnout sure\nbut some of this stuff this is what kind\nof makes me a little bit hesitant about\nthis kind of stuff is I don't know what\nexactly this person is referring to I\ndon't really know how scientific it is\nbut it does seem like they do this kind\nof work and so they've had a lot of like\ngood outcomes with their clients is what\nI'm assuming and by the way that can be\ncompletely valid too because oftentimes\nwhat you see is that before you have\nscientific evidence of an intervention\nyou'll have people out there working\nwith human beings who will develop a\nhigh level of confidence in the\nintervention that happens before\nscientific validation\na great example of that is meditation\nso why do we have research studies on\nmeditation it's because a bunch of\npeople like in the 60s learned how to\nmeditate and they're like wow this is\nactually amazing and will help with\nanxiety and depression and at that point\nscientists would have said you're full\nof BS and so then what people happen\nwhat happened is they actually made\nstudies about it so it's not uncommon\nfor people who are in a clinical role or\nthis person seems like a dietitian to\nactually make discoveries about what\nhelps people prior to Scientific\nevidence\nso something to just keep in mind you\nknow so I'd say just take it with a\ngrain of salt sounds like their heart is\nin the right place they may know more\nabout it than I do but I'm a little bit\nskeptical of some of the generalizations\nthat they make\nI think one of the saddest parts of\nworking with people who are experiencing\nburnout is that when you ask them like\nwhat they want like I asked them what\nthey wish they were including it is such\nreasonable things it's like I want to\nhave time to eat breakfast and lunch I\nwant to get off of work before 6 PM I\nwant to have time on the weekends\nwithout feeling guilt for not catching\nup on work I want to spend time with\nfriends and family I don't want to have\ntrouble sleeping because I have so much\nanxiety like very reasonable human\nthings burnout is not just stress in the\nworkplace it's what that stress in the\nworkplace costs you it's just very\nunfair because burnout is like that the\nmeeting point of industry and industry's\nbottom line and just people like people\ntrying to do their best especially like\nhigh Achievers and people Pleasers who\nwant to make those companies happy not\nrealizing that no amount of work from\nthem would be enough\nso this is really interesting so I think\nthe it highlights something and I'm\ncurious kind of what y'all think about\nthis but\nif burnout is the intersection of people\nPleasers and companies\nwhere do you think the fault lies\nright like let's just think about that\nfor a second\num and let's take a quick look at the\nnext one\nthis one I think we're gonna go\nso\nso I think this this really highlights\nkind of a good point so when I'm asking\nlike okay who's at fault here people are\nsaying some people are saying mostly\ncompanies\nand some people are saying both here's\nour experience with burnout and there's\nscience to kind of back this up\nso I think the biggest problem with\nburnout that's going on right now is\nthat companies are blaming employees and\nthey're saying oh burnout is something\nthat you need to handle so we're going\nto give you a free subscription to a\nmindfulness app so that you can meditate\nand be less burnt out\nand employees are blaming companies and\nthey're saying your work environment is\nso stressful\nlike you're the reason that I'm burnt\nout and my company always asks for more\nalways ask for more always ask for more\nand I'm a people pleaser\nso here's the wild thing that we've\ndiscovered and this is based on science\nso the first thing is let's start with\nthe science so burnout is the\nintersection\nof job plus personal\nand if you all have seen like our\ninterviews like we did an interview with\na a developer who's burnt out at the\nlast four companies that they've\nworked at\nand what we tend to find is oh if\nsomeone's a people pleaser\nand like let's say your boss is like\nreally nice boss\nand it's like hey we've got a like\nsomething else that's kind of come in\nthe pipeline there's a possible deal\nanyone have anyone interested in kind of\ntaking it on\nand then the people pleaser is like yeah\nme and they're like okay cool you want\nto take it on go for it\nand then a week later a boss is like hey\nwe've got something else coming on like\nanyone interested in taking it on people\npleaser is like or the boss asks like\nhey do you have bandwidth for an\nadditional product project\npeople pleaser is like I'm not allowed\nto say no I'm afraid of what my boss\nwill think when I say no so I'm gonna\nsay yes\neven though they don't have the\nbandwidth\nand so from the boss's perspective let's\nassume for a moment the boss is nice\nhe or she is a nice boss and they're\nactually genuinely asking hey are you\nlike at capacity or do you have space\nfor something else you tell me if you\ntell me you're at capacity it's totally\nfine like I'm not going to think any\nless of you I respect you as an employee\nI respect your ability to manage your\nown work you're hard working you're not\na slacker so I am trusting you to tell\nme where you are\nI'm actually trusting and respecting you\nbut the people pleaser\nis like I never want to say no to\nanything because that makes me feel bad\non the inside\nso this is the harsh discovery that we\nmade when we work with people who are\nburnt out and we've worked with a lot of\nthem is that a lot of it is internal\nhalf of it is internal half of it is\ncompany\nand what we do is we work with people to\nhelp them understand okay like if you're\na people pleaser the solution is not for\nyou know corporations I mean I guess\nthat they could be we've done some\nConsulting in that it's a corporate you\nknow companies to like adapt to some\nhuman beings who are people pleasing the\nreal solution and I say this is a\nclinician who's worked with tons of\npeople Pleasers is like if you're people\npleasing in your job you're also people\npleasing in your personal relationships\nyou're also people pleasing like in your\nyou know friendships\nparental relationships family\nrelationships\nromantic relationships and so if you're\na people pleaser at the cost of yourself\nbecause you don't value yourself like\nthat's something that needs to be\nchanged on you\nthere are absolutely toxic elements from\nthe corporate world don't get me wrong\nwho will take advantage of people\nPleasers\nand I encourage you all to like watch\nthe interviews and stuff because what\nwe've really seen is that fixing burnout\nis addressing some things at the company\nlevel but it's also addressing a lot of\nthings at the individual level and to be\nblunt we see far far far better outcomes\naddressing things at the individual\nlevel than we do at addressing things at\nthe company level\nbecause if we address things at an\nindividual level if we can take a people\npleaser and have them stop being a\npeople pleaser they're going to do way\nbetter way faster than trying to do a\ncorporate training that gets managers to\nunderstand people Pleasers\nso the unit of change when we focus on\nthe individual\nwhat we find is that the yield is a lot\nbetter right so it's like okay like\nlet's say that we've got someone who\nstruggles to eat healthy\nwhat we can do is we can absolutely go\nto a government FDA and we can say hey\nyou all have to change advertising you\nneed to add this nutrition facts you\nneed to put warnings on food you have to\ndo this and this and this to warn people\nof the dangers you have to make it hard\nfor people to buy this stuff we need to\nincrease the taxes on sodas we need to\ndo all of this worldwide stuff to help\npeople who eat in an unhealthy way I\nthink all that stuff is fantastic\nbut if you are someone who struggles to\neat healthy I would encourage you I\ndon't think you can wait for all that to\nhappen\nthat the people who end up eating\nhealthy are the ones who make a personal\nchange now does that absolve everyone\nelse's responsibility no what I'm\ntalking about is efficacy not fairness\nnot responsibility\nI think it's unfair\nand what are we going to do about it\nso you have to work a little bit\non your own right\nand so what we try to do is we help\npeople first of all understand okay are\nyou people pleaser and then even like\nrole play dialogue out how do you have a\nconversation with your manager because\nif your manager is actually nice the\ncool thing about this\nis that if your manager is nice you can\nactually go to them and say hey I have a\ntendency to like people please and so\nhere's a sample dialogue that I would\nencourage right so these are the kinds\nof things that we'll talk people through\nso how do you talk to your manager about\nbeing a people pleaser\nreal quick if you go to your manager and\nyou say hey I really enjoy working for\nyou I think you're a fantastic person I\nlike my job here\none of the things that I really struggle\nwith is that anytime someone at this job\nasks for help I have difficulty saying\nno but I actually think that I get too\nmuch on my plate and it stresses me out\nI wanna I wanna help out I want this\ncompany to succeed I want to look good\nmyself I want to make you look good I I\nwant the mission of the company let's\nsay I work at a hospital right so I care\nabout patients\nand I want to help out my fellow nurses\nwhen something you know when there's\nlike a shortfall in nursing but what I'm\nnoticing is that like it's hard for me\nto say no and I'm getting like really\nreally stressed out and it's like\nimpacting my work can you help me with\nthis can you help me set boundaries\naround a healthy level of work\nand it's amazing when you go to your\nyou're not saying hey I'm lazy\nhey y'all are taking advantage of me\nyou're an evil Corporation you're like\nhey\nthis is something that I really struggle\nwith will you help me and what's really\nawesome is like most managers will be\nlike absolutely we'd love to help you\nokay let's think about this\nhow can we set limits on how much you\nactually work I'm going to talk to the\ncharge nurse about this let's try to\nfigure out like what's a good plan\nbecause most people are like good human\nbeings the problem is we're never taught\nhow to approach these conversations\nand we just are like oh like the the\nhospital is predatory like it may be\ntrue but I don't think that you're I\nmean sometimes you have a toxic boss but\ngenerally speaking like people want to\nhelp each other out right because your\nboss may be a people pleaser too do you\never think about that and if you come to\nthem and you say hey I'm stressed out\nyour boss being a people pleaser is like\noh no\nlet me fix that for you\nright because if you're a people pleaser\nand you go the extra while what happens\nyou get up you get promoted to being the\nboss\nand did the people pleaserness go away\nof course not\nmake sense\nokay\nquestions\nso trash can Raider is saying I think\nyou're overestimating people\nMaybe\nit hasn't been my experience so I'm\nestimating People based on my experience\nand what I've learned is that\nwhen you over when you think if you\nthink I'm overestimating colleagues or\npeople what I've really found is that\neffective communication\nor ineffective communication will result\nin how people respond to you\nso I can understand why you're like oh\nyou're overestimating people because\nwhen I talk to people it doesn't work\nlike that so that's where I challenge\nyou a little bit I'm not saying that\nyou're wrong\nright so my first job was like serving\nup ice cream and I've had other like\nkind of basic labor sort of jobs over\nthe years\nso I've done that kind of work but I'm\nalso now for the last like decade in a\nposition that has a lot of professional\nrespect\nso my life is gonna like my experience\nis gonna be different I've worked with a\nton of people though and what I really\nfound is that\nthere's a right way to talk to people\nand when you talk to people the right\nway then it really helps or improves\nyour chances\nbut I've absolutely heard my fair share\nof horror stories\nand situations where talking to your\nboss about how you're stressed out and\nyou have this difficulty causes them to\nlike hop on and say okay cool let's take\nadvantage of that\nI'm not saying\nI'm not I I I'm not saying you all are\nwrong I'm just saying it's\nyou have to be careful about\nassuming the world is a particular way\nand that effort or change or learning\nsomething new on your part is not going\nto change that\nthank you\nit's challenging\nokay\nso real Riker is asking how do you\nmanage your burnout when you might be\nexpected to work even late to get stuff\ndone\nso that's a great question\nso what I would say is where does that\nexpectation come from\nwhere is the expectation that you have\nto work late\nthat's how you challenge it from the\nbeginning so if you have to work late\nwhy is that there could be all kinds of\nreasons that you have to work late I've\nhad to work late\nso some of that is like learning curve\nso is it temporary or is it that you\nhave difficulty with something that most\npeople in your job don't have difficulty\nwith\nso for example\nyou know I had a colleague who was\ndyslexic and so Physicians take notes\nand so we have to like take notes and we\nhave to do like documentation and that\nmay be for some of us it would take an\nhour for this person it would take an\nhour and a half\nand so sometimes things are just going\nto take longer for you and that you know\nis that where the expectation comes from\nor is the default that oh like this is a\nnormal amount of work and people have to\nwork 14 hours a day and that's just\naccepted so some Industries are like\nthat like banking\nworking late is a part of the job\nand how does banking make up for it they\ncompensate you with hundreds of\nthousands or millions of dollars per\nyear and it's just an expectation that\nlike hey you're going to work your ass\noff and we're going to pay you a lot\nyou're going to burn out you're going to\nstress\nthis is the trade\nso it just depends I would say where is\nthat expectation of you working late\ncoming from\nuh Prime is asking question as part of\nburnout related to lack of community\num yes so there are six scientific\nfactors that contribute to burnout and I\nthink lack of community or isolation is\nabsolutely one of them\nall right shall we move on to\num great catching you at twitchcon by\nthe way Prime\nbut does it have to be that way in the\nbanking industry I personally don't\nthink so but people in the banking and\nas many people high up in the banking\nindustry disagree with me there's\nsomething really interesting going on in\nthe banking industry right now which is\nthat we're seeing a very very subtle\nshift to\nso the standard in the banking industry\nis that you work people to the Bone\nand then turnover rates are really\nreally high so what happens is like\nyou've got people you're like I want you\nto work 100 hours a week and a bunch of\npeople are going to try some people are\ngoing to excel\nand when they Excel like you're gonna\npromote them\nyou're going to give them a lot of money\nbut then what's what happens a lot is\nthat person the grass is going to be\ngreener on the other side so they're\ngoing to go somewhere else because\nthey're your they're your golden child\nat your bank so they go to some other\nbank and they're like hey I'm The Golden\nChild over here what will y'all give me\nand then another the other bank says\nokay we'll give you like 50 more golden\nchild comes back to your bank and is\nlike hey\nthese people are offering me 50 more can\nyou all match it and you're like no we\ncan't match it and then the person\nleaves so what actually happens in in\nbanking is that\nthere's a real retention problem for\nyour best employees there's also a\nretention problem for your not best\nemployees because you've got a golden\nchild who you're struggling to keep and\nmaybe you pay them 50 more and then\nyou've got the other four people in\ntheir cohort who are not golden children\nwho are getting paid less now\n66 percent of what the golden child is\ngetting\nand so they'll end up leaving too\nbecause they don't think it's fair\nbecause Golden Child is working 100\nhours a week they're working 100 hours a\nweek one person is getting paid 50 more\nso they leave so turnover is a huge huge\nproblem in banking\neveryone's moving around all the time\nwhat we're starting to see is there's a\nsmall crop of people who really care\nabout building a team and care about the\nhumans\nand what they've really discovered which\nis crazy is that if someone enjoys\nworking for you they'll actually turn\ndown 50 more money\nto\nstay with you because the toxicity isn't\nworth the money and you may be thinking\nthat's crazy 50 more money but at some\npoint like money has diminishing returns\nfor some people\nfor some people it doesn't and it's just\nthe more the better it's a way to keep\nscore in life so we're starting to see\nI'm starting to see this change in\nbanking where like some people actually\ngenuinely care they work less they don't\nwork people to the Bone you're allowed\nto have kids whenever you want it's\ntotally fine we're going to support you\nand that's worth so much"
