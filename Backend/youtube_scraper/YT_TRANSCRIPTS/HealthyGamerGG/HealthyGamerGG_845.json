    "video_title": "Therapist Explains Why You Don't Feel Anything Anymore... (Alexithymia 101)",
    "transcript": "attachment is how we learn what we feel\non the inside so a child early on\ndoesn't know what they're feeling right\nso if I'm an 18 month old and I'm\nwalking around and I Stumble and fall do\nI feel hurt should I panic or should I\nlaugh and if the adults in the room are\nterrified oh my God little Timmy fell\ndown then the child starts crying he's\nlike oh crap today what we're going to\ntalk about is Alexa thymia so Alexa\nthyme is the inability to experience\nyour internal emotional state and what I\nkind of view this as is almost like an\nemotional color blindness so a lot of\ntimes what we don't really realize but a\nlot of our problems actually come from\nan inability to experience our internal\nemotional state we're not really aware\nof what we're feeling on the inside and\nthere's actually a lot of science that\nshows that being unaware of what you're\nfeeling can lead to all kinds of\nproblems so alexithymia has been\nassociated with problems with motivation\nand finding direction and purpose in\nlife so so if you're someone who kind of\nlike is going through life but you're\nnot really sure you know what's the\npoint like you don't know why you're on\nthis Earth You don't really like you\nlook around at other people and you see\nlike oh these people are so motivated\nlike they get up every day and they're\nstriving for something but I get up\nevery day and it's just kind of like a\nhaze right I don't know really why I'm\nhere I'm just sort of existing instead\nof living and that's actually been tied\nto alexithymia we also find that Alexa\nthymia is a common culprit in a lot of\npsychological problems so leads to\nproblems or not leads to but exacerbates\nproblems like addiction so people who\nare Lexa thymic are more prone to\naddiction will even dive into a lot of\nmy clinical experience with working with\npeople with addiction which I don't know\nif you all have struggled with this\nyourself or maybe you have a friend who\nwill say yeah I was doing great I was\nlike sober for six months and then I\ndon't know what happened I just relapsed\none day and it was out of the blue but\nwhat you'll really discover when you\nwork with those people is it really\nwasn't out of the blue and what was\nactually going on is that there were\nslight emotional stressors that were\nbuilding up over time building up over\ntime building up over time this really\ngood Neuroscience to support this and\nthen when those stressors got\noverwhelming the person ended up\nrelapsing and remember that these people\nare colorblind to this which is why they\ndon't really they're not aware of it\nthey think everything is fine even\nthough problems are building in the\nbackground and Alexa thyme is also a\nculprit for problems in relationships so\nwhat we tend to find is that when we\ndon't understand what we're feeling it\ncreates all kinds of stresses in\nrelationships we start to send mixed\nsignals because someone asks us hey is\nit okay if I you know go to this party\nwithout you and you're like yeah it's\nfine like whatever and then you kind of\nfeel resentful but you don't know how to\nvocalize that resentment you feel\nashamed for feeling that resentment and\nso as a result it kind of sabotages your\nrelationship because you said it was\nokay but now you're punishing this\nperson for something that you gave them\npermission for so lexithiamia has been\nassociated with all these kinds of\nthings and what I'd love to do is dive\ninto really what alexithymia is today as\nwell as a little bit about how it\nmanifests in different dimensions and in\nour lives okay so something else cool to\nshow y'all so a couple months maybe a\nmonth ago we looked at a very popular\nPsychology today article where there was\na psychologist who was talking about how\nmen are struggling and dating and what\nthey need to do is become more\nemotionally available I think the\narticle is really useful in a lot of way\nmade a lot of good points\nbut I think the challenge is you can say\nlike okay like people need to be more\nemotionally available my question is how\nhow do you learn to be emotionally\navailable can you go sign up for\nemotional availability class everyone is\nsaying the world needs to be a\nparticular place or gen Z needs to stop\nbeing so entitled or this quiet quitting\nis a problem or men need to be\nemotionally available and so as the\nemphasis on emotional awareness\nincreases we've got events like right in\nthe fields right in the fields is all\nabout helping you understand your\nemotions grazing awareness of emotions\nhopefully helping you regulate your\nemotions so that you can kind of boost\nyour EQ a little bit so I'd love to\nshare with you all what we've discovered\nso far so here is our right in the\nfields of motion tracking I just wanted\nto share this with you all today so the\nmost common emotion that we feel in our\ncommunity is actually happiness which is\nsomething that you sometimes wouldn't\nget you look sometimes at our community\nand it's like oh man like people are\nlike struggling so much but actually\nthis is what's cool is like a lot of\npeople are happy a lot of people are\nbuilding their lives and starting to be\nhappy it's like awesome that happiness\nis actually the number one winner now\nthere may be some kind of selection bias\nhere and this is something I encourage\nyou all to think about for people who\nare participating in the event I think\nthere's a greater likelihood that those\npeople will be happy now we have to be\ncareful here because are they if I'm\nhappy does that mean I'm more more\nlikely to participate in stuff maybe but\nI think there's another subtle\nAssociation here which is it's people\nwho participate in stuff like this that\nactually improve their emotions the\nlikelihood to participate in activities\nthat help you understand your emotional\nawareness the kind of people who will\nsign up for this are the kinds of people\nwho have done other stuff because\nthey're more likely to sign up and as\nyou do more stuff you will become more\nhappy so out of the first 4 000 people\nhow many of them did touch grass there's\nprobably a really high overlap in fact\nit's probably the people who did touch\ngrass and really improved from it that\nare signing up for this too because\nthey're like wow that was so awesome and\nso the key thing here is that I don't\nthink that happiness necessarily makes\nyou sign up but the more likely you are\nto sign up for something and engage with\nsomething the more likely you are to\nactually wind up being more happy so\nother stuff so what is right in the\nfields so it's a challenge to help you\nidentify the emotions you struggle with\nand build emotional awareness over six\nweeks so we're going to start by\nidentifying simple emotions identifying\ncomplex emotions identifying obscure\nemotions recognizing intensity\nparticipate in emotional regulation and\ndo emotional reflection and we're going\nto focus on six emotions over six weeks\nshame fear boredom anger sadness and\nhappiness hold on a second are you\nsaying that boredom is an emotion and of\ncourse in order to encourage\nparticipation we're gonna bribe y'all\nbecause that's what we have to do is\nthere are rewards Discord events\num that we're going to be talking about\nand so check it out so let's take a look\nso let's talk about alexithymia okay\nso alexithymia is the inability\nto detect\ninternal emotional state\nalexithymia has been associated with\nmotivational problems\nwe've already said\npurpose has been associated with\naddictions and other mental health\nproblems right and these are not just\num diagnosed addictions but also like\ndigital addictions like YouTube and Tick\nTock and stuff like that and then lastly\nrelationship problems\nnow here's why talking about Alexa thyme\nis important\na lot of people who struggle with these\nthree things\nwill go looking for answers for these\nthree things right does that make sense\nwe're looking for answers so they'll say\nhow do I find purpose in life and what\npeople will do is give them answers\nabout purpose so we'll say like oh like\ngo read inspiring things or like go out\nand volunteer and go do this and go do\nthis and go do this and go do this and\nthey don't realize that the prop that\nwhat's really in the way is actually\nemotional color blindness because when\nwhen you ask someone like if I Google\nlike how do I find purpose in life\nyou're not going to see alexithymia or\nemotional colorblindness come up how do\nI overcome addictions you're not going\nto see Alexa timeia come up I have\nproblems in my relationship I I\nencourage y'all go look at like you know\nany kind of relationship advice\nsituation like go look at like a\nsubreddit or a forum or whatever no one\nis going to say hey the problem with\nthis relationship is that you're\nemotionally colorblind right what\nthey're going to do is they're gonna say\noh like this person doesn't respect your\nboundaries break up with them and as it\nturns out there's actually good\nscientific evidence that all of these\nthings are influenced by alexithymia so\nlet's take a look look at what are the\ncomponents of alexithymia okay\nso number one is difficulty\nidentifying feelings\nokay and now we're going to see so\nnumber two is difficulty\ndescribing feelings to others\nright\nyou'll see maybe how this can relate to\nrelationship problems if I can't\ndescribe what I'm feeling number three\nis y'all ready for this this is going to\nbe a KO okay\nstimulus bound\nexternally\noriented\nthinking Style\nnow you may say what does this mean Dr K\nthis means that in order for you to be\nmotivated to do something there must be\na stimulus from the outside that causes\nyour motivation an externally oriented\nthinking style means that you need\nexternal deadlines\npressure\nthese are both stimuli right do you all\nget that in order to act\nnow that's kind of interesting because\nthis seems like a huge problem right I\ncan't bring myself to do something until\nthere's some kind of consequence or\ndeadline I'm like externally motivated\nand it turns out that being externally\nmotivated is correlated and is one of\nthe features of being internally\ncolorblind which sort of makes sense\nright because if I'm blind to my\ninternal drivers I'm going to need to\nrely on external deadlines and pressures\nand things like that in order to act the\nlast thing that's kind of interesting is\na constricted\nimagination\nand you may say well wait a second what\ndoes imagination have to do with\ninternal colorblindness so there are\nstudies that show that literally people\nwho have alexithymia will have more\nlogical and like less emotive dreams so\nthey'll have dreams that are like really\nkind of run-of-the-mill kind of like\nemotionally Bland kind of stuff and what\nI've seen when I work with people who\nare Alexa thymic is I'll ask them one\nreally important question I'll ask them\nwhere do you want to be in five years\nand when I ask this you know where do\nyou want to be in five years question\npeople who are lexithymic are like I\nhave no idea I can't even imagine it\nthey can very much vocalize I don't like\nthat I'm living at home I don't like\nthat I'm alone I don't like and they'll\nuse these words like like\nor don't like right they won't say I'm\nashamed of living at home I feel\npathetic about myself they'll say yeah I\ndon't want this this needs to change\nneeds to change\nand then the problem that we get into is\nthat remember they're stimulus bound so\neven though it needs to change if your\nparents aren't kicking you out of their\nbasement then you're never going to\nleave and so they have difficulty\nImagining the future and by the way\ndifficulty Imagining the future leads to\na lack of purpose because if we think\nabout those people that we want to be\nlike right who have purpose and are\ndriven for something can devote 20 years\nof their life to create a dream but if\nyou can't even imagine what the future\nwould be like how are you supposed to\nhave visions to go towards how are you\nsupposed to find goals and what we end\nup doing when we're alexathymic is since\nwe don't we're not in touch with\nourselves what we end up doing is just\nlooking at external\nsources\nfor inspiration\nso we end up with this kind of bland\nmaterialism where we look around and\nwe're like I don't really want this but\nI guess it would be nice I should move\nout of the house I should get in shape I\nshould start eating healthy I should\nstart making more money because we like\nlook at all these things but we don't\nhave this internal driver we're stimulus\nbound and so we just kind of like look\noutside of ourselves and we're like okay\nI guess I should do that because that\nlooks good okay so these are the four\nfeatures of Alexa timeia and as we'll\nsee we're going to break down how these\nalready how these lead to these three\ncommon problems so let's talk a little\nbit about the origins of alexithymia\nso how does someone become Alexa thymic\nso the first thing to understand is that\nthere's alexithymia is more often found\nin men than in women so there's even\nsomething called\num\nI forget the exact uh yeah normative\nmale\nalexithymia\nso let's talk about normative male\nalexithymia for a second\nso what do we mean by normative male\nalexithymia what we mean is that\nresearchers have sort of found that a\ncertain amount of alexithymia is normal\nin men and why is this so if you look at\nhow men are sort of culturally raised\nwe're really raised to express one\nemotion so frustration or anger that's\nreally the only thing that you're\nallowed to feel as a man growing up this\nis sort of changing now thankfully but I\njust saw a social media clip about you\nknow how men shouldn't cry from a\nconservative commentator but so this is\nkind of normal where we're sort of\ntaught like you know if you think about\nlike you know a 13 year old kid who's\nplaying sports and they they feel afraid\nto go to the big match and when they\nfeel fear what are they taught or is\nthat an acceptable emotion no fear is\nsomething that needs to be conquered\nfear is for the weak and heaven forbid\nyou feel ashamed right because like\ncrying and feeling shame like those\naren't acceptable emotions those are\nalso emotions of weakness what are the\nemotions that a strong man feels a\nstrong man feels anger righteousness\nright and what I really find is that for\na lot of men that I've worked with and\nwe'll get to women in a second because\nthings are changing very rapidly is that\nanger sort of forms an umbrella emotion\nso I'll give you all kind of a simple\nexample okay\nso let's say I get rejected by someone\nthat I'm interested in let's assume a\nheteronormative relationship between a\nman and a woman so when I feel rejected\nby someone there are all kinds of things\nthat normally come with rejection right\nso there could be fear that I'll be\nalone forever shame at myself for being\nrejected feelings of low self-worth but\nis that what I say do I go to my friends\nand I say hey this per I asked this\nperson out they turn me down and now I'm\nafraid that I don't have the basic\nqualities necessary for being in a\nrelationship I'm afraid of being alone\nfor the rest of my life you know like\nI'm just really scared about what this\nmeans for my future that's not how we\ntalk right instead what you tend to see\nis what what it's a lot of considered\ntoxic uh masculinity which is like oh\nyeah like she dumped me like screw her\nand then my friends will also say yeah\nlike you deserve better right and that\nwhat they'll kind of do is they'll like\nthey'll kind of ramp me up and this is\njust true of man this absolutely happens\nwith women as well where people will say\nyeah you dodged a bullet oh yeah that\nperson doesn't deserve you and they'll\ntake all those fears and shames and\nloneliness and what they'll do is\nthey'll like replace them with anger\nscrew screw that person they'll get mad\nat this person for hurting you and so\nit's very easy for anger to become the\numbrella emotion that's the thing that\nwe're kind of normalized to feel\na couple of other uh considerations here\nis that in my opinion this is changing\nrapidly and I've seen more women who are\nAlexa thymic in the last you know if we\nlook at like when I started med school\nin 2010 I'd say the nature of\nalexithymia and the discrepancy between\nmen and women is shrinking so there's\ngood evidence that a lot of women are\nalexithymic as well so for example if we\nlook at anorexia nervosa so this is a\ndiagnosis that predominantly affects\nwomen 63 percent of people with anorexia\nnervosa will be Alexa thymic okay 50 of\npeople\nwith major depressive disorder will be\nalexithymic about probably less than 10\npercent of the population is severely\nalexithymic which is pretty big and then\nlike probably you know up to 30 to 50\npercent of the population is moderately\nor mildly electronic I'm not entirely\nsure about that number and so what we're\nseeing is that this is probably changing\nrapidly why is it changing rapidly so\nthe first is that there's some good news\nwhich is that men are getting more in\ntouch with our their emotions that's\nsomething that you know we try to do\nhere and other people are trying to do\nas well I think um women especially are\nstarting to recognize that men have\ndifficulty with emotions so thank you\nyou for your support the other thing\nthat's happening with Alexa thyme is\nincreasing technology use and this isn't\ngender specific and what we see with\nincreasing technology use is that using\nany kind of social media\nor video game\nsuppresses our emotional circuitry like\nthe limbic system so this is like the\namygdala to a certain degree the\nhippocampus couple of other areas and so\nwhat happens is if we spend eight hours\na day using technology those are eight\nhours of the day where our emotional\ncircuitry is being suppressed and as our\nemotional circuitry enters this chronic\nstate of suppression and more\nimportantly as it gets suppressed during\nperiods of critical development so if\nI'm a teenager and I feel really bad\nabout myself normally like so a lot of\nteenagers feel bad about themselves and\nto a certain degree we can't escape\nthose feelings so we are by definition\nforced to deal with them right so I'm\nmoping around the house my parents\nnotice something is wrong they try to\ntalk to him about it I reject them I go\nhang out with my friends this is kind of\nwhen I was growing up when I was a\nteenager like back in the 90s right and\nthere was a certain amount of like\nemotions I couldn't escape from I\nstarted falling into a video game\naddiction because that's when I started\nto escape from my emotions and now what\nwe're seeing is a generation of kids\nkids who have a very very very easy\nescape from their emotions and as we\nhave escapes from our emotions we don't\ndevelop them we don't develop our\ninternal understanding of them so as\ntechnology use is increasing we're\nseeing that normative male lexithymia is\nstarting to actually get balanced out\nand I think a lot of women I'd say women\nnow are more alexithymic compared to Men\nI'm not saying they're more than men but\nthe Gap seems to be shrinking with\ntechnology use okay so the internet is\nessentially dulling our emotions so as\nour emotions get dulled what kind of\nproblems does this create so the first\nis let's talk about purpose\nand motivation hey chat subscribing to\nour YouTube channel allows us to help\nmore people with their mental health\nthanks to your support so far we've\nalready reached thousands of people from\nacross the globe so help us out and hit\nsubscribe wait they have to hit\nsubscribe and click a bell now let me\nask you all a question how do you find\npurpose in life so like how do you find\nit do you go outside walking down the\nstreet and then you find it do you\nGoogle your way to an answer do you\nrandomly go and volunteer until you\ndiscover purpose in your life that's not\nthat doesn't really work right so I\ndon't know how to say this but purpose\ncomes from inspiration and what do we\nwhat do we mean by purpose comes from\ninspiration it's kind of like if you\nfind my purpose my purpose doesn't come\nfrom outside of me it comes from within\nme and what I've seen more and more in\nour society is that we've got\nwhen people have difficulty finding\npurpose what I tend to see is that their\ninternal voice has been squashed so I'll\nsee this a lot with controlling parents\nfor example so parents who will say like\nI don't care what you want you need to\ndo what I tell you to do we see a lot of\ngifted kids who struggle with finding\npurpose and I think one of the middle\nconnecting pieces is actually\nalexithymia because these are kids whose\npotential was realized right that or\nnoticed by their parents and their\nparents were like oh you're too smart to\ndo ABC forget what your internal voice\nis I don't want you to spend time in art\nclass I want you to go you know be an\nentrepreneur Tech genius at the age of\n19. and so a lot of times what we're\nseeing is that people have difficulty\nfinding purpose because those internal\nvoices were squashed by controlling\nparents we also tend to find that people\nwho have difficulty finding purpose were\nalso neglected or dealt with some a kind\nof abuse or had Early Childhood\nexperiences\nor poor attachment formation so remember\nthat attachment is how we form human\nrelationships and the attachment Theory\nalso teaches us or attachment is how we\nlearn what we feel on the inside so a\nchild early on doesn't know what they're\nfeeling right so if I'm an 18 month old\nand I'm walking around and I Stumble and\nfall do I feel hurt should I panic or\nshould I laugh and if you look at an 18\nyear old who stumbles and Falls the\nfirst thing that they're going to do is\nlook to the adults in the room and if\nthe adults in the room are terrified oh\nmy God little Timmy fell down then the\nchild starts crying he's like oh crap I\nshould be worried right now everyone\nelse is worried and so then a child\nlearns to that they learn to recognize\ntheir feelings by looking at the faces\nof others similarly if that same child\nturns to everyone else and everyone else\nstarts laughing then the child will\nstart laughing too and they'll be like\noh this is funny and so what ends up\nhappening is if we grow up in neglectful\nhouseholds so we're not talking\nnecessarily about abuse but even if you\nyou have a parent single parent\nhousehold who works two jobs and they're\nnot around to reflect your emotions back\nto you what we discover is that these\nkids grow up to be Alexa time and as\nthey grow to be Alexa thymic they\nstruggle because they don't know how to\nlook into themselves and as they don't\nas they don't know how to look into\nthemselves they can't find purpose and\nwhat they end up doing is looking\noutside of themselves for some kind of\ncompass or goal to move towards I have\nno idea what I want in my life if you\nask me so now we can kind of go back to\nsome of our data right so if we kind of\ngo back to this if you ask me what I\nwant I have constricted imagination I\nhave no idea what I want what I want is\nto have purpose what I want is to no\nlonger live this life I want this life\nto change that's what they want this is\nalso where you see people who are\nexternally motivated and why are they\nexternally motivated because they're\ncolorblind to themselves because\nremember what is the relationship\nbetween emotion\nand motivation\nif we want to understand this\ngo watch a movie any movie doesn't\nmatter what the movie is when there's a\nprotagonist hero or heroine what\nmotivates them to overcome to Triumph\nagainst adversity dig really deep and\nbeat that final boss is it logic when\nthe hero is losing or heroin is losing\nin that critical period comes do they go\nto the library and do the next four\nhours of the movie show them doing\nexhaustive research in logical\nmathematical proofs to discover the\nsolution and then they hand or Treatise\nabout how the villain is being a bad\nperson to them that is logically perfect\nand then the then they show that the the\nvillain is flipping through the pages\nand then realizes logically I'm defeated\nand then the movie ends no you never see\npeople furiously reading things on\nWikipedia and listening to podcasts in\norder to triumph over adversity and find\nmotivation to keep going right what do\nyou see emotions and if you think about\nthe periods of your life where you've\nbeen the most motivated chances are\nemotions have something to do with it\nall those moments of life where you're\nlike never again I'm never gonna be in\nthis situation again or you feel\ninspired to create right is that like\nlogically you're like oh I guess I\nshould do this no you feel inspiration\nand how are you supposed to feel\ninspiration if you're emotionally\ncolorblind there's a lot of good\nevidence to support this as well so we\nknow that the amygdala\nwhich is our fear Center is really good\nat putting the brakes on our frontal\nlobes it can just shut them straight off\nso our frontal lobes are responsible for\nour executive function which is planning\nand executing tasks so we can wake up\nthis morning and say okay I've got this\nto-do list and I've got 14 things to do\nand our amygdala is like yeah we're\nafraid to leave in the house we're not\ngoing to do that today and you're like\nall right well I guess I'm not going to\ndo anything today but you don't realize\nit because now the problem with Alexa\nthyme is you're blind to this component\nso what do these people actually\nexperience they experience a motivation\nI'm just not motivated to do anything\nthey don't see the emotions holding them\nback because what keeps us from acting\nnegative emotions fear of Shame fear of\nrejection fear so purpose and motivation\nare absolutely tied to alexithymia next\nup let's talk about addictions so\nthere's evidence that shows people who\nrelapse are emotionally unaware so if\nyou look at when people use the more\nthat someone is able to identify what\nthey are feeling in the moment the less\nlikely they are to use a substance so\nfor example this is why a uses call your\nsponsor if you're struggling right let's\nthink about that why should you call\nyour sponsor if you're struggling when\nyou call your sponsor first of all let's\nunderstand what struggling means what is\nthe experience of struggling feeling\nnegative emotions\nwhy don't we say call your sponsor if\nyou're feeling negative emotions why do\nwe use the word struggling because we're\nAlexa thymic and we don't even know what\nthese are so all we experience is the\nstruggle do you all see that our\nexperience of it is just that life is\nhard because we don't even know that\nstruggling struggling is not a real\nthing it's an umbrella term what a\nstruggle like what does it mean to\nstrong things are hard well what does\nthat mean it's hard for me to do\nsomething well okay what makes it hard\nwell I'm terrified of asking my boss for\na raise because I don't want to be\nperceived as greedy okay now we see that\nthere's potential for shame now we see\nthat there's fear now we see that\nthere's anxiety but what we do when\nwe're alexithymic is we just say I'm\nstruggling bro I'm struggling and I've\nseen this clinically a lot where I'll\nlike work with people and I'll ask them\nI'll be like hey so like you know you\nwere sober for six months what happened\nthey'll say I don't know what happened I\njust relapsed I was good one day and\nthen suddenly I wasn't good it just\nhappened and the more that I tunnel down\nout with those people I don't know if\nyou all have friends who have struggled\nwith addiction or you yourself have\nstruggled with addiction and I don't\nknow how to say this but like if RNG is\nresponsible for whether you you stay\nsober or not like that's not a winning\nstrategy right because when someone says\nit just happened that's RNG there's\nnothing you can do like if it just\nhappened what can you do to overcome it\nyou can't do anything oh I guess just in\nthe future just make sure it doesn't\nhappen again well how so the more that I\nwork with those people what we actually\ntunnel down into is it didn't just\nhappen there was a slow burn of negative\nemotion that reached a certain Tipping\nPoint was overwhelming and you didn't\nknow how to cope because here's the\ncommon element of all addictions what is\nthe one thing that unifies all\naddictions emotional coping the one\nthing right so whether I'm shooting up\nheroin or I'm addicted to shopping what\nthey do is manipulate my emotions so any\nsubstance will kind of mellow you out or\nmaybe activate you right make help you\nfeel good sometimes that's Euphoria but\nother kinds of Behavioral addictions\nlike technology addictions they dull our\nemotional circuitry and so as we dull\nour emotional circuitry this is really\nimportant to understand it doesn't make\nthe emotions go away we just lose sight\nof it and as we lose sight of it it\nstarts to act in other dimensions of our\nlife it always seeps out that emotional\nenergy is there in the brain it just\naffects different parts of our brain in\ndifferent ways just because I'm unaware\nof the activity of amygdala does not\nmean that the amygdala does not\ninterfere with my frontal lobes doesn't\nmean that I don't feel fear and it keeps\nme trapped at home right so the effects\non the brain are absolutely there we\njust aren't aware of them so we see with\nalexithymia is that people who are\naddicted there's actually excellent\nresearch on this by Dr volkau volkau I\ndon't know how to pronounce it but she's\nawesome neuroscientist who talks about\nthe neurobiology of addiction and she\nactually has isolated that they're like\nparticular emotional circuits in the\nbrain that as we raise awareness of our\nemotions or we look at people who are\nhow are the brains of people who are\naddicted different from the brains of\npeople who aren't and there's one of the\nmajor benefits sorry one of the major\ndifferences is that people who are\nvulnerable to addiction have a lower\nlevel of emotional awareness and\nliterally their brains are wired in a\ndifferent way so what we tend to find is\nthat people who are not aware of their\nemotions can't manage them so this is\nwhere like here's the tricky thing so if\nI'm not aware that my negative emotions\nare building up how am I supposed to\nhealthily cope with them right because\nthe goal of overcoming an addiction is\nyou have to develop healthy coping\nmechanisms fantastic let's develop\nhealthy coping let's meditate but if I'm\nnot even aware that I'm feeling anxious\nlike I'm not even going to bother to\nmeditate does that make sense so in\norder to develop healthy coping\nmechanisms we have to know when we need\nto cope in a healthy Manner and if we're\nlaxatimic we don't even realize it so\nlet's move on now we get into some real\nproblems okay so here's what we tend to\nfind in people who are Lexa thymic and\nwhat their relationships look like\noftentimes they are cold and distant\nwhen it comes to communication so in\ntheir relationships they like feel\ndistant so this is what we would call\nemotional\nunavailability I'm looking for someone\nwho's emotionally available that's\nsomeone who is not cold and distant\nlet's think about what the opposite is\nright so warm\nand present\nthis equals emotional availability and I\nwant you all to think a little bit about\nokay if you're cold and distant in a\nrelationship think about your parents\nright where your parents warm and\npresent or were they cold and distant a\nsecond feature if you look at the\nscience of alexithymia and look at if\nyou take people who are Lexa thymic and\nlook at what else what other\ncommunication patterns do you see the\nother thing\ny'all are gonna love this\nsocial non-assertive\ncommunication so sometimes this is\nsocial anxiety\nor we call this social anxiety I'm not\nsaying that they have a social anxiety\ndisorder what I'm saying is that people\nwho are socially non-assertive with\ncommunication have difficulty walking up\nto someone and initiating conversation\nthey have difficulty advocating for\nthemselves right they're non-assertive\nin their communication style so they're\npassive so this is the person who will\ngo to a party and will stand there in\nthe corner and wait for someone to talk\nto them and we call that social anxiety\nbut this is actually associated with\nalexithymia\nokay next thing this is the beta mindset\nright so I'm going to draw a pretty\nbroad correlation here I'm not saying\nthat this is real but what I'm saying is\nif you listen to people who talk about\nbeing betas or get called betas they're\nnon-assertive communicators right so\nthat they're people who will like have\nlots of feelings but then like won't go\nand ask someone out so I I think I know\nit sounds kind of weird but I think a\nlot of like people like this you don't\nhave to go and take the red pill and\nbecome an ultra chat or things like that\nwhat you actually just need to do is be\naware of what your what Your internal\nemotional state is and as you become\nmore aware of your internal emotional\nstate you can start to be more assertive\nin communication and this is where if\nyou look at some of like this community\nright they're all about assertive\ncommunication I think sometimes their\nassertiveness crosses the the you know\nthe bridge into toxicity and being\nharmful but I think that like this is\nthe kind of interesting thing about that\ncommunities I think they've stumbled on\na lot of good stuff but I think they're\nthey're underlying mechanisms are not\nscientifically based because what you\nactually discover is that as you become\ncome less alexithymic we're not saying\nthat you need to be a better person you\njust need to be aware of what you're\nfeeling on on the inside and as you\nbecome aware of what you're feeling on\nthe inside you can start to communicate\nmore assertively so this is also there's\nsome really interesting data here to\nunderstand about relationships which is\nthat if you look at men men will\noftentimes be reluctant to engage in\ncouples counseling there's research on\nthis and if you ask men why why don't\nyou want to go to couples therapy or why\nare men resistant to couples therapy\nwhat it actually comes down to is that\nmen feel like they are at a disadvantage\nin terms of participating in couples\ntherapy and why is that it's because\nthey don't know how to describe they\ncan't describe their feelings to other\npeople and so what happens is they go\ninto couples therapy and then they have\na partner who's very emotionally\ndescriptive\nand then they feel like their partner\ndoes such a better job at explaining\nthemselves that the therapist\ntakes their side\nand then when the therapist asks okay\nwhat's your experience of this the dude\nis like I don't know right so Men\nactually feel like they're at a\ndisadvantage when it comes to therapy\nnow I'm not saying that men are at a\ndisadvantage that's a really really\nimportant thing to consider so when I\nwork with men for example in couples\ntherapy what I oftentimes find is that\nif I have an Alexa thymic patient man or\na woman right because a lot of women can\nbe alexithymic too it's my job as the\ncouple's therapist to translate this\ninto I'm afraid I'm ashamed\nso I don't think that men are actually\nat a disadvantage in couples therapy for\nthe record they just feel that way which\nleads to their reluctance to engage and\nthen let's try to think through so if\nyou can't communicate your emotions if\nyou don't know what you feel and you\ncan't communicate emotions\nwhat is that what happens in a\nrelationship\nwhen you can't communicate your emotions\nwell this is where things get hard\nbecause what happens is we get into\narguments and we get into arguments that\nare very confusing because the stated\nreasons that we have don't actually\nmatch what we feel so I'll give you all\nan example so I was once working with a\nyoung man who got into a conflict with\ntheir significant other and he was\nconcerned because she had a couple of\nconferences and business trips lined up\nwhere there were male colleagues that\nshe would go with right so it was like a\ngroup of people from their job so it\nwasn't just like one one woman and one\nman but this guy was really really\nconcerned and he was like yeah like you\nknow\nuh men just want one thing and the the\nor his partner would say like oh you\nknow these are just my Prof like they're\nfriends of mine from work I'm not\nromantically interested in them at all\nthey're not romantically interested in\nme at all we're just friends there's\nnothing for you to worry about and then\nthe man responds with well like that's\njust not true all men just want one\nthing you know they're just biting their\ntime like I I don't want you to go like\nyou know like I don't think it's good\nyou don't understand them and so there's\nthis kind of paranoia that started to\ncome out and sometimes would really\nresult in controlling Behavior right so\nthere's paranoia and controlling\nBehavior because they're like you don't\nunderstand men right I understand men\nyou're in danger I don't want you\nhanging out with them I don't want you\nhanging out with them when really what's\nunderneath is fear right so the man\nisn't able to articulate I feel insecure\nI'm afraid that I love you so much and I\nthink you're such an amazing person and\nI have self-esteem problems I don't\nthink I deserve you I think you deserve\nsomeone way better than me and so what\nI'm afraid of is that at some point if\nyou spend time with other men who are\nbetter than I am because I have\nself-esteem issues eventually you will\nrealize that you can do better than me\nand since I love you and since I care\nabout this relationship I don't ever\nwant that to happen I don't ever want to\nlose you do you deserve better yes but\ndo I want to hang on to you absolutely\nand so now what happens is unless the\nman is able to vocalize that because by\nthe way what kind of shameful crap is\nthat like who says like you like who\nsays that kind of thing how is that chat\nat all like that's the most beta stuff\nyou could say by the way right which is\nwhy we suppress those kinds of thoughts\ngrowing up and then we don't know how to\narticulate them and now we see how this\nleads to conflict in a relationship\nbecause now the discussion is are all\nmen trying to get into your pants no\nthey're not and you guys are arguing up\nhere and then there's no resolution\nbecause y'all are each trying to\nconvince each other where the real\nproblem is I feel insecure I'm afraid\nthat you're going to leave me and then\nthe worst part of the situation is\nbecause that's the root problem that\nleads to the paranoia and the\ncontrolling Behavior eventually what\nends up happening to this person's\nprevious girlfriends they end up leaving\nbecause he's so controlling right and\nyou take that to the internet and people\nlike oh my God that guy is so\ncontrolling dump him and move on and\nthen like now what's happened now the\nperson has been further traumatized oh\nmy God my self-esteem is so much I\ndeserve I really didn't deserve that\npeople have been leaving me over and\nover and over again now I really like\nany decent person deserves better than\nme and so then the whole cycle repeats\nand what does it come down to Alexa time\nyou it comes down to inability to\nunderstand what you're feeling inability\nto admit to yourself that you're\ninsecure and sure as hell ain't gonna\ncommunicate that to this person that I'm\nafraid of leaving and so I sabotage\nmyself I shoot myself in the foot and we\nresult in a situation where there you\ncan't communicate with your partner and\nyou end up driving them away because the\nactual problem in the relationship\ncannot be discussed or addressed and\ninstead you all end up having 9 rounds\non whether all men are trying to get\ninto your pants or not so a lot of what\nwe see is controlling Behavior actually\ncomes from inability to understand and\narticulate your own feelings now in this\nexample we sort of use the situation of\na mandating woman I've absolutely seen\nit the other way as well right where a\nlot of controlling Behavior actually\ncomes out of insecurity and so it's not\nnecessarily\nmen to women just just in that direction\nso what we end up seeing is that\nalexithymia causes all kinds of problems\nand when you go look at relationship\nadvice stuff they're not going to say oh\nyeah the problem here is that you're you\nknow you're emotionally colorblind what\npeople will say is communicate\ncommunicate communicate but communicate\nwhat right people say communication is\nthe foundation of a healthy relationship\nbut what to communicate what should I\nsay in communication what you should say\nis be aware of your feelings and\ncommunicate your feelings your drives\nyour desires to your partner and so I\nthink that Alexa thymia is a really\nreally common and growing problem we\nknow that less than 10 percent of the\npopulation up to 10 of the population\nhas severe alexithymia but we also see\nthat there are high correlations of\nalexithymia with all kinds of other\nproblems 63 of people with anorexia\nnervosa have alexithymia we also know\nthat to a certain degree there is\nnormative male alexithymia so there's a\ncertain amount of the way that all men\nare raised which leads to a certain\ndegree of alexithymia which is sort of\nreally allowing us to feel only one\nemotion and as we feel predominantly\nanger we lose sight and don't know how\nto detect these other emotions as we\nlose sight of those emotions which by\nthe way technology is increasing is\nmaking Alexa thymia worse across the\nboard because the universal effect of\ntechnology is to numb our emotional\ncircuitry and especially our negative\nemotional circuitry so as we have a\ngeneration of people who are becoming\nmore internally numb it creates all\nkinds of problems that we see front and\ncenter the first is purpose and\nmotivation I'm so burnt out at work well\nwhy are you burnt out at work well I\ntook this job well why did you take the\njob it's because I had a quiet voice\ndeep inside me that told me that I\nreally want to do this and that voice\nwas first squashed by my parents and\nthen I internalized that dialogue and\ntook all of my hopes and dreams and\nthrottled them and then I ended up\npicking a job for Prestige and now I\ncall it quiet quitting it starts with\nAlexa timing so we struggle to find\npurpose we also know from lots of\nresearch that people who are lexithymic\nhave difficulty with their imagination\nespecially around the future we also see\na lot of problems that we see with\nmotivation which is that a lot of people\nwill say oh I'm externally motivated I\ncan't do anything unless there's a\ndeadline and this is literally\nassociated with Alexa time it's one of\nthe key four features of alexithymia is\nto be externally to be externally\noriented thinking and stimulus bound\nwhich means that you don't act unless\nthere's an external thing that is\npushing you to act and let's think about\nthat for a second well why is that well\nduh it's because you spent the first 20\nyears of your life turning down the\nvolume on the internal stuff which\nresults in alexithymia I don't know what\nI'm feeling on the inside and so what\nare the only things that I'm left to\nmotivate myself with are things from the\noutside we also see other consequences\nof this such as a vulnerability towards\naddiction or worsening of Addicting\nbehaviors there are high correlations\nbetween Alexa thymine and all kinds of\nmental diagnoses so very high\ncorrelation with autism spectrum\ndisorders 63 of anorexia which we talked\nabout about 45 percent of binge eating\ndisorders a lot of addictive behaviors\nup to maybe 50 of people with major\ndepressive disorder will have will be\nalexithymic as well and so what we're\nstarting to see is that when people get\naddicted what is what is the purpose of\nan addiction the purpose of an addiction\nis emotional coping that's the one\nuniform thing between all addictions\nthey help us manage our emotions and if\nI'm colorblind to what I am feeling I\ncannot develop a healthy coping\nmechanism because I don't even know that\nmy my trash can is 50 full the only time\nI notice it is when it's overflowing\nbecause that's when it starts to create\nproblems in my life and that's when I\nend up relapsing the third big Dimension\nthat alexithymia causes problems is\nwithin relationships because remember\nthe second core feature of Alexa thyme\nis difficulty describing your emotional\nstate to others and when I can't\narticulate how I feel in a relationship\nI'm sort of at a disadvantage in terms\nof communication and then I don't know\nhow to tell my partner how I how I feel\nor even and friends right where like\nyour friends didn't invite you to a\nparty and then like just imagine this\nfor a second like they didn't invite you\nto a party and you feel hurt and left\nout do you actually go to them and say\nhey it was really hurtful to me that\ny'all left me out I feel neglected and I\nfeel undervalued compared to other\nfriends in our friend group does anyone\ntalk like that maybe increasingly but\ngenerally speaking what people will say\nis there'll be some kind of like weird\npassive aggressive exchange right I'll\nbe mad at you and be like hey by the way\nI'm around in the future you don't know\nhow to say that to people or when you do\nsay it because the other person is Alexa\nthat I make and you say hey I feel\nundervalued compared to other people\nthat makes your friend feel ashamed but\nthey don't realize that they feel\nashamed and so what they end up doing is\ngetting mad at you right because they\nare Alexa thymic too and all they know\nhow to feel is anger so that shame turns\ninto anger and they're like all right\nbro whatever you're a loser I'm out and\nthat's what the first person is afraid\nof that they're gonna have a negative\nreaction so now I can't even articulate\nmy feelings because you've got two\nalexithymic people which explains so\nmany online relationships where we can't\ncommunicate our needs to other people\nright when you say hey you I feel\nneglected and undervalued as part of the\ngroup and if your friend is not\nalexithymic they'll recognize oh I feel\nbad I'm sorry about that it's really\nhard for me to hear that especially\nbecause I've tried to invite you three\nor four times and I feel like I actually\nvalue you more than other people in the\nrelationship here's my perspective that\nthe last three times I've invited you\nyou've declined or you haven't shown up\nand the reason that I didn't invite you\nisn't because I value you less it's\nbecause I feel rejected when I invite\nyou to things and you don't show up I\nstart to wonder is there something wrong\nwith me that this person doesn't want to\nhang out with me and then you all like\nhave a conversation about it but if\nwe're alexatheimic on either side let\nalone both it's going to sabotage our\nrelationship so we tend to see that\nAlexa thymia causes problems in all\nthree of these dimensions and the real\nchallenge is that unless we're aware\nthat Alexa thyme is even a thing we go\non Google searching answers for each of\nthese problems how do I get my friends\nto invite me to think\nthat's a very common problem no one is\nout there saying become more emotionally\naware\nright when there's actually strong data\nthat suggests that Alexa time is\nassociated with all this so hopefully\nthis quick foray into like kind of\nalexithymia 101 is illustrative helps\nyou all understand a little bit about\nwhat's going on the good news is that\nAlexa thymia is not set in stone is\nthere some evidence that it kind of gets\nclassified as a personality trait but\nI've seen overwhelming clinical success\nin terms of like teaching people about\ntheir emotions so even when it comes to\naddiction I developed a meditation\nprogram for people who had addictions at\nMcLean Hospital where the goal the focus\nof the meditation program was internal\nemotional awareness because I saw this\nsort of neuroscientific deficit and we\npicked all of the meditations that will\nhelp people become emotionally aware and\nwhat did we see as we started teaching\npeople emotional awareness meditations\nthey started relapsing less but for a\nbrief period of time they started\nfeeling worse they started acknowledging\ntheir negative emotions earlier but then\nthey could reach out for help so made\nthem feel a little bit emotionally worse\nin the short term reduced relapses over\nthe long term and overall improved their\nmental health one year out so the good\nnews is that there is stuff that you can\ndo about this you just have to really\nunderstand that emotional awareness is a\nreally really key component because it's\nlike it's like literally chunks of our\nbrain are all devoted to our emotions\nand if we don't really understand what\nthose are how to regulate them it's\ngoing to cause all kinds of problems in\nour life if you found this video helpful\ncheck out Dr K's guide we've spent\nhundreds of hours writing and filming to\nhelp people understand their mind so\nthat they
