    "transcript": "like it doesn't logically make sense\nthat you randomly lose interest like you\nseem like a genuinely curious and\ninterested guy I don't think it's\nrandomly losing interest I think it\nfeels random to you because you're blind\nto like certain forces within you\nhello my friend\num hello\nuh my name is poem\nokay uh\num I'm gonna move this out I just want\nto make double and triple check\nlet me do this\nthat I don't leak your face but I it\nhelps me to be able to see it\nit's fine I'm just telling you on the\nvideo camera because otherwise I don't\nthink I'm that much emotive in my voice\nbut I'm very like expressive okay thank\nyou yeah\nI'm very nervous okay\ntell me what what are you nervous about\nI'm not nervous at the moment but I was\nnervous before coming in the call okay\nearly on I was like oh I'm nervous yeah\nI was talking to you earlier right\nyeah yeah\nwhat what do you go by um\nyeah just call him okay\nuh so where do I start from\nI cannot talk about burnout because\nthat's the thing\num\nbasically\nto really sum things up I have been\ndealing with this burnt out State for\nthe past six seven years and I just feel\nlike I'm stuck in a quagmire and I can't\nquite get out of it sounds rough man I'm\njust stuck in there\nat event\non\nyeah it's just\nkind of depressing but also at the same\ntime it's very fearful to get out of the\nQuagmire just to fall into another one\nthe very same thing is just like I'm\nblinded I'm blindfolded and I'm just\nstepping out of this place I'm like I\ndon't know there's a 50 percent chance I\nmight get into another same situation\nagain\nwhere I'm burnt out for years on end\nwith nothing to add to my name\ncan you help me understand how you feel\nor how you felt burnt out for years\nOkay so\nI'll be off a long story okay but\nthis thought uh when I was\nlet's just say 13.\num I Was A Gifted kid so you know usual\nthings like oh if you just do your best\nyou can do these things and all that\ncrap good [ __ ] but\nI was very much interested in learning\nnew stuff anything logical I just love\nlearning like studying physics chemistry\neven learning languages because I just\nloved learning stuff\nso what I started doing was\nas a hobby I started writing a Blog and\nI started writing novels as a 13 year\nold kid on the internet I was like sure\nwhy not let's try these things\nand slowly I\nand slowly I started getting a lot of\npeople following my stuff\nthat was cool I was like oh I can I can\nhave people read my stuff that's very\namazing\neventually\nI realized oh you can make money from\nthis and at the time my family was kind\nof dealing with financial instability\nbecause my dad had resigned\num\nso I was like okay maybe I can help my\nparents\nstarted doing it as sort of work but not\nreally work\nthe problem happened\num around the time when I was 16 my\nbusiness blog had pretty much like\nexpanded a lot I had to hire new people\nand I loved doing admin stuff and I was\nalso writing novels but that didn't\nreally work out anywhere because I was\nstuck not knowing if I'm making progress\nor if I'm not making progress in that\naspect of the work\nthe problem was I have ADHD and my ADHD\nslowly got very bad it's diagnosed by\nthe way\nso it got so bad I was having problems\neven holding conversations and\nI was having problems sticking to\ndeadlines\nvery very severe problems I would delay\ndeadlines maybe 10 to 20 times and then\nmaybe\nI'll get things done\nand to backtrack a little bit\nI am a person who really loves making\npromises\nif I make a promise it's very sacred to\nme I don't want to renege on it\nthe problem happens that my ADHD leads\nme to procrastination in all sorts of\ndifferent ways and when time comes to it\nI'm like oh which is the lines here I'm\nlike\nyeah who cares\nand that's sort of the main problem that\nI had as my ADHD grew worse it got air\nwho cares times 10.\nhmm\nlet me just take a look at my notes\nbecause I'm kind of going all over the\nplace\nuh\noh yeah at the same time uh I was trying\nto\nbecome my ideal self\nlike a better Creator a better leader\nfor my team and a better son and a\nstudent\nat the same time\nand\nthe thing it was I was having a very\nhard job I was just having troubles\nleading a healthy work life and study\nbalance at the time as I was a kid I\ndidn't know any better so I decided to\ndrop out of school\nthe school just wasn't that big of a\nproperty to me because in my head I made\nan excuse like I can go to school to\nmake money I'm already making money why\nthe hell should I go to school cool\nlet's talk about the school\nand\nso the thing is\nas my business crew as I got more and\nmore money I wasn't receiving any money\nmy mental health was tanking I had\ninsomnia I was coping with a lot of\nanime and a lot of like YouTube videos\nso I was I was barely surviving somehow\nso I was like okay maybe I should just\ntake that money to go see a psychiatrist\nmy parents didn't really like the idea\nbecause I've come from Indian Society\nnot really a big thing mental health you\nknow oh I know\nyeah I mean it's different now now\nthey're very Progressive but back then\nit was like yeah back then they were\nlike no you're my child not nothing\nwrong with you better I was like yeah\nsure I I sure I'm not sure and\nwhat was that ah\nyeah so as I was trying to get to my\nideal self I thought because I've\nlearned since I was like four years old\nif you just try your best you can become\nthat\nas a gift to kid I'm like oh maybe if I\njust try my best I can get things done\non deadlines maybe I can be a better\nleader maybe I can even be a better son\nand not have so many tips with my\nparents I was like okay let's try\nthe biggest problem however is I don't\nhave that much empathy towards me or\nother people\nlike when I'm just being myself I have\ntrouble\nhaving emotions in the first place\nbut when I'm impersonating someone my\nideal self I'm impersonating as that\nsomeone else\nI can very much be in tune with the\nemotions\nof other people and myself\nand it's like\nI was trying my best to be the ideal\nself at some point just to feel I was\nhappy just to feel like I was getting\nsomewhere because if I was not I was a\nlot more\nmatter of fact guy I was like oh I\ndidn't get down on deadlines cool let's\ntry your best\nI wasn't really feeling any shame\nanything but the moment I felt even\ncloser to the ideal self whatever that\nmay be I was like why the hell did I not\ndo my best\nso it's like on and off switch of my\nemotions\nand that really\nled me down a path where I slowly\nstarted to get so bad on just admin\nstuff and everything else I started\nself-sabotaging my entire thing and it\ncrashed in like I'd say 20 15 16.\nand ever since then\nI just kind of feel like I don't want to\nwork again for the longest time\nuntil I would say recently\nlast year when I found your channel I\nwas like okay maybe I can start working\non my cells and maybe I can you know\nstart getting things done because I\ndon't like to be in this place and I\nstill like to learn things and I need\nmoney to just be financially stable and\nindependent\nthe problem is\nI'm too scared either I'm too scared or\nI try to learn something and then I had\nthis intrusive thought just coming into\nmy head very abruptly\nwhat if you can make money out of this\nand I'm like oh I just lose all interest\nI'm like nope not gonna do it I'm gonna\nget [ __ ] or I just completely lose\ninterest because I don't know why\nand he said\nit's a struggle because I still like\nthose things\nI still want to do them because I\nstarted them because I liked them\nbut at this point I'm just not getting\naround to doing them because either I'm\nscared or two I just\ndon't get around to doing them what are\nyou scared of\nI'm scared of like I said like falling\ninto the same pattern of\ntrying again trying my best and then\nfailing in such a way it's just you know\nabysmal\nokay\num\nsometimes I have this suffocating\nfeeling this\nin my chest anytime I start to do\nsomething\neven if I know okay I might make some\nmoney out of this and I just cannot\nhandle that feeling I have this physical\nSuffocation my hyperventilate if I start\ndoing those things all right help help\nme understand that a little bit so when\nyou think about when you start When the\nThought crosses your mind that this\ncould be monetized\nwhat it sounds like you\nit terrifies you you rebel against it in\nsome way can you do you have any sense\nof what's going on there\num I also have diagnosed odd so I don't\nknow if that makes any sense\nokay uh\ndo you want to explain to us what odd is\nI I'm kind of iffy on the uh full form\nof odd sure so it stands for\nOppositional Defiant Disorder but why\ndon't you explain what you understand\nabout it\nbasically what I understand about it\num is I've always been defined against\nauthoritative people people who have\nauthority over me like my parents my\nteachers anyone and all the time\nnow there's a bit of a Nuance like if\nthey are very gentle in the way they\nnudge me to do something I might get\naround to doing it but that's a very\nfine line and for the most part I will\ndie on my own Hill then do the thing\nthat they're asking me to do\nand I would annoy the crap out of them\nto just not do the thing that they want\nme to do do you feel like the odd is\nactive right now in this conversation\nCan you feel it\nno okay I'm being myself so I'm not\nreally that in tune with my emotions\nit's definitely gone better now but uh\nthanks to other people I'm not gonna\nname any names\nbut\nyeah I'm definitely not as in tune with\nmy emotions when I'm just being myself\nokay so param I thought that was\nfantastic did you have anything else you\nwanted to add\num\noh yeah\num recently the reason I started\nthinking okay maybe I want to work is\nbecause my childhood friends or my peers\nand my cousins are all getting jobs and\nI'm like\nwhy am I stuck in this place\nokay do you want to work I'm not\ncomparing I'm not comparing myself to\nthem I'm just being like yeah I get that\nwhy are you getting to walk on the\nleveled pavement and I'm being stuck in\nthis quicksand\nyeah do you want to work\nyeah I want to work because I want money\nbecause I want to be financially\nindependent and I want to do that why do\nyou want to be financially independent\nbecause\num to this day I don't have a good\nrelation with my parents I love them but\nat the same time I hate them I just have\ntoo many\nlet's say stats over meaningless things\nand we don't see eye to eye on various\ntopics and I'd rather be alone\nand be happier than being with them\ndespite the fact that they're giving me\na shelter over my head I'd just rather\nbe alone\nokay so so I'm seeing that Financial\nIndependence is is really about freedom\nfrom having to deal with your parents\nyeah and then extra stuff but that's\nprobably the Crux of it\ncan I think for a second firm\nabsolutely\nhow do you feel about yourself\num\nokay I've thought about this a lot and\nthis is not necessarily related to\nBernard it's a lot of other things\nI feel pretty good about myself\nI do not used to feel that way though I\nused to have a lot of societal ideations\nback in these days\nespecially during the time I was going\nthrough the collapse of everything\nbut now I'm like\nI'll accept to the fact that\nI'm in the place that I am\nsure I I just need to move on yeah and\nand it sounds like what keeps you from\nmoving on is fear of failing\nyeah it's either fear or just complete\ndisinterest in the thing\nhelp me understand that\nlike I said before if I start something\nI would either stop because I fear that\nI'll fall into the same trap\nor just like just lose motivation and\ninterest to do that thing and it's not\nbecause of fear\nbut just happens\nokay and I'm not I'm not quite sure why\nit happens okay it's not as stuff now\nokay\nso I'm gonna think for a second okay\nlet me just\nyeah help me understand why it's\nimportant to you to keep your promises\ntonight that's a very good question\num\nwhat does that think for a second\nof course\nokay I I think I know the answer it's\njust going to take a little bit longer\nto explain sure\nOkay so\nI am not I\nI'm not really that good at\nhow do you say\ndating\nmy\nanything that I state from my mouth it's\nprobably to myself the second best\noption of communication\nwell I I don't follow either\nyeah I know\nthe first best option that I used to\nhave as a kid was going out and fighting\nthat was my main form of communication\nuntil well initially everyone's like oh\ndon't fight it's bad for you you're\ngonna get punished and actually lost all\nsorts of like communication with other\npeople and I lost how to form\nconnections with other people\nso I was like okay I don't want to be\nalone I need to learn how to speak and\nthat's why I learned how to I learned\nthe fact that everything that I speak\nhas to be important and if I make\npromises which everyone tells oh those\nare important things you always follow\nup on them\nthat's why I think it's sacred to me\nthat if I make a promise if I State a\ntime I have to\nget things done by that time I have to\ndo that promise or it's just\nsacrilegious it feels like sacrilegious\nsacrilegious so so here's the question\nis it sacrilegious because so it's not\nabout expectations of other people and\ndisappointing other people I'm not\nhearing that what I'm hearing is it's\nlike it's an internal standard\nyeah\nokay\nburn what's it\nso let me just kind of recap what I've\nheard so far okay\nI I don't I think we're going to learn\nsomething I'm not quite sure\nhow to help you or guide you but I'm\nokay with that for now and I think we're\ngonna have to do maybe just a touch more\nback and forth so you're a gifted kid\ngrowing up\num\nyou started at the age of 13 like a Blog\nright for funsies like you were excited\nabout the world you got interested in\nstuff you enjoyed learning\nand then like as the blog started\ngrowing you got positive feedback about\nit you started making money you hired a\nteam at the age of 16 to do stuff and\nlike you were like you were on the path\nto become a somebody\nright like Barum is like he's gonna be a\nsomebody\nand then you kind of made this this\ncalculated move to drop out of school\nto focus on the blog but that's\nsomething I'm not quite sure what\nhappened you had the sort of vision of\nyour ideal self you were kind of\ncrushing it you were doing well got\ndiagnosed with ADHD really struggled to\nmake deadlines\num and things started I just get the\nsense that things kind of like started\nfalling apart\nand as they fell apart\nyou started to really like get stuck\nsuddenly like this future which you had\nkind of was like bright like started to\nbecome dim\nfurthermore I'm also guessing that maybe\nyou started to regret like dropping out\nof school and stuff like that\nno no okay\nand then and then I'm sure your parents\nstarted to tell you\nthey started regretting you dropping out\nof school\na big nod right and then your\noppositional defiance\nlike pushed back against that which is\nwhy you don't regret it they regret it\nit's not actually a mistake right\noh okay maybe\nI'm asking you oh maybe now maybe you\njust pointed something out and I'm like\nlogically I think that makes sense\ninternally I'm like does it it does and\nit does not it's at the same time tell\nme about that\nuh it does because I trust what you say\nbecause I've just seen so many times\nwhere people have these\nmind Loops which you kind of in very\nsimple mind Loops which is just like oh\nyou're thinking like this I'm like oh\nthat makes someone sense Dr K is so\nintelligent I'm like oh yeah that makes\nvery much sense when you say that to me\nI'm like oh yeah that's a simple mind\nLoop that I never made connections for\nmy odd might be the reason why I never\nregret those things but at the same time\nI don't completely feel that way because\nI'm like\nI kind of want to go back to schools now\nnow as in like just it started like six\nmonths ago\nyou started six months ago\nI started wanting to go to school six\nmonths ago okay\nand then there are a couple of other\nthings that I just kind of want to touch\non I'm curious if if any of this sort of\nresonates with you one is that at some\npoint you know people were like try\nharder bro\nand and I just want to kind of\nacknowledge that especially with like\nadd like oftentimes people will think\nlike oh if you just try harder you'll\nhit your deadlines\nand and I just want to kind of point out\nI don't know if this resonates with you\nor not but then like when you try harder\nand it's not enough\nyou can start to feel really bad about\nyourself\nright because what happens when you try\nreally really hard like it's one thing\nto not give all of your effort and fall\nshort\nbecause you know in the back your mind\nthat maybe if you tried harder you could\nhave gotten an a it's almost more\ndevastating to give it everything you've\ngot and then fall short\nyeah makes sense\nwhen you say makes doesn't sense it\ndoesn't really resonate with me because\nI've never really given my all except\nfor this work\nlike in my schools I would never give my\nall and I would only do deadline things\nif a teacher was breathing down my neck\nevery day for like after deadlines or\nmaybe a week before deadlines and then\nmaybe I'll be like fine I'll do it\notherwise yeah you're not gonna get me\nto do the thing homeworks or maybe\nanything else exams are a different\nthing but everything else was like yeah\ncare as long as I pass the classes okay\num\nso the last couple of points that that\nit's very helpful when you're you're\nadding your comment sperm so\ntell me why are you scared to try again\nbecause it doesn't sound like you have\nregrets\nno I don't regret\nuh\nin fact\nokay you have talked about this thing\nabout\nhow do I say in a family-friendly way\nwe'll see what happens\nattitude when going into stuff you will\nfeel resistance but we'll see what\nhappens at you\nI did it and I failed\nand I'm like I don't know if I want to\ndo that again for something\nand it will have it fail again\nOkay so\nbut you don't regret the failure\nI\nokay that's a very tricky thing now I\ndon't regret it but for the longest time\nI regretted the fact that I was\nwhen I was imagining and daydreaming\nmyself to be that ideal self I've always\nregret the fact\nI'm such a piece of [ __ ] like I could\nnot do that I could not do such a simple\ntask of just being punctual\nokay that everyone can do like being on\ndeadlines so you can you can when when\nyou put on a costume of your ideal self\nthen you can regret it but you don't\nactually regret it\nyeah but I'm myself I'm like very\nI have\nI have a very high IQ externally and\nvery low IQ internally when I'm done\nmyself\nsure I think we'll we'll get to that in\na second so okay so that's useful to\nknow so basically no regrets right\nyeah kind of yeah okay so let's just\nkind of tunnel down there for a second\nso here you are age of 13 you start\nblogging and you're gonna be a somebody\nI was just like excited I'll have fun\nyeah sure and then and then 16. right\nlike you're gonna be somebody money\nenters the picture you start to realize\nlike oh my God like a lot a lot early\nactually okay so like you start to like\nlike I-16 everything was like falling\napart\nokay so so I'm just kind of curious what\nis it like to be on the road to success\nand then have it all fall apart\nI think for a second I don't quite\nremember that feeling\nhmm\nOkay so\none thing that I would do was\nif I made a promise and I you know\nrenege on it I would to make up for it I\nwould make nearly impossible promises\njust to over compensate\nthat my ideal stuff could obviously do\nand I believed in myself that yeah I can\ndo it but I'd never be able to do it and\nI just felt like it's getting farther\nand farther away and it felt like\neventually to a point I was just like\nwhy am I trying\nit wasn't in an emotional sense it was\njust like a practical sort of thing like\nwhy am I trying it's not working out\nBarum do you feel like you've squandered\na good portion of your life\nbefore while I did and what happened to\nthat feeling\nit kind of went away somehow\nokay I don't really know what happened\nto it it just went away and I was like\nI'm me\nI'm here I still have like I don't know\nfour or five six decades to live why\nshould I care about some years that I\njust spent doing something that which I\nlearned a lot of stuff to be honest\nsure why should I look at it negatively\nI came to that conclusion I suppose I\nthink it's a very valid conclusion to\ncome to so here's what I think could be\ngoing on for him I'm not quite sure how\nto say this so I'm going to stumble\nthrough my words you let me know what\nsits well with you and what doesn't\nokay so the first thing is that I think\nlike you kind of said you struggle to\nfeel\nthings unless you're kind of pretending\nbut to me it just doesn't make sense\nthat someone who has such a bright\nfuture\nthat was like really and it wasn't\npotential right it was happening\nlike it was real like you were 14 years\nold or 15 years old and 16 years old and\nlike helping your parents pay the bills\noh my God right in Hindi gets me up all\nthe time so so it's like\nyeah I guess yeah in hindsight yeah yeah\nright and and then like for you to kind\nof\nkind of dropped the ball there bro\noh my God I'm not trying to boast\nbut yeah I guess that yeah it can be\nseen that way yeah\nyeah\nI mean do you see it that way\nnot necessarily because\nin the end that money never really came\nto me I was like just paying my parents\nbill I couldn't really do anything that\nI wanted to granted I pretty much had\nnothing else to do\nbut\nI'd still have light to have some money\nso when you devalue your success like\nthat\nbecause that's what you're doing there\nright you're devaluing your success\nyou're like then money never came to me\nyeah yeah\nlike it never came to you but oh so 16\nyear old just paying your parents bills\nit's not like it was any like\nthey went to them right\nI'm not really devouring because it\nnever really felt like an amazing thing\nit made me feel amazing for like five\nminutes to me but then it was like yeah\nokay okay moving on I need to get things\ndone okay sure\nso so what I'm what I'm detecting more\nthan anything else is like a lot of\nnumbness\nand\nit's been there since\nI I can remember yeah so let's talk\nabout that because I think when we're\nnot aware of our emotions\nthey manifest in ways like randomly\nlosing interest\nlike it doesn't logically make sense\nthat you randomly lose interest like you\nseem like a genuinely curious and\ninterested guy I don't think it's\nrandomly losing interest I think it\nfeels random to you because you're blind\nto\nlike certain forces within you\nlike human beings work on principles how\nare you feeling when I say stuff like\nthat\nI'm feeling that I relate to it more\nbecause uh you're talking running this\none Lord of yours on YouTube that I\nwatched about addiction that people with\naddiction would one day be like okay I'm\nnot going to drink and then three four\nmonths down the line they're drinking\naround and they're like I don't know\nwhat happened and I was like maybe\nthat's happening to me yeah I did think\nthat way\nso I think a couple other things is I\nwonder if you're actually like\nOppositional Defiant within yourself\nlike because when you said like\nyou know\nfighting is my natural\nsomething kind of clicked I have no idea\nif this is correct or not but like I\nalmost get the sense that you're\nfighting a war with yourself and any\ntime you try to get out of the pit that\nsuffocating feeling is like don't do it\nit like what I see I don't see anyone\nelse holding you back I see you holding\nyourself back\nand I think since you're kind of blind\nto emotions like you're not even aware\nof like you're kind of tackling yourself\nlike that's what it is right you try to\nget up because you're not actually in\nquicksand\nthere isn't an external Force\nyou're pinning yourself\nlike you're holding yourself there\nyou're dragging yourself back anytime\nyou try to move forward\nand you kind of talk about fear but I\ndon't even know if it's fear\nI mean I know you're safe here so that's\nwhat we're gonna assume but what I'm\nnoticing is like there's an absence of\nall kinds of other stuff like I don't\nknow how to say this bro but like people\nwho were going where you are going\nshould be full of regret\nnow frankly I'm not and that's something\nI like I I've thought about what I feel\na lot and it's gotten to the extent that\nluckily I can feel a lot of stuff now\nwithin me in the past I'd say\nthree years yeah so now I've got another\nkind of weird God\nuh it's not by myself unfortunately it's\num actually fortunately other people\nhelped me my romantic partner at the\ntime helped me out a lot in the suspect\nand I was like\nokay maybe I should start looking into\nmyself\nand I come to realize I don't really\ncorrect that time\nthat much I regretted it a lot at the\nmoment at some time when I failed and\nfor like a year or two or three after\nthat but after that I was like\nI've kind of regretted it but at the\nsame time I was like I'm glad that I got\nto experience that thing sure so I think\nthat that sounds like a happy with the\nfact that I got that okay chance so so\nthat that sounds so that's the tricky\nthing from my perspective I don't know\nif it's numbness or it's been dealt with\nright so whether you've moved through\nthe regret or it was never there so\nyou're telling me that it was it was\num\nyou've moved through it which is totally\nfine last kind of random question I\ndon't even I've never asked this\nquestion before I have no idea if it's a\ngood question or not\nyou were saying that so now you're more\nin touch with your emotions right\nyeah you're able to feel more\nso you're also saying that you're the\nmost in touch with your emotions when\nyou're pretending\nto be your ideal self okay yeah any\nchance you're pretending to be burnt out\nno no I haven't okay wait that was not\nthe question I was not expecting okay\nhmm\nam I pretending to be burnt out\nwhy would I do that I have no [ __ ]\nclue I'm just wondering when I asked\nthat question\ndon't worry about the why like\nam I\nI\ndon't know I I I I like I said I've\nnever asked that question it's not it's\nnot something I've ever encountered\nbut you seem exceptional to me\nand I genuinely don't know and like\nthere's a part of me that just wanders\nthere's just something for you to think\nabout right I'm not saying you're like\nhey you are pretending to be burnt out\nno no like you know so so don't please\ndon't take it that way I'm just like I'm\nasking for your help with this random\nthing that popped into my head as I was\nhearing you speak\nthat like like I I don't question that I\nwas expecting from you was\nare you pretending right now to be able\nto feel stuff which is not the case\nbecause I went through a situation in\nwhich I was pretending I got found out\nI'm not let's just say I had to deal\nwith the aftermath of it which kind of\nhelped me\nget closer to my real self and still\nfeel stuff\nyeah so so here's here's kind of what I\nwhat I'm sort of thinking\nyeah like I'm just wondering whether\nlike there is something\nprotective\nabout being burnt out\nright because like then do you do you\nreally have to do like oh it's like\nyou're burnt out like you know not your\nfault\nyou're a victim\nbut then I do hypervently and I still\nwant to learn things I still of course\nof course of course but but uh Parham\nlike of course you want to learn you're\nyou're a good person you're bright you\nhave a lot of motivation but poor you\nyou're burnt out\nthat's why\nit's hard\nI can see certain situations in which my\nwife thinks that way and I can see such\nsensitration which that does not apply\nwhat yeah what what what feels more\nright to you\nwell actually\nso I think that feels like two different\nparts of me\nso so I I do the only thing that I feel\npretty confident about is that this game\nis not Forum versus the world it's Barum\nversus bottom\nwhether that's you being kind of odd and\nthis is the crippling thing about odd\nso the biggest problem with odd\nis that when someone tells you something\nand they're right\nyou will never accept it because of the\nodd so what that means is that\nabsolutely if your parents are ever\nright you\nand they're like Barb all you need to do\nis ABC and they're a hundred percent\nright you will throw that solution even\nif it's a hundred percent right for you\nyou'll throw it out the window because\nof the odd\nyeah I have done that and that's still\nan issue to a certain extent yeah so you\ngot to think about that but like there's\nthere's something going on here where\nyou when you try to act like all I\nreally feel confident about I want you\nto ignore 50 to 90 of what I say all I\nreally feel confident about is when you\ntry to do something it's like some Cobra\nlike Rises up within you\nand like keep like then tackles you\nright there's something weird going on\ninside you where like when you try to\nmove forward is it fear I don't know how\nto say this bro but I think fear sounds\na little bit too simplistic\nand that could be like an incorrect\njudgment on my end because I I'm just\ngetting in maybe you've worked through\nthe regret but it's almost like\nI mean it's maybe maybe you have worked\nthrough the regret I I don't know but\nlike and maybe this is fear right so I\ncan see how\nthere\nhere's here's what I'm concerned about\nand I'll kind of leave you with this and\nkind of give you the last word but\nthere's a part of me that's worried that\nyou can't forgive yourself\nbecause you didn't do anything wrong\nand sometimes lack of forgiveness\nlike you can't move forward without it\nbut like if I did not nothing wrong\nwhat should I forgive myself for that's\nexactly my point\nis that's what's whole like so there's a\npossibility here that like what you need\nto do is kinda admit that you're [ __ ]\nup\nand then what you've got to do is say\nlike even though I [ __ ] up\nI can forgive myself\nyou know I really dropped the ball there\nand once you're able to do that you're\nokay dropping the ball again\nright because if you're if it's okay to\ndrop the ball then you can pick it up in\nthe first place\nthe problem is like you CA you're so\nparanoid about dropping it\nbut like if it's not if there's anything\nwrong with it why do you have to be\nafraid of dropping in the first place\nit's okay it's a learning experience but\num learn Vita it's okay and then here\nyou are not willing to pick it up\nso there's just something about this\nthat doesn't fit with me\nand and there's like it's very ego\nprotective to devalue like I'm I mean\nso the the hard thing about this for me\nBarham is that I do think you've\ngenuinely grown in a lot of ways but for\nsome people genuine growth\nand like psychological ego defensiveness\nlooks a lot alike\nright so I know I struggled with this\nwhere it was like okay like I'm going to\nbe spiritual take sanyas\noh yeah you've talked about right and\nlike that can absolutely be genuine if\nthere's a part of that that is still\ngenuine for me today but there's also\npart of it that was straight up [ __ ]\nbro\nand what I'm I'm just getting is\nsomething just does not add up\nand there's a part of me that kind of\nsays like what you need to do is admit\nto yourself that you kind of screwed up\nand admit to your and then work through\nand say like it's okay to screw up but\nwhat I'm hearing from you is oh like I\ndidn't really screw up like I learned\nfrom it so it's okay I didn't really see\nthe money so it's okay so it's okay so\nit's okay so it's okay\nand then what happens is if it's really\nokay then you should be able to get up\nand leave the house and you know but\nthen what happens when you get up\nthere's this suffocating feeling\nthere's something powerful there\nsomething about this picture is just not\nadding up for me I'm not saying I'm\nright and that you're wrong\nbut like one like I see I I see you\nstruggling against yourself I see you\ngenuinely striving forward and genuinely\nstopping yourself\nI do wonder whether like some of the\nsolutions or like you know if your\nparents told you it was a mistake to\ndrop out of school you can never admit\nthat\nthen you can't regret it I never did if\nif they said it's a mistake\nit's no mistake\nyeah and then if it's not a mistake then\nyou get all this devaluing crap and then\nif you never made a mistake you never\nforgive yourself but deep down you know\nit's a mistake\nand then like you can't move past it and\nfor seven years you've been stuck\nI don't feel like it is a mistake deep\ndown maybe it's just numbness Maybe\nyeah I I don't know\nbecause I I think that the logical stuff\nthat you say I do think that there's\ntruth in that\nright so like like that I I I I I don't\nthink you're wrong I think it's\neverything about this conversation to me\nBarnum feels incomplete as opposed to\nwrong\nso that incomplete thing might be the\nreason behind everything\nit could be I mean I get this I get the\nsense we've got half the puzzle pieces\nthat's another way to put it and I think\nsome of the puzzle pieces you threw into\nthe fire because your parents handed\nthem to you\nand then like the picture isn't coming\ntogether\num maybe it could be the case that\nbecause we're talking specifically about\nburnout there's a lot of stuff that we\nhaven't talked about\nsure it doesn't really\nrelate to burnout so so I think that's\nalso where like when you say something\nlike that I don't know what the right\nanswer is I don't know that means that\nokay so we don't have a good picture of\nit so we need additional information\nwhich makes perfect sense what also\nsometimes makes sense for sneaky [ __ ]\nlike yourself\nis that the closer we get to the real\nthing the more additional crap you're\ngonna throw in to distract us\nI I don't know I can see myself\nabsolutely doing that so like like the\nyou know the the like when you say oh\nbut like Dr K you miss you forgot all\nthis stuff I need to share all this\nother stuff with you I I don't know\nbecause like the thing is I\ndidn't mean it in that sense for Maybe\nMight maybe it might be a thing but I I\ndon't know we don't have to talk about\nthat I don't I don't doubt that\neverything that you think of is\nimportant I I don't doubt that more\ninformation is never bad I'm just\nsharing with you that like I I don't\nknow I don't know that I don't think\nwe're going to be able to figure this\nout today for him and I'm sorry about\nthat but like I think that you're\nI think you've really got to take a look\nlong hard look at yourself\ntry to figure out like\nwould I allow myself\nto regret\nwhat's happened\nfor all the things that your parents\nhave told you\nbecause like here's the thing once you\nstart defying that even if you tell it\nto yourself and you believe it in some\npart you're going to defy it within\nyourself internally\nI'd also ask like you know I I this\nthese are more long-term things because\none thing that I really do get from you\nis that\ndespite you kind of saying you've been\nstuck for seven years I get the sense\nyou've genuinely made a lot of progress\nand that sometimes it takes a couple of\nyears to figure stuff out especially\nwhen the mind is like complex and the\nproblem here is that the person that\nyou're wrestling against is gifted\nright uh it's the pain of everything\nhonestly it is like like people like you\nstruggle like because it's just you know\nit's like any of these do you play video\ngames\num I I was playing League back in 2016\nwhen I was going through this [ __ ] I was\nvery addicted to it it was very good\ncurving mechanism so so I was very\ntilted there are a lot of video games\nwhere like you you fight like this\ndoppelganger boss right so an Elden ring\nit's like mimicked here like you walk in\nand there's this like magic mirror and\nthen like some Shadow a few steps\noutside and the thing about like you\nknow beating the mimicked here in Elden\nring is you go in without any weapons\nand then like it comes out weak and then\nyou equip something and then you can own\nit but the stronger you are the harder\nthe fight is and what I get from you is\nthat like this is why it's going to take\na while because\nthe the evil Shadow that steps out of\nthe mirror is like jacked\nand there's a beast basically because\nI've grown that has also grown\nthat's where I think I think something\nabout this so I would say a couple of\nconcrete things the first is really try\nto figure out like\nI mean you had a really bright future\nand that's gotta hurt\nto lose and if you've gone through it\nwhat if you've gone if you've gone\nthrough it that's totally fine\nthen I'd kind of ask like if you\nsurvived it once like why can't you\nsurvive it again\na couple of other questions to ask is\nwhen you feel like that suffocating\nfeeling like what is that because that's\na pile of emotion\nthat was kind of the main thing I was I\nCame Here Wanting an answer to like what\nis that feeling we've never got got into\nthat conversation it's because I I don't\nI know it's kind of weird like I'm I\nthink it's really important but I don't\nknow if we\nI mean I I\nyeah I'm still glad that I got to talk\nno no I I know I'm just I'm just trying\nto I'm trying to figure out if I give\nyou an answer to that are you gonna push\nback and is it better for you to\ndiscover it on your own which is really\nwhat I'm thinking\nno I'll Discover it on my just leave me\nwith the questions yeah so I think just\nto really ask yourself like what is this\nfeeling of Suffocation we've got an\ninteresting exercise which you should\nparticipate in by the way that there are\nstudies that have mapped emotions\ntwo certain parts of the body so it's\nlike literally like there's like a\npattern of emotion\nand when you have that Suffocation\nfeeling what I would really do is like\nCircle every part of your body that you\nfeel anything in and then look at the\nlist of 100 emotions and see if it maps\nonto any of those I'd be super curious\nwhat it maps onto what is the uh study\nwhere can I find it it'll be somewhere\nI'll talk to Tech teller about it it's\nalready somewhere I just don't know\nwhere\nso you can use like physicality to\ndiagnose an emotion it's not a hundred\npercent but people you know people have\ndone studies where they basically asked\nlike a thousand people to map various\nemotions and like the distributions are\nquite unique\nso like 50 here and 90 here is different\nfrom ninety percent here and fifty\npercent here\nthere are all these different emotions\nlike and we'll see if it's regret\nyou know and and that's the tricky thing\nis that I I don't I don't know you know\nI genuinely don't think that this is\nlike you're not all like being sneaky\nand stuff but something about this that\na part of you is hiding a part of you is\nresisting a part of you like you know\nit's it's you\nthat's that's kind of doing this the\nproblem is I I don't even know what I'm\nhiding because I think I just made\nmyself bare\nyeah I I I I don't I think it's I I\nagree I I think it's hard to figure out\nbut that's it's a journey and you've\nalready made significant progress and I\nthink you just gotta keep walking\ninteresting\nthat's\nkind of tiring or exhausting to think\nabout but\nit's not really something that gives you\na feeling that I can't do it\nbecause I'm already doing it I think\nexhausting is is the right response\nbecause I think there's more to do\nI feel I feel it in my chest and my\nstomach what do you feel that that\nsuffocating feeling\nare you afraid\nno it's just that you know like I can\nfeel it\nI'm Not Afraid though is it a feel is it\ndoes it feel like you can't do it\noh no absolutely not does it feel like\nyou don't want to\na little bit maybe does it feel like you\nshouldn't have to\nno\nbecause it feels like pity\nthat's an interesting word he threw out\nthere okay uh\nI guess yeah\nwhat are you pitting a little bit\nI don't know it just feels like I'm\npitying\nsomething in me and I don't know what\nwould you allow yourself to feel pity\nfor yourself\nI'm okay with this I just want to know\nwhat am I peeding\nlike I feel like I'm seeing half a word\nand the end is just dark I want to see\nwhere it's leading to so I just know\nokay this is the thing\nI'm fine with feeling it\n[Music]\num\nI don't know maybe this could be just\nthat already or something\nagain rearing its head but I'm I think\nyou deserve better\noh\noh my God that's so good to hear that\nuh oh my God oh my [ __ ]\nthat fell so I don't know why that\nfeeling's gone\nyou look like you're tearing up a little\nbit\na little bit yeah I don't usually do\nit's very well for me to stay up\noh my God\nthis is my own stream right I'm not\nbeing shown on the screen\noh thank goodness oh my God\noh\nRussell that's so so good\nI deserve better\nit's so good just say to myself\nI just don't know what\nwhat is this thing affecting every time\nI say don't do what you're doing no no\nso there's your mind again just sit\nwhat is it affecting there goes the\nlogic don't\nwhat next nope\njust\nI think it feels good and I think you\nshould cry about that too because\nyou do deserve better and you didn't get\nthat it's not fair\nwhat you've been through you don't\ndeserve it you don't deserve what has\nhappened I just had this thought of like\nit felt like\nlost opportunity\nyeah\nthat\njust really sucked\nyeah and I\nhow I wish that didn't happen or I could\nturn back time and just\nit's really sad isn't it maybe I do\nmaybe I do report but it is it is\nit is relieving\njust hear that I deserve better\ndoctor okay you did you did your magic I\nnever thought I'd be the one because\nwell I can't do it without you\nit's okay man\nI'm just kind of feeling this this\nwanting to cry\nI don't know what it is but I just want\nto cry\nthat's very rare for me\nto cry\nI think maybe tough for me as well yeah\nso I think maybe it's gonna be hard if\nI'm sitting right here\nbut oh no that's not the problem I um\nI'm quite emotional person if I cry I\nend up crying not doesn't matter how\nmany people are watching me okay so I I\nwould say\njust this feeling is\nkind of going like relieving and wanting\nto cry and believing it's like I'm\nfinding it hard to just cry\nit's all right it feels so good yeah\nyeah so I think just so what I would\nrecommend is that you I don't know like\nwhere you are but get some fresh air\nmaybe wash your face just sit with\nyourself for a little while it's my time\nI'm literally in India okay so I don't\nknow if\nyou can open a window 12 midnight okay\nso I I'm not sure but I would say just\nbe with yourself for a little while and\ndon't try to fix it or change it or what\nnext just be\ndon't even meditate\njust I tried I couldn't really do it\nokay\nFarm\ngood luck to you\nthank you so much Dr I I was not\nexpecting to be
