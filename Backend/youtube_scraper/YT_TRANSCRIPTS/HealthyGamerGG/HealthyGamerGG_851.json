    "transcript": "but the key thing is that if you really\nlook at the root it's that something\nabout the way that I I judge the way\nthat I look is unacceptable so I feel\nunattractive I feel unacceptable I feel\nlike I should look differently and\nthat's kind of the core core core\nfeature of both of these buckets today\nwhat I want to talk to you all about is\nsomething that's a little bit different\nI want to talk to you all about eating\ndisorders and Body Image issues and I\nthink that to start off with I kind of\nwant to dive into a little bit of like a\npsychiatric history and then what we're\ngoing to sort of discover is that the\nway that we perceive eating disorders\nand Body Image issues is actually like\nquite gender specific and I believe\nthere are a couple of changes that are\ngoing on in our society right now\npossibly due to things like social media\nwhich have suggested to me that we may\neven have like emerging manifestations\nof body dysmorphia or eating disorders\nthat are a little bit different in men\nso let's start with sort of a historical\nperspective so if you look at kind of\nlike psychiatric diagnoses related to\nbody image in the way that people look\nwe tend to see two major buckets the\nfirst is something called Eating\nDisorders so these are things like\nanorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa binge\neating disorder so these are situations\nwhere you know someone engages in\ndisordered eating so eating in which\nthey severely restrict their eating\nwhich is the case in anorexia or\nsometimes they'll they'll binge and\nPurge so they'll eat a large amount of\nfood and sometimes they'll vomit the\nfood later in order to avoid getting the\ncalories and changes to their their body\nimage and so that's kind of like the\neating disorder buckets and then we have\na separate bucket which is body image\nrelated issues where we think of\ndiagnoses like body dysmorphic disorder\nso in body dysmorphic disorder there may\nbe some kind of disorderless eating\nassociated with it but this is a\nsituation where usually people are\npreoccupied with a particular feature of\ntheir physical form and they feel really\nreally really unsatisfied with\nparticular feature so sometimes we'll\nsee body dysmorphic disorder manifest in\ndifferent places so oftentimes not with\na psychiatrist but plastic surgeons for\nexample will see body dysmorphic\ndisorder ENT doctors will oftentimes see\nbody dysmorphic disorder where someone\nis very hung up on their nose or their\nappearance and people will come in for\nsurgery I almost wonder a little bit\nabout all of these lag lengthening\nsurgeries that that I hear about\nnowadays and whether that's actually\nassociated with body dysmorphic disorder\nbut the key thing is that generally\nspeaking in Psychiatry we tend to if\nsomeone is unhappy with the way they\nlook we tend to bucket them into an\neating disorder or a body dysmorphic\ndisorder the thing is if you sit down\nand you talk to these people or at least\nthis has been my experience and you ask\nthem okay so I understand that you want\nto get plastic surgery help me\nunderstand a little bit about why you\nwant the surgery in the case of body\ndysmorphic disorder or people who are\ngetting implants in particular parts of\ntheir body and if you talk to someone\nwho's got let's say anorexia and you ask\nthem okay tell me a little bit about\nlike what's in your head so under\nunderstand that you're quite restrictive\nwith your eating or you're careful about\nwhat you eat right so we don't want to\nuse a judgmental diagnostic word but\nwhen I when you talk to these actual\npeople what you discover is that what\nthe root for me at least appears to be\nexactly the same which is both of these\ndiseases I think are manifestations of a\ncore image issue so when they look in\nthe mirror there's something\nfundamentally that they don't like when\nthey look in the mirror they see\nsomething they do not like and then what\nthey try to do is try to move towards an\nideal body image in their mind through\nthese different paths so for some people\nit manifests is like restrictive eating\nfor other people it manifests as some\nkind of surgery or whatever else we can\nsee from body dysmorphia but the key\nthing is that if you really look at the\nroot it's that something about the way\nthat I I judge the way that I look is\nunacceptable so I feel unattractive I\nfeel unacceptable I feel like I should\nlook differently and that's kind of the\ncore core core feature of both of these\nbuckets\nso oddly enough even though we sort of\ndiagnosed them quite differently like\nthe diagnostic criteria are very very\ndifferent when I sort of think about\num these patients I almost kind of treat\nthem the same way especially in\nPsychotherapy which is sure there may be\nparticular behaviors that are kind of\nthe the end manifestations of their core\npsychological issue but the core\npsychological issue is essentially the\nsame which is unacceptable not accepting\nthe way that we look or being very very\nbent out of shape about the way that we\nlook now the interesting thing is that\nif you look at these diagnoses what\nyou'll sort of discover is that there's\na big gender difference in terms of how\noften people get diagnosed with this\nstuff so for example anorexia nervosa\nhas somewhere between 0.6 and 2.2\npercent of the population has anorexia\nnervosa so we're talking less than one\nin a hundred up to maybe about one in\nfifty the other thing that we notice\nabout anorexia is that it tends to have\na very very strong gender skew so for\nevery man who is diagnosed with anorexia\nthree women are diagnosed with anorexia\nwe also see this pattern exist in other\nEating Disorders like binge eating\ndisorder is like about a two to one kind\nratio seems to be a little bit more even\nso we know that there are that women\nseem to be suffering from eating\ndisorders more than men are and you\ncould also sort of extend that out into\nan assumption or extrapolate that out\nthat disordered image is more common in\nwomen than it is in men and there's\nthere's kind of a really interesting\nreason\num that I think we're starting to\ndiscover is that our initial diagnostic\ncriteria for something like anorexia was\nvery very culturally and gender specific\nso just to give you all an example\num so if we look at the diagnostic\ncriteria for anorexia or sorry it's not\nthe diagnostic criteria if we look at\nthe screening questions that people ask\nfor when we're trying to screen for\nanorexia and by the way so certain\norganizations like um you know primary\ncare physicians in the United States the\nstandards of care that are determined by\nthe US government suggests screening all\nwomen for eating disorders but not\nscreening all men now I don't think that\nthat is any kind of like discrimination\nI think that that's just sort of valid\nright so like for example we don't\nscreen men for cervical cancer because\nthey don't have a cervix we don't ask\nmen to get mammograms on a you know\nevery five years to screen for breast\ncancer because the incidents or\nprevalence of this illness within a\nparticular gender population doesn't\nreally suggest that screening is\nappropriate at the same time I think\nwhat we're starting to discover is that\na lot of of our assumptions about eating\ndisorders were very very culturally\nspecific and also gender specific so for\nexample people as we've learned more\nabout eating disorders so a lot of the\nresearch on eating disorders and\ndiagnostic criteria essentially came out\nof studying women and Caucasians and so\nnow as we're sort of starting to see\nlike\num do more culturally sensitive\nPsychiatry we're starting to see for\nexample that eating disorders and Body\nImage issues manifest differently\ndepending on your culture even your\nsexuality so we know that for example\nbody image issues in in people who are\nhomosexual manifest differently from the\nway they manifest in people who are\nheterosexual we know that for example\nbody image issues in the Singaporean and\nChinese Community are different than in\nthe Caucasian Community are different in\nlet's say African communities or Latin\nAmerican communities and so we're\nstarting to discover that our initial\nassumptions about you know what how we\ndiagnose an eating disorder was very\nvery culturally and gender bound and I\nthink this is best exemplified by the\nU.S preventative task force the forces\nscreening questions for eating disorders\nso what I'm going to do right now is\njust read a couple of these questions\nout to you so here's how we screen for\neating disorders so for example do you\nmake yourself sick because you feel\nuncomfortably full do you worry you have\nlost control over how much you eat have\nyou recently lost more than one stone or\n14 pounds or 6.35 kgs in a three month\nperiod Do you believe yourself to be fat\nwhen others say you were too thin would\nyou say that food dominates your life if\nwe listen to those screening questions\nwhat we notice is that these are\nscreening questions that have to do\nspecifically with weight loss and that's\nbecause if we look at people who have\nanorexia right they're very very very\nconcerned about having a low weight but\nif you kind of go back a little bit and\nstep away from the manifestation of the\neating disorder and go to the core issue\nthe core issue is when I look in the\nmirror I really really don't like what I\nsee and this is almost like an\nirrational belief fright because I can\nlook at myself and I can be unsatisfied\nthat's a normal human experience and we\ncan move to make changes to our diet or\nexercise or whatever to start to feel\nbetter about the way that we look the\nkey thing though is some of those\nbeliefs are rational and some of them\nare irrational and how do you tell the\ndifference well it's like do the beliefs\nchange depending on your appearance so\nif I look in the mirror and I I say hey\nI'm a little bit overweight or I'm\noverweight and then I proceed to lose\nfive pounds or lose 10 pounds and then\nwhen I look in the mirror does my\nresponse change so as I start to get\nhealthier do I feel more satisfied with\nmyself or do I persistently believe that\nwhat I see in the mirror is unacceptable\nand that's really the key difference\nbetween sort of unhealthy body image and\nhealthy body image which is that is it\nresponsive to feedback and so what we\ntend to see is our screening questions\nare really focused on weight loss\num but really the core issue here is a\nbody image issue and as we've done more\nand more research on different cultures\nand different genders what we're\nactually actually starting to discover\nis that core issue of body image\nmanifests in different groups of people\nin different ways so for example if you\ntry to screen a man for body image\nrelated potential diagnoses the\nscreening questions that we have which\nare screening questions for eating\ndisorders may not actually apply to men\nbecause as we've discovered and we're\nabout to get into body image issues for\nmen are actually quite different so as\nwe've learned a little bit more we've\ndiscovered okay what what kind of body\nimage issues do men have so I think\nthese are really best described by sort\nof like the the mesomorphic ideal I'd\nwant to say maybe 60 or 70 years ago\nthere was a a physician who sort of\ndescribed that there are three body\ntypes so one is sort of like thin and\nbony one is what we would call kind of\nlike big boned so these people have tend\nto have like rounder frames or stockier\nbuilt tend to be like wider as opposed\nto taller so we sort of know that\nthey're these these different kinds of\nbody types and the middle type is\nsomething called mesomorphic and so\nmesomorphic people have wide chests\nnarrow waists so wide like shoulder\nlength actually so the width of the\nshoulders are are wide narrower waists\ncompared to shoulders a high degree of\nmuscular definition so like very very\nvisible muscles a low body fat\npercentage and so these this is kind of\nlike the mesol limbic I mean mesomorphic\nbody type and so if you look at sort of\nperceptions of of male ideals and you\nlook at men and the kinds of bodies that\nthey aspire to they tend to essentially\nfocus on this mesomorphic ideal and so\nthe key thing is that if I'm interested\nin a mesomorphic ideal if you ask me\nhave I lost weight over the last you\nknow three months that's something that\nI'm not going to be interested in my\ngoals or my my insecurity in the way\nthat I appear won't map on to the\nscreening questions right because what I\nactually want to do is I want to put on\nweight I want to build muscle I want to\nbe bigger I'm not interested it doesn't\nbother me that I lost any weight like\nthat's not an issue I don't try to\ncontrol myself by slimming down slimming\ndown slimming down what I actually want\nto strive to do is bulk up bulk up bulk\nup and so as we're sort of learning more\nabout changes in male body image and\nBody Image related diagnoses what we're\nsort of discovering is that the old\nsystems of diagnosis don't appear to map\non to men kind of nearly as much and so\nthere are even some studies of of\nthere's kind of a new diagnosis that\npeople are kind of considering called\nmuscle dysmorphia so this is where\npeople are like really really concerned\nabout their lack of musculature and\nreally strive to be like more muscular\nand sometimes to the extent of really\nengaging in very harmful behaviors like\nanabolic steroid use or things like that\nthat actually like really negatively\nimpact them so muscular dysmorphia is an\nexample of a new diagnosis that people\nare starting to explore if you talk to\npeople who have muscular dysmorphia or\nsort of in that vein and by the way men\nabout 2.2 percent of men have muscular\ndysmorphia According to some research so\nremember once again let like the the\nprevalence of anorexia for women is also\naround 2.2 it's like less than one\npercent for men and so what we're\nstarting to see is that if you have a\ncore image with the way that you look\nand for women it may be that I need to\nbe thinner and women have unhealthy\nideals that are portrayed to them by the\nmedia and things like that but those\nideals tend to be like gender specific\nright so for women it tends to be\nfocused on thinness for men it tends to\nbe focused on muscularity and if you\ntake those men who are very very focused\non muscularity and feel like they have\ninsufficient or their body is not\nacceptable enough and you start to ask\nthem more specific questions what you\nsort of discover is that you kind of get\nthe same number of people men and women\nwho are unsatisfied with their body and\nand the number tends to be around two\npercent so that's kind of like an\ninteresting Discovery so as we've done\nmore and more research on men and how\ntheir their appearance what we started\nto discover is that it just looks\ndifferent in men that the root is still\nthe same that when I look in the mirror\nI'm fundamentally unsatisfied with what\nI see but the way that that that\ndissatisfaction with my appearance\nmanifests in the kinds of questions that\nneed to be asked are not actually the\nstandard screening questions for things\nlike eating disorder or even body\ndysmorphia which is usually focused on a\nparticular feature like your nose or\nchin or whatever so this is kind of a\nreally important Discovery because I\nthink what what it sort of suggests is\nthat probably for the past two\ngenerations we've had men who have\nprobably had something similar to an\neating disorder or a body dysmorphic\ndisorder but our diagnostic criteria\nhave not really been able to pick that\nup this is becoming increasingly\nproblematic because what we're sort of\nseeing is that changes in social media\nand Technology tend to be propagating\nthis phenomenon so this is where I just\nmade a statement that for the past two\ngenerations there's a chance that we've\nbeen sort of missing diagnoses for lots\nof men but that may not necessarily be\nthe case what we could actually be\nseeing is that actually it wasn't that\nbad let's say one generation to go 50\nyears ago 60 years ago but now what\nwe're seeing is an acceleration of body\nimage related mental health issues in\nmen because of things like social media\nand so as we've done a lot of research\nwe've done we've discovered a lot of\nreally interesting things so the first\nis about 85 percent of college students\nin one study that was done in France\nare unsatisfied with their muscularity\nnow this doesn't mean that they have\nmuscular dysmorphia what this sort of\nmeans is that 85 percent of college-aged\nmen in France at least and this is I\nthink pretty generalizable tend to be\npretty unhappy with the way that they\nlook and that probably is influenced by\nsocial media so what we sort of see is\nthat much like the same factors that\ndrive unhealthy body image in women also\nDrive unhealthy body image in men and\nsocial media is a big part of that so as\nwe tunnel down and we start to ask men\nwho feel uncomfortable with the way that\nthey look okay what's going on in your\nlife like where do these thoughts come\nfrom what is your upbringing been like\nwhat we discover is actually quite\nshocking okay so we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about that so as awareness\nthat body image issues in men may be\nworse or look different from body Images\nthe way that body Images look in women\nas awareness of this has grown\nresearchers and clinicians have started\nto dive more into men who struggle with\nbody image issues and what we've what\nthey've tried to do is figure out okay\nhow big of a problem is this and more\nimportantly how do we detect the problem\nhow do we catch all the people who have\nfallen through the net and what we've\ndiscovered is actually incredibly\nfascinating so the first thing is that\nanywhere between 25 and 68 percent of\nmen with body image issues have very\nvery critical or emotionally abusive\nparents so emotional abuse by parents or\nbeing neglectful or parents chiding your\nappearance or making fun of your\nappearance seems to correlate very very\nvery highly with having male body image\nissues once again this may not be very\ndifferent compared to women so we women\nmay experience sort of the same numbers\nand that's sort of shared right so we\nknow that if you've got critical parents\nthat there's a greater chance that\nyou'll develop body image related issues\nother really shocking things include so\nsometimes we'll see high incidences of\ntrauma so including like 28 in one study\nof men with body image issues were\nactually sexually abused so that's a\nshockingly high statistic that I think\nis probably a bit of an outlier but we\nwe definitely see a history of abuse or\nemotional neglect or very very critical\nparents and especially parents who are\ncritical of appearance another thing\nthat we tend to see when when we explore\nwhat's what's it like to have body image\nissues as a man we tend to see that\nthere's a lot of social anxiety and so\nthis is kind of interesting but it seems\nlike one of the most common\nmanifestations of body image issues is\nwhat men will describe as socially\nanxious so if you kind of tunnel down\ninto this what you find is that they\ncompare a lot and they also do upward\ncomparisons so some people in their head\nwill be constantly or commonly comparing\nthemselves to someone else or some kind\nof Ideal and will be falling short the\ninteresting thing is that when you ask\nthis person okay like what do you\nexperience they won't say oh yeah I have\nbody image issue what they will describe\nsubjectively is that I'm socially\nanxious because what that sort of means\nis that when they go into social\nsituations why do they think they have\nsocial anxiety it's because their mind\nis constantly making image related\ncomparisons with other people around\nthem that's really what their\nmanifestation of social anxiety looks\nlike we also tend to see that men with\nbody image issues are high on the Alexa\nthymia scale so alexithymia is the\ninability to\nrecognize or name your emotions so they\ntend to feel a lot but they're not\nreally sure what they feel and they're\nalmost colorblind to it and when we\nbecome colorblind to our feelings what\ntends to happen is we start to form\ncomplex almost logical narratives in our\nhead about the way we feel about\nourselves and the way Society is and\nthings like that so those emotions we\ndon't recognize them as emotions they\nalmost transform into something like\nlogic in our minds and so as we tunnel\ndown into like what we know about men\nwho struggle with body image issues and\nthis is another huge problem with the\nresearch is that most of the research I\nwould say I read about 20 papers\num in preparation for this in including\ntextbooks and things like that or sorry\nnot including textbooks and stuff and I\nI would say about\nuh 30 to 50 percent of the papers that I\nread actually focused on bodybuilders so\nthis is another problem that we have on\nresearch for men with body image issues\nis that we tend to focus on people who\nare bodybuilders and and sort of very\nvery obsessively exercise whereas my\nguess is that actually a lot of what\nwe're seeing in terms of male mental\nhealth problems may be more related to\nbody image issues than something else\nbut it manifests in kind of a different\nway it manifests as social anxiety it\nmanifests as shame it manifestes all of\nthese different things but as you\nactually tunnel down my guess is that\nthere's a lot of men out there who\nfundamentally don't feel good about\nthemselves when they look in the mirror\nnow some of this may be within the\nnormal range right it's not necessarily\na psychiatric illness like we sort of\nmentioned 85 percent of college men in\nFrance in a particular study felt really\nreally unsatisfied with their appearance\nand I would imagine that upwards of 50\npercent of women I don't know exactly\nwhat the number is also probably feel\nvery dissatisfied with their appearance\nwhen they look in the mirror what we're\nsort of noticing though is that that the\nmanifestations of these body image\nissues may be masquerading as other\nthings they'll manifest as something\nlike social anxiety or social withdrawal\nwhich is very common for men with body\nimage issues they also manifest as other\nthings like emotional numbness as well\nas uh what was I was going to say one\nother thing that's really common\nemotional numbness social withdrawal\nyeah like social isolation is another\npiece of it and the other really\ninteresting thing is that even if you\nlook at this whole like Alpha Beta thing\nright so the alpha beta thing if you\nreally look at what's the foundational\nbelief for this Alpha Beta conversation\nat the bottom of of the whole belief\nsystem is an image issue right it's that\nthere's a particular ideal those people\nare the alphas and people who don't fit\ninto that ideal are the betas the other\ninteresting thing about a lot of the\nalpha beta dialogue or discussion is\nthat it shares a lot of features of that\nirrational logical belief system right\nwhat do I mean by illogical I mean\nlogical irrational belief system what I\nmean is that it's internally consistent\nin terms of logic but it's not actually\nlike based in science or more\nimportantly people who make progress in\nterms of their appearance don't actually\nfeel better about themselves right once\na beta always a beta and once an alpha\nalways an alpha so these kind of\nunchangeable qualities I actually wonder\nif a portion of those people are more in\nthe bucket of actually having like a\nmasculine body dysmorphia kind of\ndiagnosis now we can't diagnose people\nover the Internet that's not what we're\ndesigned to do and we're also not we\ndon't even know that that diagnosis\nreally exists the reason that I'm\nsharing this stuff with you all is\nbecause I think that these core issues\nof body image are starting to manifest\nsomewhat differently in men and\nespecially because of things like social\nmedia we're seeing people check a lot of\nthese boxes right so this is sort of the\ncore reason I'm having the doing this\nlecture today is because I think if you\nlook at people on the internet they\ncheck so many of the boxes of what we've\nlearned for like male related body\ndysmorphia so emotional neglect in\nchildhood sometimes even rising to the\nlevel of emotional abuse hyper-critical\nparents we're also seeing social\navoidance social withdrawal a lot of\nappearance based on comparison and\nspecifically upward comparison so a lot\nof these people's thoughts are focused\non how I look versus how someone else\nlooks we're also seeing a high degree of\nalexithymia amongst a subset of of men\non the internet and then the last thing\nis that there's sort of this intractable\nbelief that no matter how much I change\nit's never going to be enough right so\nother people will be able to exercise\nbut I won't be able to exercise or even\nif I exercise it won't be enough because\nmy jawline is is insurmountable so if we\ngo back to thinking about okay what are\nlike healthy responses to sort of being\nunhappy with the way a healthy response\nto it is okay let me go exercise and\nthen when I look in the mirror I feel\nbetter about myself but what I'm\nnoticing is that there's a subset of\npeople who are men on the internet who\nno matter what they do for their\nappearance it never feels like it's\nenough and so when I see all of these\nsort of research-based risk factors for\nbody image issues and I see a diagnostic\nsystem that was sort of developed\nprimarily by working with Caucasian\nwomen I start to scratch my head and\nwonder okay if you check all these boxes\ndo you really have social anxiety or at\nthe core of all of this stuff is when\nyou look in the mirror no matter what is\nactually there or what you do you're\nalways going to feel unsatisfied by it\nand if the answer to that question is\nyes then I think we could be seeing sort\nof an emerging body image related\ndiagnosis format so if you feel like you\nyou kind of fit some of these boxes and\nand this is the really challenging thing\nis I would encourage you to go see\nsomeone like a therapist because and\nthis is also where things get a little\nbit tricky because the therapist is also\ngoing to have to understand that like\nyou may have a body image related issue\nthat may not look like anorexia or binge\neating disorder that it may manifest in\na slightly different way or drastically\ndifferent way and so this is what's\nreally tricky is that we're even a\npsychiatrist we're recognizing that the\nworld is changing people or changing\ntechnology is changing the way that we\nperceive ourselves and so we really\naren't entirely caught up with it so\neven things like muscle dysmorphia which\nis the most common kind of male related\ndiagnosis that's studied is not an\nofficial diagnosis so it's like a\nproposed new diagnosis so if this stuff\nkind of resonates with you I'd strongly\nencourage you to get evaluated but even\nif you get evaluated consider that the\ndefault language that your therapist has\nmay not really perfectly apply to this\nsituation and you may need to be a\nlittle bit more vocal about sort of\nsharing your thoughts and feelings\num and sort of almost not really\nconvincing but really giving your\ntherapist a window into what your\nmindset truly is so hopefully that's\nhelpful questions let me see if there's\nanything else we want to talk about oh\nyeah there's one other thing that I\nwanted to talk a little bit about\num so there are also a lot of things in\nsocial media which I think could be\npropagating unhealthy body image issues\nthat we actually don't think of as\npropagating unhealthy body issues so\nobviously there's a bunch of stuff on\nsocial media that's like bad makes us\nfeel bad about the way that we look but\nthere's all kinds of things that are\nactually kind of like more acceptable\nright so if you look at someone who's\ngot who's got anorexia and they will\nfrequently post a lot on social media by\nthe way so this is a little bit\ndifferent but men who have body image\nissues one of the one of the things that\ncorrelates with how severe their body\nimage issues are is lack of posting so\noddly enough like people who are very\nvery inactive or inactive in the sense\nthat they don't post selfies so like for\nmen for example correlation with body\nimage issues or selfie posting selfies\nis inversely correlated with body image\nissues so the worst that you feel about\nyourself the less likely you are to post\nwhereas there's some data that suggests\nthat the opposite is true of of women\nthat's just like one example but I think\na good example of this is like cheat\ndays so when we look in social media\nlike in people post about cheat days\nright so this is something that is\ngenerally viewed as like good and\nhealthy and acceptable but if you really\nlook at it like what cheat days kind of\nare is like a binge pattern of eating\nright it's like eating 2 000 calories in\na particular day and we'll sort of like\nsocially glorify this in a lot of ways\nother examples of stuff that has been\nshown to really correlate with negative\nbody image issues especially for men or\nthings like fitspiration so these are\nsituations where like you know we'll\nhave posts and and people will like will\nsort of accept that this is an ideal\nthat we should all strive for so even a\nlot of this like body you know this\nfitspiration like Fitness oriented\ncontent that people make like food\nrelated content that people make may\nactually be having like a negative\ndamaging impact on our mental health\neven though it's sort of like lauded\nright so these people who are like\nFitness influencers for example like we\ndon't think about them as as damaging in\nany way we think about them as inspiring\nand I'm not suggesting I'm that these\npeople are culpable in any way I'm just\nsort of saying this is kind of how our\nsociety has evolved where we sort of\nlike honor those people we raise them up\non a platform we're like wow I really\nwant to look like that and what we're\nstarting to discover is that there may\nbe some negative impacts of that kind of\nthing we're also seeing just as an\ninteresting uh tangent there's another\ndiagnosis that people are proposing\nwhich is orthorexia nervosa and\northorexia nervosa is like a very very\ndisordered perception around what you\neat but it's not about losing weight\nit's about like wanting to be healthy so\nwe'll see some horror stories of parents\nfor example that will deprive their\nchildren of particular like nutrition\nbecause they're very very very focused\non like a particular you know dietary\nstyle that they view as like Fitness\noriented and in the most tragic cases\nwhat we'll actually see is like children\nwho are removed from parents or will\nsuffer like you know medical\ncomplications and drastic drastic cases\ncan even pass away from such those kinds\nof nutrient deficiencies and so if you\nreally look at that like you know what's\ngoing on here we're starting to see a\nlot of different almost obsessional\nbeliefs about particular kinds of food\nand in that case you know is it a\ndisorder Well we'd sort of say Yeah in\nPsychiatry because one of the ways that\nwe Define a disorder is that impairs\nfunction or damages your life in a\nparticular way so if you're so careful\nabout the way that you eat because you\nyou know I'm on this like I saw this\ndiet recently where people were eating\nraw meat and they were getting like\nparasitic infections because that's what\nhappens when you eat raw meat is you get\nparasitic infections and so that would\nsort of like hit the the threshold of\nwhat we would consider a psychiatric\nillness because it's negatively\nimpacting your function now I'm not\ndiagnosing anyone on the internet who's\ndoing that sort of thing I'm just sort\nof saying in general how do we Define\npsychiatric illnesses well the the line\nis does it hurt you and if it hurts you\nin some way then we'll sort of consider\nit a potential psychiatric diagnosis my\npoint is that there's a lot that's\nchanging on the internet and these core\npsychological features of you know\ndisordered eating or beliefs about\nhealth or body image seem to be\nmanifesting in different ways and so you\nall need to be very careful about this\nkind of stuff and if you're finding\nyourself having very very rigid beliefs\nabout what you should be eating or rigid\nrigid beliefs about how you feel about\nyourself or what you see when you look\nin the mirror if you find yourself\nmaking upward comparisons and sort of\nassuming that there's an ideal body\nimage that you will never meet this\ncould be one of those emerging body\nimage kind of issues and I'd encourage\nyou to go see seek help yeah orthorexia\nis really interesting um so fig o12 is\nsaying if I fit every description you\ngave what are the odds of that being my\ndiagnosis the odds are very low okay so\nunderstand this these are not official\ndiagnoses that's actually my whole point\nis that I think something is going on in\nour society where the the shape of\nmental illness or mental suffering is\nchanging and it's changing so fast that\nour diagnostic systems are hopefully\noutdated but sometimes they're like\ncompletely off off base and so my point\nis that like I I'm starting to wonder\nwhether a lot of the people that I've\nworked with who are very very like into\nthis Alpha Beta mindset or who describe\nthemselves as being like emotionally\nnumb and socially anxious but when you\ntunnel down and you actually ask that\nperson okay like what goes on in your\nhead at the root of it is I don't like\nthe way that I look and that person is\nway more handsome than I am they have a\nmesomorphic body type I don't have a\nmesomorphic body type and that rest\nthat's the foundation of all of the\nthoughts so because I'm embarrassed\nabout my appearance I I don't want to go\nout because I'm embarrassed about my\nappearance I don't want to take a\npicture of myself because I'm\nembarrassed about my appearance because\nI don't look like this particular person\nI experience a lot of social anxiety and\nsocial withdrawal and when we think\nabout these terms social anxiety and\nsocial withdrawal we think about social\nanxiety disorder right we think about\nprimarily anxiety Related Disorders\ninstead of body image related issues and\nthat's my point is that I think that we\nmay be like over diagnosing people with\nsocial anxiety who actually have body\nimage issues that's actually like kind\nof the wrong move because what that\nperson may need is something different\nthese mesomorphic Etc body types do they\neven exist sort of my answer is sort of\nthere's some evidence of them it's not\nit's an area of research that basically\ngot abandoned like 40 years ago 50 years\nago so someone's Lord butt pirate is\nasking how about uh body dysmorphia due\nto height this is another thing that I'm\nactually like noticing so I don't know\nif you all have heard about this but\nthere may be body dysmorphia related to\nhigh two this is what I think needs to\nbe explored but there's a lot of\ninterest nowadays days and leg\nlengthening surgery so I remember the\nfirst patient that I saw which was seven\nyears ago who was interested in getting\na leg lengthening surgery and was a\ncollege student and it wasn't I don't\nthink it was legal or performed in the\nU.S at that point so they were telling\nme that they had found a surgeon who\nperformed this surgery in a foreign\ncountry they wanted to fly to the\nforeign country get leg lengthening\nsurgery and like because they had to do\nit overseas and it cost a certain amount\nof out of pocket and stuff like that and\nand you know that was the first time I\nhad heard of it and it sounded very very\nunhealthy to me so I we sort of treated\nthat person kind of like a body\ndysmorphia of sorts um but now what\nwe're actually seeing is that like a lot\nmore people are getting leg lengthening\nsurgery and I don't really know what to\nthink about that like there's a part of\nme that's highly concerned that this\ncould be another example of a body\ndysmorphia where people are like\nessentially going to a surgeon to fix\nsomething about their their body right\nbut it may not be body dysmorphia who\nknows it could just be societal stuff it\ncould just be like we allow allow people\nto change their appearance right so we\nit's not like we anyone who goes and\ngets a rhinoplasty a nose job it has a\npsychiatric illness we just allow people\nto change their parts of their body and\nwe don't necessarily diagnose them with\nan illness like people are allowed to\nchange stuff and so where's the line the\nshort answer is like we don't know but\nthis seems to be changing very rapidly\nthat's why we're sort of trying to bring\nit to your attention so one person is\nsaying I'm short but that sounds way too\nextreme and painful and and someone else\nis saying leg lengthening is pretty safe\nso I've heard a lot of mixed things\nabout leg lengthening surgery in the\nsense of safety will you come out of the\nsurgery alive sure but I haven't looked\nat outcomes on this it's something that\nI'm really curious about but I have\nheard that there can be quite\ndebilitating pain that may not Resort\nresolve actually after surgery so I'm\nsuper curious about what the actual\nnumbers show of like long-term outcomes\nand pain specifically\nif you found this video helpful check\nout Dr K's guide we've spent hundreds of\nhours writing and filming to help people\nunderstand their mind so that they
