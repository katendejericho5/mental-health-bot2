    "transcript": "when you sort of look at yourself what\nI'm kind of hearing is that like a lot\nof negativity comes up\nand so the only time that you end up\nlooking at yourself is when you feel\noverwhelmed in some other direction and\nthen it's like an outpouring\nokay hello\nhi\num and and what do you go by\nAdriana or Adriana okay what would you\nprefer I call you today\num Adrian okay well it's nice to meet\nyou Adriana\num I just wanted to uh start by\nexpressing my appreciation I was I'm\nsorry I know a couple weeks ago you had\nuh you were in our chat and I didn't\nquite see it at the time but I I really\nappreciate you kind of reaching out and\noffering to have a conversation about\num\nyou know what a lot of the challenges\nthat people in The Gaming Community face\nuh\nand\nwas just kind of curious a little bit\nabout what you wanted to talk about\ntoday\num I mostly wanted to talk about\num sexual harassment and assault in\nmale-dominated spaces and how it's very\nlike\nsorry my focus it's kind of normalized\nunfortunately and it's like really sad\nsorry if you heard a little it's really\nsad so\nyeah yeah I I I'd love to have that\nconversation with you and and try to\nlearn what we can from your experience\nand hopefully like make the world a\nsafer place\num and and just to kind of clarify so so\nare you looking to like process trauma\nor do anything like that today on stream\nokay so we're having a conversation\naround sexual assault and harassment and\num\nthe goal is to try to like raise\nawareness and and or at least that's\nwhat I you know I'm hoping for\num and to hear a little bit about your\nexperience does that sound okay with you\nokay so this is not therapy I'm not your\ntherapist or anything like that right\nokay\num so yeah so Adriana can you start by\njust telling me a little bit about like\nuh\nyou know why this topic is important to\nyou and and what your experience of it\nwith has has been\num topic is important to me because\num I have experienced sexual assault\num multiple times throughout my life oh\nmy God even though I've taken\npreventative measures as much as I can\nand um\nand it's it's something that happened to\nme when I was really young but I didn't\nrealize it until I was older\nand then after that\nit was just\nhard to explain I guess it's just\nsomething that I kind of went through\nand I was like okay that sucks that I\nwent through this and I just tried to\npush it down as much as I could because\nI just wanted to move on with my life I\ndidn't want to have to feel that over\nand over again\num but then it started to affect my\nrelationships and then it started to\naffect\num just a lot of things and\nwhat really made me realize like I can't\nsuffer like alone in silence\nis um when I started to have people in\nmy chat like mostly young women who you\nknow trauma dumping is a normal thing\nfor people to do in chats I don't\nencourage it I don't think anybody ever\nshould but it happens every so often you\njust kind of have to be like hey like\nplease don't do that but once I started\nto hear can can I just jump in there for\na second can you tell me what trauma\ndumping is\ntrauma dumping is like when you go like\nin chats is when you go into someone's\nchat and you just start like sharing\nsome really hard experiences that you\nwent through\num a lot of people do it to streamers in\norder to like\nseek like help from them\num and\nso\nwhat I have heard from a lot of people\nis more common than not like that is a\nshared experience for a lot of us women\nespecially in\num like this community of twitch of\ngaming so\nit once I realized that it was really\nhard for me to just like stay silent\nabout my experiences and I needed to\nspeak up\nso I started you know generally speak up\nbut I never really brought anything to\nattention before and the reason why this\nrecent thing was brought to attention a\nwhile ago was because somebody\nthat you should be my friend actually\nlike brought it to attention and then I\nhad to deal with not only\nmy own processing of things but trying\nto feel like I'm fighting so hard to\nvalidate my story\nyeah so\num Adrian I'm kind of noticing that\nwe're sort of like talking around stuff\nright so so you're kind of saying yeah\nbring it to attention\nI don't really know what what it is\num and well before we kind of jump into\nthat so so a couple of things you know\nyou're you don't have to share anything\nthat you're not comfortable sharing\nfirst of all it's okay to talk or like\nin vague terms if that's what you feel\ncomfortable doing uh I know that from my\nperspective\nI I would certainly benefit from a\nlittle bit more clarity because you're\nkind of talking about\nit happens and I'm not sure what it is\nyou also mentioned\num that you've been kind of suffering\nalone and that this has been happening\nfor you uh to you for a while\num and so I'm curious do you feel\ncomfortable like going into a little bit\nmore detailed not not like all the\ndetails of what happened or a\nplay-by-play but just like what are What\nspecifically are we talking about is\nthat okay to talk about\nyeah okay so there's an incident\ninvolving another streamer\num that happened a while ago and it was\nwhere I ended up\num falling asleep at a party\nand the other streamer ended up trying\nto touch me and ended up touching me and\nafter multiple times of my friends\nsaying hey she's okay please leave her\nalone please leave her alone he just\nkept trying to come back into the room\num when I first heard that information I\nwas obviously really uncomfortable and I\njust didn't like want to make a big deal\nor whatever because that's usually what\nmost people\num\ndo in that situation especially when the\nother person is a lot bigger than you in\nterms of numbers and growth in\nfeel that you really want to succeed in\nso can you help me understand that what\nyou said you didn't want to make a big\ndeal\nwhat is making a big deal look like\nmaking a big deal can mean really\nanything even just saying like hey that\nwas really uncomfortable because even if\nyou just say that all of a sudden who\nare you saying that to\nto anybody in public okay\nor to even the person who did that okay\nbecause the minute that happens is the\nminute\nlike\num fingers are pointed there's a lot of\nvictim blaming involved and you have to\nkeep reliving it over and over again\nwhat do you mean by victim blaming\num a lot of people especially recently\nthey\ndon't want to hold people accountable\nso they will blame the victim or the\nSurvivor in this case\num\nfor oh well what like things that are\nmost common like what were you wearing\num\nwhat other kind of questions and by the\nway if I'm interrupting you too much\nplease let me know\noh that's fine um but I I think this is\nexactly like in my mind this is exactly\nwhy we're having this conversation\nbecause I think people will use phrases\nlike victim blaming but I don't even\nknow that the majority of people out\nthere know what that looks like know\nwhat the experience of it is\nI think victim blaming is when you are\nsexually assaulted\num you already have that very intense\nfeeling of Shame and guilt because it's\nnot something that\nit's something that you feel like your\nown body and your own rights to your\nbody have been taken away from you so\nwhen you already feel that shame and\nguilt you're all ready for me trying to\nguilt yourself oh well I guess I\nshouldn't have done this oh I guess I\nshouldn't have done that like like well\nI shouldn't have done that like I'm\nalready blaming myself because it's like\nI just wish that didn't happen to me and\nI wish that things gone differently but\nthen once you start hearing other people\nblame you you just start feeling more\nand more guilt\nand it takes so it took me so long to\nprocess\nthat it wasn't my fault\nand\nwhat the reason a lot of people don't\ncome out about these things is it's a\ncommon feeling to feel that shame and\nthat guilt\nand\nwhen\num\nyou know it takes a while to process\nthat it's not your fault\nbut then once they process that and\nthey're like okay now I should share my\nstory sharing your story opens up the\ndoor for more people to put that shame\nand that guilt you're originally feeling\nback onto you that you back onto yeah so\nit kind of just reopens the womb and\nthat's why\nit's just really hard and that's why a\nlot of people don't\nExpress their stories\nso can you help me understand what your\nexperience of being when people victim\nblamed what that looked like\nor you know what did they say what did\nthey do what was your experience of it\num\nin\nthe two times\nthat has happened to me\num it's kind of like\noh well you shouldn't have drank\noh well you shouldn't have\ntalked to him\noh well to him\nyeah I've heard everything so you\nshouldn't have\nput yourself in that position in what\nposition was that what are they\nreferring to when they say that position\nbeing at a party\nI shouldn't have gone to a party\nexactly and it's hard because like I've\nalready told myself these things for so\nlong\nso when they say it what is what does\nthat do I mean if you've been telling\nyourself that for so long and and now\nyou're hearing it from other people how\ndoes that affect you\num\nit obviously\nin this situation I feel like it's put\nme in like\nstate of um disassociation\nbecause\num the first time the story came out\nI've heard so much of it and it sent me\ninto like a really bad depression\num but this time I feel like\nlike disassociating almost like I don't\neven know what I feel really like it's\nhard to sounds like you feel numb like\nyeah it's hard to determine my feelings\nbut every so often within the past two\nthree weeks that this has been up for\ndiscussion on the internet\num\nI've had like a couple like big\nbreakdowns but then it just goes back to\nthe numb okay\nso when you said that when this came out\nso it sounds like you did not speak up\nfirst\ncan you help me understand that whole\nthing I yeah I didn't speak up about it\nbecause I knew the person was more\npowerful than me and\num I knew I my dream was to just you\nknow be sure to be a content creator and\nI moved all the way to Austin to do it\nand I was like it's fine you know I'm\njust gonna\nput my head down and you know not\ninteract with this person and I'm just\ngoing to\ncontinue to live my life and um\nthen how did somebody sorry everything\nthat you say has I I get so curious and\nI want to learn more so I'll pause and\nlet you finish I'm sorry okay\num so somebody I used to be friends with\nended up speaking about it on her stream\num and we weren't friends at the time\nwhen she spoke about it we she had me\nblocked on Twitter but then she\nunblocked me she's like I spoke about\nthis and I was like oh so I was kind of\nlike pushed into something I wasn't\nready to talk about\num\nand\nyeah and then I was kind of like not\nready it wasn't really like ready in my\nbrain to talk about it or process it so\nI was in a very vulnerable state when I\nwas like getting spam called and like\nrushed to make a statement about it\nthere was people who came over to\nconvince me or to tell me like I need to\nsay something I need to say something\nand I just wasn't like really ready to\nsay anything do you but I had to\nwhy why did you have to say something\num because\neveryone was the people who knew that it\nhappened that I was that person you\ntalked about\num they ended up like calling me a lot\nspam calling me and then\num\nI ended up going to my friend's house\nto talk to him about it and maybe think\nabout making a twit longer and then they\ncame over and they're like okay how are\nwe gonna do this how are we gonna\naddress this it was like a boardroom\nmeeting or whatever and I was like okay\nlike and I had the intention that these\npeople were there to like help me\nbut I I found out a couple weeks later\nthat that wasn't the case but\nin the moment I thought they were there\nto help me\ncan I think for a second\nof course\nso\nthe first thing there's so much about\nthis Adriana that I think makes a lot of\nsense\nand there's so much about this that\ncompletely perplexes me\nso the first thing that's kind of\nconfusing for me is like\nI need to make a statement says who\nlike I'm so and I'm not saying I I can\nit's very clear to me that you are under\na lot of pressure I'm guessing that\nother people felt like they were under a\nlot of pressure\nyou know there's this sort of idea that\nwe have to like advocate for people who\nare victims right like we've got to like\nseek Justice I mean like I I think that\nthere's a lot of\ngood sentiment there\nbut what I'm kind of noticing is that\nfirst of all like you didn't ask for the\nconversation\nand once the conversation got started\nyou weren't really mentally in a place\nto make a statement but I'm also hearing\nthat like\nthat was somehow unacceptable that\nit wasn't being addressed\ncan you help me understand that like\nwhere is that pressure coming from what\nare people like thinking what why do you\nfeel like you have to make a statement\nthere's a couple of things that were\ngoing through my mind that day\num I'm just trying to\nI kind of like compartmentalized this\nday after especially this past couple\nweeks but\num\nthe main thing that\nwas happening was\num\na lot of panic a lot of people\nspecifically\npeople that the person was friends with\nsaying we need to find this girl we need\nto talk to this girl we need to hear the\ntruth or whatever\nand um\nso there's just a big Panic on the\ninternet trying to like see like who is\nthis girl like what is this and like\nthere's a lot of pressure knowing that\nthat was me\nand and I knew it was wrong\nso when you knew what was wrong\napproached the original assault or so\nsomething yeah being touched when I was\nasleep okay\num\nso and I and I didn't really want\nanybody to go through that experience so\nas I was sitting in the little Board\nRoom I was hearing a bunch of different\nthings people telling me\nlike are you sure are you sure are you\nsure and like what are you what are you\nhearing when people say that or ask that\nquestion\ndoubt\nthat like of what happened to me\nso especially when they're like well we\nknow our friend we know our friend like\nand they would say those they wouldn't\ndo that yeah\nso how do you deal with that when when\npeople are\ndoubting you and\nsaying we know our friend how what what\nhappens in your mind or what happens in\nthe in someone's mind in that situation\njust as I said it like re it brings up\nlike\nthe feelings I originally felt of like\nguilt and shame because it's like\nlike wow this person did this thing to\nme that's actually horrible\nbut\nif I say something\nlike I'm gonna ruin their life\nand it's like\nit like makes me feel almost bad in that\nmoment but then once I clear my head I'm\nlike\nI don't want this to happen to anybody\nelse like no one deserves to\nfeel like their body isn't theirs you\nknow but in that moment when these\npeople are saying that's our friend like\nthis is what's gonna happen to him if\nyou do this like he's gonna have to get\nkicked out we're gonna have to like not\nbe his friend anymore it's almost like\nthey're re-dating that feeling of guilt\nand they're putting it in other places\nlike making me feel bad like oh if I say\nsomething about the truth then it's my\nfault because then they have to lose\ntheir friend or they have to\nkick them out or whatever so then it's\njust reinstating that feeling of guilt\nand putting it in other places so I mean\nwhat is it like to\nthis question may be weird but I'm kind\nof noticing like\nalmost like a weird shift in the power\nDynamic and the responsibility Dynamic\nright like who's responsible for this\nthat in that moment I'm hearing people\nkind of\nso what happens now\nand who's responsible for ruining the\nlife is you\nright like if you speak up like you have\nthe power\nAdriana you have the power to make this\ngo away\nyeah so yeah go ahead\nwe're not like I'm hearing that it's\nlike\nlike I don't know what to do\nyou know\nand then in that moment I'm thinking\nabout all the girls in my chat who just\nplay Minecraft on stream\nand we're constantly like harassed by\nmen in chat who have expressed this to\nme I'm thinking about all these young\ngirls who've experienced these things in\ntheir college campuses and they can't\nsay anything\nor people who've experienced these\nthings at work because I've heard like a\nlot of stories and\nit's like if I don't\nsay anything\nand just let\nthis like go and you know\num then\nit would almost make me feel\nbad too so it's like if I don't say\nanything I feel like I have this\nplatform that was given to me I have\nthese people who look up to me and I'm\nI'm doing them wrong but then if I do\nsay something then I'm doing\nthe bigger people who can really make or\nbreak someone's career I'm doing them\nwrong so I was like okay\nwe'll find a middle point that way you\nknow I'll dumb down my story\nbut I'll still say it what do you mean\nby that way your story\nlike\nI will make\nin terms of the boardroom meeting thing\nwhatever the hell that you want to call\nthat meet up so you were like in a room\nwith a bunch of people who let me\nunderstand were your friends we're not\nyour friends let's go like one\nof them were my friend and then another\none of my friends came home from work\num and then\nwell I guess\nthere was\nlike one okay two of the people that\nwere there\nlived there like the one person and the\nperson came from work they lived there\nand they were there in the room when it\nhappened and they were my friends that I\ntrust\nand then the three other people who came\nover one of them was like an\nacquaintance well two of them were like\nacquaintances\num and one of them I didn't know it all\num and they came over how did they how\ndid they cut I'm so confused like do\nthey just show up or someone invited\nthem or like yeah well they showed up\nbecause\none of the acquaintances was friends\nwith my friend okay so they knew where\nhe lived and they told him we're gonna\ncome over and he was in a meeting when\nthat happened\nso\nhe wasn't able to tell me I was upstairs\ngetting ready in the bathroom or like in\nmy friend's vanity\nand um\nhe wasn't able to tell me hey they're\ncoming over so I'm doing my makeup\nwhatever and I just hear their voices\ndownstairs I'm like oh my God like I'm\nalready going through so much stress\nright now\nlike now this is happening and I was\nlike texting my friends at the time\nbecause I tried to like revisit the\nfeelings after like\nyou know so much time has passed and I\nlike went through my old\nDiscord of like me talking to my friend\nbecause they're like really like good\nfriends of this one person at the time\nstill friends with him and um\nI was like oh my gosh like I'm so\nstressed out and now these people are\nhere like this is just such a hectic day\nlike\nI didn't really want all this happen\nyeah and then noticing how completely\nout of control you are in this situation\nlike\nyeah\nso then you know I talked to all them\nand that was pretty much what I was did\nyou dealt with did you feel like you\ncould say I mean did you want to talk to\nanyone in that room\nno the only person I really wanted to\ntalk to and I thought I was going to\ntalk to that day were my two friends\nthat were there in the room when it\nhappened and that\nlike are my friends that I trust they're\na couple\nso I that was my only people that I\nwanted to talk to that day and then it\njust kind of\nand so you felt like you couldn't\nsay\nI don't want to talk about this with\nacquaintance and one person that like\nyou couldn't say that\nall right and I recognize that may sound\nlike victim blaming as well but I'm I'm\nnot saying I'm not suggesting that you\nshould have said that what I'm trying to\nreally do is understand like\nin that moment\nbecause that\nis that like you know what was going\nthrough your head\nit's kind of like\nlike they were like oh like we need to\nfigure this out we need to figure this\nout and like they were like\nalmost like\nI don't know if this is a good analogy\nor not but\nlike a courtroom and like they had to\nrepresent like their side you know\nthat's kind of what it felt like and it\nalmost felt like I was like\nat the stand like being like no like\nthis is what happened\nand\num\nthat's why it was hard because it was\nlike an ultimatum it's like hey you can\nsay something and then we would kick our\nfriend out and then you probably won't\nget invited to parties and then like\npeople are probably gonna hate on you\nwhatever but then you can like not say\nsomething or you can just be anonymous\nand then like\nwe can figure it out from there and then\nI was like okay and then I was like so I\nwas dealt with that thing that was like\nokay do I use my platform and stick up\nfor people in my audience because at\nthis point like\nthis is a broader scale of um like an\nissue\nor do I\ndo what these bigger streamers want me\nto do\nyou know so that's how we kind of met in\nthe middle but even the middle wasn't\nlike\nmy full truth because a lot of the\nwording wasn't as strong as I wanted it\nto be\nand it didn't really reflect what I was\nfeeling\num\nbut that's why everything got brought to\nlight within the past two or three weeks\num and I was able to say my full truth\nbecause of that\nso Adriana I want to point out a couple\nof things\nand if I say anything that is out of\nline or upsets you or is not in the\ndirection that you want to talk please\nlet me know the last thing that I want\nto do is railroad you into a\nconversation that you don't want to have\nfirst thing is that I'm noticing that\nwhen you're thinking about how to\nproceed in this situation you're\nthinking about your community\nand you're thinking about\nstreamers for lack of a better term\nwhat I'm I'm it's mostly like sorry to\ninterrupt but it's like my career or\nlike these young girls that look up to\nme yeah yeah so so that that's what's\nkind of interesting to me is like I\ndon't hear even in that choice I don't\nhear you\nwhat about you yeah\nI guess it's like\nI didn't really\nokay sorry I'm whenever I like to pause\nI'm just trying to not like cry or\nanything but it's hard to like see it\nfor myself because\nI just don't want it to like be on\nmyself you know because it's like I went\nthrough these hard feelings\nand\nit's like\nI don't know I don't want to see myself\nas a victim\nas much as like I guess I am you know\nit's hard to like\nsee myself as that or like admit that I\nguess to myself because then it's like\nit's true you know and I\nI don't know it's like\nI have a hard time like digesting it I\nguess because then it just kind of\nbrings back\nlike those feelings that were first felt\nafter these like situations\nso I just kind of wanted to think like\nokay I'm gonna do this\nfor someone else because I don't want\nanybody else to feel like this\nso I guess it's about me but it's not\nreally about me because it's like\nit happened to me\nbut what can I do to prevent this from\nhappening to anybody else because these\nfeelings\nlike or something I have to process like\non my own\nand me coming out with anything\nyeah it makes me feel happy if I have\nJustice\nbut it's not going to make the incident\ngo away and it's not going to make the\nfeelings go away\nso that's why it's like when you come\nout about these things it's not\nit's not for me\nit's for\nthese other girls or anybody really that\nregardless of gender that deal with\nthese things and feel like they can't\nsay anything or feel like they're alone\nthis is gonna sound weird\nAdriana but respectfully I kind of\ndisagree\nand here's here's why so you're looking\nout for other people that's awesome\nright like people need to speak but what\nI'm saying is like who's looking out for\nyou\nright like what like\nI don't know right so like it\nand that's kind of what I mean I don't\nmaybe disagree was wrong but like it's\nlike I'm hearing the same thing again\nand like what I'm wondering about is\nlike right here thinking about making\nthe world a better place for other\npeople right\nlike gotta make the world a better place\nlike that's why we're having this\nconversation to raise awareness and\neducate people\nand then there's your career reputations\nruining lives all that kind of stuff\nwhat I'm wondering is like where is the\ncare for you\nI don't know I'm not gonna lie to you I\ndon't know\nand and it because because it sounds\nlike when I ask you a little bit about\nthat\nyou know you talk about like well if I'm\nfocusing on me like then then it opens\nup the whole like victim camera can of\nworms and I have to deal with the victim\nit becomes more real to you\nright like it so it sounds like as long\nas you're focused on other people then\nit it's more it feels like it's more\ntolerable\nyeah I guess so\nand that just makes me kind of sad that\nin in this whole conversation like I'm\nnot\nhearing anyone care about you\nyeah\nbut\nI don't know\nI wish I could I wish I had something to\nsay I normally have things to say but I\ndon't really have anything to say to\nthat because I guess I've never heard it\nfrom that perspective\nyeah you don't have to say anything you\nknow I I okay yeah I\nand I was just sharing an observation I\nwasn't like asking a question like it's\nsomething that no yeah yeah\num is it okay that I said that or asked\nthat question\nyeah for sure I just wish that I knew\nhow to respond to it but I don't okay do\nyou feel like you yeah hold on let me\nthink for a second\nbecause I guess even like\nbeing here it's like I'm not\ndoing it for me either yeah you know\nit's like even being on here like I was\nlike okay I'm gonna go on Dr K and I'm\ngonna talk about these things and how I\nfeel or how I felt in this situation\nso\nother people can realize that I'm human\nand that there are humans that go\nthrough these things it's not just drama\nAndy lsf political whatever War it's\nlike\nhuman feelings and\nlike trauma and\nit is hard to deal with and\nI feel like when I go through my life I\njust push it aside\nand only in moments of weakness like\nmental breakdowns\nI kind of let it all out and I know it's\nreally unhealthy but\num\nthere's like certain things that will\nalso like trigger\nthose responses I guess and like as I\nsaid before that's why it's hard to be\nin romantic relationships or have\nintimate connections with people\nbecause of my past with trauma\num\nlike just certain muscle memory will\ntrigger really bad episodes for me\nand\nit's it's not a fun thing to deal with\nand I don't really want anybody to have\nto deal with this because I'm still\ntrying to figure out how to deal with it\nmyself\nsorry if I just was rambling I'm just\ntrying to find the right words to say\ndo you feel like you were rambling well\nI mean obviously\nyeah I thought it came across as very\nclear can I share with you what I heard\nlet me think for a second whether I want\nto give you the cliff notes version\nor the okay so I'll give you the long so\nlike so first of all\nI get the sense that you feel kind of\nlike uncentered\nand that you kind of don't have time to\ndeal with this crap you have a life to\nlive\nand work to do with streaming\nand\nthe only time that\nwhen you sort of look at yourself what\nI'm kind of hearing is that like a lot\nof negativity comes up\nand so the only time that you end up\nlooking at yourself is when you feel\noverwhelmed in some other direction and\nthen it's like an outpouring\nlike a spiral and so since you have\ndifficulty with Intimacy in\nrelationships right that certainly\ndoesn't make your life easier\nand then then it's kind of like well I\ngotta you know figure out\nall the [ __ ] upness on the inside\nbefore I can go and engage with other\npeople\nbut I don't quite know how to do that I\ndon't really know where to do that when\nto do that\nbut still there's this idea that like\nthe fixing that needs to happen\nhas to happen\nlike you have to do it\nyeah right and and that it needs to be\nfixed before you\nlike\nshow someone what's on the inside of\nAdriana\nbecause it's all like a mess down there\nis kind of the sense that I'm getting\nkind of it's it's kind of like\nfor me it's more of the fear that it's\nnever going to be fixed in that\nyou know I'm not gonna\nI don't want to put the time and effort\nI guess into not that kind of sounds bad\nbut like I don't want to\nin my brain it feels like\na pity party and I don't want to put\nthat\nnegative energy I guess\ninto myself\nbecause I you know I have a lot of\nthings to do as you said like I work a\nlot and\nI\nlike before I was a streamer I worked\nthree jobs and\num\nit's just like\nit's kind of like I have my moments of\nweakness\nand I've used like certain things just\nto try to like like snap out of it like\nwhere I would be like literally\nnot to like I feel like I'm trauma\ndumping but\nlike\nlike I would have these moments of\nweakness where I would be like in my\nworst mental state possible\nmental breakdown on the bathroom floor\nand I'd be like oh my gosh I have to\nstream I have to stream like I told\npeople I was going live today\nso I would do whatever I had available\nto me\nto make myself in a better mood to\nstream\nlike a lot of caffeine\num a lot of yeah\num caffeine\num my prescribed like Adderall\njust whatever I was like gave me that\nboost that's like okay like stop it's\ntime to go live like stop so no more\npity parties for Adriana got [ __ ] to do\nyeah yeah so\nI even have this thing on my\ngoddamn\nmonitor that it sounds so stupid it says\n4m's manic manifesting money Eminem\nbecause I remember I listened to Eminem\nand it like helped me I guess get out of\nmy\nsadness so\nAdriana it's wonderful to see a genuine\nsmile on your face\nthanks I don't know\nbut yeah it's just like\nI don't know I just wanted to like\ntrigger a manic I guess\nis how I would perceive it\nyeah so I would just be like [ __ ]\neverybody it's fine I'm gonna work and\num\nyeah all right you know you you tossed\nout a couple of things that I can't\nreally let slip by no go ahead\num so one is you kind of mentioned that\nwhen you sort of try to work on yourself\nor maybe you try to help yourself it\nfeels kind of like a pity party\nand you also sort of mentioned that like\nyou kind of don't want to waste your\ntime on something that's\nnot really fixable\nyeah\nand so I'm kind of just noticing that\nmaybe you feel like\nkind of busted\nhow how do you understand like how long\nhave you felt that way\num\nI guess\nfor a while\nbecause it doesn't even have to do with\nthis\nmore recent situation\nmaybe like because back when I was\nI'd really like\nrough upbringing I guess\nand um I've always had these\nlike Panic moments\nand um\nafter\nokay I'm sorry this is like really like\ndeep and graphic But like after the\nfirst time I was ever sexually assaulted\nand I didn't realize that that's what it\nwas I was um 14.\nand\nI had\na very rough household environment\num my like my parents\num they weren't together but like my mom\nhad custody of me and it wasn't\nshe wasn't very nice to say the least I\nwon't get into details with that but\num\nI\nkind of like\nalways\nhad to put on a smile for her you know\nbecause if I showed\nweakness in front of her\nit would not be about me anymore so I\ncouldn't\nexpress my feelings I guess in a healthy\nway\nin in my household so what I would do\ngrowing up is I would always reserve my\ncrying for the bathroom because I could\nlock the door\nand I could turn on the shower so no one\nwould hear me\nso\nafter the first time I was\nit's actually salted when I was 14.\num it was kind of a ripple of events\nthat happened I experienced a deep\ndepression for the first time\nthroughout like the span of those months\nand I ended up picking up very bad\nhabits to try to cope with that and I\ncould not tell anybody I couldn't tell\nmy mom because\nshe wouldn't believe me\nand\nI ended up after a while of doing with\nthese bad habits that were just harder\nand harder to cover up\nI expressed it to my stepfather\nand we tried to get help from me\num but then I ended up\nlike going to a mental hospital and then\nI wasn't really able to get the care\nthat I needed because like it was my\nstepdad and wasn't like my mom so it's\nlike my mom was like you're just doing\nthis for attention and she would just\ntell me all the time like you're just\ndoing this for attention and I was like\nokay well and I I wasn't really able to\nget the help that I needed\nuntil I was 17\nbecause when I was 17 when I first\nturned 17. so that was when I was 14 15\nas the depression then when I turned 17\nI got cut off financially so I had to\npay for like my own food and whatever\nelse I just still lived with my parents\nbecause I didn't have a choice but then\nafter a couple months I was able to move\nout\nand\ngo to university and\num\nlike I had to figure out\nlike\nwhat's the word like when you like are\nagain all odds are against you but you\nstill like go through it like you still\nlike Triumph I don't know perseverance I\ndon't know perseverance so I had to\npersevere I guess through all this and\num because like my parents didn't do\ntaxes so I had to like\ndo pay for college all the way up front\nlike no loans or anything so I just\nworked really hard and I like overworked\nmyself and it was very unhealthy to\nmyself but I was able finally get\ntherapy\nespecially because I had to because I\nwant to bring my birds in my dorm\nbecause I had pet birds and I needed a\ntherapist to register them as an\nemotional support animal\nso\ntherapy helped me a lot and it helped me\nreally be mindful and understand my\nfeelings\num and mostly my childhood it helped me\nunpack that a lot so realizing\neven now realizing that\ngrowing up if I expressed my feelings\nor\nweakness or whatever around\nmy own family it wasn't\nit wasn't\nperceived well and it wasn't a good\noutcome\nso I guess that made this habit now that\nI have of\nexpressing my feelings\nand big bursts at a time usually alone\nwell all always alone because I don't\nI'm embarrassed for anybody else to see\nit\num\nyou keep on using this term weakness\ncan you help me understand what that\nmeans\nlike\nI guess\nI feel weak\nwhen I let myself like\nExpress these emotions\nbecause\nI guess it's not the strong thing to do\nand you know sometimes I'll cry on\nstream but it's not the same thing as\nlike\na spiral you know\nI'm not afraid to like Cry on My Stream\nwhether I'm happy or like maybe a little\nbit sad but\nlike a spiral is like a lot different\nif that makes sense\nyeah I'm just trying to process your\nfacial reactions\nsorry I might try not to cry yeah I see\nthat so so I'm I'm not sure exactly\nsince you're not trying to\nI'm gonna try to do what you're trying\nto do\nwhich means I have to be careful about\nwhat I ask\nyou can ask whatever oh I know I can\nbut like do I want to\nright because here you because like I\nmean I and I I think honestly like I\ndidn't think that was like a you know\nI didn't think that was a\nsometimes we ask like powerful questions\nlike oh my God like\nyou know like well ask questions like oh\nmy God\nbut I I was just I was just pointing out\nsomething about you know the language\nthat you use which is like this term of\nweakness and then this whole thing is\nlike right under the surface\nyeah I guess\nthat's why I don't talk about it because\nwhen you shine the spotlight on me a\nbunch of things just fall out yeah so so\nthen I'm not you know and if if a theme\nof of today is like being unprepared for\nconversations\nand not forcing people into\nbeing you know\nso so I'm I'm just trying to think a\nlittle bit about like\nbecause I\ncan I think for a second\nyes\nso what I'm hearing is that you feel\nweak\nand that you carry that feeling you've\ncarried it with you for a long time\num\nI'm also hearing like some really\nbizarre stuff like\ngoing to a mental hospital for attention\nand and what that kind of makes me\nwonder is like\nwho is that you know when someone says\nyou're doing it for attention usually\nwhat that means is you're taking\nattention away from me\nright which is like no we're not\nI'm not having a mental breakdown\nto try to you know take attention away\nfrom you like believe it or not yeah\nmaybe the reason I'm having a mental\nbreakdown is because I'm struggling in\nsome way and I actually don't give two\nshits about who anyone is paying\nattention to I'm just managing I'm\nhaving trouble managing my internal\nenvironment\nyeah\nyou look like you're about to say\nsomething\nyeah I mean\nlike even me wanting to defend that it's\nlike yeah oh yeah it's it's me\nit's me like really feeling like I have\nto defend it like oh well actually yeah\nbecause but I don't I don't have to but\nI just I feel like I do because I feel\nlike I have to be like oh well like I\nreally wasn't doing it for attention\nbecause even these harmful things I was\ndoing I was oh I would always hide like\nI didn't let anybody see them yet\nthere's a lot of stuff like Adriana that\nthat I'm hearing that kind of makes me\nthink a little bit like one is so you\ntend to use the passive voice a lot\nso like so that means that like you'll\nsay like\nyou you didn't say I persevered\nyou'll say something like I was able to\npersevere\nlike any time you talk about one of your\nsuccesses you it's never I plus verb\nand then it's it's always like well\nafter I moved out things happened and I\nwas able to go to college\nbut you don't say like I worked my ass\noff and paid my way through school\nwhich is what it sounds like\nso I I guess\nyeah it's like I guess\nI only feel like that when I'm\nin like a high high I guess I'm gonna\nshow my phone like in a high high I feel\nlike oh yeah like yeah I did that but\nthen like\nwhen I'm not in that I feel I guess\nyeah I feel like it's a lot of like\nright now there is a lot of pressure on\nme because people are finding any way to\ndiscredit me as a person in my\nexperiences and that's why it's really\nhard because\nit's really hard like everything is\nbeing looked under under a microscope\nso it's like I can sit here and be like\nhey like\nI I was really sad or I'm sad and then\nthey'll be like yeah well here's a\npicture of you having fun like three\nmonths ago so you're clearly not sad\nbecause look at this photo of you\nsmiling and it's like bruh like it's\njust it's like ridiculous the the things\nthat our people are saying but I guess\nit just reopens that kind of\nthing I've dealt with throughout my\nchildhood of like oh well you're just\ndoing it for attention\nyou know yeah I mean that's\nI'm kind of curious though what what\nit's\nwhat's it like having your life under a\nmicroscope\nI mean I've always had my life on the\ninternet so I've always you know\nbeen conscious of that but at the same\ntime I I grew up on the internet I grew\nup streaming I started streaming on\nTwitch when I was 18 but I was streaming\non you now throughout my childhood and\nlike throughout my teen life and\nlike playing guitar I was really 13\nyears old playing guitar on YouNow\nand\num\nyou know I I always had to be conscious\nof like\nmy internet life I guess and my my life\nwas just always on the internet and then\nI started streaming for fun when I was\n18. just because I wanted someone or on\nTwitch because I wanted someone to talk\nto because I was really lonely\nand\nI just got out of a breakup and I was in\nuniversity alone because I didn't have a\nroommate and\num I would just you know meet some\ninternet friends I had a really good\ntime\nand I always want to be a YouTuber so\nI'd always just be like what's in front\nof my YouTube guys\nI'm not a streamer I want to be a\nYouTuber and then I ended up really\nliking streaming and wanted to be a\nstreamer\nso so what's it sorry that was kind of\noff track yeah that's totally fine how\ndo you feel when you go off track\nbad I guess\nbecause I I should probably be focused\nwell so yeah so we're gonna try to learn\na lesson today\nAdriana and this maybe arrogant or\npaternalistic for me to say\nbut\nI have a wild idea like whatever you\nfeel like talking about is the right\nthing to talk about\nso\nI guess it's just\neverything I do now it makes me feel\nlike okay what are they gonna say about\nit\nyou know like like even my friends joke\nabout it like I was like oh this is my\noutfit for today and my friend's like oh\nmy gosh you're gonna wear the color red\npeople are gonna start being like she\nwore bread for a reason she wore red\nbecause it's the color of this this is\nand then like just like nitpick\nliterally everything like even my\nfriends like realize it so they just\njoke about it all the time because yo\nthat's I mean because you talk about\nbeing under a microscope I'm almost\nhearing that you're kind of like being\ndissected\nlike when people are like oh my God look\nat the attention grabbing she's doing\nwith that red outfit yeah oh my God can\nyou believe her the nerve\nthe nerve that's that's exactly what\nit's like\nof wearing clothing\nlike oh my God she listens to Katy Perry\nwell Katy Perry had a song about sex\nonce so it explains a lot why Adriano is\nlike doing all these things so it's like\nbro\nyeah Katy Perry push her in the back\nthat's that's the reference what how do\nyou how do you I was about to ask how\ndoes that make you feel but what I'm\nwondering is like how the [ __ ] do you\ndeal with that like what do you what do\nyou do\nin that like I don't know I really don't\nthat's the thing I don't know what to do\nand I'm I'm it's like\nGary because I'm like almost scared for\nmy safety at some points because of like\nthe things I read and I just\nmy friend's like don't look at that\ndon't look at that and they just like\nmake sure I don't but\nit's like\nit's almost like harassment the way\npeople like I can't be I tweeted like\nhappy bisexual visibility day because it\nwas my sexual visibility day and I'm\nbisexual and I know a lot of people in\nmy community that are as well and then\neveryone's like oh yeah\nyou're bisexual that explains a lot and\nthen they just start like it's like I\ncan't even explain I don't\nthat's what I'm saying like these people\njust draw anything from like left field\nis that the right analogy sure\nI think I understand what you're they\npull it out of their ass is that what\nyou're yeah okay\nbecause I understand why like and I\ndon't even know if it's right of me to\nput myself in their perspective you know\nlike I'm like saying like why would they\nthink that and I'm like trying to put\nmyself in perspective\nfrom what I understand I understand why\nthey're upset that maybe someone they\nlooked up to did something bad\nand they don't want to\nthey don't want that to be the truth so\nthey're trying to find any reason why\nmaybe it wouldn't be the truth or maybe\nwhy they would cut them their their\nfavorite streamer or some slack you know\nit's so that's I guess that's how I'm\ntrying yeah I was about to say that\nsounds like that's how you understand\ntheir response that's how I'm trying to\nunderstand it so I don't\nI guess\nI could take it so personally\nI see\nbecause it's easy to take it personally\nit's easy if I'm in the weak mindset as\nI say to myself I know you said you\ndon't like me saying that but\nlike when I'm not sure everything's fine\nyou're using language that I don't like\nis that okay\nyeah you're damn right it is\nso when I'm not in that mindset I just\nlike breeze\nchilling whatever\nbut then when it something triggers me\nto be in that mindset everything starts\nbeing personal\neverything starts being\nharmful to me and I start being like Oh\nlike these people are calling me like\n[ __ ] and [ __ ] maybe they're right and\nI just I take it really personally and\nbut that's not most of the time it's\njust in those moments so\nand it's um it's hard because\nthroughout\nand even saying this is just giving me\nan ammo but I'm gonna say anyways\nbecause I've said these things on my\nstream before\nand they'll probably find it so\nthroughout\nbeing on my own at 17 and coming from a\nfamily I feel didn't love me and not\njust and they're like well my family\ndidn't love me like in like an actual\nlike\nlike\nI don't know you know what I mean it's\nit's like my parents kind of cut me off\nand I kind of had to fend for myself so\nI really just didn't feel that\nlove and just because like throughout my\nchildhood it was like as I stated before\nlike hard to feel accepted for who I am\nso I would go as far as the impossible\nbut\njust my thought okay\nso I\num\nI was just searching for love anywhere I\nguess and when people showed me that\naffection I\ndidn't want to lose them so I had a\nreally intense fear of Abandonment and\num\nmy I wasn't\nlike\nI was in a like kind of bad relationship\nthat wasn't very kind\nto say the least and it was kind of like\nhe would always yell at me\nand be really mean to me\num but I just thought it was normal\nbecause that's kind of how I was raised\nso I'm like this is love because this is\nuh my parents showed me a lot so\nand um\nthen\nhe ended up cheating on me but I wanted\nto make things work out because I didn't\nwant to lose him I had that figured\nabandonment but then after a while I\njust kind of\nit's like whatever so then I was in\ncollege I was on my own and I was just\nnavigating on my own and I just ended up\nin situations that I thought were like\ngood for me but they weren't because I\nwas looking for like love in the wrong\nplaces or whatever\nand can you helped me understand where\nwhere is love in the wrong place and\nwhere's love in the right place\nuh yeah let me I I wrote about this\nbecause I wanted to\nsay I guess\nI just kind of writing on my feelings\nbecause I was in like my weaker moment\nso I wanted to make sure\num\ncan I ask I got my feelings oh okay what\nokay so um I wrote this\nthroughout my independent life I\nstruggled with being used and at the\ntime I just thought I was being normal\nand spontaneous but looking back I\nrealized\nthe situations I put myself in\nbecause I had to grow up really early\nthat's what I wrote\nso it's kind of like\nafter a while\nand a lot of obviously therapy\nI process like hey\nthat's not\nreally\na good thing you know and I realized\nlike that's not where I should be\nlooking for love\nand like I it and then after I stopped\ndoing that\num it's kind of like\nmy perspective like let me just put an\nexample for people who might not be\nunderstanding of this is like\nI would go\nthis guy guy would text me hey you look\nso pretty and so cute like we should\ntotally hang out and I'm like totally I\nwould love to hang out and then we hang\nout and then he puts his arm around me\nI'm like whoa this guy really likes me\nand then he says something like wow\nyou're so good at playing guitar because\nmaybe I'll play the guitar for him or\nsomething and I'd be like wow he likes\nme for who I am\nand then we would partake in activities\nthat were consensual\nand I'd be like wow now he's really\ngonna like me\nand then\nhe would ghost me\nbut then maybe a couple days later he'd\ncome back and be like yo like let's\nwatch a movie and I'm like oh my God yes\nthis guy really likes me because he hit\nme up two days later we're gonna go hang\nout again\nand then here just like say things like\nwow like you look so pretty and like\njust like things I'm like oh my God he\nreally likes me and then it would go\nagain and I'll be like okay and then and\nafter a while presumably partake in more\nconsensual activities\nyeah exactly so\nafter a while like then he would\neventually ghost me or whatever and like\nstart doing it to another girl so it's\nlike okay whatever\num you know [ __ ] boy College activities\nso\nit took me a while to realize like I\nguess I'm better than that and not to\nfall for it I guess but how did you\nrealize that yes every\nI guess\nI don't know like a lot of\nself-reflection and like actually one of\nthem was actually getting in a\nrelationship\nand like reflecting because when I was\nin a relationship when I was like\nyou know\nyeah I reflected on like the past and I\nwas like damn and obviously my partner\nat the time was like you didn't deserve\nthat and I was like you know what maybe\nI didn't maybe I didn't deserve that can\nyou hold on one second\nyeah I am going to DM you real quick and\nI want you to check your DMs\nokay\noh it's okay okay sure\nyeah\num\nyeah yeah okay\nokay\nkeep going\noh so then\nyeah so it made me feel like you know\nI um\nI realized that\nyou know I was looking for the wrong\nplaces and this was like when I was like\n18 when all this happened\nso then I'm 19 and I'm like okay I I get\nmoving to a house and like I'm like\nliving my life and I have like this\nnewfound knowledge or whatever so\num Newfound knowledge that you're a\ndecent human being who deserves love\nyeah\nand then I'm like I'm focusing on my\ncareer I want to be a streamer really\nbad\nand um\nthen\nI didn't realize like being able to\nhere's where it's kind of deep I didn't\nrealize being able to partake in like\nsexual activities consensually before\nthat was probably gonna be the last time\nI'd be able to do that comfortably\nsadly because then\num\nI\nended up being\nsexually assaulted in terms of rape\num\nand around that time\nso it was like oh you know and I\nobviously didn't process it so I was\njust like whatever you know that\nhappened it's whatever like\num I almost like I was\nI don't know like I just wanted to not\nreally feel it\nand I just kind of like was like oh\nwhatever like my fault like shouldn't\nhave done that like shouldn't have gone\nto that party shouldn't have put myself\nin that situation you know\nand then\nright after that\nand like not even a month later is when\num the situation happened\nwith the streamer\nand even when I was at that party I'm\nlike okay I'm with my friends and I'm\nsafe like these are the people I went\nwith and these are the people who are\ngoing to be with me throughout the night\nso these people are going to protect me\nand they did because you know things\nhappened that were bad but\nlike I don't want to say it could have\nbeen worse because people used that as\nan argument well well he didn't do all\nthis so it doesn't make it okay\num\nbut the people that were there\nto protect me and keep an eye on me that\nnight ended up doing so and I'm really\ngrateful for that\nbecause\nlike my mind wanders all the time of\nlike\nit could have been worse\nbut it still doesn't\nmake my feelings\ninvalid and it still doesn't make it\nokay\nand\nthat's what I feel like a lot of people\nfail to realize\nyeah so\nyeah\nhow you doing right now\nI'm okay\nI don't know\nhonestly okay it just feels like\nit feels like\nI don't I can't process it\nsure and not that I don't want to\nI'm I can't because I need to do the\nright thing first what is the right\nthing\nlike I guess speaking out\nand raising awareness\nwho is that the right thing for\num a lot of women and men who have\nexperienced these things who\nmaybe don't even realize it or who\nfeel like they can't tell anyone\nis it the right thing for you\nyeah\nI think I'm very glad that it's finally\nbeing talked about because at the end of\nthe day it was so much harder\nto\nbe quiet about it to be like forced to\nbe quiet about it and to see\npeople that I thought were my friends\nand for many years who had my side\nrandomly just turn on me and be like oh\nwell\nactually this person's gonna help my\ncareer and you're not\nand it's like damn\nit was so painful and it was painful\nwhen I would share the story to people\nin the scene like hey like this is\nsomething that\nI'm really upset about and it's\nsomething that is really wrong and they\nwould sit there and be like yeah that's\nthat's [ __ ] up Asia I'm sorry and then\ncontinue to go hang out with that person\nor maybe Farm reactions under their\ntweets\nso and I get it it's just business but\nit's hard\nbecause it's so invalidating\nyou've mentioned kind of\ncareer\npower dynamics\num\nyou know people it sounds like you feel\nquite abandoned by friends of yours for\nthe sake of them kind of advancing their\ncareer\ndo you feel uh up to talking about what\nthat experience has been like for you\nand how you make sense of this all the\nstuff that's going on\nyeah it's like\nit happened with a lot of people so\nit'd be people like even I was really\nclose friends with and\nrandomly\none day I see them hanging out with him\nand it's like hey\nremember when I would literally cry to\nyou and express my feelings to you on\nhow unfair this situation was and how\nhard it was for me\nand you've expressed some more things\nthat have happened to you\nand then\nit's like\nthen it just feels like you weren't\nreally listening it feels like\nthey weren't really listening or they\njust didn't really care\nand I understand because it's like\nI really understand putting your career\nfirst because I was unfortunately\nlike putting trying to save my career\nwhen it first came out and\nthe woman gave me like an ultimatum like\noh like you want to protect your career\nor you wanna who's beautiful I mean\nactually you don't have to name people\nbut I I yeah I'm gonna ask the person in\nthe room the boardroom okay got it okay\nso I was like whip so when I was given\nthe ultimatum I guess I was\nsemi selfish and and trying to meet in\nthe middle because I did want to protect\nmy career but I still want to say\nsomething but I still want to protect my\ncareer and I guess I couldn't have my\ncake and eat it too because then it just\nended up\nboth things going down the drain I ended\nup losing both I wasn't able to say my\nfull truth and my career went down the\ndrain because I was blacklisted from\nthese events and rumors were spread\nabout me\nand it's really unfair because\nI lost a lot of friends that I\noriginally moved across the country for\nand\nit's really sad like I moved all the way\nhere just for\nwe'll lose these friends because\nsomebody decided to touch me when I was\nasleep like it's so clear-cut it's like\nI was asleep like I was asleep like I\ndon't understand how people are like\nwell like I try to put me in any other\nsituation I was literally asleep like I\nI tried to emphasize that so much\nbecause I don't feel like people are\nlistening and like when I hear people go\nagainst it's like\nwhat like I was asleep like how is there\nany way that I could have consented when\nI was asleep\nso\nthat was just really frustrating but the\nmain thing that was really frustrating\nis hearing these rumors about me\nand\num\nlike one of the rumors I heard from\nsomeone I have not even talked to who\nended up being close friends with\nthat\num person\nlike I heard it from a friend so it's\nlike give a telephone but I heard\nthat I am like a [ __ ] who tries to\nsleep with all the Austin streamers\nand that like I'm a [ __ ] and a [ __ ] and\nlike and like just or a [ __ ] or\nwhatever and they like they just try to\nlike say these really hard things about\nme\nbecause\nthey want to make a reason\nfor it to be okay\nthey want to make a reason\nfor\nme being touched when I was asleep to be\njustifiable in their minds because they\nknow their friend [ __ ] up\nbut\nthey don't want instead of being like\ndude [ __ ] you to like the person who did\nit they're just finding reasons to hate\nme and make it okay that it happened to\nme in their own brain and whoever else's\nbrain like oh well it's okay that that\nhappened to her because she's a [ __ ] as\na kid it happened to her because she\ntries to sleep with awesome streamers\nand I should even have to go and say\nthis but I have not slept with a single\nAustin streamer\nin my life\nwhich is like insane that like there was\nsuch a rumor going around that that was\nthe case\nso\nso what I what I'm just to kind of\nclarify so it sounds like you heard a\nrumor\nand you're trying to make sense of who\nwould start this rumor and what they\nmust be thinking\nyeah but if I'm hearing this and and if\nthis is\nbecause I I'm just kind of noticing that\nthere's like\na lot of like low quality information\nfloating around right like people like\nrumor Mills and this and that\num\nbut but I'm not I'm not hearing and and\nyou're you feel very confident that\nyou've been blacklisted\nyeah\num I was like not super confident it was\njust speculation up until one of my\nfriends at the time we were just having\na good time and he just randomly said\nthis I'm like what why didn't you tell\nme this before but he\num\nhe said to me\nuh oh yeah like I got a message from the\nperson who\nuh touched me when we were streaming\ntogether saying that he was really\ntriggered that I was hanging out with\nyou and never to do that again\nand then I was like what the hell and\nthen recently I ended up seeing those\nscreenshots for the first time and it's\nlike Jesus Christ\nand uh then after I came out about it\num it was more of like\nlike a wave of people being like yes I\nwas told not to hang out with you yes\nhere's a screenshot of me being told not\nto hang out with you like I just all the\nall of my like\ntheories in my head after that one thing\nthat was told to me confirmed came true\nand I just heard this wave of people\nsaying like I was trying to hang out\nwith you this this and this here's a\nscreenshot and um it was just really sad\nthat they never said anything before\nbut now that it was like popular for\nme to speak my truth\ninstead of to keep quiet about it\nit was easier to say I see so are you is\nyour career as a streamer like is it GG\nyou're\nhow how do you see it now\nwell I have like a nine to five right\nnow\nbut\num I I'm not gonna give up on content\ncreation because I love content creation\nand I'm not doing it for the numbers it\nwas really awesome to be able to do it\nfor a full-time job but I'm not doing it\nfor the numbers I'm doing it because I\nlove it you know and a lot of people\ncome into my chat\nand this is something recent like I got\na lot of viewers obviously when I was\naddressing the situation initially and\nthen I went kind of back down and a lot\nof people have been like\nhere's your view count\ngood job trying to clout Farm [ __ ] and\nit's like bro like at the end of the day\nI love to stream and I loved my\ncommunity like\nand I love making videos and YouTube\nvideos it's like not something I'm just\ngonna give up you know\nit's not like I pay attention the\nnumbers I don't do it for the numbers\nI'm not gonna sit here and run around\nand be like oh\nthis many viewer Andy you should respect\nme like bruh like and it's crazy how\nmany people like let the numbers get to\ntheir head like that but\num\nwhat do you like about streaming\nI like being able to meet people\nfrom all over and I guess to make people\nlaugh because I've always wanted to like\nkind of be based in comedy and stuff and\num\nit's just fun like the people I met\nthrough streaming is really like kind of\nwholesome and like a lot of people like\nlike being able to make those\nconnections is really awesome like my\nbest friend\num she lived in Chicago before this and\nthen I made her move down here with me\nso now we're like twin but like we like\nwe like hang out and like have fun and\nstuff and\num like a lot of people that I met\nthrough streaming like and my other\nfriend moved here like a lot of people\nthat I like really love and like care\nabout moved here and I get to hang out\nwith them and\nit's just nice and\nyeah\nbut I've always loved video like videos\nmy main passion I guess because I even\nwent to film school because I was like\nwell if I'm not gonna be a YouTuber I\nmight as well edit movies or something\nso\nand\ndo you feel like Adriana you're\num\nhow do you feel about our conversation\ntoday\nI feel\nlike\num\nI feel like\nanxious I guess like I feel like I'm\nglad like I I feel like we touched on a\nlot of topics so far they're really good\num that I I didn't even realize but I\nalso feel like anxious because I'm just\nwaiting for\nsomeone to clip anything I said and be\nlike well look at this\nso but I guess that's just something I\nneed to get over because it's gonna\nhappen further\na while now\nall right\nhmm\nI was gonna say I find it\nI haven't I've been trying to steer\nclear of clippable stuff\nbut I mean of course there's always\nsomething but if there's always going to\nbe something but I mean you know it\nwasn't\nI've certainly done worse I'll say that\nokay uh what i is it okay if I just kind\nof share with you like what I heard from\nyou about this conversation and and\nmaybe like just add a couple of my own\nthoughts\nuh and then if there's anything that's\nI think we're having this conversation\nfor kind of like important reasons with\na capital I and so I just want to make\nsure that we kind of touched on\neverything that we needed to with\nsufficient depth because we still do\nhave some time and if there's something\nlike more that we need to dive into or\ntalk about I'd love to do that\nso\nthe first thing is that\nit sounds like you've had your own\npersonal struggle with all of this\nexperience around sexual assault\naround dealing with guilt dealing with\nshame dealing you know thinking about\nwhat you could have done differently\nonce again a lot of that\nsort of almost like\nnot holding other people responsible at\nthe very beginning and really focusing\non what you could have done which is\nvery natural by the way\num\nand there's actually like brain science\nthat that explains why we do that\nand and so it sounds like you had sort\nof come to some degree of Peace but but\nthen what I'm kind of really noticing or\nwhat I what I felt like I heard is that\nit felt to me like you got strapped into\na roller coaster and then the roller\ncoaster started moving\nand then you didn't really like\nyou weren't Dr like there's no there's\nno wheel on a roller coaster it's not\nyou know ain't no Mario Kart\nthere's no steering wheel it's once you\nboard\nso even like the initial disclosure that\nthere was a sexual assault was like not\nyour choice\npeople are kind of entering\nyour space and telling you how it's\ngoing to be\nyou know I'm gonna try to do my best to\ngive people kind of the benefit of the\ndoubt and and and as you know I'm not\nhearing threats per se but more like hey\nyou need to really think about what\nyou're going to say and like how it\ncould be perceived because like this is\nthe world that we live in and there's a\nlot of Like You Know Drama farming and\nclout chasing and all this kind of stuff\nbut I I'm really kind of just feeling\nlike the conversation just got taken out\nof your hands and became particular\nthings then people are weighing in\nand then you didn't want to like\ndisappoint anyone\nright you didn't want to like get on\nanyone's Blacklist\nwhich you've managed to do anyway\nyeah and and trying to take the middle I\njust end up yeah and following yep and\nand I have some thoughts about that that\nI'll share in a second but\nand then I think that there's just a lot\nof like um and then once it kind of came\nout you know then there's all the victim\nblaming that goes on and and things like\nthat I think that there's uh a lot of\ndoubt\num once again I want to sort of give\npeople the benefit of the doubt there\nand and just\nacknowledge that sometimes when you\ndiscover that someone you care about or\nsomeone you believe is a good person\nuh has committed a sexual assault it can\nfeel really unbelievable and so people\nare\nlike vocally and in that moment kind of\nlike processing their disbelief like\nwith you\nyou know and so I I think sometimes that\ncan ha like I've seen that kind of thing\nhappen and I kind of want to give people\nthe benefit of the doubt I think that\nthat's one end of the spectrum the other\nend of the spectrum is people will try\nto pick apart your story\nright and it's like if you were asleep\nhow did you even know\nyou know and and they'll they'll operate\nin a lot of different ways because\nthey're having you know\nbecause they don't believe you or they\ndon't believe their friend is capable of\nsomething like this and I think that\nalso goes to\nyou know we think about people as good\npeople or bad people\nbut I think most people think of\nthemselves as good people\nand I think\na lot of people will do bad things and\nthey'll do it because they thought they\nwere doing right\num or that it was acceptable or whatever\nand and I think sometimes we forget that\ngood people can commit sexual assaults\nwhat we think of is good people\nand yeah\nbecause most sorry to interrupt but most\num sexual assaults are like people think\nlike oh my gosh like it's you're gonna\nget pulled into an alanine and someone's\njust gonna like\ntake advantage or you write then and\nthere but it's like most sexual assaults\nare people that\nlike you know like like it can be\nanybody like that you know it's a\nco-worker\nfriend a teacher whatever like it's not\nusually well like there's a very low\num\nlike percentage of it that is just like\nAlly\ndark alley whatever\nbut um a lot of it is mostly by people\nthat\nthe victim knows so yeah absolutely so I\nthink about two-thirds of sexual\nassaults are are committed by people\nthat know them and usually also not like\nnot even necessarily like distant\nacquaintances but oftentimes\nfriends family\nbosses employees co-workers like people\nthat you may even know well\num\nand so just kind of going back to like\nwhat I kind of heard you say is that as\npeople started to express skepticism and\nand victim blame and stuff like that it\nkind of like brings up for you like all\nthe shame and guilt and stuff that you\nhave already dealt with\nyeah for sure and then what happens is\npeople make you responsible\nfor ruining someone's career\nit's not the act that they committed\nyeah and and I I've seen that\nin you know very closely as a clinician\nand even in terms of families like oh my\nGod you're tearing this family apart\nif you say something like that it'll\ntear the family apart\nand it's like what I think what tore the\nfamily apart is\nsexual assault\nyeah\nand and then it sounds like there was\nyou know there have been consequences\nfor you very real consequences\nI'm also hearing that\nit's been a challenge for you from uh\nand now we're gonna I'm gonna kind of\nfocus a little bit more on just things\nthat I heard you say and just how you\nkind of approach\nstuff\nso I'm hearing that there's\nweak Adriana\nand weak Adriana doesn't\nweak Adriana feels things\nbut also doesn't get stuff done because\nyou can't feel things and get [ __ ] done\nat the same time right those are like\nyou there's like strong Adriana who gets\nthings done\nand weak Adriana who does not get things\ndone\nyeah\nand\neven then I mean I think I mentioned\nsomething about\nyou know I don't get the sense that\nanyone's like looking out for you in in\na weird way like yourself included\nit sounds to me like\nyou know oftentimes what can happen\nin people who have experienced traumas\nlike they just learn early on that\nthey're not worth it\nthat you don't have value so like who\ncares about what\nyou know you like people will just be\ntaught that we don't care about what you\nwant like oh like here's Adriana\nhaving a breakdown being hospitalized\nfor psychiatric reasons and\nyou're making it all about you and your\nattention seeking oh my God you're doing\nit for attention\nso I'm just trying to imagine if you're\n14 years old or whatever and something\nlike that happens like what do you think\nabout how much you're worth what do you\nlearn about\nhow much you matter\nand I'm kind of hearing\nin a lot of ways you kind of don't\neven from your like because like even\nyou're when you're talking about okay\nhow do I navigate this roller coaster\nlike how do I not piss people off\nhow do I like censor what I say like how\ndo I like temper my it and even then\nit's like okay well I'm doing this for\nothers\naltruism\nwhich which is can be good and healthy\nand all that but you know I I\nhope for you Adriana that you're able to\nfind a place where\nyou can do something for yourself\nyou know you can speak your truth\nbecause it's important to you\nyeah I mean\nthis past time it was pretty important\nto me but\nit\nbeing like quiet for a while just\nreinforce those feelings like\nnobody cares you know like nobody cares\nabout me and those feelings are really\nreinforced as like friends just started\nto drop and\nit's like\nlike I express the feelings to my\nfriends and private a lot and and I\nsometimes I feel like I would just talk\nabout it too much because I would just\nbe so hurt by it and\nwhen I it made me realize like when I\ndid do it for me and when I did Express\nthese feelings for me\npeople didn't care either\nso I always told myself\nwhen I get bigger as a content creator\nI'm gonna come out about it for me\nbut I ended up being granted an\nopportunity\nto talk about it without having to\nbecome a bigger Creator in the first\nplace and um I'm very grateful for the\nopportunity but\num it's you know I'm still facing\nrepercussions regardless and I still\nwould\nand I I had to realize that but it's\nit's\nbetter than\nlike suffering and silence and and\nseeing\nthat person continue to do things\ntowards women you know because the main\nthing that just made me most\nuncomfortable was hearing that\nlike he was also continuing that\nbehavior towards multiple other women\nand that's when I really like just took\nit upon myself like this isn't for me\nanymore\nand you know I I feel good having my\nstory being out but\nit's\nit's not really for me\nin the main reason I like the main thing\nI think about\nyeah I I think that that\nI think a lot of sexual assault victims\nhave\ncome forward and have made the world a\nbetter place because of that\num\nI mean I feel like sorry to interrupt\nbut I I feel like\nthat really helped me realize\nlike what was what happened to me was\nwrong in terms of like other incidents\nbecause\num when the me too thing came out\noriginally I think it was like 2017\num like with Hollywood and everything I\nwas reading some of the stories and I\nwas like\nwait\nwhat like this really like this is this\nisn't okay\nand it made me\nlike I was able to process the fact that\nI got sexually assaulted when I was 14 I\nwas able to process that at 17 and\nrealized like yo that wasn't okay\nbecause for those years in between I'm\njust sitting there like telling myself\nlike\nI really liked him you know like it's\nokay that he did that to me because you\nknow I had a crush on him\nand um but even like after it initially\nhappened\nlike the minute after it happened all I\nwanted to do was throw up I was in like\na State of Shock I didn't know why I'm\nlike why do I feel this way like I like\nhim you know and\nI was in a State of Shock I didn't know\nhow to handle it and I was like on a\ncamping trip with my family I was only\n14 I didn't know what to do but\num that's where I just started getting\ninto like harmful\nthings in order to like feel something I\nguess\num\nand\nuh\nI didn't know how to deal with it and\nthen after\nlike I grew up a little bit and I I like\nhad a relationship at 16. I wasn't able\nto connect\nlike sexually like I wasn't able to\nfigure that out in a healthy way you\nknow like it didn't feel\nnormal and it felt like by the time I\nwas in a relationship with someone for\nnine months before we ever did anything\nand when I did it was just\nit was so hard and it was like a very\nlike traumatizing experience even though\nlike everything was consensual and\neverything was like chill it's like I\ndidn't my body didn't react to it very\nwell so\nit made me realize like why is this\nhappening like is this normal like am I\njust gay like I had a feeling I was like\nbye at the time but I was like damn like\nam I just gay like I don't I don't\nunderstand like why is this happening I\ndidn't understand until I was 17.\nlike a year after\num because then I ended up breaking up\nbut I was 17 and I read the bottom of me\ntwo stories and I'm like\nand I like realized how other people\nprocessed it and I and I read a lot\nabout it and I was like oh my God like\nthis thing that happened when I was 14\nlike that wasn't okay\nit wasn't okay in all these years I just\ntried to make it seem okay\nbut yeah I think on this most\nunfortunate things after traumatic\nexperience is especially sexual lenses\nyou know you feel not okay\nbut you should feel okay and then what\nyou end up doing is\ncontorting yourself\nto like fit back into society right\nbecause like there's a part of you\nthat's sort of like Twisted out of shape\nand then like you're like wait this is\ntwisting out of shape it doesn't feel\nright on the inside\nbut instead of like twisting it back\ninto shape we twist the rest of us\nand then when we try to plug back in we\ndon't fit\nyeah and then it causes all kinds of\nproblems like you know romance sentiment\nrelationships things like that\nand and the biggest problem is that we\ndon't really know like and then since\nwe've like Twisted out of shape and we\ndon't fit\nthen it becomes an us problem like it's\nmy fault now that I I'm so [ __ ] up I\ncan't\nyou know connect with another human\nbeing like I should be able to do this\nlike what's wrong with me\nwhen what really starts is that original\nproblem\nand then we start to take ownership of\nthe whole thing\nand the other thing I I really\nappreciate you sharing all of your\nperspectives and experiences because I\nthink honestly Adriana this is not\ntalked about enough\nso one of the most uh bizarre things is\nlike you know we talk about sexual\nassault as if it's a uniformly\ntraumatizing\nwhereas honestly the most like Clinic is\nanecdotal experience but the most common\nreaction that I see from people is\nsomething that you said earlier which is\nit's whatever\nyeah\nand like people because don't realize\nthat that is kind of like\na very common reaction\nand then it's like\npeople say like oh well you said it was\nwhatever before and now you're saying\nsomething about it\nand it's like\nokay like I don't know\nlike I don't know like the first twit\nlonger obviously that happened I was\nended up\nwe ended up agreeing to say like I was\nobviously persuaded to say that it was\nharassment and not assault\nand it's crazy that everyone's like you\nchange your story you change your story\nthe story is still the same it's just\nthere's more vocabulary words this time\nand because it's the same story I was\ntouched my chest was touched\nlike my chest region was touched it said\nthat the first time\nsorry for not saying boob the first time\nbecause I guess I should have said boob\nthe first time for people to take me\nseriously because the all the facts were\nthere it just said\noh well it's sexual harassment instead\nof assault or whatever\num because I asked to put that in there\nbut then it's like\nit's like\nrunning someone over in your car\nbut then telling someone like\noh I didn't run them over\nand it's like well I see right there\nthat you did well I didn't oh then it\nmust be true then it must what you're\nsaying must be true because I literally\nsaid my chest was touched but then\nthere's my little Cliff side note that\nwas asked to be put in there this is\nassault or harassment not assault and\nthen everyone's like oh well you did\njust tell us you got assaulted but you\njust said it to harassment of salt so\nwe're just gonna take that and run with\nit it's like\nand now people like well you're changing\nyour story it's like I'm really not like\ngo read the first twit longer again I\nI'm just being more expressive of how it\nmade me feel and saying boob instead of\nChess this time because I guess that\nmakes it more valid for people how what\nis it like when you\nwhen this comes out\nand you're talking about being harassed\nor assaulted and like the response that\nyou get is like\nyou didn't capitalize your first letter\nafter a period me\nliterally literally what's that what's\ninvalidating\nbecause it makes me feel like\nlike all this it's almost like\nlike I'm being gaslit\nall over again from like whatever\nbecause I've obviously experienced that\nin my life it makes me feel like people\nare being like oh well it's really not\nthat bad it's not that bad like you're\nexaggerating you're exaggerating and\nbecause I realized that I grew up that\nway it's like I almost feel like am I\nexaggerating and I need like people to\nbe like Adriana you're not like you're\nnot like this is awful that has happened\nto you like I'm so sorry it's happened\nto you like this is awful to like\nre\nremind me that you know I'm not you know\nI know it's gonna get clipped but I that\nmy feelings are valid and that I'm\nallowed to feel uncomfortable I'm\nallowed to feel those feelings because\nI'm allowed to feel like my body wasn't\nmine when it was in that experience\nbecause I was asleep not able to consent\nand all of a sudden someone is taking\nadvantage of that\nand why on Earth do you think that's\nwhat's going to get clipped\nwhat is going to get clipped that I was\nsaying what was going to get clipped was\nsaying that sometimes I feel like maybe\nthe trolls are right and I feel like\nmaybe it isn't that bad but then my\nfriends have to remind me that it's bad\nbecause I already know that lsf comments\nis going to be like see why do her\nfriends need to remind her that it's bad\nso this story is getting all out of\nplace\nI already know like I feel I see them in\nmy brain I see the comments that I'm\ngonna get for saying literally anything\nlike this guy is blue or whatever I just\nsee the way people are gonna spin it\num so\nI guess it's anxiety that I'm feeling\nbut\nyeah sorry this side track but I just it\nis really anxiety what are you\napologizing for again\nrambling I guess and is that okay\nyeah\nbut see now it's tricky because now I'm\ntelling you oh Adriana you're\napologizing bad apologizer and then\nyou're like okay yeah okay right so so\nyou\nI I think it's okay doesn't bother me\nbut yeah I you know I and and the reason\nI pointed out to you is because I I\nthink it\nI mean I know that the internet is a\njudgmental place and sometimes I think\nit's like very easy to forget when\npeople like change their stories and\nthey didn't always well yeah like that's\nwhat happens it's like okay you're\nposting on Reddit should you spend less\ntime on Reddit\nyeah I should well then why don't you\nyour story is inconsistent what are you\ndoing posting on Reddit\nyou should spend like you know like\nthat's just how human beings are and I\nthink sometimes we forget that that\nhuman beings remember things differently\nthat memory is not perfect that as we\nnumb ourselves and bury our feelings\nthat as that process reverses over time\nthat it's like okay to speak up a year\nlater two years later five years later\num it's also\ncommon for stories and perceptions to\nchange that doesn't necessarily mean\nthey're not true\nthat's just how human memory is\nand you know\nyeah I'm just I I'm noticing how much\nRAM\nhow much your RAM is occupied it feels\nto me like you can't even have a free\nconversation because in your own head\nyou're like\nyou've got your own little Board Room up\nthere\nthat's making suggestions to what you\nsay\nit just it's really hard because it\nsounds exhausting I even\nI do it in my like private conversations\ntoo because at this point it's like\nwho do you trust you know and who's\ngonna who's out to get you and who's not\nand like who actually like\ncares for you and like actually cares\nbecause I realized the first time these\npeople who told me they actually cared\ndidn't\nso since I realized that months later\nnow it just makes you feel more anxious\nbecause it's like\nyeah these people are being nice to me\nnow because it's the popular thing to do\nbut what happens if it's not the popular\nthing to do anymore\nwhat happens if\nit blows over like it did last time\nbecause last time when I first came out\nthings people were like I'm so sorry\nthis happened to you those same people\nwent to go comment on that person who\ndid that to me's tweet happy birthday\nand it's like damn like you already\nforgot like it just it's just like a a\ncouple weeks and all of a sudden it's\nokay like like you're the one who's\nsitting here commenting on my thing like\nI'm so sorry this happened to you I'm\nhere for you then you're you're over\nhere interacting with this said person\nthat you claimed yourself was so bad\nlike it's so now when people I have\nconversations with people I don't really\nknow who to trust that sounds very\nisolated close\nyeah I have I have a couple close people\nthat I do trust\nthank God but\num it's hard when people come up to me\nlike hey I'm so sorry whatever like\nI\nhave to really be careful what I say\nbecause it's like oh if I say anything\nman Adriana your life is hard\noh my God\nI guess\nsounds tough but\nbut yeah so\nI don't know I don't I like almost feel\nuncomfortable like saying that my life\nis hard you know yeah that's why I'm\nsaying it\nyeah because it's like whenever I think\nthat it's like okay well I have to be\ngrateful for everything I do have\nlike I am grateful that\nI am\nlike I'm able to be a streamer and stuff\nare you allowed to be\nungrateful for the things that aren't\ngreat\nI don't know\nbecause then I'm being ungrateful\nand I don't I am grateful so I don't\nwant to be ungrateful or seem ungrateful\nbecause I am\nis it possible to be both grateful and\nungrateful at the same time\nsorry my bad\nno yeah I guess it is but I just don't\nknow I feel like maybe they contradict\neach other I think it certainly feels\nthat way\nso this is also something that we see a\nlot\num\nwhen people are\nsuffering usually like after a traumatic\nexperience is that the world becomes\nblack and white and like we're not\nallowed to be it's either or\nright there's\nmanic kickass Adriana\nwho is able to advocate for herself\nlike you kind of suggested you can only\ndo it when you're feeling\nthe four M's right yeah and it's the\nfour ends because it's the emo of the\nfish\nmmm and then it's like the fish and I\nlove that emo so that's why I made that\nmantra for myself\nI'm gonna have to check out that emote\nlater\nI wonder if people are\nit's the opposite of pogfish that people\nare doing the part it's like the fish\nit's not probably it's going like this\nOkay so\num\nyeah I mean I\nI hope you can feel ungrateful too\nI mean I do obviously when I'm in my sad\ntrenches I'm like\n[ __ ] like this is so sad like here's\nsome of my feelings that I feel when I'm\nin my trenches I guess like the low lows\nit's like I feel\nit's like I I feel like oh\nI am a woman\nand in this male dominated space I'm not\ntaken seriously\nand\nthroughout my life I've just been used\nand I'm not seen as a person I'm seen as\nan object or something pretty to look at\nand\nthis is just who I am and if I want to\nprove a point I have to do something\nvery irrational and crazy\nin order to prove a point no matter what\nthe consequence\nmeans to me or my loved ones\nand that's the thought these are\nthoughts that Circle my mind every time\nI have one of these deep breakdowns\nbecause it's like\nit's almost like\nI want to do this irrational thing\nfor other people you know like I I\nbecause I don't want anybody else\nto go through this like I wouldn't wish\nthis upon my worst enemy\nand so and it's hard because see I don't\nknow what it's like what is it like to\ngo through\nsomething that you wouldn't wish on your\nworst enemy\nit's hard and\nI like it sucks because the people who\nhave gone through it\nthey understand\nand it makes me really sad because I\nknow when people understand that they've\ngone through it too\nbut\npeople there's people who can not have\ngone through it and try to understand\nbut you can tell\nthe way people have hate or the way\npeople\nsay these awful things to me you can\ntell they've never gone through it and I\ndon't wish for them to go through it and\nit hurts it almost hurts more when I see\npeople say\nthey understand and they share their\nfeelings too because it hurts knowing\nthat\nthey gonna do it too\nand it just sucks because it's so\nnormalized\nand it's so common so many people have\ngone through it\nand it just sucks because\nit's like that shouldn't be a thing\nthat's like saying like\nlike I got shot in my leg\nand it hurt and I couldn't walk and and\nI couldn't do the things I loved\nwhatever\nit happens when you get shot in the real\nleg\nyou don't expect\n50 other people to come out and be like\nI got shot in the lake too\nlike it's such a weird thing that you\nthink like like people don't be getting\nshot in the leg on a normal basis\nbut then\nyou come out and say oh I got shot in\nthe leg I just didn't tell anybody\nbecause I didn't want to like seem like\nan attention [ __ ] I didn't want people\nto send me gift baskets and Edible\nArrangements so I didn't tell people I\nwas in the hospital for getting shot in\nthe leg\nand then\nwhen people come out like I was shot in\nthe leg and did the same thing too it's\nlike what getting shot in the leg is\nlike really common\nlike I didn't realize it was so common\nbecause I didn't want to say anything\nabout it\nand obviously they didn't either so\nI don't know\nyeah Adriana I really enjoy listening to\nyou talk I mean like I enjoy may not be\nthe right word but it's not like fun\nlike I'm not gonna like yeah you know I\nknow what I mean hey let's everybody get\ntogether on Friday night and watch this\ninterview\nbut yeah but I think there's something\njust really\nI've never heard anyone say it like this\nbut man it's it's so just lies\nthat when you talk about this and\nsomeone else\nshares with you that they understand and\nlike you know\nwho understands and who doesn't\nand that's really sad\nbecause like you know like in order to\nunderstand what I've gone through like\nyou have had to walk a dark Road\nand you kind of see that\nand and so there's there's some degree\nof\nyou know connection but like\nit's such a devastating thing to connect\nover\nI know and it's\nit's sad because\nwhat hurt me the most\nis\nlike expressing my story to my family\nand I thought there'd just be like\nokay like I'm really sorry that happened\nbut\nthe way they reacted they didn't even\nhave to tell me anything\nI just knew\nand it was really hard knowing like they\ndidn't even tell me anything\nbut the way they reacted it just\nit's really hard because I saw that\nthey went through it too\nand\nI don't know it's just\nit's hard\nbut\nI don't know how to ever make people\nunderstand because there's always going\nto be people\nwho want to fight it and there's always\ngoing to be people who are going to\ndefend the people who do these things\nand maybe it's because\nthey really care about that person or\nmaybe it's because they see that\nthemselves in that person\nand maybe they feel guilty themselves so\nit's really\ndisheartening\nyou know what makes me both a little bit\nhappy and a little bit sad I'm gonna\ntear up now too because you know I've\nbeen holding it back for a little while\nbut it's okay to have feelings is you\nyou say I don't know how to make people\nunderstand and yet I think what you've\ndone today is help people understand\nI hope so I hope everything came across\nclear\nbecause sometimes I have all these\nthings I want to say and I don't know\nhow to say them\nbut I think that's normal but a lot of\ntimes when I go into like speech mode\nI kind of don't like I like to be honest\nI probably get off the interview and be\nlike I don't even remember what I said\nand then I'll like watch it back and be\nlike okay don't watch it for a week\nI won't\nyou're gonna be thinking all the wrong\nthings if you watch it right afterwards\none thing I I'd like to leave you with\nAdriana is is um\nthere's some things that I have\ntrouble letting slide\nand one of them is that there's no point\nin trying because it's so busted\nwhich I know you recognize is not\nentirely true\nbut\none thing that when I've worked with\npeople\nwho have managed to heal a fair amount I\nthink one thing that changes is right\nnow you've got all the dark feelings in\nthe dark place\nand then there are times where you're\nfeeling really really good about\nyourself where like you can come first\nbut what I kind of hear when you say\nthings like that is that there's like a\nnormal Adriana who doesn't have either\nof those\nand yeah and what I what I hope you'll\nbe able to find at some point in your\nlife and and certainly more therapy can\nhelp with that it sounds like you've had\nsome already but but also like healthy\nrelationships and things like that it's\nnot just therapy\nis to recognize that like who you are\nright now like are you are you in a high\nare you in a low right now like which\nwhere are you\nor neither\nI'm kind of like\nthroughout the interview I was like\nteetering like oh\nbut then I was like no\nand then I just kind of like\ncompartmentalize it\ninto like this is time for me to speak\nand be clear on what I have to say\nso I'm just kind of like like I was like\nteetering into like oh I'm getting\nemotional and I was like no I need to\nsay these things because it's important\nI guess that's what my brain is saying\nto me like always you need to say these\nthings this is important yeah and so and\nI I think what what happens sometimes is\nwe like\nit's like there's so much flooding in\nour house that we pile up all the water\non the side of the like and we build a\ndam and we block it all off yeah but the\nproblem is the more that you Dam it up\nthe second you open the gates it all\ncomes rushing out\nand and for people\nyou know I I do believe that you can\nheal from this like in a really like\nsolid way in the sense that you can be\nhappy\nand have a healthy relationship and have\nfriends and I I really do believe that's\npossible for you I'm not just saying\nthat because I'm like optimistic I've\nseen it happen before time and time and\ntime again\neven today I think you've demonstrated\nto me at least like\nI hate this work how strong human beings\ncan be\nyeah\nbut I I would say that what I would\nencourage you to consider moving towards\nis a place where like the regular you\ncan feel\nall of those things which I know sounds\nkind of foreign but that you don't have\nto be\nat a high high to feel good about\nyourself and prioritize yourself\nthat you even don't have to be at a low\nlow to feel ungrateful\nright that you can be kind of like a\nneutral you on a regular day you can\nhave a cup of coffee in the morning and\nbe like man there's a poor portion of my\nlife that was absolute [ __ ]\nand then go about your day\nthe word\nthe thing about yeah I get you\nlike that I'd be able to feel that\nfeeling and then\nbecause sometimes like what I do is when\nI'm feeling okay is I'll joke about it\nand be like oh my gosh\nyeah so that's that's it's dumb like\nlike obviously this was like a really\nimpactful thing that really hurt me but\nlike I'll be like my friend will be like\nfalling asleep at a party or something\nlike he'll be like just like it was like\na guy he was like this like kind of fall\nasleep about a chair and I'm like don't\nfall asleep at a party don't fall asleep\nthis is the worst mistake I've made in\nmy life and everybody's like laughing\nlike like my friends are laughing\neveryone else is like what the [ __ ] is\nshe talking about why is she yelling I'm\nlike don't fall asleep don't do it and\num like you know I just joke about it\nbecause it's like\nwhen I'm in that good mood I'm not gonna\nlike yes I like I'm aware that it\nhappened to me but I just kind of like\npass it off with comedy I mean I think\nhonestly I think that's a step in the\nright direction which\nis you know not to make fun of sexual\nassault but but for you to be able to\nacknowledge a part of your life\nnot push it away not numb it up\nand still like continue living\nright\nand and\nyou know\nI I hope you're able to find that one\nday where you can just live like a\nnormal life instead of have these parts\nof your life that are just completely\nseparate and then threaten to overwhelm\nyou\nyeah\nI hope so\nlet me see if I made sure I said\neverything\nbut because as I said I wrote this when\nI was in my low so I was able to think\nmore clearly\nas in terms of my feelings\num\nyeah I guess I said everything\nlet's go look at that\nthat's kind of\nyeah\nI did say everything that I was feeling\nso that's good is there anything a row I\nguess\nhow do you feel about saying everything\nthat you wanted to say\nI feel good because\nI know that I said what I wanted to say\nand I'm not gonna like be like oh [ __ ] I\nshould have said that well maybe maybe I\nstill will but in terms of like now like\nit's not like not like oh I forgot to\nsay this because\nI made sure I said everything that I\nwrote previously I I just saw something\nthat gave me a tiny glimmer of hope\nyou were reading over your notebook\nwhich I imagine is filled with some dark\nstuff\nand yet you had this like very lovely\nhalf smile\nand yeah and\nI got some sense like I couldn't quite\ntell 100 but I almost got some sense of\nlike peace in that smile\nyeah\nlike I'm glad that\nI kind of covered everything yeah so\nI I very much appreciate everything that\nyou covered\nI appreciate you for giving me the\nopportunity to talk about it\nwell I shall take that appreciation I\nshall up the ante\nand appreciate you even more\nfor\nyou know really\nat asking to have the conversation which\nis hard to do\nbecause I feel like\nit's really\nrespectable to talk about\nmy feelings in this environment where\nthat's what we're focused on right\nthere's no drama trying to farm whatever\nlike like this we're focused on feelings\nand\nhow it makes me feel and whatever\nwhereas when I try to talk about these\nthings on my stream\nit's kind of like\ninvalidated\nby people because like oh she's trying\nto get her numbers up or oh look at\nshe's doing this as I said lsf comments\nthey just generated my head sure but at\nthis point because it's so almost\npredictable but\num\nyeah so I'm glad I was able to have this\nopportunity\nyeah I me too I I think I learned a\nlittle bit more about\nthe experience that\npeople have I I think that\nyou know there's so many things that we\ndon't realize in terms of like what our\nreactions could be which is it's\nwhatever\nto what victim blaming looks like how\npeople feel what to expect because I\nthink that's the whole thing is like no\none knows what to expect so like people\ndon't even know that this is happening\nthey don't know what's that it's okay\nnot okay\nyou know\nand and so I think it's yeah and I feel\nlike\nI just remember this sorry to interrupt\nbut\nin terms of like\nlike understanding\nit I guess and the feelings the people I\nrealized like\nthey did not I would tell me a story or\nanything there's a lot of people I\nrealize\nwent through it but there's also people\nI realize\ncared for somebody who went through it\ntoo and they don't even have to tell me\nthat\nI just you just know understand\nespecially with the way this whole thing\nhappened\nand\nit really\num makes me like\nfeel appreciated and like cared about I\nguess when people\nwant\nlike when people listen to me I guess\nand understand\nI'm happy you've been able to find at\nleast a few of those people\nyeah sorry that was kind of also I feel\nlike that wasn't a well-structured\nsentence but\nyou know what I mean I do know what you\nmean\nI think that's because you're actually a\nvery good speaker\nthank you I hear it a lot but I I don't\nbelieve it I know\nI I believe it when I listen to myself\nbut when I'm in the moment speaking I'm\nlike wait a minute did I say that right\nyeah\nwell thank you very much Adriana any\nlast kind of thoughts or questions\nbefore we wrap up\num\nunless I just did a quick question are\nwe not drama farming here is that not\nwhat we're doing because that's what\nI've been trying to do this whole time\nis it oh\nyeah that's what a lot of people claim\nanything I do is me playing fortnite oh\nmy God you're drama farming fortnite\nplaying like bro\nI'm playing fortnite\nlike I just want to go to Tilted Towers\ncool but well take care and enjoy the\nrest of your day as as best as you can\nand thank you very much for speaking\nthank you for listening adios\nyou know just to kind of close this\ntoday out I think it's\nif you all take one thing away from the\ninterview\nI think a really important thing to take\naway is that\nthe experiences after a sexual assault\ncan be in a lot of ways like\neven more damaging than the actual\nassault itself and I think that's\nsomething that we really really lack an\nunderstanding of\noftentimes it's the Fallout\nafter the assault that causes at least\nin my opinion in in a handful of cases\nthat I've worked with like even more\nproblems\nright so it's one thing to be let's say\nsexually assaulted by a family member\nit's another thing entirely to like have\nyour family tell you to keep quiet about\nit\nand when I've worked with people in the\npast I almost think that that second\nthing is what's so much more damaging\nit's the sense of betrayal abandonment\nyou know friends kind of like not being\nthere like that's what hurts so much\nmore\nand I I think this is why we need to\nhave conversations about sexual assault\nbecause\nyou know like we talk about house we\ntalk about sexual assault being bad but\nwe don't talk about how it's bad\npeople don't realize what to expect what\nthey go through\nsometimes we don't even realize what\nconstitutes assault\nwe don't realize\nhow this act will have Ripple effects in\nour life\nand so then when we do have difficulties\nforming relationships breaking down at\nparticular points\nas a society we don't know how to be\nlike trauma sensitive or trauma-informed\nin terms of helping or supporting those\npeople so even in places like the\nworkplace\nand so then what ends up happening is\nlike we think about this individual\nevent\nand then sometimes their thoughts of oh\nit wasn't that bad\nit wasn't like you were XYZ you were\nonly ABC\nwhat are you complaining about\nand so there's all kinds of stuff about\nthe experience of going through this and\nhow it affects you how it affects your\nthoughts how people react to it there's\na very like real life component\nthat exists outside the ACT\nand this is the thing that is the most\nmisunderstood\nabout sexual trauma\neveryone's focused on the the Trump the\ntraumatic event traumatic event\ntraumatic event itself\nand if it happened five years ago like\nwhy are you complaining now\nright but that's the whole point is that\nit lingers and manifests in ways that we\ndon't originally realize\nand that's what we need to have a\ngreater awareness and understanding of\nbecause what I tend to see is that you\nknow Adriana did a great job of sort of\nsharing with her like the guilt and\nshame and then she kind of like\novercomes that right\nand then like people are like\nvictim blaming and so there comes the\nguilt and shame all over again\noh like you could ruin someone's career\nlike do you want that to happen\ndo you want to ruin this person's career\nand and so when when people make\nstatements like that like it brings back\nall the guilt right no I don't want to\nruin anyone's career like that's a bad\nthing\nand I want to be a good person\nand so I think that there's just a lot\nof\nyou know misunderstanding misunderstood\nI'm not even misunderstanding I think\nthere's just a lack of understanding\nthat we you know we hyper focus on\nparticular things\nand don't really like acknowledge what\nthe full spectrum of the impact is\nand so I really appreciate Adriana you\nknow\ncoming forward and sharing this\nperspective I I hope for those of you\nall that watched it first of all thank\nyou very much to everyone who is\nrespectful and compassionate\nyou know a couple of other things to\njust toss out there so I noticed she\ndidn't name any names and we're not\nreally interested in encouraging her to\ndo that that's not what we're here for\nwe're not here to be judge jury or\nexecutioner it's not our job to judge\nand say that someone did something right\nor someone did something wrong we are\nnot here to determine guilt or innocence\nthat's not\nwhat our job is\nand we're not accusing or attacking or\ntrying to create drama or whatever like\nthat's really not why we're here\nI imagine that if you're caught up in\nthis stuff and you're aware that this is\ngoing on and you're watching this that\nyou may feel bad about it or feel\nattacked or whatever which is like I\nthink it's a completely understandable\nreaction\nright\nand also it's like that's not why we're\nhere\nwe're not here to try to make anyone\nlook bad\nwhat we're trying to hear to try to do\nis support and educate people who are\ngoing through this\nand it's like\nit's not our job to pass a judgment or\nto call you a good person or a bad\nperson\nthat that's not really what we're here\nfor\nbut I think that in what I kind of heard\nfrom Adriana and I don't I don't really\nknow right so there's like different\nperspectives on this as well\nso\nand we're not we're not interested in\ndetermining truth\ntoday that's not we're never determiners\nof Truth\nright we're here to help people\nunderstand themselves\nand help people understand a little bit\nabout how to navigate this absolute mess\nof a thing that we call life\nthat's our goal\nand there are all kinds of like\nother things involving sexual assault\nthat we did not even touch on today\nwhich are absolutely what worth\nexploring\nright so this is a case of\na woman who was sexually assaulted and\nis part of a prominent content creator\nor community\nwhat about people who are not part of\nprominent content creator communities\nwhat is the Fallout aftermath or drama\nlook like for people who are not\ninvolved in content creation\nthat's a completely different ball game\nwhat does sexual assault look like in\nthe workplace\ncompletely different ball game\nwhat does sexual assault look like if\nyou're a man\ncompletely different ballgame\nwhat does it look like when you were\nfalsely accused of sexual assault\ncompletely different ballgame\nand so there's a lot about these\nconversations that that we I mean\nthere's a lot about this topic that we\nstill need to explore\nthat people still need to understand\nand\nyou know I think this is hopefully the\nfirst conversation but I I don't know\nlike this is like what I think is\nmissing on the Internet is\nlike people just don't like there's\nthere's not a human representation of it\nbecause what I see time and time and\ntime again I I want to say that honestly\nupwards of 90 if not 95 or damn near\nclose to 100 percent\nof people I've worked with who have had\nwho've been sexually assault not even\nworked with just people that I've met if\nI have a conversation with them almost\nevery single one or every one that I can\nthink of In This Moment\ndid not realize what was happening at\nsome point during the process\nthey did not even realize that this is\nthis constitutes sexual assault\nand and a couple of the reactions that\nAdriana shared I think are very common\nwhich is that since we sort of view it\nas this bad thing everyone assumes that\nthe reaction I should have is bad\nbut sometimes people will like I I mean\nI've heard this a dozen times at least\nwhere people will say like I'm confused\nwhy my body is reacting this way I love\nthis person or this person cares about\nme and this person loves me so far too\ncommon experience\nso it's almost like what our society is\nmissing is like an understanding of what\nit looks like\nand what it feels like to go through a\nsituation like this\nand that's really what we're trying to\naddress today\nI hope it helps I I mean I I really\nthink\nit does and I I do think honestly that\nthere were a lot of good clippable\nmoments but not clippable in the sense\nof like oh lulls\nforeign\nshe used the s word and the W word but I\nI wanted to use the language that she\nuses but I can't say those things\nso even I'm playing that game\nbut I I do really think that there's\njust a lot of\nyou know like distilled experience in in\nwhat Adriana shared today\nand I I hope it's educational for y'all\nat the least and ideally it'll be\nhelpful\nso thank you all very much for being\nrespectful being compassionate\ngiving us even showing up\nbecause the fact that y'all are here\nmeans that\nlet's see\nyou know there's like\n2500 people who hopefully know a little\nbit more about\nwhat apparently is a far too common\nexperience\nso thank you all for coming"
