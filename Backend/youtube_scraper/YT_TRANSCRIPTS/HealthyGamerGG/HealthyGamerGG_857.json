    "transcript": "my patience my dedication my\nintelligence the research that I do my\nemotional temperament will result in the\nchild being healthy or unhealthy\nsuccessful or unsuccessful\nI hate my ADHD son\nI know\nI'm sorry I know as his mother I'm\nsupposed to love him no matter what but\nI cannot stand the little bread no\nmatter how hard I try\nhe is the literal definition of a\ntroublemaker he brings nothing good to\nour family my son is eight years old he\nis diagnosed with ADHD and ODD\nterrible combination to deal with\nhe does not listen or do what he's told\nhe has broken boundaries over several\noccasions he never follows the rules\nit's taken emotional physical and\nfinancial toll on his father and I and\nthe rest of the family we can no longer\nvisit family for the holidays because he\nis out of control I can't even take him\nto a damn Walmart for errands because\nhe's wandering around touching whatever\nhe can find\nhe has caused us thousands of dollars in\nDamages from throwing rocks or eggs at\nother people's cars especially when our\napartment is directly next to the\nfreeway\nhe has caused at least two car accidents\non the interstate\nI cannot spend a week without having the\ncops called on him for random things\nincluding smacking a neighbor's truck to\nset off the car alarm he doesn't\nunderstand when you tell him no actually\nhe will not take no for an answer he\nwill get violent and destructive when\nhe's mad he loves to kick scream bite\nand make a scene when things don't go\nhis way\nhe broke every expensive thing I had\nincluding the Samsung TV we bought last\nweek I can't take him to a Walmart\nwithout him acting up every time we go\nhe always wants a random thing off the\nshelf he will touch things he will open\nup toys and I have to pay for them each\ntime look away for a second and he's\ngone I had to invest in a leash to keep\nhim at my side when I tell him he can't\nhave a toy candy whatever he will scream\nlike a banshee and break things and\nthrow things this is after I told him\nnot to touch anything in the store and\nnot to ask for anything\nI tried everything punishments timeouts\ntaking away toys and video games\nspankings they don't work I've tried\nparenting tips online none of them work\nmedications did work until I complained\nto the doctor that he was acting like a\nzombie I regret not opening my mouth\nabout it it sounds like she regrets\nopening her mouth about it trying to\nfind medications that work fighting with\ninsurance to cover his doctor visits and\nmedications every month I can't it's too\nmuch for me school started three weeks\nago and he was suspended from school\ntwice for violent Behavior I just want\nto lock myself away and throw away the\nkey this kid is too much I'm asking the\nworld of him I'm not asking the world of\nhim I just want him to behave and sit\nquietly like a good kid and not cause us\nor any anything else trouble\nso\nas a parent\nwe're supposed to love our kids\nand sometimes they do things like\nthey'll do thousands of dollars worth of\ndamage we can't take them to run errands\nthey get suspended we get the call or\nthe cops called and even as a parent we\nhave to cope by putting the child on a\nleash\nand then if you're a parent and you walk\naround outside of the house with an\neight-year-old child on a leash imagine\nthe looks that you get oh my God how\nterrible is this parent\nand so his parents were just taught that\nlike hey unconditional love for a child\nright\nyou're supposed to love your child like\nyou're not allowed to hate them\nand so since we're not allowed to hate\nthem and children are perfect and\nthey're innocent right and they're eight\nyears old\ncan this child really know what he's\neven doing and then what we do is we\ndiagnose them with something we give\nthem an illness\nand so then what happens if you're a\nparent is like once your child has this\nADHD illness it's even harder to hate\nthem\nright because like oh the child is sick\ntheir brains are different like it's not\ntheir fault this is just the way that\nthey're wired\nand so it's really hard having a child\nwith ADHD so a couple of interesting\nfacts and figures for you\nthe first thing to understand is that we\nassume\nthat our parenting affects our child\nright that it's a one-way relationship\nthat like if my child grows up to be a\nproductive human being that is because I\ndid a good job as a parent\nand if my child grows up to be like a\nlittle\nPOS who's bothering people and goes to\njail then it's my fault as a parent\nwe think about parenting is a one\ndirectional relationship\nmy patience my dedication my\nintelligence the research that I do my\nemotional temperament will result in the\nchild being healthy or unhealthy\nsuccessful or unsuccessful\nthe first thing to understand if you are\nparenting a child with ADHD is that it's\nbi-directional\nthere's overwhelming evidence that\nchildren with ADHD induce changes in\nparenting Style\nthere's strong evidence that having a\nchild with ADHD increases the risk of\ndepression in parents increases the\nstress level of parents\nright so the child will affect you as\nwell and what do I mean by bidirectional\nso I'll give you all a simple example\nparents of children with ADHD yell at\ntheir kids more than parents of kids\nwithout ADHD and what happens is when\nyou go out to like let's say a grocery\nstore and you see some parent\nlosing their [ __ ] with a kid yelling at\ntheir eight-year-old child\nyou're like oh my God what a terrible\nparent\nso here's what happens so I'll explain\nit to you okay\nso when I have ADHD I'm highly\ndistractible and I can be very\npreservative so if I start to do\nsomething\nthis is what happens in our brain when\nwe're focused on something there is some\npart of our brain that is paying\nattention to other stimuli right so like\nif I'm sitting there let's say playing a\nvideo game\nand there's a fire in the Next Room\nand smoke starts coming into the room\nand I smell it there's a circuit in my\nbrain that takes a very very faint smell\nof smoke very faint it's not like the\nfire's in my room\ntakes that signal and then shatters my\nattention and says hey stop playing the\nvideo game pay attention to this some\nsmell of smoke here\nso if we kind of look at it my mind is\nfocused on a\nhow strong does the stimulus have to be\nto break that attention\nso in a neurotypical person that\nstimulus is small so if you're like\nsitting at home and like someone is\nyelling outside like oh you can't focus\nbecause you can't drown out that noise\nright\nso here's the thing if you have a if you\nhave a child with ADHD you need a very\nvery strong stimulus to get their\nattention\nso if you say hey it's time for school\nthe child will not even process that\ninformation\nhey it's time for school\nno processing hey it's time for school\nyou say the third time now you get\nfrustrated as a parent\nand you say hey it's time for school and\nthen the kid snaps out of it and looks\nat you now mind you this is like a\nfour-year-old kid or even three-year-old\nkid right or even two-year-old kid where\nyou're like hey don't pick up the knife\nand you have to yell at them to get\ntheir attention so what parents will\nlearn because of this this kind of\nattentional block in the hyper Focus\nthat children have\nparents learn to raise their voice\nthis is actually the effective method of\ncommunication for kids with ADHD\nbut when you yell it activates certain\nparts of your sympathetic nervous system\nyou kind of get emotional you get angry\nit's hard to yell at people and like not\nhave some kind of negative emotion\nfurthermore the kid gets yelled at right\nso like they don't hear anything except\nfor yelling but it's still startling\nfor a kid to get yelled at and then\nthey're getting yelled at all the time\nbecause that's the effective way of\ncommunicating that's what parents with\nkids with ADHD learn is yelling is the\nonly thing that works\nnow this isn't the kid's fault and it's\nalso not the parent's fault this is what\nwe've learned when you look at parenting\nwith ADHD is that ADHD induces changes\nin parenting\nnow this situation is even worse because\nnow we have oppositional defined\ndisorder at Play\nand Oppositional Defiant Disorder is\nbasically anytime you tell me to do\nsomething\nit's not really about me getting\nsomething it's not about what I want the\nDefiance is I just don't want to do what\nyou want I don't even care about the\nLegos but if you tell me to put them\naway I'm not going to\nso when you get Oppositional Defiant\nDisorder coupled with ADHD it's a real\nmess\nsometimes this can also cross into\nconduct disorder which is what we call\nanti-social personality disorder in\nadults which is like sociopathy for\nexample\nso it can like it can be a really bad\nmess because what you have is\noppositional Defiance which sometimes\nhas difficulty with emotional regulation\nand then we also know that the brains of\npeople with ADHD they're more sensitive\nto negative emotions so they're they\nalso can sometimes experience emotional\ndysregulation\nso when you have this kind of situation\nit's very hard to deal with so as a\nparent like the first thing that I want\nto say is like it's okay it's okay for\nyou to have feelings of hatred towards\nyour child just because you hate your\nchild does not mean that you also don't\nlove your child that the situation that\ny'all are in is very very very difficult\nand this is the other thing that I think\nis really important to understand\njust because someone is ill doesn't mean\nthat they're not doesn't absolve them of\nall responsibility and I've learned this\nlesson the hard way as a psychiatrist\nthat we want to have compassion for\nexample for people with like bipolar\ndisorder and add like we want to have\ncompassion for them we should have\ncompassion for them and I encourage you\nto have compassion for them\nit's important to remember though that\npeople with let's say bipolar disorder\nand I think about bipolar disorder\nbecause that's really like a couple of\npatients that I really learned this\nlesson with\nthey're also somewhat responsible right\nso I don't really buy that you're\neight-year-old sometimes they're\nemotionally dysregulated sometimes\nthey're distracted sometimes they're\nimpulsive but sometimes they actually\nknow exactly what they're doing\nsometimes they know full well what's\ngoing on and they choose to do it anyway\nand I think it's really important to\nassign some responsibility to the child\nbecause until you assign some\nresponsibility to the child you can't\never expect them to like help you fix\nthis and that's the key thing if you're\nreally struggling with a child with ADHD\nyou need the child's help you can't\nparent\nyour way to success without the child's\nhelp and what we tend to see in\nsituations like this is there's a very\nantagonistic relationship between you\nand the child and if you hate your child\nhow do you think your child hates I mean\nfeels about you they hate you too right\nthis is a mutual thing that both of\ny'all are carrying there's there's\nconflict and there's a war between\nparent and child\nand hatred is it an unfortunate emotion\nto have in a parent-child relationship\nabsolutely but it is also a completely\nacceptable emotion and something that\ncan be dealt with right it's reasonable\nto sometimes hate our kids because\nsometimes they're little brats right\nthey do that sometimes\nnow I'm not saying that you should let\nthe hatred run wild I'm not saying that\nyou shouldn't have compassion I'm not\nsaying that you shouldn't try to change\nthings\nbut I think you're allowed to feel some\nhatred and just because you feel hatred\ndoesn't necessarily mean you also don't\nfeel loved\nso now the the hardest question is what\nto do about it because this parent sort\nof says I've tried everything and\nnothing works\nand so the biggest thing that I would\nsort of suggest in a situation like this\nand I gotta first start by saying no\nsuggestions from the internet will do\nany justice to your problem\nbut what I found in the most difficult\ncases of people with ADD antisocial\npersonality disorder Oppositional\nDefiant Disorder okay so I'm talking\nabout adults as well or even things like\nbipolar disorder is that you can't win\nwithout the person's help\nand so what I tend to see especially in\nkids with ADHD by the time they're eight\nor nine is that they're so incapable of\nresponsibility at four or five or six\nthat as a parent we don't give them any\nresponsibility because they can't handle\nit and then what happens is that they\nget to this point where they're eight\nyears old and they can actually handle a\nlittle bit of responsibility\nbut since we never gave it to them when\nthey're four like developmentally like\nbrains their brains can handle it but\nthey haven't learned how to do that so I\nknow it sounds kind of weird but\nwhat I found to be really really\neffective\nis to really like ask the kid hey why\nare you doing this\nwhat do you think is going on here when\nwe go to Walmart are you allowed to open\nthe toys can you open the toys can you\nnot open the toys what happens are you\nsupposed to open the toys why aren't you\nsupposed to open the toys\nI know it sounds kind of bizarre and I'm\nnot saying that this is going to work in\nthis situation\nbut if you're a kid if you're a parent\nwith a kid with ADHD what we what I\noftentimes see parents doing and I've\nhad a lot of success with this is they\ntry to control the child right the kid\ndoesn't listen doesn't listen doesn't\nlisten\nwhat I don't hear is that does the kid\nunderstand or do they not understand\nwell they don't listen\nwhen I tell them to do something they\ndon't listen\nwell do they understand\nwell yeah I've explained that to him a\nthousand times\nhold on a second\ndo they understand\nand I want you to think about this if\nyou're if you have ADHD\nthink about all the times when you were\ngrowing up and your parents told you to\ndo something\nhow often did you really understand what\nthey were trying to get you accomplished\nand why they were telling you to do it\nthat way\nbecause what we tend to see is ADHD\ninduces an authoritarian parenting style\nso it induces a parenting style that's\nmy way or the highway\nand so the more authoritarian you become\nas a parent the more you yell the more\nit's like no more opening toys at\nWalmart end of story\nexplanation and understanding go\ncompletely out the window right you'll\ntry to explain things that's where I use\na different technique which is ask your\nkids questions\nwhy are we going to Walmart\nwhat are we supposed to do there\nwhat do you why what do you like about\nWalmart what do you dislike about\nWalmart how do you feel when you don't\nget a toy that you want\nis it possible to go to Walmart and you\nnot to open a toy do you think you could\nhandle that right we're not telling them\nto do it or not do it what do you think\nyou're capable of because here's what\nI've also seen with kids who are\nOppositional Defiant is if you can ever\nget them on your side that stubbornness\nwill start working for you\nit's not easy to do don't get me wrong\nso it's not like one conversation has\nthis but in the situations where I've\nworked with families\nso usually this is like families with\nvideo game addiction\nand some co-morbid attention deficit\ndisorder or Oppositional Defiant\nDisorder so usually they come to me\nbecause there's a problematic behavior\nin the household where the kid is\nthrowing a temper tantrum because of\ngames or like it's bedtime and they like\nstart\nflipping chairs right I've seen a lot of\nbroken objects things like that there's\nall kinds of stuff that gets messed up\nso this isn't we don't really see this\nin in this kind of situation but I've\nseen it a lot and what I tend to find is\nthat once again the most important thing\nthat most people Miss is building an\nalliance with the child and trying to\nreally figure out what is the child\nunderstand\nnow if you're saying I've explained that\nto them a thousand times that's not how\nyou recognize understanding you ask\nquestions\nso I'd start by asking your kid lots and\nlots and lots of questions and the more\nthat you ask them questions the more you\nsee what they understand\nyou're also modeling a different kind of\nbehavior there because think about this\nfor a second if I have a kid who goes\ninto Walmart and starts opening up toys\nwhat do I do hey you can't do that stop\nstop stop not allowed punishments\nwhat are you modeling for the child\nyou're actually modeling my way or the\nhighway\nthink about it right because there's no\nabsolutely no way that you can open up a\ntoy at Walmart without paying for it\nI don't care what your opinion is\nno means no no means no and so what is\nthe child learning\nchild is learning no means no\nso when mom tells me\nto put the toy away mom no means no I'm\nnot gonna put the toy away no means no\nbecause that's what you've taught me so\nI'm learning it\nand that couples with the oppositional\ndefiance\nenhances it now is not only the child\nodd plus ADHD now the child is modeling\nmy way of the highway\nand sorry the parents is modeling my way\nof the highway is exactly what the child\nlearns so this I know it's kind of like\nweird it's easy for me to say this like\nI'm some dude on the internet right like\nI don't have I don't have to parent\nyou're a kid\neasy for me to say you gotta talk to the\nkid you got to understand the kid\nand if you know anyone\nwho's like an adult who has ADHD talk to\nthem too what was it like growing up\nwith ADHD how did your parents respond\nto you what how did it make you feel\nwere you rebellious tell me about that\nand what you'll discover is that like\nall that stuff is tied together\nlast thing to kind of mention is that\nthis is a situation where unfortunately\nI think too much of psychiatric care\naround this stuff is medication focused\nand not enough of it is about\ncommunication and Boundary setting like\nteaching parents these parenting skills\nso the first thing that I'd say is that\nif you're in a situation like this you\nyourself need therapy to deal with those\nnegative emotions process that kind of\nstuff process the guilt recognize that\nlike you're not a bad parent just\nbecause you hate your kid\nright like the little brats sometimes\nand that's okay you can love your kid\nand hate your kids you've got to kind of\nlike work through that stuff on your own\nsecond thing is strongly strongly\nstrongly recommend some kind of therapy\nwith someone who really understands ADHD\nand ODD defined kids\nmedication ain't gonna cut it and I\ntotally understand that sometimes what\nwe'll try to do is we'll like medicate\nthem to compliance which I don't think\nis a good strategy\nthe good news the last thing that I'll\nsort of say is it may sound really\nsimple but don't give up hope because I\nknow you've tried everything but like I\ndon't know if this makes sense but the\nway that you've tried everything is with\nyour stressed out brain\nand that's where like once you've tried\neverything and like you're so stressed\nout you can't be patient and then like\nthings don't work so then what I'd sort\nof recommend is once you kind of take\ncare of yourself you like revisit things\nand you may be surprised because each\nmonth that goes by your child's brain\ndevelops a little bit more\neach month that goes by you may learn\nsomething so you could there may be\ncapable of things a year from now that\nthey weren't capable of two years from\nnow\nso it's an ongoing process and don't\ngive up it's okay to dislike your kid\nbecause sometimes they're little brats\nand like good luck because it ain't easy\nquestions\nyeah so I see that consia is responding\nto a question\nthank you very much for doing that\nconzit\nuh We've we've interviewed parents on\nStream So I encourage you all to go\nwatch that if y'all\none\nad car is saying are some kids truly\nhopeless I don't believe so\nI'm not saying they aren't\nbut I don't believe so\nI've just seen too many\nhopeless kids hopeless patients hopeless\npeople get better\nI'm not saying that there has to be\nsomeone out there who's hopeless\nlike I've certainly had some patients in\nmy practice that I haven't been able to\nhelp substantially\nbut I don't know if that's like a\ndeficiency of me as a provider or like\nthe case is hopeless does that make\nsense\nso I think as a as a provider like as a\ndoctor like\nI got to be super careful to say like a\npatient is hopeless\nbecause that's like one of the most\narrogant things that I can say because\nit implies that\nI'm doing everything right\ndoes that make sense\nso I'm not saying there aren't people\nthat I can't help like I think there are\npeople out there that are hard to help\nand\nbut was it a shortcoming of me are they\nso sick it's hopeless I mean there's\nsome illnesses out there that are\nterminal so if you want to call that\nhopeless definitely you can say that but\nin Psychiatry I mean I've seen too many\nsuccess stories that have made me\nit's just I just don't think it's like\nlogical to be as hopeless\nand when people feel hopeless I think\nit's completely logical for them because\nthey haven't seen it yet\nright\nso so gaming comments say what about\nwhen parent has undiagnosed or untreated\nADHD well like so that's the the cool\nthing right so if you look at a\nsituation that you call hopeless\nand the parent has undiagnosed ADHD\nwell like that's a pretty easy fix like\nget the parent treatment and then like\nthings can turn around real quick that's\nexactly what I'm talking about so I'll\nhave like a hopeless kid\nand then what we realize is like oh like\nmaybe the parent has undiagnosed anxiety\nso I've seen even kids that were really\nreally struggling turned out like one of\ntheir parents had really bad undiagnosed\nOCD\nwhich can be crippling\nand like a year after the parent got\ninto treatment kid was doing way better\nokay\ndo you think it's bad for my\nfour-year-old and to never take a nap\nduring the day no I think kids are\ndifferent\nthe important thing is that they get\nsufficient sleep some kids sleep longer\novernight some kids take naps"
