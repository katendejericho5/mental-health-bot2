    "transcript": "or did they take care of everything or\ndid you not even get invited or did you\nnot even go or did you go with a gift\nbut no card or did you go with a card or\nno gift\nokay\nthe 25 year old loner\nalways wonders how their life could have\nturned out differently\nmost people they like seem to just\ndisappear eventually people people often\nask why they are so quiet has friends\nbut doesn't feel fully a part of the\ngroup constant mental health and\nself-esteem issues no best friends since\nprimary school never had a girlfriend\nhas finally given up their optimism in\nthis example it's a man but we've seen\nthis in women as well and homosexuals\nand bisexuals and stuff like that right\nso you can be a woman and never had a\nboyfriend\ncan always sense most people don't\nreally want to be talking to them when\nthey are\nalways feels out of place hobby skill\nworked they worked hard at but just not\ngood enough to be a professional doesn't\nreally care where their life is going\nanymore always feels out of place seems\nnormal to other people but always feels\nalone inside and secret lifelong\npornography addiction\nthe 25 year old loner\nso when we look at this unfortunately\nwhat we're seeing is that an increasing\namount of our society identifies with\nthis\nwe have 25 year old loners\nat a scale and Pace that we've never had\nbefore\nso we see this they're even like\nculturally specific\nterms for this and even very extreme\nversions right so like in China there's\na movement called laying flat which is\nnot exactly the same as this in a lot of\nLatin America or Spain they're called\nnini's Sonia studiar we call them neats\nalso not employment education or\ntraining\nand Japan they're probably the first\nones that coined the term hikokomori\nshut-ins\nright so we know that there's something\ngoing on I recently read a paper from\nthe field of economics about how\num young people entering the workforce\nespecially men is at a historic all-time\nlow\nand so even in Psychiatry we call this\nFailure to Launch\nso that's like a term that we'll kind of\nuse so here's the pattern of someone who\nfails to Launch\nso what will happen is you'll have\nsomeone who grows up and does pretty\ngood like in primary school middle\nschool they don't fail out they have\nsome friends they get invited to\nbirthday parties they pass their classes\nyou know they kind of do okay\nbut then what happens is the later they\ngo in life the more the Gap increases\nbetween them and other people but\nthere's not like a traumatic event right\nbecause in society like we're okay with\nthat we sort of are okay if like oh if\nyou if you struggle in life and\nsomething bad happened to you then it's\nnot your fault\nbut what happens is there's an\nincreasingly large of p a proportion of\npeople who don't have anything to blame\nreally except for themselves right it's\nnot like I was horribly abused it's not\nlike I had this some terrible accident\njust every year that goes by I just kind\nof slip a little bit further and further\nbehind\nand you kind of fail to launch you start\nout on the runway you start getting some\nmomentum you're you're kind of speeding\nup you're you know front landing gear\nstarts to lift and then for some reason\nyour plane just never takes off you had\nall the momentum just like everyone else\nif you look at yourself when you were 16\nyou had so many possibilities but you\njust don't get the plane off the ground\nmaybe you even finished College\nand so what starts to happen is all of\nthose things that you would kind of had\nas you were a child over time they start\nto Slough off\nyou had a best friend they went to\ncollege you went to a different College\nyou'll started to drift apart they made\nnew friends for some reason you didn't\nand so as they made new friends and\nstarted to live their lives and started\nto date they had less and less time for\nyou\nand you somehow weren't able to do that\nand so they move off in One Direction\nand they kind of leave you behind\nbut when people look at you there's\nnothing like grossly disfiguring right\nit's not like you smell bad it's not\nlike you have bad hygiene it's not like\nyou know like you seem okay on the\noutside but internally you're lonely\nyou're isolated and every year that goes\nby it gets a little bit worse\nso you had all the momentum you just\ndidn't launch\nand so what we tend to think about\nourselves in this situation\nand what we tend to what other people\nwill eventually start to think of us and\neven what we start to suspect or see is\nthat other people start to think of us\nthis way is this term loser\nThe Loner gets replaced by a loser I'm a\nloser right we've had that term for a\nlong time\nand when someone kind of crosses into a\nloser then it is their fault\nright because this guy's a loser like\nthey just don't do anything for\nthemselves\nand so if we want to get out of this\nsituation we're going to do what we\nnormally do here first of all understand\nwhat on Earth is going on this is a\nsystemic issue right so I don't think\nit's fair to blame just the individual\nif there was if it was just you there\nwould be no term like a neat a nihi Nini\nuh hikokomori\nwe like literally have all over the\nworld culturally specific terms people\nare recognizing this phenomenon and\nassigning words in their own language to\ndescribe this\nso it's not just you it's a stomach\nissue so first of all we have to\nunderstand what the systemic issue is\nwhy is that it's because if we want to\nfix it here's the Crux of the problem if\nyou're a 25 year old loner you think\nit's your fault so you accept\nresponsibility not only for your own\nactions but everything on the systemic\nside too because you don't think that\nit's systemic right because like it's\nclearly you because other people are out\nthere and they're doing fine so it can't\nbe a systemic issue then you start\naccepting responsibility for things that\nyou have no control over\nyou have some control over your personal\nactions but you don't control what\nSociety does\nbut you don't we don't even acknowledge\nthat Society is influencing this so then\nyou end up taking control of\nresponsibility for all of it but you\ncan't actually control it\nso once I start taking responsibility\nfor things that are out of my control\nall I can do is lose\nand so that feeds the cycle so we first\nof all have to assign understand what's\ngoing on from a societal perspective\nonce we understand what's going on from\na societal perspective then we'll\nunderstand what we're actually\nresponsible for once we understand what\nwe're responsible for then we can devote\nall of our energy to it we'll talk a\nlittle bit about why that can be\nchallenging or hard and then ultimately\nwe'll see a path forward\nif I specialize in one thing it's\nhelping 25 year old loners\nso let's talk a little bit about that so\nthe first thing that I kind of noticed\nis I was training to become a\npsychiatrist is I would gravitate\nsometimes towards these people or these\npeople would gravitate towards me maybe\nit's because I too was a 25 year old\nloser when I was 25 years old I had\ngraduated from college after five years\nwith like a 2.4 GPA\nright I rounded up to 2.5 because it was\n2.47 or something like that\ndidn't really have any money\nwas applying to medical school for the\nsecond time right so I just failed to\nget in for one year and was applying my\nsecond year failed to get in that year\nas well and so like what who am I at\nthat point I've got nothing going for me\nand so as I started working with these\npeople in my office I started to notice\na couple of things the first is when\nthey came in I thought even in my head I\nthought wow this guy's like a real loser\nlike me we're both losers\nbut as I learned more about Psychiatry I\nstarted to realize oh my God this person\nis actually not a loser what's actually\nis I talk to them about their experience\nof life I started to notice all kinds of\nsubtle differences that we take for\ngranted\nso I'll give you all a simple example\nand this these are the kinds of\nquestions that you should ask yourself\nbecause the 25 year old loner\nsheds relationships right like over time\nit's not like they drive people away\nthey don't rupture things they don't\ncause problems they're not drama Kings\nor Queens just over time people start to\nSlough off\nand why is that what's going on and what\nI started to realize is there are all\nkinds of things which these people were\nnever taught\nso for example I want you all to think\nabout this okay\nwhen you were growing up when you were\nseven years old\nhow did you learn the rules of making\nfriends did your parents make sure you\ngot invited to birthday parties when you\nhad a birthday party did your parents\ninvite kids over\nwhen you went to a birthday party did\nyour parents pick out a gift for the\nperson that you were uh did they do all\nthe work did they pick out the gift and\nthey wrote the card and just handed it\nto the other parent or were you involved\nin that process were you taught okay\nlet's go get a gift for someone when we\nget a gift for someone let's write a\ncard I'm gonna hand you the present and\nthe card and you're gonna go in and I\nrealize you're gonna feel a little bit\nawkward you're going to go to your\nfriend and you're going to hand hand it\nto them\nor did they take care of everything or\ndid you not even get invited or did you\nnot even go or did you go with a gift\nbut no card or did you go with a card or\nno gift\nanother wild thing when you had a\nbirthday party and other kids showed up\ndid you give them return gifts did you\ngo up to each and every one of your\nguests at the party give them a little\ngoodie bag and say thank you for coming\ndid your parents make you do that\nbecause this is how you form\nrelationships this is how you maintain\nrelationships\nthere are all kinds of things did your\nparents enroll you in particular things\nwhen you had conflict I remember when I\nwas in the fifth grade I got into a\nfight\nwith a kid in my school\nbecause we were all part of a friend\nCircle\nand\nthere were four of us\nand we started getting into conflict\nbecause I wanted to hang out with two\npeople I didn't want to hang out with\nthis fourth kid the fourth kid wanted to\nhang out with the two people didn't want\nto hang out with me\nI got a phone call from his mom to my\nhouse\nand she talked to me a little bit about\nhow it's not good to fight over friends\nand like is it kind of cringe absolutely\nwas the kid embarrassed I imagined so\ndid I kind of get reprimanded by some\nother kids parents sure were my parents\neven aware of what was going on\nabsolutely not\nbut the next day at school there was\ncivility between the two of us\nand we ended up doing fine for the rest\nof the year\na parent actually interceded on behalf\nof their child\nhow did the parent even know that\nit's because they must have talked to\ntheir kid\nthey must have said hey what's going on\nwith you today I'm having trouble making\nfriends and the parent is like oh let me\ndo what a parent is supposed to do if my\nchild is having trouble learning how to\nwalk I will teach them to walk if\nthey're having trouble making friends\nlet me teach them how to make friends\nbut what a lot of parents do and we'll\nget to why this isn't really their fault\nin a second\nis they don't teach their kids right\nthey just sort of send their kids off\nand assume that the child will learn\nbecause this is not like it's not like\nparenting 101 right like not all parents\ndo this\nand the thing is that used to work\nwhat's changed one thing the internet\nthe internet has changed\nso it used to be\nthat we did not have social Alternatives\nor socially fracturing forces\nlike we have today\nso there's an increase in globalization\nand you can work remotely and people\nwill move from one place to another a\nhundred years ago I remember talking to\nmy grandmother about like when she grew\nup in her Village what was it like for\nher\nand it's hard to describe this but like\nI can't really do it justice but she was\nexplaining to me that the world was a\nfictional concept\nthe idea of other nations were like\ntheoretical no one in her Village of 200\npeople not a single person or a village\nof 200 people or the generation above or\nthe generation above or the generation\nabove had ever visited another country\nfor the 300 years\nin that Village and every person and not\na single person had visited another\ncountry\nI remember when I went to that Village\none of my like distant cousins\nwas like came up to me and was like\ndid you come here in an airplane and I\nwas like yeah man\nof course I was like nine\nand he's like but how did you get here\nin an airplane I was like I don't know\ndude like I sat in the seat and he\nlooked at me and was like\nhow do you not fall out\nI was like what the and then it clicked\nthe only mode of transportation this kid\nhas ever seen is a cart that is attached\nto an ox\nhow do you go so fast and not fall out\nso the social\nsystem that our parents learned involved\ntight-knit communities that's what human\nbeings have evolved into\nso that what we teach our kids we just\nlike kind of show up like in that\nVillage you don't need to explicitly\nteach kids social skills because they\nshow up they go to school they see the\nsame 30 kids they're gonna half those\nkids are gonna get married\nthey're gonna have families they're\ngoing to see each other every day in the\nTown Square\nthere's no fracturing and so what's\nhappened is as the internet has grown\npeople have been more fractured and so\nwhat's happening is there's a need for\nparents to intervene in a way that they\nnever have before because like Society\njust didn't work like that\nand the end result is we have a bunch of\npeople who aren't taught how to maintain\nsocial relationships\nthe reason the parents don't really\nteach it is because they really weren't\ntaught it and but the thing is for them\nthey didn't really need to learn because\nSociety was structured in such a way\nwhere you sort of had persistent\ncontacts right you went to work every\nday and you saw the same people and then\nyou went to barbecues and all this kind\nof good stuff but now we're working from\nhome now we're Freelancers now we're\nthis now we're that now people are\nmoving away to different like moving is\nlike not that wild\nright it's not like people like oh my\nGod\nif you moved how did you take your house\nI didn't take my house I rented a place\nover there it's like oh my God that's so\nweird\nso Society is changing\nand so once you start to realize this\nwhat I realized as a psychiatrist is\nthat when I work with these people and\nthey don't maintain relationships it's\nnot because they're losers it's because\nthey were literally never taught\nand I sort of almost like realized I was\nlike oh this is this person's Karma so\nwhen I was trying to make sense of this\nright there's a scientific angle but\nwhen it comes down to it I can't fix\ntheir parenting and I can't fix their\nsocietal what Society does or doesn't do\nI can't fix or change\nthe fact that we're entering the digital\nage so how do I help this person\nand what I did is I conceptualized it as\ntheir karma and this is really important\nfor a mindset shift right\nso I want you all to understand this if\nyou think you're a 25 year old loner I\nwant you to think about all the\nConfluence of events that have made you\nwho you are today\ndo you get to choose where you're born\ndo you get to choose when you're born do\nyou get to choose who your parents are\nbecause if we're saying that excellent\nparenting is a differentiating factor\nhere and we're not saying that that the\nparents are bad it's just they just\ndon't know that they need to teach this\nif you were born a hundred years ago\nwould you have this problem\nright\nthere are all kinds of things that you\ndon't control about your circumstances\nthis is your karma\nnow karma sometimes comes with all these\nweird like\nassociations like oh you deserve this\nand reincarnation but forget about that\nwhat we know is that even scientifically\nthere's a Confluence of events and this\nis what we learn as psychiatrists is\nthere's a Confluence of events that\nmakes a human being\nthey're parenting their attachment style\nwhether traumatic experiences happen\nlike literally whether like when you\nwent to a birthday party what were you\ntaught\nwhat is the right way to maintain\nrelationships\nhow many times a year did you call your\ncousins who live on the opposite side of\nthe country\njust to talk\nbecause I know that like my parents made\nme call random people in India who I had\nnever met and say hi to them\nbut what they did in that moment is\ninstill in me and teach me a particular\nsocial skill I was like I don't know who\nthis person is they're like no you have\nto talk to them for five minutes\nand I was like this sucks but I did it\nthey made me do it and now it's like I\nknow how to maintain a relationship\nbecause they taught me\nso so much just think about what you\nwere really taught\nabout maintaining relationships if you\nstruggle to maintain a relationship even\nat the age of 25 do your parents sit\ndown with you and say hey you seem kind\nof lonely like what are you doing like\nyou know did your parents even maintain\nrelationships\nand so once you start to realize and\nwhat I discovered as a psychiatrist is\nthere's no such thing as a loser\ndoes not exist it's a judgment that we\nmake out of ignorance\nof what is this person's circumstances\nwhat is their upbringing what were they\ntaught what were they given and what I\nstarted to see is there's no such thing\nas a loser it's just their karma\ndoes that mean that they deserve it\nthat's not what karma is about karma is\nabout understanding what are all the\nthousand different things that form\ntogether to create a human being in the\nyear 2022 at the age of 25.\nand how much does that person control\nvery little\nso now we get to something really\nimportant and once I share that with\nthat person once we can get on the same\npage hey there's a lot of stuff that\nactually is not your fault\nonce we remove loser from the equation\nthen something really magical starts to\nhappen\nbecause now you begin to realize okay\nit's not my fault that I'm here but it's\nabsolutely my responsibility to do\nsomething about it then the question\nbecomes what can I do\nso\nthere are a couple of steps to this the\nfirst and we're going to kind of\nsummarize this because people say this\nthe first is don't blame yourself\nfor all of it\nright you could blame yourself for some\nof it but this is what we're sort of\ntalking about take a karmic perspective\nwhat what are you taught about\nmaintaining relationships\nonce you don't blame yourself\nnext thing that you've got to figure out\nis what are you truly responsible for\nStep One is get rid of all of the blame\nstep two is okay what am I responsible\nfor\nnow here's where the mind is going to do\na really important trick\nwhen you start to think about what\nyou're responsible for if you're not\ncareful your thought thinking about\nshoulds\nI should do this I should do that I\nshould do this I should be able to do\nthis I should should should should\nshooting yourself in the foot\nthe right question isn't what you should\ndo\nthe right question is what can you do\nso when I'm thinking about a goal like\nlet's say I'm here\nI should be here\nI have so much potential I should be\nable to get an A I should be able to\nmaintain relationships the gap between\nhere and here is wide and as I take one\nstep forward\nI'm unsatisfied\nbecause look at what I should have\naccomplished all this\nand so progress actually makes you feel\nworse\nand if in the system of your mind\nprogress makes you feel worse because\nany time you take a step forward\nall you focus on is the nine steps that\nyou didn't take forward you're never\ngonna get there\nso I was once working with a East Asian\nkid\nadolescent in high school\nand says I came like was really like\ndepressed right so his parents had\nbrought me to to my office\nwith so much frustration at the end of\ntheir rope\nthey're like my kid keeps on bringing up\nbasically what they were saying tried to\ncover it up is like my keep my kid keeps\non bringing up this depression crap\nso can you please fix him\nbecause he keeps on bringing up this\nexcuse\nand as I talked to the kid I was like\nyou know why do you feel sad\nand he says for once in my life\nI got a 93 on a test on a math on a\ncalculus test\nI told my parent my parents asked me\nwhat grade did you get I said I got a\n93.\nand for once in my life all I want from\nmy parents is instead of looking at the\nseven questions I got wrong I wish they\nwould look at the 93 questions I got\nright\njust once I want them to look at the 93\nquestions I got right but they never\nlook at the 93 all they ever look at is\nthe seven questions I got wrong\nand if you take one step forward in your\nlife and you say to yourself this isn't\nwhat I should do I should be better I\nshould be able to accomplish more you\nare doing the same damn thing\nis that kid's parents\nyou're just focusing on the stuff that\nyou fail to do\nand what is that going to do for your\nmotivation\nso be very careful when I start to ask\nyou okay what are you responsible for in\nterms of social Improvement and making\nfriends and all this kind of stuff\nyou're gonna your mind is gonna populate\nautomatically catch it\nwith all the thousand things you should\ndo\nthat's not how you move forward and this\nis what we mean in like the yogic\ntradition we say live in the present\nlike you will see it on all of the blogs\nand Instagrams and whatnot live in the\npresent present is good\nwhat does that mean that means what can\nyou do not what should you do because\nyou're here\nthis is the future this is the should\nit's to look over here instead look over\nhere because this is where you are\nand ask yourself what can I do today\nforget about what you should do forget\nabout your potential forget about all\nthat kind of stuff today if you are a 25\nyear old loner what can you do today\nand do that thing and you could say I\ncan't do anything that's okay too so\nit's really asking yourself what can you\ndo because the answer isn't nothing I\ncan't go out I should go to a bar and\nmake friends but I can't go out to a bar\nand make friends okay fine can you\nmessage someone on Discord\ncan you send a text to an old friend of\nyours\ncan you respond to your group like your\nwork groups WhatsApp Group whatever\nyour work WhatsApp group or your work\nsignal chat or whatever can you what can\nyou do and start with those things\nand that something magical will happen\nwhen you forget about the should and you\nforget about the future and you focus on\nwhat you can do your goal\nis to do something whatever\nand then as you really start with what\nyou can do not what you should do\nyou focus on that thing\nand as you do that at the end of the day\nyou will have a success behind you\ninstead of a failure even though the\naction is the same\nright because I can send a message to a\nfriend of mine say hey what's up you\nwant to catch up sometime but if my goal\nis to make a thousand friends I'm gonna\nlook at that and be like this pathetic\nloser\nall he can do is message someone online\nand then the same action can be progress\nor success or it can be a sign of your\noverwhelming hopelessness is a human\nbeing\nand so start with that thing\njust start with what you can do\nand your mind will create all kinds of\njudgments let them come it's okay\nlittle judge judge judge judge judge\nand say you know what I did what I can\ndo today\nand this is what's pretty neat about\nthat for people who are skeptical but\nthey're like I'll never get there\nso I was working on the stroke unit\nat the Massachusetts General Hospital\nthese are people who have strokes and\ncan't walk anymore how do you get\nsomeone who can't walk anymore to walk\none step at a time\nwhat can you move okay let's figure out\ncan you move your can you wiggle your\ntoes all right great can you lift your\nleg all right great\ncan you take a step not really okay\nwe're just gonna lift legs today\njust wiggle your toes and lift your leg\ncurl flex your ankle extend your ankle\nextend at the knee joint flex at the\nknee joint let's just start where we are\nand this is literally the scientifically\nvalid proven process that physical\ntherapists will do with people who have\nlost a chunk of their brain\nand these amazing human beings that are\nphysical therapists can take a human\nbeing who's lost a chunk of their brain\nand get them walking again\nthat's the strategy that we need to\nimplement for our mind\nstart with where you are take one step\nforward and as you do that day after day\nafter day after day and this is where\nyour mind is going to say oh my God\nthat's so exhausting it's going to take\nsuch a long time we don't care about\nthat because what are we focusing on\ntoday\nforget about it\nwe're not worried about tomorrow don't\nthink about tomorrow the more you start\nto think about tomorrow\nwe're moving towards the future\noh my God I have to do this a hundred\ndays a thousand days how many days will\nit take to catch up all bad thoughts\nnot going to be productive it's the\nfuture thinking mind just gonna do it\ntoday just gonna do it today just gonna\ndo it today\nand if you learn to do that\nand then start to accumulate other\nthings like resources and stuff like\nthat because what you can do today isn't\nalways action it can also be like\nlearning right so even if I don't know\nhow to go out to a bar can I\npractice social skills somewhere else\nright that's why we have Social Sandbox\non Discord\ncan I learn a little bit about\nmotivation okay that's why we have Dr\nK's guide\ncan I learn a little bit more about\nanxiety and social anxiety okay like\nthat also like you can maybe go see a\ntherapist you can watch Dr K's guide\nthere's all kinds of stuff you can do\nwith it is do something today whatever\nyou can do\nand accept that and hopefully if you\nkeep doing that you won't be a 25 year\nold loner or if you are a 25 year old\nloner you won't be a 25 year old 26 year\nold boner\nquestions\nat field is saying what the Social\nSandbox how does it work great question\nso social sandboxes and Discord so\nhere's what we realized\nparents aren't teaching y'all how to\nsocialize properly\nand by properly it's not their fault\nbecause the world has changed as we\nstart to use Discord and online things\nwe start to become more socially anxious\nthe parts of our brain this is kind of a\nreally interesting concept so\npart of the reason that I think the\nsubjective experience of social anxiety\nis increasing\nis because the parts of our brain that\nreassure us\nin social situations are actually\nstarting to become vestigial or atrophy\nso when I interact with human beings in\nperson there are parts of my brain that\ninterpret body language and they do it\nwithout our awareness\nso when they like when I sit around and\nlike if I'm a seven-year-old and I spend\nevery day playing with my friends\noutside I learn to interpret body\nlanguage eight years old nine years old\nten years old 12 years old and then when\nI'm hanging out with people when I'm 16\nthat part of my brain works really well\nand it interprets all the body language\nand it tells me hey you're doing fine\neveryone here likes you\nwhen we start communicating online that\npart of the brain shuts off just like a\nlanguage that we don't practice our\nbrain is like hey we don't need this\nthing anymore\nso our ability to be reassured by Body\nLanguage and behavioral signals\ndecreases\nas that part of our brain decreases when\nwe enter social situations we no longer\nhave reassurance from that\nwhich results in increased social\nanxiety so the more that we use the\ninternet as a communication tool the\nmore socially anxious we become\nso we discovered this\n8he and so we decided hey you know what\nlet's just give people a chance\nliterally to practice talking\nit's a Sandbox where you can come in and\njust have a conversation intentionally\nit's not just about socializing on\nDiscord it's intentionally to learn the\nskills\nof socializing\nright people are going to be they're\ngoing to ask you okay let's talk and\nthen as you struggle to talk a coach is\ngoing to be they're going to be like\nokay what are you feeling right now\nlet's figure out how to overcome those\nfeelings let's try again\nand what it is I don't know how to say\nthis but like you can jump into the\nwater and teach yourself to swim\neventually or you can go to a swimming\nclass and within the span of two weeks\nyou can learn how to swim\nwith focused intention\nand this thing for people who feel\nbehind in life\nthey're like oh my God it's so hard to\nlearn it's so hard to learn on your own\nI completely agree if you try to figure\nout yourself it'll take you five years\nbut with the help of someone who knows\nwhat they're doing\nyou can learn a language in one month\nyou can learn to swim in two weeks you\ncan learn to ride a bike in a day\nyou can learn how to talk to another\nhuman being in a couple of weeks\nit just requires focused practice right\nfocused guidance\njade06 is saying I've been lonely for\nyears and I feel stressed when\nsocializing and I can't tolerate any\nmore making my feelings even worse\nshould I just give up no\nyou should do it differently\nso I think that there's\nwhat's making you want to give up The\nFeelings have piled up\nso what you've got to do is\nclean out the feelings\nright so anytime so this is important to\nunderstand about how the mind works\nwe have in mind\nwhen our mind has a negative experience\nit comes with negative emotion\nwhen we have a pile of negative ocean in\nour mind we have two options we can\nprocess it or we can numb it\nas we turn to technology which is so\ndamn accessible we numb it right so if I\nhave a terrible if I'm awkward at a\nparty I'll give you all an example let's\nsay I feel awkward at a party what do I\ndo I flip out and I start scrolling on\nmy phone what happens to the awkwardness\nit kind of gets pushed to the back it's\nkind of still there it doesn't really\nget fixed but it becomes more tolerable\nand then I leave the party because no\none is talking to me for an hour why is\nno one talking to me forever because I'm\non my phone\nand then you're like man I feel like\nsuch a loser no one wants to talk to me\nlike\nand then you take those bundle of\nemotions with you\nsome people may say the answer is just\nget off your phone noob no it's not the\nanswer because if you could do it you\nwould have done it right\nso then when you take those pile of\nemotions now what happens is the next\ntime you go to the party how do you feel\ngoing in\nyou carry those a pile of emotions with\nyou your brain has been wired to do this\nsame mechanism of PTSD as you enter and\nthere's music playing and stuff like\nthat your brain is like oh by the way\nwe've been in this this environment\nbefore this environment sucks\nup comes the up surging of negative\nemotions that you had from the last time\nthat you went home you had a couple\ndrinks you played some video games you\ndidn't process it at all so all those\nemotions are waiting for you they're\nlike hey\nhere we are\nand so as those emotions come surging in\nwhat do you do\nhere's the phone\nstarted scrolling\ncycle repeats itself\nso if you're in this situation it can\nfeel like your only choice is to suffer\nor give up\nbut what you've really got to do is take\nall those emotions that have piled up\nand like process them or vent them in\nsome way\nright so therapy is a good option\nfor sure there are all kinds of things\nlike meditation journaling going for\nlong walks just letting those emotions\ncome out\nin a safe way inventing them unburdening\nyourself\ncoaching can help with that too\nbut the goal in coaching if you go to it\nand coaching coaching isn't just going\nto sit there and listen to your emotions\nit's not a venting space if that's what\ny'all are looking for therapy is more\nappropriate we're not saying that you\ncan't vent there but the goal of\ncoaching if and this is all arguably\nalso true of therapy I've read some\nreally interesting articles about what\ntherapy is and isn't recently really\ninteresting\nbut the goal in coaching is really going\nto be to change your behavior and get\nyou to be able to go to the party and\nlike have fun there\nso venting emotion and sort of working\nthrough that is like a necessary step\nto moving forward\nalso not a bad idea to just get a\nstraight up clinical evaluation for\nsomething like social anxiety great\nquestion though\nDr K could you do a stream on good\nparenting on like my mindful parenting\nand parenting Styles I could do a stream\nI think the challenge is that a stream\nwon't cut it\nso here's been our experience with\nparenting\nthe first is that we've got a whole\ncourse on good parenting\nI mean it's not really a course on good\nparenting it's a good it's a course on\ncommunication and Boundary setting\nessentially it's a course designed for\nparents whose kids are struggling with\ntechnology addiction so we've got that\nand why is it in the course format it's\nbecause\nit like builds right so this is the\nshortcoming of things like twitch and\nYouTube is that they don't build\nit's like a bite-sized thing that's what\nthe platform is designed for\nright twitch streams and YouTube videos\nare designed to be holy like isolated\nindependent things\nso there are some formats that are\nsuperior to these pla like it's just the\nplatform like if you think about a\ncourse at a university\nlike the whole point of the course is\nthat week two and week three and week\nfour build on week one\nand each Builds on the next and when it\nreally comes to good parenting that's\nthat's what that's how we approach it we\nalso have a couple of like add-ons right\nlike so almost DLCs of sort there's some\nstuff about parenting in our upcoming\nguide\nabout how to parent a kid with ADHD\nbecause that's what's really interesting\nis we always like think about oh my\nparents failed me because they didn't\nparent good enough so the really\ninteresting thing\nif you have a diagnosis of ADHD\nthere is strong strong evidence that it\nshapes your parents parenting style\nincreases their depression and increases\ntheir stress level\nit's not your fault I mean you didn't\nask to be born with ADHD but there are\nparent they're bi-directional effects\nwhen it comes to Parenting and ADHD so\nwe go into that Nuance which is\nsomething that a lot of parents feel\nsuper guilty and kids blame them and\nit's like a really unhealthy kind of\nthing\nparents don't realize that it's not\ntheir fault that having a neuroatypical\nchild makes like it hard to be a parent\nbecause the rules of parenting change\nwe've been taught particular rules about\nhow to parent and when you have a child\nwho's not neurotypical you have to\nchange the rules you have to adapt to\nthe rules and the cool thing is that\nwhen you adapt the rules to the needs of\nthe child\nthen everyone gets better\nthere's even been studies that show that\nif you have a parent with anxiety and a\nchild with anxiety\nif you treat the parents anxiety without\ntouching the child the child's anxiety\nimproves\nthere's a lot to dive into and I don't\nthink a single stream will cut it that\nbeing said if you all have I love the\nquestion peacock lover and if you all\nhave more specific like can you do\nparenting about like if there's an\nisolated independent thing that we can\ncover in an hour I'm happy to do it\nAlim haha is asking is being a 25 year\nold loner okay yes\nit's okay to be a 25 year old loner and\nyou should do something about it\nsee that's the thing is like we start to\nlive in a society where we think we\nshould only do stuff we should only act\nwhen things are wrong\nI disagree\nah excellent question X bar BX\nwhat happens when you do your thing for\nthe day and text an old friend but they\nnever end up responding completely\nirrelevant\nremember we started this discussion with\nwhat are you responsible for and what is\nthe rest of the world responsible for in\nthat question we see something really\nreally tricky which is you're starting\nto accept responsibility for the\nbehavior of another person if they don't\nrespond how do you feel about yourself\nyou feel like a loser\nthat's what screws you\nnot your fault that they didn't respond\nshould have no impact\non your self-worth or what you do\ntomorrow\ndidn't work no big deal let's move on\ntomorrow what can I do today\nsame thing same thing does not matter at\nall\nwhat you control is your actions not the\noutcomes of your actions\nif I failed a test\nbut I studied eight hours a day for the\nten days before the test not my fault\nnow is there something to be learned\nfrom that oh yeah by the way I studied\nfor the wrong test\nright I'm not saying that there isn't\ncorrective behavior on your part but\nlike\nyou can't control whether other people\nrespond all you can control is what you\ncan do\nso then maybe there's a learning there\nright so tomorrow what can you do maybe\nif you're reaching out to a different\nfriend take a look at your message and\ntry to figure out okay what could I say\nthat could be a little bit different is\nthere some way I can improve\nand if you do that you'll get there 100\npercent\nor I guess 99 I feel confident I should\nsay\nright because I don't know that you're\nthe outcome isn't something that I can\npredict\nso scary printer sounds is saying it\njust takes commitment\nthat is both correct and incorrect\nso it doesn't even this is a scary thing\n99 of the time scary printer sounds is\nright it just takes commitment\none percent though there's no such thing\nas commitment there's just what you do\ntoday\ncommitment is hard\nthis is just what you do it doesn't take\ncommitment just takes today\njust today just today just today\nhow do I improve my social skills when\nsomebody who has social anxiety\ndisorder and can barely handle how do I\nimprove my social skills with somebody\nor I'm gonna assume that so dasania kale\nis asking how do I improve my social\nskills I'm going to assume as somebody\nwho has social anxiety disorder so if\nyou have a clinical diagnosis the first\nstep is treatment\nright so there are certain treatments\nthat you can use that will reduce the\nburden of that diagnosis\nand then you go out and you rehabilitate\nand this is where I think therapists\nhave fallen short\nbecause we become so overwhelmed by like\nthe severity of mental illness that we\ndon't really do like psychology rehab\nbut that's what a lot of these people\nneed so if you've grown up with social\nanxiety your whole life you have to\nstart with treatment but the challenge\nis that treatment is not a substitute\nfor 10 years of atrophied social skills\nwith living with social anxiety\nwhat we need is like psychological rehab\nand we'll even have this in some parts\nof Psychiatry or psychology where you'll\nhave some kinds of like professional\nrehab and things like that\nwhere like\nso I trained at this place called McLean\nHospital and McLean Hospital has really\ngood programs for people to like learn\nhow to have a job\nso they'll set you up with like an\ninternship at a non-profit or something\nlike that where you like learn how to\nshow up every day on time you get a task\nassign some kind of tasks and then you\nkind of go go home\nand so you learn some of these core\nskills which you can feel pathetic for\nnot learning but if you've lived with\nmental illness that has deprived you of\nnormal developmental Milestones you've\ngot to make up for it\nokay\nso Abby wrote is asking what if I feel\nlike I have nothing to say\nthis is what I want you to do\nI want you to go back and watch any\ninterview that we've done\nand I want you to pay attention to what\nDr K says\nfor the first half hour of any interview\ndoes Dr K have anything to say\nabsolutely not\nmaybe here or there I'm sure you can\nprove that statement wrong\nyou don't have anything I have to have\nanything to say to have a conversation\nall you have to do is be willing to\nlisten\nthat's what it takes to have a\nconversation not don't need anything to\nsay if you've got nothing to say on the\nsubject doesn't mean you can't talk\nabout it case in point my I have friends\nwho talk about Finance all the time I\ngot nothing to say about Finance so when\nI participate in those conversations\nmost of what it is is me learning\nit's like hey can you explain what this\nmeans\ncan you help me understand that all you\nneed\nright\nkind of interesting at some point you\nmay have something to say\nthen you can share it\nokay I'm gonna try to catch up with a\ncouple of comments\ndo you think it's late to socialize at\n31 I feel too old for every social\nactivity I see 20 years for the most\npart it's never too late to socialize\nI'm not saying that you're not going to\nfeel old or out of place if you start\nhanging out with a bunch of 20 year olds\nbut it's not too late it's just let's be\nclear\nif you go if you're a 31 year old and\nyou hang out with a bunch of like mid\n20-somethings you're going to feel out\nof place does that mean it's too late to\nsocialize no it just means that you feel\nout of place\nthat's it\nit's just a feeling it's not a truth\nit's just a feeling\nI realize this front and center like\nwhen I started residency\naverage age of people was like 25 26\nmaybe 27 actually\nand I was like 31 32.\nlike people are still\nsome of them are getting married some of\nthem are married like I'm having kids\nand so like\nyou know like it's weird\nI started med school at the age of 28\nmost people started at the age of like\n22.\nI'm coming up on 30. I had my 30th\nbirthday in med school\nand they're like yeah 24 let's go party\nand I'm like I'm 30 dude\nso it's totally okay to be older than\nlike people\nyou're just older\nmeans I can I can still study I can\nstill hang out with them\nif you're hanging out with people who\nare 20 in their 20s and going to a\nconcert like even if you're 31 and\nthey're 25 both y'all can listen to the\nmusic\nso focus on what you're there for\nI'm not saying it's easy but let's be\nprecise about whether it's possible\nand what's truly getting in the way\nwhat's getting in the way is here"
