    "transcript": "if you are trying to get your family\ninvolved in changing the household you\nhave to give them some latitude in what\nthe solutions are you can't tell them\nhey this is the standard to which the\nkitchen is going to clean I need all\ny'all to listen if you want to exert\nFinancial power you can do that but the\nwhole point is that I don't think that's\ngoing to work very well how can I\nself-improve while living in an\nenvironment very unconducive to it my\nenvironment i-26m live with my parents\nI'm not broke they are they need my help\nso from the beginning we have\nresponsibility trapped my dad is in his\nearly 60s and basically retired he has\nno retirement fund and lives off of\nSocial Security checks and food stamps\nhe's kind and supportive to me but\nbeyond that he's a very annoying person\nto deal with with his whole person with\nhis whole personality is watching\nConspiracy Theory videos and he lets\nthat affect his real life decision\nmaking not getting the vaccine even\nthough mom is immunocompromised not\nsaving money because he thinks banks are\ngoing under and wasting a thousand plus\nyear on a garden because he thinks the\nfood supply chain will be destroyed my\nmom is is late 50s and dying she has\nmultiple medical conditions some out of\nher control some stemming from being a\nchronic smoker her father died when I\nwas in high school and ever since she\nfell into a deep depression stopped\nworking and gave up we've tried to get\nher some form of income in the form of\ndisability income but she's extremely\nuncooperative with doing the paperwork\nand we also believe the window\nforgetting that has passed I don't know\nhow terminal her conditions are though I\ndid Google one of them and it says\nshe'll be lucky to make it five years my\nbrother 21 also lives with us but the\npandemic disrupted his plans to start\ncollege he's fallen deeper and deeper\ninto his video game addiction he eats\nextremely unhealthy because of my\nparents laissez-faire style of parenting\nlet him do whatever he wants to without\ndiscipline or Direction his diet is\nliterally peanuts pretzels cheese\nCheez-Its goldfish and chips I've\noffered him 100 plus to try new foods\nand he refuses this means that a nearly\nUnlimited Supply of those junk food are\nin the house at all times I've begged my\ndad to give him some tough love\nthreatened to take away his video games\nif he doesn't start doing stuff like\ngetting a driver's license and applying\nto college but he won't my brother is\nwell over 300 pounds and on the path to\ndiet 35. he literally has a free ride to\ncollege waiting for him through FAFSA\nbut refuses to go the moment my parents\ndie the free ride goes away and he's\neither going to have to drown in debt or\ngo get a [ __ ] job that doesn't live up\nto his potential for some reason he\ndoesn't see this massive risk to him\nthough because he's never been giving\ngiven any consequences his entire life\nso essentially my environment is crap\nand there's nothing I can do about it\ndon't tell me to move out they can't\nafford the mortgage without me and I'm\nnot going to let my mom go homeless her\nlast few years of life I'm not going to\nlet my brother go without having one\nperson in the house who cares about\ntrying to motivate him to fulfill his\npotential my dad honestly I wouldn't\nfeel bad about forcing to handle the\nconsequence of his own decisions but I\nwon't turn my back on my brother and mom\nhowever this comes with sacrifices that\nmake it incredibly difficult to fulfill\nmy own potential there's junk food in a\nhealthy unhealthy meals around me 24 7.\nif I want to not binge eat it takes pure\nwillpower there's no us bringing in bad\nfood to the house I have massive anxiety\nabout catching and bringing home the\nvirus because my mom and dad are on vacs\nthis stresses me and leads me to do\nthings that I want to not want to do oh\nsorry not doing things I want to I don't\nDodge the whole environment issue by\nconstantly not being at home work in the\noffice study at coffee shop Etc but that\nexposes them to more risk I live 40\nminutes from my work and friends it's\nvery hard to date as kind-hearted as\nhelping my parents out is me not having\na place to go hook up is an attraction\nkiller like it or not being a 26 year\nold man who lives at home with his\nparents in America no matter how valid\nthe reason is a deal breaker for a lot\nof quality Independent Women I pay 200 a\nmonth more in rent to my parents than I\ndid at my last place additionally there\nare gas costs anytime there's a major uh\nmy mom knows how to guilt me into buying\nher every last Comfort item she wants\nbasically anytime I go out to eat fast\nfood I'm buying for two and she's\nguilting me about it anytime there's a\nmajor expense for them it's me the\nelectric bill goes too high I'm paying\nit my parents dogs need inoculations I'm\npaying dogs can get vaccinations by the\nway our Internet modem gets struck by\nlightning I'm buying the replacement\nit's financially draining to me I don't\nlike the city I live in it doesn't have\naccess to the types of concert sporting\nevents or even young ambitious diverse\npeople I want to be friends with my city\nalso has very limited job prospects for\nmy field of study I could easily go to a\nbigger city where I find a job where I\nearn 2x my income but instead I'm stuck\nin a crappy entry-level job trying to do\neverything I can to angle my way up the\nladder without blowing a chance at one\nof the few companies in my area who\noffers the jobs that I want the house is\nvery dirty and while I put substantial\nwork into making my room a clean space\nbeing one person trying to clean up the\nmess made over years by four people is\nextremely difficult this also means I\nhave to work from home in my room which\nis difficult space to be productive in\nthey've refused to give me an office\ndespite me asking at least once a month\nyou know the average of The Five People\nYou spend the most time with and three\nof these five people are issues that I\ndescribed are people with issues I\ndescribed I'm not trying to blame my\ncurrent state five eight two sixty\npounds struggling in career depressed on\nmy family I want to do whatever I can to\nhelp both help myself and them at the\nsame time but living in this environment\nisn't helping whatsoever what can I do\nto find a way to work on improving\nmyself while also living in an\nenvironment where almost every obstacle\nimaginable is put on a daily basis is\nput up on a daily basis and the people I\nlive with couldn't care less about\nself-improvement so this is tough we\ndon't talk about the situation enough\nI'm a good person I'm trying to put my\nlife together I have a job I'm going to\ndo what a good son does I'm going to\nhelp out my family right I can't abandon\nmy mom like she's ill potentially\nterminally ill if I don't pay them rent\nthey can't afford the mortgage I'm not\nwilling to let my mom become homeless my\nbrother is moving in the wrong direction\nand someone's gotta gotta try to help\nhim and it ain't gonna be dad because\nDad spends his whole time you know like\nwatching Conspiracy Theory videos mom\nwon't do the paperwork to get additional\nincome won't do the paperwork to file\nfor disability brother refuse is to go\nto college plays video games all day\neats like crap and parents enable his\nbad behavior and he doesn't even try to\nhelp them right so he enables their bad\nbehavior they enable his bad behavior\nyou've got one person in the household\nwho's trying to keep it together and\nthey're drowning so what a lot of people\nwill do in this situation is say there's\nno way you can help people who don't\nwant to help themselves leave get out\nwhile you can they'll even do things\nlike we'll say things like oh if you can\nearn twice as much in a separate City\nmove out of the house earn twice as much\nand send money back to try to support\nyour parents right there are all kinds\nof solutions that people will offer just\nstop doing XYZ abandon your family but\nthis person is very clear I'm not\nwilling to abandon them right is this\nguilt are they victims of guilt because\nwe do know that this person gets\nemotionally manipulated the guilt gets\nthe better of them but how do you draw\nthe line between doing your duty as a\nfamily member and not abandoning your\nfamily versus avoiding guilt and being\nmanipulated by guilt right because\nthat's like it's subtle it's important\nso what we're going to do today is talk\nabout how to approach this situation\nthere's going to be a lot of details\nthere's going to be a lot of like nuts\nand bolts of conversations it's going to\nbe hard to follow it's also most likely\nnot going to work out the way I I'm\ngonna explain it right so I expect a lot\nof difficulties but the truth of the\nmatter is that there is a way to have a\nconversation to work with your family to\nget on the same page I've seen it happen\nit's a hard tightrope to walk but there\nis a tightrope and because it's so hard\nto walk no one tries to walk it everyone\nsays don't even bother just live for\nyourself okay so let's dive in the first\nthing that you have to do is have\nconversations okay you have to have a\nspace and a time and a regularity of\nconversations this is the first goal\nbecause you can't what a lot of people\nwill also suggest is that you use your\nfinancial power in a relationship to\nenforce compliance right so this person\neven is even and saying dad use tough\nlove like you people can say like stop\npaying for stuff unless they start doing\nthings and we'll get to boundary setting\nand like reinforcement and stuff like\nthat but there's sort of this idea that\nlike if you're the breadwinner in the\nhousehold you can use your power to\nenforce behavior for other people that's\ngoing to be really hard not saying that\nit isn't worth doing but first of all\nthis person gets emotionally guilted it\nseems like they don't really have a good\nrole model for how to do that so let's\nassume for a moment that we want to use\npower as a last resort let's assume for\na moment that we're going to try to make\nit work in this household so how do you\ndo that the first thing is you have to\nhave regular conversations and what I\nwould do is these conversations need to\nbe kind of meta level and they need to\nbe avoiding judgment so what I would do\nis I would ask everyone in your\nhousehold hey I think we should start\nsitting down and talking a little bit\nabout the direction that this family is\ngoing in and like whether if we're happy\nwith things great let's continue doing\nthem if we're unhappy with things we\nshould at least sit down and kind of\ntalk about it now already your family\nwill be on the defensive because they'll\nthink that this conversation is about\nthem you gotta ask them hey are we\nwilling to like can we all just get\ntogether and talk for one hour a week\nfor the next four weeks just about how\nthings are going so you have to\ndemonstrate some amount of leadership in\nthis situation you have to frame a\nconversation now getting them to come is\na real problem because if they choose\nnot to come what is the stick that\nyou're going to use if a carrot doesn't\nwork and I wouldn't start bribing them\nwith money and say hey I'll give you\nmoney if you come I would just say hey\nthis family is important to me like\nthere's some stuff that I'm concerned\nabout I think we should start talking\nabout it and working on it together as a\nfamily you got to get everyone in the\nroom once you do that you have to be\nkind of careful because remember\neveryone's going to be defensive right\nthey're like thinking I'm going to talk\nabout you know you know he's gonna he's\ngonna blame me because I'm not doing\nsomething right because your whole\nfamily knows that they're not doing\nthings right they everyone knows so then\nwhat you've got to do is you've got to\nask them questions open-ended questions\nnon-judgmental questions hey I'd love to\nhear every from everyone what they like\nabout how we do things at home so Mom\ncan you tell me a little bit about what\nyou like Dad can you tell me a little\nbit about what you like brother do you\ntell me a little bit about what you like\nnext thing you're going to do is you're\ngoing to ask question okay does anyone\nthink that I could be doing things\ndifferently are there things that I do\nor say that you think make it hard to\nlive here that bother you so you're\ngoing to start by opening actually up to\nyour own faults right we need to disarm\nthe defensiveness from your family so\nyou can say okay what can I do better\nnow you can't start by asking your mom\nhey what is it what can Mom do better\nwe're absolutely we need to get to that\nconversation but you have to start by\nsort of pointing out to yourself okay\nwhat are your flaws okay so mom thinks I\ncould be doing this better mom thinks I\ncould be doing this better and then\nyou're going to model something else\nonce they say stuff you're gonna add\nstuff to the list you're gonna say in\naddition to that Mom I noticed that\nsometimes I'm not quite as generous when\nI eat out with fast food so one thing\nthat I'm going to work on is not making\nyou like feel like you have to beg me if\nI'm going to get food because I don't\nlike the way that you know that creates\nlike emotions between us so I'm going to\nwork on that you're going to model for\nthem that people can point out things\nabout you that are not perfect and that\nyou can accept their feedback and you\ncan try to work on them because I don't\nsee this this in the family I don't see\na structure of if there's a problem\nlet's be intentional about diagnosing it\nand fixing it everyone just like kind of\nlets things so once you have that\nconversation this could be over the\ncourse of two weeks so we've already met\ntwice week number three you need to\nstart talking to people about what\nthey're unhappy with with the house\nwe're not going to get to specific\npeople how do you all feel about the\nkitchen do you all like living in this\nkitchen what about the living room what\nabout this room then what you've got to\nask your family is what do we want to do\nabout this stuff right we can all agree\nthat the kitchen is a mess what do you\nall think we should do about this and\nthis is really important when you live\nin a family and you know everything\nwrong that people are doing Brothers\nplaying video games all the time Dad is\nwatching Conspiracy Theory videos mom is\nnot taking care of her health and\ncontinues to smoke and y'all are having\nfinancial problems and your mom is a\nchronic smoker those things could be\nrelated can you all even afford\ncigarettes you see all the problems in\nyour family but if you go in there and\nyou start charging about hey you're\ndoing this wrong you're doing this wrong\nyou're doing this wrong you're doing\nthis wrong no one's gonna listen right\nand then you get fed up with frustration\nand you post about it on the internet\nyou're like I've tried to help them\neveryone's like you've done your best\nlet them go go be independent you've\ntried everything you've tried so this is\nreally important if you're trying to get\nyour family involved in changing the\nhousehold you have to give them some\nlatitude in what the solutions are you\ncan't tell them hey this is the standard\nto which the kitchen is going to clean I\nneed all y'all to listen if you want to\nexert Financial power you can do that\nbut the whole point is that I don't\nthink that's going to work very well so\nyou've got to ask them what do you all\nthink we should do about the kitchen and\nyou want to get everyone's input because\nif they suggest something then like\nthey're more likely to listen right\nobviously so then you listen you you\nwrite these things down okay dad thinks\nwe should do this maybe we should all\nlike eat together and clean together for\nfive minutes brother thinks that we\nshould do this so as you get these\ndifferent kinds of solutions you put\nthem down on a piece of paper and then\nyou ask people okay like who is willing\nto take responsibility for this ask the\nthe question to your family whose job is\nit to keep this place clean and then\npeople will basically like point to\nanyone but themselves right they'll say\nlike oh it's like it's the woman's job\nand then Mom will say but I'm Ill I\ncan't do it and then your brother's like\nwell I can't do it for this reason and\nso then you're gonna just point that out\nto people and say like okay how what are\nwe gonna do about this as a family\nbecause no one wants to accept\nresponsibility for this I work I have to\ndrive 40 minutes mom is sick dad doesn't\nknow how to do it brother doesn't get\naround to it and so what are we going to\ndo about this so this is really\nimportant but you you sort of need to be\nthe leader here but you can't tell\npeople what to do the way that you're\ngoing to be the leader is by Framing the\nconversation and you're going to let\nthem come up with the answers because\nnow you know like what amount of fuel\nyour family is going to give you and if\npeople say like okay like we're gonna do\nthis this and this you've got to be\nsuper careful here because people will\nmake big big promises so then you need\nto have another conversation maybe week\nfour now so people have said they're\ngoing to do particular things what\nhappens when someone doesn't do what\nthey say they're gonna do and this is\nwhere all kinds of things could happen\npeople could get defensive they're like\nwell you don't do what you say you're\ngonna do and you're like yeah I\ncompletely understand that I'm not\nsaying I'm I'm better than anyone else\nhere what I'm saying is as a family what\nis our system of accountability if\nsomeone says they're going to do\nsomething they don't do it like what\nhappens and then people are going to\nkind of shrug you're going to say okay\nso like I think I'm seeing a problem is\nthat this as a family we don't really\nhold each other accountable really at\nall and so people get to do what they\nwant to which is exactly why the kitchen\nis a mess because no one's accountable\nwhat do you all think about that is that\nfair I'm not blaming any one of you\nbecause we all do it right we all\nparticipate in it we're all like guilty\nin This Together the question is do we\nas a family want to change and if so\nwhat are we willing to do and what kind\nof consequences are we going to oppose\nthere's also like other like really\nbasic stuff that you're gonna have to\ntalk about with your family like\nfinances so this is we're going to get\neveryone together and we're going to say\nokay so like I'd like to talk about\nfinances I'd like to understand what we\nas a family are going to do like or\nlet's try to figure this out like who's\nopen to trying to figure it out I'm not\nblaming anyone I'm just trying to figure\nout what's the money we have coming in\nwhat's the money we have going out so\nthis is where especially if you grow up\nin a household with financially\nirresponsible parents you as a kid will\nthis is completely foreign to you some\nkids take this for granted because like\ntheir parents automatically taught them\nhow to do it they were given allowances\nthey were given certain amounts of money\nthey were taught financial\nresponsibility from a young age but if\nyour parents don't know how to be\nfinancially responsible you certainly\ndon't know how to be financially\nresponsible so you've got to figure it\nout and then you've got to teach them so\nI would start with something as simple\nas a budget every month what is all the\nmoney that we have coming in to this\nhousehold what is all the money that we\nhave going out how much do we spend on\nfood how much do we spend on mortgage\nhow much do we spend on electricity how\nmuch do we spend on on cigarettes and\nthen what you're going to do is you're\ngoing to point out okay what is\neveryone's responsibility here so I'm\nbringing in this much dad is bringing in\nthis much brothers bringing in nothing\nmom is bringing in nothing it looks like\nwe don't have enough money for stuff so\nlike I'm paying for most of the stuff\nhere like what do you all think about\nthat and then this is where this is what\nI'm willing to do but I can't do it\nmyself or let's talk about that are you\nall expecting me to essentially\nfinancially support this is where you\nturn your brother right who's the video\ngame addict and you ask him like what's\nyour plan are you expecting me to is I\njust want to be clear I'm not saying\nit's right or wrong I'm just asking what\nare you expecting from me ask your\nfamily what are you all expecting from\nme are you all expecting me to continue\nto financially support this family and\nif something needs to be paid for I need\nto know whether that's a burden that's\non my shoulder so that's something we're\nsharing this is where people are going\nto feel guilty they'll start to make\nexcuses like your brother will be like\nyeah I'll get around to it and so then\nthis is where I I think it now we get to\nsome of the hard questions so you turn\nto your mom and you can say she's like\nI'm sick what can you do because I'm\nstruggling is there anything you can do\nto help me and if she says no I'm sorry\nthere's nothing I can do to help you you\ncan say well what about filling out\npaperwork to get on disability well I\ncan't do that because I'm sick I mean I\nthink you can fill out paperwork so\nlet's just understand you can't fill out\npaperwork and the result of that is that\nI have to spend eight hours a week\nworking additionally because you can't\nfill out forms I just want to make sure\nthat we're like clear that that's what's\ngoing on you can even turn to your dad\nor your brother and ask them about is\nthat what you all are seeing here and\nthen Dad or brother will say okay okay\nlike you can't blame her for that she's\nsick so it looks like Mom isn't going to\ncontribute at all what about her\nexpenses is there anything we can cut\nback on expenses what do you all think\nabout expenses so you've got to just\ntalk to people about the expectations\nlay it out this is what we spend this is\nwhat we get like what's the system here\nlet's call it what it is as judgment\nfree as you can chances are there's\ngoing to be a lot of guilt on their end\nso you're going to see all kinds of\nweird things like people will stop\nshowing up to the conversation and\nthings like that all kinds of stuff can\nhappen and that's where you got to talk\nto them and you can say look we need to\ntalk about finances I I don't know how\nelse to say this like how are y'all\nexpecting this to work you have to have\nthese kinds of conversations budgeting\nthings out asking people for their\nopinions about what they can contribute\nyour brother's like okay I'll start\ncollege like next year okay so like what\nare you gonna do in the meantime I'm\ngonna like are you gonna play video\ngames all day it's like fine I'll do\nwhatever you want I want to know what to\nexpect from you so don't fall into the\nTrap they're gonna try to trap you this\nway they're gonna be like I'll do\nwhatever you want fine tell us what to\ndo we'll do it anything to stop the\nconversation don't fall into the Trap\nbecause if you tell them to do something\nthey're not going to do it especially if\nyou're not willing to induce\nconsequences what they want to avoid is\nthe conversation and that's exactly what\nyou need to create you need to create\nthis Frame of the conversation and then\ndon't provide Solutions do as best as\nyou can to sit in that vacuum and pull\nthe solutions out of them ask your\nbrother just tell me what you're willing\nto do and then your brother's like fine\nI'll clean the kitchen and you're gonna\nsay okay what happens if you don't\nyou're like why you want to punish me no\nno I'm asking you like what's the\naccountability so you can't provide\nanswers to your family but you have to\nforce the conversation and you create a\nvacuum where all of y'all are working on\nthis together you're not the same you're\nnot the one with all the answers they\nneed to come up with the answers\nthemselves and you're going to do your\nbest to force the conversation so the\ngoal here is that you cannot I don't\nknow how to say this you cannot lift up\nyour family by yourself and what I see\nin situations like this is like people\nare trying to lift up the whole family\nI'm trying to get my mom to do stuff I'm\ntrying to get my brother to do stuff I'm\ntrying to get my dad to do stuff and not\nonly are they not listening to you\nthey're actively sabotaging your efforts\nnot intentionally but there's no\nresponsibility and then the less\nresponsibility you they take the more\nyou put on your shoulders and the more\nresponsibility you put on your shoulders\nthe more AFK they become right because\nlike if the Internet modem breaks your\nbrother who's like addicted to video\ngames like he doesn't have to worry\nabout getting it fixed or paying for it\nto be fixed because you're going to pay\nfor it to be fixed your dad who spends\nall day watching conspiracy theories if\nhe doesn't have the internet then like\nhow is he gonna watch conspiracy oh\nyou'll take care of that and so the goal\nhere is to have shared responsibility as\na family and even before we get that far\nthis is what's really hard about this is\nthese conversations have to have happen\nslowly and consistently where everyone\nwants to jump to Solutions and start\nmaking changes for one month no changes\njust talk and then what you'll notice is\nas you have the conversations over and\nover and over again a certain energy\nwill be pent up and then you pick a\nsmall thing you can say okay you're\ngonna clean the kitchen if you're not\ncleaning the kitchen what's what's the\nconsequence you're gonna ask your\nbrother you're not going to impose the\nconsequence you ask him so then if he's\nlike I don't know what do you think he'd\nsay okay I think it's really simple we\ncan just shut off internet access or\ntake the power cord away from your PC\nuntil things are cleaned what do you\nthink about that he's gonna hate it but\nyou'll get him into a corner and then\nyou can say okay when I do this when I\nshut off your internet access or when I\ntake away your power cord what are you\ngonna do or say ask him ahead of time\nright so you have to you have to get\npeople to voice their own consequences\nwhich then you as the leader may have to\nimpose and you want to ask him ahead of\ntime when you impose the consequences\nwhat are you what are you going to do\nare you giving me permission to do this\napplies for your whole family right and\nyou should be held they're going to get\nangry at you they're going to try to\nhold you accountable well what are you\ngonna do and if you want to be straight\nwith it you can say I will continue\nmaking it so that we aren't homeless\nthat's what I'm willing to contribute\nI'm going to give us a roof over our\nheads and if they're like that's not\nenough you can say like okay well maybe\nI can leave then I'm going to go ahead\nand move out good luck so that's where\nyou've got to be careful you don't want\nto make those kinds of threats unless\nyou're willing to follow up with them\nwhich this is it's not really a threat\nit's a boundary but and that's the kind\nof thing where if you're not emotionally\nready to do that don't do that the right\nway is to say okay like if I'm not\naccountable then this is what I'm\nwilling to sacrifice you can play that\ngame right it's okay like you have\nlimits that you you want to eat\nhealthier right so you can get your\nfamily to help you do that so that's\nnumber one I know it's a big number one\nbut it's essentially we have to have a\nconversation with our parents because\nyou cannot lift up a family all by\nyourself you absolutely need their help\nthey have to take some amount of shared\nresponsibility how do you do that by\nFraming a conversation about okay like\nwhat are we doing as a family like where\nis the ship headed let's all sit down\nand at least think about it and decide\nare we okay with this are we not okay\nwith this and you use the energy of\ntheir dissatisfaction to fuel whatever\nsmall steps you can right you ask them\nwhat are you unhappy with about the\nfamily what are you unhappy with about\nour Direction what are you unhappy with\nabout yourself and if your brother\nvolunteers I'm unhappy being overweight\nthen you can say okay what do we as a\nfamily want to do to help them with that\nhow can we help you it's not about power\nit's not about punishment it's not about\nindependence it's like you love your\nfamily you care about your family you\nall have shared problems and you need to\nwork on them mom is sick and can't do\nher paperwork well can you help Mom do\nthe paperwork what is the value of y'all\nsitting down and doing the paperwork it\nturns out to be let's say 500 bucks a\nmonth could we use 500 a month if you're\ntelling me that you can't do that and\nwhat it's costing us is six thousand\ndollars a year if this is not worth six\nthousand dollars a year to you to figure\nit out that's fine I guess there's\nnothing we can do about it and they're\ngonna say oh I don't know how to do it\nand you can say well I don't know how to\ndo it either I've never done this before\nmom is like I don't know how to do it\nit's confusing that's where you turn to\nthe family and you ask okay what is this\nis it worth six thousand dollars a year\nfor us to figure this out and then\nthey're gonna be like well yeah\nobviously it's like okay so then the two\nof you all figure it out why don't you\nall get started let's see how far we can\nget and then next week when we meet we\ncan talk a little bit about what kind of\nobstacles you're running into and maybe\ndad and I can help has to be shared\nresponsibility second thing to do if\nyou're in this situation explore your\nown emotions so this is really really\nreally important so if say I'm not\nwilling to abandon my family because I\ndon't want my mom I'm okay kind of\nabandoning my dad but it's like I don't\nwant my mom to be homeless this is\nreally tough but I would encourage you\nto really explore where is the line\nbetween Duty and where is guilt\nmotivating your action so the two are\nvery closely tied together right when I\ndon't do my duty I feel guilty but\nespecially in a situation where we know\nthere's emotional manipulation going on\nyou have to be very careful about guilt\nand people may ask okay how do I tell\nthe difference between healthy Duty and\nunhealthy guilt there's one really key\nthing that has to do you shouldn't feel\nguilty for anything that is not in your\npower so should you feel guilty for not\ndoing your duty absolutely but what is\nthe extent of your duty how how do we\ndraw the boundaries around your duty\nyour duty is what you can do it's not my\nduty it's a ridiculous duty to fix the\nEarth and solve climate change let's say\nbut what I can do is not litter so I can\nfeel guilty I emotions will irrational\nAll By Nature so I can feel guilty about\nall kinds of stuff but the question is\nwhat's truly in my power and that's what\nyou should really focus on that's how\nyou figure out okay can I force my\nbrother to stop playing video games can\nI force him to stop eating if the answer\nis no or I'm unwilling to if I'm\nunwilling to and then that's my fault I\ncan feel guilty for that that I'm not\nwilling to use my power that's fine you\ncan feel guilty about that but be very\nvery careful explore your guilt and\nreally ask yourself what am I willing to\ndo what can I truly control in this\nsituation now here's the other thing is\nas you do that exploration and as you\ntry number one which is sitting down\nwith your family and trying to create a\nsystem of shared responsibility\nsomething could happen very reasonable\nwhich is that you will fail\nspectacularly because here I am telling\nyou how to do things but to be honest\nwith families like this it takes years\nof professional experience to be able to\nnavigate these issues with families I\nsay this as a professional who does this\nwith families that are stuck and it's\nlike sitting down with them and trying\nto get them to figure out the chances of\nyou succeeding is an amateur sure who's\nwatching this thing once are very low\nand yet that's where we have to start\nthere's a certain amount of practice I'm\nnot saying it's going to be easy but it\nis the right move so then the question\nbecomes okay so like then what right so\nnow we're going to talk a little bit\nabout like what you can kind of do in\nthis situation if it doesn't work Dr K\nsays Okay meet sit sit down with them\none hour a week and talk about these\nkinds of things and talk about shared\nresponsibility and accountability and\nstuff like that that's great but they\ndon't even show up now what do I do and\nas you try these kinds of things and\nyour family puts in more and more and\nmore roadblocks you will begin to see\nthat I can't actually fix this for them\nyou will begin to see the futility of\nyour efforts you will begin to see that\nI can only do so much and I can't carry\nmy family to success they have to want\nto do something too as you come to that\nrealization do not push it away because\nthat is ultimately how are you you are\ngoing to conquer the guilt and\nconquering the guilt is going to be very\nvery important and once you start to\nwalk that road then you can start to\nreally think about okay what kind of\nfinancial what kind of limits am I\nwilling to set what kind of boundaries\nam I willing to enforce because in\ntrying to enforce a boundary when your\nfamily knows how to make you feel guilty\nis an exercise in futility not only is\nit an exercise in futility it's actually\nharmful it's better that you do nothing\nat all and then you may ask wait wait\nhold on a second that's crazy why would\nit be worse for me to try to set a\nboundary and fail as opposed to should I\neven try no here's why when you set a\nboundary and it is not enforced what are\nyou actually teaching your family what\nare you actually enforcing reinforcing\nyou're reinforcing the concept that your\nboundaries can be ignored you're\nteaching them the lesson that they don't\nhave to listen to you and this is a huge\nproblem that a lot of people get into is\nthat they'll arbitrarily start setting\nboundaries they'll be like if you don't\ndo this I'm not gonna buy pay for\ngroceries and then when time comes\naround and they're like I'm hungry and I\nhave nothing to eat the guilt gets\nbetter of you buy the groceries anyway\nbecause you're not going to let your mom\nstarve that's ridiculous she spent her\nlast money on cigarettes I'm not going\nto let her starve and and so what is\nyour mom actually learning she's\nlearning oh guilt is a useful tool to\nget what I want you're actually\nreinforcing manipulation you're teaching\nher how to be more manipulative because\nthe only thing that works is guilting\nyou and then you get the situation where\nyou're being guilted constantly by your\nfamily because you try to set a boundary\nand what you actually reinforce is that\nwhen they guilt you they get what they\nwant so it's best not to set the\nboundary at all so be prepared for\nwhatever kind of stick you want to\nenforce is it going to be money like you\nhave to like internally you've got to\ndecide what you're willing to do and\nwhat you're not willing to do people on\nthe internet will tell you oh just do\nthis don't pay for it if she buys\ncigarettes she doesn't get to eat that's\nnot your mom who's coughing well you're\neating a cheeseburger that you picked up\non the way home and your mom is like\nlooking at you because she hasn't eaten\nin 24 hours like the people on the\ninternet don't have to deal with that so\nyou've got to figure out what are you\nwilling to enforce and you may decide\nthis is very healthy that you're not\nwilling to enforce much that's just not\nwho you are or how you operate which is\ntotally fine but as you try to go down\nthis path what you will discover and\nthis is what's kind of challenging is\nthat one or two things will happen\neither they'll get on board they'll\naccept some shared responsibility and\nyour life will start moving in the right\ndirection fantastic or they won't and\nthen what can happen is I hope you are\nable to be more at peace about leaving\nthem because ultimately I think that's\nwhere things probably should go right\nyou can keep on rolling the dice until\nmom passes away or brother randomly gets\nthis crap together but at some point I\nthink this is the key thing is like we\ndon't want to abandon our family right\nwe don't want to give up on them there's\na huge difference if you feel guilty for\nabandoning your family there is one way\nto deal with that guilt a hundred\npercent and abandon them anyway the way\nto do that is to try everything that you\ncan do so that when you leave the home\nyou can leave knowing that I tried for\ntwo years to get these people to clean\nthe [ __ ] kitchen and they would not\neven do that much I tried so hard I\ntried everything in my power to try to\nmove my family in the right direction\nand they just turned me down at every\nturn and then you can leave and you can\nfeel okay about it you can be sad you\ncan be upset and this is where we've got\nto be really careful because shared\nresponsibility means shared\nresponsibility because if your mom ends\nup homeless whose fault is that you\nthink oh it's mine it's partially yours\nbut she wouldn't be homeless if she'd\nfill that paperwork she wouldn't be\nhomeless if your Dad decided to start\nworking she wouldn't be homeless if your\nbrother helped out by getting some job\nwhy are you accepting all the\nresponsibility because they give it to\nyou and you take it so the core of the\nproblem here is that as our family gives\nus more responsibility and we take it\nparadoxically we become more powerless\nbecause they give you the responsibility\nbut they don't give you the power they\nwon't actually listen to what you say\nthey won't let you restrict how many\ncigarettes she buys but they will\nabsolutely make you responsible for\nbeing able to afford food when your mom\nbuys too many cigarettes so power and\nresponsibility have to go hand in hand\nand as you give your family the fairest\npossible shot you can as you learn how\nto talk to them and give them every\nopportunity and if they fail you time\nand time and time and time again we move\non to point number three which is that\nunfortunately you probably have to go\nand you say but they will be homeless\nwell it's kind of interesting right\nbecause as long as you're protecting\nthem from homeless they don't have to\nget their [ __ ] together that's the other\nproblem is that by supporting all this\nbad behavior you're actually allowing\nthem to not take responsibility and\nyou'd be surprised at what human beings\nare capable of when they're given\nresponsibility you're supporting them\nright if you move out of the house\nthere's a decent chance your younger\nbrother will actually step up there's a\ndecent chance that after a long time is\nyou have these conversations with Mom\nyou can say look at some point I'm not\ngoing to be able to do this anymore so\nif you want to fill out that paperwork I\nthink that would be a really good idea\nit'll help out the family a lot it'll\nhelp me out a lot if you're unable\nunwilling to do it I can't do it what do\nyou mean you can't do it what are the\nsteps you've tried I don't know where to\nstart how do you figure out where you\nstart right you've got to be like like\nbreak it down into steps she may not\nknow how to do it so what do we do when\nwe don't know something how do we\napproach that I don't know how to do it\neither she's like I need your help I've\nnever done it before how are you\nimagining that I'm going to figure out\nbecause I've never done it before well\nyou're good at figuring things out yeah\nthat's and why aren't you good at\nfiguring things out I don't know it's\nconfusing I think maybe the reason\nyou're not good at figuring things out\nis because anytime you struggle with\nsomething you dump it on me and then I\nlearn how to figure it out because\nsomeone's got to and then the more that\nyou leave me to figure things out the\nbetter I get at it and the less of it\nyou do this isn't fair to me you need to\nstart taking some responsibility tell me\nwhatever you can figure out and younger\nbrother can you help and if none of that\ncrap works we get to Point number three\nbecause it's really hard to understand\nthis when you're in the situation but\nyou have a life so easy to forget it's\nnot about being a good son or a bad son\nor doing your duty or whatever your mom\nhas a few years left to live your dad\nafter that will be whatever your brother\nafter that will be whatever and so the\nquestion is you're 26 years old right\nnow when you're 28 when you're not 29\nwhen you're 30. what then you have a\nlife after them so the question is what\ndo you want to put in place for that or\nyou can just put your life on hold not\nlearn anything about yourself and get\ndry around and not build up you know\nthis person wants to like go to concerts\nand they want to meet friends and it's\nhard for them to date like let's say\nthat your mom lives for another five\nyears because we don't want her to pass\naway by any means and now you're 31 and\nyou haven't dated for a decade this is\nthe other thing to understand is that\nit's fine to make sacrifices for your\nfamily like I'm a huge fan of that in\ntheory just understand what you're doing\nand where it's going right so this is my\nway of sitting down with you and asking\nyou let's think about this think for a\nsecond what is this doing to your life\nand then you could say well like it's\nlike sacrificing my life so that's a\ngood thing right sacrificing your life\nfor the sake of your family is only a\ngood thing if it actually helps them\nsacrificing your life to keep them\nbarely afloat while they continue to\nengage in unhealthy behavior and you\nenable their negativity and then y'all\nyou end up drowning with them you can\njump onto a drowning boat and start\nbailing the water but the point of\njumping onto Browning drowning boat and\nbailing water is if everyone's bailing\nand you can save the boat jumping on\njust to drown with them is not worth it\nshould you sacrifice your site life for\nthe sake of another yes absolutely but\nonly if it were it's worth it this is\nwhat you'll learn as you try to help\nthem is you'll see whether they're\nwilling to accept the help or not\nwhether they're willing to do their part\nbecause I hate to break it to you but\nyou cannot fix a life that is not yours\nthey have to take some responsibility\nit's at the end of the day in many of\nthese situations I do think the right\nmove is moving out but we can't jump\nstraight to moving out because that's\nabandonment you got to give it\neverything you can and once you give it\neverything that you can then you'll\nstart to realize internally this is just\nnot gonna I can stay but it's not worth\nit it doesn't actually help them and\nthat's a conversation that you have with\nthem as well right this is not the stick\nif that doesn't feel right to you like\nI'm gonna threaten with moving out and\nthen you all are going to be homeless\nnow what you can say is look for three\nmonths I've been trying to get you all\nto sit down and talk about this stuff\nand give direction to our life because\nwe're drowning here we're in a\nfinancially desperate situation people\nare sick this guy's 300 pounds I'm 250\npounds we're barely making ends meet I\ncan't save anything even though I'm\nworking my ass off and for three months\nI've tried to get all four of you all\nfour of us in a room for one hour a week\nand we can't even do that much I just\nwant to let you all know I'm going to\nstart looking at other places to move\nout it'll probably take me a couple\nmonths I'm going to start looking for\njobs here because I can't fix this\nfamily on on my own I just can't do it\nand they can say okay but tell us what\nyou want us to do and this is where you\ngotta I'm gonna teach y'all some\ntechniques turn it around them I've been\nsaying what I want you all to do what\nhave y'all heard I've been saying it for\nthe last three months don't answer the\nquestion then ask them I don't know tell\nus now and then you say this is the Crux\nof the problem is for months and months\nand months I've been speaking and no\none's been listening and that's why I'm\nleaving no tell us I promise we'll do\nsomething okay so here's what I want you\nto do over the course of the next week I\nwant someone in this household to take\nresponsibility for getting all four of\nus in a room for one hour together does\nthat mean that you're not gonna leave no\nI may still leave I'm telling you all\nthat I've been trying this it's not work\nbut if other people start taking\nresponsibility if things start moving in\nthe right direction I may consider\nstaying let them take their\nresponsibility and then it's up to them\nthey're like oh [ __ ] and if they decide\nto get together and then you're going to\nleave it to them say okay let's try this\none more time but you yourself should\nnot change your behavior and even if\nthey start doing everything right and\nyou find a job and you have an\nopportunity to to move out that's where\nthings become really tricky because if\nyou decide to sacrifice yourself for\ntheir sake you could see now that the\nthreat is gone all of the bad behaviors\nwill return so as best as you can I\nthink the right thing to do is even move\nout then say hey I'm really happy that\ny'all are putting your life together I'm\nstill moving out because you all just\nstarted this if I take that off the\ntable that's it seems like what really\nmotivated y'all is the fear of me moving\nout so once that fear goes away I'm\nafraid that all the bad behaviors will\nreturn no they won't okay great so I'm\ngonna move out let's see if y'all can\nstay on top of the stuff I'm happy to\nsend some money from time to time to\nhelp you all pay for expenses having a\nfamily that doesn't that doesn't do\ntheir fair share and we love our family\nright so we talk about how I'm drowning\ntrying to take care of my family and\nwhen we share our troubles with the\ninternet that the internet tells us\nabandon them easy for them to say\nthey're not the ones doing the\nabandoning many of them actually have\nright they say that's what I had to do\nand it worked out great for me and so I\nthink that sometimes moving on from your\nfamily is the right move because you\ncan't make them do anything but if\nyou're feeling guilty and feel like you\ncan't abandon them I think you should\nmake every effort to put them on the\nright path and then if you do decide to\nleave you can do so with a clear\nconscience because you gave it 18 months\nof dedicated effort and not only did\nthey not help they threw up whatever\nroadblocks they could and so this is not\na solvable problem and so sacrificing\nyour safe yourself for the sake of your\nfamily worth it only if it helps them\notherwise it's just stupid so Tony\ngrundle is asking I feel like everyone\nelse around me is drowning friends\nfamily I'm highly empathetic and it's\nstarting to affect me how do I\ndisconnect from it so a couple of things\nto remember\nthe first is that if you're a highly\nempathic person the simplest way to\ncontrol what comes into you is through\nyour indaryas or your sense organs so\nthere's stuff about this in the current\nguy that's coming out now in seven days\nhas a lot of stuff about the Andreas but\nit's just to realize that if you're\nempathetic and you're around people\nyou're going to do some of that\nabsorption so that's one thing to\nunderstand second thing to understand is\nthat there are some techniques so\ngenerally speaking like I think Nadi\nshould be or cleansing broniums can be\nreally good for like processing negative\nemotions as well as money border chakra\npractices that's not really\nscientifically valid by the way but in\nmy experience both as a clinician and as\na meditation teacher I think those help\nbut at the end of it like you know\ndisconnecting starts with the sense\norgans so if you're still spending time\nwith these people you need to be a\nlittle bit intentional about that what's\nthe right amount of time that I can\nhandle I'm at fasium is asking going by\nthe same vein of what can you do to\nimprove your life when others are\nsabotaging you what advice would you\ngive to people with health issues or\ndisabilities and without external\nsupport systems that are trapped in\nabusive situations and want to leave but\nare financially dependent on the person\nthey're trapped with so that's a really\nchallenging situation unfortunately far\ntoo common so I'd say three things the\nfirst thing is that if the situation is\nthat you're financially trapped by an\nabusive person the goal is to get\nfinancially not trapped right it's sort\nof like what advice would you give to\nsomeone who's starving I'd say eat now\nthis is where things get really tricky\nbecause a lot of people will say like\nwell I can't eat right if I could eat I\nwould obviously duh if I could become\nfinancially independent I would and\nthat's where it's unfortunate but what\nI've seen Time and Time and Again by\npeople who are trapped in abusive\nsituations is that the abuser makes you\nthink that you cannot be independent\nthat's their abuse tactic 101 is make\npeople feel like they're trapped so\noftentimes what you'll find is that\npeople are not nearly as trapped as they\nthink they are which is staggering right\nyou're like of course I'm trapped I'm\ndisabled there are support systems for\ndisabled people with disabilities\nthey're they're subsidized housing\nthere's all kinds of stuff out there but\nthe whole point about by the abuser is\nthat they've trained you to think that\nyou're completely powerless so you have\nto be a little bit critical of that and\nsee what kind of financial opportunities\nare available I'm not saying they are\nnecessarily but it's worth revisiting\nthe issue before accepting the\nconclusion is what I'm saying second\nthing is as you're working that stuff\nyou have to understand that a certain\namount of the effect of abuse is your\nresponse to it so there may be some\nthings that you can do or say but a lot\nof it is going to be like internal\nstrength so that's sort of like even\nmeditative practices or things like that\ncan like help in terms of like purifying\nand like letting things go and stuff\nlike that I mean it's challenging you\ncan also look at doctrines like stoicism\nand things like that to try to resist\nthe impact of it but it's really tough\num the other thing that I would say very\nconcretely is even if you don't know\nwhat to do and you feel like you're\nyou're stuck in an abusive situation\nthere may be other people out there who\nare willing to help you it's just about\ngetting access to those and so how do\nyou do that that's where it's like kind\nof depends on where you live and what's\ngoing on and stuff like that but\noftentimes there are resources right so\nMental Health Centers things like that\nsocial workers can help you find housing\nhelp you apply for Grants and and get\ndisability payments and all that kind of\nstuff so there's like their resources\nout there depending on where you live\nand what your situation is that people\nmay be able to help you figure it out so\nI'd say the last thing is ask for help\nmaybe not to your abuser but to someone\nelse"
