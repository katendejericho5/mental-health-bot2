oatmeal and then do\nintermittent fasting for the next 16\nhours like you can intellectually know\nthat so if we think about what EQ is it\nis the ability to recognize and become\naware of what your internal emotional\nstate is\nto be able to communicate that internal\nemotional state to be able to regulate\nthat internal emotional state and most\nimportantly to not let that internal\nemotional state impact your behavior so\nTech teller and our mods in our\ncommunity folks have put together yet\nanother epic Community event and I\nreally really really like this one\nso this one is called right in the\nfields and so for the next six weeks\nwhat we're going to be doing is learning\nabout and talking about emotions\nso it's our belief that the mechanism of\nchange that we create in this community\nis actually through EQ or emotional\nquotient\nso many years ago someone realized that\nthere's a general intellectual or\nanalytical capability which IQ which\nsort of governs your ability to like\nproblem solve stuff\nand so we did a bunch of studying on IQ\nwhich is essentially a reasoning\ncapabilities our analytical capabilities\nand what we discovered was that you know\nthere's this thing called IQ and that it\ndetermines how successful or\nunsuccessful you are in some ways\nbecause oftentimes people with IQ run\ninto problems and we'll get into that in\na second\nso many many years later we sort of\ndiscovered hey there's like a whole\nportion of the brain that is not related\nto IQ which influences things like\nmotivation and behavior because\nintellect does not have anything to do\nwith motivation you can logically know\nthat you should get out of bed at 7am\nevery morning exercise for an hour eat a\nbowl of oatmeal and then do intermittent\nfasting for the next 16 hours like you\ncan intellectually know that\nand so what we sort of discovered over\nthe last 30 years is that intellect is\ninsufficient at making people successful\nand we see those people oftentimes in\nour communities are people who are very\nvery smart but like can't live up to\ntheir potential\nand so as researchers we're kind of\nlooking into this what they discovered\nis is what we now call EQ so if we think\nabout what EQ is it is the ability to\nrecognize and become aware of what your\ninternal emotional state is\nto be able to communicate that internal\nemotional state to be able to regulate\nthat internal emotional state and most\nimportantly to not let that internal\nemotional state impact your behavior\nso what we tend to see when people are\nemotionally numb so we'll use terms like\nalexithymia or things like that there's\nalso Neuroscience research on addiction\nthat shows that people who are\nvulnerable to addiction are more unaware\nof their internal emotional state so a\ngood example of this is when I work with\npatients they'll say yeah everything was\ngoing great for a year and then I don't\nknow what happened I relapsed\nand the more that I work with people\nlike that and the more that we talk\nabout it what we discover is that there\nwas stressor after stressor after\nstressor it wasn't actually RNG it was\nthere's stuff piling up that the person\nwas unaware of\nand so as we become unaware of our\nemotions they start to bleed into other\nparts of our life so they can manifest\nas like all kinds of different things\nlike they can Manifest this jealousy but\nwe don't even realize it right we're\nkind of like yeah I don't want to go\nthere why I don't know it's just not for\nme so we use a lot of this vague\nlanguage that actually like controls our\nlife\nyeah I'm just not a gym person\nyeah like\nthat's just not for me so we'll like use\nall this vague language but it's\nactually emotional unawareness\nand what we've actually discovered is\nthat by gaining awareness of our\nemotions then we start to get to\nregulate them\nright and so what happened with me I was\ncompletely emotionally unaware and so I\nwould wake up every day and I would be\nlike yeah I don't feel like going to\nclass let me start playing video games\nand I play video games for 14 hours 16\nhours and then I'd pass out\nand like I didn't realize that I was\navoiding I was afraid I was ashamed and\nthat all of these emotions are\ncontrolling my life Not only was I not\naware of them I didn't know how to\nregulate them and I certainly couldn't\nkeep them from controlling me\nso those are the different EQ domains\nthat that have kind of been discovered\nand that we sort of work on\nwe also measure outcomes in our coaching\nprogram for example in terms of EQ\nand so over the next six weeks what\nwe're going to try to do is just equip\nyou all with like information and\nknowledge and understanding of emotions\nnow this is a Community Driven event\nwhich means that it's not just streams\nand like Dr K lecturing about stuff\nthere's going to be that too so we've\ngot a lot of really good emotional\ntopics\num like talking about emotional\navailability in relationships and and\nthings like that but also like really\nfundamental stuff like why do we have\nemotions but the really cool thing is\nthat\nlistening to lectures about emotions\ndoesn't necessarily boost your EQ\nwhat we're hoping for is that there's a\nbunch of stuff that we're going to do on\nour Discord and things that y'all can\nget involved in in a community kind of\nway so I'm going to just share some of\nthat stuff with you right now okay\nso\num there's what we're going to ask\npeople to do is to like do different\nthings like track your emotions write\njournal entries reflect on your emotions\nengage in empathy building exercises and\ndo emotional regulation techniques so\nwe're going to Target like all of that\nstuff in a very Hands-On kind of way\num y'all can log on to\nfeels.healthygamer.gg to participate\nuh journal entries by the way are\ncompletely anonymous\nand then each week also on the Discord\nwe're going to have an ask a coach event\nabout particular emotions so each week\nwe're going to cover emotions like shame\nfear anger sadness boredom and happiness\nso we're not going to cover all of them\neach week but once a week we're going to\ngo through different emotions and if you\nall have questions and and kind of want\nto explore that in a more interactive\nway there's ask a coach\num and then we've also got a couple of\ncool exercises so there's reflection\ncorner where you get shown a previous\njournal entry and then you reflect on it\nso like this is where we don't really\nget taught this stuff right but you can\nwrite a journal entry and then\nreflecting on your journal entry is\nactually where the money is it's kind of\nlike if I want to get better at a video\ngame I can PL I can grind 20 hours but\nit's probably better for me to climb if\nI play 10 hours and then watch my\nreplays for 10 hours right that's when I\nactually get to see my mistakes and\nlearn and grow so we've got that going\non there's also empathy Labs which I\nthink sounds very very cool so that's\nwhere we're going to anonymously show a\njournal entry and then we're gonna try\nto level up our empathy so as we read a\npassage what do you imagine that person\nis feeling\nright so this is where we like literally\nlike if you think about how do you train\nempathy well let's take a look at a\npassage and see if we can figure out\nwhat that person might be feeling\nand then we'll also we're also going to\nteach you all practical techniques like\nmeditations and other kinds of emotional\nregulation techniques\nso I'm super super\num excited about this because I think\nthat\nthe more that we're growing the more\nwe're able to do more stuff so it's cool\nthat we've got coaching that's for\npeople who are really willing to make a\ncommitment of time and energy to make a\nsignificant change over their life over\nlike let's say a 12-week span\nthat's kind of like for people who are\nwho are very very interested and\nmotivated to make change then we've got\npeople who log into stream or you know\nwatch stream or watch YouTube or\nwhatever participate in some way and\nit's not like those people aren't\ninterested in making a change too and\nwe've absolutely got something for\npeople who are like ah like I want to\nlearn stuff I want to grow I want to\nimprove but I've got a 45 minute drive\neach way to work and like that's the\ntime willing the amount of time that I'm\nwilling to devote totally fine we're\nhere for you\nwhat we're discovering is that there's\nsomething in the middle\nwhich is okay I'm not sure that coaching\nis for me but I want more than just to\nlisten I want to start to like be able\nto change I want to start journaling I\nwant to start reflecting I want to start\nacquiring some skills and for that group\nthat's really where I think these\ncommunity events are really powerful\nour touchgrass event for example was\nreally fantastic because it was all\nfocused on getting y'all to go out and\nactually build something in your lives\nright so go out and meditate go out and\npick a piece of fresh fruit you know go\nfor a walk go hiking go look at nature\ngo and do the things that we say you\nshould do and now we're going to really\nstart with with emotions so we're going\nto dive over the next six weeks I\nencourage all y'all to kind of tune in\nfor all of this stuff\nboth the lectures that we do on stream\nthe events that we have on Discord and\nparticipate in your own way and my hope\nis that\nat the end of the six weeks\nwill have seen a significant portion of\nour community have more emotional\nawareness more emotional regulation and\nmore control over their lives because\ntheir emotions are no longer controlling\nthem that's really the goal and the\nquestion is can we actually make a\nsignificant statistical impact oh a 10\nchange is astronomical so wise guy 315\nGreat point 10 percent change is\nastronomical so I want you all to think\nabout this so EQ is more like IQ\nright a 10 change in your IQ is unheard\nof\nlike things don't boost your IQ by that\nmuch that's what's really interesting\nabout it so you don't even need even a\n10 improve a 10 Improvement is a huge\noutcome\nright so you can think about like\nthere's some situations where 10\nImprovement is huge so for I were to say\nhey this is going to increase your\nlifespan by 10 that is wild\nso you all have to remember that when it\ncomes to Scientific measurement some\nthings 10 seem small but is actually\ngigantic like a 10 Improvement in your\nincome is could be transformative\nso with this EQ stuff what we tend to\nsee is that that the other thing that's\nreally interesting is that small\nimprovements appear to be correlated\nwith large changes in external life\nso even a five percent Improvement in EQ\nfor example or like five to ten percent\nImprovement in EQ is correlated with a\n50 plus percent or anywhere between 40\nand 60 Improvement in confidence in\nliving your life is that is that is that\nwild\nlike that's not that's sort of an\namalgamation of statistics and stuff\nthat I've read so what's really\ninteresting is a small bump in EQ can be\ncorrelated with large changes in other\ndomains\nforeign"
