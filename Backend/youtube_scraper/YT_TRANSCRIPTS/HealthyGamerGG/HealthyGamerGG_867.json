    "transcript": "so what we're sort of noticing is that\nthere are traditional masculine\ncharacteristics which as Society evolves\nas technology evolves some of those\ncharacteristics are no longer sort of\nnecessary for men so the there's been a\ndiffusion of responsibility there's been\na growth of independence of both genders\nDr K what is healthy masculinity I think\nsocial media right now is being flooded\nwith unhealthy masculinity specifically\nYouTube shorts and Tick Tock I would\nreally like a video for young men that\nexplains what healthy masculinity is\nsecond to that Dr K's Community what do\nyou think healthy masculinity looks like\nslash is so let's actually start with\nthis what do you all think constitutes\nhealthy masculinity what do you all\nthink is healthy so we we have Assassin\nllama 23 saying I'd say read meditations\nof Marcus Aurelius to learn what healthy\nmasculinity is okay so one of the most\nfamous stoics being based it's hard to\nexplain it's subjective beating people\nup deadlifting pizzas\nstoicism and chivalry discipline\nstrength and courage strength and\nself-control healthy ego being\nDependable being one with your emotions\nBros supporting Bros stoicism\nresponsibility protective and kind you\nknow be secure in your identity being\nAlpha and Wrecking betas Just Being\nHuman T pose without fear body Health\ncourage strength responsible being a\nprovider bravely accepting weakness\nbring back chivalry provision\nresponsibility resilience considerate\nleadership being pragmatic leadership\nand composure following your dreams\nconfidence responsibility high\ntestosterone all great all great\npossibilities right being top-ranked in\nLeague of Legends so I'm going to share\nsome thoughts today about what I\nconsider healthy masculinity but before\nwe even get into that I think we need to\nunderstand historically what masculinity\nis and what's going on right now that\nhas essentially caused somewhat of a\ncrisis within masculinity let's start\nwith like and this is going to be\nlargely the source is of the information\nthat I'm going to share are largely\ngoing to be my own kind of personal\nexperience anecdotal observations and\nclinical experience a lot of what I'm\ngoing to be sharing is not actually\ngoing to come from peer-reviewed studies\nso that's kind of like a big disclaimer\nat the beginning but I will share some\nreally interesting data from here to\nsupport a couple of points but generally\nspeaking the thesis of this is based on\nDr K's experience as opposed to you know\nlike tons of well-established studies so\nlet's start with like historically what\nmasculinity was and I sort of would\nbreak this down into masculinity\ntraditionally was the three PS so being\na protector being a provider and being a\npatriarch so if we look at like\nanthropology in the study of like human\ncivilization over time what we tend to\nfind is that most cultures were very\nvery tribal right so it's like a group\nof people and because cultures were\ntribal and we had a bunch of people we\nhad a division of labor or maybe the\nother way around the necessity of\ndivision of labor like so there were\nhunting skills and then there's like you\nknow turning milk into cheese and butter\nand things like that there was there was\nsuch a there was so much labor intensity\nthat humans basically had to band\ntogether to be able to get everything\ndone and the human beings that were able\nto band together to get everything done\nthe ones that were able to maintain for\nexample dairy cows and farmland and go\nout hunting those were the ones who\nessentially like performed the best\nright so there was an evolutionary\nAdvantage for a division of labor and so\nthings basically broke apart along\ngender lines and whether that's sort of\nlike scientifically a good idea or bad\nidea I can't really comment on that\nthat's just sort of what we observe\nright and so what men were traditionally\nresponsible for is protection so even\ntoday for example in the United States\nmilitary if you're a man you can get\ndrafted if you're a woman you can't I'm\nnot trying to turn this into a\ndiscussion about men's rights versus\nwomen's rights or whatever I'm just\nsaying that this is sort of a legacy of\nwhat historically has been a\nresponsibility of men is to be\nprotectors so Warriors people who fought\nin in bad models things like that have\nhistorically been men the next thing is\nto be providers so there's sort of this\nidea that especially if you go back a\nhundred years ago you know there's sort\nof like there are these very traditional\ngender roles where like women sort of\nstay in the household and men go out and\nthey earn and so maybe about a hundred\nyears ago you had a lot of households\nthat were single income earners okay\nmaybe 60 years ago 70 years ago and so\nthat sort of worked back then so men\nwere so have traditionally been\nproviders they used to go hunt then they\nwould like earn money right once we\nmoved to a money-based economy and so\nthat's sort of like a general idea is\nlike a man provides for their family and\nthis is where I I'd love to share kind\nof an interesting experience I had as a\nclinician so I was working in a jail and\nthere was a 18 year old kid there and we\nwere talking a little bit about how they\nended up in jail and things like that\nand he sort of he was in jail again for\nselling drugs and when I sort of talked\nto him a little bit about like you know\nwhat's up with that how did you get into\nselling drugs why do you sell drugs what\ndoes it do for you and his primary\nreason for for selling drugs at least is\nhow he explained it to me is that well\nlike I have two older sisters and\nthey've like told me ever since I was a\nyoung age that a man provides and so\nlike I have to provide for them so like\nand the only way that I can kind of do\nthat or the only way I can figure out\nhow to do that is through selling drugs\nnow I'm not saying sharing this story is\nsort of an indictment of women and maybe\nhis older sisters weren't the nicest\npeople maybe he could have been lying\nthat could have been his perception I'm\nnot trying to make an overall uh comment\non men good men women I mean men victims\nwomen bad what I'm pointing out is that\ntraditionally what we sort of seen is\nthat men feel the responsibility to\nprovide okay whether that's right or\nwrong we'll get to that in a second the\nthird thing is that men have\ntraditionally been Patriarchs so what\ndoes that sort of mean that means that\nin a lot of societies the the family\nunit is patriarchal which means sort of\nthe man makes decisions is head of the\nhousehold Etc I think some of those\nmasculine ideals are more about\num being leaders right so like offering\nguidance and wisdom and things like that\nand so these were sort of traditional\ngender roles as me as a lay person I'm\nnot saying these are factually accurate\nthis is just like I was trying to figure\nout when I saw this question okay like\nwhat did when I grew up what were sort\nof the ideals of manhood that I\nexperienced and furthermore seemed to be\nconsistent with the other men that I've\nworked with both clinically as well as\nlike you know in my social life and\nthings like that and this is sort of\nwhat I could come up with right so\nmanner of providers they're protectors\nand they're Patriarchs and so what's\nhappened over the last let's say 20\nyears 50 years 500 years a thousand\nyears so the first big thing that's\nhappened is that we've know we've become\nas human beings more independent so we\nused to be like you know tribes that\nrequired a division of labor for\neverything to function but as technology\nhas improved we've no longer needed to\nbe quite as dependent on each other so\nyou know let's say 500 years ago there\nmay have been like one cooking pot for\nthe whole village and everyone goes out\nfor forages we all get together we make\neverything together and we sort of like\nspread the resources share the wealth\nand whatnot as technology improves we no\nlonger need to do that right so I no\nlonger need to milk my own cows I no\nlonger need to churn my own butter I no\nlonger need to bake my own bread I can\ngo to a grocery store I can just get all\nthose things I have things like a stove\nright so I don't need to start a fire I\nhave an oven I have this thing called a\nmicrowave so I actually don't like you\ncan completely subsist off of freezers\nand microwavable food you know you don't\nneed any kind of specialized labor to be\nable to eat anymore so what we're sort\nof seeing is that as human beings become\nmore independent they're becoming less\ncommunal and as we become less communal\nsome of those traditional gender roles\nor like kind of Labor divisions across\nthe community the family unit whatever\nhave sort of become less important\nbecause we don't really need to do those\nthings anymore and things have become so\nindependent right so and then 50 60\nyears ago we had a lot of gender\nequality there have been his\nhistorically gender equality throughout\nyou know the majority of human history\nand so as we're sort of moving more\ntowards equality between all people\nwe're sort of seeing a systemic shift in\nterms of what men are doing in terms of\nwhat women are doing and I think\ngenerally speaking that's really really\ngood right so as we're sort of getting\nequality between the genders what's sort\nof almost happening is there's a crisis\nof gender roles so even if you look at\nand this isn't just for masculinity\nthere's a lot of change and morphing in\nterms of like what it means to be a\nwoman right so for a while what it meant\nto be a woman was to be a homemaker and\nthat's what we defined as femininity and\nthen what happened is like people women\nbecame more independent we sort of\nchanged the way we sort of conceptualize\nfemininity I'm not saying that\nfemininity is is perfect by any means\nI'm not saying that there aren't toxic\nvariants of that as well but there's\nbeen sort of like a Revival of what it\nmeans to be a woman and so then at this\npoint I think actually it's in a pretty\ngood place where I'm sort of happy\num that we live in a society where for\nthe most part a woman I hope this is\ntrue if this isn't true please educate\nme but this is what I think would be a\nwonderful Target is that you know a\nwoman can essentially decide like okay\nif I want to be a homemaker that's just\nas laudable as having a career and that\nit's not like we're valuing one over the\nother now I think what's what what's\nkind of interesting is as we have this\nkind of equality that's growing as we're\nseeing more Independence we're starting\nto see certain challenges for people who\nhold traditional masculine roles so the\nfirst thing that's happening I think\nthis is purely economic is that the\nnumber of single income households is\ndecreasing so this is like it's a huge\nproblem because now essentially if you\nwant to survive many people have to be\ndual income households because you just\ncan't support a family you can't buy a\nhouse go on vacation and raise two kids\nwith a single salary now why this could\nbe affecting men disproportionately is\nbecause I think that if you actually\nlook at research and this is where we're\ngoing to cite a particular an\ninteresting study is that men I don't\nthink even though it's harder to be a\nsolo provider as a man I don't think\nthat societal attitudes have kept up\nwith the changes inequality so what I\nmean by that is that as things have\nbecome more equal I think we've we\nhaven't started to judge men in the same\nway so we we sort of linger with older\njudgments towards men even though men\nare trying to exist in a society where\nlike what the responsibilities of a man\nare are no longer like as capable to be\nable to be done if that sort of makes\nsense maybe a simpler way to put that is\nwe still expect men to be men in a\nsociety where it's becoming increasingly\ndifficult to do so I.E being a single\nyou know single uh income earner so a\ngood example of this is actually if you\nkind of look at attitudes towards dating\nand dating men in terms of like what\npeople prefer so the the really\ninteresting thing is that 80 percent of\npeople will say that a man should be\nable to provide for the household now\nbefore we start like bashing women oh my\nGod like women women I'm this is society\nas a whole it's the other really\ninteresting thing to understand about\ndamaging gender attitudes and this is\ntrue I think of both men and women is\nthat a lot of the damaging attitudes\ntowards men or women are actually\nperpetrated by men and women so I've\nalso another piece of anecdotal\nexperience I've done some work in\nfinance and the really interesting thing\nis that I've worked with a lot of women\nin finance and women in finance are are\ntreated very very harshly for getting\npregnant so there's almost this unspoken\nrule which thankfully is changing and\nthis could be a slice of my experience\nbut if you're a woman in finance I'd be\nreally surprised to hear that you don't\nknow what I'm talking about but\nessentially like what women are told is\nthat like you can't have a kid until you\nget to a certain level professionally\nlike the earliest you could potentially\nhave a kid is 32 and the Really\nfascinating thing is that this kind of\nfeedback about when women can have\nchildren does not usually come for men\nit actually usually comes from women at\nleast in terms of my experience of\nworking with women in finance so this is\nwhat happens like you join an investment\nbank or a private Equity Firm it's 80\nmen and 20 women so the powers that be\ndecide right oh like here is a woman so\nlet's do this let's set up a mentor who\nis the other woman in our company and so\nwe oftentimes see very like intentional\nMentor mentee relationships created\nbetween women and finance and then what\nhappens is that your Mentor who's like\nin their mid-40s takes you out to lunch\nand says oh by the way like you know\nthey'll sort of have these kinds of\nconversations they'll say Hey you know\nit's really not a good idea you'd be\ndestroying your career if you decided to\nhave a baby at the age of 25 or 26 I had\nto wait until I had my first kid at 36\nand since I had to do it you have to do\nit too and so it's kind of interesting\nbecause what we're starting to see is\nthat like a lot of these attitudes that\nare actually perpetrated are actually\nperpetrated by the gender themselves and\nthis isn't about sort of men versus\nwomen and especially if you look at the\nidea of being financially independent\nmen feel that way just as strongly as\nwomen do now in terms of dating\npreferences we also tend to see that\nwhile uh that there most people really\nexpect men to be able to like run a\nhousehold and that's where you know if\nyou're if you take issue with that I\nwould encourage you to sort of think\nabout that for a little bit right so if\nyou're a man and you take issue with\nthat think a little bit about how okay\nare you could you feel healthy about\nyourself could you be proud of yourself\nif you were a stay-at-home dad or do you\nfeel like some amount of your value as a\nhuman being your value as a man comes\nfrom being financially independent and\nbeing able to take care of a household\nif you're a woman and you say oh that's\nreally unfair you know that's not an\nissue we're not like that so we can't\ngeneralize all women first of all and\nthe second thing is I would encourage\nyou to look around not only in terms of\nyour own relationships but if you are in\na committed long-term relationship you\nknow what is the how much money does\nyour partner earn assuming they're a man\nand also look around at your Social\nCircle and look at what are you know in\nterms of like who your female friends\nhave decided to date how much how many\nof them are as we put at deadbeat men\nversus men who have careers and make\nmoney and things like that so I\nencourage you all to just like look at\nthis right we're not saying that\nsomething is necessarily good or bad\nwe're just trying to understand the\nhistorical perspective of how we got\nhere so I think part of what we're sort\nof seeing and this is what leads to a\ncrisis of masculinity is that men are\nwe're expecting particular things for\nmen it's becoming harder and harder for\nmen to fulfill those things and then\nwhat happens is we have this over\ncompensation in other masculine\ncharacteristics so since I can't support\na household just by my solo income which\nis probably due to inflation more than\nanything else then what's going to\nhappen is I have to like my masculinity\nleans into other aspects right so we'll\nhave like these very very like overt\nmasculine forms because we can't like\ncheck some of the boxes I don't know how\nto be a patriarch I can't be a provider\nso like I'm gonna lean into being a\nprotector right so you'll you'll see a\nlot of like very kind of like aggressive\naggressiveness amongst men and what I've\nsort of noticed is that the hypertrophy\nof masculine characteristics whether\nit's hypersexuality you know dominance\nkind of language like even in terms of\nappearance the more hypertrophic of\nparticular masculine characteristics\nthere are I've seen an overwhelming\namount of insecurity about other\nmasculine characteristics and so it's\nlike the more Macho of a man I become\nthat relates to my insecurity in other\ndimensions I don't know if I'm ever\ngoing to be able to provide I don't know\nif I'm ever going to be able to be a\npatriarch I don't know if I can be a\nprotector and so almost to compensate\nfor that what I tend to do is inflate\nother aspects of masculinity and this is\nwhere I think a lot of men are\nstruggling because there are other kinds\nof systemic make issues at play so for\nexample about one out of four households\nis a single parent household about\neighty percent of single parent\nhouseholds at least in the United States\nare women and so what we're also sort of\nseeing is as we've seen by the way the\ntrend is increasing in terms of single\nparent households I think in 2007 it was\nmaybe 12 in 2017 it was maybe 16 so it's\nkind of going up in terms of like the\nnumber of single-parent households and\nso what we're sort of seeing I think is\nalso a lack of of healthy role models\nfor men right so as we're sort of seeing\nmore and more men not having healthy\nmale role models who can teach them what\nhealthy masculinity is and we'll get to\nthat in a second what we sort of end up\nwith is people who are trying to figure\nit out on their own and as we start\ntrying to figure out figure it out on\ntheir own what we end up with is some\nadaptations that end up being\nmaladaptations so a good example of this\nis like Independence so one of the you\nknow the male virtues and we'll get to\nhow most of these virtues are not really\nmale towards the end one of the male\nvirtues is to be independent right I\nshould be able to take care of myself\nand so I think that part of what happens\nover time is as we kind of lean into\nthis I need to be independent I need to\nbe independent I need to be independent\nwhat this sort of turns into as a\nmaladaptation is like being closed off\nfrom other people so what we tend to see\nis that men are conditioned to only feel\nanger so that's the only social socially\nacceptable feeling so I remember for\nexample when my my dad passed away like\nif I started crying like men would walk\nup to me and they'd say like be strong\nand I interpreted that no one told me\nwhat that meant they didn't what they\ndidn't explicitly say stop crying they\njust said be strong now is the time for\nyou to be strong I didn't know what that\nmeant I still don't know what that means\nright what does it mean to be strong but\nthe way that I interpreted that is to\nnot display negative emotion and even\nwhen I remember kind of growing up like\nit's okay to get angry at stuff right\nit's okay to feel frustrated it's not\nokay to be ashamed it's not okay to be\nafraid it's not okay to be worried right\nlike those are kind those are the kinds\nof feelings that were sort of not\nconditioned to feel and so as we sort of\nrely rely on Independence what we end up\ndoing is we sort of like adapt to that\nright so I'm told I need to be\nindependent and if I'm told I need to be\nindependent how do I do that I end up\nnumbing myself I end up being out of\ntouch with my emotions I end up not\nleaning on other people for emotional\nsupport right because that's like\nindependent it's not manly to start\ncrying you know put your head on\nsomeone's shoulder and cry like that's\nnot manly at all and so we have some of\nthese perceptions of what masculinity is\nand we try to adapt to them right so we\ntry to lean into this ideal of\nIndependence and as a result we end up\nactually creating a maladaptation which\nis sort of emotional like numbness and\nemotional withdrawal from other people\nand so this is essentially what I think\nis going on with masculinity right now\nthat there have been traditional\nmasculine gender roles and some of those\ngender roles have been hard to achieve\nfor men as Society has changed the other\ntricky thing is that I think that\nsociety's expectations of men have not\nkept pace with what is actually possible\nfor so for example as you know more and\nmore women enter the workforce the idea\nthat a man may not be able to provide\nhasn't really kept pace and when I say\nthat I'm once again that's not an\nindictment of women because once\nremember that these are societal\nexpectations and Men themselves feel\nthis way as well so this is where like\nif you're a stay-at-home dad you're much\nmore likely to be judged by other men\nthan you are to be judged by women\nactually I don't know if that's\nstatement is statistically true but I\nwould imagine so right so there's just\nan assumption like when I'm meeting\nother dads at the playground there's an\nassumption that all of us have jobs so\nthey'll just ask me like the second\nquestion what kind of work do you do\nthere's an assumption whereas if you\nmeet moms at the playground there isn't\nan assumption that they work so a lot of\nthese attitudes are sort of legacies\nSociety hasn't really kept pace with\nwhat it's like to actually be a man and\nwe tend to be judged unfairly in my\nopinion for that once again just because\nmen are judged unfairly doesn't mean\nthat women aren't judged unfairly too\nwe're just going to sort of focus on\nthis question which is what is healthy\nmasculinity and so let's get to that so\nwhat is what would I consider healthy\nmasculinity so I tend to think about\nhealthy masculinity is embodying two\nmajor traits one is to be independent\nand one is to be responsible this is\nwhere we've got to be careful because\nIndependence doesn't necessarily mean\nnot having connections with other people\nso let's talk a little bit about what I\nmean by Independence so the top of the\nlist is hygiene so this means that a man\nin my opinion should be able to groom\nthemselves and be cleaned also have a\nplace that is hygienic so to be able to\ndo your own laundry keep your place\nclean not have you know have a clean\ntoilet have a clean bathroom have clean\nlaundry be able to clean the kitchen it\nmeans to be able to do all of those\nthings to have a clean life and a clean\nliving space and this is where there are\nsome you know gender attitudes that\nstill persist that men aren't supposed\nto clean and women cleaning is women's\nwork so in my opinion A man should be\nindependent and shouldn't have to rely\non anyone to clean their house so men\nshould also be in that way so\nself-sufficient right so you should be\nable to cook for yourself you should be\nable to like do things around the house\nif you need to it's okay to have some\ndivision of labor if you have if you're\nin a committed relationship but if\nyou're if you're asking me like you know\nwhat would I consider being a good man I\nwould say like it's being able to handle\nstuff kind of on your own it doesn't\nmean that you necessarily have to the\nnext thing is to be responsible and so\nthat sort of means like a certain amount\nof financial responsibility if you\ndecide once again with your partner that\nyou are not going to be\num you know earning money I think that's\nactually totally fine but that's still\nin my opinion a financially responsible\ndecision right you're sitting down with\nyour partner you guys are having a\ndiscussion about it and you're sort of\nconcluding okay you're going to focus on\nyour career I'm going to focus on taking\ncare of the kids taking care of the\nhouse and like that's actually totally\nfine I think a certain amount of\nresponsibility also includes self-care\nso this is where I think a lot of men\nactually trip up that taking care of\nyour emotions is part of self-care it's\nnot just physical health but mental\nhealth that is your responsibility so\neven if you struggle with something like\ndepression or a generalized anxiety\ndisorder or bipolar disorder I don't\nthink it necessarily makes you weak to\nhave those things in the same way that\nyou could have been born with you know a\ncollagen deficiency or born with\num if you hurt your leg growing up you\nhave to take care of that right so you\nshould be responsible for your mental\nhealth I think another aspect of\nresponsibility is to a certain degree\nbeing responsible for the people around\nyou right accepting some amount of\nresponsibility and so I think it's\nessentially to be like independent and\nresponsible does that mean you need to\nbe able to pay all of your own bills I\nthink not necessarily because the other\nthing you have to do is part of that\nresponsibility a healthy amount of\nresponsibility is to acknowledge the\nlimits of your responsibility and this\nis where I think we slip into some\namount of toxic masculinity and if you\nask me what is toxic masculinity mean it\nmeans taking traditionally male ideals\nand growing them having so much\nhypertrophy in those ideals to where\nthey start to become maladaptive or\nharmful so it's fine to be independent I\nthink being independent is a wonderful\nideal and yet if we grow that value of\nIndependence all the way to the moon\nwill we end up as men who are isolated\nso in essence what I consider of is\nhealthy masculinity is like to be\nindependent and to be responsible to\ntake care of your health take care of\nyour hygiene try to be as financially\nindependent as possible try to be you\nknow a self-sufficient human being who\nmakes the world a slightly better place\nnow if you're listening to this and\nespecially if you're a woman you may\nthink oh my God but those are not\ntradition those aren't masculine ideals\nlike I as a woman can do this as well\nright those are great and I would\ncompletely agree with you so I think as\nwe are sort of seeing more and more\nequality as we're seeing less division\nof labor I can be a man or a woman today\nand be completely independent right I\ncan have my own place I can have my own\njob I can contribute to my retirement I\ncan have a doctor I can have health\ninsurance I can have a microwave I can\nhave it I can just completely take care\nof myself and so I think the other thing\nand this is what I honestly believe\nabout masculinity and femininity is that\nit if you really lean into these yogic\nteachings right these teachings from the\nkarmic Traditions that these things\nwhich a lot of people will agree with\nare social constructs right they're\nconstructs of the mind and at the end of\nthe day I think being a good man or\nbeing a good woman doesn't necessarily\nhave different criteria I think the real\nthing is to like be a good human being\nand if there are certain aspects of your\nidentity that you appreciate whether\nthey're masculine or feminine like by\nall means lean into those but at the end\nof the day I don't think that healthy\nmasculinity is substantially different\nfrom healthy femininity I think that\nword healthy doesn't actually come from\nthe masculine or the feminine the word\nhealthy comes from like the humanness\nthat we all share so to be independent\nto be responsible I think is ultimately\nlike the essence of healthy masculinity\nremember that that as we're kind of\nsumming up I think that when we get\ntripped up is when we start to lean into\ncertain aspects of traditional\nmasculinity and we kind of use them as\nsubstitutes for you know not being able\nto fulfill particular and insecurities\nso if for example like I don't feel very\ngood about being financially independent\nwhat I'm going to end up doing is\ncomparing my penis size to the size of\nother people right I'm over compensating\nand I use that example kind of\nintentionally because that's like\nliterally what we see we see a lot of\nlike hyper masculine or toxic masculine\nbehaviors come out of like an insecurity\nabout being able to fulfill other\naspects of what I consider to be\nmasculine so if you want to be a healthy\nman I'd say first of all just like be a\nhealthy human being secondly be a little\nbit aware of what does society expect\nyou to be and what of society's\nexpectations have you internalized for\nyourself and then be critical of those\nand ask yourself okay which of these am\nI willing to take on and which of these\nam I not willing to take on and this is\nwhere things get really tricky because\nif you abandon some of those societal\nNorms there's a very good chance that\nsome people out there will judge you for\nit right so if you're a man and you\ndecide you know what Financial\nIndependence is not something that like\nI'm just not going to have a career here\nthat's not something that I actually\nvalue or care about be prepared for the\nJudgment right and I'm not saying that\nthat's a good I'm not like it's an\nunfortunate thing but just be prepared\nfor it but be also be very careful\nbecause I don't think the perception\nthat we get judged tends to also be\nmagnified in our mind so for example\nlike if I meet 10 people and one of them\njudges me my brain isn't actually going\nto calculate that only 10 percent of\npeople judge me there's actually a\nreally really important cognitive bias\nthat we're biased towards the negative\nso if you get judged by a single person\nand that happens two or three times out\nof a group of let's say 10 people 10\npeople 10 people your mind will start to\nthink everyone is judging me this way\nwhich just isn't factually true but\nthat's just the nature of the mind so be\na little bit careful about that so at\nthe end of the day I think that healthy\nmasculinity masculinity in general as\nwe're sort of seeing is undergoing a\ncrisis of sorts we're sort of going\nthrough a period of what I would call\nrediscovery and I don't think that's\nnecessarily a bad thing so what we're\nsort of noticing is that there are\ntraditional masculine characteristics\nwhich as Society of all evolves as\ntechnology evolves some of those\ncharacteristics are no longer sort of\nnecessary for men so the there's been a\ndiffusion of responsibility there's been\na growth of independence of both genders\nand as a result what it means to be a\nman is changing what makes this really\nreally tough though is that I think that\nSociety in terms of the Judgment that\nmen face is lagging behind and this\ndoesn't once again we are not\nnecessarily saying that there aren't\njudgments that are lagging behind for\nwomen as well I hope I can make one\nstatement without it being comparative\nto some someone else but I think we're\nsort of seeing actually like evidence\nthat even though men are the genders are\ngetting closer and closer and closer\ntogether in terms of like what they're\ncapable of and what kind of work and\nthings like that they do we're sort of\nseeing evidence of some kind of judgment\nthat kind of lags behind and then what\nhappens is men will tend to compensate\nfor that right so as the world judges me\nfor not being manly enough in One\nDirection what I have to do is make up\nfor that by a hypertrophy which means\ngrowth another dimension of masculinity\nand it's that that hypertrophy of that\nother dimension of masculinity which I\nthink can really lead into what we call\ntoxic masculinity which is kind of like\nan exaggeration of particular masculine\ntraits and at the end of the day though\nI think the way to avoid that is to sort\nof take a step back really think about\nokay what do I expect what does society\nexpect from me what do I expect from\nmyself and to really lean into being\nultimately independent and responsible\nnot to a fault right so you don't need\nto be completely independent I think\nthat's the example of hypertrophy of\nIndependence like you should be\nrelatively independent but all human\nbeings are going to require the support\nof other human beings and at the end of\nthe day if you kind of notice oh those\naren't masculine characteristics I\ncompletely agree because I think\nultimately a healthy gender identity has\na lot more to with doing how with being\nhealthy than it does with like the\nparticular gender identity so that's my\ntake on masculinity let's see if people\nhave questions yeah so Lobster Lord is\nsaying women play a big role in this as\nwell a good number still value those\nclassic male attributes which is totally\nfine right so that that's my point is\nthat there's any time I hear this\ndiscussion there's an assumption that\nthe opposite gender is responsible for\nthe Judgment whereas in my experience\nlike everyone's responsible for the\nJudgment right men will judge men for\nnot being able to have a job men will\njudge men for not being in shape men\nwill judge men for having small penises\nright like even I like a couple years\nago I made jokes about micropenis and I\nrealized like that was wrong so\napologize for it but like men are just\nthe judgmental towards men and women are\njust as judgmental towards women so I\nthink that like this is where people\nfall into trouble is is as Men start to\nfeel resentful what we tend to do is\nblame the opposite gender whereas like\nI'm not saying that the opposite gender\nis not it's to some degree at fault but\nit's not like we're not at fault either\nright I think judgment is the problem\nI'm curious if this hyper compensation\nis also hiring only women in stem\ncareers so I think when it comes to the\nintersection of profession and gender\nthat's a whole different kind of terms\nso this is the other thing that I think\nwe've got to be really careful about\nwhen we discuss gender issues is it's\nreally easy to lean into let's say good\nanthropological science make statements\nthat are like well supported and then\nthe moment we open up professions\nthere's actually a whole other body of\nresearch so one of the things that\nreally frustrates me about gender\nDynamics is that people assume that like\ndata from one column applies to\nsomething else whereas if you really\nlook at it scientifically piles of\nresearch from anthropology even\nevolutionary biology and like statistics\non careers and things like that are like\nthere's a bunch of different data that\nyou have to consider the other thing to\nremember in general so we learned this\nin science so for a long time there was\na nature nurture debate a particular\nBehavior happens is it nature or is it\nnurture and it turns out that the answer\nfor most things scientifically is this\nword called multifactorial\nmultifactorial means it's not just one\nthing it's a contribution of different\nvariables and in fact the more variables\nyou include the closer you get get to\nthe real formula this concept is\ncompletely lost in gender discussions\nright everyone's so focused on\ndiscrimination against men or women no\none's really paying attention to each\nother and there's a lot more at play\nthan discrimination the reason that\nthere are more men in stem careers\nversus women in stem careers has\nsomething to do with discrimination but\nit also has to do with a lot of other\nthings and so if you all want to talk\nabout profession like the intersection\nof gender and profession fascinating\nsubject but there's a lot more Nuance\nthan most people discuss because what\nhappens in those kinds of situations is\npeople tend to have particular\nexperiences which are emotionally\ncharged and once that emotion takes over\nthey don't look at things objectively\nright and I'm not saying that men or\nwomen are more guilty of this I've seen\nthis both ways I've seen men who are in\nstem careers that get passed over by a\nwoman and they're like oh this is like\nthis is like you know since there are so\nfew women in some careers they're\ngetting treated advantageously this\nhurts me therefore I'm going to blame\nthem whereas like it's possible that\nthere was discrimination that's\nabsolutely possible but it's also\npossible that the reason that your\ncolleague was promoted is because\nthey're better at their job than you are\nand the flip is also true where you know\nwomen will will sort of like also be\nconcerned about discrimination whereas\nlike there could be discrimination\nchances are there was one instance of\ndiscrimination that really really hurt\nand then we start to see discrimination\neverywhere which it could be everywhere\nbut oftentimes in my experience working\nwith women in professional settings the\nones that are the most successful are\nthe ones that accept some amount of\nindividual responsibility assigned\ndescribe discrimination its appropriate\nweight but it's not like discrimination\nis responsible for everything in the\nworkplace the truth is that most issues\nare multifactorial and maybe that's like\nan offensive statement but that's been\nmy experience like if you look at you\nknow what what does it take to grow up\nwith a personality disorder it takes a\nlot of different things socioeconomic\nstatus matters attachment style matters\nparents matter parents personality\nstructures matter the truth is that most\nof science especially when it comes to\nhumanity is like complex it's not\nexplainable by one variable and I think\nthat oversimplification is causing lots\nof problems because then what happens is\nwhen we oversimplify and we assume\neverything is discrimination and then we\nfocus on that one thing we're not\nactually addressing all the other issues\nat play so maybe I've succeeded at\noffending everyone hopefully not um so\nGreedo eight is saying I wonder how you\nwould apply this topic to those who are\nnon-binary or they just exempt from the\nsocietal expectations\nno so when it comes to being non-binary\nI think this makes things even more\nchallenging in some ways because you're\nnot necessarily exempt from societal\nexpectations when you're non-binary\nsometimes you get judged from both sides\nof the coin so sometimes you actually\nhave twice the judgment and the\nchallenge is that if you're non-binary\nthere it's a little bit unclear what is\nan ideal that you should be shooting for\nright so like even if you say that there\nare attitudes of masculinity and\nfemininity that are harmful which I\ncompletely agree with it's easy from a\nsense of a compass like we've got a\ndirection to point towards whether that\ndirection is good or bad the challenge\nwith being non-binary is that you don't\neven have a compass right so what is the\nideal non-binary person I think that's\nharder to understand it's harder to come\nup with a answer we're not saying it's\nthe right one it's easy to Envision what\nthe ideal masculine of a man is it's\neasy to Envision what the ideal uh you\nknow woman is it's hard to Envision what\nan ideal non-binary person is which is\nprecisely why I like the yogic\nperspective because yogic perspective is\nabout being a good human so like to be\nindependent and responsible I think\nthose are fantastic ideals for someone\nwho's non-binary it's a great question\nwhat's with Dr K apologizing for every\nstatement it's because every time we've\ntried to talk about gender Dynamics\nsomeone gets offended and I'm trying not\nto offend people so it requires a lot of\napologies and for people who are saying\noh stop apologizing so this is what's\nimportant to understand about making\napologies when it comes to gender\nDynamics so if we don't make apologies\nwho is going to listen to what we have\nto say the people that agree with us\nright they will be they will listen but\nwho needs to listen to what we have to\nsay not just the people that agree with\nus we need the other side to listen as\nwell and so in order to engage them in\nconversation we have to offer\ndisclaimers and that's okay does that\nmake sense part of the problem problem\nwith the Internet is that you have\npeople who are like doubling down and\nnot offering disclaimers not offering a\ndifferent perspective and so what they\nend up doing is alienating the people\nthat disagree with them and so then I've\ngot my camp and I ain't gonna apologize\nfor [ __ ] it's your fault and then the\nother side is like I ain't gonna\napologize for [ __ ] it's your fault and\nthere's so much antagonism and that's\nwhere like I'm gonna speak my truth and\nall the rabble rousers behind me with\ntheir pitchforks are like yeah let's go\nand on the flip side you've got the\narrival rousers who believe the exact\nopposite they've got their pitchforks\nand then let's go so the issue is that\nif you are on one side of the camp you\nshouldn't be speaking to your side you\nshould be speaking to the opposite side\nyou should engage them in dialogue try\nto understand why do you believe the\nthings like how can you believe what you\nbelieve right we don't ever stop to ask\nourselves how did this person get to\nthis conclusion we just say this\nconclusion is wrong and then everyone\nselectively cites sources but what about\nthis but what about this but what about\nthis and then like you miss the original\npoint right it's like if a patient comes\ninto my office with test taking regular\ncancer and someone jumps in and says but\nbreast cancer is more common it's like\nyeah sure breast cancer is more common\nbut like this person has testicular\ncancer and they need help today so\nthere's like there's no reason to\ncorrelate or discuss breast cancer and\ntesticular cancer together but this is\nwhat's happening in gender Dynamic\ndiscussions someone is trying to share\nsomething about my experience of being a\nman or a woman and the first thing that\nhappens but what about this other\nexperience it's like that's not the\nexperience we're talking about and then\nwhat happens is when I try to share my\nexperience let's say as a man and\nsomeone else says but what about this\nwith women men are greater so let's say\nlike I make a statement like the number\nof men who get helped after being\nsexually assaulted is very very low and\nthen someone counters with but men are\nmore often perpetrators of sexual\nassault than women and so then what\nhappens is like let's forget for a\nmoment about what statement is true or\nnot both of those statements are\nprobably true but then what happens is\nhow do I feel when someone says that\nlike I don't feel heard and then if I\ndon't feel heard and someone else says\nthat right they're like oh but like men\nare more commonly sexual assault\nperpetrator that could be like a really\nimportant point but if I don't feel\nheard I'm not going to listen to that\nand then what ends up happening is like\nonce I try to share something that I\nstruggle with and someone shoots me down\nthen I sure as hell I'm not going to be\nlike listening to them and then the\nmoment that they say something the\nresentment in my my heart comes up and\nI'm going to counter whatever they say\nbut what about this but what about this\nand now what's happened is both people\nare struggling and no one is like paying\nattention and for what it's worth I\nthink the gender discussions in our\ncommunity are getting way healthier I\ndon't know if you all have noticed this\nhonestly this is the only place on the\ninternet that I consistently see people\nwho have different experiences of gender\nthat will like regularly support each\nother only place and I'm not saying that\nto you it's like literally like you can\ngo because what we have on the Internet\nis we have safe spaces for a particular\nlike particular group right and it's\nlike we've got Echo Chambers we have\nnowhere where the echo Chambers Collide\nand what happened actually with us I\ndon't know if y'all paid attention Echo\nChambers collided and then some people\ngot really upset and left the people who\nstuck around though like now we actually\nhave dialogue I never realized you know\nso a man sort of talks about being alone\nand then someone else is like I'm an\nattractive woman and I feel alone all\nthe time and everyone was like what\nthat's possible and someone else\nrecently I saw a great post about you\nknow I'm a lesbian woman and I feel\nalone and it's like wow it seems like\nmaybe what we struggle with as human\nbeings may have a gender component but\nit's it turns out that like most human\nbeings can share a lot of experiences it\nturns out that suffering is not uniquely\nmale or uniquely female I know it's it's\nwild it's wild yeah so uberwolf 23 is\nsaying I'm non-binary but except people\nwho don't understand or agree I get\nostracized by both sides people just\ncan't wrap their head around I'm I'm\nwith you they're like they try to bucket\nyou and the thing is you don't fall into\neither bucket so even if you check some\nof the boxes everyone hyper focuses on\nthe boxes you don't check which is true\nof both masculinity and feminine as well\nlike just think about it even if I'm a\nman and I have a nice bush she beard and\nI know how to chop firewood and I know\nhow to grill people will be focused on\noh like I don't have a job because I'm\nout in the wilderness all day and if\nyou're a woman it's like you can have a\nfantastic career but then people will\nkeep asking you like why don't you have\nkids and if you decide to have kids\npeople will like like some of those like\nyou know career women will like look at\nyou with pity in their eyes and they'll\nbe like I can't believe you gave it up\nfor this like the Judgment there's no\nend to the Judgment so that's like when\nit comes to being like a good human\nbeing in gender Dynamics like you can't\nstop other people from judging the only\nthing that you can really do is stop\njudging yourself and by that I mean\ndon't judge yourself but also don't\njudge other people right like the\nJudgment stops here like you can't\ncontrol the rest of it\nforeign"
