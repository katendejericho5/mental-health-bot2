    "transcript": "if you do particular things as a patient\nyou will no longer need the medication\nto do that to do that job for you\nso what we're going to do now\nis we're going to talk a little bit\nabout ocd so we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about what ocd is what it\nisn't what are some of the key features\nof ocd and lastly we're going to talk\nabout three things that people get wrong\nwhen it comes to ocd so let's start by\ntaking a quick look at the post\nokay\nocd is the most misunderstood mental\nillness\nevery single person i've seen thinks it\nthinks it's about organizing and always\njoking they have it because they're\nclean and organized\nthey don't understand that there's many\ntypes of ocd and for most people it's\nnot like that at all that sometimes\nthat's sometimes a coping method for\nsome i've convinced myself i have cancer\nsomeone's going to break in and hurt my\npets and i have to make sure it's not\nhappening and keep on checking the\nchecking compulsions have also ruined my\nlife\nthey're as bad as if not worse than the\nobsessive thoughts every mistake i make\nhaunts me and even when it affected no\none\neven if it's a small mistake like\naccidentally stepping on something the\nguilt eats me up it hurts me so much i\nwant to change my whole life\ni can't live like this i've convinced\nmyself i have every cancer before i\nconvince myself i have something or am\nsomething new so often\ni research about it non-stop and it\nmatches my symptoms and then it's a\nwhole cycle i can't take it the fact\nthat it's so misunderstood makes it\nworse i get so pissed when people\nconstantly say how it blessed them or i\nhave ocd because i'm organized even\nteachers say that shame on them and they\nhaven't been diagnosed\nand say that like shut up seriously\nso i think it's super challenging but\nocd is actually one of the most\nmisunderstood illnesses so what we're\ngoing to do today is talk a little bit\nabout why it's misunderstood talk a\nlittle bit about what it is and then\nthree really common mistakes that people\nmake\nso let's start with why it's\nmisunderstood so the first thing that\nwe're going to talk about is ocd versus\nocpd\nso ocd is obsessive compulsive disorder\nand ocpd is obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder now what's the\ndifference between these two things\nso we tend to use the phrase ocd\ncolloquially we'll say oh my god i'm so\nocd i have to have everything in the\nright place i'm so ocd everything has to\nbe organized i'm so ocd everything has\nto be on time and when people are\ntalking about ocd what they basically\nmean is i'm a control freak right i need\neverything organized i need everything\nsymmetrical\nbut being a control freak isn't ocd it's\nactually something completely different\nwhich is what we tend to call ocpd which\nis obsessive-compulsive personality\ndisorder so in the case of ocpd people\nare control freaks to the extent where\nit actually negatively impacts their\nfunction in their relationships usually\nto a drastic extent if people are\ntalking about being so ocd on social\nmedia because they have to arrange all\ntheir bookshelves in a particular way\nchances are they're not actually true\nocpd i mean very few a small percentage\nof the population maybe one or two\npercent of the population really has\nocpd\nso what people tend to usually what that\nmeans is that they're they're they have\na high tendency for organization they're\nmore rigid they're lower on sort of the\nthe openness or lower on the\nagreeableness scale from a personality\nperspective and everyone calls this ocd\nand so as we've started calling\nbasically being a control freak or being\nlike more rigid in our thinking ocd what\nit started to do is actually confuse a\nlot of people about what real ocd is so\nlet's talk a little bit about what true\nocd is\nso the first thing to understand is that\nocd is composed of two things obsessions\nand compulsions\nso obsessions are usually thoughts that\nhave the following characteristics the\nfirst is that they're intrusive\nso what that means is that i can be\ngoing about my day and then a thought\nwill like force its way into my head\nfrequently the intrusive thoughts are\nalso\nunwanted so that sort of means i don't\nwant to be thinking about this right so\nif i'm going to a wedding and i'm having\na good time and i'm like i'm there at\nthe wedding to have fun\nbut if i have ocd i can start thinking\nall these sort of negative and intrusive\nand unwanted things i may start thinking\noh my god what if the groom dies what if\nthe groom dies what if the groom dies\nwhat if the groom dies or i may start\nthinking a little bit about getting\ninfected with covid and then i can't\nstop those kinds of thoughts or i can\neven eat a piece of like i can eat an\nappetizer and i get a weird sensation in\nmy stomach and i get this persistent\nthought\nthat maybe i've got stomach cancer\nso that's the third quality of\nobsessions which is that they're\npersistent so no matter what i do they\nalways tend to come back come back come\nback so in people in the cases of people\nwho have for example like let's say body\ndysmorphia which is a kind of ocd\ni'll look at my face and i'll think oh\nmy god my face is flawed i need to fix\nit and then no matter how much i try to\nfix it even to the extent of maybe\nwearing makeup or going and getting\nsurgery and then i need more surgeries\nand more surgeries and more surgeries\nbecause the the key thing about the\nobsession from ocd is that it's\npersistent and even fixing things on the\noutside doesn't make the thoughts go\naway\nso obsessions are intrusive\nunwanted and persistent the other thing\nabout obsessions and this is kind of\nimportant to understand is that they\ndon't make me happy so even though i may\nact in accordance with them it's not\nlike making me happy to give in to my\nocd in fact quite quite the opposite\nfrequently for many people is that i\nwant the thoughts to go away i don't\nlike it and if we look at people who are\ncontrol freaks they get really really\nhappy when everyone listens to them and\nthey get their way right so this is a\nkey difference between ocd and ocpd in\npsychiatry we call this phrase ego\nsyntonic which basically means does it\njive with you or not and in the case of\nocd what people with people when people\nhave true ocd they want their ocd to go\naway when people have ocpd they don't\nwant their ocpd to go away because\nthey're right and the rest of the world\nis wrong and the rest of the world\nreally needs to do things the way that i\ndo them we really need to objectively\norganize the knives the forks and the\nspoons this way because it's better\nso an ocd people really dislike the\nthoughts they have they dislike the\nobsessions and in ocpd they tend to be\nlike very very controlling and they\nthink that they're good and better than\nwhat everyone else thinks\nso just for the sake of completeness\noftentimes obsessions focus on a couple\nof different things so they can focus on\nthings like cleaning um or being\nconcerned about germs or or kind of\nbeing a germaphobe or neat freak or\nsomething like that they can be focused\non symmetry and this is where things get\na little bit conflicting with ocpd um or\nmuddy i should say with ocpd because\noften times oct ocpd can be very re\npeople can be rigid and organized as\nwell so\nobsessions are frequently about cleaning\nthey're frequently about symmetry right\nso i need things arranged in a\nparticular way they're also frequently\nabout what we call taboo thoughts so\npeople will have intrusive and unwanted\nthoughts that are very very like\nnegative like we judge them very harshly\nso people can have thoughts about\ninappropriate kind of sexual\nrelationships they can have just all\nkinds of thoughts that they feel guilty\nfor they're very taboo or forbidden and\nthe last common uh type of ocpd actually\nhas to do with intrusive thoughts of\nharm so this can be actually incredibly\ndistressing because despite not wanting\nto hurt anyone\nyou will sometimes have visions of\nharming other people in particular ways\nand those those visions are once again\nintrusive unwanted they don't agree with\nyou you don't think they're right and\nthey can be very very distressing so\nthat's\nobsessions which are intrusive unwanted\nand persistent thoughts\nthe other key thing about ocd is that\nfrequently what people will discover is\nways to calm those obsessions down so if\ni'm having a particular taboo thought\nright i'm thinking something that i\nshouldn't be thinking what people with\nocpd will discover\nis ways to alleviate the tension in the\nmind\nand those are what we call compulsions\nso if for example i'm a germaphobe if i\nwash my hands for 90 seconds under\nscaldingly hot water then my fear of\ngerms will calm down\nand so i'll engage in a compulsive\nbehavior so here are the key things\nabout compulsions they're oftentimes\nbehaviors but they can also sometimes be\nthoughts\nso sometimes i've met people with ocd\nwho will like think particular things so\ni was working with someone who once\nevery time a loved one was traveling\nthey had to say some kind of like\nmagical spell in their mind and if they\nsaid these thoughts this person is going\nto leave on time and they'll be arrive\non time they'll leave they'll be safe\nwhen they leave and they'll be safe when\nthey'll they arrive they'll be alive\nwhen they leave and they'll be alive\nwhen they arrive they'll sort of come up\nwith this almost like mantra in their\nhead that they sort of have to say in\norder to feel better about that person\nactually leaving\nand unless they go through the\ncompulsion the tension of the obsessive\nthought actually persists and it's\nactually incredibly terrifying\nso compulsions or behaviors or even\nmental behaviors that we do to alleviate\nthe obsessions the other tricky thing\nabout the compulsions is that they will\nalso oftentimes be damaging in and of\nthemselves so in the case of the\ngermaphobe that's something that we can\nunderstand i've seen patients who have\nyou know very like raw hands that are\nactually getting infected because\nthey've broken down parts of the skin\nfrom excessive washing and excessive\nscrubbing and now they're prone to\ninfection which makes the ocd even worse\nand they want to keep washing and keep\nwashing and keep washing so engaging in\nthe compulsions can actually be damaging\nto people\nso that's kind of what true ocd is we\nsee it's a huge impairment to function\nso what are some of the common things\nthat people get wrong when it comes to\nocd the first we've already talked about\na fair amount which is that people\nconfuse ocd with ocpd they confuse being\na control freak with ocd\nbut what we learn from real ocd is that\nit's obsessions that are intrusive\npersistent and unwanted and compulsions\nthat make that kind of stuff go away\neven though you want don't want to do it\nand oftentimes people recognize that the\ncompulsions are actually very irrational\nso that's the first thing ocd isn't what\npeople think it is\nthe second thing that people oftentimes\nforget about ocd is that the compulsions\ndon't have to be\nwhat the media represents\nthe compulsions don't have to be turning\non and off the lights or turning on and\noff the stove the compulsions can be\ncompletely non-visible or even not\nbehaviors at all they can be thoughts\nthey can be things that you do in your\nhead and when i've worked with some\npeople who have debilitating ocd you\nwould never see it from the outside\nbecause essentially every time they do\nsomething they have to run through this\nwhole litany in their head so every time\ni start studying i have to go through\nsome kind of like process in my head\nbefore i pull a single notebook out\nevery time i flip the page i have to go\nthrough some sort of process in my head\nbefore i can flip the page otherwise i\nwill lose kind of the information in the\npage\nand the last thing that we have to\nreally focus on that people don't really\nget about ocd is that you can't really\ncontrol it\nso this is for people who have ocd as\nwell as people who are in relationships\nwith people who have ocd which is that\nwe'll assume that this person is can\nsomehow control it so sometimes i've\nseen people with ocd get treated very\nvery harshly by parents by friends by\nromantic partners because they're like\nwhy can't you just stop doing it\nthere's this assumption that ocd can be\ncontrolled and it really can't it's like\nthis automatic persistent unwanted and\nintrusive process that it doesn't mean\nthat it can't be treated but there's\nsort of this idea that like if people\ntried harder they could make the ocd go\naway just don't wash your hands easy\nright just be satisfied in the way that\nyou look and stop getting surgeries and\ngetting your like your nose like getting\na rhinoplasty and botox injections and\nall this kind of stuff so the most\nterrible ocd i've actually worked with\nis actually people who are bodybuilders\nand who are so obsessional about a\nparticular part of their body that\nthey'll work out for four hours five\nhours six hours a day and aren't really\nable to function in other parts of their\nlife\nso these are the three things to really\nthat people really get wrong with ocd\nwhich is why it makes it so\nsuch a misunderstood illness the first\nis that being having ocd is not being a\ncontrol freak in fact they're completely\ndifferent even when being a control\nfreak rises to the level of a diagnosis\nwhich is what we call ocpd\nthat's still like you know very very\nrare\nsecond thing is that obsessions and\ncompulsions are are not necessarily\nphysical behaviors a lot of ocd can\nhappen purely in your head and the third\nthing is it's not something that you can\njust control and so a lot of times when\ni work with patients with ocd\nthey recognize that these thoughts are\nunwanted remember they're ego dystonic\nso i don't want to have them it doesn't\nmake me happy to have these thoughts and\nso i try to control it i try to control\nit i try to use willpower but that's not\nhow it works\nthere are absolutely places where\nwillpower becomes important but that's\nwhere good ocd treatment comes in\nbecause we figured out that this can\nactually be helped you just have to\napproach it in sort of an evidence-based\nand scientifically valid way which is\nnot brute forcing it through willpower\nor blaming someone for having these\nkinds of symptoms\nso it's unfortunate that ocd is so\nmisunderstood and hopefully by sort of\ngoing over some of the basics of\nobsessions and compulsions we can\nunderstand really what it is and also\nunderstand what we get wrong about it\nquestions\nyeah i didn't i didn't think we needed\nipad we may bust it out but\nso a lot of good questions here\ncould it be possible that having ocd is\nbeneficial in some way\npossibly\nbut remember that when we're doing the\ndividing line between whether something\nis a psychiatric illness or not the\ndividing line is whether it impairs\nfunction\nso generally speaking when we talk about\nocd\nthese are people for whom it is so\nsevere that\nit kind of by definition impairs them\nmore than it helps them\nare there levels of ocpd absolutely\nright so just like any other personality\ndisorder there are people with severe\nocpd and people with mild ocpd and there\nare even people with what i would call\nsubclinical ocpd so these are people who\nare like control freaks\nwho have trouble in their interpersonal\nrelationships but it's not they're not\nsuch bad control freaks that they can't\nmaintain a job they can maintain a\nhealthy or they can maintain you know a\nromantic relationship etc\ncan ocd worsen anxiety disorders if you\nhave both absolutely so there's actually\na high level of comorbidity between\nanxiety disorders and ocd\nso there seems to be it seems to be that\nlike it's not a purely independent\nprocess\nwhat about the compulsion to smoke\ncigarettes so so great question so we\ncan have com we can be\nhave behaviors that are compulsive\nwhich don't necessarily have to do with\nocd\nso if i feel\nif i feel like i need to smoke a\ncigarette that could be due to a\nbiological or physiological dependence\nthat's making me kind of feel that way\nthat's part of the reason that when i\ntalk about compulsions and ocd what we\nreally look for this is somewhat of an\noversimplification because you know if\nyou really want to understand what we\nlook for you got to go to medical school\nand then become a psychiatrist or\npsychologist or whatever\nbut basically what we look for is that\nthe compulsion\nrelieves the mental tension of the\nobsession this is a key part\nof ocd\nthat the reason that i wash my hands\nover and over and over and over again is\nbecause it's the only way that i can\nstop worrying about being infected\nbecause the thoughts of being infected\nare so intrusive\nso persistent and so unwanted that i\ncan't do anything\ni can't play video games i can't talk to\npeople i can't pay attention in class\nbecause i'm constantly thinking about oh\nmy god this is i'm germ germs germs\ngerms germs and the only way\nthat i can start to live life\nis by washing my hands 15 times so that\nthat thought finally calms down\nthe problem is that it's just going to\ncome back\ntomorrow later today if someone touches\nme it just comes back and then the cycle\nrepeats itself which is why ocd is so\ndebilitating\ngood questions\nhow easy is it to diagnose i'd say it's\nnot hard to diagnose if you're a\ncompetent clinician for the most part\nsometimes the tricky thing about ocd is\nthat\nit can look like other things and also\npatience or the reason we're educating\non this y'all on this stuff is so\nbecause a lot of times what will happen\nis that patients will\nnot volunteer particular information\nbecause they think it's normal or they\ndon't think it's what their vision of\nocd is\nso that's why for example like i've met\nsome patients who the diagnosis has been\nmissed\nbecause you know in the screening uh\nclinicians will ask them questions like\noh do you have checking behaviors\nthey'll talk about behaviors of ocd\nwhereas they won't ask about mental\ncompulsions so sometimes it can be\nmissed it can oftentimes look like\nanxiety or things like that or since\npeople have ocd and anxiety\nthe anxiety is like what we pick up\nfirst\nright so there are like reasons why it\ncan be missed but generally speaking i\nwouldn't say it's hard to diagnose\nare ocd and ocpd mutually exclusive no\nthey're not mutually exclusive\nbut they still look very very different\nuh people are asking about adhd and ocd\ni don't know that there is a very tight\ncomorbidity between the two\nwhat i've seen is very very\nfrustrating for people who have ocd and\nadhd\nthis is devastating\nis that\nin adhd it's easy to get distracted\nand ocd\nloves to dominate your mind\nso what i've seen in the two which can\nbe very hard to deal with is when i've\ngot ocd and adhd let's say i wash my\nhands 10 times and then i'm sitting down\nto study and i'm no longer thinking\nabout germs\nthe problem is that once i sit down to\nstudy 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes\nmaybe an hour goes by maybe 90 minutes\ngo by maybe three hours go by before i\nthink about drugs again in a\nneurotypical person\nwhen you throw adhd into the mix it's\neasier to get distracted\nright so now that i get distracted the\nocd is like oh thank you for opening the\ndoor let me come in with my intrusive\nunwanted and persistent thoughts and\nlet's go back to square one\nso sometimes i can see the two really\nkind of synergize in a very negative way\nbut i haven't seen a lot of data that\nshows that they're very highly comorbid\ngood questions\ncan people be obsessive over\nself-improvement sure so this is also\nwhere obsessiveness\nis not exclusively ocd the key thing\nabout obsessiveness is that it usually\nhas obsessions and compulsions\nso we'll see obsessiveness\nas a quality that is a part of all kinds\nof things\nso it can also be a part of other mental\nillnesses\nso for example like um\npeople on the autism spectrum can\nsometimes be obsessive about particular\nthings\nthat's something that we call more\nsomething like perseverance which is the\ninability to let go of a particular\nthought\nsometimes we'll also see obsessiveness\nin things like psychotic disorders or\ndelusional disorders\nright where someone becomes like very\nlike delusionally obsessed with\nsomething and they can't stop thinking\nabout it can't stop talking about it but\nit doesn't mean that you have ocd\nthe other thing is that sometimes\nobsessiveness\nhas nothing to do with a psychiatric\nillness sometimes people just get\nobsessed and it can be almost more of a\npersonality characteristic where they\nreally tunnel down into one thing or\nthey can sort of foster a certain kind\nof infatuation or things like that where\nyou may\nbe able to diagnose someone who is like\nyou know a stalker with something right\nbecause there's something not right\nthere but sometimes you can have\nobsession outside of psychiatric illness\nso if if this resonates with y'all so\ni'm noticing one person is saying i\ncount all the time how can i stop i can\ncontrol a few things and started\nfighting against a few things i would\nsay you should get clinically evaluated\nthat's what the reason that we have\nthese kinds of educational\nsegments\nso\nbryant\ngu is asking in private spaces i'm a\nmess but in public spaces i have to\nleave things exactly as before i\ndisplace them is this ocd so that's not\na question that i can answer so\njust a you know couple things when we\nsay we're not doing you know nothing no\nthis is medical advice we don't diagnose\nor treat people over the internet but\nit's not just it's not just that we're\nnot doing that for medical legal reasons\nit's because\ngetting a diagnosis and determining\nwhether something is ocd involves a\nthorough diagnostic process so when i'm\nevaluating someone for ocd it's not a\nyes or no question about one feature\nthat's where because remember ocd can\nlook like other things and that's why\nwhen you do a diagnostic evaluation for\nocd a part of that diagnostic process is\nactually ruling out all kinds of other\nstuff\nso before i can diagnose someone with\nocd i have to not only assess the ocd\nsymptoms\nbut also make sure that it's not\nsomething that looks like ocd so make\nsure it's not an anxiety disorder make\nsure it's not body dysmorphia make sure\nit's not for example you know bullying\nlike if you were\nyou know grew up in a household for\nexample where your parents were like\nmade sure everything was in order\nbecause you all had to keep up\nappearances and so if you go out you\nhave to keep everything neat and tidy\nbecause of you know what your parents\nthe way they raised you that may not be\nocd so a diagnostic evaluation is not\njust about checking boxes it's also\nabout making sure that it's not\nsomething else so diagnostic evaluation\ninvolves diagnostic criteria\nas well as assessing for other\nconditions and ruling out those\nconditions that's how you make a real\nyou know medical diagnosis\nso does ocd act in similar ways to\ntourette syndrome there are some\ncorrelations there in fact i think some\nof these tick disorders are\nconsidered in the ocd family\nso\ni'm not an expert in those disorders but\nthere's like some there's definitely\nsome overlap there or some common\nstarting point according to a lot of\npeople so we do tend to lump them\ntogether like we kind of say okay these\nthings seem similar to us\nso it seems like a lot of people okay so\nlet me ask you all a question now\nso\num\nso uh someone's asking can someone\nsuddenly develop ocd ocpd later in their\nlives like in their 30s they can so just\nto give y'all some statistics i want to\nsay that the average\nage of onset for ocd i'm rusty here is i\nthink 19 years old\nso most people who have ocd will\nexperience it early in life now they may\nnot get diagnosed with it\nbut i have seen\ni've certainly seen like weird cases so\nthis is the advantage of\ntraining at a place like massachusetts\ngeneral hospital or mclean hospital so\nthese are like world-renowned\ninstitutions and people will like\nget referred from all over the world so\nsometimes you see some weird stuff\nso i've seen like weird cases of\npost-infectious like development of ocd\nbut just because i've seen it doesn't\nmean it's common in fact when you work\nat a place like mgh or mclean\nby definition you see a lot of stuff\nthat is the least common\nbecause\nlike people you know it's not\nrun-of-the-mill ocd this is a weird kind\nof ocd so like your community\npsychiatrist will actually send them\nfrom a different state\nto the ocdi at mclean the ocd institute\nat mclean hospital because that's where\nlike people are experts in ocd so you\nyou can see it later but it's not common\nyeah it's kind of weird so like i love\ntraining there\nbut it's like i also saw i think a case\nof familial fatal insomnia\nwhich is\nfascinating but also like exceedingly\nrare like i'll probably\nnever see\nanother case of it in my lifetime and i\ndoubt\ni mean most psychiatrists will never see\na case of familial fatal insomnia\nhopefully\nyeah familial fatal insomnia is a prion\ndisease we've done a lecture on it\nbefore\nthis is kind of interesting we did a\nplay-through of uh i mean we started\nplaying disco elysium and there was some\nguy who was like make like talking like\njust in some dialogue thing and i was\nlike oh this sounds like\na familial fatal insomnia and then we\ndid like a quick lecture on it and then\nsure enough like later on in the\ndialogue he's like actually mentioned\nand i was like oh wow these people\nreally did their research\nonce you get diagnosed with ocd do you\nhave it forever or can it dissipate over\ntime what a great question\nso this we actually have another post\nabout\nso we're going to talk about general\ntreatments for\npsychiatric stuff\nwe're going to focus a little bit about\non adhd for a second but a lot of this\napplies to\nno ipad we don't need netflix\nmy ipad is trying to open netflix\nokay\nso let's talk about\nso people have some questions about\ntreatments right\nso short answer is there are all kinds\nof treatments for ocd\nmedication\ntheir medication treatment psychotherapy\ntreatments\nthe two are not mutually exclusive i've\nseen cases where people can end up in\nsustained remission from ocd it\nbasically does not affect them at all\nthat's the goal of psychiatric treatment\nit doesn't mean that they don't still\nsometimes have intrusive thoughts but\nthey're basically able to\nfunction completely normally and it\ndoesn't really cause them much distress\nsome of those people can do it without\nmedication some people sort of find\nmedication to be easier just depends on\nthe person\nbut let's talk a little bit more about\ntreatment\nokay\nmy doctor just told me i've become\ndependent\non adhd medication what does that even\nmean\ni got off the phone with my doctor just\nnow to get my adderall prescription\nrefilled during the call he asked me do\nyou take it every day or as needed so i\ntold him honestly i take it every day\nbecause i feel i need it every day my\nadhd doesn't just vanish but on the odd\nday that i forget to take it i do just\nfine it's when i forget for multiple\ndays that it becomes an issue and he\nsaid it sounds to me like you've become\ndependent on stimulants\nokay\nso i told him that i actually was\nplanning on visiting a proper\npsychiatrist my prescription was given\nby a gp and seeing about altering my\nprescription maybe a non-stimulant would\nwork or a lower dosage and he replied no\nstimulants work best for adhd symptoms\nso now i'm very confused as to what he's\ngoing on about to be honest\ni shouldn't take my medication if i\ndon't need it because i'll become\ndependent on stimulants but i also need\nto take stimulants because it helps me\nthe most\ntherefore making me dependent it's\nreally confusing logic and i don't know\nhow i feel about about it he didn't\nreally elaborate either no concerns\nabout my blood pressure anything he just\nsaid hey you're dependent just letting\nyou know your prescription is ready for\nyou to pick up\nit's just really confusing and i'm\nparanoid about my health as it stands\nso this is really tough\nbecause especially if you've got adhd\nlike\nanyone who's taking psychiatric\nmedication\nusually has a concern that they're going\nto become dependent on it\ni've seen this whether people have ocd\nwhether i have major depressive disorder\nwhether they have bipolar disorder\nwhether i have adhd people are afraid of\nbecoming dependent on medication\nand then sometimes you'll have\nclinicians who will be like oh yeah\nyou're dependent on this medication now\nlike a doctor is telling you this and\nthat's kind of terrifying like isn't\ndependency on medication like a bad\nthing\nand then you're like not really sure and\nsometimes you'll even ask\nyour doctor like hey like is there some\nway to get off the medication and\nthey'll say like no this is the most\neffective treatment\nso i disagree with a lot of what this gp\nsays i'm pretty sure the evidence backs\nme up better than it backs the gp up\nwe'll talk about that for a second but\nwhat i'd love to do is talk to you all\ntoday about what medication dependence\nmeans\nis it okay is it not okay and how people\nwind up\nbeing dependent\non medication\nand is that scary\nso the first thing to understand is that\nthe reason we prescribe medication\nis to sustainably help people\nright so i'm going to ask you all a\nquestion\nlet's say\ni have a heart transplant and as part of\nmy heart transplant i have to take\nimmunosuppressive medication every\nsingle day\nwhy do i have to take immunosuppressant\nmedication so let's do a quick\njaunt into physiology and transplant\nrejection not what y'all were expecting\ntoday but let's explain this principle\nso i have a body my body has an immune\nsystem my immune system learns what is\nme and what is not me\nand then what the immune system does is\nstarts to attack\nthings that are not meat right pretty\neasy\nturns out that i got a bum ticker and i\nneed a heart transplant\nso what i'm gonna do is i'm going to get\na heart transplant and in order for my\nimmune system to not destroy the\ntransplanted heart because it comes from\nanother person\ni have to take immunosuppressive\nmedication\nnow this begs the question am i now\ndependent\non immunosuppressive medication\nlike sort of right i'm not\ni mean like i guess i could stop taking\nit it's just that\nso this is the key thing to understand\nmedication is there to accomplish a\nparticular goal\nthat's really the the beginning and the\nend of it right we'll add a little bit\nof nuance in a second\nbut in terms of like whether you're\ngoing to become quote-unquote dependent\non a particular psychiatric medication\nthe first question is is it doing what\nit's supposed to do and do you want it\nto continue doing what it's supposed to\ndo\nso when people take an antidepressant\nmedication or anti-anxiety medication\nfor example they're like do i have to be\non this the rest of my life that's\nusually like one of the earliest\nquestions they ask the short answer is\nyou don't have to be and we'll get to\nthat in a second\nbut this is where i'd say the purpose of\nmedication whether it's cholesterol\nmedication immunosuppressive medication\nweight loss medication or adhd\nmedication or depression medication the\ngoal is the same\nit's to try to keep you healthy\nnow just like with many of those\nmedications\nif you do particular things as a patient\nyou will no longer need the medication\nto do that to do that job for you\nso let's say i have type 2 diabetes\nwhich means that due to the number of\nadipocytes or fat cells that i have in\nmy body this is an oversimplification\nmy body has become resistant to insulin\nand so since it's resistant to insulin i\ncan take certain medications that will\nincrease my insulin sensitivity fix the\nproblem\nand what i can also do is adjust my diet\nreduce my the level of my adipocytes\nright start to exercise and do other\nkinds of physiologic things that make it\nso that i no longer need the medication\nso am i going to be dependent on this\nmedication for the rest of my life well\nthat depends on my other behaviors and\nwhat else i do\nso let's talk a little bit about adhd\nmedication so do people become dependent\non it so some people with adhd require\nmedication on a daily basis\ngenerally speaking stimulant medication\nfor most people that are prescribed for\nadhd i will actually recommend it on a\ndaily basis\nso the goal with people with adhd is\ngenerally speaking the adhd kind of\nscrews up their life\nright if i go to work every day and i\nneed to pay attention every day\ni don't want to be like missing some\ndays and be like okay other days\nlike if i show up three hours late to\nwork\nonce a month because i didn't take my\nadhd medication every single day like\ni'm gonna lose my job\nso what i found as a as a psychiatrist\nworking with people with adhd is you\ncan't afford to have adhd\nyou know\n20 of the time like you can't treat 80\nof it you're still going to get screwed\nif you like you're 24 like if your adhd\nis like active 20 of the time there are\nsome cases where for example like if\npeople don't need it for work what\nthey'll do is they'll like not take\ntheir adhd medication on the weekends or\nthings like that there are individual\nplans that you can kind of come up with\nbut it's okay to take adhd medication\nevery single day\ndoes that build dependence\nbefore we go on so people are asking\nabout weekends so like here's the thing\nsometimes you need your adhd medication\non the weekend as well why because you\nhave to do all the crap that you don't\nget to do during the week on the weekend\nlike you got to do laundry you got to\npick up groceries you got to drop off\npackages to return to amazon you got to\nyou know\npick up birthday cards you got to be on\ntime to social events so it's fine to\nuse my adhd medication every single day\nso does that mean you become dependent\nwell there's two issues to consider with\nadhd medication the first is that there\nmay be a physiologic dependence so this\nis neither good nor bad it's not a value\njudgment it just means that if your body\ndevelops a physiologic tolerance and\ndependence on a particular chemical\nsubstance that means if you don't take\nit you're going to have withdrawal\nsymptoms and that could be bad\nso we develop different kinds of you\nknow symptoms\nwith adh i mean different kinds of\ntolerance with adhd medications that's\nnot necessarily a bad thing it's just\nsomething that you need to be aware of\nalmost from a safety standpoint so\nthat's where like we can become\ndependent on caffeine is that does that\nmean that morally we're bad people and\nwe're addicts\nnot necessarily it just means that if\nyou don't have caffeine you may have a\nheadache that's it it's just to\nunderstand the physiology of it\nnow the second thing about dependence is\ndo i have to take this medication for\nthe rest of my life\nthat's what basically people are asking\nwhen they they're saying\nam i dependent on this medication\nand that's where\nthat depends\nit depends and then you may say well dr\nk that's weird like well how can you say\nthat depends what does it depend on\njust like any other medical illness or\nnot any but many other medical illnesses\nhow long you need to be on medication\nthe dose of the medication that all\ndepends on what else you are willing to\ndo as a patient\nso let's go back to our diabetes example\nif i start exercising every day if i eat\nlow glycemic index foods\nif i start\nyou know doing other particular things\nlike doing yoga or other practices that\nsupport type 2 diabetes and stuff like\nthat\nthen i may not need to be on the\nmedication for the rest of my life right\nso if i can like get to where i need to\ngo without the medication then i won't\nbe dependent on the medication i won't\nneed it\nso the question is okay what does that\nmean for adhd what's the equivalent of\neating healthy and exercising for adhd\nfirst of all eating healthy and\nexercising both do help adhd we go into\nsome of that stuff in the guide that\nwe've got hopefully coming out in about\na month on adhd so we'll go over a lot\nof different treatment options and stuff\nlike that in more detail\nthe key thing to remember about adhd\nlet's talk about science okay what does\nthe evidence-based data suggest\nso first thing that evidence-based data\nsuggests is that medication and\npsychotherapy are equally effective\nroughly in terms of effect size what\ndoes that mean\nthat means that if i have a hundred\npeople with adhd and i put 50 of them\ninto psychotherapy and 50 of them into\nmedication\nor give them medication the symptom\nreduction that they get in terms of of\nadhd is the same\nokay you actually don't need a pill you\ncan just go to therapy and you will get\nroughly the same effect size\nnow people may ask like how do you get\ntherapy for adhd it gets complicated\nthere's also a bunch of info on this in\nthe guide but basically a lot of the\npsychotherapy for adhd is developing\nstructures and systems\nto account for your adhd essentially\nputting up guard rails so that your adhd\ndoes not negatively impact your life it\nis literally teaching people things like\nhow to organize how to prioritize how to\nset alarms how to set reminders we go\ninto a lot of detail about how to\ndevelop a good organizational system in\nthe guide\nbut it teaches people these kinds of\nskills\nand so just like any other psychiatric\nillness there are certain skills\nyou can learn\nthat will mitigate or prevent the\nillness from harming you so a simple\nexample of that is anxiety and\nmeditation so if i have an anxiety\ndisorder and i'm feeling very anxious\nand i learn to meditate\nthat can reduce the symptoms of anxiety\nand reduce my quote-unquote dependence\non anxiety medication\nadhd is no different we can learn\nparticular skills that's what\npsychotherapy teaches us\nnow here's where the data gets\ninteresting\nso when you take people who have been\ngiven psychotherapy and people who have\nbeen given\nadhd medication\neffect size is roughly the same\ndifference\nis duration of benefit\nafter ending treatment\nhere's where the dependence comes in\nso when i take adhd medication if i stop\nthe adhd medication i'm more likely to\ngo back to square one\nwhereas the cool thing about\npsychotherapy is if i do psychotherapy\nfor let's say 20 weeks\nand i'm done seeing my psychotherapist\ni will still get the benefit of that\ntherapy for a year two years maybe even\nthree years or even somewhat quote\nunquote permanently depends on the\nperson\nbut what we know is that the benefits of\nadhd medication even last after you've\ndone taking the medication\nso people will still get positive\nbenefits for six months nine months\nafter stopping medication\nso their symptoms don't return back to\nnormal right away necessarily over long\nyou know large populations and\nlongitudinal studies so the duration of\npsychotherapy far outweighs the duration\nof medication which is an important\nconsideration so when people ask me am i\ngoing to be on medication for the rest\nof my life it's like well that depends\non whether you develop an organizational\nsystem that will protect you from your\nadhd and if you can learn how to\norganize if you can learn how to\nprioritize if you learn all these things\nchances are you don't need medication\nnext point so the gp said stimulant\nmedication works the best\nso there's something really tricky about\nstimulant medication which is not\nnecessarily that it works the best so\nthere are head-to-head studies that show\nthat non-stimulant medications and\nstimulant medications basically work the\nsame in terms of the effect size\nthe big difference between stimulant and\nnon-stimulant medication is first of all\nstimulants work faster than\nnon-stimulants\nso there's a medication called bupropion\nfor example that is just about as\neffective as stimulants the difference\nis that bupropion takes like a month\nto really kick in\nwhereas stimulants you'll feel the\nbenefit within 24 48 or 72 hours\nso stimulants are better in terms of\nacting fast but they don't necessarily\nwork they don't reduce your adhd\nsymptoms more than non-stimulant\nmedications on the whole\nthe second thing about stimulants that\nmakes them feel like they work the best\nand i'm not surprised to hear that from\na gp\nis that patients think they work the\nbest\nso there's a very simple principle in\nour brain\nthat the more rapid the reinforcement\nthe more\nbehavioral\nreinforcement we see sorry the more\nrapid the benefit the more behavioral\nreinforcement we see so for example like\nstimulants work instantly so what\nhappens from a patient perspective is\npatients will tell you stimulants work\nthe best for me nothing else works and\nwhy do they say that it's because they\nnotice the benefit immediately whereas\nnon-stimulant medication takes days or\nweeks to really kick in so people don't\nnotice it but if you actually do studies\nwhere i take 100 people on stimulant\nmedication 100 people on non-stimulant\nmedication and i measure objectively how\nbad their adhd is\nlet's say three months after they\nstarted medication what i'm going to\nfind is they're both equally effective\nbut the subjective experience\nof the two patients is going to be very\nvery different\nthe subjective experience is going to be\nany day i miss my medication with adh\nwith a stimulant people notice it right\naway\nso there isn't a difference in efficacy\nwhat there is is a difference in sort of\nnoticing or kind of like an awareness\nbias where you can really feel the\ndifference of the medication whereas\nwhen you're on a slower acting\nmedication you don't quite feel it as\nmuch\nso that's part of the reason why people\nsay stimulants quote unquote work the\nbest i don't think they actually the\ndata suggest that they don't work\nsubstantially better than non-stimulants\nit's just the difference is a lot more\nnoticeable\nand therefore is much more likely to\nreinforce the behavior\nright\nso a lot of people are genuinely\nconcerned about am i going to be\ndependent\non my adhd medication\nand like\nthe answer is maybe right so what we\nwhat i tend to see as a clinician is\nthat\na lot of people\nwill find it very convenient to just\ntake a medication every day because they\ndon't have the time or the energy or\nwhere with all to learn organization\nprioritization whatever especially if\nwe're talking about like people who are\nstudents right so sometimes like\ni'll get someone who's like a sophomore\nwho's coming in during midterms\nand they're like\nyou know you could teach me organization\nand planning\nbut in the two months it takes me to\nlike figure out how to use a calendar\neffectively like my midterms are going\nto be gone and i'll have failed them\nso sometimes people will need medication\nbecause it's the easiest thing to do now\nhow dependent to on it you become\nnot just from a physiologic perspective\nbut we're talking like long term do you\nneed to take a medication for the rest\nof your life the answer is that depends\nit depends on the severity of your adhd\nit depends on what other kinds of things\nyou're willing to try so we also know\nfor example that meditation strengthens\nfrontal lobe function\nand the goal is going to be over time to\nlike real literally like reduce your\nmind's distractibility through practices\nlike meditation the more of that kind of\nstuff you do\nthe less dependent you're going to\nbecome on your medication\nand the last thing about people sort of\nsaying stimulants work best well i think\nthey work fastest and they work most\nnoticeably\nbut fastest and most noticeable does not\ntechnically mean best but it oftentimes\nlooks like best\nbecause think about it from the gp's\nperspective when i give someone a\nnon-stimulant medication they come back\nin two weeks and they say the medication\nisn't working i'm still having problems\nthen as a general practitioner i switch\nthem from a non-stimulant to a stimulant\nthey call me the next day and they're\nlike this medication has changed my life\nand so then as a gp i don't blame the gp\nfor you know they can't stay experts and\neverything\nyou know i don't blame them but they'll\nsort of say like oh okay like so it\nseems like stimulants work better and\nthen then what ha what happens is gp is\nthe next time someone comes in with adhd\ni just start them on the stimulant\nand then i don't ever hear from them\nagain except when it's time for refill i\nask them how's the medication working\nthey say it's working great\nso these kinds of biases not really the\ngps fault in a sense\nright because they can there's very\nnatural ways why gps will get to that\nconclusion\nlast thing that i i kind of want to say\nis that if your doctor uses terms with\nyou\nthat you don't understand or terrify you\nlike they say like oh yeah you're\ndependent on this by the way\nthat may mean something different from\nto them than it does to you and if your\ndoctor says things that scare you ask\nthem to explain themselves be like what\ndo you mean by that\nwhat does that mean what are the\nimplications of being dependent on adhd\nmedication\nis this a bad thing\nlike what do i do about it second thing\nis by all means get a second opinion if\na doctor is not talking to you enough\nif they are not explaining things enough\nthen by all means get a second opinion\nexplain to them that you need more\nexplanation\nand also like by all means go see a\nspecialist\nso someone's asking how does one's life\nlie 2915 is asking how does one's life\nchange if they get diagnosed with adhd\nchances are their life gets\nsubstantially better so that's kind of a\nweird thing to say\nbecause remember getting diagnosed with\nadhd or not getting diagnosed like you\nhave the adhd whether it's diagnosed or\nnot it's affecting you whether you have\nthe adhd or i mean whether you get to\nhave the diagnosis or not you've got\nadhd either way it's impairing your\nfunction whether you have a diagnosis or\ndon't have a diagnosis\nthe only thing that the diagnosis is\nhopefully the main thing that the\ndiagnosis does is gives you the\nopportunity to do something about it\nengage in treatment\nnow what we do know\nis that living a life of untreated adhd\nleads to all kinds of problems we've\nprobably got a lecture that we're going\nto share with y'all in about a week or\ntwo\nabout this about the adhd iceberg\nbut for example\nwe know that something like 50 to 70\npercent of people with adhd\nno\nlet me think about this\nstatistic that sounds high even to me i\nthink i may be misquoting this but\nif you look at the comorbidity of adhd\nand depression\nthree three to five percent of people\nwith depression will grow up to later be\ndiagnosed with adhd\nbut of the people who have both\n50 to 70 of people with adhd will be\nwill\ngr also have depression later in life\nfor that comorbid population so what\ndoes that mean does that mean that if\nyou've got adhd you have a 50 chance of\ngetting depression no there's four\npeople who have both\nif you take that subset of people who\nalready have both what you see is that\nthere is a causal relationship\nbetween\nadhd leading to depression\nand it doesn't go the other way it's not\njust correlated\none causes the other and why is that\nit's because growing up\nwith adhd especially untreated adhd\nshapes your life to be depressed later\nso i'll give you a simple example of\nthis very fascinating study\nthat found that kids with adhd\nare less likely to be invited to\nbirthday parties\nthan neurotypical kids\nthink about that for a second\nso if i'm an adhd kid why does it mean\ni'm gonna be less less likely to be\ninvited it's because i don't pay\nattention\nso all the other kids are talking about\npokemon cards\nand i start randomly talking about\nsomething that's completely unrelated\nand the kids all look at me like i'm\nweird\nbecause i'm highly distractible i can't\nkeep pace with the conversation\ni also don't pay attention when they're\ntalking to me\nright so over time like those kids\naren't going to want to invite me to\ntheir their birthday party\nand then over time if i stop getting\ninvited to birthday parties what does\nthat mean for the development of my\nsocial skills\ni don't get opportunities\nto like develop my social skills because\ni get invited less\ncan't level up if you don't zone into\nwhere the fighting is right like you\ncan't get any xp if you're not invited\nto the game\nand so over time kids with adhd\nexperience more social isolation and\nloneliness\nrusty social skills\nwhich in turn makes it harder for them\nto get promoted at work because a lot of\ngetting promoted at work has to do with\nsocial skills\nand so what we tend to see with kids\nwith adhd especially when it's\nundiagnosed and untreated\nis that\nliving a life of undiagnosed adhd\npredisposes you to depression\nthrough features like under performance\nof academic uh underperforming in an\nacademic sense so it's under achievement\nacademically for kids with adhd there's\nlack of social opportunities\nwhich leads to isolation and loneliness\nthere are all these different factors\nwhere you can almost this is what we do\nin in the lecture that there's a whole\nlecture about this and\ndr k's guide to adhd and doing stuff\nwhere you can map it out\nhow growing up with adhd leads to\nparticular factors which later in life\nlead to depression because what adhd\ndoes is all of these factors over here\nare risk factors for depression later in\nlife\nso hopefully getting diagnosed changes\nyour life for the better\nyou"
