    "transcript": "if he was still level one he would have\nsaid yes but and then he would have\ngiven us some reasoning\nbut he went forward because he said yes\nbut Society tells me not to feel that\nway which is like Pro you'll see the\ndifference there sorry for the delay\ntoday we I ran into some technical\ndifficulties with stream Labs but\nuh\naren't they fun you know what the most\nbizarre thing is is that despite the\nfact that like we do this so many times\nat like a week\nthings just break\nlike I don't understand it at all\nit's like when I load up a video game It\ngenerally speaking works the same every\nsingle time right when I load up my\nemail it works the same every single\ntime\nbut when it comes to the streaming stuff\nit's like oh this token is expired and\nthis has happened and this has happened\nand this has happened\nthank you for letting me know they\nshould be able to hear the group through\naudio now\nokay I'm speaking words so maybe people\ncan hopefully hear us they don't get to\nhear you only I get to hear you I I\nthink it's true\nlaughs\nokay so my least favorite thing in\nstreaming to have to deal with uh issues\nI know\nyeah anyways so I I wanted to offer a\ncouple of thoughts today so we've got a\ncouple of choices so one is I think\nwe've got a couple people that aren't\nable to make it I don't think Ash or\nKathy I think is able to make it today\num maybe Kathy will be in later I know\nAsh for sure can't make it but\num so I had a couple of questions for\ny'all\nuh one is that I understand that there's\nbeen a lot of\nspecifically twitch related drama\nrecently\nand so I thought this could be an\nopportunity first of all because we're\nmissing a couple people that you know\nwe've got homework and stuff so we can\nkind of dive into what we were talking\nabout share a little bit about who we\ndiscovered about who we are things like\nthat\num we can also kind of go maybe\npotentially a little bit deeper with\nlike one or two people today because\nthere aren't as many people here so we\ncan kind of use that as an opportunity\nthe other thing that we can do is sort\nof table our standard work\nand talk a little bit about not not to\ncomment on the drama unless you all\nreally feel impelled to but I think like\nwe could use this kind of as an\neducational opportunity to talk a little\nbit about what it's like to be a\nstreamer what it's like to get caught up\nin drama you know and just sort of talk\nalmost from like a you know from a\ncontent creator perspective on a meta\nlevel about like what is it like why is\nthis hard why does this happen like try\nto understand the phenomenon\num there are also some interesting\nlearnings from science\nright about how people behave online and\nthings like that so we can sort of learn\na little bit about\nusers and commenters and and things like\nthat towards the end so I'm going to\nkind of leave it up to the group we can\nyou know do check-ins and then sort of\npick something\nhow do people feel\nI'm ambivalent you know like uh I'm down\nfor whatever I did my homework so I'm\nprepared to do that if we need to and\nthen um if we want to talk about like\nour perspective on things that have\nhappened like\nsure uh I'm down for that as well like I\nthink it's yeah it's kind of interesting\nI think uh to talk about but that said\nlike you know I'm I'm I don't care what\nwe talk about\nI'm also kind of Middle Ground like uh\nsame thing as all for me at least\nokay\nyeah I'm kind of the same I was just\nsaying I am\nI haven't paid attention to any of it so\nI'm like I've kind of yeah so neither\nhave I Ruby and I wasn't suggesting that\nwe like offer our opinions on what's\nHappening I was more saying like we\nshould we could use this as an\nopportunity to talk about in general\ndrama and what it's like as a content\ncreator I don't think we should be I\nmean if you all want to I guess that's\nokay but I'm not interested in sort of\nsaying oh this person said this and I\nthink this is a good idea and I think\nthis is that's not it's more like as\ncontent creators we sometimes get\nwrapped up in drama and like how do you\nexperience that how do you deal with\nthat what what what's its what it what\nis it like\num and are there any learnings about\nyou know how we can manage that stuff in\na healthy way but\nit you know if\nI'm not suggesting I don't know I yeah I\nknow I got it I I'd be interested\nbecause uh I don't know if because we\nhave people missing from the group and\nso we don't have a way of gauging\nwhether or not they've done their\nhomework if they want to eventually\nCircle back around and share the\nhomework that they did but then\ndepending on how this session goes there\ncould be more homework so I don't know\nif we wanted to go ahead and like\nI don't know talk about navigating that\nas a Creator or if we did want to go\nahead and like still you know the three\nof us share our homework at least and\nthen uh I don't know if we dive into\nthat conversation then I don't know if\nthings end up needing to Pivot somewhere\nwe could always go to that conversation\ntoo cool yeah\nyeah it sounds like an interesting thing\nfor me because I have a whole\num I guess I have my whole own mindset\nabout drama and stuff\num\nso I I think if we go the homework route\nand continue our current topic I think\nthat's actually totally fine\nif people did do it or didn't do it we\ncan absolutely Loop them in and one of\nthe consequences of group work is that\npeople will miss stuff it's actually\nreally interesting because\nwhen people Miss stuff\nwhat we actually see is that that is\nreally good in a weird way for the\npeople who didn't miss stuff because\nthen what happens is it reinforces\nwhatever we're going to learn today when\ny'all sort of step into essentially my\nshoes and run the show for the people\nwho are coming in later\nif that kind of makes sense\nright so it's it's really bizarre but\nwhat we actually find is that when\nthere's some people who are here and\nsome people who are catching up as long\nas y'all do the catching them up\nthat leads to positive outcomes for you\nso if you all want to do that I'm not\nhearing a whole lot of enthusiasm about\ntalking about drama or dealing with that\nso\num yeah I'm indifferent about it so yeah\nI'll talk but like\nyeah go ahead Ruby no yeah I'm the same\nI'm like indifferent about it\num\nI guess I feel like I don't have much to\ntalk about it but then I guess we'll\nthe conversation might grow something\nreally interesting as well like sure you\nnever know\nI've had my fair share of drops so like\nI'd be interested but at the same time\nlike you know I I defer to the group I I\nlike my perspective on this is like I\ndon't know what is either most\neducational for people or more helpful\nfor people so like it's hard for me to\noffer a direct opinion I guess yeah okay\nSal so I'm gonna reframe the question\nwhat is the most who are we here for\nyeah so I'm gonna ask y'all everyone\nelse what's gonna help you\nit sounds like just talking about the\nhomework might be more helpful\nconsidering okay let's do what things\nare with yeah so very important lesson\nto learn as content creators\nsometimes [ __ ] happens\nand\nit's easy to get distracted by it\nSometimes the best thing to do is ignore\nit and focus on what you're already\nworking on\ncontinue to like focus on your own\ngrowth as a person and if it needs to be\naddressed we can address it but like I\nthink this is actually a really valuable\nlesson\nokay so let's check in and share the\nhomework do you all need a quick summary\nof what the homework was\nI've got it okay we we got it okay so\nlet's share let's share for people who\ndon't remember who are like listening so\nwhat was the homework sure\nso we were asked to write a page\num to The Prompt essentially how do you\nfeel about yourself\num and\nlike it doesn't just stop there though\nbecause as we did this you know\nexercises we wrote about how we felt\nabout ourselves\num you know it's important to recognize\nthat sometimes we'll have thoughts while\nwe're writing stuff down about like\nmaybe what we don't want to write down\nso it was important for us to also while\nanswering this question on a second page\nwriting out these thoughts that come up\nas we answer the question\nright that's kind of weird and met up\nbut sometimes when we're writing about\nourselves or journaling we will have\njudgmental thoughts\nand if we really want to understand how\nour mind works\na lot of what causes us difficulty are\nthe reflexive judgmental thoughts that\nwe have in response to ourself\nand to capture those thoughts because\nit's like oh like you know I got a B\nplus\nwhy didn't you get an A\nright and where does that that's that\nnegative self-talk and we'll see how\nmuch of it is a negative or not but\ngreat\nand just to give a little bit more\ncontext this was kind of in the context\nof\nas content creators you all have to make\ndecisions\nsometimes it's hard to make decisions so\nsome of you all have shared a little bit\nabout things like work work balance like\nhow much do I become a streamer versus\nlike focus on my job\nand in terms of navigating life we need\na good internal compass in the absence\nof a good internal Compass we tend to be\nguided by analytics metrics and other\nkinds of like other crap that can be\nuseful\nbut once we start really living our life\nfor the sake of the numbers it leads to\na lot of suffering so a big part of\nfiguring out okay what's the right\nanswer for me involves figuring out who\nam I\nand so that's why hopefully this is\ngoing to be an important step to\nfiguring out okay how do I become a\nsuccessful content creator how do I have\na fulfilling life as a content creator\nwe got to start with who is the me who\nis the i in that\nokay so who's going to check in and\nshare so let's check in a little bit\nabout how you're doing\num and then you know takeaways from the\nhomework or what your experience was\nlike in doing it\num yeah\nyeah so\num I've actually had\nhalf of this week off which is unlike me\nbut I decided to book a last minute\ntattoo appointment and got tattooed for\n12 hours\n[Laughter]\num\nto cover up an old tattoo that was kind\nof carrying around some some weight\non me\num\nand yeah I started a a New Journey with\nthat I feel excited exhausted and\nouchy but I'm really excited like\nyou don't realize somehow sometimes like\nit's gonna sound really weird but I said\nto my friend like I had a little cry\nwhen I booked the appointment because\nyou don't realize how much you're kind\nof carrying around\nattached to something you know um\nwhether it's an object or a tattoo or\nyou know\num so yeah I've done that\nI've been pretty tired not felt too\nstressed about taking that time\naway from stream\nthough I am streaming extra to make up\nfor it\nbut I think that's something like I\nalways feel like if you're gonna treat\nstreaming like a job and it is your job\nand you have respect for the people that\nwatch you and the people that support\nyou and you I don't know I try and treat\nit like that because\npart of me feels like if I didn't then\nI'm just gonna get slacker and slacker\nand like let myself off\num but also\nyeah I didn't stream for four days in a\nrow which\nfor me is crazy\num\nbut yeah generally I'm all right and\nfrom the homework\nI learned this like me and Zell were\nkind of having a little mini\nconversation before we came in that we\nyou I wrote my page about how I feel\nabout myself then I wrote what like the\nthoughts that came in and then it's\nalmost like you can make another page\nit's like and you can keep on going like\nfor an example like\none of the just the really random ones\nwhich kept going further was um I feel I\nhave a lot more to give and then I wrote\nbut why am I always giving and then I\nwrote but then this feels selfish and\nthen I was like going on this whole like\nconversation with myself\num\nso yeah I found it very interesting I\nfound the first page really hard to\nwrite it almost felt like when someone\nsays can you write a bio about yourself\nin third person\num it felt really like\nhard for a minute I had to\ntake away any distracting sounds or\nanything like away from me to try and\nfocus in on\nme and how I feel about myself I spend a\nlot of my alone time\num detaching from self in a way with\nmeditation and stuff so\num\nI know a lot of like stuff is about like\nhonoring your feelings as well but\nI found it yeah quite hard and\num I actually wrote on like my second\npage I used to be able to\nsay how I felt about myself when I was\nin a bad place I used to be able to say\nI'm lazy I'm ugly I'm a terrible person\nlike I used to say some really horrible\nthings about myself\nbut now\nI'm in a better place with my mental\nhealth\nit's I find I can't just say hey I'm\ngreat like I'm a brilliant person I'm\nfantastic I'm it's\nit's almost I yeah I found the exercise\nreally interesting for that black and\nwhite kind of mindset of\nwhen I was very depressed and and\nstruggling\num\nI would yeah I'd say really horrible\nthings about myself which I dare not say\nnow and if I do find myself\nfeeling it\nI\nknow the attachment and everything that\ncomes with that and the spiral that can\ncome with that one thought\nand\ncan\ntalk myself back out of it but I still\ndon't sit there and say no but you're\ngreat you're the best so yeah it was a\nreally\num that's almost like that toxic\npositivity that we were talking about as\nwell so yeah I found it really hard\nbecause I don't have that black and\nwhite perspective on myself\nlike I used to so yeah that's how I got\non\nawesome thank you for sharing\nI everything you said I was like yup\nthat's me too I know right I feel it my\nbrain is a thousand percent filled with\nlike absolute copium juice where like I\nsay something and then the next part of\nmy brain goes but you did you mean that\nand then the third part of my brain goes\nwell did you and like it folds on itself\nlike infinitely and then I just drop\ninto a loop of like\nwhat am I even trying to say anymore\nwhat do I feel about myself I find\nmyself like going back to my initial\nstatement and being like that's not true\nI think and\num like I don't know if it's that way\nfor you Ruby too or for you smirky but\nlike when I start to Rabbit Hole myself\ndown these like reflexive thoughts about\nmyself I completely lose where I'm at\nand then I start being like\nwell I don't know how to feel about it\nanymore so like for example for my\nhomework uh when I wrote so my first\nsentence I wrote about myself was I feel\nokay about myself and then my immediate\nreflexive thought was well actually it's\nmore that like Society tells me that I'm\nokay you know like I like financially I\nguess I'm okay\num I have a degree I've had some jobs\nyou know Society tells me oh you're okay\nbut then I thought about it I thought\nthat about uh you know a little more and\nthen I'm like\nwell I'm actually kind of frustrated\nwith myself a lot so even though maybe\nsometimes people you know\nsay we're okay about ourselves and like\nmaybe other things like around us\nenvironmentally tells us that you know\nwe should feel okay about ourselves like\nthe truth comes back to it where I'm\nlike actually I'm actually pretty\nfrustrated with things as is and like\num and I mean this is partially like as\npart of my check-in here like you know\nI'm going through a lot at the moment uh\nso my thoughts are on overdrive this\nweek of all this craziness that happened\non Twitch definitely did not help like I\nthere was a couple times like normally\nI'm I'm a doom scroller I I you know\nlate at night I'm like Twitter you know\nwhatever and I go through and like this\ntime around I was like I've had enough\nof this just through my phone I was like\nI'm going to sleep put on my eye mask\nhere we go like I just I can't I can't I\ncan't deal with and it was like it\nwasn't just like twitch it was like like\nall the different circles that I'm part\nof online like everything is on fire all\neverywhere and so like there's this\nmoment where it's just like I look at my\nphone it's just like you know the um the\ncommunity meme where you like come in\nwith pizza and everything's on fire like\nit was like that on my phone and I'm\njust like yeah I'm not dealing with that\nno see ya um so yeah like\nso in that headspace just to kind of\nDefine how I was going about this like\num to kind of refocus it back to the\nhomework again like I am just generally\nfrustrated at myself I think because I\nfeel like\num you know I don't think I've met my\npotential uh I've done a lot of things\nthat I'm proud of in my past but I don't\nthink they are necessarily all for me uh\nand it's not like something that I can\nown and my reflexive thought is that\nmaybe I myself have misjudged my own\npotential and these things that I feel\nlike I should do you know I'm held back\nby certain things and like you know\nwhether it's like commitment or just\nlike you know I stop grinding things\nbecause I it like stops being fun for me\nor whatever but for whatever reason it\nfeels like I I see the potential that I\nthink that I have and I feel like I can\nmake that step but you sometimes I I\njust I don't know lose interest or\nwhatever\nand then\num\nyeah I guess like uh I'll just go down\nmy notes here\num I'm somebody who lives in my own head\na lot I'm lost in my own thoughts a lot\nuh as we kind of talked about with like\nhaving these thoughts that kind of\ncascade into other thoughts I just\nI get rolled into like a like a tsunami\nof thoughts that just keep rolling\nacross itself and I it makes me I don't\nknow it like it's like sometimes I just\nfeel crazy going through all these\nthoughts and then\num and as a result of it I'm fearful\nabout my own self-awareness as a as a\nresult because I think I'm pretty\nself-aware and when I talk inside my\nhead about these situations I feel like\nI'm taking account my my own\nself-awareness about these you know\neither social situations or like I said\nmy potential and then I I'm so deep in\nmy own thoughts I'm like wait wait wait\nbut like am I actually self-aware do I\nactually know what I'm talking about\nwhen it comes to this stuff and so that\njust starts to get all crazy so in the\nend then my next thing I wrote was like\nI just feel weirder than the average\nperson the older I get the more people I\ntalk to about like my own situation the\nway I think I find that like I I like I\ngrew up thinking like I'm just a normal\nkid you know like I you know I had some\nunusual circumstances growing up that uh\nare not common but then I keep talking\nto people and being like Oh you that\nwasn't normal oh okay\num hmm and then uh I you know again just\nyear after year I talk to more people\nabout these things and I open up and\ntalk about like oh that is also not okay\nJesus and then like you know now I'm you\nknow 30 31 and I'm realizing like oh I\nam like so not normal whatever normal\nmeans that's my reflexive thought was\nlike I you know who knows what the heck\nnormal even means because like we're all\ndifferent but like I feel like\nexceptionally weird and I wonder if that\nlike makes me like\nlike maybe that's why it caused some\nthings in my past that I didn't realize\nlike because I was not normal you know\nso I don't know it like it again it\nCascades into this thing where like I\nthink about all my previous you know\ncircumstances and I think back like the\nway I handled it maybe it would have\nbeen different if I had been less weird\nor whatever so\num and then the last thing I wrote was\njust kind of talking about\num I feel like I have a general\nuh or I guess I feel like I have a weak\nsense of self and uh I feel like I do\nthings because I can and not because of\nlike a sense of like Dharma for example\num it just and like again I I talked\nabout this in previous uh weeks and\nstuff and it's like I again feel like I\nhave this potential in within myself but\nI find that I just do things because\npeople tell me to do it not because I\nwant to do it and then and so in the end\nso my reflexive thought from that was\nthat like I in general I think I just\nfeel kind of empty and like some things\nare just quote unquote easier but I\ncan't tell if it's just because I'm lazy\nor something or it's because that I\nactually do have some kind of natural\nAffinity towards that thing like I can't\ntell the difference and because\neverything that I've done feels like\nthere's always some level of suffering\nthat was needed in order to achieve that\nthing uh and so like I don't know what\nmy affinities are it just kind kind of\nfeels like if I put my head to it I can\ndo it and so like basically\nyeah I just feel like I'm at this point\nin my life where I\ndon't know what I want anymore and like\nI don't know\nwho I am in some ways because like you\nknow like again speaking on like Dharma\nlike this idea that people find their\ncalling or whatever like I have no idea\nif streaming is by calling in like in\nfact a lot of the stuff that happened\nthis week makes me go maybe I'm just not\ncut out to be like is is that like a\npossibility that maybe I'm just not a\ncontent creator in my in like in my\naffinities and like\num\nand so yeah like again the deeper I look\ninto myself the like everything kind of\ncomes full circle and I start to\nquestion everything and then I just get\nlost and then\nyeah so that was my experience writing\nabout myself and uh I know that was a\nlot but yeah\nso I'm gonna kinda ask sort of like a\nread my mind question\nokay\nit's not to use hell\nit's actually the smirky and Ruby\nthis is going to sound kind of weird\nit's sort of like a leaning question too\nso\nI at least\nam surprised to hear Zell say what he\nsaid\nand the reason I'm surprised is because\nI've heard Zell say a lot of stuff\nbut I almost feel like the direction of\nwhat he is saying has changed does that\nresonate with anyone\nlike are you all kind of getting what\nI'm saying or not so much like are you\nall like okay yeah like of course I\nwould say that like of course\nI think I think I know what you're\nsaying that\nI don't know how to explain it and\nyou like that almost seems\nit's like more open and\nwhen I first met like so\neverything seemed like\nyou knew you you had a determination to\nto get to something\nand now it kind of feels like that whole\nthing was\nyeah I could do that but is that what I\nshould be doing\nlike\nsmirky does that resonate with you at\nall\nyeah it's like I don't know it's I don't\nknow it seems very like descriptive and\ndetailed and there's all these different\npossibilities and now it's kind of like\nyou're just like\nI don't know thinking of like all these\ndifferent\nlike doors that you could open\nit's like not this one concrete way but\nit's like\na whole array of possibilities\nto say I feel like Zell could say\nthey're going backpacking for a year\nlike next week and they're gonna go like\nbeautiful right so like I don't know if\ny'all so so here's the thing Zell is\nlike completely different\nfrom where he was in week one I don't\neven know if we realize it\nis that like zella's like I don't even\nknow who I am anymore Zell from week one\ndidn't give a [ __ ] about who he was\nbut it's completely foreign why do we\ncare his Zell's parents ever care I mean\nthis is a little bit unfair right\ncharacterization\nbut like that wasn't\nimportant\nhe shared that with us right what's\nimportant you get a degree you get a job\nyou get paid you had all these\nopportunities and Zell was beating\nhimself up for throwing them away\nhad this podcast at Riot was one of the\nfounding members of OTV success success\nsuccess\noutcomes outcomes outcomes and now he\ndoesn't have outcomes anymore and he's\nlike how do I get back there I regret I\ndon't know if you all remember but I\nregret giving up those opportunities\nbecause who like what it wasn't who am I\nit used to be I almost mixed it up it\nused to be what do I have anymore I\ndon't have anything anymore how do I get\nback to having stuff\ndoes that make sense\nthat was the old cell\nwas like I don't know how this is\nhelping me\nI thought y'all were gonna teach me I'm\nnow being hyper hyperbolic okay he's\nlike what do we do with this like help\nme get back isn't that what we're here\nfor\nand now Zella in a better place like\nsort of he's like I don't even know what\nI want anymore\nI'ma go backpacking for a year because\nreally I think you captured it\nbeautifully\nand then like people are like what the\nhell happened to this guy\nand zelle's like I don't even know if I\nwant to be a content creator anymore\nand in week one he's like how do I get\nback on top\nand this is how we live our lives\nso I want to share something with y'all\nhopefully this will work\ncan you all see this\nlet's see\num I do see it yeah so this is something\nI saw this\nso like this is what I was not expecting\nfrom y'all but I think it's beautiful\nthat as you notice the way your mind\nworks it's a beautiful little\nillustration right you guys just\ndescribed it you have a thought and then\nthat thought gets begets other thoughts\nthe thoughts grow and grow and grow\nsqueeze you and then it's GG\nand I want you all to think for a second\nabout\nthis is the instrument that you this is\nyour bass line This is how you go\nthrough life\nwith like these thoughts and it's like\nhow why would of course Zell is gonna be\nsuffering and confused and directionless\nwhen this is his Baseline like he'd\nthink think about how insane is you guys\nsat down for what 15 minutes 20 minutes\nhalf an hour maybe an hour\nyou did an exercise and it's like what\nis this mess that comes out of your mind\nis it working absolutely because now\nZell is not concerned about how do I get\nto the top the irony is that we'll help\nhim get to the top\nbut it may be a completely different\nMountain from what he was originally\ntrying to climb\nand so when we're like how do I find\nthe zelle's like I don't understand how\nto find Dharma this is how you find\ndharm you start by getting rid of all\nthe crap\nthat even as hell is saying he was like\nI realized that all of the things that I\nstrive for are things that I'm either\ngood at or people told me I could\nsucceed in\nand success is better than failure right\nso I might as well do it\nand then he's confused\nwhy he gives up\nwhy do you all think he gives up why do\nyou think he abandons it why don't you\nthink he makes it stays at the top\nsmirky Ruby\nhe's doing what other people have said\nthat he's good at not work he feels he's\ngood at and this is the pattern yep\nso what this is a very common pattern\nwhen you've got an amazing human being\nwho is told what to do in life\nthey rise to the top and it falls apart\nthey give up they don't have the stamina\nthe staying power\nthey try other things because it's not\nfulfilling\nbut because they've got such a good work\nethic\nthe child of Korean immigrants\nhe knows how to hustle he knows how to\ngrind he doesn't know which direction to\ngo\nso he's kind of like a little toy that\nspins around and then it stops and then\nit starts grinding and grinding and\ngrinding and grinding and until it falls\nover\nit's a story of Zell's life\nI feel like a lot of this is resonating\nwith me too and I haven't even\ngot gone into the homework or checking\nin or anything just yet shocking\nit's almost as if\nwe can learn from each other so please\nsmirky beautiful times I was about to\nsegue to you anyway\noh okay perfect\nyeah we can learn from each other what a\nwild crazy concept\num\nyeah no\num so I I mean\nyeah gazelle like a lot of the things he\nsaid I'm just like yup checks checks\nthis box checks that box like\noh my gosh I have like all these things\nlike I'm you know I I also like ever\nsince I like\ngraduated school and you know got my\ndegree and did that uh it's I kind of\nwrote down uh at one point like how it\nkind of felt like I'd like crossed the\nfinish line and then I just like\ncollapsed at the Finish Line like oh my\ngosh I'm so tired like\nyou can't shake off this tired feeling\nand to this day after several months I\nstill can't shake off this feeling of\nyou know being exhausted and tired and\num just from like a general perspective\nso even though I'm also like feeling\nproud of what I've done proud of the\njourney that I took to get to this point\nit's also like instead of just like\nclimbing back down the mountain it's\njust like you make it to the top and\nthen you keep walking and you just fall\nall the way down it's like that\num that game that they have on like\nPrice is Right or whatever where it's\nlike you make it to the top of you keep\nwalking you just completely fall off\num so I can feel that in you know uh\nsome some of my stuff especially because\nmy journey was kind of with school it\nwas kind of uh messed up with the\npandemic and that kind of got into a\nwhole thing for me\num but\nlong story short\num I you know I was writing all this out\nsome of the Revolution some of the\nrevelations I would have was like or\nsome of the other things I would write\non page two is like oh does what I'm\nsaying even make sense like\nand then I realized oh I mean I'm\nessentially like journaling like it\ndoesn't it doesn't have to necessarily\nmake sense you know there's and I'm\nsomeone who's so like detail-oriented\nand follow everything by the rules\nfollow what Society tells you to do to\nmake you feel okay right and I'm just\nyou know abiding by that but you know\nit's kind and things have to have\nstructure all this but I just kind of\nhave to eventually learn to let that go\nand just like whatever thoughts are in\nmy mind just like getting it out so I\nthink you know this because I wrote down\nlike oh I should find the time to like\nJournal more like this is really cool\nlike I'm learning so much\num\nso uh how I feel about myself uh some\nmore things I wrote\num\nI I kind of wrote down it's easy to feel\nlike a failure and beat myself up over\nlike not being as consistent with you\nknow\neither content or just like live stuff\num because the idea of like oh you have\nto follow a society tells you okay you\ngot your degree now go I don't know get\na job like\ndo you know do do what's pretty much\nexpected of you and me kind of defying\nagainst that as someone who has always\nbeen by the book feels a little\num I guess like\nuh\nintimidating in a sense uh not that I'm\nlike incapable of like doing it but\num diving more into creation for the\ntime being is just a little daunting in\nthat sense\num\nand then I wrote it feels like I have no\nsense of direction for my future and I'm\njust kind of lost like don't know where\nI would go but I guess if I were to like\nbackpack for a year I just\ngo wherever is in front of me or\nsomething like that\num and uh but it's a little difficult\nwhen you know to even pack the bag or to\nget those tasks rolling whenever I'm\ncurrently in a state where I just feel\nso tired I've collapsed and I just\nhaven't gotten back up and or if I try\nto put the effort to get back up I just\nend up falling back down\num and it's been it's been that way for\na long time and it feels a little\nfrustrating in that sense that like\nI you know because I internalize things\nwhere it's like I know that this is\nsomething I can do this idea that I have\nI can put into action like it's it's a\nreally cool thing maybe I should\nconsider doing it and then it's the the\nactual action putting it into motion\nyou know getting some kind of tangible\naction in there I I fail pretty hard at\nactually executing said action and\num like for example with the whole like\nstuff that's happened this week in the\ncontent creation realm and on social\nmedia it's like I have thoughts now I\ndon't necessarily have to share said\nthoughts I don't have to add commentary\ninto said thing\num\nbut I also like limit myself enough to\nthe point where you know\nI feel like I have like good insightful\nthings to share on said thing but then\nyou know I'm just sitting idly by and\nletting others like have the megaphone\nhave the the platform to like share\ntheir voice and even though I recognize\nthat my voice is just as valuable as the\nnext person's it's also like wow like\num I'm just like pulling myself back\nbecause I feel too tired I feel too you\nknow whatever is in my head telling me\nthat I'm like tired or whatever mental\nthing I'm going through\num and then at the same time I also that\nthat causes me to like over contemplate\nI'm very much a con contemplator and\nlike the gears are always turning in my\nhead\nso\num feeling the need to like analyze\nevery detail\num and then that becomes tiring when you\nover analyze and over contemplate so\nit's kind of like a cycle essentially\num and then like right after that I\nwrote suddenly like I love myself for\nwho I am uniquely me like you know\nthere's nothing like truly wrong with me\nand who I am\nand uh\nI don't know I you know I I'm\nit wasn't like the purpose of it wasn't\nto like counteract like the negativity\nwith the positivity or anything it was\njust the next thing that came into my\nhead\num but I did like have a moment where I\nwas like am I am I trying to like be\npositively toxic or toxic positivity or\nwhatever am I trying to like counteract\nit or anything\num but no I was uh not trying to like\nchange the conversation purposely but\nit's just a thought and I wrote it down\nand uh you know it's okay to have like\nflaws it's you know\num but then I wrote but how long is it\nokay for me to be like\nokay with not being okay to be content\nwith being tired for so long like I'm\nlike how how long is it okay for me to\nto feel that way\num\nI and then I wrote I feel like a puzzle\nthat's complex with like a million\npieces and like I can it doesn't have to\nnecessarily be solid but I can put in\nthe effort to like move pieces around\nevery now and then here and there\nwhenever I like have the energy to do so\nbut it doesn't necessarily have to be\nsolved by the end of it and I'm content\nwith that idea\nand then I ended with I feel like I\nshould Journal more so\nthat's that's kind of what I got out of\nit I guess okay\nso I'm gonna go ahead and comment for a\nmoment and then try to give direction if\nthat's okay\nso what I heard from smirky a couple\nthings that I want to point out so the\nfirst is that\nI don't know if you all have realized\nthis but smirky said this thought came\nup right so the the I'm okay\nI'm fine just the way I am whatever\nwhat percentage into the exercise did\nyou uncover that\nlike how far in were you did it happen\nthe beginning middle towards the end\nlike between the middle and the end so\nlet's just say 75 of the way through so\nthat's that's awesome\nright so this is why we write it out\nbecause as you all notice the first half\nis going to be all the crap in your mind\nand then like this is like how the mind\nworks it's cool I love that you guys\ndiscovered this because I wasn't\nplanning on teaching it but maybe we\nwill like we don't know how our mind\nfunctions\nwe almost never watch it and when you\nwatch it you're like holy crap I have a\nthought I have a reaction I have a\nreaction to the reaction I have reaction\nreaction I have reaction reaction it\noverwhelms us and then we're like\nand then we don't do anything\nand it's like\nwe're going through the game of life\nwith the controller unplugged\nit's all these random inputs\nright and then it's like we don't it's\nlike Twitch Plays Pokemon brilliant by\nthe way\nabsolutely and that's what our mind is\nlike\n10 000 neurons\nfiring in response to each other\nright\nand then once we let it all out\nsomething pretty cool floats to the\nsurface hey you're okay and then what\nhappens it starts up again but how long\nare you okay\nyou get one bright point and the mind is\nlike oh [ __ ]\nwe can't have that let's react to it\nit's like that that light's a little too\nbright Let's uh let's address that real\nquick now another thing\nI want to congratulate y'all for\nleveling up\nyou have leveled up\nwe've spent so much time talking about\ntoxic toxic positivity noticing toxic\npositivity\nif we had done this exercise one week\nago or two weeks ago\nand that thought popped up it could have\nbeen toxic positivity smirky wouldn't\nhave known the difference\nhe's confident no this is me\nthis is not a reaction this is an\noriginal thought how the hell does he\nknow I have no idea but he knows and\nhe's right\nyou all see that\nso you can't notice toxic positivity\nor you can't recognize it you can't stop\nit you can't differentiate between\nwhat's authentic talks positivity and\ntoxic positivity unless we like\nliterally like catch it in the ACT which\nwe've been doing now for two weeks\nso congratulations for leveling up\nif we want to make some interesting\nhypotheses\nZell doesn't know what he wants so how\nhas he lived his life\nhe has lived his life based on almost a\nversion of toxic positivity because\npeople have been Hazel I know that you\ndon't know what you want to do but\nyou're so great you should do this\nright you're so good at it and when Zell\nwas like I don't really know what I want\npeople are like that's silly you're\ndoing awesome\nand when Zell is like I don't even know\nif I misjudged my potential\nmaybe my potential was wrong what did\ny'all say\nit's kind of a trick question what did\nyou say\nRuby smirky\nhe may have misjudged his potential\nI'm going to be honest you're gonna have\nto repeat yourself there's a puppy that\njust like scurried over here and is\nunder my feet and it caused a\ndistraction totally\nokay totally\nthat's why we have multiple people in\ngroup\nmade a dangerous statement he said what\nif I misjudged my potential\nI don't know if y'all caught that but he\nwas like what if my potential really\nwasn't High\nand what did y'all say\nbut what we said at the time it's\nbecause you didn't say anything\ntwo weeks ago if Zell said\nwhat if I misjudged my potential what\nwould we have said\nno you're fine yeah no you can\naccomplish so much so\nand then Zelda's like yeah I have the\npotential I was wrong\nlet me bury that thought or feeling and\ngo accomplish something\nthat's what he's been doing his whole\nlife because his parents have been\ntelling him so you have potential you\ncan do it other people have been telling\nhim you're so talented so you can do it\nso zella's like they say I can do it I\nguess that means I should do it\nhmm and then he starts doing it and like\nsmirky said he climbs up the mountain\nand falls over\nyeah\nand then the cycle continues absolutely\nbecause then he's like oh what if I was\nwrong because when you fall to the\nbottom what do you say to yourself\nmaybe I didn't deserve to be at the top\nand then what does everybody else say\nOh no you're fine you should yeah you\nyou deserved it you just need to get\nback up again like it'll just keep doing\nthe same thing yeah\nkeep going\ngood grades fancy degree\nOTV riot games\nthat's how you get that picture\nso now I'm going to ask y'all so if it's\nokay with you I'd like to ask y'all for\nsome permission today I think what we're\ngonna do\nis tunnel into Zell for a little bit\nand what we're going to do is because\nthere is so much similarity between all\nthree of you\nwe're gonna use a very interesting\nprinciple that is true of group work\nwhich is that when you you can't see\nyour own biases but you can see your\nbiases in someone else a lot easier\nand so we're going to Tunnel into Zell a\nlittle bit\nand smirky and Ruby y'all are going to\nbe doing a lot of learning here\nand then you're going to learn about\nyourself huh\nand then I'm ready I'm also going to\nmodel some communication skills so I'm\ngoing to drive for about 15 minutes if\nthat's okay with y'all okay if you feel\nlike you've got a question you pick up\nwhat I'm doing I'm going to lay out what\nI'm gonna do but if you guys pick up\nwhat I'm doing you're free to jump in\nbefore 15 minutes\nbut at the 15 minute Mark I'm going to\nturn it over to you in a very like\nawkward kind of intentional way yes Ruby\ncan I jump in before we start yeah I'll\ntell you what I was zoning out about I\nwas rereading\nI was rereading how I feel about myself\nwhen I realized in every single\nevery single little paragraph I've\nwritten\nthere is a the word others\nlike\nI've realized that I feel about myself\nbased on what\nI believe others\nwould want like\ngiving others too much time but not\ngiving myself that much time\nand so I kind of yeah it relates as well\na bit uh like that's why I was zoning\nout I was connecting the dots with what\nZell was saying and then what I've\nwritten down and\nyeah\nit's a whole thing because like content\ncreators do have to focus on like their\nCommunity they're for others and\noftentimes\nwe can recite of what we need most for\nourselves in that process\nyeah that was like my second page was\nyeah\nso why am I helping others more than\nmyself like then it was like a whole is\nthis selfish thing and I just realized\nthat I'd written others about\nit sounds like a horror movie the others\num oh it is I've written it about five\ntimes on my page like\nI hide how I feel from others just you\nknow because it's easier to hide how I\nfeel and let them be happy and but this\nis meant to be a page about how I feel\nso why did I write that like I'm doing\nit again\nso I'm gonna ask thank you so much for\nsharing Ruby this is sorry how we change\nno literally I love it this is like\nliterally people are always wondering\nhow do you change this is how you change\nso now I'm going to ask smirky and Zell\ndifficult question okay since y'all\nleveled up recently we're gonna see\nit's hard\nwhat do you imagine Ruby is feeling as\nshe connects those dots\nit's I mean i s oh I'll I guess I'll\nbecause it was like a mix of like\nexternally like you're laughing like oh\nhow silly of me to like you know write\nabout you know others but then it's like\nthis whole Revelation\num and I I I don't know if I'm maybe\nincorrectly detecting detecting a\nmixture of like\num like\nwow this is like really exciting to like\ndiscover and I feel absolutely like\nstupid for like\nwriting you know going so far off track\nthat like\nit's not even about how I feel anymore\nand maybe I should so I I don't know\nmaybe there's like a mixture of that in\nthere what do you think\nI was thinking kind of similar in that\nlike it kind of mixed like maybe like\nalmost like Bittersweet a little bit\nwhere like it's awesome that you've\nrealized something but also there's a\nbit of sadness there when you realize\nlike you thought you had this idea of\nyourself that is now being kind of\nchallenged and so you're probably\nyou know yeah I I could imagine being\nlike anytime there's a self-revelation\nlike that I think there's always a\nlittle bit of sadness because you're\nlike oh wow I wasn't as in control of\nmyself as I thought I was and uh that's\nlike simultaneously\nlike scary also because like you're like\nholy cow that's\nI didn't even realize it until now and\nlike it kind of changes your world view\nso yeah I could see it being scary\nexciting but also sad like just a bunch\nof mixtures of things Ruby yeah I I kind\nof had a moment I think a bit like you\ntell the minute ago of like\nI know who I am\nbut when someone asks me to write how I\nfeel\nI don't know how I feel like there's two\ndifferences I know who I am and I know\nwhat means like what I want to do with\nmy life and what means like\nmakes me happy\nbut also\nyeah like I don't know how I feel like\nthat's\nthat's like been Simon different I don't\nknow if you get that like I know what I\nmean in an into what I'm interested in\nand what I want to grow and what I want\nto nourish and who I am but yeah I don't\nknow what I feel sometimes I guess so\none thing that I'd leave you all to kind\nof think about is that Ruby has known\nwho she is and I think that is also in a\ngenerally speaking relatively recent\nbased on what we've heard from her we\nagreed there right like she's been like\non this good path of self-discovery for\na little while\nand what I'm hearing from her is that\nshe's discovered this beautiful person\nbut\nthat's not the person who she's been\nliving for\nright and that's what's sad\nis that on the one hand she is this\nbeautiful person\nbut that's not who comes first for her\nand I think it ties back to what smirky\nwas saying also about being a content\ncreator like we're naturally we start to\nlive for other people\nyeah my last sentence is I'm scared of\nchanging content on stream\num I'm not scared of changing my life\nI'm scared of changing my content which\nis really bizarre but like right and\nyeah by the way I've been there did we\nwhat was by the way I want to say maybe\nit's murky Zell you all can help me with\nthis she's scared of changing her\ncontent right because it probably is\ngonna do poorly if she changes\nand I remember something didn't she say\nsomething about making an Instagram\nshort or something or a real I totally\nwait for it to come Crashing Down\nnope Ruby no talking\nit's for Zell and smirky\ndidn't she say something about not\ncaring about what content she makes or\nsomething and doing something from the\nheart\nand what happened to that that content\nthat she made\ndid well\nweird\nbut isn't that what she should be afraid\nof\nbecause if she doesn't calculate\nhuh interesting\nso we'll play around with that we'll\ncome back to it thank you so much for\nsharing Ruby anyone else have kind of\nthoughts about this topic before we kind\nof shift back this out\nokay your thoughts\nall righty\nso I'm gonna I'm gonna lay out a couple\nof techniques that we're gonna use on\nZell okay\nso first we've learned a couple of these\nbefore so when Zell makes an ambiguous\nstatement\nokay when he makes an ambiguous\nstatement we're gonna ask him a question\nabout it\nall the stuff that he's figured out on\nhis own he's already explained really\nwell\nright so we're not gonna actually ask\nhim about that\nwhat we're going to do is ask him about\nthe things that seem vague\nsecond thing that we're going to do is\nwhen he says something bad about himself\nwe're not gonna\ndisagree with him\nwe're gonna dig into okay help me\nunderstand like where that comes from\nyou know if he's misjudged his potential\nwe're going to ask some questions that\nare hard-hitting and are going to feel\nunusual\nokay because okay so this is the other\nthing we're starting group today\neverything we've been doing before that\nis not real group work it's just like we\nhad to get okay with each other and\nlearn a little bit about each other this\nis the first day\nand I don't know if you all can tell but\nlike we're doing work now we haven't\nbeen doing work we've been pretending to\ndo work\ndo you all feel the difference\nright this is\nyep it's in the field you got past the\nfirst world but there's still like yeah\nthese other worlds first world is\ntutorial\nyep we're in Mario Maker territory now\nokay love it\nso Zell what are you frustrated with\nyourself about\nokay\num good size so\nI'm in it's like where do I start\num\nI guess\nthe\nfirst thing is just\nthis idea of why can I not commit to\nthings\nto hit that perceived potential that I\nsee in myself\num and this relates in many different\nways where like I think I can be a\nreally good I could be a really really\ngood violinist or guitarist and uh I\npractice my instruments and I get really\ngood I put out a you know like an\nInstagram reel playing guitar or\nsomething and then I go okay that's good\nuh you know I don't need to be the best\nguitarist ever even though I think I can\nbe a better guitarist or a violinist I\njust go okay that's good uh I go to\nvideo games and it's like you know I hit\ndiamond and I go oh that's pretty good\nbut like I think I could hit Masters I\nthink I could grind my uh myself further\nand then I go well you know I think I\nthink I that was like good enough I it's\nlike frustrating to try to keep going\nthrough it so like you know what if I\njust go to the next thing and so it's\nkind of this\nthing where I kind of jump ship after I\nhit a certain\nthing but it stops me from really being\ngreat at anything and instead I am like\nI'm like the ultimate master of none you\nknow like I good at like good if not\nlike pretty damn good at a lot of these\nthings but I'm not great at any single\none of them and especially from a\ncontent creator side of things\nyou it is better to be great at a truly\ngreat at one thing and then people come\nto your stream or whatever and then they\nfind out that you're good at these other\nthings that's like a much better model\nfrom my opinion\num and so I felt like\nthis like thing that I keep doing to\nmyself is very frustrating for me\num\nand then the other sort of frustrations\nI have is just\nyeah this I like this feeling of just\nbeing lost all the time like again I\nkind of talked about this before we were\nlike I feel like my brain is like\npermanently on copium juice where like I\njust\nreason with myself to find a solution I\ngo ahead with that solution and then you\nknow again same thing I jump ship when\nI'm like uh I don't know if I want to\nkeep doing this thing uh anymore like\nlet's say let's say the direction I want\nis I'm gonna make YouTube guides for\nthis new Final Fantasy raid that I was\nuh really into and whatever and then the\nraids the guides do great but then I go\nah you know what I think\nI don't even know why actually I don't\nlike if you were to ask me why I stopped\ndoing these things I could not tell you\nconcretely like why I feel like I want\nto stop doing these things and go to the\nnext thing but that's just and that is\nAgain part of that frustration where I\ndon't understand myself and I don't\nunderstand what compels me to do or not\ndo things and so I just do them in order\nto achieve a result and\num I have this habit this is something I\nwas going to tell before too is like\nwhen people talk to me uh people tell me\nthat I sound like I really know what the\nheck I'm doing and it's because my brain\nhas copiumed its way into believing in\nwhat I'm about to do and I you know I'm\ngenerally a thoughtful person so I\nreason with myself to a like a pretty\nlogical degree to where it makes sense\nand then I do it and then I go some\nsomewhere along the way I go it doesn't\nmake sense never mind\num\nso yeah I think uh\nGod I mean\nI I would say those are probably my main\nsources of where\nI'm frustrated\num\nand it all kind of leads back into like\nI don't think I know who I am and I've\nalways\nI've always thought of myself as a\npretty self-aware person as like I feel\nlike I have a general good judge of\ncharacter and I feel like I've judged my\nown character to us you know a pretty\ngood degree but\nhonestly when it comes to all this other\nstuff it makes me\nit makes me wonder if I really know\nmyself at all and that's the scary part\nso yeah man I totally get you so here's\nkind of what I heard\nso the first thing is like you're\nsomeone who\nnever becomes great\nit's you make it to good enough and then\nright when things get tough you kind of\nquit\nand you don't want to quit\nyou want to be great\nbut you don't know why you quit\nlike if you had a good reason\nit would be okay\nbut you don't have a good reason for\nquitting do you sell\nno I reason with myself to say it's a\ngood enough reason but I don't actually\nlike whenever I don't think it is\nyourself\nwhat's it like to\nbe someone's L who\nis never great\nI mean that's the that's the first\nrating part right and I think it sucks\nand because I think I can do it\nbut maybe I can't\nand maybe the reason why manufacture\nthese these like copium uh excuses is\nbecause like and that's where\nI feel like maybe I've misjudged my own\npotential because maybe the people who\nhave judged their own potential can\nbreak through these sort of plateaus\nand yeah so\nso and I think that's scary I think\nthat's that would be it would be it's\nlike I think I would be very scared to\nfind out if I that I had misjudged my\nown potential and\nI actually I'm fearful of both sides I'm\nfearful that I actually do have that\npotential and I'm also fearful that I\nhave misplaced my own judgment of my\npotential\nabsolutely sounds like you're kind of\nscrewed there bro because on the one\nhand if you misjudged your potential\nit means you're kind of a loser all\nalong\nright\nand if you didn't misjudge your\npotential that means you could have done\nit and you didn't\nso it's like your choices are loser or\nfailure\nyeah like I I get this feeling where if\nI'm if I believe in my own potential and\nI believe that I can be good and or\ngreat anything it makes me wonder like\nshould I have to use that noble cause\nright yeah yeah I mean it's like that\nbut I also think like maybe instead of\nthinking about what I like to do maybe I\ncould do something that's like better\nfor the world you know like you know\ninstead of being a content creator what\nif I like worked for a non-profit and\ntried to like you know change the world\nto a better place you know like what if\nI if I have this potential that I think\nlike I could maybe make a bigger change\nin the world or something you know\nsomething more noble and so yeah I don't\nknow all right so I'm gonna ask smirky a\nreally hard question\nhardest question that's ever been asked\nwhat happens if Zell decides to make the\nworld a better place what's going to\nhappen\nI would imagine they might steer away\nfrom\nall the they would steer away from\nthe the content creation thing and\ntherefore all the things that they've\ndone historically is he gonna succeed to\nbe successful I mean only if they uh are\nstill in the headspace of like\nthe definition of success that they had\nwhen they headspace cells in doing that\npotentially\nRuby what are you healing what are you\nseeing and hearing smirky do\nI'm not sure like so so here's I'm gonna\ncome out and say it because I don't\nthink smirky\ncan yet\nit's another Hill he's gonna climb to\nthe top and he's gonna fall down the\nother side\nyeah I wanted to say that like whatever\nzelle does right now is just going to be\nexactly the same because exactly Val\ndoesn't know what they want to do so\nwhether they go if you go into the\ncoffee oh saving the pills yeah I don't\nknow who I am so let me just make the\nworld a better place\nthat'll fix all my problems\nyeah and then you'll be sad that you\ndidn't like become the greatest\nguitarist\nand then if you become the greatest\nguitarist you'll be sad that you didn't\nbecome the best streamer and then if you\nbecome the best streamer you'll be like\noh but\nand then also it sounds like you've got\na fear of success\nlike actually what what if you actually\ndid become the best at the thing you\nchose then what then where\nlike that's kind of like something\nI was wondering why you were saying it\nbecause that wasn't an option in your\nhead like you weren't describing any of\nthat like actually being really good at\nsomething and actually succeeding at it\nlike that wasn't the\npart of your thought process at all like\nthat just then\nyeah I mean it's it's weird because like\nthe things I do choose to do you know I\ndo end up finding some amount of success\nin it but it's never\nit's like never enough\nyou know and then and then once I get to\nthat point yeah I drop off that cliff\nand then I find a new mountain to climb\nto fall off so\ncan I ask like what you're I guess\ndefinition of success is then like\nwhat that looks like to you\ndon't know right I I I don't know I um\nyeah zelle sorry we're gonna run with\nsmirky okay\nso smirky\nzelle's chasing success\nthe idea of it absolutely\nyeah\nso I love your answer because you\nactually answered my next question right\nis he chasing success I was looking for\na yes\nand then I was like what does that look\nlike and you're like\nno one knows\nhe's looking for something that he\ndoesn't even know what it is\nyeah and like\nthere's so many people in the world with\nso many different Visions or ideas of\nwhat success actually is absolutely\nand which of those people\ndoes Zell use is his compass\ngo for itself\nI mean other people all of them\neveryone but you\neveryone but you\nand no wonder we're [ __ ] clueless\nRuby paragraph one others paragraph two\nothers paragraph three others paragraph\nfour others paragraph five others\nwe're all were those all talking about\nthe same thing I would guess not\nright\nso like let's take a moment to think a\nlittle bit about\nyou know for yourself\nright just like pause and like think a\nlittle bit about like for yourself like\nwhat's the success that you're chasing\ndo you even know what it looks like what\nare you really shooting for\nyou know or me I'm I'm shooting for some\nkind of sense of direction with what's\nnext because\nso much of my time was spent in school\nnow that's not where my time has spent\nso where do I spend my time\nright and what's going to happen\nis you can keep looking out here for a\nDirection\nbut like\nthat's why you resonate smirky beautiful\nanalogy of climbing up the mountain and\nflopping over the SSN then what happens\nwhen you fall smirky what's next you say\nto yourself\nyou go find another mountain to climb\nyou fall\nI didn't I didn't hear that you fell\nafter college so you know that was a win\nright so we're still learning even in\nthat way but in the same way that no\nmatter like I forget who said it but\nlike no matter what\nthis is L decides it's going to be wrong\ndo you all see it's because the thought\nprocess is generating the answer the\nthought process is flawed\nyeah Ruby\nI was gonna say something to Zoe when\ncell said\nwhat if like I shouldn't be a content\ncreator and I should go and like work\nfor you like a charity or something\nlike or is like do something that's like\nis being a content creator like I don't\nknow I can't remember your words but\nbasically you're saying is it selfish is\nit like a a selfish like\nPursuit like and I wanted to say and\nwhat's wrong with that and then I\nlaughed to myself\nabout what I'd written down\nand then I didn't say it because I was\njust like\nthis is exactly what we're talking about\nso what I want you all to understand is\npeople are wondering how do I change\nwith a hundred percent confidence I tell\nyou that Ruby just changed\n100 confidence\nI've devoted my life to helping people\nchange it's why I became an addiction\npsychiatrist\npeople don't usually want to be\naddiction psychiatrist because you're\nworking like homeless people in heroin\naddicts\nright\nlike\nI mean a lot of people do because we\nlove the work but\nand and this is this is the thing how do\nyou change you realize there's a part a\npattern of your mind that is absurd and\nthen you laugh at it you're like I'm\nsuch an idiot\nbut you say I'm such an idiot is that\nsaid with shame\nlook at Ruby's face do you all see shame\nright now\nwhat do you see\nI know we don't have good emotional\nvocabulary yet we'll get there\nit's like it's like she's just giddy I\ndon't know it's just elation\nI would say that to somebody else like\nno it's not selfish why are you worrying\nabout like saving the world you're one\nperson you need to be happy before you\ncan even start saving the world like\nyou know you never know you could build\nsuch a great platform that you end up\ndoing all of those things\nand all you've got to do is pursue that\nsounds so simple like all you've got to\ndo is pursue that thing that that makes\nyou happy that makes that you know that\nyou can put your heart into and be\nauthentic with and that you can grow and\nother people can resonate with\nand ignore all this other like\npull from all the other ways but now is\nthat toxic positivity\nmy\nbrain was thinking it might have been so\nmaybe maybe I'm wrong no no it's not\nabout right or wrong it's yeah\nbecause\nso because it was like oh just like do\nwhat makes you happy like that so\nexactly I think that's what Ruby's point\nwas what ruby is saying is this is the\ncrap that people spread as toxic\npositivity yeah it was kind of like a\nfeeling of like oh it's just that easy\nyou just do that thing like but there\nyou go but Zell why don't you think it\nwas toxic positivity because smirk is\nspot on it's exactly the words that\ntoxic positivity uses\nit looks like I was reading like that\nfor me right because we've heard that\nwe've heard Ruby say that like two weeks\nago just believe in yourself\nI mean I think the difference the\ndifference here I mean I forget exactly\nthe way Ruby put it but like you know\nthe the idea of how it comes about like\nthe uh the idea of like self\nauthenticity it wasn't like oh just you\nknow do what feels good man you know go\nfor it it wasn't like but it's more like\nfind that thing that that would allow\nyou to find\nthe next step right and so like because\nwhen I heard Ruby talk the place my mind\nwent to was talking again about the\ninner compass that we talked about and\nlike how I don't have that so I have to\ndiscover that part of myself in order to\napply that next part which is the toxic\npositive part which is like do what\nmakes you feel good well to do that I\nneed to find that inner compass that\ndetermines that defines what the feeling\ngood part is and then from there\nyeah\ny'all see how like zealous\nyou see it\nyep\nI'm not trying to shame him\nno\nZelda are you getting what we're saying\nor did one of them need to illustrate\nuh another cascading thought\nexcellent\nso Sal start somewhere good\nright so I asked him how does it feel to\nbe someone who's never great\nSesame BS\nit sucks more BS\nand it's like where is the real zel in\nthere there's the copium juice on either\nsides it's a copium sandwich\nwith a what is it like it sucks\nright so\nyeah\nis that what other people are telling\nyou\nno\nwhere is that coming from\nlike why other people say that it's okay\nnope where where is the sensation of it\nsucks\noh that's just for me that's just me\nright so you say you don't know who you\nare\nwell you've learned a little bit about\nyourself\nwhich I know is going to sound harsh\nsucks to be you\nso I'm gonna ask you questions though\nand maybe I'm going too far because\ny'all leveled up I got excited we're\ngoing straight from like level one like\nI'm putting y'all against level 10\nmonsters instead of level two monsters\nit's exciting Zell does it suck to be\nyou\nyes but\nSociety tells me I shouldn't feel that\nway okay so y'all saw it right there\nwhat does Zell feel does it suck to be\nhim\nand here comes the copium juice\n[Laughter]\nbecause we touched the actual glass We\nTouch some negative emotion and it's so\n[ __ ] scary\nhe's literally drinking\nright there's the Scorpio juice\nthe guy\ncan't sit\nhe's got did you guys see in his face\nhe's like we all know what the answer is\ndoes it suck to be you and he's like\nyes\nbut\nSociety tells me dude and see he's come\nso far that he didn't give us a BS\nanswer he gave us a reflection he was\nlike oh there's that crap again I don't\nknow if that y'all caught that right\nbecause he says he didn't say he didn't\nif he had\nif he was still level one he would have\nsaid yes but and then he would have\ngiven us some reasoning\nbut he went forward because he said yes\nbut Society tells me not to feel that\nway which is like Pro you'll see the\ndifference there\nif he said yes but I accomplished so\nmuch\nright that would have been like one step\nback\nis that and I don't know if maybe I'm\nexaggerating but like I saw the struggle\nin him there\nright yeah\nso now we're almost at time for the day\nso\nany idea\nany clue\nokay what we can do to help this guy\ndo we believe he sucks do we genuinely\nbelieve that\nno\nright\nso what do we see in him\nthat gives us hope and if we don't have\nhope that's okay to share\nI personally see that\nlike\nI feel like after today that cell wants\nto see something different in himself\nlike something from the story that we've\nheard from the first time I met so\nhas slowly started to change and I feel\nlike\nZell can tell that there's something\nelse there like this they don't know\nwhat it is yet and I don't know what it\nis yet but like yeah so Ruby I'm going\nto ask you say he wants to see something\nelse in himself\nprior today where did he want to see\nchange\nhe prior to today it felt very\num\nthis is what I'm good at this is what I\ncan do this is what I'm gonna make\nhappen this is where I'm I'm gonna go in\nthis direction as a content creator like\nso I'm gonna like\nabsolutely right\nwhere is all that crap\nno yeah now I feel like all of that crap\nis kind of dispersed a little bit oh\nsorry I meant like it's a read my mind\nquestion so I'll just state it so what\nI'm noticing about everything that Ruby\nsaid is it's all out there\nyeah\nright because she was like content\ncreation this this this this this\nsorry I was I asked a really bad\nquestion I apologize\nbecause I realized it was vague because\nwhen I say where you're like well it's\nnot there anymore it's just first\nthat's the progress right\nso I don't know where did it go right so\nit's kind of weird because it's like now\nZell is like he's not looking out there\nhe's looking in here\nand he doesn't like what he sees and\nthere's all this reflexive conditioning\nfor\nlike you know how he responds to it\nso any idea how we can thank you so much\nfor sharing that Ruby I thought it was\nincredibly insightful so any idea what\ncan we do to help this guy poor guy\nright so we believe in him\nand Ruby isn't saying by the way that\nshe believes in him because he had this\npodcast at riot\nright because he was he was this in the\npast\nso her faith in him is coming from where\nsmirky\num\nand it's okay not to I don't know I\ndon't yeah I'm I'm well I'm just not\nsure how to articulate it\nthat's probably where my I don't know\ncomes from okay I don't know how to put\nit into words that's that's totally good\nand I actually really appreciate that\nbecause I I don't know can mean a lot of\ndifferent things\nright I don't know can mean I need some\ntime to think it can mean I don't know\nhow to articulate it it can mean I don't\nknow it can mean I'm uncomfortable\nso do you have a sense murky\nlike\nof\nyou know any way that we can help zel\nanything come to mind it's okay for you\nto say I don't know here as well\nand like not know\nright\num\nI think just like\nlike you've kind of mentioned like you\nknow you've you've had me Ruby like\nthink about like any sort of questions\nto like ask if something's unclear so\nasking questions is always like a a\ngreat start to just keep doing that keep\ninquiring and\nyou know cool taking on that\nresponsibility a little bit absolutely\nright so now here's the cool thing\nso I want you all to just think about\ngoing forward here's the skill\nwhen if the way we're gonna help Zell\ngazelle is looking for answers\nare we going to help Zell by giving him\nanswers\nhow are we going to help him\nI hope he can find answers how are we\ngonna do that\nby asking the right questions making the\nright observations absolutely this is\nthe key thing that people do not get\neveryone is out there looking for\nanswers and what they what we should\ngive them is not answers because when\nsomeone gives you an answer if I say\nsell I'm Dr k\nI will tell you wake up at 6am every\nmorning meditate for five hours make\nyour content\ndo not shower or shave for 45 days it is\na deep spiritual technique and you will\nbe successful\nain't never gonna work\nright because the internet is full of\nanswers\nsign up for this we'll teach you how to\nbe successful hell we even say that\nright\neveryone's offering the Magic Bullet\nhere's the big thing that we've learned\nhelping people find answers is not\ngiving them answers\nhelping people involves asking questions\nmaking observations paying attention\nso going forward\nnext starting next week which you guys\nactually already took over I don't know\nif you noticed but like you all just\ntook over right at the 15 minute Mark\nwhich was fantastic\nright so when someone says something I\nwant you all to pay attention to a\ncouple things first\nis we have an illustration of the\ntoday\nright I don't know like smirky I don't\nknow how to put that into words so what\nI've learned how to do smirky is when I\ncan't put something into worms I just go\nlike this and I just hope that other\npeople understand what on Earth I'm\ntalking about\nit takes a while to figure that out\nbecause it's kind of weird but now we\nknow what this means\nso I want you all to watch out for this\nbecause you're going to see it right and\nnext week if Kathy and Ashen and Metric\nshow up they're not going to have a clue\nso we don't want to be like cliquish\nabout it but I want you all to really\npay attention to notice what is the\nauthentic thing that they're saying and\nwhat's the BS that their mind produces\nand I applaud each and every one of you\nhonestly exceeded my wildest\nexpectations in terms of the\nmeta-analysis of what you learned from\nyour homework\nthe main takeaway you all learned a lot\nof good stuff about who I am\nbut the real thing is I couldn't I\ncouldn't have expected that you would\nhave learned holy crap look at how crazy\nmy mind works\nand now that we've understand what this\nbusiness is now we can get to the\nauthenticity of it\nand then we can dig into that\nbecause here's the thing with Zell\nthe first layer\nof the self is going to be crap\nbecause what's happened is as he's\ngotten disconnected from himself he has\na negative emotion and then he stuffs it\ndown in there and he Stuffs the next one\ndown and the next one down and the next\none down and he goes and climbs another\nmountain and feels better about himself\nthrough accomplishment\nand so what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to like find crap and we're going\nto peel back those layers like an onion\nbut down there there's something good\nand Ruby and smirky have already seen it\nZell maybe is confused he's like it\nmakes sense on paper\nright but he's like\nI don't know what these guys are talking\nabout\nI just have lived my entire life around\nthat right like in many different facets\nof my life you know like I grew up like\nI'm not a social person but I learned\nhow to stuff that down in order to\nsurvive you know and fit in and yeah\nyeah so like it pervades all parts of my\nlife so absolutely right so now at least\nwe realize it\nbecause you're right Zell you were\ntaught you're like I have a weak sense\nof self I don't know who I am that's\nbecause you were taught to ignore Who\nYou Are\nmake sense right like it's not actually\nthat complicated he was just taught we\ndon't\nsell you want something we don't care\nand you shouldn't either\nthis is so true\nI was gonna say when I first met you so\nI thought we had nothing in common and\nafter today\nyou remind me of me\na while back like in my life\nand now I'm just like okay I thought I\nhad nothing in common with someone\nand like you saying about like forcing\nyourself to be social forcing yourself\nto fit in and having look going back\nover these like the conversations or the\nways you went about things because you\ndid things how you thought they should\nbe\nand like\nyeah I just I just thought that was so\ninteresting for me today that I was like\nme and zel could be\nwe were so different when I first met\nyou but now I realize like\nwe've got so much in common in that\nweird\nyou see how it works yeah bizarre\nit's like the more you peel back the\nlayers of false identity and get to the\ncore of what it means to be human the\nmoral like we are\nwhether you're a sound bath yoga teacher\nstreamer or you run a podcast for Riot\ngames which is about as far as you can\nget\nright\nKorean immigrant\nversus Caucasian woman from UK\nyeah\nright like how different is that\nand like oh wow so now Ruby how does it\nfeel\nto like\nfeel this way about Zell\nI'm strangely excited for you sir\nright because like Ruby's like oh [ __ ]\nI've been there\nand I think the reason she's excited is\nbecause she knows that you don't have to\nbe there so she's come some way and she\ncan show you how\nshe's excited for you\nnow this is what's weird about group\nbecause here I am asking Zell zelle does\nit suck to be you and he's like yes but\nand then Ruby somehow winds up feeling\nexcited like what\nif you pay attention you go back and you\nwatch the VOD I was not very nice to\nZell\nright I didn't I'm like oh is that like\ntell me about your dreams bro like you\ncan do it man just believe in yourself\nI was like bro what is it like to never\nbe great\nand like if we ask Zell how did it feel\nwhen I asked those questions like it's\ngonna be like I loved his work\nbittersweet\nlike you don't like getting asked those\nquestions\nbut I think we all agree I don't know\nhow Zell feels we can ask him I suppose\nbut you know like I think we're getting\nsomewhere like we're getting somewhere\nlike Ruby's excited she's like I know\nthis kid now\nI know what's going on smirky's like the\nmountain I've been there I know this guy\nand how do you know him because you've\nbeen there and if we can help Zell we\ncan help ourselves\nRuby shared it with us today\nright she's like oh crap\nI just realized something about myself\nso like today is the first day of group\nnow we have the challenge I have no idea\nhow we're gonna get the rest of them\nhere\nbecause before today and after day is\nlike completely different places\nso we can't expect to pick up here next\nweek it y'all moved fast today we may\nnot get there next week\nso there's going to be some ups and\ndowns but hopefully all we're paying\nattention I'll summarize the techniques\nand stuff that we use but I think smirky\nbasically got it right we're gonna ask\nquestions\nlook for this\npay attention to this and ask about it\nokay\nanyone want to try to summarize\nlike I don't even know where to start\nfor today like what the hell happened\nand what just happened\nI was thinking of thinking like if\nyou're in real life I'll just be like\ngive you a hug and that means I would\nhave an awkward hug and then it would\nstart out awkward but it would end up\noh yeah foreign\nyeah that's kind of where I'm at and\nit's just like\nthanks like you know where I am like one\nof those moments where you're like\nyep I can talk to that person\nthat's how I feel anyway yeah I don't\nknow\nit's a great summary anyone else want to\ntake a different perspective on we don't\nhave to we can stop there and not like\nsummarize and like oh here are the\nlearning points for today\nit was like oh uh we answer like you\nknow we follow up on our homework of\nlike oh how do we feel about ourselves\nand we realize oh\na lot of our you know thoughts tend to\nbe about a lot of other people and not\nalways about ourselves and\nyou know it's important to\nbe to have that level of authenticity\nwith yourself as much as you might as\nwell have with others\nZell\nwe've been asking other people\nhow would you get from today\nI mean there was yeah just talking about\nhow we sort of deal with our own\nI mean I've been calling it coping juice\nbut like you know just like the way we\nsort of cope with\num with our true authentic selves and\nhow we bury it underneath expectations\nof others on top of it in order to sort\nof better Define it for it ourselves but\nit's flawed\num and so to to dig through those layers\nwe have to ask why we don't stop\nnegativity we we have to understand it\num and understanding how to change and\npointing out the flawed logic that we've\nburied ourselves underneath underneath\nand yeah\nthank God\nwe have an A plus Korean student\nin group because he does such a good job\nwith summaries that's me let's have a\nhug\nhonestly like I it wasn't meant to I\nknow it's a little bit facetious but\nlike this is exactly the point right so\neach of you brings something else\nand Zell honestly I would have been lost\nwithout your summary\nI\nI don't even know what we talked about\ntoday\nI know it was good\nright it's profound\nand like and and sometimes when we have\nthese moments that are profound like we\ngotta summarize and try to like take it\nwith us so thank you so honestly\nand it's like Ruby's like\nI feel hugged or that's hot like you\nknow that's great this is exactly so\nthis is what why we do this because each\nand every one of you despite being\nconnected has unique strengths and\nweaknesses and what we're going to do is\nwe're going to leverage all of it and I\ncan guarantee you that when it's Ruby's\nturn in the hot seat zelle is going to\nbe taking notes and is going to give her\na perspective on herself that she has\nnever given herself\nright and so the goal of this is for all\nof us to come together be authentic with\neach other help each other and then like\nwe don't know exactly where it's going\nto go\nbut it's probably going to be good\nand it's going to be Bittersweet to get\nthere\nfantastic thank you all very much any\nclosing thoughts before you wrap oh [ __ ]\nhomework\nanyone\nhow do you even figure that out after\ntoday sell any suggestions\n[Laughter]\nmaybe trying to write out how to define\nsuccess through US ourselves versus\nthings that we find that are related to\nother people\nwow that's actually really fantastic\nthat is a really good you know because\nit's interesting to hear other people's\nperspectives or ideas of what success is\nat least from my personal perspective so\nyeah I always find it interesting like\nhow high or how low do people set the\nbar for success in terms of however they\nsee it so I think that's so a really\ngreat all right if I did I hear you\ncorrectly zelle essentially asking\nyourself what does success mean to me\nyeah\nand and almost doesn't know how much of\nit comes from other people when you\nwrite it out sure so we're gonna try to\nsee if if you can get an answer from\nyourself but I I really love that\nbecause it's almost like it builds off\nof the observation that we made about\nour last exercise and how other focused\nthat was\nright so like what is what does it mean\nto me to be successful\nI think it's beautiful thank you very\nmuch though\nwho knows maybe by the end of this Zell\nwill tell us how to find our inner\nselves\nexercises like that\nokay\num thank you all very much for coming\ntoday is anybody raining I mean is\nanybody streaming\nyour rating uh I'll be streaming and\nI'll be reading later in Final Fantasy\nokay so\nso go live Zell if you can\nokay\ndoes that work for you otherwise we'll\njust write you can do that okay and just\nDM me what you're yeah\nas I say next week because it's nearly\nmidnight for me but next week I was\nplanning if you guys are okay with it I\nwill do a sound bath for you to raid so\nyou can bring everyone over for a sound\nbath absolutely I'd like to do that for\neveryone yeah we would love that Ruby\nthank you so much\nall right take care y'all\nstrong work today strong thank you Dr K\nthis is awesome\ntake care everybody\nsee you next week\nokay\nthat's group\nand that's the thing right like I don't\neven know like\nit just takes a couple weeks\nI don't know if you guys caught that if\nyou came in later I you know I don't\nknow\nbut I I don't know how to tell people\nthis kind of stuff so sometimes people\ncome into group and they're like where\nare the answers I expected a course with\na curriculum and a syllabus and Lead Me\nfrom point A to Z not how it works can't\nlead you\nit's a journey right people like oh it's\na journey like like literally like today\nis a journey"
