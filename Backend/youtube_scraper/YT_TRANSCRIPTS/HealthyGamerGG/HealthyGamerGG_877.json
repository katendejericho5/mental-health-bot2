    "transcript": "so sometimes people just have a bad life\nand then what happens is they get\nlabeled with this like particular\npsychiatric thing and then like no one\never removes a diagnosis from your chart\nthey just get added on and added on and\nadded on hey how's it going good buddy\nhow are you\ndoing well\nnice to meet you my friend\nnice to meet you as well what do you go\nby\nuh Dom or Dominic whatever is easier for\nyou okay Dom it is\nperfect and then just as an FYI I in\npreparation for this call I kind of\nwrote a lot of notes and bullet points I\nwas trying to hit to stay mostly on\ntopic also just feel free to cut me off\nwhen whenever if you want to sure so\nlet's just start with who do you want to\nbe and what's holding you back and you\ncan read your bullet points if you want\nto Dom\nsure uh do you care if I start with a\nlittle background contact not at all\nPerfect all right so I come from a very\nsmall family it was just myself sister\nmy mom and dad\num never met anyone on my mom's side of\nthe family she moved out when she was 16\nand they never breached back out to\ncontact her so we don't know anyone from\nher side okay and then on my dad's side\nsmaller family as well\num thinking back to just like childhood\naround kindergarten is when like I knew\nthat there were issues between like my\nmom and my dad it was majority on my\ndad's side\num since then I guess now he's been\nclinically diagnosed with eight\ndifferent mental illnesses a lot of\nthose were yeah were pretty uh intense\nback then just a quick rundown of them\nit was bipolar depression IED\nschizophrenia multiple personality\ndisorder hypomania and Hyper Mania so\nthere was a lot of a lot of things to\nunpack growing up and obviously not\nknowing too much about it with like\nmental health stigma so\num\nall of those issues that were coming\nfrom like my dad's side\nresulted in my mom not feeling safe for\neither her or myself my sister to be\nliving it wherever my dad was uh he\nwould go missing there was just a lot of\nissues so we moved around a ton which\nresulted in my dad's side of the family\nwe would stay with them until like a\nweek or two of being there they're like\nall right you know what you got to\nfigure this out we've never seen the\nside of him like I think you're\noverreacting\nand there's just a lot of go figure it\nout on your own\nso then we would have to continually\nmove and find new places or some nights\njust out of a car and then eventually\none bedroom apartment between three of\nus which is perfectly fine but there's\njust a lot of us on top of each other\nnot really any space or separation\nand financial struggles were huge with\nmy family\nso at one point too my mom was working\nthree jobs at one point seven days a\nweek so it was basically just my sister\nand I became independent around like for\nme at I guess around like seven or eight\nyears old\nand that's right\nyeah so we're basically living on our\nown sister she's two years older she did\nvery well and helped out she kind of\ntook on like here we'll do the cooking\nlike you do it was just we kind of ran\nthe house while my mom did everything\nshe could to provide\nso\nwe're gonna skip ahead a little bit but\num senior year of college for me I was\nclinically diagnosed with ADHD so there\nwas a lot of\nquestions that came about that because I\nalways did okay in school but would\nstruggle with you know sitting down\nstudying completing homework\num actually learning the information\nduring the class rather than the night\nbefore a test which that you know I got\ninto some trouble or hey you didn't do\nwell on this test or\nyou know just different academic\nstruggles but for\nbringing that back home and my mom's\ndoing everything she can\nit was like how am I going to bring more\nstress when that's like the only focus\nI'm sorry I I didn't I didn't follow you\nthere\nso or uh let's go you just you said\nsomething about how am I going to bring\nmore stress what is the stress that\nyou're bringing and where are you\nbringing it to right so struggling\nfinancially it was if I want to go to\ncollege I have to get a full ride\nscholarship got it that is the main goal\nif you don't get that\nthen you're not going to college good\nluck\nso anytime that I would struggle\nacademically\nit would be bringing the point of like\noh hey Mom I know you just got back and\nyou're doing everything you can things\naren't good you're very stressed you're\ntrying to make everything great\nI'm not doing well in school which then\nis well you need to otherwise you're not\ngoing to college that's how your mom\nwould respond\nthat is correct yes okay\nit was just obviously she had a lot\ngoing on in dealing with\nI should just be able to do what I need\nto because I'm smart\num\nso that was a big struggle throughout\nhigh school and then College it became a\nbigger issue with ADHD just like you\nknow I can't brute force my way through\nand get away with it basically but\nanyway it\nsorry\nwe go through my points um\nso throughout High School it was just a\nlot of tension between family\nnever wanted to\nor at home it was always negative so\nanytime I was not at home\nit was never talk about family never any\nof that situation and always just\nsacrificed my own well-being to make\nsure whoever I'm with is happy because I\nwant to be\nsurrounded by happy people so it was\nnever I never really I guess developed\nmy own personality it was just adapt to\nwhoever I'm with to make sure that\nthey're happy because if they're happy\nI feel happy because it's not negative\num I don't know if that made sense yeah\nI think it makes a lot of sense okay\ncool\num sorry plus my point of my bullet\npoints I had a full full circle thing\num\ngoing through Dom is it is it\nlet's pause for a second let me ask you\nsomething\nhow would you feel\nif\nyou weren't able to make it full circle\nfor me\noh I feel like I had a prime opportunity\nand I kind of wasted it\nso who are we making it full circle for\nmyself really\nyes okay all right there's a there's a\nwhole tunnel okay anyway my main point\nto the topic is just I want to be able\nto separate my past\nfrom what is current like the present I\nwant I want to take where I am and have\nfuture goal I want to make progress\ntowards that but it's insanely tough\nwhen everything from the past\nand always feeling like I'm just dealing\nwith an ultimatum of\nyou have to get this or you're screwed\nthey're very relevant so how can I\nseparate the two the past and the\npresent\nto then look to the Future\nis my main point\nokay\nand then it's just a common theme of\neverything always feeling like an\nultimatum that I don't have a choice I\nwas going to ask you a question about\nthat give me just one second I'm having\na slight problem with my headphones\ndefinitely\nOkay so\nuh can you tell me can you say something\nhello\nsay something again\nit's me\none more time\nhello nope okay give me a second I gotta\nfix my headphones this is\nno worries okay oh there we go keep\ntalking count to ten for me one two\nthree four five six seven eight perfect\nnine\nall right so can you give me an example\nof an ultimatum now Dom\nright now it's it feels like\nsurvivability it's\nstruggling with bills going basically\npaycheck to paycheck\nand if I decide to try to change or\nyou know the possibility of let's Branch\nout and change some things maybe it'd be\nbetter\nif it goes wrong\nthen I am screwed financially with no\nsupport system or backup plan\nor help from like family\nso it's it's me and only me\nand if I do anything wrong\nthen I don't know\nso what I'm kind of hearing is that\nyou've got no room to experiment like\nyou can't afford to take a chance and\nit's like survival\nevery day\ncorrect\ncan I think for a second\ndefinitely\nbecause that's a lot man\nyeah\nthere's a lot of living and stress\nfear and anxiety\njust all around\nand what I'm hearing is that you really\nwant to escape the legacy of your past\nyes\nit's very hard for me\nsetting goals never made sense to me\nbecause it was always here's the one\noutcome which I guess is technically a\ngoal but it's either this\nor it's like good luck basically like\nwhat else would I do I don't want to get\nstuck part-time job I don't you know\nobviously I want to go to college I I\nhad aspirations for those and they just\nto clarify did you and I thought you\nsaid you got diagnosed with ADHD it was\nthat as a senior in college\ncorrect so did you complete College\nI did\nand are you\nit sounds like you're not in a good\nfinancial situation right now\nthat is correct and did you get a degree\nthat you can utilize in a in a way to\nhelp you with Financial Security or or\nwhat's going on there\nyes and no\nthe major that I wanted to go into\ndid not go well with classes so\nbasically failed those but again\nI'm on a four-year full tuition\nscholarship so I can't mess that up\nbecause I can't do the extra semester\nextra year because financially it yep\nwould not be\num good uh so I ended up having to\nswitch Majors twice\nthis is something else that was kind of\nyou know what I can finish this in the\nfour years and just get done with it\nso\nit's not where I want to be it's not as\nlucrative\nof a degree I suppose but I do have\nplans I guess kind of set up in my\ncurrent job\nand with my manager to hopefully move to\nmore what I want okay at the moment yes\nstruggling here's here's the question is\nyour do you have a degree that allows\nyou in the relative short term to no\nlonger live paycheck to paycheck\nmaybe in the near future\na couple years hopefully\nokay\nto just pick up and move to a different\none no but\nfor like longevity or staying in a\ncompany for growth yes do do you do you\nmind if I ask you details about that\nsure so can you tell me like what your\ndegree is what your current job is and\nwhat the job that you you're positioned\nto become financially independent with\nis\nso I graduate with human computer\ninteraction which at the time was very\nnew\num so there wasn't really any jobs at\nleast when I was looking that were\nlooking for that granted now there are\nand it's mostly around ux and UI\nresearch\nwhy do people\ninteract or do things that they do on\neither their phone or on computers so\nthat's what I'm trying to go to now what\nI started with that I've been at the\nsame company was tech support and then\nthat has I've then moved got promoted to\nbecome a Content writer on the product\nteam so it's just more documentation\nokay\nso my end goal is ux research\nokay and what's your path to get there\ncurrently in the talk with my manager is\nwe need a ux research for our company\nI have the major for it\nI just don't have any of the experience\ntools\nor anything so it's a company\nputting all their chips in on me or just\nhiring someone else and then I might\nlearn from them\nwhy are you thinking about only this\ncompany\nbecause I feel that my skills aren't\nenough to warrant\ngoing to get hired somewhere else so if\nI can stay in the same company and get\nany kind of experience it makes me look\nthat much more valuable too then\nBranch elsewhere I would feel more\ncomfortable in my chances\nand so\nlet me just think about how to ask this\ncan I think for another second\ndefinitely\nhow good of an assessor are you\nat\nhow good of a fit you are\nfor the job that you want\nprobably not great I might be a little\nbiased\nagainst myself\nyeah that that's fair so\nI'll share something how do you feel\nlike when I ask you that question and\nyou shared that answer like do you have\nan emotional reaction that comes with it\nno it's just always I don't know if it's\nan emotion\ngranted like it always feels the same\nbut it's always an immediate thought of\njust self-worth probably not good enough\nyeah\nso here's\nso what do you what do you think about\nyourself Dom\nuh\nthat's a lot with the ADHD I guess\nlike\nfrom getting clinically diagnosed and\nstarting prescriptions and talking\nit was like wow things could have been\nso much easier I probably could have\nbeen so much more successful college\nwould have been probably a lot better\ndefinitely would have been starting in\nthe major that I wanted would have been\na lot less stress\nso a lot of it is\nnot regret just disappointment I guess\nfor myself\nhow could I have gotten a full ride\nscholarship and this is where I am\nhow could I have dealt with everything\ngrowing up like you know childhood\nbut I can't figure things out now it's\njust a lot of it feels like a wasted\ntime\nvery far back but now starting to\nrealize it you angry\nno\njust I guess more helpless\njust\nlike stuck in an abyss I guess\nhelp me understand what you're helpless\nabout\njust knowing\nnot knowing how to\nI guess just better myself\nokay just in general\nI used to be on top of a lot of things\nlike working out\nused to feel smarter\nnow it's just\nclouded mess of\nstress\nI don't eat I there's just a lot of\nwhose fault is that\nuh do you ever think about that\nit's never whose fault it's always just\nI wish I knew\nit wasn't that\nokay\nI'm going to need to think for another\nsecond\nI really appreciate all your bullet\npoints and the thoroughness of your\nstory\nthank you hopefully I'm not doing too\nmuch\nhow did you feel when I made that\ncomment\nso thank you\num\nI appreciate it\nand what did you say\nin response um\nI don't remember\nthere's no way okay\nokay Dom\nso here's I don't know exactly where\nthis is going to go or what we're gonna\ndo but\nI'm hopeful for you and we're going to\ntry to understand things a little bit\nokay sure so the first is\nwhen I was working in the emergency room\nsometimes we would have patients come in\nthat had multiple diagnoses like they\nwould have like six seven diagnoses on\ntheir chart\nthere's a really awesome\na nurse practitioner who I was working\nwith\nand I would ask her you know what is\nthis you know what's the diagnosis and\nshe would say [ __ ] life syndrome\nso sometimes people just have a bad life\nand then what happens is they get\nlabeled with this like particular\npsychiatric thing and then like no one\never removes a diagnosis from your chart\nthey just get added on and added on and\nadded on\nand what I'm hearing Dom is that you\nhave had an exceedingly difficult life\nlike when we're talking about what's the\nworst hand that you can get dealt like\nit Dom's hand like well if we look up in\nthe textbook what does the worst hand\nlook like we're going to see a picture\nof your face and and here's what I I\nhopefully that's not I don't mean to be\njudgmental it's just when I'm thinking\nabout like advantages and disadvantages\nwhen we spawn in the world\nyou've got a history of severe and what\nsounds like under-treated mental illness\nin your direct Family Social isolation\nstress Financial instability you also\nwere not allowed to be a child\nright so like this is where there's\nthere's all kinds of stuff that I was\nthinking early on in your story which I\ndon't think we're gonna get to so for\nexample like how do we learn what we\nwant we learn who we are and what we\nwant through creative play basically\nright we have to explore and like see\nlike oh I like this thing I'm a dog\nperson I'm not a cat person you can\nnever know that about yourself unless\nyou are exposed to dogs and cats\nwhat I'm hearing is that from this age\nof seven or eight that you and your\nsister were essentially independent that\nyou had like you weren't given a\nchildhood you weren't given an\nopportunity to play or explore whatever\nthat in and of itself is devastating\nenough\num followed by then you've got this\nother angle of un untreated ADHD which\num you should absolutely check out our\nguide I don't know if you get access to\nthat by by being a guest on stream or\nwhatever but if you can't afford it or\nsomething just let us know and we'll\nfigure that out pre-ordered okay well\nlooking forward to it okay so\num it so there's just a lot of stuff\nabout untreated ADHD which I'll sort of\nsummarize for you there briefly but\nthere's a lot of detail but essentially\nwhat happens is like so if you're a kid\nwho's and I think you've you're smart\nso you managed to compensate but the\nthing is a kid with ADHD who's smart\nit's almost more devastating\nbecause like you're eight years old and\nyou're looking around at the other kids\nand you're noticing that you're just as\nsmart as them\nbut it's easy for them and it's hard for\nyou and it shouldn't be hard for you\nyou know that you're just as smart as\nthem and like they can sit down for an\nhour and learn something but it takes\nyou four hours to learn something and so\nwhat happens in ADHD that's untreated is\nthat you think that there's like a\nproblem with you there's something\nbusted\nand as that persists a seven-year-old\neight-year-old nine-year-old 10 11 12 13\n14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22.\nthen you get a diagnosis and then\nthere's a whole other thing that happens\nwhich is now you begin to grieve the\nlife that you could have had\nwhich you have every right to do if you\nhad a dad who took care of himself from\na mental illness standpoint if you had\nmore supportive family if you had more\nFinancial Security if you had a rich\nGrandpa like there are all kinds of\nthings about your life that could have\nbeen easier for you and that sucks\nso there's like all that alternate\nuniverse stuff that you have to grieve\nand then even if they just diagnose you\nwith ADHD at the age of 12. if they just\nfixed one thing forget about all the\nother stuff you're not asking for a\nwhole lot\nif they just fix one damn thing\nyour whole life could have been\ndifferent you could have majored in the\nmajor you wanted you could have you\ngotta because it sounds like you got a\nfull ride\nto college with undiagnosed and\nuntreated ADHD\nand so the amount of effort that you had\nto put in the amount of unfair obstacles\nyou had to overcome to just get like do\nyou see what I'm saying like you have\nhad to invest 10 times as much effort to\nget like a 1x yield\nand when someone does that over and over\nwhen I have to work 10 times as hard as\nmy colleagues\nif I'm lucky I get angry if I'm unlucky\nI think it's me\nyou blame yourself or you blame other\npeople\nthere's a good a theory from Freud\nthat depression is anger directed\nagainst the self\nso the lack of self-worth is like all of\nthe rage so I asked you are you angry\nand you're like not really and it's like\n[ __ ]\nit's it's yeah now it's just more\nacceptance that it sucked and not\nknowing what to do yeah yeah so so I I\nhear that and I think there's some\namount of healthy acceptance there but\nthis is the kind of thing where I've\nworked with people like you in a more\nPsychotherapy relationship over time\nwhich is definitely something I would\nrecommend for you by the way and one of\nthe steps that we try to take is like\nyou need to start getting angry at other\npeople\nbecause as you become angry as you\nassign responsibility for your negative\nsituation to others you may say what's\nthe point in that the point in that is\nthat honestly it's not your fault\nand the truth of the matter is that your\nparents probably in a sense I'm sure\nyou'll say this kind of thing they did\nthe best that they could\ndid they do a good job Dom no no no\nright and how do you feel about that\nuh I look at the goods of it\nright so there's like there's no anger\nand there needs to be because that [ __ ]\nis going somewhere and what what tends\nto happen is it gets directed towards\nthe self\nand then we have self-worth issues\nnow we get to your question which is how\ndo I let the legacy of the past\nstop determining my present and my\nfuture\nand the first thing is that you\nunderstand that it is going to for some\namount of time but you see how the past\nis manifesting in the present\nbecause what the past is doing is it's\nmanifesting in the present and then it's\ndirecting your future in the simplest\nway is that you're not applying for a\n[ __ ] job as a ux researcher anywhere\noutside of your country or your company\nand I don't mean that enough do you feel\nblamed when I say that\nno just just fear\nright so like that's the fear what are\nyou afraid of\nit doesn't work or my current job\nI don't know and I guess they're not\ngonna fire me for looking for a new job\nthey don't need to know first of all\nright it's just\nwhat if it goes wrong and then there's\nno backup plan it's just I guess the\nbiggest thing is finally\nthe most Comfort I've had is knowing\nI'll at least get a paycheck every two\nweeks to cover myself rather than having\nto do extra side jobs to make things\nwork such as comfort finally for the\nfirst time okay so that's good but so\nbut let me ask you like would that fear\nthat you feel\num\nthat's the legacy of the past\ndo you see that so if you no longer want\nit to shape your future\nyou can't listen to it\nso this is where like like so it's kind\nof interesting because when I uh the end\nof what you shared with me really felt\nmore like a like I'm putting on my\ncareer coaching hat for a second which\nis that and this is the thing about\ncareer coaching is that it's not just\nabout what to do it's recognizing that\nwe have past experiences which become a\npart of us and then we'll inform our\nthoughts in our decisions\nand telling you to just apply for as a\nux researcher is not going to work we\nhave to appreciate the emotional\nchallenges that that's going to take so\nthis is where like if you've been\ncomfortable if this is the first time\nyou've been comfortable for a while I'd\nsay be comfortable for a little while\ndon't add some amount of stress but my\nguess is that even being comfortable\nyou're going to be paranoid\nmm-hmm\nat one point I was feeling financially\nstable until my car broke down I had to\nfind no one but when talking with my\nactual therapist oh God you're in\ntherapist I almost yeah I almost had\nmore anxiety and worry that I didn't\nhave anxiety or worry\nyeah so there's just all kinds of crap\nthat you've unfortunately like adapted\nto and so your journey Dom is going to\nbe long\nbut what I am hopeful for is that each\nstep you take will be brighter\nso even though you've got a long way to\ngo like you're in the pit and the air is\nfoul down here and there's no sunlight\nand it's damp but every step you take\nthe air is going to get fresher there's\ngoing to be sun on your face there's\ngoing to be wind you're going to start\nto dry off you'll start to feel better\nthere's going to be fruit bushes and\nstreams and Rain like you know like\nevery step you take is going to be\nbetter than the last\nthat I'm I'm hopeful for you that that's\nthe case and and what I see like I know\nthat you have issues with self-worth\nlet's just sum it up that way but what I\nsee is someone who's incredibly\nresilient incredibly strong incredibly\nBrave incredibly has a ton of endurance\nand what I also see what I feel when I\nsee you is actually sadness\nbecause I think it's really unfair that\nyou had to be all of those things\nI I don't think you're\nfrivolous and that makes me sad\nfrivolous is the one thing that you are\nnot\nand like that's\nterrible\nthat you've never had the opportunity to\nbe wasteful\nright\nbut I think like going forward what this\nkind of means is that like so recognize\nthat your self-worth is going to be\nbuilt up or lack of self-worth or\nnegative self-attitude is going to be\nbuilt up from all these experiences and\nI think growing up without a with ADHD\nthere's going to be attachment related\ncrap going on to so all that kind of\nstuff\nyou know you may have difficulty forming\nrelationships and things like that\nbecause you no one ever showed you what\na healthy romantic relationship looks\nlike so you may not know how to behave\nin one there's all kinds of stuff\nbut I would say if your goal is like\npresent\nhow do you shape your present and future\nI would start with something really\nreally concrete which is don't put all\nof your eggs in one basket at your\ncurrent job\nand recognize that like and this is\nwhere like I don't know how to say this\nbut you know when I talk to people like\nyou there's an assumption that like oh\nlike we have to heal all of the\npsychological hurt on the inside and go\nto therapy until you are like cured but\nI don't want to say this just as as a\ntherapist\nFinancial Security is so much of Mental\nHealth\nand you can therapize people who are\nbroke\nfor a decade I don't know that you're\never gonna get them to feel like the\nstress response like the cortisol\nflowing through your body the way your\nneurons are wiring the physiology of\nyour stressful situation that comes from\nFinancial insecurity cannot be\ntherapized away or maybe it can maybe\nI'm just not good enough\nthis is where like I'm kind of like a\nsimple dude so I think like so there's\nthere's evidence for example so there's\na program in New York called housing\nfirst where they were what they used to\ndo is they take people who were had\naddiction problems\nand what they would do is like if you\nwant to get housing you need to be clean\nfor a certain amount of time\nand what they found is that you could\ngive those people all the therapy or\nclinical treatment in the world\nto try to get them sober to get them\ninto housing but if you flip it around\nthe outcomes are way better\nyou just give them a place to live\nthen getting sober becomes easier\nso there's like decent evidence and I'm\nI'm kind of of this mind that like\nyou have to get some amount of Financial\nSecurity and a roof over your head in\norder to get mentally well and this is\nwhere like when we say mental health is\nmore than mental illness this is exactly\nwhat I'm talking about\nso in your case I would really start by\ntunneling down if you there's one thing\nthat you need to change it's to improve\nyour financial security which I think\nyou understand and you've worked really\nhard towards and that's like if ux\nresearch is what you do don't negotiate\nyour against yourself and like reject\nyourself before someone else\ngives you a chance\nand that's where it's going to be hard\nbut I would apply for five jobs ten jobs\n15 jobs while you're doing this stuff\nat your job then there's also all kinds\nof other things which you like you may\nnot have never been taught which is that\nif you have an offer in hand\ndoes it improve your chances of or uh\nmake it does it better or worsen your\nchances at your current employer to get\nthe job that you want\nit would better\nno that that alone I think\nis huge I that was one of the biggest\nchoosing to stay current job to\nhopefully get to that position that just\nseemed like the safe route where I can\nthen look at other things rather than\njob but to hear that and obviously with\nfinancials huge\nhonestly just huge relief hearing that\nthat should be a possibility let's\nactually look into absolutely and here's\nthe thing staying at your current job is\nactually not the safe route so like this\nis the other thing it's a bit judgmental\nit's a bit assumptive but\nyou're so paranoid about taking a chance\nthat you play it safe and in playing it\nsafe all you're left with is one\nlifeline\nyeah you see that\nso this is what we tend to see\nfor people who are struggling in careers\nis there's a psychological aspect which\nthey lean into which they learned for a\ndamn good reason and like like I'm not\nblaming you for believing that because I\nthink you you're a smart guy you believe\nthat because like\nyou know like what like I mean in the\nhousehold you grow up\nDom once you grab a Lifeline what do you\nnever do under any circumstances once\nyou've got a lifeline\ngamble it absolutely\nyou hold on to it\nand even if the boat is going towards\nthe edge of a waterfall\nand it's gonna pull you right over and\nrocks you do not let go under any\ncircumstances\nyou don't let go of the lifeline to\nclimb on shore\nright and so like these are if you want\nto let go of the past like you've got to\nsee all of this stuff and how it informs\nyour current decision making I'm not\nblaming you for any of these thoughts I\ndon't think you're weak if you need some\namount of comfort if you're not ready to\nlet go of the lifeline yet even though\nit's the right move that's fine too\nbut what I'm hearing is like\nsomeone who has overcome trials\ntribulations someone who will take any\nopportunity like if they're given a\nsingle opportunity that they're not\n[ __ ] handicapped through the\nthrough it all they're going to excel\nand honestly the same thing like there's\na part of like I see a part of myself in\nyou or I'm relating I guess you could\nsay because like you know I I failed a\nbunch and then like someone gave me one\nchance when I entered medical school\nand what I told them is like if y'all\nI've worked my ass off to get to where I\nam if you give me a single chance I will\nnot disappoint you\nand my life was very different because I\nhad the opposite of your upbringing in\nterms of all of the advantages all the\nPrivileges and I [ __ ] squandered it\naway\njumped into the pit and then had to\nclimb out\nand what I see is someone who's like\nhard-working dedicated loyal\nyou haven't talked about that but I\nimagine you may be loyal to a fault you\nknow\nand and so the thing is like give people\nthe opportunity\nto employ you\nit's a benefit to them\nand you may not feel that worth yet but\nlike bro like I don't know how to say it\nlike\njust the fact that you're alive today\nthat you are making it from paycheck to\npaycheck instead of being saddled with\neight diagnosis yourself homeless and\ndrugs and all that kind of [ __ ] like\nthat is an amazing achievement\nand I think all you need is like you\njust need an even game and you will blow\nit out of the water\nand the thing is the court is there\nyou just have to step onto it but\nrecognize that as you try to step onto\nit you're gonna have to like let go of\nlife even then you're not really letting\ngo\nright even if you have a good\nrelationship with your manager you can\nask them hey I'm thinking about looking\nfor ux researcher jobs do you have a\nsense of like what the timeline is here\nI really love working here\nright so like I don't know if anyone has\ntaught you language you ever been like\ntaught this stuff\noh so so like I'll share this with you\nbecause I want to try to make it\nconcrete I'm not 100 sure that this is\nthe right thing to say but just to give\nyou an example so you go to your boss\nand you say hey I really love working\nhere I really love the work that I do I\nreally appreciate that this company\nneeds this role and I think I'm your guy\nand I really appreciate that you're\nadvocating for me\ndo you have a sense of like How likely\nis this is and what the timeline is\nI'm thinking about looking for other ux\nresearcher jobs because that's really\nwhat I want to do\nyou know if you're telling me that it's\ngoing to happen here then like I'm just\ntrying to understand like what's going\non my honestly my preference would be I\nlove working here I want to stay here\nand at the same time what I'm hearing\nfrom you is that like it may happen it\nmay not happen\nnow if you have a real [ __ ] of a boss\nthey may fire you on the spot or\nsomething like that but like\nyou know I think just be honest with\npeople and and this is the wild thing\nthat I think you know people don't\nunderstand like just because you leave a\njob doesn't mean that you're going to\nleave on bad terms\ndoesn't mean that I worked with a bunch\nof people who will leave jobs with\nbosses on good terms\nboss moves to a different company says\nhey we want to hire you back because I\nlove working with you\nand then like\nopportunities will come dumb you just\nkeep doing what you're doing you've done\nan amazing job and like\nopen yourself up to having the world not\n[ __ ] you for once\noh that's scary\nyeah no I\nyeah no that all that all makes sense\nI agree I think it's helpful\nquestions\nI don't I don't think so otherwise we're\ngonna go on for way longer\nI think we're good we hit the point okay\nall right one quick one\nso\ncurrently dating my girlfriend almost\ntwo years things are good first\nrelationship ever\nthings record really well great she\ncomes from like yours like the opposite\nside of my upbringing\nshe knows of like issues in ADHD and\njust struggling in general\nand she's really advocating that I get\nthings fixed she's very health at\nnutrition oriented mindset values a lot\nof that\nto which she's like you definitely need\nto start making progress nothing in like\ntimeline nothing it was all a healthy\nconversation just\nyou need that start making progress on\ngetting better in general\nhow do I show progress how do I make\nsure\nbecause I'm already over I overthought\nit for way too long but just\nis there a way other than just\nI am talking to someone\nI guess that's really yeah okay I'm so\nglad you asked because we're gonna try\nto be a positive part of the world for a\nsecond okay so what does she want you to\ndo more precisely\nso\nI don't eat regularly anymore and that\nwas due to\nworking way too much\nscrewed over by eating habits so that's\na struggle groceries\nhard for me to Warrant buying food\nwhat do you mean by that [ __ ]\nif I buy groceries there's a good chance\nthat I'll probably just not eat it or\nthe amount of work that has to be put\ninto cooking won't do or it might just\ngo bad and if that's the case then I\njust wasted money that could be used\nelsewhere so it's hard for me to get\nmyself to buy groceries regularly\nso I'd much rather\nget a cheap meal from fast food once a\nday if I'm feeling it maybe not\nso eating has been really bad which then\nalso has then affected energy my sleep\nschedule has just been terrible\nso I don't have energy to begin with\nalso could be because of the food and\nalso the stress so there's a lot of\nother things around it so it's more so\ngetting myself to a point where I'm\neating I can work out I have energy and\nI'm not Dom do y'all talk\nmy girlfriend\nyeah does she unders do you all talk\nabout what your experiences of living\nand existing are\nyes and\nit started off a lot\nmore of like you know the elevator\nspeech of it\nand then when this last conversation\ncame up was when I kind of dove\nlike head first until like here is the\nsituation let me\ntry to paint it in a way that makes\nsense\nand she's very understanding it's\nnothing again none of this conversation\nwith her was bad it's just I'm obviously\ngoing to take it too\nnew extremes but yeah she is\nunderstanding she does know\nand she is\nlearning alongside with me\nokay\ncan I think I'm gonna need to think for\nlonger in a second\ndefinitely\nbecause we do have another caller but I\nwant to try to give you an answer to\nthis because the world has screwed you\nin enough ways and we're going to try to\ngive you a little extra time but that\nmay make you feel guilty so I don't even\nwant to say just let me think so here's\nwhat I think you should do okay\ncaveat is I know very little about the\nsituation I know very little her about\nher I know a little bit more about you\nbut\nwe're gonna try something anyway\nplease be critical of what I'm about to\nsay and be thoughtful about how you\napply it\nso if you have a partner\nwho wants you to be healthier\nhow do you approach that so there are a\ncouple of inherent problems the first is\nthat the tools that she's working with\nlike the assumptions that she has like I\ncan buy groceries and I can afford them\nthere are a lot of like core assumptions\nthat she may have never questioned\nso what when she sees an unhealthy\nBehavior Her diagnosis of that behavior\ninvolves all kinds of stuff that may be\nvery different from why you do the\nbehavior\nif that Gap is not bridged y'all are in\ntrouble\nOkay so\nbecause like you're just operating from\na different set of rules\nand like if she's playing one game and\nyou're playing another game and you'll\nend up with different results it's like\nI'm playing a video game on the internet\nand every 30 seconds my power is going\nout and then I lose the game on the\ninternet that doesn't mean I'm a bad\nplayer it just means the tools that I\nhave at my disposal are completely\ndifferent\nokay\nso what I would what I would start with\nis try to share with her\nthis is where I came from\nthis is where I am and this is where I\nwant to go\nand I would share with her what you\nshared with me I would share with her\nwhat your struggles have been I would\nalso share with her what your successes\nhave been because you've had a lot of\nthem I don't know do you realize you've\nhad a lot of them\nthey don't feel like successes but yes I\nknow so now you need to really be honest\nwith yourself so let me ask you if you\nhad a if if your dad has eight diagnoses\nis in and out of places y'all are\nbasically broke all the time you had to\nraise yourself no one ever taught you\nhow to study mom never taught you how to\nstudy never prepared you for your tests\nyou've got undiagnosed ADHD How likely\nis it that you go to college\nHow likely is it that you get a full\nride to college\neven less\nslim to none\nis your answer for the first question so\nis that a success\nyes does it feel that way\nno that's okay\nso when you go through this process\nyou need to be a little bit critical of\nhow you feel and like what you've\nactually accomplished because the truth\nis you've come a really long way\nright and so like this is where you were\nthis is where I've come this is where I\nwant to go I want to be healthy I want\nto build a career\nyou know like this these are the things\nthat I want because I think it's\nimportant I I know this is going to\nsound kind of weird but like\nit's important if you're in a committed\nrelationship to demonstrate effort and\nprogress to your partner\nso like you've made progress but you've\nstill got a lot of work to do now you\ndon't want to kind of come across as I\ndon't know how to say this but like you\ndon't want to be like a victim\nnecessarily but you also don't want to\nminimize\nthe shitty hand you've been dealt\nthat's like a reality and you've made a\nprogress you're a [ __ ] hero\nand you have a long way to go and you're\ngoing to need some help but you're\nplanning on doing this\nso I think she needs to understand that\nso you should share your life story and\nthen like also like really focus on your\nwins the fact that no one ever taught\nyou how to succeed at a job but it\nsounds like your manager likes you and\nis advocating for you you're a hard\nworker you you know you don't give up\nyou're tenacious and all kinds of other\nstuff that's number one\nso I would specify for her where you\nwant to go including health and things\nlike that\nthen I would say to her what makes it\nhard for you here's what I struggle with\nand now this is where things become\nreally tricky\nI would ask her I would ask her all\nkinds of questions so when you say I\nshould eat healthy help me understand\nwhat you think keeps me from eating\nhealthy\nwhen you try to eat healthy what are the\nreasons that you're not able to eat\nhealthy and how is it that you're able\nto get healthy and she's gonna say\nsomething like well I have to be\norganized I have to go to the grocery\nstore you know if I go to the grocery\nstore on Monday morning then I'm going\nto eat healthy if I don't go to the\ngrocery store then I won't eat healthy\nthen I would ask her like so what are\nthere situations where you go to the\ngrocery store and you throw away\ngroceries\nand then I would ask her so like if you\nhad let's say a hundred dollars a week\nfor food how would that change the way\nthat you eat\nyou know and then I would kind of share\nwith her that my experience is different\nthe reason I don't go to the grocery\nstore is because if I throw out food\nlike that's money that I\nI don't have money for that\nI I can't I literally can't afford it\nand so I sometimes will eat calorie\ndense food once a day because I get 2\n000 calories for eight dollars\nand I work a lot\nand that's how I survive I'm not saying\nit's healthy I'm not saying I want to\nstay there it's just\nhow it works in my head\nnow you've got to be there a couple of\npitfalls here okay so I'm going to give\nyou some tips number one when you talk\nto her what is your phys how do you all\ntalk like physically tell me draw me a\npicture where is she where are you where\nare you all sitting\nother across from each other next to\neach other never sit across from each\nother when you're having this\nconversation always sit next to each\nother do you all hold hands\nyeah okay so I would also\ndo some kind of mild intimate I don't\nmean sexual physical contact while\nyou're having this conversation\nso as she understands how privileged she\nis and how not privileged you are she\nmay feel attacked it's very important\nthat you don't attack her it's very\nimportant that y'all don't compare\nso it's not about you did this way this\nway the goal in your mind should be I\ncare about this person this person cares\nabout me I want their help and support\nthese are goals that I have too but\nwe're each coming with a different we're\nplaying the same game but we've got\ndifferent hands of cards she's got a\nstraight flush\nI've got a 2 7 off suit\nwe you could both win but the strategy\nyou use has to be different\nso don't compare ask a lot of questions\nto understand her perspective hopefully\nshe will ask you questions as well\nyou should answer them\nbe careful that comparison next thing\nnext Pitfall be very careful about\nproblem solving so as you share certain\nthings you're you're grinning what's\nthat grin\nthere's just problem solved trying to\nfigure everything out so overthinking I\nI would make it clear to her that\nsometimes when y'all are talking the\ngoal is not for her to problem solve for\nyou okay here's how you buy groceries\nlet me help you with that\nI would actually be a little bit clear\nwith her that like there's an\nunderstanding phase and there's a\nplanning phase\nand like sometimes I'm just sharing for\nthe sake of sharing we'll figure stuff\nout let's develop a plan later but right\nnow I need you to just listen and\nunderstand\nand my goal is going to be listening and\nunderstanding and then ask for her\nsupport\nso like what how like I may need help\nwith this like how can you help me\nbecause they'll be like I can give you\n100 bucks a week for groceries say like\nokay that's fine that you can do that\nwhat are like what else can you do you\nmay not feel comfortable with that and\nyou can say like I just don't feel like\nI I feel that feels emasculating to me\nand I want to be able to do a certain\namount of this on my own but can we just\ntalk about it can you help me plan can\nyou help me do this\nand sometimes it's just going to be\nabout listening but sometimes I don't\nknow how to say this but if she grew up\nin a household where like people meal\nplan and do whatever and y'all didn't\nshe may actually have information for\nyou that's useful you just need to be\nreally really intentional about when\ny'all are like understanding and\nexploring and when y'all are developing\nplans\nhow does that sound\nsounds that sounds good okay nothing\nagainst that\nany questions or concerns\nno okay\nthat does help them it gave me\nstructure okay\ngood luck to you Dom I appreciate it\nagain thank you\ntake care man you as well\nall right\nyeah\nso in terms of summary just real quick\nyou know when we say mental health is\nmore than mental illness\nthat's like\nI don't know how to say this but there's\njust so much evidence that Financial\nSecurity just like learning how to\nnegotiate at your job like all kinds of\nstuff\ncontributes to our sense of Peace\nsecurity\nlowers our physiology and it's not all\nfixed in therapy\nlike that's just not how it is like I\nyou know and so it's it's good it's\ngreat that we're in therapy it's good\nyou should absolutely do it but also\nrecognize that like you got to take care\nof your external material world too\nand that as you can afford to buy\ngroceries and as you can have a savings\naccount with a six six months of like\nemergency savings that is going to do so\nmuch for your stress your sense of\nwell-being your confidence in yourself\nyour ability to try new things your\nability to be motivated\nand we sometimes like lose sight of that\nso\nyou know if you're in a in a hard\nsituation\ndon't blame everything on psychology or\nlack of self-worth or things like that\nand honestly acknowledge that sometimes\nlife is hard"
