    "transcript": "could bad things happen if you make a\nchoice and commit to something yes bad\nthings can happen\nbut\nyou don't have to be afraid of them\nhello hello\nwelcome friend\nuh hello it's nice to be here it's nice\nto have you uh can you see and hear me\nall right I can but you are not on\nstream just so yeah okay\nI may make a mistake at some point but\num you know the the goal is not to you\nknow show your face so\nyeah welcome I feel like I can\ncommunicate with my faith too that's why\nI put my kids that's why I appreciate it\nyeah I feel I feel I'm gonna say a lot\nmore of my face to be honest okay so\ntoday we're talking a little bit about\num who do you want to be and what's\nholding you back is that right\nyeah so I'm actually a little surprised\nthey picked me because I kind of didn't\ndirectly answer it I kind of answer it\nby saying uh it's more like I I don't\nreally want to be anything and the\nreason being is that I feel like if I\nchoose to be something in particular I'm\ngoing to be giving up something that\nmight also be genuinely what I want\nokay\nthat sounds like a uh I I can totally\nunderstand why they picked you right so\nand first can you can we start with what\nyou go by my friend\nuh my name is Johnny okay\nso Johnny tell me a little bit more\nabout that so what's your so it sounds\nlike you're kind of feeling\na little stuck\nI wouldn't use the word stuck because\nI've actually spent a lot of time with\nthis okay\nand I'm gonna actually give you some\nbackgrounds so since 2006 2007 I have on\nmy own free time studied some Eastern\nspirituality stuff so it's been almost\n15 years for me wow\nso I think this might be interesting for\nus to talk about sure and part of well\npart of it actually came even before the\nspiritual stuff but I was always worried\nif I became something well what am I\nletting go of\nand the tricky thing is well I don't\neven know what I am in the first place\nso like aren't I just changing\nidentities and aren't identities\nconstantly changing so\nlike why pick something if I can always\njust keep changing like adapt to the\nmoment\nokay\nso\nuh that's a good question do you have an\nanswer\nSo my answer is kind of\nit's hard for me to pick something to go\ntowards but if a situation arises where\na certain role is better I feel like I\ncan adopt a certain role socially\nbecause it'll work better work out\nbetter in the way I want it\nokay so that's sort of how\nuh picking a certain identity helps okay\nI get in this place where I'm like I\ndon't know how to talk about it because\nI don't really want to be the identity\nbut I can adopt it for the sake of like\nsocial stuff I'm with you so let me make\nsure I understand okay\nso the first thing is that\nI'm sort of noticing that you can't you\ndon't know what identity to adopt\nsometimes or you don't know who you want\nto be let's say because if\nyou become something\nyou could be missing out on something\nelse\nyeah right that's first issue\nsecond thing is that\nuh\nif you're presented with a particular\noption\nyou can adopt that identity but it's not\nreally necessarily who you are you're\nalmost like playing a role\nyeah like right now I'm giving you my\nmore three more fun role instead of\nbeing kind of neutral which is kind of\nhow I was right before the stream okay\nand and so\nif so first question Johnny is this a\nproblem in some way\nI don't know if it's a problem but it\nseems like not a problem to me but like\neveryone around me kind of think is a\nproblem like you know people are very\nadamant that I have goals\nbut it's not that I I don't dislike\ngoals but my goals tend to happen when\nthere's a problem in front of me if\nthere's nothing wrong I almost have like\nzero goals and I just kind of go with\nthings\nso that sounds pretty chill\nyeah so\nis this I guess\nI guess I kind of want to ask because I\ndid kind of get into spirituality in a\nnot so good way okay so sometimes I'm\nhesitant to\nexplain or I guess kind of be what I am\nbecause I kind of got into spirituality\nto numb myself unintentionally okay well\nright now I'm not anymore like I don't\nknow you can see my face like I'm not\ncompletely like\ncan you help me understand what you mean\nby you got into spirituality to numb\nyourself\nyeah basically I got I started\nmeditating to stop feeling things okay\ndid that work\nactually it did for like three years\nokay and then what happened\nuh life soft life sucked it was boring\nbasically like okay I didn't care about\nanything you were numbing you didn't\ncare and then what happened\num\ngot a bit suicidal okay because I didn't\ncare okay\nand\nI guess I started caring again because I\nmet some pretty good people yeah\nI guess after that the weirdest thing\ninstead of meditating to numb my\nfeelings I notice I can meditate to\nactually feel more okay good\nand then what happens\nI don't see a lot of things have\nhappened the suicide part it comes and\ngoes actually but it's not very frequent\nanymore\nand I really kind of just been exploring\nlike\nmostly\nidentity and goals and what's good\nwhat's right and wrong and it's just\nI don't know I'm at the point where none\nof this actually makes sense anymore\nsure it can make sense when I think\nabout it but like just because it when I\nthink about it and if I try to make\nsense of it sure but if I don't it's\nlike they never existed at all\nlike there was never a problem or an\nissue I think I'm sort of with you\nJohnny so a couple of things the first\nthing is that you know if you are\nfeeling suicidal or you're in danger or\nanything I don't know if you've ever\nbeen in clinical treatment before but\nthat's worth looking into\num that was a long time ago I'm not that\nat that point anymore okay so it just uh\nyou know just a\nshare that because I think the\ndiscussion will be incomplete we don't\nhave to focus on that today but you know\nsince we're not going to be focusing on\nthat I just wanted to mention it\nso here's the thing\nlet me ask you a couple questions Johnny\nyeah first is are would you say that\nyou're at peace\nI think we need to Define peace first\nbecause are you talking about feeling\nlike is there does it feel peaceful or\nis okay how would you define peace\nbecause okay that's something\nI'm gonna say no\nso anytime I ask that question and\nsomeone asks how do you define peace I'm\njust going to assume no so like or I\nknow it's kind of weird maybe that's a\nlittle bit arrogant but I think that\na piece is this is like sort of a\nsubjective experience of contentment\nand tranquility\nand oftentimes when someone asks me in a\nlogical way like where are the\nboundaries of Peace the answer is sort\nof no\npeople who are at peace kind of know\nthat they're at peace\nwhat if I don't know of that piece\nbecause that means that we're not there\nokay okay so I'm making assumptions here\nwhich is okay okay so I just wanted to\nmake sure because now we're going to get\nto where that lack of peace comes from\nokay\nso you said if I become something\nwhat am I losing out on\nright\nwhat's wrong with losing out on\nsomething\nI feel like becoming something makes me\nless adaptable what's wrong with that\nthere's nothing wrong with it it's just\nI have a preference to adapt over being\nsomething very specific\nwhere does that preference come from\nI don't know I guess I just like\nexploring things I kind of want to have\neverything instead of being hyper\nfocused on one thing yep right so\nwhy uh\nlet me think if I can\nask this question in a different way\nso\nyou like exploring things and this is\ngoing to sound kind of weird do you like\nexploring things out of like a positive\nfeeling and I'm not necessarily meaning\nemotion or a negative feeling\nuh can I say both\nyes can you help me understand that\nuh so this is something kind of recent\nbut I actually it's hard for me to\nidentify positive and negative emotions\nmore like it's not that I don't have\nthem it's more like the label positive\nand negative it mostly gets used does it\nfeel good or does it feel bad but one\nisn't more positive or more negative\nthey're just different\nokay so I like so I guess because I\nenjoy both feelings that feel good and\nfeelings that are discomfortable because\nthey're just feelings yep good so I'll\nkind of ask again\nso like what's the harm\nin losing out on experiences\nI don't know there's a harm it's more of\na I feel like I'm giving away part of my\nlike freedom to choose if I be something\nspecific what's wrong with giving away a\npart of your freedom to choose\nI just like having options\nwhy\num\nhonestly if I didn't have options I can\nadapt to whatever I'm being asked to do\nand that's fine too\nuh so I have no doubt that you can adapt\nyou've shown us that you can adapt and\nyou have adapted over and over and over\nagain what I'm asking is what is the\norigin of your preference for Freedom\nover not freedom\nI think it has to do with the way I grew\nup like I had a lot of freedom to kind\nof do whatever I wanted so I did a lot\nof things\nokay can you tell me a little bit about\nthat\nyeah I was kind of just left to my own\ndevices growing up so I just did\nwhatever I wanted as long as I did good\nin school\nand what was that like for you\nit was cool being able to do a lot of\nthings but at the same time it was kind\nof isolating because I was just doing\nthings to kind of pass time\nokay so have you\nokay so let me toss something out Johnny\nlet me see if you you're so generally\nspeaking when I hear people say\nsomething like if I become something\nwhat am I missing out on\num\nI kind of hear some amount of like loss\naversion there\nso like what I'm almost hearing is like\nif I had if I had to guess and this is\ntricky because you're clearly you've\ndone a lot of spiritual practice so I I\nsee this as like\nyou have so much spiritual resistance to\nsome particular things and you have so\nmuch spiritual growth that it doesn't\nquite affect you the way that it would\nlike the average person that's what\nmakes this kind of tricky\nso like your ability to tolerate\nparticular fears or anxieties or\nnegative things your ability to accept\nthose makes it sort of like they're not\nas it's not as clear\nbut what I'm essentially hearing is that\nyou know I I'm almost hearing some\namount of like safety loss aversion or\nfear does that resonate with you at all\num a tiny bit if there's a loss of\nversion I guess I just I'm averse to\nlosing free time because I like just\nbeing with myself a lot\nso but what what makes it why would you\nhave to lose free time\nI guess would I be something I get kind\nof hyper focused where I forget to slow\ndown and relax sometimes is that a\nproblem\nonly if I get burnt out but I don't I'm\nnot afraid of the burnout it's more of a\nwhen the burnout happens it sucks but\nI'm okay with it when it happens\nokay so generally speaking Johnny we\navoid things when we're afraid of the\nconsequences does that make sense\nyeah it does so what I'm trying to\nfigure out what I'm getting from you is\nthat there's some amount of avoidance\nright you're saying that if I become\nsomething I lose out on something else I\nbecome less adaptable\nright yeah so what I'm hearing there is\nthat you value adaptability\nabsolutely why do you value adaptability\nwhere did you learn the mean the value\nof adaptability\nwell it's definitely my comfort zone\nbecause\num because growing up like I had a lot\nof anxiety so I had to learn to adapt to\neverything that kind of came in okay and\nso if you're not able to adapt what does\nthat mean for you\nwell I'm probably gonna freak out\nalthough it doesn't really happen very\nvery much anymore so that's kind of\ninteresting right yeah so what I'm sort\nof hearing is that if you become\nsomething you lose adaptability if you\nlose adaptability then you're no longer\nable to protect yourself against\nfreaking out\num what do you think about that\nnever really considered that so that's\npretty cool\nbut what do you think about it\n[Music]\num\nI think it's interesting but I don't\nknow if it's like\num\nwell it's so new to me that I don't\nreally have a response to it if I'm\nbeing honest that's fair enough that's\nthat's great so it's clear you're a\ncontemplative person so my point is that\nwhen I hear you talk I'm getting some\nkind of fear or aversion and it makes\nsense right so like what I'm hearing is\nthat adaptability is protective for you\nand so sacrificing your adaptability\nmeans opening yourself up to not being\nable to adapt to crap that happens\nright because if you can't adapt then\nlike then you're gonna have to suffer\nlike where would you be if you couldn't\nadapt what would your life be like\nJohnny\nif I couldn't adapt I feel like I just\nbe at Rock Bottom there we go\nright so now we understand like\nokay so making a choice and becoming\nsomething\nis in a weird indirect way connected to\nhitting rock bottom\ndo you see that\nI'm starting to see the connection but\nI'm not sure if I'm completely there\nthat's totally fine\nso that's something for you to think\nabout here's the other thing since\nyou're you're you've spent a lot of time\nspiritually exploring stuff\nso\nyou know how you were saying earlier\nthat when you adopt a particular\nidentity that's sort of like an act\nwell who is the you that's underneath\nthe ACT\nthat's the weird thing I have no idea\nand I thought well I actually saw a guru\nto kind of talk about that a few months\nago\nbut then she kind of hushed me and said\njust kind of pay attention and watch it\ncarefully and I've kind of just stopped\nquestioning it and just paying attention\nand and what honestly yeah\nit just seems like not things don't make\nsense but they're not making sense make\nsense I don't know if that makes sense\nit makes sense\nso\ncan you tell me anything about\nthe you that's underneath the ACT\nit's hard to describe it because I don't\nknow if there's a thing\nbut I remember having this kind of\nexperience where\nwell I kind of talked to someone about\nthis and I was like I could feel\nsomething that's not a feeling it's like\nI can feel and it feels deeply but it's\nnot related to feeling and emotion and\nthat was that thing feels very intimate\num\nbut I'm not sure if that's me or\nsomething else it's just something that\nwas kind of new yeah so I I I think\nyou've got it right Johnny\nso when people in ancient India tried to\nunderstand the you underneath they came\nup with one description\nand that was Neti Neti\nwhich means not this not this\nso the you underneath what they\ndiscovered is if you ask it is it good\nthey'll say no is it bad they'll say no\nis it old they'll say no is it young\nthey'll say no\nis it outside no is it inside no\nit's like a thing I I like your\ndescription that it's intimate but it's\nformless\nbut it's real\ndoes that sort of make sense\nyeah yeah so now I've got a question for\nyou you're afraid of adapting and\nbecoming something\nand then you won't be something else so\nI've got a question what is it that\nchanges within you when you adapt is it\nthe part on top or the part in the\nmiddle\noh it's the part on Top the middle thing\nis like it doesn't give a damn to be\nhonest I can be an absolute monkey and\nit doesn't give a damn or it can be like\nan absolute Saint doesn't care so this\nis why like what I would ask you is is\nthen why does it matter\nright so like you can become whatever\nyou want to but the truth of the matter\nis I don't know how to say this but\nyou're only what you are\nyou can't be anything else\nyeah so I guess the thing is the I don't\nlike using the outside and inside\nbecause even that doesn't make sense\nanymore but just for the sake of\ncommunication with words that it makes\nsense but on the outside it's like\nif I become something\nI feel like I'm giving away part of that\nfreedom that I know on the inside or\nlike I don't have to be there if I\ndidn't want to but yeah I can still make\nthe choice to be something yeah so it\ndefinitely takes a while so here's what\nI'd say the problem or the conflict that\nyou have is on the outside has nothing\nto do with on the inside there are\nlayers between completely outside and\ncompletely inside the completely inside\npart doesn't really care and this is\nwhere I don't know how to say this but\nlike essentially I think that your\nproblem is sort of false and I know it's\nweird to say I wouldn't say that right\nbecause it's all the crap on the outside\nit's all like mental faculties where\nyour your loss averse in some way\nbecause if you adapt or\nyou know so have you ever heard of the\nconcept of a stem cell\nI've heard the word but I don't quite\nknow what it is so you know like when\nwhen\nwe're single so like when a human being\nforms the first thing that forms is an\nembryo and that's an egg plus a sperm\nand it's one cell okay the first thing\nthat happens is like your one cell with\nyour 46 chromosomes you're not an eye\ncell you're not a heart cell you're not\na stomach cell you're not a neuron\nyou're not a skin cell you're just one\ncell and then that cell divides into two\nand then that cell divides into four\nthose cells divide into four and eight\nand so on and so forth those things are\ncalled stem cells\nyeah and certain stem cells are called\npluripotent stem cells which means that\nthis cell\ncan become whatever it wants to\nthen what happens is the cell\ndifferentiates\nand the moment that it differentiates it\nloses some potentiality\nso then you'll have like for example\nbone marrow cells and cells in your bone\nmarrow can become white blood cells or\nred blood cells but they cannot become\nneurons\nmm-hmm\nso the deepest part of you is like a\npluripotent stem cell and it's actually\nnever going to change\nthe more that you differentiate do you\nlose particular things actually yes\nbut why is that a problem\nis it even a problem\nright so a part of you think so because\na part of you is afraid that if you\nadapt in one way\nand something happens negative and\nyou're not able to adapt to that thing\nthat thing then you will suffer\nagreed\noh yeah\nright so like you're you're so afraid of\nlike\nlike you never want to put your money\ndown in One Direction You Want to Stay\nyou know like I always have one foot out\nthe door just in case you know right so\nso and I I think that's where you've got\nto be really really careful because\nthere are a couple of things and this\nyou have to decide the direction that\nyou want I'm assuming for a moment and I\ndo think that\nyou know you need to be able to do\nthings in a particular direction and\nhave faith in yourself that if problems\narise like you're going to be adaptable\nenough\nyeah especially already putting myself\nout there in these situations like you\nknow apparently I am adaptable even when\nI'm not trying to adapt\nright so I think that this is like this\nis all Bs at the top and anytime you're\nworried about it Johnny just go back\nunderwater just go beneath the surface\nand once you're at underneath the\nsurface the more time the more there's a\nconnection between the top and the\nbottom the more you will be at peace\nyeah I've definitely noticed that it\nfeels like I'm kind of connecting what I\nknow on the inside to kind of the more\nconventional outside where it's like\nit's almost kind of hard to distinguish\nin and out at times and so let me ask\nyou something the more that the more\ndifficult it is to distinguish in and\nout how do you feel about stuff\noh I feel incredible\nlike it it feels\npeaceful\nthere it is\nit just doesn't happen automatically\nsometimes it takes intention sometimes\nit is automatic so it actually gets to\nthe point where I don't even know what a\nchoice is even more anymore\nright so I think it's interesting that\nyou use the word peaceful because\nearlier you were asking me to define it\nbut now as I see your face\nI think you know what it means\neven though I wanted to put my camera on\nbecause I want to visually show you that\nI'm not just trying to make things up\nyou know I I I I I know you're not I can\nI can tell\nand I think going forward you know\nJohnny I would say that be aware that\nit's that loss aversion that kind of\nrestricts you in some way and the other\nthing is it's like okay for you to not\nconquer that right this second and at\nthe same time like I don't know how to\nsay this but you just don't have to be\nafraid of that could bad things happen\nif you make a choice and commit to\nsomething yes bad things can happen\nbut you don't have to be afraid of them\nand in fact when we\nstart letting the fear of bad things\nrestrict our choices control our choices\nthat's when we begin to suffer\nso if I'm dating someone\nand I think to myself if I marry this\nperson\nwhat if we get divorced\nwhat if they're not the one\nwhat if I spend 10 years with this\nperson and the person that I was really\nsupposed to marry\nI never end up meeting or spending time\nwith\nand so what can happen uh-huh I was\ngoing to say like that's a lot of what\nif instead of seeing what is\nwell set\nand so I've noticed\nwhat am I letting go\nif I become something what am I letting\ngo that was your question to which I\nwould say that's a lot of what ifs\ninstead of what is\nyeah so I guess I'm letting go of all\nthe what if 100 percent\nand what does it feel like to let go of\nthe what-ifs\nnice\npeople like it a lot peaceful it\ndefinitely takes a little bit of\ndeliberate action right now but\nsometimes it's automatic yep and the\nmore you deliberately practice the more\nautomatic it will be\nI'm gonna be honest after three months\nof this it's gotten easier but I also\nslightly wish I was better but at the\nsame time I'm not arguing with the fact\nthat I wish it was better well said that\nmakes sense yeah makes perfect sense\nright so you're recognizing that there's\na part of you that wants to approve\nimprove and you can follow that voice\nbut only to a certain extent\nyeah there should also be forgiveness\nthat I mean how can we expect you to be\nperfect when you were born Johnny\nwhat even is perfect\nright only happens when you think about\nit right 100 Perfection is created in\nthe mind\nwhat is reality is what is\nso in a weird way I think you have all\nthe answers they just need to be put\ntogether for you a little bit\nyeah when I spoke to her she just hushed\nme up and said just pay attention\nwhich is also the right answer in a\ndifferent way it's just not how I\noperate I've had teachers like that I\npersonally found that frustrating\nbut it's not wrong\nyeah that's what I kind of want to ask\nyou because it that was a very quick\nconversation work yeah so let me ask you\nJohnny just as we're kind of like\nbecause I I think what was the question\nyou asked me and what was the answer\nthat I gave you or that we came to\ntogether\nso the question could you repeat that\nagain yeah what was the question you\nasked me\noh the question I asked you at the start\nwhen we were talking or just now\nuh so do I have to become something\nbecause I don't want to lose my\nadaptability\nand what what have we learned together\ntoday\nyeah I can just commit and adapt while\nI'm committing and it's okay if things\ndon't turn out well because I'll adapt\nto them not turning out well\ngreat\nand if you feel bad at some point where\ncan you find peace\nwell there's nothing wrong with feeling\nbad feeling bad and just feeling bad\nokay well said any questions for me\nbefore we wrap up\num not really other than I just I guess\nI mostly came on because I'm just hoping\nI'm not like doing any like spiritual\nbypassing because being there once I\nnever if I go back there again I'll get\nout but I just don't want to go back\nthere again where I'm kind of\ndisregarding an aspect of life\nto try to get this\nthis like false piece that I thought I\nhad when I was younger I I think that\nthat's that makes a lot of sense so what\nI'm hearing is that sometimes people can\nuse spirituality as an escape\nand not really is like a positive thing\nand I think I don't know how to say this\nJohnny that's something that\nthe more you respect that possibility I\nthink the better off you're gonna be and\nI can't tell you that that'll never\nhappen again\nwhether that happens again depends on\nyour vigilance\nbut I have faith in you I think you're\ndoing great and I I think just keep\ndoing what you're doing and I'm not\nworried about you for what that's worth\nyeah I really I've I like to I I guess I\nthink I've kind of recommitted myself to\njust normal regular life because that is\na part of everything you know and I\nthought I was supposed to transcend that\nbut now I'm just kind of oh I couldn't\nbe a part of it but not like part of it\npart of it but engaged in it and it's\nit's a weird Balancing Act to be honest\nsure I'm still trying to get used to it\nso I'll share with you something that\none of my teachers told me and it really\nhelped me because I was ready for it and\nI suspect you may be ready for it too\nJohnny you need to be in the world but\nnot others Outdoors oh I know that\nright I've been told that before I know\nit so so I I think as you begin to\nreally understand that you'll find the\nbalance of you know because a lot and I\nthink you said it well that transcending\ndoesn't mean leaving\nthat was a very difficult thing to have\nto come across yeah\nI feel a bit emotional because I\ndefinitely went through the I really\nwanted to numb out so bad when I was\nyounger but now I love feeling things a\nlot\nyeah I'm I'm happy to hear that man it\nsounds like you went through some really\nchallenging times\nyeah yeah\nfinding you online definitely helped a\nlot I'm happy to hear that and\nfantastic\nand I don't really have anything else to\nadd other than thank you for listening\nthank you for speaking I think it helps\nnot only me but we learn something\ntogether today and it helps hopefully a\ncouple of people out there who are\nlistening so thank you very much Johnny\ngood luck to you my friend\nyeah I like your smile thank you bye I\nlike yours too adios\nall right\nso I don't know if like people were able\nto follow that conversation but\nlet me see if I can try to summarize\nso sometimes\nwe're afraid of becoming something\nbecause anything that I become\nis by definition something that I let go\nright\nso if I if I join the red team I'm not\non the blue team\nand it's our fear of like missing out on\nthe red team that keeps us from joining\nthe blue team but if we're not careful\nwe can go our entire lives\nworrying about what I will miss\nand thereby missing most of life\nyou get that\nit's like we're so paranoid about\nmissing out that we never do anything\nand then we end up missing out the most\nand so this is where I know it sounds\nkind of weird but like\nit's okay to miss out on things right\nyou can only make like if I have lunch\ntoday I can only eat what I eat and I\ncan't eat everything I can't pack all of\nthe joy of all of the potential lunches\nthat I could possibly eat today into one\nmeal it's impossible\nso stop living in the what-ifs and start\nliving in the what is"
