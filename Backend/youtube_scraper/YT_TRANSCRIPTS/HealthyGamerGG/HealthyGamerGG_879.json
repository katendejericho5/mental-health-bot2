    "transcript": "so when I go into a networking situation\nI don't go into those situations\nthinking okay what can this person do\nfor me what I tend to go to networking\nsituations for is trying to help people\nso everywhere I go if I'm sort of in a\nnetworking situation I'll sort of try to\nhelp people and I'll try to think okay\nlike how can I be helpful to this person\nare there opportunities that I know of\nthat could help this kind of person all\nright so today what we're going to talk\nabout are what I call five productivity\npitfalls what I've noticed is that there\nare a lot of people out there who will\ngive like productivity tips and talk\nabout success and talk about you know\nlike you gotta grind and you got to do\nthis and like this is these are all\nthese secrets to success and\nproductivity but what I've actually\nfound is that if you look at you know\ndifferent kinds of studies on\nproductivity and things like that as\nwell as like studies on neuroscience and\na fair amount of personal experience and\nworking as a psychiatrist what I've\nreally found is that a lot of the\nproductivity tips that people give sort\nof share or actually more pitfalls than\ntips and what I'd love to do is share\nwith you all five of those that in my\nopinion are kind of like debates okay so\nlet's start with number one number one\nis reading a lot of books so there's\nsort of this idea that if you read a lot\nof books you will be more successful\nright and that sort of makes sense\nbecause we know that books contain\nknowledge and like knowledge is sort of\na good thing and the more that we know\ndoesn't that mean we're going to kind of\nbe more successful and so there's\ncertainly value in books like especially\nif you look at places like you know\nmedical school where we do a ton of\nreading and I've read a ton of books and\nI learned a lot from them absolutely but\nI think what people sort of forget about\nreading a ton of books is that if you\nlook at the way the science of learning\nreading something passively doesn't\nactually increase understanding or\ndoesn't necessarily lead to better\noutcomes what really leads to good\noutcomes is like practical application\nof theoretical Concepts so if you look\nat medical school for example we'll read\na bunch in the first two years and then\nthe second two years of medical school\nat least in the united states are in the\nhospital and that's when you really\nstart to learn medicine the whole thing\nis that even after 40 Years of matter\nmedical school then you go into\nresidency which is anywhere from like\nthree to seven years of practical\napplication and training and so a lot of\npeople will sort of think okay like I'm\ngonna read books or if I was more\nproductive I would read more books or I\nshouldn't read more books or that person\nover there reads so much they must be\nreally amazing but that doesn't actually\nincrease your productivity or make you\nmore successful so why are we so hung up\non reading books and there's an\ninteresting psychological angle to this\nso the first thing to understand is when\nwe think about reading a book we imagine\nthat we'll get some kind of benefit by\nreading the book right so if I look at\nlet's say the seven habits Seven Habits\nof Highly Effective People and I think\nto myself okay if I learn those seven\nhabits then I will be a highly effective\nperson so we sort of look at a book and\nwe associate that with a potential game\nand then if you're like me sometimes\nyou'll struggle to actually read the\nbook because reading books is actually\nhard and so since books are hard to read\nwhat ends up happening is okay if if I\nread this book I will get better in this\nway but then and it's hard for me to\nread and so I never really finished the\nbook and I sort of assume that if I had\nread the book I would have gotten better\nI would have learned this and then what\nhappens is we look at someone else who\nhas read the book and then we kind of\nmake an assumption that oh this person\nread that book so they must have gotten\nbetter in that way that I was hoping I\nwould get better at and so as this kind\nof piles up if you think to yourself\nokay if I read this book I would be\nbetter at social skills if I read this\nbook I would have better sleep hygiene\nif I read this book I would be better at\nemotional processing so as you look kind\nof like like pile up all of these\npotential gains from books and you never\nread those books you think okay all of\nthose are unrealized gains and then you\nlook at someone else who has read all of\nthose books and then you're thinking oh\nmy God that person must be amazing at\ntalking to their co-workers have a good\nsleep schedule do all this amazing stuff\nand so it's almost from our own pitfalls\nof not being able to read books that we\nsort of overvalue what books actually\nbring us so I'm not saying that reading\nbooks is a bad thing I read a ton I've\nyou know very much value reading books\nbut oftentimes we sort of think about\nbooks as like this singular activity\nthat if we did a lot of we would\nmagically be better at stuff and in my\nexperience books without practical\napplication are actually not that useful\nthat there's a theoretical understanding\nthere which you can absolutely get but\nthe real work is actually internal so\nthe real value of books is to sort of\ntrigger an introspection and as you go\nthrough that introspection that's where\nthe real yield comes from and the other\ntricky thing is that if the yield comes\nfrom the introspection we don't\nnecessarily have to read the book to go\nthrough that process so the first\nproductivity Pitfall is actually reading\nbooks because at the end of the day I\ndon't know that reading 100 books makes\nyou a hundred times better at life the\nsecond thing that I want to talk a\nlittle bit about which is of growing\ninterests and importance is multitasking\nso this is where we've got to be super\ncareful because generally speaking a lot\nof people will value multitasking\nthey'll even take pride and sort of\nbeing able to do a thousand different\nthings at once and there's absolutely\nvalue to being able to sort of parallel\nprocess maintain multiple workflows\nthere's no question that being able to\njuggle a couple of things is useful the\nissue though is that if you really look\nat the mind the mind can literally only\nfocus on one task at a time so if you\nthink about let's say the last time you\ntook an exam like you weren't working on\n15 questions all at once right when you\ntake an exam you look at one question\nand you can only occupy one thing at a\ntime with your mind even if you're at\nwork well people will sort of talk about\nokay I'm multitasking during a meeting\nyou're kind of half paying attention to\nthe meeting half doing something else\nand there may be like a part of the\nmeeting that's a little bit useless I'm\nnot saying that it isn't but even during\nthe meeting like when you're really\nfocused on a particular task you're not\npaying attention to the meeting and if\nyou're really absorbed in the meeting\nyou're not really able to work at the\nsame time so if we look at sort of\nmultitasking I think that managing\nparallel workflows is generally speaking\nlike an important skill but there almost\nseems to be this value judgment on being\nable to multitask over being able to\nsingle task and the way that I kind of\nput it is like if you kind of think\nabout it okay let's say I'm in emergency\nroom physician and I've got 15 patients\nin the emergency room and I'm kind of\nworking on all of them is that useful\nsure but it's not like the emergency\nroom physician who's juggling 15\npatients over the course of five hours\nis better than the neurosurgeon who's in\na five hour surgery focusing on one\npatient and even in the case of the\nemergency room physician anytime they go\nin and they're seeing patient number one\nthey're not actually thinking about\npatient number 15. in fact when you look\nat studies of Emergency Room Physicians\nwho do that those are the ones that\nactually make more errors right so I'm\nnot saying that parallel processing for\nmultiple workflows is a bad thing but\ngenerally speaking we sort of value\nbeing able to juggle a bunch of things\nover focusing on one task and if you\nliterally look at the science of\ncognition the brain can really only\nfocus on one thing at a time so I'd be\nsuper careful about multitasking and\nespecially\nprioritizing multitasking over focusing\non a single task at a time the next\nthing that I want to talk to you all\nabout is where we start to get a little\nbit tricky this is going to sound kind\nof weird but the next thing I want to\ntalk to you all about is having a side\nhustle so when I hear a lot of these\nproductivity people out there these\nsuccess gurus and stuff like that\nthey'll talk about having a side hustle\nand this is sort of the idea that you've\ngot one particular kind of work that you\ndo and something that you devote\nyourself to and then you do something\nelse on the side to bring in extra cash\nto kind of like you know optimize your\nyour time throughout the week and\ngenerally speaking I think side hustles\nare just a waste of time and you may say\nlike wait wait why can you say that\nisn't it like good to be hustling on the\nside all the time and I don't really\nthink so so if you look at actually you\nknow what yields better outcomes or what\nwhat correlates with like median income\nit generally speaking is going to be\nadvancement in a particular field so for\nexample let's say I go to residency\nright so I'm a medical doctor so I do\nAdvanced education and then I become a\npsychiatrist if you look at different\nkinds of\num you know sub-specialties\nsub-specialty training generally\nspeaking improves your earning power\nright so I can go to medical school I\ncan become a general practitioner and\nthen I can become a cardiologist and if\nI become a cardiologist I'm going to\ndouble my income so what we tend to see\nis that in any given profession rather\nthan investing let's say 20 hours a week\nin a completely different field what's\noftentimes much more useful is investing\nany extra time that you have in building\nwhat you kind of initially have a\nfoundation on so if for example you go\nback back and get an MBA if you for\nexample go get a CFA certification or\nI've talked to people who've gotten\nmediation certifications I've worked\nwith programmers who've learned\nadditional program programming languages\nas opposed to starting a real estate\nside hustle and the key thing to\nremember is that Society tends to Value\ndeep expertise and a particular area it\ntends to Value being an expert or having\na particular Niche and if we think about\nthe concept of a side hustle I've got a\nfoundation already that I'm building up\non and then now I'm going to start real\nestate over here which then I'm going to\nstart building from the ground up and if\nyou really look at sort of the the the\nyields on a given hour of effort the\nhigher up you go the more you actually\nget from investing in that same kind of\ntower of of a career so I know that a\nlot of people will sort of emphasize\nside hustles and doing stuff on the side\nbut generally speaking in my experience\nit's been a lot better to just invest in\nwhat you're already doing and kind of\nlike move from the ninth floor to the\n10th floor instead of the first floor to\nthe second floor over here now there's\nan important caveat here which is that\neven healthy gamer was a side hustle for\nme so I'm not saying that side hustles\ndon't have a place but that once again I\nthink the the real place for a side\nhustle is that if you've got a\nparticular career and you want to make a\ntransition this isn't something that's\nforever going to be a side Hustle the\ngoal is to try to do something that you\ncan transition into oftentimes that's\nsomething where you can't really abandon\none career and jump directly from one\nboat to another this is where you've got\nto invest a little bit on the side and\nstart to develop something and as\nsomething grows you kind of scale back\nand this is something that I've tried to\ndo a lot at healthy gamer which is not\nhave a full-time job and then healthy\ngamer on top so as healthy gamer began\nto grow I actually cut back on my\nprivate practice hours to like 20 hours\na week and then 10 hours a week and then\nfive hours a week and so I'd be super\ncareful about the idea that a side\nhustle is better than just investing in\nwhat you're already building that brings\nus to productivity Pitfall number four\nwhich in general is hustle culture so\nthere's this idea that the more you work\nthe more successful you will be and this\nis a big part of hustle culture right\nit's like every hour of every day I'm\ngonna maximize my Roi I'm going to be\nhustling and it's like it's people who\nput in 80 hours a week 90 hours a week\n100 hours a week 120 hours a week those\nare the people who are most successful\nand I don't know how to say this but\nlike if you look at the science of\nperformance that just isn't true in fact\nquite the opposite so the first thing\nthat I want y'all to think about for a\nsecond is that there are people who will\nwork 80 hours a week and those people\nwho work 80 hours a week can be\ninvestment bankers they can be resident\nPhysicians they can also be fast food\nworkers I've worked with line Cooks who\nwill work 80 hours a week 90 hours a\nweek and what they have to show for it\nis so much less than what an investment\nbanker does even in terms of investment\nbanking if you look at things like\nprivate Equity or venture capital or\nAngel funding Angel Investing working\nmore hours doesn't necessarily mean that\nyou are more successful or more\nproductive those two don't necessarily\ncorrelate now I'm not saying that there\nisn't any correlation so generally\nspeaking you know you have to put in a\ncertain amount of time to be successful\nor productive in any field but there's\nsort of this idea that working 80 hours\n90 hours 100 hours 120 hours is better\nthan working 30 hours 40 hours or 50\nhours and this is where if you look at\nthe science of performance we actually\ndiscovered that that's actually not true\nso let's understand that a little bit so\nthere's there's there have been some\nreally interesting studies on this\nconcept of what we call you stress so\nwe're all familiar with this term\ndistress which is that when the stress\nlevel that we're in gets so high that it\nactually causes a a negative impact in\nour performance but there's also the\nscience of something called eustress\nwhich is the optimal level of stress for\nperformance and basically if you look at\nthe science of you stress what it shows\nis that if our stress level is too low\nwe get bored right so if I'm like let's\nsay I'm playing kickball with a bunch of\ntwo-year-olds I'm not going to play the\nbest kickball of my life because I'm\nplaying against two-year-olds and it's\njust kind of boring and it's kind of\ncompletely lopsided and unfair and\nthings like that right it's kind of like\nplaying chess against a three-year-old\nlike you don't have to use all of your\nfaculties so when our stress level is\ntoo low we actually enter into the\nboredom State and as we enter into the\nboredom State we're not going to be as\nproduct as the stress level increases as\nwe get more engaged we actually enter\nthis period of eustress which is this\nmiddle Zone where we're so where a\ncertain level of stressed out that we're\nactually mentally very activated and\nfocused on the task if we go into if we\npass that u-stress zone and enter the\ndistress Zone that's when we start to\nfeel overwhelmed overworked and that\nnegatively impacts our performance so\nfor example working 100 hours a week and\nsleeping four hours a night is probably\ngoing to negatively impact your\nperformance versus working you know 40\nto 50 hours a week and sleeping eight\nand a half or nine hours a night this is\nsomething that I learned kind of in a\nsense the hard way in medical school\nwhere I saw a bunch of students who were\nlike studying for 10 hours a day I tried\nto do the same thing and what I sort of\nfound is that my absorption or my recall\nreally started to diminish after hour\nfour or five six seven eight I was in\nsuch a Perpetual state of exhaustion\nthat the yield that I was getting from\nstudying was incredibly low instead of\nwhat I did in med school is studied for\njust two hours a day first thing in the\nmorning and I found that when I studied\nfor two hours in the at the beginning of\nthe day that my mind was so fresh and I\nwas so focused that everything that I\nstudied kind of really sank in and then\nI would go to class and go to study\ngroups and other things like that in the\nafternoon and that would sort of be my\nrepetition or reinforcement but\nessentially what I discovered in medical\nschool is studying more isn't actually\ndoesn't actually like correlate with\nhigher test scores there even have even\nbeen studies on this where if you look\nat sort of what correlates with the best\ngrades on tests it actually comes down\nto organization and sort of blocking off\nparticular periods of time for\nparticular amounts of study and the last\nthing that we're going to talk a little\nbit about is also something that I hear\na lot from hustle culture which is\nputting yourself first so a lot of\npeople out there will sort of say that\nyou know this is a dog eat dog world and\nthat if you want to get ahead in life\nyou've got a prioritize yourself no\none's going to look out for you so you\ngot to look out for yourself everywhere\nyou go you know it's all about you it's\nall about your growth your success you\nknow it life is is a competition it's a\nrace right I'm behind in someone else's\nad so there's this very competitive\naspect of life where one person comes\nout on top and everyone else second\nthrough 100th place is no good right\nit's like that's sort of this attitude\nthat people have where you got to put\nyourself first in my experience that's\nactually not the case where what I've\nreally found is that prioritizing other\npeople in a lot of situations is\nactually the best thing in terms of your\nproductivity and success and I know this\nmay sound kind of weird but even the\npeople who believe that I think they\nbelieve it for a good reason which is\nthat it's been their experience but I\nwant to Tunnel down into why people\nbelieve that and why that's their\nexperience and why it's actually wrong\nso if I prioritize myself right if I put\nmyself first what do you think the\npeople around me how will they respond\nright so if I'm like if I'm a Gunner and\nI'm I'm gonna be at the top of the class\nI'm gonna get straight A's I'm going to\nget promoted how will the people around\nme start treating me how will they\nbehave towards me so as I very very you\nknow in a and not a vocal but even in a\nbehavior kind of way as people sort of\nfigure out that I really am putting\nmyself first people are gonna stop\nlooking out for me right people are\ngonna stop caring about me as much\nthey're not going to prioritize me and\nso the interesting thing about putting\nyourself first and this idea that no one\nis going to look out for you so you've\ngot to look out for yourself is that a\nlot of that actually comes from them\nlooking out from the for themselves so\nwhen I put myself first and I put\neveryone else second they're going to\nactually do the same thing and so it\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where\nI sort of this has been my experience\nthat no one's been looking out for me\nbut that's because very vocally I've\nonly been looking out for myself so why\non Earth would anyone look out for me\nwhen I make it very clear that I don't\ngive a about that so in my\nexperience actually this is a huge\nproductivity Pitfall that if you're\nalways looking out for yourself and\nyou're kind of number one in every\nsituation then other people are going to\nstart stop looking out for you and if\nother people stop looking out for you\nthat's going to create all kinds of\nproblems in terms of lack of\nprofessional opportunities in terms of\npeople not asking you for help in terms\nof all kinds of things and in my\nexperience sort of prioritizing other\npeople can actually lead to a lot of\ngood outcomes so when I care about the\npeople around me and when I'm sort of\nwilling to make sacrifices for the\nbenefit of people around me people\nappreciate that you know in some way may\nwant to repay you people may start\nlooking out for you people maybe have\nmaybe have access to opportunities that\nyou may be a good fit for that they're\nnot a good fit for and they'll pass\nthose kinds of opportunities along I\nthink a good example of this is\nnetworking so everyone's like oh you got\na network to get to get ahead you got a\nnetwork to get ahead and there's\nabsolutely a lot of value to networking\nbut I think the attitude when you go\ninto a networking situation can\ndrastically alter what outcomes you get\nso when I go into a networking situation\nI don't go into those situ situations\nthinking okay what can this person do\nfor me what I tend to go to networking\nsituations for is trying to help people\nso everywhere I go if I'm sort of in a\nnetworking situation I'll sort of try to\nhelp people and I'll try to think okay\nlike how can I be helpful to this person\nare there opportunities that I know of\nthat could help this kind of person and\nI will actually sometimes prioritize\npeople ahead of myself and in my\nexperience that actually works really\nwell so you've got to be really careful\nabout people who sort of talk about okay\nyou gotta Pro you got to put yourself\nfirst because ain't no one going to\nwatch out for you now I don't think that\nyou should always put other people ahead\nof yourself I think you should look out\nfor your own opportunities and take\nopportunities and when other people\noffer you opportunities you should\naccept them with gratitude if they're\naligned with what you want to do so\nwe're not saying be a doormat we're not\nsaying always put yourself last or\nalways put yourself second but I do\ndefinitely think it's incorrect to\nalways put yourself first so just to\nkind of summarize I think there's a lot\nof information out there about\nproductivity pitfalls there are a lot of\npeople out there who will say a lot of\nthings about productivity and success\nand you got to do this and you got to do\nthis and you got to do this and you got\nto do this if you do these kinds of\nthings then you will be productive you\nwill be successful and in my experience\na lot of that stuff just isn't accurate\nand the science really doesn't support\nit the first on the list is reading\nbooks and so I'm I'm a huge fan of\nreading books I have a you know I have a\ngigantic bookshelf with probably y'all\ncan see in the back like I've got\nprobably 200 to 300 books in my office\nand I've read most of them and there's a\nlot of value to it but the key thing is\nthat reading a book in and of itself\ndoes not actually lead to behavioral\nchange or any kind of concrete\nImprovement the other thing to remember\nis that there are oftentimes many\nalternatives to reading books that will\nallow you to better apply those\nprinciples a simple example of that is\nyou can read a book about trauma or you\ncan go see a therapist who focuses on\ntrauma and those two two things will\nyield very very different outcomes the\nsecond thing that we want to watch out a\nlittle bit for is multitasking so it's\nabsolutely important to sometimes be\nable to juggle parallel workflows or to\nbe able to on a macro level work on\nmultiple tasks at a time the key thing\nto remember though is that your brain\ncan really only focus on one thing at a\ntime and in fact the more split your\nfocus is the worse your performance is\ngoing to be so we understand this in\nterms of surgical outcomes and you can\nsort of understand it yourself where\nlike I don't know if you all have ever\nwatched a TV show or movie while you're\non your phone and if you're on your\nphone you're going to enjoy the movie or\nTV show less and you're gonna enjoy\nwhatever you're doing on your phone less\nso we tend to find is that distracting\nthe Mind actually leads to poorer\noutcomes the third thing to think a\nlittle bit about is having a side hustle\nand this is where a lot of people will\ntalk about you know having a side hustle\nbecause that's where you make that extra\nmoney it's sort of like on the side it's\nextra it's great but oftentimes if you\nlook at what actually correlates with\nthe best median income it's usually\ninvesting in your primary professional\nfoundation so whether that's sort of\ngetting an advanced degree whether\nthat's something like doing a fellowship\nor additional trainings there's a lot of\nstuff that if you've already built a\nfoundation moving from you know floor\nfive to floor six and floor seven is\ngoing to be worth more investing 20\nhours and sort of moving up two floors\nis going to be worth more than a side\nhustle where you're kind of starting at\nthe bottom and building from the ground\nup there are absolutely situations where\nside hustles can be useful and good so I\nmyself started healthy gamer as a side\nHustle but at some point you know you\nwant to make that transition and the\ngoal of a side hustle I really think the\nideal situation for side hustle is when\nyou're sort of trying to experiment with\nsomething but you don't want to kind of\ngive something up over here the next\nthing to talk about in general is hustle\nculture and this core idea that that to\nbe more productive and more successful\nyou've got to put in more time whereas\nin my experience it's just not like that\nso if you look at something like the\nscience of you stress what we sort of\ndiscover is that happy healthy\nwell-rested focused appropriately\nchallenged individuals are the ones that\nsort of yield the best performance and\nI've even done corporate Consulting at\nmajor companies where we sort of try to\nemphasize this right so why do places\nlike investment Banks you know why do\nthey call me in it's to help them sort\nof adapt their culture to actually\nhaving like happy healthy appropriately\nchallenged employees it's not trying to\nget people to work 80 hours 90 hours 100\nhours a week what are the carrots or\nincentives that we can use to get people\nto work more and burn out I've done a\nlot of work especially with things like\njob turnover where in the financial\nindustry sometimes like there's some\ninvestment banks that have very high\nturnover they work people to the ground\nand those people end up leaving because\nthey get good opportunities elsewhere\nthey're high performers and since\nthey're high performers and they're\nbeing treated like crap they're going to\nmove somewhere else where they'll be\ntreated a little bit better and once\nthat person leaves you're sort of left\nwith this issue of like having to train\nup an entirely new person which costs\nyou a ton so working harder isn't\nnecessarily better and in fact there's a\nlot of research that shows that working\na decent amount is actually the best way\nto get Optimal Performance the last\nthing to think a little bit about is\nthat a lot of people who are sort of\nproductivity success gurus will sort of\ntalk a little bit about you got to put\nyourself first no one else is going to\nlook out for you and it's a dog eat dog\nworld old and you got to look out for\nyourself and while I think that you\nshould prioritize yourself at times I\nthink you've got to be super careful\nbecause they sort of are engaging in a\nself-fulfilling prophecy whereas if I'm\nif I'm looking out only for myself and I\nalways come number one in my book other\npeople will stop caring about me other\npeople will stop trying to help me\nbecause if I'm only looking out for\nmyself there's going to be no\nreciprocity so oddly enough in my\nexperience if you actually try to help\nthe people around you and you sometimes\nyou know go out of your way to help\nsomeone and even if you don't get\nanything for it like if you help another\nhuman being out and they're never able\nto return the favor and you spend five\nhours of your life trying to guide\nsomeone who's 10 years younger than you\nand you get no compensation for it oh my\nGod it's what's the ROI on that\ninvestment it's nothing you didn't get\nany Roi from helping out another human\nbeing oh my God turns out that sometimes\nhelping human beings is just like okay\nto do and you don't need to optimize\nyour Roi you can actually make the world\na better place you can actually try to\nhelp someone else out and make life a\nlittle bit easier because Lord knows it\nain't too it ain't easy enough so these\nare common things that I think I would\nencourage you all to be a little bit\nmore critical about some of these\ntruisms of productivity or success which\nin my experience aren't they're just not\nthat true so think a little bit\ncritically about it and let's like take\na look at some questions swamini is\nsaying helping others out without gains\nno absolutely yeah this altruism crap is\nreally lowering the ROI on the stream\nfor me yeah so LJ dude 516 is if you\nneed to justify it with an Roi someone\nelse being better off automatically\napplies to the overall average and will\neventually increase overall happiness\nthat's a great Insight right so that's\nlike that's the key thing about trying\nto help out other people is that if you\nthink about it the total rois is\nprobably positive and probably\noverwhelmingly so it's like if I know\nhow to change a tire and someone else\ndoesn't know how to change a tire and I\nteach them how to change a tire it it\nturns their time investment from five\nhours into one hour it cost me one hour\nso we're spending two hours for a five\nhour investment they just see the Lion's\nShare of that and this is the whole\nthing about being a little bit\naltruistic is that once people recognize\nthat they're gonna try to help you out\ntoo and that's where like things just\nget better so hop day train is saying\nmentoring others is the best way to\ncement your own skills bettering skills\nleads to more money better offers more\nPTO Etc that's the other thing I mean I\ntend to agree with that right so even in\nteaching and helping other people out\nyou're probably getting something out of\nit as well"
