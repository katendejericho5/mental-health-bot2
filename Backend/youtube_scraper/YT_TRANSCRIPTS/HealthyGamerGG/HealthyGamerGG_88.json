    "transcript": "[Music]\n[Music]\nn\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\n[Music]\nall righty chat let's get started we\ntried to fix our audio hopefully it\nworked we all can think the tech teller\nthe one the\nonly the absolutely beautiful Tech\nteller okay so today chat welcome to\nanother healthy gamer G stream my name\nis Dr Alo Keno\neven though I am a doctor I strongly\nencourage all to remember that\neverything we discussed on stream today\nis intended to be taken as educational\nor educational\nentertainment that's what we're doing\nhere we're not treating any psychiatric\nillnesses we're not practicing medicine\nhere we're just talking about mental\nhealth um so just a reminder that\neverything we discuss on stream today is\nintended to be taken as education or is\nfor entertainment purposes if youall\nhave a medical concern or question\nplease go a licensed professional and um\nyeah so this is that is not this just\njust a quick reminder okay I feel like\nthat was a fragmented disclaimer so\nwe're going to do it again welcome to\nanother healthy gamer G stream my name\nis allo kenoa just a reminder that\nalthough I'm a doctor nothing we discuss\non stream today is intended to be taken\nas medical advice everything is for\neducational or entertainment purposes\nonly if youall have a medical concern or\nquestion please go see a licensed\nprofessional isn't it better when we\njust do it the regular way chat um yeah\nso that's going to be especially true\ntoday because today we're going to be\ntalking about dissociation and\ndepersonalization so we're going to do\nkind of a deep dive I'm actually super\nexcited about today um this has felt\nlike something that is very difficult to\ndo and we'll talk a little bit about why\nthat is um but I feel like really good\nabout it I've been working on it for a\nlittle while it's such a complicated\ntopic and the reason it's a complicated\ntopic is because we don't have on the\none hand we have a lot of science on it\nbut the science is super fragmented\ninvolves a lot of different regions of\nthe brain and we don't quite know what's\ngoing on and on the other hand we don't\nknow much about it right so it's like\nit's one of these phenomenon that we\nhaven't been able to reduce to like just\none thing so sometimes in Psychiatry we\ncan like sort of figure out what's wrong\nokay you've got OCD like we understand\nwhat is going on in OCD it is a pattern\nof obsessions which are intrusive\nthoughts and then compulsions which are\nbehaviors that address the anxiety of\nthose thoughts but with\ndissociation it is a loss of the sense\nof self or depersonalization so we feel\ndisconnected so what does that mean\nright so getting into that is something\nthat we're going to do today the other\nreally interesting thing about\ndissociation is\nthat we um we don't we haven't gone too\nmuch into it because from an epid\nemologic\nperspective dissociation and\ndepersonalization are rare right so like\nif we look at something like a mood\ndisorder like depression it affects like\nmaybe 30% of people so we talk a lot\nabout depression we have a whole guide\nto depression we talk about lack of\nmotivation we talk about how to find\nhappiness because that affects a lot of\npeople so one of the reasons that we\ntalk a little bit less about\ndissociation which we have a whole guide\nto trauma now that goes into it is\nbecause I thought that it affected very\nfew people and we used to think it\naffected very few people but as we'll\nlearn today it affects a ton of people\num and we'll kind of go into like why\nthat is and specifically like I'm going\nto just do a quick spoiler alert as to\nlater in\nthe Stream hold\non okay attachment disorganization and\ndissociation in virtual world a study on\nproblematic internet use among players\nof online roleplaying games\nwhat\n13.5% scored above the IAT cut off there\nwas a high prevalence of attachment\ndisorganization\n47% so it turns out that technology is\nactually really playing into our\ndissociative abilities and we're we're\ngoing to dig into that and I think a lot\nof the problems that we see today are\nare like a lot of the problems that like\nwe see online I just connected these\ndots like literally in the last 24 hours\nso like I'm I'm not motivated I don't\nknow what to do with my life I don't\nfeel like doing anything I feel socially\nanxious I have intrusive ruminating\nthoughts I daydream a lot this is all\npotentially related to\ndissociation so from becoming a fringe\ntopic which is intellectually and\nacademically interesting I think we have\nnow stumbled on possibly what is one of\nof the biggest emerging growing problems\nin our world which is that we're all\ndissociating a little bit more okay so\nnow I feel hyped about it it's going to\nbe challenging because there's just a\nlot to cover um let me get through some\nof\nthis okay so before we get into that a\ncouple of quick\nannouncements so first of all\num I wanted to give a huge thank you and\nexpress a lot of gratitude for people\nwho uh have signed up with memberships\nso um I don't know if yall remember this\nbut we launched me memberships a few\nmonths ago and the purpose of\nmemberships is to do a couple of things\none is to do more content uh the second\nis to do more in-depth content so what\nwe do on the membership side is deeper\nlectures kind of like what we're doing\ntoday um and then the other cool thing\nis that members get to choose so we can\nlike build we can level up so we can do\nlike part one part two part three um so\nwe did like an emotions 101 lecture that\na lot of people really loved we did a\nlot of stuff on like vasana and Kisha\nsome of these like yogic Concepts that\nare more advanced so we can get to more\nadvanced stuff because everything that\nwe do in general is like we find that\nthe more advanced we go the more people\nwe leave behind because a lot of new\npeople are joining we've we've grown a\nlot over the last year this is great\nthis is all good news but then we're\nfaced with this tension between for a\nlot of new people how do we make things\naccessible to everyone versus how do we\nget to the advanced stuff so huge thank\nyou to everyone who signed up for\nmemberships um the other cool thing is\nthat uh we've used the funding from\nmemberships to build additional things\num and so thank you all very much for\nthat and I just wanted to show you all\nreal quick so a lot of people ask us for\ncitations so we build videos in a\nslightly different way we don't just uh\nhave citations for every video we have\nlike topics um so what we've done is\nlike so practically what I do just to\nshow you all an example of today\nso for today you know the the papers\nthat I'm going to be leaning into are\ngoing to be like some of these so I'll\nshow you all\nthis um and then so we've got you know\nthis paper we have this paper so\ndissociation alterations and brain\nfunction and structure implications for\nBPD dissociation in Neuroscience history\nand perspectives neurobiology of\ndissociation unity and disunity in the\nMind Body brain so these are like our\nfour major uh papers that we're going to\nbe examining today but just because we\nhave four papers that we're examining\ntoday there's actually like 30 or 40\nadditional 100 actually technically\npapers that are going into today's\nlecture that are not the core citations\nfor today but they're like all the other\nstuff that we read so what we've done is\nput together a general Works sited page\nthat will grow over time and we'll add\nto it so if you guys and so this is not\nlike the bibliography for a particular\nlecture what we've done is when we were\nsort of thinking about the the the work\ncited page it's not like the\nbibliography for a lecture because I I\ndon't know if you all have seen like you\nknow bibliographies for like academic\npapers but this is not accessible like\nthis is like what is like where is the\nactual like\nthis this this this this is like there's\nsix pages of this [Â __Â ] right so it it\njust gets overwhelming so since we're\nnot this is the purpose of this is not\nAC Academia right the purpose of this is\nlike educational so what we've tried to\ndo is select the papers that are the\nmost relevant have the best sources of\ninformation we've dug through a lot and\nthat's where our work cited page is um\nso that's up and we'll continue to add\nto it and often times when people are\nasking for citations like this community\nis so awesome it's because you guys want\nto read stuff so instead of like you\nknow uh\ndocumenting each statement that we make\nbecause that's not the goal of this I\nmean when we you know submit a\nmanuscript for publication that's what\nwe do there because that's what you need\nto do there but for here these are kind\nof high value papers that if youall want\nto read more we consider to be like\nreally really really good okay um so\nthank you all so much uh a couple of\nother things so our trauma guide is now\nuh released so we're super happy about\nthis it's something that we've been\nworking on for about two years\nwe're it's finally up um so we're going\nto be a a lot of the resources in the\ntrauma guide will relate to things that\nwe're talking about today but as always\nwe try to make um you know our our\nlectures on stream and stuff to be like\nself-sufficient so you don't need to get\nthe trauma guide or anything like that I\nwould say that you know this is going to\nbe like a start to finish thing that\nincludes what is dissociation how do we\nunderstand it and what you can do about\nit and then if yall are interested in\nadditional resources or more of a\nframework or a deeper dive into a\nparticular uh topic that we're talking\nabout today definitely check out the\ntrauma guide built with a lot of love\nand then I think we're going to have um\nuh one of our devs actually join us in\nmaybe about an hour and a half and talk\na little bit about like what we built um\nbecause I think it's pretty cool uh yeah\nso sound good\nchat\num we good\nokay\nso can we get started we okay talk teach\nthings enough blah\nblah\nokay now I need to get mentally\nprepared this is going to go here this\nis going to go\nhere I'm going to set up my battle\nstation chat\nbattle station\ntime\nOkay\nno\nOkay main screen turn\non all\nright now we begin the lecture on\ndissociation okay so today we're going\nto talk about dissociation\ndepersonalization some degree of\nclinical stuff okay so a lot of people\nin our community will ask us about\ndissociation and\ndepersonalization and these Concepts\nhave been generally considered to be a\npart of Psychiatry and specifically\ntrauma Related Disorders so there\ndoesn't seem to be a dedicated video to\ndissociation and derealization there's\none video on the clips channel from a\nmisus interview I've been getting\ntreated for ADHD it it's 247 a feeling\nlike I'm living in a memory or dream but\nmaybe not that it's hard to describe so\nwe haven't done a dedicated video on it\nthis post by the the way was one year\nago so just a quick reminder that you\nknow when youall post stuff like we pay\nattention the problem is that like\nbuilding this video you know took 10 12\n14 arguably 100 hours really about eight\nlet's say plus a lot of back research\nyou know that kind of went into it so\ntoday we're going to be talking about\ndissociation\nderealization and like I mentioned\nearlier one of the reasons that we have\nsteered away from this topic some so\nwe've steered away from this topic for a\ncouple of reasons the first is that\nthese disorders so dissociative identity\ndisorder D- realization disorder even\nPTSD subtype dissociative subtype\nborderline personality disorder we've\ntalked about a lot of these things by\nthemselves so we talk a lot about\ncomplex trauma trauma we have a guide to\ntrauma but the specific aspect of\ndissociation we thought or I thought was\nexceedingly rare So if you look at\nthings like dissociative identity\ndisorder it is probably one out of a\n10,000 or one out of a thousand people\nhabit somewhere in that ballpark so I\nhad one teacher at the Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital in the Harvard Medical\nSchool who is an absolute Chad and I\nasked them one day what do you think\nabout this whole multiple personality\nbusiness and he said that I think about\nmultiple personalities the way that I\nthink about aliens and I was like what\ndoes that mean and he said well I'm sure\nthat technically it exists but I don't\nbelieve anyone who says they've seen it\nright so this is kind of like the where\nI trained this was sort of the attitude\ntowards um dissociative identity\ndisorder that was at MGH mlan is a\ndifferent story um so you know this is\nsomething that gets like glorified in\nthe media a lot where you have this like\nsplit personality person who's like an\nevil killer on one one moment and then\nthey snap and then their facial\nexpression changes and their tone\nchanges and now they're talking like\nthis like hey man like I know you think\nI'm Dr K but really I'm a surfer\nbro right like this is this is what our\nportrayals in the media are so this is\nsomething that is generally speaking in\nPsychiatry exceedingly\nrare that being said what we're seeing\nis that it is becoming more common so\nwhat we're seeing is that you know\ndissociation related to trauma is more\ncommon BPD is a little bit more common\nso as I kind of dug into this I started\nto realize like okay this is not quite\nas rare the second thing is that\nunderstanding of dissociation and\ndepersonalization is very difficult and\nthe reason is because it isn't focal so\nif we look at depersonalization and\ndissociation what are they so we'll give\nyou kind of a quick example of this okay\nso what is so this is from a paper\ndissociation and alterations and brain\nfunction and structure implication for\nborderline personality disorder\nabsolutely great paper one of the main\npapers that we're going to be\nreferencing today so dissociation is a\ncomplex heterogenous phenomenon this\nmeans that it is hard to study and hard\nto Define right so it's complex it's not\njust one thing heterogenous means that\nthere's lots of different variance of it\nit has been defined as a disruption of\nAndor discontinuity\ndiscontinuity in the normal subjective\nintegration of one or more aspects of\npsychological functioning including but\nnot limited to memory identity\nConsciousness perception and motor\ncontrol okay so this is part of what\nmakes a studying dissociation and\ndepersonalization and talking about it\ndifficult because it is not first of all\nit's complex so it is not one thing so\nwhen we look at something like I don't\nknow let's say like what's a good\nexample like let's say a phobia so if I\nhave a phobia of snakes it is focal\nright it it is like one particular thing\nit's not like a lot of different\nvarieties of it it involves like one\nGeneral Circuit of the brain that\nbecomes hyperactive if we look at\nsomething like mood disorder it's kind\nof like okay if you've got a major\ndepressive disorder like you're\ndepressed right there are a couple of\ndifferent variants but it tends to be\nfocal tends to be pretty common so we\ncan kind of study it you have negative\nself attitude you have difficulty with\nsleeping you've got some neurovative\nsymptoms and it's like relatively\nspeaking\nsimpler I'm sure that depression experts\nand even I can make an argument against\nthat\nokay but if we look at like dissociation\nand depersonalization the reason that\nit's hard to study is because you have a\nsense of\nself your sense of self interacts with\nthe outside\nworld when there is a problem in this\nrelationship between self and the\noutside world or self and self this is\nwhat results in dissociation or\ndepersonalization and then the question\nbecomes what is the\nself well then that comes really\ncomplicated because the self is not one\nthing it is an integration of\nperceptions beliefs interceptive\nexperiences right it's all of this stuff\nthat we kind of saw over\nhere including but not limited to memory\nidentity Consciousness perception and\nmotor control and then what happens is\nwe're like okay so like where does the\nself exist in the brain this is where\nthe self exists in the brain this is why\ndissociation is hard to understand\nbecause it involves prefrontal cortical\nstructures your anterior singulate\ninferior frontal gyrus fusiform gyrus\ninsula amydala posterior singulate and\nthe prunus superior temporal gyus social\ncognition memory hippocampus and\nThalamus and then there's all these\nconnections but these are just all the\nparts that involved and then what\nhappens is you have connections between\nthese parts and so what happen the\nreason that dissociation and\ndepersonalization is hard to\nscientifically\nunderstand right and even this like even\nin this [Â __Â ] paper that this is\ncomplicated and by the way we're going\nto understand this okay we're going to\nunderstand this today a schematic\noverview of brain regions and functions\namong others so even the authors of this\npaper that have put together this thing\nare like this is not all of\nit right the precise neurobiological\nunderpinings of dissociation remain\nelusive so this is why basically this\ncrap is\ncomplicated but that is\nokay because we are going to figure it\nout today so what we've done today is\nwe're going to sit down we're going to\nunderstand this from kind of the ground\nup we're going to understand what\ndissociation is what depersonalization\nis we're going to tackle some of these\nNeuroscience regions we're going to talk\nsome about clinical stuff but the reason\nthat I think that this lecture is the\nmost important today is because\ndissociation is no longer something that\none to one out of a thousand to one out\nof 10,000 people deal with it is now\nbecoming exceedingly common and a lot of\nthe common problems that I see amongst\nthe youngsters today I think have some\nroot in\ndissociation so what we see is a lack of\ngold directed\nBehavior what we see is a lack of\nmotivation what we see is I don't know\nwho I am\nanymore right I I'm confused is this a\npart of me or is this\nsome psychological trauma that I need to\novercome who am I and what are the parts\nof me that need to be healed am I lazy\nor is this is something I need to\nfix so we don't know what we want\nanymore we don't know how to get\nourselves to direct towards something we\ndon't even know who we are anymore and\nthe question is why is this becoming\nmore common what's going on will it\nturns\nout attachment disorganization and\ndissociation in Virtual Worlds a study\non problematic internet use among\nplayers of online role playing games\nwhat the [Â __Â ] dude so there was a High\nprevalence of attachment disorganization\n47% among these players they also\nreported significant dissociative\nexperiences okay and this is 13.5% of\nthe people that they studied here so\nfrom 1 out of 10,000 we're now going to\n13 out of 100 or greater than one out of\n10 now this is just one particular study\nand what we find here\num did I lose this\nGG hold on so let's kind of jump\nstraight to\nthis give me a second\nchat all right so look so here's a great\nfigure that kind of amplifi exemplifies\nwhat's going on here so we have\nchildhood experience of loss neglect and\nabuse unresolved states of Mind\nregarding attachment and dissociation\nabsorption to the internet to protect\nthe self from traumatic memories and\nproblematic internet use\nso I want you all to think about this\nfor a second okay we're going to get\ninto more\ndetail but what we're seeing right now\nis that when we have a fragmented sense\nof self and this is the key thing in\ndissociation what happens is that the\ninternet serves as a enhancement of that\nfragmentation so what is dissociation\ndissociation or depersonalization is we\nhave this sense of self that is a\ncombination of interception the way that\nI feel about myself with memory with\nfeeling of emotions with even things\nlike analgesia the feeling of pain or\nsuppressing pain we have all of these\ndifferent Sensations that we put\ntogether and this is who I am it is a\ncombination of thoughts memories\nemotions identity physical sensation\nsensory\ninputs and then once this becomes\nfragmented which is the basic issue in\ndissociation now a part of myself can\naccess the internet and this is\nliterally what the internet does right\nand there's a in this paper like just to\ngive you all an example of like how deep\nthis goes um so let's let's take a quick\nlook at this and this is not the order\nthat I wanted to do this in but here we\nare so hence while it can be normal for\na person to use the internet in order to\ntemporarily shelter the self from\nunpleasant feelings it is possible that\nsome of the participants recruited for\nthe second phase of the study have found\na way to manage their disorganized\nstates of Mind through the misuse of\nvirtual worlds in a total immersion in\nthe alternative\nreality okay this is crazy\ndude so where is this thing about healer\nI think this is here yeah okay so\nanother example is about a young woman\nwho has been sexually abused in her\nAdolescence in the game she is a magic\nhealer who is able to restore health and\ngive stronger powers to herself and her\nfriends during the most difficult P\nbattles within a psychodynamic\nperspective it is possible to connect\nher use of magical powers in the game to\nthe desire of a magical repair for the\nwounded parts of herself like [Â __Â ]\nwild right so hey quick trivia question\nwhat what position do you guys think Dr\nK tends to play when I'm on the internet\nwhen I'm playing video games I play a\nsupport position I play healers\nsurprising huh is it shocking that I\ndon't I don't really grab gra itate\ntoward FPS I gravitate towards co-op\ngames and healers and things like that\nthere even studies that show that there\nare personality correlations between\nyour personality type and what you play\nin a video game okay so and this is\ncrazy like we all know this right these\npapers are about us so today's lecture\nis not for the one int is\nalso for the one in 10,000 people who\nhas dissociation or depersonalization\nbut as we're going to see today today\nthis is a huge part of this generation\nof people because the internet allows us\nto the internet gives us such a powerful\ntool to enhance our dissociation or\ndepersonalization we can literally\ncreate a virtual identity and then\nintegrating this across into the real\nworld is a problem and we see this so\ndeeply in our community why is it that I\ncan grind in a video game and I can\nspend 10,000 hours trying to go for this\n[Â __Â ] but I can't do something in my real\nlife this is a problem of dissociation\nor depersonalization and that's why this\nlecture is important today okay enough\nof a\npreamble\nso let us begin\nokay so the first thing is let's define\noh what dissociation\nis okay\nso dissociation\nand\ndepersonalization okay and the way that\nwe're going to do this today is we're\ngoing to understand what dissociation\ndepersonalization is we're going to\nunderstand it from a neuroscience\nperspective we're going to talk a little\nbit about clinical perspectives not too\nmuch and then we're going to talk about\ngaming the virtual world and all this\nstuff and then we're going to talk about\nwhat to do okay so part one\nNeuroscience part two clinical stuff\npart part three gaming virtual\nworld and part four what do\nokay so remember that when we're looking\nat De dissociation and depersonalization\nwe have a sense of self and the sense of\nself is an\nintegration\nof memory\nidentity\nConsciousness okay so what do we mean by\nConsciousness so Consciousness is like\nyour state of\nawareness so when I'm unconscious I'm\ncompletely unaware when I'm in a normal\nwaking state I'm aware of my\nsurroundings but what we see in\ndissociation and depersonalization is\nthat there are alterations in\nConsciousness so are you here right now\nwhen you're personalized you're like\nthere's something here but I am not here\nright so we start to see all these weird\nvariants in Consciousness and this is\nwhat's beautiful is like we've\ngot memes right are you okay you didn't\ntalk to me at school me at school like\nthis is you're inside you you're not\nactually living your life you're like\ninside observing your life this is a\ndisturbance of\nConsciousness okay then we also have\nproblems with\nperception and we have changes in motor\ncontrol but this isn't\nit okay what we also see with\ndissociation and depersonalization I'm\ngoing to get rid of this now okay chat\nbecause I need this space on the right I\nneed it we also see\nanalgesia okay so analgesia is pain\nnumbing we also see\nAlexia or emotional\nnumbness okay so this is this is what\nhappens in dissociation is that we see\nall these different dimensions get\naffected now the other big thing is that\nover here we have a disturbance of the\nself but there is another feature of\ndissociation and depersonalization which\nis equally important which is intrusions\nso over here we're\nfractured and then the other thing that\ntends to happen is we have these this\nintrusions of overwhelming\nemotion right so at times we feel numb\nand at times we feel way too much we\nhave intrusive\nmemories we'll even have things like\ndaydreaming which I want to show you all\nreal quick\nokay it doesn't say it over here but the\nposterior singulate is involved in\nthings like daydreaming\nokay so like this is where like I am\ntrying to live my life I'm trying to be\nme but these weird Daydreams keep on\ncoming in and I start fantasizing about\nall this kind of stuff so if you look at\ndissociation this very important to\nunderstand it is not just an unplugging\nit is also an\nintrusion these things come hand in hand\nokay and now let's understand why here's\nthe basics of what happens when we\ndissociate so here is the\nself and if we look at the self it is a\ncombination of different things so this\nis identity so this is things like uh\ninterception so my ability to detect\nwhat's in here so when I ask you how do\nyou feel right now you look inside\nyourself okay then we also have sensory\ninputs this is from things like the\nthalamus oh\nJesus okay and then we have\nmemories and then we've got uh I don't\nknow like uh\nemotions okay so we have all these\ndifferent parts of the self right we\nhave perceptions we kind of said that's\nover here some sensory input we covered\nthat then we have motor\ninputs um we have you know pain so\nhere's what happens in dissociation so\nthis is a normal healthy self you are\nintegrated all of these things are\ncoming together right and they make your\nexperience of life and in order to feel\nlike yourself you need all of these\nthings\ntogether so what happens in dissociation\nwhat we\nsee is a fracturing of this\nstuff so now what happens is you become\na\npiece and one piece gets separated from\nthe others so what we do is we take this\nI hope this will work can you do it\nno\n[Music]\nfail how do I make my Eraser smaller I\ndon't know okay GG\nI will cut that I will cut that I cut\nthat I will cut\nthat and then I will cut this so maybe\nit'll work now so now we're going to\ngo\nhere and what I'm going to do this is\nwhat happens in dissociation my motions\nget\ngone and\nthen my\npain gets gone so now I'm going to\nconnect these two things\nnow what I've done is I've taken myself\nmy experience of life and I've divided\nit into two\nthings okay so now there's a part of me\nthat has some memories has some sense of\nidentity has some sensory input has some\nmotor input this is great I'm going\nalong I'm playing some video games I'm\ngoing to my job everything's chilling we\nvibing we good there's no pain there's\nno negative emotion there's kind of some\nnumbness right so we kind of get to this\npicture uh where is\nit this right this is what we\nare for dissociators pros feel nothing\ncons feel nothing so this is what ends\nup happening to me and then what happens\nis this [Â __Â ] is still going on it is\njust suppressed in the\nbrain and then what happens is this\nintrudes so we see this\nintrusion so this is is important to\nunderstand\nokay if you look at studies of\ndissociation what you'll find is that\npeople who dissociate and say they don't\nfeel anything will still have\nelevated physiologic responses their\ngalvanic skin response is uh indicates\nstress you'll see you ask them how do\nyou feel and they'll say I feel numb but\ntheir heart rate is like 120 their blood\npressure is elevating they're\ndiaphoretic their pupils are dilating\ntheir body is in a high stress state so\nthis is also really interesting so you\nknow people who have avoidant\nattachment so people who are avoiding\nattachment have avoided attachment are\nscared of emotional connection to other\npeople and when they want someone to\ntext them back and someone doesn't text\nthem back they say they're fine with it\nthey're like I don't feel anything but\nif you measure their physiology their\nphysiology is\nstressed so when you look at kids who\nhave avoided attachment there's this\nfamous study called The Strange\nsituation where a kid is in a room with\ntheir mom or dad I think usually mom and\nthen they're kind of like they have this\navoid and attachment so they're not a\nbig fan of mom so they're just playing\nwith some toys Mom leaves a stranger\ncomes in When a Stranger comes in and\nthen Mom comes in and then the stranger\nleaves the kid is acting very chill the\nwhole time they're acting\nchill but inside their physiology is\ngoing hey why\nso what we see in dissociation is that\neverything that the situation is\ndemanding can be going on we just\nsegregate ourselves into\npieces and this is why we see intrusive\nuh features to all of these diagnosis so\nlet's understand this okay this is\nreally important to understand so even\nthough I feel numb right now later on I\nwill feel in a very very weird way I'll\nfeel this very powerful intrusion or\nI'll feel triggered so I get a\ndisproportionate physiologic and\nemotional response to a benign stimulus\nand the question is why it's because our\nbrain has segregated the stuff and\nwalled it off okay so let's take a quick\nlook at a paper that really explains\nthis\nuh okay wrong one\nokay um\nso the traumatic situation may be\nperceived as an unreal film scene that\nis not happening to oneself but observed\nfrom a wider difference a wider distance\nseaform symptoms such as analgesia and\noutof body experiences May reduce\nawareness of physical injury right so\nthis is what it starts to feel like okay\nthis is what we feel like where we're\nnot like actually living this life we're\nseparated from the life um\nso okay so now this is important the\nperitraumatic associ dissociation\nincreases the subsequent risk of PTSD\nalthough the price precise mechanisms\nremain elusive Disturbed information\nprocessing mostly prominently memory\nalterations may play an important role\nin this relationship dissociate uh\nleading to the fragmentation or\ncompartmentalization of memory sensory\naffective and cognitive aspects of the\ntraumatic event are encoded and stored\nas separate Elements which may later\nreoccur as implicit intrusive flashback\nmemories accompanied by strong sensory\nimpressions as if the traumatic event\nwas happening in again in the present\nokay so this is kind of what we're\ntalking about is if we look at this what\nthe Mind does is it fragments our our\nbrain fragments our sense of self and\nTucks some of it away for for later and\nthen the reason that this is like a\ndebilitating thing for most people is\nbecause then later what happens is this\nstuff that has been stored away then\nacts as an intrusive memory so a minor\ntrigger opens up this compartment of\ncrap that has not been properly\nintegrated and then we feel overwhelmed\nokay and this creates these really weird\nexperiences right so like we start to\nhave stuff like this\nlike you're in the middle of a\nconversation babe it's time for your\nstatic right it's time for your here you\nare trying to participate in\nlife but then your brain is\nlike you're like\n[Â __Â ] and now you're like okay like how\nam I supposed to participate in a\nrelationship I'm on a date I was having\na good time but now like this\nand then I can't I can't like do what\nI'm supposed to be doing right now okay\nthat's what happens so this is like the\nneuroscientific mechanisms of this we\nhave an overwhelming experience and so\nnow we're going to talk about that we\nfragment out and the moment we fragment\nwe open the door to intrusion we open\nthe door to minor triggers creating\noverwhelming emotional\nresponses we open the the door to this\nwe open the door to overwhelming\nemotions we open the door to flashbacks\nwe even open the door to\ndaydreaming so now let's understand why\nthe hell does this\nhappen so\ncool why does this happen so if you look\nat studies of animal models what we find\nis that this\nmechanism is a protective mechanism so\nthis is the way it kind of works so we\nknow that animals have the capacity to\nplay dead and remember that analgesia or\npain the inability to feel pain it is is\nan important part of dissociation so\nmaybe I think I have this reference\nsomewhere in there I'll I'll look\nthrough these tabs in a second but\nbasically what we know is that when we\ngo through overwhelming\npain our body and our brain have a\nmechanism to protect us and this goes\nWay Beyond humans so an animal will play\ndead and if we look at what happens in\nin an animal that's playing dead\nsee we normally think of inactivity as\npart of our parasympathetic nervous\nsystem this is rest and digest I'm\nsleeping therefore I am chilling right I\nhave to be very relaxed to go to sleep\nbut we can have a severe amount of\ninactivity not as a form of extreme\nrelaxation but as a form of extreme\nstress so if we look at an organism\nthere's the rest side right I'm chilling\nI'm vibing I'm relaxing I'm resting I\nfeel relaxed I can close my eyes I can\ngo to sleep I'm inactive then we enter\nthe stress realm so it's fight or flight\nand even Beyond fight or flight is\nfreeze so an animal will play dead when\nit can no longer run and it can no\nlonger fight it freezes it plays dead\nand when it freezes we see this\ncompartmentalization in the brain so the\nanimal develops analgesia it no longer\nfeels physical pain which is like when a\npredator what what they'll do is they'll\nlike bite the animal they're like let me\nsee if I can bite you and then see if\nyou're still alive okay and why animals\nplay dead there's we we're not 100% sure\nbut there's some evidence that suggests\nthat predators are wary unless they're\ncarry and eaters predators are wary of\ndead animals because dead animals can\nmake them sick so that's why it's kind\nof weird right why won't a predator just\neat something that's dead it's because\nthere's some evolutionary advantage and\nthat's why these animals have learned to\nplay Deb because things that are rotting\nand are full of bacteria will make\nanimals sick and therefore animals will\nstay away from things that they think\nare already dead I'm happy to kill you\nbut I don't want you if you're already\ndead that's the way a predator\nthinks so in this freeze response what\nwe literally have to do this is not at\nthe level of like conscious suppression\nthis is important to understand because\nlike mice will do this this is at a\nneurological\nlevel where the animal the intense level\nof fear induces a dissociative state\ninduces analgesia to pain induces and if\nyou kind of think about this we don't\nreally know this right because we\nhaven't studied the consciousness of\nmice but I imagine you can look at an\nanimal that's playing dead and they're\nlike in some weird\nZone where they're not like really\npresent and the same thing happens with\nhuman\nbeings so when we enter a extremely\nstressful State and what we also know is\nthat dissociation and\ndepersonalization are often times\nassociated with severe\ntrauma so basically what the brain does\nour brain has this protective mechanism\nwhere if the pain is too\nmuch we're going to unplug from our\ninternal experience of this and so\nBessel Vander kulk did a lot of cool\nwork on this where he sort of like\nnoticed that the activity across the\nCorpus colossum the brain stops talking\nto itself because normally the brain is\nall connected with itself it's like\nwe're going to talk over here we're\ngoing to talk over there we're going to\ntalk over there we're going to talk over\nthere and what we tend to find in in\ndissociation is that the way that the\nbrain talks to itself changes and it's\nnot just that it entirely talks to\nitself less there are some parts will\nthat'll talk to each other more so the\nparts of our brain that will numb out\nsend numbing signals to other parts of\nthe brain those will become hyperactive\nwe'll show those in a\nminute okay so dissociation is basically\na compensation for when things are\noverwhelming we're just going to unplug\nthat's what dissociation\nis the problem is that the moment that\nwe unplug we compartmentalize and then\nthat activity spills over\nlater the other problem that we tend to\nsee is that once we start fragmenting\nour sense of self our ability to move in\nthe world becomes\nproblematic because the way that we move\nin the world involves an integrated\nsense of self right so like if we look\nat like the way that our world is\ndesigned the human\nbrain didn't evolve all these pieces to\nnot use 30% of it when we're trying to\nsucceed success in the world requires\nlike all parts of your\nbrain and we made some levels of you\nknow compensation when someone is\nmissing a part of their body if someone\nis\nblind the Human Society has built\ncompensations to to uh balance that\nhandicap if someone is missing their\nlegs we've built compensations the\nproblem is that from a neurologic\nperspective we haven't built these\ncompensations in our world yet maybe uh\nyou know accommodations for things like\nADHD is the closest that we\nget but our society presumes that you\nhave an integrated brain so let's talk\nabout a couple of examples of this so if\nI have if I want to live a normal happy\nlife what do I need I need all parts of\nmy brain I need to be able to detect\nwhat's going on around me I need access\nto my memories right I need to be able\nto form new memories in order to be\nsuccessful in my job I need to have\nmotivation and motivation comes from an\nintegration of identity and emotion and\nsome amount of frontal lobe\nstuff now if I'm numbing myself out like\nthis is what we see right so the going\nback to this\nmeme so this is the problem Pros feel\nnothing cons feel nothing and when you\nfeel nothing you can't motivate yourself\nbecause if we look at what are our most\npowerful motivators our most powerful\nmotivators are not logic our most\npowerful motivators are\nemotion and so Judith Herman noticed\nthis in her original paper on PTSD that\npeople with a history of trauma have\nsomething called a paralysis of\ninitiation they are not\nself-starters and why are they not\nself-starters because they have lived in\na world will where self- starting\ndoesn't work they've lived in a world\nwhere their goal is not accomplishment\ntheir goal is\nsurvival and when your goal is survival\nyou build an organism that is\nreactive right so like I want youall to\nthink about you know let's say you're\nplaying a football or soccer match\npeople with a history of PTSD and\ncomplex PTSD there's like you're forward\nright their job is to go and win points\nand then there's the goalie the goalie's\njob is to protect against what comes\nin and the problem in trauma is that\nsome people are just goalies so if some\nattack happens to me I'm going to defend\nmyself but I don't know how to score\npoints the goalie job is just to sit in\nthis pen I'm not going to go out into\nthe world I'm not going to accomplish\nanything I'm just going to sit here and\nwait for [Â __Â ] to happen and all of my\ntraining has been designed to help me\nwait for [Â __Â ] to prepare for when [Â __Â ]\nhappens and these people people have\nsomething called a paralysis of\ninitiation they cannot go out and score\npoints in life so this creates the\nexperience of just existing and it feels\nlike you're just waiting for the next\nbad thing to happen and your dayto day\nis like can I survive the next storm can\nI survive the next storm can I survive\nthe next\nstorm and we look at this and we think\noh my God like then you look at other\npeople right and you think like I'm lazy\nyou're not lazy the way that you're or\norganism has been rewired is is to play\ndefense because somewhere early on you\nlearned that trying to play offense is a\nwaste of time Mommy Daddy can I have\nthis doll for Christmas no [Â __Â ] you\nyou've been a bad kid you don't get\nanything how dare you ask when you've\nbeen doing this and you've been doing\nthis and you've been doing this how dare\nyou have desires and the most sad\nversions of this that I've seen is when\nkids are good\nI've seen this it's so traumatic when\nthere's like you know someone who's like\na star athlete whose parent used to be a\nstar athlete but then they got pregnant\nand then they had you and then their\ndreams of going to the Olympics\ndisappeared when you were born and then\nthey blame you for it and so they want\nyou to go to the Olympics they want you\nto be the best but the better and better\nand better you become the more pissed at\nyou your parent gets so much toxicity in\nthe high levels of athletic\nperformance so we create these kinds of\nsituations where we don't know how to\nact because we are fragmented from\nourself we're constantly playing defense\nand as part of playing that defense we\ncompartmentalize but all that crap is\nstill there and then it explodes into\nour Consciousness when we don't want it\nit gets triggered and then even if we're\ntrying to live life we get overwhelmed\nso over here we don't have enough\nemotion we don't have enough motivation\nwe don't have even memories and then\nover here we get too many memories too\nmany inappropriate memories too much\ninappropriate emotion so this is the\nfundamental of dissociation let's go\ninto more\ndetail\nokay all right\nso um\nso individuals who learn to dissociate\nin response to traumatic stressful\nsituations may be more likely to do so\nin the presence of even relatively minor\nstressors so we already talked about\nthis right so this is like where what\nhappens is we have this pile of stuff\nthat is sitting\nhere and then this will intrude based on\na tiny\ntrigger so here I am living my\nrelatively\nnumb\nordinary\nBlas life\nand then I'm going to have a tiny\ntrigger that triggers all of this\nintrusive thinking okay maybe I misspell\nplaz\nso now let's talk about brain this is\ncool okay so increased recruitment of\nthe PFC May Bo May both directly and\nindirectly via the anterior singlet\ncortex this is prefrontal cortex lead to\ndampened activity in the amydala and a\nmarket attenuation of automatic\nresponses comparable to shutting down\nthe affective system so what does this\nmean so we basically already talked\nabout this but now we're going to\nunderstand the mechanism so when I say\nemotions so we have our\nPFC we have our ACC and then we have our\namydala\nand liic\nsystem okay so what tends to happen is\nthat this thing suppresses our igdal in\nour lyic system this is where we feel\nnegative\nemotions so in cases of dissociation we\nhave a very strong connection of\nsuppressing our emotional circuitry the\nstronger this becomes the more\nfragmented we become\nokay second thing the insula plays an\nimportant role in attention modulation\nen encoding of negative emotions\ninterceptive awareness and pain\nperception diminished activity in this\nair area May therefore reflect reduced\ninter interoceptive or emotional\nawareness so we also see in trauma or\ndissociation we have the\nPFC we have the insula and the insula is\nthe part of our brain that deals with\ninteroceptive\nawareness so what is interceptive\nawareness interceptive awareness is like\nthe ability to know where you are so\nyou're like I'm in myself I am myself\nI'm in my body like this\nis I am once again wondering if I even\nexist right so this is like a lack of\ninceptive awareness so how do you know\nyou exist like this is kind of weird\nright so let's like talk about this for\na second it's so weird so how do you\nknow you\nexist like let's understand this like\nlike forget about Spirit or Soul or any\nof that CRA crap let's be\nscientific so how do we know that we see\nwe know that we see because we have\nphoto receptors in the eye our photo\nreceptors then transmute stuff from our\nretina through the O uh optic nerve all\nthe way back to our occipital cortex\nwhich is in the back and then the\noccipital cortex does some stuff and\nthen ah we\nsee how do we know that we exist there's\na part of the brain that tells you you\nexist that's how you know this part of\nthe brain is the insula problematic in\npeople who have dissociation absolutely\nswollen in people who meditate a lot lot\nof insular changes in\nmeditation so our the part of our brain\nthat literally tells us that we exist\nbecomes compromised in some way when we\nare traumatized now the really\ninteresting thing uh where is our\nsalience okay we're going to talk about\nsalience in a\nsecond is that the insula is what's\nfascinating the part of our brain that\ntells us that we exist also tells us\nwhen we feel pain and when we have\nnegative emotion and think about this\nfor a second why would these be the same\npart of the brain isn't like the sense\nof self in pain like different things no\nwhen you are in pain who's in pain I am\nin pain when you are hurting when you\nfeel ashamed you can't feel shame\nwithout a sense of I\nnow this is very important to understand\nbecause a lot of the insula is related\nto we have two classes of\nemotions we have our primitive emotions\nwhich come from the amygdala and then we\nhave our social emotions which come from\nsomewhere\nelse let's say the insula is connected\nto it so an\nalligator or an alligator can feel fear\nand anger because it's amigdala intact\nan allig doesn't feel guilt at least not\nthat we're aware of does that make sense\nthere's some emotions that happen can\nhappen independently and some emotions\nthat require a social structure to feel\nso I can be stuck on a desert island and\nI can feel anger and I can feel fear but\nif I'm stuck on a desert island and\nthere's no human beings I can't feel\nshame there's not who's looking at me I\ncan to be running around I can be\noverweight I can have my junk hanging\nout and I'm going to be vibing like I\ndon't give a [Â __Â ] cuz there's no one\nelse to judge\nme and then if we sort of stop and think\nabout it what is the what are these\nnegative emotions shame and guilt shame\nand guilt cannot exist without a sense\nof\nself is that make\nsense I don't need to know who I am to\nfeel\nfear like if a [Â __Â ] giant python is\nchasing me I don't need like it doesn't\nmatter that I'm a doctor a dad or a man\nor a gamer or good gamer god tier gamer\n[Â __Â ] gamer none of that matters when\nthere's a giant python chasing me but in\norder to feel shame and guilt I need a\nsense of\nself so that comes from the insula and\nthis is also why if we look at like\nborderline personality disorder what are\nthe emotions that they feel the most\nintensely there's intense shame these\naffective emotions these relational\nemotions become very very intensified\nand BPD is associated with\ndissociation okay so it isn't just and\nthen pain is involved too so this is\nwhere like things get kind of like it's\nnot black or white so what we tend to\nsee is that dissociation is overwhelming\nnegative emotions sometimes it is fear\nsometimes it is anger that can be\ntriggered by it for sure right because\nwe looked at the PFC and the amydala so\nthat's a connection between suppressing\nour primitive emotions but there's also\nthis other layer at the level of insulin\nthese are two independent\ncircuits this is also why dissociation\nand depersonalization are\nheterogeneous experiences they're not\nall one way and your dissociation and\nsomeone else's dissociation may be\ndifferent I've seen cases where people\nare very primitive uh emotion focused\nand PE uh and people who are very like\naffective or relational emotional\nfocused these are different and even if\nwe look at this concept of dissociation\nand depers ation these are not the same\nthings to be dissociated is you being\ndisconnected from what is outside of you\nde personalization is being disconnected\nfrom yourself so am I disconnected from\nthe outside world like all this stuff is\nhappening around me and I'm kind of\nfloating around and here I am or I don't\neven feel like\nme right and there's probably like\nthere's interesting cases of this part\nof feeling yourself being screwed up in\nother ways there's this really\nfascinating condition called the cotard\ndelusion and the card delusion is\ncharacterized by someone feeling like a\npart of their body is dead rotting or\ndying and it's like if you stop and\nthink about that like what's going on in\ntheir brain so when you talk to someone\nwho has a card delusion they'll be\nlike a part of me is dead I have like a\ndead part inside of me my liver has died\nthere's a rotting liver inside of\nme and you'll be like what what does\nthat mean like no like your liver\nfunction tests are fine the ultrasound\nlooks good like we did you\nknow we looked at like your arterial\ncirculation and liver looks fine they're\nlike no it's dying something's wrong and\nif you kind of think about that what is\nhappening in their brain there is a part\nof your brain that tells you that you\nare alive and vital that part of the\nbrain gets messed up that's what the\ninsula may be related to I don't really\nknow the Neuroscience of the card\ndelusion I don't know if anyone's really\nfigured it out okay okay so the insula\nis\nimpaired the next thing that we're going\nto talk\nabout I'm going to actually pause for a\nsecond so I need to know from y'all is\nthis too complicated or does this make\nsense because I was like really\nstruggling to figure out how much\nNeuroscience to include so I kind of\nneed to know is are yall following this\nor okay because this is like dense\nNeuroscience okay\nokay good okay so if I like leave yall\nbehind you yall need to let me know\nokay because this is I mean this is like\nsome complex stuff all\nright and then we'll we'll do Q&A\nlater okay cool I'm so thrilled that\ny'all are like able to follow this\nbecause you know this is this like this\nis dense like look at this sentence this\nis what the [Â __Â ] like we're going to\njust read this sentence okay the PCC is\na critical node of the default mode\nNetwork a brain Network that has been\nimplicated in inward directed\nself-referential processes such as\nepisodic memory encoding retrieval self\nmonitoring day ding planning rumination\nand pain processing\nokay\num\nso so like let's so I'll explain what\nthis means okay so then we also have\nthis part of our brain called the\nposterior singulate\ncortex so the PCC is is directed it is\nfocused on Inward and self-referential\nprocesses so further evidence of altered\nself-referential processing in\ndepersonalization disorder patients stem\nfrom an fmri study that's looking at\nblood flow in the brain in which DDD\ndepersonalization\ndisorder depersonalization D realization\ndisorder patients were exposed to either\ntheir own photographs or a stranger's\nface while viewing their own photographs\npatients showed stronger activity in\nareas implicated in self- refering\nprocessing which was positively\ncorrelated with depersonalization\nseverity okay so what does this mean so\nthere's this part of our brain called\nthe posterior singulate cortex and the\nposterior singulate cortex is involved\nin US recognizing us okay so I'm going\nto try to find\num so when we look at this image\nokay so when we look at\nthis\nokay this is are these the same person\nor is this one person so when your\nposterior singulate cortex is messed up\nyou think that these are two different\npeople so they've done studies okay\nwhere they'll have you like in that\nstudy like this is what they do in that\nstudy okay\nthey have you look at a picture of your\nface and they have you look at a picture\nof somebody else's face and then\nnormally when we see our\nface our brain is like hey look there's\nme but when we suffer from a\ndepersonalization disorder we look at\nour face and we don't\nsee ourselves we see a different person\nthis isn't us and I saw a hilarious um\nlike this is I'm gonna hold on a second\nI'm going to show you all this this Tik\nTok because I think this is really\ngreat right so this is like if you guys\nhave not seen this Tik Tok this is an\nexample of like this is how the insula\nforms I mean posterior singular cortex\nforms what we're going to see in real\ntime if yall have seen this this is\ngoing to be the insula forming\nokay it look so\npretty who looks so\npretty car look so pretty who looks so\npretty who looks so pretty Daddy what\ngirl dad girl on your\nphone you\nthat's you\nCharlie\ne that's the insula you think you're\nreally\npretty\nyeah that's it right like this is crazy\nlike you can see it in that moment like\nin this girl's\nface like she looks at this she doesn't\nunderstand right so this is like this\nhappens when we're young\nokay we we don't realize that we're us\nand then I I love it right it's very\nwholesome and cute and stuff like that\nand and but but this her brain doesn't\nunderstand and then in that moment she's\nlike hold on a second this is me\nwhat it it's beautiful you see the\nmoment that the posterior singulate\ncortex is like that's me oh whoa whoa\nwhoa hold on a second hold on a second\nhold on a second and if you are someone\nwho struggles with dissociation or\ndepersonalization you are early first 20\nseconds of Charlie you're not last 20\nseconds of Charlie and we have these\nstudies that show that when you look at\nyour own face you don't see\nyourself okay now here's the other\nreally interesting thing so when we look\nat the posterior singulate\ncortex there's a lot of self-referential\nprocessing that goes on in there but\nthere also other things so this the PCC\nis also part of the default mode Network\num we've talked a lot about the default\nmode Network like so we're not going to\ngo into too much detail but it's\nbasically our sense of self which is not\nlocalized to one part of the brain it's\nan integration of different\nthings and we know that the default mode\nNetwork when it becomes overactive we\nactually result in\ndepression so mood disord is usually\ninvolve in over involved overactive\ndefault mode Network so that may sound\nkind of weird but let's understand this\nright so in in a mood disorder\nI'm always beating myself up my family's\nbetter off without me it's my fault that\nthis went wrong it's my fault that this\nwent wrong when someone when my partner\nis abusing me it's my fault my fault me\nme me me me me me we see hyperactivity\nof the default mode Network in\ndepression this is the opposite in some\nways of dissociation or\ndepersonalization because in\ndepersonalization even when it's you\nit's not\nyou so this is what's really interesting\nso let me ask youall something thing\nokay if dissociation is on one end of\nthe spectrum and has a let's say\nhypoactive default mode Network and\nmajor depression is on the other end of\nthe spectrum and it has a\nhyperactive default mode Network what is\nsomething that we can do to treat\nsomeone's\ndepression can youall guess right so\nover here\nright\nperfect make them\ndissociate absolutely we can make them\ndissociate and we do make them\ndissociate and Chatters and figured this\nout this is what ketamine\ndoes ketamine is a dissociative agent it\nwas originally used in\nanesthesia so once again let's think\nabout this because this is\nfascinating in dissociation we have\nanalgesia reduction of pain signals\nreduction of\nawareness so what do we do in an\nanesthesia we make people dissociate you\nwon't have\nmemories of the procedure you won't feel\npain your Consciousness is altered\nperfect it's going to be great we're\ngoing to induce dissociation and the\nfastest acting treatment for depression\nthat we have is\nketamine has its own set of problems\nand why it's because it induces\ndissociation here you are beating\nyourself up all the time I have a cool\nidea let's just depersonalize you for a\nlittle bit and people feel so much\nrelief the challenge with\nketamine is that sometimes people can\nget hooked to it because it's a drug of\nabuse so the problem when we we look at\ndepression and ketamine is that it works\nwhile it's floating around in your\nsystem and you're dissociating but when\nyou replug to yourself whatever was\nnegative in there may still be there in\nsome form so I you know I worked with\nsome clinicians who would say like oh\nyeah like I have patients who come in\nfor daily ketamine\ntreatments and then I'm like kind of\nwondering I'm like how long has this\nbeen going on they're like for\nyears and I'm like are you sure you're\njust not a drug dealer like this doesn't\nsound healthy to me maybe and you know I\njoke about it but that that's where like\nwhen I say may it it doesn't sound\nhealthy I'm not saying it isn't healthy\nbecause it's very possible that this\nperson's depression is so severe that\nthat is the only thing that\nworks right so there's like and usually\npeople who are you know the colleagues\nthat I'm talking to are actually experts\nin it so they're the ones that have the\nmost severe patients that's what's both\ngood and bad about training at a place\nlike MGH is it's this like world class\nhospital where like the most severe\ncases from all literally all over the\nworld will travel there and then they'll\nget treatment from these people and so\nmaybe in severe cases this is really\nwhat's\nnecessary okay um and one of the\ncontraindications for ketamine treatment\nis like dissociative episodes so this is\njust important to understand kind of\ngoing back to the point here is that we\nknow that dissociation and\ndepersonalization involve a separation\nof the self and when we have a\nhyperactive self we can dissociate them\na little bit as a treatment\nokay now\nthe next thing that we're going to talk\na little bit about\nis\num let's talk about over modulation and\nunder\nmodulation okay so once we're talking\nabout\nthe the depersonalization element once\nwe're entering the PCC in the insula\nterritory I am once again even wondering\nif I don't exist okay uh no I can't find\nit\nhold on\nchat give me a second there's one more\nthing I want to show\ny'all I hope I can find the reference I\nmean I can just explain it without\nshowing you the reference but I want to\nshow you the reference so bear with\nme ah here we go it's on page\nsix here we go\nokay oh it's right here okay cool so one\nother thing I want to show youall\nokay um based on our recent neuroimaging\nfindings in\nPTSD uh lenius and colleagues proposed a\na neurobiological model that\ndistinguishes between two types of\nresponses to traumatic reminders and\nother uh stressors so this is what's\nkind of confusing in people with PTSD or\nnot just PTSD just dissociative\ndisorders so remember that what we have\nis we have a unplugging from reality\nand we have an intrusion or or even an\nintrusion experience of not reality so\neither I'm unplugging from my emotions\nor my emotions are over plugging into me\nand what we find is that that pattern of\nlike you know oh now like I'm feeling\nanxious even though there's nothing\nwrong and at other times I should be\nfeeling anxious and I feel totally fine\nlike what the [Â __Â ] is going on so it\nturns out that we know that there's a\nneurobiological mechanism for that\nthing patients with a dissociative\nresponse sub type are thought to over\nmodulate their emotions as opposed to\npatients who primarily suffer from\nreexperiencing symptoms including\naffective hyperarousal intense feelings\nof Shame and guilt and difficulties in\nEmotion down\nregulation emotion over modulation that\nmeans we're toning emotions down\ndissociative response type is thought to\nprimarily activate blah blah blah blah\nblah the reverse pattern diminish\nfrontal recruitment ACC and mpfc and\nhyperactivity in the amydala and insula\nis a assume to underly emotion under\nmodulation okay so the main thing\nhere is\nthat we see both types so going back to\nthis diagram so remember we talked about\nthis where the\nPFC is suppressing our negative emotion\nso we tend to see in one model this\nconnection is really strong and in\nanother model this is not very strong\nand we get hypera ity of a\nmotion okay so both of these things\nexist so this is what's kind of\nconfusing this just goes back to the\nfragmentation when we're in this state\nwe have over\nmodulation I.E we're toning down the\nsignal way too much and when we're in\nthis state we have under\nmodulation so now the the negative\nemotional circuit tree of our brain is\ngoing haywire and remember that this to\nthis paper is talking about\nonce again like um I hope this is\nstarting to\nconnect so intense feelings of Shame and\nguilt right so this is the and and this\nis related this reverse pattern is\nrelated to the insula and what does the\ninsula\ndo is did I write it down did we do this\nokay okay we didn't write it down so\nwhat does the insula do the insula is\nself-referential right so we kind of see\nthat like hopefully stuff is like\nstarting to click\nwhere basically like we suppress\nemotions then we feel dissociated and\nthen we feel these intense feelings of\nShame and guilt and what do we see is\nhyperactive in our brain in those\nmoments What's hyperactive in our brain\nis our self-referential parts of the\nbrain which are kind of suppressed in\nother times so that's what's so\nconfusing about dissociation and\ndepersonalization unlike something like\na mood disorder where we just know it's\njust simple it's just\nhyperactivity okay\nwhat happens in in dissociation and\ndepersonalization is is we have a\nfracturing and separate thing of the\nbrain so instead of\nbalance we have over modulation or\nsuppression of emotions on one day and\nwe have hyperactivity of emotions on a\ndifferent day we also know that there\nare subtypes of people and\ndiseases so I'm saying on one day you're\nthis way on one day you're that way\nbecause there is suppression and\nintrusive thinking that's very common\nbut then we also know that amongst\ndifferent kinds of patients they have a\npreference for one or the other so some\npeople are much more likely so in BPD\nfor example and now we get to the\ndiagnosis okay so in BPD for example\nthese people are under\nmodulators so if you have a history of\ntrauma you can when you when you're a\ntiny little baby seed of trauma you can\nbloom into all kinds of different plants\nso one plant that you will become will\nbe a BPD plant and in a BPD plant we\nhave under modulation of our\nemotions at the same time even though we\nhave under modulation of our emotions so\nI feel intense shame I feel intense\nguilt what that that can then do is\ntrigger that freeze response in dis\nAssociation so this is what's really\nimportant to understand okay this is the\nsequence in\nBPD we have\nunder modulation Jesus I haven't even\ngotten\nhalfway of emotion so then I feel\nintense shame and\nguilt this\ntriggers freeze\nresponse and\ndissociation right and once I trigger\nthe freeze response in dissociation\nunder modulation of emotion this is\ninsula that is very active and what\nhappens when I\ndissociate insula activity goes down\nright so then we have the other\nversion over\nmodulation So This is highly active PFC\nor insula\nsuppression this results in numbness\nright so we can see that\ndissociation even on a neurobiological\nlevel is a\ncompensation for overwhelming\nemotion and so the dissociation that\nsomeone with BPD experiences is a\nproblem but it is a solution to a\ndifferent problem and we know that if\nyou have if you have BPD this is your\npicture if you have\nDDD depersonalization derealization\ndisorder this may be more of your\npicture and both of these are all\nrelated to\ntrauma okay now there's one last thing\nthat I want to talk about because this\nis just too important to pass\nup and I got to find the part once again\ngive me a second chat\n[Music]\nokay so\n[Music]\nthere\nokay um so increased recruitment of the\nPFC lead to the dampened activity in the\namydala and a market attenuation of\nautomatic responses comparable to\nshutting down the affective system okay\nso this is what we just talked about\nright so remember that your PFC shuts\ndown your amydala we're going to\nsuppress your emotion this is a huge\nproblem okay so now we get\nto this why is this a problem so this is\na problem\nbecause the amydala is fundamentally\ninvolved in salience detection in\nEmotion processing such as the\ninitiation of stress and fear response\nso the last thing that we absolutely\nneed to talk about is\nsalience so salience is\nimportance so the problem is that a lot\nof these\ncircuits are involved in the process of\nsalience so salience is like basically\nhow our brain knows whether something is\nimportant or not\nimportant and what happens when we shut\noff these circuits of the brain is we\nlose the capacity to tell what is\nimportant or not important and what I\nmean by lose the capacity to tell what\nis important I'm not talking about like\nanalytically I'm talking about in the\ndeeper circuits of your\nbrain up here you know that [Â __Â ] matters\nyou know it's important to wake up every\nday you know it's important to go to\nyour job you know it's important to work\non your resume you know it's important\nto eat healthy you know it's important\nto do yoga you know it's important to\nexercise you know all of these things up\nhere but what happens in people who are\ntraumatized and who have dissociation\nand depersonalization is they cannot\nbring themselves to do what is important\nlike I just don't feel like it I feel\nnumb I have no idea what the [Â __Â ] I'm\ndoing in\nlife right like I don't feel connected\nto the world I look around and I see\nother people feeling passion I don't\nfeel\npassion I don't know like what I'm doing\nI'm just kind of\nexisting what is the core problem here\nis a loss of Sal\nso in the Primitive circuits of our\nbrain when they feel like something is\nimportant that drives us to\naction so when we unplug ourselves when\nwe dissociate we lose access to parts of\nour brain making things matter to\nus and when we lose the ability of\nthings to matter that's when we end up\nin these kinds of spaces\nright then I detach from my body and go\ninto the spirit realm and like that's\nkind of nice but then like life stops\nmattering we can't bring ourselves we\nbecome\namotivated this is the paralysis of\ninitiation we start existing we we start\nwe're just existing instead of living\nbecause we lose this capacity for\nsalience there's also a lot of other\nthings that go on here so like when we\ntalk about you know in our trauma guide\nwe dive into a lot about this this\nprocess I'm going to just speedrun it\nreal quick because this is I mean we\nliterally have hours and hours of stuff\non this right so then the other problem\nis that when I fracture the\nself now like when all of my salience\ncomes from here this is where salience\ncomes from but now it's separated from\nmy sensory input my memories my sense of\nidentity nothing like who I am does not\nrelate like the part of me that cares\nabout stuff is separated from who I am\nso the identity sense of identity gets\nmessed\nup and once my sense of identity gets\nmessed up and we're going to just once\nagain kind of talk about this very\nquickly what we know oh [Â __Â ] I'm not\neven screen sharing sorry let me do that\nagain so the problem is that this stuff\nover here this is where salience is so\nthis is where our brain this is like\nwhere we feel things are important so\nwhen things are important to us that's\nwhen we get motivation that's when we're\nwilling to make sacrifice that's when\nour brain and our attention stays\nfocused so once we lose salience like\nour sense of identity like disappears\nwith it because I'm just I'm just around\nI'm just a pile of sensory inputs with\nmemories and like motor\nactivity that's what it means to be\ndepersonalized you recognize that\nthere's sensory input I'm seeing things\nyou recognize that you're doing things\nnow I'm eating something and the food\nhas a taste and I remember that I used\nto do this before and I enjoyed it in in\nthe past kind of but I'm not really\nliving because the importance and the\nvalue comes from here these circuits of\nthe\nbrain so what we tend to see in people\nwho have dissociation and\ndepersonalization is they have a lack of\na sense of\nidentity and that's because our identity\ncomes from a couple of very specific\nthings our identity comes from the\nnarrative\nintegration of emotional\nexperiences right so when I think about\nmyself who is Dr K Dr K used to be a\nvideo game addict who failed out of\ncollege and then went to India and\nbecame a monk and found himself I tell\nthis story about who I am that's not\nreally who I am right because that story\nis just what is it it's the emotional\nhighlights of my\nlife or the low lights too because\nthey're not all good but if you really\nlook at it\nI mean there's like 10,000 hours of\nDiablo I in that\nstory but like that doesn't become a\npart of my identity right so it's not\nour identity is not made up of what we\ndo on a day-to-day basis is is made up\nof an emot an integration of emotional\nexperiences and then I had that breakup\nand then I fell in love and then I\nshowed\nthem the a week before my wedding they\nreached out and they said hey will you\ngive me another chance and I was like\n[Â __Â ] you that's my\nidentity right like and so this is what\nhappens with dissociation and\ndepersonalization is we lose our sense\nof identity when we lose our sense of\nidentity we lose our motivation what am\nI doing in life I don't know I'm just a\n[Â __Â ] pile\nof I'm just a pile of sensory inputs\nmemories and motor inputs this is not a\nperson\nokay because we're SE segregating this\nout so what we know is that developing a\nnarrative is very very helpful for the\nhealing of\ntrauma\nokay\nso like we'll we'll talk about this a\nlot in in the guide where there's like\nyou know videos on integrating your\nemotions and stuff like that we'll get\nto that some of that stuff in a minute\nbut definitely check that out if you\nguys are interested in this so there's\nalso like all all these different\ndimensions that we haven't talked about\nso remember that just to give you all a\ncouple of examples so remember that the\nthe dissociation is a\nresponse to overwhelming\nactivity so there are particular\nphysiologic techniques that you can use\nto downregulate that activity and if you\ndownregulate the activity you no longer\nneed to dissociate to protect yourself\nif you no longer need to dissociate then\nyou have a sense of identity then you\ncan integrate that emotional experience\nso avoiding dissociation is part of the\npath of healing we need to integrate\nthose emotional responses we need to not\ntrigger that dissociation we need to\nfeel what we need to feel we we need to\ncalm down our physiology and so all that\nstuff is laid out in the guide how do\nyou do that in a step-by-step\nmanner okay I'm not saying that I'm\nsaying that because we this is not a\ncomplete there just it's just way more\nthan we can cover today that's my point\nwe're going to talk about what to do in\na second so before we do that though I\nwant to talk about gaming in the\ninternet so now we have a huge problem\nso if we look at the world today what we\nsee is problems of dissociation and\ndepersonalization manifesting in a ton\nof people who do not have diagnosis of\ndepersonalization disorder borderline\npersonality disorder derealization\ndisorder dissociative identity\ndisorder okay we see a lot of a\nmotivation we see a lot of I'm just\nexisting we see a lot of I should do\nthis one day I should do this one day I\nshould do this one day we see a lot of\nShame and\nguilt right I'm ashamed of myself for\nwhatever reason and what's going on here\nso I think what's happening is if you\nlook at dissociative identity disorder\nor multiple personality disorder right\nso these are situations where once again\nagain the brain the Mind\nfragments into different things and\nsometimes what can happen is these\nfragments can start to\ndevelop so it's like what I'm going to\ndo is clone myself I'm going to split\nmyself into two human beings and I'm\ngoing to level myself up in these\ndifferent places so now like Dr K like\nDr Jackal is over here Mr Hyde is over\nhere and then I alternate between the\ntwo and whichever one I am is the one\nthat I level up on a particular day so\nover time these identities start to\nbecome more concreted they become more\nsolid so now what we're\nseeing on the Internet is that the\nvirtual world allows us to do this\nprocess\nbetter the virtual world intersects in\nso many ways along this dissociation and\ndepersonalization\naxis so just to give you all a couple of\nexamples right so let's run through the\nstuff that we talked about and y'all\ntell me whether the internet and\nTechnology enhances what we're talking\nabout or depletes what we're talking\nabout emotional\nnumbness technology enhances or depletes\nemotional\nnumbness being able to be one thing in\none moment and another thing in another\nmoment when I play World of Warcraft I\nam a guild leader who is feared and\nrespected every day I get messages from\nnoobs asking to join my\nguild and in the real\nworld I work at a checkout counter from\n9 to 500 and then I hate going to work\nand then I post on the internet about is\nthis what life\nis this feels like a bad\ndeal to work for 40 years of my life\nfrom 9 to 5 hate that part of my life\nfor 2 hours of enjoyment being my work\nwow Guild leader self this sounds like\n[Â __Â ] this is a raw\ndeal so there's the sentiment that is\ngrowing right that like work is bad and\nall I want to do is hang out and play\nvideo games all day this feels like a\nraw deal and then we get mad at the\nbillionaires which I'm not saying that\nthey're free of criticism by all means\ncriticize them but we have to understand\nthat there can be problems in the world\nand can be problems in our\nself\nokay so what we also see in dissociative\nidentity disorder is the daydreaming is\nanother aspect of it so do we see that\nin the virtual world do we see the\ndevelopment of alternate\nidentities so this is really important\nto understand so what we tend to see in\nthese studies right so this is just one\nstudy but there's others\nso let's talk about this for a\nsecond okay so figure one the psychic\npit model on the developmental roots of\nproblematic internet use so this is what\nhappens there's childhood experiences of\nloss neglect or\nabuse unresolved states of Mind\nregarding attachment\ndissociation and absorption to the\ninternet to protect the cell from\ntraumatic memories and then problematic\ninternet use this is the psychic pit\nmodel\nokay so like what this is kind of saying\nis if we look at the virtual\nworld what we find is that people who\nget addicted to the internet usually\nhave a history of trauma or\nneglect now this is also changing a\nlittle bit because as the internet\nbecomes more addictive the amount of\ntrauma or neglect we need to get\naddicted is going down so now we have we\nused to have severely damaged people who\nwould have addictions but as the add\naddictive potency of the thing goes up\nwe don't need to be quite as damaged to\nget\naddictive then what happens is we have\nthese different problems so like in this\npaper they really focus on attachment\nTheory and our ability to form bonds so\nwhen we have difficulty forming bonds\nwith other human beings the internet\noffers us this place to form bonds in an\neasier way it allows us to dissociate\nfrom our\nlives and now I have all these friends\nonline I can hang out with people on\nDiscord all the time but I'm socially\nanxious in the real world so what I'm\ndoing is I'm separating myself out I'm\nliterally dissociating and fragmenting\nmy\nidentity into these two people and then\nhere's the real problem I am investing\nall of my energy all of my motivation\nall of my drive and all of my passion\ninto the dissociated self into the\nvirtual identity I am grinding for 10\nhours a day to get this\nMount and then we look at the rest of\nlife and we say I don't want to\nparticipate in this why can't I\nparticipate in\nthis and if you really pay attention\nwhat you'll find is that in the virtual\nworld we feel safe so in the virtual\nworld we don't need to separate and numb\nourselves because it feels safe and\nsince it feels safe all of the emotional\nenergy can come out and since all of the\nemotional energy can come out we can get\nto we can avoid the paralysis of\ninitiation there is salience things feel\nimportant to\nus the insula does not need to be\nsuppressed when we are in the virtual\nworld and this is the basic problem if\nany of y'all are ever wondering why the\n[Â __Â ] can I not live my life with passion\nbut I can grind at this game for 10\nhours a day this is the\nreason when I ask you when you are\nplaying the game does it feel important\nyour logical mind will say it is not\nimportant but I ask you does it feel\nimportant you say\nyes you are connected to your salience\nwhen you're in the virtual world because\nit feels\nsafe it helps you manage your\nemotions when we look at the virtual\nworld we get\nthis\nright so we have something that\nwill modulate our emotions for\nus we can allow ourselves to feel when\nwe're playing on the internet we are\nmore integrated between\nidentity\nemotions\nsafety and so we go on investing in this\nversion of\nourselves and when we invest in this\nversion of ourselves then like we hate\nthe rest of\nit and even if you say like okay\nlogically I know that the virtual world\nisn't real but we're not talking about\nlogic we're talking about the Primitive\nparts of your\nbrain right so we haven't talked about\nmany cortical structures here this is\nall deeper\nstuff so what we're seeing in social\nmedia is literally the creation I want\nyou all to think about Charlie and the\nself-recognizing parts right so we\ntalked about this study where when\npeople with\ndissociation look at picture\ndepersonalization look at pictures of\nthemselves they don't see themsel what\ndo you think filters do to that part of\nyour\nbrain when you create a version of\nyourself that you love more using a\nfilter and then you look in the mirror\nand you don't see the good version of\nyourself what do you think happens\nactivation of Shame and guilt and then\nin the real world when I look at myself\nin the mirror I feel shame and guilt\ntrigger dissociative mechanisms cool\ndissociative mechanisms shut off the\nshame and guilt\nwhen I trigger that dissociation I lose\nsalience I lose importance I lose\nmotivation so what do I do I don't do\nanything to fix my\nappearance I log online I play a game\nfor a few hours and then the cycle\nrepeats\nitself so everything that the virtual\nworld is offering us allows us to lean\ninto these dissociative mechanisms\nso now the question is what do we do\nabout\nit\nso I've got a couple of answers for you\nin no particular\norder the first thing is that we know\nthat trauma related treatment is very\neffective okay so there are things like\nEMDR and EMDR I think it works pretty\nwell I don't practice EMDR but I've seen\nvery good outcomes on an anecdotal level\nwith it there are a lot of people in the\nacademic Community who think that EMDR\nis overblown eye movement\ndesensitization retraining or something\nlike\nthat but basically what happens in EMDR\nwe go into a lot of detail in the guide\nbasically what happens in EMDR is we\nrecall traumatic memories but since we\nare doing a particular attentional task\nwe can go through the traumatic memory\nwithout it triggering the emotional\nresponse so now we can integrate this\npart back into ourselves without it\nbeing emotionally overwhelming and\ntriggering the\ndissociation so I can touch that thing\nwithout it feeling overwhelmingly hot\nthat I have to retreat from so this is\nvery effective I think Psychotherapy is\nquite effective for things like\ndissociation and there are particular\nkinds of psychotherapy like EMDR that\nmay be more effective your mileage May\nvary and and there is isn't it it's not\nlike a consensus opinion\nokay second thing is we have to learn\nhow to feel and if we look at what EMDR\nis that's the general goal right so even\nif you don't have a history of\ndissociation dissociative identity\ndisorder or something like that so if\nyou've got one of those diagnoses\ndefinitely get a a you need to seek\nmedical care okay there's no question\nabout that like I would not go coaching\nor meditate your way through this if\nyou've got something that qualifies as a\ndiagnosable disorder you should be in\ntreatment that is the right\nanswer I'm not saying that you can't get\nbetter without it but on balance that is\nabsolutely the right\nanswer but the second thing that we can\ndo is we can look at okay what is the\noverall goal of that what is that what\ndoes that what does that treatment\naccomplish so the what the treatment\nreally accomplishes is the integration\nof self that is our overarching\ngoal so you must become a complete\nperson and what do we mean by complete\nperson we mean all of those aspects of\nidentity need to be there so sense of\nself memory emotion motivation sensory\nexperience motor activity level of\nConsciousness all of that stuff needs to\nbe integrated now what is the problem\nwith\nintegration the problem with integration\nis that the emotions are usually\noverwhelming right so if we look at like\na lot of these brain circuits they come\ndown to emotion that's what we're\nfocusing on today I mean they they\nreally come down to\neverything um just to kind of give you\nall a quick example right so let's\nremember that\nlike I mean we can't do this in two\nhours because this is this is everything\nright we're not even talking about\nlanguage processing we talk about that\nin the guide so if you guys want a more\ncomplete version of this you want all\nthe other layers check out the guide\nbut what we're kind of focusing on today\nis you need these these things need to\nbe connected so we're focusing on the\nanterior singulate the insula the\namydala and the\nhippocampus so what we need to do in\norder to form healthy memories is\nintegrate our emotional\nexperience once you have a string of\nhealthy memories and healthy memory\ndoesn't mean good or bad it just means\nemotionally Salient stuff kind of tied\ntogether and accepted it can involve a\nbreakup that's fine doesn't have to be\nfalling in love you can do\nboth but Alexia or emotional numbness is\na huge part of this because when the\nemotion becomes too high it triggers the\ndissociation so what we need is the\ncapacity to feel emotion without\ndissociating so we have a lot of tools\nthat we've built at HG around reducing\nAlexia understanding your emotions\nsitting with your emotions this is\nincredibly important so the nice thing\nabout even things like if you look at\nthe internet right so internet involves\nemotional\nexpression people are so angry on the\ninternet they'll tilt they'll call you\nall kinds of nasty things so that\nemotion comes out\nthere generally speaking what I've\nobserved being on the Internet is that\nthe degree of toxicity for a gamer\ncorrelates with their General\nunhappiness in life\ngenerally right cuz the game is really\ngood at bringing out even the most\ndegenerate Parts out I mean I tilt every\nonce in a while when I play games but\ngenerally speaking I'm pretty happy in\nlife but you have these people who are\njust chronically toxic and like their\nlives are not\ngood so what we have is all this emotion\ncoming out in the virtual world instead\nof feeling it in the real world so we\nmust start feeling in the real\nworld it's okay to feel pain it's okay\nto feel shame it's okay to feel whatever\nright and it's really interesting so we\nhad a an interesting post\num you know so like we're just going to\nflash this for a second learning how to\nfeel my emotions and how healthy gamer\nruined therapy for me in a good way so\nthis person is talking about how so we\nemphasize\nAlexia and so this person was in therapy\nbut like this happens a lot where\num whenever I talk to my therapist I see\nhow I I how much I slip into analytical\nmind and try to be my own therapist I\ndon't actually confide insecurities to\nher or emotions at all it's like I need\nher to believe I'm improving so she\ndoesn't give up on me but I didn't feel\nthat way in coaching I did initially but\nnot at the\nend right so so and this person is kind\nof talking\nabout talking with my coach helped me\nsee how my emotions are connected to\ndeeper parts of myself and how they\ncommunicate I'm better at listening\nlearning to listen to intuition and\npause when I feel something come up\ninternally so when you're dissociating\nyou don't have this capacity in my in\nfeeling my emotions I can interact with\npeople more fully and be present I'm not\ngreat at it but I've gotten so much\nbetter at taking a second to check in\nwith myself and see how I'm doing\nemotionally and I saw how not feeling\nthem had overtaken me I was acting out\nat small things and couldn't cope when\nsadness became too strong there was only\nso long they could put me in a box so\nnow in my adulthood they've become\nexplosive right so that they used to put\ntheir emotions in a box and now they're\nthey feel explosive so I'm not I mean\nyall can check out coaching if you want\nthat's not what the purpose of that is\nit's just a I I think it's a it's an\nexample of someone's story of becoming\nless more emotionally connected and less\nalexithymic and by the way that you know\ngood therapists will handle that part\nthat you know this person had so it's\nit's not a a it's not a criticism of\ntherapy this happens all the time in\ntherapy therapists are trained to see\nthat okay the point is when you connect\nwith your\nemotions then you will\nsee all kinds of stuff start to happen\nyou need to be able to settle your\nemotions you need to be able to feel\nyour\nemotions you can't dissociate away from\nthem okay next thing that we need to do\nis strengthen our brain circuits so this\nis related to Lexia but the the reason\nthat we tell y'all about these kinds of\nthings is that we see when we talk about\nNeuroscience this is not just about\nunderstanding it is also about\nintervention and I love it that you guys\ngot this right because I asked you if\nthis is the problem in depression what\nis the treatment and if you understand\nthe brain science I want yall to really\nunderstand this y'all over the course of\nthis Le\nfigured\nout what MD phds who make billions of\ndollars for pharmaceutical companies\nthey are utilizing the same approach to\ndevelop\ndrugs they're looking at this brain\nscience and they're saying this is what\nwe need to\ndo and they are utilizing ketamine\nbecause ketamine has been used in\nanesthesia for like a 100 years only\nrecently did it start getting used in\ndepression so so some five head mdphd at\nlike Stanford school of medicine or\nHarvard Medical School came up with some\ntreatment working with\nfizer and y'all [Â __Â ] three heads\nfigured it\nout so if you understand the brain\nscience you will be able to implicitly\nunderstand what you need to\ndo we've tried to break that down for\nyou\nsome right so now like what are the\ncomponents the first thing is recognize\nthat if you're struggling with a\nmotivation you need salience if you\nyou're not going to get salience with\nemotional\nnumbness sense of self involves\nintegration of emotional experiences and\nforming a narrative so start to form a\nnarrative of your life who are you and\nyou say I don't\nknow the other thing to understand is\nwhen we talk about trauma there's two or\nthree different layers that we need to\naddress so one is this Neuroscience\nlevel where we want to meditate and\nreconnected with our insula we want to\nbecome a less alexithymic all that stuff\nis good and there we want to adjust our\nhyperarousal we want to work on things\nlike daydreaming and intentional control\nall that stuff is there but then there\nare two other aspects that we need to\ndive into which we just don't have you\nknow the detail the time for the detail\ntoday the first is we need to re-engage\nwith\nrelationships so as long as our\nrelationships are absent from our life\nthis becomes very difficult so if we\nlook\nat the psychic pick model and on the\ndevelopmental roots of problematic\ninternet use it involves attachment\ndisorganization this is Step number two\nso let's understand this\nokay I only need to dissociate and numb\nmy emotions when I can't share them with\nsomeone else so as a human being the\namount of emotion that I experience is\nby definition more than I can\nhandle I I experience more emotions than\nI can handle you experience more\nemotions than you can handle the whole\nhuman race can feel more emotions than\nthey can\nhandle which is why we evolved in\ncommunities so if you look at what\nhumans do for each other and not just\nhumans animals do this for us as\nwell so we know that animals can improve\ndepression can improve anxiety I think\nextend lifespan by like 4 years like\nthat's nuts could be wrong on the number\nit's been a while since I looked at the\nresearch so as human beings we are not\ndesigned to handle our own emotions\nwe're designed to handle them in\nconcert so as long as you are\ndisconnected from other human beings\nthis is going to be very difficult the\ngood news is when you connect to other\nhuman beings and you share with them and\nthey share with you it strengthens\neverybody and now you don't need to\ndissociate to deal with your emotions\nthe Crux of this at least the the\nanswers that I'm sort of offering is\nhypotheses\nreally the answer is to avoid the\ndissociative process why does the\ndissociative process happen because of\nextensive overblown emotion so let's\ntarget that there are other studies that\nshow we didn't get into much detail\naround this but I can show you all real\nquick\num give me a second\nwhat hold on\nchat here we\ngo right so then we've got like some of\nthese papers\ntoo so we can't go over all this but you\nknow trauma and anxious attachment\ninfluence in the relationship between\nsuggestibility and dissociation right so\nanxious attachment dissociation a model\nof dissociation based on attachment\nTheory and\nresearch okay so we have like a lot of\npapers that suggest that dissociation is\nfundamentally connected to the way that\nwe relate to other human beings if we\ncan't connect to another human being we\nwon't connect to\nourselves and there's so much research\nthat shows us that the way that our\nsense of identity is based relationally\neven our own understanding of our own\nemotions is determined by emotional\nmirroring from our\ncaregivers so if you're alexic the\nnumber one cause of Alexia is a lack of\nmirroring by other people and this works\nvery simply so if I'm a baby I don't\nknow what I'm\nfeeling like I don't know like I just\nfeel all this pile of stuff so how do I\nfigure out what I'm feeling I pay\nattention to the people around\nme right this a great example of this is\nbaby is running and\nfalls and then for a flash of an instant\nthey look at the people around them they\nlook at the adults if the adults laugh\nthey laugh if the adults are like oh my\nGod then the baby starts crying the baby\ndoesn't know what am I is this funny or\nis this dangerous I can't I don't know\nso they look at the people around\nthem and then the people like oh my God\nand the baby's like oh [Â __Â ] this is\ndangerous and then they start crying and\nthen the adult Picks Them Up they're\nlike it's okay baby it's okay it's okay\nand then the baby kind of calms down\nit's like Okay cool so if you look at\nwhat's going on and there's so so much\nsignificance\nthere now my who is managing my emotions\nsomeone else is managing my\nemotions and the weird thing about that\nis when someone else manages my emotions\nI learn how to manage my own emotions it\nmay sound like a contradiction but it\nisn't when people around me speak\nEnglish I learn how to speak English\nwhen people around me Express politeness\nI learn how to express\npoliteness babies learn through\nobservation not\nself-reflection\nabsurd and so we learn how to contain\nand manage our own emotions through the\nmodeling of the people around us so we\nmust re-engage in healthy relationships\nthis is critic for\ndissociation okay and if we look at like\nthe roots of all these [Â __Â ]\ndissociative disorders trauma especially\naround your early caregivers is like a\nnumber one risk factor because that's\nwhat was broken that's what has to be\nfixed so forming healthy relationships\nis\ncritical the last thing is like this is\nkind of\nmore\nabstract is that we have to learn how to\nlive\nlife we can't Retreat from life\nanymore and the problem is that it's\neasy to retreat from life because life\nis\n[Â __Â ] but it's only [Â __Â ] until we start\nengaging with it so right now what goes\non with so many people that I work with\nsee talk to is that they're separating\ntheir life into two\nchunks one is their virtual life and one\nis their real life and everyone is\nretreating away from the real life and\nleaning into the virtual life they're\nlike oh my God is my whole life just\nworking for 40 years and then I get to\nplay games on the weekend and like what\nthe [Â __Â ] this this sucks and my antidote\nto that is that like start living a life\nthat is worth living right it takes\nwork but the more that I don't know like\nwhen when I play [Â __Â ] video games for\neight hours a day I don't feel like\ndoing anything in my life I don't feel\nlike working out I don't feel like\neating healthy I don't feel like working\non a book I don't feel like work I don't\nfeel like doing anything\nbut I do want to get better at the\ngame and so the more that we invest into\nthis dissociated part of oursel the less\nwe want to invest in this other\npart I'm not saying that this is easy\nthe last thing I'm telling youall is the\nhardest thing start to live life and\neven if you're unhappy with your job\nthis isn't a oh I'm supposed to work for\n40 years and then like I get to retire\nand then have fun no the whole point\nwhat we try to teach you all is how to\nmake your daytoday life enjoyable and\nlivable sometimes it involves changing\nyour job sometimes it involves changing\nyour attitude sometimes it involves\ndoing something\nelse right there are parts of my job\nthat I don't like there have been parts\nof my job that I disliked before and\nwhen I had a job before that when I had\na job my first job was serving ice cream\nthere are parts of that job that I\ndidn't\nlike there are always going to be parts\nof life that you don't like\nI don't think you should resign yourself\nto living exclusively those things and\nthat's how it's going to be for the next\n40 years you adapt what you can you\nchange what you can you accept what you\ncan't and you try to do better\ntomorrow but the ultimate antidote to\ndissociation is like not stopping to\nlive life it is like starting to\nre-engage with life and we know that\nhaving a healthy relationship is a good\nprognostic factor for resolution of\nsymptoms of BPD\nnow a lot of people will interpret this\nas oh I need a relationship in order to\nbe fixed from BPD no you don't that's\nblack and white thinking that's a\nfeature of\nBPD but start to live\nlife that's ultimately the best\nanswer and now you'll say but I can't\nlive life the whole problem is that when\nI try to live\nlife this happens I'm not actually\nliving life or this happens or this\nhappens and that's\nokay like this is going to happen for a\ntime but as you start reconnecting with\nyour emotions as you start feeling safe\nas you start reconnecting with other\npeople as your salian circuits start to\nactivate as you\nstop relying on the te of the virtual\nworld for your\ncomfort all of these things will start\nto improve I believe believe that as you\nengage in\ntherapy as you do EMDR all of that stuff\nwill help and there's a lot of things\nthat we haven't even touched on so\nremember that when we look at some of\nthis stuff right there are like\ndimensions of this that we haven't even\ntouched which can be incredibly\nhelpful so one is we talked about motor\ninputs\nsorry we talked about motor inputs but\nwe haven't talked about motor input at\nall but if you look at people like\nBessel Vander so he runs this a absolute\nChad trauma researcher and clinician he\nruns this place called the trauma center\nand foundational for him is doing\nyoga I don't know where he's from I\ndon't know if it's like German or\nAustrian or swiss or whatever I don't\nknow that or maybe he's Dutch I don't\nknow but like you know the he's not\nIndian I\nthink but there's a lot of evidence that\nshows that even doing yoga\nactually we should probably add that to\nthe list so what happens with yoga is\nYoga gives you or taii gives you an\nembodied\nawareness so when you're doing yoga your\nsense of it you are in\nyourself when you are doing yoga that's\nvery healthy spending time in yourself\nactually reduces this kind of\nactivity this changes when you do yoga a\nlot okay\nso like dissociation and\ndepersonalization are like huge\nproblems from a clinical perspect\nperspective they're quite rare and it's\na no-brainer that if you experience\ndissociative episodes I'd strongly\nrecommend you get a clinical evaluation\nand engage in treatment if that's\nnecessary but what we're also starting\nto see is that technology is really\nleaning into dissociation and\ndepersonalization it's enhancing it it\nis feeding it it makes it easier to do\nit allows us to segregate ourselves and\nput a piece of us over there and a piece\nof us over here in the moment that we\nsegregate ourselves we lose\nourselves you are not actually two\nthings you are one whole\nthing the whole is greater than the sum\nof its parts which means the moment that\nwe fracture ourselves we become less\nthan we\nare now this is NE Neary at times to\nsurvive dissociation is an\nadaptation it happens in\nanimals right and they're not all [Â __Â ]\nup in the\nhead but what helped us survive\nyesterday is keeping us from living\ntomorrow this is where we go back to the\ngoalie so the fundamental problem in\ntrauma is that you start surviving life\ninstead of living it and why is that\nit's it's not because you're dumb it's\nbecause you're smart it's because that's\nlike you tried to live and your brain\nwas like this ain't working we just got\nto survive and if you look at if the\nscope is survival you're living\nreactively you're living today you're\nnot thinking about tomorrow tomorrow is\nabout tomorrow let's just get through\nthe day and then tomorrow comes and then\nit's let's get through the day let's get\nthrough the day let's get through the\nday let's get through the day let's get\nthrough the day I'm bored today what am\nI going to do I'm going to play a video\ngame I feel like I should do this I\nshould work on my resume but that\nbenefits\ntomorrow ain't nobody got time for\nthat the future Dimension becomes\natrophied in people who have a history\nof trauma their brain's ability to think\nand plan in the future becomes atrophied\nthen they get confused they know they\nshould do something but the underlying\nmechanisms of the brain don't know how\nto do it up here you understand\nintellectually but you\ncan't\noperate it's like you be sitting in your\ncar and you can be like okay I have to\nturn this and I have to push the gas\npedal but if the engine's missing you're\nnot going to go anywhere this is what\nit's like to live with a history of\ntrauma the stuff on the inside is not\nworking the way that it should a loss of\nsalience a loss of emotion a loss of the\nfuture Dimension a loss of\nmotivation now the good news all of this\ncan get\nbetter so I have the most optimistic\nview when it comes to\ntrauma why because we're not quite sure\nif anything is truly broken these are\nadaptations see if you have something\nlike down syndrome or Prader willly or\nsomething like that right some kind of\nchromosomal anomaly or a collagen\ndisorder like ERS danlos Maran syndrome\nthat's like until we figure out how to\nrepair your genes that's something\nthat's\nfixed you can't change that trauma is an\nadaptation that can\nrewire so I've seen very severe trauma\nget so much\nbetter man like some really just intense\nintense suffering of people with BPD\nthese people get\nbetter remission rate of BPD at\nsomething like 16 years is 98%\nat 10 years it's like\n90% at 7 years it's like 85% or\nsomething like that even at two years\nit's something like 40%\nremission right so the odds are actually\ngood because there's not something\nfundamentally busted at least we have no\nevidence of that right\nnow could be that something's fund\nmentally busted but the whole point of\nlooking at all these brain circuits and\nbrain scans and things like that is we\ncan understand what's going on and it's\nnot that that part of the brain is\nmissing it's not like you have a stroke\nit is a connectivity\nissue this part is over modulating this\npart this part is under modulating this\npart this part is dormant this part is\nunderc connected we can fix all of those\nthings so don't give up\nhope and as you're listening to this if\nthis applies to you you won't feel\nanything which is\nfine right cuz the salian parts are\nmessed up so what I'm telling you may be\nintellectually important but on the\ninside you're like\nah\nokay but that's\nokay that's\nokay okay that's okay you don't need to\nfeel all of the Hope in this\nmoment right so even with the intellect\nso the the last thing I'll leave y'all\nwith\nright so people are saying I feel so\ndead inside yeah like I I get it right\nthat's okay it's okay to feel dead\ninside it doesn't mean that you will\nalways feel dead inside and take\nwhatever step you\ncan right so if that's looking into EMDR\nfantastic if that's if you guys do\nnothing else and this applies to you I'd\nsay have a consultation with someone\nlike a therapist or a psychiatrist\nthat's a great first step if that\ndoesn't work for you or you've already\ndone that or you're already in therapy\nfantastic then do a little bit of\nyoga participate a little bit in our\ncommunity events right it's not a\ntreatment for did by any means but all\nof these things we recognize this right\nwe understand this and we're trying to\nbuild stuff for\nyou and I don't know if yall remember\nstuff like touch grass and things like\nthat we've had some just\nincredibly successful brilliant\ncommunity\nevents right where we're where're trying\nto get yall to live life and a natural\nconsequence of that living life is like\nyou will have to deal with some of these\nthings we have the make it May challenge\ngoing on right now which is like we're\ngiving yall challenges to go and do\nthings in your life go and make the\nworld a better place learn\nself-expression I think we may be on\nself- expression week right\nnow right so like self-expression can't\nhappen unless you connect with something\nin\nyourself there are a lot of studies on\nthings like art therapy and stuff like\nthat that it's very effective and that's\nbecause you know I'm sure I mean I\nhaven't looked into this but I'm sure\nthat the mechanisms are it allows you to\nconnect with\nyourself art therapy is very\ntherapeutic there's all kinds of stuff\nthat's available don't give up hope\nokay\num okay so I think we're going to hop in\nwith one of our devs real\nquick and then we'll do do Q&A okay so\nwe'll answer questions in a\nminute we just have something cool to\nshow you chat\nLords okay so we're going to do\nthis and I'm going to pop out and I'm\ngoing to do this can you count to 10 for\nme we'll do Q&A in a second okay chat\nokay oh [Â __Â ] one two three four five\nkeep going 6 7 8 9 10 okay so I'm going\nto turn you down a little bit um and are\nyou going to screen share with me\nBrandon yes I will screen share with\nyou okay are you going to screen share\nsorry I didn't hear you um do you want\nto talk I think you want to talk about\nthe guide first right okay sure yeah but\ndo I talk about it or you talk about\nit um I can talk about\nit\nSEC hold on chat\nare so are you going to screen share\nwith me yeah I'm screen sharing right\nnow\nokay watch\nstream okay so we're g to do how do\nI there we go okay so we're gonna hold\non all right go for it\ntrinian yeah so um basically just want\nto show off like we've launched a tra\nmodule now which is this one at the top\nof the map right here um been a lot of\nwork from everyone on the team devs to\nget the map in design work to get all\nthis like interconnectedness um\navailable on the platform on this whole\nmap design that we've like started since\nlike what 2021 I think um skill tree IRL\nyeah skill\nIRL um and basically it's takes you uh\nfrom like a sequence\nof paths that you can take Choose Your\nOwn Adventure kind of learn more about a\ntopic so here in trauma we start with\nlike an introduction where you have an\nintro to trauma you have an overview of\nwhat this module is about um going\nthrough the core sequence of trauma\nessentially and then that gives you kind\nof like a baseline knowledge of um kind\nof what this trauma module is about and\nthen it goes into the different branches\nof you know physiology of trauma\nrelationships a clinical track to more\nunderstand from a clinical perspective\nand then a spiritual track which we've\nalways included a little bit of in every\nsingle guide and there's connections to\nother modules that we have how these all\nconnect together but really just wanted\nto Showcase that you know this is a a\nreally big work that's been in progress\nfor let's say I think two years right Dr\nK yes yeah so how long have you been\nworking on\nit on just the trauma guide or just\nlike oh trauma guide for me proba has\nbeen like six seven months since I've\nbeen actually involved but I think your\nscripting and all the filming and stuff\nbefore that so so the the dab stuff has\ntaken about seven months yeah that stuff\nhas taken a good chunk and also part of\nthis the time invested is because we\nrecognize that this is a very\noverwhelming um like skill tree I guess\nlike when you first come into the guide\nso what we've been working on also is\ncreating a much more mobile friendly\njust like um new user friendly\nexperience because originally when we\nstarted this it was just the three\nmodules of anxiety depression and\nmeditation\nand that kind of expanded into this huge\nADHD module that was added last year and\nthen the Tron module which out this year\nand really this has become like a really\ncomplex and convoluted kind of\num map to work with but we wanted to\nalso showcase some of the upcoming\ndesigns that we are doing to make it a\nlittle bit more user friendly and for\nyeah for can you show us that yes I can\nthat's so by the way if you guys find\nthis to be overwhelming and complex you\ncan thank Trin in here for fixing that\nbecause I certainly don't give a [Â __Â ]\nand the the greater the complexity is\nthe happier I feel because this is like\nan IRL skill tree as everyone is\npointing out and people are talking\nabout like Path of Exile and stuff like\nyeah like that's like I hate to break it\nto y'all but but understanding every\naspect of yourself is not a simple\nEndeavor and this actually gives me\nimmense amount of pride I understand\nthat it is overwhelming to to navigate I\nget that and that's why we have people\nlike trinian who it's his job to take\nthis mindboggling complexity and make it\naccessible for the\nnoobs yeah I mean definitely there's\nlike a lot if you want to talk about Dr\nK like the research that goes behind\ndoing all like building a guide from\nfrom the bottom up you can talk about\nthat because\nthere's can can you show us the um the\nsimplified version I was joking about\nthe noobs I I recognize that this is\noverwhelming and people don't know where\nto start so can you show us I because\nI've seen some of those mockups is that\nsomething that's ready to show the\npublic or not so much uh it's still in\nlike design form so we haven't gotten a\ninteractive like staging environment yet\nbut we're working on that getting it up\nthis week but I'm happy to share kind of\nwhat the designs do look like cool\num instead of like I like the logic\nbehind it um yeah can you walk us\nthrough this this I actually think is\neven arguably cooler to be honest yeah I\nreally like the design philosophy so the\nidea is that when we want a new user to\ncome into the guide or even like an\nexisting user um we want to customize\nthe experience a little bit more and\nguide them through the process so it's\nreally like an actual guide rather than\njust like you come in here and you just\nget thrown into it and you kind of just\nstart um rather we want to understand\nyou know what are you coming to the\nguide for we want to make sure that when\nyou come to the guide if there's\nsomething that we can help you with when\nyou're using the product that um you're\nable to actually be directed toward\nthose videos so this is cool so it looks\nlike they they have an option so they\ncan choose between guided experience\nused as a survey to create a tailored\npath through content based on your needs\nand interests or open experience which\nis if you want to just go through the\nmap you can still go through the map\ncorrect so cool yeah we want to keep\npreserve the map um because I think the\nnovelty of it and also just because like\nyou were talking about before the whole\nidea is like it's very complex it's not\nlike being able to see all these\nconnections and where they all connect\nto each other is very valuable too um\nbut yeah so we just start with a quiz\nhere this quiz um allows us to\nunderstand basically what your needs are\nwhen you come to the guide and also\nallows us to customize the experience\nlater on when you get through like the\nintroduction videos here um and this is\njust like an example of what the survey\nis it's very simple questions just like\non a scale one toi how do you feel about\nthese specific questions um I think the\nmax is like 15 questions that are all\nbasically just on a scale of 1 to five\nquick answers uh and then we just\ncalculate a score in our backend and\nthen that allows us to determine what uh\nwe recommend you later\non so um can you zoom in a bit more what\ncan you zoom in a bit more small on\nstream oh yeah sure let me see if I can\nzoom this in here is this a little\nbetter\nyeah see I can close\nthis\nokay um let me see and then so this is\nlike kind of the main page you land on\nwhere now instead of like the huge map\nwhere you can see right here there's\nstill an option to go back to the\noriginal map um here to see how it looks\nlike on the previous View but here we\nhave a start here where you go with like\nanxiety module overview or if you click\non the if you enter these different\nmodule tabs you'll get different views\non like what do we recommend if you want\nto watch these specific um videos in\neach\nmodule and what we want to do is direct\nyou through um kind of like the core\nknowledge so this is like the starting\npath here and the starting path contains\ntwo maybe like at most five videos of\njust like basic knowledge of what you\nshould understand in the module before\nyou continue on to kind of like the\ndifferent paths that you can go down and\nthese paths are outlined through topics\nof like science of anxiety for example\nhere anxiety Behavior mastering anxiety\nand the idea here is also just like if\nyou had a specific question about\nanxiety which one of these paths you go\ndown to get that question answered I'm\nsorry can you say that again oh so a\nspecific question like here is like what\nis anxiety where does it come from right\nif you want to understand that a little\nbit more you go down the signs of\nanxiety U playist essentially yeah so\nlike the the question sort of gives\npeople a sense of if if they're looking\nfor the answer to that question that's\nwhat you will find in that\nsegment yes that's correct so like once\nyou've watched that beginning path it\nopens up yeah and then here we kind of\nhave like recommendations or highlights\nof understanding you know based off that\nquiz you took at the beginning what do\nwe recommend for you um to watch to help\nyou kind of tackle the issues that\nyou've indicated in that survey\ninitially uh and then yeah so every\nsingle module has a bunch of different\npads you can go down we've just like\nlaid them all out here have a little\nthis is just design\nillustration yeah I mean I think it's um\na really good work from our designer and\nalso for or like conceptually thinking\nabout how to organize all these has been\na lot of um Team efforts from\neveryone yeah this I just show up and\nramble I think this is this is the hard\npart yeah and then also the last part\nhere is like we want to add a also a\nlittle bit of a guide to um like the map\nitself so maybe make the map a little\nbit less we have a guide to the guide\nyes we have a guide to the guide you're\ntelling me tran that this point our\nguide requires a\ntutorial correct okay our guide requires\na tutorial to to understand how to work\nuh how it works and I think it should\nhelp in terms of someone do we have any\nplans to develop a certification that\npeople have to go through in order to\nutilize the guide properly at some point\nlike is this like are you going to need\ntraining formal training or is tutorial\nI hope not I hope it won't ever become\nthat complicated\nbut yeah um so this also gives you an\nidea of like if you if you like the map\nview you can use it but also if you are\noverwhelmed and you just want to\nunderstand you know what where can I\nwhere can I go what can I watch clicking\non our little blabo in the bottom right\nhere we give you a recommendation saying\nhey you've watched these videos or\nyou've answered this stuff in the quiz\nhere's what we recommend you watch\nnext okay cool yeah that's um that's how\nwe've improved a little bit on the UI ux\nstuff um\ndone\nplaylist yeah I think everything else\nhere everything else is not too\ndifferent um here is like the lesson\npage that we've a little bit we've\nimproved a little bit in terms of the\nuiux here where we want to showcase the\num playlist that you're part of like\nyou're watching through these specific\nvideos and then doing these different\ntabs of understanding and accessing\ninformation that's relevant to the\nspecific lesson so any attached\nmeditation videos that are that are\nrelevant to this lesson or additional\nreading and references that have\nincluded or glossery terms that maybe\nneed to be defined are included in kind\nof the tabular format in the description\nof the lesson now instead of right now\nwhat it is is like a big long page um\njust like text I I know that uh I know\nthat we've done some like categorization\nof meditation videos and stuff like that\nis that a feature that you can show\nus uh yeah I think I can even that's\nalready live right now so let me switch\nback to\nmy\nbrowser so this is a another challenges\nthat like you know we teach a lot of\nmeditation um and people are often times\nwondering like okay what kind of\nmeditation should I\ndo so uh can you walk us through like\nwhat this page has yes so this page has\nevery meditation that's in the module in\nall the guides and what we've done with\nthis most recent iteration is we've\npinned this video to at the top left\nhere which is just Dr K where you\nwalking us through what you should do\nwith meditations and how you should\nutilize meditations how often should you\nstick to a practice before moving on to\nanother one and like generally like what\nlike how to go about meditation\npractices if you want to talk more about\nthat you can but that's basically what\nwe've done here which is like help you\nhelp new users who like come here and be\nlike okay where do I I start um like\nwhat what do I do with my meditation\npractice and how do I create a routine\nthis is kind of like the video to go to\nand it's pinned there in every view so\npeople are like always aware that it's\nthere yeah so so yeah and uh like if you\nguys look at the stuff at the top\nbecause I think I'm somewhat familiar\nwith this um so one of the challenges is\nyou know we've been we don't teach\nmeditation quite as much on on stream or\nat the end of lectures but one of the\nchallenges one of the reasons for that\nis is so we we've taught a lot of\nmeditation like on streams the challenge\nthough is that if people are like\nlooking for The Med like how do you find\nthe meditation that works for whatever\nyou want to do there's no way to index\ninformation from streams or it's very\ndifficult right because often times I'll\nmake up something on the Fly even if\nwe're talking about different like topic\nlike we can talk about generally the\nsame topic we can talk about trauma we\ncan talk about dissociation someone else\nis like I have trouble with motivation\nor Focus I'll I'll teach them some kind\nof meditation so another big thing that\nis cool about what um train and the team\nhave done is they've taken what we've\ntried to do is really build a library of\npractices a lot of this stuff um I'd say\nmaybe about half of this stuff we've\ndone on stream at some point but it's\nall organized here uh and then it also\nhas like different levels of stuff so\nyou'll see like there's like levels of\ndifficulty like there's basic\nmeditations Advanced meditations expert\nmeditations\num and then there's like different kinds\nof topics that you can select uh and\nthen go to like\ncognitive Y and so you know in the\nmeditation guide we talk about four\nGeneral paths to meditation so sometimes\npeople will have like difficulty like\nwhen I say you know focus on the breath\nthat's hard for them but if I ask\nsomeone hey notice how far outside of\nyour nostrils your breath extends\nadding an inquisitive aspect to it like\ntrying to figure something out where\ndoes your breath go inside your body\nwhere do you feel the most vibration\nfrom om chanting giving some people a\nquestion to answer in meditation keeps\nit very focused on allows them to stay\nfocused on the task as opposed to doing\nsomething repetitively that gets boring\nfor some\npeople um so we've tried to really build\nthis meditation index and each guide\ncomes with about a dozen\nmeditations um and and then you know so\nit's like if y'all are getting kind of\noverwhelmed like that's what this is\nfor yep cool and there always like\nfavoring also where you can favorite\nspecific ones that if you think are\nuseful to you you can favorite those\nones and get access to them easily too\num awesome Brandon anything else that\nyou wanted to share with\nus\num I want just wondering like do you\nhave anything to talk about in terms of\nlike when you're building a guy from the\nground up like the research that goes\ninto it all the script in and the\nexperience of filming with big cow or\nanything like that yeah sure so I can\ntalk about that a little bit so so I I\nthink that you know what you guys see\nhere is like is gorgeously designed and\nand stuff like that the devs put a lot\nof effort into it right and there's a\nteam of people that have been working on\nthis for about seven months is like\ntheir main goal I think maybe I'm wrong\nthere but uh but you know when we build\na guide it's like so just to give you\nall an example um you know there's a\nchance that our next guide will be\naddiction\nand the guide to addiction technically\nstarted 5 years ago so often times\nbefore we build a guide we've known that\nwe wanted to do something for that's\ntrauma related but even like what should\nbe included and what should not be\nincluded so for four years we've been\nstreaming and we'll stream topics\nrelated to trauma and then what happens\nis we'll see posts right like people\nwill say like oh but what about this and\nwhat about this and you know I tried\nthis and this doesn't work and so over\ntime the first thing the first step to\nbuilding a guide is paying attention to\nwhat y'all need from us and what y'all\ncan find\nelsewhere so the the first idea is like\nokay for people with a history of trauma\nand Trauma is tricky right because from\na clinical perspective these illnesses\ncan be quite debilitating and we really\ncan't fix that so then the question kind\nof\nbecomes and for me like the trauma guide\nwas born out of one major thought which\nis that trauma is not not technically a\npathology it is an\nadaptation so if you look at all of like\nmost illnesses right so if we look at\nlike an autoimmune disorder we have tea\ncells that attack our joints this is\nrheumatoid arthritis te- cells are not\nsupposed to attack our joints this is a\nmalfunction of the human body but if you\nreally look at trauma trauma is an\nadaptation for survival that then\nbecomes\nmaladaptive and we see so many questions\nin our community how do I do this how do\nI do this how do I do this I get\noverwhelmed when I go see my friends I\nmy social anxiety is really bad I don't\nhave any motivation I have no idea why I\nshould get up in the morning we see all\nof these questions and then at some\npoint what what I kind of realized is\nthat like the problems that yall face\ntoday are\nsolutions from\nyesterday so the reason that you stopped\ncaring about life is because caring in\nhurt caring didn't get you anywhere you\ngot punished for caring and so then the\nquestion is how can we teach youall\nabout yourselves and how you get formed\nand that's what the trauma guide is what\nare the most common things so if you\nkind of go on the physiology of trauma\nso I think this is where like you know\nwe look at things like physiologic\nrewiring so your nervous system\nliterally wires to be hyperaroused which\nmeans that\nin benign situations like you going out\nwith your friends you can feel a high\nlevel of anxiety even though you\nshouldn't and then we can tell you you\nshouldn't feel that way and people will\nask like how do I stop feeling anxious\nwhen I'm with my friends I feel so\nstupid this is a physiologic wiring\nproblem so how do you rewire your\nphysiology so we started off in sort of\nrecognizing that a lot of the challenges\nthat our community faces are from\nadaptations that they've made in the\npast and then the question is how can\nyou readapt or unapt how can you change\nthat adaptation and be in a healthy\ndirection so then what we did with the\ntrauma guide was look at okay what are\nall the levels of adaptation so there's\nphysiology there's emotions there's\ncognitions there's identity there's\nrelationships there's\nbehaviors and then there's like the\nspiritual stuff and so like once we\nunderstand all of these different\ndimensions of adaptation need to explain\neach of them in turn and then once we\nexplain each one we need to give you\nactionable information ideally for each\none of these things and so like then\nreally the goal is to go from start to\nfinish of like\nunderstanding how your your body your\nbrain and your mind have adapted and how\nto readapt and that's really what what\nthe goal of the the trauma guide is and\nthen each of those steps also has\nresearch so when I say like okay\nphysiologic rewiring and somatic illness\nyou know there's a bunch of papers that\nwe have to go through like in order to\nmake sure that what we're saying is like\nscientifically\nvalid\num yeah we try to include that also\nwhenever relevant to the video if you if\nthere is research as relevant or like\nyou know uh sources that are good to\nread as additional reading we've tried\nto include them in any of the relevant\nvideos yeah so so then out of\npotentially 100 videos what happens is\nwe take like let's say the 30 that are\nthe most\nvalid and we cut 70 so as we go through\na lot of research we'll like cut 70% of\nthe guide because the research isn't\nthere or it's not based it's not\nactionable or something like that so I\nthink like the other thing to keep in\nlike most of the guide is actually gets\ncut and then it's it's really the best\nstuff that makes it to the\nend um but that's a long process and\nthen there's also scripting and stuff\nlike that where like you know I'll write\na full script which is about the length\nof one non-fiction book and then we work\nwith uh um like a director and and like\nyou know we'll work the scripts and we\ntry to really make it so that um you\nknow I don't know if this kind of makes\nsense but today we covered some complex\nstuff and we had two hours to kind of\nmuddle through it what really makes the\nguide hard is that there is very very\nhigh yield dense accessible information\nand we'll sometimes film each video like\nthree or four times so what'll happen is\nlike a team will be like this is a\nreally important concept C but it was\nconfusing so we need to redo it and so\nwhat we really we we invest a ton of\ntime so to make a 20 minute video takes\nprobably about like 20 hours of work um\nand and that's just it's not just my\ntime it's also like people are reviewing\nit and then there's like script edits\nand there's a lot of like passing it\nback and forth so so there's a lot that\ndoes go into it and so that's why we're\nwe're kind of like I mean hopefully this\nwill help y'all and we tend to be pretty\nproud of it um cuz sometimes we'll get\nyou know feedback that you know the the\nguides are really useful and like we\nknow y'all are busy we know that you\ndon't have all the time in the world we\nknow there's a lot of [Â __Â ] that youall\nhave to do so we try to really make\nthings high yield and accessible and the\nthe less you ramble like the harder it\nis to\nbuild yes so yeah I mean I think that's\na lot of what the work we go in and the\ncharm module really has been a big\nproject that we have been working on\njust because it's like we're testing out\nnew things you want to do this new yoi\nyou want to make it a little bit more\naccessible to everyone so yeah cool\nthank you very much yep take care buddy\nand uh yeah thank\nyou okay we're going to do um a little\nbit of Q&A before we wrap for the day\nwe've got about 15\nminutes so that lecture was supposed to\ntake less time it ended up taking about\n2 hours\nwas supposed to take 90 minutes so what\nquestions do you all\nhave oh oh my God so many good ones okay\nI'm going to stop\nscrolling\nokay\num oh so good okay what's the\nrelationship between gender d in\ndissociation\num\nokay so what's the relationship between\ngender dysphoria and dissociation\ndepersonalization great question so we\nhave actually a really great video that\nI think is on YouTube we did a lecture\nsome time ago um but twitch doesn't\nstore vods on gender identity in\nneurodiversity so we know that your\nsense of gender identity comes from some\nof these interoceptive parts of your\nbeing okay so we know that like your\ngender identity like comes from places\nlike the insula and the PCC in the\ndefault mode Network so it is very\ncommon for people so we know your sense\nof identity\nis so we know that your sense of gender\nrelates to your internal experience of\nself the other thing that we know is\nthat trauma trauma messes with your\ninternal experience of self so if you\nhave a history of trauma you are more\nlikely to have borderline personality\ndisorder narcissistic personality\ndisorder you have dissociation you have\ndepersonalization all of these things\nare more common so it is very common for\nand we know this as well that um history\nof trauma is a risk factor for gender\nidentity related issues including gender\nidentity\ndysphoria so what we know is that when\nyou get traumatized you're sense of self\nbecomes for lack of a better word\nconfused right it is not quite as well\nformed and as your sense of self becomes\nnot as well formed gender identity\ndysphoria can enter into that space so\nthey're absolutely correlated and I\nthink Studies have shown that now I\ndon't\nknow the relative impact of\nneurodiversity\nBPD narcissism on dissociation\ndepersonalization on gender identity and\nI think one important thing to keep in\nmind is just because trauma is a risk\nfactor for gender identity that is not\nsaying so some people will interpret\nthat as gender identity is is a source\nis\nan is a manifestation of mental illness\nbecause it's related to trauma I don't\nthink you can make that statement fairly\nso there are some people that will make\nthat claim but I think this is where\nthere's a lot of like Nuance in the\nresearch and I don't think that that's a\nfair\nextrapolation um so that's how they\nrelated okay uh I know you mentioned\nthings like did in here can we also get\na deep dive specifically dedicated to\ncomplex dissociative disorders like did\nand\nOSD possibly is a short answer\nso we we get these kinds of requests a\nlot and remember just because you're\nasking today I mean the video may show\nup a year from now who knows so you know\neven this video or this\nlecture was something that has been in\nthe works in some way for like about 2\nyears so we know we've wanted to cover\nthis at some point the the key thing to\nkeep in mind is can we get a lecture the\nquestion that I have for y'all is what\ndo we give up to do that lecture I have\nno problem doing a lecture on\ndissociative identity disorder I think\nit's like fascinating there's a whole\ndifferent angle on this that we could\ntake about spirituality and the sense of\nself and even past lives there's all\nkinds of cool stuff that we can do about\nmultiple personality disorder\ndissociative identity disorder you know\nthe question that I have for yall is\nwhat would you rather I do uh a lecture\non the harmful impacts of alcohol and\nalcohol addiction nicotine and smoking\nsensation or dissociative identity\ndisorder so I'm not trying to shut\nanyone down for asking that I'm simply\nsharing with yall that I want to talk\nabout at all and the question is where\nis the priority so often times you know\nwhat really Inspire like and it's not\nthat we have to talk about things that\nare the most common so we actually are\nvery careful about that so even if you\nlook at\num you know this this uh video that I\nreferenced earlier about neurodiversity\nand gender identity so 1% of people are\nnon-binary and 1% of PE 1 to 3% of\npeople are on the autism spectrum let's\nsay um and so if you look at that that's\nlike 1% of 1% so this is like a tiny\nslice of people but we loved making that\nvideo like that's okay so I think it\njust the kind of answer is it\ndepends um okay if I go to therapy don't\nget ret traumatized and heal will my\nbrain look like a non-traumatized brain\nor are there physiologic changes to my\nbrain bind on pickup okay that are\npermanent basically is neuroplasticity\nreparative or\ncompensatory what a great question I\nthink\nthat effectively I think it's not buy\nnon pickup so I think\nthat I think we see so I I don't know\nright so we don't so if we look at\nstudies on people with BPD and we see\nBPD in\nremission I have not seen a single study\ndoesn't mean that it's out there and now\nI'm curious about it looking at fmri of\nsomeone with BPD before and after\nremission so like we know for example\nthat there are changes in the\nconnections between your frontal loes\nand your amydala and BPD I don't know\nwhat happens to those changes if that's\nbeen borne out in a like fmri\nstudy I suspect though that your brain\nchanges and there's a ton of\nneuroplasticity and the reason for that\nis because the clinic\nmanifestations of a certain wiring of\nthe brain are no longer\nthere right so we know that when you\nhave decreased control of your negative\nemotional circuitry from your frontal\nloes this results in emotional\ndisregulation when you in remission that\nemotional disregulation is practically\nor clinically\nnonsignificant now the question becomes\nthere are two questions the first say if\nthere is no longer clinically\nsignificant emotional\ndisregulation has the brain\nchanged I think the answer is probably\nundoubtedly yes to some degree because\nwe also know that some of the\ninterventions that lead to those\nclinical changes have been shown to\nchange our brain so using mindfulness\npractices and ground grounding practices\nabsolutely does enhance the connections\nbetween your frontal loes and your\nemotional circuitry so we know that I\ndon't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut we know that treatment of BPD\nresults in a clinical Improvement we\nknow that meditating Alters your brain\nbut we don't necessarily know that\ntreating BPD Alters your brain I don't\nknow if that study has been done but we\nhave both of the pieces that have been\ndone the second question which I think\nis very important is does it\nmatter right so let's say that your\nbrain is still wired in an old way but\nclinically there's no change or the\nthere's no problem anymore does it\nmatter that your brain is still wired in\nthe old way I I don't know so I think\nthat's like almost like a philosophical\nquestion um and the short answer is we\ndon't really have the full answer but I\nam heavily leaning towards your brain is\nquite\nneuroplastic and probably a lot\nchanges\nokay\num would Yoga Nidra be effective to\nbuild salience not\nreally so I don't know maybe actually\nthat's a really interesting\nquestion\nso it's an interesting question my\ninstinctive answer is\nno so in Yoga Nidra the key thing is a\nsankalpa so Yoga Nidra has a couple of\ndifferent mechanisms of action the first\nis a rotating awareness of the body so\nthat'll definitely help you be grounded\nin your body it'll increase\nneuroplasticity of the somata Sens\ncortex so those are the things that we\nknow will\nhappen now salience and sunala are\nslightly different things so sunala is\nat the end of The Yoga Nidra practice\nyou do something called a sunala which\nis like build a resolve so you kind of\nimplant something in your unconscious or\nsubconscious mind that then like floats\nup to the surface so if you kind of\nthink about you know your impulsive\ndesires like today I feel like eating a\nhamburger so you're kind of D D D D D D\nD D D and you have a random encounter\nthat says I want a hamburger so this is\nkind of what desires are like in the\nmind you can think about them like a\nrandom encounter and an RPG right so\nit's like depending on where you are in\nthis random encounter you'll fight\nagainst like three imps and one\nboore so the thing about Yoga Nidra is\nwhen we use a sankalpa we're sort of\nediting the random encounter table so\nthat as you're D D D D D D D D you get\nrunning into a random encounter and oh\nlook it's a treasure chest so this is\none of those rare Random Encounters that\ndoesn't mess you up it actually gives\nyou something positive so sankalpa is\nalmost like implanting things in your\nunconscious that will then float to the\nsurface now whether that relates to\nsalience in the brain I'm not quite sure\nbecause salience in the brain often\ntimes relates to the significance of\nexternal\nstimuli so whether your brain decides\nthis is important or not important and\nthen the last last thing is that the\nsankalpa issue is um is a little\nbit tricky because we don't have any\nNeuroscience evidence that this even\nexists right so that's when things get\nreally tricky is that the more advanced\nesoteric yogic stuff is like more\ndivorced from science and some of it is\nactually quite contrary to science you\nknow it it in some ways so we don't\nreally know it's a fascinating question\nI love the question and I'll be on the\nlookout for it\num\nokay uh\nwould media how would mediation look for\na person with dissociation uh I'm\nassuming that means meditation so I\nprepared a\nlecture how does meditation look for\npeople who\nare dissociating hold on a second let me\nsee if I can pull this up\nso I made this some time ago and I\nwanted to do a video about it or a\nlecture about\nit\num so a while\nago I saw an interesting post about\nmeditation for\nPTSD and uh so what I did is I went\nthrough this is like a little bit more\nrelated to my clinical work\nbut what I did is look at the features\nof PTSD and complex\nPTSD um mapped out the organ system that\nis involved with this feature so we know\nthat people with PTSD have physical\nreactivity have\nhypervigilance have an increased startle\nreaction have emotional distress\nnegative affect difficulty experiencing\npositive a IR irritability or aggression\ntrauma related thoughts and feelings\ndifficulty in concentrating risky or\ndestructive Behavior Consciousness\nalterations distorted perceptions\nself-perception\nchanges and then what I did is I looked\nat like okay what's going on in the\nbrain or the body and then I tried to\nfigure out if we have any scientific\nevidence that meditation will affect\nthis thing and then which\npractices activate this thing if that\nkind of makes sense so for example when\nwe have physiologic\nreactivity there are some meditations\nthat activate the vagus nerve and calm\nus down by activating in in engaging the\nparasympathetic nervous system and then\nwhat are the practices that do that so I\nkind of built\nthis\ntable to try to talk a little bit\nabout how meditation can be geared\ntowards trauma so this is work that I\nwas doing many years ago at Harvard\nMedical School where this was like my\nday job is like like my job was\ndeveloping evidence-based approaches\nutilizing meditation in a targeted\nfashion particular meditative\npractices um to\nTarget\nspecific aspects of mental illness so\nthe short answer is does it get modified\nI would say\nyes um I'm still working on this I don't\nknow if this is ever going to see the\nlight of day beyond this\nbut you know you know trinian was asking\nlike can you tell tell us a little bit\nabout what goes into a guide so I mean I\ndo a lot of this stuff that doesn't see\nthe light of day and then we'll\neventually make it into a guide at some\npoint or something like that so the\nshort answer is that I think that there\nare adaptations that are necessary the\nbiggest adaptation that is NE so there's\nlike complex adaptations like what we\njust showed y'all and then there are and\nyou know I'm not recommending that you\nguys use that chart because the chart\nhasn't been vetted we haven't done\nclinical trials and things like that\nright this is just I'm working on it the\nmost important thing to keep in\nmind when it comes to meditation and\nTrauma is that in trauma our brain is\nsuppressing certain things and in\nmeditation what we're generally doing is\nopening up the mind right so like in\nmindfulness for example they'll say\nobserve your thoughts without engagement\nor attachment just notice your thoughts\nand let whatever thought comes come the\nproblem is that if you have a history of\ntrauma some of those thoughts you can't\njust\nobserve some of those thoughts are\nphysiologically overwhelming\npsychologically overwhelming will\ndestroy you which is why your brain\nkeeps them locked away at the basement\nit's kind of like thinking about nuclear\nwaste that's been buried right so if\nyou're like a mindfulness meditator and\nyou're like enjoy your surroundings and\nthen your surroundings is radioactive\nwaste you're going to die\nlike you will get radiation poisoning\nand you're\nscrewed so if you look at the\nevidence-based interventions for trauma\nthey are very specific meditation\ntechniques and they are usually from the\ngrounding dimension of meditation so\nEMDR is not open awareness of\nthoughts DBT does not have open\nawareness of thoughts they actually use\npowerful sensory techniques to pull you\ninto the present and out of your mind\neven self-injurious Behavior like\ncutting is almost like a meditation\ntechnique it leads to emotional Relief\nby focusing the attention of the Mind\noutside of the outside of thoughts so\nwhen patients engage in cutting I'm not\nrecommending that youall do cutting you\ncan meditate without hurting yourself\nbut cutting has some really\ninteresting associations the first is\nthat maximum pain for minimum\ndamage right you all get that so it's\nsurface level cut\nand even if you look at your the nerves\nin your arm for example so people will\ncut on the arm or the leg the thigh so\nyou have different kinds of nerves and\nyour pain receptors are really close to\nthe surface and then there are other\ndeeper pain receptors that don't get\nactivated so when people cut they\nactually do maximum pain with minimum\ndamage and then the question becomes why\nand if you ask people who cut they say\nthat this helps me it relieves mental\ntension it's still not healthy to do\nit's very effective but it's not healthy\nand that's why we teach people how to\nmeditate instead so we want to use\ngrounding techniques not open awareness\ntechniques in meditation related to\ntrauma or we want to use meditation with\na trained clinician who can help you\nmanage those emotions that come\nup um Jesus there's so many\nquestions ah what is the difference\nbetween dissociation from ego and\ndisolution of ego from traumatic versus\nspiritual so I think address that some\nin the guide we've talked about that a\nlot um so even we had a memberships\nlecture Deep dive into ego that's a\nwhole lecture which we can do if yall\nwant at some point um I I don't mean to\nbounce the\nquestion\num Can dissociation manifest as getting\ntired SL yawning when overwhelmed I\nsuppose\nso it's not something that I've seen\nmost of the search on yawning that I've\nlooked at has to do with\nsociopathy\num Can depersonalization result from\ngrowing up with ADHD\nabsolutely so you know I'm beginning to\nthink that there is a solid chance that\nif you grow up with\nADHD the process of growing up with ADHD\nis traumatic not always but there's a\nlot of evidence that shows that ADHD is\na causitive factor for depression and I\ndon't think that these like independent\nneurobiological mechanisms this is like\nwhen you grow up with ADHD you have very\npoor self-esteem you have a very poor\nsocial relationship situation you don't\nget invited to birthday parties you\ndon't wait your turn in line you get\nostracized so unless you become the\nclass clown no one really likes you and\nso that will lead to things like\ndepression and the mechanism of that is\nalmost certainly\ntraumatic interesting question about\nyawning oh how does dissociation affect\nromantic\nrelationships\num\nso\nokay\num let's which question was I answering\nokay I got time for one okay okay\ncan uh how does dissociation affect\nromantic relationships\num\nso the answer is absolutely so there's a\nwhole so in the trauma guide we dive a\nlot there's there's two lectures on\nrelationships so let's understand this\nvery simply okay so if you have a\nhistory of trauma engaging in\nrelationships is very difficult and if\nwe look at clinical diagnoses related to\ntrauma what we tend to find is that\nrelationship difficulties are part of\nthe clinical picture of trauma so in\nborderline personality disorder which is\nrelated to trauma we have a history of\nunstable and intense relationships\nthat's one of the diagnostic criteria if\nwe look at things like narcissism\nnarcissistic personality disorder is has\na feature that is difficulty in\nrelationships we also see difficulty in\nrelationships as features of complex\nPTSD so in complex PTS we\nhave\nuh impairments in things related to the\nself and that includes relationship so\nlet's understand\nwhy a\nrelationship is about a connection\nbetween you and me if there is a problem\nwith me there will be a problem with the\nrelationship if there is a problem with\nidentity there are definitely going to\nbe problems with relationship\nbecause then the me\nitself is not stable is problematic in\nsome way so if like you know if\nrelationship is a plus b and a is\nsomewhat messed up then a plus b is\ngoing to be somewhat messed\nup we also have evidence that shows that\ntrauma correlates with changes in\nattachment\nstyle so the more traumatized you are so\nin the cases of severe severe trauma\nwill a disorganized attachment style and\nthat is all about how you connect to\nother people you connect to other people\nin a disorganized way so we'll see\nthings like an anxious attachment style\nwhere if your needs were not met\nsometimes we become anxiously attached\nand we become clingy which will affect\nour relationships sometimes we have an\navoidant attachment style where our\nemotional vulnerabilities punished us so\nwe work very very very hard to be emot\nunavailable that will absolutely affect\nyour\nrelationships so in the trauma guide we\neven talk about sex and attachment style\nwhere people will utilize sexual\nrelationships to serve their attachment\nstyle so people who are anxiously\nattached will utilize sex to create\nemotional intimacy people who are\nsecurely attached will use sex to\nexpress emotional intimacy so the\nemotional intimacy is already there the\nsex is the fruit on the tree of\nemotional\nintimacy for people with an anxious\nattachment style sex is used to create\nemotional intimacy it is fertilizer so\nthat the tree\ngrows I'm going to utilize sex to make\nyou feel connected to me because if you\ndon't I don't feel connected to you I'm\ngoing to use sex to keep you here and\nmake you love me that's happens in\nanxious attachment style and then my\nfavorite the avoidant attachment style\nwhich is sex is utilized as the axe to\nchop down the tree of emotional Intimacy\nin avoid an attachment style sex is\nutilized to prevent an emotional\nconnection so since I feel connected to\nyou and in the past emotional\nvulnerability is something that has hurt\nme and I'm scared of I'm going to use a\nmechanical biological action to separate\nus this is just about sex\ndon't catch feelings let's be friends\nwith benefits let's turn this into a\nsituationship let's not make it a real\nrelationship because real relationships\nare complicated hard and sometimes\nemotionally hurt me and by the way I\ndon't really know how to participate\nwell in them I don't know how to\narticulate my emotional needs I don't\nknow how to feel vulnerable I feel\nscared it's terrifying so instead it's\nSmash and\ngo so there is a lot of relationship\nbetween attachment style relationships\nand Trauma\nand some of it has to do with our sense\nof identity and when our sense of\nidentity is not well formed we can't\nreally relate to people very well or it\nleads to a lot of mixed signals or\nconfusion in relationships because today\nI'm one way and tomorrow I'm a different\nway and then it can even form the way\nthat it can affect the way that we form\nbonds with people and even some\nsomething as simple as the sexual act\ncan have drastically different\nimplications for two different people\nright and we see that a lot in these\nsituationships where one person has an\nanxious attachment style the other\nperson has an avoidant attachment style\nso what happens in this scenario I feel\nyou being emotionally distant to me so\nlet's have sex so that I can pull you\nin and then when we have sex I'm using\nit to pull you in you're using sex to\npush me away and then we get really\nproblematic where this person is distant\nand then it leads to a lot of resentment\nthey just used me and so like all kinds\nof problems that we see with these\nsituations sh that are happening on the\ninternet a lot of this has to do with\nthis kind of\ncrap um so it's it's it's\nhuge so dissociation affects romantic\nrelationships very\nintensely is there anything about pnes\nin the trauma guide not directly so pnes\nis uh psychogenic non-epileptiform\nseizures um we do talk about somatic\nillness so I don't I know if we talk\ncover uh pseudo seizures specifically\nbut a lot of the stuff that applies to\nthere's a whole lecture on somatic\nillness a lot of the stuff in the\nlecture on somatic illness will apply to\nuh psychogenic\nseizures\num ham solo a dissociation and trading\ncan you explain what you mean by that in\nat me bro so I see it\nokay so what are the common things that\nlead to dissociation like gaming is one\nright okay so this is very important to\nunderstand gaming does not lead to\ndissociation gaming is an artificial\nform of dissociation so what leads to\ndissociation is usually overwhelming\nemotion so I'm unconnected I'm I'm\nfeeling feeling feeling feeling feelings\nare getting worse worse worse worse\nworse and when they rise Beyond a\ncertain threshold it's too much to\nhandle boom boom unplug the circuit\nwe're going to\ndissociate so dissociation is almost\nalways oh well actually that's not fair\nto say forget about that I don't know\nabout almost always but traditionally\nthe way we conceptualize dissociation is\nan overwhelming emotional experience\ntriggers\ndissociation gaming accomplishes the\nsame thing so gaming will induce a\nsimilar state of emotional numbness and\nsince we are using gaming gaming is like\nglane or anesthesia for our emotions and\nsince we're using this external thing we\nno longer need to trigger the internal\ndissociation great\nquestion\num is it true that BPD is just a more\nextreme form of disorganized attachment\nI don't think\nso I wouldn't describe it that way so\nthe features of disorganized attachment\nare quite severe and I don't think it is\none to one with BPD I think there are\ndifferent ways there different facets of\nlooking at a\nperson\num how do I find balance between feel\nyour emotions and rewire your brain I\nget either stuck intellectualizing\neverything or get lost in the borderline\ndepression\nburnout SL burnout yeah so\nthis so rewire your brain or feel your\nemotion which one so I think this is the\nchallenge right how do you find the\nbalance between oh like I should feel my\nemotions and I should fix my problems\nit's a really common issue okay this is\nthe last question we're going to cover\ntoday so a lot of times we'll say like\noh braah you should feel your\nemotions but it's like okay like let's\nsay I go through a breakup or let's say\nmy relationship is challenging how much\nof this is like I need to learn to sit\nwith my emotions of sadness and shame\nversus like I need to fix this\nrelationship or find find a different\npartner how do you know when you're\nsupposed to solve your problems or sit\nwith them great great great question\nbecause we say do both and if you're\ntelling me to sit with my problems\nshould I solve like doesn't that mean\nthat like I'm not solving them so at the\nvery beginning this seems like an either\nor but the better that you get at it the\nmore you will discover that it actually\nbecomes two birds with one\nstone so if you really pay attention to\nwhat keeps you from solving your\nproblems it is a inability to sit with\nyour\nemotions the two are actually one and\nthe same now let's understand why let's\nsay that I have a relationship that is\nnot going well what keeps me from fixing\nthe relationship it is the fear of the\nconsequence of trying to fix the\nrelationship if I set a boundary with my\npartner if I set a boundary with my boss\nI'm afraid they will break up with me\nI'm afraid they won't like me I'm afraid\nthey won't promote\nme so in order to avoid our negative\nemotions we start shaping our\nBehavior since we can't sit with our\nemotions the only choice is to avoid\nthem ever happening so then what happens\nis our life becomes controlled by\navoidance anything that leads to\nconflict or fear or shame I cannot do I\nam embarrassed about my body I feel\nashamed when I go to the gym so I'm\ngoing to sit at home\n[Â __Â ] right\ninteresting I'm tired of being walked\nover by my\nspouse but I'm afraid that they're going\nto get angry if I try to set a boundary\nwith them so I'm not going going to\nbring it up with them and I'm going to\ncontinue to Harbor resentment and I'm\nnot even going to give them\nfeedback that this is not\nokay so this is what's really\ninteresting fixing your problems is over\nthere accepting your emotions is over\nhere but when we do this this is the\nfirst step to go in this\ndirection okay if you really pay\nattention to it accepting your\ncircumstances is the first step to\nchange\nit doesn't mean an absence of change and\nthis is what really confuses people\nacceptance starts here but it doesn't\nmean a a particular goal right so we see\nthis very practically when we look at\nlike Alcoholics\nAnonymous these are people who've been\nsober for 30 years and they say hi my\nname is allo I'm an\nalcoholic you haven't had a drink in 30\nyears how are you an alcoholic yeah\nthat's how it works so they start with\nacceptance acceptance is the first form\nof change it's the first step of change\nbecause you have to accept Where You Are\nin order to go somewhere else now let's\nlook at the opposite of\nacceptance what do we call that\ndenial and how easy is it to fix a\nproblem when you are in\ndenial hey allo you have a drinking\nproblem no I\ndon't hey it's very hurtful to me when\nyou say these kinds of things no it\nisn't that is your insecurity that you\nneed to fix I'm not doing anything\nwrong\nright so sitting with your emotions and\nfixing your problems comes hand in\nhand so sit with your emotions accept\nthe way that they are in this moment and\nonce you've accepted them how can we go\nabout changing it how can we go about\nfixing\nit right so this is very important to\nunderstand very confusing and it's not\nyour\nfault very practically how do you get\ngood at this because this person was\ntalking about I over intellectualize\nsometimes and then I sometimes feel too\nmany emotions I don't know which one to\ndo so if you think about how do you\nlearn balance in anything my food is\novers salted my food is undersalted how\ndo I find the right amount of salt keep\ncooking so the good news is that you\ndon't have to figure it out your brain\nwill figure it out if you give it enough\nexperience so the other biggest problem\nthat we tend to have when we're trying\nto figure out I hyper and\nintellectualize and sometimes I feel\noverly emotional how do I balance these\ntwo things see you can't balance them\nhere intellectually theoretically the\nright way to find balance is through\nexperience literally how does a child\nlearn how to\nbalance do they sit there and think\nabout it no they fall like a 100 times\nso you have circuits in your brain that\nare focused on balancing\nall they need is more data and if you\nlook at people who are paralyzed between\nover intellectualization and over\nemotion what you usually see not always\nit's more complicated than this is a\nlack of\nexperience so when I look at people who\nare like over intellectualized in dating\nor overly emotional in dating what you\ntend to see is a lower amount of dating\nexperience so the good news is that your\nbrain has all these neuroplastic\ncircuits which will help you find\nbalance just keep collecting data keep\ncollecting data keep collecting data\nwhich is one of the reasons why people\nwill say put yourself out\nthere the reason putting yourself out\nthere works there's many potential\nreasons many reasons it doesn't work but\none of the reasons that works really\nwell is that the more you give your\nbrain data the more it will adapt to the\ncircumstance there's some problems with\nthat as well\nbut so how do you find the balance with\npractice just like balancing if you're a\ngymnast just like balancing if you're a\nkid just like balancing if you're a\nchef okay so\num that's all the time we have for today\nI know we ran a little bit long but\nthat's great that's why we do this we\nsort of budget to run a little bit\nlong uh thank youall all for coming\ntoday um we've got you know we're\nstreaming I think four days next week\nwe've got some awesome interviews lined\nup uh so we're interviewing I think\nwe're going to be talking to mkf on\nMonday um sapnap on Wednesday we have a\nmembers Q&A on Thursday and then Ali\nabdall on\nFriday um so definitely check that stuff\nout if yall are interested so mostly\ninterviews next week um and our trauma\nguide is live so it was built with a lot\nof love definitely check it\nout and uh yeah and you know keep it\ncoming chat so if you guys have other\nquestions follow-ups things like that I\nknow that sometimes s when youall ask\nquestions it feels like it's going into\nthe void um and to a sense it is because\nwe get you know we get like hundreds of\nquestions every stream and there's just\nno way we can get to them all at the\nsame time we do pay attention to most of\nthem and we slot A lot of them away and\nevery once in a while so just to give\nyou all an example we had a a membership\nstream yesterday about building a\nmeditative practice and we had 150\nquestions the good news is that the top\n15 we addressed in in like a 1-hour\nlecture so the good news is that we file\naway a lot of these questions we'll take\nthe highest yield most important\nquestions and we'll try to stitch\nsomething together that will answer many\nmany many many many questions and I\nthink part of the reason that we see a\nlot of growth in our community is\nbecause when we put together a lecture\nthis lecture that we did today is\nactually built off\nof like a dozen to 20 questions that\nhave\nasked and so we try to really put\ntogether questions and and deliver\ninformation in as most as efficient of a\nmanner as possible the guide is really\ngood at that that's why it takes so long\nto build right so if you look at like\nthe guide maybe 10 to 12 hours of\nlectures today we did three hours but\nthe guide\ntakes like 50 times more work and that's\nbecause we really want to Stitch things\ntogether to be incredibly efficient and\napplicable\nas opposed to Dr K ranting for 3 hours\nso thank you all very much for coming\ntoday um have a good weekend strong work\nevery"
