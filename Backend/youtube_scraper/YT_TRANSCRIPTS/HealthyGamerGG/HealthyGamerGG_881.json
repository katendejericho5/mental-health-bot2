    "transcript": "like sometimes people get better\nsometimes we help people\nsometimes we have an impact it may not\nbe enough\nI'm not saying it's a substitute for\nwhat they need but it's what we got to\ngive\nhello\noh yeah I just said to you the the\ntwitch tab I'm sorry that's okay okay\nnow it's uh it's all fine\nawesome welcome my friend\nuh thanks for having your stream first\nof all\nyou're welcome\nthanks for being here and making it\npossible\nyeah absolutely\nlove the attitude what do you go by my\nfriend\nuh my name is Julia okay and Julia who\ndo you want to be and what's holding you\nback\nit's gonna sound super basic but\nso I want to be someone who is actually\nable to make progress and achieve the\nthings they set out to do and what is\nholding me back is the fact that lately\nfor maybe the last year I have been\nstruggling to\nbasically like function in any\nmeaningful way and I also seem to not be\nable to\ncompartmentalize my emotions so like all\nthe areas of my life are bleeding into\neach other so I can barely focus on\nanything and I'm constantly mentally\nexhausted and it's not like I have not\nachieved significant things before like\nI've achieved a lot of significant stuff\nbefore but after so many cycles of just\nover compensating for my issues that\nlike seem like ADHD and PTSD but I have\nno formal diagnosis so I'm just throwing\nthat disclaimer out there\num you know and and then I I would burn\nout after over compensating for all of\nthat and and I no longer have the mental\nspark that I use to view when I would\nget motivated about anything anymore\nlike it's like I have a destination in\nmind and I have reasons why I want to\nget there but the key in the ignition\nwon't turn and I just can't start the\ncar and like I even if I start I can\nstay consistent because you know it's it\nfeels like I'm starting just so I can\nlike fail again and it's like the\nreasons that I have in my head a lot\nlike not even enough anymore to like do\nanything because I can barely get myself\nbeen most days\nyou know like maybe 30 minutes before\nwork like that's my record lately and\nI'm back to square one each morning and\nit's no way to live basically\nwow that sounds\nsorry no I mean I I'm just\nwhat I'm really noticing is that you're\ntrying really hard to get out of this\nsituation but almost the more you try\nthe more you run out of energy and the\nmore that you run out of energy the\nharder it is to get out of this\nsituation\nyeah and it's just like the the whole\nfeeling of like starting over it because\nI found like I find like a couple of\nstrategies that work for me but like\neach time I drop the ball because of you\nknow because I am someone who's like\nvery much like one of the struggles that\nI mentioned like that's the second one\nand it's no less important by the way\nbecause this is one of the things like I\nwould you know like get overwhelmed by\nemotions even my hands were shaking what\nthe hell uh right now so I would get\noverwhelmed by emotions or I would get\nlike burnt out because I'm essentially\nyou know if I'm using like strategies it\nfeels like I'm not actually being who I\nam despite not wanting to like identify\nwith the symptoms or like this\ndysfunction uh but but like when I'm\ntrying to be organized and function like\nI assume everybody else does whether you\nprobably don't it's like I I just you\nknow I get back into things after a\nwhile when things get critical enough\nbecause I'm motivated by the\nconsequences and not by Rewards you know\nand and then the methods that I know\nwork they just don't spark anything I\ndon't feel anything\nand it's\nscary you know because like yeah I want\nto achieve it's it's scary I'm sorry he\nsaid it's scary\nit's terrifying yeah because you don't\nfeel anything and without that spark\nlike you can't get like or at least it\ntakes much more effort like when you\ndon't feel that spark oh yeah like we're\ngonna do it I just don't have that\nanymore\nand it's is it okay to not have that\nspark\na victim I swear like but we were just\nthat mentally existed because you're\nconstantly like you're not able to like\nself-regulate which is like one of like\nthe whole thing that you're not able to\nlike\nyou know like just put things into boxes\nand when you're at work you don't think\nabout your like the issues in your\nrelationship and your issues with your\nfriends and your like mental health\nissues like you just focus at one thing\nat a time I can't do that it's\neverything at the same time all the time\nyou know it's causing issues with my\nsleep it's causing me issues with Focus\nit's causing me it's just with\nabsolutely everything and like when\nyou're someone like that like you get\nexhausted and you can't relate your\nemotions on one hand and you cannot\nregulate your behaviors or like you can\ndo it in like a forced artificial way\nusing certain methods but you're just\nessentially forcing yourself into a mold\nand you get even more exhausted and when\nyou don't have that spark you know it's\njust like you're\nlike basically forcing yourself because\nit doesn't come naturally to you and\nwhen you feel that sparse so like for\nexample I had to like apply for for a\njob and I had to do like a lot of things\nfor that and it like something in me was\njust like yeah we're gonna do it and I\nspent my entire weekend on and off like\njust focusing on that and it didn't take\nlike a ton of effort because it felt\nlike something hey like you know we're\ngonna get that done it just came\nnaturally to me but like chores in like\nnormal everyday life admin stuff is what\nI call it like cooking cleaning like\neven hygiene you know was really hard\nfor me up until like like maybe one\nmonth ago like it was really bad and\nstarted to seem like I was in some sort\nof like depression again not diagnosed\nbut it looked like that you know I want\nto achieve that like the big ticket\nthings but I don't have the the like the\nthe routines I can't form habits and if\nyou don't have the the basic stuff Julia\nI'm gonna jump in for a second\nyeah I'm sorry no that's okay so let me\nask you a question how do you decide\nwhat to set out to achieve\noh well okay I'm loading\nit's probably cool to like hear me be\nsilent for it\nthat's what I'm saying like when I when\nI say my mind doesn't stop it doesn't\nstop so like I don't really I guess I\ndon't really decide it just like comes\nlike through experience like I see that\nI'm not satisfied with myself in like\none area or another area of my life and\nI decide hey like what I what I want to\ndo instead so maybe by comparison where\nam I and where would I want to be and\nalso through it's like I've been there\nin this situation where I am in this\nsituation right now and I would rather\nbe in another type of situation right so\nthat is kind of like I just go through\nlife winging it yeah seriously almost no\nplanning yeah so I think I think let me\njust share with you so first of all I'm\nso happy that you're sharing all this\nstuff\na couple of things to think about one is\nthat I get the sense that so let me put\nit this way sometimes in life\nwherein we have to put out fires\nand other times at life we try to\nrebuild what's burnt down\ndoes that make sense\nyeah what I get the sense of is that\nyou're trying to do both at the same\ntime\nyou've got a house on fire\nyou're trying to build it and put out\nthe fire at the same time\ndoes that resonate with you at all\nyeah it does like 50 and it's like we're\nnot like when I one of the first things\nthat I said was like I feel like every\nmorning I I wake up and like I'm a\nsquare one and it feels like I'm\nconstantly trying to I am building\nsomething a bit burns down because I\ncannot be consistent to save my life and\nit's yeah so here's like starting over\nand over and over again yeah so here's\nwhat's going on I think you're spending\na lot of energy building one room\nwhile the room next door is on fire so\nwhen you go to bed at night the fire\njust spreads to the work that you put in\nand then you wake up the next morning\nand it's burnt down\nso practically\nso practically I think there are a\ncouple of interesting things here\nbecause what I'm hearing you say is that\nyou want to achieve the things that you\nset out to achieve but I think what\nwe're hearing is that you'll set goals\nfor yourself that you don't have the\nfuel to reach\nright you wake up on a particular day\nand you're like I want to be able to do\nthis\nbut there is I'm not hearing an\nappreciation and there's a good reason\nfor this so I'm not blaming you for this\nI'm not hearing an appreciation for\nhow Running on Empty you are\nand so sometimes like what I also heard\nyou say that this has been going on for\nabout a year\nso like this is where what I kind of say\nis that like I know it sounds kind of\nweird but don't worry about achieving\nstuff worry about stabilizing\nright so sometimes like if I'm trying to\nsail from one part of the world to\nanother part of the world\nand there's a hole in my boat\nmy focus should not be in like\nopening my sales and trying to make as\nmuch progress as I can it should be in\nfixing the hole bailing the water and\ngetting my ship ready to sail\nwhat I'm sort of hearing from you is\nthat there's a lot of stuff that's\noverwhelming you right now you continue\nto set goals for yourself as you set\nthose goals for yourself it's hard to\nachieve them you may make some progress\nbut because all of these other\ndimensions of your life emotional\ndysregulation other kinds of things are\nlike getting in the way you can't\nconsistently invest energy towards\nprogress\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah\nI'm thinking\nI'm thinking about that I had to like\ntake a minute so like this this current\ncycle has been going on for a year but\nit's been that way for years like I'm 23\nit's going to be 24. and this has been\ngoing on for like\nmaybe since I can't remember I don't\nknow ever since I was able to like set\ngoals for myself so I only I think I\nonly got through school because I guess\nsort of intelligent\nand it's like really frustrating because\nit feels like one of the other colors\nhad that and he had idiot well so\num like you feel like it should be easy\nand like it's\nfrustrating to no end because you can't\nget through the basic stuff like so what\nI was trying to say to start with is is\nthat you know is this cycle every year\nmultiple times\nyou you over compensate you burn out you\novercompensate you out and you're stuck\nwith the same line\nlike you don't always set new goals for\nyourself all the time you're stuck on a\nset of goals that you have not been able\nto achieve maybe for years because\nthere's never enough energy yep so Julia\nso let me ask you something\nover compensate and burnout over\ncompensate and burn out right\nwhy can't you just compensate why do you\nhave to overcompensate\nuh yeah because balance is hard\nwhat makes balance hard balance is\nreally hard what makes it hard well\nnot to trauma dump but like just just my\nupbringing like I I never had any sense\nof like uh like a stable adult person\nthat I could just watch their behavior\nhow they just operate in their normal\nday life\nand like just kind of like learn through\nimitation because like adults in my life\nare just not great role models some of\nthem were abusive that sucks so like not\njust Ramadan not to say oh like for me\nit's just background but no I think it's\nimportant background thank you for\nsharing\nyeah so so as we kind of think about it\nso like a couple things pop into my mind\nthe first is that Julie you've mentioned\nthree potential diagnoses\nyou've also mentioned like difficulty\nregulating emotions so this is\nabsolutely a situation where I would\nrecommend a clinical evaluation I don't\nknow how possible that is or accessible\nthat is for you\nbut this this is exactly why like so\nwhat I've sort of found as a\npsychiatrist is that sometimes people\nwill try to put their lives together\nand just because you're putting your\nlives together doesn't mean that mental\nillness is responsible but what I can\nguarantee you is that if mental illness\nis at play it's going to be a hell of a\nlot harder to try to put your life\ntogether if it's untreated\nwhat do you think about that\nsorry\nyou lost me at two sentences\nyeah yeah\nso what I was saying is that you've\nmentioned three diagnoses it sounds like\nyou haven't been formally diagnosed but\nyou've mentioned three potential\ndiagnoses\nand one of the things that I'm noticing\nthat you're trying to put your life\ntogether right\none of the things that can really make\nit hard to put your life together is if\nthere's an untreated ADHD or depression\nor PTSD\nso this is where I'd ask like are you I\nmean what do you think about clinical\nevaluation getting into treatment Etc\nI mean ah well I also struggled with\nanorexia and I I had the most terrible\nexperience so so basically I'm from\nsomewhere in Eastern Europe and the\nMetro Healthcare System here is\nhorrible so like I tried to get help for\nlike unrelated things like I said on\nanorexia\num it went horribly wrong\nand I was not really like trying to put\nmyself through this because mental\nhealth professionals here tend to leave\nyou worse off than you went in and it's\nlike I trust myself to like kind of\nstabilize\nstabilize like not fix myself 100\nbecause maybe that's not even possible\nbut like just stabilize without having\nto\nessentially like just bury your whole\nlike\nlike assortment of problems to somebody\nonly to be treated in a way that leaves\nyou worse off and like more mentally\nstabilized so like I'm not here to see\ndiagnosis I'm just here like for a\ncouple of tips and\nI understand that this is not substitute\nfor yeah yeah yeah no so so I I mean\nthat that's I I so thank you for sharing\nwhat your experience with mental health\ntreatment is can you just help me\nunderstand like do you mind if I ask you\none or two questions about your\ntreatment experience\noh yeah okay so like I you know I've\nheard of\npoor mental health professionals in\nother parts of the world I mean we have\nsome here in the United States as well\nbut I'm curious like what did they do\nthat let LED you worse left you worse\noff than when you started\n[Music]\npsychologists if I can even call her\nthat was uh sneering and like just\nreally disrespectful the whole time and\nthen she told me like quote unquote\num don't even dare think you're strong\nbecause if you're really strong you\nwould not need\nother people and I was like wait when\ndid I even say and the other ones were\njust at the psych ward like the state\nfunded psychord were like just dig these\npills don't research them don't read\nanything about them they were also prone\nto like like making our products and\njust yelling at you for no reason so oh\nit's not impatient but yeah that was\nreally messed up and then one of them\ndidn't really do anything just just\nI\nuh and they decided that oh yeah you're\ncontrolling your anorexia good enough so\nyou're bipolar take these pills and\nthese pills made me suicidal I have not\nbeen suicidal or self-harmed I'm sorry\nif I'm triggering anybody with all this\ntalk but ever since I quit these meds of\ncourse like not cold turkey because that\nwould have been even worse but I put\nthem and I felt better and I just was\nlike okay I need to\npull myself together and get over my\ndisorder with like this report of\nfriends like mostly on my own research\nand I'm somebody who researches a lot so\nI think the only reason why I'm even\nhere and talking to you and like even\nalive is because I'm\nyou know\nI guess resourceful\nand like sort of intelligent so so I\nhave to rely on others so he let me let\nme share can I share with you like what\nI'm kind of hearing from you and and how\nI understand your situation\nokay so I think so it sounds like you've\ngot a lot of stuff going on at the same\ntime\nand like I I don't know how to say this\nbut it just sounds like you're just\noverwhelmed like like I think you've\nshared with us what it's like to be\nin your head and like living a day in\nyour life which is like a cycle of\ndesperate digging down for energy making\nsome small amount of progress pushing\neverything else away and then being back\nto square one tomorrow\nand then you go through that same cycle\nover and over again and every time you\ngo through that cycle you get a little\nbit more burnt out a little bit more\nburnt out it's harder to find energy\nharder to find energy harder to find\nenergy but then what's the alternative\nyou got to do something\nand so in these kinds of situations like\nI I think that\nstabilization is more important than\nprogress what do you think\nso the shame like every year on my\nbirthday\nsignificant date you're like oh like\nyeah still haven't achieved this and\nthat it's like I completely understand\nbut like I don't really know like how\nlike how do we even like how do we even\nstart like one thing I mean you start\nyou start by stopping yeah\noh\ncool right because here's the thing\nevery year that goes by\nas you haven't achieved your goals you\nfeel ashamed right what does the shame\ndo to your energy what does it do by\nyour to your thought process it's\nanother thing that eats away at your\nenergy\nand so as you feel more ashamed of\nyourself you have to catch up more so\nyou set a more ambitious goal\nas you fail in that goal you feel worse\nabout yourself and the cycle continues\nover and over and over again\nand that's what we're hearing from you\nis that you're stuck in this cycle and\nif we're stuck in a particular cycle the\nsimplest way to get out of it is to stop\ndoing what we've been doing\nnow that's easier said than done but\nwhat I'm what I'm getting what I'm\ngetting just as I listen to you\nmy reaction is slow down\nbreathe\nyou don't have to fix everything today\nhow does that sound to you\nso if there's like good things that that\nI have like done before like I I like\nthe weirdest thing is that I have like\nthis proverbial metaphorical toolbox\nthat there are things in there that work\nbut when I try to come back to them\nactual things like setting smaller goals\nexercising for the sake of exercising\nbecause I told myself last year and I\nmanaged to exercise for like six seven\nmonths consistently yeah work out for\nlike the discipline work out for the\nmental health benefits not for looking a\ncertain way because you have a freaking\nhistory freaking Eating Disorders it\nworked but now like I own my toolbox and\nI look at the same things\nthat weren't for me the same tools and I\nlike I said I just don't feel anything\nso I think I will kind of like just have\nto like force myself to like restart the\nthe good things and just like send this\nlike tiny little goals Julia maybe try\nto find what are you hearing me say\nsorry\nwhat are you hearing me say\nokay what else and stop trying to over\nyou can see it and like do less instead\nof more\nokay\nare you\nyeah are you able to be patient with\nyourself\nnope not yet why not yet are you patient\nwith yourself not yet\nthat's funny right I mean because you're\nso what makes it hard for you to be\npatient with yourself\num\nI mean I'm like to be honest I'm trying\nto not make shop more hostile towards me\nbecause are you reading chat I would\ndefinitely not be reading chat right now\nI would absolutely ignore what Chad says\nyeah\num I'm kind of a people pleaser like\nfirst of all\nso what makes it hard for you to be\npatient with yourself\num I am bringing again in the way that\nlike I grew up like generally around\npeers and stuff like\num like your parents are supposed to be\nthe ones that you know\nmodel the way that you know you you want\nto get like when you grow up in the way\nyou want to treat yourself so yeah okay\nenough\nso Julia here's my two recommendations\nwhich I think may be a little bit\nunsatisfying to you and if they are\nplease let me know and maybe we can talk\nabout that for a minute the first is I\nwant you to just focus on one thing\nwhich is patience with yourself\njust patience\nyou don't have to be perfect by your\nnext birthday you don't have to have\neverything solved by your next birthday\nwhat you're telling me is that you grew\nup in a situation where a lot of the\nstuff that\npeople who are living healthy happy\nlives are given or taught you were not\ngiven the opportunity it wasn't handed\nto you on a silver platter you've had to\nfigure everything out on your own and\nwhat that means is that you can't\ncompare yourself to someone who was\nstarting with like a full tank of gas\nand being taught everything\nso you've got to give yourself time\nto get better and I'm confident actually\nthat you will because you've told me\nthat while the cycle repeats well we're\nalso hearing that there are periods of\ntime where there are tools in your\ntoolkit which you've been able to apply\nfor seven months at a time\nthat you do make progress\nand I think the key thing is that the\nmore you get overwhelmed the more you\ntry to get out of your situation the\nmore impatient you become that actually\nworsens the whole cycle\nso the first thing is patience\nsecond thing is I understand you've had\nbad experiences with mental health\ntreatment\nI don't know what else to say but like\nlet's assume that this was what wasn't\nmental health let's say that you came in\nhere and you said I have a diagnosis of\ncancer I've seen cancer doctors before\nand they didn't really do a good job\nif the problem that you have is cancer\nthe fact that there isn't good cancer\ntreatment doesn't change the fact that\nyou need cancer treatment does that make\nsense\nthe goal should still be finding good\ncancer treatment\ndoes that agree or disagree\nyeah\nnow I'm not saying that just because\nthat's the goal that that's even\npossible for you because I have no idea\nlike you're the one who's been a patient\nin the Eastern European Healthcare\nSystem and if it sucks it sucks I don't\nknow what to say like you know that's\nthe kind of thing but like the right\nanswer doesn't change just because it's\nhard or even impossible to find that's a\ntruth of Medicine\nyou know if you if you are in a car\naccident and someone needs a blood\ntransfusion but there's no ambulance\nnearby that can give you a blood\ntransfusion that doesn't change what the\nperson needs does that make sense\nyeah and what I'm hearing is that you\nwere treated very very judgmentally or\npeople were very very judgmental towards\nyou maybe relating to your anorexia\ndiagnosis but I'd hope that there are\ngood mental health professionals in\nevery corner of the world I'm not saying\nthey're common\nbut I mean I've worked I don't know\nwhere you are from Eastern Europe we\ndon't need to go into those details but\nI've I've talked to mental health\nprofessionals from countries that have\non average very poor mental health\nprofessionals\nand there are good people out there\nso this is where I think we've just got\na very tricky situation because if you\nassume that all the mental health\ntreatment is bad I'm not saying that's a\nbad assumption you may be correct you\nknow more about it than I do what I'm\nsaying is that if you're wrong that's a\ndevastating assumption to make\nbecause if we're talking about\na mood disorder\nPTSD or ADHD and you're like girl like\nyou have a ton of [ __ ] to deal with if\nyou've got untreated mental illness on\ntop of that that's going to be so hard\nso I I don't know what you know Mental\nHealth Care light is like in Eastern\nEurope it's a huge problem that we see\nin this community\nbecause the problem is that like\nhalf the world has very crappy mental\nhealth treatment and we kind of do what\nwe can but but you know I'm happy to\ngive you tips\npatience meditation\nbut I don't think that a very complex\nlike I don't think that there's like a\ncomplex thing here which if we unravel\nwe'll fix all your problems I think in\nyour case Julie it's slow and steady\nwins the race\nand I think as best as you can like try\nto seek mental health treatment maybe\neven for stuff like emotional\ndysregulation or see if there's ADHD\ntreatment or things like that because\nsometimes in the case of something like\nADHD if they're like here take these\npills adios that can actually be okay\neven in the case of mood disorders you\nknow some people like many people here\nin the U.S will treat mood disorders and\nADHD with just psychopharm they'll just\ntake medication for it and it'll like\nhelp some\nand what I'm saying is that you're in a\nsituation where you can use any\nadvantage you can get your hands on\nbecause it sounds like your situation is\nnot\neasy at all\nand so I'd encourage you to as best as\nyou can continue to explore that\nbecause every year that goes by as you\nknow more and more people get trained\nMental Health Care is improving globally\nin developing countries and across the\nworld so even if your experience was\nlike this two years ago maybe it may not\nbe like that now\nwhat do you think\nyeah like the the fact that like I just\nyou know had like a bad experience with\nmental health professionals in my area\nyou know because I'm from like a small\ntown and stuff like that yeah maybe not\nall of them are like that it's just that\nyou know I I feel like the the biggest\nproblem that I have is like the ADHD or\nPTSD like symptoms that I have because\nI've read a lot about there being an\noverlap so I don't really know which one\nis but if if and and this like this\nperspective terrifies me that if I do\nhave adult ADHD in my country they don't\nrecognize it and you cannot legally be\nprescribed medication for it if you were\nover 18 where when uh they found out\nthat you have ADHD so like that's just\nuh the life ahead of me is like me\nhaving to cope with a lot of it but at\nthe same time it's not that terrifying\nbecause I know that I might be able to\ndo it it's just gonna be more like\ndifficult but I\nI while waiting for like to to go like\non call I actually did like Google some\nyou know information about mental health\nprofessionals and stuff like that\nbecause like the thought popped into my\nhead like maybe I should give it a\nchance against Julian yeah I mean you\nseem you seem like a very smart person\nwho does their homework and does\neverything within your power to try to\nget a handle on your life and that I\nthink is ultimately going to be like the\nbest sign of Hope for you and what I'm\nhearing is that if you've done a lot of\nGoogling and you think that this could\nbe an issue then I think that like like\nI don't know how to say like there's no\nlike that's what you should address\nright like if you figured out that maybe\nthere's ADHD maybe there's PTSD and\nthere could be all kinds of other things\nlike you say like okay there are these\nproblems with diagnosis and medication\nand whatnot which is fine but the whole\npoint is that you don't know because\nthere's a lot of overlap so that's a\nquestion you should answer if it turns\nout that you can't get medication or\ntreatment for it then then that sucks\nbut at least you know and then we we're\nsure that door is closed right now what\nI'm hearing that concerns me is that\nyou're choosing not to explore whether\nthe door is closed or not in the first\nplace and if you go through\nyou could get a lot better now I'm not\nfaulting you for that choice because I\nthink that there's a damn good reason\nyou're not touching that which is that\nit sounds like mental health treatment\nhas actually made things worse for you\nin the past which is awful but it\ntotally makes sense why you would be\nreluctant to engage with it again\nbut that's where it's like I'd say like\nroll the dice if you had you know and it\nsounds like it also wasn't just one\nperson right you had a team of people\nwho were all pretty bad so I would just\nsay try again\nand you know because I I honestly think\nlike based on everything that you're\nkind of saying if you think you have a\nmental health diagnosis this just\ndoesn't go for you this is anyone out\nthere who's listening if you all are\nconcerned that you all have a diagnosis\nthe right move is to get at least an\nevaluation\nand then figure out what treatment feels\nright for you and then the other thing\nis patience\nright you're not like if you weren't\ntaught these things by your parents if\nyou didn't have a supportive family if\nyou experienced a lot of trauma growing\nup you just it's gonna take your time\nto get to where you need to go\nand the more that you try to set\nambitious goals for yourself\nand the more that you dig deep without a\nsolid foundation of moving forward the\nmore you're going to end up spinning\nyour wheels and sort of wasting your\nenergy\nany last thoughts or questions before we\nwrap up for the day\ninformation basically but\nI actually never thought about about the\npatience bits like it's all about doing\ndoing doing it to me like yeah this is\nalways more passive thing and I don't\nlike being passed by I guess because\nyeah Julie but let me ask you how is\ndoing doing doing working out for you\nit's not\nso stop doing\nyeah I'm loading so good\nperfect\nyou're a natural you have to think about\nyeah good think about it yeah you may\nshut up for more than like in like a\nminute you're great at what you do\nI'm sorry I I I didn't catch that yeah\nI yeah I said that uh you managed to\nmake me shut up for like more than a\nminute so like automatically that makes\nyou just great because like Nothing\nStops usually Nothing Stops my brain so\nthat's right yeah and when your brain is\nso here's the thing the brain is just\nlike any other organ\nright so when your heart\nis tachycardic when you're beating at\n150 beats per minute for a while it\nstarts [ __ ] up\nand your brain when it's going 150\nthoughts a minute will start screwing up\nso you just need to slow it down\nJulia I really really hope that stuff\ngets better for you\nyou seem like an amazing person who has\na lot to offer the world\nand like\nI think the saddest thing is that\nyour inability to share that actually is\nnot very much your fault and what I'm\nreally hearing is that you have in a\nsense very little control over like\nyou know a lot of the dimensions of your\nlife but as best as you can for these\none or two things\ntry to do what you can because we can't\nfix the Eastern European health care\nSystem\nyou know there's so much stuff here\nthat's out of your control but cut\nyourself some slack be patient with\nyourself you don't need to be perfect\nyesterday\nthe loading sorry because good yeah I've\nbeen trying to like be better at\nlistening to people so good right so\nthat's like awkward silences I I wasn't\nfeeling awkward I mean I I was okay with\nit so I I'm I'm glad you're doing what\nyou're doing\ncool\num good luck to you so like thanks\nthank you very much like\nyeah\nokay\num\ndon't give up on yourself\nlikewise don't give up on yourself\nnumber one and number two\ndon't expect you to have fixed it\ntomorrow\nokay\nyou'll get there\njust be patient with yourself\ngood luck to you Julia I wish you all\nthe best\nto you too bye bye\nyeah so that's tough\num I think we're done for the day I\nthink we had four people but\nI think uh yeah\nI mean so we're seeing this front and\ncenter\nwhere I have a feeling that Julia's life\nwould have been so different\nif when she got into Mental Health Care\nlike she had good mental health care\nso like there are so many people in our\ncommunity that\ntheir lives would be so different if\njust one thing was\nhad changed\nyou know just like one thing like Alters\nthe whole course of your life\nand then we sort of end up in a\nsituation that we feel responsible for\nbecause like who can actually do\nsomething about my life it has to be me\nright it has to be me\nand so as you accept that and as you say\nokay I'm the one who has to fix my life\nsomething subtle can happen which is\nthat you accept responsibility for the\nstate of your life\nif I'm the one who has to fix it it has\nto be me that got here\nand that's just not true\nthe truth is that you don't control most\nof what is determined about your life\nyou don't get to choose when you were\nborn you don't get to choose where you\nwere born you don't get to choose who\nyour parents are you don't get to choose\nwhether you had cerebral palsy at Birth\nyou don't get to choose whether you have\na high IQ or a low IQ\nyou don't get to choose whether your\nparents taught you how to study did they\nsit down with you and go over stuff did\nthey force you to sit down and learn how\nto do your multiplication tables\nthe truth is so much of our life\nwe are not responsible for\nand yet\nwe're the\nonly reliable agents to fix it\nand that's just like unfair\nbut it's how it is\nand so are you responsible for moving\nyour life in the direction that you want\nit absolutely\nis it your fault that it's such a [ __ ]\nshow in the first place hopefully not\nnow here's the big caveat\nthe people who accept too much\nresponsibility for their life that is\nunfair are the ones that need to\ndisplace it on the flip side and I think\nfor whatever reason we don't really\nattract these kinds of people in our\ncommunity or maybe we screen them out\nthe flip side is also true where there\nare people who don't accept\nresponsibility for their life in fact\nthey shunt responsibility away from\nthemselves and those are the ones that\nparadoxically screw up their life and\nthey blame the world\nright oh it's like the world is an evil\nplace\nwhen it turns out that they're actually\nthe ones that are responsible so both\nsides are kind of equally correct that\nthere there's a discrepancy between\nindividual responsibility and what the\nworld contributes and the funny thing is\nin both cases you've got to move in the\nopposite direction\nI just get the sense that in our\ncommunity we have people who adopt more\nresponsibility than is there do\nit's tough I I don't know what to do\nabout lack of Mental Health Care like\nproper mental health treatment in parts\nof the world like and this is both the\nawesome thing and\nthe awful thing about the work that we\ndo\nso the cool thing\nis that we're at least reaching those\npeople and offering something\nthe sad thing is that it's not nearly\nenough and it's not what they need\nso we're going to do what we can and\nwe're limited and that's\nokay in a sense it's not it's not really\nokay but it's the most that we can do\nwhich is like how life works\nis the necessity for something doesn't\nequate the possibility of something\nbut you try what you can\nright we're gonna do what we can\nand like I don't know what to say but\nthat's As Good As It Gets\nin terms of the work that we do we're\ngoing to do what we can in terms of what\nI try to do every day and even in terms\nof your life you can't fix the problems\nall you can do is do what you can\nand fingers crossed\nif you keep doing that hopefully things\nwill start to get better\nand that I feel really confident in\nbecause even if we can't fix stuff I'm\npretty sure we're making the world a\nslightly better place\nright we see that\nlike sometimes people get better\nsometimes we help people\nsometimes we have an impact it may not\nbe enough\nI'm not saying it's a substitute for\nwhat they need but it's what we got to\ngive\nand even in terms of your own life it\nmay not be enough but give what you can\nto yourself\ngive what you've got to yourself\nit's not about what you need it's about\nwhat you can offer\nbecause that's the most that you can do\nand the cool thing is once you accept\nthat and once you give fully what you\nhave to offer you can be at peace with\nit whether it's enough or not enough is\nnot mind to control\nbut I can go to bed at peace with myself\nbecause I gave what I could"
