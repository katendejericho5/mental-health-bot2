    "transcript": "that shame is going to interfere with\nthat behavior an understanding of that\nin the present moment what is the shame\ndictating in my mind what is it telling\nme to do what is it not telling me to do\nas those emotions arise in your mind\nthat creates resistance to action i\nstruggle with shame how will coaching\nhelp hi using a throwaway because other\npeople know my real account i've been in\nthe discord for a while and attended an\nask a coach event on shame that was\ninteresting i also watched a dr k video\non shame and i liked the explanation of\nhow\nshame is the gap between my current self\nand my ideal self\nhe also mentioned that coaching can help\nwith this but i don't understand how\ntalking to another person will reduce\nthe gap it doesn't make any sense in my\nhead it just feels like i will never\nlive up to my full potential also is\nthis the right place and time for this\nquestion\nokay\nlet's talk about\nshame\nso the first thing that we're going to\ndo is talk a little bit about what shame\nis\nso if i had to encapsulate it i would\nsay that shame is the gap between where\nyou are and where you ideally should be\nso there's like an ideal self that we\nall have in our mind right i'm someone\nwho works out i'm someone who eats\nhealthy i'm someone who wakes up on time\ni'm someone who doesn't waste all my\nweekends in front of a screen and doom\nscrolling\nthere's this person that we know we can\nbe right because technically like i have\nthe power to do that\nso oftentimes the ideal self that i'm\ntalking about is not like a fictitious\nself it's not like i can fly to the moon\nor i can you know fly to the sun like\nthe ideal self that we have is are all\nthe things that we know we can do\nand oftentimes those are the things that\nwe have done in the past right because\nthere have been weekends where i've\nstayed completely away from my phone\nthere have been times where i've woken\nup early and started studying and gotten\nahead in a class i have gotten an a on a\ntest\nso nowhere capable of it and there's\nthis ideal self\nthat we build for which is all the\nthings that we've done in the past which\nif we put them all together\nwe have this this potential to be this\nversion of ourself\nthere's that person over there\nand then there's where i am\nand the gap between these two things is\nwhere shame lives\nright because i'm not living up to my\npotential\nso now the question is if if this is\ntrue like what do we do about that right\nhow do we approach this problem\nbecause the challenge with shame is that\nonce again if i'm ashamed of myself\nand i try to do something\nsometimes that shame can really\ncreate problems for me\nso let's say i wake up\non a saturday morning and i end up\nstudying for four hours\nif i'm carrying that shame with myself\nsomething's really subtle can happen\ninstead of being proud of my achievement\ni can beat myself up for it i can say oh\nmy god i should have been doing this all\nalong\noh my god why did i only study for four\nhours i really should have done eight\nright i should have been doing this all\nalong and i'll even be resentful because\nhere's the problem with the shame gap\nhere's the ideal self here's where i am\neven if we do this\nwe still fall short of our goal\nso something really bizarre happens\nwhere progress\nisn't enough\nprogress doesn't actually lead to\npositive reinforcement all progress does\nis make it clear how much more i have to\ngo\nand so even though i'm moving in the\nright direction i don't receive positive\nreinforcement from it and that's because\nof the shame that i carry with me\nnow some people may be wondering a\nlittle bit because this person was\nasking about coaching\nright so\nbecause it's a good point that the\nperson brings up\nwhich is that like if i carry shame i\ndon't understand how talking to a\ndifferent person\nwill fix this problem because this is\nwhat i'm capable of and if i'm over here\ntalking about how i'm over here doesn't\nactually move me towards my goal\nright like it doesn't actually move me\ntowards my goal\nso here are a couple of things to\nunderstand\nthe first is that when i have an ideal\nself and i literally make progress\nthis is not a positive reinforcer right\nbecause i have this gap left the gap is\nstill there so what do i need to do i\nneed to find some way to get rid of this\nthing\nbecause if i can start over here and i\nmove this far\nthen this is progress this is like hey i\naccomplished something today and\ntomorrow i can do this and tomorrow i\ncan do this and tomorrow i can do this\nso this is where when we think a little\nbit about how coaching works coaches are\ngoing to help you all do a couple of\nthings the first is to understand where\nthe idealistic expectation came from\nbecause as long as that idealistic\nexpectation is there\nit's going to be so hard to live up to\nit\nright and that idealistic expectation is\nbuilt up from all of these different\nexperiences that leave an emotional\nimpact\nwhen i get a b and i could have gotten\nan a that hurts and i feel a little bit\nashamed of myself\nright when my older brother or sister\nthey got a 4.0 but i only got a 3.2\nand when my parents compared me to the\nolder child\nthat makes me feel ashamed or even more\ndevastating than that when i used to get\na 4.0 when i was a gifted kid and i was\nin the honors program\nand i got a scholarship to go to college\nbecause i was in the top 10 in my class\nand now\ni'm struggling\nso the ideal self as long as that\nexists it's going to be hard to sort of\nfix that shame gap\nso what what do we how do we approach\nthat in coaching we start by\nunderstanding that that ideal self is\nbuilt up from a series of fantasies and\nas you go through past experiences of\nyour life and you start to realize where\ndoes that ideal self come from and you\nstart to unpack it\nyou begin to realize that some of the\nways that you were judging yourself were\nactually unfair\nright so like maybe you had adhd and\nyour older sibling didn't\nyou start to realize that because you\nwere so intelligent you never developed\na good study habit so you have the\nclassic pattern of a gifted kid\nwhich is\nnumber one\nstraight to number 15. right you you're\ndoing fine you're doing fine you're\ndoing fine you hit a wall and then you\ngo straight to like non-functional\nbecause now your iq can't keep up\nit's not sufficient and you haven't\nbuilt the appropriate skills so as you\nwork with a coach like this is what they\ntry to do is try to help you reframe\nthings to understand why things happened\nand once you understand why things\nhappen hopefully you can be a little bit\nmore non-judgmental towards yourself\nand that's where like how do i learn how\nto be non-judgmental the way that you\nlearn how to be non-judgmental is\nsomeone else\ntreats you non-judgmentally\nso this is also something really simple\nto understand\nwhere does the negative self-talk in\nyour head come from it comes from the\noutside that's where it starts\nright so when you have kids\nthat are brow beaten by parents\nnagged by parents always making\ncomparisons to your older brighter\nstronger faster more charismatic sibling\nwhen they always make those comparisons\nyou learn that\nin the same way that you learn slang and\nyou learn the language that you speak at\nhome\nyou learn though that kind of self-talk\nbecause other people speak to you that\nway so if you look at some of these\nrelationships like therapy or coaching\nor even intimate friendships intimate\nromantic partners\nas people start treating you different\nmentors mentees as people start treating\nyou non-judgmentally you will learn how\nto look at yourself non-judgmentally and\nby going through yourself your life\nhistorically and sort of recognizing\nhow your shame built up over time as we\nstart to rewrite that history\nreinterpret those events the shame will\nstart to decrease or sorry the\nidealistic self will start to decrease\nas the idealistic self starts to\ndecrease the shame decreases with it\nbecause it's the gap between these two\nthings\nthe next thing is that coaching is\nreally outcome not outcome or oriented\nbut it's like action oriented it's not\njust about fixing shame if your primary\nconcerns are clinical in nature or it's\njust to deal with emotions\ni would say like therapy may be more\nappropriate what coaching is really\nabout is the application of that\ninternal work towards external things\nthat's what i really think coaching is\nspecialized for\nso now the question is\nif you want to apply for a job if you\nwant to apply for a promotion if you\nwant to ask someone out that shame is\ngoing to interfere with that behavior an\nunderstanding of that in the present\nmoment what is the shame dictating in my\nmind what is it telling me to do what is\nit not telling me to do as those\nemotions arise in your mind that creates\nresistance to action as we have\nresistance to action it becomes hard to\nact\nand so we feel paralyzed\nwe start to feel tired we start to feel\ndirectionless etc\nso the the key thing about coaching is\nit also has a very present focus okay\nwhat are your goals and what gets in the\nway how does shame interfere with it as\nwe start to understand those things and\nas we start to emotionally decompress\nwhatever the res whatever fuels your\nresistance then the resistance gets\nlower and it's actually easier to act\nand so you can't\nit's not sort of you can sort of fix the\nshame but then it's also about how the\nshame interferes in your life\nand it's about targeting that particular\ninteraction and once we can target the\nshame as it interferes in the other\nparts of your life as we reduce that\nthen hopefully your life starts to move\nin the right direction\nso we have an irb approved study that's\nrunning right now\nwe presented a study that had 1300\nparticipants at the american psychiatric\nassociation in our coaching program\nso what we've found now is that people\nwho are in coaching for four months or\nfive months\nsee a 58 increase\nin their sense of life purpose\nso people come in\ndirectionless\n58 increase\nin life purpose\nwe see 25 to 35 reductions in depression\nand anxiety now this is not a clinical\nintervention so how could it possibly\nreduce depression or anxiety\nand it turns out that as you start\nbuilding a life as you start finding\npurpose\nand you start moving forward in a\npositive direction the negative emotions\nstart to improve\nso we're not there to treat depression\nor anxiety let me make this very clear\nwe're there to help you build life and\nas you build a life\nthe negative emotions start to get\nbetter and that's a statistically\nsignificant finding\nso how does coaching help with shame\nthat's how i lay it out\nright it's not just about fixing the\nshame it's about an application\nof understanding how shame affects your\nbehaviors understanding how shame\naffects your mind it's about digging\ninto those things and reframing them\ntrying to understand where this shame\ncame from\nit's even about decompressing the\nemotion in the moment so that you can\ntake the actions that you want to so\nthat resistance is not too much to deal\nwith\nand hopefully that'll help\nright your mileage may vary but at this\npoint we feel really confident based on\nirb approved studies and initial\noutcomes data that these are pretty\nconsistent findings\nand that if you really want to put\ntogether your life you have to have a\nsense of purpose and once you have that\nnorth star\nthen other problems become\neasier to deal with\nright where there's a will there's a way\nwhere there's a goal that you're kind of\nmoving towards on a daily basis it makes\nall the other things kind of fall into\nplace and becomes easier to tackle and\nthat's what we really try to do at hg\ncoaching\nquestions\noh a lot of good questions okay\nso how's life purpose measured great\nquestion so we measure uh\nlife purpose based on i think an nih\npatient recorded uh promise\nscale\nso the national institutes of health in\nthe united states\ndeveloped standardized public domain\nscales\nso this is developed by the nih they\nsaid this is the scale that we're going\nto use it's not owned by anyone it's not\nused for a particular purpose so some\nscales for example are developed by\npharmaceutical companies\nnews flash sometimes when a pharma\ncompany develops a scale it is developed\nin a particular way to be optimized for\ntheir medications so this is developed\nby the nih and it's kind of like the\ngold standard at least in my opinion of\nscales because there's no bias in it so\nwe use standardized outcome reporting\nmeasures\nhow do you estimate the percent of\ndepression reduction a great question so\nthat's a subjective report also by a\npromise scale\nso there's like a standardized scale\nthat we can use to measure how depressed\nsomeone is\nthese are scientifically validated\ndoes longitudinal prove to be more\neffective\ngreat question topless orange up to a\npoint is what i would say\nso some people get a lot of benefit in a\nshort amount of time some people get\nmore benefit over longer periods of time\nbut it does appear that overall the\nlonger you're with it the more it helps\nthere are a couple of other very\nimportant caveats to that data one is\nthat sometimes people accomplish a lot\nin a short time and then they're done\nso we actually don't have long-term data\non\nlike a lot of success stories so the\nmost common reason that people leave\ncoaching is they accomplish their goals\nnumber one reason\nto stop coaching\nso\nyou know like it basically like it\nfor some people it takes longer\nto get there for some people they get\nthere faster but it's not necessarily\nlike more is better if that makes sense\nso do i have links to the studies that\nyou talk about during stream i would\nlove to read them so if you all want\nlinks so a lot of the stuff that\nwe\nuh\nlet me so i have three ways to answer\nthat question the first is not always\nbut for example if you all want to learn\nabout attachment theory you can get a\nbook on attachment theory so i recently\ngot let me see if i can find it\nthis book is great\non attachment theory right so\ni don't know how to say this but when i\nlike teach stuff\ni read this\nand this is not one study i mean this is\nlike you know this is a textbook so this\nprobably has hundreds of citations\nsecond thing is if you all want\ncitations dr k's guide has a ton of them\nso that's where we do try to very\nexhaustively\noffer\na targeted bibliography to the concepts\nthat we share so that's the best place\nto find a bibliography\nthird thing is what i'm the data that\ni'm citing now is not published it's\nfrom an irb approved study that we're\npreparing for publication so it's\npre-publication data although it has\nbeen presented\nso vetted in some way by the apa because\nthey have to you know look at our data\nand decide whether it's okay to\npreliminary present at conferences you\nfrequently will have pre-publication\ndata that's presented\nso if you're asking about us like our\ndata\ngood question though\nbook name\nhandbook of attachment\nit is called the handbook because it\nbarely fits in the hand\n[Music]\na couple of other things uh if people\nare curious\num\nso just other outcomes 16 weeks of group\ncoaching\nalso experienced 58 oh okay so it looks\nlike i got some numbers wrong so\npersonal coachings we see a 35 to 45\nreduction in anxiety and group coaching\nis 27 to 35 percent\num\n[Music]\nand in career coaching at eight weeks\npeople see\n25 to 35 reductions in depression and\nanxiety and a 25\nincrease in confidence in the trajectory\nof their career\nthat's at eight weeks so for career\ncoaching we don't have quite as much\nlong longitudinal data it's also been\nsmaller so we don't have like you know\nour sample size for our apa\npresentation was 1300 we don't have that\nmany people who've gone through career\ncoaching\nso we we seems like people get are 25\nmore confident in their career\ntrajectory\njay naxo if i made a video about what is\npurpose i think so you can check our\nyoutube channel but we talk a lot about\npurpose in dr k's guide i think\nespecially the depression guide\nor the meditation guide\nso i think that a lot of like\nwhat may be getting misdiagnosed as\ndepression is actually like a lack of\npurpose in life\nbunzo one is asking have you read the\nbook attached to the new science of\nadult attachment and how it can help you\nfind and keep love no i have not so uh i\ni've heard good things about the book\nbut i generally speaking\nread primary\ntextbooks or\npapers\nas opposed to pop science books that are\ntargeted at the lay audience i'm not\nsaying that the book isn't great\nbut\nyou know like i just\ni like to get as close to the primary\ndata as i can\nso what i tend to find about a lot of\nthe pop science books is they're\nfantastic don't get me wrong but that\nlike\ni often times\nam not\nsatisfied with the data that they\npresent it's usually like a lot more\nanecdotal right it'll be like lots of\nstories\nwhich is fine it's the the audience is\ndifferent\nmullet offlane is saying giving someone\ncareer coaching it's a boost and of\ncourse people start to believe in\nthemselves they would get a higher boost\nif you put in five thousand dollars in\ntheir account\nmy point being that people are\ndelusional and can be swayed in\ndifferent ways\ni don't know what you base that on\nmullet offlane love the name by the way\num\ni i actually don't know that\nthey would\ni actually\ndon't know how you make that claim that\nif you just gave someone a cash infusion\nthey would feel more confident about\ntheir career trajectory\nthat\nin fact i would actually think that that\nwould have very little impact they may\nreduce their stress\nmay provide a sense of financial\nsecurity\nbut what we're talking about is career\ntrajectory confidence in where your\ncareer is going that's built up over\ntime i don't know that a one-time cash\ninfusion would make people feel more\nconfident\nit's an interesting point i'm just\nreally curious what you base that on\nis lack of purpose associated with lack\nof motivation or excitement i would\nabsolutely think so\nthat too is not\ni'm trying to think about whether i've\nactually seen a study\nthat uses a validated measure of emotion\ni mean motivation excitement and a\nvalidated measure of purpose and whether\nthose two things are correlated i can't\nthink of one\nseems like simple right that the answer\nwould be yes but\ni i don't know\nso does your new adhd module have\ninsights on inattentive adhd types so\nthis is a great question\nthis may sound kind of weird but\nin the adhd module we don't focus\non\nthe separate subtypes of adhd and\nthere's a reason for that\nso if you look at the subtypes of adhd\nright there's inattentive type there's\nhyperactive there's add hyperactivity\nthere's even hypotheses of an\nemotionally dysregulated subtype\nso my experience working as a clinician\nwith adhd is even if you get diagnosed\nwith a particular subtype there's a lot\nof variance within that subtype\nso inattentive may have\nmore of a social element versus like a\nprofessional element so some people will\nhave like a bad inattention in in their\nprofessional life but be totally fine in\ntheir social life or vice versa\nso instead what we do\nis rather than focusing on sort of the\ndsm subtypes what we focus on is the\nneuroscience circuits\nso what are all of the ways in which\nadhd impacts or add impacts your brain\nwhat are the different neuroscientific\ncircuits how does it affect your\nemotional regulation how does it affect\nyour attention how does it affect uh\nexecutive function like planning and\nexecuting action\nand so my experience has been that when\nyou take a more comprehensive\nneuroscience approach and you understand\nokay what are all the ways in which my\nbrain is like being impacted by this\nthat's when you can really figure out a\ntailored strategy\nto understanding yourself and as a\nclinician that's kind of the approach\nthat i take\nif that makes sense\nright it's not a substitute for clinical\ntreatment by any means\nbut what it is is an insight into how i\nthink about patients which i think is\nabsolutely like educational which even\npatients should think about themselves\nthis way\nto your knowledge can repeated\nmedication in efficacy indicate a\nmisdiagnosis of adhd sure\nright so not commenting on your\nparticular case but a general principle\nof medicine is if the treatment doesn't\nwork or five treatments don't work then\nreconsider the diagnosis that's like\ndiagnostic logic 101\num\nthank you topless orange for answering\nnorth star warriors questions\nso this is important to understand so\nwhen we started streaming a lot of\npeople wanted to work with dr k and\nwhile i'm flattered by that\nwhat i really found was like i just\ncan't do it like physically\ni don't have enough hours in the day i\nwould love\nto work with each and every one of you\nindividually and i'm not just saying\nthat i genuinely mean it like i love\ndoing individual work\nlove it\nit's like one of my favorite things to\ndo\nthe challenge is that there just isn't\nenough time fundamentally so then the\nquestion is like okay if i can't get to\neveryone so one of my i went to a friend\nof mine and i said hey i'm getting a\nbunch of referrals like i'm not quite\nsure what to do about it\nand they were joking and they were\nsaying yeah well like you know either\nyou increase more hours in the day\nor you duplicate yourself that's the\nonly way that you can help these people\nthey were being facetious\nand they were saying\nyou basically can't help them there's\nnothing you can do\nbut i got to thinking and i was like\nwait a minute\nhow special am i\nand i actually believe i'm not that\nspecial i think a lot of what i\naccomplish\nis not because like\nthere's some special circuit in my brain\nthat other human beings don't have i\nthink it's just because\ni was taught certain concepts and like\nhave had certain kinds of training right\nso a couple years of meditation training\nmedical school psychiatry residency\nclinical work and also a lot of stuff\nthat isn't clinical work so i myself\nstruggled with playing too many games\nand i hung out with a lot of gamers and\nso then the question became\ncan i actually teach what i do to people\nand so then was kind of thinking about\nso i did the first one of the first\nthings that i did is put together a\ncontinuing medical education course for\nthe american psychiatric association on\nvideo game addiction which you all can\nsign up for and watch if you want to\num i also started teaching\nstuff at harvard medical school so like\nstarted teaching stuff on technology\naddiction and stuff there\nand so was trying to equip clinicians\nbut like ran into a slight problem\nwhich is that\ni don't\nthe people\nlike psychiatry residents at hms don't\nhave like 50 hours to spend\nlearning\nwhat i can teach\nthey've got to learn a bunch of other\nstuff\nright they have to learn about psycho\nform they have to learn about\nschizophrenia they have to learn about\ntms and ect\nand i don't think that my knowledge is\nmore valuable than that is i don't think\nit's a good idea to have dr k teaching\nthere for 50 hours so it's not\nappropriate there's way more important\nstuff for them to learn\nbut for our particular population there\nare things that i think are applicable\nand that's like literally why we started\na coaching program\neverything that we do at hg is\ndesigned based on the needs of the\ncommunity literally\nso the question is can i teach people\nwhat i do\nnow are they duplicates of me of course\nnot\nbut i think we can teach them enough\nand that's what the data shows so we\nstarted a pilot\nwe took i think like eight or ten people\nfrom the community\nand we i shared some concepts and they\nstarted working with some clients and\nlike we did pilot studies right so we\nstarted with a pilot study\ndidn't charge anything or anything like\nthat let's just see if this works\nand then since that time we've gone\nthrough six or seven curriculum\nrevisions\nas we collect data\nas we ask people what worked for you\nwhat didn't work for you\nwe get better globally and then we\ndisseminate that out and we modify our\ncurriculum and i think part of the\nreason that we get the outcomes that we\nget is because\nwe really incorporate\ndata analytics and feedback into\ncurriculum advancements\nso so like in a weird way i mean all of\nour coaches are fantastic but like the\nones that are trained later i think have\na more refined curriculum which the\nolder coaches have access to as well but\nso they can re-watch stuff\nand so but basically a lot of the\nrefinements come from actually the older\ncoaches when the older coaches will say\nhey i've seen like 15 people who\nstruggle with this like let's talk about\nit then we figure things out\nso we try to stay adaptive and\nresponsive to the community\ndo you do follow-ups to track the\nlong-term effects of coaching simeon\ngreat question not yet is the answer at\nleast not that i'm aware of\nyes dude is asking how can we make your\nlessons and perspectives available\nbroadly in general school education\nrather than\nhaving to stumble upon it by miss\nclicking on on an asthma gold stream\nyes dude your your guess is as good as\nmine if anyone out there has a\nso we i saw a really great post like a\ncouple months ago\nabout a teacher\nwho like synthesized one of our\nworkshops and taught it to a group of\ntheir fellow teachers\nand they were like this is really really\nhelpful like we were talking about\ngifted kids and stuff like that like why\nkids like behave the way that they do i\ndon't remember the details of what they\ntaught\nbut\ni'm like like i said earlier i'm totally\ni think that health education and\nunderstanding your mind should be a\nbasic part of education so this was true\nin ancient india where like learning\nyoga and meditation was a part of school\nin fact\nschool was taught at monasteries\nso you learned like science and music\nand like how to meditate and about\nemotions\nand sense organs and all this kind of\nstuff\nso this is where\ni hate to break it to you yes dude but i\ndon't have all the answers and we're not\nall geniuses over here\nthis is where if you all have a\nsuggestion for making and the suggestion\nis like you all should do this\nlike that helps only so much\nright so the more operationalized it is\nor if anyone\nknows people who work on educational\ncurriculums\nyou know let us know\nbecause we'd love to make this a part of\nstandard education\nwe've gotten some interest from teachers\nhere and there but like it's a system\nand like i like i don't know how to say\ni don't have any magical power to like\nwave something and go talk to a\nsuperintendent of the school district\nyou"
