I knew sooner\nyeah\nyeah well I was hoping that you kind of\njust sit there while I got some stuff\ndone so you just want me to sit here\nwhile you do stuff not help or anything\nno okay just you being here is gonna\nhelp me out a lot but you can help\nyourself to anything in the fridge why\nare all your condiments in the message\nbut your vegetables are in the cotton\nlike what are you what are you doing\nwell if the vegetables were in the\ndrawer then it kind of turned into like\na out of sight out of mind kind of thing\nand I would never use them kind of makes\nsense but it also kinda feels like a sin\nI'm telling you it works for me hey\ndon't put that down\nwhat put it away oh don't put it down\nput it away don't put it down put it\naway don't put it down put it away\nADHD hacks all right so this is actually\nreally interesting I I like this for a\ncouple of reasons there's a there's one\nwe're gonna re-watch the first one okay\nand then there are a couple of really\ninteresting principles that we're going\nto share\nwhich are really good\nso this is something 18 people don't\nknow\nPhD hacks that I wish I knew sooner yeah\ninviting me over uh\nwhat do you want to do oh I invited you\nover to be my body double for the day\nokay well I was hoping this for a second\nsit there while I got some stuff done so\nyou just want me to sit here while you\ndo stuff not help or anything no okay\njust you all right so let's let's talk\nabout this so this is kind of\ninteresting\nso\npeople with ADHD\nyou know so this person's basically\nsaying oh like I will be more productive\nif you come to my house and you sit down\nand you don't need to help me but if\nyou're around it'll help Okay so let's\nunderstand this is actually true let's\nunderstand the scientific principle\nbehind it and furthermore once we\nunderstand the scientific principle like\nyou may be thinking okay so if having\nsomeone around will help me do my work\nbut like what if I don't have someone\naround\nhow can I take advantage of this even if\nI don't have someone around so this is\nreally important to understand so let's\nunderstand a little bit about why this\nhelps people with ADHD\nokay\nso let's say that this is your optimal\nlevel of functioning\nlet's say that this is the level of\nstimulation\nokay\nin your environment so what happens if\nyou take a kid with ADHD and you put him\nin a empty room\nwhat does the kid do if a kid with ADHD\nis in a completely empty room\nwith no stimulation so you start them\nover there what do they start to do do\nADHD symptoms increase or decrease so\nthis worsens ADHD\nso what you'll find with a kid in an\nempty room is that they'll like move\naround they'll fidget they'll like\nwhatever and so what they're actually\ndoing in this situation is increasing\ntheir stimulation right so they're\nself-stimulating they start doing stuff\nso if I add let's say a couple of toys\nso I give them moderate stimulation what\nhappens to their ADHD their ADHD\nimproves\nand if I put a kid in a room full of\ntons and tons of toys with flashing\nlights and all kinds of other stuff very\nhigh stimulation what happens\nworsens ADHD\nokay\nso if you look at a neurotypical brain\nso this may be the optimal level of\nstimulation\nfor people with ADHD the key thing is\nthat if you look at neurotypical people\nwhat you tend to find is that the\noptimal level of stimulation is probably\nover here\nit's lower than it is with ADHD so even\nif you put a neurotypical person in a\nroom with com like nothing they will\nalso self-stimulate explore Etc but if\nyou put them with like as many toys as\nthe ADHD person needs that'll be over\nstimulation from them and what they're\ngoing to need to do is actually kind of\ndecrease their level of stimulation\nso this is why like you know people with\nADHD may study with music things like\nthat\nso what does having another person do it\nessentially increases the Baseline level\nof stimulation to reach your optimal\nlevel for like performance and being\nable to do work there are also studies\nthat show so there's a couple of other\ninteresting principles here so white\nnoise\nis another good example of this that\npeople with ADHD who some of them who\nlisten to White Noise will actually be\nable to focus better and it works on the\nsame principle over here a couple of\nother interesting\num uh side effects of this if you're\ntrying to get people with ADHD to\nmeditate\ndoes anyone know one tip\nthat you can tell someone who has ADHD\nif they have trouble meditating what can\nyou do\nanyone know\nmeditate with your eyes open\nso what does that do\nit's kind of interesting right because\nwe tell most people to to close their\neyes when they meditate but in this case\nif you actually if you have someone with\nADHD sometimes if they meditate with\ntheir eyes open\nthey'll actually be able to focus better\nbecause eyes open will increase their\nBaseline level of of simulation to the\noptimal level so kind of interesting\nTick Tock turns out it is also correct\nright but if you don't have a body\ndouble if you don't have someone who can\ncome over there may be some baseline\nlevel of stimulation that you can\nincrease like white noise or listening\nto music or things like that that can\nalso work okay being here is going to\nhelp me out a lot but you can help\nyourself to anything and I would never\nuse them so kind of makes sense but it\nalso this also sort of makes sense right\nbecause people with ADHD will be very\nactivated by stimuli so if you see the\nvegetables you'll like open the thing\nand you'll be like oh yeah I have\nvegetables\nand so it's kind of like uh\nlike building your environment to\nbe suited towards your attention span\nkinda\nfeels like a sin I'm telling you it\nworks for me hey don't put that down\nhere's where things get tricky put it\naway oh don't put it down put it away\ndon't put it down put it away so I think\nthis is great advice for keeping your\nplace clean\nhere's the problem with that so if we\nthink about the brain\nwhat is the part of our brain\nthat allows us to put it down instead of\nputting it away so let's like think\nabout this okay what is the sequence of\nevents from putting it down to putting\nit away so the first thing that you've\ngot to do and I'll kind of ask y'all\nthis question so when people with ADHD\nput things down\nare they aware when they put things down\nso the first problem is that there's a\nlack of awareness\nwhen you put something down right that's\nwhy people forget people with ADHD don't\nforget there's no problem with their\nmemory\ntheir problem is actually with their\ninability to attend it never sinks in in\nthe first place it's not a problem with\nretrieval so if this kind of makes sense\nif we think about memory\nsomething goes into our memory and then\nwe recall it\nand so what happens is when I when I ask\nmyself where are my keys\nI can't recall so I assume that I have a\nproblem with my memory I have\nforgetfulness it's not forgetfulness\nit's that you weren't paying attention\nwhen you put them down in the first\nplace so there's nothing down here this\nis empty right because this is actually\nwhere the problem is in ADHD\nso this is challenging because putting\nit down putting it away instead of\nputting it down is a fantastic idea love\nit the challenge is that that is\nactually twice as hard for ADHD people\nas it is for neurotypical people because\nthey have lack of attention they don't\nrealize they're putting it down in the\nfirst place the second thing is even if\nthey do realize it you'd have to\nrestrain an impulse\nto put it down\nand then use goal directed Behavior\nright I have to stop myself\nand then like I have to plan and execute\nokay I should like go over here and put\nit over there\nso if you kind of think about that\nthese are actually all the weaknesses of\na brain with ADHD these are what where\nwe know they're uh\nyou know functional impairments so\nthere's a lack of attention right I'm\nnot paying attention I've there's\nimpulsivity in ADHD so I have to\nrestrain an Impulse which is what people\nwith ADHD sometimes struggle with and\nthen I have to use my frontal lobe to\ndirect myself in the right direction so\nthis is fantastic advice I strongly\nrecommend everyone try it but recognize\nthat it's not going to be as easy as it\nappears on the tick tock and in fact if\nyou have ADH I mean this is hard enough\nif you're neurotypical but it's going to\nbe an uphill battle if you've got ADHD\nstill good good tip though"
