    "transcript": "if we live a life of Hedonism we're\ngoing to feel empty we're going to feel\nguilty we're going to feel ashamed of\nourselves I'm not doing anything with my\nlife I'm going to feel like other people\nare like good and like I'm like a waste\nof space and all this kind of stuff I\nhave no dreams or aspirations and I\ncan't find anything that interests me no\nexperience in posting online stuff but I\nwill try to be as short and concise as\npossible generally most people I know\nwould say I have a pretty good life I'm\npretty happy with myself and my\npersonality have a good family and a\ngood group of friends the only problem\nis I simply is simply that I can't find\nany job degree or field that I can work\nwith for more than a month without\nhating everything about it being\nsomewhat easy going I first thought that\nthe solution would be to try out new\nthings until I find something I can be\nhappy doing I've studied for multiple\ndifferent degrees and worked a whole lot\nof jobs in my search for something over\nthe past five years but have never found\nanything I find even remotely fun or\ninteresting every single day that I have\nspent working slash studying so far have\nbeen nothing but tiresome and\nexcruciatingly painful in the beginning\nI was motivated to find my place in the\nworld now I'm beginning to doubt that it\neven exists as a result my mental health\nhas been deteriorating to the point\nwhere I spend my time after work and\nweekends doing almost nothing but laying\nin bed staring at the ceiling I have no\nmotivation to go out to meet new people\nor start a relationship or other things\nthat I actually want to do I believe I\nmight be depressed but I don't want to\nprescribe any sort of illness to myself\nwithout talking to a doctor or\npsychiatrist first good smart without\ngoing into detail that is currently not\nan option nor will it be for some time\nthat's sag and unfortunate my current\njob was yet another attempt at finding\nsomething that might catch my interest\nhowever it has turned out to be the\nworst one so far as I have to work a\npainful amount of overtime to fulfill my\nduties I'm currently in contact with\nsomeone who has offered me a job within\na new field but I will have to endure my\ncurrent job for almost a year until I\ncan start working there if it turns out\nto be be as bad as everything else I've\ntried so far I have absolutely no idea\nwhat to do I can feel that I am quickly\nrunning out of gas and I think my next\njob is the last attempt I get before\ngiving up on everything and start living\non state welfare welfare while lying in\nbed 24 7. I have no requirements when it\ncomes to salary location or status only\nthat I can find something I can enjoy at\nleast every now and then what am I\nsupposed to do keep searching until I\ninevitably burn out am I perhaps failing\nto deal with the problem at its root\nwhile focusing only on the symptoms any\nhelp is appreciated so sometimes we get\ninto this situation where we don't like\nany work we're looking for our place in\nthe world right there's a place there's\na there's a U-shaped hole out there\nsomewhere that only you can fill and we\ngo looking for it and each thing that we\ntry is not something that we find happy\nlike we're not filled with happiness and\njoy and so like we're like okay this is\nnot for me and it becomes excruciatingly\npainful because I I don't enjoy it right\nit's not fun and then people out there\nmay say like oh but a job isn't supposed\nto be fun right you're supposed to\nsuffer kind of true and kind of like\nreally bad right because I mean if\nthat's true does that mean that I\nessentially have to sign up for a life\nthat's excruciatingly painful and\nthere's something really Insidious about\nthat because if we sort of assume that a\njob is not supposed to be fun and we\nkind of write off peace or enjoyment or\nexcitement in a job because we say oh\nit's like just not a possibility then we\ncould be writing something off that's\nvery very significant right so what do\nyou do in this situation where you've\ntried a bunch of things and it's not\njust jobs right it's also degrees right\nlike oh I'm gonna try to figure out what\nI want to do with my life so I'm going\nto study this that's not fun I'm going\nto try something else that's not fun I'm\ngoing to try something else that's not\nfun and then what do I do like how do\nyou move forward because the more that\nyou pull yourself out of the hole\nbecause let's let's understand like how\nyou get into the hole for a second right\nso as I try something and I don't enjoy\nit I try something and I don't enjoy it\nI try something and I don't enjoy it\nwhat am I doing to myself am I getting\nany kind of positive reinforcement for\ngoing out there and trying no of course\nnot every time I try it's like an epic\nfail excruciatingly painful as this\nperson puts it then what is my brain\ndoing it's telling me why are you\nwasting your time going out there and\ntrying something like clearly there's\nnothing positive that's reinforcing this\nBehavior so then as your brain is\nstarting to tell you don't bother I.E\nlay in bed all day you have to use\nwillpower to overcome a lack of\nreinforcement so you go out there and\nonce more into the breach and then like\nthat's not fun and you come back and so\nthen you without any kind of positive\nreinforcement you end up using willpower\nover and over and over again then you\nend up burning out it becomes easier to\nlay in bed so how do you overcome this\nsituation so this is going to sound kind\nof weird but we're actually going to\ntake an approach that's like really\nreally like in a sense simple but quite\nprofound and also quite old we're gonna\ndig into what is like the nature of\nHappiness enjoyment Pleasure and Pain\nlike how do these things work and it\nturns out that there's actually one\nphrase which will sort of explain all of\nthis stuff and also how to navigate\nforward like how to move forward so we\nsort of talk about happiness as\nsomething that's Elusive and difficult\nto understand or like hard to find like\nwhat is the meaning of happiness it\nturns out that there was this guy named\npatanjali who lived maybe about two\nthousand to three thousand years ago who\nfigured it out and he said one thing\nwhich is Yoga\nokay that we may be like what what on\nEarth does that mean so I'll explain\nI'll translate it for you yoga which\nmeans Union in this case we're going to\nkind of talk about peace and contentment\nso peace happiness and contentment comes\nfrom fluctuation cessation of\nfluctuations of the mind so when our\nmind stops fluctuating that's when we'll\nbe at peace so the first thing that I'm\ngoing to ask y'all is like when you're\nin an excruciatingly painful work\nsituation what is your mind doing\nchances are it's going to be having lots\nof thoughts okay so this is something\nthat we're going to illustrate using a\ndiagram so this is something that's like\nreally simple actually but we we just\nnever we never discuss it like we don't\nactually teach this but even just out of\nthis one sort of insight from a yogi a\nmeditator basically we're going to learn\na lot about how to fix this okay so\nlet's understand this okay so remember\nwe said yoga\nwhich means Union or peace is attained\nby cessation of fluctuations in the mind\nso let's understand this principle and\nyou're like what does this have to do\nwith finding like happiness in life\nlet's talk about it okay let's say that\nmy mind\nis still so when I'm enjoying myself I\nknow it sounds kind of weird but there's\ngoing to actually be like Stillness of\nthe mind so let's say that like I'm\nmeditating right so when I'm meditating\nand if I'm in a good meditative session\nmy mind is still when I'm watching a\nsunset sitting on the beach and just\nlike vibing my mind is still when I'm\nlike let's say I'm go to a party and I'm\ndancing and I'm having a good time like\nmy mind isn't going to be filled with\nthoughts now let's look at something\nlike boredom so if I'm sitting somewhere\nand I start to get bored what happens to\nmy mind my mind starts to fluctuate okay\nso as I get bored I think about this\nthing I think about this thing I think\nabout this thing I go over here I start\nthinking in all these different\ndirections and if I dislike my job or if\nI dislike what I'm studying what's gonna\nhappen my mind is going to start\nthinking in a bunch of different ways\nI'm going to create more fluctuations in\nthe mind and the more fluctuations I\ncreate in the mind the more unhappy I\nbecome so I have a question for you if\nyou're in this situation you can do a\nsimple experiment which is when you go\nto a place where you're not not enjoying\nyourself notice what your mind is doing\nis there a bunch of activity in your\nmind because chances are there is how\nlong do I have to do this oh man I can't\nbelieve I have to do this this sucks I\ndon't want to be here I want to be\nsomewhere else I don't like this person\nthis isn't Fun am I ever gonna find\nsomething how do I find what am I going\nto do if this doesn't work out what if I\ndo how do I find this should I keep\nlooking should I not keep looking all of\nthose are fluctuations of the mind it's\nall not being at peace so I'll give you\nall another example to illustrate this\nlet's say my mind is peace at peace and\nthen I smell chicken nuggets I smell\nsome nuggies suddenly I have a desire\nand there's a fluctuation of the mind\nI'm no longer at peace because I smell\nsomething and then I start thinking\nabout nuggies I want the Nuggie I want\nto eat the Nuggie I want the Nuggie oh\nmy God it's so good and then if I eat\nthe Nuggie what happens in my mind so\nexperiment number two next time you have\na desire what does it do to your mind it\ncreates a fluctuation it starts to\ncreate thoughts I want a nugget am I\ngoing to be able to afford it is it\nhealthy for me is it unhealthy for me oh\nmy God if I eat it I'm gonna it's not\ngood for my health it creates guilt I\nworry about finances I've got food at\nhome so many fluctuations of the Mind do\nyou all see that and with each of these\nfluctuations am I happy am I at peace no\nnow what happens if I eat the Nagi as I\neat the Nagi I experience enjoyment my\nmind calms down right oh man that nug is\nso good I'm just sitting there I'm\nenjoying it so now we've returned to the\nBaseline of the mind and we've become\ncontent but only for so long right\nbecause then what happens there's\nanother fluctuation I'm unhealthy this\nthought pops up and then your peace is\ndestroyed you all see this so\npotentially figured it out any\nfluctuation of the mind is going to lead\nto a lack of peace and so what what\ntends to happen in our life is we have\ndesires we have all these Desires in the\nonly way that we know how to bring our\nmind back to peace is to fulfill our\ndesires that's why we fulfill our\ndesires so the problem though is that\neven when we fulfill our desires by\neating nuggies this doesn't it's not a\nsustainable solution because this will\nresult if we live a life of Hedonism\nwe're going to feel empty we're going to\nfeel guilty we're going to feel ashamed\nof ourselves I'm not doing anything with\nmy life I'm going to feel like other\npeople are like good and like I'm like a\nwaste of space and all this kind of\nstuff so even fulfilling desires doesn't\nfix it forever the other basic problem\nwith nuggies is like if I eat nuggies\ntoday what's going to happen tomorrow\nright so even if I have nuggies for a\nlittle bit and even if I distract myself\nthrough video games or whatever so I\ndon't feel guilty after eating nuggies\nright because that's what we do because\nin order to make the bad thoughts go\naway I'm going to distract myself\ntomorrow will come around and I will\nwant nuggies again I'm personally\nstruggling with this because I had\nnuggies on Friday and so I've wanted\nthem all weekend it's been hard Chad you\nguys see this so even fulfilling our\ndesires is only a temporary solution at\nbest but here's the key principle to\nunderstand forget about desires for a\nsecond where does the happiness exist\nwhere does the peace exist here here and\nhere this is what patanjali figured out\nso then the question becomes is there a\nway to hang out here without fulfilling\nour desires the answer is absolutely and\nif we understand that then we will be\nhappy so let's talk about work for a\nsecond in the case of work my first\nquestion to you is to be happy at work\nwhat are the parts of being happy at\nwork is there an external component if I\nfind the right job what percentage of\nHappiness can I get and is there an\ninternal component what percentage of\nHappiness can I get at work with an\ninternal through internal work so if I\ngo looking for the perfect job will I\never be able to find a job that will\nmake me 100 happy right so what is the\npercentage contribution of internal\nversus external like is it 100 and zero\nso my happiness involves finding the\nperfect job or is it 50 50 right or is\nit zero one hundred what is it so let me\nput the question to you all another way\nso one person is suggesting 2080. can\nyou if I take a fixed job that does not\nchange at all is it possible that I can\ndo something internally that will\nincrease my enjoyment of the work or\ndecrease my enjoyment of the work is\nthat possible so that answer I think is\nabsolutely yes so here's the other way\nthat I put it here's a person I've tried\nthis job this job this job this job they\nare all excruciatingly painful let's use\na different analogy I've dated this\nperson this person this person this\nperson this person all people suck are\n this person's an this\nperson's an this person's an\n this person I've dated so many\npeople I keep on dating\neveryone out there is an where's\nthe problem are they really all\ndo all jobs truly suck I'm not saying\nthat jobs don't suck right we're not\nsaying well we'll get there eventually\nwe're not necessarily espousing that my\npoint is that if you're out there and\nyou think everything around you is the\nproblem you can go look for the perfect\njob and who knows you may find it but my\npoint is that if you're looking for an\nexternal solution you've got to be super\ncareful because it could be at least\npartially an internal problem and in\nthis case like I think that's the\ndirection that this person should look\nso this is what's kind of interesting is\nthat as we look to our own happiness\nwithin a work situation we'll realize a\ncouple of different things so there's a\ndifference between the axis of Pleasure\nand Pain and the axis of peace and\nsuffering and this is the big problem\nwith society today is that we confuse\nthese two axes why do we confuse these\ntwo axes because of Technology because\nof dopamine so we know that people who\nlive hedonistic lives if I just spend\nall my time chasing dopamine and I move\nin this direction do these people live\nlives of peace and fulfillment no they\nend up over here dopamine puts you right\nhere because we try to retreat away from\npain now are there cases let's think\nabout this like are there cases where\nyou can feel at peace with yourself even\nif you're struggling sure\nabsolutely so for example when I was in\nmedical school I helped women give birth\nand that's this experience that is\nexcruciatingly painful\nand yet\nluckily most women that I worked with I\nwould put childbirth up here I'd ask\nthem would you do it again if you\ncouldn't they're like absolutely that's\nkind of interesting sometimes they do do\nit again sometimes they deliver a second\nbaby a third baby fourth baby right so\nit's actually possible like to have up\nhere be up here and so then the question\nis well well what you know what dictates\nwhether something is if we're sort of\nsaying that the axis of peace and\npleasure is different from the axis I\nmean sorry pain and pleasure is\ndifferent from the axis of peace and\nsuffering like how do we move along this\naxis and that's where we go back to this\ncessation of fluctuations of the mind\nand I've experienced this myself I mean\nnot childbirth but like for example when\nI'm on call being on call for 30 hours\nand working in a hospital is not fun\nit's not like binge like playing video\ngames is fun but the problem is that\nwhen I do a bunch of dopaminergic stuff\nI end up up here being on call is in\nthis direction and then there's other\nstuff right like there's like going on\nvacation with with my family which is\nactually up here right so that's like\nfulfilling and it's fun there are even\ntimes where gaming can be up here like\nit depends on when you're doing it right\nand there are times where there's like\npain there's stuff down here too\nabsolutely so if you're in this\nsituation like the first thing to to\nreally think about is what access are\nyou chasing because when I hear I don't\nenjoy my job I think they're looking for\nthis so you're moving in this you're\nfine trying to find a job that is like\ndopaminergic and if you're trying to\nfind a job that's dopaminergic you can\nkeep looking out there but I hate to\nbreak it to you but no job is going to\nbe able to compete with this\nno job\nwill be able to compete with this and so\nyou're looking to get peace out of\ndopaminergic jobs that ain't gonna\nhappen now you can find a job that you\nenjoy you find more pleasurable but it\nstill won't bring you peace peace is\nabout cessation of fluctuations of the\nmind so then the question becomes okay\nhow do I stop the fluctuations of my\nmind and so that's where I really start\nby like going back to this experiment\nwhich is like what is it that you don't\nenjoy about your job what is it that is\nexcruciatingly painful about your job\nchances are it's some kind of thought I\nfind this boring I'm not having fun this\nis not what I expected it's not living\nup to my expectations right it's like\nwhat's going to be excruciatingly\npainful I mean I don't know maybe your\njob is physically painful so that's a\nwhole different ballgame but chances are\nwhat people find excruciatingly boring\nor painful about their job is like up\nhere and so that's where you can control\nhow you react up here you can absolutely\ndo it so there are tasks that you can\nenjoy or not enjoy like you can\ncultivate that sort of internal\nenjoyment how do you do that with\nDetachment so this is what I'd say is\nthat if you're in this kind of situation\nare you looking for a dopaminergic hit\nfrom your job just ask yourself that\nquestion if the answer is yes then like\nask yourself how reasonable is that and\nthis is also where I sort of recommend\ntolerance right so don't give in to your\nmind because your mind is like oh this\nisn't as fun as gaming like screw this\nand so then the question is do you want\nyour mind to dictate your actions does\nyour mind need to be satisfied in order\nfor you to go to work because if you if\nit is then you're screwed because then\nyour mind if your mind is satisfied then\nyou luck out and if your mind is not\nsatisfied then you're unlucky and the\nnature of the mind is to be fluctuant I\ndon't know how to say this but if you're\nrelying on your mind then like the mind\ndoesn't stay happy from one thing over\nand over and over again that's just not\nhow it works right you can't play one\nvideo game for the rest of your life\nmaybe people who play chess are the\nexception so it does happen I suppose\nbut even within chess there's a variety\nright you're not playing the same person\nover and over and over again so you've\ngot to be super careful and so this is\nwhat's kind of interesting is as you\nstart ignoring the desires of your mind\nyou will cultivate Detachment and you\ncan even practice that by ignoring\ndesires that your mind has if you want\nnuggies no more nuggies for how long for\na year for a decade so between the ages\nof 21 and 31 abouts I basically gave up\none of my favorite things and I was like\njust not gonna get it just not gonna get\nit and every time I wanted it I was like\nyeah we're just not going to do that and\nmy mind would like squirm it'd be like\nwhy not what's the harm why are you\ndoing this when is it going to end I\njust be like yeah we're just not going\nto do it today we're not going to do it\ntoday and then eventually the mind like\nchilled out and then what I realized is\nlike I'm no longer like in like I'm not\nno longer controlled by this thing and\nthen I can start tolerating unpleasant\nexperiences the interesting thing is\nthat once you start developing\nDetachment and you start stop chasing\nthe fluctuations of the Mind any job\nbecomes more enjoyable so what I found\nis that like something bizarre happened\nwhich is that people are like I hate\nthis class like I hated histology but I\ncould still study for it okay I loved\nphysiology way more but I you know was\nit easier to study physiology sure but I\ncould do both and what I noticed is that\nall my colleagues in medical school were\ntortured so anxious oh my God like I\ndidn't know how to prepare for the\nsurgery what if the surgeon thinks that\nI'm an idiot and it's like I'm gonna\nprepare as best as I can the surgeon\nthinks I'm an idiot he's gonna think I'm\nan idiot and then I'm gonna get a bad\ngrade and so be it the most I can do is\nstudy for the surgery and it's bizarre\nit's liberating and the other really\nbizarre thing is once you start\ndeveloping Detachment or vairagya and\nnot following like what your mind wants\nyou to do it actually people may think\nbut then how on Earth am I going to\nsucceed at work does that mean that I'm\napathetic on the contrary it actually\nmeans that your work performance\nimproves right which is exactly why\nplaces like Stanford Business School and\nHarvard Business School are teaching\nmindfulness which is one of the ways\nthat you develop Detachment because it\nactually leads to improvements in\nperformance and you may ask but Dr K how\non Earth does not following my desires\nat work how does that lead to an\nimprovement in work performance and I\ndon't know how to say this but like\nimagine what your work would be like if\nif you are completely free from your\ndesires you could like if you could do\nwhatever like then you can just work for\nthe sake of working there's no inner\nconflict between oh what if like what\npeople don't like my ideas so I'm not\ngonna do them no it's like if people\ndon't like it they don't like it I'm\ngonna go ahead and do it anyway what if\nthere's no longer a conflict between\ndoing what you enjoy and financial\ncompensation because remember a lot of\nwhat what causes us to struggle at work\nis internal conflict do I follow my\npassion or do I like you know work at an\nairline and make like 150k a year as a\nprogrammer what do I do it's this\ninternal conflict whereas once you're\nfree of the internal conflict you your\njob does what the job is supposed to do\nit's like no problem for you it actually\nis absolutely liberating to no longer\nhave internal conflict at work because\nof like conflicting desires and so I\nknow it sounds kind of weird this may\nnot be the answer that y'all are\nexpecting but if you're having trouble\nenjoying anything at work and I'm not\nsaying that tolerate bad things just\nbecause you're detached in fact once you\nbecome detached you can recognize oh\nthis is is actually like not a good work\nsituation so I'm going to move the cool\nthing is that once you're detached\nthere's no guilt around it it's like\nokay this is objectively bad and you\nstart acting objectively instead of\nsubjectively because when you're\nattached you're very subjective it's all\nup in here oh my God and once you start\nto detach yourself right you gain\ndistance from your problem you will\nbecome more objective and then you can\nstart like making good choices because\nyour mind is no longer Tangled Up So if\nyou're struggling to find the right kind\nof job because no job is enjoyable to\nyou you've got to start thinking a\nlittle bit about where does enjoyment\ncome from does it come externally or\ninternally and you have to work somewhat\non yourself internally to recognize okay\nwhat does it mean when the job is\nexcruciatingly painful what is my\nexperience of excruciatingly painful\nchances are it's up here and so then the\nquestion is does this control you or do\nyou control this because as long as this\ncontrols you you're never going to find\na job that you enjoy but once you start\ncontrolling it you will find that the\nenjoyment of all jobs will increase and\nI'm not saying that don't be calculating\nthere may be some things that you still\nenjoy more than others right because\ngetting to Enlightenment that state of\n100 and zero is very difficult but you\ncan get to 50 50. and as you get to 50\n50 it'll be a lot easier to find jobs\nthat you enjoy once it becomes easier to\nfind jobs that you can enjoy then you've\ngot options instead of like burnout and\nlaying in bed all day okay so how do you\nactually do the control though sometimes\nit it seems I can and sometimes I can't\nlike how do I increase that chance of\nbeing able to every day so this is\nexcellent question the control is\nfundamentally achieved through awareness\nso if your job is excruciatingly painful\ndo you even understand what is\nexcruciatingly painful about it what is\nthe actual substance of excruciatingly\npainful because I will bet you money\nthat the experience of excruciatingly\npainful is thoughts it's just thoughts\nthis is a dead end job the job is what\nit is it's neither dead end or not dead\nend it may not have great professional\nprospects but where is the pain coming\nfrom it's from the thought that this is\na dead end job there are some people who\nwill agree that this is a dead-end job\nthere are some people will agree that it\nwill say that this isn't a veteran job\nit's still work experience on your\nresume if you work in retail and don't\nhave an opportunity for promotion after\ntwo years you still have two years of\nretail experience under your belt you\ncan go apply for somewhere else there's\nan advantage to any job but that's not\nthe way that your mind sees it so it\nstarts by awareness what is the nature\nof excruciating pain where does that\ncome from and then what you'll realize\nit's wild what you realize is it's\nfictitious it's a mirage right it goes\nback to what I was saying about like I\nstill remember on my surgery rotation I\nwas blown away it's like if I'm gonna do\nbad like I can study that's all I can do\nis study and either I'll have studied\nthe right thing or not studied the right\nthing there are some things that I can\ndo so I'll even go and ask the resident\nhey I've got this case tomorrow do you\nhave any recommendations for how I\nshould prepare resin is like yeah I\nwould read a b and c I go home and I\nread a b and c if the attending asks me\nif the surgeon asks me about d e and f\nwhat was I supposed to do I went and\nasked the person what I should study\nshould I have ignored that is that the\nright move and just study other random\nthings that the person told me not to\nstudy because that sounds like the wrong\nmove and that's when you begin to\nrealize that like all you can do in life\nis what you can do and you can't get\nhung up on what other people do now\nshould you ignore feedback from other\npeople no we're not saying that you live\na life of selfishness and ignore other\npeople I'm saying most you can do is\nwhat you can do once you start to\nrealize that then you will start to\ncontrol your mind you can also practice\nthrough meditation you can practice\nthrough even to a certain degree like\nthe bus yard even deprivation of some\nkind right so you can practice\nrestraining your desires so pick a food\nthat you enjoy don't eat it for a decade\nand then you may think oh\nbut what what I can't eat it for a\ndecade what is it like you only like one\nfood no there's like plenty of other\ngood stuff to eat you're gonna survive\nno but like I'm not gonna be happy well\nlike you eating the food right now it's\nnot like you're happy anyway control\nyour mind and then notice Watch what it\ndoes no nuggies for a necking Watch what\nit does how it Rebels but it's like hold\non a second you've been eating nuggies\nfor 20 years are you happy in life well\nno but I want it I want it so then the\nquestion is okay like who's gonna decide\nwhat you do the part of your brain\nthat's like I want it though don't take\nit away from me yeah it's just like of\ncourse you're gonna enjoy it there's no\nquestion that you're gonna enjoy it but\ndoes you does it bring you peace or does\nit bring you suffering how do you\ncontrol it with practice with awareness\npay attention all of these things why\nare you unhappy because I didn't get\nwhat I want so is that going to be the\ncriteria for happiness and unhappiness\nonce again let's be critical about it\nwhen you get what you want how long does\nthe happiness last I want the perfect\nwedding I want a dream wedding and I do\nnot care what any anyone else wants I'm\nuninviting my older sister because she\nhas lost weight and is trying to make me\nlook bad I want it's my perfect day how\nlong does the happiness from your\nperfect day last the really sad thing is\nthat oftentimes people who fight really\nhard for their Perfect Day get their\nperfect day and are unhappy because of\nit even Soul Munchies is saying that day\nI would argue that not really because I\nthink when they get their perfect day\nthere's so much resentment built up they\nget their desires but they're not\nactually at peace they get what they\nwanted but deep down they're fuming and\nif they don't get what they want they're\nresentful so what's the answer what's\nthe solution the solution is to be not\nokay and be at peace with not getting\nwhat you want I don't need perfect I'm\nhappy with good enough\nforeign"
