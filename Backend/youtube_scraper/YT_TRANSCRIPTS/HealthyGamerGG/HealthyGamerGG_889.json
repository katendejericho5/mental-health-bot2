    "transcript": "so for a lot of people who are afraid to\nopen up to other people what we discover\nis that there's somewhere in their life\nwhere they did open up and they like\nweren't really\nthey didn't get the answer that they\nwere looking for how to have the courage\nto open up I've noticed for a long time\nthat I have a habit of bottling things\nup and dealing with things on my own\nsuch that in the past I was prone to\neasily isolate myself and dismiss any\nuncomfortable emotions since I didn't\nquite understand the act of\nacknowledging and being present with it\nI believe I've gotten better since I\nfound a system where I would immediately\nJournal my thoughts and feelings away\nwhenever there whenever things arise I\nalso resist the urge to isolate from\nother people however however I still\nhave a super hard time allowing myself\nto be vulnerable and ask help to process\nout my true feelings\nI still have the strong sense of not\nknowing not wanting to burden people\nabout my problems nor I nor I never\nthink they're worthy to be shared since\nI feel silly to do so\nit's like I know the steps of on how to\nmake myself feel better and rely on\nmyself but why can't I also allow myself\nto lean on someone else too\nI feel like I know the right answer to\nthis already it's like I've read so many\nself-help books but I I know I can't do\neverything on my own maybe this is my my\nway of sharing and wanting some form of\nhelp or just to process things out I\nalready have the urge of wanting to\ndelete this post later and process it by\nmyself but it'd be nice if there are\ntips to challenge the thoughts of not\nwanting to be vulnerable with people\nso I love this post more Discord\nI love it because this is exactly what\nI'm happy to see in our community\nwhich is like okay so we start off\nand we don't know our emotions I don't\nknow how I feel\nright I'm like unfamiliar with emotions\nI like don't like the way that I feel\nand so we start like working on our\nemotions internally because that's where\nemotions exist right they're in here\nso I start working on emotions and then\nI learn how to journal and stuff I\nbecome more emotionally aware and even\nthe case of this person they also become\naware that I want to delete this\nbut\nthere comes a point where like as we're\nexploring our emotions there's like this\nvery big divide there's like a cliff\nof I'm totally fine exploring emotions\nby myself\nbut I can't lean on other people I can't\nopen up to other people\nI I can't burden other people right it's\nall got to be by myself and if we pay\nattention to this post you may be\nsimilar in the sense that you're also\nthinking about like self-help books\nright how do I do this on my own I\nbecome emotionally aware on my own but I\nstill can't open up to other people so\nwhat do we do about this\nso what I'm going to do is we're going\nto talk a little bit about why this\nhappens and we're going to share with\nyou all five things that you can do and\nthe fifth of which is quite\nrevolutionary\nthe first four maybe things that you've\nsort of\nthought of\nor worked on in some way but it's really\nthe fifth one that I think is going to\nlike be quite different okay and it's\ngoing to completely reconceptualize how\nyou think about this the other cool\nthing is that the fifth one will help a\nlot because it'll transform the way that\nyou think about this\nso number one\nis be aware of your own emotions so this\nperson has already done this so they've\nsort of recognized that in order to have\na discussion with someone else about\nemotions we have to be aware of what\nwe're feeling right it's very hard to\nhave a discussion with someone when we\ndon't even know what we feel that's\nactually part of the reason that we have\ndiscussions with people by the way is to\nfigure out what we feel\nbut it starts with some amount of\nawareness of your own emotions so like\nthis person does you can journal or\nsomething like that but you start to\nlike think a little bit about okay like\nwhat am I feeling right now is it\nphysical is it mental where in space\nlike you know am I feeling uh negative\nemotion or a positive emotion why am I\nfeeling this way so you have to have\nsome amount of awareness of emotions\nthe second thing is\nyou've got to be you've got to start\nsmall so when it comes to awareness of\nemotions there's this thing called the\nemotions wheel or the feelings wheel\nwhich someone made up I don't know\nexactly who I've seen lots of iterations\nand so there are all kinds of like\nemotions right so we can figure out\nnegative emotions positive emotions or\nstuff like shame anger but in terms of\nanger that anger can there can be all\nkinds of anger there can be a sense of\nfeeling betrayed there can be\nself-loathing there can be anger towards\nother people there can be feelings of\nunfairness there are all kinds of\nemotions sub-emotions that we're not\nreally aware of at the very beginning\nmost of what we feel is angry\nso if we want to understand our own\nemotions and how to be able to open up\nwe've got to kind of start small and\nkind of meet ourselves where we're at so\nI'd start by even asking yourself\nsomething simple like do you you know\nare you experiencing a positive emotion\nor a negative emotion\nwhat's the color of the negative emotion\nis it Angry is it frustration is it\nshame is it fear is it sadness is it\nworry\nand this is where there's a tip I'll\ngive you which is that oftentimes\nfrustration is the first thing that we\nfeel but frustration is usually an\numbrella motion that covers other\nemotions\nso when I say I'm frustrated\nyou know like I'm frustrated by not\nbeing invited to parties I'm frustrated\nthat my friends always forget to invite\nme but if you really dig underneath that\nthat's an umbrella motion what I really\nfeel is like lonely what I really feel\nis devalued right so there's a lot of\nstuff kind of under there so start small\nstart wherever you are and start to kind\nof dig in a little bit slowly\nokay\nother thing to consider when it comes to\nemotions and opening up is that when we\nfeel some kind of negative emotion we\nfeel vulnerable\nand when we feel vulnerable we feel like\nhiding or isolating this is like a\nprimordial human response anytime we're\nvulnerable we're going to feel like\nisolating pulling back you know because\nwe don't want to show those kinds of\nthings\neven in terms of if you look at like the\nanthropology like anthropological\nperspectives on Mental Health\nhistorically we've hidden mental illness\nwhy do we have a stigma against mental\nillness it's because for a long time\nlike historically like when people are\nmentally ill we sort of consider that a\nvulnerability we sort of consider it\nshaming and so we try to hide those\nkinds of things\nso you know it's okay to talk about\npositive emotions yeah I'm happy today\nI'm courageous you know I'm a good\nperson this is a success but when it\ncomes to sadness and being angry and\nbeing frustrated and being ashamed we\noftentimes don't share those kinds of\nthings and we feel like isolating\nnow there's a good reason for that it's\nnot just anthropological it's not just\nhistorical it's also because oftentimes\nwhen we share negative emotions what\nwhat's the response that we get\nwe paradoxically frequently get an\ninvalidating response\noh I don't feel like I'm attractive and\nthen you're friends because they're your\nfriends and they care about you it's\nlike oh you're crazy\nyou're beautiful\nhow could you not feel attractive you're\nso amazing how could you be so stupid\nthat you don't realize how beautiful you\nare what is wrong with you\nhow can you be so idiotic you're amazing\nand you don't even see it\nso it's paradoxical but oftentimes when\nwe share negative emotions\noddly enough people are actually quite\ndevaluing so that's where like we sort\nof learned this it's kind of weird so\nwhen you're trained to become a\npsychiatrist and we learn how to talk to\npeople who are suicidal\nwhen someone says I'm suicidal what we\nsort of get trained in is not to say oh\nyou're crazy like you have so much to\nlive for don't you see that\nit's to actually ask them hey what makes\nyou suicidal like help me understand why\nyou're thinking about ending your life\nand they'll say well my kids don't you\nknow my kids don't respect me I'm losing\nmy job I feel like my wife and I are\ngrowing apart and it's only a matter of\ntime before she divorces me\nand then like interestingly enough sort\nof the right thing to say sort of\ntextbook wise is to say wow I can\ntotally understand why someone in your\nsituation would feel the way that you do\nbecause it sounds like you're you're\nbeing separated from your family it\nsounds like you're afraid of a divorce\nit sounds like you care a lot about your\nmarriage and you're afraid it's going to\nend\nso we can be very validating which is\nnot usually how people respond to us\nwhen we share negative emotions\nso there is this very natural instinct\nand this is the third thing to\nunderstand is that the instinct is to\nisolate especially when we feel\nvulnerable\nso the next thing that we can kind of\nlook at is\nunderstanding why we have a fear of\nopening up in the first place\nso for a lot of people who are afraid to\nopen up to other people what we discover\nis that there's somewhere in their life\nwhere they did open up and they like\nweren't really\nthey didn't get the answer that they\nwere looking for so sometimes we grow up\nin households where people are not very\nemotionally supportive and it's actually\nlike very devastating to express\nemotions so you know for example I\nremember when my dad passed away\nlike all of the men from our Social\nCircle told me to be strong\nand they're like you know be strong I'll\nlook be strong be strong be strong now\nit's time for you to be strong be strong\nbe strong be strong and I was like I\ndidn't really understand what that meant\nI didn't understand what being weak in\nthis situation like what does that mean\nright is that like\nwhen people come over and I'm carrying a\npitch of water pitcher of water over to\nlike serve people who are visiting after\nmy dad passed away does being strong\nmean I'm Gonna Fill Up four pictures and\nlike carry four pictures because I'm\ngonna be strong\nor does it mean like what what does that\neven mean so oftentimes especially in my\nculture it sort of means like don't\nexpress negative emotion\nso for people who have difficulty\nopening up let's understand this so if\nyou are trying to open up to someone\nelse and you feel afraid\nwhere does the brain and the mind learn\nfear\nright so we have some kinds of\ninstinctive fears so like human beings\nare instinctively afraid of like snakes\nfor example but when it comes to\ninterpersonal interactions a lot of the\nfears that we have are based on our\nexperiences\nso if you want sort of\nunderstanding and you want power over\nyour ability to open up which you've\nreally got to understand is where does\nthis come from\nwhat you know where did you learn to be\nafraid of opening up and as you sort of\ndiscover that it can change your\nperspective in the moment because then\nyou realize okay like I actually don't\nhave a problem opening up to this person\nnow there's a part of my mind that is\nwarning me based on the past that\nsometimes this hasn't gone well\nso like I acknowledge that now like my\nmind is on high alert and it's actually\nlooking out for me once you recognize\nthat that's what your mind is doing\nit'll help you open up a lot\nthe last thing that we're going to talk\nabout and this is the one that's kind of\nbizarre\nbut will hopefully change the your\nperspective completely\nso when we look at this post on opening\nup let's take a quick look I want to\npoint out a couple things to you the\nfirst is how to have the courage to open\nup\nso how does this person think about\nopening up\nthey think about as a weakness that\nneeds to be overcome\nright there's negative emotion right\nhere\nsecond thing is I have a strong sense of\nnot wanting to burden people about my\nproblems and that's very common right\nI don't think they're Worthy\nso I don't want to burden another human\nbeing so what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to journal\nI'm going to become aware\nI'm gonna I want to feel better and rely\non myself\nso if we look at opening up to other\nhumans\nit's kind of weird\nbut we think about it as an internal\nthing how do I have the courage to open\nup\nhow do I overcome this weakness\nI don't want to burden other people so\nhere's the key thing to understand when\nit comes to opening up to other people\nit's no longer\na solo game\nsuddenly there's a relational component\nSo when you say I don't want to burden\nother people that's where the way that\nyou resolve that is not through courage\nyou don't overcome your fears of\nburdening other people\nthere's a relational component so what\nyou do is talk to them\nask for permission\nask for feedback\nhey\nis it okay ask for permission if I talk\nto you about something that's like I'm\nstruggling with right now\nso the whole point of opening up to\nanother human being is it's a relational\nthere's a relational component to it it\nnow involves more than one person and\nwhat we try to do is solve all the\nanxieties in our head without ever\ninteracting with the other person\nand so here I am trying to overcome all\nthese like oh my God I don't want to\nburden people how do I get over this\nfeeling of not wanting to burden people\nwhereas like you can deal with it very\nvery easily if you just ask them hey\nwhen I talked to you last week about\nyou know how I'm having trouble with my\nsignificant other did you feel like that\nissue was silly or did you feel burdened\nby it I sometimes feel guilty because\nlike I'll talk to you about things and\nyou know I don't think like you can\nactually do anything to help me is it\nokay if I have that kind of conversation\nwith you how does it feel when we talk\nabout something like this\ndo you feel burdened do you think this\nis silly like what's going on there like\nhow what's your experience of this\nconversation\nand so the cool thing is that you don't\nactually have to have the courage to\nlike overcome all that stuff since this\nis relational you can just ask the other\nperson hey is it okay\nfor us to talk a little bit I've got\nsomething going on right now and I kind\nof need to unload\nand what's really cool is that this\nperson is actually doing this\nI feel like I know the right answer I've\nread so much self-help and do everything\non my own maybe this is my way of\nsharing or just to process things\nI already have the urge of wanting to\ndelete this basically this person is\nasking for permission on Discord they're\npracticing it right here\nis it okay that I'm doing this\nand so this is the key thing to really\nunderstand about having the courage to\nopen up with other people\nis that like at the end of the day it\nyou don't have to figure it out all on\nyour own that's the whole Advantage\nabout having a relationship is that you\ncan ask for permission and once they\ngive you the green light it'll do so\nmuch for your internal anxieties because\nanytime you're struggling to open up\nwith someone I don't know if this kind\nof makes sense but you're struggling\nwith two things one is the thing that\nyou want to talk about and one is the\nadditional emotional burden of like\nputting it on someone else\nand so the reason it's so hard is\nbecause you're carrying both of these\nemotional burdens there's not only the\noriginal thing which is hard to deal\nwith there's like now I've got a burden\nsomeone else with it I gotta feel silly\nand there's all this other crap and this\nis what actually gets in the way\nand so by sort of asking for permission\nby asking for feedback by acknowledging\nthat this is a relationship by not\ntrying to solve all this on your own you\ncan actually deal with this completely\njust by asking for permission and then\nlike you come over here and then you can\nshare your thing\nthe cool thing is that when you do this\nit actually can deepen your relationship\nright so that's where afterward there\nshould also be feedback from you hey I\nreally appreciate you talking to me last\nweek I felt a lot better thank you so\nmuch so instead of feeling guilty\nappreciate and then say hey my door's\nalways open if there's anything that you\nwant to talk about you know I'm happy to\nlisten\nand then like now you've done something\nreally cool which is that you've crossed\nthis bridge and then you've left it open\nfor them to cross back and that's how\nyou deepen relationships and as you form\ndeeper relationships it becomes easier\nto open up\nright so that's how to really get the\nball rolling so it's a really common\nproblem that people have in terms of\nhaving Not Having the courage to open up\nand it starts with some pretty simple\nstuff which is all internal right so\nhaving awareness\nof what you're feeling\nbeing able to sort of identify sit with\nwhat you're feeling Etc\ndiscovering kind of\num is starting really small\nsort of discovering the source of\ndiscomfort discovering where you learned\nthat opening up is a bad idea but the\nthing that's really going to be a game\nchanger is that oftentimes as we open up\nthere's a relational component that we\ndon't consider we think that overcoming\nthis fear of opening up is something I\nhave to do on my own but the whole point\nis that when we're opening up it's\nthere's a relational element to it\nthere's another human being and they can\nhelp you with that\nso ask for permission ask for feedback\nExpress appreciation that'll make it way\neasier\nquestions\nlesbian 04 say I'm so happy I discovered\nDr k a few days ago welcome lesbian04\nokay that's a good question the legend\nof mercurius saying how do we motivate\nsomeone else to open up when they seem\nclosed off or isolated\nso when someone else seems closed off or\nisolated\num\nwe don't necessarily want to motivate\nthem what we want them to do is feel\nsafe\nso what I'd say is like the way that you\nget people to open up is by opening a\ndoor for them and letting them walk\nthrough it if they want to or not you\njust want to make it clear to them that\nthe door is open for them\nso oddly enough like I think it's almost\nlike instead of motivating them we want\nto be like a vacuum right so we want to\ncreate like a negative space where they\ncan come in and fill it in if they feel\nlike it\nso it's about making them feel safe as\nopposed to motivating them to open up\nthe other thing that you can do if\nsomeone's closed off is just ask them\nhey I'm noticing that you're a little\nbit quieter today\ndo you just need a little bit of space\nare you like doing okay like or is there\nsomething that\nyou know you're anything I can help with\nso just kind of don't\nassume what's going on but just point\nout the observation like just make an\nobservation which is that hey I'm\nnoticing you're quieter today\nif there's something going on\nhappy to help and if you're just kind of\nlike\nkind of taking it easy today that's\ntotally fine too right so we want to be\nlike we want to open the door we want to\ngive them the opportunity to walk\nthrough it I wouldn't go digging and\ntrying to get them to open up\nso Rockwell is asking what if I don't\nask for permission if I open up throw my\nstuff at someone else and only ask how\nthey felt about it at the end that's\ntotally fine\nright so it's not ideal but I think it's\ncompletely acceptable\nso like if you unload on it I wouldn't\nask them right then and there I'd\nactually Circle back the next day and\nsay hey I kind of opened up\nyou know in the future like maybe I\nshould check in with you before I do\nthat what was that like for you\nthat's what I so like here's the thing a\nlot of times when it comes to\ninterpersonal interactions we try to be\nperfect from the get-go\nright like we try to be like okay I'm\ngonna do that I'm going to do a b c d e\nin this order and it's gonna be perfect\nabout relationships is that like people\ndon't behave perfectly it's it's totally\nfine to go back later and try to fix\nsomething if you think it was a problem\nnow that doesn't well is some of the\nDamage Done sure there are people not\ngoing to like it potentially\nbut like the strategy that you want is\nthe one that's gonna you know be the\nbest for the most number of people which\nis like you can always apologize for\nsomething later if you didn't don't\nthink you handled it well if anything\nit'll signal to the person that you're\nthoughtful about things aren't going to\nlet things slip under the rug and that\nyou value the relationship\nif someone comes to you and says hey I'm\nsorry you know if I screwed something up\njust kind of checking in like how is\nthat person going to receive that\nhopefully they'll receive that as oh\nlike this person values this\nrelationship and they're thoughtful\nabout it\nand they'll hopefully try to maintain it\nhow do you deal with the guilt of\nshutting someone down who opens up too\nmuch with you great question so I think\nthat's where\nhow can I say this\nso sometimes we have a friend who opens\nup too much\nand\nwe have to remember what the role of the\nrelationship is\nso if this is a friend friendships tend\nto be reciprocal and sometimes what\nhappens is people who have emotional\nneeds\nwill get their emotional needs met\nthrough a relationship\nwhich is part of what a relationship is\nbut sometimes it becomes a primary part\nof the relationship or it becomes this\nis what's more devastating the primary\nway we get our emotional needs met so\nI'll give you all just a simple example\nI've worked with some people who are\nkind of like codependent or at least one\nperson is dependent and so this person\nhas a strong feeling of loneliness right\nI'm terrified of being alone\nand so what they can do is actually\nsmother their partner because then their\nromantic partner is not just a romantic\npartner the Romantic partner has the\nburden of solving my loneliness\nand once I place that burden on them and\nthey set any kind of limits with me\nthey're gonna feel guilty\nbecause now if they say no to me now I'm\nfeeling alone whereas the real problem\nis that the Romantic partner is there to\nalleviate some amount of loneliness\nbut when it comes to our own emotional\nneeds another human being is not\nresponsible for all of them\nand so if you're shutting someone down\nwho\nyou know is opening up too much to you\nthat's where you've got to start\nthinking a little bit about your own\nemotional needs and what's the limit of\nthis relationship and it's okay to like\nyou know like\nhave a boundary around that and still\ncare about the person this is what's\nreally confusing to people is a lot of\ntimes people will feel guilty for\nsetting a boundary\nso I care about my patients a lot like\nyou know we do a lot of really really\ndeep work together but I also don't\ninvite them over for Christmas because\nthat's not appropriate and some of them\nare alone during Christmas and do I feel\na little bit guilty for that yes\nand at the same time there's like a\nboundary between you know my family and\nmy patients even though I care about\nthem both\nand so in that same way like you can set\nlimits on people and then you may feel\nguilty and that's where like I don't\nthink it's you know it's about\nunderstanding okay why do I feel guilty\nhow did we fall into this situation\nwhere I have become the primary source\nof like venting for this person\nthe other reason that you can feel\nguilty is because oftentimes when\nsomeone becomes like\nwhen someone is venting on you in a very\ndependent way\nit doesn't actually improve their life\nover time\nso they'll come to you they'll vent vent\nvent vent a day goes by a week goes by\nthey're venting a month goes by they're\nventing six months go by they're venting\na year goes by they're venting and like\nthey've started to become so dependent\non you as an emotional like\nDumping Ground that they don't actually\ntake the steps in their life to prevent\nthose emotions from piling up again\ndoes that make sense\nand so that can be like then you can\nstart burning out as a friend and then\nyou have to set limits on that because\nlike they're totally fine because\nthey've found someone to take out the\ntrash\nso they keep on accumulating single-use\nPlastics at an astronomical rate because\nthey've got you coming to their house\nevery day and emptying the trash\nand then like if you don't show up to\nempty the trash then their house fills\nup with trash\nand then you feel guilty because you've\nsomehow stepped into the role of like\nbeing responsible for keeping their\nhouse clean\nso it's really tricky\nbut try to understand how did this\npattern develop what is really my role\nin this relationship some of it is\nemotional support but is this reciprocal\nis this person becoming dependent on me\nright and the other thing to acknowledge\nis that you have emotions and needs too\nand you don't have to be a Dumping\nGround for someone else\nokay so for meditation for the day\nI want to share something cool with\ny'all\nOkay so\nwe're going to do a meditation today\nabout emotions okay\nand what we're going to do is recognize\nthe physicality of emotions\nso a lot of people don't really know\nwhat they're feeling and that makes a\nlot of sense because we don't really\nteach people\nhow to\nname what they're feeling how to isolate\nwhat they're feeling\nso it turns out that there's a paper\nfrom the our favorite Journal\npenis\nthe proceedings of the natural Academy\nof Sciences okay that talks about the\nmaps of subjective feelings\nso the cool thing is they looked at a\nhundred emotions\nand what they did is actually look at\nwhere these emotions or experiences map\nonto the body\nso blue is negative emotion for example\nso social exclusion is felt here and\nhere ostracism is felt here and here\npanic is felt somewhere else discussed\nthis felt somewhere else\ndespise something hostility losing is\nfelt somewhere else shame is felt\nsomewhere else do you guys see how each\nof these is actually like a little bit\ndifferent\nso what we're gonna do today\nis y'all can this is a a paper that's in\nthe public domain so y'all can download\nit\num it's called maps of subjective\nfeelings\nbut there's also other kinds of emotions\nthat we can feel like you know illnesses\nwill create certain things\num they're also places where we feel\nhomeostatic uh feelings like hunger\nthirst feeling full\num and then there's some like other\nweird things like being dazzled sleeping\nVitality urinating forgetting where do\nwe feel for getting in our body where do\nwe forget in our body\nthey're a cognitive experiences as well\nthere are positive emotions\num you know like where's laughing where\nis happiness so laughing is more in the\nbelly happiness is more in the heart\npleasure is actually more in the head\nlove is also like more diffusely through\nthe heart\num\nsexual arousal is I guess not surprising\nin the loins\nwhere do we feel longing for\nsocial longing so that all of these\nthings there's actually been a study\nwhere they've mapped this\nto a particular part of the body like\nthat's pretty cool right\nso what we're going to do is actually\ncombine this with a meditation\nso what I want you all to do the next\ntime you're trying to understand\nsomething about emotions\nwhat I want you all to do is\nadopt a meditative posture and notice\nwhere in the body you feel the emotion\nso there are two ways to do this\npractice one is when you're feeling\nemotional if you can actually take a\nbreak and do a quick meditative practice\nwhat I do is sit up straight\nokay\nback straight neck straight head\nstraight\nwe're going to close our eyes and we\nwant to be careful here because we don't\nnecessarily want to do a whole lot of\ncontrolled breathing\nbecause there's evidence that shows that\nbreathing is associated with the\nalteration of emotion this is why we'll\nsort of tell people to take three deep\nbreaths and things like that so we want\nto be very careful about controlling our\nbreathing so we don't actually want to\nbreathe deep we just want to close our\neyes and notice\nwhatever Sensations arise as we feel a\nnegative emotion\nso this is going to be tricky because\nwhen you close your eyes the first thing\nthat you're going to want to do is\nbreathe\nso if you find that closing your eyes\nAlters your breathing you can actually\nopen your eyes and just focus on the\nsensation\nso try to really do a scan from the top\nof your head to the bottom of your feet\nand just notice what signals you're\ngetting from your body in this moment\nand then we'll also go into the second\nway to do this practice which is if\nyou're not feeling emotional in the\nmoment you can recall\na period of time hopefully recently\nwhere you felt very emotional\nand really try to remember what it was\nlike to be in that moment\nand what I want you all to do is be very\nmethodical start at the top of your head\nkind of notice in my head am I feeling\nsomething\nand go to the throat\neven top of the throat middle of the\nthroat bottom of the throat\nmove to the chest\nand try to notice is it more on the left\nor the right\nis it more on the outside of the chest\nor more centrally\ndoes you feel it more in the front or in\nthe back\nand then move down to the stomach the\nabdomen\nand where do you feel it in the abdomen\nonce again more on the outside more in\nthe center\ntop or bottom\ndeep in the stomach or more on the\nsurface\nwhere exactly is the pit of your stomach\nwhere do you feel the butterflies of\nyour stomach\nthen you can go to the limbs\narms\nlegs\nyou may notice tension in the back\nthe desire to clench your fists\nand even in your body maybe like in your\nback the desire to curl in\njust notice what\nwhere you scan your body and try to find\nwhatever feeling you can put your hands\non\nand remember you don't have to figure\nout what the feeling is just scan the\nbody\nand now that we're sort of\nyou've isolated it\nyou may notice first of all that this\nprocess\nalleviates it some which is okay side\nbenefit I suppose is alleviates your\nnegative emotions or positive emotions\nremember you can do this with negative\nor positive emotions\nso if you all have a pet or child or\nsomething like that or loved one and\nyou're kind of laying down and they're\nlike laying with you and you feel\npeaceful and content like where do you\nfeel that contentment if you're laying\non the beach and you're content where\ndoes that contentment exist within you\nand then the cool thing is that you all\ncan go to this paper from the\nproceedings of the natural Academy of\nSciences\nand then you can map it on and you can\nsee okay like what where where is this\nemotion actually existing so where did\nyou feel it\nso we may notice that like aching\nshivering itching so these are all\nphysical Sensations\nbut that social exclusion and ostracism\nhave slightly different\num\nlocations right loneliness depression\neven loneliness is like a little bit\ndifferent\nso social exclusion is a little bit more\nfaint loneliness is a little bit more in\nthe head and stronger over here\nostracism is stronger over here\nbut a little bit less so in the head\nso even between these three kinds of\nthings\nwe can actually feel like subtle\ndifferences\nand this is a great way to like\nunderstand what your emotions are\nbecause what if if you're someone who\nstruggles to like put names to your\nemotions even you know ostracism versus\nsocial isolation versus loneliness we\nmay jumble all those three things up\ntogether so by using techniques like\nthis we can start to increase the\nsophistication of our emotional\nmeasurements\nand as we increase the sophistication of\nour emotional measurements\nwill gain awareness over them and if we\nagree with the yogis awareness is the\nfirst step to control or power over\nsomething and the simplest way to\nunderstand that is like even if we're\ntalking about emotions when we numb\nthings\nthrough practices like video games\npornography and whatnot substances of\nabuse\nas we numb those things all those\nfeelings kind of go away but even though\nthey go subsurface they continue to\nexert their presence on us\nright they continue to impact our\nmotivation they continue to make us\nisolated because we're ashamed of how we\ncompare to other people at this party\nthey continue to subtly influence all\naspects of our life\nand so if we want to reverse that\nprocess if you want to get over this it\nstarts by sort of understanding your\nemotions\nthe other really cool thing that happens\nis when we do this practice and we're\nable to like discover our emotions what\nwe're actually doing is calling them up\nand not retreating from them\nand as we call up emotions and don't\nretreat from them this gives us the\nadded advantage of being able to\ntolerate emotions because people will\nask how do I sit with emotion it's so\npainful\nand this is going to be a beautiful way\nto start sitting with emotion because\nthat's what you're literally doing\nyou're calling it up you're summoning a\nnegative emotion so that you can explore\nit and if you do that enough then what\nyou'll realize and discover is oh\nactually this is a thing that does not\nneed to be feared\nI do not need to fear social isolation\nand paradoxically it's the social\nisolation that actually keeps you at\nhome it's that emotion which controls\nthe behavior so so many benefits can\nsort of Bloom out of\nan increased awareness of your emotions\nand this is a great technique to start\nwith that"
