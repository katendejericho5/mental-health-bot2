    "transcript": "and so the tricky thing though is that\nlike this translation that zell alluded\nto that there's like there may be some\namount of scientific truth out there but\nwhen it comes to applying it to our\nindividual situation like that's where\nthings get tricky and there we go\nokay hey\nwelcome everyone how's everybody doing\ntoday\ni'm good thank you good\ngood i'm glad\nfinally\nit's nice to have you\num\nso\nwelcome everyone to week three so i\nnoticed we have a new face\nso i think we should go ahead and\nprobably do introductions\nbut before we do introductions let's\nactually start to think about\num so we'll have ms ashrox introduce\nherself and then what we're gonna do as\nthe group\nis try to orient\nher to what we're doing here\nso if y'all remember a little bit about\nlike what the scope of this is what the\ngoal of this is what our\nresponsibilities are\nbecause i'm sure you all can imagine it\ncan be a little bit strange to come in\nyou know after we've gotten started but\nyou're still totally in the early phase\nso it's like not a big deal at all\nso um what we ask in terms of\nintroductions is why don't we go ahead\nand introduce ourselves\nand then um we can share a little bit\nabout what's\nyou know where people can find us so\nlike what kind of streaming we do what\nkind of content creation we do\nand um\nif there's anything in particular that\nyou want to work on over the next few\nweeks we can sort of share that as well\nso i'll go ahead and\nyou want you want to start\nsure why not\nwelcome in everybody to the you know\nbeautiful massage rocks all right\nwelcome no i'm kidding but um i'm miss\nhatchbacks i'm a twitch partner twitch\nambassador i've been streaming for\nsix years now it's been a very long time\nand i usually play video games that's my\nmain form of content but i'm diving into\nmore lifestyle mental health\nand\ni'm really excited for everything that\nhas to come so\nusually i stream late nights because i\nwork full time at tiltify as their\ncommunity manager so that's where you'll\ncatch me in a daytime on their twitch\nchannel talking with different charities\nand different fundraisers and for the\nnext few weeks i want to prioritize\nunderstanding my feelings more and how\nto\ncombat imposter syndrome\nbecause that's what i've been struggling\nwith lately so that's my goal\nand i'm happy to be here thank you so\nmuch for having me\nwelcome\nthank you so much for being here\nwho's going next\nuh i can go next\num so hello everyone uh my name is\nmichael otherwise known as smirky um\ni've been a decade-long content creator\nuh\nlgbtqia plus variety streaming\nspecialized in a game called toontown\nwhich used to be a former disney mmo\nalongside games like club penguin and\npirates of the caribbean online and like\nback back during your early childhood if\nif you know you know um but basically um\ni love playing games with other people\nmultiplayer games interactive\nexperiences with a bit of sprinkle in\nsingle-player you know games and a\nvariety of genres as well whether it's\nlike a party game or rpg game or\nanything like that um and i also do a\nbit of charity work as well and i\nfundraise on platforms like tiltify um\nto raise money for lots of amazing\ncauses that are important to our\ncommunity um\nand uh\nyeah uh that's all i can think of saying\nright now so i'll just keep it short and\nsweet like that cool\nokay\nnext\nor no you got it if you want\ndo i sound okay\ni didn't get to do an audio check\ni do okay i'm good uh hi i'm metric\nseconds reporting live from stolen wi-fi\noutside of a pharmacy\num\ni uh\nrecently\ndamaged a tendon in my foot and\nwalking has not been fun\num so\nmy folks helped me with it and that's\nwhy i'm not home\nbut uh i've been\nstreaming for almost six years\nand specialize in strategy games\nespecially darkest dungeon\nrecently switched to variety and\nyeah\noverall\nfeeling the burnout from doing one game\na lot\nand\nkind of trying to figure out where to go\nfrom there\nso\ngreat\nhello\nmy name is ruby true and i stream um\nwellness mindfulness kind of content\num i stream asmr and sound baths\num yeah if it's relaxing and it's chill\nthen it's basically my jam\nand\num\nyeah considering the content i stream i\ni was thinking about this earlier this\nweek i want to say stop saying i suffer\nwith or struggle with\ni have anxiety\num\nand adhd i don't struggle or suffer with\neither of them that's something i'm\nreally working on\nsaying out loud and uh yeah just\nlearning to\nmanage those things and help other\npeople have good lives and manage those\nthings themselves that's my aim\ncool\nokay um\nwhat's up i'm zell uh i\nam a streamer slash youtube person\num most people have seen me from various\nthings like offline tv or all chat back\nwhen that was a show at uh riot games\nand i have done work in the magic the\ngathering space as well and um been\nfeatured on uh youtube channels like the\ncommand zone um\nfor my personal stream i stream video\ngames uh i talk a lot about anime uh\nthat's like my\nthang i guess uh but then\nyeah uh stuff that i want to work on\nbasically everything but uh i think\nyou know i'm just here to\nget a little bit more grounded and and\nstuff and like i'm somebody who is\nalways doing a lot of different things\nand maybe uh i should be focusing on\nspecializing more um\nso yeah that's uh that's that's me\nawesome\nokay so thank you all very much for\nintroduction so my name is olik i'm\nknown as dr k i'm a psychiatrist by\ntraining um and i stream on\nhealthygamergg\nwe do a lot of mental health related\ncontent and the reason i started\nstreaming was because i noticed that\ni was having the same conversation in my\noffice over and over and over again and\nthat that conversation wasn't actually\nclinical so it was like teaching\n40 people like the same general concepts\nand and so i just had the question about\nyou know can i have this conversation\npublicly and can people benefit from it\nand so that's how we got started and i\nlove gaming and stuff but i don't get to\nstream that quite as much\nhopefully that'll change in the next\ncouple of months but we will see\nso who wants to who can tell us or maybe\ntell um and miss ashrox what do you go\nby\num\nmiss ash ash okay those are perfect\num so\nwho how can we help\nmizash\ntry to but how can we help orient her to\nlike what what are we doing here\nlike what is this\nwe're developing tools to\novercome our hurdles as\ncontent creators\nlike\nemotionally and\ndealing with the stress of it all i\nguess\ncool\nanyone want to add on to that or\nshare a different perspective\nwhen i think of words i'm not having a\ngood word today um\n[Laughter]\nwe're supporting each other\nand helping each other to be able to\nfind our similarities and differences so\nthat\nin sharing\nwe can\nyou know find\nthings that help\nourselves\num\nand\nyeah that's that's kind of the gist\ncool\nyeah and there's a variety of different\ntopics that we're\ndiscussing\nin\npursuit of that i guess goal to kind of\num\nyou know better\nbut\nto to kind of i guess like relate to one\nanother have discussions about like uh\nthe realm of content creation and you\nknow there are different things that we\nall go through each of our communities\nare unique we all come from different\nbackgrounds things like that\nbut in that we can also um\nfind things that are really meaningful\nto each of us\nthrough a lot of the conversations that\nwe do have here\ni think i'm caught up to speed i got\nthis\nawesome\nyou got this so what about some of the\nparticulars like who's responsible for\nchange in the group\nall of us\nyeah all of us right\ni don't know what was what was ash about\nto say\nhold ourselves accountable i mean at the\nend of the day we have to\nuse those steps and whatever we learn\nand apply it to our day-to-day\nto prioritize our mental health more\nin this space\ncool\nand and how does this like work like\nwhat do we do on a week to week basis\nlike what's the structure\nit looks like we have\nyep so it does look like we have\nhomework\nand i mean do we just like kind of show\nup here and talk about our feelings for\nan hour and a half and then we're kind\nof is that what this is\nno\nwhat is it then\nif we were to sit here and just talk\nabout our feelings we're not gonna move\nforwards\nit's just kind of like a\nventing which\npart of it can be that but it's\nunderstanding\nwhen that venting needs to take a turn\nand also\nequally share\nthe the sharing and the conversation so\nthat it leads in a direction to\ni don't want to find answers say answers\nbut these in a direction to find\nsolutions\nto help us understand\nourselves better and each other better\num to become better content creators\nand people\nanyone want to add on to that or have\nsomething that they want to share\nokay\nis al did you have something\nuh no actually\ni'm leaving\ni'm just kind of i'm just kind of\nnodding like you know i think people\nhave covered it i mean yeah like uh we\nhave homework we have some uh structured\nlike topics to kind of unify around and\nshare our different perspectives on and\nthe hope is i think through that shared\nexperience we come away with uh\nactionable um things that we can take to\nthen\nchange about ourselves or you know help\nourselves and uh and yeah and we're\naccountable for that so\ngreat so what i'd love to do is just\ntake a couple of minutes to\ntry to kind of formally summarize i\nthink you all have said all the\nimportant stuff\nbut um part of what i think my role is\nis that there is a lot of like let's say\nscience or experience or certain medical\nconcepts psychological concepts which\nmay apply to our discussions so for\nexample there's research on imposter\nsyndrome there are particular things\nthat people with imposter syndrome do\nand so part of what i'm going to be\ntrying to do a little bit is to share\nsome of that information with y'all and\nthen we're going to kind of try to work\nwith it so the first thing that i'm\ngoing to kind of start off with because\ni love what ruby mentioned about venting\nso is to just\nkind of outline a model for a change\nso like\nthis is going to sound kind of weird but\nlike\nwhy is life hard\nbecause we make it hard how do we make\nit hard\nwe over complicate everything\nhow how does that work\nwhy do we do that\nwhat's the difference between me over\ncomplicating something and me\nsimplifying something therefore it\nbecomes easy\nlike why don't we just make everything\nsimplifying why don't we simplify\neverything and make everything easy for\nourselves\nbecause we want better ourselves\nhonestly\nand\nand i think we expect\nthings to go in our way every time like\nevery situation we expect it to go our\nway and when it doesn't\nthen we\nbreak down and then we don't know how to\nkind of compile those feelings\nokay in my opinion okay i know that\nhappens\npersonally\ni mean not no it's not awesome i\ni i have this problem\nwhere when someone says something\ninsightful i applaud it but oftentimes\nwhat they say is like negative so it's\nnot awesome that things fall apart for\nyou\nbut it's awesome that you're\narticulating that and understanding that\nso i apologize for that\nyou're fine\ni was gonna say\noh sorry so\nno you got it you got it\num i was gonna say i think we often over\ncomplicate things because\nwe\nfeel like\nwe should know what we're doing and we\nshould\nhave everything figured out\nand\nby putting expectations upon ourselves\nwe don't\nshare our\n[Music]\ni don't want to call them weaknesses\num but like\nthe internet is very good at only\nshowing like the highlight reel\nand it's easy to compare ourselves to\nsomeone else's highlight reel\nand as a content creator\nit's very easy to\nsee numbers\nsee success i put it in inverted\nfinger commas\nbecause someone can appear successful\nbut\nbe very unhappy or struggling and\ni think that's where as content creators\nspecifically\nwe over complicate things because we\ndon't reach out or people believe they\nshould be\nin a better place they'd live up to\ntheir name or and things like that so\nit can be a quick spiral\nyeah i think to kind of add to that a\nlittle bit is just like we go through\nlife without any sort of comparison\npoint you know we can only experience\nthe things that we experience and\ntherefore like it's hard to go through\nand understand success metrics that work\nfor you that will work for everyone\nright so it's not like it's not like a\nmath problem right like the key to\nsuccess isn't this thing that you it has\nlike unified rules around it and so yeah\ni think we we over complicate things\nbecause\nyou know we are complicated people and\nuh you know no solution kind of applies\nto everything about us specifically uh\nreally and so like i think that's what\nthe over complication comes from is that\nwe try to apply our unique circumstances\nto potentially simple problems and over\ncomplicate them that way\ni've got a question\nfor zell or anyone else so he says that\nlike you know we have no like we only\nlive our life right like i don't\nso as he put it we have no points of\ncomparison where do our expectations\ncome from\ni think they come from like media\nconsumption right that's uh i think\nthat's part of it is like we\nconsume\nmedia on the internet or whatever and we\napply that stuff\nwhether consciously or unconsciously to\nour own lives and then we create\nexpectations around them also just\nthrough lived-in experiences through the\npeople around us so like we take in\nthings from our family as we grow up or\nour friends and those give us you know\nsmall comparison points as well um\nso honestly just life around you\ni guess okay\nso like i'm gonna kind of point out\nsomething that i heard and i'm curious\nwhat y'all think about that and we're\ngoing off on a tangent by the way\nso\nzell saying like\nlife is hard because we only live our\nlife\nbut we have these like we have no like\npoints of comparison right we can't live\nin someone else's shoes so we can't sort\nof figure out a universal formula for\nsuccess\nbut what we need\nand so that's why life is hard because\nwe go like looking for things but we we\nhave our own unique bundle of advantages\nand disadvantages\nand yet we create expectations based on\nthings outside of us\nit's like how what happens when we do\nthat\nlike if i'm a unique person who has\nadvantages and disadvantages i have a\nparticular spawn point\nright when i rolled this life on this\nearth\ni got a particular gender a particular\nrace a particular ethnicity a particular\nlocation a particular socioeconomic\nstatus\na particular set of parents\nand then\nmy expectations seem to come from people\nthat are not in my specific spawn\nso what does that do for us like what\nwhat happens\nwhen i have expectations that come from\nmedia family etc\ni think we\nwe we attempt to apply them to ourselves\nas if they were our spawn points as you\nput it and so but then the reality is\nsometimes it's it's just different right\nlike it doesn't necessarily apply and\nthat delta between your expectation of\nwhat you\nwant that you're trying to compare\nyourself to and your actual self are too\nyou know those things can be a big thing\nand those differences in expectation can\ncause a lot of like\ni don't know stress\nand mental damage okay\nso did y'all catch when ash was talking\nshe said something about expectations\ndid y'all catch what she said about\nexpectations\nash do you remember what you said anyone\ncan\ni don't think i remember what i said\nyeah\nso that brings up another good point so\npart of what we're also going to be\ndoing here is training specific skills i\ndon't expect you all to\nremember what everyone says at every\nmoment\nso ash had said something but over time\nwe're going to like literally become\nbetter listens listeners okay\nso ash said that she has expectations\nfor herself this is sort of in relation\nto like the venting conversation or we\nkind of segued that way so she has\nexpectations\nsometimes doesn't live up to those\nexpectations\nthere is some kind of consequence\nlet's call it emotional damage\nand then kind of you feel bad about\nyourself because you didn't live up to\nthings\nruby also alluded to this when she\ntalked about like oh i should do\nparticular things right\nand when i hear a should i hear an\nexpectation y'all with me there\nthose two are the same things\nand then we're sort of left with like\nthis pile of unhappiness\nand so\nthis is really important to understand\nso if we wanna if we wanna think about\nwhy life is complicated it's because\nwe don't i'm gonna sort of offer\nsomething okay this is a hypothesis\nso i would say that oftentimes if you\nthink about situations in your life\nwhere like you were struggling\ni would argue that you really didn't\nunderstand the situation\nso simple example of this is like if\nanyone's been through a breakup\nand you kind of think that the world is\nending when you're going through a\nbreakup and you'll be alone forever and\nand all this kind of stuff right and\nthen you don't know how to like take a\nstep back but a couple months later you\ntake a step back you kind of realize oh\nactually the breakup was probably good\nfor me in the long run we just weren't\nmeant to be together but there's kind of\na lack of understanding there may have\nbeen particular expectations around that\nrelationship which leads to a certain\namount of suffering\nso this is kind of how we run through\nlife that where we sort of don't\nunderstand stuff\nnow the other challenge that zell kind\nof pointed out is that we are\nindividuals with unique spawn points\nbut there are there is stuff like\nscience out there right so we do know\nthat like we're not all the while there\nmay not be a particular tutorial or walk\nthrough for your specific life there are\ngeneral mechanics around\nyou know what\nhow life works so we know that there's\nsome science around resilience some\nscience around emotional wellness some\nscience around performance\nand so the tricky thing though is that\nlike this translation that zell alluded\nto that there's like there may be some\namount of scientific truth out there but\nwhen it comes to applying it to our\nindividual situation like that's where\nthings get tricky\nso this is a precisely why we have the\nmodel that we use here at hg which is\nlike there's some amount of concrete\ninformation but applying it to an\nindividual\nrequires like individual exploration\nand so what we're trying to do here is\napplied learning\nso as opposed to reading a book which is\na one-size-fits-all solution\nor just going on a personal journey\nwhether that's a personal journey that's\nlike spiritual and i'm hiking in the\nhimalayas or i'm seeing a therapist or\ni'm just like you know journaling for a\nlong time what we have is a unique\nopportunity where we can work with each\nother so people can like piece together\ntheir experiences right so i get the\nsense that all of y'all have probably\nstruggled with expectation but we can\nsort of like talk to each other and the\nother really interesting thing is that\ni don't know if this kind of makes sense\nbut is it easier to see the problems in\nyour thinking or easier to see the\nproblems in someone else's thinking\nsomeone else's\nabsolutely i am anyways oh yeah right\nand so the cool thing is that ash may be\ntalking about all these expectations\nthat she has which are like completely\nlike based on inappropriate things that\nmedia has put in her head and the four\nof y'all are going to be able to see\nthat as clearly as day ash isn't going\nto be able to see it the cool thing\nthough is that once you see it in her\nit's going to be easier to see within\nyourself\nso the problem with solo\nexploration\nis that your mind is biased\nso what we're going to try to do is\ninquire with each other we're going to\ntry to bring stuff out of each other but\nin doing so we're going to understand\nlike the rules of the game\nmake sense\nthat's kind of what we're doing here\nlast point that i want to mention about\nventing so why we don't this isn't about\nventing but venting has a very important\npoint which is that when we're\nemotionally activated it's harder to see\nthings clearly\nso we are going to vent some\nbut the purpose of venting is very\nspecific it's not venting to nowhere\nit's venting to decompress some amount\nof emotion so that we can see things\nclearly so that we can understand so\nthat we can simplify and ultimately make\nour life easier does that make sense\nokay i'm gonna try to summarize with a\nformula and we can\nto support this formula we can offer\ncitations from science or ancient\nspiritual traditions or clinical work\ny'all\ntell me if you want more detail on any\nof those realms but here's basically why\nlife is hard\nthe first thing is we don't understand\nwhat we're doing\navidya or ignorance is the root of\nsuffering\nand like once you understand stuff i\ndon't know if you all kind of get this\nbut like once you understand something\nthings become just easier right once i\nunderstood that oh like you know whether\nit's a video game we're playing once you\nunderstand the rules it's like now it\nall makes sense\nso understanding is going to be our our\nkey goal what gets in the way of\nunderstanding is a compromised mind\nso when our mind is not functioning\nclearly\ndue to emotions or other kinds of things\nit's hard to see things\nso another role that we're going to have\nis to try to purify our mind so that we\ncan look at things clearly and once we\ncan look at things clearly we can\nunderstand things\nthe other problem that we run into\nis that how does our mind become impure\nso we've already figured that out\nbecause when we set an expectation for\nourselves that's unreasonable and then\nwe fail to live up to that expectation\nwhat does that do to my mind\nit causes emotions and things to get in\nthe way of you seeing clearly exactly\nright so expectation\nnot living up to expectation results in\nemotional damage emotional damage\nimpacts clarity of mind impact on\nclarity of mind leads to a lack of\nunderstanding of like what we're doing\nokay so then later maybe now maybe later\nwe'll see we're gonna dig into like\nwhere do expectations come from and how\ncan we on an individual level start to\nunderstand\nokay like\nwhat are like\nhow why do i expect this for myself\nand we'll discover a lot of other\ninteresting things like there's a\nhypothesis that having an expectation is\nthe source of suffering as well\nmake sense questions about any of this\nbecause that's what we're going to try\nto do okay\nso we we do have homework so i'm going\nto kind of pivot to that for a second\nand then i'll offer a couple of options\nabout how we want to spend our the next\nhour okay\nso we had homework which was assigned um\nash if you didn't do it no big deal or\nif no one did it that's totally fine too\nnot a big deal but generally speaking uh\nthe homework that the time that you'll\nput in between sessions will just help\nus advance things quicker okay\nso our homework for the week was to\nthink a little bit about uh do you all\nremember what it was\num yeah\nit was what do you want and what is\nholding you back great so why don't we\nkind of go around for show of hands who\nhad a chance to do the homework\nokay\nso let's just start with the three all\nthen no big deal if you didn't get a\nchance to do it so why don't you all\nshare with us in like two to five\nminutes like a summary of what do you\nwant and what's holding you back\nand for smirky and ash what i want you\nall to do is pay attention to what they\nsay\nand i want you all to think about okay\nif our goal today is to like understand\nwhat we want and what's holding us back\nwhat are some common themes we can\nexplore at the end of this like y'all\nare going to give us the direction or\ngive us options for the direction okay\ntake it away\ni'll go first so um\nwhen i think about what's holding me\nback um\ni kind of have this fear of the blank\npage\nuh\nwhether it was like you know in fine art\nor writing or anything creative\nthe moment i start it's like\nwhat's the point if the outcome is not\ngoing to be\nthe result i wanted\nand being result oriented basically just\nstops you\nbefore you really get there um\nand\ni mean part of that expectation problem\nin and of itself is\nuh i was one of those gifted kids who\nwas told that they were gonna go change\nthe world and stuff\nand uh\nyeah that did not happen\nso um\ni mean the gifted programs are really\nreally good for\nsetting up\nreally bad depression cases decades\nafter\nuh i'm sure tons of people could\nassociate with that if\nall they told you was you're super smart\nand you can do anything that's not true\ni mean you could be smart\nbut you can't do everything like it's\njust not happening\num\nso the moment that i hit something that\ni can't do immediately\nit's\noverwhelming\nand\nso just like initial difficulty breaking\nit down\ni immediately say to myself well you're\nsupposed to be smarter than us\nand that ain't true uh i guess\num\nthere's\nalso\nuh\none thing that my one of my best friends\ntold me is\ni struggle with my follow-through um\nlike\nso\ncommitting to making like tick tocks\nevery week or\nyou know making sure that i'm on time\nevery stream or or\num\neating right things like that it it\nbeing\nin the schedule and and making sure that\nit gets done\nlike i want those things\nbut\nthere's always something in the back of\nmy mind that says oh it's okay you know\nyou\nyou suck at this anyway\num\nand i don't necessarily forgive myself\nbut\ni just tell myself well you you were\ngonna fail\nso\ni guess\nthat's what kind of holds me back is i\nalready knew\nthat i was to mess up from the start so\nyeah\nhow is it what is it like to hear metric\nsay\nthat hard\nsaddening like i feel sadness for you\nto to feel those things about yourself\nis\ni can relate\nuh with following through it's oh there\ngoes\nsomething yeah i can relate with that um\ni'm supposed to post stick talk today oh\nit's fine i'll just do it tomorrow i\ndon't feel good enough to do it and you\njust feel like a failure all the time um\nbut we're not failures we're here to\nmake impact we're communities and it's\njust always that voice in the back your\nhead saying nope you're not good enough\nto do this today and you try again the\nnext day well not good enough to do it\nnext day still not good enough to do it\nso i can relate on that level\nabsolutely\nand it sucks\nwe have communities sorry\nwe have communities that love us and\nappreciate our work and\nit's still just that voice taught us no\nwe're not yeah like they're so\nsupportive and then like\nif you like are totally honest about\nthis stuff because like reaching back to\nlike authenticity\nyou know and being our authentic selves\nlike\ni want to be honest about how i feel\nit's like\nwhen i when i say like you know i really\nwant to stream this game\nbut i have no idea if anyone's going to\nwatch\nand then\nyou know a bunch of people say oh we\nwill totally but like\ni don't want to hold them to that that's\nlike it's not\nyou know so\nthat nobody is owed\nlike no no nobody owes me their time\num even if you say you're gonna be there\nlike\ngod knows it's like\nit's not your job to be in my stream\nright like\num and so\nmanaging what content i do how i change\nthings up\nlike\nthe other day i i did a darkest dungeon\nstream which you know i hadn't done in\nages and then\nsomebody came in and literally just said\ni'm here for darkest dungeon and that's\nlike my main game it kind of made me\nfeel like\nwell damn\nlike\ni'm not saying you got to be here for me\nor the community or anything else but\nit's like\ni didn't want to know that\nand then since you're so\nwe're we both are result oriented and\nthen we don't see those results it just\nmakes us backpedal even more when we\nshould keep pushing and be proud of our\nwork\nbecause\ni think\nyeah something else i have to learn not\nto be\nso heavy on the results and engagement\nfrom stuff i should just be proud of my\ncontent because the more you're proud of\nyour content proud of the stuff you're\ndoing that will attract more people\nyou have to be proud of yourself in\norder to succeed\nyou\nno\ni relate\ntotally\nokay so i'm gonna i guess one oh so one\nthing i forgot to include i'm sorry was\nlike i feel like there's like three\nkinds of people in this world which i\nknow is very reductive\nbut there's the people who like are\nwilling to put themselves out there\nwhich i think we're all kind of a part\nof\nyou know whether or not we're like\nintroverted irl or not but a part of us\nwants to put ourselves out there\nthere's people who like more or less\nconsume and judge and\ni'm not saying it's necessarily a bad\nthing but you know they're relatively\nquieter\num\nand maybe they don't want to be like you\nknow public creators or whatever and\nthat's fine\nbut there is a\ndefinitely a smaller group of people on\nthe other end who\nthey only publicly put anything out\nwhen\nthey need to tear something down\nand\nthat's like\nfor folks like us that's like the one\nthing that we have to work around and\nyou know a lot of people say well if\nyou're not willing to take like trolls\nor whatever then\nyou can't be doing this but there is\nlike a certain limit to how much you can\ntake\nso\nsometimes when i'm thinking about trying\nsomething new i think about like\nthose people more than say\na normal consumer of content\nbecause i'm more worried about them okay\nso\nyeah anyway\nso i'm gonna actually\ngive you all a choice so i know that we\njust have done one person's homework\nreview but\ni'm tempted to kind of go off on this\ntangent of expectations that we should\nput on ourselves this idea of being a\nfailure this idea of being results\noriented but i'll kind of leave it up to\nthe group do you all want to dig into\nthat or do we want to continue\ntalking about homework\num\ni'm kind of on homework but\nokay others like what do others want to\ndo\ngreat so let's continue with homework\nthen\ndid i do mine as i was the one that said\nare we just doing the what's holding us\nback a bit right now\nwhatever whatever you want to share from\nthe homework\nokay\nso i actually found\nthe homework very inspiring\num\nand i spent every day\nof the whole last two weeks\nworking on it\nnot in a physical way\nbut um\n[Music]\nin a mental way i spent every day\nre-looking at the questions\nand spent part of my\ndaily\npractice or whatever you want to call it\nfocusing in on\num\n[Music]\nmostly what's holding me back and then\nthat led to what i want\num\n[Music]\nso yeah i wrote i've been thinking about\nit for two weeks\nwhat was holding me back\nis now the question\ni know i've not completely\nworked through it and like you can't\njust like magic away\nthings but\num\n[Music]\nit's very similar to\nmetric and ash\nand what was holding me back was fear\nand self-judgment and finding excuses\nallowing others to affect my emotions\num\n[Music]\ni've recently\njust solved my house and i've moved back\nin with my parents for a short\nintermission before i move\nto another country so i'm in a different\nspace\num which throughout my yoga meditation\npractice because\nnot having private space um\n[Music]\ni found quite\nquite hard to to get back into that\npractice\num\nso i got myself back\ninto my some meditation practice um some\nasana\nand some pranayama\nand\ntaking pride in the knowledge that i\nhave and the things i worked on prior to\nthis point\nand knowing that i can\n[Music]\nbecause what was holding me back was\nnot being confident in my own knowledge\nthat i actually have a bit like how dr k\nis saying how does that feel to hear\nsomeone else\nsay those things about themselves and if\nit hurts and it's sad like it makes me\nsad to hear someone\num\neffectively like self-sabotaging\nin in\nways and\ni\nhave this practice of saying the things\ni'm feeling\nout loud to myself\nand then imagining if someone else was\nsaying that to you\nand i wouldn't let them\nif all the things you're saying to\nyourself you wouldn't let someone else\nsay to you then why are you letting them\nsay themselves say them to yourself and\nthis is something that i\npreach and i realize that i\ni can never be i i'm a human being i can\nnever be perfect\num\nand\nthis is a mindset that i've spent my\nwhole life kind of going\nand then like pulling myself back out up\nagain and then going in and\nand i can be in that mindset whilst i'm\non the hamster wheel and getting nowhere\nbut i feel like i'm trying to find or\nstarting to hit that place of is it\neustress\num\nand i forced myself to make a instagram\nreel that i'd wanted to make for about\ntwo years\nand it performed better than any of my\nother instagram reels because it was\nauthentic and\ni'm doing that thing and where i nearly\ncry about like\nsomething um because it was authentic\nand it came from a place of um\npassion i guess like people could tell\nfrom the real i hope\nthat it means a lot to me and\nyeah it was scary to press post\nbut posting it almost felt like ripping\noff a band-aid\nand\nopening up a new book\nof content creation for myself so yeah\nthat's the two weeks\num when i did my coaching with one of\nyour coaches dr k\nthey would leave me homework and then\nthey'd be like okay you've gone on to\nthe next homework and then you've gone\non to the next homework because once i\nsomething clicks like\ni have to keep going on it but that's\nhow i can easily get on the hamster\nwheel again as well i'm very aware that\nlike i can\ni can\ntake that feeling\nand then i actually wrote down like\nmaybe it's dopamine chasing as someone\nwith adhd\nand then i lose the direction so i'm i'm\ntrying to\nthink about this differently and focus\non it differently so yeah that was\nthat was my homework awesome\nhow did people uh\nhow do y'all feel listening to that\ni wish i could have done that\nso\nwhat is that feeling metric\nuh\nnot\nenvy's not appropriate i'm happy for her\nbecause like\nenvy implies like\nlike\ni don't know\nit feels like it takes away from the\nperson who achieves something\num so if it's if it's inappropriate to\nhave the feeling use the word\ninappropriate right\nright if it's inappropriate to have the\nfeeling that means you're not feeling\nthat correct\nno it's not that it's more like\ni mean i want that too but how do i\ni don't know if there's a word for\nyou know a positive feeling of\nwanting the same if there's a word for\nthat so\nsometimes when we\nsee someone else doing something and we\nare happy for them and we want it for\nourselves sometimes the word that we use\nis inspired\nis that what you're feeling though\nmetric are you feeling inspired\nyeah let's see yeah\nokay\nany other feelings\ni mean it's easy to go back on myself\nand be frustrated and think like well\nyou know\nwhy can't i think like that\nwhy\ni mean it's like what's holding me back\nit's like oh no i did the thing again so\num\ni don't know uh\nyeah all good stuff we'll we'll get\nwe'll figure it out metric\nany other any anyone else want to share\ntheir reactions to ruby's sharing\ni'm proud of you\nyou know you say you have anxiety and\nyou're up here\nspeaking in you know in front of\nhundreds of people about your experience\nand how you're working through it\nso it is inspiring and i think\nyou're very strong for that\nso\nthat's my reaction\nand i want to be like you when i grow up\nbut it is hard you know allowing\ni mean we're\ncontent creators it's hard\nnot getting feedback or you know seeing\ntroll messages and not getting engulfed\nwith them and\nallowing that to stop your content\ncreating so i'm proud you posted that\nreel there's plenty of content pieces\ni've been thinking about for the last\nsix years\nand i'm terrified of it\num but i think i have a unique\nexperience with being a black woman\nbecause i feel like the industry is\nconstantly\nagainst me\ni try not to let it get the best of me\nbut it's hard\nespecially when\nwell\nthis is why i stopped ex expecting\nthings because\nyou know you see your peers that don't\nlook like you\nget a certain amount of engagement or\nnumbers or something and you know you\nwon't get that back but you just keep\ntrying\nso that's my constant struggle i think\nin particular\nthat's what's holding me back so that's\nmy quick homework\nactually\nokay straight up the first time i ever\nheard of you\nwas\nthe trolling that you received when you\nwere doing gtarp\nwhich was like all racially motivated\nand everything and i was just like oh\nabsolutely like\nso yeah it's like i'm doing\nten thousand other wonderful things but\nthat's being highlighted of course i\npost like awareness but\nyeah\nand and i mean it's like yeah the i\nwould rather found out about you through\nyou know something positive that\nhappened to you or something that you\ndid\nrather than like\nyou know something that just sparked\noutrage across twitter so\nbut that's how this works too i guess so\nyeah\nin a constant battle of do i share this\nto spread awareness i mean people know\nthese things happen to us but\ni feel like i have to continue to talk\nabout it because people still don't\nbelieve like oh how are you getting\nracially targeted in games like what do\nyou mean\ndon't you live in this world it happens\nto us no\ni'm always in a constant battle of do i\npost do i post this should i share this\nand then i'm i have the mindset now of\njust not feeding into the hate and\nsharing it just sharing my wins the\npositive things\nand keeping up with that\nbut\ndoes someone\nfill us in in terms of what what we're\nreferring to\nlike what happened\noh\nwhat happened okay\nyeah totally\ni was playing gta rp\nin a new server this is my first time\ndoing rp i was really excited\num i'm not sure how i was targeted i\nthink the server wasn't really protected\nso anyone could join it\nso i was playing as the ems\nand i was picking up a body on a street\nand i got ran over by a truck and of\ncourse there's invoice in-game comms\nso they were just screaming hard er hard\ner over and over and over and screaming\nmy twitch name\nand then it happened a second time\non a different day after alerting the\nserver admins hey something's going on\nhere there's somebody targeting me\non my stream they see it happening\nhappened twice so\nafter that it did blow up because i post\nthe clips on twitter and then i joined\nno pixel\nso something good came out of it but it\njust sucks that i had to be seen\nin that light\nyou know\nand being vulnerable\nso yeah that was my first time being\ntargeted\nit actually happened again a few weeks\nago when i was playing the forest and\nthey have these\nillegal mods to install into forest i\nguess this old game\nand\nthe same thing happened a bunch of\nhorrible things that i don't even want\nto repeat but\nyeah i don't know if it's through twitch\nor through what where i'm being targeted\nbut yeah those are just the only two\ninstances that happen in six years so\ni'm happy about that but\nstill traumatized by it it's terrifying\non online games but i just keep pushing\ni hear things every single day\nit's ridiculous\nthank you for sharing\nso\ni have my own struggles on top of being\na marginalized creator\nso\nyeah how is that fair\ni don't want a struggle i don't want to\nsay struggle i don't want to say\nstruggle it's just\nsomething that happens\nbut that's why i try to just keep\ngood people around me\nstay positive of course i'm going to\nhave bad days and that's normal to have\nbad days and i want to share when i have\nbad days and be transparent with my\ncommunity\nhard it's just hard\nif it helps you if you want to laugh\none time one of my mods told me that he\ndoesn't see color and i was like don't\ngive me that crap and he's like no no\ni'm actually color blend and i was like\noh\nsee that's funny so there you go\nzell you want to share uh your homework\nuh sure\num\nso\nyeah like uh things i want i guess\nstarting off with that um\ni think for me it's a lot of just i want\nto make stuff that i'm proud of i think\na lot of the work i've done um thus far\nhas been good but like i specifically i\nalso want things that like\nare my responsibility of things like\ni've been part of a lot of\nother big projects around me i'm like\none of the people in it so like you know\ni was one of the founding members of\noffline tv i was uh you know a talk show\nhost on a show owned by riot uh you know\ni was a guest on this other show that uh\nyou know is now big and so like a lot of\nmy success i feel like has come\nuh from\nkind of being in the right place at\nother people's point of journeys and so\nfor me a lot of what i want now is like\ni want to prove that i can do it myself\nand that i have stuff that i can show\nthe world that uh that i'm proud of\num\ni want to have fun uh you know like i i\nwant to enjoy the things that i'm doing\ni want to\nuh\nnot worry about finances and uh you know\nas a content creator um and i think like\npart of\nwhat's tough about being a content\ncreator sometimes is like you want to be\nnot results oriented but at the end of\nthe day you know we live\nin a society where you know money is at\nthe end of the day important and like\nyou can't you can't ignore that um and\nthat's part of like the probably for me\nanyways like that's part of the the\nticking cycle of like what creates these\nexpectations\num in terms of uh what i want to focus\nuh or like what i want to work on what i\nstruggle with or what i you know have a\nchallenge with\num for me it's uh\nlike\nkind of like what people are saying like\nkind of commitment but like for me i\nthink one of the hardest things was is\nnow that i'm kind of on my own and\ntrying to prove to myself that i want to\nmake my own content and stuff like this\nthat uh it's hard to choose a path\num i think i relate with metric a little\nbit you know like\ni was a gifted kid you know um and the\nthing is that i have like the track\nrecord to show that i can i actually\nkind of feel a little differently in\nsome ways because like i really\ngenuinely believe in myself that i can\ndo whatever i want to do\nbut it's actually because of that that i\nuh have a hard time choosing you know\nlike i\ni know i was good at math and sciences\nand so i got my degree in mechanical\nengineering but then i liked making\nvideo content and so my first job out of\ncollege wasn't that it was to make\nvideos for an esports team and then like\nyou know i and then i started playing\ncompetitive smash and then i you know\nlike i just jumped around to think the\nthing and like um\n[Music]\nand\nwhat the end result is now is that like\ni'm really good at a lot of things but\nas a content creator i think it's\nimportant to have\nlike your main thing that you're known\nfor and so\num personally speaking that's like a\nchallenge for me uh\nanother thing i struggle with is\njust like\nasking for help from people i think too\num you know this is for specifically\ncontent creation it's made it hard to\nuh\nlike do collabs because um i think like\ntalking to other people about uh content\nuh is difficult for me\num in general i think just that's just\nlike a life thing for me is just like\ni've kind of always relied on myself and\nagain part of that like belief that i\ncan do anything is that i've shown to\nmyself over time it's like a it's like a\nreinforced behavior for me that like i\nknow that if i work hard enough at\nsomething like i will be able to do that\nthing\num and so on that front it also makes it\nmore difficult to like ask other people\nyou know for either friendships or\ncollabs or whatever\num and then\nthe last thing that was kind of on my\nwell actually no this is part just\nanother list uh part of the list but\nlife balance as well was uh something\nthat i struggle with where it kind of\ncontent creation always feels like this\n100 or 00\ndeal\nwhere you're either maximizing\neverything that you possibly can\nor\nit's kind of not worth doing you know\nlike for example if you made a youtube\nchannel and you posted one video\na month starting out it probably doesn't\nfeel like enough compared to like\nsomeone on a weekly schedule or on a\ndaily schedule and like especially\nbecause like content these days is\noriented towards uh consistency at like\na rapid pace you know like most of the\nbig channels when you're competing\nagainst uh you know people with\na lot more resources than you you know\nthey have teams of editors who can pump\nout video after video after video and so\nlike you know\num and the truth is that that's just\nthat's just playing the numbers game and\nlike\nuh\nlike i think there was a video that\nludwig put out that i thought was really\ninsightful about content creation which\nis just like every every youtube video\nevery content piece that you put out is\na lottery ticket and so the more lottery\ntickets that you put in the more likely\nthat you're going to succeed somewhere\nalong the way and one of your lottery\ntickets might win and so like it kind of\nfeels like again it's kind of like well\nis it worth it to just pick up one\nlottery ticket a week or if i'm going to\nmake lottery tickets i might as well get\nas many as i can to try to maximize my\npercentage right um so that's definitely\nlike a thing that goes in my mind about\nlife life balance\nand then\nthe last thing is i wrote a couple of\nfears that uh that i have is just like\num\nfear of not meeting my own expectations\npotential which is funny because we\ntalked about it just now about how\nexpectation is the source of suffering\nand\num and i mean this has been a common\ntheme i think with a lot of the things\nthat people are saying is just like how\nour expectations continually bring our\nsuffering um\nand\nthe the trouble i have with that\nstatement a little bit is like i feel\nlike i'm conflicted because on one hand\nthese expectations i feel like are\nnecessary for me to feel like i'm\nworking uh on something that i can be\nproud of because i feel like if i don't\nhave any expectations i feel like i\ncan't\ni i guess like\nthere's that fear that i i lose my sense\nof like quality i guess and like part of\nlike making good content is\nunderstanding what is good and therefore\ncreating an expectation from it\num\nand then my last fear that i wrote down\nwas just complete misplaced judgment at\nmy own potential so like i've talked i\nthink a little bit now uh right now\nwhere like i feel like i could do\nanything and i have a proven track\nrecord but like what if that track\nrecord is completely\nlike\njust luck you know and like uh what if i\nwas just at the right place at the right\ntime uh for all these things and what if\nlike i'm not really as good at things as\ni think i am and in that case\nas a content creator am i even in the\nright space to to be here and like do is\nthat is my belief in being a content\ncreator completely misplaced so\ncan i interject is that okay yeah just\nbecause\ni would say the right place right time\nthing like as far as content creation\ngoes luck is a skill\num\nit's it's\nit's one thing to\nwant the opportunity it's another thing\nto be ready for when the opportunity\nstrikes\nand so i think you're writing off\nthe fact that\nyou were ready for those opportunities\nwhen they presented themselves\num\nthat's\nthat's what i would take away from that\nit wasn't that\noh i was lucky to have these chances it\nwas\nit was good of me to like you know\nstrike while the iron was hot so\ni i wouldn't i wouldn't take that away\nfrom yourself\nwhat is your instinctive reaction to\nwhat metric said\ni think uh\nyeah i mean i think like\nthere's a part of i'm conflicted because\non like what is your instinctive\nreaction\nuh what came first we know you're\nconflicted and we know what the two\nsides are which one came first he wanted\nto punch me he wanted to punch me yep\nno i mean it was like i guess denial\nat first\num\nokay yeah\nso now we're going to learn something\nreally important\nso\nwhen\nthis is exactly why we're doing this\nright so remember we talked about\ninternal biases like we can't see\nstuff for ourself right\nso when when metric says\nwhat he says\nis that supportive or or unsupportive\nsupportive is it validating or\ninvalidating\ni think that's happening\nright what\nwould that be up to you\nor sure what do you all think though\ni would say\non the surface it's invalidating what\ncell's\nexpressing\nbut underneath it's a it's kind of\nif it it's like you say it's up to zero\nif it hits the right place and zell it\ncould be validating but did it hit the\nright place since\nokay so we're gonna do a little\nexperiment right\nzell bro\nthis sounds terrifying man\nbecause here's what i'm here's what i'm\nhearing okay\ni'm hearing that like objectively you\nhave a ton of successes behind you like\nyou ran a podcast for freaking riot\nyou're one of the founding member\nmembers of otv\nlike that's amazing man at the same time\nyou're you're never the lead right\nyou're like\nsecond fiddle\nto someone else's thing\nand so what i'm hearing is like\ndid you just get like did you because\nwe're talking about lottery tickets did\nyou just win the lottery a couple of\ntimes or is it like really you is it\nyour work or did you just get lucky\nlike i can totally even like or or is it\neven like his win i guess\nyeah\nhow does it feel to hear me say that so\nuh\ni don't even know where to begin i mean\nlike\nyeah i feel\nyeah i'm not sure i i'm actually i'm not\nactually not sure yeah um\nright so maybe we'll run a couple of\npredictions\nso what i'm imagining the reason that\nyou have trouble answering it is because\nit's bringing up a lot of conflicting\nfeelings\nso on the one hand i'm guessing that you\nfeel\nheard and understood\nbut you also feel terrified because\nmaybe i get it\nand what if it's right\nand so like maybe we're on the same page\nbut the page that we're on is not a good\npage it's a crappy page but we're there\ntogether\nhow does that\nis that what you're feeling maybe like\nresonate with you not resonate with you\nyeah i think that resonates a bit you\nknow cause like\nuh\nyeah it feels like\nyeah i mean there there might be some\ntruth behind it and it might be a tough\npill to swallow potentially but also at\nthe same time yeah like you said it does\nfeel like you're on the same page i\nguess okay\nyeah so now this is really important\nright so\nare y'all hearing\ni'm thinking about how to ask this\nso right now\nzell is conflicted when i say what i say\nlike let's let's try this on precise\nactually it's gonna be facetious but\nzell you should believe in yourself you\ncan accomplish anything that you put\nyour mind to\nthanks man i believe in you\nyou're amazing you've done so much\nawesome stuff in the past\nand like if you've been so successful\nhow could you not be successful in the\nfuture believe in yourself\nyou were gifted from day one remember\nso so this is where\ni mean that that wasn't really fair i'll\ni'll try to do a a\nmetric did a far more authentic job\nso my point is this\nwhen we're struggling\nlike there's something that kind of\nbothers me a little bit that's going on\ni don't know if we're really ready for\nthat but there's like\ntoo much false positivity here do we\nwant positivity absolutely\nbut there's like a little bit too much\nfalse positivity the interesting thing\nis that the false positivity is not\ncoming from interactions between people\nso what metrics said to zelle i think is\nvery authentic and very positive\nthe false positivity is when we're\ntalking about ourselves\nand i don't know that we're ready for\nthat yet but like actually i don't know\nhow to say this but\nwhen y'all tell yourselves\ni can do it\nwhat does that do to you\nand then it sets up the initial\nexpectation so\nright like so like and if you can do it\nand you don't do it what does that say\nabout you\nthat you that i failed\nyeah\nright yeah because i don't know\nthere was a comment that metric made\nearlier that stuck with me um about like\npaying attention to you\ni'm sorry\num\noh yeah no sorry uh\nno it's okay\nthere was a comment that stuck with me\nearlier about how like um\nbecause metrics was like oh yeah i did\nthe whole like gifted thing\nand then\nuh\nyou basically were like thinking about\num\nyou know\nyou you were like it was kind of like\nyeah i can't do this but then you were\nkind of like\num\nah\nit was\nyou were kind of like oh but that that's\nnot really like\nyou know worth it like you know\nit's it's not sorry words um\nbecause because you because you because\nyou commit to\nwhat it is you commit to but in the back\nof your head you kind of run with this\nnotion like oh you know\nwhat's the point if x y or z like you\nkind of have this this thing running in\nthe back of your head um and\ni forget the exact quote the exact\nverbiage but there was something in\nthere that stuck with me and i guess\nthat's kind of i don't know i'm only\nbringing it up because it\nit feels like you kind of circled back\naround to it how it's like oh like\nyou know you've committed to this thing\nbut do you truly in the back of your\nhead believe it even though you have\ncommitted to this thing and you're like\nyeah i can do this but\nis that really what you believe that you\ncan do or are you just saying it just\nbecause i guess that's what i'm trying\nto say\nright so here's what's happening when we\ncommit to something\nwhere does that commitment come from\nyeah does it like just come from oh i've\ndone it a million times and i've you\nknow is it like\npart of the i guess machine or is it\nlike a true authentic genuine like yeah\ni'm like ready to go i'm ready to commit\nto this thing\nyeah so\nthe i was going to say is it the should\nthat i was talking about\nlike last time\nthat should feeling didn't exist when i\nmade that real for instagram that did\nreally well\nthe should feeling wasn't there\nthe i'm doing this\nbecause it feels\ngood\nwas there and i want to and i've been\nholding myself it's a com\nmaking that content felt\nseparate from\nany other content i've ever made it's\nnot even a minute\nit took me like four takes\ntwo of them i forgot to turn the\nmicrophone on because i was really\nnervous and then i laughed at myself and\nthen the last one was perfect\nand i just put it up\nonline\nbut ruby and\ndid you try to make it perfect\nno why not i just spoke\nis it because you're trying to make it\nperfect the way that you get the best\nviews\nno\nnot always\nno no no because if you're too perfect\npeople can\num\n[Music]\nalmost write you off they can they can\nsee they can't see\nlike they can see through it that it's\ncurated\nand it needed to be in that moment i\nneeded to record it then and put it up\nif i didn't record it then and put it up\nwhen i was in that moment and i\nfelt\nthe calling to do it basically\nyou could argue that that in itself is\nyour perfect video right like because\nperfect\ndoesn't if you yeah i didn't care if it\nwas perfect or not i just needed to make\nsure it had the message that i wanted to\nsay in it and people would understand\nthat\nand i listened to it once and was like\nokay\nit works\nit gets the message across it doesn't\nneed to be fancy\nit doesn't need to i didn't see anyone\nelse or look like i have this habit\nbefore of um\nokay i want to make a video like like\nthis but i'm gonna look up\nif anyone else has done it\noh that's terrible\nsee what other people are doing\nor\nand like call it research\nbut it's not really research it's just\nlike a little self-sabotage because\nyou\nyou knew what you wanted to do\nbut yeah it was just a little\ntalking yourself out of it you're doing\nthat self-destruct thing again aren't\nyou like\nyeah so let me ask you all a question\nwe're gonna go back to zell for a second\nthis is all really fantastic so if if we\nspend the next couple of weeks telling\nzell that we believe in him\nwe believe in yousel\nyou can do it\nsee here all the ways why your lack of\nfaith in yourself\nis undeserved\nbecause you have all these successes and\nwe're going to support you because\nthat's what we do\nis the goal of this group support\nwe asked this question at the very\nbeginning\ni think we'd have to ask ourselves is it\nthe end goal or is it part of a bigger\ngoal\nso what is what is our goal for zell\nwhat do you all think what do you all\nwant to see him do\nwe want him to be self-sufficient\nokay so that when we're not around\nhe can do the things that he wants to do\nokay or at least try to do them okay\ni want you all to pay very close\nattention what were the\nwhat does\nso sure we're going to help him to be\nself-sufficient but self-sufficient to\ndo what\nwhat did y'all what were the verbs that\nmetric used\nbelieving like nope\nnot believing like just now like yeah\njust now like you used the right words\nbut what were they\nhe said he he said to try that's one\nthing try\ntrying to be selfish\nright he wants zell\nthis is the tricky thing when we start\nspeaking from in here before we really\nunderstand we don't even know what we're\nsaying\nbut our brain picks the right word even\nif we don't realize it\nhe wants his goal for zelda for zelda to\ndo what he wants to do\nand his goal is for zell to try\nwhen is y'all's goal\nto try\nis that actually what your goal is\nnever\nyour goal is to succeed\nit's not to try\nexcept\nyeah i'm we're getting to you i was\ngonna say i i try every day a little bit\nright so and so\nand what we hear from ruby is that when\nshe actually stops trying to succeed\nand just put something out there that's\nauthentic\nlike that's actually when things go well\nand what we heard from ash is that\nshe sets like expectations for herself\nright this it all comes back to like no\none is focused on the trying everyone's\nfocused on living up to the expectations\nand the the bizarre thing is if if i\nstart here\nand i expect this of myself\nand i end up moving this far am i a\nsuccess or a failure\nin your mind you're a failure have i\nprogressed\nor am i saying this is staying in the\nsame spot\nyou have but you might not fully\nrecognize that you've progressed like i\nwant you all to really think about this\nlet's say that my goal is to gain 10\npounds\nand that's my goal\nand i gain 5 pounds\nand i view myself as a failure what does\nthat end up doing towards my motivation\ni've gained five pounds halfway to my\ngoal\nno motivation\nkind of takes the motivation honestly if\nyou don't hit your goal\nsorry i think it's different when\nwell you can't control your weight but\nyou have more control of that but when\nit's something with consecration\nyou don't really have control\nso i feel like those are different\nthose are absolutely different we'll dig\ninto those nuances\ni'm trying to use this to illustrate a\nprinciple about expectation\nand there's there's a big difference\nhuh\nme trying to run away from it no no\nso no so ash we want you to run away\nfrom it right because the goal here is\nnot for\nthe goal here is for\nif you if you're not buying what i'm\nselling that's a problem that we all\nneed to fix together\nand i'm not the arbiter of truth like\nyou know i don't understand the youtube\nalgorithm at some divine level and the\nwhole point is that my answers may not\napply to you because\ni don't know if you all could tell but\ni'm pretty sure ash and i have lived\nremarkably different lives\njust in terms of like when we walk into\na grocery store or when there's a police\ncar behind us\nhow\nwe get treated\nright so like if ash is running in the\nopposite direction\nyou run you go as far as you want to\nwe're going to chase you and we're going\nto figure it out together\nwhat i'm hearing though from today and\nthis is to kind of like i know smirky i\nknow i've asked you for themes and stuff\nbut we've got 10 minutes left and i\nthink you did a really good job of tying\nthings back so that was awesome\nbut i think that like we're hearing\ni think what we're talking about today\nis expectation\nand what i'm hearing from zell is that\nhe like\nhe expects a lot from himself and he's\nnot sure\nthat he can live up to it\nand this is where we got to be really\nreally careful because if we're\nsupportive\nwhat we're doing is zell expects this\nthis is where he thinks he is and we say\nabsolutely zell we believe you we\nbelieve in you you can get up here\nand we're going to support him\nto move towards his goals\nand what we're actually going to do is\nreinforce his expectation\nwhat we're actually going to do is say\nyes you should be able to do it\nand it's just you're dumb ass that lacks\nconfidence in yourself\nthat you don't believe in yourself so\nlet me give you a here's oh here comes\nthe airplane with a spoon full of\nconfidence open wide cell\nbecause you've accomplished so much\nnow there's cognitive bias there too\nbecause i think metric is on to\nsomething right\nand we'll discover that what metrics\nstumbled on is actually really really\nimportant there is evidence that shows\nthat people who have especially imposter\nsyndrome\nattribute their successes to luck\nbut they attribute the successes of\nothers to failure i mean to to effort\nso if someone else succeeds\nthey did a good job\nbut when i succeed i got lucky\nso the way that we cognitively deal with\nthat is a little bit different\nthe other question that we all we're\ngonna ask we're not gonna ask metric but\nwe're gonna answer it for him\nis\ndoes metric talk to that the way that he\nsaw\nwhat zell's real strength is right\nbecause i think that's authentic i think\nhe's correct i'm not saying he's wrong\ndoes he see that within himself\nno i totally get that because i think of\nall the emails i never answered\nthat would have potentially given me\nmore opportunities but i was like i'm\nnot good enough for this and i just left\nit alone\nand i totally self-sabotaged myself so i\nknow that i did not take advantage of\nthose things when they came along this\nis what's cool\nthat we'll get to that in a second so\ncan we acknowledge that\nmetric is going to feel what kind of\nemotion as he talks about the scenario\nof not responding to emails how how does\nhe feel\nwhat do you all think is important\npotentially regret disappointment regret\nguilt\nright\nand\nand like this is where things get tricky\nbecause like if we want to be validating\nso like get ready for it okay metric\ni think you kind of screwed up there bro\nhell yeah\n[Laughter]\nnow let me ask you do you think that\njust because you screwed up in the past\ndo you think you're going to continue to\nscrew up\ni would like that to not be a pattern of\nbehavior so\nyeah\nand so i know that's something i want to\ndevelop out of so yeah and and so like\ndo you think we can help you with that\ni would i would very much like that\nplease how are you feeling right now\nmetric\num\nwell i mean silly but also like\nyou know it's it's\ni think\nin a way\nwe wouldn't be here if we weren't\nhypocritical on ourselves right\nso\num\nyeah\ndefinitely\ndefinitely the\nthe\ndo as i say not as i do kind of thing um\nyeah man that's hard\nlike that because you're right like\nwe're all like that right\nso i think\nme and everyone in this group would like\nto help you change\nhow do you feel about that\ni would i would love to take advantage\nof everything that comes my way so\nso you know now i'm going to ask you all\na question if i didn't say\nyou kind of screwed up there\nwhat what is me saying that do for\nmetric\nlike what was our sequence of events who\ncan kind of map it out\nit\nopened metric up to talk\nmore about\nthe situation like\nmetric came back with like a jokey\nresponse but it was like yes\ni did kind of mess up that and i want to\nmake a change so it's kind of like i\nwon't say kinda\nit was it was totally\nit's it's a turning mental kind of\nturning point it's uh\ni love that phrase mental turning point\nbut here's the thing unless we like go\nto where he is and meet him where he's\nat we can't move him forward and we\ncan't get him to turn\nif we tell metric no like oh like bad\nthings happen to all people like you\nshouldn't beat yourself up so much\nlike\nbut he does beat himself up right\nand we say like you know what you're\ndown in the trenches you kind of screwed\nup and like we're gonna help you with\nthat we're gonna acknowledge that you\nmade a mistake\nand so the the the what i want to be\ncareful about here i know this sounds\nkind of weird but like\nwhen someone kind of screws up\nand they beat themselves up and they\ncall themselves so like what sometimes\nhappens we get stuck between\nnot we feel like a failure but we try to\nconvince ourselves that we're not\nand i know this sounds kind of bizarre\nbut i think actually the right move is\nto not try to convince people that\nthey're not failures the right move is\nto actually say if you feel like a\nfailure\nyou know some of that is a little bit\nunfair but if you kind of screwed up\nthat's okay\nand also like i don't want the mistakes\nof the past\ni don't want you to be afraid of failure\nbut any time we try to convince\nourselves that we're not failures what\nwe're actually doing is like reinforcing\nthe fear of failure does that make sense\nyes it makes a lot of sense and i i\nresonate with it so tell me what what do\nyou resonate with smirky\ngo um the whole the whole beating\nyourself up thing like\ni when i think about it it does help\nreinforce that fear of like well i don't\nwant to be back in this position again\nwhere i'm internally beating myself up\nfor xyz right so\nand that's something i always like\nstruggle with going through like school\nlike you know going through college\ntrying to\nmaintain high standards and maintain\ngood grades and things like that so i\ndon't know um it's something i can\nresonate with a lot\ngood\nright because that's what i it's really\nsubtle because and it's not it's not\nreally our fault because we're never\nreally taught how to deal with failure\nwhat we're taught is that you shouldn't\nfail\nright so like what we're doing is like\nlike\nyou know\nit's like we're running like dodge\nbuilds i don't know if this makes sense\nto people\ny'all like how much gaming y'all do but\nit's like the whole point is to like no\nhit build\nwell it's like a no hit run like\nperfection\nwhat's actually like sure once in a\nwhile someone pulls that off\nbut what's like a lot better is to like\ngo with a healer\nright and like you just acknowledge that\nsometimes stuff ain't gonna work\nif we go back to this you know people\nsomeone mentioned ludwig and lug was\nlike you know you're just buying lottery\ntickets\nthat's only a strategy if you can afford\nfor lottery tickets to be failures\nover and over and over and over again\nbut if you're unwilling to let that\nlottery ticket be worthless\nthen like every time that lottery ticket\ndoesn't win\nyou fall short of your expectation\nall of this negative emotion comes up\nyou go into this\ncycle of like counteractive positivity\nbecause that's what we learn right we\nlearn like oh i can't beat myself up you\ndon't want to swim in the negativity so\nyou try to counter it with positivity\ninstead of actually like detoxifying\nthat negative emotion\nand the way that you detoxify it is you\nactually like acknowledge it\nso when people see i feel like i\nlive in like the space between\nyou know learning from a mistake and\nturning it into a positive or just\nwallowing in the failure of\nlike\nnot acting on it\nso\nit's like it could have been a good\nthing but now i've just turned it into a\nreally bad thing\nand i'm just eating that so\nyeah we gotta be super careful with you\nmetric because\nthat is the kind of thing that\nsomewhere along the way\nyour mind is like splitting towards the\nnegative right like you acknowledge that\nboth of those things are there but\nyou're moving down one path and then\nthat gets reinforced somehow so we're\ngonna have to figure out how to do that\nbut we'll help you with that\ncool\nso i think that\nso what what are like some takeaways for\ntoday like what are people like getting\nfrom this i know i know we touched on a\nlot of different stuff\ni feel like some dots are connected but\nthere's not really a picture\nlike what are people taking away from\nthis\num\nself toxic positivity we need to\nactually acknowledge our emotions and\nour reactions to our feelings\num and sit with them\npersonally\nthis is\nsomething that i was working on myself\nbecause i realized that\njust by asking myself that question for\ntwo weeks\nmade me realize\ni'm reacting rather than\nacknowledging and then\ndigging a little bit deeper why do i\nfeel like this what is this actually a\nreaction to what do i want from this\nreaction\n[Music]\nwhy do i feel like this like basically\nsometimes we feel a certain way and\nwe all get all jumbled in our feelings\nso we're missing that clarity that we\nwere talking about at the beginning\num and just\nhopefully learning to get more of that\nclarity\num maybe that like\nexpectations rob us of\nthe gratitude of success\nwell so far it's like\nokay that set up right now yeah\nright\nanyone else yeah like\noh yeah like i i i didn't do my homework\nbecause i was at pax west but basically\ni i feel like i'm still getting a lot\nout of this um kind of like just diving\ninto it um\nuh\nand i i i do like what ruby said about\nlike\ninstead of just like being reactive but\nactually sitting down and acknowledging\nyour emotions that's something that i've\nlike\nit's one of those things where i like\nknow that it's important personally to\nlike sit down and acknowledge how you\nfeel and not just\nfull you know it's it's good to like\nfully be present with your emotions but\ni don't know for some reason it it's\nit's a whole nother thing to actually\nlike put that acknowledgement into\naction\num so i don't know that's just something\ni guess i kind of noticed and\none to like\ntake away out of the session to like\nmaybe get some kind of action plan going\nfor it sure we'll talk about that\nsmirking sure sure\nyeah i noticed that i'm missing the\nclarity piece\neventually when things don't go my way\nor you know expectations\ni just get upset with myself and shut\ndown\nand i need to learn how to get out of\nthat rut and just keep moving forward\nand staying in a positive mindset\ninstead of just going in a downward\nspiral\nbecause that's my weakness at the moment\nokay something's wrong i'm just\nit's a bad day like it's an automatic\nbad day\nbut i know towards the end of my day i\ntry to just de-stress and think about\nthe positives of my day\nso i just need to do more of that\nokay and just better understanding how i\nfeel\nlet's stop setting expectations\nyeah so\nbut be careful because hold on a second\nso did y'all notice\nso we got to be careful what did you all\nnotice about what ash just said did\ny'all notice anything\ni noticed a little bit of toxic\npositivity slide in there\nyeah you set some expectations of\nyourself whilst telling yourself not to\nset expectations and that you just had\nto focus on the positive\ntry to be better\nand not always think\nof the negatives that happen throughout\nthe day right so so it's\nwell said\ni i think i think ash is moving in the\nright direction but i'm glad you all\npicked up on that subtlety right so\nwe're gonna help her massage that a\nlittle bit\nbecause i think what ash has learned is\nlike i don't know how to say this but\nit's like a a double-edged sword of a\nstrategy\nin that in order to combat the tide of\nnegativity\nyou need something\nbut it like it\nshe like overcomes the\nfeeling some kind of failure or whatever\nby setting an expectation to be more\npositive\nso it's kind of like we we're going to\ntry to figure out if there's some other\nway for her to do it because there's i\nmean because we don't want to as metric\nkind of mention this too that we don't\nwant to just like go down the downward\nspiral and that's what's so hard about\nsitting with your emotions because if\nwe're not careful we're just going to\nlike hang out with them they're going to\nlike occupy every corner of our mind and\nwe will spiral down\nso it's not when we say like oh just sit\nwith your negative like that's hard it's\na skill that has to be learned\nbut i'm glad that you all caught it\nwe're gonna see we'll see how that\nmorphs over time okay\nanyone else want to share um a takeaway\nor anything like that i'm noticing that\neveryone's sharing one thing we don't\nhave to do that but i think it just sort\nof feels nice and complete i just am\nterrified that there's one person who's\nlike hasn't really like is still sort of\nsorting through things and doesn't have\nsomething nice to say and then they feel\nlike\nnow i have to say something but\nyou know and zel's the only one that\nhasn't spoken yet so zell if you want to\nsay something you can't but if you don't\nthat's okay too\ni mean yeah i mean just like uh i think\ntoday taking away just how expectations\num like when we were all kind of sharing\nour homework stuff you know just how\nexpectations sort of um damage uh\nourselves and get in the way of\num\njust getting in the way of things and i\nguess like moving forward i'd love to\nsee like\ni've because i kind of mentioned this\nbefore but you know like what level of\nexpectation is good or how do we manage\nour expectations in a way that we accept\nthem when we don't live up to them\num and then i think the other takeaway\nis like i mean this is just like my\nuh feeling from the group stuff is like\ni think a lot of times we kind of\ndefault to being positive as like a way\nto shield ourselves a little bit and\nlike i think um\nlike in these sessions i feel like yeah\nwe kind of are still in a\npoint where we're like hiding ourselves\na little bit through\nby like being positive and stuff and uh\ni would love to see\nlike in the future people you know\nreally get down into like what bums them\nout and like\nyou know like not trying to necessarily\nspin it into a positive necessarily to\nkind of like protect ourselves so um but\nyeah anyways yeah so zell what are you\ngonna do about that\nprobably ask people to actually dig into\nyou know what they what they actually\nmean you know how they actually feel\nabout these things without like you know\nsaying the word like yeah i just need to\nbe positive you know\nlike actually yeah so that that's like\nthat's a responsibility if you see that\nhappening\nyou should address it right so i modeled\nhow to do that a little bit today i'll\ncontinue teaching you all how to do that\nbut if you kind of like at like you know\nand it's it's okay like we don't want to\nbe like all negative\nright but i i i i would agree with you\nand by the way that's completely normal\nbecause it's like week three right we\ntook a week off we're still getting to\nknow each other\nit's being streamed on the internet so\nlike it's gonna take some time for us to\nfeel safe to kind of get\ndown there\num so one tip i'll give you all for that\nis when someone shares something\nnegative because actually you'll do a\ngood job of this you'll share your\nnegatives\nwhat we tend to do though is offer\nsupport when someone shares a negative\nwhich is normal\nright like\nand at the same time\nsay thanks for sharing and yeah\nsometimes just leave it at that but\nthere's\nmore potential there right and so that's\nthe key thing is that if we really want\nto help someone understand what's going\non\nwhen we offer support\nthere's no follow-up conversation\nyou'll notice that\nit's like we can say like we can express\nappreciation that's great i'm not saying\ndon't do that but it's like you know if\nwe say like oh like thank you for\nsharing\nsilence i've been\n[Music]\ni was gonna say i've been trying to\nlearn to not say\ni'm sorry to hear that to people because\nit's quite\nit's a it's not even in my language i\nlearned it from america\ni actually had to learn it\nit's something i learned from having\namerican friends i\nwhen people would say something i didn't\nknow what to say and then i realized\namericans say this oh i'm so sorry to\nhear that i'm sorry that happened or\nbut having had it done to me from\nsomeone who doesn't use that normally in\ntheir language it kind of feels\ninvalidating or cuts off\nyeah the negative thing that you just\nsaid so the hard thing you know yeah so\nwhat we can do is i think it's fine to\nexpress i'm sorry or whatever like\nthat's not a bad thing to say it's just\nwe need to add something to that\nand what do y'all think we add to it\nany sort of follow-up question that\nmight come to mind or\ni i don't know because sometimes i just\nlike i sit there and i'm like okay but\nafter di after attempting to digest all\nof that what is something i could pull\napart from that sure and for me i think\nit just takes a bit longer to like get\nto that point absolutely right so it's a\nskill we're gonna work on it next week\nokay so just a kind of a quick summary\nand then we'll offer homework so first\nof all thank you all so much for all of\nyour contributions\nbecause i think that we're learning like\ni love\ni i could not ask for a better group in\nterms of\nwhere y'all are because\nit's great because y'all are authentic\ny'all are struggling\nand y'all are really trying to figure\nthis out and that's that's the best\nrecipe honestly because if y'all had all\nthe answers we wouldn't be here\num and and\nso it's it's really good i really\nappreciate it\ni'm confident that we're gonna do a\ncouple things and i apologize but i\nthink i heard a little bit more from\nmetric ash and zell but in my mind there\nare a couple things that i want to\nhappen by the end of our time together\ni want metric to no long or not no\nlonger fear the blank page you're going\nto be terrified of the blank page and i\nwant you to start doing whatever you\nwant to on the blank page even if you're\nafraid even if it's going to fail even\nif it ain't going to work i want you to\nnot let the fear of the blank page\ncontrol you\nfor ash\ni hate to put this expectation or goal\non you and i recognize i'm making a\nmistake here but what i honestly in my\nheart of hearts\nwhat i want you to do when ruby shared\nthat she had made an instagram reel you\nsaid that there's something i wanted to\ndo for six years\nnothing if there's one thing\nwhat i want to do this is not an\nexpectation on you\nbut what i'm gonna try to do have no\nidea because you've been\ntrying for six years so what can we\naccomplish in six weeks probably not\nenough\nbut what i'm going to try to do is help\nyou do whatever that is i have no idea\nwhat it is i have no idea if it's\npossible but in my heart of hearts what\ni want to do is help you move forward in\nthat way\nand for zell\nthe concrete thing that we're going to\nget you to do is ask for help\nokay\nso like i don't know how we're gonna do\nthat but it's gonna be all up yeah\nfor ruby and smirky sorry i don't have\nsomething for you all yet\ni get the sense that ruby's like on her\njourney we'll see\nyou know where something comes up and\nsmirky was i'm aware it can fall apart\nat any time great so we're\nwaiting\nfor that to happen you know but you know\nit and this is where sometimes there's\nthings in group have to be a little bit\nuneven from a week to week basis but\nover time we're kind of thinking about\nthose things okay\nruby gives me hope i just\nthat makes me happy\nbut i'm not trying to put pressure on\nher but i like that yeah\nso\nsorry you don't put pressure on me\nthough because\npart of my realization recently is i am\njust a human being and so if things do\nfall apart\ni know i can\nlearn from that and and like i know that\nsounds too positive or whatever it does\nright now does it sound too positive\nnot really like i can have a bad day and\ni can\nbut and i can have bad times but\ni don't feel pressure because i am just\na person and by having a human moment\nthat's not the best\nthat can be inspirational to you as well\ngreat\nright so we want to be careful about\ntoxic positivity but positivity is not\ntoxic\nright so like i think those kinds of\nauthentic positive shares are like\ngood\nso last thing to consider um just to\nkind of recap so as we were talking\nabout why is life hard because we don't\nunderstand what on earth we're doing\nmakes sense right\nas we get more experience as we figure\nthings out some things become easy some\npeople never figure things out and so\nthey continue to have problems\nso what makes it hard for us to figure\nthings out we're we have a mind that's\ncognitively biased a lot of times those\nbiases have to do with emotions that\ncome up\nset an expectation for myself don't live\nup to that expectation negativity arises\nnegativity clouds my judgment\ni can't figure things out i repeat the\ncycle\nso now the question is\nwhere does that expectation come from so\nwe explored that a little bit but what i\nwant you all to do is be more precise so\ni want you to pick somewhere between one\nand three expectations\nthat you actually have for yourself\nand try to figure out\nas precisely as possible where did that\nexpectation come from when was it born\nwhere did like where did you set this\ngoal for yourself why if you say if you\nmade a commitment\nto make one tick tock a day how on earth\ndid you decide on one tick tock a day\nwhy not two tick tocks a day why not one\ntick tock every other day why not five\ntick tocks a week\nbecause what we'll discover\nbecause and i i sort of get the sense\nthat zell was alluding to this but like\nif we have no expectations\ncan we have direction\nbecause we get a lot of our expectation\nwe get a lot of our direction from our\nexpectations and goals right\nso expectations are normal like our\nbrain will make them so that's okay but\nwe need to be more sophisticated\nin the way that we create expectations\nfor ourselves\ninstead of having them automatically\nlike media influence\nplus parents\nand like that's a terrible recipe for\nexpectations\nso are we going to learn how to get away\nfrom them yes but we also want to be a\nlittle bit more calculating in terms of\nhow we set goals\nokay\nquestions before we wrap up\nuh random tangent comment i feel like\nthat's gonna be such a good conversation\nfor me because i know i was a little on\nthe quieter side today but i think\nbecause like i run with the notion oh i\ndon't need to like set expectations for\nmyself that's negative or whatever so\nthen a lot of the times i'm like oh i\ndon't have a sense of direction on what\ni want to do next and i'm indecisive so\ncompletely random tangent comment but i\nthink next week that's going to be\nreally good to touch on okay sorry\nthat's all awesome thank you for sharing\nso my last question for you all is um\nis anyone streaming right now\nso i will be in like\n15 minutes okay but i know y'all rated\nme last time so i want to make i want to\nopen it up to anyone else we got to send\npeople somewhere but if you're going to\nbe streaming in 15 minutes i don't know\nif people are going to be waiting around\nfor 15 minutes\nthat's nice i can go live in five\nminutes in three minutes and i go i have\nmy obs open right now go\ngo\nokay okay okay\nyeah all right i got you thank you all\nvery much i'll try to send you all a\nsummary um are those helpful by the way\nyes they are they're very helpful okay\nso i'm going to try it i mean does it\nmatter if i send it same day or is it\nimportant to send it earlier\nearlier if possible please because it's\nlate for me and okay i don't get yeah\nokay great\ni will i will send also can i say can i\nsay props to my mom for driving me out\ninto town so i could steal wi-fi from a\npharmacy\nthanks mom i love you\nthank you she patiently sat here\neveryone says thank you\nand they love you and you're the best\nmom okay thank you\ntake care everybody thanks for joining\nus ash looking forward to having you\nagain\nexcited thank you take care everybody\nbye\nthanks thank you dr k bye bye thank you\neveryone\nyou"
