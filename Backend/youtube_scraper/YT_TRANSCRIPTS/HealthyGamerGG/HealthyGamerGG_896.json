    "transcript": "as we've done more and more studies on\nssris what we've sort of found is that\nthe effect of ssris seems to be smaller\nthan we originally thought and that the\neffect of ssris is a little bit more\ncomplicated than we understood let's\ntalk a little bit about antidepressants\nand specifically ssri medications so the\nfirst thing to understand is that\nthere's a you know there's a clinical\nillness called major depressive disorder\nunipolar disorder depressive disorder\nbipolar disorder so these are mood\ndisorders so these are like\nfluctuations of our mood that tend to be\nso severe\nthat they cause some kind of impairment\nin function\nso everyone experiences sadness everyone\nhas low energy kind of days but what\nwe've noticed in the field of medicine\nis that for some people these symptoms\nare very persistent\nso they'll last for weeks months or even\nup to a year or over a year at a time\nand that they're so bad that they make\nit difficult to live a normal life so\nit's difficult to engage in social\nrelationships difficult to get your work\ndone difficult to go to school you'll\nsort of experience negative things like\nenergetically so like your body can feel\nheavy it can feel really hard to get out\nof bed um other features of mood\ndisorders and depressive episodes are\nchanges to your sleep so sometimes\npeople will sleep too much 14 hours a\nday 15 hours a day sometimes people will\nsleep too little they'll wake up at 4am\nevery single day like with their mind\nbeing very anxious and having trouble\ngoing back to sleep so we know that\nthere are clinically present\nthese this exists that depression is\nsome kind of illness\nwe also know that it tends to strike\nparticular people so a key thing about\nmood disorders at their is that they're\nepisodic in nature\nso i'm doing fine freshman year\nsophomore year rolls around my second\nyear of uni rolls around and suddenly\nlike i have trouble getting out of bed\net cetera et cetera it stays bad for a\nwhile but the other thing about\ndepressive episodes is that they tend to\nresolve over time\nso one thing to remember is that\ndepressive episodes are not necessarily\na diagnosis so you can have a depressive\nepisode as part of a major depressive\ndisorder or a bipolar disorder or\nrelated to other things\nwhat we're going to be talking about\ntoday is a little bit about ssris or\nantidepressant medication how they work\nwhat they do and what their limitations\nare so before we dive into this one\nthing that i want to share with y'all\nis um\na\npaper that came out recently from the\nthe journal nature which is a very high\nimpact factor nature\ni mean a paper a journal so high impact\nfactor means that it tends to be cited a\nlot generally speaking it's a high\nquality journal with high quality\nevidence and a paper came out recently\nthat suggested that the serotonin theory\nof depression\nis actually somewhat false\nso for a long time people have been\nsaying that major depressive disorder\nand bipolar disorder and depressive\nepisodes are caused by a neurochemical\nimbalance\nin a deficiency of serotonin in the\nbrain\nand what this paper basically\ndemonstrates is that the quality of\nevidence\nthat suggests that there is a\nneurochemical imbalance in the brain\nthat causes depression suggests that the\nquality of evidence is like low or\ninconsistent and the paper basically\nmakes the argument that\nactually this neurochemical imbalance\ntheory is essentially false\nso this is important to understand for a\nnumber of reasons so the first thing is\nwhen this paper came out there was a lot\nof popular media interest in it because\npeople were sort of saying oh like the\nneurochemical imbalance theory is false\nand then they would interpret that\nstatement in a number of different ways\nso that one of the primary\ninterpretations is that if the\nneurochemical imbalance theory is false\nthat means that antidepressant\nmedication doesn't work\nor that we've been scammed for the last\n30 years by big pharma and drug\ncompanies that have been peddling this\nmedication that is based on a theory\nthat is actually incorrect\nso we're going to talk a little bit i\ndon't really think that that's a fair\ninterpretation we're going to talk a\nlittle bit about that but let's first\ntalk a little bit about the\nneurochemical hypothesis of depression\nso basically in the 70s and 80s\npsychiatry experienced somewhat of a\nrevolution and we discovered that there\nwere actually like there was a\nbiological side to psychiatry so prior\nto the 1970s and 1980s psychiatry was\nprimarily a psychological discipline so\nit was like freud talking to people\ninterpreting things about the\nsubconscious etc etc and as medical\nadvances improved psychiatry sort of\ndeveloped this kind of biological side\nwhich means that there's like\nneurochemicals involved there are\nmedications involved and when fluoxetine\nthe first antidepressant or ssri came\nout people thought it was pretty\nrevolutionary because for you know the\nlast hundred years we really haven't had\nmedication treatments for things like\nclinical depression and suddenly we've\ngot one and it seems to work really well\nso it's important to understand though\nthat when we developed antidepressant\nmedication we did not develop\nantidepressant medication as a response\nto understanding\nthe mechanisms of depression so it\nwasn't like we figured out oh by the way\ndepression is caused by a\ndeficiency of serotonin let's try to fix\nthat deficiency of serotonin with a\nmedication\nwhat actually happens usually in\nmedicine which a lot of people don't\nrealize is we don't really know why a\nmedication works we just sort of know\nthat it works\nokay so we'll try a lot of different\nthings we'll do clinical trials some of\nthese things are based on herbs and\nstuff like that so like we'll know\nhistorically for example that\nwe have an herb called saint john's wort\nwhich has been shown to be clinically\neffective to mild to mar for mild to\nmoderate depression we'll kind of study\nsaint john's wort we'll see like okay\nwhat's the chemical compound that's\nresponsible oh it seems like the\nchemical compound that's responsible\nboosts serotonin so let's see if we can\nisolate it purify it etc etc\nso one thing that kind of happened early\non as we studied ssris and we sort of\nrealized that they're somewhat\nefficacious and we'll get to that in a\nlittle bit so we discovered\nantidepressant medication works\nand then what happened is like there was\nthis big movement to destigmatize mental\nillness because prior to this mental\nillness was basically viewed as a\npersonal deficiency right if you if you\nhave trouble getting out of bed because\nyou're depressed that's just laziness\nand so one of the key things that was\nvery very helpful in destigmatizing\nmental illness was this neurochemical\nimbalance hypothesis oh it's not your\nfault you're not lazy like you just have\na neurochemical imbalance and by the way\nwe have clinical trials that show that\nantidepressant medication works\nso the interesting thing about the\nneurochemical imbalance hypothesis of\ndepression is that i don't think that\npsychiatrists or scientists if the\npeople who are really educated\nreally ever had or necessarily believed\nthat\nyou know neurochemical imbalances caused\ndepression and the key thing to remember\nis that neurotransmitters do all kinds\nof stuff in our bodies right so we sort\nof think about\npopularly we'll sort of associate\ndopamine with pleasure we'll associate\nserotonin with mood and there are some\nconnections but remember that serotonin\nand dopamine do all kinds of different\nthings so parkinson's disease which is a\ndisease that affects dopaminergic\nneurons in our brain makes it difficult\nfor us to walk right so like our motor\nmovement anytime i move my hands that's\ngoverned by dopamine a lot of our\nperistalsis so the ability of food to\npass through our gi system that's\nactually also controlled by serotonin so\nserotonin does a lot of different stuff\nand just because the neurochemical\nimbalance sort of theory may not be as\nstrong or may even be false does not\nactually say anything about the efficacy\nof\nantidepressant medication\nbecause we have clinical trials that\neven if we don't know how it works\nwe still have evidence that ssris or\nantidepressant medication are effective\nfor depression so this is one\ndistinction or nuance that i think has\nbeen completely lost\nin the common media right so we we don't\nknow exactly we'll get to the mechanisms\nof action explain why even though\nthere may not be a neurochemical\nimbalance how boosting your serotonin in\nthe synaptic cleft can still be helpful\nto for depression\nso we're going to take a step back and\njust let's recap okay so for a long time\nrecently actually people have thought\nthat depression is based on a\nneurochemical imbalance we also know\nthat boosting serotonin\nseems to improve symptoms of depression\nand actually a key thing there is that\nremember that the the hypothesis of\nneurochemical imbalance has actually\ngrown a lot more\nafter we started using antidepressants\nor ssris and what people basically did\nis reverse engineer that hypothesis and\nsort of concluded that okay if i boost\nsomeone's serotonin if they start to get\nbetter then that must mean that\nserotonin is deficient in the brain but\nit actually turns out that that really\nisn't the case so let's dive in and try\nto understand a little bit about\nantidepressant medication and kind of\nhow it works\nso\nhere's just a google search for the\nsynaptic cleft okay so what we we can do\nis kind of look at\num\nyou know\npictures of i don't know what this is\nbut the synaptic cleft so let's try to\nunderstand how antidepressants or ssris\nwork\nso\nthis is um something called a synaptic\ncleft which is where two neurons or\nnerve cells meet\nand in the end of one neuron we have\nthese little things called synaptic\nvesicles so these are little packages of\nneurotransmitter and generally speaking\nwhat happens is when this neuron\nactivates with an activation potential\nwe'll get\nit the the vesicle kind of merges with\nthe synaptic cleft and dumps out the\nserotonin the serotonin floats across\nthis gap and activates some stuff in\nthis receptor so this is kind of how uh\nsynaptic cleft works\nover time these molecules will then get\ntaken back up into the cell so they'll\nkind of return where they came from get\nrepackaged into vesicles and essentially\nrecycled so we'll send out a signal and\nthen we'll kind of recycle it\nso the most common antidepressant\nmedication is called a ssri which means\nselect selective serotonin re-uptake\ninhibitor so essentially what an ssri\ndoes is blocks this receptor and when we\nblock this receptor\nthis stuff can't go back into the cell\nand floats around longer and increases\nthe signal\nover here\nokay so it essentially boosts the\nserotonin transmission signal in the\nsynaptic cleft thus effectively\nincreasing\nthe serotonin signal between two neurons\nand when we use this kind of a drug\nessentially what we discover is that\npeople with depression seem to get\nbetter people sort of think about\nserotonin as kind of like a direct dose\nresponse sort of effect and what does\nthat mean so if we think about like\nother kinds of neuroactive substances\nlike alcohol what we sort of think of is\nthat okay once i you know if i have one\ndrink versus two drinks versus three\ndrinks versus four drinks\nthe more drinks i get the more\nintoxicated i become but it turns out\nthat the action of\nssris or antidepressant medication is\nactually a little bit different so it's\nnot like doubling our serotonin doubles\nour happiness if we look at the\nmechanism of ssris what we discover is\nthat they create a lot of cellular\nmachinery changes\nso it's like boosting the serotonin\nsignal doesn't make us twice as happy\nwhat it actually does is turns on some\nmachinery within our cells so it\nactivates gene transcription so it\nstarts our cells start producing more\nmachinery it affects our receptors so\nthe effect is a little bit more\nlong-term what does that mean\npractically what it means practically is\nthat when you take an ssri it's not like\nalcohol where if i drink three shots of\nalcohol over the course of three hours\nthat i will notice the effect right away\nin fact the studies on ssris show that\nssris take anywhere between one week and\neight weeks to work\nso this is something that's really\nimportant to remember about\nantidepressant medication is\nif i feel super depressed and i take it\ntoday tomorrow and the next day i may\nnot notice any kind of effect and why is\nthat it's because it's not a direct\nboost to serotonin it's because we're\nturning on certain cellular machinery\nwe're activating particular genes so for\nexample one of the things that we know\nis that ssris\ncreate more proteins that are\nneuroprotective\nfor our brains so they'll activate so\nthey'll create these kind of protective\nproteins in our brain and those may take\ntime to work\nso the the action of\nssris and antidepressant medication is\nactually weeks\nso this is important to understand\nbecause if you start an ssri or\nantidepressant medication you may not\nnotice a benefit right away this becomes\ndoubly important because sometimes the\nside effects of antidepressant\nmedication we do notice right away so\nfor example people will sometimes feel a\nlittle bit nauseous or have some upset\nstomach and that's because remember\nserotonin is in our gut as well and as\nwe boost serotonin transmission we can\nsort of mess up our tummy a little bit\nbut the key thing to remember about\nantidepressant medication is that it can\nactually take weeks to work\nand so even if you're not really seeing\na benefit right away that's actually\nperfectly okay it can take a couple\nweeks\nso let's try to understand a little bit\nabout the efficacy of antidepressant\nmedication so a lot of people will be\nkind of you know curious or concerned\nabout how effective antidepressant\nmedication is people will be concerned\nthat they'll be hooked on it and that it\nsort of is a happy pill and sort of\ncreates an artificial sense of happiness\nwhereas the truth is that really isn't\nthe case\nso people have also been concerned that\nyou know there's an over prescription of\nantidepressant medication especially\nduring things like the pandemic and that\nessentially like you know big pharma is\ntrying to get everyone to take\nantidepressants and they may be trying\nget getting everyone to try to take\nantidepressants i can't really comment\non what they're doing or not doing\nbut the the good news is that the data\nfor ssris and antidepressants is pretty\ngood right so we know for example that\nif you start an ssri that you can\nexpect somewhere between a 30 and 50\nimprovement\nin your depressive symptoms over the\ncourse of one to eight weeks so it's not\ngoing to make you magically happy by the\nway ssris are not drugs of abuse so a\nlot of people will think that if i\nimprove my depression it's like making\nme happy it doesn't make you happy it\nreally seems to resolve the depression\nbut it's not like ssris create any kind\nof euphoria you don't hear you know\nssris don't have any street value people\naren't abusing them because they\nactually are happy pills those are\nsubstances of abuse things like\namphetamines cocaine you know even\nalcohol benzodiazepines marijuana like\nso ssris really aren't happy pills what\nthey really seem to do is\nreduce the frequency and severity of\ndepressive episodes so what we know is\nthat when people start them you'll get\nsort of a 30 to 50\nimprovement in depression\nnow the other thing that that i kind of\nwant to point out is that as we've done\nmore and more studies on ssris what\nwe've sort of found is that the effect\nof ssris seems to be smaller than we\noriginally thought and that the effect\nof ssris is a little bit more\ncomplicated than we\nsort of understood\nso here's just one example of kind of\nthe nuances of antidepressant medication\nand this is a good example of how\nantidepressant medication a lot of it\nseems to be based on belief\nso as people are more hopeless or if\nthey think that an ssri will not work it\nactually reduces the efficacy of the\nssri so some people even have even\nhypothesized that\n70\nor up to 70 percent\nof the therapeutic value\nthe clinical benefit of an\nantidepressant medication is actually\nplacebo and only 30 percent of it is\nbiological\nnow if i say something like that y'all\nmay be very very surprised because you\nmay say well like you know\nif it's placebo does that mean that it's\nnot effective and i shouldn't take it\nwhereas not necessarily in fact what we\nsort of know is that even if it's\nplacebo we sort of still know that it\nknows know that it works and there are\neven studies that show that if you tell\na patient\nthis is a placebo\nbut you also tell a patient that\nplacebos lead to clinical improvement\ngiving that person that medication even\nthough they believe it's a placebo if\nyou tell them hey i think this ssri is\ngoing to help you even if it's a placebo\nit turns out that it actually works and\nit helps them so knowing that something\nis a placebo doesn't actually remove its\neffect as long as the patient\nunderstands that placebos can actually\nbe helpful\nso we we sort of know that ssris may not\nbe quite as efficacious as we thought so\nhere's kind of my clinical experience on\nit so what i'd sort of say is when you\nwhen we look at a 30 to 50 percent\nimprovement which is what most of the\nmeta-analyses show about antidepressant\nmedication\nwhat we discover is that that's an\naverage right so we'll take a hundred\npeople and on average we see a 40\nimprovement\nbut\nmore specifically if you're a clinician\nand we saw this a lot during covid what\nyou actually see is that it's not\nactually a 40 improvement for all 100\npeople that there are people actually\nfall into three camps\nso for about a third of people ssris are\nvery very effective so we're talking 70\nimprovement 80 improvement 90\nimprovement really kicks the depression\nto the curb for about a third of people\nthey're like moderate lead to mildly\nhelpful we'll see that sort of 30 to 50\nrange it does seem to help but it\ndoesn't really cure my depression and\nfor about a third of people it really\ndoesn't seem to help at all and this is\nwhat we've seen a lot as we've sort of\nseen the nature of depression changing\nis that a lot of depression now seems to\nbe very circumstantial or existential in\nnature so i'm like covet is happening i\nlost my job there's inflation there's\nclimate change\nall these kind of existential factors if\nthose are leading to our depression it\nseems that ssris are not really\neffective at helping that\nthe key thing to remember here is that\nthat 30 to 50 number is probably due to\nmultiple different\nkinds of depression within a population\nand that antidepressant medication is\nvery very helpful for about a third of\npeople and for the other third of people\nit helps some\nso we're still talking about a success\nrate for about let's say two-thirds of\npatients in my clinical practice that's\nkind of what i'd say historically that\ni've seen but that's another important\nnuance\nso the last thing that we're going to\ntalk a little bit about in terms of\nantidepressants is a lot of people are\nreally curious or concerned\nthat if i start an antidepressant\nmedication am i going to be stuck on it\nis this the kind of thing that i will\nthen be dependent on as a happy pill\nand the evidence here is actually like\npretty interesting so it turns out that\nif you start someone on an\nantidepressant medication they should\nstay on it for probably about a year\nso for a lot of people who go off of\nantidepressant medications about 50 to\n60 percent of people who go off of\nantidepressant medication\nwill\ndepending on how they go off and what\nother kinds of things that they do\nthey'll experience depression again\nlater in life\nso within about one to two years about\n50 let's say half of people who go off\nof antidepressant medication will be\ndepressed at kind of two years out but\nwhat that also means is that about half\nof people actually even if they'll\nreally only need ssris once in their\nlife and they'll kind of be okay after\nthat so in no way is an antidepressant\nmedication something that you you'll\nbecome dependent on\nfor the people who require\nantidepressant medication for longer\nperiods of time these are people who\ntend to experience\nfrequent or severe depressive episodes\nso remember that a depressive episode is\nit's an episode so it's kind of time\nlimited\nso generally speaking the people who are\non ssri's long term are the ones that\nwill tend to get depressed over and over\nand over again and this is also\nimportant to remember about ssris or\nantidepressant medication\nis that it kind of\nreduces the severity and frequency\nand duration\nof episodes so if you're someone who\nstruggles with depression and you're on\nan ssri versus not on an ssri you're\nless likely to get depressed in the\nfirst place\nif you do get depressed the severity of\nthat depression it won't be as bad\nand you'll stay depressed less\nright so like one person may depress be\nseverely depressed for eight months\nand they'll get one episode of\ndepression a year versus someone who's\non an ssri may get depressed once every\nthree years for a period of two to three\nmonths and it won't kind of be as\nimpairing\nso the goals of ssri treatment are\nreally sort of reductions of duration\nfrequency and severity of depressive\nepisodes\nnow the other thing to remember about\nssris is that they oftentimes do have\nside effects\nthe good news is that side effect\nprofiles for ssris are some of the best\ntolerated in medicine that's part of the\nreason why we sort of prescribe them as\nmuch as we do because most people will\ntake an ssri and not even notice\nanything they may have a couple of days\nof like some sort of change maybe like a\nlittle bit of fogginess a little bit of\nheadache a little bit of upset stomach\nbut that tends to go away within a week\nso they tend to be tolerated really\nreally well\none other thing to remember about ssris\nand this is where a lot of people run\ninto problems\nis that you have to be a little bit\ncareful about coming off of ssris so a\nlot of times what patients will do is\nthey'll take the ssri when they're very\ndepressed because they'll do anything to\nget out of the depression\nthey'll start to feel better two or\nthree months later and they'll be like i\nfeel fine every day i don't need to take\nthis medication it'll kind of stop it\nso that's something that you should\ndefinitely talk to your doctor about\nbecause there's some evidence that shows\nthat ssris need to be tapered so you\ncan't just kind of quit cold turkey i\nmean you can but you really shouldn't\nyou should really sort of go off it sort\nof smoothly\nand when you taper it properly it also\nhelps in terms of not having a relapse\nof your depression\nand you also have to consider that\nsometimes the reason that you're feeling\ngood every day is because you're on the\nmedication right so this is sort of like\nsomeone who's like wow i feel really\nhealthy because i'm i'm eating healthy\nevery single day and i feel really fit\nand i have tons of energy because i'm\nworking out and i'm i'm eating healthy\nevery single day and so because i'm\nhealthy now i no longer need to exercise\nor eat healthy\nright so something you have to really\nremember about antidepressant medication\nis if it helped you get to where you are\nyou may want to consider staying on it\nfor a little bit longer or at least talk\nto your doctor about it\nas always when it comes to details of\nokay does do ssris work for me or not\nwork for me you know should i use them\nshould i not use them here are my\nconcerns you should always talk to a\ndoctor about starting them stopping them\ntalk to your doctor i think it's very\nvery common as psychiatrists we hear all\nthe time that people don't want to be on\ntheir ssri so it's absolutely something\nthat you can do in sort of like a low\nrisk fashion right so you want to be\nmonitored as you come off of it to make\nsure that symptoms don't emerge\nre-emerge and there are other things\nthat you can start to do instead of\nssris that will sort of keep you\nmentally healthy\nso that's kind of our brief\ndiscussion of ssris or antidepressants\nwe started off talking a little bit\nabout the neurochemical imbalance\nhypothesis and some of the associations\nthat people make with that so there's a\nrecent research that shows that\ndepression is not actually clinical\ndepression is not actually caused by a\nneurochemical imbalance and so a lot of\npeople will interpret that as oh my god\nthat means that antidepressants don't\nwork whereas the truth of the matter is\nthat\nwe don't really know sometimes why our\nmedication works in medicine and every\nday that goes by we discover some new\neffect of a medication we'll discover\noff-label uses it turns out that ssris\nare also helpful for anxiety we didn't\nreally know that\noriginally\nbut what we do know is that ssris and\nantidepressant medication does seem to\nbe effective and those clinical trials\nhaven't changed just because depression\nmay not be caused by a neurochemical\nimbalance\nwe also know that that ssris tends to\ntake some time to work so we're talking\nsomewhere between one to eight weeks to\nreach full efficacy and we also know\nthat sometimes people do need to be on\nssris for extended periods of time\nsometimes two years three years four\nyears but that a lot of people can\nactually safely come off of ssris and\nyou're not going to be dependent on it\nfor the rest of your life\nso hopefully that's kind of useful\nhopefully it's sort of a quick\nintroduction to antidepressant\nmedication how it works how it doesn't\nwork and um\nyou know by all means if you're\ninterested talk to your doctor about it\nquestions\nokay so someone's asking about thoughts\nabout someone who has ptsd and\ndepression who ssris don't work for\nso a couple of things to understand\nabout ssris in terms of when they quote\nunquote don't work\nso the most common reason\nactually i don't know about the most\ncommon reason but\none of the most common reasons that\nssris don't work quote-unquote is\nbecause there is another\nthing going on that interferes with the\nefficacy of the ssri\nso a good example of this is something\nthat we call dual diagnosis in\npsychiatry so we made some interesting\nobservations as clinicians that when\nsomeone has let's say a substance use\ndisorder like they're addicted to\nalcohol or marijuana and they have\ndepression that you can't treat one of\nthose on its own\nso for example if i start someone who\nhas an alcohol problem on an ssri or\nantidepressant medication\nthat may help some but the alcohol\nitself if i'm drinking every day that's\ngoing to cause depression so we know for\nexample that al alcohol can induce\na depressive episode so we know that\nalcohol kind of makes us kind of feel\ndown on ourselves can can sort of acts\nas a a cns a central nervous system\ndepressant it literally like slows down\nthe transmission in our brains\nand so as long as we're sort of drinking\nthe ssri doesn't seem to work\nthe other thing that we know is that\nwhen people are alcoholics and they have\nan untreated depression that can make it\nhard to become sober so i use alcohol as\na coping mechanism and i become sober\nfor let's say six months and then the\ndepression kicks in so even though i've\nbeen sober i have a separate process\ngoing on that makes me feel depressed\nand until i sort of take care of that\nprocess when i start to feel really\nreally depressed and down on myself what\ndo i start doing i start drinking\nso what we know from dual diagnosis is\nthat you can't sort of tackle one\nproblem at a time and that good\ntreatment actually involves sort of\naddressing the depression because if you\nget depressed you're going to start\ndrinking\nand addressing the alcohol use because\nif i start drinking i'm going to get\ndepressed right so if i start drinking i\nget written up at work people get upset\nwith me in my personal life that lowers\nmy mood makes me feel depression can\nkind of trigger a depressive episode\nso for people who have multiple\ndiagnoses i would be super careful about\nthinking that something quote unquote\ndoesn't work\nprobably what you need is treatment for\nboth diagnoses simultaneously\nfor that antidepressant medication to\nwork\nthat being said remember\nthat sometimes especially when it comes\nto trauma\nuh illnesses\ntrauma can be sort of the great\nmasquerader so it's like the the great\nchameleon and trauma can look like all\nkinds of other things so sometimes i've\nseen people who are you know get\ndiagnosed with a major depressive\ndisorder or unipolar depression or\nbipolar depression and actually what\nthey've got is some form of ptsd or\ncomplex ptsd or something like that\nwhich can look like depression so trauma\nyou've got to be really really careful\nabout because it can really interfere\nwith all kinds of stuff and even look\nlike all kinds of stuff you may not even\nhave depression you may just have trauma\nthat looks like depression\nso i wouldn't give up on ssris you know\njust because you had a trial and it sort\nof didn't work you know i would really\nthink a little bit about getting into\ngood treatment that tackles kind of\neverything at the same time sort of a\ncomprehensive personalized treatment\nplan with like a really good medical\nteam doctor\nand um\nand and really then sort of determine\nwhether\nssris work or don't work\na couple of other things to keep in mind\nthere have been studies that show that\neven if the first ssri or antidepressant\nthat you tried doesn't work\nthat about half of people will see a\ngood response from their second trial of\nan ssri so if you've tried one and it\ndidn't work and you try another there's\nabout a 50 chance that that'll actually\nwork well\nthe more trials that you have the lower\nyour success rate is so for your third\ntrial maybe about 20 percent of people\nsee a a pretty good benefit from it\nand so there are people for whom ssris\ndon't seem to be very effective and\nthat's we kind of know that\nyeah so\nyou ukulele is talking about there's\nthere's a really interesting black box\nwarning here in the united states\nthat starting an antidepressant\nmedication actually increases\nthe risk of suicidality in younger\nadults or teenagers\nthere is actually there was an\nobservation that teenagers and young\nadults who get started on antidepressant\nmedication for a brief period of time\nactually have a higher increase\nan increased risk of suicidality and\nsuicidal behavior\nso this is a really interesting black\nbox warning\ni think there's a lot of complexity to\nit and they're kind of two i think\nprevailing theories that i put stock in\nthe first is\nfrom a public health standpoint let's\nstart by sort of saying that just\nbecause you started an ssri\nbe aware\nthat you may actually increase uh get\nincreased feelings of suicidality or\nsuicidal behavior so it's just something\nto watch out for and it tends to be like\na temporary effect\nwe'll talk about why that is so it's not\nlike it'll increase it over time it's\nfor a brief period of time it sort of\nincreases it and then the suicide alley\nactually goes down and gets better over\ntime\nso why could this be there are two\nprimary reasons that i sort of think of\nright so these are not necessarily\ncorrect they're just based on my\nclinical experience and all the evidence\ni've read this is sort of where i put my\nmoney\nthe first is that\nthere is a selection bias\nwith severity of illness\nand starting an ssri so if you think\nabout if i take let's say 100 teenagers\nwho are 16 years old who are all\nsuffering from depression\nwho is the most likely to get started on\na medication the more severe the illness\nthe greater the likelihood that\nyou'll get started on medication so if i\ntake that 100 you know teenagers who are\n16 years old and i split them into three\ngroups a third of people are severely\ndepressed a third of people are\nmoderately depressed and a third of\npeople are mildly depressed\nthey all go see a doctor and so the\npeople with mild depression\nthey don't get started on ssri because\ntheir depression is pretty mild oh it\ndoesn't seem that bad i don't need to\nstart you on medication the moderate\npeople some of them get started some of\nthem don't get started and then the\nsevere people they all get started\nand now what we do is we compare these\ngroups so what is the likelihood of\nsuicidal behavior in the severe people\nit's actually higher than the mild\npeople so the third of people who all\ngot ssris have more suicidal behavior\nthan people who got no ssris\nthen what we start to do is potentially\ncreate a causal link does the ssri cause\nsuicidal behavior or is it a selection\nbias does that kind of make sense\nso that could be a one reason for it the\nsecond reason which is kind of\ninteresting\nis that the way in which ssris help us\nis\nthe different dimensions that\nantidepressant medication affects\nwork at different timelines so i know\nthat doesn't make a whole lot of sense\nbut let's just take a look at this for a\nsecond\nso if i take someone who's depressed\nremember that an ssri takes up to eight\nweeks to work\nso we tend to see practically when we\ngive someone an ssri is all of their\nsymptoms don't get better all at the\nsame time so depression manifests as low\nenergy\nsuicidality and hedonia which is the\ninability to\nexperience pleasure\nsleep problems appetite problems and\nwhat we tend to see is that not all\nthese things all of these things get\nbetter all together and so sometimes\nwhat actually happens is the energy\nlevel actually increases first so people\nwill start sleeping better they'll start\neating better they'll have a little bit\nmore energy and some of the more\ncognitive stuff like the suicidality the\nfeelings of guilt the feelings of shame\nsome of that stuff takes longer to get\nbetter\nso what some people have hypothesized\nis that\nwe actually see a boost of energy\nbefore we see improvement in the\nsuicidal thinking\nso if i have two suicidal individuals\nand one of them has low energy and one\nof them has high energy\nwho is more likely to commit suicide\nor try to engage in suicidal behavior it\nturns out that maybe the high energy\nindividual is actually more prone to\nengage in suicidal behavior so one of\nthe really interesting theories about\nthe black box warning\nis that it actually boosts the energy of\npeople who are still actively suicidal\nwhich actually like it kind of bizarrely\nand their low energy level is actually\nprotective against actually trying to\ncommit suicide so this could be another\nreason for the black box warning\nwe don't really have a very clear answer\ni think both of these are really really\nsort of reasonable hypotheses and the\nkey thing to remember is that when\nyou're starting an ssri just to be aware\nespecially if you're on the younger side\nso as an adolescent or young adult you\nmay actually experience more suicidality\nthis once again is exactly why you all\nshould talk to doctors about it because\nthere are going to be a ton of other\nthings to consider in terms of side\neffects and stuff like that great\nquestion\nyou"
