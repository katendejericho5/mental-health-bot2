    "transcript": "if you're a boy or man you kind of\nunderstand what I'm talking about that\nwe are raised to be independent we are\ntaught that Independence and dependence\nare at two opposite ends of the spectrum\nand the more that you ask for help the\nmore dependent you become whereas in\nactuality help seeking can foster\nIndependence today we're going to talk\nabout how to ask for help now this may\nsound a little bit strange because there\nis so much in the world that is rapidly\nevolving there's AI there are designer\nstrains of THC and marijuana and of\ncourse there's all Neuroscience changes\nwith the way that technology is\ninterfering with our brain and there's\ndopamine and the evils of dopamine and\nthe gluten watch out for the gluten\nthere's so many problems in life but\ntoday we're going to talk about\nsomething that is so simple and yet so\ndifficult for especially half of the\npopulation especially men which is\nasking for help and it is crazy but a\nlot of men out there don't know how to\nask for help and a lot of the problems\nthat we face today I think are due to a\nfundamental inability to ask other human\nbeings for support it turns out that\nasking for help is not just a natural\nthing that we do there's actually a\nsocial and cognitive skills expertise\ninvolved with asking for help much like\nmaking friends or learning to apologize\nproperly or even things like flirt\nasking for help is actually a social\nskill that most men lack and today we\nare going to focus a little bit more on\nmen because it turns out that the\nliterature shows that especially when it\ncomes to help-seeking behavior men are\nat some sort of disad advantage and this\nsort of makes sense if you're a boy or\nman you kind of understand what I'm\ntalking about that we are raised to be\nindependent and as independent and\ncapable men the last thing that we want\nto do is ask for help now this is a huge\nproblem because help seeking is actually\na critical human skill of communication\njust like something like flirting or how\nto interview for a job properly they're\nparticular ways to ask for help and\ntoday we're going to dive into that now\nsome of the research that we're going to\nbe looking at is specifically towards\nmen because this is more of a masculine\nproblem but one of the things that I'm\nseeing as a clinician is that the gender\ndivide between men and women when it\ncomes to mental health is actually\nshrinking so I've seen more and more\nwomen recently who struggle with the\nsame problem or non-binary persons so my\nhope is that this will be helpful for\neveryone who watches it hey all' if\nyou're interested in applying some of\nthe principles that we share to actually\ncreate change in your life check out Dr\nK's guide to mental health it combines\nover two decades of my experience of\nboth being a monk and a psychiatrist and\ndistills all of the most important\nthings I've learned into a Choose Your\nOwn Adventure format so check out the\nlink in the bio and start your journey\ntoday so let's start with some Basics\naround help seeking so it turns out that\nthere are two ways to ask for help one\nway to ask for help is actually goal\ndirected and leads to Independence over\ntime it is the acquisition of a skill\nwhich then allows you to do it without\nsomeone else's help on the flip side\neveryone is afraid of asking asking for\nhelp because of the downsides of it well\nif I ask for help I'm dependent on this\nperson I don't want to be dependent on\nthis person I should learn how to do it\nmyself and if we're not careful\nhelp-seeking can actually lead to\ndependency so we're going to tease these\ntwo apart so let's start by\nunderstanding bad help seeking so when\nwe seek help for negative reasons it\nturns out that it Fosters our dependence\nand keeps us from being independent and\nbad help-seeking has a couple of\nqualities the first is that bad help is\ncharacterized by trying to avoid the\ntask in some way if I don't feel like\ndoing something I can ask for help so\nthat someone else messes with it related\nto this if you look at themes of sort of\nnegative help-seeking sometimes when we\nwant to put something behind us we will\nlean into bad help-seeking behaviors I'm\ntired of dealing with this crap I want\nto just get it behind me I want to avoid\nthe task I don't want to bother with it\nso I will basically dump this\nresponsibility on someone else so\nanytime you're asking for help really\nstop and think a little bit about why\nare you asking for help are you doing it\nfor the reason of avoidance are you\ntrying to avoid a particular thing there\nare two other reasons that read to bad\nhelp seeking so one is avoidance of\ncriticism so the other reason that\npeople may ask for help is because\nthey're afraid if I do it myself what\nwill people think what will people say\nwill I end up being criticized so help\nseeking can be a form of ego protection\nand that leads us to the last bad reason\nto ask for help which is actually to\navoid comprehension or Mastery some\nhuman beings will take a particular\nskill and end up saying you know what I\njust don't want to learn how to do this\nI don't want to organize the pantry I\ndon't want to learn how to put together\na presentation for a group project this\ndoes not seem valuable to me so instead\nwhat I'm going to do is dump this\nresponsibility on someone else by asking\nfor help now if y'all have been paying\nattention to these reasons you'll notice\na couple of common themes a big one is\navoidance this is something that I'm not\ninterested in learning not interested in\ngrowing not interested in exposing\nmyself to the task and the second big\nthing is a shifting of responsibility so\ninstead of taking responsibility for\nthis task I'm essentially dumping it on\nsomeone else which is exactly how we\nmove to healthy help-seeking so if you\nlook at studies from the 1970s this was\nsuper cool but they to took a group of\nteachers and they asked them what do you\nsee when you see kids asking for help\nand these teachers basically noticed the\nsame dichotomy that they said that\nactually the kids who ask for help are\nmore likely to be goal oriented and more\nlikely to be independent over time and\nthat teachers are very supportive of\nkids asking for help and that's because\nhelp-seeking is actually a\nproblemsolving strategy to gain\nindependence so in medical school we\nhave this very very simple saying that\nwe say which is see one do one teach one\nso in med school when you're working in\nthe hospital the first thing that you do\nis you learn from someone else I'm going\nto learn how to I'm going to watch\nsomeone put in an IV line and then what\nI'm going to do is I'm going to do an IV\nline by S I'm going to be observed while\nI insert an IV and then hopefully I will\nteach someone else how to insert an IV\nafter that if I've been paying attention\nnow with something specifically like\nputting in you know an IV line or a\ncentral line we have to be observed a\ncouple number of times and it's not\nquite that easy but that really uh that\nreally captures a certain attitude of\nhelp-seeking which is that help seeking\ncan be used to Foster Independence and\nthis is what we see on studies of\nchildren is that some kids will ask for\nhelp right they're like I don't know how\nto do this thing will you help me do\nthis thing and once the teacher shows\nthem how to do this thing then the child\nthen engages in independent Behavior I\nno longer need your help so if we pay\nattention what we'll find is that some\nhelp seeking is simply a step to\nIndependent Mastery and there's a great\nexample of this that we're all familiar\nwith which is mentorship so even when I\nwas starting healthy gamer I went to a\nlot of my mentors like the chief of\nPsychiatry at Mass General Hospital the\nchief of Psychiatry at mlan hospital the\npresident of the American Psychiatric\nassociation I went to a lot of these\npeople and I said will you help me I\nhave this concern that technology\naddiction is a huge problem and I want\nto do something about it will you help\nme figure out what I can do about it and\nthis is what's really interesting about\nmentorship if you really pay attention\nto what it is it is asking for help\nalmost preemptively you are proactively\nasking for people's help and guidance\nwhile you Garner Independence and this\nis critical to understand especially if\nyou're a dude so when we're growing up\nas boys and men in a lot of women like I\nsaid I've seen this a lot more in women\nrecently as well is that when we're grow\ngrowing up we are taught that\nIndependence and dependence are at two\nopposite ends of the spectrum and the\nmore that you ask for help the more\ndependent you become whereas in\nactuality help seeking can foster\nIndependence and it turns out that even\nif you study teenage children what you\nfind is a very interesting dichotomy so\nif you ask teenage kids is asking for\nhelp okay the answer is it depends if\nyou ask for help from your parents then\nthat is not okay now you're a noob now\nyou're someone who's always running to\nmommy and daddy for help we actually\nview that negatively but teenagers who\nask other teenagers for help are\nactually viewed positively so even\nthough we all sort of think that help\nleads to emotional dependence or\ndependence it turns out that many people\nteachers and teenagers see help seeking\nin a particular or in a potentially\npositive light so now let's get to some\nof the more concrete stuff so what is it\nthat makes asking for help difficult\nit's not just this issue of okay if I\nask for help I'm independent but if you\nlook at studies on men specifically it\nturns out that there are a couple of\nreasons why it is very difficult for men\nto ask for help and this also creates a\ncycle because if it is difficult for us\nto ask for help that means that we don't\npractice asking for help and if we don't\npractice asking for help then what ends\nup happening is finally we're desperate\nwe're unskilled and we are forced to ask\nfor help and since we don't know the\nskill of it then when we end up asking\nfor help it doesn't go well people don't\ngive us the the help that we need we're\nnot even able to articulate what kind of\nhelp we need and even the amount of help\nthat they give us seems to not be enough\nor makes us feel really bad about\nourselves so this is something that's so\ncritical but we sort of don't really\nwe're not really taught how to do it and\nthen when we finally give it a shot it\ndoesn't end up working well and when it\ndoesn't end up working well we do not\nreinforce that behavior then we sort of\nrealize and this is the experience of a\nlot of men when I ask for help I just\nget burned it's a waste of time it\ndoesn't end up helping anyway so I'm not\ngoing to bother in order to reverse that\nwe have to understand the things that\nmake it difficult to ask for help and\nthen sort of set up a system to\nsuccessfully ask for help so let's start\nwith a little bit of research why didn't\nyou just ask underestimating the\ndiscomfort of help seeking so the first\nthing that we've got to understand is\nthat asking for help is not easy in fact\nit is very hard there are a lot of\ninternally emotionally difficult things\nthat keep us from asking for help and\nuntil we understand what those are we\ncannot successfully ask for help so now\nlet's take a look at some of the things\nthat um cause problems so this is a\npaper called the the role of masculinity\nin men's help seeking for depression a\nsystematic review and then what is the\nimpact of mental health related stigma\non help-seeking a systematic review of\nquantitative and qualitative studies so\nsome of this is men specific some of\nthis applies to everybody so the first\nthing difficulty communicating\nrecognizing or understanding depression\nthe notion that men are socially\nconditioned not to engage in\nemotion-based communication and\nconsequently experience difficulty\nemploying such language was a recurring\ntheme in\n82% of studies okay it was suggested\nthat help-seeking is often hindered by a\nlimited emotional vocabulary in men\nwhich is maladaptive in therapeutic\ncontexts we don't do very well asking\nfor help because we don't know how to\ncommunicate so I'll give you all a\nclassic example when I talk to my male\nfriends or when I when I talk to my male\nfriends and I'm talking about the help\nthat I need or I'm listening to them ask\nfor help they use very limited\nvocabulary they'll say things like oh\nI'm stressed I'm frustrated I'm\noverwhelmed now here's the crazy thing\nabout that I want youall to think about\nthat when someone says I'm stressed what\nare you supposed to do is this person\nasking for your assistance do they want\nhelp with the stress what part of the\nstress do they want help with what does\nthe ask for you you don't know I I don't\nknow they're just stressed are they just\nventing a negative emotion are they\nlooking to just say I'm stressed and\nthen they we're going to talk about it\nfor a little while do they want a\nshoulder to cry on do they want an ear\nto that listens to them like what are\nthey looking for when they say stressed\nand especially for men often times when\nwe say stressed what we're really\nlooking for or what we're asking for is\nsomeone to distract us from our stress I\nactually don't want to talk about my\nproblems I don't need your help in it I\nneed a buddy to go get hammered with or\nI need a bud to go play video games with\nlet's go dumpster some noobs so this is\nthe first problem when it comes to\nhelp-seeking especially if you're a man\nwhich is that often times we don't know\nhow to communicate effectively we're\nincredibly vague with our language we\nourselves don't realize what kind of\nhelp we need and so it puts people in a\nvery difficult situation where when you\nsay I'm stressed overwhelmed what is\nthat person supposed to do they have no\nidea and what that sort of means is it's\nkind of really tricky because if they\nhave no idea what to do you're not\ngiving them a frame to help you it makes\nit difficult for them to help you and\nthe harder you make it for someone else\nto help you the less likely you are to\nask for help and if you don't ask for\nhelp and they don't know how to help\nthen you end up saying this is\nabsolutely a mess it's never going to\nwork nothing good comes of it anyway so\nI'm done and then we lead to a life of\nloneliness isolation and eventually\ngetting crushed because life is a\nmultiplayer Co-op game human beings have\nevolved to help each other out and as a\nman if you don't know how to get help\nfrom other human beings you are playing\nat a huge disadvantage the second\nproblem that men run into is that they\noften times try to limit their\ndisclosure so this is where if someone\nif I'm asking for help from someone what\nI usually want to do is show them the\ntiniest amount of whatever I need help\nwith because if I need help that is\nincredibly embarrassing it's pathetic\nthat I wasn't able to fix this on my own\nand now I'm such a loser for needing\nyour help so instead of asking for the\nfull range of help what I will actually\ndo is I will limit my disclosure I will\ntry to ask for the tiniest little thing\ninstead of telling people oh I lost my\njob three months ago and I've been\nliving off of my savings I will ask for\nthe tiniest little loan right I will try\nto protect other people from everything\nthat is going on in my life hey bro can\nI borrow a couple 100 bucks and that I\ndon't tell them that the problem is\nactually a lot larger because I feel\nembarrassed and if I don't tell them the\nproblem is a lot larger even if they\nhelp me that help will be insufficient\nright so this means that I'm asking for\na couple hundred bucks and then what\nhappens a couple weeks later I need a\nfew hundred more and then a few hundred\nmore and then a few hundred more because\ninstead of actually telling them the\nscope of my problem I don't want to feel\nbad for burdening them so I try to limit\nmy disclosure as much as possible not\ngive people context and therefore even\nif they do give help it is insufficient\nso it is it is a strategy that ends up\nfailing before it even begins so we need\nto be a little bit better about not\nlimiting disclosure quite as much okay\nand we'll teach you all how to do that\ntoo then we get to the third basic\nproblem that men have when asking for\nhelp which is that they use help as a\nlast resort so I'm going to try to fix\nthis problem on my own I'mma do it\nmyself I'm a man I'm an independent I\ndon't need no one's help so I'm going to\nfix it on my own I'm going to fix it on\nmy own I'm going to fix it on my own\nproblem gets gets worse worse worse\nworse worse and then since I've tried\neverything while the problem is getting\nworse then when I have nothing no\noptions left then I will finally ask for\nhelp but this too is a self-defeating\nstrategy Because by the time you ask for\nhelp things are such a mess that your\nfriends don't even know where to start\nnow I'm I've been jobless for 3 months\nI'm about to be homeless I got dumped by\nmy partner I'm addicted to this\nsubstance everything is falling apart\nand you don't know where to start and if\nyou don't know where to start you break\ndown and you tell your friend everything\nis going wrong I'm suicidal and then\nyour friend is like I don't know what to\ndo with this we don't have a focused ask\nbecause your life is such a mess\nsometimes because you waited till the\nlast minute to ask for help that it\ncreates a situation that seems\nunsolvable so now that we know what the\nproblems are we're going to teach yall a\nstrategy to successfully ask for help\nnow this strategy involves a couple of\nkey components the first is that the\nstrategy should feel good to you\nremember that we have all these ideas\nabout how asking for help makes me a\nloser these problems are too big to\nstart or uh to fix or whatever so we\nneed something that is going to be\nemotionally okay for you to ask the\nsecond thing that we want to do is\nprovide enough context to prevent that\nlimited disclosure to help people\nunderstand what the scope of this is\nwithout sounding pathetic and then the\nlast thing is to ask in a strategic way\nso that people are actually more likely\nto help you so this involves actually\njust three to six sent sentences that\nare broken down into three categories\nokay so the first category is a little\nbit of context let people know in just\none to two sentences you don't need a\ntrauma dump about what is the scope of\nwhat you're dealing with so let's say\nwe're looking for a job so I can go to\nmy friends and I can say hey I've been\nout of work for about 3 months I really\nwould like to get a new job and I was\nhoping that you could help me a little\nbit so this is where you're starting off\nwith just offering some context okay\nI've been out of job for a couple of\nmonths I need some kind of help second\nthing that we want to do is actually\ntake responsibility and share with\npeople what we've done this is critical\nokay so the second sentence is going to\nbe something like I've applied to 400\njobs over the last three months and I've\nalso tried going to one job fair but\ndespite doing all of this work I have\nnot been able to find a job so now you\nare signaling to this person that you\nare taking responsibility and by the way\nif we look at likelihood of someone else\nto help you the more that you take\nresponsibility for your situation the\nmore likely someone else is to help you\nso when I'm working as a psychiatrist\nand the patient comes into my office and\nthey're like Dr K I've been addicted to\npornography for so long I've tried this\nI've tried this I've tried this I've\ntried this please will you help me I'm\nmuch more likely to say absolutely\nbecause I can see that this person has\nput in a lot of effort and we as human\nbeings we've evolved to help humans who\nare not lazy so in our second to third\nsentence what we really want to focus on\nis this is is what I have done so far\nnow if you have done nothing what you\nwant to do is take a moment to try to do\nsomething so that when you ask for help\nyou can tell someone hey this is where\nI've started okay so you want to own up\nwhat you've done the next thing that you\nwant to do is then we get to the actual\nhelp-seeking where you want to be very\nvery specific with your ask so context\nis I've been out of a job for 3 months\ntaking responsibilities I've applied for\n400 jobs I've been to one job fair and\nthen we need to be specific with our ask\nso what do we want this person to do I\nwas hoping you could review my resume\nand let me know if I'm missing something\ncuz I've applied for 400 jobs and I\nhaven't gotten really any hits can you\nplay please take a look at my resume and\nthe next thing is you can even ask\nsomething else can you also introduce me\nlet's say I'm applying for jobs as an\nunderwater basket Weaver can you please\nask anyone in your community if they\nknow of any openings right so we're\nasking for two particular pieces of help\nreviewing your resume and checking your\nnetwork for someone who may be able to\nhelp me in some way do you know anyone\nthat I could talk to that may be able to\nhelp me right so you can ask that very\nspecific thing and if you break these\nthree things down into this format right\nwhere you add some context so we don't\nneed to limit our disclosure we don't\nneed to hide but we also don't need to\ntrauma dump then what we want to do is\ntake responsibility this is what I have\ndone so far but it's not working for\nthese these and these reasons and then\nthe last thing is this is the help that\nI am asking you for can you help me do\nthese two two things so when you\nstructure things this way first of all\nit's like a total of five to six\nsentences right so it'll take you like a\nminute or two they sort of understand\nwhat the point is and you're asking for\na very particular ask so it makes it\nactionable for them and then once they\nact upon it that'll also help you feel\ngood because now they're helping you out\nyou're not quite as alone but you're\nalso not becoming dependent you're not\nasking them to find you a job for you\nright you're doing the bulk of the work\nand then they are helping you in some\nway and even when we go back to this\nresearch on kids and teachers and things\nlike that this is exactly what we see\nthat a lot of people who ask for help\nare actually striving for Independence\nand if you ask in this way if you ask\nthem to review your resume and then they\nreview it and you're like okay I see you\nmade these these these changes now\nyou've increased your competence sum so\nyou won't need their help quite as much\nin the future now there's one last thing\nto consider when it comes to help\nseeking which is another psychological\ntrick which both increases your ability\nto ask for help and someone's ability to\ngive you help it makes it easier on both\nsides is to be new so anytime we have a\nnovice if you just look at the science\nof help-seeking anytime someone is new\nat something it makes them more\ncomfortable asking for help and it makes\nother people more comfortable giving\nthem help so even if there's something\nthat you're you don't feel knew about\ntry to approach it in some sort of new\nway hey I've been working in this field\nfor six years but I'm trying a new\nslightly different take on a on a job Ro\nI've been working in human resources and\nbenef benefits management but now I want\nto move more into the HR and like\nExecutive coaching realm and if you\nframe things to yourself that way right\nso I've I've gone I've applied for 400\njobs online but I've never visited a job\nfair I've never done networking before\nso going to someone else and saying hey\nI've done this before but I'm trying\nsomething new I'm trying networking for\nthe first time can you help me so if you\nliterally use those two statements if\nyou do something if you frame something\nas new it'll make it easier for you to\nreceive help without your ego getting in\nthe way and people are more likely to\nhelp people who are new at something and\nthey're novices right if a friend of\nyours comes to you and says hey I'm\ntrying to learn this new game will you\nteach me how would you respond to that\nversus someone who says hey will you you\nknow we've been playing together can you\ngive me some pointers like there's a\nthere's a subtle but important\npsychological difference between the two\nso it's kind of sad but one of the\nbiggest problems that men run into is\nthat we're socialized against asking for\nhelp and the less that we ask for help\nthe more our help seeking skills atrophy\nwhich is absolutely a social skill as we\nget worse at asking for help then the\nrare occasions when we are desperate and\nwe finally ask end up asking for help we\nend up asking in a way that's way too\nvague where we don't tell people the\nfull story because we're so ashamed of\nourselves and we don't even have a clear\nask so they don't really know what to do\nwith it then that results in I mustered\nup all this courage to ask for help and\nI didn't even get anything that then\nnegatively reinforces me as asking for\nhelp I decide I'm never going to ask for\nhelp I'm going to do it myself right so\nwe don't want to do that so in order to\nchange that around in order to take\nadvantage of the help that other human\nbeings will offer you because life is a\nCo-op multiplayer game right like that's\nhow it works we need to understand these\nfactors and hopefully if youall adopt\nthis structure of context plus\nresponsibility plus specific ask you\nwill be able to get some help in life\nand stop playing this MMO is a single\nplayer RPG\nla\n[Music]"
