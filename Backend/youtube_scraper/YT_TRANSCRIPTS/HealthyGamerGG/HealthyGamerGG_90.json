    "transcript": "so this is where a lot of people get\ntripped up because we have a society\nthat tries to like give us a lot of\ninstant gratification and the more\ninstant gratification we get the less we\nenjoy it if you want to enjoy things a\nlimited amount of deprivation is\nactually like really really good can I\noffer a counter yeah a lot of people are\nbringing up that this is similar to\ngooning what is\ngooning you know what edging is yes\ngooning is is a very popular word right\nnow cuz edging I think ultimately you\nyou still bust a low just a huge giant\nfat one and then gooning I think is more\nlike you just you just be gooning for a\nlong time what what does that mean you\njust stay gooning man but when you say\nstay gooning I still don't understand\nwhat the verb gooning means like you\nstay edging okay so you so this\ninvolves sexual stimulation without any\nkind of stay goon and never bust so how\nis that a counterargument to what we're\nsaying what were we talking about right\nbefore it"
