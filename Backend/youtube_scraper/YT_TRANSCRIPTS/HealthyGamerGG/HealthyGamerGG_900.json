    "transcript": "so like since you understand different\ndimensions of design instead of actually\ndoing the design if you're managing\npeople who are doing the design and you\nhave kind of a bigger\na wider experience that can actually be\nreally good\nhello\nhello hi\nhi how are you good how are you\nfine thanks\num what do you go by\nyou can call me hitch\nnice to meet you g\nnice to meet you and we're going to be\ntalking how's your career or job going\nwell\nat the moment i'm pretty happy with it\nbecause i just found a very unexpected\njob awesome good for you actually yeah\nthank you\nnot actually in my field but it's\nsomething i'm interested in learning\nso\nthis comes from a place where i was like\nlooking around for six months\nfor a job i was applying in my field\nspecifically\nand i had actually no success\nbecause of how industry requirements\nworks\nand this new company is\na new format so it makes me feel a\nlittle bit more hopeful i guess\nokay\nso it sounds like things are going\npretty well and and um is there\nsomething in particular you wanted to\ntalk about or share today\nyeah\nit's more like uh can i give a little\nbit of background please\nyeah i just graduated i\ngraduated in environmental design and i\ndid a technician in graphic design\nokay so\nand i did internships for both of them\nso usually when we graduate we're like\nokay now i'm gonna try to find a job in\nthis field specifically yep and i was\ntrying to look at jobs and i was really\nfrustrated for\nfor like six months because\njust like\nat least here in my country it's like oh\nwe would love to get to a job if you\nhave two years of\nexperience which is\nnot doable for people who just graduated\nyeah but\noutside this we actually can't find jobs\nthat are offering that don't have these\nthings specifically\nso i was kind of very sad and was\nactually giving up on finding jobs i\nactually like\nand i was on linkedin\nand it kind of was like oh this is the\nsame interest as the zoo\nand it's a company that does mini for\nrpg games\ntabletop rpg games but when i read like\nall the things they asked me to do i\nactually didn't match at all what they\nasked for\ni was like but i like this so much this\nis so cool and i was remembering a video\nwhere you were like talking about\nwhy sometimes we don't do things like\nwe're scared\nand i was like okay if i don't apply to\nthe job i don't get this job if i apply\nand they say no i don't get the job\neither so\nso i applied to it and what was really\ncool is that they accepted me\nand what's really cool about it's like a\nstartup\nso they think a little bit differently\nthey were like okay we see that you're\nlike from a lot of different\nuh\nfields\nand we know you don't know how to do\nthis specifically but you're willing to\nlike to\nlearn and teach you so that was really\nthe hopeful side of it\nyeah\nawesome\nyeah that's that's pretty awesome right\ni i i i'm so happy for you g\nyeah thank you\num\nyeah so you said you're you're working\nat designing miniatures is that right\nlike little figurines for rpgs\ni'm not designing them or say it's like\nthey have a team where actual people who\ngraduated for this to design them\nand there are people who painted in\ntheir other people i am like the middle\nones who actually do\n3d printing you need supports for the\npiece to be printed so it doesn't fall\nwhile being printed so i just put the\nsupports\nso that doesn't require that much of a\ngraduation thing okay and and so it\nsounds like you're pretty happy with\nyour job\nyes yes and and so let me just see if i\nunderstand this so\nit sounds like people were you were\napplying for entry-level positions that\nrequired two two years of experience\nyes that also and very specifically\ngraphic design and environmental design\nwhich is what i'm graduating in can you\ntell me a little bit about environmental\ndesign\nit's like interior design but we can\nalso do external\nplaces i see okay\nyeah i mean that's awesome so i i want\nto just thank you for sharing your story\nbecause i think it's like you know it's\nso interesting right because there are\nentry-level positions\nthat\nhave two years of experience\nrequirements\nwhich is like impossible for college\nstudents or recent graduates to meet\nand then on the flip side there are jobs\nout there which you may not feel\nqualified for\nthat if you actually just apply and give\nit a chance you may be surprised at what\nyou get\nand so i'm really glad that you took\nthat chance because it sounds like it\nworked out for you\nyeah one thing there is also i think\nworth\nsaying\nis that many times for for these jobs\nspecifically it's not like i'm getting\nsuper\nsuper payment or anything it's something\nred really simple like anyone can do\nthis i learned the software in like a\nday and a half they gave me this day to\nlearn it\nand it's like if it's not a really\nspecial and hard job to get and i'm not\nbeing super paid for it\nbut it feels like the company\nis kind of embracing me\nas like someone who wants to learn\nand usually at least here with people\nthat i know people are going to striving\nfor companies so big that you actually\nmentioned like in your stream earlier\nit's like the\ndifferent mentality of work where you\nhave to already be good to have so you\nget really nice payment and it's like\nthis\napproach i gave was more like a slow\nwalk i guess\nyeah so i i think that's that's worth\npointing out as well which is that you\nknow it sounds like they value you and\nyou feel valued and even though the\ncompensation isn't the best\nthat there's hopefully opportunities to\ngrow within the company\nam i hearing that\nyes\nyeah and i think you know just remember\nthat if things don't work out there you\nyou'll have some experience under your\nbelt and you can always move if you need\nto\nthere's the point that i actually wanted\nto ask you but the only thing that\nbothers me a little bit is my curriculum\nbecause when you go and read my\ncurriculum it is like all over the place\nin a sense that normally like oh i want\nto do graphic design so you send a\ncurriculum it's like i did graphic\ndesign in this uh enterprise i did this\nof record when you look at my curriculum\nis like oh i did\ninterior design and then i did graphic\ndesign and then i'm painting many\nminiatures and then it's like all over\nthe place it doesn't feel like i'm\ndigging deep into anything\ni it makes me a little bit worried\npeople my i think i'm like a shallow\nprofessional i guess\nsure so i think that that's a reasonable\nconcern\num and and i'm kind of feeling eg that\nmaybe i can teach a little bit as\nopposed to like ask you questions about\nyour feelings right now\nis that with that\nthat's okay for me i like it so so you\nknow i'm not getting the sense that your\nfear is like due to some deep\npsychological thing i think it's just\nlike it's a reasonable concern so here's\nwhat i understand your concern to be\nwhen someone looks at your curriculum\nwhich is like the history of what you've\ndone right is that is that what you mean\nby that word is like when you okay\nthey're not going to see specialization\nin one area\nthey're going to see a little bit of\nthis a little bit of this a little bit\nof this\nand so i think that that is actually\nvery attractive to certain employers and\ncertain jobs\nand you just have to pitch it the right\nway\nso let's try to understand a little bit\nabout the difference between being very\nspecialized versus being general\nso if i specialize in a particular thing\nso let's say like let's use psychiatry\nas an example so let's say i specialized\nin trauma\nand i i worked in trauma for two years\nand then another place for five years\nand advanced trauma here and i have 10\nyears of trauma experience\nso then that's great because if there's\na job open that requires a trauma\nspecialist i'm very very well suited for\nthat job\nbut there are other kinds of mental\nhealth jobs for which that actually\nisn't necessarily an advantage so for\nexample\nthere are some companies that will hire\nessentially like mental health\nprofessionals\nto work for people within the company\nso it's like you know if there's a\ncompany of 500 people they may hire a\npsychologist to take care of their\nemployees\nand that's the kind of job where you\ndon't want someone who just is really\ngood at one thing you want someone who\ncan deal with trauma deal with\ndepression deal with anxiety deal with\nsubstance use or addictions does that\nmake sense\nyes it is so i think in that way because\nyou've tried a couple of different\nthings i don't know that\nyou know if someone is looking for a\nvery specialized thing you may not be\nthe most competitive candidate\nbut i think there are a couple of really\ninteresting opportunities you have the\nfirst is that you can tell people that\nhey i understand a lot of different\naspects of design\nso i have experience in multiple\ndifferent kinds of design so\ninterestingly enough you may be able\nthere may be some kind of other design\nlike interior design for example that\nyou can say i understand environmental\ndesign i understand like even the nuts\nand bolts of like developing support\nstructures for miniatures and things\nlike that almost like more from an\nengineering aspect so i you know i\nunderstand a lot of the other pieces\nyou know it's not just one thing\nthe other thing that the other way that\nyou can kind of pitch it is that you can\nalso tell people that you're like a\nquick learner so you've learned multiple\ndifferent things and you've learned how\nto succeed in all three of these\ndifferent fields so if there is\nsomething a little bit that's you know\nif there's a new skill or you're working\nat a startup or there's a new kind of\ndesign philosophy or perspective or\nsomething like that then you can sort of\nsay like i'm really good at picking up\nnew things my background was in this i\nworked in something that was slightly\ndifferent i got promoted after one year\nbecause i did such a good job i'm very\ngood at learning on the job i'm very\ngood at providing what a company needs\neven if my background i don't\nnecessarily have experience in it so i'm\nvery fluid in supporting like whatever\nthe company needs and i can learn new\nthings and execute on them in a strong\nway\nso that's the kind of thing that like\nsometimes companies will love\nthe last advantage that you may actually\nhave is sometimes\nmanagers\nhave the background that you have\nso like since you understand different\ndimensions of design instead of actually\ndoing the design if you're managing\npeople who are doing the design and you\nhave kind of a bigger\na wider experience that can actually be\nreally good\nso if you look at even people like\nproject managers at tech companies and\nstuff like that they may work with\npeople who are coders they may not be\nthe best coders themselves but they\nunderstand different coding projects\ndoes that make sense\nyes it does the thing is i'm a little\nbit more to the creativity side so i\nactually enjoy doing the things\ni don't actually like managing people\nyeah so that that's just something to\nkeep in mind right so just because\nwhat your res\nthe best\nway you can sell yourself\nmay not necessarily be\nwhat you enjoy the most\nand that's okay\nso what that may mean is that you may be\nable to get higher paying jobs with more\nof your strengths but if you don't\nreally enjoy that then you can lean\ntowards the creative i still think that\ngenerally speaking you're kind of in a\ngood spot because you've got a couple\ndifferent kinds of things and i think a\nlot of you finding the right job is\ngoing to be\nhow persistent you are and looking for\nit\nright so i wouldn't\nyou know because i think a lot of\nfinding the right job is like just the\nopportunity like so you've got to kind\nof network and get to know people and\nkind of keep out on the lookout i\nwouldn't you know spend five years at\nthis company and then like then go\nlooking for some something else yeah i\npresume you know if you're not happy\nwith some aspect then if you're\ncompletely happy with it then that's\ntotally fine\nthat's interesting because uh\ni grew up uh\nused to use to sing people\nworking in the same company\nfor their entire lives\nso\nwhenever i do work in a company that's\nwhat i kind of strive for\nand maybe that's why it was bothering me\na little bit the thing that it was i\nneeded to be good at one thing exactly\nbecause i was afraid i wasn't able to\ngrow in that industry actually\nyeah so that you mentioned it they think\nabout it yeah so that that's\nunderstandable because i think let's say\n30 years ago 20 years ago people did\nstay more longitudinally at one company\nbut i get the sense that that's changing\ni'm not an expert on this kind of\nresearch but i think there's some\nresearch that shows that people who\nmove jobs every like two to five years\nactually like maximize their income\nthere are some industries in which\npeople move around a lot there's some\nindustries in which you stay i think it\njust depends on the industry the company\nthings like that so i i think\nyou know you may find a long-term\ncompany\nthe the issue is that the long-term\ncompany may not be your first\ncompany oh i see right yeah so you may\nhave to move around a little bit and\nthen you'll find a place and you're like\ni actually really like these people\ni feel like my compensation is pretty\ngood i feel like my growth at this\ncompany is pretty good and i've worked\nwith a lot of people who are very\nsuccessful get compensated very well who\nhave stayed at a place for a long period\nof time and will build their entire\ncareer at one institution\nand that that can be very successful too\ni think it's just you got to find the\nright one\nyeah that's the hard part yeah right\nbut i i think i mean i'm optimistic if\nyou're you know if you're not gonna get\nin your own way\nin terms of\nyou did a good job of applying for a job\nthat you quote unquote didn't think you\ncould get and i would continue doing\nthat so continue exploring continue\nbelieving in yourself or just taking a\nchance\nand i i think you'll probably do well\nwell i hope so\nwow cool\noh\nshe disconnected or dropped\nokay\nhuh\ndisconnected okay\nokay well yeah so i i think\nit's cool to hear that you know people\nare\ntrying the stuff that we recommend and\nit's working out for them\nright so like we'll say a lot of stuff\non stream like hey you should do this\nand you should do this\nand and we don't really have great\ndata about the people who do it or don't\ndo it and how it ends up with them but\nit's always nice to hear that and i i'd\nencourage you all to take\nhiji's story to heart that\njust you know\non the one hand there are jobs that you\nquote unquote should get or are good on\npaper for and those jobs won't hire you\nbecause it's an entry-level position\nwith two years of experience\nand on the flip side there may be jobs\nthat you don't think that you can get\nwhich may actually hire you because of\nthe state of the company or whatever\nand so in either case like you know i i\nwould just encourage you all to not\nwork against yourself right if you think\nthat you're not going to get a job\nyou know don't bother not applying like\ntake a chance from time to time we're\nnot saying if you're a college graduate\nand you know let's say facebook is\nlooking for a new ceo like i don't think\nyou're gonna get that job but\nyou know or meta sorry\nbut at the same time like recognize that\nthere are a lot of employers out there\nwho are willing to take a chance on\nemployees that are willing to learn and\nare willing to grow etc etc and\nyou know give it a shot"
