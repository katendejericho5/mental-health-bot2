    "transcript": "and this is where people are like yeah\ni'd rather drive an 80s mazda than a\nferrari as long as i can live with\nmyself every day and i enjoy going to\nwork because i've worked with people who\ndrive the ferrari instead of the 80s\nmazda and what i hear from them\nuniformly is i wish i had made a career\nchange 10 or 15 years ago because i'm\nsure i'm driving a ferrari but like i\ndon't really care about it it doesn't\nbring me fulfillment what do you go by\nuh i'm chris nice to meet you chris and\nwe're going to be talking about career\nstuff today right yes yes i am welcome\nbuddy thank you thank you for having me\non can i just say that you're my hero dr\nk okay um so yeah\nall right well\nyay i guess\ndo you want to can we do you want to\ntalk about career stuff or you want to\ntalk about heroes sure no career stuff\nwould be good okay so tell me how's your\nhow's your career going how's your job\ngoing so i i've been doing marketing for\nlike five to six years okay and i've\nbeen hating it a lot okay um i've been\nbuilding startups here and there um i've\nbeen making um financial startups um\nstartups for universities and startups\nfor um students and stuff like that um\nbut i've never really clicked that i\nlike it and i've grown to the tested\nover the years okay of course i've\ndetested that my coping mechanism is\nquite weird but i have like these side\nprojects where i try to like listen to\npeople more and really listen to myself\nin which i'm hoping that i would\nunderstand which career i i will i will\nlike so basically i've been trying to be\nlike a\nside psychologist for my friends like a\ntherapist for five to six years and i've\nbeen loving that and um the last eight\nmonths have been the toughest because i\ni had really had to decide where\ni had to like to to go so i chose to\ndrop all my businesses in like a week\nand then i\ni'm enrolling myself to a psychology\nuniversity and i just started so cool\nhow do you feel about that oh it feels\nscary it feels anxiety-inducing what's\nscary about it i'm afraid of so there's\nthis idea that the first five to six\nyears of my life of my career life was\nmaking was the idea that i'm making um\nthe foundations for my future making\nstartups um working in companies as a\nmarketing intern\nsometimes a marketing um personnel and\nthen suddenly i just dropped it all in\nless than a week the decision was like\nin less than a week i'm not so sure if\ni'm gonna make it i'm so afraid that i'm\nso afraid with the idea that i'm not\ngonna make it as a therapist okay what\nwhat does not making it as a therapist\nmean to you okay so i've been\num the last two months i've been making\num a support thread in hg's community\nand hg's um discord server where i\nreceive call-ins from people\nwhich i don't diagnose or treat them or\ncoach them or anything all i do is just\nlisten okay like the way you would teach\neveryone in twitch how to listen to\nreally like reflect and sometimes there\nare some people from the united states\nor people who are really fluent in\nenglish in which i can't really\nunderstand how to speak better so\ni'm really afraid if i'm not gonna be\nable to like understand people that's my\nworst fear okay and becoming a therapist\num i don't mind not being able to help\npeople but i am very afraid of not being\nto understand people so that makes sense\nyeah i think it makes a lot of sense so\nwhat i'm hearing is that you try to\nsupport people on the internet and some\nof your interactions with those people\nhave made it have started to cr has\nstarted to create doubt in your mind\nthat hey if i can't help these people\nwhat if that means that i can't help\npeople as a psychologist or a therapist\nexactly so i think that that's this is\ngoing to be a you know maybe a rare\nsituation where\num i don't know that this is a deep\npsychological exploration i think that\nthis may actually have a very simple\nanswer we'll see how this answer sits\nwith you okay so the first thing to\nunderstand is that when you're in a\ntherapist or when you're a therapist or\npsychologist there's there are things\nthat are very very very different about\nthat from talking to a stranger on the\ninternet and i think this is where if\nyou fail to help people who are\nstrangers on the internet that has so\nmuch to do with the way in which you're\ninteracting with them and very little\nsimilarity to what a psychologist or\ntherapist does so like sure\nyou know and and so oddly enough like\ni'm not surprised that you run into\ntrouble trying to help people on the\ninternet because i think first of all\nthere's no longitudinal relationship so\nsuccess as a therapist or psychologist\ntends to\ninvolve a longitudinal relationship now\nthere are other places in which we have\nlongitudinal relationships right so like\nfor example we can have friends we can\nhave gaming buddies things like that so\neven if i struggle with friendships it\ndoesn't mean that i'm not going to be a\ngood therapist the other thing is that\nit sounds like you've learned a lot kind\nof on your own but you actually haven't\ngone through formal education no i\nhaven't right so if i like want to be a\nchef and i'm afraid that i'm not going\nto be making good food but i haven't\nstarted culinary school yet like that's\nkind of valid right so so oddly enough i\nthink part of part of what's going on\nhere is that you know as you go through\nyour formal education process because\nremember the goal of the education is to\nteach you\nhow to be successful as a therapist but\nyou haven't done that yet so i\npersonally am not concerned like i\nbecause i think helping people on the\ninternet is like kind of a grab bag\nbecause a lot of times there are all\nkinds of things that could be going on\nand listening is often not sufficient to\nhelp people it's a great place to start\nbut as a therapist and as a psychologist\nyou're going to learn so much more than\nlistening so what i'm sort of is seeing\nyou do is sort of like you're you're\nmaking an assessment which is kind of\nfair because it's your experience but\nit's like you haven't been trained in\nthis stuff you've really only learned\nstep one it's like i'm teaching you how\nto turn on the oven but you're like i\ndon't know how to bake a cake yet and\nit's like yeah that's because all i've\ntaught you is how to turn on the oven so\ni think there's some basic communication\nskills that we try to teach and the\nreason we teach those basic\ncommunication skills is because they're\nyou know do therapists learn those\nskills yes but these are skills that all\nhuman beings should understand in terms\nof communication and as you go through\nformal education for therapy or\npsychology or whatever you're going to\nlearn way more than what we teach what\ndo you think about that how does that\nsit with you kind of makes me more\nafraid okay because the idea that um if\nlistening like the i mean the the the\nthing that i really understand in a\ntherapist's job is to 80 of the job is\nto listen if i can't do that then what\nam i going to do where do you get the\nidea that 80 percent of the job the\ntherapist's job is to listen well i i i\nright okay um i've been in the\ntherapist's office i guess i've seen you\ninterview people so that's my main idea\nokay so you've been in therapy yourself\nyes and your therapist listens to you a\nlot right yes what do you think when\nthey're not speaking\nwhat do you think they're doing\ndiagnostic assessments sort of right so\ni would say that most of the therapists\njob we are listening when we're doing\ntherapy but actually i'd say most of our\njob is thinking what do you think about\nthat that makes me feel safe i guess\nbecause i like thinking a lot yeah i\nknow yeah yeah so so i think chris what\ni'm hearing from you is that you're\nsomeone who's learned how to be a good\nlistener but really to understand what a\ntherapist does it's like we're thinking\na lot right so even as i'm talking to\nyou i'm listening to what you're saying\nmaybe it'll help if i share with you\nwhat's going on in my mind okay so like\ni'm trying to figure out okay is this\nfear that you have like appropriate or\ninappropriate is it developmentally\nappropriate and what i mean by\ndevelopmentally appropriate is they're\nlike some think there's some fears that\nif i've never been on a date before and\ni've never had a significant other\nbefore if i've never been in a committed\nromantic relationship it's\ndevelopmentally appropriate for me to be\nafraid of that does it mean that there's\nsomething wrong with me absolutely not\nin fact it's a normal part of the\ndevelopmental process so i'm also sort\nof thinking a little bit about like as\ni'm listening to you i'm also thinking\nabout okay like we talked a lot about\nmarketing at the beginning or marketing\nhas been your background is the fear\nthat you experience now somehow related\nto marketing or is the fear that you\nexperience a some scar that has to do\nwith your own fear of uncertainty are\nthere other things that i could ask you\nabout like for example how much of this\nfear is you've invested five or six\nyears and now you've you've given up\neverything that you've invested and now\nyou're like going all in on becoming a\npsychologist what if you're a bad\npsychologist too then what then like\nyou've given up all this career and now\nyou're like eight years down the road\nyou've given up your career you're a bad\npsychologist like now what do you do oh\nmy god you're screwed does that any of\nthat resonate with you like i think\nabout that every day really for the past\nmonth so so here's the question chris\nthe consequence\nof you giving up a career in marketing\nand pursuing psychology and being bad at\nit is huge like it's gonna cost you a\nlot but just because it's gonna cost you\na lot doesn't mean that you're that has\nnothing to do with whether you're good\nor bad at it does that make sense if\nyou're bad at it you're screwed we have\nno idea whether you're good about it\nexactly and that makes it very scary\nright yeah so i think that that's\ndevelopmentally appropriate i think\nyou've taken you've taken a plunge\nyou've jumped off a cliff and you're not\nsure how you're going to land there's a\nlot of uncertainty that i'm hearing\nexactly what i'm seeing down there is\nlike rocks\nand dirt\nthere's some water in it it's just very\nscary yeah yeah and and so what do we do\nwith fear exactly what do you do with\nfear it's a good thing what do you think\nlike is the goal to make the fear go\naway no it's too\nit's to experience the fear while\ngoing towards the thing that i really\nwant and do you really want to be a\ntherapist yes like it's such a weird\nthing i have this instance where\ni can can i tell you why i think i'm\nreally\ngonna be\nuh why my passion is in there absolutely\ntell me a therapist sure okay so there's\nlike this um meeting where where\nwhere there's this like um one room\nfilled with ceos startup owners and\nbusiness owners and stuff like that and\nthen there's just this one psychologist\nwho's just there sitting and taking\nnotes and then talking to people just\nsaying that i don't know why but i\ngot a hint that she's a clinical\npsychologist and i'm more interested in\ntalking with her than anyone\nin the group and that keeps happening\nover and over again so i think that's\nwhy\nmaybe that's a stupid idea but do you\nthink it's a stupid idea\ni mean logically yes because i'm\nbasically giving up a lot of money a lot\nof certainty a lot of like um\nstability in marketing to go to be a\ntherapist who in indonesia i am from\nindonesia who\nwhich is a third world country and\npsychologists and therapists aren't\nreally the dream job for indonesians and\nmental health is such a big stigma here\nstill giving up a ferrari for an 80s\nmazda sure yeah\nso\nhow do you feel about that i feel afraid\ni'm constantly thinking that i'm stupid\nfor thinking about it i know for for\nchoosing for for for loving the idea\nthat i get to have conversations with\npeople every day what's happening with\nthem okay so what did you detest or hate\nabout marketing the manipulation the\nidea that i need to push products\ncreate value out of nothing to sell to\npeople okay i don't like that idea so\nchris i think you've got so oddly enough\ni kind of agree with you that on some\nlevel becoming a therapist and giving up\na career in marketing is stupid and yet\nyeah\ni mean because you've made a good\nargument right sure i still think you're\ndoing the right thing\nbut kind of meet you where you're at so\ni i think this is where it what matters\nlike i think what you've got to really\ndecide is what\nwhat do you value so i'm going to give\nyou two choices you can have a career\nthat has more certainty more money and\nmanipulates other people into buying\nstuff that they they don't need or you\ncan have a career that you find\nintellectually intriguing fulfilling\nmore uncertainty uphill battle helping\npeople in a country the same reason it's\na risky business to be a psychologist in\nindonesia is also exactly why like i\ndon't know how old you are but i'm\nguessing you're in your 20s and so\nyou've got to think about over 40 years\nwould the world be a better place if\nindonesia had a psychologist who\nactually cared about what they were\ndoing and we're trying to help people\nwho struggle with mental health problems\nin indonesia what matters to you more\nand so that's why i think it sounds like\nyou're making the right choice now is\nthere more uncertainty\nabsolutely is it a question mark\nabsolutely but that's where also i think\nit's like this is your time in life to\nreally think about\ndo i want to play it safe or am i\nwilling to make a risk take a risk to\nmake the world a better place and also\nlike i may lose out financially\nironically in my experience it's people\nwho make the choice that you made\nactually end up both happier and richer\nbecause what i tend to see is that when\npeople hate their job they perform\nunderperform and when people love their\njob they over perform and also the lower\nvalue\nsocietally when society thinks that a\nparticular profession isn't worth very\nmuch\nif you really care about it you do\nreally really well like i don't know how\nto say this but like i'll share a story\nwith you so when i was in medical school\ni was on my surgery rotation and i did a\ngood job on surgery and then i people\ntowards the end of it they were like hey\nyou know like if you really wanted to do\nsurgery like you'd be really good at it\nyou should really consider going doing\nsurgery and i told them and i was like\nhey i'm you know i'm interested in\npsychiatry and their response was you're\ntoo smart for psychiatry you're wasted\nin psychiatry you're you're so smart and\nyou're so talented that you should do\nsomething that is really going to\nchallenge you and that's like that's\nsurgery and what i really found is that\nlike that was sort of arrogant but that\nthat oddly enough you know just because\nthere's a low value profession that is\nnot very competitive if you're really\nreally strong at it and you care about\nit a lot a lot you're going to shine\nvery brightly in that profession because\ni i don't know i mean like because i i\nthink that the key thing is that you\nknow i think it is an uphill battle and\nwhat i'm hearing from you is that\nthere's more financial uncertainty but\nlike i don't know how to say this but\nsomething tells me in the next 20 years\npsychologists are going to be valued a\nlot more in indonesia than they are\ntoday what do you think okay\nsure i yeah it's just the from year 0 to\nthe 20th year is gonna be such a long\nlong time i was planning a year ago that\ni would be living off my own probably\nhaving my own house now probably\nexpanding my startup and stuff like that\nbut now i'm stuck in my parents house\nlike i'm not so sure what to do with\nthat it it's stupid\nit feels stupid because i'm burdening a\nlot of more people than than weighing\nmyself to be happier that makes sense\nyeah so chris what i'm hearing is that i\ndon't know how to say this but like yeah\nlike you know you're taking a step back\nthe road of life but i think that like\nsometimes that's still the right move\nright even if you have to stay i mean\nyou have to decide because you're\ntelling me that this is a job that you\ndetested and that\nyou know you hated manipulating people\nso like sure you could have your own\nplace but you would still be\nmanipulating people and detesting it\nevery day and i i don't know how to say\nthis but just like from a karmic\nperspective like a career shift is gonna\ncome at a cost is there more uncertainty\nyeah like i wish i could tell you hey\neverything's great you know you're gonna\nbe perfect i mean i i think you're gonna\ni think you're it sounds to me like\nyou're operating from the right\nprinciples and this is the other thing\nabout life is like we can't know what's\ngonna happen like we don't know right\nlike maybe if you continue to manipulate\npeople through marketing and you're\nworking with all these startup ceos one\nof them does something illegal gets sent\nto jail you get sent to jail like you\nhave no idea what what the future is\ngoing to hold we have these assumptions\nthat certain things are very secure and\nother things are insecure but if\nanything the world has taught us\nanything over the last three years with\nlike a global pandemic it's that the\nworld can come grinding to a halt and so\ni think the the you know the reason that\ni'd kind of support you and your\ndecision is first of all we've had\nclients from indonesia and we've heard\nfirsthand from them how hard it is to\nfind a good therapist or psychologist\nsecond thing is i think you're operating\nfrom the right place the tricky thing is\nthat just because you operate from the\nright place does not mean that life is\ngoing to be easy right are you going to\nbe staying at home for a couple of years\nyeah are you gonna make less money sure\nis there more uncertainty sure when you\ntell people oh i do marketing for this\nstartup and they're like oh like very\nimpressive and then when you say like\ni'm a therapist and you live in a\ncountry where that isn't valued they're\nlike what's wrong with you yeah\nexactly like my friends asked me what's\nwrong with you yeah okay\nyeah right so i mean i got that stuff\ntoo when i decided to become a\npsychiatrist from the surgeons and also\npeople in my family they're like why\nwould you want to be a psychiatrist\nyou're going to go crazy so like i don't\nknow how to say this but you know chris\ni i can't tell you that your life is\ngoing to be easy because of your\ndecisions but what i can tell you is\nthat if you want to live a fulfilling\nlife it's not always taking the easy\nroad and that do what aligns with you\nand do your best and try to make the\nworld a better place and i would you\nknow if i had if i was a betting man i\nwould say if we talk to you five years\nfrom now i don't think you're gonna\nregret your decision i see a lot more\nregret from people who stay in the field\nthat they find spiritually bankrupt and\nthis is where people are like yeah i'd\nrather drive an 80s mazda than a ferrari\nas long as i can live with myself every\nday and i enjoy going to work because\ni've worked with people who drive the\nferrari instead of the 80s mazda and\nwhat i hear from them uniformly is i\nwish i had made a career change 10 or 15\nyears ago because i'm sure i'm driving a\nferrari but like i don't really care\nabout it it doesn't bring me fulfillment\nand that's where if material goods are\nvery very fulfilling to you then that's\na different story i think it's it's\nabout values chris it's about what you\ncare about\nyeah\nit's just it's really hard to cope to\nit's really hard to\nunderstand how to cope living the data\nthe day-to-day basis that's the hardest\none what's harder on a day-to-day basis\num hold on\num i'm not like i i\ni feel guilty a lot towards my parents\nthey have to pay again for my tuition\nand\ni have to keep living off them in which\nthey had\nmore plans for themselves but i have to\npull them back again and it feels like i\ncan't i i'm really proud of what i'm\ntrying to achieve of myself but when i\nput myself in society or like in with\nfriend groups or with um\nbig family gatherings or stuff like that\nthat kind of makes me shameful yeah to\nto burden\nmy parents so much that's what i feel\nlike from the career change yeah no i\ndon't know how to cope with that have\nyou talked to your parents about it yes\nand they keep\ni i'm trying to like really talk to them\nabout it but they keep reassuring yeah\nit's okay like it doesn't feel okay\nbecause sometimes i can like feel\ntheir disappointment almost that's what\ni'm feeling okay okay to disappoint them\nit's not okay at all oh feelings\nemotions hello hold on because i failed\na lot i failed a lot yeah by trying to\ngo to marketing like i i tried to like\nabolish the failures that i did from\nwhen i was in high school and when i was\nin when i was trying to apply for\nuniversities i applied when i was in\nhigh school i applied to 50 french\nuniversities i worked hard a lot and\nthen i failed and i i spent like eight\nmonths there and i had to go home\nbecause no universities would because my\nbad french for some reason but i aced\nall of them okay and um yeah yeah i'm\nsorry it got emotional\nit's okay i think we're learning a\ncouple of things you failed right and a\nbunch of times in in order to\nand failure comes with negative emotions\nsure\nand as you\nstart acting in a way to make the\nnegative emotions go away right to\nabolish the failure make up from the\nfailure you wind up in marketing it's\nalso my choice like it's a dumb choice\nsix years ago\nsure\nlet's table that for a second but what\ni'm kind of what i what i'm hurt what i\nheard from you is that you experienced\nsome degree of failure and you had to\nmake up for it and so you chose\nmarketing and then as you started\nworking in marketing did you feel less\nlike a failure kinda yeah okay good\nso you started you started to take\nactions to make yourself to fix feelings\nyeah does that make sense right because\nif i feel like a failure oh i can do\nmarketing and look like i'm in a room\nwith a bunch of ceos i'm no longer a\nfailure\nwith me yep so what you've managed to do\nis try to do certain things that make\nyou feel less bad and where did that get\nyou\nand are you happy with where you are\nno okay so sometimes we are so afraid of\nnegative feelings\nthat we will do whatever we can to make\nthem go away and in doing so we\noftentimes trap ourselves because then\nwhat happens is like you're you can't\nexperience that shame or feeling of\nfailure or whatever so you're gonna make\naction so you never feel that way it's a\nprotective mechanism but in doing so\nwhat you're actually doing is you're\nletting that fear of failure dictate\nyour life does that make sense kinda\nyeah what do you understand about that\nand what do you not understand about\nthat i get that i'm trying to like feel\nsomething overcompensate something\nthat's the right word yep i i get that\ni'm trying to do that but i never felt\nlike it was the\nthe the wrong choice sure at the start\nand when i'm doing it absolutely it's\nnot going to feel like the wrong choice\nbecause how do we know what's the wrong\nchoice and what's the right choice based\non our emotions that's our first answer\nright if i do something and i feel like\na failure that's the wrong choice if i\ndo something else and i don't feel like\na failure that's the right choice and so\nyou've picked a career to avoid\nfeeling like a failure\nbut avoiding the emotion of feeling\navoiding an emotion of shame is not a\ngood strategy to live a fulfilling life\nthis is where things get tricky does\nthat make sense like if i'm trying to\navoid feeling ashamed of myself so let's\nsay i feel ashamed when i go to a party\nbecause i'm short i'm like five foot two\nand everyone else is like five foot six\nor five foot seven i feel ashamed of\nmyself so what can i do to avoid that\nshame i just never go to a party and\nthat feels good over the course of that\nday because if i go to the party i feel\nashamed of myself if i don't go to the\nparty i don't feel ashamed of myself\neasy right i just avoid the party\nsometimes we see this in careers too\nwhere like you felt like a failure so\nyou've got to make up for it and then\nyou start living this life to try to\nlook good in other people's eyes and\nfeel good about yourself and you do that\nfor five or six years and then you end\nup kind of where you are which is that\nyou recognize that you picked a\nprofession that feels like unethical in\nsome way it doesn't resonate with who\nyou are as a person you're not helping\nanyone you don't find the work quite as\ninteresting and in fact you're even a\nlittle bit afraid that you could be\nmanipulating people in the wrong\ndirection but\nyou get to hold your head up high you\nget to move out from your parents place\nyou get to drive a ferrari so what's\nmore important to you chris this may\nsound weird but i guess\nnot being disappointed not disappointing\nmy parents like that really is a very\nimportant thing for me absolutely so now\nwe get to something else so you ask your\nparents am i disappointing you what do\nthey say no no it's fine everything's\ngood you're good okay so let's take two\nscenarios and you don't believe them\nright\nokay so let's take two scenarios in two\nalternate universes one universe your\nparents are disappointed in you and in\nanother universe they're not\ndisappointed in you in the universe that\nthey are disappointed in you\nwhat are they gonna say are they gonna\ntell you they're disappointed i don't\nthink so no they're gonna say no no no\nno chris it's okay we love you we're not\ndisappointed and in the universe where\nthey're not disappointed and they\nactually are okay with it what are they\ngonna say no no no chris you're okay\nabsolutely they're gonna say the same\ndamn thing so how are you supposed to\nknow which one is real exactly how do i\nknow right so my point is that they may\nnot actually be disappointed in you but\nthere's no way that you're gonna know\nbecause even if they tell you they're\nnot disappointed in you you're not\nwilling to believe them so how are they\never supposed to convey to you actually\nchris this is okay so why do human\nbeings do this it's because you're\ndisappointed in yourself so if i think\ni'm ugly and the world tells me no no\nyou look fine i don't believe them so\nconcretely i mean i think you've got a\nfair amount of work so you know for what\nit's worth i think it's fine that you\ndecided to move into psychology i think\nit's great i think it's a wonderful\nprofession i think hopefully you'll be\nhelping people in a couple of years i\nthink if you enjoy the work and it\nresonates like if you care about being\nthe psychologist in the room of ceos and\nby the way that also is like respectable\nright because now we have psychologists\nin rooms with ceos and executives and\nother people are recognizing the value\nof psychology but i think you've got\nsome work ahead of you which is like to\nreally think a little bit about you know\nyour own feelings of disappointment and\nfailure and i could tell you all kinds\nof stuff like as a parent you recognize\nthat your children are going to make\nmistakes that it's your job as a parent\nto support your kids when they make\nmistakes that as a parent you're\nactually okay with them living with you\nfor a year or two if it makes them happy\nlike what do your parents want they want\nyou to be happy they want you to be safe\nthey want you to be secure i would not\nbe happy if my kids were driving around\nferraris and were\nwere miserable every day if someone came\nand asked me hey would you be willing to\nset delay your retirement plans by two\nyears if it means that your child was\nhappy with their career for the rest of\ntheir life i'd be like damn straight i'd\ntake that trade any day of the week what\ndo you think never really thought about\nit that way i guess so yeah right so i\njust oh\nyeah go ahead yeah how do i deal with my\nown disappointment towards myself i\nguess okay\ngood question so a couple of things the\nfirst is you can have more of a\nconversation with your parents so when\nyou ask them are you disappointed in me\nand they say what do they say no no it's\nfine everything's good why are you\nasking this again and what do you say\nwell it's just i i usually get angry\nlike yeah just listen to me for a bit\njust like really\nlisten you know like tell me oh no i\nmean let me convey my feelings and\nthey're like what what is it again what\nis it\nwhat's their left to convey okay so so i\nthink there are a couple of things which\nare unfortunate which is that western\ncultures are increasingly what we call\npsychologically minded whereas my\nexperience of people in southeast asia\neast asia south asia africa\nyou know we don't it's kind of confusing\nlike my parents like thoughts and\nemotions are kind of confusing like even\nnow when i talk to the generation above\nme they actually don't know the\ndifference between a thought and an\nemotion like if i were to ask one of my\naunts or uncles or one of my friend's\nparents what are you feeling right now\nthey would not be able to answer that\nquestion they would tell me what they're\nthinking but they like literally don't\nknow how to detect a particular emotion\nif i point it out to them they can they\ncan recognize it but so there's just a\nthere's like a cultural gap and\nunderstanding gap there second thing to\nconsider is that i would ask your\nparents why aren't you disappointed have\nyou ever asked them that right yeah\nno right so like i feel disappointed in\nmyself can you help me understand why\nyou aren't disappointed like how do you\nunderstand like what's going on in my\nlife like when you see me like what do\nyou see what do you think my\ndifficulties are you know do you think\ni'm doing a good job do you think i'm\ndoing a bad job and the last thing that\ni'd say is you know how do you deal with\nthe disappointment and i i don't know\nhow else to say this is someone who you\nknow i mean i started i haven't asked\nyou how old you are but you know i'm\nguessing mid to late 20s ish yeah 24.\nokay okay so i mean you're starting your\ncareer you're starting your education as\na psychologist the age of 24 right so\nand i started\nmy career i started my education as a\nmedical doctor at the age of 27 or 28. i\nturned 28 like one month after i started\nmed school and what i can tell you being\non the other side is it's like\nabsolutely worth it and it's actually\nokay to feel like a failure it's okay to\nbe disappointed in yourself and like\nit's okay to not know\nhow to live life right at the beginning\nand that it takes us a while to figure\nthings out and sometimes we make\nmistakes but it's through mistakes that\nwe understand things and as we\nunderstand things as we start to\nstruggle ourselves and overcome our\nstruggles\nit doesn't happen right away it's that\nunderstanding which when we try to help\nother people makes us\nheroes in their eyes okay what do you\nthink about that i mean logically sure\nthe emotion still lasts\nlike on a day-to-day basis like it\ndoesn't stop so yeah so i mean i do feel\ngood i do feel less anxious i do feel\nless depressed i don't feel like i don't\ni don't i i can't look myself in the\nmirror again and say that you you're\ndoing good like that's something like\nthat that i that i did three months and\nthat was awesome to feel but the idea\nthat i have to\ngo through\nschool again with people who don't even\nknow what life is at 17 they're they're\nthey're starting out college at 17 and\ni'm 24 i'm basically seven years older\nlike that i mean yeah like i i have no\nwords put to this i'm really sorry about\nthat i hope i get it on i guess i get it\nbecause i i did the same right so\ni i went to school with a bunch of 22\nyear olds when i was 28. and what i\nactually learned was kind of interesting\nit's actually way easier so\nyou feel ashamed for being older but\nthat experience is gonna like be at\nleast for me it was i realized like as\nsoon as i stopped comparing myself in\nterms of ages what i realized is that\nstuff bothered them that didn't bother\nme because i had actually been out into\nthe real world and i knew\nwhat what mattered right like i had\nfailed and so what happened is i had all\nthese colleagues who were like terrified\nof getting a b because they thought that\nwas failure like i had actually failed\nthat was like a b a no one's gonna kick\nme out of school with a b and so they\nwere so stressed out for getting a b and\ni was like you know it'd be nice if i\ngot an a but i'm still i got into med\nschool i'm moving on my path i'm\nprobably going to be a doctor one day as\nlong as i don't screw it up and like\nthat's what's really important to me and\ni mean it's hard chris because i think\nthat like the challenge here is that i\nsee that you're suffering a lot you feel\na lot of guilt you feel a lot of shame\ni'm also hearing that you can be proud\nof yourself and i don't know how to say\nthis but first of all i don't think that\nthere's anything i can say today that'll\nmake all those negative feelings go away\nand the second thing is that i don't\nwant to make those negative feelings go\naway i think that\ni think that what's gonna make you an\namazing psychologist and therapist is\nactually having gone through this stuff\nit's not just that you care about other\npeople it's that you know what it is to\nfeel shame you know what it is to feel\nlike a failure and you can't see this\nnow but i sort of can you know 10 years\nfrom now you're going to be in your\noffice and a 22 year old kid 24 year old\nkid is going to come into your office\nand they're going to say\ni work in marketing and i absolutely\nhate it but i feel too guilty to leave\nand you're going to be able to help that\nperson because of your own struggles and\nyour own suffering and like when i think\nabout you know what's made me the person\nthat i am today i wouldn't go back and\nchange anything because i understood so\nmuch through my own struggles it's like\nit's valuable information and the good\nnews is that you will get better at it\nright you say that you look in the\nmirror and you can feel proud of\nyourself and you still feel ashamed less\ngreat but like i don't think that's a\nbad thing i think that's part of your\njourney that's part of your growth you\nknow we we become the people that we are\nnot just through our successes but also\nthrough our failures and this is hard\nbecause in in indonesian society you\nknow i'm making some assumptions here\nbut i know some of the culture like\nfailure isn't a good thing in any way\nshape or form we you just don't think\nabout it that way right it's just\nthere's\nsuccesses you have the better you are\nand you live in a society where like\nthey judge you like that which is why\nwhich is exactly why it's going to be so\nimportant because 10 years from now\nthere are going to be tons of kids who\nare growing up in that same society who\nare going to feel like absolutely\nnothing because they failed and they're\ngoing to need a therapist who\nunderstands that the downside is that\nyou have to suffer through this in order\nto help those people\nat least that's been my experience and\nmy journey i mean your journey may be\ndifferent but at least on the bright\nside like after\nwhat eight years i get to be called dr k\nas well\nsure great yeah yeah i think i i do\nunderstand now i i understand better i\nguess i i can't say that that's\nway better now than the first time we\nsaid hello so yeah and i mean i think\nit's you know you've got some deep stuff\ndown there chris and that's like it's i\ndon't know what i'll say man it's it's\nokay like this is just your journey and\nit's gonna have uncertainty and like you\nknow i may be good at particular things\nbut i i can't look into the future and\ntell you everything is going to be okay\ni mean i have faith that it will and the\nlast thing is i would seriously like\nconsider talking to your parents about\nwhy don't they think that you're a\nfailure like if you can stomach that\nconversation and even if they say and\nthis is the most challenging thing is\nthat we don't want to be a\ndisappointment but what's actually\nhealthier than that is being a\ndisappointment and being okay with it\nbecause it's life like no one's perfect\nthanks man i think i'm going to need it\nokay adios bye-bye thanks for calling in\nyeah i mean it's tough you know like we\njust have to be careful because a lot of\ntimes what we want to do is avoid\nnegative emotions and we think that\nwe're doing the right thing in life\nbecause we don't feel bad about it\nliving a life in which we avoid negative\nemotions isn't necessarily going to lead\nus to happiness and that's the most\nconfusing thing and the reason that it's\nlike it's okay to make those kinds of\nmistakes is because no one ever explains\nit to us like that right like does\nanyone did anyone sit down with chris\nand ask him why are you going into\nmarketing did they have these\nheart-to-heart discussions what does it\nfeel like to you know spend eight months\ntrying to get into french universities\nand failing to get in like what's\ndriving you to choose this does that\nanyone sit down and ask you these kinds\nof questions so that you can understand\nno of course not so we live life on\nautopilot and the destination is the\navoidance of negative emotion at all\ncosts it's how we pick careers\nit's how we pick relationships it's how\nwe stay in relationships that we\nshouldn't stay in it's why we use drugs\nso you have got to really be critical\nabout why are we trying to do this you\nknow what are we trying to avoid here\nand like i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut the more that we embrace\nnegative emotion we're not saying go out\nthere and try to create as much negative\nemotion as possible what i'm saying is\nthat align your decisions based on what\nyou really care about and don't let pain\nsuffering fear or shame get in the way\nof you moving towards what you care\nabout\nyou"
