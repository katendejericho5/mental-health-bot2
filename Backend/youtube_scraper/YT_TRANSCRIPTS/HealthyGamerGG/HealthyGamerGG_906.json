    "transcript": "because it isn't a possibility in fact\nthe more of a possibility it becomes\nthe more overwhelming it feels\nokay\nso anxiety over knowing the right thing\nto do but finding it too overwhelming to\ncarry out\npretty much the title this happens with\nhobbies\nschool work daily life tasks where i'm\nacutely aware of the most guaranteed way\nof successfully doing the thing\nand finding it too overwhelming\nhowever the most optimal way of\ncompleting a task slash practicing a\nhobby etc is obviously the most taxing\nquote-unquote perfect method\nif i'm writing an essay it means looking\nthrough all the relevant sources making\nsure each paragraph is concise yet\ndetailed and going over it 10 more times\nto vary my word choice\nmore fix sentences and essentially make\nit the most perfect i can manage\nthis is obviously mentally and\nphysically taxing but the fact that\nother people can do it\nand i've done it before quote unquote\neven if it was exhausting and i know\nthis is the best most correct way of\ndoing it anything less would be laziness\nand produce bad work then i'll regret it\nas it'll be my own fault\nstops me from doing any less or\notherwise i just won't try at all\ni try to convince myself that people\ndon't function like this that they're\nnot one hundred percent quote unquote on\nall the time and absolutely producing\nthe peak of their work at all times but\nit just seems like cope to me\nthat i'm just weak and get overwhelmed\nby what people can handle with ease and\nthere's something fundamentally wrong\nwith me any advice on how to deal with\nthis\nso sometimes\nwe want to do something\nand what we want to do can be done in a\ncouple different ways\nwe can do it\nokay\nor we can do it the way that it's\nsupposed to be done\nbut as this person points out\nif we're doing things the way that\nthey're supposed to be done\nit's more effort\nit's more taxing right there's like a\nproper way of doing things there's an\nideal way of doing things\nand then what complicates\nfactors even more is even if we start to\ntell ourselves okay well like i don't\nhave to be perfect right i can just get\nstarted\nor like you know i really just need to\nget it done a b maybe is okay\nthere's another part of our mind that\nsays other people can do it other people\nget a's\nand what's even the most devastating is\ni have gotten an a in the past\ni've done it properly i've looked\nthrough all the sources i've made each\nmade sure each paragraph is concise yet\ndetailed\nand if you've done it well before if\nyou've done it close to perfect before\nand if other people do it close to\nperfect before\nit's an option\nand this is what makes things so hard\nbecause if it wasn't really an option\nthen\nit would be easy right like it's like oh\nlike i'm not i'm never going to win a\ngold medal in swimming so\ni can just go swimming and i don't have\nto worry about not winning the gold\nbut if you've ever done it right before\nyou know that's a possibility for you\nand if you know it's a possibility for\nyou\nthen you want to find that formula to\nactually like find it\nright you want to achieve it because you\nknow you can do it you just need to find\nthe right way to do it\nand that's what makes it so paralyzing\nbecause it isn't a possibility in fact\nthe more of a possibility it becomes\nthe more overwhelming it feels\nwhich i want you all to think about for\na second\nbecause that's\ndevastating\nbecause if i can do it\nthen i can't settle for any less\nand so some people will look at this and\nthey'll accurately say okay like\nthis is perfectionism you need to stop\nbeing so\nperfectionistic and they'll give us good\nadvice\nthey'll say things like don't let\nperfect be the enemy of good\nyour goal should not be to do it perfect\nyour goal should be\nto do it good enough\njust get started getting started is the\nhard part you can always revise your way\nto perfection later\nthis is the right answer\nand we know it's the right answer we\nrecognize we're being perfectionistic\nwe recognize that we should be able to\nyou know just get started\nso then why don't we\nso this is what's so hard about this\nkind of situation when you know you can\ndo a good job\nand you know that getting started is the\nright answer you know that being not\nperfectionistic is the right answer how\nthe hell do you do that\nso here's one tip\nif you have perfectionistic behavior\nand you feel overwhelmed\nby starting a task that you know deep in\nyour heart that you can do\nhow do you approach this even if you\nknow that the right answer is stop being\nperfectionistic and just get started why\nis that hard to do\nthat may be the right answer on paper\nbut internally how do we get to that\npoint so that's what i'd love to share\nwith y'all today\nso we're going to start by kind of\nrecapping the weird thing about this\nis that you can do perfect\nright it's possible you've done it\nbefore you can get an a plus on this\nessay if you put forth the right kind of\neffort\nand now this is when if i can get an a\nplus and you're telling me just settle\nfor a b minus like\ni don't want to do that\nthat's a terrible idea why would i\nsettle\nfor a b minus when i could get an a plus\nthat sounds idiotic\nand by the way other people can get a\npluses too and i'm just as smart as they\nare\nand if i settle for a b minus how will i\never get an a plus\nthis sounds like a terrible idea because\nif i settle for a b minus then all i'm\ngoing to get is b minuses instead don't\nyou think it's better if instead of\nsettling for a b minus i figure out what\nthe hell is wrong with me fix it so i\ncan get a pluses here on out\ndoesn't that sound like a better\nstrategy than just settling for a b\nminus and just getting started because i\nknow that just getting started isn't\ngonna do actually a good job\nso we have to appreciate what your mind\ndoes\nwhat is your mind actually doing\nis it being paralyzed by perfectionism\nsure\nshould you just stop being\nperfectionistic absolutely in the same\nway you should just go to the gym every\nday eat healthy cut out caffeine etc etc\netc\njust be less perfectionistic bro\njust be less perfectionistic girl\nso there's a skill\nthat we as a society have lost\nwe used to do this\nas humans\nbut we've lost this skill\nand if you want\nto let go of your perfectionism and\nstill do a good job this is a skill that\nyou need to learn\ni don't know that we ever taught it\nexplicitly and we never needed to teach\nit explicitly because we sort of did it\nso much\nso naturally\nbut now that we don't even do it\nnaturally we actually have to explicitly\nteach it\ni see a lot of people are guessing\npatience\nexperimentation the skill is grieve\nyou have to learn how to grieve\nso i even sort of noticed this over the\nlast 20 years so like i live in the\nunited states\nand on september 11 2001 we had a couple\nof planes fly into the twin towers it\nwas a devastating moment\nright and we as a nation\ngrieved\neveryone was grieving\ntogether\nand like we mourned and people in new\nyork city became really nice and stuff\nlike that\nand that was the last time that i really\nremember\nat least in the u.s the nation as a\nwhole grieving\nand since then i don't know if you all\nhave noticed\nbut we have disasters all the time\nand we've just become numb to them\nso many years ago there was also like a\nschool shooting at this this place\ncalled the columbine high school in the\nunited states\nand it was such an event\nthat\nsomeone made a documentary about it\nand everyone was like oh my god this is\nwhat's going on and then like they\nhappened again and again and again and\nagain\nso we used to like grieve as a society\nright so like even tribally when someone\npasses away we used to have like these\ngrieving rituals\npeople would go through grief there'd be\nthe wake there'd be the funeral all this\nkind of stuff we still kind of do those\nthings\nbut now when you go to a funeral\nwhat do you see\nwhat are people doing\neveryone's on their phone\nwe've become numb to loss\nwe've started to use distraction instead\nof grief\nbecause distraction is so easy now\noh something else is going on in the\nworld am i going to stop and reflect on\nit\nright i recently saw\nsomeone saying\nmake a tick tock\nso a couple months ago hopefully we can\nfind this clip somewhere but a couple\nmonths ago i saw a tick tock\nof a nurse\ngrieving very very publicly after losing\na patient\nand there was this like epic country\nmusic or something in the background and\nthe nurse is like throwing her mask down\non the ground and she's like\nand like i want to just understand what\nthe hell how did that happen did you\nlose the patient\ndid you go to a quiet part of the\nhospital did you set up your phone make\nsure the angle was good make sure was\nthe focus was good walk to the other\nside of the room start recording\nkind of check it and then do this like\nthis what\nthis is what society has become\nand now when something goes wrong in\nyour life what do you do\ngot fired for your job\nall right let's go home\nfeel sad about ourselves maybe get high\nmaybe play some video games maybe binge\nwatch some stuff\nmaybe write some angry posts or angry\ntweets on the internet\nso we've forgotten how to grieve\nwe just don't grieve anymore\nand this is why everyone is like so\nmessed up because we've forgotten how to\nlet go of things we've forgotten how to\nbe sad and move on\nnow remember we're talking about\nperfectionism so what does it have to do\nwith perfectionism\nreally simple\nso if you want to stop being\nperfectionistic\nyou got to grieve that perfection\ngot to let it go\nso stop and ask yourself\nwhat would it mean\nif i didn't do it perfect\nwhat would it mean if i got a b minus\ninstead of an a plus\nwhat would that do to me how would i\nthink about myself\nbecause in your mind\nyou've got a perfect version of you\na plus\nand you want to be that so bad\nyou don't want to give it up\nyou're going to keep it alive on life\nsupport as long as you can you can't let\nthat perfect version of you go\nbecause it's devastating right because\nif you let it go\nwhat do you become\ni don't want to be this\ni don't want to be this i want to be\nthis\nthe challenge\nis that when you strive for this this is\nso hard to achieve that as you pointed\nout it's overwhelming\nit's paralyzing\nso start to ask yourself\nso how do you grieve\nright you process the loss what would it\nmean to no longer be an a plus student\noh my god that would be so devastating\nit would hurt wouldn't it\nacknowledge that hurt\nwhat would it mean about your future\nit would mean that my future is dark and\ngrim\nwell how's your future now\nwell it's dark and grim but it could be\nbrighter\nif i could overcome the feeling of\noverwhelmed and and go to this\nand something magical will happen so\nthis happens with everyone who grieves\nwhen you lose a loved one\nyou think oh my god the future will\nnever be the same and that's true right\nthat person will never be there again\nif they've passed away\nbut it doesn't mean that your future is\nbleak without them\nand this is what the process of grief is\nit's taking a negative event\ninternalizing it and reshaping the\nfuture in a bizarrely even hopeful way\nright so like even if we lose a loved\none like there's a part of them that\nstays with us it shapes us we honor\ntheir memory\nit makes us in a weird way like\nbetter people\nwould it be nicer if they were still\nalive sure\nbut the future doesn't have to be bleak\njust because we've grieved some part of\nour life\nin fact what we tend to find and i know\nthis sounds really bizarre but this is\nwhere kind of the science comes in\npeople who go through a healthy grieving\nprocess tend to be like better off\nafterward\nversus the ones who stay attached to the\npossibility\nlive in the past are the ones that get\nstuck\nand so let's think about this for a\nsecond because if your mind tells you\ni've gotten an a plus in the past here's\nhow i did it\nwhere is your mind living\nis it living in the past or is it living\nin the present\nand the more that we get stuck in the\npast the more paralyzed we become in the\npresent\nhow do you undo that you grieve\nso if you're struggling with\nperfectionism and feeling overwhelmed by\nnot doing it good enough i start by\ngrieving\nand what does that mean practically it\nstarts by asking yourself why am i so\nattached to this what does it mean for\nme to do this how would i feel about\nmyself if i did not do that\nhow would i feel about myself\nif i just started\nwriting the essay and not reading all\nthe sources ahead of time\nwell i would feel bad\nwell hold on a second\nwhat part of you would feel bad\nif you spent the next hour jotting down\nnotes of an essay and you paused and you\nasked yourself how did i feel about\nmyself how would i feel about myself\nthis is where things become wild\nbecause if you actually do that you're\nactually going to feel good about\nyourself you didn't do it perfect but\nthere's still plenty of time\nyou got something done you got started\nversus how would you feel about yourself\nif you continued to chase that\nperfection\nand didn't do anything for an hour\nyou'd feel broken\nyou'd feel busted\nand this is the magic of grief\nbecause grief takes something that is a\nnegative event\nand somehow transmutes it into something\nthat is somewhat positive\nwe're not saying it's a net win\nbut it's the way that you take a\nnegative event and you transmute it into\nsomething positive\nso start to really ask yourself what\ndoes this mean for me what what would it\nmean for me to just get started what\nwould i be giving up\nand grieve that perfect self\nand as you grieve that perfect self the\nparalysis will go away\nand as the paralysis goes away\nyou will start to act more\nas you start moving forward\nparadoxically\nyou go closer to getting the a plus you\nmove away from the b minus\nand this is why it's so hard\nbecause achieving perfection starts with\nletting perfection go\nwe don't want to though\nbecause if we let it go then there's no\nguarantee\nand that's a big part of grief\nwhen a relationship ends\ni want to hold on to that relationship\nwhy do i want to hold on to that\nrelationship because there's no\nguarantee that i'll meet someone in the\nfuture\nso big part of that grief process is\nembracing the uncertainty\nso if you struggle with perfectionism\nand feel overwhelmed because you know\nyou can do it\nand you don't want to settle\nwhat you actually need to do is grieve\nit's not settling it's letting go\nof that perfection\nand paradoxically as you let go of the\nperfection you actually take a step\ncloser to it\nquestions\nso someone uh that's the weird girl is\nasking how is grieving different from\nreminiscing or nostalgia so revenue or\nnostalgia can be part of the grieving\nprocess\nbut grieving is how you so\nnostalgia and reminiscing is when you\nliterally go into the past\nyou sit there remembering\ngrieving is the process of\ntaking a loss\nand kind of like internalizing it and\nthen looking forward\nso reminiscing like you can reminisce as\npart of the process of grief\nright but then like you have to\ninternalize that process and then like\nlook forward because grieving is\nultimately about moving forward it's not\nabout going into the past and in fact\nwhen people get stuck in the past is\nwhen they don't grieve\nokay a lot of good questions\nso how to grieve when pain is actually\nunbearable and invokes physical symptoms\nso the first thing that i'd say is that\nif you're having physical symptoms you\nshould probably go see a medical\nprofessional and make sure that it isn't\na physical problem\nbut sometimes the process of that grief\ndoes feel unbearable\nand this is the kind of interesting\nthing where we sort of know that pain is\na psychosomatic symptom\nnow sometimes when people hear the word\npsychosomatic what they they interpret\nit as is it's all in your head\nbut that's not my experience\nso here's what we need to understand\nabout the body in the mind\nand to a certain degree even things like\nthe soul if you believe in that stuff\nis that it's all connected\nso any insult to your body or any attack\non your body will affect your mind and\nany effect on your mind will any attack\non your mind will affect your body\nright we know this so for example\nemotions are a really good example of\nsomething that both both manifests\nmentally and manifests physically\ntightness in my chest queasiness in my\nstomach fear in my head\nso for sometimes what happens with\npeople who struggle to grieve is\nthey can't they don't do the mental\nprocess up here and so that pain comes\nout physically\nso interestingly enough the solution to\nthe physical stuff if you have\npsychosomatic pain is actually mental\nwork and what confuses people is that\nwhen you have psychosomatic pain and\nthey send you to a psychologist you may\nthink it's all in your head or it can\nfeel very invalidating\nwhereas that's not the case it's it's\nnot it's just that these two things are\nconnected\nand that physically we can only do so\nmuch for you\nand so the thing that's left is the\nmental component\nso when the pain is very unbearable\nthat's when i think process and grief\nbecomes really really important\nbecause then you leverage your mind to\nhelp your pain\nso caleb hates games is asking how do\nyou know when you're done grieving and\nnot just ignoring the problem\nkind of easy actually\nit's like\nwhat do you feel like when you wake up\non a day-to-day basis\nis your life moving in the right\ndirection\nso when you grieve healthily\nyou generally speaking feel like\noptimistic and good about the future\nand when you're ignoring the problem you\nmay distract yourself\nbut in the back your mind there's going\nto be like a\nlike there's going to be a\na very very tiny person at the back of\nyour mind screaming at the top of their\nlungs\nwhen you're ignoring a problem\nand when you grieve that person is\ncontent\nso the other thing that people are\nasking another thing to to ask about you\nknow how do you know when you're done\ngrieving so grieving doesn't necessarily\nfinish in a in that way\nso like grief is something that can\ncontinue to manifest over time\nso you may be like done with like a\nparticular stage of grieving but a year\nlater let's say that you know so you\nsomeone that you love passed away and\ntheir birthday rolls around and during\ntheir birthday it's like okay for that\ngrief to come up again\nso sometimes it's like a bit of a\njourney there's like it's episodes\nso\njustin tunes is asking how do you grieve\nover a high expectation\nit's a good question so\nhere are the steps to like\nsimply is com i mean it's hard but it's\nsimple\nask yourself where this expectation came\nfrom\nask yourself what it would feel like\nto not live up to that expectation\nand then\nhave compassion towards yourself with\nthat disappointment\nand once you have compassion towards\nyourself\nthen you can start to ask yourself okay\nso like what can we do about it\nso i'll give you all kind of a simple\nexample\nlet's say i'm a coach\nokay\nand let's say that my team lost a game\nso if i'm that coach what do i tell my\nteam\nso we sit down and we say\nis it does it suck\nthat we lost the game\nabsolutely\ncould we have played better absolutely\nin what ways could we have played better\nokay this this and this\nnow just because we lost that game and\njust because we played better\ndoesn't mean that we are failures\ndo we need to learn from our lessons a\nhundred percent\nso here's what i want you to do\ni don't think you're a bad person i\ndon't think you're a failure at life you\nlost a game\ni want you to practice\ni want you to prepare for next week\nthe loss is over let it go\nwe're going to learn lessons from it and\ni have faith in you that you can win\nnext week\ndoes that make sense\nthat's just the process you have to do\nwith yourself when you go through grief\nand when you want to let go of like high\nexpectations\nit's acknowledging your shortcomings\nhaving compassion and then formulating a\nplan to move forward\nokay\nthere's a good question how do i grieve\na long farewell such as a family member\nwith alzheimer's who's ill for years\nthat's really challenging that's the\nkind of thing where um i wish there was\na simple answer to it\nso losing a family member with\nalzheimer's has a very very bittersweet\nkind of grief\nso on the one hand it can hurt more to\nsee this person become a shell of who\nthey used to be\nand it can also be a blessing because\nyou get the benefit of time\nright so like they don't go away\ncompletely like if you want to say words\nto them you can say words to them things\nlike that\nso i think that's really where if you're\nreally struggling with someone who's got\nalzheimer's what i would really really\nrecommend is chances are there's a\nmedical professional involved\nright especially if there's a diagnosis\nfor alzheimer's and if they've got a\nneurologist or a psychiatrist or\nsomething like that i would talk to them\nand say you know do you have any\nrecommendations for resources or support\naround grieving someone who's like\nsuffering from a chronic illness\nso thankfully in in\nillnesses like cancer like we've got\nthat\nthere's a lot more support generally\nspeaking for things like cancer\ntreatment and grief\nit's bittersweet because sometimes\npeople want to lose someone kind of like\na band-aid where it's like you know they\njust die and there's not a protracted\nprocess\nand the downside of that is that you\ndon't get to say goodbye\nright so it's it's it's challenging for\nsure"
