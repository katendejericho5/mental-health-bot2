    "transcript": "turn around like inspiring people like\nwhat this is what humans are capable of\nand the reason that we suffer the reason\nthat the world is going to is\nbecause we have forgotten this\nhello\nhi friend\nhi hi um i'm ginkgo nice to meet you\nginkgo\nyeah i i was thinking i i\nput on cam as well like the other people\nthink okay first\nconnection\ni mean so once again since we haven't\nsort of set that frame properly we're\nnot going to uh show your face on stream\nwe'll sort of sort that out for next\ntime though\num so tell me ginkgo welcome\num so can you tell me a little bit how\nare your friendships\nso i'd say they're good but there's a\ncatch obviously that's what we're here\nah they're very much lacking like\nproximity of course i don't leave my\nhouse they don't leave their house or\ntheir online friends\num\nand then i just don't know what to do\nwith them i don't know what i want from\nthem or the concept of friendship\nuh i want closeness but\ni am not vulnerable\num\nmaybe i could do stuff with them like\nhobbies but\ni do a lot of hobbies these days\nand\nthen all i have left are calls and texts\nand those don't really\nuh\nhit the same\nsure um\nso i guess i have people i like who like\nme but i still feel very lonely\nthat sounds tough\nyeah\ni mean i think the whole point of\nhaving people that like you and you\nliking people is that it's supposed to\nhelp with the loneliness right\ni would hope so\num\ni'm sorry that you feel that way ginkgo\nit sounds it sounds tough\ncan you tell me a little bit more about\nso\nwhen you say lacking proximity do you\nhave friends that are sort of\ngeographically near you and you all just\ndon't leave the house or\nare mostly\nokay have um\ni have friends that i\nthey're basically from high school\nand we just maintain our own discord a\ncouple of them i still play games with\num but our amounts are barely\nand i don't see\nany of them individually\nokay at all\nand and are you all able to\ngeographically meet or is that uh like\nis there a geographical barrier there\nuh\ni live in car central america it seems a\nlot of us can't drive\nso that's a barrier uh right there\ntransportation\nokay\nwhen you say a lot of us can't drive\nhelp me understand that statement a\nlittle\nso let me tell my friend group\nyeah so i what i'm trying to figure out\nhere is whether\nso ginkgo here's here's where my\nquestions are coming from\nso sometimes there's a very real\ngeographical or physical barrier to\nmeeting in person\nand then what keeps people from meeting\nin person is a little bit more internal\nmaybe related to vulnerability or\nanxiety or something like that\nbut if there's a real geographical\nbarrier that necessitates a different\napproach does that make sense\nyeah so so\ni'm just trying that's why i'm asking\nquestions about you know driving and\nstuff like that so\nand when you say a lot of us can't drive\nis that the kind of thing where even if\nyou were able to drive would you have\naccess to a car or\nwould you not even have access to a car\nso there's like no point in and being\nable to drive\ni\nwould have access to a car\nprobably um current vehicle that my\nfamily owns is\nnot doing too well engine needs to be\nentirely replaced so i guess not\nproximity um geographical\nuh\nlimitations are definitely getting in\nthe way\nyeah and and so that so that sounds\nreally hard right if you're if you're in\na\nin sort of like a\num\na resource restricted situation because\ni think sometimes when we talk about\nmaking friends and forming relationships\nwe kind of assume that people can get\nfrom point a to point b\nand and you know we're kind of focusing\non anxiety and things like that whereas\nthe the truth of the matter is that\nsometimes it's actually really hard like\nphysically\num so that sounds tough i mean do you\nthink that\nyou know that that is a solvable problem\nin some way or is that basically like\nnot solvable\nbetween in your friend group\ni'm working on it i\ni've got a permit um i just need to\npractice the driving and part of why i\nintend to move on campus soon because\ni'm going to college is i'll have buses\ni'll have a roommate i have people\naround me who i can just walk to and see\num and hopefully i can like pay for\nsomebody out there to teach me how to\ndrive and always a car so i think that\nthat can be\nworked around um at the moment i'm\nbasically\nentirely isolated and out of practice\nwith human beings\nokay\nso first thing i i want to commend you\nfor um setting up a plan to overcome the\ngeographical barriers like that's\nactually\nnot to be underestimated that's huge\nlike strong work there\nuh and it also sounds like you feel\ndifficult it sounds like it's it's\ndifficult to be vulnerable with other\npeople and\nyou feel rusty socially\noh\nyeah i was\ni mean in high school i\ni didn't have any issues i mean\ni would say there were some issues i\nput on\na mask in front of people\num but at least i could see them every\nday\num and i had friendships i had people\nwho i could call friends and now\ni\ni don't know if i can reasonably call\nno they're my friends they're my friends\nthey're good to me i'm good to them\nwe're just not close\nhow do you think that happened what\nchanged how did y'all drift apart\ni was never close to them i just didn't\nknow it um\noh interesting i\nyeah i growing up i never had people\ncome and hang out and back then they\ncould like they could just go on my bus\nwith me or our parents could\nmeet up and have us hang out and i i\ndon't know every day i'd go home go back\nto my my little cave my room and i would\njust like be there\num\ni i'm not going to drag too many\nclinical\nuh diagnosis in here but\ni definitely got some avoiding\nattachment up in here i just feel very\navoided towards people um\nlike\nthe idea of inviting them over like no\nthis is my house you can't come in my\nhouse this is my space you can't come in\nmy room on my house and if i go over to\nthem it's like now i'm in i'm in their\nenvironment and i i can't easily leave\nokay\nso\ni'm hearing almost like an internal\nconflict of sorts where you don't feel\nsafe\nhaving them in your space\nand yet you feel lonely is that fair to\nsay\nyeah i don't want to argue that it's\nsafety i mean they're safe to be around\nbut\ni i have a lot of conflicts with this\nwhole issue of my friendships because i\nwant to be closer to them\nbut i don't\nwant to do anything that gets me closer\nto them\nwhat what gets\nwhat makes you not want to do anything\nthat makes you closer to them help me\nunderstand that\num let me let me let me think for a\nsecond oh no\ni'm sorry yeah go for it all right i was\nkidding\ni\ni don't know how i don't know\nwhat i'm doing um\nor\nhow to talk to people i can talk i can\ntalk to people i'm talking right now but\nuh\ni could talk about things i like i can\ntalk about my interests i can talk about\nthe fact that i spent two days doing a\ncomplete password overhaul and making a\nnew email and learning about security\nand password cracking\nbut can i\ndo anything with hey\nhow are you not really i don't really\nknow where to go from there i don't know\nhow to talk to people unless i have\nsomething i know what i want to talk\nabout something i'm really interested to\ntalk about\nand i don't feel comfortable just\ndropping in their dms just ranting and\nrambling about whatever fixation i've\ngot today\nokay\num a couple of questions ginkgo\nso when you were growing up did you did\nyour parents like\narrange play dates and stuff for you\nor your family\nmy mom\nbless her heart she does try her best\nshe's very absent though um not on\npurpose but uh she she didn't really\nraise me very much that was my uh\nnana's\njob it ended up being\nso\ni wouldn't say she really\ndid anything in that regards helping me\nsocialize in fact she\ndidn't really socialize herself she was\njust in the house\non the couch all day\num and then she would tell me hey go out\ngo make some friends go join some clubs\nbut wasn't really setting that example\nherself\nokay\nso i'm hearing that you don't feel and\nplease let me know if this word is\ninappropriate or harsh but you don't\nfeel competence\nin social situations\nlike you don't know how\nto form a relationship with people\ni would say that's that's the most\naccurate thing because a lot of\num i guess\nwhen i look up things and even some of\nyour videos it's uh\nit can be the conversations\nbut i don't know about the relationship\nlike i can have a conversation with\npeople and they can like me and i can\nlike them\nbut can i maintain a relationship with\nthem\nnot at all\nokay\nso let me ask you something ginkgo whose\nfault is that\nchat can't see your face but they can\nhear your sigh so thank you for that\ni mean\nthere have been times when i've blamed\nmyself\num\nthere have been times when i've blamed\nmy mom like\nwhy why couldn't she\nhave been there for me why couldn't she\nhave like\num\nleft me in a place where i could feel\nsecure and to be\nemotionally vulnerable with people\nand then sometimes i'm like why can't\nsociety be better yeah\nthey be better than me\nso i don't know i've blamed everybody\nokay\nmyself\nso i noticed that when i asked you that\nquestion i i can see more emotion in\nyour face\ndo you know what you're feeling right\nnow\nno\nare you feeling stuff close your eyes\nfor a second\nlike pay attention to your like physical\nsensations like are you feeling stuff\nright now\nand if the answer is no that's okay\nyou notice anything i\ni feel\nuh\na little jittery okay a little uh aware\nand alert okay and a little nervous i\nguess okay\num so let's ask the question in a\num\nso i think it's it's\nyour answer was like a really good one\nbecause you you know over time have\nworked on this issue right at times you\nblame yourself at times you blame your\nmom at times you blame society it's\nsociety's fault\nso let me ask you a different question\nso let's move away from blame and fault\nfor a second why do you think it is that\nyou don't know how to form relationships\num\ni've been dealt with shitty hands\nokay the cards are not in my favor too\nmany too many factors have led to where\ni currently am today\nand some of those factors are\nme though i'm i'm barely an adult so\ni guess the majority of my life has been\ndue to others some of those factors are\nwho i was\nborn to\num\nothers of those factories are i live in\na time period where\na lot of people don't know how to talk\nto each other yep and uh\na lot of people don't go outside yep\nokay well said so let me ask you\nsomething when it when you think\nabout connecting with someone\ndo you feel\nsome sense of like shame at not knowing\nhow to do that\nhuh\ni'm not sure if i recognize it as saying\num what does it feel like to you\ni am\ndisappointed at my ineptitude\nand at the same time i don't want to\nhave to put up with this to begin with\num i wish i could just do the thing wish\ni knew how to do the thing i wish doing\nthe thing was actually pleasant enough\nto warrant learning how to do the thing\nbeautifully said kinko\nso i think you said in a much richer way\nwhat i would call shame\nright so like\nit's it's an inadequacy\nand it's not your fault\nbut it's still like why can't\ni know how to do this like it's so\nfrustrating you're frustrated with\nyourself\nright even though you acknowledge and\nthis is what i think is actually a\nreally awesome strength of yours is that\ni think cognitively up here you kind of\nknow that this isn't your fault\nright because it sounds like you're on\nthe younger side like you haven't really\nhad the capacity to for\nself-determination in your life right\nmost of your life has been like you're\nstill in your starting zone right you\nhaven't gotten to the open world part\nwhere you get to decide where you go and\nwhat you level up and things like that\nso like you you spawned in the game of\nlife and your tutorial did not include a\nwhole lot of social skills\nso that's really\nthat's really\ngood and and i want you to lean into\nthat part of yourself because you're\ngoing to need that cognitive\nunderstanding to help you sort of move\nforward okay\nso let's go through a couple of\ngeneralities so the first thing to\nunderstand is that as you've already\nsaid\ni think we sometimes\ndon't realize\nhow much of social relationship\nformation\ncomes from modeling\nour upbringing\nso like like if our parents don't have\nfriends like i don't know how else to\nsay this like if you're someone who's\nout there and listening to this\nand you don't have a whole lot of\nfriends the first question you should\nask yourself is do your friend or your\nparents have a bunch of friends\nwhen you grew up did you see\nwhat how relationships were formed\ndid you see your parents go out and meet\nnew people\nand form friendships with them and\ninvite them over to dinner and then\ninvite them over to birthday parties did\nyour parents go out of their way to\ncreate social opportunities for you\nbecause that's what you have to do as a\nparent right you got to take your kid to\nthe playground and you gotta have a\nbirthday party and you have to order\npizza and like when you're six\nwhether kids come over for your birthday\nparty and form a social connection with\nyou has nothing to do with you\nit has everything to do with what your\nparents or your family or whatever do\nfor you\nand so a lot of people and then what\nhappens is as we grow into adults and we\nbecome aware that we're struggling with\nthis i don't know how to do this\nand it's kind of interesting because\nit's sort of like then your your\nsolution is like okay i'm gonna like\nlearn about it right so then you start\ndoing the tutorial of social\ninteractions okay this is how i make\nsmall talk this is how i do this this is\nhow i do this but the tutorial even if\nit sort of says like okay this is how\nyou make small talk or this is how you\nbecome a good listener there's no\ntutorial for forming a connection with\nanother human being\ndoes that make sense\nuh yeah\nand so\nwhat we're sort of left with is people\nwho feel\ni'm going to use the word shame but i\nthink ginkgo you did a way better job at\ndescribing it like frustration with\nyourself why does it have to be this way\nwhy do i grow up in a generation where\nit's not just like this sort of lack of\nfamily support in terms of socializing\nbut also like everyone else out there\nis just socializing on discord or text\nor whatever\nright snapchat\nand so\nyou can feel incredibly frustrated with\nyourself and the challenge is that what\ndo you think all of those thoughts and\nfeelings do\nin terms of\naffecting your ability to interact with\nanother person\noh at times i've i've felt broken i i've\nbeen reminded time and time again you\nknow of all the factors outside of my\ncontrol that led me to be coming this\nway\nbut\ni still end up feeling like\nsomething's wrong with me something\nsomething's not working here something's\nbroken something is is missing\nas a human being\ni don't know yeah so so i think that's\nwell said and i know it sounds kind of\nweird because this is where like i'm\nsupposed to say like no like ginkgo like\nyou're complete and you're perfect just\nthe way you are there's nothing broken\nin you like\nyou know that's what\npeople think we should say but i think\nyou actually have a very mature outlook\nwhich is that it's not your fault\nand\nit feels like something's missing\nright\nand i think the reason it feels like\nsomething's missing is because something\nis missing\nlike i want to acknowledge that for a\nmoment i don't blame you\ni also think that just because\nsomething's missing i don't think so\neven if we accept for a moment that\nyou're broken i think you're absolutely\nfixable\nthat's where the difference lies\nbut i think it's important to\nacknowledge\nthat\nyou may not because if we think about\neven something like language right how\ndo we learn to speak\nit's because people around us talk\nhow do we learn to like walk in our\nmannerisms and the clothes that we wear\nso much of what we learn as human beings\nis through observation of what's going\non around us\nand what i'm hearing from you ginkgo is\nthat you really didn't have\nthe opportunity to observe a whole lot\nof social like\nconnection formation\nis that fair to say\nvery very true\nokay so that's probably what feels like\ni'm gonna use the word missing instead\nof broken does that work for you\nyeah\ni'm gonna ask i'm gonna ask you to think\nabout it for a second like can you\nreally\nlike do you feel like something's\nmissing or do you feel like it's busted\nat times i feel like it's busted and\nthat's in regard to\nchanging things rather than who i am\nright now like who i am right now yeah i\ncan say a lot of circumstances led here\nbut\nhow i fix that now that it's my\nresponsibility i am\na\nan adult an adolescent um\nand this is my fate\nah\nit's this insurmountable mountain all\nthese things i don't understand about\nother\nhumans and\nall the faults that end up chipping away\nat all my relationships that i don't\neven end up understanding and how i\ncould be so avoidant of people despite\nreally wanting to connect with them yeah\ni fixing all that now that feels like\nbrokenness that feels like impossibility\nyeah well said\nand and i think it's reasonable for you\nto feel like it's impossible\ni don't believe it's impossible but\ni don't oh\nokay sorry did i lag spike there for a\nsecond\nso\ni completely understand why you feel\nit's impossible and that's simply\nbecause you just haven't done it yet\nright so it feels insurmountable to you\nbecause here's what it's clear to me\nginkgo is that you're smart\nyou try\nand if you're smart and you put forth\neffort and it doesn't fix the problem\nlike sometimes it can feel like what\nmore could i possibly do right like i\ndon't even know how to start or it feels\nlike such an impossible mountain to\nclimb like i don't think it's ever gonna\nwork\nwhereas i have faith that you're going\nto learn how to form social connections\nbut i think it's also completely\nreasonable\nfor you to not have that faith\ndoes that sound okay\nyou're gonna what\ni'm gonna i'm gonna say okay\nwhat\nwhen you say i'm gonna say okay\nthat implies to me that what you're\nsaying does not mirror what you think or\nyou feel\nmaybe it doesn't so what do you think or\nfeel\ni think\nthat\ni need a whole rehabilitation program to\nfix the mess that is me\nand\ni am in therapy i do have a psychiatrist\num\nso there's that but like\ni don't know somebody\nif only i had like those social skills\nclasses like that um they give to\nautistic children i wish there was\nsomething like that for adults because\nlike as an adult\ni don't know\nwhat i can turn to to\nget past this and i don't know if i can\ndo it on my own\nokay wait so are you you know we do that\non discord right you know we have a\nsocial sandbox have you been to that\nyeah i've uh i've participated in it i\nenjoy it and is that\nyou say you enjoy it has it helped at\nall you're allowed to say no if it\nhasn't\ni liked it it has helped me um\nbut like it but also an issue is like\nrelationship maintaining and so\nthat's less about um maintaining\nrelationships yeah okay\nso you know here's the other thing i i'm\ngoing to agree with you that i think you\nneed an\noverhaul i think you need a rehab\nand i don't think it's as bad as you\nthink it is\nso here's what i'm noticing so you're\nyou're seeing a psychiatrist great\nyou're addressing geographical problems\ngreat\nyou're going to social sandbox great\nand there's going to be more to it than\nthat\nand here's the thing that that i i\nreally wish you could hear ginkgo and\nyou don't have to i'm not trying to\nshame you into hearing it but be patient\nwith yourself\nbecause thus far your loneliness\nis largely out of your control and\nyou're just barely starting to take the\nhelm\nright you've been running on autopilot\nfor a while you're just taking control\nlike you're the kind of person i've\nworked with people like you before like\ni'm thinking about college freshmen\nspecifically\nwho grew up in households where there\nwere not a whole lot of social\nopportunities\nand really struggle freshman year\nbut by the time sophomore year rolls\naround by the time junior rolls around\nthey've made a lot of progress they have\nfriends sometimes they have romantic\nrelationships they have mentors they\nhave people who are invested in them and\ncare about them because when someone's\nlike you are and is very genuine and is\ntrying because here's the thing like\npeople are gonna get behind you\nand when you say how am i supposed to\nfix this you're not you can't fix it on\nyour own but you're not gonna be alone\nwhich\ni completely understand if you don't\nbelieve\nbut you can't learn to be socially adept\non your own reading books in a room nor\ndo you need to accept the full\nresponsibility\nbecause thankfully the world is a place\nwhere when people try\na lot of people will support you\nand i think that because of things like\ngeography you haven't just haven't had\nthat experience yet\nand that's also where like you know if\nyou've grown up in a situation where\npeople were supposed to support you or\nweren't able to because they had a lot\nof challenges and things like that then\nlike you could it's it's also okay to\nlike understand why you wouldn't think\nthat other people will support you\nbut the kindness of strangers is a\npowerful thing\nand like i'm optimistic that you know\ntwo years from now you will be in a very\ndifferent place\nif you just keep doing what you're doing\nthe challenge is that there's no way for\nme to transmit that faith into you\nand so i'd encourage you to be patient\nwith yourself what do you think about\nthat\ni\ni can keep going for the hope that that\ncomes to\nfruition even if right now um\nit's hard for me to rely on others and\nbe comfortable\naround them or\nform intimate bonds that could change\nand if\num i'm putting in\nthe work maybe i'll see the results yeah\ni i think so what what do you think\ni mean\nto be fair like i don't think you can\nend this conversation be like yeah\nlike i'm gonna make a bunch of friends\nand i believe in myself like you're\nyou're not going to get there at the end\nof this conversation\nright like is that you okay with that\nyeah i i definitely still feel impatient\ni want i want this like fixed now\nbecause like loneliness feels like a\nneed it feels like something i need to\nto fill up and\neverything's in motion\nbut\nthe whole\nremains\nyeah so that's that's why you know what\ni'm asking you for is patience\nbecause because this is the hard thing\nabout your situation ginkgo is that you\nare actually doing everything that you\ncan\nright maybe not everything but you're\ndoing a lot you're doing what you can\ngiven your geographical boundaries you\ncan't drive you don't have access to a\ncar\nyou know your friends may not have\naccess to cars like you're doing kind of\neverything that you can and that's\nyou're beautifully said\nloneliness feels like a need and just\nbecause you've got the right strategy\ndoesn't make it hurt any less\nyeah\ni wish that\nvoid could be filled and the hurt to go\naway\nme too\nso i have one last thing to kind of\nshare with you\nwhat if i were to tell you that by\nhaving this conversation\nthere are people out there who are\nlistening who feel exactly the way that\nyou do\nbut even hearing you speak\nfills up their void just a tiny amount\nwhat do you think about that\ni would be confused how could that\nhappen\nit's a good question i don't know them\nand they don't know me\num\ni\ni don't know\nthat's\nhumans are strange little creatures yeah\nso i'm hearing you don't know how that\ncould happen\nis it fair to say you don't believe that\ncould happen\num\ni i believe you\nuh\ndo yeah\ndo you feel\nat all\nheard or understood\nthrough this conversation\nyes i feel i feel happier\nand obviously i i watch this channel and\nuh other people do as well\nand\nit makes me happy if\nthere are people who feel this way like\nme first of all i i wish that was not\nthe case\num but if that is the case\nthen i i guess\nyeah\ni'm i'm glad that there's a voice out\nthere that resonates with them\nyeah i think so\nyou know i wouldn't encourage you to\nwatch twitch chat now but you can go\nback and watch the vod later i'm not\nactually paying attention i'm just\nassuming the other thing is by the way\nyou said that you know part of the\nreason you have difficulty forming close\nrelationships is because you have you\ncan't be vulnerable with people is that\nright\nyeah how do you think you're doing with\nthat now\nthis is this is fine um i mean this is a\nspace in which\nis expected in in such areas i can do\njust fine i you know therapy\npsychiatry um this discord server these\nare all places where i can be vulnerable\num friendships without that\num\nalready\ni guess our relationship being\nestablished is having that\nno not gonna happen\nnot yet\nso\nhere's what i'd i'd leave with you\nginkgo\ni completely understand that there's a\nhuge difference\nbetween\ndiscord server\nbeing live on stream\nin a psychiatrist's office\nand the average friend or meeting people\nduring the first week of freshman\norientation that's it's going to be like\nnight and day\nbut\nif you think about learning how to swim\nwe learn how to swim in the kiddie pool\nwe don't jump right into the ocean\nand every step that you take in\nunderstanding your feelings being able\nto express your feelings being able to\nfeel your feelings\nyou level up a little bit\nand i'm that's why like i'm not\ni mean am i worried about you sure\nbut like i have hope for you and the\nreason that i have hope for you is\nbecause you're showing me that you're\nthoughtful you're gonna try and that you\ncan actually be vulnerable\nright and and all it is is like you know\nhow to do it it's just the situation is\ndifferent it's like swimming in a pool\nswimming in a lake swimming in an ocean\nswimming in a river\ndoes it require more skill at swimming\nabsolutely\nwe're not saying that just because you\ncan do one it makes it easier to do the\nother but\ni am saying that you got to learn how to\ndo it in the kiddie pool first and then\na pool and then a lake and then an ocean\nand we haven't even talked you know\nwe're talking about friendship today\nwhich is on purpose but then like even\nfriendships is going to be a stepping\nstone to potentially deeper connections\nromantic relationships or whatever\nright like not everything happens all at\nonce\nand that's why the main thing i know\nit's painful we're going to do what we\ncan for you in the meantime in terms of\ncome and hang out like we're going to do\nwe can with social sandbox we're going\nto do what we can on discord and things\nlike that\nbut the truth of the matter is that what\ni really hear from you ginkgo is that\nas as i i don't blame you for being\nimpatient\nyou know i think it makes perfect sense\nthat loneliness is a need it's like a\nhunger right it's like hunger and thirst\nlike\nif i'm hungry today and i start growing\nwheat\neven though i'm growing food which will\neventually satisfy my hunger it doesn't\nmake the hunger\nhurt less\nright\nyeah that's like that minecraft or that\nstardew valley\nright\nand that like i hate to break it but\nthat just sucks like in there ain't i\nmean\nit sucks\ncertifiably sucks\nyeah and i'm really sorry that you have\nto go through that\nand what i'm the only thing that makes\nme not cry in this moment is that like\ni've i feel strongly that if you just\nkeep doing what you're doing\nyou won't feel this way forever in fact\nyou won't even feel this way for the\nmajority of your life\nthat most of your life like you know\nlet's assume for a moment\nthat you're somewhere around 18\nand that you've got\n62 years left on this earth\nand that for like 55 plus of those years\ni think you're going to have connections\nand that even the suffering that you're\ngoing through today may shape you into\nthe person\nthat knows what loneliness feels like\nand that may\nhave a ripple effect on the people that\nyou meet and being able to see someone\non a park bench or you know\nfamily members or friends or whatever\nlike this is all part of your karma\nthe hand that you're dealt\nis it sure\nbut you're playing it really really well\nand you get to draw more cards\nand it's a deck building game\nand the the cards that you're adding to\nyour deck today are good but you got to\nwait for the reshuffle for them to come\naround and that's just that's just life\nit sucks\nthoughts\nyeah\ni\ni think i can believe that i think\nthere's evidence of it in my own life uh\ni am i actually just recently turned 20\nand two years ago at 18\nlife sucked even worse than it did now\num\ni didn't have the therapist or the\npsychiatrist instead i was getting\nhospitalized and since then\num i'm gonna go to college i'm gonna go\nto my my second year i'm gonna i'm gonna\nmeet people\ni'm gonna get my license i'm i'm okay\nwith just continuing to go until\num\ni get what i need\nginkgo you gotta be careful there\nbecause you keep talking like that\nyou're gonna start inspiring people\noh no i gotta hold back\ncan't be you can't be saying like\nthat\npeople are gonna be inspired\nthis is twitch this is the internet\nyou can't be going around\ngiving people faith\nin the future\ni i mean\ni do feel impatient and you've\nrecognized that but i also feel like um\nbecause i've come from a period of being\nsuicidal so now that i no longer feel\nthat way i feel like\nas long as i'm alive i have a chance i\nhave a chance to change things i have a\nchance for things to get better and i\ndon't know how my story's gonna end\ncould end on a low point um i don't know\nmaybe i sleep on a\nsome soap in my bathroom and i break my\nneck and that's the end uh\nbut for now\nevery every\num day\nevery every time i get to live at least\nan opportunity to\nto live a little better so yeah\nhopefully i get some friends that would\nbe really nice\nabsolutely ginkgo so so it's it's\nawesome to hear\nhow far you've come\ni think you said you kind of need an\noverhaul and i think the really sad\nthing is that\nthe optimistic thing the exciting thing\nis that you're actually get building\nthat overhaul one step at a time\nand what actually makes me really sad is\nthat you're the one who's had to build\nit\nbecause most people don't they're you\nknow they get help\nbut if you're seeing a psychiatrist it\nsounds like you're out of the hospital\nyou know you're kind of like going to\ncollege like this this is what this is\nwhat the overhaul looks like\none step at a time\nyou're taking care of your mental health\nyou're going to college you know you're\ngoing to social sandbox and getting\nbetter at small talk so you're not\ntalking to people about your password\nsecurity\nand get confused\nyou know\nyeah with me and last thing i'll leave\nyou with one last tip okay\nyou can't slip on the soap if you don't\nshower\noh you're telling me to be a filthy\ngamer\nright next level plays\nbut thank you so much for coming on\ntoday ginkgo and thank you so much for\nsharing any any kind of last thoughts or\nquestions before we wrap up\nthank you thank you for all you do thank\nyou for opening my eyes i i really can't\nunderstand you man uh people people they\nconfuse me but you studied them for like\nyears\nand then you talk to them for hours but\ni'm thankful that you do\nyeah i do\nyou know\ni may be easier to understand than you\nthink a few years from now because i\ndon't know that we're actually that\ndifferent\nyeah the way a lot of what i am is\nbecause i used to be in a very similar\nspace to where you are and i just kept\ndoing what you're doing i think you're\nactually doing a better job by the way\nbut you know oh thank you\nand and\nyou'll be surprised\nso best of luck to you ginkgo take care\nyeah thank you thank you bye adios\nokay\nwell that was fun\nright\nwow\ni love colin streams\nall right so i gotta run\ni'm late\nas i usually am so i think colin streams\ni'm learning you know it ends up being\nhalf an hour to 45 minutes per caller\nhuge shout out\nto everyone who called in today\num huge shout out\nfor everyone who's listening\nhuge shout out for\njust shout out for it all\nfor the community for the people for\nbeing alive for being human\nit ain't easy being human\nlike it ain't easy living life\nand sometimes we're a little bit busted\nthen we think to ourselves how am i\ngonna fix myself like it's so i'm so\nbroken\nso broken i can't do it myself here's\nthe wild thing you're right\nyou can't do it yourself\nbut you don't have to\nbecause there are other people here who\ngot your back\nright that's the wild thing somewhere\nalong the way we start believing\nthat we got to do it ourselves\nthat's the only way\nand it's not like that's a\nunfair belief\nbecause how does someone begin to\nbelieve that they're alone in life\nbecause they get treated as if they're\nalone\nthey get abandoned\nwhen they have needs and they're\nsuffering people aren't there for them\nand so you start to believe that because\nit's like that that's been your\nexperience which is fine\nbut here's the thing\nthe past does not necessarily predict\nthe future\nso if you've lost faith in humanity and\nhumanity hasn't been there for you\nthat's actually like a reasonable thing\nto believe\nand don't let it become your destiny\nbecause the only time that that becomes\ntrue for the rest of your life is when\nyou stop trying\nright when i say to myself there's no\none in the world for me so i'm gonna sit\nin these four walls\nand i'm never gonna leave the house and\ni'm never to interact with another human\nbeing\nthat's when it becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy\nbut if you get out\nand if you make an effort\nyou will find that maybe not right away\nmaybe not all the time there will be\npeople who will meet you halfway\nbecause we ain't gonna come breaking\ndown the door and dragging you out there\nthat's gonna be traumatic\nand we're too awkward ourselves we're\njust stumbling around outside in the\ncommon areas\nright we're not gonna intrude on your\nspace\nso you gotta you gotta open the door and\ntake the first step outside and people\nwill meet you halfway\nand that's what this community is about\nthat's what being human is about that's\nwhat the world needs right now\nright everyone's talking about\ncompromise and building bridges and\nthere's so much like\nantagonism we're so polarized\nand everyone's like we need compromise\nbut i ain't gonna move\nyou gotta be the one to move you gotta\nbe the one to start it\nand people will\nfollow you\nhow do i say that with confidence how\ncan i believe that because\nthis is where we are right now\ni took one step out the door i started\nstreaming\nbut like this wouldn't be a thing\nwithout y'all y'all were the ones that\nmet me halfway you carried me forward\neach and every person who's come on the\nstream carries us forward carries all of\nus forward that's what aoe healing is\npeople like ginkgo like\ni'm broke\nain't no fixing me\nturn around like inspiring people like\nwhat\nthis is what humans are capable of\nand the reason that we suffer the reason\nthat the world is going to is\nbecause we have forgotten this\nso be patient with yourselves and try\nbecause you have no idea what you're\ncapable of because what you believe\nyou're capable of is born of a lack of\neffort\nand so give it a shot\nand we'll meet you halfway\nlife is a multiplayer game"
