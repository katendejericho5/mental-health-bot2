    "transcript": "they are able actually to form social\nconnections romantic relationships be\nsuccessful at work so don't give up hope\nit just takes a little bit of work\nhey friend\nhi there\nuh what do you go by\nuh so my name is robert\nroger\nuh robert\nrobert robert\nyeah robert okay\nwelcome robert how are you\nyeah not bad thank you\nhow are your friendships going\nso my friendships\nhave been i'm talking the past tense i\ndon't really have any friendships at the\nmoment but my friendships\nhave\nalways felt codependent\nokay\nso i i don't know how do you i can\ni've got like\nmaybe five minutes worth of stuff that i\nwill sort of read out is that okay yeah\ni'd love that thank you so much for\npreparing\nokay um so\ni'm gonna start off by saying that i was\ndiagnosed as autistic\ni think when i was three\nokay\nand so when i was in school so secondary\nschool 11 to 16 i\nwasn't able to\nmask my symptoms as well so\npeople would make fun of me for being\nweird like i was instantly\nweird to people and so naturally because\nof this\ni sort of fell into like the nerd group\nof my school\nso i remember yeah\nand so i remember early on i had this\nquite an awkward encounter i think it\nwas with a girl\num i just said something dumb and my\nfriend like asked me you know why why am\ni so awkward\nfrom people and i told him about my\ndiagnosis\nand so\ni remember regretting that day quite a\nlot because as soon as i told him\ni gave him this like\nyou know i gave him this buzzword\nbasically\nand so from then on like all throughout\nschool\ni was that word was used to describe me\nlike constantly\num\nand so in in my group there were i would\nsay three people who are a lot smarter\nthan i was\nuh\nand i was one of the four that one very\nintelligent\ni was educationally quite mediocre so i\ncould never really join in on any\nintelligent discussion\nwhatsoever\nhowever the only reason i had any value\nin this group was because i could make\npeople laugh like that was like my place\nthat i held in the group\num\nand i found like i mean sometimes i i\ncould say things that were humorous but\nthere were times where i would say\nsomething\nor i would just do something i would say\nsomething outrageous or do something\noutrageous and\nyou know\npeople would laugh at me rather than\nwith me\ncommon\nyeah\nso um\nin fact i think it happened more than\npeople were laughing at me than with me\nno i think of it yeah so\ni realized that the only way i could get\na positive response out of my friends\nwas to just\nmake them like i i didn't have any place\nin this group other than my ability to\nmake them laugh\nand i would sort of uh like i knew that\nthey knew i was autistic so i would like\nuh i would play\nplay it up a little bit like there were\ntimes where i would be i would pretend\nto be completely oblivious to certain\nthings and\nin turn\nthat would sort of gain a reaction out\nof them like oh look at him he's the\nfunniest bad kid like you know\nhe does it he doesn't know you know yep\nand i sort of created like a almost a\ncharacter of myself rather than yeah\nlike displaying who i was\nand\noverall i'd say\ni had one other group of friends who i\nwould say more malicious\nif in fact it was mostly only one person\num\nthe other group i'm on good terms now\nwith like\nwe're okay\nbut um\nthere was another group of people that i\njoined through someone that i had known\nfrom when i was young\nit's like you know we were we grew up\ntogether\ni lived on the same lived on the same\nstreet and you know\nhis he knew about my diagnosis because\nhis mother had told him\njust for the sake of awareness and you\nknow when we were kids it's like you\nknow it's just childhood friends it\ndoesn't matter but i i remember we\nreconnected later on um\nlike sort of in our secondary school\nyears started playing cs go together\nand\nhe played cs go with his school friends\nand so he introduced me to them\nand the first time he introduced me to\nhis friendship group he introduced me as\noh this is the autistic guy that i was\ntelling you i was telling you about\nand uh he you know he didn't even\nintroduce me by name i had to say it\nmyself\nbut he you know he introduced me as this\nlabel right off the bat\num but i you know i i still managed to\ndo my usual thing i\nwas able to fit in with this group i was\nyou know\ni came in with my brand of loud and\nobnoxious humor and managed to get\nlaughs out of them so i like i knew that\ni was able to fit in\nat the very least\num and i remember the first time that i\nmet his friends in person\nthey were kind of like\ni don't know what it was but they were\nhesitant around me and i wondered why\nlike i was you know i just like\nintroduced myself\nbut they they sort of like\nthey were kind of like weirded out by me\nlike right off the bat and later on his\nfriend had told me that\num\nthis guy had said oh you know you need\nto watch out around him he's severely\nautistic and he might throw his arm out\nand accidentally hit you\num and he like it was sort of set as a\njoke like he was trying to build\nthis character of me basically um rather\nthan letting his friends meet me\nnormally\nand so\ni was always introduced\nas the autistic guy i was never robert\num\ni was always his autistic friend that's\nhow people refer to me as and you know i\ni was able to still like fit into a\ndegree but i was never really respected\nas a person i was just kind of this like\nsideshow freak on the you know sure that\nyeah that's how i felt\num and eventually it got to the point\nwhere\ni understood that i was sort of a\nlightning rod for all of the jokes\ndamn what a what a phrase dude\nthat's such a powerful phrase\ni i heard the phrase\nstop being autistic a lot like if i ever\nsaid something that was like against\nwhat they were saying that was what was\nthrown at me just by default\num\nif i ever tried to stand up for myself i\nwouldn't ever be taken seriously because\ni was just the funny guy that's all i\nwas\nand\nbecause this word was being used to\ndescribe me so much\nit became synonymous with my very\nexistence like i once i left school um\nand i entered college i really started\nlike colleges uh high school 16 to 18.\nuh\nand i really struggled to adjust like i\ncouldn't make any friends whatsoever\num like i felt really really awkward\naround people because i thought that i\njust like emanated autism like they\ncould just detect it\njust by standing near me and you know\nthat doesn't really make sense right but\nbecause i\ni've been caught like i'd become so\nattached to this word and i i felt like\ni never understood really what i was\nbeing made fun of for but i was being\nmade fun of for something so i thought\nyou know i don't\npeople can just see it but i can't\ndoes that make sense yeah absolutely\nokay\num\nand so yeah i didn't make any friends in\nmy last years of education\nand you know ever since i've just been\nlike i've been three years out of\neducation just working various different\njobs\num\nand i've sort of realized how it's\naffected me like in my working life\nbecause\nand just like my ability to make friends\nin general like that i've been around\nsome people in work who are like my age\nand i could have made friends with\nbut i didn't want to dis i didn't want\nto like\ndo the same thing as i did with all of\nmy other friends and like try to be\noutgoing\nand so i would you know i was i was\nalways worried that they could like\nanyone that talks to me can detect it\nlike they can they know\nlike they can pick up on like my\nawkwardness\num so i i basically tried to pretend to\nbe as normal as possible\nuh\nand and in turn i just it would it would\nmake me seem really\nboring really unemotional\nlike i wouldn't show any personality\nbasically\nbecause i was worried that if i do show\nany amount of personality\nthen\nit will be made fun of\nyeah absolutely man\nmy heart goes out to you\nuh i've only got a little bit left to\nread\num\nbut yeah i feel like every single\nlike i want to expand socially i want to\nactually learn what a good friendship\nfeels like\nbut\ni feel like this is going to get in the\nway because whenever i talk to people i\nhave this like feeling of\njust\ni feel like i can't be\nmyself at all like i have to put on\nyou know this completely normal\nappearance i can't\nyou know\nand i end up being yeah i've already\ngone over this sorry i'm\nyeah i'm worried that because i have\nthis anxiety of my\nautism being found out and people\nfinding out that there's something wrong\nwith me i try to be as normal as\npossible and in turn that makes me seem\nweird in itself yeah and i just don't\nknow artificial\nyeah rigid exactly\nyeah\nrobert you'd mention something about\ncodependence\nso\nnow i think of it\nyeah so i used that word because i was\nthe friendship group that i was talking\nabout\nthat i joined through my childhood\nfriend\nthey were like\nseen as sort of like popular kids\nbasically\nand for me\nbeing in this friendship group um\ni felt like i was finally not a nerd\nanymore\nbasically\nand so\nif i\nleft this group\ni'd have nothing i'd i'd have to be a\nnerd again yeah um so and it yeah it\nalways felt like they were above me\ni was i was below them\nand always i was always playing up to\nthem just to stay in\ngot it\num\ncan i just think for a second\nsure\nthank you very much for sharing things\nso concisely i think it's it's actually\nvery helpful and was also quite\num rich\nin terms of your experience and your\nbackground and your information so i'd\nlove to just process for a moment and\nand kind of formulate my thoughts\nokay\nyeah so robert\nis it okay if i if i try to respond in a\nmore\nuh\nalmost like you kind of gave me five\nminutes is it okay if i kind of try to\ndo the same back to you and then we can\nmaybe dig in a little bit more\nyeah that's fine\nso i you know first of all\nmy heart really goes out to you i i\nthink you've been\nthe unhappy recipient of so much of the\nstruggle that we see\nwith people who are on the\nspectrum so the first thing is that\nthere's just a lack of awareness about\nwhat autism is\nand\nand so\nyou know like even for example like your\nfriend's mom that told him that you were\non the autism spectrum that's not\nnecessarily a bad thing like i think\nhaving awareness of people's\nneurodevelopment i mean neurodivergent\num you know differences can actually be\nlike a really important piece of\ninformation\nin helping us\nform appropriate relationships does that\nmake sense\nyeah so it's not like we want to hide it\nlike we want people to be kind of aware\nbut\ni think the downside is that\nwhen we start to tell people sometimes\nwhat happens is the autism starts to be\nour defining characteristic\nyeah and once it starts to become the\ndefining characteristic i've seen this\nin a way that i recently that i really\nhadn't seen\neven five years ago\nwhere sometimes groups of people right\nbecause we're being like more accepting\nof people with autism and it's\nneurodevelopmental and it's like you\nknow it's a little neurodivergent and so\nlike i've almost seen people who will\nhave like a token autistic friend\nso like groups of people will have like\na friend and it's like oh we're cool and\nwe're accepting because we've got\none i'm friends with someone with autism\nso that means that i'm a cool person and\ni'm like accepting of people and i'm\nwoke and all this kind of stuff\nbut even then in that moment they they\ndon't have a friend with autism\nthey have an autistic friend\nand this is where sometimes like\nyou know i mean i think you shared that\nbeautifully when you kind of said like\nyou got introduced as oh here's the\nautist i found\nyou know and they didn't they didn't\neven like introduce your name\nand that's where like what's sort of\nstarting to happen is people are\nstarting starting to be defined by their\nautism instead of\nautism being a part of who they are\nand this can get like even worse because\nas you sort of get defined by this one\nthing\nyou're left with a very interesting\nsocial challenge\nwhich is like this is like these people\nare my friend because like oh like i'm\nautistic\nand then what happens is like you're\ntrying to figure out okay how do i\nrelate to these people because they're\njudging me in this way\nand what a lot of people with autism\nwill end up doing we'll also see this\nwith other uh neurodivergent kind of\nconditions like adhd is very very common\nwhere you become the clown\nright because that's how you get your\nsocial status you may not be as\nintelligent as them i'm not entirely\nsure i agree with that by the way but\nyou know if you say that we'll accept\nthat for now\nbut you kind of like you turn into kind\nof this one trick pony where like oh\nlike let's all laugh at the autistic kid\nbecause at least they're kind of\nlaughing right they invite you\nlike you're invited\nbut you're kind of the butt of jokes\nand then you're kind of stuck because\nyou're in the situation where\neven if you try to say something or do\nsomething or\nexhibit frustration with your\nquote-unquote friends\nthey attribute oh they're like that's\njust his autism acting out like oh we\ndon't have to take his like concerns\nseriously we don't have to take his his\nfeelings seriously we don't have to take\nhis criticisms seriously that's just the\nautism it's just the autism\nyeah and so it's a very\ntoxic dynamic\nwhere\nyou have to like continue paying this\nprice of being the butt of jokes in\norder to get some degree of social\nacceptance\nand then as you lobby to actually be a\npart of the group instead of fitting in\nlike they don't want that right because\nthey treat you\nyour entire relationship with them is\ndefined by the autism\nand so like we feel kind of stuck by\nthis bullying it's essentially bullying\nand so then what happens i've seen this\na lot where people will like learn from\nthat right and they're like okay well\nhere's the way i've learned how to make\nfriends which is that like people are\naware of my autism it's sort of like\ndemeaning in some ways but it also is\nlike sort of an excuse and if i kind of\nscrew up or people get mad at me like\nthey're still gonna invite me next time\nbecause i'm autistic\nyou know so it does have some advantages\ni can poke fun at myself that's what i\nbring to people that's my fundamental\nvalue and i'm gonna so i'm gonna engage\nin self-deprecating humor which is gonna\nencourage disrespect and we're going to\nlike\nkeep that going because that's how i\nconnect with people\nand over time what happens is people\nrealize like oh this is actually kind of\ntoxic i don't like this\nand then you become ashamed of the\nautism\nbecause people have been treating you so\npoorly because you're autistic\nand then you try to suppress parts of\nyourself whereas like i don't think that\nyou're funny just because you're\nautistic it sounds to me like one of\nyour best qualities is that you're\nactually like really genuinely funny\nand and so then what happens is we try\nto hide our autism and we suppress\nthose humorous parts of ourself you end\nup coming across as kind of like flat\nyes\nright and then like people don't\nyou don't it's like the thing that you\nare the most valuable thing that you can\noffer to another human being is\nsomething that you've taken off the\ntable because at the beginning you used\nhumor as a compensation for other\npotential deficiencies or autism or\nwhatever and then you realize like in\nyour mind those two things have come\ntogether\nlike you can't be funny without being\nautistic almost and then as you take a\nhumor off the table because you're\ntaking autism off the table then like\nhow do you connect with people and then\nyou kind of become rigid you kind of\nbecome flat you kind of become\ninauthentic and then it's hard to\nconnect with people when you're just\nkind of like\nneutral\nyeah\nit's like\ni gotta say\nit it's really hard to be in this\nsituation and this is a situation that i\nhear about\nso much from people who are on the\nspectrum\num does that resonate with you\nthat it's\nyou know yeah a hundred percent i mean\nevery single thing\ndefinitely yeah so so and this is what\nstuff i\ni i don't know that i have an easy\nanswer for you because i i think it's\nlike\nit's a problem we're seeing that's like\nmore and more\nyou know\nchallenging it's happening more and more\nso let me start with a couple of\nquestions is that okay yeah that's fine\nso the first is how do you feel about\nbeing autistic\nuh i'm just gonna\nthink for a second\ni feel like it's an unnecessary\nhindrance for my communication\nit's that i don't like there's a lot of\nuh\nthere's this stereotype of an autistic\nperson where they're sort of like gifted\nin some sort of way like oh you know\nrain man if you've ever watched that\nmovie or you can count cards whatever\ni'm not i'm not like good at maths i'm\nnot good at coding i'm not really\nparticularly good at anything\ni just have the social downsides that's\nhow i personally feel about it\nyeah so i think that's a really good um\nthat's a really good description because\nsometimes in the game of life we almost\nthink about it like i don't know if you\nplay d d or like\nrpgs\nbut not really okay so like sometimes we\nhave like this character creation\nkind of perspective where it's like if i\nget a negative trait\ni get some kind of bonus point somewhere\nelse\nand then it all evens out in the end\nlike i can min max\nby having a really low stat over here\nbut then i'm super high over here and\nunfortunately sometimes that's not how\nlife works\nright sometimes things are just like\nnegative like there's no there's no like\nupside to trauma like\nright there you know that it\nso so that's challenging so how do you\nfeel about\nso you you kind of don't feel like you\nhave any kind of advantages you're not\nan autistic savant\nand so but how do you feel about like\nwhat is how do you feel about that\nlike not having an advantage and just\nhaving a straight disadvantage\ni can't really\nit's bad\ni can't really elaborate on it anymore\nlike you know there's there's no upside\nto it yeah so do you find yourself\nwishing that you weren't autistic\nall the time\nand are you ashamed of being autistic\num\ni will i will say not so much anymore\nlike i've been working a lot on\ndealing with that shame and i'm not\nreally ashamed of it anymore i i the way\ni see it now is i could do without it\nand it probably would have made my life\nplay out a little it would have made my\nlife easier at that stage of my life but\ni'm not ashamed of it necessarily like\ni've sort of worked on that\nso i'm really happy to hear that i think\nthat's going to be very important for\ngoing forward\nand um so\nwhat makes it hard for you to form\nconnections with people now\num i would say\nthis is slowly improving but\ni would say for the past three years the\nonly people have already interacted with\npeople at work it's the\nthe difficulties of like\nthere's something so awkward about\nsmall talk and just regular\npassing interactions with people and\nthat there's a lot of that that happens\nat work you need to say good morning\nlike how are you i'm fine how are you\nyou need to ask them the same question\nand then they say the same thing back to\nyou\num and it like the the in authenticity\nof all of these interactions\ni always feel like disgusting after i\nengage in any of like i can't do small\ntalk\nthat's just like one of them\nuh what do you the question was\nwhat do you think stops me from building\nconnections with people right yeah and\nif it's like\ni don't like small talk that's a\ncompletely valid answer\nyeah okay\nand the other one\na big part is like eye contact um i can\nonly really make eye contact for like\ntwo seconds at a time before i have to\nlook away because obviously like\nyou know you look like you know people\nnormal people look at each other\nand so over time i've learned that i\nhave to kind of do that\neven though it is difficult so i'll look\nat people\nin the eyes for like two seconds and\nthen i have to look away because it\ncomes it becomes too uncomfortable\nand what this means is that people\nsort of naturally get an impression of\nme that i'm not really on the same page\nas they are like i'm you know i'm not\nlistening to them or i'm not interested\nin what they're saying so i i think i\nactually give across like an arrogant\nvibe like if people don't know they just\nassume that i'm rude\nand and do you\ndo how do you feel about telling people\nthat you're on the spectrum\ni i don't\ni wouldn't ever do it unless it was the\nonly person\ni've only\ntold\ni'm not going to count all the people\nthat i've told uh\nit would make me uncomfortable\nto tell someone unless it was necessary\nlike a manager for instance uh\ni do like i told my manager at my\ncurrent job\nuh that i'm autistic and i if i'm not\nmaking eye contact as much\nit\nit feels good to sort of get that weight\noff my shoulders that i don't feel like\ni have to\npretend\nlike they understand that i've got this\nthing that might make me seem slightly\nblunt or standoffish at times\nand i've sort of got a reason for it so\ni think the the fear of telling someone\ncan be quite strong because i worry\nabout maybe like oh will they think that\ni'm incompetent will they fire me\nbut i think once i\nyou know the most recent case telling my\nmanager once i told him\num i feel like people at work started to\nlike when i when i used to come to work\ni would just like come in not say a word\nand i would go home but\nnow that people sort of understand\nthey're okay with that and i'm actually\ni actually feel more like a lot more\ncomfortable in my workplace\nand so i feel like i i have actually\nstarted talking more to my co-workers\nnow so it i know the positive effects\nthat telling people can have it's just\ngetting over that initial hurdle of\ntelling them\nthat that scares me\nyeah\nso um\nrobert i actually feel like i've got\nsome\ni want to share some more stuff with you\ni is it\ni feel like you actually did such a\nbeautiful job with your initial kind of\nfive minutes that i i don't feel like i\nneed to ask you a bunch of questions\nis it okay if i share some thoughts with\nyou or did were you hoping that i would\nask you more questions\nno you can share your thoughts it's fine\nso\nso here's\nso i'm optimistic for you first of all\nso i think just talking to you now i\nthink you have a lot to offer people um\nand you know i don't know if hopefully\nyou're not watching twitch chat or\nanything like that but oh no definitely\nnot good um and also i i think that like\nwhat what i'm you know overwhelmingly\nseeing is that people think you're a\ncool person and you know you're worthy\nof hanging out with and have friendship\nand all this kind of stuff right\nso so like i i'm not i'm not hearing an\novert rejection from people on twitch\nwhich i think is great\nso yeah so i think part of what you're\ndealing with is the fear that you have\nis primarily because you are it sounds\nlike in two primary situations\nalso with people who are like kids for\nthe most part right\nand so kids are not going to be the most\nempathic in fact kids are some of the\nnastiest people on the planet when it\ncomes to treating other like treating\npeople with compassion like kids can be\nsome of the most cruel human beings\non like in the world\nand and so i think a lot of your fear\nactually is reasonable right because\nyou've had this experience where people\nhave defined you by autism have treated\nyou a particular way because of that\nautism some of that was also like played\ninto by you\nbecause that was your adaptation to get\nacceptance\nright yeah and so going forward i i\nalmost think that you're\nyou know what i would what what i've\nactually seen works and i'm\nis first of all developing a healthy\nunderstanding\nand relationship with your own\nuh autism\nand what and i think you're actually\nlike really far there so in in the past\nwhen i've done you know therapy with\npeople who have autism we try to get to\nkind of where you are which is that i'm\nnot ashamed of it and it sucks\nlike i wish i didn't have it and it's\nit's okay to authentically wish i wasn't\nautistic\nand also like it's just part of who i am\nand i don't need to be ashamed of it\nlike you're completely valid with all of\nthose thoughts\nthe other thing that i'd kind of say is\nthere there is some we talked about the\ndownsides of increasing autism awareness\nwhich is that sometimes you'll have\nsocial groups that want a token autistic\nfriend\nbut the upside is that there are a lot\nof people out there who are more aware\nthat you know autism is more common than\nwe originally thought it's a spectrum\num and that will be actually like more\nunderstanding of your situation and and\ntry to understand you better and will\nlike\nrecognize that if you're not making eye\ncontact if you struggle with small talk\nthey won't attribute that to other\nthings kind of unfairly right like\nyou're kind of like you're uninterested\nor\nyou know you're arrogant or whatever\nlike you've kind of said\nso oddly enough in your case i would\nactually say just like keep trying to\nconnect with people and also you don't\nwant to lead necessarily with hi my name\nis robert i'm on the spectrum but also\nlike i i wouldn't\nyou know if you feel like especially\nwith small talk i think you can kind of\nlike share that tidbit a little bit\nearlier\nand i wouldn't be surprised i'm so happy\nto hear about kind of your situation at\nwork because what i've actually found is\nthat\nyou know if you kind of put that out\nthere and you kind of put yourself out\nthere and i would include like\nactivating your humor too\nthat if you try that with five or six\ndifferent groups of people it'll land\nreally well with like 50 of them\nand i think to a certain degree it's\nkind of a numbers game because as people\nare more\nyou know compassionate towards people\nwho are neurodivergent\nthat actually like opens a lot of doors\nand also that like if you if they kind\nof understand that oh the reason that\nyou're not making eye contact isn't\nbecause you dislike me it's maybe a\nmanifestation of being on the autism\nspectrum\nlike\nthat will allow relationships to foster\nand hopefully you'll actually find\nsituations more like you did at work i'm\nactually really hopeful because you've\nat least had a couple\nright\nand so oddly enough i think forming\nrelationships with you is really sort of\nlike acknowledging that fear\nacknowledging where that fear comes from\nand also not letting the fear control\nyou and kind of taking a chance\nbeing a little bit funny\nand\nyou know also like not hiding the fact i\nwouldn't advertise it but also not being\nashamed of and not hiding the fact that\nyou're on the spectrum how does that\nsound to you\nyeah i think you know i don't want to be\nsomeone who makes it i don't want to\nsort of like wear autism as a badge and\nsort of like show it around and\nbut at the same time i think yeah when\nwhen necessary when it makes sense to\ntell people\nthat i will and i think i'm a lot more\ncomfortable with doing that now\nyeah i i'm actually just talking to you\nand having this interaction makes me\nlike quite optimistic that\nyou know it's going to be a little bit\nof a bumpy road and i think you're\nprobably looking at some amount of\nrejection\nbut also that rejection\nis not something that i think is like\nthis is the hard thing is sometimes it's\nhard to acknowledge that if a group\nrejects us it's not like we're\npersonally deficient\nright yeah\nand even then it may not be like a\nstraight rejection it's just like\nyou know if you have hey like you want\nto hang out sometime yeah sure i'd love\nto and then nothing ever happens doesn't\nmean that i don't like you it just means\nthat maybe i'm busy or maybe i'm\nstruggling with my own depression or you\nknow like there's a lot of family drama\ngoing on or things like that and i think\nthat's where it's like it's just\nimportant to remember that to a certain\ndegree it's like kind of a numbers game\nthat if you reach out and and try to\nconnect with five different groups of\npeople you know two to three of them\nwill probably like not land but all you\nreally need is like one or two and then\ni think you're you've really come a long\nway and i'm optimistic that if you just\nkeep on trying you'll actually do really\nwell\nyeah\nhow does that sound\ni i mean the the rejection part like\nobviously i'm\ni have quite a negative relationship\nwell i think everyone does no one nobody\nwants to be rejected um\nbut yeah getting getting over that\nsort of oh everyone hates me if these\npeople hate me\nthat will that will be the most\ndifficult part um\nbut yeah yeah i mean so i like i said\nit's going to be a bumpy road i think\nthis is the kind of thing we're actually\nlike seeing a therapist could also help\nyou with that kind of stuff\ninsurance i am currently seeing a\ntherapist oh that's fantastic so i i\nwould i would take that you know those\nrejections i would take them to therapy\nand kind of vent them there\num i'm not surprised at all to hear that\nyou're seeing a therapist because it\nsounds like you've really come a long\nway and and you're\nyou know\ndoing really well\nthe one thing that i would remember is\nthat sometimes this can be a feature of\nuh being on the spectrum but it is not\nexclusive to being on the spectrum so a\nlot of neurotypical people will do this\nlike you know that rejection is\nsometimes a manifestation of black and\nwhite thinking\nyeah and and just be aware of that right\nso black and white thinking is not\nspecific to autism spectrum but\ni tend to see it happen more in in\npeople with autism\num and so some of the stuff like oh the\nonly thing i bring to the table\nis self-deprecating humor that kind of\nblack and white thinking i would start\nto really become aware of and question a\nlittle bit because i think you bring a\nlot i'm just talking to you now like i\nfeel like i would have no trouble\nhanging out with you for like two or\nthree hours and just\nyou know and you haven't cracked any\njokes like you're insightful you're\nthoughtful\nyou know you're organized with your\nspeech\nyou're self-aware\nlike you bring a lot to the table\nyeah but like in you know with the way\nthat i'm interacting with you currently\nit's very um\nit's very formal like i'm not\ninteracting with you in a like a bubbly\nenergetic way\ni i you know i'm just i'm just saying\nwords that's all i'm doing and i want to\nget past that like exterior that i've\nbuilt for myself\nand\nyou know you mean it robert you mean\nit's get it gets better than this\ni mean\ni don't know i i feel like this is just\nvery i feel like you're you make you\nfeel like you're i feel like you might\nfeel like you're talking to a robot\nright now because of the sort of\ni i don't feel like i'm talking to a\nrobot\nwell that's how i always feel when i\ntalk to people because i\ni feel like because i i don't i'm not\nemotive and i'm not\nenergetic like other people are they\nthey get the impression that i'm like\nand yeah i don't know\nso i'll just take what you said like\nyeah so so like like it's important to\nacknowledge that right like but yeah\nthat that's the whole point is that a\nlot of you forming friendships\nis going to be\nnot\nnegotiating against yourself\ncould you elaborate yeah so like like\nyou know you\nyou're\nyou're pre-rejecting yourself\nyou're not even giving me the chance to\naccept or reject you you're assuming\nthat i think i'm talking to a robot\nyeah\ni i i didn't feel that way at all\nyeah i was the only one who said it so\nyeah like\nyou don't seem like a robot to me\nit's great to hear that's why honestly\nmy reaction when you told me like i'm\nnot being bubbly and energetic is like\nthis is great you're telling me it gets\nbetter than this like that sounds\nawesome\nyou know and that that's what i think\ni'm hearing from you robert is that\nyou're not showcasing your best self i\nthink the big difference is that even\nyour best self is actually completely\nacceptable i mean even\nnot being your best self\nis completely acceptable and sounds\nfantastic\ni just feel like i'm talking to a normal\nopen\nthoughtful person that's what i get from\nthis conversation\nokay\ni don't think i've ever been told that\nbefore i think but it's good to hear\nthat outside perspective i don't i'm not\ngetting any sense that you're funny but\ni i would i would say the the word that\ncomes to mind the most is that you're\nthoughtful\nyeah\nand if it gets better than that it's\nlike\nlike give me the dlc bro\nyou know like don't don't don't pay wall\nthe humor\ni appreciate that thank you\nany questions\num\ni i would like to think\nsure just for a second so\nokay\ni think a big one for me is is eye\ncontact\nand like how much of it is\nis it something that can be\nworked on\nlike can i learn to make more eye\ncontact\nuh this is where the answer is gonna be\nkind of strange the answer is gonna be\nyes and no\nso if you look at\nyou know i'm not an expert on autism in\nterms of my clinical practice but\ni think that they're so if you look at\nlike evidence-based psychotherapies and\nwhat's effective for people who are on\nthe spectrum\nthere is a certain amount of like social\nskills training\nthat can improve\nyour ability to like relate to other\npeople\nyeah and\nyou can sort of socially train it but it\nmay never be at the level of like\nnatural eye contact\nif your brain was a little bit different\nokay so\ni hopefully i mean i love it if someone\nproved me wrong but you know what we\nunderstand about people who are\nneurodivergent is that their brains are\na little bit different you can\ncompensate for a lot of it\nwhat i will tell you is that at some\npoint it becomes completely irrelevant\nso like you may have difficulty with eye\ncontact or it may feel a little bit\nartificial it's kind of hard this has\nbeen my experience working with people\non the spectrum is that it's hard to\nlike find a natural level right so you\nlearn how to make more eye contact but\nthen you can feel like you're staring a\nlittle bit too much and that can make\npeople so some people uncomfortable and\nthe truth of the matter is that for some\npeople that i've worked with they never\nget to the neurotypical level and\nit's actually kind of irrelevant because\nit feels awkward for the first hour that\nyou're with people but i i've worked\nwith a ton of people who never master\neye contact who are still able to live\ncompletely fulfilling social and\nromantic lives\nbecause at some point like a lot of that\neye contact is actually with the initial\nsocial interaction\nand i don't know how to say this but you\nknow i'm assuming that you've got\nrelationships with your family but like\ndo you have eye contact problems with\nyour family\num\nit's not as bad it's not as bad but that\nthat like i can't\nlook there's still that thing where i\ncan't look for too long\nyeah it just gets uncomfortable right so\nlike you may continue to have it my\npoint is that it may not impact the\nrelationship\nyeah does that make sense\nyeah i mean i have been told that eye\ncontact is huge when it comes to\nconnecting with people\nyeah but i think it's it's more\nimportant early on\nright and and what i've seen is that\npeople like conform relationships and\nthen then it's totally fine like if you\ngo to movies like if you go to the\nmovies with a couple of friends you're\nnot no one's making eye contact anyway\nso it's not really an issue\nand if you go to a meal you know it's\nnot like everyone's staring at each\nother for extended periods of time\nand so it's okay like if you go on a\nhike with someone for example\nlike you're going to be walking side by\nside you're not even going to be looking\nat each other\nso as you develop relationships with\npeople i think eye contact becomes\nless of a hindrance in terms of the\nrelationship\nokay\nbut i i i'm you know but i i have worked\nwith people who continue to struggle\nwith it and and never really master it\nfully\nwhich is unfortunate but also doesn't\ndetermine your future\nyeah\nand uh\nam i good to ask one more question sure\nso\ni have worked in places in the past\nwhere\ni feel like due to\nyou know not being\nso you know very\ndue to being autistic and well people\naren't ever really aware that i'm\nautistic they just think that i'm off or\nrude as i've said before and i'm worried\nas to how\nuh what am i trying to say like how much\nimportant like\nis it common for autistic people to be\nfired from their job because of uh\nthings that they give off to people\nhmm that's such a good question um\ni actually don't so i imagine that\nthere's probably research\nabout that\nbut i don't know the statistics\num\ni i i don't know is the short answer\nokay\nuh\nuh what let me think about how i can try\nto offer something a little bit more\nsubstantive so i would find it hard to\nbelieve\nthat\ni would imagine that being on the\nspectrum makes social interactions at\nwork\na little bit more challenging\nand i would also expect that challenging\nsocial interactions at work\ndon't correlate well with employment and\nthings like that\nyeah\nbut and i'm not using an end here i'm\nreally using a butt\nthere are lots of other people and lots\nof other conditions that lead to\nproblematic social interactions that\nhave nothing to do with autism right\nlike so people can be\nnarcissistic they can be\npassive-aggressive\nand the other thing that i'd say is that\ni know a ton of people who are very\nsuccessfully employed who are are on the\nspectrum\nokay and\nyou know like so so\ni i think it's\nit may be a disadvantage of some kind\nbut i i think it's far from destiny\nand i think it's all so far from like\ninsurmountable\nyeah\nit's just a case of finding the right\ncompany yeah something like more of an\nissue somewhere yeah so like also\nvocalizing to people when you're ready\nthat you are on the spectrum and that it\naffects things in a particular way but\nlike\nyou know\nyou know sharing with your boss that hey\ni'm on the spectrum these are the things\nthat i struggle with but like you know\nanytime i'm open to feedback i'm a very\nhard worker and here are the ways that i\ntry to compensate\num you know if this ever becomes a\nproblem please let me know and i'm happy\nto work on it like\neven vocalizing things like that can\nactually set you above your peers\nbecause\na lot of neurotypical people will never\nsay stuff like that and they'll be\noblivious to feedback and take things\npersonally and things like that\nyeah\nso\nyou know if you feel like autism is a\ndisadvantage i'm not going to disagree\nwith you you're the one who lives your\nlife and at the same time i don't think\nthat it dooms you to anything and\nthe person that i feel like i'm talking\nto who's this thoughtful and proactive\nabout their life i'm optimistic that you\ncan have\na good job good career and you can form\nsolid human connections\nokay that's great to hear thank you yeah\ni think you've put in a lot of work\nrobert and i think it shows\nokay i mean is is there anything else so\nnot from my end\nall right brilliant thank you very much\nthank you\ngreat thanks for sharing and thanks for\ncalling in\nall right thank you take care\noh inferno pizza wants to be his friend\nreal bad yeah so i think you know\ni just want to kind of\nrecap this for a second so sometimes\nwe're becoming more aware that people\nare on the autism spectrum so a couple\nof things to remember the first is that\nthe autism spectrum is a spectrum\nand so there's\nyou know\nyou can't\ndefine the destinies\nof people on the autism spectrum in one\nparticular way because different people\nhave different advantages disadvantages\netc\ni think unfortunately what we're\nstarting to see is that as\non the one hand it's good that there's\nmore autism awareness\nright so people like robert have\nis in a workplace where he explained\nthis to his boss boss was very\nunderstanding um you know so it sounds\nlike he's feeling more comfortable at\nwork so i think it's totally fine to\nshare with people if you are on the\nspectrum a weird thing that i'm starting\nto see though is that sometimes it\nstarts to define you in a social group\nwhich can actually be quite\ntoxic\nwhere everything that you do is because\nyou're autistic right it's like we don't\nsometimes allow people with autism to\nhave normal variation\nand and just because i'm mad at you\ndoesn't mean that like i'm autistic and\nand can't regulate my emotions it's\npossible the reason that i'm mad at you\nis because you're actually treating me\ninappropriately and with\ndisrespect so sometimes we'll see a lot\nof invalidation towards people on the\nspectrum and sometimes we'll also see a\nweird kind of toxic thing which is like\nthe token autistic friend in a friend\ngroup which as robert said can sometimes\nmake you a lightning rod for jokes\nand so the challenge is if you grow up\non the spectrum and it doesn't\nnecessarily be i have to be on the\nautism spectrum i've seen this with\nother things like adhd as well\nwhere you sort of learn that humor and\nself-deprecating humor is the way is the\nway that you get admission to a friend\ngroup\nbut if that's what starts to happen like\nyou know you're paying\na poor admission price and you're not\ntruly being accepted\nso if you're if you're struggling to\nform connections i think a lot of it is\nactually disentangling\nsome of the dis self-deprecating humor\nand things like that like sort of trying\nto find a nice balance with\naccepting that you are autistic\naccepting that there may not be a\nparticular advantage if you know not to\nsay that it's all bad right so people\nwith autism are allowed\nto\nsay this is not a disadvantage they're\nallowed to say this is a disadvantage\nlike that depends on the individual we\ndon't get to decide that for people with\nautism you have to develop your own\nrelationship and comfort and acceptance\nwith your neurodivergence\nand once you do that hopefully you're\nnot ashamed of it right so i think\novercoming that shame is really\nimportant and then as you start to form\nconnections with people thankfully there\nis more awareness\nand sometimes you have to let people\nknow that you're on the spectrum to help\nthem understand why you may not be doing\nsome things that neurotypical people do\nbut in my experience people who sort of\ntake this approach and and overcome some\nof their fears and don't like slip into\nautomatic self-deprecating humor because\nthat attracts for a particular kind of\nperson they are able actually to form\nsocial connections romantic\nrelationships be successful at work so\ndon't give up hope it just takes a\nlittle bit of work"
