    "transcript": "about a week ago i stubbed my toe\nagainst a table leg and boy did i get\npissed off\ndamn that table leg then i kicked the\ntable leg for doing this to me and then\ni hurt more and then i felt more angry\nthe despair of anger\nhi i've heavily\ni've heavily suppressed emotions\nthroughout life with video games or\nsimply by refusing to acknowledge the\nemotion\nslash pressing the mute button on it and\ni've started doing a lot of work to\nidentify and feel my emotions\ngood job friend\ni'm getting to a point where i'm\ncomfortable with most emotions also good\njob friend and feeling them reliably but\ni have a complicated relationship with\nanger you and everyone else\ni come from a home where anger was the\ntyrant that made everyone miserable and\ni witnessed the effects it had on my\nmother and sister which made me promise\nmyself never to feel angry\nas you might guess because our emotions\nare a mute all\nthat wasn't a viable strategy and it led\nto a lot of pain for me\nthat pain continues with my relationship\nto anger today\ni'm comfortable with the idea that i\nneed anger is a healthy part of my life\ni want to know more about it and how to\neffectively handle it when it comes up\nbut because of a lifetime of denying it\ni'm always at a loss how to become\ncomfortable with it\ni sometimes still reflexively try to\nsuppress it or deny it and when i do\nfeel it and allow myself to feel it it's\nfollowed by guilt and intense\nself-judgment\nthis relationship with anger is making\nme feel broken and helpless in regards\nto the feeling\nfeeling like i'll be able to use it as a\nhealthy tool it's supposed to be and\nthat only adds more stress on top of the\nnegative feelings i'm already\nexperiencing do y'all have any guidance\non this kind words or thoughts are also\nwelcome thank you for your time\nfantastic post\nso the thing about anger is that it's\ndifferent\nit's different from the other emotions\nwe can come to accept things like\nsadness like getting in touch with your\nsadness is a good thing\nyou know a parent who is sad is\ndeserving of sympathy\nwe understand oh my my mom is mom or dad\nis very anxious about me it's because\nthey love me\nright that's the way they worry about me\nthey worry because they love\nso if we look at all of our negative\nemotions a lot of them are acceptable\nexcept for anger\na sad parent\nsympathy a worried parent oh we\nunderstand that's because you love your\nchild an angry parent how dare you\nand like this person\nwe see why anger is demonized\nright because anger makes people\nmiserable\nwe blame people for for being angry\nand so this becomes a challenge because\nthen like how do we develop a\nrelationship with anger we can\nunderstand developing a relationship\nwith anxiety overcoming anxiety it's\nunderstandable that i'm anxious it's\nunderstandable that i'm sad when i turn\nto my friends and i say i'm having a\nrough day i'm super sad today i lost\nsomeone that i love i'm sad and the\nworld is like oh like let me give you a\nhug\nbut if i'm angry\nhow does that what effect does that have\non people around me\nand if you grow up in a household where\nyou saw the danger of anger\nwhat happens is anger gets demonized\nright because anger is a dangerous\nemotion it's a bad emotion like oh sure\nlike we can get in touch with our\nsadness oh my god like let's watch a sad\nmovie and like all cry together and bond\noh my god like i'm gonna have so much\ncompassion and empathy for the sadness\nof the world and the starving children\nand the refugees and like oh my god it's\nso sad it makes me so sad everyone give\nme sympathy and empathy oh my god\nand if i'm having a trauma response\nbecause i've been traumatized in the\npast and i'm afraid of something that's\nnot my fault i deserve compassion and\nlove\ni'm afraid of this because i've been\ntraumatized and as i share that i\nreceive lots of support\nbut not anger\nright\nand anger is kind of interesting because\nwe also see\nthis kind of i'm opening a little bit of\na can of worms here\nbut we also see in gender dynamics that\nanger is the one unacceptable\nemotion for everyone for both genders\nthis is kind of interesting\nbecause if someone is at work and\nthey're a woman and they're angry they\nget called the b word or the c word it's\nnot acceptable\ncan is a woman allowed to be afraid sure\nis a woman allowed to be sad sure\nbut is a woman allowed to be angry no no\nright it's used as an attack also true\nfor men i recently saw an article i\ndidn't look at it was clickbait about\nthis guy andrew tate which i keep on\nhearing about still not sure who he is\nand now he's mobilizing angry men not\nmobilizing sad men\nnot mobilizing\nfearful men or anxious men angry men\nright\ni'm not trying to get into that but i'm\njust pointing out that like what's the\nword that we use\nangry men or evil men\nright anger is the unacceptable emotion\ni'm not commenting on whether he is or i\ndon't really even know who he is or\nanything like that i'm just saying like\ni saw this article and i've observed\nthat when we're even we're trying to\nbash both genders if we toss the word\nanger in there it's unacceptable\nright it's kind of interesting so that's\nwhat makes it universal it's not\nactually gender specific\nso we demonize anger because anger is\nthe opposite of compassion compassion is\nlike a good thing right we sort of like\nput those two all like kindness are\nangry\nkindness are angry so what happens it's\nreally tricky because how do we develop\na healthy relationship with this thing\nbecause anger isn't like the other\nemotions\neven freud sort of talked he has a lot\nof really interesting stuff to say about\nanger and one of i think this is his\ntheory that depression is anger turned\nagainst the self\nso when i'm very depressed and i'm like\noh i'm terrible i'm not a good person\npeople deserve better\nyou know people would be happier if i\ndidn't exist all these kinds of thoughts\nthat's all hatred against the self\nand so oftentimes what i've seen as a\nclinician\nis when people are depressed what it\nactually is is anger at its root\nfreud was really brilliant with that\nobservation\nso when we don't deal with our anger it\nmanifests in all kinds of weird ways it\ncan sometimes manifest as depression\nit can sometimes manifest as explosions\nright which once again then we blame\nourselves because we explode at someone\nbecause we feel too much anger we've\nbeen suppressing it it's not really\nworking out\nexplosion\nand then we blame ourselves oh my god i\ngot angry again i lost control of the\nanger do we blame people for breaking\nout crying no\ndo we blame people for having a panic\nattack some people do and that's\ndevastating how dare you have a panic\nattack\nwe may perceive some things around those\nnegative emotions like shame or weakness\nright that's fair but\nnone of our emotions get vilified the\nway that anger does\nso how does one start to develop a\nhealthy relationship with anger\ni'm going to give you all one really\nsimple answer works really really well\ni've used it a ton\nso let's start from the top\nthe first thing is to acknowledge that\nanger is different\ndifferent for a lot of different reasons\nsocietally\nwe're taught now as we become more in\ntouch with ourselves emotionally as we\nstart to accept that crying is okay for\nboth men and women\nas we start to accept that anxiety is a\nproblem people suffer from panic attacks\npeople suffer from trauma we have a lot\nmore compassion towards those emotions\nwe don't have compassion towards anger\nblame\nwe blame people for being angry and\nfurthermore a lot of times the reason\nthat we blame people is because we see\nthe damage that anger causes\nother emotions cause damage too\ni once worked with someone\nhe's going to be somewhat of a\nchimerical person\nwho fell in love\nand fell in love with someone who wanted\nto have a child\nand they thought when two people are in\nlove\nnicest thing that you can do if someone\nwants a child is to bring a child into\nthis world\na child that is born of love between two\npeople\njust turns out the two people weren't\nmarried and that they were married to\nother people\nbut it was love and love conquers all\nand love is a good emotion\ngiving into love and like bringing a\nchild in this world is a start as a\nsource of love it's a wonderful thing\nexcept one of them had kids with someone\nelse and was married\nright but we don't think about love as a\nbad emotional like love is great like\nlove conquers all love conquers even\nyour prior marriages and love conquers\nlike the responsibilities that you have\ntowards your existing children love\nconquers all\nbut societally we don't look at that\nright like you look at all of your\nmovies\nand love is a force for good and the\nvillain is angry\nanger is always a part of the villain so\nwe vilify anger so understand this\nwithin yourself\nnow how do you develop a healthy\nrelationship with anger it's one really\nsimple thing you can do\nstart by understanding that all emotions\nexist for a reason\nso if you can't forgive yourself for\nbeing angry because that's what a lot of\npeople will try to do at the very\nbeginning if you can't be compassionate\nunderstand that emotions are information\nfirst and foremost\nand start by asking yourself what is the\nanger telling me\nwhat is the anger saying\nbecause if we don't want to judge\nourselves for being angry we have to\nunderstand it we have to listen to it\ndoesn't mean follow what it wants you to\ndo listening to it means literally\nlistening to it or not i guess\nmetaphorically listening to it\nit doesn't mean following its direction\nbecause anger like why have human beings\nall human beings are capable of\nexhibiting anger feeling anger why is\nthis conserved through human evolution\nit's because anger is a useful emotion\nand the place to start if you have a\njudgmental relationship with anger is\nwith information and understanding\nso often times anger manifests as a sign\nof something like disrespect\nso as you ask as you start to feel angry\ninstead of suppressing it ask yourself\nyou know what what am i angry about what\nis the anger telling me\nand then you may find something that's\nreally really important which is that oh\ni'm being disrespected\nor i'm being treated unfairly or i feel\nlike i'm being treated unfairly\nand that's really really important\nbecause i want you all to consider two\nsituations one is where you suppress the\nanger and you are being disrespected\nand as you suppress that what's going to\nhappen you're not going to address the\ndisrespect you will continue operating\nin that situation as you continue\noperating in that situation you will\ncontinue to be disrespected as you\ncontinue to be disrespected you will\ncontinue to squash down the anger and\nyour life will not improve and you will\nsuffer through every minute of it and\nthe more angry you feel because you push\nit down and you continue to get\ndisrespected the more you're going to\nbeat yourself up and the more you beat\nyourself up the more you will allow\nyourself to be disrespected\nit's going to be a vicious cycle in the\nwrong direction which is exactly why\nanger explodes\nbecause we suppress it\nright and we sort of know that\nsuppressed anger explodes\nso anger is a useful form of information\nand as we listen to our anger as we\nstart to recognize okay where are you\ncoming from\nit starts to build a healthy\nrelationship with it\nbecause now you're not judging it you're\nnot squashing it down you're not giving\ninto it and letting it explode you're\nlistening to it what is the information\nthat you're trying to give me\nand oftentimes anger is a response to\nhurt\nright so if you think about what's the\nmost basic\nform of anger that people reliable form\nof people that anger experience it's\nwhen they get hurt\nit's a protection against hurt\nso if i like you know\ni'll give you all a great example\nso\nabout a week ago i stubbed my toe\nagainst a table leg\nand boy did i get pissed off\ndamn that table leg\nthen i kicked the table leg for doing\nthis to me\nand then i hurt more\nand then i felt more angry\nright so like\nif you all have ever gotten angry at an\ninanimate object\ni think there's like a great subreddit\nabout this stupid people fighting things\nor something\nright like when you get angry and like\nthink about that doesn't make any sense\nit's not the table legs fault\nbut it's a natural human reaction\nwhen we get hurt to feel angry and if\nyou want to understand how baked in it\nhas nothing to do with other people it's\nall just the way that we're wired all\nyou got to do is stub your toe\nand you'll see how anger is a response\nto her so once again ask yourself when\nyou're feeling angry\nhow was i hurt\nand get to the source of that\nbecause what tends to happen when we see\nthese abusive angry households\nwhat's usually happening is those\nparents that are abusive or angry or\nexplode aren't in touch with what the\nanger is telling them\nand so they displace that anger onto\nother people\nthey don't acknowledge their own hurt\nso when i've worked with people who have\nthings like diagnoses like antisocial\npersonality disorder which is like kind\nof like sociopathy\nor when i worked with people in jail\nwhen i worked with criminals\nwhat i tend to find is that a lot of\nthem are angry\nand the reason that they're angry is\nbecause they've been hurt in some way\nso if you want to develop a healthy\nrelationship with your anger start to\nask yourself about how have you been\nhurt\nwhat is the hurt that underlies this\nanger\nbecause anger is just a source of\ninformation we're not saying embrace it\nwe're not saying love it we're not\nsaying because you're not ready for that\nyet the first step for 99 of people that\ni've worked with is to understand what\nanger is trying to tell them\nand hopefully you'll know this very\nsimple principle that when someone is\nheard\nwhen someone listens to you\nwhen someone feels heard and listened to\nthe emotion goes down\nand then you'll be able to develop a\nrelationship you'll be able to control\nit\neven then controlling really isn't the\ngoal living with it is the goal\nbut it'll decompress it some and then\nyou'll start to form a healthy\nrelationship with anger and you'll start\nto realize that your anger is only\nlooking out for you\njust like all of your other emotions\nright we have these emotions because\nthey're evolutionarily\nadvantageous so if you want to build a\nhealthy relationship with anger really\nreally challenging because society\ntreats anger unlike all of the other\nnegative emotions\nit's the only emotion that is almost\nuniversally demonized vilified\nright and even if you look at\nthese hero these movies where like the\nhero is on his quest for vengeance or\nshe's on her quest for vengeance\nwhen a hero or heroine is on their quest\nfor vengeance what do they do at the end\nthey forgive\ncompassion\nanger doesn't take it all the way to the\nend\nit's always compassion at the end so we\ntreat anger differently it's the only\nthing that we don't allow ourselves to\nfeel it's the only thing that we judge\nourselves for feeling\nand so if you want to start to develop a\nhealthy relationship with anger start by\nasking yourself where is this coming\nfrom what are you trying to tell me\nbecause all emotions are sources of\ninformation\nthey're ways that your brain processes\ndifferent experiences that you have as\nyou start listening to it and we're just\ngoing to be curious right we're not\ngiving into it because that's too\ndangerous\nwe're just going to listen to it that\nnon-judgmentalness that listening that\ncommunication\nis what's going to form the foundation\nof building a healthy relationship with\nanchor so someone's asking about\nstoicism so let's talk about stoicism\nfor a second so i i i'm not an expert on\nstoicism like i've read meditations my\nmarcus aurelius i've been told by other\npeople that marcus aurelius is not the\nbest\nstoic philosopher\ni'm not an expert on philosophy\nbut i think the key thing about\nstoicism at least from my understanding\nof it is not in the absence of feeling\nit\nit's in the control of the reaction to\nit which is exactly what the buddhist\nand hindu traditions say\nright so this is where like if you look\nat these eastern philosophies they don't\nemotions are a part of life\nit's in our reaction to it that\nwe success is good or bad\nso virtue is not in in an absence of\nfeeling it it's not the goal is that\nnumbness\nright so if you look at like\neastern perspectives the goal is\nacceptance\nit's not denial which is what\nsuppressing anger does it's about\naccepting your emotions so i think\nstoicism is basically i want to say it's\nvery similar\nit's sort of acknowledging that you're\nallowed to feel that way but not letting\nthat thing control you and you retaining\ncontrol of the emotion as opposed to the\nother way around\num\nso how do you deal with other people's\nanger even if it's not aimed at you my\nreaction is typically fear\nso that's a great question so how do you\ndeal with anger in other people my\nreaction is fear so the control that you\nshould exert is in your reaction\nso and this works\nin a sense really well although it's\nvery scary so if someone is being angry\nwith you and they're behaving with you\ninappropriately\nhow do you manage their anger\nyou don't manage their anger you manage\nyour own fear\nso what happens when people deal with\nother people's anger is they walk on\neggshells oh no i don't want to make\nthem angry i don't want to make them\nangry\nand in doing so you breed bad behavior\nbecause when they get angry you\naccommodate\nso the right way to deal with other\npeople's anger\nis to actually not be controlled by your\nfear\nand if someone says something\ninappropriately whether they're gonna\nblow up or not you\nface them with strength you don't face\nthem with fear you say hey i understand\nyou're angry right now but what you're\nsaying is completely unacceptable\nyou need to tone it down a notch if you\nneed to go take a walk go take a walk\ni care about you i love you but your\nbehavior is completely unacceptable\nyou want to do it calm you don't want to\ngive on to your own anger you don't want\nto give in to your fear you don't want\nto admit mistakes that you didn't make\nthat's how you deal with other people's\nanger\nand the interesting thing is there's\nlike tons of research on this on\nboundary setting\nand there's even a book on borderline\npersonality disorder called walking on\neggshells\nwhich talks about how when you are\ndealing with people with bpd\nthe more boundaries you allow them to\ncross the worse the behaviors and the\nexplosions and things like that become\nso like dealing with other people's\nanger is about setting appropriate\nboundaries and not reacting to your own\nfear\nnow there are a couple of important\ncaveats to this which is that you may\nexist in an environment where you can't\nset boundaries and there's an inherent\npower dynamic\nright so like if i'm like 15 years old\nand i have an abusive parent who gets\nreally really angry and i try to set\nboundaries with them and it just doesn't\nwork because they're physically stronger\nthan i am they have financial control\nover me and things like that\nthat's a really challenging situation\nyou'd be surprised though at how far\nthat can go\nright and and it's even\nsaying something like\ni understand that you're my dad and you\nhit me because you think you can\ni do not think when you hit me it makes\nyou a good parent i do not think it\nteaches me the right lessons\ni'm really curious what are you trying\nto accomplish by doing this\nand that's the kind of thing that if you\ntell to a parent\nmay make them angry\nbut if you manage your tone properly and\nstuff like that i have seen progress in\nthose kinds of situations\nbecause oftentimes parents aren't evil\nright they lose control of their anger\nand like even pointing out to parents\nthat what you're doing hurts me\ndo you understand that is that your\nintention is your goal to try to hurt me\nso like these are hard words to say to\npeople in power dynamics but like\nsometimes that's what you got to do and\nif you can't do that or that's unsafe\nthen unfortunately the only thing is\nlike bide your time or seek like\nyou know safe haven resources\ni'm not suggesting that you challenge\nsomeone who has a power dynamic over you\nbut if you're asking what the right\nanswer is that's what i think the right\nanswer is\nsometimes you got to be smart about it\nright it's like\nbiding your time until you can leave the\nhouse and then never look back\nhow do you deal with anger once you've\nbecome independent you do not let guilt\nwin\nthat's how you deal with anger once you\nbecome independent if you've been\ndependent on someone who's angry with\nyou\ndo you all understand that\nyou buy your time play it safe\ndon't challenge them and then gtfo and\nonce you gtfo and they no longer have\npower over you their tune will change\ncome home for christmas no i'm not going\nto do that\nwhy are you mad at me because you've\nbeen physically abusive\nthat was in the past\nit still hurts\ni'm sorry\ni'm\ni'm confused what are you expecting that\nto do when you say i'm sorry what effect\ndo you think that that has\ni'm curious when did you start to become\nsorry\nlike for the years that the abuse went\non did you feel sorry\nuh\nyeah of course\nthen why didn't you do something about\nit\nuh\nit was hard for me okay\nthe damage is done\nright like don't let like this is the\nother i know it's kind of we're moving\noff topic here but how do you deal with\nanger\nyou don't give in to the other emotions\nwhether it's fear or guilt or anything\nlike that i'm feeling angry just talking\nabout it because i'm thinking about all\nthe people\nso this is like good right so now i'm\nfeeling angry and we're going to\nmeditate in a second i'm feeling angry\nbecause i've worked with a lot of people\nwho are in y'all's shoes who have been\nin unfair power dynamics\nand it makes me so angry that those\npeople were taken advantage of\nand so i'm listening to that anger and\ni'm using that to help me speak\nbecause if you're out there and you're\nlistening to this\nlike i'm speaking for you\ni don't even know if that makes any\nsense\nright and anger isn't a negative it's\nnot a bad thing\nand if you've been treated unfairly and\nyou feel angry about it and there's an\nunfair power dynamic like i do believe\nthat if you act in a right way you will\nget some degree of peace and closure and\nsometimes that peace and closure means\nsevering a relationship with someone\nhaving that person want a relationship\nand then slamming the door in their face\nand then you're gonna feel guilty and\nthen you're not gonna give in to that\nand you're gonna tell yourself that like\nit's okay for me to feel guilty but\nthis person does not deserve a\nrelationship with me\nthey had their chance well i'm sorry\nlike you should forgive\nlet me explain something to y'all no one\nshould forgive\nforgiveness is not entitled to anyone\nforgiveness is purely at the discretion\nof the aggrieved party no one is owed\nforgiveness\nyou"
