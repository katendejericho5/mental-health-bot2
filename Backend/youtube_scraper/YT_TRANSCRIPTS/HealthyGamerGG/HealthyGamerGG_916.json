    "transcript": "I spent a lot of time checking out tons\nof streams and I didn't see a lot of\nbrown people\num I don't still to this day I don't\nwhen I find one it's like finding your\nunicorn welcome everyone\nhello hello super excited to be here\nhaving us\num so welcome welcome\nso I'm gonna start with this like so I I\nguess in a second we're gonna introduce\nourselves but before we even do that\nwhat's y'all's understanding of what\nwe're doing here like what are we doing\nhere and like why are we doing it does\nanyone have any idea\nI I have a decent idea I mean obviously\nwe're all like creators right so we have\nwe all have we all have something in\ncommon there and there's a lot of\ninteresting topics that we can talk\nabout in relation to that sure bring our\nown experiences to the table and stuff\nlike that absolutely I I was under the\ndistinct impression that you were going\nto be our Nick Fury and we were going to\nform the Avengers but\nI am somewhat of a pseudo Boomer so I\ndon't understand that reference can\nsomeone please explain\n[Laughter]\nI haven't seen any of them\n[Laughter]\nno better time like the present\nthat's what I've been doing who can\nexplain to me what metric seconds was is\nsaying\nso there's this uh there's this uh IP\ncalled Marvel\nhave the Avengers okay they they have\nthe Avengers which is like a group of\nsuperheroes from all sorts of different\nbackgrounds and stuff and they come\ntogether under Nick Fury's lead and\nthat's the best way I can describe it\nokay okay and so it's like Smash\nBrothers but in the film industry yeah\nthat's helpful yes and anyone else have\nsomething that they want to add about\nkind of what we're doing here or what\nthe goal is or what you know what y'all\nare\nor does that pretty much something yeah\ngo ahead\nmaybe to like give an insight as well\nand\n[Music]\nit's not always like\nthe front that we put on there's like a\nlot that kind of goes on\nbehind absolutely very well said Ruby\ntrue so here's how I would describe what\nwe're doing here\nso I in my background which I'll get to\nin a little bit but so I've been an\neducator and in a formal sense and I've\nalso been a clinician so I work with\npatients sometimes and one of the things\nthat I found was that there's like\neducation and then there's like\npractical application\nso you can tell someone so I ran a\nprogram that sort of trained physicians\nin Wellness okay so we trained like 600\npeople\nin wellness and what we sort of found is\nthat there's a difference between like\ngiving lectures On Wellness like oh like\nlet's talk about how to be well like oh\nyou should meditate every day and like\nyou can give people information about\nbeing well but the translation of that\ninformation into application into their\nlives was very challenging\nso when I think about coaching what I\nreally think about is a practical\napplication of information\nand so what we're going to be doing here\nI have a curriculum but thankfully you\nguys don't have to do homework or\nworksheets or things like that so I've\ngot a curriculum of essentially eight or\nnine topics which we're going to touch\non hopefully over the course of eight\nweeks\nbut instead of going through them like\none at a time okay today we're going to\nbe talking about burnout here's what\nleads to burnout today we're going to be\ntalking about dealing with toxicity from\nyour community today we're going to talk\nabout how being a content creator means\nthat your work is never done right\nbecause how do you know when you're it's\nenough to like you've streamed enough\nhow do you know when the thumbnail for\nyour Youtube upload is good enough right\nso there are a lot of unique challenges\nthat content creators face which we\nactually understand pretty well here at\nhealthy gamer because we've worked with\nabout 300 or 400 content creators at\nthis point so we've synthesized all of\nthat experience into something of a\ncurriculum\ninstead of just teaching it though what\nwe tend to find is the most useful way\nto sort of really dig in and understand\nthat is through y'all's experiences and\nso as Ruby was kind of saying and I hope\nthat's okay that I call you that for now\nuntil we introduce you and you tell us\nhow you're referred to\nis that we're going to sort of hear from\ny'all's perspective sort of hear about\nthe challenges that you face educate not\nonly like your community members about\nwhat it's like to be a content creator\neducate aspiring content creators but\nalso educate all the other content\ncreators right about what is it like to\nstruggle with and then hopefully in\nterms of as we go through curriculum\nwhat'll do what will happen is that any\ncreators who are out there watching can\nhopefully benefit from it so that's a\npart of like the AOE healing approach\nthat we have at healthygamer which is\nthat we're going to work through\nproblems together here and in doing so\nhopefully help people out in the\naudience any questions about that\nokay now so a couple of quick boundaries\nand kind of layout sort of stuff so\nwe're going to be meeting for about 90\nminutes once a week for a period of\neight weeks everyone kind of familiar\nwith that\nso sometimes on this stream we'll have\nuh interviews group streams things like\nthat where people will discuss personal\nthings that's totally fine if you guys\nfeel like discussing personal stuff you\ncan if you want to discuss issues\nrelated to Psychiatry mental health\nmental illness that's totally fair game\nbut just to be clear we're not\nnecessarily going to be looking for that\nso this is not like uh you know tell us\nabout all your deep traumas on the\ninternet if it applies to your job as a\ncontent creator you're welcome to share\nwhatever you feel comfortable with but\ndoes everyone understand that I'm not\ngoing to be doing diagnostic assessments\non anyone I'm not going to be providing\ntreatment to anyone or anything like\nthat we clear on that\nhopefully within the next week you guys\nshould be getting a communication from\nsomeone on our team about if anyone\nfeels like they do need clinical help or\nSupport over the course of these eight\nweeks y'all can let us know we'll do our\nbest to make a referral or find\nresources in your area or things like\nthat but we can't guarantee that we can\nyou know sort of we're certainly not\ngoing to provide treatment and we can't\nguarantee that we can find you someone\nbut we'll do our best to help everyone\nclear on that there'll be more details\nhopefully within the next week okay\nthank you um so everyone cool in terms\nof boundaries there you don't have to\ndiscuss anything that you don't want to\nall right\nso other things so normally when we run\ngroups there are a couple things that\nare different so normally we'll sort of\nsay that like you know there's an\nentitlement to privacy right so what\ndiscusses what we discuss in group stays\nin the group\nthere's an obvious exception to that\nbecause everyone is aware that we're\nlive streaming this right\nthis is the kind of thing where I want\nus to all be responsible for protecting\neveryone else in the group\nso I know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike if someone if you feel like someone\nis becoming uncomfortable with something\nthat we're discussing anyone here can\nput the brakes on the group and say hey\nare we sure we really want to discuss\nthis is like do you feel safe do you\nfeel comfortable everyone kind of okay\nwith that\nokay yep so\num I'm gonna keep going and we'll get to\nintroductions I promise\nso we're gonna try to like learn stuff\nand grow and change over the course of\nthis group are we kind of familiar with\nthat\nso the first question that I have is who\nis responsible for change in the group\nourselves ourselves yeah okay\nuh wait is there a girl who are you\npointing at\nI was playing\nanybody so so hold on a second so let's\nlet's tunnel down into that so is there\na girl do you believe that you are\nresponsible for change in the group do\nyou believe that Zell is responsible for\nyour change or do you believe that all\nof the above\nall the above absolutely that's the\nright answer so this is something that I\nthink is really important generally\nspeaking when we go through life\nwe are the ones that are responsible for\nchange right it's on me\nso part of why I love group is actually\nlike this is different\nI want each and every one of you to\nunderstand that there are five other\npeople in this call\nand four of those people you are also\nresponsible for helping\nright so I'm responsible for teaching\ny'all stuff helping you move forward in\nlife you're responsible for yourself but\nyou are also responsible for everyone\nelse in the group\nhow do people feel about that\nsounds good really is that normal have\nyou all been in a situation like that\nbefore\nno but I trust you\nI mean I just moved in with a bunch of\nuh like uh of my friends from the twitch\nsector so I it's kind of like that where\nlike we're all just kind of like\nin this together you know so awesome\nkind of the same thing with this okay so\na couple of other things so we asked\ny'all to bring three things so we have\nthree core values at healthy gamer that\nwe ask people to bring to the table and\nthese are going to be a little bit weird\nso the first is compassion\nthe second is authenticity\nand the third is presence\nokay so these are the values that we ask\nyou all to bring to the table\nso we want you all to be authentic and\ncompassionate in here so I doubt this is\ngoing to be a situation here because you\nknow we're all live streaming and stuff\nbut generally speaking like you know\ndon't alt tab like pay attention as best\nas you can if you struggle with\nattentional issues or something like\nthat you're welcome to bring that up\nwith the group but you know we're all\ngoing to kind of be here and mindful as\nbest as we can there may be exceptions\nif someone's dog runs in or you know\nsomeone's mom calls and that's totally\nfine but generally speaking we ask you\nall to do that the other thing that I\nkind of want to point out is that\nwe want you all to be authentic and\ncompassionate but not necessarily polite\nwhat do you all think what's the\ndifference between being authentic and\ncompassionate and being polite\nI don't know in my mind it kind of comes\ndown to like\nI don't know like toxic positivity like\nbeing being too like\ntoo kind about like I don't know not not\nbeing willing to like open up the\nthe door of honesty you know or I guess\nauthenticity which is the whole\ndifference factor of it yeah oh go for\nit sorry [ __ ]\nbeing polite sometimes can um I'm I'm\nBritish so I'm really good at being\npolite but also it can\nalmost cut off or like if it cuts off\nyour own feelings as well because you're\njust being polite you're not actually\nsaying\nyou know you just say things to be\npolite thank you that's how you go\nthrough life like a lot as a Canadian I\nagree so yeah yeah so I think it's kind\nof interesting because sometimes you\nknow what we tend to find is that as\npeople are polite right so I I once was\nworking with someone who was\nkept on getting into Troublesome\nrelationships\noh you know like this relationship fell\napart this relationship fell apart this\nrelationship fell apart everyone out\nthere is mean and toxic and then at some\npoint like if you really want to be like\nauthentic and compassionate and help\nsomeone with this problem you got to ask\nthe question like maybe it's not\neveryone else maybe it's you\nand so I hopefully will become\ncomfortable enough with each other we\ncan feel safe enough with it with with\neach other that we can challenge each\nother authentically right and with\ncompassion so we don't want to be mean\nbut at the same time we always want to\nbe compassionate we want to be kind but\nat the same time sometimes in order to\ngrow we have to take a hard look at\nourselves\nand sometimes we have blind spots and so\nthat's why groups are really really\nimportant because as you all sort of\nhave the shared experience we're all\ncontent creators you know hopefully\nthat'll we'll sort of figure that out\neveryone kind of okay with that for now\nthis will the rubber will hit the road\nlater with this I guarantee you it'll\nget messy\nso a couple of other things so um I'm\nthe group facilitator so this is kind of\nweird right so people sort of think\nabout okay what does this mean if you're\nthe group facilitator so I am up here\nand I am a facilitator so what that\nmeans is that I too am a content creator\nso I kind of know what it's like to be a\ncontent creator and I have an additional\nlet's say training or expertise or\nthings like that and I'll sort of be\nfacilitating the group and so it's going\nto be really confusing for a while\nwhether I'm supposed to take care of all\ny'all y'all are supposed to take care of\nall of each other are you all supposed\nto take care of me\nalso yes yeah we'll see right like we'll\nsee we'll see we'll see but it's it's\nokay to think about all right so another\nthing that I want to say is that you\nknow even though I'm the sort of the\npeer facilitator of this group\nI'm not perfect and if anyone has\nconcerns with anything that I say or do\nor I make a mistake you're welcome to\nbring it up directly on stream you're\nalso welcome to you know contact our\nproducer or other people if you don't\nwant to bring it up on stream and create\ndrama or whatever but generally speaking\nI think it's it's totally fine and one\nof the skills that we're going to be\nteaching in group is actually conflict\nresolution so hopefully at some point\nprobably not the first couple weeks but\nlater on like people will challenge each\nother there will be conflict if you you\nknow y'all are welcome to criticize me\nor say hey I don't appreciate what\nyou're doing or things like that make\nsense\nall right my Spiel is over\num anyone have questions before we jump\nto introductions\ncool\nall right yeah okay I do\nwhy did you choose us that's a great\nquestion\num so I've got a weird answer for you I\ndidn't\nokay so I have no idea actually why\ny'all were chosen and I know it sounds\nkind of weird\nno clue so this is something that I try\nto do so for example like when we do\ngroup coaching like the coach doesn't\nchoose the clients\nright even as a doctor I don't choose my\npatients\nand so I I don't know\nI'm sure you all are amazing\nuh I'm I think there was a very careful\nselection process but I am purposefully\nblind to it right so I actually know\nvery little about something all I know\njust because I I like the work that you\ndo but I'm going to pretend that I I\ndon't you know don't but but actually I\npurposely try to come into this\ncompletely blind so that I have no\npreconceived notions about any drama\nthat you all have been through or that\nyou're a good person or bad person or\nyou play a particular video game that I\ndislike because I play a competitor or\nwhatever or for example that like you\nknow just as an example like I've been\nprotos for since day one in six pool\nrushing is for noobs right so for all\nthat kind of stuff we want to be like I\nactually have no idea\nhow does that sound is that weird\nah it's not weird at all no\nyeah sounds great\nI actually plays there too\nrandom\ngood to hear\nany other questions\nI commend you uh can I not go first on\nintroductions because I'm absolutely\ndo other people okay with uh metric\nseconds and not going first\nso yeah I want to commend two people\nalready Ruby for actually asking a\nquestion because I don't know if you\nknow this but like you know like most of\nthe time if someone's like does anybody\nhave questions no one ever asks a\nquestion\nyou'll notice that so I commend you for\nactually taking the opportunity and\nyou've actually opened the door I don't\nknow if you'll get this but you've\nopened the door for other people to ask\nquestions you got that Ruby\nso if we want to really dive in before\nwe get into it which I can't help myself\nwhat do you all think metric seconds\nwould have been more likely or less\nlikely to share his concern about going\nfirst if Ruby had not asked a question\nwe're gonna go on a whim and say less\nlikely\nyeah right did you did you notice that\nuh metric seconds that like you sort of\nlike since someone broke the ice it was\neasier for you to break the ice\noh yeah right so that's really cool\nso like he was able to share a concern\nthat he's got and we haven't asked you\nfor your pronouns yet so apologies if I\nyou know misgender anyone but\nand like no you got it but that's really\nawesome so I think participation in the\ngroup is going to make things easier for\neveryone so strong work for both y'all\none person for asking a question and the\nsecond person for letting us know what\ntheir boundary is right so now we're\ngoing to learn how to respect that\nso let's do introductions do you all\nwant me to go first or do you want me to\ngo in the middle or do you want me to go\nlast\ndo you like to go together\n[Laughter]\nuh I assumed I would go first but out of\npoliteness I gave people the choice\nokay thank you I will go first other\npeople okay with that\nso what I was thinking in terms of\nintroductions is tell us you know what\nyou go by or what you want to be\naddressed to buy\num please also this is a chance for you\nto tell us a little bit and all the\nviewers about your stream what kind of\nstream you do things like that and I\npersonally would love to hear a little\nbit about how you got to be a content\ncreator like why you became a content\ncreator and also just to kind of kick\nthings off uh one of the challenges or\nstruggles that you face as a content\ncreator so name if you want to specify\nyour pronouns you're more than welcome\nto tell us you know where we can find\nyou and learn more about you if we want\nto see how awesome you are at streaming\nand then tell us why you kind of got\ninto content creation and the challenge\nthat you struggle with\nis that cool\nokay so my name is alok\num y'all can find me at healthygamer\nunderscore GG\nuh so I'm I'm a twitch streamer but I'm\nalso a psychiatrist by training and\nspent several years studying to become a\nmonk\num I got into streaming because as I was\nworking with Gamers predominantly\noriginally at the beginning I realized\nthat most of the conversations I was\nhaving with them were like\nI was repeating myself so I'd work with\n50 people and like with all 50 of those\npeople I would explain the same stuff\nabout stress about anxiety about you\nknow identity things like that and I\njust got to wondering okay what would\nhappen if I have a public conversation\ncould people who were watching benefit\nand that's how I started content\ncreation one of the challenges that I\nhave as a content creator is everything\nbesides the content creation\nso there's a lot of stuff that you have\nto do as a content creator which is not\nstreaming I kid you all not this is the\nmost excited I am about streaming in\nlike the last three months\nbecause I love actually like talking to\npeople working with people being with\npeople\nand there's a bunch of stuff\nthat goes on behind the scenes which is\nwork that I find very draining\noh y'all can call me all look or Dr K\nwhichever one you feel more comfortable\nwith by the way\nthank you\nwho's next\nI'll go next cool\nall right uh hi I'm Michael uh I go by\nsmirky you can just call me smirky for\nthe sake of this uh he him his pronouns\num let's see I have been streaming for\nuh I just celebrated uh 10 years of\nstreaming\num I started on YouTube in 2012 and then\ncame over to Twitch around 2015 2016 and\ngot partnered in 2018 I am a lgbtqi plus\nuh variety streamer I uh started out\nstreaming a game called Toontown it used\nto be a Disney MMO from like way back in\nthe day so there's probably some\nNostalgia happening right now for quite\na few people\num the game is still around even though\nDisney shut it down like\nalmost nine years ago uh there was like\na community that's kept the community\nalive so it's really fun um I always\nlove playing Toontown but uh recently\nI've been streaming all kinds of other\ngames I tend to play games that are like\nmultiplayer you know interactive\num so even a game like Cult of the land\nthat's like single player but like you\nget the twitch integration and it's like\nsuper interactive I love that stuff\num I also do a bunch of Charity\nstreaming as well so um we've raised\nover 65 000 for various Charities since\nI first started fundraising for charity\num which is great thank you uh it's uh\nreally great uh just helping out you\nknow using my platform for like a cause\nmuch bigger than myself and I absolutely\nlove uh to do that\num I also just recently graduated\ncollege in December uh like last\nDecember\num so I know a lot about like\nstreaming while you're in school and\nthings like that I'm trying to like how\ndo you balance that\num and then also\num\nwhat am I missing I'm missing something\nelse any challenges you face there's a\nstream or anything in particular right\nyou find challenging yeah\num\nyeah for me it's uh I guess lately it's\nbeen the shift from like\nstreaming specifically just like one\nSoul game and Catering to that\nparticular audience and now that I've\nlike broadened my horizons as I continue\nto do that starting to do more variety\nlike you know I guess uh\nkind of like both catering to that\naudience and also like\num a new audience and then also like\nconsistency has always been a struggle\nfor me too\num especially while I was in school like\nnot really having much of a schedule so\num that's that's something I'm kind of\nexperimenting with right now\num and uh\nyeah that's that's all I got I think\nawesome thank you so much\nsmirky thank you\nthank you yes anyone feel like going\nnext\nyeah before I forget hi\num I have ADHD that's why I'm sat here\nthe whole time going\nsay the word\num so hi my name is Ruby I've been\nstreaming on Twitch for about seven\nyears\nsix years\num I can feel my heartbeat hold on\n[Music]\num\nI stream\nmeditation\num and wellness content\num and that's kind of come around\nbecause of a my own anxiety and stuff so\nI do ASMR but I base it all around more\nmeditation kind of content\num I recently qualified this year as a\nsound therapist\num I do sound baths and I'm currently\ntraining\num to become like a meditation coach\num to help other people\nso I started streaming playing games\nbecause I was lonely playing games and\nwatching other people on Twitch and I\nthought\nhey I should try playing games with some\nother people on Twitch and see how that\ngoes\num\nand I found it made my anxiety worse\num\nstreaming and just like getting\nfocused on numbers and who was watching\nme and growth and I got partnered while\nI was gaming and doing like body paint\nand creative kind of stuff\num\nI just got so wrapped up in like numbers\nand everything and I was really\ndepressed as well\num and I was really struggling just to\ngo live every single day\nand\num\nI then trained as a yoga teacher\nbecause I wanted to quit streaming and I\nloved yoga I've been doing yoga about 10\nyears I wanted to do something\num I thought I wanted to do something to\nhelp other people but I realized my yoga\nteacher training was actually a journey\nfor myself\nand it helped me and\num during that yoga teacher training I\nactually stayed in a Buddhist temple in\nLondon every weekend while streaming\nfull-time during the week every weekend\nI would go and stay in the Buddhist\ntemple for six months and I made really\ngood friends with like the monks in\nthere and the people that lived there\nand I loved getting up in the mornings\nand listening to their practices really\nearly in the mornings of their gongs and\neverything they were doing every day and\nthen I'd go to my yoga teacher training\noff in this other room and then I'd come\nback out and eat with them and spend my\ntime with them and it was after that\nthat I realized\num I just wanted to kind of continue\ndown that path so I've trained as a\nentire yogic massage I've I've I love\ndoing different courses just to like\nmeet people and\num\nlike you can always learn something\nyou can always\num even if you're teaching\nyou can always be learning because like\nnobody is perfect and I still get\nanxiety like I think a lot of people\nassume that I'm absolutely fine because\nof the kind of content I do and I'm\nguiding other people\num but I'm always working on my own\npractice\num so now\num\nmy aims for streamer to be in service\nfor others and to be continually\nlearning and growing for myself\nawesome\nbeautiful kind of curious has anyone\nelse kind of struggled with focusing on\nmetrics and getting depressed as a\nresult anxious\nokay\nyeah been there done that what about\npeople assuming you're fine when you're\nnot and struggling to go live every day\nand awesome yeah that's part of the\nthing about being a content creator\nright yeah so that's that's part of that\nso we'll talk a little bit about that\nthose are both bullets on our nine point\ncurriculum so we'll we'll see when is\nthe right time to dive in\num anyone else want to introduce\nthemselves or who wants to go next\ngo for it sure I can go next\num so my name's Josh otherwise known as\nZell uh on the internet\num I've been content creating for a good\nwhile so basically how I got into it was\nuh I graduated from college\num and I so I I went to mechanical\nengineering uh hoping to get into the\nAerospace industry and uh that year uh I\nwas applying to Raytheon and they put me\non a hiring freeze because Congress had\ncut a bunch of Aerospace funding that\nyear so I was like okay I kind of have\nthis like weird year where I kind of\njust like waiting doing nothing and so\num I decided that I was going to\nmake content because that was something\nthat like I was always interested in\nlike at the time I was playing a lot of\nLeague of Legends uh streaming like\nbefore you even twitch what existed it\nwas back when like uh people were\nstreaming on owned and Justin.tv and\nstuff like that and like\num and I would watch some of my favorite\nleague players stream back then and so I\nwas like oh this is interesting and then\nalso in that time I started applying to\nrandom places and I got like an offer to\nbe a video producer for team curse at\nthe time for their league team and so\nthat's kind of my entry into it was that\nI gave up Engineering in my expensive\ncollege degree to go live my dreams or\nsomething\n[Laughter]\nthough that's what got me into it I\nstarted streaming league and then I I\nthink most people probably know me from\nmy time in offline TV or um or uh I used\nto host a show uh for Riot games called\num all chat uh so that's probably where\npeople have mostly heard of me and now I\nstream just like a bunch of nonsense\num and that's who I am as far as\nstruggles\num\nGod what don't I struggle with uh I\nstruggle I think the big one is\nkind of related to how people know me\nfrom uh which is offline TV and Riot\ngames like I feel like uh in a lot of\nways like kova hit me pretty hard like\nduring covet I kind of stopped content\ncreating I kind of lost my drive to do\nso and then so now it kind of feels like\nI'm starting over and I\ndon't have the same momentum that I felt\nlike I had in years past and so there's\nthis constant feeling of like how do I\nlive up to my own standards that I used\nto have for myself before and like kind\nof building off what ruby was saying\nabout metrics and stuff like that is\nthis always hanging in the back of my\nmind that like you know people have\nheard of me but people don't care about\nme anymore and so like how do I live up\nto other people's expectations how do I\nlive up to my own expectations and I I\nthink like that has been a big primary\nstruggle for me as a recent so\num\nyeah\nthanks for sharing Zell\nI can go next\num\nso I'm metric seconds uh everyone calls\nme metric uh he him totally fine uh\nI've been streaming almost six years one\nof your mods just yelled at me to get\nout of chat I'm so sorry uh and uh so\nI originally got into streaming because\num I had a really fun stomach illness\nthat stopped me from\nuh\ngoing out and being social with my\nfriends and\nI was looking for ways to actually be\nsocial and uh\neventually\nI you know moved on from YouTube let's\nplays that I used to watch all the time\nto realizing oh there's twitch and uh\nrealizing that I could just talk to a\nbunch of people\nthat like the same thing I did and uh\nthen I kind of thought you know it'd be\ncool if more people who looked like me\nwere streaming because I noticed that\nit's not very common\num it it and and also\nit looks fun so I saved up for a\ncomputer and\nbuilt it myself and started streaming\nand yeah six years in\num I kind of made my name on uh\ndeathless runs in darkest dungeon I put\nuh\n3 300 hours plus into that game so far\num sequel's okay so far it's not\ncomplete but uh\nI\nbeat myself mercilessly in that game\nwhile that game also beat me uh just to\nbeat it without dying and\nwhen I finally did it on the hardest\nsetting\nI had no idea what to do with myself I I\ngot partnered in that time but\nafter that I I didn't know\nwhat to do\num\nand uh\nthe goals after that just seemed\nlike I play every other game now in\nvariety on the hardest setting just\nbecause\nI don't know if I feel like I should or\njust because I can or I just like\nsuffering or\nI don't know but that's that's what I do\num\nand uh I don't care how many times I die\nor I fail or my soul gets crushed\num\nI think even how I present myself right\nnow with the knives kind of speaks to\nthat it's like I'm very\nthat's my personality of\nI have to fight something\num\nso\nnow I'm like practicing to like no hit\ncuphead or you know beat rimworld on the\nhardest setting or\nuh I hate myself I'm sorry that's that's\nme but yeah\num I love I love doing it like the sense\nof accomplishment when you get it that's\nthat's the fun part\num\nbut after after all that time those\nyears in darkest dungeon it's sort of\nlike\nlooking at the the numbers and the\nviewership and everything just drop off\nuh\nI I just sort of Wonder like\ndid I did I deserve all that success\nthat I had back then and where am I now\num and to there's a variety a thing that\nI really should be doing\num\nor should I just do the thing where I do\none game\nover and over and then\nuh\nnot be happy\njust doing that but everyone else shows\nup for that\nand is that really any different from a\nnine to five job where you do the same\nthing over and over again that you don't\nnecessarily love and I I don't know I\ndon't know so I I have days where I feel\nlike an abject failure and then other\ndays where something goes right in in\num on top of the world so\nyeah okay\nthank you so much for sharing thank you\nis there a girl do you feel comfortable\nintroducing yourself\noh gosh I'm last hey everyone my name is\nKathy AKA sir girl I've been streaming\non and off\num on Twitch for like the past 10 years\nor so and it's just been everyone's like\ntalking about all the variety games\nthey've done obviously for me it's just\nbeen non-stop Starcraft 95 of the time\nuh I'm mostly just stream Starcraft\nladder of you know playing Team games\nwith friends or getting coached by other\npeople and my streams consist of me kind\nof going over gameplay or just like\nwhat's going through my thoughts at the\ntime so that's the majority of the\ncontent that I create and um\nstreaming was something that I picked up\nwhen I was in college at the time that\nwas just in TV around uh that long time\nago\nand uh people were just telling me like\nhey Kathy you play this game\num it's getting popular on Twitch and\njust in TV you should you should try\nsharing it with folks and then once I\nstarted streaming a lot of people were\ninterested in the game and like talking\nabout it so just kind of picked up from\nthere and then I realized I can make\nsome money off of it as well as opening\nlots of doors of opportunities\num\nI would say like my streaming experience\nwas very helpful into uh where I am\ntoday uh right now I work at Activision\nBlizzard King so the company that\nactually made the game\nmy background also consists of working\nat Minecraft as well and a bunch of\nother service drops like waitressing and\nwhatnot so and one of the challenges I\nhave these days is kind of balancing\nthat corporate job and streaming and\ntrying to maximize my happiness from\nboth\nbut yeah nice to meet everyone awesome\nwelcome\nso thank you all so much for such\nsubstantive introductions\num\nlet me just\nexplain a couple of things\nso the first thing is that every day or\nfor first couple days we're gonna\nactually teach y'all particular\ncommunication skills\nso it's been our experience that if you\nwant to run a group effectively\npart of what you actually have to learn\nhow to do is like there are certain\nskills that we're going to use to help\neach other learn about ourselves and to\nlike bring sort of information out okay\num the other thing that I want you all\nto notice is that people's introductions\nwere of varying length\nright\nand that's actually perfectly okay so on\nany given day someone we may focus on\none particular person or one particular\nissue more\nthan other people and that's like that's\ntotally fine and over time though over\nthe course of eight weeks what we sort\nof want to make sure that we do is we\nsort of give everyone their fair share\nor try to help everyone in a substantial\nway\nso here's kind of an interesting\nquestion who's responsible for making\nsure that we have balanced participation\nall of us right so that means to be a\nlittle bit careful about you know just\nbeing mindful of who's participating who\nisn't and this is where things get kind\nof tricky right because if someone's not\nreally talking what do we do about that\nask them to participate\nparticipate more sell\nforeign\n[Laughter]\nyeah so I want you all to think a little\nbit about when do you feel the most\ncomfortable participating\nright and and oftentimes it's a question\nso if you all notice that someone's like\nnot participating in the discussion\ny'all can absolutely Loop them in\nokay\nmake sense any questions\nso I'm going to just toss a couple of\ntopics out\num and\nlet me know actually let me start with\nthis so did y'all kind of notice any\nthemes between what people were sort of\nsharing like anything kind of jump out\nto you where someone was saying\nsomething and you're like oh that's\nrelevant to me too like I'm that's an\nissue I struggle with or I want to learn\nmore about that anything kind of jump\nout to y'all when you were listening to\nother people\nuh yeah when um when smirky talked about\nswitching to variety okay and and the\npain of it it's it's\nyeah\num I feel you\nI've had my fair share of going to\npanels and like learning as much as I\ncan about variety streaming so\nokay and\num for me uh the uh uh it was\nuh Zerg with the balance between\ncorporate and uh and content creation\nbecause like I've been because now that\nI'm graduated I've been bound I've been\ntoying around with the question like\nwell do I actually finally get the\nchance to like be more consistent with\nstreaming or should I like\nyou know try and get a job to get on my\nfeet but then how can I you know be a\nlittle more consistent with streaming uh\nso I don't know it's a topic that's been\nfloating around in my mind too in terms\nof my future but yeah do both popped out\ndo both\nI like I when I heard that it reminded\nme like when I was working at Riot but\nalso streaming and I was figuring that\nout and so I came up with something that\nI tried and didn't exactly go super well\nso I could share that at some point too\nall right cool and I mean it's kind of\nlike man I just went through all these\nyears of school like literally ever\nsince I started streaming like it's been\nstreaming in school but school's always\nlike first right and then it's like oh\nwell now I could like dive into the\ncorporate world I'm I feel confident in\nmyself but also like\nit's kind of something I want to do a\nlittle more so\nyou know it's like\nhey Society won't expect you to like get\na job and do that but it's like hey\nstreaming is kind of something I like to\ndo too so do I run and chase with the\npassion or do I dabble in both a little\nbit do I dabble in streaming and see how\nit goes I that's definitely been on my\nmind I think the answer I'm curious if\npeople sort of resonate this was as\nsomeone said it earlier do more\ndo more both do it all\nwho's felt that way yeah\nyeah\nright so we can maybe dig into where\nthat comes from how we handle it what we\ndo about it\nanyone else kind of want to chime in\nwith stuff that may have resonated with\nthem\nyeah so when metric said do you just\nplay the same game and then it turns\ninto like feeling the same as a nine to\nfive I'm sitting there thinking\nI'm not a gaming streamer but I know\nthat and I think that goes with like\nwhatever content you're making when you\nknow what brings the numbers it's that\nBreakaway from\num knowing what brings numbers and what\nbrings happiness\num and\nI try not to look at my view account and\nit's very hard like I don't have it on\nwhile I'm streaming and in the kind of\nwork that I do I continually tell myself\nif I just made a few people's day better\nthan my job was kind of done but also at\nthe same time it's my job\nand I want to be like it's very I find\nit very hard in what I do I'm so\ngrateful for what like position I'm in\nin life that I can do this and help\nother people and I like\nmy emphasis was always on helping other\npeople and then I can get myself so busy\nthat I forget about if I'm actually\nhelping me and I think that happens not\njust in in gaming like when you're\nplaying the same game that's not good\nfor your mind like monotonously doing\nthe same thing over and over just for\nthe numbers so yeah I was I wanted to\nlet people know that that's like a\nnot just a gaming stream I think\nI'm curious does anyone else find\nthemselves is Ruby put it continually\ntelling yourself something\ndoes that resonate with anyone else for\nsure yeah yeah for a girl what you're I\nsee you're nodding a little bit what do\nyou find yourself continually telling\nyourself\nuh that I'll get better at my game I'll\npractice I need to up that MMR and I\nlose for several hours straight and I'm\nlike okay why am I here\nis it's like a vicious cycle sometimes\nyeah right it's kind of interesting so\nI've got kind of a quick question for\nyou all and we'll give other people a\nchance to sort of uh share anything that\nresonated with them\nso when we do we continually tell\nourselves things that we believe\nI'm gonna we can affirmations here and\naffirming yeah basically yeah\nif you continually affirm something to\nyourself you will start to believe it\nand it will become your truth\nOkay so\nso but that suggests that the\ncontinually telling part comes prior to\nthe believing part\nright so that's kind of interesting it\ndoes\nbecause the continually telling us\ntherefore sort of suggests that we don't\nactually believe it on some level\nwhich is why we continually tell\nourselves\nright because we want to believe it we\nwant it to be true so we'll dig into\nstuff like that potentially as well\nanyone else want to just share anything\nthat um kind of resonated with them\nthat someone else said\nif if something else pops up let me know\nso I have a list of like a ton of stuff\nthese are all the discussion topics\neight or nine of these are things that\nwe've sort of prepped for\num I think there's a lot to discuss here\nso I'd like to actually start by sort of\nteaching a skill for the day\nand the skill that we're going to be\nlearning is digging into ambiguity\nso sometimes if you pay attention people\nare going to be making statements that\nare a little bit ambiguous so I'm going\nto highlight\nand digging into ambiguity is an\nopportunity to expand into what someone\nis saying so I'm going to highlight two\nthings that I've heard I mean all of\ny'all have done this but I'm going to\nsort of highlight two things that jumped\nout to me so uh metric said at some\npoint I noticed when when I was\nstreaming that other people didn't look\nlike me\nand so I find myself being curious like\nwhat does he mean by that what is he how\ndoes he perceive himself what did he see\nas other people so that's like a good\nexample of like you know if we sort of\ninquire about that like we can learn a\nlittle bit more about what he was\nperceiving maybe he feels like a little\nbit of an outsider you know like we can\nkind of get into stuff like that Zell\nalso zelkan opened the door for us a\nlittle bit more and he's like I was\ntrying to figure out work a work-life\nbalance and I tried something\nand I can share that later if people\nwant\nso that is Zell being polite\nright\ndo you all see the politeness there\nI do Somebody explain the politeness\nabsolutely yeah yeah that you know being\nmindful of the I guess like the setting\nthat we're in all the people watching\nlet's be mindful of everyone else by the\nway I'm a little bit on the sarcastic\nside and exaggerated side zella's\nalready pointed this out right he's like\nif I want to bully people I can say what\nyou said but so so that's just my Mo and\nif that you know rubs on anyone the\nwrong way please let me know I can\nabsolutely tone it down a notch I am\nafter all content creator\nso\num\nso let's just think a little bit about\nthis politeness so like who here when\nZell said that like\ndid we ask him about it is that because\nwe haven't had time\nwhat are the reasons that we may not ask\nabout it\nright so sometimes we've got to be a\nlittle bit careful because zella's being\npolite\nbut I'll give you all kind of an example\nso yeah how's everybody's week going oh\nmy week is like my week sucks I went\nthrough a terrible breakup\nand then in that moment I don't want to\nlike bog down the group with my story\nand then are y'all gonna ask me about\nthe breakup\nthey want to talk about it how do we\nknow if they want to if they want to\nunderstand beautiful do you want to talk\nabout it so I can see Ruby's experience\nas a Healer in other parts of life\nreally shining through here\nright so so one of the challenges that\nwe sometimes face is that like we want\nto also respect the person's boundaries\nright what it's like does a person want\nto talk about their breakup do they not\nwant to talk about their breakup so this\nis where we're just gonna have to figure\nout where our balances is a group in\nterms of digging into ambiguity because\nthe thing is Zeal is polite right like\nzella's like I don't want to monopolize\nthe time\nand at the same time digging into that\nkind of stuff maybe he's got a strategy\nmaybe we can together piece together\ndifferent kinds of strategy because work\nlife balance or balancing different\nthings seems very important to people in\nthe group\nright so it sounds like it's an\nimportant discussion so what I'd like to\nI'd love to do is for you all to be able\nto dig into ambiguity and as Ruby sort\nof mentioned we can just ask about it\nso does anyone have an idea if I wanted\nto dig into the ambiguity of metric sort\nof in the appearance issue what could\nhow could I do that practically\nI mean you have to you\nwho's hell you go oh I mean yeah it's\nall you go okay uh I was thinking you\nwould ask them to expand on exactly what\nthey meant yeah so you want to give that\na shot\nokay\ninstead of okay let's do it go for it as\nhell so yeah in this example then metric\nI would ask you you know what asked to\nask you know you told\nokay I am in the moment okay so I'm\nasking you uh\nuh when you said that people who stream\ndidn't look like you what did what\nexactly did you mean like physically or\nlike you know could you maybe physically\nit's just that I I in from like I joined\nTwitch in I think 2016\num and\nI spent a lot of time checking out tons\nof streams and I didn't see a lot of\nbrown people\num I don't still to this day I don't\nwhen I find one it's like finding your\nUnicorn it's like finding a happy\ndelivery person delivery people not\nhappy\nyou ever find one they're just not happy\nyou find one you hold on to that but\num Dr K like this is the first time I've\never shared\na a screen with another brown person\nit's like\nmy mom when I talked to her about this\nstream she's like no one's going to be\nracist to you are they I'm like well I\nmean the host is brown so\nI think probably not you know it's his\nchannel and I I'm gonna use him as a\nshield he'll protect me but\num I I to this day I don't see a lot of\nuh Brown streamers\num I see even less brown Partners I know\nof like maybe a handful uh\nand it makes me sad\num and it's not just to say that like oh\num\nyou know I'm Brown you should watch me\nthat's definitely not it it's you know\nputting something forward\nthat people want to watch uh I just\nwonder if I would be more successful if\nI didn't have a face cam I think about\nthat all the time\num\nthat if people didn't know\nso\nyou know\nthat's that's what I mean\nso awesome\nthank you for sharing that like yeah how\ndo people feel right now\nsad\nyeah it's never it's never like\nuh enlightening when like\nthe scale of rep of like diversity and\nrepresentation is not as great as it\ncould or\nshould be\nand it also uh I guess reaffirms the\num the drive for me to uplift you know\nother voices not just you know people\nthat are like me but also the other\npeople around me too\nyeah the the part about your mum\nyou know she's always having to think\nabout protecting you in that way yeah\nyou know and um\nand it just yeah it's I appreciate you\nsharing so that I can listen and just\nunderstand from your point of view and\nyeah\njust help in any way that I can\nhow do you feel metric\num I've felt good sharing that terrified\nto even say it in front of so many\npeople because it\nfeels like you know\noh he's bringing up race uh\nbecause\nI'm I don't like talking about it you\nyou tend to get\nshouted down a lot when you say anything\nabout it even if it's your lived\nexperience\nso\nyeah\nand so let's just circle back to a\ncouple things then we'll talk more about\nthis\nbut\ngood job Zell\nright so I don't know if you all\nremember but Zell asked like a really\nnice question\nand look at what's happened\nright so like metric walks around\nevery single day\nwith this thought like I'm an outsider\nright and and that's something that I\nnoticed too I made another observation I\nhope this is okay please let me know if\nthis makes anyone else uncomfortable but\nI noticed that brown people are\nunderrepresented in the streaming\ncommunity and also in pornography\nyou know it's kind of like a weird\nobservation but I just like notice that\nI'm not trying to hopefully that makes\nit was just like because we don't talk\nabout that kind of stuff\nand I'm kind of curious as anyone else\nfeel like an outsider in the streaming\ncommunity\nyeah I mean\nit's it's weird because I think like\nI think when it comes to like the\nbiggest streamers right like I think the\nvast majority of them are white or Asian\nso like as another you know East Asian\ndescent person like it feels weird a bit\nto kind of like conflate my issues on\nthis one but I think like\num\nI mean I think just in general in\nrepresentation overall right like\nespecially for like just speaking on my\nown experience as an Asian dude like\ngrowing up I I grew up in the Midwest\nand so uh and I'm old so like back then\nit was like there are no Asian actors\nexcept Jackie Chan and then when Ken\nJohn came into the scene which uh which\nlike act are you oh you're Ken Jong it\nwas like you know there were there was\nno\nthere was nothing that people could\nrelate you to because representation\njust literally didn't exist right and\nlike the amount of times that I've been\ntold that I am just the you know biggest\nlike you know the Jackie Chan's the\nBruce Lee's the you know like the the\nsymbols of age and like I think it\nwasn't until even even more recently in\nterms of like beauty standards too for\nAsian dudes like you know\nhow is it how frequently do you ever see\nan Asian male Asian actor ever kiss\nsomebody on screen uh in movies or\nwhatever right so like\num so I think that I totally empathize\nwith you there that like there is the\nsense of like well\nyeah no one has any sort of\nunderstanding of who I am and what like\nI could even be related to because\nyou've never even seen it you know like\nuh so like I yeah I guess I understand\nWestern beauty standards made me feel\nlike constantly ugly and the other thing\nis people come to my stream and say like\ndid you know you look like calpen or\nthat guy from Big Bang Theory or\nyou know it's like dude I don't look\nlike any of those people\nI I don't like I I am coincidentally\nBrown at the same time as they are it\nthat's it\nand and then to be to be told that I\nlook like another actor or something who\nis brown but does not look like me at\nall like nothing like me\num\nit's like I'm sorry you only know of one\nfamous brown person that's that's good\nfor you and\nthe the other thing that that I always\nfound funny about Brown representation\nin say Hollywood or whatever is that\nthey're always like the joke character\num like the the goofy like sidekick\ncharacter that you're not supposed to\ntake seriously and as probably also like\nwhat's the word sexually non-threatening\nlike you don't see them ever like being\nthe\nyou know main romance point or anything\nlike that so\nyeah\nI also want to I'm curious if other\npeople resonated with this when Zell\nsaid\nso like kind of you know appreciating\nand I really commend zel for sort of\nsharing this that here's metric talking\nabout being Brown when in streaming\nthere's a bunch of Caucasian people East\nAsian people and he's like wait I'm an\nEast Asian person too but I feel like an\noutsider\nand so I'm curious does anyone else sort\nof resonate with this idea that I feel a\nparticular way but I'm not allowed to\nlike did you all get that from Zell a\nlittle bit that he's like I'm not really\nallowed to complain because I'm East\nAsian\nright I I was sort of picking that up\nI'm curious if anyone else sort of felt\nthat\nso does that resonate with you like\nyeah I mean I definitely you know like\nwas kind of uh\nI don't know what the proper word here\nis like uh implying that yes right so\nI'm curious do other people feel like\nthere's a struggle that they have which\nthey're not allowed to have\nyeah\nI mean I'm seeing stuff in chat like\nfirst world problems and why are we\ndemonizing the west and stuff and it's\nlike\nyou're not you're not allowed to\ncriticize it like it exists it's not\nperfect but you can\neveryone's got problems with it you can\nbe as white as white can be you can\nstill have problems with it like\nno\nso\nI'm curious so somebody else said yeah\ntoo right\nbut mine just feels like so trivial\ncompared to no that's why\nuh yeah I'm calling you out\nso I'm being honest with you\nDr K originally asked if you feel out of\nplace in the streaming like on Twitch\nand stuff so\nI have had a lot of pressure when I\nstarted doing the content that I do now\nto not do the content I do now\nto\nI had pressure to do more gaming\num because I could get more sponsors I\ncan you can get into parties you can get\nmore sponsorships you can get free stuff\nfrom like companies like\noh why don't you do like a couple of\ngaming streams a week because then you\ncan be involved in all this twitch stuff\nbecause I'm not\ntraditionally twitch you know I'm not\nwhat people think of with twitch you\ndon't\nand I'm not traditionally what people\nexpect in the ASMR category either\nI'm\non my own and it's it's taken me a long\ntime and actually I've had coaching with\none of Dr K's coaches for\num\nabout a year I did\num I think I was one of your first\num people and uh\nit took it took a long time and and it\nwas still after I finished my coaching\nthat I was like okay\nthis is my superpower not being like\nanyone else\nand sticking to what I I want to do but\nthen every now and then there'll be\nsomething like twitchcon\num which I was made an ambassador this\nyear\num\nwhich kind of like affirmed that stick\nto the thing that is you kind of thing\nit kind of like affirmed all of that to\nme\num but still going to twitchcon nothing\nfelt like it was for me and\num\nyou know nothing not that I want the\nevent to be revolved around me like I'm\njust one person there's loads of people\nthere that do gaming but it it can make\nyou feel very outsidery you know\num\nand\nas someone who's neurodivergent as well\nI suddenly realize why I hate parties\num I enjoy fun I enjoy gatherings I\nenjoy friends I enjoy people\nI just really struggle with events and\nsocializing and\nand\num\nand just lots of noise and people and\num which makes sense as to I only got\ndiagnosed last year so it makes sense as\nto why I've ended up where I am kind of\nin life\num\nso yeah that's how I kind of feel\noutside of Twitch in general is it okay\nif I ask Ruby a question\num so in in your category of streaming\num do you feel like\nyou\num you feel like an outsider because you\nmight be written off as like some people\nwrite off women who do what you do as\nlike being an e-girl or something like\nthat do you have to fight off that kind\nof thing\nI have a lot of trouble with this\n[Music]\num\nnot because I'm against anyone else\ndoing what they want to do and what they\nare doing\nit's the assumptions that everyone is\nthe same which people shouldn't be doing\nto anyone in that category full stop\neach Creator is their own Creator they\nshouldn't be assuming that anyone's\ndoing\nanything\num and then I get a lot of I get treated\nthat I'm like I'm acting like I'm not\nlike the other girls\num by other people in my chat so you\nknow the whole I'm not like the other\ngirls kind of thing\num\npeople come and be like it's so good to\nfinally find someone not showing\ncleavage and licking a microphone oh and\nlike they instantly get timed out by my\nmods so I don't allow like we're not\ngoing to talk about other people in my\nchat you either come in and you join in\nwith my content we're not there to bash\nanyone we're not there to bring anyone\ndown that's like against everything that\nI do\num\nand so they'll get a little time out and\nmy mods will say well you're here now\nand enjoy this we don't need to bring\nanyone else down and we're not having\nthat discussion but people will try and\npoke that discussion out of me\num about ASMR and what ASMR is and at\nthe end of the day my answer is\neverything will be made sexual and\neverything in life\ncan be made sexual like\nfrom Car Sales they can make that sexy\nlike to football you know they used to\nhave women painted up on the the pitch\nin England and stuff and like if\nsomething's not sexy it can be made sexy\neverything can be sexual like it's ASMR\nand like that kind of stuff is like\nmusic to me you can't just listen to One\ngenre of music one song and be like oh I\nhate music\nevery ASMR Creator is different and\neveryone's doing it their own way\nthey're making sounds they're creating\ncontent in their own way but yeah as an\nASMR like I stream in the ASMR category\ndoing meditation and stuff because I\ndon't know where else to go and it\nbrings in the most viewers because most\npeople are looking to relax a lot of\npeople are in that category because they\ndo have anxiety because they're looking\nfor\num yeah they're just looking for that\nkind of content so yeah\nsorry if I went on a bit long\nbe sorry\nit's very insightful\nso yeah that's\nthat's I feel\nso metric how did it feel to ask a\nquestion\nI mean she went in depth and I found it\nexactly what I wanted to know so\num\nI'm glad I asked it cool so so\num I don't know if you all realize this\nbut we've been doing this for about 70\nminutes\ndoes it\nbias yeah\ninteresting right how do y'all\nunderstand that\nI mean\nI mean TBH like if I'm going to be\ncompletely honest like going into this\nwithout a lot of info and not knowing\neverybody I think a lot of it is just\ntied to Pure nervousness and like I you\nknow I'm I'm sitting here listening my\nbest but also at the same time my heart\nand my brain are going like\nwhat are what is what is the expectation\nhere what is the expectation among the\nother people what do they want to hear\nwhat do they expect me to say what does\nDr K want to say what do you think his\nchat will think of us like you know like\nI'm I'm in the moment but I also I'm\nalso like racing on the racetrack right\nnow at the same time so the time flying\nby makes sense to me because my brain's\nlike going nuts here right so uh you\nknow anytime there's like a a split\nsilence I'm like\nlike what's the expectation is that is\nthat should I be feeling that should I\nspeak up like uh you know like hey uh\nZirk girl I notice you're a little on\nthe quiet side like should I should I\ntry to get you in somehow like should I\ntry but is it weird if I'm the\nfacilitator Now isn't that Dr K's job is\nit weird if I step up to do you know\nlike I've been reading that's like what\nMarine brain does I literally finished\nspeaking and went in my head did I say\nthe right thing is that what I was meant\nto say\nsounds like we got a lot of overthinkers\nin this group yeah oh really no never\nnever no twitch streamers would never\noverthink anything never and I think\nlike it gets worse here because we have\nsix people in the call so only one\nperson can get their words out so the\nrest of us are busy digging in their\nbrains so you know like I feel it yeah\nanyone else so so Zell thank you for\nsharing\num let me think about whether this is a\ntime that I should step in or step back\num I mean I think we all want to pull\ntheir girl in\nis this\nI think I believe we would all like to\nwe just don't know how\nso how how does it feel to hear that sir\ngirl\nI'm down\nI'm Dodge talk I was just kind of\nsitting here taking in what everyone's\nsaying\num I guess in terms of feeling\nostracized or kind of lonely or set\napart uh even as a competitive gamer I\nfeel like I'm alone sometimes but I\nthink it's a little bit unique because\nuh Starcraft used to be super popular\nback then nowadays when I go to events\num yeah there's other Gamers and\nstreamers there but they don't they've\nheard of Starcraft they haven't really\nplayed it so it's kind of hard to\nconnect with people uh you know\nsometimes I'm like oh yeah let's follow\neach other's channels let's like play\ngames together it's really [ __ ] hard\nto teach Starcraft to someone like\nsometimes they come into my channel they\ndon't know what the game's about and\nthey're like I'm dizzy what's going on\nlike and then I'm just like or I miss\nlike something that they were saying so\nit kind of adds I can understand the\nloneliness part of it because it's like\noh I it'd be awesome if I could meet\nother\npeople who stream under my category and\nsometimes I'm like maybe I should try\nout League of Legends or valorin or\nfortnite\nand then I just go back to Starcraft\nso\nyeah I kind of understand the loneliness\naspect of that\nyeah me too except just from an\nunsaturated directory that is Toontown\nwhere sometimes no one is streaming\nsometimes 20 people are streaming uh you\nknow when I want to like\nuh\nyou know uh get involved with more\nthings it's like\nI'm not doing the same thing that\neveryone else is doing so there are only\nso many things I could possibly like\nyou know throw my hat in the rain for uh\nso I I can emphasize with that from that\nperspective\nyeah I do I have some friends who are\nDie Hard 210 online fans and I have to\nsend them their way\nplease do\nwe we were streaming to in Town Front\nPage yesterday so very much still on the\nuh\non the list of on my repertoire of being\ndead sorry girl I'm curious what was\nbehind the question\ndo you have a sense\nuh because\nToontown is a very old game older than\nStarcraft so I was like oh I wanted to\nget this idea because even if if\nStarcraft is older we still kind of have\na community we have tournaments going on\noffline online\nso yeah I just wanted to kind of compare\nlike the level\nright yeah it's very\nyeah it's very like small but also\ntight-knit like there's you know I\nalways see like a good amount of people\nrepeatedly within the little Toontown\ncommunity that we have\num and uh it's nice to always see those\npeople again for sure\nI'm curious for\num metric Zell and Ruby\nI I'm wondering if y'all are feeling\nlike this is the beginning of a\nconversation\nthere's something about Starcraft and\nToontown\ndo y'all are y'all kind of feeling that\nlike what what do you what do you think\ncould be going on in is there a girl's\nhead like why is she inquiring about\nToontown like where could this\nconversation go\nnetworking no\num\nuh\nI don't know I mean they feel they feel\nkind of similar like what feels similar\nWhat feelings they're both having good\nlike about\nabout their situations and what about\nthe game they play and what are the\nfeelings that y'all are noticing\nwhat what's the Resonance of the\nwavelength here\nthe sense of isolation yeah yeah in the\ncontent that you create\num and\nyeah like it's like smaller communities\nor at least trying to like Foster and\nmaintain those communities\num\nyeah yeah I I think this is probably\njust you know there's a lot of empathy\nhere in the similar sort of situation\nwith the games with like\nI mean as somebody who loves uh Super\nSmash Brothers Melee it's it's like a\nsuper Niche game from you know 20 years\nago it's old enough to drive if it was a\nperson but like you know just this idea\nthat you could be doing something that's\nmore worthwhile like something that's\nflavor of the month and like there's\nalways that tension of like do I do this\nthing that is Niche uh but is like a big\npart of who I am or do I go after\nsomething that I know does really well\nand then on top of that it's also that\nlike we're people we're multifaceted\nit's not like you know maybe you have\nstreamed StarCraft all your life you've\nstreamed Toontown all your life you know\nwhatever but that's not all you are\nright it's not like that's the only\nthing you've been interested in and so\nlike also collating that with you know\nyour other interests like it's tough as\na streamer to have to make that decision\nand I think that's the kind of\nempathizing point that I feel like we're\nuh we're starting to hear a little bit\nwhat do y'all think uh is there a girl\nand and smirky is is Zell metric or Ruby\nare they on on on the pulse of it they\nI think so absolutely yeah so I'm I'm\ngonna make a slightly metric you wanted\nto say something\nno it's agreeing yeah yeah so like look\nat that right so the first thing I want\nto point out is like how cool is that\nthat with just one question and a little\nbit of back and forth\nwe can see so much of what these people\nare feeling\nand so now I'm going to make a\nhyperbolic statement which is supposed\nto be kind of almost emotionally\nengaging\nwhat do I do if I'm a streamer and my\nNiche is a game that's dying\nthat's something I had to that question\nwas running in my head when Disney was\nsunny downtown uh we had like a month's\nnotice and that entire month I was like\nit's like two times your entire brand\nnow what do you do what do you like how\nare you supposed to like you know\nbecause it's like you worry about your\naudience you worry about like the\ncommunity itself like what's going to\nhappen uh it those were definitely\ntumultuous times but it kind of happened\nto me too when when dark is dungeon 2\nwas released in Early Access because the\nhype for that was huge but at the same\ntime that game is practically dead on on\nTwitch half the time because it's\nwaiting for Content updates and it's\nhard to play it right now when it's only\nhalf done\num and to that end it actually killed a\nlot of the hype around the first game so\nit's like\nyou can't do any of it really and be as\nsuccessful as you were before\nso now I gotta go looking for other\nthings I don't want them to be exactly\nsuper similar because I already did the\nsame thing for 3 000 Plus hours so\nabsolutely yeah right\nso I just want to call attention to the\namount of time we've got we've got about\n10 minutes left\num with the group's permission I'd like\nto take an opportunity to try to\nsummarize today\nand also maybe do a little bit of\nteaching\nis that okay\nso normally I think I may teach a little\nbit more I may ask for a little bit more\ntime towards the end but y'all were\ndoing just such an awesome job of like\nopening things up inquiring resonating\nwith each other that I you know I just\nlike gotta let it gotta let it keep\ngoing\neveryone was vibing I think it was good\nso the first thing is that I want to\nthank everyone for being here today\num\nI I want to also acknowledge the\nawkwardness of it right so part of the\ngroup experience I know it's tough but\nlike part of the group experience is\nkind of sink or swim\nand this is the kind of thing where like\nI was also tracking participation\nand you know I'm paying attention to\nwho's talking who's not talking\nand I really appreciate that y'all\nlifted that with me\nso we were all noticing right so like\nand this is where like Zerg girl was a\nlittle bit quieter but she's also like\ngiving other people space\nright because people have stuff to say\nand so like we want to give people space\nwhen they have something to share\nand like in the process of giving people\nspace and because silence is awkward\nso if we want Zara girl and Ruby to\nparticipate more we've got to figure out\nwhat's our like silence threshold here\nbecause us people that like can't handle\nit like you know we're gonna dominate\nthe conversation unless we can learn to\nhandle it and also what would our lives\nbe like if we could tolerate silence\nyou know like what would that be like if\nyou could just be patient\nso I think a lot of today is just about\nthis is the tutorial basically right\nwe're like not really sure how to play\nthis game I also want to acknowledge\nwhat Zell was saying that y'all are you\nknow content creators so it's very hard\nfor us to be fully present because we're\nthinking about\nyou know what does twitch chat think\nlike are we doing it right are we doing\nit wrong like and that's where like\ny'all are doing it right but doing it\nright actually means not knowing how to\ndo it and this is act I would probably\nsorry I would say that silence is\nterrifying as far as being a content\ncreator because\ndead air typically in in most streamers\nlives is\nno like you want to run away from that\nnot not not always not you're right not\nlike it's like you press you press go\nlive and you're waiting for someone to\npop up in chat just like hey how you\ndoing and then and then you just you got\nsomebody to talk to at least right so\nbut what when if it's just this group\nnot being streamed I think silence isn't\nas scary for me\nbut knowing that like\nso many people are watching and nobody's\ntalking that's\nthat's like multiplied tenfold then like\nif I was just streaming by myself yeah\nso\nSee You in My Stream if my chat's gone\nquiet\nI just assumed they're all chilling like\nI have people come in that are new\nthey're like yo hey and they're like why\nare you so quiet there's 400 people here\nwhy chat dead and the mother be like\nmiddle of a sound bath we're meditating\nand then they'll put some little like\nemotes in a few people pop up and be\nlike and then it'd be quiet again and\nbut it took that yeah it took me a while\nto learn that that's okay so I'm\nnoticing that metric has been\nconditioned\nright this is conditioning\nyeah I have to engage at all so this is\none of the challenges of being a\nstreamer is streaming conditions you to\nbehave a certain way and then part of\nthe challenge of being a streamer we'll\nget to this is that then then that\nconditioning spills over into other\nparts of your life\nbecause the way that streaming shapes\nyour brain you carry that brain with you\neverywhere you go into your\ninterpersonal relationships into your\nromantic relationships into you know\nbeing on for your friends and now you're\na streamer and that's how people\nidentify you and what kind of judgment\ndoes that come with Etc so there's a\nbunch of stuff that gets Tangled in so\nmy hope is that we can explore this kind\nof Silence thing I think we're going to\nhave to figure it out as a group we're\nnot saying that metric has to become\nfully comfortable with it but he's got\nto be able to tolerate it to give people\nspace to you know step in so we're gonna\nwe're gonna focus on that a little bit\nbut I think today was the tutorial y'all\nall did an awesome job it's gonna be\nawkward it's gonna continue to be\nawkward but that's actually the point\nbecause I want you all to appreciate for\na second or think about\nwe Retreat from awkwardness\nand when we Retreat from awkwardness we\nactually like it impairs our growth a\nlittle bit right if we think a little\nbit about our comfort zone\nand like extending our comfort zone out\ninto becoming comfortable with more\nthings there's that barrier of comfort\nbetween comfort and uncomfortable where\nlike it's kind of awkward\nso we're gonna like figure this out\nbecause this is a weird situ people\ndon't talk like this you don't meet\nsomeone for an hour and people are like\nyeah like you know I feel racially\nisolated I feel like you know the game\nthat I'm in is dying and now I don't\nknow if I should variety stream and then\nlike but there's a lot of common themes\nhere right because and Ruby's like okay\nI'm gonna do ASMR and that's my Niche\nand that's like my journey and like it\nwent really well and and now I'm an\nambassador for twitchcon and that now\nit's like you know I'm wondering if if\nsmirk is kind of thinking well if I keep\non sweeping streaming Toontown will I be\nan ambassador for twitchcon one day like\nwho knows right what's the right answer\nand so what I'm going to kind of leave\nyou all with because I don't have too\nmuch time for a summary which is totally\nfine is I think next week what I am\ngoing to\nsuggest we talk about but if we go off\ntrack that's totally fine\nthe one theme that I heard today that I\nthought was kind of dominant I mean\nthere's a lot actually that were\ndominant but like is this idea of\nmetrics and numbers and making the\ncontent that you want to or selling out\ndo I change games do I become a niche do\nI start becoming a variety streamer what\ndo I do when my game isn't working do I\nlean into like do I become a content\ncreator am I an artiste\nwho isn't going to you know give in\nto the changes\nand if I switch over to law\nno offense to all\nyou know or valorant or Apex or whatever\npeople are playing GTA role play\nyou know do I need to do that like like\nand what does it mean to be a streamer\ndo I chase the numbers how much do I\nchase the numbers\nyou know so here's what my experience\nhas been\nas both a content creator and having\nworked with other content creators\nso this is like where the teaching comes\nin so it's our belief at healthy gamer\nwe may be wrong here and let's be fair\nwe're not the most successful in terms\nof content creation right so we're not\nlike the biggest content creators on the\nplanet but it's my belief that the best\ncontent comes out of like an authentic\ndesire to make something\nwhen you're like your authentic creative\nself\nand when you kind of\ntake that authenticity\nand then play the metrics game that's\nwhen you become the most successful\nso it's not sacrificing yourself and\nselling out for the sake of metrics but\nit's also like we got to be honest here\nas being content creators we can't just\nshow up and make art and ignore all the\nnumbers ignore all the trends and things\nlike that it's all about and I think you\nall have also brought this up a lot\nabout balance\nright so how do you access those parts\nof yourself\nthat are you know authentic and and this\nis where you know I'm kind of thinking\nabout Starcraft because I love Starcraft\nStarcraft is the reason that I almost\nfailed out of college I love the game\nso I played it a ton and there's a part\nof me that's so grateful that Zerg girl\nstill plays Starcraft\nbecause like I love RTS like where is\nRTS in the gaming world now\nit's an amazing genre\nbut then like how do you microtransact\nRTS\nlike we don't know how to do that so\npeople don't make RTS games anymore\nyou can't make RTS pay to win no one\nwould play\nand if it weren't for people like Zara\ngirl or I mean I'm not particularly\nfamiliar with Toontown or whatever but\nlike you know how do you how like how do\nyou keep this like circles keeping it\nalive\nyou know so how do you balance these\nthings how do you balance who you are as\na Creator what you want to build in life\nwith the metrics with the job\nyou know with the like okay what do I do\nlike how do you figure out what this\nbalance is\nhow do you invent yourself or reinvent\nyourself or stay true to who you are\nbecause here's the one thing that I'll\nsay about content creation what makes\ncontent creation different from all\nthese other forms of entertainment is\nthe authenticity\nwhen you watch a movie it's crafted it's\nedited there's makeup there's this\nthere's this it's like processed\nwhen you watch TV it's processed we even\nhave reality TV which pretends to be\nauthentic right but I don't know if you\nall have heard of like you know people\nwho've been on reality TV shows and how\nactually like artificially inflated it\nis\nyeah but what y'all are\nis authentic\ny'all don't have the production budget\nto be fake\nright\nI mean literally my roommates are like\nstanding behind my setup trying to get\nme to laugh just a moment right like I I\ncan't I can't try to I can't fake that\nand so the reason that that content\ncreation of this kind is growing is\nbecause I think there's an appetite out\nthere for like authenticity\nand when I think about you know you guys\nyou all think about y'all y'all's\ncommunity\nand I think the P the reason that you\nall have the community that you have is\nbecause of your authenticity it's\nbecause you know you got to play the\ngame of Trends a little bit\nso next week what I'd love to do is is\nkind of dive into that because I think\nthat's a lot of the essence of being a\ncontent creator is the struggle between\nyou know what do I what kind of content\ndo I make\nand and talking a little bit about\nbalance how does that feel as a topic\nsounds great yeah cool\num\nI had something else but I forgot\nyeah I'm blanket oh yeah and just that's\nhow you know it's not scripted so so\nDell was saying like am I supposed to\ntalk am I not supposed to talk honestly\njust to share this with you all I wasn't\nsure either\nbecause it's like you know honestly\ny'all kind of threw me off because y'all\ndid outperformed what I was expecting\nin terms of authenticity picking things\nup like I usually I have to like I'm\npulling the wagon but y'all were just\nlike pushing it from behind so it's\nactually like kind of easy like I didn't\nhave to mention participation people\nnoticed it on their own y'all didn't let\neach other get away with it you know\nlike Ruby like like I said at the very\nbeginning I'm like does anyone have\nquestions first time I can think of\nwhere someone's actually asked a\nquestion\nand so it's it's that energy that y'all\nare bringing to the table and when Zell\nis talking about the parallel thought\nprocess by the way I don't know what\nelse to call it this is something we're\ngoing to talk about as well right was is\na content creator it's actually hard to\nbe present because you've got the\nmetrics running above\nyou're there creating content but you're\nalways kind of wondering and then we\neven figure out some tricks like Ruby\ndoes which is like I'm going to turn off\nthe viewer account\nbecause I want to be present\nand so now it's like you're struggling\nbecause the most present the most\nauthentic is when you make the best\ncontent\nbut you also want to know what gets\nviewers to stay and what gets viewers to\nleave\nbecause that's how you grow\nand how do we balance growth and\nauthenticity how do we balance making\nthe content that we want to and if\nyou're a partner and like you know\ngetting paid because like it's hard to\nhave a job\nand create content\nso sometimes I'll assign homework\nnothing's really popping for me right\nnow do people want homework\nvalidate me I just yeah that's how do\npeople feel\nother people I'll take optional homework\nokay\nif my modes are watching can you please\nwrite homework down so so it's not it's\nnot gonna be like you know write an\nessay about\nmoral themes in Dostoevsky so so I just\nwant you all to think a little bit about\nso let's pick one of two things so we're\ngoing to focus on balance but we're\ngonna I'm gonna give you all a choice\nokay the first is balancing like work\nstuff with life stuff\nand the second sorry streaming stuff\nwith like non-streaming stuff so that\ncould be work it could be life it could\nbe personal relationships and this is\nthe direction that the group wants to go\nin versus balancing like authenticity\nversus metrics\nand like creating content for the sake\nof like passion and love versus like\nthis whole like well at this point it's\nbecome a nine to five and the whole\nreason I became a streamer is because I\ndidn't want a job where I have to wake\nup every day and do the same damn thing\nso what resonates with y'all more\n[Music]\nuh I like the second one more because\ngaming is mostly my life so\nI've forgotten by the time you finish\nI was that's why I was laughing I was\nlike okay GG\nthe first one was so like basically\nstreaming non-streaming balance and the\nsecond was like authenticity versus\nmetrics\nthe second one\nyeah the second one we I mean and we can\nwe can always touch on both these topics\nif we really want to throughout oh yeah\nwe'll get to both things right so I mean\nyeah so I'm totally down to do the\nauthenticity side of it because I always\nI always say like I preach authenticity\nlike we're an authentic Community but\nlike it's also gonna like talk about it\nwith others and really pinpoint what\nthat means okay so Zales are girl you\nall have opinions\nuh I'm gonna go against the mold and the\nfirst one I resonate with more but that\nsaid they both have things that I you\nknow relate to so I'm also down and if\nwe're gonna get to both then I'd you\nknow defer to the group on which we hit\nfirst\nit's our girl huh\nokay so I'll start well this is this is\nthe homework okay it's gonna be simple\nso you guys could write an essay if you\nwant to you can think about it in the\nshower if you want to you can do\nwhatever you want but what's the cost\nof authenticity\nand what's the cost of playing the\nmetrics\ndoes that feel okay in terms of homework\nwe'll start yeah awesome\nso just before we wrap up uh I'd love to\njust get feedback from y'all if you guys\nwant to share kind of initial\nImpressions questions whatever give you\nall sort of a a chance like no no more\nsubstantive discussion okay but just\nlike admit like you know how did y'all\nfeel this went or if you guys have any\nquestions or anything like that and\nlastly if you all want to take a moment\nto tell everyone who's watching where\nthey can find you once again\nuh quick question uh is because we have\nanother participant who couldn't make it\nto this so are they going to introduce\nthemselves at the start of the next\nsession what do y'all think\nonly there\nI would think so yeah right yeah yeah I\nI I would think so I just I I just\nwanted to make sure good for you for\nlooking out for the other people yeah I\nwasn't my plan that if you missed\nsession one you never get to introduce\nyourself and we have to just guess what\nyour name is it's just this Randomness\nit shows up with\nit was on my mind okay good question no\nit shows that you're looking out for\nmembers in the group even if they're not\nthere\nhe's a good egg\nI'm gonna be honest like feedback wise I\nlike can't even wrap my head around it\nbecause like you know we talked about\nkind of our goals here but it also feels\nlike the discussions don't necessarily\nhave a specific goal we're kind of like\ndeveloping it as we go and so my brain\nbecause I'm very like I like having my\nobjectives in front of me it's very hard\nfor me to think of like proper feedback\nover you know\nover this thing that doesn't have like a\nspecific directive behind it and so I'm\nlike is it going well I hope it's going\nwell because I feel really awkward I\nit's hard you know it's hard for me to\nthink about what I want to say uh and I\nand how to like handle group dynamics\nand all this stuff so it's like it's a\nlot to handle personally and and so it's\nhard for me to even save this is going\nwell or not for me because I also don't\nknow the specific directive like I said\nbefore so I mean I'm just I'm vibing I\nguess and uh I mean I'm excited to see\nwhere this ends up going because like\nit's hard for me in the moment to\nunderstand like where are we going great\nquestion so so Zell first of all\ntop-notch feedback bro seriously right\nso Zell shared with us what his like\nhe's like what on Earth are we doing\nhere so I'd love to because you like\nobjectives we're gonna we're gonna bail\nyou out a little bit okay\nso here's been my experience working\nwith people\nthere's a couple different ways you can\nhelp people one is you show up and you\nsay hey by the way here's an eight-week\ncurriculum I've never met any y'all\nbefore but I have all the answers\nand I'm going to give you this on week\none and it's going to help you and it's\ngoing to give you this on week two and\nthis on week three this on week four\nbut in my experience that actually does\nnot help people very much because\nthere's no individuality of it now you\ncan organize a class that way but the\nwhole point of the group coaching\nexperience is that it doesn't have to be\na class so we have opportunities\navailable which we don't need a\ncurriculum that goes from week one to\nweek eight now that makes people really\nconfused and very uncomfortable because\nthat's not how School Works we're\nconditioned to be told what we need to\ndo to improve\nbut the whole point of that\nI was about to say though but that's how\nmy brain works the way like this\nconversation that we've all had today is\nfine yeah me like so so they're\ndefinitely different people the open\nformat is more comfortable for some\npeople and some people are more\norganized right mechanical engineering\ndegree makes sense\nand and also the other thing that I'm\ngoing to share with you Zell is just a\nkind of hypothesis is that oftentimes\nwhen people come in with a problem\nthat's actually not the problem\nso there's this concept that I think\noriginally sort of came out from Carl\nJung where he talked he said that in our\npsychology we have this part of our\npsychology called The Shadow\nand the shadow is the part of our\npsychology that we're not really aware\nof it's the stuff that we suppress\nand so by definition all of our problems\ncome from the Shadow or most of our\nproblems come from the Shadow and the\nreason they come from the shadow is\nbecause the stuff that we're aware of\nis the stuff that we know how to fix\nit's the stuff that we're unaware of\nthat we we haven't addressed right\nbecause we're not aware of it we don't\nrealize it's a problem\nso the challenge there is that if I'm if\nI can see 180 degrees in front of me\nand I'm running into trouble and I'm I'm\nnot aware that there's anyone behind me\nor anything behind me then I'm going to\nnaturally say hi I need help with this\nthing in front of me this thing in front\nof me this thing in front of me this\nthing in front of me\nbut what I don't realize is that most of\nmy problems are actually the stuff that\nI've never considered or am unaware of\nthat's the other reason why the open\nformat actually works really well\nbecause you can come in and say I\nstruggle with this I struggle with this\nI struggle with this but here's the\nthing all we all are successful content\ncreators all of y'all are good at what\nyou do all of y'all can optimize all of\nyou all have success in your past and\nhopefully in your future\nand so if we really want to deliver the\nmost value to you\nthe exploration comes before\nright so in medicine we say good\ndiagnosis precedes good treatment I'm\nnot going to give you all the treatment\nI'm not going to give you any treatment\ntechnically but you know we're not going\nto give you the answers on week one and\nI think it's actually arrogant to assume\nthat we would and like I said I've got a\ncurriculum prepared and you know a lot\nof it's similar\nbut this is where I know it's going to\nbe unusual for you Zell which is totally\nfine right and we're going to help you\nbecome more comfortable\nbut that's part of the reason that we do\nit this way because you may be surprised\nat what's holding you back\nyou may be surprised you may think like\noh like do I do the metrics or you know\nI'm known for this or stuff like that\nand like there may be a lot of core\nstuff here I mean I remembered a couple\nof things that kind of jumped out to me\nthat were sort of like you know what's\ngoing on with this person\nand like who are you because when it\ncomes to like you know what's the right\nchoice\ndo I do this or do I do this\nthere's not like a right choice and a\nwrong choice the choice depends on you\nso we have to start by understanding Who\nYou Are\nright\nso I'll give you all just one simple\nexample of this so we talked about the\ntheme of loneliness\nand this is the kind of thing where if\nyou're lonely and you're making content\nto fix your loneliness\nwhat kind of content would you make\nversus if you learn how to no longer be\nlonely you deal with that loneliness in\nhere what kind of content can you make\nit's kind of a weird abstract question\nright\nI don't know if it makes sense to people\nor not may just be a bad question but\nthat's where like what we want to do as\ncontent creators is we want to like\nlearn about ourselves we want to like\nyou know grow as people and then we want\nto be free from all of our negativity\nwhen we make content\nand so it's going to be a little bit\nweird\nI don't really know where it's going\nbut what I do know is I've done this\ntime and time and time again and it\ntends to work really really really well\nis that enough structure for you Zell\nI think that makes sense okay other\nfeedback\ndots\nuh from a technical standpoint\num I know I was told not to look at chat\nI'm sorry but I looked at chat uh there\nwere there were some people who said\nthat they weren't sure who was who\nand so like maybe in the next streams we\ncould have like\nlabels or whatever on everyone's\num camera and\nsome people are asking for links in the\nuh stream or the guest command or\nwhatever so yeah so why don't we take\nthis opportunity for you all to just re\nintro just tell people where they can\nfind you and what kind of streaming you\ndo\nright so for people who missed the\nbeginning\num oh yeah so I can respond to somebody\nthere uh so yeah my name is not pink\nhair guy but uh it's it's metric seconds\neveryone calls me metric\num I stream at twitch.tv metricseconds\num oh my God look at that
