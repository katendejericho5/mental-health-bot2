    "transcript": "you can't be short without someone else\nbeing tall you can't be tall without\nsomeone else being short\nyou can't be smart without someone else\nbeing stupid you can't be stupid without\nsomeone else being smart so i didn't do\nenough in adolescence how do i catch up\nso hey i'm a 19 year old male from\neurope i recently graduated high school\nand am now finding it hard to deal with\nthe fact that i'm no longer in the stage\nof life where i have a ton of free time\nto explore new things while not having\nto worry about the consequences\nthe future or my own welfare while being\nsurrounded by peers with the same\ncircumstances\ni know that no one likes their life\nfigured out\nno one has their life figured out at my\nage but what i do know is that my\nfriends were spending much of their time\nout there trying new hobbies learning\nuseful skills for their future lives and\ncareers\nand finding romantic partners and\nfriends who weren't just classmates and\nin general having more experiences\ndon't get me wrong i did most of these\ntoo but to a much lesser extent\nto a much lesser extent since i've been\naddicted to video games and social media\nfor my entire youth\ni've been worried about this for the\nlast three years or so which is pretty\nmuch my whole time spent in high school\ni discovered dr k's content sometime at\nthe end of last year and\nhave gradually becoming aware of my own\nissues since then but i haven't been\nsuccessful in making big changes in my\nlife the fact the fact that i've become\naware of my problems is a good thing but\nthat brings me back to the first\nparagraph and the fact that i feel too\nold to properly fix things\nby the way the title is a reference to\nthis viewer interview which resonates\nwith me a lot i guess that i still have\na chance if some people are out there\nreaching the same realizations at a much\nolder age\nanyways if you have anything to say\nabout what i wrote then please answer\nso this is\na common issue in our community as as\nthe person kind of mentioned you know\nwe've even done interviews with people\nsort of surrounding this issue\nso let's try to understand what's going\non\nso sometimes we're young in life maybe a\nlittle bit older\nand we kind of hit this stage where\nwe're kind of concerned that we've\nfallen behind\nthat during a period of let's say\nadolescence or maybe young adulthood we\nhaven't done enough\nand so we look at our friends it's not\nlike we've completely wasted all of our\ntime or maybe you have but we've done\nsome things but what we sort of notice\nis that especially things like video\ngames and technology will start to chip\naway at\nwhat we can accomplish in life and we'll\nlook at friends peers maybe people that\nwe know who have done more than we have\nright so we did some of it maybe we\nlearned how to socialize a little bit\nmaybe we had one relationship but then\nwe recognized that there are people who\nare our same age who have done a lot\nmore than we've done\nand so then it starts to feel like it's\ntoo late right because life is the sort\nof game where like\nthe earlier you start the better off it\nis there's kind of a snowball effect to\nlife so i recently read about someone\nwho was 14 years old when they graduated\nfrom medical school and it's like that\nperson is going to you know have a head\nstart on life and so at the age of 20\nthey'll have six years of experience\nunder their belt whereas many people may\nbe starting medical school around that\nage or even a few years later\nand so life sometimes feels like a race\nright we sort of have the kids who start\nschool early we have people who were an\nentrepreneur at the age of 21 and it\nsort of feels like life is a race\nand the tricky thing there is that\nyou know when we sort of start to feel\nbehind what actually happens is that a\nlot of people will tell us oh no no you\ncan start late like you can start at any\ntime right\ndon't give up hope like even if you're\nbehind like you can work hard and catch\nup and\nyou know even even i say that so that's\nthat's a big part of kind of what we\nshare right so i share my story of\nstarting medical school at the age of 27\nor 28.\nyou know and like most of my colleagues\nthat i went to high school with had\nalready finished medical school just\nwhen i was starting so i felt super\nbehind and it's not too late so you'll\nhave people who will sort of share with\nyou maybe their parents maybe they're\nrandom people on the internet like\nmyself will say hey it's never too late\nbut i think that that's a little bit\ntricky\nbecause sometimes what they'll say is\nthey'll say okay here's a plan to catch\nup right so even if you're a little bit\nbehind you can catch up at this point\nlike here's what you can do\nbut i think that we have to take a step\nback for a second and really try to\nunderstand what's going on here because\nonce you feel like you've fallen behind\ncatching up doesn't actually seem so\neasy right just because someone else\ncaught up and someone is telling you hey\nit's not too late to catch up there's\nlike a couple of interesting thoughts\nthat we actually don't acknowledge the\nfirst and this is what's really\nimportant\nis that the person who's expected to\ncatch up\nis the person who fell behind in the\nfirst place\nright so if i'm riding a bicycle\nand someone else is driving a sports car\nand after an hour they're way ahead of\nme and then someone comes to me and says\nhey like you can actually catch up to\nthe person in the sports car what we\nsort of like lose track of is the fact\nthat there's a reason why we're behind\nin the first place\nand even if i were to lay out a plan\nokay here's how you catch up here's how\nyou do a b c d e f g\nwe have to consider for a moment that\nyou're behind in the first place because\nmaybe you're addicted to video games\nbecause you're maybe addicted to social\nmedia\nright so like sometimes when people sort\nof tell you hey it's like super easy\nit's never too late you know by all\nmeans like get started which we're gonna\nsay in a second\nwe have to start with what's really hard\nabout this idea of catching up is that\nlike there's a reason that we're behind\nin the first place and until we kind of\naccount for that it's going to be really\nreally hard to catch up so if someone\nfails a class you may turn to them and\nyou may say hey even though you got an f\nnext time around you can get an a and\nthen that way anyone who looks at your\napplication sees that you've actually\nmastered the material that you've grown\nand you know you've discovered a new\npassion for studying and all this kind\nof good stuff you can correct past\nmistakes right that's what people will\nsay if you get enough\nthe challenge though is that you got an\nf the first time around\nso if you take the class again like do\nyou think you're going to magically get\nan a like what about all the study\nhabits what about all the things that\nled you to get an f in the first place\nhave those actually changed\nso that's what's really hard about\nfeeling left behind\nfeeling like you've fallen behind is\nbecause the person who fell behind is\nthe same person who has to catch up and\nthis is where if we kind of look at this\npost there are a couple of really really\nimportant things to consider\nthe first is that they sort of feel like\nthey've kind of fallen behind and\nthey're kind of afraid that they've\nthey've you know they may not be able to\ncatch up they feel like it's too late\nfor them and where does that idea come\nfrom it comes from the idea of how fast\nyou've already been going\nright so it's not that a 19 year old\ncan't catch up it's that if you've\nfallen this far behind at the age of 19\nyou know what's gonna happen over the\nnext two or three years because at your\ncurrent velocity like you're falling\nbehind so how does that magically change\nso that's a very valid fear that we\nreally have to think about\nthe next thing to consider is that\nsometimes you know people will give us\nadvice like they'll say that life isn't\na race\nright it's not a race to the finish line\nwhat you're going to retire at 60\ninstead of 65 is that actually like a\nyou know is that useful no no no it's\nnot a race go at your own pace take the\nscenic route everyone's life is\ndifferent so we'll get this kind of like\nadvice right\nthe challenge is that life may not be a\nrace but it certainly is a competition\nright if we really look at it right\nwe're competing so if my friend at the\nage of 19 has done a lot more than i\nhave at the age of 19 and we apply for\nthe same job what people will see is\nthat there's like one resume that has\nmore stuff in one resume that has less\nstuff\nand so sometimes like even though life\nisn't a race and i completely agree with\nthat statement we do still have to\nacknowledge that life is a competition\nand that if you aren't as competitive as\nother people you may actually be a\nlittle bit behind\nand this is where thankfully there's\nthere's a lot to consider here which we\ndon't really acknowledge\nso the first is that even though life is\na competition it's not necessarily a\nprofessional competition\nthere are a lot of things that you can\ndo to get ahead in life that involve\nthings like self-awareness and kind of\ngrowing as a person and things like that\nwhen we fall behind in life what we\nthink\nis that the only way to catch up\nis to do internships or you know go out\nand make friends or start dating a bunch\nof people we look at the ways in which\nwe're behind and we assume that the only\nway to catch up is to do those kinds of\nthings and so the tricky thing is that\nif we're you know if we're behind on\ninternships let's say and i tell you\nokay why don't you try to understand\nyourself gain awareness of yourself\nyou'll kind of like think about that for\na second you'll say but that doesn't\nactually help me catch up right all i'm\ndoing is gaining awareness of myself\nand gaining awareness of myself isn't\nsomething that i can put on a resume\nlike\nyou know like i can work on myself for a\nyear but if i haven't finished an\ninternship by that point i'm still going\nto be behind everyone else\nso let's take a step back i want to\nshare a story with y'all it's a\ncompletely valid point\nso when i was in residency we had a lot\nof very competitive candidates who would\nrotate with us so in residency you're\nlike working in the hospital you're\nstill technically you know doing\ntraining not technically you really are\ntraining but you're very competent so by\nthe end of residency for example you're\nnot only like basically a fully\nfunctional doctor but you're also\nsupervising junior doctors okay so\npsychiatry residency in the united\nstates is a four-year process\nso sometimes you know i went to a\nprogram that was competitive so a lot of\npeople want to go there\nso we would get people who would rotate\nwith us so this is something called an\naudition rotation so these are students\nmedical students that would come and\nwork in the hospital for a period of one\nmonth and based on their work in the\nhospital like you know you kind of get\nto know them and things like that and\nthen when they apply for residency you\nkind of like if they can kind of show\nhow good they are as a medical student\nthe idea is that there there's a good\nchance that they'll you know match in\nthat that\nin that program so if you kind of want\nit's kind of like an audition where you\ngo and work there for a month and if you\ndo a good job\nyou know you knock it out of the park\nthen you'll be high up on on the list of\npeople that the program will accept so\njust to give you all some context so the\nprogram that i went to gets well over a\nthousand applications for about 14 16\nspots they may get somewhere between two\nand five thousand applications i'm not\nentirely sure\nnowadays what the numbers are so it's\nquite competitive you know the\nacceptance rate is somewhere around one\npercent\nso\npeople would come and audition and this\nis the kind of thing where like we we\nhad one candidate who was amazing\nso an md phd\nhad tons of publications had done a lot\nof research very good board scores and\nthings like that and they came and\nworked with us for a month and so on\npaper this person is way ahead of all of\ntheir colleagues probably in the top one\npercent of applicants that we got in\nterms of like what they've accomplished\non their resume\nthe problem is working with them were\nthey were annoying\nlike\nevery time we were trying to get work\ndone they have to share what they know\nthey have to kind of show off their\nknowledge they're like you know they're\nconfident in themselves because they've\ndone a really really good\ngood job of like building a resume\nthey've done a lot of research in a\nparticular area so like any opportunity\nthey could get\nthey would share with everyone what this\nresearch that they've done is\nand like sometimes that would actually\ninterfere with like clinical care right\nso i'm seeing a patient with this person\nand it's like okay we've got 16 patients\nthat are waiting to be seen right we're\nworking in the emergency room and so\nwe're seeing this person and then like\nokay we're going to see them i'm going\nto let the the medical student do the\ninterview then i'm going to kind of\nfinish up the interview then we're going\nto kind of go back we present and it's\nlike time to figure out okay what are we\ngoing to do with this person and then\nthis this particular rotating student\nwould sort of share about oh i did\nresearch on this thing and this is what\ni discovered and i think like this is an\ninteresting option it's like that's it's\ncool that you did that but this is like\nclinical care\nand it turned out that this person was\nactually like kind of annoying right so\nthey were sort of full of themselves\nthey had a very strong application\nand we had other students who rotated as\nwell who were maybe not as good on paper\none of them for example had a very poor\nboard score but were actually like a\npleasure to work with and we're like\ncompassionate human beings and we're\nhumble and dedicated to the work that\nthey were doing they may not have been\nas smart as the first person\nbut we ended up ranking the second\nperson way higher and actually like our\nexperience with this other person was so\nnegative you know we were sort of not\nreally a huge fan of them and they\ndidn't end up matching it our program\nmy point is that when we sort of think\nabout life as a competition there's a\nlot more to the competition than what's\non your resume\nright they're like factors where like if\nyou're an aware human being if you know\nwhat you're feeling if you know how to\nbe compassionate towards others if you\nknow how to like interact with other\nhuman beings if you're kind of working\non yourself\nthat can actually be a huge part of the\ncompetition of life\nright now i want you all to just think\nabout this for a second\nif you had to pick a colleague to work\nwith who would you pick\nor even think about the games that you\nplay if y'all are gamers\ndo you play with the most high skilled\n you can find\nno of course not or maybe you do who\nknows right i've been a part of those\nkinds of guilds as well\nwhere people are like it's all about\nskill and like no interpersonal skills\nwhatsoever\ntoxic gamers through and through\nand that's not\nactually like\nwho most people play with right\nand life is actually the same way where\nif you think about you know who do you\nwant to work with do you want to work\nwith the person that has the best\nstandardized test score or do you want\nto work with the person who's actually\neasy and fun to work with is dedicated\nand is willing to learn\nand so life is absolutely a competition\nit isn't a race but it is a competition\nthe good news is that working on\nyourself actually advances your ability\nto win in that competition\nthat being a good human being who's\naware of you know what triggers you what\nsort of gets you to lock down\nunderstanding that you're con like\nyou're non-confrontational all of these\nkinds of things will actually help you\nin the game of life so this is where if\nyou're 19 years old and you're feeling\nlike you've fallen behind and you're in\nthe process of learning about yourself\nand becoming aware that's actually\ntotally fine in fact i think that is\ngoing to end up helping you way more\nlong term than an internship\nand this is what i've seen because i've\nworked with a lot of people at this\npoint where there are a lot of people\nwho will crush it on a professional\nlevel and they'll be so oblivious\nto themselves and to the people around\nthem that there's like there's a wake of\ndestruction\nanywhere they go\npeople quit they get into interpersonal\nconflict they have trouble in\nrelationships because all they're doing\nis grinding grinding grinding grinding\nsuccess success success success success\nand there's no time for like\nself-awareness\nso if you're 19 and you've fallen behind\ntake a step back\nit's okay there is time to quote unquote\ncatch up\nright and this is where like the let's\nlet's kind of think through a couple of\nthings that we've already said\nso how can i say that it's okay that\nyou've fallen behind the first is to\nacknowledge that part of the reason why\nfalling behind is so terrifying\nis because if you've already fallen\nbehind\nthat's the vehicle that you're trying\ndriving to try to catch up\nright so if you've been addicted to\nvideo games and social media\nhow are you gonna catch up it's not like\nyou can magically wake up one day and be\nlike not addicted to those things and\nthen you can start catching up like it's\nso tricky right because if you've been\ndriving a slow car\nand you're falling behind in the race\nhow are you going to catch up to the\nsports car who's already so far ahead of\nyou\nand so that's important to acknowledge\nand that's a reasonable thing to be\nconcerned about and that's actually\nwhere the awareness and stuff comes in\nbecause how do you speed up your car\nhow do you start to be more motivated be\nmore disciplined start to you know\ncut back on social media usage or video\ngames or things like that you have to\nfocus on awareness you have to focus on\nyourself and then there's a part of you\nthat's not going to want to do that\nbecause it's saying if i spend a year of\nmy life just working on myself then i'm\ngoing to be one year further behind\nand sometimes you got to take a pit stop\nright like if you're driving with a\nbroke a flat tire you got to pull over\non the road and someone is going to get\nfurther and further ahead of you and\nthat's actually totally fine because we\ngot to get you up we got to change your\ntire got to let you be able to drive and\nthe good news is that when you actually\nspend time working on yourself some\nlearning about yourself becoming more\ndisciplined then you can actually start\nthe process of quote-unquote catching up\nbecoming competitive that's what i would\nreally call\nanother thing to keep in mind is that if\nyou are a gamer you've spent a lot of\ntime playing video games i know it\nsounds kind of weird but that actually\noffers you some advantages and there's\nactually research to support this\nso for example i recently saw this was\nmore publicized but the study is quite\nold that\nsurgeons who play video games have fewer\nerrors than surgeons who don't\nwe also are starting to understand\nthere's some studies that we've cited\nbefore on fluid iq\nand problem solving and things like that\nwhere i've seen the cool thing about\nplaying video games is video playing\nvideo games actually and trains you to\nlearn new skills quickly\nso if you think about like if you're a\ngamer like every six months you're\nplaying a new game there's a new rule\nset there's a new meta and so actually\none of the cool things that i've seen\nworking with a lot of gamers is that\nthey may be behind but their ability to\nadapt and learn in new circumstances is\nactually really really good\nso i've even taken you know interesting\nproblems that i've had like when i was\num problems is in like cases that i was\nstudying\nso back when i was in residency i took a\nclass at harvard business school and\npart of that was like doing cases so\ncases are it's like a learning format\nwhere they give you like 30 pages of\ndocuments and they start asking\nquestions about a particular case and\nthe cool thing is when i like shared\nthose cases with my gamer buddies like\nthey were able to work through it and\nactually come up with really solid\nanswers\nand so i used their help and sort of\npresented that to the professor and the\nprofessor was you know i got the\nquote-unquote right answers and things\nlike that so it's actually really\namazing just because you're a gamer\ndoesn't mean that you're it's a complete\nwaste of time and in fact part of the\nproblem is that most of the research on\nvideo games focuses on the negative\naspects of video games so we're not even\nstudying the positive aspects of video\ngames\nwe have some people that are sort of\ndoing this but they're in the minority\nright you have groups like aim labs that\nare actually using video games to help\npeople who have strokes recover from\nthat sort of thing\nthere's now for example like a\nparticular video game that is in i think\nclinical trials for improving adhd and\nattention and things like that\ni recently also saw a study about\npokemon go fostering social\nrelationships\nthat's pretty cool\nright\nso just because you've been a gamer for\nsome amount of time and you feel like\nyou're behind it's not a complete loss\nand in fact in my experience when gamers\nput their mind to something because the\nbig challenge of being a gamer is i can\ngrind in the video game why can't i\ngrind in real life\nand the good news is that having worked\nwith a bunch of gamers and having had a\nbunch of gamers like even our coaching\nprogram and things like that we've seen\nconsistent change\nright we've seen that people once they\nare able to work through some of this\nstuff really become more aware of what\nthey're doing they actually can grind\nand start crushing it in real life the\nsame way that they do in a video game\nso it is possible so don't give up hope\nthe last thing that i want to\nmention just about sort of this idea of\nokay i i've missed the boat i'm falling\nbehind you know i'm\ni'm too old is it too late for me\nso i want to share with y'all one sort\nof really important kind of addiction\nprinciple or neuroscience principle that\nhas to do with this so if you're someone\nwho feels like let's say i'm in 19 years\nold 20 years old 25 26 20 29 32\nand it's too late for me\nso as you have that feeling it's too\nlate for me i'm too old\nthat negative emotion is hard to deal\nwith\nand when we sort of start to feel that\nway\nour brain has a very very easy way to\nmake that feeling go away\nand that is to turn to things like video\ngames social media apps youtube whatever\nso this is the other thing that's kind\nof tricky is that what we tend to see is\na vicious cycle where once you start to\nfeel like you've fallen behind and that\ndespair starts setting in\nyou'll start to turn to technology to\ncalm down the emotional centers of your\nbrain\nas you turn to technology to calm down\nthe emotional centers of your brain\nyou tend to fall further behind right\nand if this process goes on for a long\ntime we'll sort of end up with someone\nwho's got a lot of despair maybe someone\nwho's kind of like you know we use the\nphrase doomers sometimes\nand you kind of get stuck in this cycle\nwhere like you're falling behind and\nyou're using you playing video games all\nday and since you despair the only way\nthat you know how to deal with that\nemotion is through technology usage\nand so this is where a tricky part of\nthis is that you know feeling like\nyou're falling behind doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you're behind\nright that's like tricky\nnow there are a lot of ways that your\nmind can convince you that you've fallen\nbehind right it'll look at this person\nover here and say oh that person is my\nage and look at how successful they are\nbut notice what your mind is doing in\nthat moment\nit's not comparing to the thousand\ndegenerates who are worse off than you\nare\nright if you're 19 and it's too late for\nyou\nyour mind doesn't choose to compare to\npeople who are 25 and it's too late for\nthem or people who are 26 and put their\nlives together that's not the comparison\nthat it makes and so you've got to be\nvery careful about that because\nsometimes the idea that it's too late\nfor you actually comes out of a flawed\ncognitive thought process\nright so you've got to be kind of\ncareful there\nso if you're feeling like you've sort of\nfallen behind some\nit's\nokay it's not like everything is gonna\nfix itself there are a lot of really\ngood concerns to have\nso let's just run through these okay so\nif you're 19 years old\nand you feel like it's too late for you\nand your friends\nhave done more than you've done peers\nhave done more than you've done all this\nkind of stuff it's tricky right you feel\nlike you've fallen behind there's a lot\nof things to consider here the first is\nthat a lot of people may give you\nanswers they may say do this do this do\nthis we're guilty of that right we do\nthat we try to help people put their\nlives together\nthe tricky thing that very few people\nacknowledge though is that you can have\na plan to put your life together\nthe problem is who's executing it\nand if some person on the internet or\nsome self-help guru like myself or\nwhatever right or your friends or your\nfamily or whatever is telling you oh\nhere's the plan to put your life\ntogether\nthere's an important caveat there which\nis that the person who fell behind in\nthe first place is the person who has to\ndo the catching up\nso a plan constructed by someone who is\nnot behind\nand has discipline and says oh just wake\nup every day and focus on this and\nuninstall all your apps and do this and\ndo this do this they're constructing a\nplan for you but this is the person\nwho's like falling behind in the first\nplace\nso are you going to be able to catch up\nwith that kind of plan and it's a very\nvery valid concern\nbecause if you got an f sure can you get\nan a yeah just study every day go to the\nlibrary and you'll get an a\nbut we got to remember that the person\nwho's studying is the one who got the f\nin the first place\nand that they weren't able to study\nso it's a valid concern to have and we\nreally have to acknowledge that point\nthat external answers may not\nimmediately seem to work\nsecond thing to consider that you got to\nbe a little bit careful about is that\npeople will tell you it's never too late\nlife isn't a race and i'm one of them i\ndon't think it's too late i don't think\nlife is a race but what i will\nacknowledge is that life is a\ncompetition\nand when you've fallen behind\nit can feel like you're not able to\ncompete\nbecause there are certain things that\nyou've missed the opportunity to put on\nyour resume whereas as someone like even\nif you look at our coaches like our\ncoaches come from all over the place\nlike\nyou know one of them was a personal\ntrainer one of them was a teacher\nthey're all people who are making career\nshifts later in life some of them are\nlike fresh out of high school or college\nand like this is their first job like we\nget all kinds of people\nand it's not too late to make changes\nand this is where if your mind is\ntelling you because this is the\nimportant thing that oh like i'm not\ngoing to be going to be competitive i'm\nnot going to be competitive\nbecause the tricky thing here is that\nif you've fallen behind because you're\nundisciplined and don't really\nunderstand what you feel and like are\nkind of emotionally a little bit unaware\nand can't control some of your behaviors\nyou may think i can't afford the time to\nwork on myself\nbecause if i if i work on myself i'm\ngoing to fall further behind\nand so you can spend a year like this\nperson like the person in our post is\nlike okay after one year i have a lot\nmore awareness into my thought process\nbut awareness in my thought process\ndoesn't translate into like having\ncompleted an internship not yet\nso this is where i'd like to reassure\nyou all a little bit as someone who's\ninterviewed a bunch of people\nand worked with a bunch of people i can\ntell you that working on yourself as a\nhuman being\nabsolutely adds\nto your your you know the value of you\nin a competitive market\nbecause at the end of the day you can\nhave the most brilliant person who knows\neverything and there may be some\ncompanies that like that kind of person\nright like so there are many companies\nthat like that kind of person\nbut is that the kind of company that you\nwant to work out for\nis that the kind of company that you\nwant to work at or do you want to work\nat a company where people are like more\ninterested in in you know being\nsupportive and decent human beings and\nlike the work gets done like we're going\nto focus on the work we're going to be\ndedicated to doing the work but we're\nnot going to tear everything else down\nfor the sake of the work\nso even if you work on yourself like\nthat's going to help you in the\ninterview process it's going to help you\nduring times for promotion you may get\npromoted faster instead of getting fired\nbecause you're so narcissistically\nclueless that you have no idea what\nimpact you're having on other people\nso it's a competition but spending time\nworking on yourself absolutely helps\nanother thing to keep in mind is that\neven if you feel like you've fallen\nbehind because of video games and things\nlike that we're not saying that you\nhaven't but there are going to be some\nsilver linings there no matter what\nyou've spent your time doing\nit's going to have some advantages\nand so some of y'all may say but but\nthat's ridiculous how can being addicted\nto video games\nbe an advantage in any kind of\nprofessional capacity well as someone\nwho was addicted to video games\nand it kind of wrecked my life i think\nit's helped me a lot professionally\nright but in that moment you don't\nactually see that\nso\njust trust me that you know\ntime that you spent doing something is\ngoing to have some advantages and as we\ndo more research on things like video\ngames we're starting to discover that\nthere are actually some measurable\nscientifically valid advantages that\ngamers have over the rest of the\npopulation\nthe last thing to consider\nis that\nwe have to be kind of careful because if\nwe've fallen into video games and social\nmedia and technology and things like\nthat\nthe feeling of having fallen behind the\nfeeling that it's too late for me\nthat emotional\ndamage\nrequires a coping mechanism and this is\nwhat can really get people stuck is\nbecause the way that we end up coping is\nby actually like turning more to\ntechnology so you've got to be super\ncareful about that vicious cycle and\nwhat do you do about it this is where\nsomething like the awareness comes in\nright this is where you have to like\ngain insight into okay why am i reaching\nfor this what is so intolerable about\nthe way that i feel\nbecause at the end of the day if you if\nyou feel like it's too late for you\nwhere does that really come from is it\nreally too late for you if you're 19\nyears old i'm sure if we pulled the\naudience right now and we asked is this\nperson screwed they're 19 they just\nstarted college and they haven't\nsocialized as much as their friends have\ni'd say that most people who are\nlistening to this would say that a 19\nyear old still has time\nright that's what most of us would say\nat the same time if you're the 19 year\nold it doesn't feel like you've gotten\ntime right and if you're watching this\nand you're a little bit older you have\nto be careful\nabout what your mind will say because\nyou'll say oh a 19 year old has plenty\nof time but i'm 24 and i don't have\nenough time\nand then if we ask a 29 year old hey\ndoes a 24 year old have enough time the\n29 year old will say yes absolutely a 24\nyear old has enough time but i'm 29 and\nit's too late for me\nthis is the ego\nright so you've got to be kind of\ncareful because what happens once you\nfeel like it's too late for you is\nyou're very very attached to that\nfeeling\nyou don't actually want to contradict it\nand if you're not careful that feeling\nwill actually drive the behaviors\nfurther and further and further\nlet's see what chat says okay so 91\n92 of people\nsay that are you screwed if you're\nbehind at the age of 19. 92 percent of\npeople say no\nright so eight percent of people say yes\nyou're screwed\nso some people may believe it right\nthat's okay\nbut the vast majority of people don't\ndoes that make it right not necessarily\nit's just opinion opinion is not fact\nand at the same time there's still a lot\nof time left\nso if you feel like you've fallen behind\nit makes a lot of sense\nright if you're kind of\nconcerned because life is a competition\nand you're a little bit behind and the\nmore time you spend on yourself\nthe less time you're actually catching\nup and there's a bunch of different\nemotions involved there\nand that's why like it's important to\nlike think through this stuff right it's\nimportant to acknowledge that even if\npeople are out there saying hey you can\nactually fix it there are a lot of\ncaveats that there are a lot of reasons\nwhy it's hard to fix if you're if you've\nfallen behind and the number one reason\nis because you fell behind in the first\nplace\nso how are you supposed to catch up if\nyou're the kind of person who fell\nbehind\nand so one of the cool things is like we\nhelp people like this all the time in\nour coaching program this is like\nliterally what we try to do right so\nit's not something that's a particular\ndiagnosis we're not talking about\ndepression or anxiety or schizophrenia\nor even things like adhd or stuff like\nthat it's really about understanding\nyourself\nhelping you get organized prioritize\nbuild good habits start to set up a plan\nso that you can start catching up\nand what we really try to help people do\nis\nuse that awareness leverage that\nawareness for behavioral change\nso if that's something that's\ninteresting to you by all means you know\nsign up for coaching check it out\nwe also have ask a coach events and\nthings like that that you can sort of\nhear from our coaches directly about\nquestions that you have to see if it's\nkind of right for you\nbut at the end of the day i don't think\nyou're screwed if you're 19 years old\nand you feel like it's too late\nyou're not screwed should you be\nconcerned 100\nis it going to require some\nsophistication to catch up 100\nbut if you're a gamer i have faith that\nyou'll be able to figure it out because\nthat's one thing that we're good at\nright if you think about gamers right\nwe'll do level one runs\nright no level no level runs like you'll\nsee that in final fantasy you'll see it\nin like\nyou know elden ring things like that\nlike we're really good at playing from\nbehind\nin fact we thrive at playing from behind\nit's something that we learn the game so\nincredibly well that we're able to play\nfrom behind we handicap things to make\nthings hard for ourselves and karmically\nthat's what we're doing in real life\nwe're basically doing a low level run of\nlife\nand the good news is that when you get a\nlittle bit of help when you start to\nrecognize that the game isn't over that\nyou can actually do a level one run\nthrough the whole game\nyou can start to put together your life\nyou can start to catch up no big deal\nquestions\nyou all get that we're good at that kind\nof stuff\num\nso how do i deal with trying to join\nothers when i have fallen behind i work\non myself but\nbeen with others unintentionally makes\nme compare myself and even if i know\nit's flawed thought process\nhow do you avoid comparison so this is\nreally important to understand\nso you can't feel behind until you\ncompare\nyou all get that\nyou can't be short without someone else\nbeing tall you can't be tall without\nsomeone else being short\nyou can't be smart without someone else\nbeing stupid you can't be stupid without\nsomeone else being smart smart\nright\nyou can't be\na smurf\nunless someone else is a noob\nand you can't be a noob unless someone\nelse is a smurf\nso\ncomparison is activated by this part of\nour mind called the ego according to the\nvedic system or the yogic system of\npsychology so this isn't sort of like\nfreudian or western this is eastern\nanytime we compare it involves our ego\nand why is that that's because our ego\nis our identity\nright so if i if i am tall that is part\nof the i it's a part of my identity\nso how do you avoid comparison it starts\nwith actually paying attention to your\nego\nand oftentimes this is the key thing\nabout ego\nego is a defense mechanism against\nnegative emotions\nso i know this sounds kind of weird\nbecause if i feel short like if i feel\nlike oh my god i'm so short i'm so short\nand that causes me suffering how is that\na defense mechanism like because it's\ncausing me pain and that's what's really\ntricky about the ego is that the ego\nleads to suffering even as it protects\nus from other things\nso for example and at the end of it\nusually there's some kind of negative\nemotion\nso\nlet's just use this example of i'm too\nshort\nas i've worked with people who have felt\nthis way in the past times what's\nunderneath is a fear of being alone for\nthe rest of their lives\nand so if i'm afraid that i'm going to\nbe alone for the rest of my life my mind\nhelps me cope\nby dooming me due to shortness oh it's\nnot your fault it's kind of comforting\nright\noh like\ndon't just let go of happiness it's\nnever going to happen for you\nour the human brain and also the\nmammalian brain brains have this\ncapacity to induce despair\nso this is really interesting if you\nlook at research of catatonia\none of the theories around catatonia\nwhich is when we go into like a state\nwhere we're kind of like non-reactive to\nthe outside world we're kind of stuck in\nour own head\nso animals for example will play dead\nwhen they're confronted with\noverwhelming circumstances\nanimals will start to despair and it's\nkind of interesting because despair in\nan overwhelming circumstance is actually\nin like energy-saving mechanism\nright think about it if there's no\nchance for me to survive it's\nmake my time\nright then like i'm just gonna chill\nbecause there's no point in fighting it\nfeels futile\nand so oddly enough some of the ways\nthat our identity causes us suffering is\nactually to protect us from something\nthat's even more emotionally dangerous\nand if i tell myself oh i'm never going\nto be successful because i'm short then\nimagine all the pain\nthat i actually avoid by saying that i'm\nnever going to ask anyone out on a date\ni'm not going to apply for promotion\ni'm just going to hang out online all\nthe time i'm not going to go to the gym\nsaves me from embarrassment saves me\nfrom rejection saves me from all kinds\nof stuff\nso if you find yourself comparing that\ncomparison comes out of the ego when\ndoes the ego activate when there's some\nkind of negative emotion that it's\ntrying to protect against so you have to\nget to the source of that negative\nemotion\nso this is actually like if you guys\ncheck out the adhd guide that's coming\nout soon we talk about this because\nthere are very five very common\nmotivational\ntraps\nthat our mind falls into\nto protect us\nfrom ourselves\nso for example it'll say that may work\nfor other people but it won't work for\nme because i'm different\nand your mind uses that as an excuse to\nnot try\ndo you all see that because if you well\nif someone's like oh you should go to\ngym oh no like that doesn't work for me\nlike i'm different\nso our mind uses this phrase i'm\ndifferent\nto\nas an excuse to avoid all kinds of stuff\nand it's not that you aren't different\nright everyone is different like\nfactually it's true but it's how is the\nmind using that to manipulate your\nbehavior how is that your mind using\nthat to actually protect you\nwhat people don't realize about the ego\nis that that kind of thought even though\nit damages your motivation is actually\nprotective\nbecause when you get when you say i'm\ndifferent that won't work for me what do\nyou get to avoid\nwhat are the advantages of that strategy\nyou get to avoid effort\nyou get to avoid rejection you get to\navoid failure\nthat sounds like a pretty good strategy\nhmm\nlet's avoid rejection failure and\nfeeling bad about ourselves that sounds\ngreat so arises the ego\nand says don't bother because i'm\ndifferent\nit's not going to work for me\nso how do you avoid comparison you've\ngot to get to what is underneath the\ncomparison from the minus from the\nemotion\nwhat is the ego trying to protect you\nfrom and as you sort of grapple with\nthat you'll start to move forward\ngreat question\nother thing is that we've got a lot of\nstuff around ego right so in various\nplaces so you all can watch um you know\nvideos or streams that we've done around\nego lectures we've done around ego\num\nonce again our coaches are all taught\nthis vedic psychology model which is\nmore of like a eastern model of the mind\nso it's not really a clinical model it's\nlike what the yogis develop so it's a\npart of meditation and the yogic\nperspective on the mind\nso you know check out all that stuff\nthere's also shunya meditations are\nreally good for this kind of stuff\nbecause that helps dissolve the ego and\nas the ego starts to dissolve then you\nknow it's going to be easier to act\num\nokay is it true that the more you fall\nbehind you lower the ceiling of your\nhighest potential in life i don't think\nso\nso this is the kind of thing where it's\nlike what is the highest potential of\nyour life\nlike you can construct a situation in\nwhich that statement is true but i think\nit's kind of like a weird like these are\nall constructions of the mind\nright like i don't know how else to say\nthat but\nso\nonce again just like the best example i\ncan think of is kind of myself where\nsomeone if anyone told me that hey being\naddicted to video games for a few years\nof your life and like almost failing out\nof college is\ngonna just damage your potential\nright like that's a reasonable statement\nto make and at the same time it made me\nthe person that i am\nand if that had not happened to me i\nwould not be streaming today\nso the question that i have for you if\nyou have if you kind of think about that\nis like\nwhat would be my quote unquote highest\npotential if i was four years younger\nworking in a clinic\nyou know just seeing patients all day\nlong versus\nme being a few years older and streaming\nwhich one is my highest potential i\ndon't know\ni think that that that concept is a\nlittle bit flawed it's a great question\nbecause we operate that way right\nbut i think this is where if you kind of\ntake like a more spiritual approach like\neverything that we do makes us who we\nare\nand so who we are\nit's it's not like one thing is better\nor worse i mean sort of it is but\ngenerally speaking i think that\nbeing who you are is really really\nimportant and in fact most of the people\nthat i've worked with who live\nsuccessful and fulfilling lives\nare the ones who play to their strengths\naccept who they are instead of trying to\nlive up to some kind of potential right\nit's kind of like play the hand that\nyou're dealt instead of like the the\nhand that you could have\nand once you sort of move down that road\nit'll lead to a lot more happiness and\nsuccess\ngenerally\nright but then that gets into all kinds\nof questions like what is your\ndefinition of success what is your\ndefinition of potential is it you know\nraw earnings potential because if that's\nyour your measure then i would have made\na lot more money if i just\nstayed\nin medicine right\nlike\nso what do you consider a potential\nyeah absolutely is la laronny saying\nplay the hand that you're dealt\nthe problem is that\nso if you think about playing the hand\nthat you're dealt\noften times why we get stuck in life is\nwe look at other people who are playing\nthe game successfully with a particular\nset of cards\nand then we try to copy their strategy\nwith our set of cards\nand as long as we're copying their\nstrategy we're actually like unlikely to\nwin whereas we can actually beat them\neven if they've got a better hand if we\nplay the cards that were dealt\nand i remember this like when i was\nfirst learning to play dota\ni liked playing support\nbut i learned that everyone who built\nthese huge damage items\nwith crit\nlike you know with critical strike were\nthe ones that i was losing to\nso i started building carry items\nbecause i was like man these like these\nitems are broken it's so op\nlike who needs support items when you\ncan just build damage on any hero\nbecause look at this win rate like every\ngame that i lose this person is like\ncritting me for like 10 000 damage so\ni'm gonna build a crit too and i'm gonna\nown them\nbut\nthat's how you lose dota it's also how\nyou lose life right you got to play the\nhand that you're dealt\nall right\ni see there are some dota enjoyers here\ndazzle daedalus build cmdesso 100 man\ni got to play some league of legends so\ni can like\nanalogize to other mobas\nyou"
