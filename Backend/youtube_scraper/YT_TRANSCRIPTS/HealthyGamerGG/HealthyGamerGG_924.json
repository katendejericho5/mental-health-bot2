    "transcript": "so what the ego does is it doesn't\ncompare one person to one person\nit compares\nyou\nto the best aspects of a dozen people\nso it's creating a situation in which\nyou can never win hello friend hello\nhi\nhi\nhow are you\ni'm doing fine how are you doing doctor\ni'm doing well\ncan you tell me what you go by my friend\nyes uh my name is kami okay nice to meet\nyou kami\nnice to meet you as well and what's\nholding you back\nwell what's holding me back is the\nfear of underachieving\nbasically in nowadays\ncan you tell me about being able to yeah\ni'm not being able to reach my goals\nokay\nand and so can you help me understand\nwhy you're afraid that you'll under\nachieve\nthe goal the end goal the point that i'm\nsupposed to reach in my head\nis way higher above\nthan what looks reachable\ni don't know if i made it understandable\nbut\nimagine you're climbing let's like let's\nsay a tree but the tree you cannot see\nthe end of the tree\nyou can't reach the top of the tree\nso\neven looking at it just makes you want\nto\nstop you know why even try there's no\nend point\nokay\num\nso let me ask you a couple of questions\nwhat makes you think that you're going\nto underachieve what makes you think you\nwon't get to the top of the tree\nokay well looking at it might\nokay i should give a little background\non myself please um i finished medical\nschool i'm a general practitioner right\nnow i've worked for a year i decided i\nwanted to go into research to have\na better you know\nto have a better academic life\nso i started looking at phds so i\nstarted i found something that i really\nliked\nas a research topic\ni started getting into it but i'm\nlooking at like the names\nthat do research in that topic\nand\nthe difference between them and me is\njust seems\nlike un\nunapproachable\nthat their point is\nso i'm 25 i've been studying for 19\nyears in my life\nand it just feels like i'm just starting\nto get into it\nso\ni've been doing this for 19 years what\nis the point where am i getting with\nthis am i going to study for another 40\nyears\nand at the end of those 40 years what am\ni going to do\nwhat's gonna happen\nokay\nthank you so much for offering that\ncontext\nyes\nso yeah i haven't made it clear at the\nbeginning no no it was very clear yeah i\ni was you know i i think you were pretty\nclear that\nlet me just can i think for a second\nyes yes\nso what what makes you want to do\nresearch\ni basically want to do something that\npeople haven't done i want to find\nsomething that nobody has ever found\ni just want to do something new i just\nwant to add something\nwhy\ni want to have a\nimpact i want to have a memory of myself\nafter i die you want to be remembered\nyeah i want to be remembered\nokay\num\nwhat makes you want to be remembered\ni'm not the biggest person when it comes\nto believing in afterlife\nso what we do here is going be left here\nso whatever i do\neven\neven you know studying in medicine when\nyou read the names when you learn about\npeople\ni look at them and i see them as let's\nsay guidance like you see the name and\nyou look at what they did and they're\ninspiring i want to inspire\ni can be like a you know little name\nsomewhere but\neven 10 people can read it and if it's\ninspiring to someone\nokay\ndo you feel like\nso do you commie do you feel\ninsignificant right now\ni i do feel insignificant how long have\nyou felt\ni mean so far\nalways\nsince you were\nsix\ni'd say mostly started around\nlike\nelementary school thinking about it\njust\nlooking at other kids because like what\ni always did was compare\nthat was\nthat was the way that i looked at my own\nsuccess\ni compared myself to the other kids in\nclass\nmy friends for example one of my closest\nfriends was really good at gaming\ni always compared my gaming skills to\nhim one of my friends was really good at\nsports i compared my sports skills to\nhim\ni always wanted to be\nbetter i always wanted to be like the\ntop\nthat's what i always tried to do\nthat just went on forever even in\nmedical school i tried to do\na lot of things\ni just jumped from one branch to another\nbranch but at the end of the day i\ndidn't finish anything\nokay\nso now looking forward just going\nforward thinking about it\ni'm just gonna if i get accepted to the\nphd program that i'm thinking i'm gonna\ngo to the phd what's gonna happen after\nphd maybe postdoctoral maybe residency\ni'm gonna finish that then what's gonna\nhappen maybe i'll do research maybe i'll\ndo clinic and then what's gonna happen\nnothing nothing is happening at the end\ni don't see the end of the line\nso i'm starting to work i'm always\ntrying to be better at something i'm\ndoing that's the goal\ni'm trying to be better at what i'm\ndoing i'm comparing myself to other\npeople i'm trying to see what's\napproachable i'm trying to get better\nand better and better but i don't see\nthe end point\nam i just gonna spend my whole life\ntrying to be better at what i'm doing\nis this the goal\nsounds like it\nhow does that\nwhat is to accomplish from this\nyou tell me what am i you're the one who\nwants it what is my\nyeah what is my six-year-old self gonna\nlook back and say oh i'm really glad i\nspent my\nlast like 35 to 40 years studying on\nthis topic\nyeah so so\ni mean but you tell me kami so when\nyou're 60 years old and you've spent\nyour youth your middle years\nyour entire life\nand now they're going to name a disease\nafter you\ncommies\nautoimmune encephalitis\nand then all of the\nall of the medical students after that\nwill learn about kami's autoimmune\nencephalitis\nand your name will be in medical\ntextbooks\nwhat do you how does that if i tell you\nthat that's\nwhat they're gonna do how would you feel\nabout that makes me\nthat makes me feel\nsome\na little bit accomplished i feel i did\nsomething i can say that i did something\nat the end of the day i provided\nsomething\nyeah but let me ask you something when\nwhen they name a disease after you\nwhat is your mind gonna do\nso thinking about it now\nyou're gonna\nyou imagine you'll feel accomplished\nbut when you reach that point do you\nthink that's how you're gonna feel\nat this point if you ask me yes okay\ngood but when i reach that point i\ncannot say for sure for now why are you\na doctor\ni i wanted to do research i wanted to\ndo research so i looked at in what\ntopics i can do research\nand i saw that medicine was the most\ninteresting one for me okay\ndo you feel accomplished in being a\ndoctor\njust being a general practitioner\ndoesn't feel accomplishing\nokay\nso it feels like it's not enough that's\nwhat i mean by underachieving yeah i\nfinished medical school but i don't feel\nenough so so here's so let's understand\nby the way tommy this is beautiful i\nmean it's i recognize you're suffering a\nlot but i think it's beautiful how\nyou're laying out\nwhat the challenges you face are is it\nokay for me to say that\nyeah yeah okay completely fine so i\nthink the reason that you're under\nachieving is is actually it's kind of\ninteresting because you call it under\nachievement whereas you're actually\nachieving a lot right you're\naccomplishing a lot it's just not\nsatisfying for you\nand so what i'm imagining is that when\nthey name kami's autoimmune encephalitis\nwhat you're going to do is say well\nkami's autoimmune encephalitis only\naffects one in 10 million people whereas\nthis other person\nwho has\nlet's say\nyou know\nbob's\ni don't uh i'll try this bob's arthritis\nright\nbob's arthritis bob's auto well\nbob's autoimmune arthritis affects way\nmore people and i just get one line in a\ntextbook whereas this other person's\narthritis is all on all the medical\nexams and is way more common and they\nspend a whole day talking about it\nyeah\nwhat do you think about that do you\nthink that's a possibility that when you\ndiscover something it won't be enough\nyeah yeah definitely\nso definitely might not be enough even\nwhatever i do that's that's the biggest\nfear the fear of not being enough\ndoing this much so far still not be\nfeeling enough\nand i'm looking at the future\nthere's hopefully if i'm lucky enough i\nhave 40 50 more years to live\ni'm scared autoimmune\nencephalitis yeah\nwho knows who knows\nthere are two ways to get diseases named\nafter you my friend\nyeah true true\ni can be the patient zero who knows\nuh but yeah looking at those 40 50 years\nin the future will i feel accomplished\neventually will it be enough\nis it gonna be am i gonna one day look\nin there and be like\nokay you did good that's enough\ngood job\nwhat do you think\ni i feel\nthat's that's my problem i feel it's\nunachievable i don't see that\nyeah my father yeah my father is a\nneurosurgeon\nhe's almost 60. he's been working his\nwhole life\nand when i talk to him he's still like\noh you know what i'll work as long as my\nhands and my feet allow me to\nas long as i can do my work i'll work\nand they seem so unbothered by it\nhow does your dad feel about having a\nhow does a neurosurgeon feel about\nhaving a general practitioner as a son\nhe's a\nhe has a different approach than the\nmost commonly seen one\neven when i was first getting into\nmedical school he told me to do whatever\ni want\nhe said that he'll support me just pick\nwhat you want to do be good at it and\ni'll support you\nokay so now when i'm talking about\nresearch he says the same thing pick\nsomething you\nlike and be good at it and i'll support\nyou all you want so kami let me ask you\na different question\nhow does it feel have being a general\npractitioner and having a neurosurgeon\nas a father\nit's\nit comes with its you know um\ntoughnesses i guess i can say like hard\nhard parts\nthe military approach to life\nbeing up at 5 30 every morning eating\nbreakfast at 6 00 in the morning\nokay let's let me give you another\nexample for example i wake up at like\nnine i study i get ready for something\nthat i'm getting ready it's like five i\nspent my whole day studying for it\nat five i just lay back in my chair i\nopen up a game i play a little games i\njust talk to my friends he comes and\nlooks at me and he's like\nhuh\nso you're\nyou didn't study it all what did you do\ntoday\nand i'm like yeah i studied this is my\nlike chill time i'm just taking like an\nhour or two off you know i can just\nchill for a while\nuh and he's like yeah yeah sure and just\nwalks away\nnow he doesn't mean it as a\ncondescending condescendingly or\nhe means it as a comical as a joke way\nbut\nwhen you think about it\nis it\nit gives you know\ni can never be sure\nwell but\nokay yeah\ni mean\nwhen i talk about my dad i always say\nthe same thing he always supported he\nalways said what do whatever you want to\ndo i'll support and so far i guess it\nworked out good\ndoes it sound like it worked out good\ni'm just\nlooking at like an outside perspective\ni had it easier compared to a lot of\npeople when you think about it\nokay\nso\ni mean you don't sound\nyou don't sound happy kami\nwhat do you\nwhat do you define as happiness though\nhow do you define the happy state\nis it being happy with your life in what\ncontext you are happy\nhappy with my life are you happy not\nright now there's a lot of uncertainties\nhave have you ever been happy with your\nlife\ni mean sure in elementary school and\nmaybe high school\nduring medical school i was happy for\nlike two three years\nhelp me understand that how are you\nhappy in medical school\ni liked what i was doing i enjoyed going\nto classes i enjoyed learning new things\ni enjoyed my time in medical school\nokay\nso\nbut did they name any diseases after you\nin medical school\nno not really\nso help me understand that how could you\nbe happy in medical school and\nalso not be accomplished you were a\nstudent\nyeah\ni mean it was it was more like okay\nthink about it this way there's six\nyears\nand\nthe point to panic\nto to self-realization comes after the\nfourth grade\nin here like in my country medical\nschool is six years and we finish it and\nthen we go directly into residency\nso the first three years i was happy i\ndidn't even know what i was doing there\ni was completely lost i was like okay\nthis class and then this class oh let me\njust learn about this a little more this\nlooks interesting after fourth grade you\ncome into the realization of okay what's\nnext\nokay i'm gonna end this so let me ask\nyou something so i'm gonna use your\nanalogy of climbing a tree\nall right\nso for the first couple of years of\nmedical school you were really looking\nat like\nthe like looking at the tree at the\nalmost at the level that you were on or\nyou're looking at the next branch above\nyou right you can see like where you're\nsupposed to put your hand\nbut essentially you're looking at the\nlevel of the tree that you're at\nand\nthe dread sets in when after year four\nyou looked up and you couldn't see you\ncould see all the hand holds that you've\nbeen climbing\nyeah and you were okay like climbing one\nhand hold at a time you were happy yeah\nand then the moment you look up and you\nrealize oh crap like this tree doesn't\nend\nthat's when you became unhappy\nexactly\nthat's when it hit me\nso i guess i can see i i know it sounds\nkind of weird but like\nif you want to be happy what should you\ndo\nthat's the problem i'm having i i cannot\ni cannot figure out what\nshould i just keep on climbing should i\njust stop and go down\ni know how the floor was\nbut let me let me toss something out\nhow about stop looking up\nso just\nkeep on climbing yeah don't question it\nthat much\nsure\nhow does that feel\nit feels it it makes me uneasy to not\nthink what's ahead\nokay\nand why is that\ngood\nbecause it's always been like that you\nlook at the goal you have a goal that\nyou have to reach\nbut i don't see a goal anymore i see\nthat the goal\ni see goals let's say call it that i see\na lot of goals to achieve but i don't\nsee an ending of these goals\ni've i've achieved some goals\ni look at my cv and i look at myself i'm\nlike okay i did this and this and this i\nknow that i did these i'm going up i'm\nsetting goals still\ni'm setting a goal right now for myself\nto get into a phd next goal is going to\nbe finish that phd\ni'm still looking at the goals the\nproblem is taking a step back and\nlooking at\nall\nthat's ahead of me\nnow\ni feel uneasy without a goal because i\ndon't know what i'm doing then\ni don't know where i'm going\nokay\nit's like\nlike shooting my hand up in the air\nnot knowing if i'm gonna reach that\nbranch\ncan i think for a second coming yeah\nare you proud of yourself\ni am proud of myself\nhelp me understand that\nwhen i think to myself\nif i did a good job so far\ngetting to this point i did a good job\nso far i think to myself\nyes could i could i have done more\nof course i could have done more there's\nalways more that i could have done but\nso far i did good i didn't do bad\ni finished medical school i worked a\nlittle\ni wanted to get in research so i did\nsome\nresearch okay and i'm still setting my\ngoals and going there\nkami so i um\nthank you so much for sharing everything\nanything i have a couple of thoughts and\nwe can do a little bit more back and\nforth but anything that\nuh you'd like to add or anything that\nyou feel like\nneeds more explanation or anything that\nwe've talked about that frustrates you\nno not really i mean i can just continue\nafter you basically okay\nso i think there are a couple of\nimportant things here so i think that\nthe challenge the biggest challenge that\ni see that you face is that\na lot of different things are being\nconflated\nso if i tell you for example so we know\nthat that you've been happy before right\nand when you've been happy before is\nwhen you've basically been like\noblivious and ignorant to what's going\non\nexactly right so if i tell you okay so\nif you're unhappy kami then\njust\nbecome oblivious again stop looking up\nand while that may\nwork sort of\nit's a very unsatisfying answer because\nlike how are you gonna plan your life if\nyou're just\nlike lost in the moment\nexactly right\nso so i think there are a couple of\ndifferent things that are being\nconflated and and my sense of this\nsituation\nis\nthat these things need to be teased\napart and kind of worked on individually\ndoes that make sense\nthe first thing is it sounds to me like\nyou're in an early life crisis have you\nheard the phrase midlife crisis\nyeah yeah what's your understanding of\nwhat a midlife crisis is\nbasically the realization of the age\nmoving forward and then being scared\nthat the younger days are not gonna come\nback yep and and does it sort of make\nsense that you're kind of in an early\nlife crisis\nis it like having the midlife crisis a\nlittle bit too early yeah right so\nyou've you've been you've been grinding\nfor 19 years as you put it\nand you wake up at the age of 25 and you\nhave accomplishments behind you\nand somewhere along the way you thought\nthat those accomplishments would make\nyou happy\nbut yeah you're not happy\nin fact you're terrified\nyeah\nand so like you're not sure and\nbasically what i think that what i think\nof as an early life crisis or a midlife\ncrisis is\nyou play the game of life with a\nparticular strategy\nassuming that that strategy will be\nsuccessful\nand then you hit some point where you\nrealize like wait a minute the strategy\nis not accomplishing what i want and\nthen you feel terrified because\nhave i been using the wrong strategy and\nis it too late like if i basically\nscrewed up\nand then you're really confused because\ndo i continue using the strategy going\nforward\nor do i change my strategy but if i\nchange my strategy what if that doesn't\nwork how do i know what i should do\nbecause you're telling me like what if i\nspend the next 40 years doing research\nand like what if that's not enough\nwhat if these other researchers are more\nbrilliant than i am\nso like does that feel like it fits yeah\nyeah yeah i understand\nokay so i think there are two or three\ndifferent things to understand\nthe first is what is the nature of\nhappiness the second is how to plan your\nlife and the third is ego\nokay\nso let's start with the third one ego so\nwhy do human beings want to be\nremembered\nbecause they feel insignificant\nso i could argue with you if i wanted to\ni don't know how useful it would be but\nfor example like i don't think that\ngeneral practitioners are insignificant\ni think you sort of talk about you know\nbeing remembered because nothing happens\nafter death whatever that's totally fine\nbut like you know i think general\npractitioners are some of the most\nimpactful\nand memorable people because there are\nreal human lives\nthat you are altering the course of\nyou know this person's life which in\nturn is going to alter the course of all\nof their family members\nyou know if you find like let's say like\nyou know\na shallow depth\nmelanoma in someone where you can do a\nsurgical extraction never you know they\nnever get past stage one cancer you've\naltered the course of that person's life\nin a very permanent and meaningful way\nyeah what do you think about that\nokay uh the problem i have with that one\nis it's gonna be\nstill talking about my ego it's gonna be\nme being egoist about myself but\nthe way i look at it is if i'm not let's\nsay i diagnose and i treat and i change\nthe course of that person's life\nbut if it wasn't me if it was someone\nelse\nit would have had the same outcome\nmost likely they would still get\ndiagnosed by someone else they'll still\nget treated by someone else my problem\nhere with this with this one is\nwhat can i do\nthat will set me aside from the herd\nokay what can i accomplish that the\nother people cannot\nso as expected i i mean clearly you\ndon't find\nsignificance or meaning in that because\nif you did we wouldn't be having this\nconversation about being a researcher\nright\nso that makes sense that you\nare that doesn't work for you so that's\ntotally fine so i'm not going to argue\nwith you about\ntrying to convince you that you're\nsuccessful we could go back and forth\nright so for example some gps missed\nthings\nso if you caught something like maybe if\nthey saw another gp like they would have\nmissed it\nand then you'll have a counter to that\nand we can go back and forth about me\ntrying to convince you that you can be\nsignificant as a gp it's not going to\nget anywhere fair\nyeah fair okay\nso\nthe first thing to understand is that\nso a lot of this i think i think does\nhave to do with ego but it that's not\nreally your fault or anything but let's\njust understand a couple of other\naspects of ego so another is in\ncomparison so the tricky thing that the\nego does is that\nit makes unfair comparisons so what\nyou're sort of doing is comparing sports\nskill with one person video game skill\nwith another person research\naccomplishments with another person and\nlike you know\nsome other like\nnumber one in your class with another\nperson\nso what the ego does is it doesn't\ncompare one person to one person\nit compares\nyou\nto the best aspects of a dozen people\nso it's creating a situation in which\nyou can never win\nyeah does that make sense\nit makes sense\nuh can i say something about that sure\nthe problem\nwith the ego here is it makes you think\nit's achievable\nit makes you think\ncomparing yourself to other people\nit makes you feel like you can do the\nsame thing if you work hard enough\nyou can do this thing if you work that\nhard enough\nwell are you going to be\na revolutionary researcher are you ever\ngoing to win the nobel prize commie\nthat's the problem i i don't know if i\ncan i don't know so let's probably\nstability is really low\nreally really low let's be i'm going to\nbe a little bit critical i mean not in\nterms of this nuance of your language\nthe ego doesn't tell you it's achievable\nright because if i ask you can you\nachieve it you're like probably not\nthe problem with the ego is that it\ntells you that the insecurity that i\nfeel will be fixed if you achieve\ni see that's the problem with the ego\nand then what what the problem is that\nit sets up these goals for you that you\nassume\nif you win the nobel prize\nthat you'll be like content\nright that's what the ego tells you\nthe problem is that\neven if you win the nobel prize like the\nego is not going to be happy because\nyou'll share it with someone else\nyeah right like\nyeah\nso so it and the key thing there is that\nthe ego is a consequence of an\ninsecurity\nso ego doesn't arise when people are\nconfident it actually arises when people\nlack confidence\nsort of like a defense mechanism 100\nright so that's why i could try to\nconvince you that you have impact on\nyour patients lives i'm pretty sure that\nyour patients would agree with me by the\nway\nbut your mind is going to reject that\nbecause you don't feel that way right\nlike when you save someone's life from\ncancer\nyou don't feel that way you go home\nafter a day's work and you're like okay\ni saved a life today you sit down to\nplay video games your dad walks in the\nroom and shakes his head jokes about it\nand walks out\nyeah\nand so like\nyou don't know how to appreciate your\naccomplishments\nokay\nokay\nso that's ego okay\nnow the second thing to understand is\nthat like\nyou know it's okay so like what makes\npeople happy so this is where there's\nbeen a fair amount of research in this\nbut i think sort of the eastern\ntraditions like we're talking sort of\nlike the hindu tradition the yogic\ntradition the buddhist tradition\ni think they basically got the best\nanswer to this which we're sort of\nverifying through science now as we sort\nof develop these like psychotherapy\nmodalities that are sort of based on\nsome of these principles that help\npeople reduce their suffering and find\ncontentment\nso i think there's like some like decent\nscientific evidence for this kind of\nstuff but that essentially being outcome\noriented as opposed to action-oriented\nis going to like make you unhappy\nthe interesting thing is that it won't\nnecessarily\naffect your performance\nso\nthis is where\nyou know being happy is essentially\nabout living in the moment\nso like and we sort of know this right\nbecause there have been periods of your\nlife where you've been happy and those\nare the periods where you were kind of\nlike focused on studying you were\ncurious about learning you were enjoying\nthings it sounds like you were doing\nokay\nbut i don't know that\nbeing aware of what comes next would\nhave actually made you study more\nand and research basically shows that\nlike being terrified about the future\nversus like focusing on the present it's\nnot like one necessarily it's not like\nfocusing on the future actually improves\nyour performance or gpa\ndoes that make sense\nso so i think if you want to be happy\nwhat you should do if you want if you\nenjoy research then by all means become\na researcher and if you want to be happy\nlike really try to just enjoy day to day\nlike that that's an answer that we sort\nof have now the downside of that answer\nis how do you plan your life\nright if i'm just focusing on the\nday-to-day like how do i like plan at\nall\nand that's where like the tricky thing\nis planning your life for happiness is\nnot a great idea\nyou could plan your life for like a\ncareer\nbut the assumption that a particular set\nof steps\nwill make you happy that's where people\nrun into trouble\nso i'm not suggesting that you don't\nplan your life but sort of saying like\nokay if i get an mba will it make me\nhappy\ni don't think an mba or an md or a phd\nwill in and of itself make you happy\nand my simple reasoning for that is that\nthere are people who have mds who are\nhappy and people who who have mds who\nare not happy\nthe difference is that that happiness\nand success like aren't necessarily\ncorrelated i'm sure if you do some kind\nof like logistic regressional analysis\nyou're going to find that there's some\ncorrelation\nbut\nyou know that's massing a bunch of\nvariables i don't know how useful that\nis for an individual person\ndoes that make sense correlation is not\ncausation yeah\nright\nso i i think this is where like you're\nconflating the one piece of\nyou know\nrecommendation i would have for you and\nthis is sort of a situation where i feel\na little bit more confident like\nleaning on other things as opposed to\nasking you a bunch of questions is\nbecause i've worked with a lot of people\nwho are medical students and young\ndoctors\nand sort of helping them through this\nkind of stuff and what i'd say is like\nyou should start by teasing apart these\nthree things\nthat making a plan for your life and\nassuming that a plan for your life is\ngoing to make you happy is a mistake\nwhat do you think about that\nyeah yeah i agree i completely agree\nright and and this is where we sort of\nknow that like if we look at your life\na particular plan is not actually how\nyou've been happy\nin fact\nthe more that you conflate\nhappiness\nwith\num\nplanning the more unhappy you've become\nand the harder it's been to plan\nexactly\nso this is the kind of thing where i'd\nseparate those two things out and by all\nmeans if you want to be a researcher\nbecause like you find research like\nengaging then by all means do it\nbut this is also where\nanyway so\nokay so happiness is about living in the\npresent by all means plan your life in\nsort of a strategic and forward sort of\nthinking measure but don't assume that a\nparticular plan will make you happy with\nme\nyeah okay\nnext thing so this is what tangles them\nup is the ego\nso this is where like\nas long as you feel unhappy and\ninsignificant in here\nyour mind will try to plan a life\nof achievement that will fix the\ninsecurity inside\ndoes that make sense\nand you like an example for this one\nyeah so\ndo you feel like a fantastic human being\nkami\nno\nhow do you feel about yourself\ni have plenty of flaws and i look at my\nflaws and try to better themselves\nexactly myself so so there you have\nplenty of flaws right that's why you\ndon't feel good about yourself\nyeah so what's one of your flaws\none of my flaws is that i'm not a nobel\nprize winning researcher\nright\nso\nthe ego this is an issue of identity\nright so if i identify as a nobel\nprize-winning researcher do you\nunderstand that that has to do with my\nidentity it's like an ego\nright so like you can identify as a\ndoctor you can identify as a man you can\nidentify as a father you can identify as\na researcher you can identify as a nobel\nprize winning researcher or just a\nregular researcher those are all aspects\nof identity agreed\nyes yeah okay\nso\nif one of my flaws\nand something that makes me unhappy\nabout myself is that i'm not a nobel\nprize winning researcher\nwhat can i do to be happy\nokay\ni'm asking that's the question\nyeah\ni mean\ngoing on with what you said basically\nliving in the moment no trying to react\ntoo far ahead no no no no no no no\nwe're asking you what your mind is\ntelling you to do what is the mind how\ndo i correct that\nif if i'm flawed\nthat's you gave me the right answer but\ni'm looking for the wrong one\nyeah just study and get your nobel prize\nexactly right so now we see how the ego\nis the root of your plan and your\nhappiness\nbecause the ego says oh i can feel\nbetter about myself if i have a nobel\nprize\nin order to get okay so that means that\nthe nobel prize will bring me happiness\nnow we've attached happiness to your\noutside outcome\nthen what we also do is we see your plan\nso that gets reverse engineered into a\nplan oh so then in order to be happy and\nwin a nobel prize i have to be a\nresearcher so let's plan the next 40\nyears\nand plan on research and grinding and\ngrinding and grinding and grinding and\nthen we'll get our nobel prize and then\nwe'll be happy and then the ego will be\nsatisfied does that make sense\nyes\nyes it does but then that's like\nwhy is that hard for you because\nactually you've been happy and what's\nreally confusing for you is that the\nmoments that you've been happy are not\nwhat your ego is telling you to do\nso now what you're trying to do is\ncorrect an ego problem by a particular\nplan which you hope will end up with\nhappiness and that's how the three\nthings are tied together\nyeah i mean that's something i\ninternally think about myself as well\nlike i let's say have like crises like\nthis when i'm like sitting in my room by\nmyself thinking about stuff but then\nthe way i calm myself down is\nokay\njust remember you're not gonna get into\nan exam to win the nobel prize tomorrow\nright it's really far ahead you don't\nneed to think too hard about it that's\nhow i try to fix the problem the\ninternal conflict i have\nof you know should i just keep on going\nor should i just stop you yeah so so so\ni think that internal conflict is\nbecause you've got these three different\ndimensions that are a part of one\nequation that should each be\nits own equation\nyeah\ndoes that make sense\ni understand i understand your point\nhere so so that's where like i'd say\nvery practically like you've got to\nstart thinking so i think a lot of this\ncomes down to ego and and what makes it\nhard for you to feel significant\nyeah\nright so like when you do\nhelp people\nand i'm assuming that your patients like\nyou\nyeah like are you a good doctor\ni'm a good doctor yeah my patients like\nme right so like why doesn't that help\nit does help but it doesn't help in the\nbigger picture in my head the bigger\npicture i have in my head\nyeah so and where is that bigger picture\ncoming from\nthere you go\nright yeah i understand your point yeah\nyeah so so now the question really\nbecomes like like and i think this is\nwhere it's like you know dad is a\nneurosurgeon i'm just a gp i mean who\nknows if that's really what it is but\nwe've got to start thinking a little bit\nabout\nyou know\nwhy did you feel inferior to other\npeople because you also told me that\nyou've basically felt this way your\nentire life\nwhich means that it has nothing to do\nwith your accomplishments\nright so the ego the the is this is the\ntricky thing about people who have an\nego in security is\nso the ego tells us okay so if i feel\ninsecure and the ego tells us\naccomplishment will make me feel better\nright that's the assumption you with me\nyeah and then as i accomplish do i feel\nbetter no if you did then you wouldn't\nbe here\nlike you would have been content like if\nif if an outward accomplishment fixed\nyour ego then becoming a doctor would\nhave been sufficient\nyeah so despite all of your\naccomplishments what does the mind\nalways say the mind always says that's\nnot enough look someone is doing better\nlook someone is doing better look\nsomeone is doing better so it's not\nactually like logic i mean it's logical\nbut it's like selective logic\nthat no amount of work is going to\nsatisfy the ego which is the nature of\nthe ego\nbecause the insecurity was not actually\nborn of a lack of accomplishment\nit was born of a feeling of a lack of\naccomplishment and no amount of\naccomplishments will fix that ego\nyeah\nso then the question becomes\nwhen did you start to feel\nlike you were not good enough that you\nneeded to be better\nthe more i learned\nit was just the more i learned the more\ni realized\nthe more i found out that\nyeah i can do this too i can do this\nit's the realization if i can do this it\nwas so so i think all of those things\nwere reinforcing it\nbut i would venture that you actually\nlike this is like some weird experience\nthat you probably had as a kid where\nyou're you're the son of a doctor\nright so this is something that i too am\nthe son of a doctor so like i i'm\nmaking assumptions here but you know\ngenerally speaking where i grew up like\nthere were a lot there was a lot of\nvalue placed on accomplishments\nso fundamentally i learned\nthat\nmy value as a human being and my worth\nas a human being is tied to my\naccomplishments\nand there's a decent chance that\nthat's something that you grew up with\ntoo\nyeah\nand so then like then it actually goes\nback and starts like i mean you're gonna\nhave to do a lot of work here comey but\ni would say like you know maybe even\nworking with a therapist or coach or\nsomething like that\ni mean you're a doctor so you you know\nhopefully you understand the differences\nlike if we're talking about something\ntraumatic that reaches a clinical\nthreshold then you should absolutely see\na therapist\nyeah but working through some of this\nstuff and sort of setting planning and\ngoals and things like that that's like\ntotally fine with coaching you can\nactually try both\nbut this is the kind of thing where i\nthink you need to do some very serious\ninternal exploration and try to figure\nout\nwhen you started feeling insufficient\nand when you started feeling that if i\ndo this thing then i will feel\nsufficient\ni mean can i say something about this\nsure it's gonna be really broad really\nyou know i'm looking at the surface of\nit but\nwhat makes a kid happy like thinking\nabout it as a kid what makes a kid happy\nif\nif a kid does something good and if you\ntell the kid it did something good for\nexample let's say\ni have a child and my child just learned\nhow to ride a bike\nwhat would i do i would congratulate him\nand i would present him with a price\nand the price would make him happy\naccomplishment would make him happy and\nthe price would make him happy\nhe knows that\nas he's accomplished he's getting a\nprize and he's happy so\nif i really look internally and like go\nback think about it\ni might say okay looking at other kids\nbeing accomplished in things getting\nrewards for it\nthat and like seeing them happy with it\nbeing happy with it\nand me just watching them from the side\nis\nwhat made it you know\nwhat made me think oh okay i can do this\nas well i can get on this\nwhy shouldn't i reach or go for the\nprice okay yes why should i do something\nthat will make me happy at the end point\ni i think that that makes a lot of sense\nand is actually sort of precisely the\nproblem and i think there's more digging\nto be done here so let me explain it\nthis way\nso that only makes a kid happy\nif that's what the parents reinforce and\nteach the child\nokay right so if the parents say you\nonly get the prize for accomplishment\nthen that's exactly what the problem is\nis that you're creating a system where\nhappiness gets afflict conflated with\naccomplishment\nthen the problem is when these kids grow\nup to be adults there's no external\nparty that is now rewarding you for\naccomplishment\nso then you end up accomplishing without\nbeing happy does that make sense because\nyou've learned that oh if i accomplish\nthen i'm going to get a prize but who's\ngiving you prizes now that's why you\nwant a nobel prize you want someone to\ngive you a prize because that's what you\nthink is going to make you happy\nbecause accomplishment has been tied\nwith someone externally giving you stuff\nthe problem is when these kids grow up\nto be adults they wind up like you\nwhich is that at this point no one's\nawarding me stuff so even though i'm\naccomplishing i don't feel happy\nthe flip side of it is like also\nthat\nreally what you i mean there's research\non this like you could look at carol\ndweck's research for example on mindset\nshe did a lot of this original research\nthat what you really if you want to\nraise a happy kid what you actually want\nto do is reward effort not\naccomplishment\nyou want to focus on actions you want to\nget them to not look at the top of the\ntree but look at the branch that they're\nclimbing on\nand the more that you do that the more\num\nhappy the kid will be the more resilient\nto failure the kid will be\nokay\nso i i understand i answered your point\nhere so i would even venture\nthat you grew up and you had some\nsituations where you did something that\nyou were proud of\nand that someone around you\ndid not\nvalidate that accomplishment in fact\nprobably what they did is they said\nthat you were really happy like you ran\nto your parents and you showed them some\npiece of artwork and they looked at your\nartwork and they said what is this that\nother kid did better\ndoes that resonate with you at all\nand\nwhere are you\nokay uh it resonates with me a lot but\nnot through my family but more like\nthrough my like educational life sure\nright so so that more at like school and\nlike school accomplishments yeah right\nso like and that's where you know some i\nmean that's common so and this is the\nkey thing is like you've got to go back\nand like re-organize\nyour value system and like your\ni mean it's a lot of work but like\nyou've really got to think through this\nstuff and really really start to re\nrealize like where did i start believing\nthat accomplishment\nwas tied to more than accomplishment\nlike accomplishment is great achieving\nthings is fantastic\nbut when did your worth as a human being\nstart to get tied to accomplishment\nbecause when kids really develop\nconfidence they don't develop\nconfidence through accomplishment the\nway that a kid develops confidence is\nthat even if they fail\nhopefully some kind of authority figure\ntells them hey it's unfortunate that you\ndidn't succeed and you're still a good\nkid i want you to try again\nokay\ni i understand\ni understand your point\nlike perfectly\ndo you think what do you think about it\nyou understand it as one thing\nit is a lot of work\nyep\neven in my head it's a lot of work yep\njust something to even just figure out\nmyself\neven get help if needed it's\ndefinitely\na big pile of work so you got to be\ncareful\nis your mind looking straight or is it\nlooking up\nthat's the question to\nask right so in terms of stress yeah so\nso even now as you look at how much work\nit is you your mind may be doing the\nsame thing you may be looking up and\nsaying oh if i accomplish this thing\nthen i will be happy if i rebuild my\nvalue system from scratch then i will be\nhappy\nif i do a b c and d and i accomplish\nthese things then i will be happy\nand you've got to be careful kami\nbecause if you do it that way it's not\ngoing to work\nyou're just falling into the same trap\nof the mind again\na vicious cycle but i understand\nso\nit's gonna it's gonna be work but like\nreasonably common in my professional\nexperience\ni've worked with people for like six\nmonths to a year\nand they're like basically better\nlike it doesn't take years\njust like anything else that we do in\nlife when we really focus on it we can\nget a lot done in a very short time\nokay\nquestions\nwhere to answer\ni understand your points like perfectly\ni\ni will keep that in mind\neven just the question\njust conditioning myself to think\nokay am i looking straight or am i\nlooking up is a good way of coping very\ngood\num\nso\nyeah good so let me try to summarize for\nyou okay so the first thing to\nunderstand is that if you want to\nmove through this and resolve some of\nthis stuff is to stop conflating\nyour ego and your personal sense of\nsatisfaction\nwith\nplanning your life and being happy and\nto recognize that these three things can\nactually be separate\nbecause right now what your mind is\ntrying to do is solve all three problems\nwith one strategy\ndoes that make sense\nyeah so working on your confidence your\nsense of okay why do i not feel\naccomplished enough in the first place\nto ask yourself very practical questions\nlike when i save someone's life\nwhy doesn't that help me feel good about\nmyself\nlike\nthat's bizarre right so you got to start\nasking those kinds of questions that's\nabout ego you can also do other kinds of\npractices like meditate and things like\nthat which will give you a sense and\nexperience of self\nthat is beyond accomplishment\nthe second thing that you've really got\nto do is plan your life but don't plan\nbased on assuming\nthat if i do this 40 years later i'll be\nhappy because if that doesn't work out\nand here's the problem with what we call\nthe planning fallacy\nwhich is that we make plans at the\nbeginning\nand the beginning is when we have the\nleast amount of information\nergo the worst time to make a plan is\nactually at the beginning\nright\nso\ni think you should by all means make a\nplan don't just like you know forget\nabout the future entirely like if you\nwant to do research think about it focus\non your application build up your\napplication whatever do this kind of\nresearch thing if you like this if you\nlike this like whatever by all means\nplan but don't\nplan for the sake of like professional\nsuccess and almost like\nhave it be a compass don't really focus\non the end like how do i win a nobel\nprize\nreally focus a little bit more on like\nplaying a game of chess where it's like\nokay what's the next best move\nyou can't plan out how to win a chess\ngame but at any given moment you can\nlook at a lot of possibilities and you\ncan try to make the next best move\nand if you want to like apply for a phd\nand start doing research then by all\nmeans apply for a phd and start doing\nresearch and be like calculating about\nit and stuff like that\nthe third thing is you need to do a\nserious exploration\non what is happiness\nand what makes me happy and what makes\nme unhappy\nand like be scientific about it right\nyou want to be a researcher\nso when you you know\nif you spend a day working on your\napplication does that make you happy\nwhen you\nreceive an acceptance somewhere does\nthat make you happy is to really try to\nunderstand okay like what is the actual\norigin of happiness and once you figure\nout what the formula of happiness is\nthen you can start crafting your life\ntowards it\nokay um i i have two questions can i\nreally yes ask them fast okay first of\nall the uh patient\npart\nwhen treating a patient going back home\ni\nthe problem with that one i have is\nworking as a doctor i'm sure you can\nyou know think about it as well but\nliving\nat a house my mom is a nurse also\ngoing to the house where everyone is a\nhealth care worker\nworking on people's health\ni'm not saying lives working on people's\nhealth\nbettering people's health\nis something really normalized\nthroughout my life\neven going to work right now i look at\nmy patients i care for them i understand\nthem\ni i try to help them in every possible\nway\nwhatever i do\nbut at the end of the day\nunless i'm holding the heart\nwith my hand and just pumping the blood\nmyself\nit feels\nit feels like normal it feels like a\nnormal part of my life\ni don't feel\noh this is something different that i\nsee this is something different than i\ndo it's something my family has been\ndoing is something that i am doing right\nnow\nwe provided health care and we are still\ndoing it\nyeah so that's i want to put on that one\nyeah yeah that's that's a very good\nthought you had another one or you want\nme to address that one first\nuh yeah address that one first please\nyeah so i think um\none of the most so this is like one of\nthe problems that actually like kids who\nare kind of gifted\nrun into\nor kids who grow up in situations where\nexceptional is normal\nright so like you get a weird value\nsystem where\nwhat you're doing is considered\nrun-of-the-mill\nand so like that's something to just\nkind of think about but this is also\nwhere like even people who are not\nexceptional or like who don't grow up in\nlike you know households with very high\nexpectations they also have to do this\nas well that even if i'm a carpenter or\na plumber\nor a doctor\nthis idea that\ndoing a particular task will make me\nhappy or make me feel accomplished\nthat's what we sort of learn right so if\nwe like\ninterpret what you're saying it what it\nsort of means is that being a plumber\nbeing a carpenter or being a doctor\nfinding the value and appreciation in\nthat is actually intrinsic\nand and so what i'm hearing you say\nactually aligns perfectly with what\nwe're talking about which is that\naccomplishment does not automatically\nequate happiness and something about the\nvalue system that you grew up in did not\nteach you\nto appreciate what you actually do\nso now this is where you have a personal\njourney\nto discover whether you can actually\nappreciate what you do\nright so how does it feel to sit with a\npatient how does it feel to not sit with\na patient you may discover that actually\nfeels completely insignificant\nand that's where like if that's what\nyour internal compass is telling you i'd\nspend some time kind of working on it\nbut then maybe you need to do research\ni mean it doesn't feel insignificant it\ndoesn't feel\nextraordinary as well sitting the\npatient it feels normal yeah so so and\nand this is kind of my experience of\nworking with people is that most of the\nhappiness in life doesn't come from\nextraordinary it comes from normal\nand this is where we've got research on\nmindfulness right where it's like when i\nmindfully eat a piece of cake my\nenjoyment and happiness and contentment\nover the piece of cake will increase\nso to the enlightened person every\nnormal experience is extraordinary\nthat's what it means to be enlightened\nand these are people who have moved away\nfrom suffering and move towards\ncontentment so this is a it's a long\npath kami but i think it's important for\nyou to walk it\nokay\ni i understand it\nnext question you had two\nuh\ni you kind of answered my second\nquestion as well with the explanation\nthere\nokay uh\nokay one more question one last one uh\nyou talked about someone carol i i\nwanted to write the name down uh about\ncan't walk on\ncarol tobacco okay thank you so she\nwrote a book called mindset\nwhich is like for popular consumption\ndepending on whether you have access to\nresearch papers and stuff you can just\nlook up her bibliography\nbut there's a there's a book\nand then we also touch on a lot of this\nstuff i mean have you seen dr k's guide\ni i actually haven't so i i would\nactually\nyou may get i don't know if people who\ncall in get access to it or not i'm not\nquite sure but um you may actually want\nto check that out because i think\nthere's a lot of stuff in there that\nwill be\nyou know was made for people like you\nokay so understanding purpose\nunderstanding happiness even on we talk\nin the recent in the guide that's coming\nout we talk a lot about mindset and we\nhave some we lean on carol dweck's work\nand like how to change from this\nperspective of\naccomplishing brings me happiness to\nfocusing on the action brings me\nhappiness\nokay\nokay okay i'll i'll definitely check\ninto it good luck to you can i ask one\nprofessional question sure\nwhat do you think about cultural\npsychiatry the trans-cultural psychiatry\nin the gaming industry\nthe people in gaming\ni don't understand the question\nokay it's a really long question maybe\ni'll just email you about it later i\nmean you can ask it but\nif it's a really long question that\nyou're shortening to seven seven words i\ni i think it's gonna be hard for me to\nanswer it yeah um okay i'll start this\nway uh do you know about cultural\npsychiatry the trans-cultural psychiatry\nmcgill works on it\nso there's uh i'm familiar that\npsychiatry has a cultural component\nexactly it's about that\nare you do you know anyone who works on\ncultural aspects of\npsychiatry in the gaming culture\nbecause like now they're moving towards\nculture the culture of gaming or\ndifferent cultures\ncombining in gaming\nculture of gaming\num\nlike what is gamer culture\nexactly\nand the mental health\ni mean so the gamer\ni mean that's a lot of the work that\nwe're actually trying to do because\num\nmore and more people are doing it i'm\nnot sure off the top of my head\nokay\nyou can reach out to techteller with\nyour question and then we can forward it\nto our research director and see if they\nknow anything\nokay thank you good luck with that\noh thank you thank you so much it's been\nweird looking into myself\nyeah it's it's it gets it's kind of\nweird when you first start doing it but\nyeah\ngood luck to you kami i really mean it\nthank you thank you so much i i wish you\nthe very best as well take care man\ntake care\nokay\nso um and that lasted longer than\nexpected so i think once again we're\ngonna have to skip meditation which\nwe're gonna have to do better about time\nmanagement but\num a couple of things\nto just recap okay\nso the first thing is that\nsometimes we go looking for happiness\nand either through a combination of how\nwe're raised or\nyou know cultural influences\nwe sort of\nassume that accomplishing a particular\nthing will make us happy\nand that belief isn't entirely wrong\nright there's a reason we believe it\nit's either through some kind of\ncultural influence or the way that we're\nraised by our family or even some of our\nown early experiences\nthe problem is that once we start to tie\na particular accomplishment to happiness\nwhat that sort of means for us is that\nwe have to plan a particular kind of\nlife to be happy we start to tell\nourselves like okay i have to go to this\nschool or i have to become a doctor i\nhave to accomplish this or i have to win\na nobel prize or i have to be promoted\nand we start tying our happiness to\nparticular worldly accomplishments\nwhen you do this sometimes it can be\nvery helpful because you're going to\nwork really hard because you assume that\nsomething is going to make you happy\nbut what happens oftentimes is that when\nyou start living a life where\nexternal accomplishment is how you're\nchasing happiness\nyou tend to run into one of two things\neither an early life crisis or a midlife\ncrisis\ndespite a lot of accomplishment\nyour mind continually tells you things\nlike oh but look that person is doing\nbetter that person is doing better that\nperson is doing better and despite all\nof your accomplishments it feels like\nit's never enough\nright there's always more to do there's\na higher mountain to climb there's the\nnext mountain in the next mountain in\nthe next mountain\nand then what happens is there's this\nlike critical conflict in our mind\nbetween the part of our mind that was\nlearned that if i accomplish particular\nthings i'll be happy\nand the growing part of our mind that\ndespite accomplishing these things i'm\nstill not happy\nand when these two things butt in your\nhead this is when you get a life crisis\nand what i'm seeing is especially in\npeople who are accomplished gifted etc\nthis life crisis is not happening as a\nmidlife crisis it's happening as an\nearly life crisis\nand the crux of this life crisis is hey\ni've been playing the game of life with\nthis particular strategy because i\nthought it would succeed and what i'm\ndiscovering is despite succeeding it's\nnot working\nand then we panic\nbecause what do we do next\ndo we keep doing this strategy do we\njust assume that if i keep grinding for\nthe next 10 years 20 years 30 years 40\nyears i'll succeed\nor do we change our strategy do we say\noh my god this did not work so we have\nto find some way new\nand even if we assume that that's\nterrifying\nbecause does this mean that i've screwed\nup does this mean that since i've been\nplaying with the wrong strategy that my\nlife is not recoverable and that i'm\ndoomed to unhappiness\nor even there's anxiety how do i find\nout which is the right strategy i've\nwasted 10 years of my life with this\nstrategy how do i make sure that i don't\nwaste the next 10 years how do i find\nthe right strategy\nthis is the crisis\nand so oftentimes what ends up happening\nis that we conflate a lot of different\nthings\nour ego\ngets conflated with planning for the\nfuture gets conflated with happiness if\na particular plan for the future leads\nus to happiness\nand we crave happiness because we feel\ninsufficient\noh i i'm not good enough\nwhat do i need to be to to what do i\nneed to do to feel good enough i need to\nwin a nobel prize how do i win a nobel\nprize let's adopt this plan and so ego\ndrives your life plan or an insecurity\nor a feeling of not being enough creates\na life plan with the end goal of being\nhappiness and now we've combined all\nthree of these things\nbut there's actually a fair amount of\nresearch that shows us that these three\nthings are actually very separate\nresolving an insecurity can sometimes be\ndone through psychotherapy you don't\nhave to live a particular life or win a\nnobel prize you can just go see a\ntherapist and they'll help you work\nthrough your insecurities\nplanning a particular life doesn't\nnecessarily lead to happiness and\nthere's even been research on this that\nwe know that there are certain\nprinciples of happiness like living in\nthe present it's not that winning a\nnobel prize will necessarily make you\nhappy\nand this is what we sort of see in\npeople who are very very accomplished as\nthey think okay getting promoted\nbecoming vp will make me happy still not\nhappy senior vp will make me happy still\nnot happy\njune your partner will make me happy\nstill not happy seeing your partner will\nmake me happy still not happy so we go\non accomplishing accomplishing\naccomplishing and we're not happy at all\nso the key thing if you're kind of in\nthis situation is to tease these three\nthings apart\nand dive into each one\nand don't\nplan a life\nto fix an internal insecurity because\nthat's the strategy that's wrong\nis assuming that this internal\ndissatisfaction that i have will be\nfixed by someone handing me a piece of\npaper or by getting a corner office\nor by driving a fancy car\nand it's when we tangle all these three\nthings together which is exactly what\nour ego does right it says i don't feel\ngood enough therefore accomplish more\nwhen you accomplish more you'll feel\ngood enough how do we accomplish we have\nto devote our life to doing this kind of\nthing\nand so when i work with people like this\nthis is where really teasing apart these\nthree things is really really important\nand working on them kind of individually\nand as you do that hopefully\nyou'll resolve your insecurity\nyou'll start to discover the nature of\nhappiness and be happier day to day and\nyou will actually be more accomplished\nin life\nyou"
