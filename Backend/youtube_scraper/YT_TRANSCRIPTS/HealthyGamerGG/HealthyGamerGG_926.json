    "transcript": "michael had all the baggage of\ni guess being a black nerd or geek that\nin a in a\nenvironment that was not rewarding for\nthose predetermined identities hello my\nfriend\nhey oh hello hello dr k what's going on\nwhat's going on buddy\nuh a little a little bit nervous not\ngonna lie yeah a little bit this is a\nlittle bit daunting not gonna lie what's\nuh so first of all what do you what do\nyou go by and how would you like me to\naddress you today\num well normally trihex works um uh if\nyou want to call me michael we can we\ncan roll with that i'm\ni'm indifferent on it though if you\nactually wanted my take on that uh i do\ni made my online tag when i was 13 so i\nwas kind of like i kind of wanted to\nescape the burden of the iro identity\nbecause of like\nthe stuff i was going through at the\ntime here but hey whatever works for you\nokay so whatever you want to do you tell\nme try hex or michael what's what's\nbetter\noh okay\nsure let's let's go with michael let's\nlet's let's let's break down the the\nbarriers why not okay i'll i'll go there\nand and i understand you're a little bit\nnervous\nlook well chronic overthinker so i'm\njust like\nuh\nyou just got to ice break so that i\ndon't i'm not so like frigid\nlike you know whatever here you know\nyou know um yeah so can i just share\nwith you why i'm excited for today\nsure no please go\nso first of all uh michael i'm i'm a big\nfan so i really appreciate the way that\nyou\nyou know we have this idea that a gamer\nis like a degenerate\nand and you know someone who's like\nphysically out of shape and and things\nlike that and what i really appreciate\nabout some streamers is that they're\nthey model and also demonstrate that\nlike gaming can be a part of a healthy\nlife and you can take care of yourself\nin other ways too\num\nand so i just appreciate that about you\nman\nwow that means a lot i you know that it\nmeans a lot because in streaming i find\nit's it's very difficult because\nthe occupation really wants to reward\ndegeneracy you know just stay up late no\nregulation on schedule cover all your\ntime zones delegate eating out and\nordering take out all the time here that\nway you're not stuck doing any time\nintensive activities like cooking and\njust fitness\nor even just discipline on on physical\njust\neats away all of that meal prep working\nout gym going to and from gym just wake\nup turn over shower skip stream that's\nliterally\nhow else you're going to do you know 14\nhour streams daily yeah so\nminor soap box there but like yeah it's\na it's definitely putting in a lot of\nwork on that and\ntrying to it i'm i'm continually\nfighting to find the balance yeah we\nwouldn't pay outcome you know it almost\nsounds like you have to choose between\ntaking care of yourself and taking care\nof your\nstreaming career\nyes oh i think there's definitely a war\nwith that continuously yeah so i i'd\nlove to hear michael just your story and\nand you know how you came to be where\nyou are if there's some small way in\nwhich we can be helpful we'd love to but\num i'd love to just hear a little bit\nabout you and and get to know who you\nare\nokay well um\nso let's see here we can start first\nwith the fact that uh i've been twitch\nstreaming a lot longer than a lot of\npeople i was around i started\nbroadcasting in february 2011 so about\nfour months before twitch was even a\nthing\num so i was at twitch on day one back in\nuh yeah back in july 2011.\num but my my roots go even further back\nthan that i've been a competitive gamer\nuh speedrunner i've been speed running\nsince uh 2004. wow um yeah yeah yeah so\ni was uh so my first recorded speed run\nwas like um was actually done before\neven youtube was a thing youtube didn't\nhappen until 2005. so i was you know i\nwas 15 years old i thought i was like\nhot stuff i was uh well i kind of\nactually think i kind of was at the time\nhere i was recording speed runs and\nsuper plays and super game plays on my\ngrandmother's vcr at her house\nand she had the good internet so i was\nalways i would go every weekend when i\nwas 15 i'd go over there and like i\nwould practice at my house all week long\nand i go over there and just like you\nknow grind and getting this like sick\nrun that i felt looked inhuman so so\nprecise and everything else here\nand uh yeah i actually would mail my vhs\ntapes off to um to a website that would\nact at the time would host and convert\nthe vhs tape to digital mp4 video\nbut yeah i was uh i was really really\ngood at mario um you know that that and\nthat felt very validating um prior to\nthat i was actually a competitive\nyu-gi-oh player in in middle school wow\num so i was the bottom of the totem pole\nand social hierarchy because uh i i\nnoteworthy here i i grew up in um in a\nrural small town in louisiana very very\nsmall um so you know being into\nremember back here like 2003 here right\nso at that time anime was not mainstream\naccepted it was it was very much like\num belittled um in a way here i guess i\nwould say sure definitely you know\nwhat's the good word\nyeah yeah the the how do i put this here\nit's like when you're in middle school\nin high school the toxic hierarchy of\nlike popularity is very like superficial\nand if you're not with the hive mind of\nthe other big fish you get eaten alive\nso in short because i wasn't doing what\nthe other kids already were doing um i\nwas uh i was ostracized as like weird or\nnerdy or whatever um now this is also\neven further reinforced by the fact that\ni'm black and so because i was the only\nblack kid playing yu-gi-oh and into\ndragon ball and anime and also the other\nnerds in the library doing all this\nstuff here because i was the only black\nkid in there which again i didn't see\nracist regard at all here um but you\nknow the other kids because of how i\nguess they were raised in this small\ntown felt that way\nand uh so i got belittled a lot by the\nother black kids by um being told that\nhey why are you acting so white why you\nwhy are you into all what they do why\naren't you why aren't you doing what we\ndo or whatever and it was always like a\nvery like\nnot like a\num not like an intrigued uh engagement\nit was always like uh they felt like i\nwas attacking judgmental and i was\nattacking them when again and they're\nthe ones that initiated the conversation\ni'm not even the one approaching them\nyou know i i wasn't different towards\nwhether they were in 2002 or not here\nbut\nthat definitely\nattacked my insecurities a ton here\nbecause i felt like well dang am i not\nbeing okay maybe their logic is correct\nhere maybe i'm not being black enough\nmaybe i'm not uh being valid in my\nidentity maybe there is a racial war\nobligation to\n[Music]\nchange my interest to be publicly\npresentable in middle school in high\nschool\ni felt it was getting gaslit hardcore\nthere and it really ate me at me hard\nand by extension you know going through\npuberty and during teenagehood um when\nit came to like romance i just felt like\ni couldn't even like\nit was it was it was it was daunting i\ncouldn't even like talk to girls because\ni was just so chronically overthinking\non like well what what do i talk about\nbecause like you know the boys are\nshowing me for being into anime and\ndragon ball and all the cool things i\nthink i'm into so if i talk to a girl\nwhat what do i even what do i open with\nyou know i can't open with\ndo you what do i even do\ndo you do you play yugioh what deck do\nyou mean do you do you think magic\ncylinders are top tier card yeah yeah i\ndon't i don't know i really i just\nso i i famously say here that like at\nthe time i felt like i was stuck in this\nlike pyramid of confusion where like i\nfelt like\ngirls would say one thing but they meant\na different thing but they were thinking\na third thing and so if that's what i\nperceive that they were doing and\ntherefore i'm like okay well i have to\nlike i have to be\nwhat i think they want me to be\nand then hide who i really am\nand then pre-plan my next thought and\nhave my next reply to what they'll say\nto what i think they'll want me to be\ncontinuously and just you know i'm just\ni'm i'm\nyeah i'm frying up all you know i'm\nreally out of ram i can't download any\nmore ram at this point my my my cpu was\nfraud even trying to figure all that out\nso yeah\nyeah that was um can i just that was\nsorry yeah can i just kind of summarize\nwhat i what i heard for a second\nsure please\nwow michael it sounds like\nactually being michael was tough\nuh yeah yeah i you know things didn't\nget better until college i would say for\nsure yeah um\ni'm just noticing how many\ndifferent\njudgments and identities you were\njuggling\nright so the first is like you're a nerd\nbut you're a black nerd\nand the other nerds\nare not they don't have the same color\nof your skin you know\nand and i'm not hearing that you\nactually got necessarily a whole lot of\ndiscrimination from them\ncorrect but it was really about sort of\nlike this preconceived identity of like\nwhat it means to be black\nyes and and whether you fit into that\nmold\nright and and people sort of almost\ndiscriminating against you for having\ninterests that were not\ntraditionally like\ni mean there was there's this idea which\ni think is absurd which we sort of\nunderstand now but back in the day i\nmean i it's still something that i\nstruggle with as well but\nyou know that if you're of a particular\nrace or ethnicity you're supposed to\nlike particular things\ncorrect yeah and sort of struggling with\nthat and sort of trying to figure out\nwho you are and and not really being a\npopular kid because of your interest so\nlike the popular kids are kind of like\non your case and then even people that\nyou know\npotentially could have been good healthy\nrelationships because of your race and\nyour interests that was challenging for\nyou and then we sort of opened the door\nto any kind of romance kind of stuff\nwhere there's like layers of thinking\nand overthinking and and you know it's\nalmost like you're treating a a\ninteraction with someone from the\nopposite sex\nlike a strategic play in yugioh where\nit's like like trap card and then like i\ngotta do this and then like we gotta do\nthis and this and then if i play this\nthey're gonna do this and they're gonna\nthink i'm doing this and they're like i\ncan't let them see that this is my aim\nthat's a very good way to put it here\nthough i think at the time it was i was\nterrified of rejection i don't think i\ncould take it i was already rejected by\nmost of the kids there like i don't\nthink i'm the bottom of the social poll\nlike i'm the only black kid playing\nyu-gi-oh in the library in the morning\nso i'm the nerdiest one there by far and\ni don't know if i could handle another\nrejection i already felt so miniscule in\nthe self-worth sure i would just i i\nthrived and\ni just by like ninth grade i just like\nsaid okay whatever like let's just do it\nand so my goal was to become a god-like\nyugioh player like i don't need i don't\nneed their validation i'll just like\ngo in and find my own in my own piece i\nthink it's interesting almost that you\nwent into yu-gi-oh\nthat feels tied together to me\nthat\nyou know like your your passion for\ngaming almost grew out of the ashes of\nlike almost like a normal life\nthat may that sounded a bit dramatic\nbut\nyes yes\ni mean it was my calling maybe\nyeah i don't i don't know that that's uh\nand you know a lot of this now like i'm\neven me just narrating and giving you\nlike the like the narrator pov alongside\nwhat was happening at that time here it\nwas all stuff i didn't really\nacknowledge until like years later like\ni don't think i really understood how\ndamaging the whole like\nuh middle school high school social\nhierarchy was until like i was like 25\nyears old i really didn't think i really\ngot it until\nuh twitch\npopularity really hit me and then all\nthose demons came back in 2015 i would\nsay\nyou mentioned that things got better for\nyou in college can you tell us a little\nbit about that\nsure um so once i um so once i graduated\ni got into college i uh or particularly\nwas community college um i was still too\ntoo too broke to actually like go to\nlike big boy university so i just kind\nof like took like you know low-key\ncommunity college while alongside while\nworking just to kind of like i don't\nknow get things going here my mom told\nme it was really important so like not\ntake that year off of after high school\nlike you know because you're gonna get\nthe don't once and then you're gonna\njust like idle forever which i think is\nlike some really good advice here but uh\nshe told me that i ended up going to\ncommunity colleges taking a bunch of\nlike filler courses didn't really have\nan idea of what to do\ni didn't even look into if i could even\ntransfer credits and whatnot just kind\nof like in there to like be there and do\nsomething\nbut when i was in college uh the the\nenvironment there was just way more\nrelaxed you know you know people are\ncoming in their pajama pants there's no\nlike scrutiny over how you dress or how\nyou look you know it was just\ni don't know if nothing felt it felt\nmore like the real world where no one\nreally cares how you're dressing as long\nas you're just like baseline presentable\nin society and that felt really\nrefreshing you know you can just make\nfriends and it not be like again this\nlike\ngathering\npopularity clout chase\nthat i and maybe my high school was just\nlike particularly bad and maybe it's\nmore of a remnant of like just small\ntown usa where there's just a lot of\nhive mind going on there and when you're\nin a more metro city there's more\ndiversity and therefore by extension\nthere's like less scrutiny on because\nthere's so many groups right you i\nimagine like a big high school in like\nhouston texas would probably have an\nanime club for example but if you're in\na small town if you ain't hunting and\nfishing then you're you're that you're\nthe outcast yeah and people love to\njudge what they don't understand\nwow um so but yeah and when i was in\ncollege yeah it got a lot better i felt\nway more just normal uh and less\ninsecure just being myself\nyeah i think sometimes in college you\nknow we're busy living our own life and\nin high school and middle school we're\nbusy living everyone else's\nyou know and it's like what is this\nperson dressing like that becomes a part\nof my life that's what i think about\nthat's what i comment on i'm so\nconcerned with other people whereas in\ncollege it's like\ni don't have time to\ndress to impress you know\nthis is true yeah definitely that uh\nit's funny reading the background\nbecause uh um so my high school had uh\nschool uniforms well my entire state\nhigh school uniforms you got to wear\nlike khaki pants and like a um and a\npolo button up but which is meant to\nlike you know um uh make everyone's\nincome level and distinguishable that\nway you can't like you know wear like\nyou know\nfancy brands and whatnot and so it's\nfunny though because shoes were not\nregulated in this regard you can wear\nwhatever shoes you want here so it's\njust funny because that that policy kind\nof backfired because then what became so\nimportant for expression was shoes like\nat this point now whether you had on\njays or air force ones or you know\nnarachi's or whatever here or tim's like\nthat was like the thing so it's kind of\nlike hyper focused on shoes so it's just\nyeah and you're right if somebody bought\nnew shoes that was like the topic of the\nday like\ni don't know again incredibly and not\nthat being superficial is negative just\nwhen it's like superficial to a\num aggressive almost animosity sense is\nwhenever it was like\ndraining a little bit there i would say\nyeah absolutely\nyou know i think it i i sort of\nexperienced the same thing that\npeople are gonna find ways to\ndistinguish in social hierarchies and\nyou can restrict particular things but\nthen it'll be\nyou know like a particular set of\nbinders or a particular set of shoes or\nparticular watches or particular things\nand people will find ways to develop a\npecking order\ndefinitely and so what can you uh tell\nme a little bit so it sounds like\ncollege went like okay for you in the\nsense that you started to really uh not\nbe\nmade fun of not really judged quite as\nharshly people were more concerned and\nso what where where did kind of\nstreaming come in and and what ended up\nhappening\nokay so what happened here was uh so i\ndid my first speed run in 2004. i was an\nactive member of that community well\nreally in what game\nuh for yoshi's island um super mario\nworld two issues island the one where\nyou play is yoshi and you shoot the eggs\nat stuff yeah i'm like really really\nreally really good at that one\num i don't want to bore you with the\ndetails of it here but yeah uh that's\nlike the game i like i'm iconically uh\nknown for\num\nso i\nwas asking i'm sorry um i\ni\nyu-gi-oh was getting stupid i i did not\nagree with some rules that happened\nthere not that i don't want to boy with\nyou laurie either here but uh so because\nyu-gi-oh was getting whack which is\nsaying a lot because now you give us\nextra whack now at this point 20 years\nlater why do i assume that the the rules\nwill bore me\num oh because it's like it's it's\ntelling it's like michael i i'd love to\nhear it oh my god\nokay well so\nwell okay well first the reason why i\nthought if you would find it boring is\nbecause like it's just like technical\njargon that i don't i i fear i fear that\nit's not as interesting to the healthy\ngame audience so i hate to give you that\nmedicine fashion here but okay if if you\nif you\nokay so in late 2004 there was a\nparticular set of yugioh cards uh called\ninvasion of chaos that came out in japan\nit was coming to usa pretty soon\nafterward here this particular set was\ninsanely broken and had unprecedented uh\nresource management that was completely\nunethical in the context of how\npreviously when you would have monsters\ndie because they would attack one\nanother a monster goes to the graveyard\nit's supposed to remain in the graveyard\nbut now essentially what happens is you\ncan now rfg monsters abandoned from the\ngraveyard and use that as a cost be able\nto summon these 3 000 attack beat sticks\nthat can go ahead and annihilate\nanything on the board for practically\nnothing and when they do do that they\nget uh byproduct effects that are able\nto further push your advantage it's\ncompletely ridiculous so essentially\nwhat you can do now is just like play a\ncard dump five things into your\ngraveyard um rfg two of them bring up\nyour super big dragon and just go ahead\nand pay 1000 points and win the game so\nit's essentially like rather than your\nopponent having any capability to like\ndo anything about it here it's just kind\nof like press the win button and then\nturn off your brain and then you already\nwin\nit's like it's really really really\nreally toxic and these cards were so\noverpowered and so overwhelming that\nlike\num this they became known as staples and\nso like there was no debt creativity\nbecause this this meta was so dominant\nand and quite frankly economically they\ndidn't care at all here because these\ncards were because they were they were\nultramares they were like yeah they were\ngonna sell yeah these things were like\nyou needed three hundred dollars to even\nget this debt going here they were\ncalled chaos decks here and to get this\nthing going here and they were so\noverwhelmingly powerful there what were\nwe gonna do so the game became like\nobnoxiously pay to win and they did at\nthe time\nbefore it was cool and if you're a\nteenager you know i was influenceable so\ni just thought you know yeah this is\ndefinitely the uh\nthis is you know i\nyeah we didn't know that we have those\nterms of time here i just thought that\nbouncing was really really bad you know\nyou got the match gathering kids always\nmaking fun of you kids saying that your\ngame is trash you need to like you need\nto ban the entire set here and then you\nkids like no no no you're just not good\nyou're gonna get skill and just\nand in hindsight now i'm like i got\ntired of it but then here's the catalyst\nhere's a breaking point so japan\nhad had a they introduced a banned list\nbecause at the time here there was no\nbanned cards it was only cars that were\nlimited to one and even having one copy\nof some of these cards were incredibly\nbroken and changed the entire deck here\ngarbage like yada garasu and chaos\nemperor dragon and blackbuster soldier\nwere just completely broken and needed\ndefinitely some kind of like nerfing of\nsome kanye all together here much less\nlimited to one so japan finally said\nokay we have enough of this this is meta\nit's actually bonkers and they\nintroduced a banned list where like\n15 cards or more were abandoned at the\nfirst generation of this ban list and i\ntold my community\nmy community oh my god uh told my local\nhigh school friends hey i have the\njapanese ban list here remember this is\n2004. so we have like printers we don't\nhave smartphones here so like i printed\nout the sheet and i'm like hey\ntranslated banned list here y'all want\nto play it because i'm kind of tired of\nlike\nthrowing\nprobably yeah i don't even know how i\neven had the money to get these cards\nhere i'm thinking back now when i was 15\nwas i like was i like hustling like\nchocolate milk cartons and whatnot to\nget these cards i don't even know how i\ngot this stuff in the first place here\nbut i'm sure i've traded a copy of a\ngame here and there i think i remember\ntrading ratchet and clink for ps2 for\nlike a\nfor like a cannon soldier or something i\ndon't even remember at this point um but\nyeah i um\nmy community rejected it they were like\nno i work too hard to get these cards no\ni'm not gonna i'm not gonna that bayless\nis wack to me and i'm like well you know\nit's gonna come to america eventually\nright\nusually konami japan is gonna you know\nprelude what happens in konami usa\nthey're gonna bring here eventually they\ndidn't want to do it they didn't want to\nhear it they didn't want to adopt it\nbecause\nhere's what happened this was crazy here\nkonami usa was like oh well you know\nwhat this makes a lot of money here\nwe're going to have two formats we're\ngoing to have the ban list and the not\nbanned list where it's limited to one\nhere so everyone had the option to\nremain on the traditional list and i'm\njust like oh yeah now no one's ever\ngonna play the game that's gonna be like\nin my opinion fun and better here and\nstrategically diverse\nso\ni was like hey this is wack this is dumb\ni'm bored of this this is so exhausting\nthis is literally a pay to win turn off\nyour brain press the win button call it\na day thing here so it was at that point\nthat my disdain for for yu-gi-oh at that\ntime i hate you again for other reasons\nnow by the way here but at that time\nthat's whenever i kind of like moved on\nwas like okay well speed running is a\nthing that i was passively interested in\nand earlier for but now by late 2004 i'm\nlike yo this is like my thing now so\nawesome i wanted to take that uh\ntake that and go somewhere which on that\nnote last trivia about that here uh the\nname that my my tag trihex actually came\nfrom when i won my first online yugioh\ntournament in like late 2003. how did i\ni had a weight corner name back then and\ni um\nand once i got my first dub in a\ntournament i was like ooh no i'm a i'm a\ni'm a yu-gi-oh duelist now let's go i\nneed a i need a sick tag dude so i i\njust you know me my scrub self in\nphotoshop at age 13 i was like you know\nooh polygon lasso tool i can make a\nhexagon i just put three hexagons\ntogether and triple hexagon shortened\nfor trihex what was that\nyeah so that's so that's when trihex\ncame in to play from yugioh\ncompetitively and then it just carried\ninto what i registered my name as on the\nspeedrun community i i'm so glad you\nshared that\nyeah so\ni'm glad you enjoyed it i'm serious i'm\ni mean there's clearly so much passion\nmaybe\nmaybe a touch of trauma maybe a touch\nyou know i mean\nit's wild because people\nit's wild because people don't know how\nto read cards either so like whenever\nyou had a so thank you now this isn't\ngoing to take for granted right in 2004\nagain\nno one has a smartphone no one has like\na laptop nearby no one has wi-fi so like\nwhen there's a dispute over how a card\nworks how do you resolve that that that\nconflict and it was like so i had to\nthink in advance here and bum my\ngrandma's printer with her expensive\noverpriced hp ink and just like print\nout the rule sets for those known\nproblem cards i knew these boys were not\ngoing to be able they was going to\nassume the best faith in their favor of\nhow the cards operated so i had to like\nyou know bring them that and they would\nstill argue with me about it so yeah i\ngot some\nyukio players don't like to read i'll\ntell you that much for sure it is a\ntoxic to say the least\nthey also cheated on they they\nwhy do you want to um\ni don't want to make this about you all\nday here because you'll be let's take a\nstep back let's maybe talk about a\ncouple other things but if\nyou know if all roads lead to home\nthen that's where they lead and if this\nends up being a two-hour yu-gi-oh rant\nstream like let's you know let's get it\nlet's do what we need to do do the work\nthat needs to be done\nyou know no it's not it's not yeah it's\nnot that serious um okay so you started\nspeed running and that's wild by the way\nlike\nrecording things on vhs tapes and like\nmailing them to places to be uploaded\nlike this yeah there was a website\ncalled speedimo's archive and um the\nstaff there notably had like a bunch of\nequipment where they would convert vhs\nto digital video and uh yeah they really\nwere passionate about lifting up the\nspeedrun scene you know before youtube\nthey have been off to 2003.\nso yeah they had a bunch of speed runs\nat first it was just metroid and quake\nif i recall correctly but they quickly\nexpanded to the other game section and\nthe other game section like blew up\nbecause everyone was submitting stuff\nfrom you know banjo-kazooie to goldeneye\nto mario kart to everything in between\nand they couldn't keep up and i want to\nhop on that scene i wanted to be a super\ngamer i wanted to validate my existence\ni found great uh\ngreat validation and pride and dare i\nsay purpose uh with that\num i at age 15 i had that whole like i\ndon't know if everyone goes here the\nwhole existential crisis where you're\nlike you know what's the point of life\nyou know we're all going to die anyway\non that kind of thought in people's\nminds i'm not quite sure here but they\nhit me really really hard and i um\nand i was trying to figure out well if i\ndie tomorrow what's my legacy and i\nstarted having started becoming\ninfatuated with the idea of like okay\nwell\ntry hex has a legacy\nmichael has nothing i felt uh again high\nschool was just like not and middle\nschool was just not there very\nsucked how how was it uh and by the way\nuh michael i i just wanna can i just\nshare a couple things that\nhave come out of your mouth that i would\nlove to ask you about because i think\nthere's actually a lot of wisdom so one\nis you you've talked about overthinking\nyou use the phrase pyramid of confusion\nyou talked about how people love to\njudge what they don't understand you\ntalked about maybe your mom's saying if\nyou take a year off you're going to get\nthe a case of the don't wants\nand you'll be an idol forever\num and then you're also talking about\nthis like kind of conflict between\npurpose and and michael versus trihax\nand and you know\none has a life that they want to run\naway from and one has a life that is\noptimistic and and growing and has a lot\nof potential\nso can you tell me a little bit more\nabout just like\nso what was it like to\nwant to run away from michael if that's\nfair to say and and run towards trihex\nwell so again michael\nmichael had all the baggage of\ni guess being a black nerd or geek\nthat in a in a\nenvironment that was not rewarding for\nthose predetermined identities i didn't\nchoose to be black and i i don't know\nwhatever like do you choose your\ninterest i guess you just kind of you\nget infatuated whatever you run into\nover time here so there was baggage\nthere i got i got called white mike a\nton uh in high school um that i i found\nvery\ni felt i wanted to avoid a conflict so i\nnever want i was never one to like\nreally pump up confrontation and call\nthat out i mean it was just a bunch of\nblack kids maybe they want the fight\nmaybe they did in here but\num comparatively when i was try hex it\nwas like\nnone of the identity none of the\nidentical identical uh identifiers oh my\ngod words uh were\nwere relevant just my my gamer skill and\nmy my legacy like i was super into that\num\n[Music]\nso i i you know i things like learning\nphotoshop and really getting further on\ngraphic design getting better at drawing\ni i i could draw pretty well i i had\nambition i wanted to\nall the things that i desire to do just\nwere not aligned with like what i had\nexperienced thus far in middle school in\nhigh school so\ni wanted to\ni loved pixar i loved animation i loved\ncartoons i wanted to work at pixar\nbefore i died and i wanted to\num do everything i could to help develop\nthat skill set getting to that point so\num i felt like speed running was a great\nway to keep me afloat until then i guess\nokay\nand so uh help me understand you know\nfrom i guess right now you're in college\nor in the speed running scene\nuh you know between 2004 and 2011 when\nyou started streaming like what was that\nwhat were those years like\nso\n2004-2001 that is mostly me just like\nthis is this important actually we'll\nsay this is important um when i'm speed\nrunning i am i'm producing um the final\nresult the the run right the the the\nperfect run that i'm trying to get here\nmistake-free and all that i'm producing\nthat in isolation i am uh i'm usually at\nmy house to myself maybe i'm watching\nlike i don't know a movie on two tvs or\nwhatever here side by side while i'm\nlike grinding my runs all day and\nwhatnot while recording on the vcr\num but most importantly i'm i'm in my\nisolation i'm in my flow i'm i'm in my\nflow state i'm getting better i'm\naddicted to the progress and i'm\ncontinually seeing myself top myself\nover and over again and getting even\nbetter than what my starter goal was and\nit's very very fulfilling\num however i do think that people only\nreally care about the end result they\ndon't want to see the making of you\ndon't want to watch a director like make\nthe movie you want to watch the movie so\nby 2011 when streaming becomes a little\nmore uh palatable mostly in the context\nof racing the government's up here uh\npeople were racing each other so it's\nlike you know me and you that's 1v1 race\nmario brothers 3 right and we just like\nbroadcast it live on like justin tv or\nwherever right and that was that was the\nidea but people also were taking that\nand piggybacking off the idea of\nstreaming the races into also streaming\nlike world record attempts and speed\nruns so once i saw that in 2011 i was\nlike wait wait wait people will watch\npeople\ngrind like the repetitive grueling 99\nfail rate of grinding to get the result\npeople will watch that that blew my mind\nso whenever i like tried it out in\nfebruary 2011\ni was blown away that i had like you\nknow 25 viewers on day one um because i\nwas like because before remember for\nlike six years seven years it was in it\nwas like it was purely for myself it was\na self sure fulfilling thing but now it\nwas like other people are interested\nyeah i had an audience and i was like or\nyou know a community i was like whoa\nokay let's because i was already some of\nhis time here i i i\nalso know worthy here i never went\nthrough the whole like single viewer the\nsingle digit viewer slump where you know\nit's like it's like a it's like a\nuh coliseum to get out of here to even\nget to that like even the 10 to 10\nviewer account because it's so saturated\nnow right but i never dealt with that i\nwas already notable at the very jump\nbecause i had years of uh\nprerequisite skill to show my\ngamer cloud i guess there and so can you\ntell us michael a little bit about what\nyour life has been like since you\nstarted streaming so kind of catching us\nup from today till you know maybe like\nover the last 10 years and you know we\ncan go into more detail here there but\nwhat's it like being a streamer\num\nit being a well okay there's there's two\ndistinction here's two distinctions here\nthere was\nbeing a part-time streamer while trying\nto juggle working at a job elsewhere\nalongside dealing with irl you know the\ntypical struggle right your part-time\nstream but you could stream better if\nyou had you can do it full-time that way\nyou could put more effort into it that\nwas 2011 to 2015.\n2015 onwards when i became full-time and\nthat's all that's those are two very\ndifferent beasts i would say\nso if you're asking about full-time tell\nme about part-time streaming\nokay\nuh part-time streaming was a time\nmanagement\ngalore i i just\ni felt like i could never do it enough\nwhen i was like so i was a student um i\ndid go to big boy university i was a\nstudent um\nsorry i was like\ni'm sorry\ni was a full-time um full-time student\nuntil\nfall 2012. so 2011 to 2012 i barely\nstreamed i i did like two nights a week\nif anything here because i had like a\ncrap ton of homework like any other\nfull-time student um didn't get much\ndeep either honestly just kind of like\nyou know completely grueling um but i i\nsaw that i had the potential i really\nreally believe that i could actually\ngrow as a streamer if i had the\nopportunity to really give it a shot\nbecause i saw other streamers of time\nhere they were they were doing uh\nocarina of time and mario 64.\nand they were blowing up to you know i\ndon't know i hate to make it superficial\nhere about the view count but like\nthat's kind of the metric we all had the\ntime here so you know they were getting\nto 300 viewers i was sitting here\nstagnant at 50 viewers for a very long\ntime because i could only put in so much\ntime per week so i um i decided to drop\nout of university i'd say drop out i i\npaused university i i can resume\nwhenever i wanted to um but i was scared\ndead getting her because my grandmother\num she's a teacher and she was teaching\nfor 34 years so she's very old school on\nlike you know education that's how you\nget things going here and i um so i i\npaused university in fall 2012 just to\ngive it a shot for full effort and uh at\nthat point it was it was crazy i was i\nwas growing a lot more at that time\nthough i'm making more about this here\nnow the um\nwhat i would say\nwhat happened here is that um this is\nwhere like the start of like imposter\nsyndrome came into play because i i\nbecame known so well for being the best\nat yoshi's island and\nnow that um the community had grown um i\nwas i was not number one i was uh i\nthink i was i was number eight i was top\neight\nand i felt like i needed to get number\none um i was perceived as the i was the\nmost popular yoshi speedrunner but i\nwasn't the best one\num and maybe it has to do with the fact\nthat you know i had a you know again\nthis door gets technical here but like\nwhen it comes to muscle memory\ni was the original innovator of all the\nroutes um that we had now in yoshi's\nisland for 100\nand so i have like thousands of hours on\nwhat was the best route using only my\nfeedback here back in 2004 2005. so i\nmailed those routes back then the\ncommunity was coming because of the\nstreaming was happening now so now we're\nfrom just being also yeah not worth it\nhere i was the only ocean island\nspeedrunner for like six years\nso um\nso whenever the community was coming\nbecause of streaming now there was like\nno 10 20 runners and i'm getting i'm i'm\ngetting passed up honestly because we\nhave now collaboration they're they're\nshowing off new routes and it's harder\nfor me to get them because i have like i\nhave to it's not really easy to delete\nmuscle memory you should only really\njust overwrite it with like more\ngrinding so i kind of have like a i\nwould dare say an upper hill battle to\ndeal with but regardless of that though\ni was the most popular um streamer for\nyoutube at that time so being the most\npopular one the most viewed one but not\nthe best at the game did give me some\nkind of conflicts over that i needed i\nneeded to validate myself by getting to\nnumber one help me understand that what\nwhat what part of you needed to validate\nlike what helped me understand that\num\nthat's hard to i don't know that was\nlike\ni feel like\nif\nyou're you're an imposter well that\nthere was this really toxic notion in\nearly streaming of speeding at the time\nhere that you're a sellout um that if\nyou people can donate to you and if you\ndo you're doing it for donations and\nsupport and you're not doing it for the\nlove of the game like speed branch\nshould remain pure there were some some\na lot of\ntoxic silly ideas that were high roading\na lot here and it usually came from the\ncamps that had a lower view count that\nmight have been envious dare i say\njealous of those who were\nmore successful at it possibly\num\nhard to say really here but i i do feel\nlike imposter syndrome does whenever i\nlearned what that was actually did does\nreally um\nto me feel like what i was going through\nat that time and can you i can just tell\nyou that i didn't i did not i did not\nallow myself to enjoy streaming until i\ngot world record i was not i did not\nwant to play other games i didn't want\nto play mario party i didn't play casual\ngames it was yoshi and only yoshi\nbecause i had to get better at yoshi\nwhat what did it mean to you\nto\nget world record\neverything it meant that i could finally\nhave inner peace it finally meant that\nlike\ni am what i think i am that that like\nthe what what trihex is perceived as and\nwhat michael is are one in the same\nfinally rather than like\ni don't know like i'm just like i'm i'm\nthis gamer who already peaked and i\ncan't do it i see so\ncan i ask a couple questions about that\nsure\nso\nhere's what i'm kind of i'm going to try\nto sort of try to piece this together a\nlittle bit you let me know if this\nresonates or not but\nso\nthere was michael right white mike\nand then trihex came on the scene\nand trihex's\nthe best\nyoshi's island streamer speedrunner\nwhatever\nand so you know on the inside you're\nmichael\nand on the outside your trihax and\neveryone expects you've kind of used\nthis term over and over and over again\nwhere you kind of said you're top eight\nbut you'll sort of highlight the fact\nthat you were perceived as the best or\nmaybe the most popular\nright there's this i but like if we\nreally look at it it's even hearing you\ntalk about it it's like you'll give us\nevidence to the contrary\neven when you tell the story because\nyou'll kind of say\ni was perceived as the best but i was\ntop eight\nyou know and and so even hearing you\ntalk about it\ni'm almost and now it's sort of it just\nkind of clicked for me that like getting\nworld record means that what people\nexpect of you is actually true\nyeah you you nailed it that yes like\nthat that like\nthis is what the world perceives me as\nand there's a there's almost a sense\nthat until you get that world record\nyou've debated people\ninto believing something that you're not\nand and maybe a part of you is even\nterrified\npossibly\nthat you may not have been able to live\nup to expectations\nnot maybe you're\nexactly that i was\nthat if that were the truth that truth\nterrified me that i actually couldn't do\nit um and that comes back in the play\nlater on here in 2015 onward how so\num\ni honestly thought i had peaked i i\nreally did\nso i love yoshi's island my favorite\ngame of all time um and i grew to hate\nplaying it because i was reminded of how\nnot good i was at it in my own head like\nwhen you speed run continuously because\ni think i've been running the game for i\nhave\nat least 15 000 hours in the game since\n2004 a loose estimate here a\nconservative one at that two by the way\nhere um and in one game and uh in one\ncategory\nand i\nto this day i'm i'm\n10th place now um my my best time is\nfrom\nmay of\num i\nthe the the new the the new runners now\nthey're over 10 minutes faster than me\nwhich is like a huge deal like just\ninsane growth that's happened since then\nit feels daunting it feels like\nlike the game celeste it feels like i'm\nclimbing like 10 of those like to get\nthere because of the mental endurance\nthe insecurities the\ni feel like i can i can never get there\nokay and uh and not playing the game or\nuh i'm sorry let me cut you off there no\ngo ahead\noh um i\ni feel like you can't um\nhow do i put this here it's just like\nno matter\nhow hard i try i will never get there\nthe\nit's it's grueling it's grueling yeah i\nlove the game i want to play it i i feel\nlike i should enjoy it but because of\njust how exhausting this to acknowledge\nwhere i currently am i hate where i am i\nhate where i am i love improving but i\nwant to be able to improve in private\nthat's that's actually what it is here i\ndon't want to stream\nimproving at the game i just want to be\nbetter at the game i\ni crave the destination\nand i loathe having to like do that in a\ntransparent manner for streaming here so\nit's like if i became like a like a\nliteral who\nalt account no webcam the microphone no\nno requirement of interaction where i\njust grind the game and become like a\njunkie\ngame playing robot i could probably get\nthere in six to 12 months but because i\nhave to like balance interacting with\nchad and like being a charismatic\nstreamer and all that it just and then\nbeing reminded of like you know who has\nworld record and what i don't have and\nwhat happened and everything else here\njust\ndraining man\ncan i think for a second\nsure\nthere's a lot there\nyeah i'm sorry that was that uh no don't\napologize that's that's\nthat was positive feedback\nhow do you feel about being challenged\nmichael\nlike now\num\ni'm excited i i do spew in other games\num being challenged i\ni would say\nwhen i feel prepared if i have time to\nprepare i can thrive oh no yeah i was\ngonna make a couple statements that may\nchallenge you in this moment or ask a\ncouple of questions oh oh oh\nso okay so\ngo for it well i mean hold on a second\nbecause you just said i'm okay being\nchallenged if i can prepare but like\nyou're not prepared for this so\nmaybe we should steer clear um i guess i\nwas thinking of it purely in like the\ngaming gaming context but yeah i um\num\nwell this is\nthis is different like okay like yeah\nthis is like psychologically challenged\nright there's like there's like no\nlike i'm not pretending that i'm\nemotionally sound or that i'm like\nmentally\nlike\npristine here so like i'm on healthy\ngamer right so it's like yeah i this is\ndifferent to me than like i feel it's in\na different venue entirely than like the\ncompetitive gaming space or the or the\nwar of perception in\ninternet land so\nmichael what i really i appreciate so\nmuch about what you've said\num\nbecause i i think you've got\ni think you put towards so well what a\nlot of what we struggle with\nthe one thing that has really jumped out\nto me is\nimproving in private\nokay\nand there's a part of us\nwe all want to be number one\nbut what what\nwhy do we all want to improve in private\nhow do you understand that part of you\num because\noh that's a good question here\nuh so if we go back to like 2018 i used\nto say it was because i had performance\nanxiety i would say that like chat i\nplay better offline i swear i did one\nhour i i'm not want to do this here\nactually there was a point where it was\nreally getting to me and i and i\nacknowledge you okay maybe maybe i start\nblaming factors of mental rather than\njust like factors of the execution here\nso rather than me like i'm not doing\nenough practice okay maybe it's the\nstress of like having to do it with a\nfront with a live audience so i was\nstarting to do like dirty offline\npractice that would do a one-hour\nsession just like you know chill put on\nsome lo-fi whatever here just vibe you\nknow get back in my get back in my like\ndare i say renaissance flow state of\n2005 where i would just be it would just\nbe me and me and myself and there was no\nlike\nthreat of like\nhow how how many viewers can i retain\nwhile doing it or how you know whatever\nhere because the reality here is we\nhaven't talked about here\nin the context of speed running it's not\neven it's it's 90 mental to me like\nbecause everyone's good at the game but\nare you good at the game when you're on\nyour best pace ever when you're on world\nrecord pace when you have like triple\nyour normal audience size you can see\nthat view count getting dumb you can see\nthe chat and you're performing what does\nthat do to you scrolling fast\noh you it what it does is it exposes\nexactly how confident you are you can\nbring it down to a to an exact\npercentage number here that one trick\nthat you want to do on on whatever in\nworld five five four the five four skip\nif you are not feeling 99 confident in\nthat trick you're going to fail it like\nbecause you're going to have it's in\nyour head run free you get you got you\nhave to extract all doubt and get it out\nthere you need to be able to and\nwhat is what is the chat scrolling fast\nwhat are the high numbers you use the\nword threat\num yes\num because i don't want to fail again\nbecause it's the same thing over and\nover again you're just like you you got\nto like burn and choke 50 to 100 runs\nbefore you even finally feel like you\nare before you feel like you're\nconfident you have to actually be in\nthat the familiarity of that scenario to\nfinally understand\num that what you're fearing is debatably\nirrational you know you nail it in\npractice why are you feeling secure now\nyou know why is that the eyeballs got\nyou feeling that kind of way at this\npoint now okay so\nyeah so michael uh yeah yeah i'm sorry\ngo ahead\nall right let me ask you a couple\nquestions\nso\nwhat if i were i'm going to toss\nsomething out you let me know if this\nsticks or not\nokay\nthere's a part of me that wonders and\ni'm going to say some statements that\nare\nchallenging okay so and we're going to\nhopefully if i upset you or say\nsomething that's out of line please let\nme know and i realize i'm talking it up\ntoo much i don't think it's actually\ngonna be like that or anything but\ni'm maybe i'm thinking about my own\nexperiences but part of what i think is\nalluring about improving in in private\nis that sometimes we have a doubt\nthat\nwe may not be able to\nright so there's sort of this idea that\nif i do it publicly you've shared with\nus what the challenges of like all the\nviewers and things like that it lives\nrent-free in your head and and you need\nto be in that flow state you need to in\norder to crack that record in in order\nto get to the top in order for michael\nto become trihex\nyou have to be operating at 100\nand any amount of twitch chat scrolling\nany amount of viewers or any amount of\nthat other stuff that is not when you\nhave\nyou know been mozart or bin bach\nand so there's that aspect of streaming\nand sort of juggling things and stuff\nlike that which i completely i\ncompletely get i think that makes a lot\nof sense we can talk more about that but\nthere's a part of me that actually\nwonders like you know now you're number\n10 you used to be number eight\nthere's a part of me that that wonders\nif there's a part of you\nthat thinks that as these people like\nand i can almost hear the\nrationalizations in your head that i got\nto be number one you know without any\nkind of feedback without learning from\nother people\nthe kids are younger now they're they're\nyou know they're faster they're stronger\nthey're\nyou know like\nthere are people who can grind 15 000\nhours whereas like there you are\ndrinking what appears to be a protein\nshake like you know i'm looking at you\nin your under armour tea and it's like\nyou take care of yourself and and things\nlike that you know you got bills to pay\nand got to pay your taxes and stuff like\nthat and there are these kids out there\nthat just\nall they can do is is grind\nand there's a part of me that wonders\nlike\nif you're in private like you can at\nleast fail in private\nthat's a good way to put that yeah yeah\nand and i wonder if part of the reason\ni'm free from scrutiny yeah and the real\nthing about free from scrutiny is it\ncomes down to and i think a big part of\nthis why do you need to be free from\nscrutiny and the more you doubt yourself\nthe more that you start to wonder like\nwill i ever be number one again because\nlike you know let's i mean let's be\nhonest like every generation gets\nbetter\nright like\nyeah you know 100 years ago the chess\ngrand masters were like in their 60s and\nthen they were in their 40s and then\nthey were in their 30s and\nyou know like the the best go players in\nthe world i think are like 19.\nand\nand what we're sort of\nit's the same thing actually in speed\nrunning you're not you're not you're\nmaking a real some really good parallel\npoints here um yeah and speed running is\nthe same thing the the kids are younger\num i'm sure covid quarantine probably\nfurther accelerated that entirely here\nwith the fortnite kids and whatever else\nin between\num\nyeah everyone the they're getting\nthey're getting younger they're getting\nstronger they're getting faster the\nresources to to the knowledge here i\nmean i imagine in chess might be\nparallel here the you know chess three\nis probably way more palatable\nmainstream now than it was maybe in the\n70s or 60s clearly and uh\nyeah yeah now you if you want to get\ngood at mars 64 it's it's you're like\nthree wikipedia articles away from\nknowing everything the world record\nholder knows literally\nso so what does that mean for you\num\nwhat what does what does just just the\nfact that people are you know younger\nfaster stronger\nthey can they can climb so you you're\nyou're a trailblazer\nright so you work really hard to get so\nfar\nand you're you know you're you're\nliterally like making a trail that the\npeople\nbehind you can just\nrun down whereas each inch of that trail\nwas something that you had to you know\nmake\nit does it doesn't really bother me that\num there are other people better\nactually no one's really uh toxic uh i\nwould say to me no one's like no one\nbelittles me it was all it was all a war\nin my head um so help me understand that\nbecause i i'm happy to hear you're in a\ngood place but how did you get there\nbecause i can imagine that\nwell well let's not\ni wouldn't say i'm in a great i'm still\nworking through issues on yoshi's island\nhonestly um i would i just say that\nthere's like uh\nthey're\nhow do i put this here\nthere was\nbullying i don't know how to put this\nhere this is like\nokay okay i'll just i'm just gonna\nthroughout that because i don't know how\nto make this like a more palatable way\nto say it here so\n4chan there was a group on 4chan called\nspeedrun general called srg this was\nlike a 4chan anonymous message board\ngroup that would usually like um\nthis was like one of the more larger\num\n[Music]\nspectator groups in speed running but\nspeed running was very very young in\n2011 and whatnot\nand uh i feel like i got i got a lot of\ni got a lot of attacks from them it's a\nreally toxic group i am not a fan of\nthat at all here um\nuh but they uh i got a lot of attacks\nthere because um\ni was talkative i guess i would say here\ni was less about the game i would i\nwould i would talk a lot major context\nwe haven't gotten to here yet was i was\na waiter for eight years um the the job\ni did alongside being um a university\nstudent and everything else here from\n2007 to 2015 when i went full time i was\na waiter so naturally being a waiter\nyou're just you're just doing social\nengineering on steroids at all times\nhere so i'm able to like pinpoint and\nfigure out here like\nwhen am i taking too long to a point\nthat keeps you continuously engaged how\nto get how to keep the physical\nconversation well\ni'm trying to demonstrate mastery of\nbody language that might come off as\napproachable accessible um and\ncharismatic and relatable to anyone i'm\ntalking to and whatnot here getting a\nfeel and a vibe for\nwhy you're currently at the restaurant\nare you here on a movie date you got to\nbe somewhere by a certain point are you\nhere to like you know milk it are you\nhere to like you know you are here to\nwatch the football game and therefore to\nbe more minimalistic and that way i'm\nnot intruding on your on the the on the\nthe the football game or whatever here\netcetera you know\nhas its advantages\nyeah it's also running too because it's\nall about you know it's all about\noptimizing here you know when to uh\nyou know because i i know that once i\nget your order in there we can slow the\npace down considerably it's all about\nthe acceleration thank you michael\nyeah yeah\nyeah i i've been told that\num\nyeah so i i i did that i did that a ton\nand uh particularly here i was always\nreally keen for like if you were stuck\non an indecisiveness like you know i\nwant to get your order in because you're\nhungry and the timer is taken here\nwhether we've ordered your food or not\nhere in the context of your hunger so i\nwill make it my great effort here to\nmake the conversation as conversational\nas possible rather than more\ntransactional so i'm trying to like you\nknow throw you\nuh my recommendations my top three i\nwould go for the most popular dishes\nwhat i like why i like it that way you\nfeel more uh welcome to like tell me\nyou're talking or you're thinking about\ndoing you know etc right so anyways here\ni was awaited for a long period of time\nand and that that\nlike um\nthat kind of like exuded into my um my\nstreaming you know what after i would do\na run\ni would have like so many because again\ni wasn't toasting i would i not during\nthe run yeah but afterwards yeah yeah i\nwas in flow state i would better talk\nduring the run and then when i'm done\ni'm so overwhelmed by questions i'm\ntaking each question from chat here and\ni'm able to like actually take what\nthey're asking and extend the dialogue\nof what they're asking you're asking me\nabout my controller but you really want\nto know like how why i'm holding control\nthe way i am so i'll just answer that\nquestion with more collaboration on what\nyou're getting to and it ended up being\nlike you know like\ni would say like maybe like four hours\nwould be gameplay and the remaining\nthree would be me just talking because i\nhad so much to say about what people\nwere asking about and what did\nfortunately\nsay again what did 4chan think about\nthat oh they hated it they thought it\nwas a sellout they thought i was a\ni don't know like not a real speed\nrunner because every time they every\ntime they would tune in i'm always just\ntalking and yapping or whatever just\nhaters uh but again i was insecure maybe\nas a remnant of the middle school high\nschool thing i\ni did feel some irrational obligation to\nbe liked by everybody um and again maybe\nbecause of just remnants from that there\nand it would really get at me a lot um\nin fact it made me almost quit it made\nme almost uh\ni can say here with no light heart dr k\nthat i\ndecember\n22nd 2014. that was the day that i wrote\na paste bin\num that i really didn't know i was gonna\ndo next there was a charity race that\nwas uh that was going on here um\nit was a cherries between me and that at\nthat point uh number one uh the number\none runner by the way we didn't get\nearlier uh i was number two at one point\ni was number eight whenever uh\nin 2012 but by 2014\nthrough just scathing amounts of\ngrinding and enduring i did get to\nnumber two\num and me and the number mean the number\none went for a race but he was way more\nconsistent than me so like i i failed\nall the hard tricks and i was uh\nten minutes behind and i was getting\nberated by that chat and there was a lot\nof them that were from that community\nthat were\nout um\nyeah hitting me really hit me hard like\nyou know kill yourself and you're trash\nand you'll never be good and i guess in\ntheir eyes thought it was like you know\njust banter but i i i'm saddened that i\nstill remember that eight years ago to\nthis day yeah and the next day i was\njust like\ni this is not why i got into\nspeedrunning this is not why i got into\nstreaming this like how i feel right now\nsucks and my self-worth is plummeted to\nnothing and i i genuinely wrote a paste\nbin saying i think i'm done streaming\nactually we're just saying a lot because\ni i love it and uh but i didn't i i\ndidn't know if i could go on any further\ndealing with that crap ever again so\nmichael can you tell me a little bit\nabout what the last few years have been\nlike so let's say 2015 to 2022\nwell this is where it gets totally\ndifferent um so i um i get into working\nout actually it actually started working\nout until until um until\n20\nlate 2014 like like\ni don't know it might have been like\ndecember or whatever here um\nand i um\ni i went full time by 2015. at first i\nhad a full-time sub goal of 400 subs to\nbe able to like you know\nlower my experiences and live off of\nthat but by 2015 i'd i or by july of\n2015 i already surpassed 600 subs and i\nwas like okay well what am i scared of\nyou know i said i would do this 200 subs\nago and people are sticking around they\nthey like me um\nlike what i'm doing right now maybe i\nshould stop being scared and like you\nknow make that leap you know i even had\nthis issue actually where i was like\nscared to quit my job you know and i i\neven googled here at desperation\nremember this here i googled uh\nwhy am i scared to quit my job and i'd\nlearn here to yeah fear of change fear\nof habitat and just like it's a huge\nstep for anyone here even if you don't\nlike your job and whatnot um but yeah i\nwent full-time uh july\n2015 and um my plan was to like take the\nnext upcoming yoshi game and make it my\nnext big thing and this is big because\nwhat happened was mario maker one\nreleased september 11 2015. um and i'm\nsure you've heard of it the game where\nyou like you you make the mario levels\nand you share it so um\nthat went super viral that went like\ngiga viral and i happen to be the one\nmaybe the one person who like um was\nspeedrunner savvy but also palatable on\na mainstream twitch scale because of my\nmy waiter swag and whatnot so i was able\nto like you know like you know where\nspeed running required you know flow\nstate into interaction here it was like\nyou know i can meld together because\nit's bite-size mario levels um i played\nthat and i went viral immediately i went\nfrom being like a 400 viewer whatever\nperson to like\n4 000 instantly and then the next day 6\n000 and then the next day 7 000 and then\nthe next day 8 000 and i was a i was an\n8 000 viewer\nperson\nfor months like i i didn't know what to\ndo like this success was so viral and so\nsudden\nthat i i thought every day was gonna be\nthe last days i just like i just kept\ndoing it i would just literally go live\nand do 18-hour\nbinge-a-thons until i couldn't go any\nfurther like i was i tell my roommate yo\nlook 50 bucks i don't know dude here go\ngo to waffle house give yourself\nsomething get me three texas roadhouse\nmeals whatever here and we'll uh i'm\ngonna keep going and so i i just grinded\nto a pulp kept doing that and um\num and that was uh kind of the best and\nthe worst thing there um there are a lot\nof streamers who are definitely jealous\nof what i had going on um i know i went\nviral i was able to take it and retain\nit and keep going with it here um i felt\nlike i was i had no i felt more alone at\nthat time actually whenever i had that\nmonstrous success like the amount of\nlike\ni don't know amount of like scam dms and\nlike um you know people pretend to be a\ngirl and trying to like uh or or\nwhatever right trying to um\ncatfish or whatever here you know i'm a\nbig fan i'm a hot grill and you know\nwhatever california whatever dude\neverything everyone had something to\nsell me now it was just like i felt like\nall my all protocols of communication\nwere compromised\nnothing felt real it felt goes in a\nsimulation there was even a period where\nlike i didn't like uh where i was\nstaying up so late that i was um\ni was going to bed\nat 7 00 pm because i had stayed up so\nlate and continues to push my circadian\nrhythm further and further back that\nthere was actually a three-day period i\ndidn't talk to anybody i hadn't talked\nwith any humans and it was and it was\nreally weird it actually made me like a\nlittle disoriented honestly\nmy communication entirely was like\nvirtual and surrogate through a monitor\nand text for like three days straight\nthat's like a it's a really really weird\nfeeling feels the isolation can be like\nparalyzing in a way\nbecause because like my my my skin\nbecame paper thin like you know because\ni had no nothing to ground myself so my\nmy skin my stakes of like uh critique\nbecause remember you gotta think you're\nright i'm like 8 000 viewers if i if i\nmake like one like xbox joke you know\nlol xbox has no games here an xbox\nfanboy is going to call me you know well\nthey get offended or whatever right and\nthen hurts my feelings because i was\nlike i had no basis for how to like deal\nwith that\nwell anyways yeah i was um\ni became incredibly virally successful\nand i was not prepared for it and the\namount of feedback you get when you like\ni don't know crack a joke or say\nsomething that's like not you know\nanyone can like you know google food and\nimmediately verify that what you said\nwas wrong or whatever i know it's like a\nlot of feedback all the time and like if\nyou don't have like enough ego i guess\nto like endure that it can be pretty\ndraining you know definitely so that\nthat that happened to me a ton and uh so\never since then um of course also here i\ni miss managed or i would say admittedly\ni um\ni\nwasn't the most disciplined i felt\ncontinuously overwhelmed here i had like\nthousands of dms on my discord i had you\nknow twitter was blowing up and whatnot\nhere i i didn't have like you know you\nknow it's like running an empire like\nthat if you're like not used to it it's\nuh\nyou crack under what i would say here\nand i i most certainly did what what\ndoes crack mean\num i stepped away um\nso to speak i guess\nuh how do i put this here so if we\nwell\nsee i'm kind of like i'm dancing around\nthe topic but i guess i should get to\nthe topic here the topic would be that\num\nso if you go back here when i told you\nabout you know when it came to girls\nthat i\ni i didn't know\nhow to deal with insecurity and even\nthough i was working out and i was\ngetting in better shape i thought that\nbeing more physically fit would help me\ndeal with this and i and there was a\npoint where i convinced myself that okay\nif i get like if i get abs like right if\ni really build up and i like sculpt and\neverything here and once i have abs i\nwill\ni will finally have the confidence i\nneed to finally talk to girls i was\nactually scared i was scared there were\nlike a lot of like other\num you know female content creators and\nwhatnot or whatever here and i just\nnever made a move i never made a move\nbecause i was like i was paralyzed by\nfear\ni was afraid of rejection\ni i was afraid that i was afraid of\nrejection but i also was afraid of like\ncoming off as thirsty i felt like i had\nto\ni felt like i always had to be like um\nlike a demigod in a way here i had to\nlike you know i lack genitalia i am i am\nyou know i'm i'm tri-hex the tri-god and\ni need to be above the surface mortal\nlevel of attraction um because this is\ngoing to only distract me from\nwhat my goals are i don't i don't know\nwhere that even comes from here at this\npoint here now maybe maybe that's like a\nincorrect uh assessment here but\ncan i ask you a couple questions about\nthat\nsure why do you have to come off as\nwhat's\nhelp me understand a little bit about\nnot wanting to come across as thirsty\ni don't know it's terrifying man i don't\nknow like\ni saw\nsome other streamers who would like you\nknow hit on girls or whatever and and\nthey would get belittled on it on\ntwitter for like haha you horny haha you\nthirsty or\nand and maybe it goes back here to\nyeah it sounds like you're once again\nplaying yu-gi-oh right where it's like\nif i play this card and i come across as\nthirsty like that's not gonna go well so\ni can't and i'm kind of i can't show\nthem vulnerable you know what i mean\nyeah yeah i don't want to show i don't\nwant to show anyone who follows me on\ntwitter that like i'm um um\ni'm human and i find\nattraction\npossible yeah right yeah like\num so uh that comes into play here but i\nmean um\nkind of a weird question but\ndo you think you were thirsty\num\nsee okay\nthirsty would be like i'm gonna put that\nhere how would we define thirsty um\nnot a negative way no i don't think i\nwas being unreasonable i also didn't hit\nanyone though um\ni was\ni craved companionship that's what\nyou're asking here yeah yeah i\ndefinitely like\num\nfound\nother women attractive and i definitely\nwould have loved to\nhad a girlfriend i had never had a\ngirlfriend at this point i'd i'd been\nperpetually single forever\num i went through some pretty hardships\nin high school and onward um where i was\nuh\ni was a virgin for a lot longer than i\nthought it would be not again not that\nbeing a virgin is an issue here and i\nhate to make it sexual i'm sorry this is\nlike a a topic you don't talk about\nwhatever you're just like um but but in\nin high school and again in small town\nlouisiana is just like you know what\nwhat always was emphasized here is the\nbody count you know every every weekend\ni'm hearing these guys you know brag\nabout how many how many girls they ran\ntrain on and whilst other like stuff\nthat i had no interest in and they just\nwould like\nit's really weird imagine you have other\nlike 16 year old boys who are just\nsitting here\nburning their entire weekend chronically\nlying to other girls about how you're\nthe only one oh baby i love you you're\nmy girlfriend and they're all the whole\nagenda here is to like you know get them\nin an environment where they can they\ncan like finally persuade them by peer\npressure to then partake in sexual acts\nyou know i won't they want to smash and\nit's just but it's you know they're\nwasting like hours with like phone calls\nand and all the other manipulations to\nbe able to maybe get their 15 minutes of\nframe or whatever yeah michael i i'm\nwondering if actually like\nit's interesting right because you're\na part of you maybe is afraid of\nrejection but i'm almost almost kind of\nenvisioning that part of also what\nyou're afraid of is\nor actually part of what you didn't know\nback then was\nthat\nwhen you express interest\nthat interest comes with all of this\ntoxicity\nand so you wanted to maybe demonstrate\nto people that you were interested but\nlike\nnot in a way that\nis like those other people\nyou know that you were interested in\ncompanionship as opposed to smashing\nyeah yeah definitely that yeah\num well\nit gets it gets worse i um so this is\nsomething that i feel like maybe isn't\ngiven enough attention here but like uh\ni was ultimately i was catfished uh\ntwice\num\nand i was devastated that i probably\nfell for the same person just using an\nalt you know and you know i got\ncatfished and i got then the rebound was\nanother\nwoman telling me that she's you know\nshe's another member of my community and\nthat's unfortunate that happened here\nand she wanted to like you know talk to\nme and help me console me through it\nhere uh and whatnot and and that that\nwas also a catfish and just like at that\npoint i was i was burned so i um i\nwas devastated can you tell me can you\ntell me what you mean by catfished\nso by catfish i mean there was a um\nthere was a person who was presenting\nthemselves as what they are not um this\nwas a\num\nsomeone used pictures of some some\npretty like female cosplayer um\nand i i i thought they were real i\nthought they were thought they really\nwant to be my friend i i had never had\nalso for context here i i kind of have\nnev i never had had a friend who was a\ngirl before i um\nagain when i say here like i'm talking\nlike like genuinely like terrified of\nlike\nmiss speaking or\nor making an idiot myself in front of in\nfront of women so i just i i just kind\nof put it off forever i felt in comfort\naround guys because i didn't feel judged\nbut\nmaybe\nmay go back here to some rejections i\nhad in high school where i was told you\nknow uh that\nthey didn't they you know i was a loser\nand whatnot so the reason i asked about\ncat fishing is is because i'm still a\nlittle bit confused because sometimes\nwhen people catfish\nyou know they're there's actually a\nromantic attraction but they will use\nfake pictures and things like that to\ntry to advance a relationship almost\ncreate like some emotional bond which is\nkind of manipulative in nature and then\nwhen the mask comes off\nbut the person so i've i've heard of two\nkinds of catfishing one which is you\nknow\ndeveloping a genuine emotional\nrelationship that's based on\na lack or they're genuine or they're\nreal emotions let's call them that way\nbut sort of like false advertisements\nand a lack of trust at the beginning and\nthen the other kind of catfishing that\ni've heard about is is really in a sense\neven more predatory and there's like\nit's not even a woman there's no\nromantic interest on the other side\nyou know i've heard of cat fishing is\nkind of like a fear of rejection which\nis why i i false advertise but i really\nam attracted to you or something like\nthat and i've also heard of like\ncatfishing as a way to like screw people\nout of money you know and and so which\none are we talking about with you if\nthat makes sense\num the n1 resources or anything like\nthat here they were just um they were\nthey would never want to\nso they\nthey present some pictures right um i'm\na big fan uh whatever here maybe we\nshould hang out at this coming\nconvention and whatnot here it's kind of\njust like a you know whatever like a\nnonchalant opener and then from there it\nwas like okay well do you want to and\nthey were advancing a little bit you're\nshowing signs that you know i find you\nattractive and whatnot which was very\nvalidating to me here it's like this is\nthe first time i've ever heard from a\nwoman that oh i find you attractive i\nhad never had i hadn't happened yet and\nso um but every time we would try to\npush for you know a phone call or like a\nvideo call or just like any kind of like\nyou know tangibles it just it was always\nlike oh i'm busy and what you know the\nusual the deflection and whatnot and\nthat just happened for like\nalmost three weeks and it was exhausting\nbecause i i wanted to believe so bad\num that okay maybe this maybe this is\nthe time maybe i actually maybe i am\nlovable maybe you know maybe now\nyou know now that i'm in twitch land and\ni'm a validated speed runner and a\nsuccessful streamer maybe now\nall that garbage from high school\nwas just like you know a phase michael\nhas become trihex\nyeah yeah except that it wasn't of\ncourse it was a catfish of course it\nwasn't real and then just i\ngot devastated and i just like i tuned\nout i i stopped streaming for like i\ndon't know like i don't know like almost\nhalf a month honestly which is like a\ndeath sentence at the time to keep\nmomentum up here so like my view count\nplummeted from like\n8k to like 2k because then at that point\neveryone was very eager to like pick up\nmy my momentum from the from dominating\nthe mario maker directory so yeah that\nthat dominance diminished considerably\nwhen i came back at that point even then\nwhen i came back it was because i was\nstreamer guilt i was i was so\noverwhelmingly felt guilty about not\nstreaming here from my you know uh\nloving community and whatnot because\nthey didn't do anything this is nothing\nto do with them it's just one person\nthen i have bad judgment and whatnot but\nyeah that that uh that catfish\ndefinitely like really messed me up well\nmichael it sounds like you've had\na lot of unfortunate experiences a lot\nof struggles over the years imposter\nsyndrome discrimination\npeople sort of taking advantage of\nemotional vulnerabilities almost i mean\nhopefully this isn't is okay to say but\nalmost naivete you know that that you\nwere naive\num and you were looking for\ncompanionship and someone sort of\nsniffed that out\nand\nkind of took advantage of it once and\nthen it sounds like they like\nthe the traumatic first experience then\nmade you emotionally vulnerable to it\nhappening again\nyeah that that was yeah correct yeah i\ngot i got i got a\ncatfished again\nand um and that one was even though this\none i don't know of the same person or\nnot i just like and here's the real\nissue the real issue is that you don't\nget closure like even if you like accuse\nthem like hey look i have definitive\nproof here that you are not who you're\nclaiming to be you're not being\ntransparent right now\nall that happens is it's gonna just\nobfuscate that with more lies like\nthere's gonna they're going to min max\non plausible deniability further and\nfurther and further and use every out\nthey have because how hard can you\nreally put them down you know\nso it's just like you you you so badly\nall this time invested you just it all\nfeels transactional and you feel\nobjectified or and whatever else it may\nbe here and it's like you can't even\nlike seek closure you have to just\nconclude on your own\nthat this is like i'm i'm done being on\nthis merry-go-round of like a\npsychopath\ntime sink and you just get off of it i'm\nsorry if i had to go i just appreciated\nthe phrase min max plausible deniability\nwhich i've never heard before but it's\nit's brilliant\nuh yeah i don't know maybe that's uh no\ni mean i i think you've got away with\nwords dude it's great right and and\nyou're spot on that i think it's it's\nhard right because with some of these\nrelationships\neven when you know the truth you never\nget an admission you never and you're so\nlike no matter what happens\nyou know it's almost like the more you\nsuspect and the more you try to get\nclosure the more smoke screen comes up\nand yeah and so like you're really\nlooking for it right you're looking for\nsome kind of tangibility you're looking\nfor some kind of like admission of guilt\nyou're looking for some kind of\nacknowledgement for what you've been\nthrough but the more you reach for that\nthe more\nyou know intangible it becomes\nyeah so so\nyeah i mean so so michael i noticed\nwe've been talking for a little while is\nthere something in particular that um\nyou think we haven't touched on yet or\nsomething that\num you kind of want to talk about or\npotentially struggling with\nwell um\ni've got more questions but i just want\nto give you a chance to oh uh well um\ni'd say the the the most\nuh recent thing that i i've been really\nlike uh doing better on here is probably\nuh productivity struggles and uh ever\nheard of this phrase um unconquerable\ntask syndrome mm-hmm did i ever come\nlike a i don't even know if it's a if\nit's a real like thing or not here i\njust saw it in an article one day and i\nwas like this this feels like what i'm\ndealing with right now there was there\nwas been like a long period where like\num so particularly it comes from burnout\num i've been burned out but didn't know\ni was burned out and then i\nhad productivity struggles because i was\nburned out but wasn't aware of it or in\ndenial of it and then finally whenever i\nwould like you know stream for i don't\nknow six days or whatever straight and i\nfeel like i needed to like really really\nget down to some like communication you\nknow reply some emails um do some\ncommunity management tasks manage my\ndiscord etc here you know run the empire\nso to speak um i just couldn't do it\nlike the matter i would sit there and\njust stare at my monitor and just be\nlike bro i am\ni can i can give it like 20 minutes of\nfocus time and i'm just like totally\ndrained and i'm like bro i cannot\nwhy am i so unproductive here and my my\ngo-to gut reaction was the fact that um\nmaybe have adhd maybe i maybe i need\nlike adderall or ritalin or something\nmaybe i like i need to i need to go i\nneed to be 100 today because i'm so\nbehind in everything here i gotta i\ngotta stream you know i try to stream\nyou know um eight hours a day try to do\nat least five days a week usually doing\nsix days a week here you know i try to\nshove like\ni don't know like 80 hours worth of\nstuff in a 40 hour\nwork week on my end here and get some\nother stuff done and just like\num and i just felt like i couldn't i\ncouldn't get it and and the guilt the\nguilt felt overwhelming honestly and\nthat was uh that was really uh dragging\nme down for years because i'm just like\nhow do these other streamers do it i'm\ncontinuously comparing to them and i'm\nlooking how sensible they are i'm just\nlike people who came after me who came\nafter me you know i feel like by being a\ntwitch boomer i'm i'm i'm i'm the one\nhere who's stagnant because they're the\nones who are able to like see more\nobjectively maybe here comparatively\nlike how what the new meta is and what\nnot and i don't i don't see it i don't\nknow because that's something i've been\nstruggling with recently here but um can\nyou tell me about unconquerable task\nsyndrome\nso it's just like whenever whenever\nthere's a task to take care of here like\nlike you need to\nfor example let's say you want to zero\nuh you want to zero out your inbox you\nhave like 100 unread emails just want to\nkind of go through there and you want to\nget in there file them by you know\nwhether it's a receipt purchase or\nwhatever here and kind of get it knocked\nout right\nyou can do like\ni find what happens i want to like make\nit like a smaller incremental step\nprocess you know okay let's let's let's\nlet's categorize 100 emails first\nthen skim them for anything valuable\nthen you know delegate them to where\nthey got to go and whatnot\nand i'll have fun like taking like a dry\nerase board just like you know\nwriting all like\nthe planning of the task is fun\nexecuting the task is where i'm like i'm\nstuck and i'm like and then i end up\nlike i don't know like i\nwhether or no how you unconquer it is\ndifferent on each person here but for me\ni end up like spazzing out and going in\ndifferent things here like in the 100\nemail inbox end up like seeing here an\nemail from like\ni don't know whatever like\nhellofresh or whatever and i'm like and\ni'll go over that website and just look\nat that and you know oh this looks cool\nhere and just i can't focus i just i'm\nso my attention span is already at like\n99 consumed so like i i don't have much\nleft to really give here because i don't\nreally want to be doing this right now\ni i want to just like\ni can't get there i feel this\noverwhelming need to do the task but i\njust cannot simply\nexecute on the focus of it\nplanning it is fun but doing it is like\njust i'm\nunable to do it and have you made profit\nand i feel i feel i feel very very\nguilty i'm just like bro i i sit here in\nfront of the computer just like for like\nan hour and a half it's like okay\ni give up i'm gonna go for a walk and\ncome back and figure it out here and it\nends up being here it's like i'll spend\nlike a whole like nine hours on my day\noff\nand i'll have gotten that one thing done\na hundred emails filed and then so you\ndo you do\ndo it\nat a slug's pace yes at a depressingly\nslow pace with a lot of breaks in\nbetween yeah and michael is it okay i\nmean we could talk about this for the\nnext you know 15 20 30 minutes if that's\nokay with you and try to understand\nwhat's going on\num sure well one it's it's gotten a lot\nbetter now i will i will say here this\nis like what i've recently been dealing\nwith here but i'm happy to report i'm\ndoing a lot better yeah so help us\nunderstand how did it get better\num i did the unprecedented so i've been\nfull-time streaming on twitch since july\n2015.\ni had i've i was scared genuinely scared\nto take a break i never took breaks\neven going to evo going to twitchcon\ngoing to other events always was like a\ncross-pollination\nof opportunity i wouldn't really call it\noff the grid i didn't even know really\nwhat a real vacation was i i i've never\ni was a gamestop employee into a waiter\ninto this so i've never like i've never\nhad like a job with the security and\nluxury of actually having like you know\npto um\npaid time off et cetera so i i i\nwouldn't know i i i was blessed on you\nknow i i know that warrior right now is\nincredibly privileged being a you know\nwhatever top zero zero one percent\ntwitch streamer content creator whatever\nhere so i know that my job is something\nthat's you know incredibly envied so i\nhave i feel like i have very little room\nto actually like\ncomplain about what i do or you know or\nor vent about you know what i go through\nme me me but i've never had a vacation\nin that regard so i didn't even know\nwhat like what like an actual\nthe actual objective of a vacation being\nrejuvenative i had never entertained\nthat i was always just like okay well i\nwent to you know i went to twitchcon\nthat was that was fun play work whatever\nhere and i come back i keep going here\nso um but yeah i took um for the first\ntime ever may of this year may 2022 i\ntook an entire month off\ni didn't plan to i was gonna do two\nweeks off but i i\ni realized here that okay i'm actually\nreally burned out let me just take two\nweeks obviously what happens here and\neven then i was scared to even admit\nthat it took me until like may 13th like\nafter not being live for like 10 days to\nfinally admit\nyo i gotta i gotta i gotta keep going\nhere i gotta heal like i can see i need\nto i need a detox\ni'm terminally online and i and i'm i've\nbeen working for so long here i feel\nuncreative i come live and it's just\nbecause it's the routine the motions but\ni don't really know what i'm doing\nanymore\nthat whole month off is what led to me\num\nfinally really seeing at the core of\nwhat was going on there\num\nand and it seems like taking a break\nreally helped you with some of this this\nunconquerable task stuff\nyeah yeah because i was able to finally\nlike so i i find for example here i'm\nnot really able to reflect on how i'm\ndoing until i'm away from that this\nenvironment so i'm in my office that i'm\nin whatever 80 hours we go over here and\ncan i really reflect on how to improve\nmy workflow my tasking and uh and\neverything in between here when there's\nalways the looming um threat of the\naccess to streaming you know if i'm if\ni'm only getting like one task done in a\nnine hour span\nor i could just go live and stream today\nand at least get eight hours knocked out\nthere which one am i to do so that's\nusually what ends up happening i say\nokay so i feel incredibly guilty and\neven more defeated on the fact that i\ncould have just streamed so until i get\naway\nfrom this office of turmoil i found i\nwasn't really able to reflect so once i\ndid that and went away i was able to\nthink okay okay well that what is a what\nis in theory what is the structure of a\nof a productive trihex day\non a day on on a day off you know how do\ni make gym and fitness synergize rather\nthan like antagonize yeah well uh the\nflow of streaming\nand so what i'm kind of hearing you say\nis that and this is really common by the\nway that\nwe have if we have easy ways of being\nproductive\nand there are sometimes tasks that we\nstruggle with that\nin theory should be\ntake a small amount of time\nbut what we always end up doing is i\nthink you beautifully said it\nbeautifully that i could waste nine\nhours doing one hour of work or i could\ndo the eight hours of work that's easier\nfor me to do\nand at the end of the day i can have\ndone eight hours of work or one hour of\nwork and so what ends up happening is\nbecause our our you know our brain is\nknows how to do particular things what\nwe end up doing is we choose the same\neasy work\nthereby\nbeing more efficient\nand we never actually get around to the\nquote-unquote\nhard work which is going to be less\nefficient\nand and\nyou just can't justify the cost to\nyourself right of taking a break from\nstreaming like okay like i can stream\nfor a day or i can take a day off\nwhich also i wonder a little bit about\nyou know if this goes back to\neven a case of the don't wants or being\nidle forever right because like you're\nsaying you've never taken a break and it\nsounds like early on you were you know\ntaught like hey no gap years like gap\nyears isn't something that people like\nus do\nvacation isn't something that people\nlike us do\nyou know i do admit it took me a long\ntime to be to me that the desire for\nvacation is not weakness\num\ni can tell\nwhen i was talking to other people on a\nsubconscious level i would associate\nvacation and recreation as weakness\ni don't know if that maybe that comes\nfrom being a waiter where it's gig\neconomy and\nbeing a waiter was one of the very few\njobs that access to when i was 18 years\nold that like let me make money and more\nof it proportional to my effort you know\ni found many jobs you're paid in the\namount and usually you can get the work\ndone in like i don't know half the time\nbut you're not really paid more to get\nit done half time so you just kind of\nend up padding the work ultimately your\ntime is indirectly being perceived as\nlike worthless because you're not being\nrewarded for being more efficient you're\njust rewarded for right you know typical\nstuff right so\nmaybe being awaited for so long is kind\nof what reinforced to me just like\nhustle mentality of just like well or\nreally i'm gonna say hustle because\nthat's not the right that's a lot it's\nlike a loaded turn these days here but\nmore like\nmake the most of what you got you know\nnever um yeah never never idle maximize\nyour potential is that that way i'd put\nit here\nyeah so um michael let me ask you a\ncouple questions or actually can i just\nshare a couple of thoughts that i\nthought you know you've shared that are\nreally interesting absolutely\num so the first thing that i want to\nkind of say is that it sounds like\nyou've really been on a journey for a\nwhile and that there were you know\nthings that you can be proud of and in\nareas that you really struggled what i'm\nreally hearing is\nfrom being you know a young kid\nwho liked nerdy things before nerdy\nthings were cool\nto you know the passion of yu-gi-oh\nwhich which still traumatizes you to\nthis day\num and we haven't opened the can of\nworms of why you don't like yu-gi-oh now\nwhich i heard you say you know it's a\ncompletely different reason\num\nand then you know becoming a speed\nrunner becoming a streamer uh\ntransitioning to full-time always\njuggling so many balls\nand\ni i think what what really is remarkable\nabout hearing your story is\nthe way that you capture moments of\ndifficulty\nso this overthinking pyramid of\nconfusion you know can't afford a case\nof the don't wants min maxing\nplausibility\nstruggling to believe in yourself\nstruggling to find inner peace\nperceiving\nyou know you're not good in your own\nhead\nyou feel guilty for wanting to take a\nbreak\nthere's so much about what you've said\neven some of the stuff in terms of\nromance in terms of like\nyou know wanting a companion but being\ngrowing up in frankly kind of a\nmisogynistic environment where like\nyou were afraid of being perceived\nin a negative light right because that's\nwhen you were growing up the people who\nsaid that\nwere\nbeing disingenuous\nbut if you genuinely want a connection\nlike how can you\nshare that with someone without\nsignaling to them oh i'm i'm thirsty and\nthere's just so much stuff that you've\nkind of gone through\neven feeling alone when you're kind of\nlike successful\ni mean\nthere's so much that you've gone through\nthat i think people actually like\na lot of people in our community\nstruggle with whether it's imposter\nsyndrome whether it's burnout whether\nit's this unconquerable task issue of\nlike\nthere's some work that's very easy for\nme to do and it's just so hard for me to\ndo other things\nwhat what would you share with people\nwho have resonated with a piece of your\nstory like how did you what would you\nwhat would you say to them or any advice\nthat you have for them\nabout if they're yeah\nwell first i want to say uh you you blow\nme away just now when you when you tied\nthe uh the the the negative connotation\nof being thirsty or even uh seeking\ncompanionship with like tying it back to\nthe misogynistic uh high school boys i\nhad never thought about that actually i\nhad never thought here that maybe i\nmaybe that's where my association bias\ncame into play that that's brilliant i\nnever even thought about that\nuh thank you for that yeah of course um\nthe uh my my what advice would i give if\npeople are resonating with what we're\nsaying right now would be um\nagain i really do think here uh\ni i do believe that happiness is like\nbeing more self-aware so like\nperhaps like understanding what you're\nfeeling will help you be able to figure\nout\nuh why you're feeling what you're\nfeeling that's kind of a broad thing i\ndon't even mean stuff on your toes there\nwhat not but i i usually use that so and\nwhat that means is you gotta reflect\nmore often you gotta like\ni found the days to be much more\nmanageable so okay before here it's like\ni feel like\ni would wake up and i'm already like\nthis high in in quicksand or water like\ni'm like it's like it's eight it's 8 a.m\nand i'm already about to like fall apart\ni'm like where do i even begin i got you\ni'm i'm walking around the house doing\nthe pacing just like or like the the the\nfootball shake maneuver or whatever it's\ncalled here the juking and i'm just like\nwhat are we i don't know where to go\nlike i need to be live in two hours and\ni can get into like i need to like eat\ngym shower like my day's already failed\nmy day's already failed and i find that\nif you're if you're going through that\nfeeling of like what feels like damn\nnear suffocation\nyou got to slow it down and you have to\nbe able to reflect on and idealize here\nwhat is my ideal day and like what what\ndo i like what is priority here because\nyou're putting time somewhere anywhere\neverywhere but there is definitely a\npriority of what's being of what's\nallocating your time and whatnot so how\nimportant is it to you to like figure\nout like\num what you want to get in control of i\nfind it once i started getting in\ncontrol of my day it got a lot a lot lot\nbetter okay\nso it sounds like being more aware\nreally sort of thinking about\nprioritization organization\nyeah yeah\nyou know and being able to reflect will\nmean that you acknowledge or maybe\nperhaps you have like you're trying to\nshove 30 hours of stuff in a 24-hour day\nand and theory you can do this if you're\noperating at 140 non-stop here but can\nyou but but can you really sustain\nworking at 140 percent for\n18 hours straight of or 16 hours\nstraight of being awake here probably\nnot so you need to like you know and and\nand what happens is like i did think\nthat and therefore i always would attack\nmyself my own critiques of not being\nable to do the 140 workload daily every\nday all day no breaks continuously and\nthen you know you enter a chain of\nself-loathing and then i just feel like\nthey also combine that with like you\nknow whatever metrics driven workload\nyou have here so you know i'm seeing sub\ncount view count you know whatever it is\nin our streamer space and what not that\nyou that you look at and it's like\nit's all declining and i feel like i'm\nfailing i'm failing and i don't know how\nto stop failing so i feel like i'm i\nfeel like i'm broken i feel like i just\nthis wasn't a problem before and it is\nnow i don't even know how to fix it that\nsounds\nvery relatable and also terrifying this\nsort of sense that\nyou start to fail you can feel yourself\nfailing you can see yourself failing you\ndon't know how you got here it feels\nlike success is kind of far away it\nfeels like\nyou know\nyou get almost\nit's like the rug gets pulled out from\nunder you\nand you're kind of spinning and you\ndon't know how to find stability in\nthose moments\ngood way to put it here yeah you you\nfeel like you're not in control so uh\nyeah michael let me ask you i i've had a\ntickling question in the back of my mind\nand and you know we don't have to talk\nabout this if it's uh uncomfortable for\nyou but we've talked about the\nchallenges you've had in relationships\ni'm a little bit curious you also hinted\nthat you hadn't had a relationship at\nthat point\nhow i mean have you managed to kind of\nfind healthy relationships like romantic\nrelationships over time or\nyou know i did while while the catfish\nand all that was the bad news i'm happy\nto report here that uh me and my\nwonderful girlfriend got together uh\nnovember of 2015 and we've been together\nsince wow\nyeah we have uh we've been together\num me and jessica we've been together\nsince like i don't know like seven years\nnow onward yeah she's great\nshe's my rock she's definitely like\nthe best biggest positive change i've\nhad since i can't even recall when my\nbest friend and then summon all that can\nyou is it okay if i ask a couple\nquestions about the relationship\nsure\nyeah how did y'all get together\nwell it's actually kind of funny so um\nwhat happened was i was playing mario\nmaker one day and actually i want to say\nparticularly it was a day that like\ni was frustrated with like maybe the\ncatfish or whatever i don't even know um\ni was really really mad about something\nhere and i was particularly distant that\nday while playing mario maker and people\ncan tell i was visibly distraught i\ndidn't feel like streaming this day but\ni thought i had to kind of push through\nand do anyway this is like one of those\ndays in november of 2015 where i was\nlike i was already gone for 10 days but\ni came back because of overwhelming\namount of guilt and just kind of like\njust bitter right just like not my usual\nlike charismatic self here which you got\nwhich by the way here again it's really\ntough with streaming because like you\nknow i feel like for me and you when we\ngo live it's like\nthe whole the bottom fifty percent of\nemotions are it's not an option you get\nyou need to like you just get there you\nknow if me and you were if you were like\na line cook you know your emotional\nstatus on being a cook wouldn't affect\nthe food output right you don't have to\ninteract with any other than your fellow\nline mates and your and your head chef\nor whatever here but with streaming it's\nlike if i come here like pre-tilted\npre-salty pre-aggravated pre-annoyed the\nfuse is a lot smaller there so i may end\nup becoming more argumentive or\ndefensive or excessive or you know you\nknow how this whole thing works right so\nyeah this clearly i was not in the best\ndate here and um she saw that i was\nupset and she she donated\num using her her tag black anti-venom\nbut you know i i didn't i didn't know\nhow to read it because it wasn't\ncapitalized correctly or whatever so i i\nsaw a black ant\nblack gift i've been being a spider-man\nreference that was actually pretty cool\num but i saw that it was black and\ndonating and i i thought it was like\nsome i remember reacting saying here\nthat it was a\nokay\nokay uh because they were they were\nsaying something that's kind of\naffectionate or whatever and um\ni was like okay thank you you basement\ndwelling neckbeard i don't i don't care\nwhatever\ni actually snapped at the donation\nhonestly which is pretty pretty rude of\nme i will admit now my proudest moment\nhere but then my chat they searched\nbecause i said black ants i didn't even\ngive any thought here what the whole\nwhole name was it was um they searched\nher name saw she had an instagram saw\nshe had a twitch on her instagram so she\nactually twitch streamed and they were\nlike and my discord was like yo yo yo\nhe's real bro and she's cute you gotta\ncheck her out bro so i like you know and\ni i panicked here because they were all\nlike berating her and telling her you\nknow that that's not usually trihex he\ndoesn't usually do that kind of thing\nhe's sorry about that they were\napologizing for me for which i didn't\neven know they were even doing so then i\nhad so i felt like i had to then like\nyou know reach out to her and tell her\ni'm sorry if my commute has been like\nberating you or whatever and then uh\nand then from there we started talking\num the ice was already broken you know\nthe hardest part the part where actually\ni initiate the whole like\ni think you're i think you're cute maybe\nwe should hang out sometimes something\nlike that that already happened because\ntwitch\nwait so let me let me understand this\nproperly michael so this relationship\nthe rock of your life that you've been\nin for seven years started off by you\ncalling your girlfriend of seven years a\nneckbeard\na basement dwelling neckbeard\nyes and then and then just to be clear\nyou use the word berate but it sounds\nlike actually your twitch community went\nto bat for you and did damage control\nwith her\nthey they did but i didn't know the time\nhere i i just they were they were like i\ndidn't if they were mass harassing her\nor what i didn't know i didn't know\nexactly uh what was going on so just to\nbe clear okay and maybe i'm simplifying\nthings but\nyou called your girlfriend a neckbeard\nand then twitch went and did damage\ncontrol and you all have been seven this\nis the largest contribution i've ever\nheard of honestly that's not an\nexaggeration\nfrom twitch chat\nyeah no they they they\nfound out she's a real person said hey\ndumbass\nstop stop treating her this way she's\nlegit\nyeah\nand then we're also like hey he's not\nusually like this give our bro a chance\nit is true because i no i didn't tell\nthem i had got double catfished at the\ntime here yeah of course um right yeah\nbut i just like i'm like okay yeah\nyou're being affectionate or whatever\nhere maybe i don't i don't know i i\ndidn't i didn't believe what i had lost\nhumanity i was so bitter at that point\ni was on some like toby maguire\nspider-man three vibes i was just like\nyou know edge i was edgy at that point i\nwas like bro i'm so over human at this\npoint that that's gotta be the best how\nwe met story i've i've ever heard\nyeah actually i wanna say it's a\nhighlight i got it it's you know highest\ni've never leave it on twitch i think\nit's like buried in there somewhere\nafter i have to find it for y'all one\nday but yeah it's it's it's somewhere in\nthere yeah but yeah we've been\nyeah i mean we've been together ever\nsince we did we did long distance for\nabout nine months and then um she wanted\nto move down to louisiana she liked what\nshe saw and uh we've been together right\nshe did\nyeah yeah she uh dude i'm i'm a\ni'm a charismatic playboy i went all out\nman i was like i had when she would come\nit was like when we were a long distance\nshe'd come for like she should get three\ndays off of work she would have like 72\nhours or whatever they should go fly\nback sunday evening i had everything\nplanned out and i was like yeah we're\ngonna go to this park we're gonna go do\nthis thing we're gonna go i'm gonna tell\nyou this restaurant here like i was just\nlike it's like 10 years of romantic\nangst\nall like jam packed into nine months of\nlong distance like i was just like i\nwant to show you the world like i'm a\nlad and you're jasmine this is my carpet\ni want to like i've never had someone to\nlike just like\nshare your love share my world with yeah\nshare my world with yeah that sounds\nbeautiful dude\nthank you yeah\num\nand and i and i've and i've learned a\nlot too i've gone through a lot of\nthings you know having to like\nreally balance trihex and then michael\nthe boyfriend that's been like a another\ntask\num that's been a whole other beast i've\nhad i realized i did something pretty uh\nremarkable because once people found out\nthat like me and uh me and jessica got\ntogether and we were long distance for a\nwhile i had others who were who were\ndoing we were like hey i got someone\nhere i'm\ni i've been thinking about entering ldr\ni see that you and you and her made it\nwork y'all successfully united together\nin person how'd you do it so i've had\npeople actually you know reach out for\nit for an effort of advice on on how do\nyou crack the\nwhat's the secret sauce what's the\nweapon next how'd you do it and uh which\nmade me feel pretty means that what i\ndid was pretty remarkable actually\nbecause i feel like a lot of ldr can\njust like linger in the perpetual bit of\ncrap um whether it be insecurities or\nnot or not being transparent enough here\nand all that stuff there which i don't\nwanna i don't know if i'm gonna drown\nthat now but just like yeah i mean can\nyou give me like a five minute rundown\nof of what you think was very helpful in\nyour ldr and and sort of helping it\nsurvive long enough to make it no longer\nlong distance\nsure i so i i i told her in the very\nbeginning here i'm like hey look all\nright i feel like our main objective\nshould be me objective here i'm making\narmaments on game game lingo sure our\nmain objective uh needs to be conquering\ndistance like if we are serious here\nthen we need to establish trust at the\nvery beginning unaccountable\ntransparency and that any insecurity you\nfeel about me feel free to hit me up\nabout it i i feel no animosity or shame\nif you feel the need to bring something\nup here right now because i feel like an\nldr what will happen here is like your\nsmallest insecurity about something will\nfeed\nand erode our trust and i feel like the\nstrongest things we have right now in\nour in our the pills of our the pillows\nof our foundation are going to be\ncommunication and trust so\nhit me up with anything you got here\nwhatever whatever you want to know\nwhatever you need to know i'm i'm i'm\ni'm more than willing to to get that to\nyou so above everything i want this to\nwork i don't want any\nyou know at the time here i was taking\ncare of you know because i'm a streamer\nprolific streamer and she's her maybe it\nwould be like you know it would be like\nhaters who are coming in and gonna throw\neverything they can at her about me that\nmaybe i've said out of context in the\npast here or something like that i don't\nknow i didn't even know what i was\ngetting into honestly i didn't know what\nthe you know it's like it's like it's\nlike having\nknown\nunknowns like i know what i don't know\nversus unknown unknown yeah i don't know\nbut i don't know and this was like a\ncrap ton of unknown unknowns so i was\njust like hit me up here so we we we did\nthat we stopped at very beginning early\non and\num our goal was to conquer distance you\nknow figure out here am i moving to\nwhere you are moving to where i am or\nwhat are we going to do it was like you\nknow what's our student's point we're\ngoing to do this here i feel like we\nneed to see each other more often\nbecause i don't know if i can do this\nwhole like\ni don't know i can do this whole thing\nhere we just linger for like six months\nat a time so like you know maybe can we\ncan we see each other once every six\nweeks is that manageable for your boss\nand whatnot and we try to figure out you\nknow when that was i mean we were\nconstantly communicating on the next\nstep everything was methodical and\nplanned and\num\nwhen it came down to it the the\none people can debatably hear say that\nyou know moving in from ldr after nine\nmonths is kind of fast but\nwe had prepared continuously the whole\ntime through and it was my top priority\ni'd say much more than streaming for the\nfirst time ever actually this was like a\nway bigger to me than streaming was so i\nwas you know i would pretty much stream\nand do like a little six hour stream you\nknow not the trihex tier eight hour\nstream and then i'd be on the phone with\nher like four hours after like i could\nnot wait to talk to her honestly you\nknow i was like okay stream's done i'm\ngone all right you know hey what's up\nbabe what's up babe so um\nbut what the catalyst was that you know\num her lease was gonna renew on her\napartment and i felt like i uh and it\nwas like you know either another nine\nmonths onward of more ldr or drop the\nlease and make the move happen now so i\nwas like what do you want to do and she\nwas like let's do it now on that note i\nchose deliberately to um\nfly to her and then rent a van and then\ndrive it back down that way the\ntransition\nfrom her state to louisiana was like\nmore gradual i felt like her flying here\nwould have been like a really abrupt\nthing and i wanted to make a memory out\nof the transition so even though it was\nactually more expensive i chose to\ndrive back with her and make it more\nof a memory\nyeah i mean i i'm noticing michael a\ncouple things the first is that it\nsounds like you y'all have both been\nquite thoughtful and intentional about\nhow you manage this relationship\num\nthe second thing that i i notice and\nit's kind of bizarre because i've seen\nthis time and time and time again that\noftentimes the healthiest relationships\nthat i've encountered over the course of\nmy career my life are usually like\npretty idiotic in some way\ni i i mean that honestly like because\nlike i i'm not it's not a judgment it's\njust like\nthe the best relationships usually have\nsomething that\nhonestly would be like okay moving\nstraight from a long distance\nrelationship to moving in after nine\nmonths seems fast right a lot of people\nwould say like oh that's actually like a\nrelationship mistake that's you know\nand and there's some there's something\nhonestly there's something stupid about\nlove like in a good way\nyou are not wrong the logic center is\nlike i think i'm a pretty logical person\ni was the honeymoon phase i was like on\nanother world yeah i couldn't even\nexplain it that's crazy and i i've seen\nthat i mean i certainly know in in my\nrelationship for example like you know\nmy person is now my wife should have\nreally should have dumped me like\nfor a couple years like because i wasn't\ndoing nothing\nyou know i was like kind of complete\njust not going anywhere or doing\nanything and she just\nshe really\nand she was crushing it in life\nand and she really should have traded up\nyou know imo but\nand and so we you know we have we've had\nour fair share of idiocy in in our\nrelationship too but i kind of see that\nand i think it's like\nyeah\nso thank you so much for sharing\nabsolutely any questions for me before\nwe we sort of think about wrapping up\num\nquestions for you\num\ni guess\nhere's let me think here um\nthe one i could think of here that uh\nmaybe you could could help me understand\nhere is like\ni i think i'm coming the terms now with\nlike what i'm calling here streamer\nguilt\num\nhave you ever found it an easier way to\nlike balance that like i usually find\nwhen i if i feel guilty about like i'm\nnot doing enough for my okay the thing\nhere is i always feel like\ni'm not worthy of the community i have i\nhave a bunch of loving people who have\nbeen around some of them you know 100\nmonth plus subs and it's kind of insane\nit's kind of like daunting even think\nhere that you've been around like the\namount of roller coasters i've been\nthrough\nwith like just like not\nfiguring out myself and whatnot and\nthey've been around for 100 plus months\nis like insane to me\nhow do you ever come to terms with like\nyou know\ni i've\ni'm not\ni don't know i'm not you're fulfilled\nwith how you're performing as a streamer\ndoes that make that success yeah yeah so\nso let me just unpack that a little bit\nso you mentioned streamer guilt\nuh can you tell me a little bit about\nthat\ni feel\ni feel like i've never made like the con\nthe peak form content that my community\ndeserves i feel like it's like a if\nthey're thirsty i've never quenched\ntheir thirst in terms of like\nmaybe i have to them but i haven't to me\nokay so i feel i feel guilty about that\nespecially when i take off like days and\nstuff to like i still feel guilty about\ntaking days off and i'm trying to\ncurrently adhere to like a some kind of\nlike you know five days on two days off\nper week kind of thing just just so i\ncan have a better work-life balance i've\nseen here what that does to my mental if\ni don't do that but i still feel\nguilty\nwhat do you do with that guilt\num i\nuh\ngood question i don't i don't\ninternalize it i mean do you like\ndistract yourself do you like do you\nthink it's legitimate do you try to\nprocess it do you talk it through with\nyour girlfriend like where does it go\nyeah sometimes i'll talk with my\ngirlfriend about and go walk our dog\ndaily and\nit will like usually um\ni don't i don't know that's a good\nquestion actually i need to think that\none more honestly i just know that i\nfeel um\ni know that\nonce i once i got subscriber right once\ni got like once i have like a a paying\npatronage that happened here the\neverything changed like july 2013 when i\ngot a partner and like it was at that\npoint here that i never like taking a\nday off\npreviously before the subscribers\nexisted\nit felt i could make taking a day off be\nconstructive whereas now i feel like\ntaking days off is usually it feels more\ndestructive i always feel like i\ni should be doing more or something like\ni have to like learn to enjoy\nthe downtime and being idle and not like\nalways need to do more here because i\nfeel like all my competition is always\nlive and they're always doing something\nthey're always outdoing me yeah but then\nagain maybe also i also work out so\nmaybe it's a whole different thing\nbecause i feel like i i need more\nrecovery and whatnot i don't know it's\nhard\nhard to say okay like how do you how do\nyou come with peace of just like not\nlike\nhow do you come with peace\non\nnot always being on i guess maybe great\nso\ni'm so\nmy answer for you michael is going to be\na little bit different\noddly enough i i feel like i do have an\nanswer so take that with a grain of salt\nright\nbut\nhere here's what i see in you\nso the first thing is that\ni'm going to take a slightly more\nspiritual perspective if that's okay as\nopposed to psychological\nsure so michael you've got a voice in\nyou\nthat calls you\nto do more do better\nokay\nokay i think if you want to do right by\nyour community\nthat's a good thing\ni think what could be going on sometimes\nwhat happens is when we have a spiritual\nvoice within us\nour\npsychological hang ups or complexes\nwill hijack and twist what is a good\nintention into a negative result\nso what i what i think is going on here\nis if you have gratitude for example\nand you want to make content for your\ncommunity and that's what drives you to\nbe a streamer that's actually a healthy\nthing\nand for you to say you know for their to\nbe a part of you to say i haven't done\nwhat i set out to do i have not done\nwhat i'm on this earth to do\nthat's actually like i think that's a\nhealthy voice\nso some people may say like oh you know\nlike kind of get rid of the guilt like\nacknowledge be grateful like you know\nthis is all\nbut i think actually what's kind of\ngoing on here is i'm noticing a parallel\nbetween\nyou know michael and try hex and\nbecoming number one in the world setting\na standard for yourself that until you\nreach that standard you're not going to\nbe satisfied\nand so there's something going on here\nwhere i i think what's actually\nhappening is there's a genuine desire to\ncreate content and do right by your\ncommunity which i actually think you\nshould lean into\ni think that's what's going to actually\nmake you the best content creator the\nchallenge is going to be that\nfor some reason you're not letting\nyourself be patient in that\naccomplishment\nyeah yeah right so so this is the kind\nof thing we're doing right by your\ncommunity is not something that you need\nto do in six months it's not something\nyou need to do in nine months or 12\nmonths this is like\ni mean you've been you're a boomer\nstreamer let's say but like you're not\ndone right like content creation is\ngoing to continue this community people\nhave been subbing for 100 months there's\ngonna be a hundred more\nespecially i think you're sort of like\nan old soul and you can kind of offer a\nlot of guidance to people in this\ncommunity even sharing your stories of\nyour like your romantic relationship and\nthings like that the reason that we have\nthese kinds of conversations is because\ni can guarantee you\nthat even today there's a black kid\nwho's in a small rural town who's\nplaying you know like whatever kids play\nnowaday and they're terrified that girls\nare not going to like them because of\nyou know the way that their hair is and\nthere's no like barber that knows how to\nhandle their hair so they just get\ncrappy haircuts um i recently saw a\nstudy that actually like a a remarkable\nnumber of african or african-american\nchildren\nface bullying and discrimination\nspecifically due to their hair\nlike more than 50\nand we as a society actually don't know\nhow to like handle like most places that\nwill cut hair don't know actually how to\nhandle\nhair from particular ethnicities and\nthere's like like psychological studies\nthat have been done on this\nand so this is the kind of thing where i\ni encourage you to do right by your\ncommunity but also be a little bit\ncareful about i think what's getting in\nthe way is your ego\nthat recognize that you doing right by\nyour community doesn't have to do with\nyou\nit's not actually about you and whether\nyou it's like\nit's really about service right so and\nthis is where like i'd encourage you to\nlike take a step back and sort of\nacknowledge that this is a this is a\nmain quest\nit's a long-term quest\nand that this is like a long haul that\nyou don't have to fix everything right\nnow\nand think a little bit about the part of\nyou that is fundamentally unsatisfied\nbecause i'm hearing a theme throughout\nyour life that you've been unsatisfied\nwith your performance at times there's\nalways been guilt there's always been\nburnout there's always been like you\nknow i can't take a break there's all\nkinds of things about a case of the\ndon't wants and being idle forever which\ni think like insert themselves into your\nthinking even to this day\nyeah maybe so this is the kind of thing\nwhere i would really encourage you to\nnot\nto try to do right by your community but\noddly enough acknowledge that you may\nnever be able to\nand that that's actually okay\nbecause i think it's that last part that\nyou know you can yo like and eve i don't\nknow if this kind of makes sense but\neven when we talk about you grinding\naway at yoshi's island at the age of\nlike 16 or whatever you know recording\nthings on vhs\nthat\nthat was about you giving it your all\nthe flow state really isn't about\naccomplishing it's really about being\nfully present in the moment and giving\nit your all\nand i think the more that you can\nacknowledge that what your community\ndeserves from you\nis not a particular outcome\nbut that you offer them what you can\nright try hex with all of his growth all\nof his xp\nand all of his flaws\ncan't necessarily fix your community but\nwhat you owe them these people who are\nactually a little bit responsible for\nthe relationship that you're in now\nright that you should try to give back\nis service\nand i think the more that you can and\nbecause this is the key thing is is\nstepping away from our ego which is what\ngives us guilt because this is kind of\nwhere i know it's what i'm saying is\nsort of abstract so let me try to\nexplain\nyou can't be guilty unless\nyou have a sense of self right if i say\noh i'll look like let's say like let's\ntake this conversation so i feel guilty\nin this conversation because i haven't\nhelped you enough\nbut that i can't feel guilty for that\nunless i have an expectation of how much\ni should be able to help you\ni see and that comes from my identity\nthat i'm dr k and i should be able to\nhelp oh my god i didn't live up to what\ndr k is capable of and then i feel\nguilty\nwhereas\nyou know so the way that i kind of\nhandle that is to show up and\nacknowledge that actually dr k ain't\nright like i actually have no idea if i\ncan help you or not help you all i know\nis that i'm going to show up and i'm\ngoing to give whatever i have to offer\nand for some people it may be enough and\nfor other people it won't be enough\nand in the same way\nare you on this earth to support this\ncommunity that has given you so much 100\nso you're going to give them what you\nhave to offer\nis it going to be enough is it not going\nto be enough is trihax enough is michael\nenough like it's not your place to to\ngive them enough\nit's only your place to give them what\nyou have\ni see\nhow does that sound to you\nyou you you nailed it when you said um\nsecond to last point you said right\nthere about the um about like i i have\nto i have to win i have to give it like\ni have to have to accomplish the thing\nhere\nit was kind of like what resonated with\nlike it was like a\nis it a fault of the effort or was it a\nfault of the pre-calibrated expectation\nor even the entitlement of what you know\ni i need to\nget to this point even if\neven if it asks for 140 effort yeah so\nyeah i think if we look at it\npsychologically there's actually\nresearch that shows it's a\npre-calibrated expectation\nso if you actually look at the science\nof entering the flow state which leads\nto optimal performance stepping away\nfrom expectation is one of the key\nprerequisites of entering the flow state\nwow okay that's a\ni got homework to do then i didn't even\nknow that yeah so it's really\ninteresting and i think those\nexpectations in turn have to do with ego\nright because how do you set\nexpectations they have to do with okay\nwhat is trihex capable of\nand and you know you're bringing up a\nreally good point because uh oh this is\nthe the bad thing is that i've\ndefinitely stigmatized emotions a ton\ni've i've remember seeing myself a ton\nat the worst of my pit of that has\nbeen how salty until tilted i've gotten\nhas been\nwhy must i get salty and annoyed why\ncan't i be the emotionless robot and\njust play perfect and just why can't i\njust grind practice\ngain xp and just be perfect in six\nmonths why must why must these emotions\nhold me down from being able to just\ngrind and get the and get get the\nresults yeah so i dreaded the process so\ni try hex let me just like let's\nunderstand that so what are you doing in\nthat moment\nyou're\nmoving away from the person that you are\nbecause emotions are a part of you and\nyou're human\nright\nand you're beating yourself up for being\na human and not living up to the\nexpectation of what you have in your\nmind\nyeah you have this idea of trihex and\nthen here's michael\nand it goes back to like my first\nquestion what do you go by yeah\ni actually thought about that earlier i\nwas like wait what do you ask the tag\nthing\ni i couldn't even answer that one like\nlike like i couldn't even give you an\nugly answer i had to give you the or i\ncouldn't give you a pretty answer to the\nugly truth yeah i'm like\nright complicated so so i think at the\nend of the day you are\nyou're not trihex you're michael\nright like you are this person who's\nflawed who has negative emotions who has\nguilt who can sometimes only do one hour\nof work in in nine hours and the truth\nof it is that's okay\nyour guilt actually comes from not what\nyou owe them but what you expect from\nyourself\nright you're you're letting yourself\ndown because you're not living up to\nthat expectation\ni'm not hearing your community\ncomplaining\nno they they're they're homies right\nyeah they're they and so this is all\ncoming from you and coming from what you\nexpect from yourself and this is where\ni'm not saying don't give everything\nyou've got and this is a medicine\nfrankly like i mean this is a lesson i\nfrankly learned in medicine not in india\nwhen i was like studying to become a\nmonk but like what you realize as a\ndoctor is that you can't save a life\nyou can\ntry\nyou know but like\nyou can try yeah\nyou can you can try but you can't uh\nyeah that's all you can but what more\ncan you do right you can't with juan yep\nbeyond your own strength beyond your own\nwillpower i can give it a 100 and the\nmore that i get caught up and oh my god\ni'm a brilliant doctor\nand i should be able to do more that\nactually doesn't help the patient that's\nall about your ego right does that make\nsense\ni should be able to help this person\nmore it's like i'm not even thinking\nabout them i'm thinking about my own\nshortcomings\ni think about like a veterinarian and if\nif the if the critter dies on their\nwatch and how they can't get over that\nthey didn't they didn't win win every\nsingle time right sometimes it's just\ngoing to be like that and so the more\nthat you acknowledge your own humanness\nthe more that you acknowledge that you\nset an impossible standard for yourself\nand i think that too in terms of your\nidentity like a couple of other things\nto think about is that that standard\nthat you set is also born out of your\ninsecurity\nand that's kind of weird but\nyou you were who you were and as people\nstarted\ni don't know how to say this but like as\nthey started treating you as less\nyou create an ego that compensates\nso you have to be the best because what\nyou were wasn't good enough\nyeah\ncompensating right yeah and whereas like\nlike it just imagine\nhow your life would be different if\npeople were like you know oh it's like\ntotally fine that you're playing\nyu-gi-oh if at the library there was\nlike a cute girl who also played\nyu-gi-oh if people had accepted you\nearly on you would have nothing to prove\nthat desire to prove comes out of the\ninsecurity\nyeah yeah that's that that makes a lot\nof sense to me actually and so the more\nthat you feel guilty is because you\nhaven't proven what you have to prove\nyou want to prove to yourself that the\ncommunity deserves you so you're going\nto do right by them you're going to save\nthe world\nbut that's all born out of the\ninsecurity that you know they don't\ndeserve you don't deserve them\nyeah that's the that's what i've been\nworking towards now i i've so\nyou're nailing it all i agree i don't\ndisagree with what you're saying right\nnow um\ni've been trying to be proactive on it\nnow rather than reactive and so i've i\nhave made a pivot to\nreally\ndoing content that i find fulfilling so\ni've been wanting to like\nwork on some really abstract stuff some\nlike true blue ocean ideas here rather\nthan just like you know being the super\ngamer and just playing the game of the\nweek or whatever game of the month i'm\nokay well what what what are people\ngonna remember a year from now or five\nyears from now and i thought here\nuh i wanted to make a fitness guide\nfor gamers you know take the thing i\nenjoy with fitness and healthy and being\nand being a huge advocate for it for\nboth lifestyle options and choices and\nalso like you know\ni've never heard any gamers who are\nanti-fitness\na lot of them are intrigued by it here\nso i i want to like pioneer that that\nconnection and that has me and i i'm\nexcited and like for the first time in a\nlong time not decay i'm actually like\nthis is an idea that i'm obsessed with\nand i keep working at it i'm chipping\naway at this like\nmaster google doc i'm working on to get\nto like version one alpha release and\nlike\nuh but yeah not to make it about that\nmore it's about you know that yeah the\npoint is actually like i've been working\non\nwhat really makes me fulfilled so i can\nstop feeling this guilt actually and i\nfeel like you know that's like the whole\nthing you know i've had people tell me\nyou know i've lost 60 pounds because of\nsomething you said three years ago that\nreally clicked with me on\nthe mental and the accountability and\ndiscipline for like fitness and all that\nand i finally get it now and i'm like\nmaybe there's something here actually\nso i i i'm getting on the the better\npath with that i and i really do\nappreciate everything you said because\nyou're\nit's crazy i\nego insecurities and compensation and\nthe man being the the the the aftermath\nof what the child goes through in a way\nhere yeah a lot of my teenage hood\nreally is shaping up who i became as an\nadult and i better worst i think that's\nit's important to acknowledge that\na lot of your adaptations to that have\nbeen responsible for your success so the\nmind does this because it does help\nright\nand but at the same time i think like at\nsome point\nthe adaptations that we make to our\ninsecurity like wanting to prove\nyourself actually leads to you grinding\nand actually skilling up right so there\nare advantages to that which is why it's\nso common for people to do that but at\nyour level michael and usually what we\nhave to do is we have to adapt to some\nkind of insecurity that adaptation is\ngoing to help us for some amount of time\nand then we actually have to grow past\nit\nand what i'm really hearing is that you\nknow this is the tricky thing that\nyou're going to have to face is is\nyou're going to have a crisis or maybe\nyou've already done this you're going to\nhave a crisis of confidence when you\nhave a choice between doing the work\nthat's important and doing the work that\nmakes you successful\nand then what's wait wait a minute\nimportance versus successful yeah so\nwhat i mean by that is that maybe you've\nalready gone through this is at some\npoint\nthis happens with a lot of creators\nwhich is what they realize is that like\nif you make a guide to fitness how is\nthat going to affect your viewership\nright you're oh right oh okay so yeah so\noftentimes what a lot of creators will\nhave to do is like really struggle with\nthat and it's my experience actually\nthat ultimately choosing\nwhat's important is the right move\nbecause over time that will actually\nhave more impact i can't say that it'll\nget you more subs\nsure but when i really think about you\nknow\nif you if something catastrophic were to\nhappen and and you weren't you never\nstreamed again\nwhat people are going to remember or the\nthe effects that you're going to have is\nthat person who lost 60 pounds and now\nhas the confidence to form a\nrelationship\ngets into a healthy relationship one day\nhas children and then can help those\nchildren understand crises of confidence\nand the ripple effects from what you do\nthat you will never see as a streamer\nbecause it's not quantifiable in subs\nand donations and view count and\nconcurrent viewers and stuff like that\nthat's the real challenge of devoting\nyourself to a real important ideal\nand so i'd say lean into it and\nrecognize that the part of you that's\nobsessed with numbers\nmay have a rough patch but that's where\ni would also encourage you to use your\nstream or brain use this person who's\ngrinded use this person who sort of\nknows how to play the game and and make\nthat import leverage at all towards your\nimportant work\nso play the game but play it for a noble\ncause\ni agree\nthat is uh that's that's what i've been\nwanting to do is exactly that i've been\nwanting to focus on being fulfilling and\nnot being the a metric\nobsessed uh meta chaser yeah and rather\nbe the the meta trailblazer you know\nyeah i like even in your regard i think\neven healthy gamer entirely if i can\nflourish for a second here i think this\nis like amazing honestly um a lot of\nyour uh loving community uh approached\nme unprovoked uh saying that i'd be a\ngreat candidate here and i actually\ndeclined it uh or i i i didn't entertain\nthe idea i was in a i was so insecure\nabout even showing any of this here like\nliterally last year that i was like no i\nwould never do that dude not\ni it seems it's it's daunting it's\nexhausting i could never actually and\nyeah i i'm i'm honestly happy to hear\nyou say that michael because i don't\nwant anyone to ever feel pressured to\ncome on here i know that sometimes that\nhappens and that's the way that you know\nthe community is and stuff like that but\ni think like\nonce again patience right so things are\ngoing to happen when they're ready to\nhappen and and most importantly be\npatient if you're if you have that\nguilty kind of thought oh i'm not doing\nenough i'm not doing enough what i'd\nlove for you to do it in that moment is\na small cognitive reframe which is like\nokay\nmy guilt is coming from a genuine place\nwhich i want to support and why is it\nthat i expect my perfection for myself\nat this point\nwhy can't i be a little bit more patient\nwith myself\nand really kind of raise awareness of\nthat\ni'm gonna actually\ni'm gonna write that one down that\nthat's i i have to consider that uh\npatient with myself that's a really good\none wow i\nwhy am i not why do i feel entitled to\ninstantaneous gratification and success\ni i don't think it's\neven a gratification success it's\ninstantaneous service right\nokay right so why can't you be good\nenough for these people that you care\nabout\nand that's okay\nand and be you know\nthings happened in their time you know\nyou struggled with relationships got\ncatfished a couple times and now you've\ngot your you know long-term healthy\nrelationship if you weren't ready to\ncome on stream last year totally fine\nand i think the person that you've\nbrought\nhere today\nit also shares a perspective that's very\nvery helpful for our community\ni think oftentimes we we sort of talk to\npeople when they're really struggling\nand it's just as important to see people\nwho have gone through it because that\ngives hope\nyeah i i i completely agree with that\none there i i i love the idea that you\nknow we're normalizing that you're not\nalone and that you know everyone has\ntheir own struggles and what how how you\narrive at them is all you know\num uh conditional\nand loaded in variables here but\nnormalizing that it's okay to not be\nokay is\nyou know\nin a way you're not you're not also like\ngetting compounded by uh\nself-loathing while also failing which\nis what i was doing like i when i tell\nyou that the the pit of was bad\nwhere every day i'd wake up and i feel\nlike i'm already in the quicksand and\ni'm and i'm panicking and and just again\nit turns to self-loathing really really\nbad and that cycle is almost addictive\nit's like a poison oh yeah\nso uh michael let me ask you one last\nquestion so sometimes when people come\non we'll we'll do a brief meditation at\nthe end of the interview are you open to\ndoing something like that\nsure yeah yeah so i uh i'm not a pro\nbut um\ni i like to go for walks i like to like\nactually i find my best uh i have\ni've tried the conventional and and\nnever had enough guys to really make it\nwork here but i have found that when i\nphysically am away from my office and\nthat's when i can do my best reflection\nwhen i'm good furthers from the\ncommitment of streaming but so let's\ngive it a shot let's let me ask you a\nquestion is it okay that you're not a\npro oh that's a good question um\nclose your eyes because close your eyes\ni'm gonna ask you the question again i\nwant you to pay attention\nis it okay that you're not a pro\nlogically yes it's okay what are you\nfeeling\nthe need to perform well right now where\nis that in your body\nthe need\n[Music]\nin my head okay\nwhat are you feeling tell me\num\nyou feel like a pressure above my head\nright now just like\nlike i can i feel like i'm i can see and\nfeel the eyeballs looking at me right\nnow okay i want you to know your guys on\nhow to on how to meditate or even how to\nbe in the moment right now straighten\nyour neck in your spine\ngood roll your shoulders\njust notice that pressure\nalso take a moment to notice the\nabsurdity\nthat\nobviously you're not a pro at meditation\nand yet i ask you is it is that okay\nand you're so impatient with yourself\ni should have been an expert in\nmeditation already\nyou don't give yourself a moment of like\nyou don't give yourself any slack\nand now i want you to pay attention to\nthe part of you that doesn't give\nyourself a break\ncan you find it\ni see it\ntell me about it\noverworked\noverutilized under-rested\nstrained\ndrained\nright so it's um\nso feel like\ni want you know\nfeel all of those statements in your\nbody like like what does it feel to be\noverworked\nover strained\num you really want to know yeah\num\nit feels like spongebob in the episode\nwhere he's at sandy's house and he's\ndehydrated beyond reason\nit's like a totally dehydrated sponge\nwith absolutely no moisture\nso feel that it's like i want it's like\ni want to sweat\nbecause i'm i'm\nso drained but i'm incapable of sweating\nbecause i'm i'm so nothing left\nso now what i want you to do is give\nyourself a drink take a deep breath feel\nit in your abdomen your chest deep\nbreath in expand pull in air pull in\nlife\nhold it hold it\nand out\nslowly slowly slowly\ni want you to imagine breathe in again\nfeel the air filling your abdomen your\nchest even your shoulders it's\npermeating you with hydration\nhold it\nand out slow slow slow slow slow\none more time\nslow deep breath start with the abdomen\nmove to the chest and up the shoulders\nfeel the hydration the life flow into\nyou invigorating each cell in your body\nyou're going to feel that tingling\nthat movement\nthat's life\nand out\nnow you can resume normal breathing but\ni want you to listen to my words\nin this moment notice the part of you\nthat is relentless\nunder-rested\nalways wanting more\nwants you to be an expert in meditation\nbefore you even try\nbe\npatient acknowledge that that part of\nyou\nexists for a reason it's not a bad part\nbut that in its quest for perfection\nyou're the one that pays the price\ni'm going to leave you with one simple\nconcept\nit's the concept of two arrows\nthis is a concept from kind of buddhist\nthinking\nthat sometimes life shoots an arrow at\nus and we take it in the knee\nwe can't control that\nbut often times what we do\nis\ntake shoot an arrow at ourselves for\ngetting hit by the first one\nit's not just the mistake it's the\nself-loathing afterward\nthat's you can't control the pain\nfrom the first arrow\nbut then it's the way that we beat\nourselves up the way that you don't\nforgive yourself\nand the more that you engage in that\nself-loathing the more that you're not\npatient with yourself the more that you\ndon't forgive yourself that's what's\nreally squeezing the water out of\nyou so when you feel that way next take\na moment to close your eyes\nspine straight head straight neck\nstraight and breathe in vitality\nacknowledge that there's a part of you\nthat judges yourself\nand also acknowledge that you don't have\nto give in to it\nthat that place is coming from a\ndesperation\nto prove that you're good enough\ni'm not a pro at it i need to be a pro\nat it no you don't\nyou're perfect exactly just notice what\nyou feel in this moment\nwhat's wrong with you\nnothing\nyou exist\nfeel the breath enter your body\nfill you up\nfeel the strength and the vitality of\nyour form\nfeel this body that you've created\nthrough hours of effort\nthis mind that you've honed and refined\nthrough years of strategic practice and\nintrospection\nbe proud of the life that you've made\nacknowledge that you've got a way to go\nbut you have a good amount of time to do\nit in\nnow put your hands together in namaste\nposition palms together if you you know\nokay with that from kind of a religious\nstandpoint it's not really religious and\ni want you to rub your palms together\nrub them together create friction heat a\nlot of heat a lot of friction cup them\nover your eyes\ncup them over your eyes good\ntake a deep breath in\nas you exhale slowly open your eyes\nand then with one more breath let your\nhands come down and relax\ni'm a little bit\nwatering\nwow that was a\nthat was a journey um\nthat was thank you for that that was\ni\nwhat i can say about that\nhaving having done that uh well one i\ndon't know why my i don't know why i'm\nteary-eyed right now jesus um\nuh time perception that i i couldn't\ntell you if that was five minutes or\nthree minutes or two minutes i did it\nwas abstract there for a little bit i\ni was really in that i was i was i your\nyour voice i was just going and i'm just\nlike okay i'm i'm going like\ngood uh that was that was amazing thank\nyou i'm happy to hear\nthat it was a positive experience for\nyou i think it's interesting i don't\nrecommend that people go back and watch\nthe vod immediately after an interview\nbut\ni think anyone who had their eyes open\nyou can see it in your face\nmichael\nyou could see it it's interesting\nyou know what you you were smiling the\nwhole time\nyeah i i didn't even know i did i don't\nknow what expression i was making i\ndon't even know where i was like\nnormally you like my eyelids are closed\nand i'm like looking\nthrough the i don't even i don't even\nknow where i was what i was doing or\nwhat i was looking at perfect\nso this is nothing so i don't know how\nto say this but\nstepping outside of time\nis the best way to learn patience\nstepping outside time which meditation\ncan help do right so that was your\nexperience\nso this is a good meditation for you so\nlet me give you a couple of instructions\nso if you want to do this every day you\ncan\nbut when you're feeling impatient with\nyourself when you're feeling the\nself-loathing it's not just the mistake\nthat you make\nit's the way you beat yourself up\nbecause in those moments is when you\nfeel the most wrung out right that's why\nyou couldn't do it in the first place\nand the more you expect of yourself\nyou're squeezing squeezing do more do\nbetter do more do better there's not\nenough time you should have done it\nyesterday your mind is going to do that\ntake a step back\nneck straight back straight\nbreathe in vitality\nstart in the abdomen move to the lungs\nup to the shoulders you're going to feel\nthe physical sensations hold the breath\nand then let it go slowly\nstep outside of time for a while sit\nfully with existence\nno deadlines\nno time\nexist outside of time\nand then like slowly as you practice\nthat you'll learn patience\nyou can do it five to 15 minutes a day\nyou can also incorporate other kinds of\nmeditation techniques\nyou know you can check out we've got\nlike youtube videos and stuff about\nother meditations\num\ni would also recommend if you want an\nintroductory practice something called\nalternate nostril breathing or nari\nshuddi pranayam\nso you can just google it\num okay i'll dm you then the name of the\nthe meditation\nthank you i almost had al alternate\nnostril yeah breathing yep yeah so so\nthat can sort of help you kind of\ndevelop a formal practice and and i\nwould say do you know somewhere between\n5 and 15 minutes a day if you can\nyou can start every other day a week and\nto get clinical benefits of meditation\num in terms of anxiety and stuff like\nthat all the studies basically suggest\n20 minutes of practice at a minimum of\nevery other day is usually sufficient\nfor some kind of clinical benefit\nokay\nokay great\nthank you you're very welcome yeah\ni i will say uh it is reinforcing the\nvery little i know about meditation i've\nheard here is that like you know i will\nadmit here i'm guilty of this\nmaybe as as recently as like last year\nhad you said you know i think this would\nbenefit you i'd say\ni don't have time i have too many things\nto do i don't have time i'm drowning in\nin debt over like the backlog of tasks i\ngotta take care of here i i i don't have\ntime\nand i heard someone i forget where say\nthat like hey if someone tells you they\ndon't have time\nassign them double the amount of time\nactually yeah yeah right that's i think\nthe that quote comes from i think the\ndalai lama i could be misattributing it\nbut someone he said everyone should\nmeditate for an a half an hour a day\nand if they don't have the time they\nshould meditate for an hour\nyeah yeah yeah it's\nand i love it and so uh michael the last\nthing i'll kind of leave with you thank\nyou so much for sharing that because you\nsaid a year ago you would have rejected\nthat so that's why this conversation\ndidn't happen a year ago\nthings happen in their own time when\nthings are ready for it\nright and if if yeah i'm just thinking\nabout i'll kind of leave this may be\nlike overly interpretive but\nif yu-gi-oh hadn't released that patch\nor whatever that set of cards you would\nhave never been a speed runner\nthis is true this is very\nall right\nyeah i would have definitely it took a\nlot of me because i love you i love\nyu-gi-oh at its peak\num and its peak form and what it could\nhave been it took a lot for me to be\nfeel heartbreaking and actually like\nleave the scene and really like move on\nto something else yeah so things happen\nin their own time so be patient with\nyourself\nbecause we wouldn't be having if\nyu-gi-oh if they'd never if they had\nbalanced things better or whatever like\nwe wouldn't be having this conversation\nright now\nso\nhey that is true wow\ngood luck to you my friend\nthank you so much and and again i'm a\nhuge fan i think what you use amazing i\ni could i could uh i could fan\ngirl all day right now i actually did uh\ni\ni have consumed a couple episodes of\nyour stuff uh particularly\nyour community was very\nthey're very very righteous i'll just\ni'll keep it at that they\nthey are they're they're they're best\nyou have an amazing wholesome family and\ncommunity yeah i wish you nothing but\nthe best we're very grateful for it and\nand really appreciate you know\nwe really appreciate the community\nright on so thank you very much\nawesome all right take care of your\nmoney okay you're you're a beast thank\nyou buddy take care\nall right bye\nokay\nso\nslipped into meditation we had to catch\nit\nbefore\nuh tri-hex\ngot distracted\nso\nwrong way okay let's go this way um\nyeah so\ni think\na couple of things just to remember\nso i i really appreciated that interview\nfirst of all because tri-x is so\npassionate\nand i i want y'all to really take away\nthat\nif we listen to his story there were a\nlot of dark periods of his life\nright super dark periods whether it's be\ncalled white mike whether it's a young\nblack kid growing up in rural louisiana\nloving yu-gi-oh\nwhether it's the people over and was it\nkonami that makes yu-gi-oh\nyou know releasing like there's just so\nmuch\nso much to be in despair about\nright this game that you love and like\nhonestly like okay two favorite parts of\nthe interview\ni gotta i mean i i know that we sort of\nhelped out and and talked about stuff\nand maybe educated people towards the\nend but two favorite parts of the\ninterview\nwatching him unleash his rant about\nbalance and meta changes in yu-gi-oh\nfrom what was it like\n21 years ago or something absurd\nthat was awesome\nand then secondly discovering that\nthe reason he's in his rock of a\nrelationship is because first of all he\ncalled his future girlfriend a basement\ndwelling neck beard\nand then twitch hat like legit came to\nthe rescue in his community went to bat\nfor him\nlike you can't make this stuff up\num\nthat was epic\nand\ni\nlike if y'all are despairing i think\ntake solace and inspiration that that\ntrihex made it\nand even if we're sort of thinking oh my\ngod i'm going to be alone forever like\ni mean if twitch chat could do it for\ntrihax they could you could do it for\nyourselves\nso don't give up hope be patient with\nyourselves\nyou know i think he's grown so much and\nit's amazing he's like the dude is an\ninspiration\nright and it sounds like he's trying to\ndo you all a solid by putting together\nthis workout doc or whatever like that\nsounds really cool\nyou know\nand i think it's like we're sort of\nseeing this even at the beginning i\ndidn't you know i didn't think about\nthat but we were talking today about\ncamp canutt and how like\ncanada is helping asthma gold and\nbiscuit like put their lives together\nand get in shape and feel good about\nthemselves\nand so like this community this world\nthis internet kind of thing that can\nlead to addiction and despair and and\ntoxicity and\nand all these kinds of things can also\nlead to\n[Music]\npeople getting in shape\npeople finding relationships people\nunderstanding themselves better people\nlearning to forgive each other and\nforgive themselves\nand it is what we make of it\nright the biggest\nscam\nthat we ever pull is convincing\nourselves that we don't have power\nconvincing ourselves that we're\nirrelevant\nconvincing ourselves that we can't\nchange our lives\nbecause what the mind does\nis it looks at all of the reasons why\nsomething isn't going to help\nit's going to say oh it's not enough\nit's not enough it won't help\nwhat difference does it make if i clean\nmy room\nwhat difference does it make if i\nexercise look at all the thousand things\nthat are wrong in the world in my life\nwhat difference does exercise make\nand that's because we're operating from\nthis dimension of time\nand i know this is going to sound kind\nof weird like we're going to get into\nlike strange territory but if you want\nto put together your life stop\noperating within time\nstart operating in the now don't worry\nabout the future\ni'm not saying don't consider it\nentirely\nright but like in this moment\nif you decide not to exercise because\nit's not going to be enough\nwhat you're using is you're letting time\ntrick you into\nparalysis\nand then today becomes tomorrow and\ntomorrow becomes the next day and every\nsingle day you say it's not enough but\nwhat about tomorrow what about this what\nabout this what about this it's all\nreasons to not act\nas trihex says it's a case of the don't\nwant us\nyou"
