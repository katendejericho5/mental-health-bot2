    "transcript": "so so like now something weird is\nhappening where they're like the part of\nyou that is afraid that something is\nlike fundamentally off\nthe more successful you become\nthe more you're afraid that someone is\ngoing to look at you and be like where's\nthe catch hello my friend hello dr k\nhow are you buddy\ni am doing okay thank you very much for\ngiving me the chance and thank you for\neverything you do it's amazing and it's\nhelping me and a ton of other people\nwell you're very welcome and thank you\nvery much for being here because what i\ndo requires people like you to\ncome on so thank you so much man\nwell it's a privilege um so\nlikewise and what do you go by my friend\nuh you can call me trend that's okay\nthat's my username yeah absolutely trend\nso tell me what's holding you back\nso in short the way i summed it up was a\nfear of success\nuh in the sense of every time i seem to\nget close or within reach of something i\nreally want i seem to self-sabotage in\nsome way or another\nokay\nin a way maybe a more practical example\nthat i gave earlier was\nfor example if let's say in a dating\ncontext you\nstart dating somebody and then they seem\nto be okay uh then you maybe i see it\ngoing somewhere and out of nowhere maybe\ni start seeing things in them that\nmaybe i make it up uh just like defects\nor things red flags that are there or\nmight not be there just because i'm kind\nof worried of what an actual\nrelationship might be in that sense or\nin a work context it might be taking on\na project\nwith confidence at the beginning and\nthen once i kind of move forward i start\nto realize that maybe i have a bit a\nlittle bit more than i could chew but\nyou know i've done things successfully\nin the past so it's just kind of a\nself-perpetuating belief maybe down the\nline\nokay so that sounds\nfirst of all i commend your insight\nuh into recognizing a potential pattern\nthat you've come up with that's not easy\nto do\nwhat's your understanding of why you're\nafraid of success how do you come to\nthat conclusion\nwell obviously i've used a lot of your\ncontent uh\nover over the past couple of years to\nkind of ask myself uh relevant questions\nand that has helped me a ton in\nunderstanding a little bit why i might\ndo certain things\nin my estimation it would be something\nlike\nthe fear maybe of responsibility that\ncomes along with success uh the fear of\nthe hard work that goes into it even\nthough i'm not afraid of hard work per\nse i'm you know quite diligent worker i\nwasn't very good in school i got by\nbut uh once i moved out on my own i kind\nof became more responsible as a\nnecessity but i i do enjoy\nresponsibility when it comes to\nand i don't mind taking on other\npeople's problems that much it's just\nthat when it comes to myself i see\nuh\nthere it'd be easier to stay in my\ncomfort zone where which is i'm not very\nhappy in some\naspects let's see can you help me\nunderstand what your comfort zone is\nokay uh i can be i can be more specific\nto my situation in particular which in\nthis case would be\na dating in particular um sweet that\nwould was very helpful\nso\nfor me i'm well i'm 28\nso i'm not young let's say by any you\nknow i'm not one of the younger members\nof the audience but\nuh i i don't catastrophize as to like my\nlife is over or this or that it's just\nmore like\ni've put off dating for a while um i\nmoved out from my parents house i\nfocused on getting a place of my own a\njob i jumped between a few jobs until i\nfound a career i liked so i put a lot of\neffort into my career\nuh into my you know i work out i try to\nmeditate every once in a while i try to\nstay into the whole like\nself-improvement loop\nbut when it comes to dating i find it\nvery difficult to make maybe the first\ntake the first step because i'm i have\nthis perfectionism problem where\nif i do let's say\ndo meet somebody i like i don't know\nwhere that would lead i'm worried about\nthe potential\nkind of um\nramifications of getting involved with\nsomebody you know i've i've had\nrelationships in the past\nbut that was a while back\nand so it's just it's been a gap where\nnow i'm worried that\nthe success in that relation in a\npotential relationship i don't know what\nthat would entail for example um\nyou know\ni'm being a little bit more vague now\nbut yeah well yeah i think it's it's\nordinary for\nso first thing trend i thank you so much\nfor sharing everything you've shared i\nthink it's very helpful and and i think\npart of the reason that we're vague\nsometimes is that\nwe can articulate very well up to the\nbarrier of our understanding\nright and so like it's naturally going\nto be like any time we discuss we're\ntrying to figure something out\nit's not precise like if we had\nunderstood everything then\nyou know we would have moved past it so\ni think it's totally fine so let me ask\nyou a couple of questions um\nso actually let me just try to let's\nstart with us a quick summary so what\ni'm hearing is that you you're like\ngenerally it sounds like you're doing\npretty well in life you've put in a lot\nof effort um you know you've had a\ncouple bumps in the road you've overcome\nthose you're sort of taking care of\nyourself physically you're advancing\nprofessionally um you're really like\nworking on yourself and have seen a lot\nof progress i'm also hearing that you\ncan like you're not you don't avoid\nresponsibility you don't even\nnecessarily avoid challenges or things\nlike that\nyou're really able to kind of rise to\nthe challenge and and progress and grow\nis that fair\ncorrect yes\nwhen it comes to dating though you're\nnoticing that like as things kind of\nmove forward and here's where i'm a\nlittle bit confused because earlier you\nkind of said like once things get\nstarted you'll start\nnoticing red flags that maybe aren't\nthere excuses to get out of a\nrelationship but then just recently you\nsaid that you have trouble sort of\nstarting things can you help me\nunderstand where does the problem arise\nat the starting or like once things are\nkind of\nrolling\nyeah so that's yeah you made a great\npoint so the way i would put it is i've\nhad a couple of first dates here and\nthere i've had a couple of like\ninteractions whether my friend set me up\nor i met somebody off a dating app or\nsomething like that\num sometimes i felt pressured into\num\nyou know catching up on that end because\ni feel like i'm behind my peers when it\ncomes to the relationship aspect\nso\nin the sense i'll like jump into the\nsituation and then pull back when i\nrealize that hey maybe you know i'm not\nsure that\num this is where i want to go with this\nperson but i took it because it was\nbetter than nothing\nso i really have a fear of like doing\nthings because it's better than nothing\nor i don't subscribe to the whole like\nbeing with somebody because i don't want\nto be alone i'm very good at being alone\ni i i'm not bored uh i don't feel like i\nnecessarily\nneed other people but it's definitely\nsomething that i would like to work on\nuh because my goals are definitely to\nhave a relationship to have maybe a\nfamily someday so\num\nwhere that ends up going is that i with\nsomebody i really care i would\npotentially really care about my\ninsecurities start coming up whereas\nwith people that i don't care about that\nmuch you know as bad as that may sound\nit's a lot easier to kind of you know\ngive it a try and then pull back when\nyou know like i i see something wrong or\ni assume there's something wrong\nokay can can i think for a second trend\nof course please\nokay\ncan you tell me what what you mean about\nyou said that your insecurities come up\nmore when you're\nwhen there's someone you're more\ninvested in\ncan you help me understand what kind of\ninsecurities you're talking about\nyeah so\nspecifically probably and i've watched a\ncouple of your\nin-cell videos as well um\nand i think\nhaving to explain to somebody that you\nknow i haven't been in a relationship in\na while that's something that i worry\nmight pop up\nwhen i get more invested with somebody\nthat i might like actually\nthat's one of them another one might be\njust\nfear of being judged for even though\nlike on my metric and what doesn't help\nsomehow reversely is my friends telling\nme that like oh you're so great or you\nknow my family oh you're so great\nsomebody would be lucky to have you and\ni'm like oh yeah great thanks thanks for\nthat so why don't i have anybody like\num\nit's\nit's very much a\nself-inflicted thing maybe but\nit's definitely that feeling of either\nbeing\nnot good enough\non some level that i can't understand\nor it's the having to explain to\nsomebody that hey you know like\ni've been working on myself but\nmaybe that's just an excuse for why i've\nbeen alone maybe i've been alone for\nother reasons that i can't understand\nand that somebody else might see\ntrend do you feel ready for a\nrelationship\ndefinitely yeah i think so uh okay\nbecause in the past i've definitely felt\nnot ready so like i know i feel the\ndifference between\nnot being ready and then being ready\nokay whatever that may mean you know\nlet me ask you something trent if you\nmet the one\ntomorrow\nyeah how would you feel\necstatic\ni disagree nervous nervous um terrified\nprobably okay now we're getting\nsomewhere help me understand\nwhat are you terrified of\nof ruining it\nvery good\nright so\nif you're afraid of ruining it\nso here's the thing here's what i'm\nhearing for you let me know i mean very\ngood isn't it i'm assuming i'm i'm right\nhere but so you're the judge right so\nyeah i'm gonna put for something for it\nto you here's the thing\nso trend has been putting his life\ntogether\ntrent has a good career is working out\nthe thing that i'm really hearing from\nyou what you're really concerned about\nis that\nyou're not\nwhat i'm really sensing from you is that\nif you were to meet the one tomorrow\nyou're not confident that you could make\nit work\nyou're concerned that if you met the the\none\nshe would ask questions like what like\nyou know\ntell me a little bit about your dating\nhistory and you're like yeah i've never\nreally been in a long-term relationship\nit's been many many years and then she's\ngoing to like look at you and i'm\nassuming you're heterosexual for a\nmoment\nis that a fair assumption\nthat is a fair question\nso\nshe's going to look at you and she's\ngoing to be like oh my god like this guy\nlooks so great like he may exercise and\nhe may have a decent career and he's got\na silky smooth voice but there must be\nsomething wrong with him because he\nhasn't you know had a decent\nrelationship\ndo you ever like does that kind of\nresonate with you\nabsolutely\nand i think maybe that's the way i see\nmyself in a certain way so tell me about\nthat how do you see yourself\nexactly as you said where you know all\nof the above but there must be something\nwrong with him because he didn't have a\nlong-term relationship um\nand yeah i might rationalize hey i've\nbeen working on myself i've been doing\nthis i've been doing that but\nthat's just me and the way i think you\nknow i don't know how other people think\ni completely agree with what you said\nearlier also of you know the fear of not\ngetting it to work because practically\nspeaking i don't have\nthe experience to know like the the ups\nand downs of relationships and how to\nmanage them\nokay so\ni might run\nyou're just saying so much good stuff i\ndon't want to lose any of it okay thank\nyou very much\nokay\nokay\nkeep going sorry\nif you can if you can't that's okay i\nknow i interrupted your frame of mind\nbut you're you're full no so\nlet me ask you a couple other questions\nso you said rationalize it to yourself\nright so like if you're rationalizing oh\ni've been working on myself is that\nreally the reason you've been single\num\n[Music]\nwell\nat on the spot i can't think of like\ni'm sure i felt like i couldn't add much\nto somebody else's life um before\num\nwhatever you know that may mean\num i had the because also my initial\nrelationships were very much based on\nkind of a negative\nattraction to people that maybe we were\nboth having issues so i was in the much\nless oh i don't want to dramatize too\nmuch but i was like in the darker place\ni was relating to people more on a kind\nof a sad level you know like trauma\nbonding stuff like that um unhealthy\nfoundations of connection unhealthy yeah\nunhealthy foundations so that didn't end\nup going very well because my standards\nwere very low\nand probably theirs were as well\nit was you know i would take anybody um\nthat would like me i was blown away the\nfirst time somebody actually liked me so\num\nyou know so that i put that to the side\nfor a while after that i ended up\ngetting involved with a couple of people\nthat were you know they were nice people\nand all that but they just weren't for\nme for whatever reason and now that um\ni see myself as having put in the work\ni'd like somebody who was also put in\nsome amount of work not necessarily like\nyou know they don't have to have this\namazing career or this or that but you\nknow somebody who's self-aware and\nsomebody who's\nemotionally healthy\nish enough you know okay\nbeautifully said so trend let me let's\ntry to tease things apart a little bit\nokay\nokay so i'm going to put forward just a\ncouple of observations and let's see\num\nuh\nlet's see how we can understand a couple\nthings\nso question number one\noh so observation number one\noddly enough the more invested you are\nin someone the more likely you are to\nself-sabotage correct or incorrect\ncorrect\nokay\nthe more\nthe less invested you are in someone the\nmore likely you are to advance the\nrelationship correct or incorrect\ncorrect\nhow do you understand that\num\ni don't fear the consequences of losing\nit that much good okay so that that's\nthat's makes a lot of sense to me right\nso you know and what kind of consequence\nare we talking\nabout um\nregret\num\nwhat would you regret\nhaving missed out like having ruined\nsomething potentially good\nright um or the you know as you going\nback to your the one uh example kind of\nyou believe in the one\ni believe there's ones you know there's\nlike multiple people that we can have\nthere's\ncompatibility and different other things\nso\nyeah i used to i used to believe in the\none what happened\num\ni uh the reality happened okay\nokay interesting no that's that's fine\num so so let me put it this way so like\nlet's understand this first thing you\nplay video games trend\nuh yes i do what do you play\ni mainly play dota 2. now i play valorum\nthese days beautiful okay so this is\ngoing to be easy to understand you know\nin dota 2 you can queue up for ranked\nand you can queue up for unranked right\nabsolutely okay so what you're doing in\nyour relationships is you're never\nqueuing ranked\nnever you're always queueing unranked\nyeah does that make sense\nyes very much explain it to us\nwell in unranked even if you lose there\nis no real consequence um in ranked\nwhich i also don't do in dota these days\nso it does apply as apparel\nright but yeah\nit's interesting so if we're talking\nabout self-sabotage like so and you want\na relationship let's just like\nunderstand that this makes perfect sense\nand yet it's kind of bizarre that\nyou're more you pull away from\nrelationships that have the highest\nvalue of success or probability of\nsuccess the relationships that you\nactually want are the ones that you're\nleast likely to engage in\ncorrect right so that's like kind of\nweird and the more that we tunnel down\ninto that the more that we realize that\ni think on some level you're afraid of\nscrewing up the right relationship\nand so you're will you're happy because\nlike and this we'll get to this in a\nsecond\nso you kind of feel somewhere inside you\nthat there's like something\nfundamentally that isn't great\nright yes\nand so like if there isn't something\nthat's fundamentally great like you've\ngot to level up and unranked and like\nlearn how to play the game you're 28\nyears old you haven't had a whole lot of\nhealthy relationships you're falling a\nlittle bit behind you're not like doom\nand gloom kind of stuff where it's like\ntoo late for you but it's sort of like i\nkind of see both of the pieces right\nwhere there's the part of you that's\nlike a little bit doom and gloom and now\nyou've started to work on that but it's\nstill sort of there\nso now we're going to get to the really\ntricky thing\nas you become more successful\ndo you think that exacerbates this\nproblem or improves this problem\ni know it's kind of a weird question\nno it's it's a perfect question because\nwhat i was thinking of also was\ni've had milestones that i thought if i\nhit it would kind of unblock me\nso\ni thought that when i moved out of my\nparents place and got my own place well\nmy parents are divorced so when i moved\ni like one of my parents place i got my\nown place that would help because i\nwould be able to kind of show that i\nhave my own place when i got a good job\ni thought that would help me\nuh when i got in shape i thought that\nwould help me so i just kept hitting\nmilestones expecting you know something\nto break the cycle\nand it just seems to keep going in that\nway so\num\nas i move forward in life which you know\nunder some metrics i am\nthen\nmy\nobviously tolerance for the unranked is\ngoing down i'm much more craving a\nranked experience\nuh hold on but use two different words\nthat are very different is your\ntolerance for unranked going down and\nor because craving intolerance are two\nvery different things\ni don't doubt that you crave ranked but\ncan you tolerate ranked the more\nsuccessful you become\ndoes that make it easy no no no no but\njust like for example i'm much i'm much\nquicker to\nend things when i see that it's unranked\nlet's get it that way right okay rather\nthan continue forward but as i would\nbefore now i i'm much like i'd rather\njust hey you know like i'd rather not\nplay than not play ranked okay\nmakes sense so let me ask you again do\nyou think that becoming more successful\nhelps\nwith this problem or does it\nnot help with this problem\na\ni don't think it's helped me that much\nit's definitely giving me a little bit\nmore confidence but like\nit it's not a one-to-one at all like\nyeah\nlet me ask you something trend\nlet's say you meet\nsomeone who looks like the one\nright so she's got her stuff together\nshe's attractive\nshe's\num you know done a lot of like she\nphysically takes care of herself she's\ngot her career going well and she's 29.\nwhat's in the back of your mind when you\nsee a 29 year old who's single and has\ntheir stuff together\num\ni mean i'd be lying if i didn't have\nsome judgment very good what's your\njudgment\nyou know why didn't they prioritize that\nlike if they were you know if everything\nis so great why aren't they with\nsomebody exactly\nright so you have an insecurity\nand interestingly enough the more this\nis the really paradoxical thing and and\ni appreciate so much that you called in\ni appreciate that you've been a part of\nthis community because we don't usually\nget to this part with people who are in\nlike early members of our community\nthank you very much so so like now\nsomething weird is happening where\nthey're like the part of you that is\nafraid that something is like\nfundamentally off the more successful\nyou become\nthe more you're afraid that someone is\ngoing to look at you and be like where's\nthe catch\nso it's kind of bizarre because as you\nsucceed you were sort of\nassuming that like the internal sense of\nlike something is off is\nis gonna get fixed\nand oddly enough the more milestones you\nachieve the better you look on paper the\nmore you're concerned that if you meet\nthe one she's gonna look at you and be\nlike wait something's off here this guy\nis too good to be true\nwhat's on the other side of the coin\nwhat do you think about that does that\nresonate with you\num probably um i also\ndon't like to show people my\nweak side uh in any way or should i like\ni i don't\nlike i always like to paint the picture\nthat everything is fine uh i have no\nproblems uh if anybody i'm very good at\nlike dealing with other people's\nproblems uh but when i don't like help i\ndon't like\nuh\naccepting help from other people\nand so when i show myself to somebody\nwho might be a prospect in dating i'm\ngonna paint the picture that everything\nis perfect\num what is the weak side\ni don't know i i like the insecurities\nthat we were talking about i guess um\nthe the fact that i you know obviously i\ndo have\ni'm sure issues i'm sure i have some\nsort of blind spots that i can't see\num\nthere i'm sure there's stuff that i\ndon't even know about so\nfor me the what i try to hide and\nsuppress is probably my need for any\nsort of reassurance or help or anything\nlike that\nokay there's\nit's getting a little\nwe're adding layers to it to the onion\nbut let me ask you something\nhow are you sure you have issues\num\nkind of drawing from the conclusion that\nif i didn't i wouldn't be in this\nsituation\nokay\nso like here's here's the weird thing\nlet's assume that like there's a certain\namount of this that's rng\nyeah how would you tell if like how are\nyou gonna know whether you have issues\nor don't have issues how would you be\nable to tell the difference\ni\nwouldn't so like this is this is\nimportant to understand trent\nso like it's kind of weird because it's\nlike\nyou believe you have issues because you\nhaven't found a relationship that is\nlong-lasting and fulfilling at the age\nof 28\nbut like you may not and then that that\nbelief that there's something in you\nthat is left unresolved is exactly what\nyou're afraid is going to screw up\nmeaning the one\nyes\nright\nyes but then like this is kind of a\nweird self-fulfilling prophecy because\nwhat if you actually don't have issues\nso then you have nothing to worry about\nin the relationship because\nyou're 28 and the average age at which\npeople are forming long lasting\nrelationships is like statistically\nincreasing\nyeah no i i completely see your point\nkind of shooting myself in the foot\nright so so i i think that you're cons\nyou're because it's kind of weird\nbecause when i ask you like how are you\nsure you have issues they're like there\nmust be a blind spot because i don't see\nanything but it's got to be there\nthat in and of itself that conclusion is\ncoming from the insecurity that there's\nsomething fundamentally broken\nyeah and then we get into this situation\nwhere okay so like let's just let's take\na step back and run run it from from the\nbeginning\nsomewhere along the way\nyou were concerned that you could not\noffer some uh that's not the right\nphrasing\nsomewhere along the way you are\nconcerned that\ndespite being a successful good caring\nhuman being that there's some part of\nyou that is going to screw up a\nrelationship and that someone would like\ndiscover at some point and then break up\nwith you it's like something\nfundamentally messed up with trend\nyes okay that's in a nutshell okay\nso then\ntrend did what a good person is supposed\nto do they started working on themselves\nright that's what we tell everyone work\non yourself and trend worked on himself\nso he started exercising\nhopped jobs for a little while found a\ngood career grinded at it you know did a\nlot of self-development work now as a\ndecent career now is in decent shape is\na good friend can accept responsibility\ncan face challenges can support people\nemotionally\nright and then each of those things you\nthought okay at some point this is going\nto fix the fundamental insecurity\nyes and it didn't fix the fundamental\ninsecurity so now we've got this kind of\nweird situation where\nyou don't even know what to fix anymore\nbecause everything that you saw that was\nwrong you've worked on right\nyeah yeah\nyeah in a sense and so now the confusing\nthing is like there's some part of you\nthat feels that something is off and\nthat if you date if you run into the one\nlike eventually they're gonna look at\nyou you're 28 they're gonna say this guy\nlooks perfect\nwhat's the catch\nwhat's the catch what's the catch and\nyou don't know what the catch is but\nyou're afraid they're gonna figure it\nout\nand so then\nsince you're fundamentally afraid that\nyou may not succeed in a relationship\nbecause there's this big boogeyman in\nthe closet that you don't know what it\nis you have a blind spot to it you've\nworked on everything that you know how\nto work on you're afraid that they're\ngoing to look at signs in your life like\n28 career exercises single like there's\ngot to be something\nyeah right\nand so interestingly enough like\nthen what happens is\nyou've got a choice when you start\ndating and the people that you're more\nattracted to you're afraid that you\nwon't be able to that they're going to\ndiscover this thing it's almost like\nyou're an imposter you're like a broken\nperson pretending to be a put together\nperson\nyeah does that resonate with you i had\nthat in my job at the beginning when i\nstarted as well very much for imposter\nsyndrome um for the first like six month\nish of that so until i kind of\ngot enough confidence by you know\nsucceeding and and taking on challenges\nand failing sometimes of course and\nlearning from failures you know i'm not\nperfect by any means but it's just that\nyou know i at least i felt like i had i\nwas given the chance to kind of try and\nlearn um and i felt like in a\nrelationship perhaps\nit's you know if i myself then that's it\nyeah so who's not giving you the chance\nto try and learn in a relationship\noh\nme\n100\nright and you're even so even then trent\nyou're you're doing you're doing\nin a sense quote unquote the right thing\nwhich is that you keep on queuing for\nunranked\nyeah right so you're like and it makes\nperfect sense because you don't want to\nrisk\nlike\nthe possibility of the perfect\nrelationship while you're in experience\nyou want to work out all of these kinks\nwith people that you're not even\ninvested in\nyeah and so you're you're queuing up for\nunranked where people are like\ndrunk\nand smurfs\nand feeding and like trying out wonky\nthings they're not playing the game\nseriously and now you've even gotten\nfrustrated with that because you've\nrealized this is actually not what i\nwant to play but you're afraid to queue\nup for ranked because what if you lose a\ngame what if the one comes across they\nsee that you're broken they see that oh\nmy god trend is just faking it he's\nfaking it he's faking it he's pretending\nto have his stuff together but deep down\nhe doesn't have his stuff together\nyou're afraid of risking it\nso how does your mind protect you\nfrom screwing up the perfect\nrelationship trend what does it do\n100 and what is not trying how does it\nconvince you not to try\num you're going to fail\nor\num\nyeah probably that\ni think it's this is where the red flags\ncome in\noh i see yeah sounds like finds faults\nin other people 100\nright yeah it gives you reasons it says\noh\nbecause it's not it's going to protect\nyou because there's no way that your\nmind is going to let you\nbecause imagine how how you would feel\nif you met the one and you screwed it up\nhow would you feel\nhorrible horrible\nit's just going to reinforce\nand confirm\nthe fact that you're fundamentally\nbroken\nyou're not actually but so that's not\nreally a fact yeah\nso and your mind is like oh crap we love\ntrend we want to take care of trend we\ndon't we can't we can't let him realize\nthat his deepest darkest fears are true\num\nand so what it does is it finds red\nflags it says oh no no no no no that's\nnot the one you see all these things\nthat are wrong with them don't bother\nbut then something subtle happens as you\npoint out red flags do they do they\nmoved into the unranked category in your\nmind\nyes\ni don't think so\noh okay\nright so maybe they do but what i'm sort\nof saying is they're people that you're\ninvested in and people that you're not\ninvested in people that you're not\ninvested in you can date but when you\nmeet someone that you're invested in and\nyou find red flags you actually knock\nthem completely off you don't move them\ninto this category and start dating them\nyeah no i don't even give them a chance\nat that point exactly right so it's not\nactually unranked it's not you're not\nmoving him into the low value category\nyou're right you're right you just avoid\nthem entirely\ncorrect\nright and that's to protect yourself\nfrom the rejection and the confirmation\nit's not just the rejection it's the\nconfirmation that you can't succeed in a\nrelationship\nthat something's fundamentally wrong\nbecause that's gonna like because here\nyou are putting together your life\nhoping for the confidence hoping for the\nconfidence hoping for the confidence and\nyou never find it so in the back of your\nmind there's this thing that's like oh\ncrap what if something actually is\nyou know busted\nyeah\nabsolutely and as long as you never\nqueue up you\nare never going to be\ntruly rejected and then there's the hope\nthat actually like if you keep working\non it keep working on it keep on you\nknow playing unranked and getting a\nbetter career and getting better this\nand better that there's this part of\nyour mind that says okay the confidence\nwill come eventually\nbut the interesting paradox what really\nis keeps you stuck there is that the\nmore you succeed in the rest of your\nlife the more that this other complex\npops up which is like where's the catch\nyeah\nso you really seem like you're\nyou can't move in any direction right\nyou can't actually queue up for ranked\nyou can't actually give a real\nrelationship a shot because what if you\nscrew it up even if you keep on working\non other dimensions of your life that's\ngoing to just terrify you more that the\nmore put together you are if you become\na you know multi-millionaire\nand then you've got a super nice house\nand you're you know super in shape and\nyou've got you're very emotionally\navailable and and you've got a fancy car\nand all this kind of stuff like the more\nthat you like meet people the more\nthey're gonna be like what's wrong with\nthis guy\nso paradoxically even advancing is like\nreinforcing the insecurity\ndefinitely definitely and i think\nexternal expectations are also\nincreasing\naround me for you know i'm getting to\nthat age where a lot of people my\nfriends are getting married or getting\ninto serious relationships my family i'm\nsure you've heard this many many times\nbut they're starting to ask you know\nwhen are we going to have\na missus trend where we're gonna have uh\nyou know little uh\ngrandchildren\nyeah so we're gonna have you know and\nsure like i'm not\nyou know super super pressure but i\ndefinitely feel it from all sides and\ninternally it reinforces this oh you\nknow like\ni i better get moving or you know or not\neven that it's more like why haven't i\ngotten moving there it is well said\ntrent\nright\nthat's it's beautifully put\nso now trend okay so now we understand\nit what are we gonna do about it bro\nwell\nlike you said i think i've been stuck uh\nparalyzed um between the you know the\nidea of not taking a risk because i'm\ntoo worried of the consequences of it\nfailing um\nbut\nthe only way i can see is to just give\nit a chance uh it's a lot easier said\nthan done of course um but one thing for\nsure was to acknowledge that i don't\nwant to waste other people's time like i\ndon't want to just be not serious with\nsomebody because they don't mean that\nmuch to me i don't want to hurt other\npeople\ni don't want to compromise their\nemotions so i'd rather\njust kind of\naim more carefully for and recognize\nmore carefully somebody who might be a\npotential for me\nand that way\nif i do\nkind of set my eye on somebody and they\nlike me too\nand i can see you know i i'd have to be\nmore\nself-aware if i'm making up certain\nthings about them like is this person\nactually\nthis this and this or are they just you\nknow maybe they're having a bad day or\nmaybe they're you know maybe i'm making\nit up or isn't this my fear of messing\nit up\nbecause i can see this is going\nsomewhere\ngood so let's try to make it a little\neasier for you so i think essentially\nit's the right answer but let's try to\nlike i mean there isn't a right answer\nbut it makes a lot of sense to me so\nlet's try to help you become aware let's\ntry to detail out what you should be\naware of\nthe first is\nnotice that your mind is making red\nflags for people okay okay\nnow here's the thing when you see a red\nflag\nthen you have to try to figure out is\nthis a real red flag or is this an\nartificial red flag and so the key thing\nthere is\nto ask yourself is this red flag a way\nan excuse\ni can use\nto\nend a relationship with someone that i\nreally want and i'm afraid i'm going to\nscrew up\ni realize that's a long sentence but\nlike no no it makes perfect sense right\nis this like is this my mind's way of\nprotecting me am i going to reject them\nbefore they reject me\nexcellent yeah right yeah and so if the\nanswer is yes then i'm not saying that\nyou have to date them\nbut at least acknowledge that and ask\nyourself okay like can i actually\nam i like is the fear too strong\nor can i actually like give this a shot\nand the neat thing is when you notice\nthat your mind is doing that the power\nof that is actually going to decrease\nand the fear will be easier to overcome\nokay\nthe next thing to kind of think through\nis that\nnotice that\nyou know all of your successes don't\nnecessarily deal with\nthe source of your insecurity\nright so this is a sum scar so like when\nyou develop a lack of confidence that\ncomes from one part of your life\nfixing another part of your life doesn't\ntranslate into fixing this insecurity\nso here's the tricky thing is you\nstarted to believe at some point that\nyou were like\nunlovable by people that are important\nto you\nnow that may have something to do with\ndivorced parents like you never really\nknow i'm not saying that they didn't\nlove you but the you know the child\nright so like it's like little things\nlike\nyou know parents like if you're moving\nhouses and things like that there may\nhave been something where your dad\nswapped a weekend or your mom swapped a\nweekend so that they could go on a date\nand like that's where you realize like\noh like this person you know\ncares about other people more than they\ncare about me or something like that we\ndon't necessarily need to go into that\nmy point is that the source of the\ninsecurity cannot be fixed directly by\nputting together other stuff\nso you may need to look into the source\nof that insecurity do you have a sense\nof where that comes from\ni did some uh so i i've been\nusing the healthy gamer guide um to kind\nof analyze myself i've done a little bit\nof therapy as well in the past good for\nyou a couple years uh just a few\nsessions here and there\nuh it definitely helped understand that\na lot of these things come from\nchildhood my you know my parents as you\nsaid they did get divorced i'm sure it\nhad some sort of an impact they lived\nalso in different countries so i didn't\nget to see one of my parents for like\nsix months at a time\num\nyou know there's a lot of stuff there\nand nothing you know extremely\ntraumatizing but stuff that would make\nyou kind of understand how i would get\nto the point where i feel like i either\nneeded to be the best kid to get\nattention you know uh or to be\nresponsible for my\none of my parents emotions so i had to\nbe like always the good kid\num so that kind of developed into\nsomething down the line i would say that\ntherapy kind of helped me realize very\ngood so like this is very common but\nbeing the best kid\nto get attention\nreinforces the idea that fundamentally\nyou don't deserve attention\nand so interestingly enough i think that\ncould relate to what you were saying\nwhat we were saying earlier about the\nmore success you actually have\nthe more concerned someone may be that\nthere's like something that they're\nmissing\nright because it's sort of artificially\nit's using achievement to justify\nattention and so the more successful you\nbecome it's kind of the same parallel\nwhere it's like there's this external\nsense which should justify you wanting\nto be in a relationship with me but does\nthat kind of make sense\nabsolutely and i think what you touched\non earlier of the trying to make up for\none lack with another success is\ndefinitely what i've i don't think i\ndidn't even realize i was doing that\nuntil you just said that but that's\ndefinitely my mindset maybe might have\nbeen which you know brought some\npositive things obviously but\nvery good\ndidn't make up for the initial problem\ngreat so so you're in a healthy place\ntrend because i think now you've\nrealized that\nbeing successful in part is to in a\nsense make up for the fact that you feel\ninsecure\nand so that can\ngive you a lot of success which is\nfantastic but now you need to grow past\nthat right now you need to realize that\nand and this is where sort of dealing\nwith the source of the insecurity\nhopefully you'll kind of understand that\nyou know the person who's the one and\nwe'll get to this in a second the person\nwho's the one is gonna be okay with the\nfact that you're not perfect because a\ngood relationship is not about two\nperfect people getting together it's\nabout two people who are works in\nprogress\nhelping each other in a positive way\nthat's very comforting honestly um i\ndon't expect perfection for my partner\nat all i don't know why i see that but i\ndon't see that but you want to give them\na perfect product\nyeah exactly so i don't expect it from\nthem but i expect it for myself for them\nyeah\nand so next thing to consider\nis you know when you are dating that\nperson we'll just kind of like double\ndown on that point is that i\nyou know\nthis kind of goes back to like the\nthe logical trap of\nblind spots\nright so you've worked on everything\nthat needs to be worked on and now we're\ndoing a little bit more work which is\ngood\nbut you've got to be super careful about\nthe way you conclude that you're not\nready for a relationship\nbecause\nif you were ready you actually wouldn't\nknow because you just assumed that\nthere's another blind spot does that\nmake sense\nyeah like the next one exactly so like\nhow do you know when you're ready if\nyou're always assuming that there's\ngoing to be a blind spot or something\nthat you missed or there's something\nfundamentally wrong with you which is\nwhy you're 28 and single\n[Music]\nand so interestingly enough i think\nthat's because that comes from the\nfeeling and you can't logic your way out\nof a feeling there's a feeling that\nthere's something wrong with me and as\nlong as that feeling is there you're\ngoing to continuously think that you're\nnot ready for a real relationship\nand so just kind of be aware of that and\nrecognize that you're setting yourself\nup for a standard that you will never be\nable to meet because no matter how much\nyou work on yourself no matter how\nsuccessful you become professionally no\nmatter how handsome you are\nno matter what happens there's going to\nbe part of your mind that may still be\nlike oh but what about this we may be\nmissing something and since you don't\nknow what that is because you've fixed\neverything you've seen it's so\nparalyzing to actually go into a real\nrelationship\nbecause it's like there's something\nwrong and i i can't see it i can't see\nit i can't see it how can i possibly\nenter a real relationship and screw it\nup until i fix this thing\nperfectly said\nright but then how do you even know that\nsomething's wrong\nwhere do you get that idea\nyou're you know\neven you're enlightening me honestly\nbecause i think i'm i've just been\nworking off the like from the conclusion\nbackwards of the\nif i if there was nothing wrong then i\nwouldn't be in the situation coupled\nwith the whole you know initial try\ninsecurity which i was trying to make up\nwith other things in my life\nvery good\nright\nand and so\nyou know going forward the last thing\ni'll kind of leave you with trend and\nthen you're welcome to ask questions and\nstuff if you've got them is like\neven if there is something wrong with\nyou that's okay\nright so so what i want you to really be\nreassured by\nis not you're not perfect i mean no\none's perfect and that's okay\nwhat i want you to really appreciate if\nyou can is that when you enter a\nrelationship with someone that you're\nactually like invested in\nwhat you're giving them is not a\nfinished product but what you're giving\nthem is someone who's willing to work to\nmove forward\nand so no matter what the flaw is no\nmatter what they say about your you know\nlike why are you single because the\nquestion will come up\nyou know and that's where you can even\nbe a little bit honest and you can say\nlike\ni'm not entirely sure\nyou know for a long time i i thought\nthere was something wrong with me and\nthen like i've put my life together in a\nreally meaningful way but like\ni feel like i'm missing something but i\njust don't know what it is and it's okay\nto say that\nand then you can even use a little bit\nof a you know dr k technique and and you\ncan sort of ask them like what do you\nthink is wrong with me\nright\nand how do you feel about asking that\nquestion to someone you care about\nwell\nit goes back to the\nyou know friends or relatives when i\nwould ask them\nyou know\nthey would tell me like hey you know\nlike you know\nwhy aren't you with anybody you know\nlike you seem like to be doing great you\nseem to be\nyou know moving on with your life you\nseem to be quite well off not\nnecessarily financially or anything but\njust like as a human being\num\nso like if i were to ask them i would be\ngenuinely curious to know you know if a\npotential partner let's say i asked them\nhey what do you think is wrong with me\nand the answer if they told me nothing\ni would somehow have doubt in that\nlike i would somehow doubt their answer\nnot because i distrust them\nfundamentally but\nyou know i hate to say this it just\nseems so pessimistic but\ni would be like well you know you just\nhaven't seen it yet\nyeah i mean again\nseeing something i don't even know about\nyeah so then how are you confident that\nthere's something there to see\nexactly no that that's basically the the\nright i'm stuck in yeah so so i i think\nasking a potential partner is going to\nbe really really potentially important\nto you and here's why trent there's a\nbig difference between asking your mom\nwhat's wrong with me and they're saying\noh you're you're so beautiful beta\nyou're trained you're so handsome and\nyou're a catch for anyone\nthat's actually not gonna reassure you\nbut the whole point is that when you ask\nsomeone that you care about\nand they say because that's the opinion\nthat matters right this is what you're\nafraid of\nyeah and when you ask them like hey what\ndo you see like do you see something\nlike fundamentally wrong because like\ni'm not sure\nyeah\nand when they say i don't see anything\nthat's when you need to like be a little\nbit careful right so that's where like\nyou got to think about where you are in\nthe relationship and you can say like\ni'm happy to hear that\nthe right answer is you know if at some\npoint i do something\nthat makes you feel like you know is out\nof line or anything like that please let\nme know because i'm working on myself\nyeah definitely and i'd be completely\nopen to that as well i'm perfect i'm\nalways open to feedback um and to kind\nof working on things that either i or\nother people see in me yeah so so you\nyou wanna\nit's okay for you to doubt right because\nlike you're gonna need to hear that from\nthem a couple of times and at the same\ntime just because this is like hope i\ntheoretically an early stage romantic\nrelationship you don't want to double\ndown on you're wrong you just haven't\nseen it yet\nyou know no that would be internal\nright so good i'm glad you're sort of\nseparating that and then eventually like\nthe second time you have that\nconversation the third time you have\nthat conversation\nit's useful to also use\nlike language like there's a part of me\nso you know the third time you have that\nwhen you're feeling more confident in\nthe relationship you can lean on that\nperson to help you\nyou know deal with that build that\nconfidence and you can sort of say\nthere's a part of me that like is\nterrified that one day like there's\nsomething i i did not expect that i'm\ngoing to kind of screw up\nand and don't own it as truth\nacknowledge that it's a part of your\nmind that has an insecurity\nyeah because you don't want to put the\nburden of fixing all their ins all of\nyour insecurities on them in one\nconversation which is sometimes the way\nthat we actually sabotage relationships\nyeah\nsound good\nabsolutely questions before we wrap up\num\nno i think that was really\nreally really helpful and i really\nappreciate your time and everything that\nyou're doing and\nthank you so much for hearing me out and\nfor doing everything that you do and\nthank you to everybody hopefully this\nhelped somebody else as well oh trent i\nthink it's going to help a ton of people\ni'm i'm happy and\nhopefully i'll i'll implement the things\nyou were talking about as well can i\noffer you a kind word as well\nabsolutely\nso i just want to say thank you for\ncoming on because i think that this is\nthe kind of thing that\nwe talk about issues of lack of\nconfidence\nwith people who really really struggle\nwith confidence what i really appreciate\nabout you calling in is that as we work\non ourselves\ninterestingly enough it doesn't just fix\nall the problems\nand even as we work on ourselves the way\nthat we build confidence we really have\nto sort of tackle it head-on but\nironically we can't really tackle it\nhead-on until we've tried to fix all the\nother dimensions of our life\nand so i really appreciate all the work\nthat you've put in because i think we're\ngetting to explore\na level of insecurity in relationships\nand self-sabotage that oftentimes we\ndon't\nuh explore\nand so i'm so glad that you put in the\nwork and i'm actually like very hopeful\nand and oddly enough confident even\nthough i don't know you\ni'm confident that you really can end up\nin a very positive healthy long-term\nrelationship\nthank you very much it means it means a\nlot to me and uh i wish you a great day\nyou too take care\ntake care thank you\nso bye just do a quick summary\nso\nwhen we grow up with a lack of\nconfidence\nand when we struggle with dating we're\ntold\nput your life together you know focus on\nyourself\nand so we do all those things\nand as we put our life together\nsomething kind of tricky can happen is\nthat as we start to put our life\ntogether and we're sort of ready to date\nas we crave dating sometimes what we'll\ndo is actually create artificial red\nflags in our mind\nto step away from the relationships that\nwe actually want\nwe'll sort of self-sabotage\nwhen we're really like when there's\nsomeone that we have a\npotential of having a real connection\nwith and that self-sabotage actually\ncomes from a place of paradoxically like\nprotection because\ndespite the fact that we've grown in a\nlot of dimensions\nsometimes growing in a lot of dimensions\ndoesn't solve that fundamental\ninsecurity and then we get into a very\ninteresting trap\nwhich is that the more that we put our\nlives together\nthe more we start to be afraid that\nsomething is like wrong with us and that\nsomeone will see through all of the\nfalse work that we've done if i'm 28\nyears old and i have a successful career\nand i'm in shape and stuff like that and\ni start to date someone that i care\nabout we're terrified of the question\nwhy are you single\nwhy are you still single you know why\nhaven't you if you're so perfect like\nwhat am i missing\nand it's the fear that that they're\ngonna see that\nin the the fear of rejection when they\nsort of realize that we're not\neverything that we pretend to be that\ncauses us to actually withdraw from the\nrelationship\nand so even though we want that\nrelationship we actually will come up\nwith excuses to not date the people that\nwe actually want to date with because\nwe're afraid that something like they're\ngoing to realize that there's there's\nsomething going on here so paradoxically\nsometimes\nthe more successful we become\nthe more we sort of start to be afraid\nthat\nsomething's fundamentally wrong with us\nbecause i'm so successful why am i still\nsingle well in order to balance that out\nright because if i become successful\nover here in order to balance that out i\nneed something very very negative and i\njust don't know what it is because i fix\neverything that i needed to work on\nand so paradoxically like the more we\nsucceed the more we feel paralyzed in\nterms of dating and sometimes that can\nmanifest actually a self-sabotage so\nfantastic caller and thank you very much\nfor calling\nyou"
