    "transcript": "I'm an attractive woman therefore\neverything for me is supposed to be easy\nand this is what's so devastating about\nit is when things are supposed to be\neasy for you\nhow does that make you feel when they're\nhard a perspective on female loneliness\noh I guess you guys can't see this\ncorner but that's okay\nI wasn't sure if I should post my\nexperience since it's deeply personal\nbut I've seen similar posts by other\nwomen here and decided to just go for it\nI'm a 29 year old woman who is above\naverage looking I've been hit on a lot\nin life and get uncomfortable amounts of\nattention I never asked for\nhowever I've suffered from social\nanxiety since I've been a child because\nof trauma abuse and bullying I was\npainfully shy until my mid-20s and would\nhardly speak to anyone I have no contact\nwith my family because they abused me I\nnever had a Social Circle I've never\nbeen in a long-term relationship I only\nhave two quote friends who also suffer\nfrom mental illness\nthey don't know the extent of my issues\nthough and they both live very far away\nI spend every day isolated from the rest\nof the world in my room and hardly get\nsleep at night because of my insomnia\nout there I study and nobody could ever\nguess I'm living this way\nmy social anxiety has gotten better to\nthe point that I can fake it but I am\nentirely inaccessible as a person\nwhen people talk to me I listen and\nreply but I never talk about my own life\nsometimes I lie when I have to\npeople often say women can't be lonely\nyet I've never been in love and simply\ncan't form deep connections with others\nthe only relationship I last I had\nlasted about six months and the guy had\nzero interest in knowing me as a person\nwhen I ended things he openly admitted\nthat he only dated me for my looks\nI struggled to act normal and tried to\ntried being in a relationship like\neveryone else for six painful months and\nhe had no idea who I even was\nI have accepted that I can never be in\nlove despite my painful craving to love\nsomeone and truly be loved\nmy sex drive is high but I never act on\nit because I despise the idea of casual\nsex\nsome would say but you could have sex\nanytime you want to yes I could but it\nwouldn't mean anything it wouldn't fix\nmy loneliness it would just make it\nworse to know that my looks are my only\nvalue\nI already zoned out of the real world\nmentally outside of studying I only live\nin my Daydreams and stories I write my\nroom is filled with merchandise of\nfictional characters I talk to them\nact like they would be the support of\nfriends I never had I've been quote\nunquote in love with a fictional\ncharacter for almost 15 years that's the\nclosest feeling I ever felt to loving\nsomeone he's pretty much the reason I'm\nnot killing myself I even lack the\nability to connect with people online\nI'm not part of any Community or group I\ndon't have social media or play online\ngames it's almost like I don't even\nexist\nI'm not posting this to get advice or\npity I just wanted to share my story\nsomewhere for once I've long accepted\nthat this will be my life forever what\nI'm trying to say is being an attractive\nwoman doesn't magically turn life into\neasy mode women are people too and you\nnever know what they are hiding just by\nlooking at them\nfinding casual sex or even a random\nrelationship with no depth would be easy\nfor me but it's not worth [ __ ] when you\nwant nothing more than a genuine human\nconnection\nupdate I didn't expect to receive so\nmany comments support or DMS over this\npost I and I never thought so many\npeople could actually relate to it thank\nyou for that I can't reply to everything\nnow because I it's a bit overwhelming\nbut I'm reading everything\nso\nfirst thing that I want to say is this\nperson says I've never been part of a\ncommunity\nand I just want to say and I hope that I\nthink they've already figured this out\nso I'm late to the party here\nif you've never been part of a community\nyou're welcome here\num that's the first thing now\nI was tempted to say\nwell you're a part of this one well\nthat's your choice\nit's not for me to say that you are a\npart of this community or you aren't a\npart of this community what I can say is\nthat you're welcome here\nI don't know if that kind of makes sense\nbut it's arrogant for me to assume that\nthis person feels like this is their\nCommunity right if this person doesn't\nfeel like this is their Community like\nthat's on that's them you know they're\nentitled to that so what I will say is\nthat you're welcome here and if you'd\nlike to join I think it's fair to say\nwe'd love to have you\nthat's what we're going to start with\nbut I think this post is really really\nimportant\nbecause it tackles or addresses a lot of\nwhat we sometimes lose sight of\nso\na lot of people out there think that\nbeing pretty\nmeans translates into equates having\nfriends having lovers\nhaving boyfriends girlfriends whatever\nthey think that\nbeing physically attractive\nis a miracle drug is a Panacea\nfor fixing all of the problems in life\nand\nthe truth of the matter is that it isn't\nand this is what's sometimes so hard for\nother people to understand because if we\nlive in a society\nwhere being pretty means that your life\nis easy\nwhat do you say if you are pretty and\nyour life isn't easy\nright how do you get people to\nunderstand because everyone kind of\nlooks at you and says like you're pretty\nlike what are you complaining about you\ncould get laid anytime you want to of\ncourse you could have a relationship\nand there may be people out there that\nthat would say I would love to date you\nright I I want to see you as a person\nyou know like I\nI don't I don't get it\neveryone out there is craving something\nthat if you're attractive or you're a\nwoman or whatever right if you've got\nsome kind of Advantage everyone out\nthere is craving something and you're\ncraving it too\nthe challenge is that paradoxically\nthe advantage that everyone thinks\nwill make your life easy can sometimes\nactually make your life difficult\nand that's something that it's very hard\nto explain to people who are not\nin a frame of mind to listen to what\nyour challenge challenges are because\nyou have something that they don't have\nright I don't know if that sentence was\ntoo complex so I'll try to say it again\nbut like\nsometimes so let's try to understand\na little bit right so I'm going to\ngeneralize here which is the first\nmistake but like what it's like to be\nlike an attractive human being\nespecially a woman isn't Just About\nWomen by the way\nso when you do enter into a relationship\nsometimes what people will do if you're\nattractive is they'll just see the the\nphysical attractiveness\nright that's what they're interested in\nand this person is even having an\nexperience where someone dated them for\nsix months because of the way that they\nlooked\nand so it's kind of weird and we may\nsort of say that okay physical\nattractiveness makes it easy for you to\nget into relationships and that may be\ntrue but my point is that that's not\nsufficient\nto deal with the crushing loneliness\nthat you feel and in fact sometimes it\ncan even reinforce it\nbecause why is this person in a\nrelationship it's not because of me it's\nbecause of the way that I look\nright\nI'm one accident away of having no value\nbecause if I get into a car accident or\nif I trip and fall and I get a scar on\nmy face or I break my nose or something\nlike that then I have no value at all\nso the really challenging thing\nsometimes about people who are\nattractive is that their value starts to\nbecome based\non their attraction\nbecause society as a whole thinks okay\nthis has so many advantages like this is\nyour worth\nand that's actually like their\nexperience\nand so I want you all to think about\nthis a little bit\nbecause if you're an attractive woman\nand you get a job\nwhat do people attribute your success to\nare you being hired to\nif you get promoted what do they\nattribute your success to\nnow this is kind of tricky right because\nmost people will actually attribute it\nto your value as a person to your work\nethic\nlet's be fair\nthe challenge is that some people don't\nright some people will say like oh she\njust got the job because she's hot or\nshe got promoted because she's sleeping\nwith the boss and they kind of make\nthese kind of comments and they make\nthese kind of jokes we're not saying\nthat the majority of people are like\nthis\nso then why do we even bring it up the\nmajority of people aren't like this like\nwhy does it matter right like if like 98\nto 95 of people don't say things like\nthis\nwhat difference does it make why are we\nfocusing on the two percent so let me\nask y'all a question\nhow many people does it take to ruin\nyour day\nhow many people does it take to ruin\nyour life\nhow many people does it take to turn an\nachievement into Ash\nthis is why we talk about it\nand this is what's so hard about being\nin a situation like this\nif you're lonely and you're attractive\nand we're going to get to we're going to\ntalk more about that\nright and you have one relationship\nwhere the person even says like they\ndon't treat you like a person right like\nthey're like really interested in your\nlooks and you kind of like you try to\nmake it work right because you're like\nokay I'm lonely what's the antidote like\nI need to be in a relationship okay\nthat's like fine someone get this\nperson's nice they're being really nice\nto me they're getting me flowers we're\ngoing on dates and whatnot where you\nknow dating for six months but like the\nmore you're in that relationship you\nstart to feel like there's not a\nconnection here\nand then you break up with them because\nyou you torture yourself\nfor months in this relationship trying\nto find a connection with another human\nbeing\nand then when when you end up when you\nend the relationship because you're not\ngetting a connection they're even like\nyeah by the way I wasn't really\ninterested in you as a person and that\nhurts that sinks in deep\nit confirms everything that you fear\nso the challenge here is that sometimes\nwe have advantages and there there's\ndata for example that shows that\nattractive people get particular\nadvantages in life we're not disputing\nthat\nthe key thing is that somewhere along\nthe way we started to take the\nadvantages that let's say Attractive\npeople face\nwomen sorry the advantages that\nattractive people receive that women\nreceive that tall men receive you know\nyou can take whatever you want like you\ncan take whatever Advantage there are\nall kinds of advantages\nhaving hair\nright that's an advantage people treat\nyou differently\nand somewhere along the way we started\ngatekeeping suffering if someone has an\nadvantage\nand we started to invalidate people's\nexperiences around this we started to\nsay that by the way if you're attractive\nyou're not allowed to be lonely\nyou're not allowed to be socially\nanxious because everyone would want to\nbe friends with an attractive person\nright because there's actually data that\nshows that that maybe I mean actually I\ndon't know that I've looked at that but\nI'm sure that there's papers out there\nthat show that attractive people are\nhave more friendships\nthe non-attractive people\nright it's not a surprising finding\nbut here's the thing to understand is\nthat each and every one of us is an\nindividual human being\nand that no one feature of us\ndetermines who we are as a person and in\nfact the reason that this makes us so\nlonely is because sometimes if we're\nattractive it's like that one feature is\nthe only thing that other people see and\nthat's not just about attractiveness\nright this is something that's\ngeneralizable as well where you may be\nsomeone whose entire life or what\neveryone looks at when they see you is\ndetermined by one feature\nI'm the oldest son of a business mogul\ntherefore the weight of the world's\nexpectations are on my shoulders\nI'm an attractive woman therefore\neverything for me is supposed to be easy\nand this is what's so devastating about\nit is when things are supposed to be\neasy for you\nhow does that make you feel when they're\nhard\nbecause everyone's telling you hey life\nis supposed to be easy you got you got\nthe golden ticket\nyou're playing life on easy mode\nit's devastating\nbecause failing at life is one thing but\nfailing at life finding easy mode\ndestroys\nWho You Are\ndestroys your capacity for self-love\nso what do we do about this\nthe first thing to understand is that\nsometimes people who are in this cycle\nand it sounds like this person in a\nsense is not in this cycle but I still\nwant to kind of talk about it\nsometimes when we have one feature\nwhich we think\nshould fix loneliness\nokay\nor the world tells us invalidates us if\nwe say we're lonely\nwe can use that feature as a crutch to\nconnect with other people so if you're\nan attractive woman and you feel lonely\nsometimes what you'll fall into is\ncasual sexual relationships\nand you're looking for more but\nsometimes that feeling of loneliness is\nso heavy and so crippling\nthat you'll use anything you can to make\nit go away for a little while\nright because the truth of the matter is\nthat that feeling of loneliness has a\nneurochemical component\nso after after having sex with someone\nand after like laying with them like\nyou'll get this release of oxytocin\nand this is once again an\noversimplification but oh oxytocin is\none of the hormones that we use to bond\nso it's responsible for like maternal uh\ninfant bonding\nit's also responsible for like bonding\nin romantic relationships it's part of\nthe reason why Friends with Benefits can\nsometimes be hard\nor specifically cuddling after engaging\nin sexual relations with a friend friend\nwith benefits will start to create\nCatching Feelings it's part of the\nreason that we catch feelings\nand so if you're if you're lonely and\nyou're craving human connection\nit turns out that sex can give you a\npiece of that\nis an interesting aside some people have\neven found research or some people have\ndone research on why people with\nschizophrenia have difficulty forming\nemotional connections with other people\nand they've one of the theories they've\ntraced it back to is actually oxytocin\ndeficiencies\nand so some people were pretty\npioneering and they thought okay what if\nwe artificially give people\nuh oxytocin nasal spray because that's\nthe delivery thing that they did so they\ndid clinical trials on oxytocin nasal\nspray for people with schizophrenia to\nsee if they could help them form like\nrelationships and emotional bonds turns\nout that the data wasn't really good and\nit didn't seem to be very effective it\nwas really interesting kind of side note\nso sometimes we'll when we're really\nlonely we'll use anything that we can to\nget our needs met right you want to\nCrave some kind of you're craving that\nconnection so much you'll even engage in\nsex\nand it sounds like this person has sort\nof tried this the Casual Sex route and\nit sort of didn't work for them which I\nthink is like a step in the right\ndirection\nso be a little bit careful about\nwhat you use to get your needs met\nbecause if you do use sex to connect\nwith another person\nbecause it does sort of like engage\noxytocin for them it engages oxytocin\nfor you there's some amount of balding I\nmean bonding\nFreudian slip of the year\nthere's some amount of bonding but that\nbonding too is somewhat artificial that\nconnection that you're forming with them\nis based on\nthem not knowing who you are and then\nsomething really devastating can happen\nbecause over time you can start to learn\nthat the only way for me to get this is\nthrough sex\nbecause in your life you're lonely\nyou're lonely you're lonely until you\nhave sex with someone and then for a few\nmoments you're connected\nand then over time if that's the only\nway you can connect to people what does\nthat do to your sense of identity it\ncripples it\nbecause now the only thing that I'm\nworth\nthe only worth that I bring as a person\nis through my body that's the only way I\ncan connect with people\nand so interestingly enough what we tend\nto see and this is this is not just\nabout attractive women who are lonely\nbut this is also about people who engage\nin unhealthy sexual relationships and\nuse sex as a coping mechanism and things\nlike that\nwe sort of create this vicious cycle\nwhere I'm getting my needs met through\nsome kind of unhealthy relationship and\nthe unhealthy relationship actually\nreinforces\nthe negative parts of myself that make\nit hard for me to connect\nbecause if I'm not worth any more than\nmy body\nthen why would anyone ever want to\nconnect with me\nI can't risk showing people what I\nreally am because what I am is ugly but\nwhat I look like is attractive\nand so you're terrified to actually\nengage with people even though you crave\nit\nso the first thing to do is if you're in\nthat cycle understand that cycle\nnow the second thing that I want to\ncomment on is I imagine that there are\nsome people who are listening to this\nwho may be reacting strongly to it\nso here are a couple of the reactions\nthat I'm envisioning\nokay\nsome people may say\nI'm lonely and unattractive\nbut I'd take sex plus loneliness over\nlonely loneliness plus no sex any day of\nthe week\nright even having sex is like one step\nup\nand there are some people out there who\nare who are craving a sexual\nrelationship\nand the thought of I can get laid\nanytime that I want to sounds like the\nHoly Grail to them\nthey're like what is this person\ncomplaining about this sounds amazing\nthere may be other people who are sort\nof reacting to this as well which is\nlike you you know sort of like once\nagain what is this person complaining\nabout there's so many advantages to\nbeing an attractive woman in the world\nI don't get it\nif you're listening to this and you're\nreacting that way I want you to notice\nwhat you are doing to the other person\nwith your reaction\nthis person is telling you that they're\nsuffering they have something that\ngranted you don't have\nand there may be advantages to that and\nyou can want that thing\nbut you're just assuming that their\nexperience is incorrect and you're\nactually depriving them of the\ncapacity to suffer and connect with\nother people because what you're doing\nis judging them right you're not you're\njust sort of like you're not like\nactually like acknowledging who they are\nas a person and and treating them with\ncompassion you're actually saying like\nwhy are you complaining\nnow here's the key thing to understand\nif you're having that reaction which is\nokay\nwhen you try to demonstrate your\nsuffering and your humanness to other\npeople how did they react to you\nwhen you said I'm lonely\nwhen you said\nit's impossible for me to find a date\nwhen you said I'm never gonna get laid\nwhat did the world say to you\nLOL what just work on yourself\njust untake the black pill\nit's all in your head\nyou can fix it\nthe world did to you exactly what you're\ndoing to this person\nand when the world does that when the\nworld invalidates us\nsometimes what we do is we lean into a\ncommunity that says yes yes yes your\nsuffering is Justified your suffering is\nreal\nright and then we separate\nyou know I'm not saying that there\naren't some people who have some\nadvantages in life\nbut my overwhelming experience has been\nthat advantages or advantages make no\nmistake\nso I still remember for example being a\nmedical student\nand having female colleagues and walking\ninto a patient's room\nand the patient assumes that I'm a\ndoctor when I'm just a medical student\nand they assume that year actually they\nassume that Mike later on when I'm\nactually a doctor and I have resident\ncolleagues assuming that the their\ndoctor is actually a nurse\nso I got treated like a doctor when I\nwasn't one because I'm a man an Indian\nand I had female colleagues who got\ntreated as nurses when they were doctors\nso we're not saying that these things\ndon't exist my point is that those\nthings don't automatically translate to\nhappiness and I've seen this as a\npsychiatrist working with people who are\nstruggling because they're homeless and\nworking with people who are struggling\nbecause they're Partners at investment\nBanks\ninto something that by the way it's not\njust me right there's also Buddha who\nsort of said this\nand there's some research to that sort\nof contradicts it which we have to\nacknowledge right so we know that for\nexample a certain amount of Financial\nSecurity does correlate with happiness\nso we're not saying that there isn't an\ninfluence\nbut what I want you to really focus on\nis how you treat this person\nbecause this is really important when\nsomeone posts and we talk about it we\ntalk about what they should do\ndifferently\nwe give them all of the responsibility\nright oh I'm stuck what should I do how\ncan I connect with people and we're\ngoing to talk a little bit more about\nwhat this person can do but this is\nsomething that's really important to\nunderstand if someone is struggling out\nthere it's not necessarily entirely\ntheir fault\nall of us are products of our\nenvironment\nwe're products of the judgments that\npeople face that people give us\ntheir lives are also determined by the\njudgments we make\nand so if you're listening to this post\nand it's making you feel resentful\nbecause I don't understand why this\nperson is complaining I have it so much\nharder\nI'm not saying you don't have it harder\nwhat I'm saying is that comparing who\nhas it harder doesn't actually help\nI did three months of work on a trauma\nunit\nand then also was on call and stuff for\nyears on the same trauma unit got called\na lot\nand one of the things that we found is\nthat people would instinctively compare\ntheir trauma oh you were emotionally\nabused I was physically abused you were\nphysically abused I was sexually abused\nand it doesn't help\nright why do people do that it's because\nthey themselves when you shared your\nstory of suffering people invalidated\nyou\nthey said you don't deserve to suffer\nlike what are you complaining about\nyou're a male incel there's male\nprivilege\nright and then the insults are saying oh\nthere's like women privilege they can\nget laid whenever they want to like my\npoint is like it's not about the\nstatistics it's about how we treat each\nother as human beings\nwhen someone else says they suffer\nhow do you respond to that\nwhen you shared your suffering how did\nsomeone else respond to you and that's\nwhat I really commend about this person\nbecause this person is saying this is my\nexperience and what I'm really proud of\nis that this is a community where we\nhave heard this person\nand we've said we hear you it sounds\ntough and by the way this is me I didn't\nknow that attractive women could feel\nthis way\nright which is awesome that's where AOE\nhealing comes from\nso I said at the beginning I'll say it\nagain\nyou're welcome here\nnow last thing to talk about so one\nthing is we talked about the cycle right\nnext thing to talk about\nis what do you do if you're kind of in\nthis situation\nso generally speaking when I when I\nencounter situations like this we do see\nthis cycle\nof\nbeing judged because of the way that you\nlook your identity starts to form kind\nof like it almost gets split off whether\nthis is like the real me and this is the\nway that the world treats me\nand the more that I get judged by about\nthe way that I look the more isolated I\nfeel and the less good of a person I\nkind of become in my own head I don't\nknow if that sort of makes sense but so\nfor example like let's say I get\npromoted and people make comments and\nhow many comments does it take to ruin\nyour day\nright so like if you get\nif you have a birthday party\nand 10 people bring gifts\nand one of them is a pile of feces\nthat's going to ruin your day even if\nthe other nine gifts were really great\nif 10 people there if nine people are\nlike hey you're a really awesome person\nwe really love having you in our life\nand one person is like here's a pile of\nfeces you're a waste of space I hope you\ncease to exist\nright it doesn't like that that's the\nthe fundamental problem with the world\nwhich is that it's so much easier to\nhurt than it is to help\nand so the challenge here is that as we\ndevelop and as we start getting treated\na particular way because of our identity\nwe start to realize oh like like here's\nmy worth as a human being here's all the\nsuccesses and failures I have but if I'm\npretty and more people attribute it to\nmy attractiveness then my actual sense\nof self kind of like Falls and goes in\nthe other direction\ndoes that kind of make sense because the\nmore that people start to talk about my\nachievements being due to my\nattractiveness or due to my wealth or\ndue to my advantages\nthe more\nI start to feel bad about myself\nand the more I start to be feel bad\nabout myself the more that I compensate\nin different kinds of ways like I\ndevelop a strong ego or narcissistic\ndefense mechanisms\nand you all can even see that like in\nthe mass media with public figures\nright there are some people out there\nwho when they accomplish things\nno one says hey good job that's actually\npretty impressive what everyone says is\noh you just got there because\nyou were born with advantages and then\nwe'll also potentially even see\nthe egotistical responses\nand then it just becomes a cycle\nright because the thought of compassion\ntowards that person is mind-blowing like\nwhat\nso what do you do if you're kind of in\nthis situation where you've been taught\nor you've learned this lesson that your\nworth is based on your attractiveness\nso I I know it's going to sound kind of\nhard but what you should do is find out\nwho you are\nso who you are is not determined by how\nyou're treated\nthat's why we call one how you're\ntreated\nright how people relate to you it's a\ntreatment it's not who you are\nthe problem is that we tend to conflate\nthe two\nand for people who are more egotistical\nwhose aham goddess are stronger\nwhat we tend to find is that who they\nare is how they are treated\nso and you know in Psychiatry this is\nlike when we look at narcissism\nso people treat me with respect I feel\nlike I'm on top of the world but if\npeople treat me with disrespect I'm a\nhorrible human being\nand so how do I protect myself in that\nsituation I have to force people to\ntreat me with respect\nbecause I can't tolerate\nwhen they don't\nbecause if they don't treat me with\nrespect then my sense of identity is\ndetermined by how I'm treated\nand you'll see this which is why like\npeople always have to be the center of\nattention they can't tolerate criticism\netc etc\nso you have to find out who you are\nhow do you do that\nso I recognize that you're lonely\nI think there are a couple of different\nways to find out who you are and we're\ngoing to kind of speed run this right\nthis is like the topic of potentially a\nwhole guide\nbut a couple things the first is to\nspend time with yourself\nand you may say but I'm lonely I do that\nall day\nthere's a subtle difference\nthere's a difference between being at\nhome and wanting to be with someone else\nand spending time with yourself\nso like\nyou know before stream today I went for\na walk\nand I went for a walk with myself\nand I just spent time letting my\nthoughts happen thinking through stuff I\nrecognize that I need some time\nwith myself\nwe need to like work through a couple\nthings figure out what to do figure out\nwhat we're going to do today how we're\ngoing to handle an extra stream this\nweek Etc et cetera\nsometimes I love this I'll go eat on my\nown at a restaurant when I get a chance\nto\nand people may look at you and think\nlike oh my God like this person is so\npathetic they're eating alone\nit's like they can think that if they\nwant to I just really want to enjoy my\nfood my way I don't have to want to have\nto you know sometimes like usually I go\nout to eat with my kids for example\nright but like going out to eat with\nyour kids is like I don't really have\ntime to\nenjoy my food because I have to worry\nabout feeding them ordering for them\nthey're flopping around they want to\nwatch a screen things like it's like\nit's chaos\nI'm wolfing down my food in between like\nyou know trying to feed them bites and\nmake sure they're not like the elbow\nisn't going to hit if you guys have\nyoung kids you'll know this the elbow\nisn't going to knock their cup of water\nover\nso spend time with yourself go for a\nhike I think nature is fantastic that\nway\nso if we really look at it like if ego\nties to how other people perceive us one\nway that we can get away from that whole\ncomplex is nature because nature doesn't\ncare\nlike if you go for a hike and you go\nalone\nversus go with someone else like let me\ngive you a couple scenarios\nlet's say that I'm going for a four hour\nhike two hours in I start to feel tired\nand I'm like maybe I should turn back\nand then if you're with someone\nyou choose not to turn back why don't\nyou turn back because you don't want to\nbe perceived as weak\nand so even if you accomplish your goal\ndo you feel pride in it no I hiked for\nthe avoidance of weakness\nit's actually enhances the ego and makes\nyou more insecure if you go by yourself\nyou're on the first two hours of the\nhike\nand I recognize it's a four hour hike\nand we said turn around so it's four\nhours either way but whatever\nit's it's a four hour Trail eight hour\nhike back and forth\nyou can turn back anytime you want to No\nOne's Gonna judge you but you\nif you achieved it you achieved it if\nyou didn't achieve it you didn't achieve\nit\nNo One's Gonna clap\nNo One's Gonna say you're weak no one's\ngoing to give you any reaction except\nfor yourself\nyou're not going to post about it on\nInstagram maybe you will\nbut you shouldn't\nit's really important for you to test\nyourself if you want to find out who you\nare you have to test yourself and\nwhether you succeed or you fail you're\nthe only one that knows\nand so if you decide to push through and\nyou say you know what I'm not going to\ngive up\nI'm going to keep going\nno matter what and you get to the top of\nthe mountain no one's there\nyou don't even feel elated\nyou feel like thank God it's over\nnow I have to go back down\nno one's clapping for you no one's\nsaying oh you're such an amazing human\nbeing look try for the human Spirit like\nyou walked for four hours at a mild\nincline like great job\nthat's what you're going to be telling\nyourself\nthis is no achievement\nbecause that's the toxic part of you\nthat's the part of you that's created\nwhen you can't connect with another\nhuman being\nand you do that enough times and you'll\nstart to realize you know what that\nactually isn't true\nI did do it and I can be proud of this\nI gotta start somewhere even if I can't\nbe proud of it\nif you can't be proud of it no big deal\nyou did it\nyou put your mind to it and you did it\nso find out who you are and that happens\nfirst and foremost with yourself\nsecond thing\nfourth thing\nI don't know lost track of numbering\nis I think that you've\nyou know reach out to someone else in an\nauthentic way which is kind of what this\nperson did\nright so no one is going to appreciate\nyou for who you are\nunless you actually show them\nand this is where things get really\ntricky\nbecause if you really show them who you\nare\nyou open the door to rejection\nand especially if you're like like in\nthis case an attractive woman who's\nlonely\nthat's gonna like it's so devastating\nright because if I pretend to be okay\nthen I'm attractive everyone thinks my\nlife is great but then if I turn to them\nand I say hey by the way I'm actually\nreally struggling really lonely and I\nhave difficulty connecting with other\nhuman beings\nwhat what's so terrifying about that is\nif they turn to you and say what on\nEarth are you talking about you're so\nattractive you shouldn't have problems\nso in that moment you're opening the\ndoor for them to reject you\nthe challenge of being connected with\nanother human being\nis in order to be accepted by someone\nthe door must be open for them to reject\nyou as well\nand we're so afraid of that rejection\nthat we can never risk it and therefore\nwe can never give someone the chance to\naccept us\nand so we stay stuck\nI think the good news\nis that a lot of that is in our head\nright I'm not saying that mean people\ndon't exist out there right so this\nperson had an experience with a\nboyfriend who was basically very shallow\nbut people in our community exist too\nwhere this person shared this and there\nwere people who were there willing to\nlisten and and be compassionate and\nstuff like that and like I've said it a\nthousand times I'm gonna say it a\nthousand more times healthy gamer is\nmore than Dr k\nwho helped this person connect with\nother human beings it wasn't Dr K the\nwork has been done\nit's y'all\nright this person is overwhelmed\nby the responses and support and they\ndon't have time to reply to all of the\npeople who are responding that's y'all\nthat ain't me\nso be a little bit careful about who you\nopen up to by all means\nbut you've got to give people a chance\nto reject you if you want to be accepted\nso a couple of things just to kind of\nrecap\nto someone posted about being an\nattractive woman who's lonely\nand for a slice of humanity a slice of\nthe internet that does not compute\nbecause being attractive\nis the antidote to loneliness right if\nyou're attractive especially a woman\nthen you should be able to make friends\nvery easily you can get laid anytime you\nwant to oh my God\nsounds so amazing\nthe truth of the matter is that any\nadvantage\nis never a substitute for like happiness\nand will protect you 100 from suffering\ndo advantages give us advantages yeah do\nthey help out some absolutely or some of\nthem pretty big absolutely\nand yet they're not a substitute for\nconnection\nright attractiveness is not a substitute\nfor connection and in fact sometimes\nthis is what people who really struggle\nis that sometimes Attractive people are\nmore lonely\nwhen I say more I'm creating a\ncomparison so let's step away from that\nstatement actually are incredibly lonely\nlet's use that\nso\nwhy are they incredibly lonely because\nanytime someone interacts with them\nthey're not interacting with a person\nthey're interacting with the shell of a\nperson\nthey're not interacting with you they're\ninteracting with your appearance\nand the more that people interact with\nyour appearance and all they see\nis the appearance instead of the person\nThe More Lonely the person becomes\nthe real challenge here\nis that if you share that with people\nthey're gonna be upset\nbecause there are people out there who\nare hurt and lonely themselves and don't\nhave that advantage\ninstead of going to turn to you and say\nhow dare you complain\nbecause I'm in the same situation except\nI'm not even attractive\nand in that moment they invalidate your\nexperience\nwhy do they do that because that was\nthat is what was done to them\nbecause when they reached out for help\nwhen they said I'm struggling\nI can't even have sex I've never had sex\nand I'm gonna die a virgin\nand men can say this women can say this\nnon-binary people can say this\nmaybe asexual people say this I don't\nreally know\nright because sometimes they're not\ninterested in it which is totally fine\nanyone can say this\nbut when you said when people said this\nremember once again the majority of\npeople may said wow that must be hard\nfor you but all it takes is a couple of\npeople to say wow it's all in your head\nif you were just did this you could\nengage in a sexual relationship\nso it can actually be really invalid it\ncan be hard\nright because now you've tried to open\nthe door you've tried to connect with\nanother person what has someone else\ndone slammed it in your face\nso what do you do about this the first\nis be a little bit careful\nabout what\nthe dirty tricks you'll use to satisfy\nyour loneliness\nI don't just mean sexual I mean\ngeneralizing it for a reason right so\nthere are certain things that we'll do\nto get people\nto help us feel less lonely but in an\ninauthentic way\nsneaky way\nsometimes we'll offer sex\nsometimes we'll offer money\nright oh I'll pay for all my friends\nI'll pay so they come\nright I'm gonna have a birthday party\nand I'm gonna pay for all the food I'm\ngonna take everyone out to dinner that\nway people will show up\nwe'll use some of our advantages\nto make us feel less lonely\nbut in those moments what we're actually\ndoing is reinforcing our loneliness\nbecause it's not an authentic connection\nwe're buying it paying a particular\nprice\nso you've got to be super careful about\nthat cycle especially because sometimes\nas you become lonely there's only one\nthing that works\nright which is at times you know for\nwomen or men like offering your physical\nform offering your body or offering\nmoney and then that's the only way that\nwe know to find connection but the more\nthat we connect with people that way it\nlike reinforces the problem because\nthey're not connecting with me they're\nnot showing up at my birthday party\nbecause they like me they're showing up\nat my birthday party for the free food\nbut that's the only way that I can get\nthem to come and I don't want to\nbe alone on my birthday because that\nhurts too much\nso be aware of that cycle\nand the next thing\nis get in touch with yourself\nfind out who you are\nsaying that you have trouble connecting\nwith other people sometimes the hardest\nreason to connect with other people is\nbecause we're not sure who we are we\ndon't know what there is to connect to\nwe don't know am I good on the inside or\nam I bad on the inside am I someone\nwho's worth being friends with with one\nday and if you don't have that\nconfidence in yourself it's so hard to\nconnect with people because there's a\nlot of uncertainty\nwhat if I'm not actually worth\nconnecting with\nso how do you find that you spend time\nwith yourself\nyou start to realize and this is what it\nlooks like after you know healthy work\nthat I am who I am not everyone is going\nto like it\nand that's okay\nmy value as a human being is not\ndetermined by getting this particular\nperson to like me and this particular\nperson to hang out to me with me but\noftentimes When we struggle with our own\nidentity that's what it turns into\nand suddenly this person's opinion\nmeans the world to us and if this person\nagrees to go on a date with me it means\nI'm a good human being and if this\nperson doesn't agree to go on a date\nwith me it means I'm a bad human being\nthe next thing that you've got to do to\nconnect is open the door for rejection\nbecause in order for someone to truly\naccept you which is what connectedness\nfeels like right to really connect with\nsomeone is to have someone see you and\nsay hey I recognize your flawed hey I\nrecognize you're a complex human being\nand I like you anyway\nbecause when you're attractive\nI like you despite who you are I\nappreciate the attractiveness outweighs\nthe bad stuff\nand if we really want to connect with\npeople that needs to change\nyou can't have people accepting you\nbecause you're attractive despite the\nbad stuff you need actually people to\naccept you\nkind of no matter what\nright you want people to accept you\nin spite of your flaws and not for any\nother particular reason for for them to\nsay it's okay that you have your flaws\nthat your flaws are over here your\nadvantages over here it's not because\none outweighs the other it's because\nboth of them are you and I accept you\nwhole package\nit's not about a balancing or like\nhitting a certain threshold\nthe last thing to consider\nin terms of being seen\nis you can absolutely work with a\ntherapist especially if you've got\nproblems with like social anxiety or\nthings like that\nif\nso I'd recommend a clinical evaluation\nif you haven't gotten one to see if\nreally therapy is appropriate for you\nand if it isn't appropriate for you or I\nmean it can still be appropriate even if\nyou're not clinically ill and you find a\ngood therapist that can be very very\nhelpful\nbut part of what we tend to see actually\nin coaching and coaching is that women\nwho are in this situation do really\nreally well in coaching\npeople have trouble connecting and we\nhave kind of data behind that so not\npublished or anything like that but we\ndo a lot of internal data to try to\nfigure out okay who can we actually help\nand it turns out that we have good\noutcomes around women who struggle with\ndiscovering who they are and facing\njudgment from the world\neven in career coaching we sort of see\nthat a fair amount where like women are\nstruggling to figure out like okay how\ndo I represent myself well in the\nworkplace how do I deal with toxicity in\nthe workplace things like that\nit's a great question blenhees is asking\nwhen people come to us and share\nexperiences like that on the Internet or\nIRL how do we know when it's just\nventing and when they need actual advice\nit's a great question and my answer is\ngoing to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek\nso oftentimes they will tell you\nI'm not posting this for advice or pity\nand if they don't tell you\nyou can ask\nright I know it sounds like a simple\nanswer but like that's honestly like I\nmean even when people come into my\noffice I'll just ask like you know ask\nthem you're sharing all this stuff with\nme what are you you know does it feel\ngood to get it off of your chest and is\nthat really what you're looking for or\nyou know do you want to like\ndo a little bit more back and forth are\nyou looking for guidance are you looking\nfor support that's usually those are the\ntwo words that I'll\nuse\nbecause venting and advice seem have\ncertain connotations to them so you can\njust ask them\nyeah triple stand is saying are you\nlooking for feedback or do you just want\nto vent\noftentimes I find that it's a safe bet\nto assume it's just venting and if they\nwant advice they will ask for it\nso I tend to default to support as\nopposed to guidance\na question what if there are conditions\nor boundaries that impact the connection\nfor example someone says they aren't\nready for love but they want to be\ntreated as as though they are loved so\nAbby Des uh\nis that's a great question so that's\nwhere\nthe tricky thing there\nis that there's usually like I'm I'm\nassuming that there's another person in\nthat relationship right so I want to be\ntreated as as though they're loved but\naren't ready for love\nthat can put the other person in a very\nvery awkward situation because you're\nasking them to like\nyou know that's confusing how do you\ntreat someone with love who's Not Ready\nFor Love or like what does that mean to\nthem\nso I think the first thing to understand\nis that just because someone wants\nsomething if they're not ready for it\ndoesn't probably means that they need to\ndo some work\nright because\nthey have it that sounds to me like that\nneeds to be explored more or resolved in\nsome way\nand if you're trying to have a\nrelationship with that person I'm not\neven saying romantic I can be platonic\nit can be parental whatever\nthat can be really confusing for you so\nI would clarify what that means\nright so treat it as though they are\nloved like what does that mean\nand you know what does it mean to not be\nready for love like help me understand\nlike what that means and if you're the\nperson who feels that way where you feel\nlike I want to be treated with love but\nI'm not ready for love you need to ask\nyourself what does that mean\nwhat makes it so that you aren't ready\nfor love what makes it so that you want\nto be treated with love like what is\nthat what is that if you get treated\nthat way what is that satisfying what\nhunger does that fill\nso I think it's a great starting point\nbut requires further exploration"
