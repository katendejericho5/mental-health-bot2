    "transcript": "recently I've been invited on a bunch of\npodcasts and so Dr K has been exposed to\na lot of different people so we're\nseeing a lot of new people come into our\ncommunity and what I'd love to do today\nis share my perspective on meditation\nwhich is a core part of who we are at\nhealthy gamer and help other people\nunderstand how to make meditation easy\nand effective for you so today we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about why\nit's hard for most people to meditate\nand my approach to meditation\nso I think the biggest thing to\nunderstand the biggest mistake that most\npeople make is that we have to remember\nthat every human being has a unique\ncognitive fingerprint we all know that\ndifferent people have different\npreferences for color for Cuisine for\nthe way that they like to do their\nRecreation some of us like some kinds of\ngames some of us like to read some of us\nlike to read romance novels some of us\nlike to read horror novels we all have\ndifferent preferences up here we also\nhave different aptitudes so some of us\nare very artistically gifted some of us\nare very like mathematically gifted so\nthere are a lot of different brains out\nthere and so the biggest mistake that we\nmake in teaching meditation is that we\ntry to use one technique for all of the\ndifferent brains so I'll give youall an\nexample of kind of why this happens so\nlet's say that someone wants to meditate\nthey join a meditation class usually\ntaught by someone like let's say a\nBuddhist monk who went and studied a\nparticular technique from a particular\nmaster so in the meditation class there\nare about 10 students and five of the\nstudents let's be honest don't really\nstick around right they show up at the\nclass they kind of give it a shot they\ndon't really stick with the practice\nit's not really for them a couple of the\nstudents continue to stick around and\none person really falls in love with it\nman this technique really works great\nfor them so they stay with the teacher\nthey get Advanced levels of\ncertification and they spend years\nstudying this stuff and eventually they\nbecome a teacher as well now when this\nteacher has students that come into\ntheir class what do they know right so\nthey know the specific technique that\ntended to work really really well for\nthem the vast majority of our meditation\nteachers have studied primarily one\ntradition and that didn't work for me so\nat this point I've studied meditation in\nfive different countries from over 40\ndifferent teachers and I spent about\nseven years studying to become a monk\nand basically I went to different places\nbecause I never found my Guru and as a\nresult I learned lots of different kinds\nof meditations the next thing that kind\nof happened that was really formative\nfor me is I became a psychiatrist and\nthen I started working with a lot of\ndifferent patients and what I discovered\nis that many of these meditation\ntechniques can be specifically applied\nto particular people so we know that in\nthe meditative tradition we have a ton\nof teachers there's one text called\nvigan Tantra which includes 112\ntechniques on meditation this text is\nfrom the tantric Hindu tradition but\nthen we also have Buddhist traditions of\nMahayana vajana all of these different\nkinds of mindfulness based techniques\nZen based techniques and there are all\nof these different spiritual Traditions\nout there and what makes it hard to\nmeditate is that usually when we go to a\nteacher they don't say they don't make\nreferrals like we do in the medical\nworld right they don't say oh based on\nyour cognitive fingerprint based on your\ngoals of meditation based on the way\nthat your mind works I think thic\nmeditation is not the right move for you\nand instead you should go to Zen\nmeditation I've never heard a meditation\nteacher say that like in my whole\nhistory of studying meditation for about\n20 years I've never heard a meditation\nteacher make a referral to a different\ntradition the answer is always if if you\nkeep practicing you'll figure it out\nkeep practicing keep practicing keep\npracticing and it'll work for you that's\nnot how we work in the clinical field\nand that has really informed the way\nthat I teach meditation when a patient\ncomes to me and they've like got a\ngunshot wound I'm a psychiatrist and I\nsay hey maybe you should go see a trauma\nsurgeon because based on your specific\nneeds this is the kind of meditation\nthat will work for you and so my\napproach to meditation is to take a\ncollection of these different techniques\nand pick the one that fits your\ncognitive fingerprint pick the one that\nfits your particular goals and what we\ntend to see when we do that and i' I\neven started some clinical research that\nthen I abandoned about making meditation\nregimens for particular diagnoses which\nwe'll go into but basically if you sort\nof pick the right technique for you\nmeditation will be easy and you will see\na way larger benefit and the benefit can\nbe very drastic from what most\nmeditation teachers even realize we all\nwatch videos on the internet because we\nwant to change change the problem is\nthat even though we keep watching them\nwe don't necessarily change I want to\ntalk to you all about our coaching\nprogram and if you're not interested\njust jump forward 20 seconds and get\nstraight to the video but if you're\nsomeone who is ready to actually make\nchange if you want to see outcomes in 6\n8 12 weeks if you guys are struggling\nwith problems like career stuff burnout\nstuff social skills low self-esteem if\nyou're trying to struggle to motivate\nyourself to actually act that's what we\nbuilt a coaching program for check out\nthe link in the description below to see\nhow coaching can help you and now on to\nthe video so let's say that\nthis is all of the meditation techniques\nand we have a lot of different\nTraditions we've got the thri tradition\nover here we've got the Zen tradition\nover here we've got all these different\nTraditions right we also have like the\nmore devotional things like prayer is\nover here which is like a form of\nmeditation you can argue that and then\nthere's lots of different you know\nthings over here so we've got Hindu\nTantra we've got Buddhist Tantra so this\nis like vajana is Buddhist Tantra and\nthen we have even things like modern\nTantra so you have modern tantric gurus\nwho will sort of teach their own version\nof of Tantra so you have the point is\nthat there's a lot of different kinds of\ntechniques and so let's just go through\na couple and understand like how these\ntechniques are very specific to a to how\nthese techniques can specifically help a\ncertain kind of mind and for a certain\nproblem okay so let's start with like a\nvery simple technique from the yogic\ntradition so there's one technique\ncalled branium and specifically some\nkinds of branium so let's call it nari\nand kapal I mean when I say let's call\nit these are what these two techniques\nare so these are breathing techniques\nthis one is alternate nostril breathing\nand this one is a rapid forceful\nexhalation so you basically exhale very\nrapidly and as you exhale very rapidly\nyour CO2 levels actually drop and then\nwhat this ends up doing is this reduces\nyour respiratory rate so basically we're\ngoing to forcibly\nhyperventilate and if you do that for a\nfew seconds you'll start to feel\nlightheaded and then you stop and what\nyou'll notice is that your breathing is\nvery very calm at the end of the\npractice so physiologically what's going\non when we do a practice like kapal Pati\nis we are decreasing the activity of our\nsympathetic nervous system so this is\nwhere our adrenaline system our cortisol\nsystem our stress system so what we find\nis that these techniques will actually\nactivate this thing called the vagus\nnerve and the vagus nerve will slow our\nheart rate down will chill us out will\nsuppress cortisol and adrenaline\nproduction so it physiologically\nde-stresses us and what I find is that\nthese techniques are very very useful\nfor people who have very active Minds\nand things like anxiety or\npanic because remember that anxiety and\npanic are not just in the mind there's a\nwhole physiology that goes with it so if\nyou're someone who wants to use\nmeditation specifically to calm your\nmind and you want to physiologically\ninduce a state of chill in your brain\nand you Trend towards the more anxious\nmore Panic oriented kind of mind if you\ndeal with stress not by getting isolated\nand withdrawn but by panicking and your\nmind kind of fly flies in a thousand\ndifferent dire I need to do this I need\ndo this you just need to chill the\nout if you need to chill the out\nthis is the right technique for you now\nhere's the problem if you go to a zen\nteacher who just simply tells you to\nobserve your thoughts right just observe\nyour thoughts and you're someone who's\nprone to Panic it's like oh my God I'm\ngoing to die everybody's going to die\nyou can't just observe them because the\nthe moment that you let them run free\nit's like oh my God I'm going to die and\nthen everyone's going to die and then\neveryone's going to die then every you\nlet it run free and it's like a bull\nrunning around like hopped up on cocaine\nin your house destroying everything that\ndoesn't work right and if you go to a\nzen teacher they're like just keep\n doing it bro just keep\ndoing it and all the while you're like\ninducing a panic attack so no no no no\nwe don't want to do Zen meditation in\nthis kind of situation I'm not saying\nthat it can't help and there are studies\nthat show that Zen or mindfulness\ntechniques are actually effective in\nanxiety disorders but in my experience\nmy personal take right and that's what\nthis is this is my personal take this is\nnot nearly as effective as using\nmeditation techniques that\nphysiologically activate the\nparasympathetic nervous system and calm\nyou the down that's just one\nexample so let's take another example so\nsometimes we also have people who are\nlet's say depressed so in this case so\nthese are people who why do you want to\nmeditate well my main problem is that\nlike I'm sluggish I'm slow I have no\nmotivation it's hard to get out of bed\nevery morning I don't care about\nanything I just feel lethargic and\nsluggish maybe I have a clinical\ndiagnosis maybe I don't so that's where\nwe're going to take something from the\nBuddhist tradition I don't know where\nthis is I'm going to put Himalayan up\nhere okay so there's another super cool\ntechnique called\nTumo so Tumo is the name of a tantric\ngoddess of fire and passion so there's a\nspecific group of Buddhist monks that\nlive in Nepal that worship this goddess\nof fire she's like the goddess of fire\nand the cool thing is their techniques\nare completely different from kapti and\nand Nishi these techniques are designed\nto\nenergize okay so these techniques are\ndesigned to cultivate your inner passion\nin Fire and the physiology of this is\n fascinating so there have been\nstudies done there's one study from 1982\nokay and this study found that monks who\nare practitioners of this can increase\nthe temperature of their digits okay\nthis is fingers and toes by\n8° think about 8° C right for those of\ny'all that\nare uh what is that in I don't know how\nmuch in 8 degree I guess it's like 15°\nFahrenheit is close to what it is in\nterms of like a change what this kind of\nmeans is like like think about that this\nis an actual technique that people do in\nthe Himalayas and it energizes them it\nallows them to stay in the Himalayas\nwithout like sweaters and other kinds of\nthing I I imagine it must increase our\nBrown fat production and some of these\nother things we don't quite know what\nthe physiologic method is but people\nhave literally done measurements that\nthis kind of uh uh meditation technique\nwill literally energize you and it\ndoesn't it's not just a technique to\nincrease the temperature of your\nperipheral digits it also has a similar\ncognitive effect a very similar\nenergizing effect I teach a variant of\nTumo when I was working in Maine in the\nUnited States I was working at a drug\nrehab in Maine so it's cold outside and\nwhat I would do is take a group of\npatients we would go outside with like\nvery like light sweater and then I'd\ntell them we're going to take off our\nsweaters we're just going to wear our\nshirts and it's like 40 degrees outside\nand I'm going to we're going to do this\nmeditation technique together and we're\ngoing to be outside in 40° weather okay\nyou can wear a jacket if you want to but\nyou won't need one by the end of the\npractice and it's beautiful it's\nincredibly energizing so it's a\ncompletely different tradition\ncompletely different technique\ncompletely different effect and so think\nabout this as well so if your mind is\noverly anxious and a meditation\ntechnique calms you down that's great\nbut if your mind is sluggish and slow\nand you have no energy you don't need a\ntechnique that's going to calm you down\nyou need a technique that will do the\nopposite and on the flip side if we have\nanxiety and we want to slow down our\nmind and we do a technique that\nincreases our passion increases the\nenergy within the mind it may have the\nopposite effect but it doesn't end with\njust these two okay so the next thing\nthat we're going to talk about is let's\nsay we're over here we've got shuna\nmeditation\nso if you look at studies on meditation\none of the things that we know is that\nstudies on meditation show that it will\ndissolve the\nego okay and we also know from studies\non psychedelics that if you have a ego\ndissolution experience during something\nlike MDMA or psilocybin that correlates\nwith healing trauma so if you just have\nif you take a psychedelic and you just\nlike see cool colors and stuff we don't\nsee a whole lot of clinical improvement\nwith that what seems to correlate the\nmost with clinical Improvement in in\npsychedelics is actually dissolving the\nego okay and this is the other cool\nthing is that if we look at for example\nyou know the mechanism of action of\nketamine which is the fastest pH\npharmaceutical treatment we can give for\nsomeone who has major depressive\ndisorder it works incredibly fast\nketamine is literally a dissocia of\nagent so ketamine was not developed as a\npsychiatric treatment camine was\ndeveloped as anesthesia so when we're\nlike cutting into to someone on the\noperating table we're going to infuse\nthem with ketamine so that they\ndissociate and they don't feel the pain\nso the interesting thing that we know\nabout ketamine is that this too causes a\ndissociation a separation from the ego\nwhich can be really healing if you have\ndepression why is that because in\ndepression we're beating ourselves up\nall the time right I'm a piece of I\nsuck all these people would be better\nwithout me everyone is better than me I\nhave low self-esteem so if you kind of\nthink about it you're so caught up in\nyour own head about who you are and so\nwe want to unplug that so ketamine does\nit hopefully psychedelics do it I don't\nrecommend y'all using either of those\nunless it's the guidance of a licensed\nprofessional the cool thing is that\nthere are safe forms of meditation like\nshuna practice so shuna practice is\nshuna is the Sanskrit word for void null\nor zero and if you kind of like look at\nour sense of identity there's a set of\npractices that help you connect with the\nvoid within you and whatever kinds of\nego oriented crap you have you can kind\nof dump into the void void within you\nand it'll kind of disappear and then\nyou'll be kind of neutral and you'll be\nchill and you'll be kind of like egoless\nright you'll start to it's super cool\nlike I love Sho your practices it's a\nbig part of my personal practice it's\nwhat helps me keep my head on straight\nbecause even as I become successful I\nremember I'm just the same piece of\nthat I used to be and then on the flip\nside I also remember that even when I\nwas this piece of I'm the person\nthat I am now so I'm neither good nor\nbad I'm just me I'm doing the best that\nI can other people can judge me if they\nwant to but I'm not going to judge\nmyself I'm going to just try to be the\nbest human that I can be right so notice\nthat when I say I'm going to try to be\nthe best human that I can be I'm not\nsaying I'm a good human or bad human\nbecause the moment that I say I'm a good\nperson I open myself up to Ego\ndisappointment because if I become a\ngood person that means one day I may be\na bad person right because be being a\ngood person means I got to check all\nthese boxes and even if I think I'm a\nbad person that's going to cause all\nkinds of problems because if I try to go\ndo something and I believe I am a bad\nperson right so we see this a lot with\nlike for example people who struggle\nwith dating and they think to themselves\nI'm ugly no one would ever want to date\nme and then they go on a date and then\nthat kind of mental energy sabotages the\ndate and creates the same creates a\nself-fulfilling prophecy so what we\nreally want to do is some of us need to\ndissolve our ego so that we can just be\nlike neutral versions of ourselves who\nare not beating ourselves up who are not\nnarcissistic so I'll use this technique\nin my patients who have narcissistic\npersonality disorder and it works\nincredibly well right because the whole\npoint with NPD is that people are aging\nnarcissists and they have no empathy and\nthey have all these like high ideas of\nourselves just dissolve it all and it'll\nhelp a lot key point is that this kind\nof technique is not very physiologically\nactive that's not where it works it\ndoesn't increase our core temperature by\n3 or 4 degrees C doesn't increase the\ntemperature of our toes by 8° cus does\nnot recruit the vagus nerve does not\nchill us out what it is is a more mental\ntechnique it is a technique that affects\nthings like our ego and the last\ntechnique that I'm going to talk to you\nall about and you'll notice that I'm\nkind of pulling things from the yogic\ntradition because that's what I've\nstudied the most is Yoga Nidra so Yoga\nNidra is a a very interesting relaxation\npractice so it has benefits for things\nlike anxiety and stuff but the real\npoint of Yoga Nidra is that it induces\nour mind into a autosuggestive or\nhypnotic state so it's a very specific\npractice where we put our mind in such a\nscenario where whatever we implant in\nthere will kind of Bubble Up Now I know\nthis sounds kind of weird but I I I want\nyouall to understand this so if you're\nwalking around okay D D D D random\nthoughts will Bubble Up from the bottom\nof your mind and if you think about it\nlike what kinds of thoughts are these\nthey can be like I'm a loser I'm\ngreat oh NOS or I really want to game\nright now so if you kind of think about\nit I'm not saying that these thoughts\nare good or bad or whatever but if you\nlook at the mechanism of Mind something\nwithin your mind populates your mind\nwith all kinds of thoughts and if we\nlook at a lot of psychiatric medications\nwhat we literally try to do is dull\nthese out right so what we do if\nsomeone has an o OCD or an anxiety\ndisorder is we'll give them an SSRI a\nselective serotonin serotonergic\nreuptake inhibitor and what we know that\nssris do or benzo aines and anxiety\ndisorders is they literally slow the\nactivity of our mind they kind of\nemotionally numb us out so that we\nproduce fewer toxic thoughts but the key\nfact remains that this these thoughts\nare still coming from somewhere so when\nwe do something like Psychotherapy we're\ngoing in there and we are\nannihilating these the source of these\nnegative thoughts through something like\nPsychotherapy so this is what's super\ncool Psychotherapy is a discipline where\nwe go down there and we clean out the\nbad stuff but what Yoga Nidra is let's\nsay there's something bad down here\nsomething bad down here okay and in\nPsychotherapy we're trying to heal it\nwhat Yoga Nidra is is the ability to\nimplant stuff down here whatever you\nwant and so that so when I work with PE\npeople and I we do Yoga Nidra there's\nthis part of the end of the practice\ncalled sankalpa or resolve so you\nimplant a resolve into your subconscious\nmind and when you implant a resolve into\nyour subconscious mind cool stuff will\nhappen when you start to face adversity\nright so like for example I worked with\npatient who's was like you know as long\nas I give up I can do I mean as long as\nI don't give up I can do this as long as\nI don't give up I can do this as long as\nI don't give up I can do this and what\nused to happen is anytime they would get\nsome setback they would like throw in\nthe towel right they'd like be like oh\nman like this isn't going to work this\nperson is going to break up with me\nanyway anyway I might as well break up\nwith them I'm not going to get this\npromotion my boss doesn't like me so\nthey' like they' sabotage their life in\nso many ways and this is what super cool\nas we did this practice over the course\nof weeks and months this thought started\nimplanting itself into their their brain\nand you can't just do like Auto\nsuggestion you can't just repeat it to\nyourself there's a lot of like details\nabout what sinks into the mind right you\ncan't just tell yourself I'm a good\nperson and it'll sink in stuff that\nsinks into your mind your mind needs to\nbe in the right kind of state this is\nwhy traumas can be so devastating it's\nbecause that negative experience shapes\nyour mind in a certain way and it sinks\nreally deep inside and then if get\ntraumatized or abused then that low\nself-esteem lives down there for a very\nlong time so in Psychotherapy we're\nreally good at getting rid of the\nnegative but we're not very good at\nimplanting the positive and that's where\nsunala comes in so as this person starts\nto do the Sun gulpa and then when they\nget setbacks this m this thought bubbles\nup to the surface as long as I don't\ngive up I can do this and they're like\nokay fine I'm not going to give up\nbecause I can do this it changes the way\nthat they think and it changes the way\nthat they live their life so this is\njust four examples of different kinds of\nmeditation techniques that I use this is\nkind of my Approach is to remember that\nfirst of all not every person is the\nsame different people have different\npreferences right so different color\npreferences different Cuisine\npreferences all of us have unique brains\nthat have unique cognitive fingerprints\nand the purpose of meditation is the\npoint of meditation is to help our mind\nmove in the direction that we want to\nand ideally even transcend mind\nconversation for a different day so if\nyou're struggling with meditation it's\nnot because you suck at it or it's it's\nnot for you I don't believe that\ngenerally speaking I would say that 80\nto 90 to 95% of people that I work with\nI can teach them a meditation practice\nthat works for them and I would say\nfully half of these people or more were\nnot super into it they're like yeah I\ngave it a shot right and so this is\nwhere we teach I think it's all about\nteaching the right kind of meditation so\nthis is kind of like saying like you\nknow I don't like to exercise well like\nyou may not like playing basketball but\nhave you ever gone rock climbing or\npeople who are going hiking they're like\noh I think hiking is incredibly boring\nhave you ever tried like competitive\nracket ball you know like there's all\nkinds of different things that qualify\nas exercise we just have to find the\nright thing for you so our approach to\nmeditation here at healthy gamer is to\ntry to understand who you are understand\nwhat your goals are and then try to find\na specific practice that works for you\nso you'll find this all throughout our\nYouTube channel generally speaking we\ndon't teach meditation quite as much on\nlive streams anymore because we've\ntaught a lot of it but we also have a\nlot of resources like Dr K's guide to\nmeditation where we go through the\nbasics but basically in every single\nguide that we have guide of depression\nguide of anxiety guide on ADHD soon to\nbe guide on trauma we go through\nparticular practices that are designed\nto do everything from calm down your\nnervous system to dissolve your ego so I\nhope that's been helpful to you you\ndon't have to learn meditation from us\nby the way just please don't give up on\nit and try to find the right teacher for\nyou e"
