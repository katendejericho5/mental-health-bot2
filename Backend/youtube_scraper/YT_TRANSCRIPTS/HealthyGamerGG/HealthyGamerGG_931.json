    "transcript": "what they like is the perfect version of\nyou\nright they don't like the real you and\nso then you can't share your real\nproblems with them hello uh uh yeah\nprompt was uh\nuh well i kind of wanted it badly\nbecause i was like in a hurry while i\nwas writing it yeah i want to approve\ni want to improve my ability to trust\nand let others that are close to me help\nme instead of like relying on\npeople that i barely know sometimes\nbecause i\ni stop myself from like asking my\nfriends\nlike i i see myself sometimes\nasking people that i'm not close to that\nmuch\npersonal stuff\nand talking about person stuff because i\nfeel like\ni have no fear of the outcome that might\ncome of this\nbecause\nif i do these people that i'm not\nfamiliar with then it might end up\nlike okay\nif they don't like it for example i i'm\nnot i don't know these people that much\ni'm not that close to them i'm not i\ndon't really care about what they feel\nhuh\nbut\nrecently in i'd say\n2020\nis\nwhen i first i would say like got i'm 21\nby the way uh\nas uh when uh i first\ngot friends that\nfeel like a genuine friends\ngood for you uh\nyeah uh\nand because like all of my time in\nschool uh most of my friends felt like\nyou know just\ntalk about whatever you're interested in\nand that's it you know video games shows\nand all of that but recently i've met\nthese friends\nand i was kind of at first shocked\nbecause i'm not used to these kind of\nyou know friendships that\ni actually have people that care about\neach other and\nwill\ntalk about each other and i guess that\npart of me kind of felt weird and at\nfirst maybe a bit distant\nuh\nbecause i went to an old boys school so\nif you if i did end up talking about\nmyself then i most likely would have\ngotten like\nmade fun of a lot\nsure yeah\noh it would have made it a bit harder\nfor me to like open up so the idea of it\nwas like not that there that much but\nfor me\ni kind of feel like if i do open up to\nmy friends\nconsidering i do like listening like i\ndon't like when they show trust in me to\ntell me about their problems their\npersonal issues\nuh\nand i i'm and i'm like always you know\nwilling to help or listen to them\nwhenever they need to but for some\nreason i can't trust myself to\nto talk to them about my one my own\nproblems\nokay\nso let me just make sure i understand\nyou muhammad\num yes so it sounds like you went to an\nall-boys school\nsharing emotional or personal things in\nthat environment is a a very fast way to\nget bullied and made fun of yeah and\npunished\nso it sounds like early on you kind of\nlearned how to become a private person\nfair so far\nyes\nand um you've recently made a group of\nfriends so you had friends at that\nschool and stuff like that but the\nfriendships you've had felt shallow so\nyou'll talk about tv shows you'll talk\nabout games things like that but you\nwouldn't have like serious talk\nyeah and recently you've made like yeah\ngo ahead\nit's just like if it's serious talk it's\nlike maybe serious general talk but\nnothing\ntoo personal got it\nand so recently you've made a group of\nfriends who you feel like are deeper\nfriendships\nyou care about these people a lot\num they also sometimes open up to you\nand you're totally fine with that and\nyou treat them well and it seems like\nthat's healthy\nyeah\nyeah\nand what you said what you find that\nyou're struggling with is opening up to\nthem\nand you can open it up to strangers on\nthe internet\nyeah basically right and and so let's\njust try to understand that a little bit\nwhat do you think it is that makes it\neasy for you to open up to strangers on\nthe internet\nwell with strangers i'm not going to be\ninteracting with them on a regular basis\nso\nthat interaction was mostly going to be\nthat one of the only interactions i'm\ngonna be having with them\nor sometimes not even strangers like\none like sometimes one time they\nintroduced me to a friend of theirs\nand uh\nyeah he seemed like a cool guy and one\ntime we ended up in a call on discord\nlike just me and him and we ended up\ntalking about a lot of personal stuff\nbetween each other just all of a sudden\nwe started opening up opening up to each\nother even though we this is like our\nthird time meeting each other\nand then maybe i talked to him a couple\nof times after that then i haven't\nreally talked to him then again much\nagain\nso how do you feel about\nnot talking to him again\nnot like i don't see it as a big deal\nbecause i didn't really\nlike connect with them as much yeah so\nso i know it sounds kind of weird but\nlike\nit sounds to me like you're\nsome of these other relationships that\nyou have feel very safe\nyeah\nand how would you how what is the if i\nwere to tell you okay so muhammad\nfor your close friends tell them\nsomething very personal today if i were\nto ask you to do that how would you\nreact to that what would you feel if i\nsaid okay why don't you just talk to\nsomeone today\ncan i just clarify something\ni can't talk to them like today i've\neven had a chat with a friend about\nthat that i am going through this a lot\nof issues especially when it comes to\ntrust\ni am willing to talk that i do have\nissues and problems\nbut i'm not willing to delve deep into\nthem yeah so so\nif you think about delving deep into\nthem\nthen\nwhat what does your mind do like how\ndoes it react\nat the thought of sharing something deep\nwith some with one of your friends\nwell it's a it's weird because i kind of\ncorrect because i i kind of have a lot\nof free time uh i'm a college student so\ni either study or have nothing else to\ndo basically\nuh\nand i always end up like pacing around\nmy room thinking back on what i'm doing\nwhy am i doing certain things why am i\nacting certain way so i do a lot of like\nself-reflection on myself okay\nand one of the things i've realized is\nthat in this case i'm a hypocrite\nbecause\ni allow them to talk to me because i\ndon't see any problem with it but i feel\nlike if i go to them with my problems\ni'm burdening them with problems that\nthey don't need to deal with\nokay so i'm hearing that you feel some\namount of guilt by burdening them\nbecause you care about these people\nwhat else do you notice in there\nit's a combination of guilt and also\njust\nmy mind kind of i think it is just like\nmaybe an excuse my mind is kind of\ntelling me which is that uh\nif i do tell them they might not be able\nto help me with it\nso i might end up making them feel like\nmaybe if they can't help me with it\nand all they can do is just listen\nokay\nso it sounds like you're afraid that\ntelling them is going to make them feel\nbad\nif they can't help you yes\nare you afraid of what they will think\nabout you if you tell them this stuff\nwell\ni used to be but i have opened up to\nsome of them a couple of times\ni have opened up a couple of times but\nusually even though they reassured me\nand they have made like they kind of\nproven me wrong in the sense of no they\nare understanding people they will\nunderstand what i have to say and they\nwill understand even if i have a very\noutrageous feeling they will understand\nthat you know it's a feeling that i'm\nhaving\nhuh uh\nmy mind always\nthe moment i end this conversation goes\nback into i shouldn't have done that\ni've made a mistake i shouldn't have\ndone it okay and what is the mistake\nthat you made\nwhy does your mind think that you made a\nmistake\nit's weird because i can't really\npinpoint it it's like the points i said\nbefore like uh you know i don't like i i\njust put this problem now on their head\nno they don't know i might like i don't\nknow it might stay under\nconscious for a while and\nmaybe ruin their day possibly okay so\nthat sounds like those thoughts are\ncoming from a feeling of guilt\nokay i guess so so muhammad i'm gonna um\nshare a couple thoughts with you is that\nokay\nyes so first thing is that i want to\nshare with you that i'm actually\noptimistic for you\nso i think the key thing is not whether\nyou have trust issues or not\nbut how you approach having trust issues\nand so what i'm hearing from you is that\nyou're a thoughtful dude\num you know you spend a lot of time kind\nof thinking about this stuff\nyou also are very observant right so you\nrecognize okay i can talk about this\nwith some people i can't talk about this\nwith other people you're kind of aware\nof what you're thinking and ultimately\nlike that's what leads to good\noutcomes\nis sort of focusing on a problem being\naware of a problem the people who really\nstruggle with trust issues are the ones\nwho don't realize they have trust issues\nand don't try to fix them does that make\nsense\nyeah\nso i'm going to try to teach you\na particular technique\nokay and then we'll talk about a couple\nof more general things\nso\nactually let's start with the general\nstuff so the first thing to understand\nis that actually you're not alone with\ndiscussing\nintimate things with strangers on the\ninternet or even like friends in real\nlife that you don't know well so we know\nfrom basically like a lot of\npsychological research that the closer\nwe are with someone\nthe more\ntheir opinion of us matters\nright i want my friends to like me\ni want my friends to respect me\ni want my friends to think i care about\nthem\nand so interestingly enough what we tend\nto find is that when there's a stranger\nsometimes you can have the deepest\nconversations because it's safer\nbecause after this conversation is over\ni never have to see this person again so\ni don't have to damage the i don't have\nto risk damaging the relationship by\nsharing something deeply personal with\nsomeone\ndoes that make sense\nso you're you're not alone in this this\nis also part of the reason actually that\nwe we even have things like group\ncoaching because what we've sort of\nfound is that creating a space where no\none knows each other that you can work\non your problems\nactually gives you the most authentic\nand safe space to work on them because\nthe problem is with something like a\nfriendship or if you're talking to your\nboss you're talking to your brother and\nyou're trying to get support from them\nall of those kinds of things any\nconversation you have with that person\nis going to affect your relationship\nwith that person\ndoes that make\nsense and so what we actually try to do\nis create a relationship that's\nartificial and this is where sometimes\npeople in group coaching get upset\nbecause we have certain rules in\ncoaching which is that you're not\nallowed to do anything outside of\ncoaching so no playing games together\nno like hanging out on individual calls\nand sometimes i mean we can't control\npeople's behavior but people seem really\nperplexed by that and they're like wait\nwhy can't like i know these people we\nall get along so well like why can't we\nplay games together if we both like\ngames and that's because we want to\npreserve this kind of like safe\nrelationship and the second that you\nbecome friends with someone in group\ncoaching and then you start doing other\nstuff then then it turns into like your\nsituation which is that now i care about\nwhat this person thinks\nthere's all kinds of other problems like\nif we play together and i feed and next\nweek we're like you know meeting\nand then like there's resentment left\nover from the game because i was feeding\nand throwing and all that kind of stuff\nit messes up the work that we're trying\nto do so that's a different issue but so\nthe first thing that i kind of want to\npoint out to you is that it's very\nnormal to like feel more comfortable\nwith people that you don't have good\nrelationships with\nokay yeah\nso the next thing is that what i'm gonna\nrecommend that you do with your friends\nis do a technique that we teach people\nin in group coaching called going meta\nokay\nso so there's this very interesting\nprinciple\nwhich is that if something is\nemotionally\ncharged there's a lot of emotion\nand i try to talk about something the\nemotion can make it hard to talk about\nbut what i can do is go meta go one\nlevel above it\nand talk about why it's hard to talk\nabout\nso for example\nif i'm working with a patient for who\nhas trauma and the trauma is too\ndifficult to talk about i don't want to\ntalk about the trauma i don't want to\nforce them to talk about the trauma but\nwhat i can do is i can ask them what\nmakes it hard for you to talk about\ntrauma\ndoes that make sense\ni'm not asking them to talk about the\ntrauma i'm saying what makes it hard for\nyou to talk about the trauma\nand so the interesting thing is that if\nthe trauma and emotion is down here and\nthen we move up one layer and we're\nsaying okay what about this trauma is\ndifficult for us to talk about\nthen that's actually easier to talk\nabout\nand so interestingly enough what i would\nrecommend that you do with your friends\nis instead of telling them personal\nthings if that doesn't feel comfortable\nto you have a conversation with them\nabout having personal conversations\nso you could go to your friends yeah\ndoes that make sense\nyeah yeah\nso because i i almost do this what to\nwhat you were saying i kind of do it to\nan extent\nwhere i would talk to them about you\nknow i have this problem i don't really\nlike going to the details of it and i\nwould explain that you know\ni don't like going to the these details\nbecause they leave me\ninto feeling a certain way so i don't\nreally go further than that like when i\ntalk to them yeah so you're so so that's\nwhere i i would\nperfect right so that's a good example\nof going meta so i would encourage you\nto do it in a slightly different way or\nlike move one step further and just have\na conversation about having\nconversations\nand sort of say ask your friends hey\nlike you know a couple weeks ago when\nyou mentioned this to me\nhow did you feel sharing that personal\nthing with me\nbecause i felt like trusted by you\ni hope i was able to help you\none thing that i sometimes struggle with\nis that i'm sometimes afraid\nso instead of telling them your problem\nand burdening them and making them feel\nguilty what you can do is tell them\nabout your fear of burdening them\nright so instead of talking about the\nissue you can say sometimes i hesitate\nto share things with you because i'm\nafraid\nthat if i tell you and you can't help me\nlike you'll feel like inadequate\nwhat do you think about that\nright then i would ask them that that\ni'm not asking you that's part of the\nconversation\nso sometimes i hesitate to tell you\nthings because i'm afraid that telling\nyou will make you feel guilty if you\ncan't help me\nwhat do you think about that\ndoes that make sense uh well it makes\nsense but i think my problem is that\nuh like for example i realized this\nmostly in school for example is that in\none year i would act a certain way and\nyou know the more time goes on the more\nyou develop and your personality changes\nuh\nso i would not change show that change\nin personality until the next year where\ni had this break where nobody sees me\nwhat and i\nso like for example the school breaks\nit's i will only showcase my changes\nafter school breaks because for some\nreason i don't like the reaction of\npeople realizing that i'm changing\nit's like it's kind of hard to explain\nwhere it's like\ni don't like\nlike ever since i joined this group i've\nacted a certain way\nand now i'm changing but i'm for some a\npart of me does not want to show this\nchange in me okay like for example\num so all of my like yes\nyeah all of my friends um\nlike i like i used to be kind of known\nfor a person who doesn't really\ncompliment much for example\nbut recently i got i kind of got used to\nbeing you know more friendly and\ncomplimenting my friends\nbut the thing is with this group is for\nthe first time i i never really had many\nfemale friends but this group has\nfemales in it\nand\ni feel like if i compliment them then\nthen i'll be like you know almost making\na move on them even though that's not my\nintention\nand so i so then my mind can go like oh\ni shouldn't be nice to them as much as\nlike for example the guy i shouldn't be\nas like complimenting them as much\ni don't know if that makes any sense\nso\nyeah it makes a lot of sense so let me\nask you something what does it\nwhat's what bothers you about your\nfriends seeing you change\nthat's mostly for my past\ni i always hated the reaction of\npeople realizing that i changed like oh\nyou're this now uh\nand it's mostly like with family for\nexample like you know i have five older\nsiblings and they're all used to me you\nknow being their youngest brother\nand\nevery time i would change in a certain\nway they would point it out they know\nnot necessarily in a bad way they're\njust oh like oh now you do this\nand for some reason i i don't know why\nbut a part of me just didn't like\nthem pointing it out\nhuh so i i think muhammad you're gonna\nhave to do a little bit more work there\nin terms of digging into what bothers\nyou about people seeing you change\ndo you have a sense of like what bothers\nyou about it\ni i guess\ni guess that's reaction usually ends up\nbringing attention towards me\nand\ni don't want to have attention towards\nme like that\nwhy not what's wrong with having\nattention towards you\ni guess i just kind of\nlike it's weird i in some cases i i feel\nlike i thrive under attention when it\ncomes to me showing off\nlike maybe in a game i would play better\nif people are watching me for example\nuh but\nwhen it comes to social attention for\nsome reason i just\nnot i'm not very not much of a social\nperson\ni grew up as the youngest of five\nand\ni kind of always just not like my\nparents kind of never really\npushed me a lot like i kind of always\nsay this to my friends whereas i feel\nlike\nmy parents weren't prepared to raise a\nkid of my generation\nthat unfortunately is\ntoo likely to be true\nbecause all of my siblings are aren't\nlike you know two years older\nthe the other youngest sibling i have is\nsix years older than me\nand to scale it up i have another one\nwho's 11 years and then another who's 12\nyears older and the oldest was 15 years\nolder than me\nso there's a huge gap between me and all\nof them\nso\ni guess a part of me just felt like a\nkid all the time i'm not like realizing\ni'm actually growing up now\nand how does it feel to be growing up in\nthem commenting on it\nuh\nin some cases i enjoy it and like i'm\nenjoying the fact that they're\nrecognizing that you know i'm no longer\nthe younger brother\nthey you know the kid\nand in some cases where it's like\ni guess a part of it also comes from\nembarrassment i don't know\nthat like\nreaction kind of gets me embarrassed\nbecause it's like\na comp almost like a compliment it can\nbe you know\nthat oh they realize that you grew up\nand i don't know i don't react well with\ncompliments\nokay\nso i think there's a lot here muhammad\nbut let's try to\ncan i offer some thoughts\nyes\nokay let me actually can i think for a\nsecond let me start there\nyeah it's okay\nso\nuh but i wonder i'm going to ask you a\nquestion real quick\ndo you think that maybe the reason that\nyou don't\nwant people to see you changing is\nbecause\nyou feel comfortable\nbeing a finished product when you put\nyourself on display\nyes i would actually say that because i\nrecently even talked\nto my friend about this\nwhere uh\nlike for some reason i started realizing\na lot of the things that make me feel\nuncomfortable\nis basically variables and things\nwhen things are not set\nokay\nso let's unpack this a little bit okay\nso i've got some thoughts for you so the\nfirst is that i i want to point out to\nyou that\nso you're okay being in the public light\nassuming\nyou put yourself there\nyeah right\nso you're okay with being on display\nbut the only muhammad that people get to\nsee is the one that you want to show\nthem\nyou don't want them to see anything that\nyou're not prepared to show them\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nnow this\nties into a couple of different things\nthe first is that like you're okay\nshowing some random person on the\ninternet the unpolished muhammad\nright like it's okay for them to see it\nbecause if you if if they don't like\nwhat they see or you feel embarrassed or\nyou you talk too much you can block them\nyou can never talk to them again\nand this also kind of makes sense\nbecause if you're like if you just want\nif you want to you if you want to take a\nsummer break or whatever and then you\ncome back and now you're complimenting\neveryone that's okay because you've had\nenough time to figure out how to put\nyourself on display how to complement\npeople properly and then like you know\nyou don't want people to\nhow can i say this it's like\nyou know there's like there's like\nuncooked there's the pie when it goes\ninto the oven\nand then there's the pie that comes out\nof the oven\nand the pie that comes out of the oven\nis like finished it's beautiful it's\nwarm it's golden brown on the top\nright yeah\nand so you're okay kind of putting\nyourself on display but you don't want\nto show anyone the unfinished product\nbecause i suspect like you're not happy\nwith the unfinished product\nyes definitely\nright\nso now you've got a really interesting\nproblem because\nthe interesting thing is how can you\nlearn to be happy with yourself\nif the only thing that you ever show\npeople is the perfect version of you\nbecause then actually what happens is\nwhat they like is the perfect version of\nyou\nright they don't like the real you and\nso then you can't share your real\nproblems with them\nyou can tell them hey i'm struggling a\nlittle bit\nand then you can absolutely show them\nafter you've worked through all your\nstruggles\nand you've figured everything out and\nyour mohammed so strong and mature and\nadult\nthen you can tell them all about the\nproblems right\nwhen they're fixed\nyeah\nso this is kind of tricky because\nif you really now that you have the\nopportunity for authentic friendships\nwhat you're sort of noticing is that you\nhave difficulty trusting people\nbut i think the reason you have\ndifficulty trusting people is because\nyou can't\nreally you don't want you don't feel\nvery comfortable showing parts of\nyourself that are not polished\nso i think the interesting thing we're\ngoing to kind of go back to going meta\nbut i think what you've really got to do\nis first of all acknowledge a lot of\nthese things\nright and this is also where like that's\nsomething\nuh\nother than i don't want to show them the\nunpolished look of myself\na part of me really dislikes it when\npeople uh\num\nlike\nfeel bad for me\nlike when people start feeling bad for\nme it's like\nalso i i it goes back to the guilt that\nyou mentioned\ni feel guilty that i made them feel bad\nfor me\nor like almost even petty to an extent\nmaybe like feel petty for me\nyeah what what what feels bad about that\ni don't know i feel like it's\ni mean feeling if they feel bad about me\nthat's not a good feeling and i made\nthem feel another like\ni ruined whatever happens maybe they had\nthat day okay so let me ask you\nsomething\nis feeling bad for you\nan appropriate price\nto pay for friendship with you\nwell that actually goes to another thing\nbecause\ni do remember watching\nnot exactly which video but one of your\nyour videos you mentioned you know that\nthere is a price for friendship\nand you know your friends need to be\nthere and maybe not all the time but at\nleast\nwhen you need them\nbut for me\ni guess because i'm used to my like my\nfamily is a loving family they always\nsupport me with most of my like things\nwhatever i want they always would\nsupport me and i've always seen this\nlove as you know the love of the family\nthat's unconditional i don't need any\nreason to love my family they're my\nfamily\nand they don't need a reason to love me\nand\nso for me it's kind of just traveled\ninto okay now we're talking about\nfriends i have no blood ties with them i\nhave no like life i've lived with them\nso there needs to be a reasoning for why\nwe are friends\nand i feel like i don't provide a good\nenough reasoning for me to be their\nfriends\nfor me it doesn't make sense why they're\nfriends with me and now we have the crux\nof the issue so where did you start\nbelieving that\nyou're not worth friendship with\nwell\nwith them i started meeting a lot a lot\nmore people more than what i'm usually\nused to\nand uh\ni no i mean i really like mama this\nsounds to me like you carried it with\nyou into these relationships\nwell yeah because like i said i didn't\nhave any you know\nrelationship in the past that felt like\nthis so i felt like when i came here i\nstarted recognizing all of my past\nproblems\nand now they're kind of all like\nflooding in where it's like i'm\nstruggling and managing which one should\ni deal with\nand i've realized a lot of the things\nfor example i dislike about people\nare traits that i myself have\nlike showcase oh 100 that's all the time\nwe hate in other people\nso the second most\nthe thing that we hate the second most\nin other people are the problems that we\nstruggle with\nthe thing that we hate the most about\nother people\nare the problems that we struggle with\nthat they've actually fixed\nright so we hate the most\nthe problems that we see in ourselves\nand then the only people we hate more\nthan that are the people that had our\nproblems and if i was a better person\ni could be that\nwhen we see a better version of\nourselves in someone else who struggled\nwith our problems but did better than we\ndid\nthat creates so much hatred yeah\nso\nbut muhammad so i think that this is\nstill gonna like i'm trying to leave you\nwith something a little bit practical\nhere but i think that a couple of things\nso first is that what i'm noticing is\nthat like\nso now i'm gonna go meta with you right\nso we we have a certain problem and then\nwe start talking about it and then as we\ncome to something like a solution\nyou add an additional problem\nand then we talk about that for a little\nwhile and then we add something else\nand we talk about that for a little\nwhile and then we add something else\nwhen i point this out to you\nhow does it make you feel\nuh i was actually scared of this exact\nproblem happening when i joined this\ncall because i have been wanting to\nwrite on the reddit at least or like\nmaybe on the server but every time i\nwrite i realized okay i've\ni'm linking a problem to another problem\nand then i link it to something else and\ni kept so it did so all i'm writing ends\nup looking like a jumbled mess of\nproblems where it's like it's hard to\nread so\nuh that that part of me was kind of\nscared of when i was joining this school\nbecause i know i'm gonna start diverging\ninto other problems and now that it's\nhappened how do you feel that your worst\nfears have come true\nit's not as bad as i thought but like i\nstill don't feel that the greatest you\nknow okay so uh i i don't know if you\ncan see my face on the discord call or\non the screen\nso you look at my face do i seem upset\nthat you've given me this whole host of\nproblems\nno i'm not upset at all\nyeah i think you're doing great\nis that confusing to you\nwell i guess in this case\nyou're kind of like a professional at\nthis\nalmost so i guess\ni'm expecting you not to feel bad i\nguess\nso so this is interesting right so now\nyou've got to be super careful\nbecause your worst fear happened\nand it's not as bad as you thought\nbut why isn't it as bad as you thought\nit's not because you're actually like\ncause you're afraid that oh my god it's\ngonna be a jumbled mess\nand if it's a jumbled mess then no one's\ngoing to make sense of it everyone's\ngoing to dislike it it's not going to\nhelp anyone it's going to be a complete\nmess\nand now when i say it doesn't bother me\nyou do something very very dangerous\nmohammed\nyou say oh it's because i'm a\nprofessional\nit's not because you're pr it's not that\nyour problem is actually okay do you see\nthat\nit you're sort of like\nsaying that the way you feel is because\ni'm a professional as opposed to it\nbeing okay that you did this\ndoes that make sense or no because if\nnot we got to stop and make sure like\nyou see because like you're actually\nlike this is a chance where\ni can look at your problems and i can\nsay muhammad it's okay to have these\nproblems you're a normal human being i\nactually think they make a lot of sense\ni don't think they're jumbled at all but\nif you push what i say away\nby calling me a professional then your\ncomplex will still continue\ndoes that make sense\nyeah it's actually just\nso this is really important this is\nexactly why you have self-esteem\nproblems\nbecause any time someone says hey\nmuhammad it's okay for you to have this\nproblem what does your mind do\ni guess reject it 100\nand what is the logic that your mind\nuses to reject me\nthat's uh you're a professional 100\noh it's dr k\nof course he's okay with me being a\njumbled mess but the rest of the world\nwon't be so i can't share this with\nother people\nand so now i think we're running into\nsomething that's very very important\nwhich is that anytime you actually start\nto connect with someone you push them\naway\nyeah\nanytime someone has a chance to help you\nand say actually mama you don't make me\nfeel guilty actually when you share your\nproblems with me it doesn't ruin my day\nwhat is your mind going to do when they\nsay that\ni create it's like some sort of excuse\nto reject that thought 100\nright you'll say oh they're just saying\nthat to make me feel better\nthey're not being honest with me\nyeah\nnow uh i guess\none more problem like i've kind of had\nis that\ni've been wanting to go to therapy\nrecently\nokay but the problem with the problem my\nproblem with therapy\nis that i'll be paying a lot of money\nto\npossibly find someone who's possibly\ngood for me that who can possibly help\nme\nand\nthat pro and and this kind of problem is\na bit more in my country because all the\npeople i know who have went to therapy\nin my country have gotten bad\nexperiences from it\nokay so\nthat's an important issue and i'm not\ngoing to engage with it\nokay okay so now i'm gonna restrain you\na little bit that's a whole other can of\nworms and i think what your mind is\ndoing so like why did you bring up\ntherapy and how oh my god their therapy\nisn't good in my in my country\nwhat happens if we start talking about\nthat\nwe'll ignore what we were talking about\nand go to another problem 100.\nand what were we talking about muhammad\num about how i\nkeep doing that exact thing where i\nreject the solutions i'm getting\nright\nso so that that even this is a form of\navoidance\nso i think all your problems are related\nlike i i don't think it's actually a\nthousand problems i think the problem is\nthat when your mind gets seen you're\nterrified of being seen\nand if i see you here right and i say oh\nlook mama this is what you're doing your\nmind is like oh\nthis is not what we wanted to put on\ndisplay\nit's not well formed we haven't we\nhaven't figured out the perfect way to\nconvey this\non the internet\nso let's talk about something else\ndodge deflect\nyeah\nand so you're you're doing fine dude\nthis is all like super healthy and super\ngood\ni i mean that does that make sense like\na part of it yeah a part of me was\nscared that what i'm doing was not\nhealthy in the sense of thinking\nself-reflecting as much as i did\nbecause i feel like i'm just put i'm\nacknowledging a lot of the problems i've\nhad\nwhere i felt like i maybe didn't know\nabout them and just\nwas ignoring them because i wasn't aware\nof their existence so so that too mom is\nthe same thing because look at all the\nwork that you're doing what does your\nmind do with that work when you\nintrospect and you discover something\nwhat does your mind say\nit it's confusing just goes to something\nelse right it says oh my god what if it\ndoesn't actually help at all it doubts\nyou there's constant doubt right this\nall comes back to like because like\nthat's the there's some part of you that\ndoes is not happy with who you are\nand you're terrified that unless you put\ntogether the perfect display\neveryone else will realize\nwhat you are\nnectar i don't know what you said about\nthe doubt\ni keep thinking that my pro like i keep\nthinking about these problems and when i\nthink about them to my friends uh i keep\nthinking that\nmaybe my problems aren't that big of a\ndeal maybe i'm just overthinking that\nthese problems aren't actually big i\ndon't need to actually deal with them a\npart of me kind of goes to that\ndirection but now part of me gets scared\nabout that because it's like what if i'm\nunderestimating my problem sure what if\ni do have a lot of problems yeah so so\nthat that's where like you just like\nforget about what your mind actually\nsays mohammed and look at the direction\nthat your mind's thoughts move you in so\nhere i am i'm about to tell my close\nfriend that i'm really struggling with\nsomething and my mind is like oh like\nwhat if it's actually not that big of a\ndeal\nand it's not that big of a deal what\ndirection is that moving me in it's\nmoving me away from connecting with my\nfriend\nyeah and your mind will generate\nwhatever logic it needs to\nthe key thing is still going to be it\nstill comes down to like two or three\nvery simple things the first is where\nlike what do you think about yourself\nare you happy with the person that you\nare\nand my guess is that the answer is no\nbut\ni think that you think of yourself as a\nwork in progress which is a hundred\npercent correct\nyeah definitely\nthe challenge especially recently i've\nbeen planning a lot about my future yeah\nso especially what i'm what i'm trying\nto do i i don't think you have a\ntraditional level of like low\nself-esteem let's say where you're\nbeating yourself up all the time but i\ndon't think that you're\ni just don't think you're okay not being\nperfect for your friends\nyeah\nand the thing is like you're never gonna\nbe perfect\nin fact the idea of being perfect is\njust a trick our mind uses to prevent us\nfrom like connecting with other people\nright it's it's actually like a trick\nit's like we use the idea of perfection\nas a protection against rejection and\nbad outcomes\nif i make the perfect dating profile\nthen someone won't reject me if i turn\nmyself into the perfect friend and then\ni can share something with my friends\nthey'll be okay with it i won't be a\nburden i won't be guilty\nso we have this idea of if i'm perfect\nthen everything will be fine and we go\nchasing that perfection chasing that\nperfection chasing that perfection and\nit never comes\nit's just another time i'll say\nyeah i don't i'm not a person who kind\nof believes in perfection good\ni believe i believe in doing the best i\ncan then why don't you talk to your\nfriends\ni guess\ni guess apart from me because\nthese friends most of them are older\nthan me as well\na few years older than me but that few\nyears can make a difference\nso what if you you're telling me if you\nwere a couple of years more older you\nwere further along in your\nself-development journey then you would\ntalk to them\nwell\nno i'm not saying that part i'm saying\nthat uh\ni feel like\ni'm seeing their problems\nand then i'm comparing them to mine\ni'm like oh mine is not that big of a\ndeal\ni don't need to talk to them about this\nthey have a bigger problem\nthat's the kind of logic my mind takes\nme yeah and what direction is that is\nthat logic taking you\naway from talking to the solution yeah\noh yeah\nright so this is my like so i i i don't\ni think the tricky thing here uh\nmuhammad is that you actually have grown\na lot you're very intelligent you're\nvery introspective the problem is\nsometimes your intellect\nis hijacked by this part of you\nand so all of your talent and all of\nyour strength actually twists and turns\nand it tricks you but it just wants one\nthing which is safety\nand the one thing that it's going to do\nto feel safe is don't talk to your\nfriends\nbecause if you talk if you talk to them\nthey'll see you for who you are\nsince i'm such a toxic person\nor my problems are so small i'm going to\ninfect them and ruin their day\nor my problems are so unsolvable so like\nwhich is it is are your problems\nunsolvable because they're so big or\nthat you ruin their day because they're\nso tiny and petty and irrelevant\nright like it sounds kind of\ncontradictory but to your mind it's like\ni don't care either one is fine as long\nas we don't talk to them as long as we\ndon't talk to them as long as we don't\ntalk to them\nyeah\nlike a part of me was definitely the\npast few months i've been trying to\nisolate myself from talking to friends\nsure specifically\nright like the past few months i haven't\nseen any of them unless it was like\nsomeone's birthday\nthen i would show up for the birthday\nbut other than that i haven't been\ntrying to do anything interactive with\nthem only recently i tried to go back\nbecause i feel like it's maybe what i\nneed at least maybe not what i want\nright now but maybe it's what i need to\nat least be around them for a while to\nget back into the mood of\ntalking to them more good\nso mama what i'm gonna do if it's okay\nis i'm gonna try to like summarize a\nlittle bit of like maybe how you can\nmove forward is that all right\nyes okay so the first thing that i want\nto let you know is be aware of what your\nmind is doing\nokay it's not about right or wrong you\ndon't have to fix everything but i want\nyou to just notice like how slippery\nyour mind can be and don't worry about\nthe logic that it uses i want one part\nof your mind to pay attention to the\ndirection that your mind is going in\nright is this making me move away from\nfriends and then you'll see because as\nyou notice\nthat oh my mind is moving away from\nfriendship your mind will twist and turn\nand it'll give you a different argument\nit'll abandon that argument right away\nand it'll twist and turn but the goal is\nalways going to be the same which is\ndon't talk to your friends so this is\nwhere i would still recommend to you\nvery concretely that you go meta with\nthem and then you actually talk to them\nnot about your actual problems but about\nyour relationship\nand you can ask them hey what is it like\nif i were to share like some things that\nwere challenging in my life would that\nbe okay how would you feel about that\nhere are some concerns that i have so\nyou don't have to share it right away\nyou can say i'm afraid sometimes that\nlike my problems will seem\nit's kind of weird will seem either too\nsmall and then like you'll feel like\nit's a waste of time or they'll feel so\nbig that you won't be able to help me\nand then that in turn will make you feel\nbad\nyeah\nshare that with them ask them what do\nyou think about that\nokay can i ask something as well yeah\nbecause i feel like i can see logic\nwhere it would point me to the solution\ni see like i can understand like what i\nshould be doing to go to the solution\nbut my feelings kinda look the other way\nhundred percent\nfurthermore i i can see what anything\nneeds to be done but like my feelings\ntell me nope go the other direction yes\nor just don't do anything so that's\nwhere you've got to address the feelings\nright and what how do i do that exactly\nwell so let's focus on the conversation\nyou're going to have with your your\nfriends and then we'll talk about the\nfeelings in a second okay\nso how do you feel about having that\nkind of conversation with your friends\nthat kind of conversation i would be\nmore okay with than directly sharing\nokay good\nwhat exactly are my thoughts so what\nyou're gonna do is is you're gonna talk\nto your friends about the rules\nof friendship\nand sharing\nthat will help you feel more safe in\nopening up to them\nit's not going to happen overnight but\nit'll definitely move in the right\ndirection okay\nnow we move on to some of this stuff\nabout feelings and things like that\nso now i think the core issue here like\ni said is that something about you makes\nyou very very sensitive\nto being seen\nwhile you're not perfect\nright so even for like your family as\nyou were saying as you were growing up\nand they're noticed oh like look you're\nlike you're gonna you have a little\nmustache now you're gonna have to start\nshaving soon right it's a rite of\nmanhood that your older brothers are\npoking fun at you and you sort of\nrecognize okay i'm growing up\nso we just have to acknowledge that i'm\nnot sure exactly where that comes from\nif you do work with a therapist i think\nit's not a bad idea you can try to dig\ninto that kind of stuff with them\ni i don't know what country you're from\ni don't know anything about the quality\nof therapy in your country so i can't\nreally comment on that and if therapy in\nyour country is not very good we\napologize we also\nin a sense try to help so not you know\npeople who should be seeing i've been\nconsidering\nyeah i'm not too sure about that either\num but i think it's not a bad idea\nthe key thing though\nthat i'm getting muhammad is that you're\nnot comfortable in your own skin yet\nyou kind of feel like you're definitely\nyeah and and so like all of the emotions\nand stuff are going to stem from that\nand the key thing to understand i don't\nknow if you've seen our videos on vedic\npsychology or you watch dr k's guide but\nthat really explains it very well where\nwe sort of talk about the tricky thing\nis that your emotions want one thing\nyour logic wants another and what we\ndon't realize is sometimes our emotions\nhijack our logic and will create all\nkinds of justifications\nto keep us from doing things that are\nemotionally difficult\nthey'll basically\nbe a logical excuse to avoid\nand what are we avoiding ourselves yes\nwe're avoiding some kind of emotional\ndiscomfort\noh my god or conflict even yeah\nright so it could be conflict it could\nbe issues related to\nego and i'm not sure exactly you know\nwhat to do there i think it requires\nmore than what you know what we have\ntime for on the call-in show but i i\nthink that like at least to me\ni think you've come hopefully understood\nyourself a little bit better and like\nthe most important thing is not what the\nemotional issues are but\nnot to let your mind retreat from them\nand so he'd like kind of stop and catch\nit as is trying to\nfind a new excuse to\ndivert from the problem you know\nabsolutely right and then what you\nreally want to ask yourself is like what\nis my mind trying to avoid\nand try to look for an emotion that it's\ntrying to avoid or a perception of\nyourself\nso like or like it's either gonna try to\navoid an emotion or people thinking\nsomething about you it's gonna be one of\nthose two things\nand as you find out okay like then the\nnext question kind of becomes all right\nwhere did i learn to fear this thing\nwhere did i learn that if i share things\nwith friends of mine they'll start to\nthink that i'm weak\nand the more that you sort of follow\nthat process you'll follow it back to\nits root and then hopefully you can deal\nwith the core of the issue\nthat's what we call a sum scar\nyou can address it in therapy too\nokay\nyeah that makes sense\nall right\nany last questions or complications you\nwant to throw in\nuh\ni can't think of any of the ones oh my\ngoodness look at that\n[Laughter]\nsorry i realized that does that make you\nfeel a little bit uncomfortable if i'm\njoking with you a bit too much\nno no no like if i'm being honest when\nit comes to anything emotional i realize\ni get teary-eyed quickly but i also end\nup chuckling a lot good that's i i laugh\na lot through these times and that's the\nonly thing that kind of can keep me\nactually going in these conversations\ngood so mama first of all bro i'm super\nproud of you\ni think you're doing awesome thank you\nand i think that you don't have to be\nperfect to be okay and this is what life\nis right it's just like one step at a\ntime my friend\ntake care yeah\nyeah thank you thank you very much take\ncare\ni think uh tech teller we're gonna have\nto end because that ended up being\nlonger than expected\num so please extend my apologies to\neveryone in the waiting room man i feel\nso bad like there's like a thousand\npeople in there\nbut um\nyeah it's challenging to try to balance\nlike giving people the time they need\nand like making time for other people\njust to kind of summarize so this is\nsuper\ntricky but good\nso sometimes we have difficulty\nconnecting with people\nand what we actually find ourselves\ndoing is like being like we can open up\nto strangers on the internet but we\ncan't open up to our friends\nand the challenge there is that if we\nkind of like look at it sort of makes\nsense right because opening up to a\nstranger on the internet is safe\nbecause at the end of\nyou know at the end of the conversation\nif you said too much\nor you're afraid of what they think of\nyou you can just like retreat right and\nyou can ghost them block them never talk\nto them again let things fizzle out\nbut in real life when it comes to\nopening up with friends opening up with\nfamily opening up with romantic partners\nthat's really tricky because if you open\nup to them you have to live with it\ntomorrow you have to see them again\nso it's very natural for us to want to\ndisclose things to strangers it's a very\nwell understood part of psychology it's\npart of the reason that we have the\nrestrictions that we have in our group\ncoaching program because we sort of\nrecognize that if you want to\nauthentically work work on your problems\nworking on them with a friend always has\na conflict of interest\nbecause you have to maintain the\nrelationship\nand work on your problems and what if\nworking on the problem actually\nnegatively impacts the relationship\nso that's why we try to create a very\nspecific space in group coaching where\npeople can authentically work on shared\nproblems\nthat's also why sometimes people get\nupset but we restrict things in group\ncoaching no playing video games together\nno having conversations outside of group\nwhy is that it's because it\nchanges the relationship\nintroduces conflicts of interest and\nsometimes people in group are really\nupset by that they're like i like these\npeople so much we've gotten to know each\nother so well why can't we have fun\nthat's exactly why\nbecause once you start having fun\nthe authenticity and the a sacred space\nwithin group gets destroyed\nthere are a thousand people on the\ninternet ten thousand ten million people\non the internet for you to play games\nwith not someone in group\ngo find someone else there are even\npeople on our district 80 000 people on\nour discord server you can play games\nwith them\nnot people in group\ngroup is a sacred space for you to work\non problems where you can be authentic\nand like work with a group of peers\nso this is common for us to only want to\nconnect to strangers on the internet\nthe issue is what do we do about it so\nnow we had a fantastic caller\nwho\nevery time they try to talk about\nsomething so first thing that we kind of\nnotice is that as we start to dig into\none problem their mind adds something\nelse oh by the way as soon as this is\nstarting to take shape\nlet's add another variable\nand as we start to work on that let's\nadd another variable and as we start to\nwork on that let's add another variable\nand so this is the sign of a slippery\nmind\nand you may notice this yourself that\nsometimes like\nwhen there's something you're afraid of\nyour mind will come up with whatever\nexcuse it can to have you not do it\noh your problems are too big for them to\nhandle they're not going to be able to\nhelp you you're going to make them feel\nguilty or your problems are too petty\nthis person is four years older than you\nthey've grown past all this kind of\nstuff it's pathetic that you even have\nthese problems and you're bothering this\nperson the end result is the same\ndon't have the conversation\nand where is that fear coming from\nbecause we want to project something to\nour friends\nright we want to be valuable as friends\nwe don't want to burden them all kinds\nof other stuff comes in\nthe end of the day if you're in this\nkind of situation where you're trying to\nfigure out okay like how do i have\nhow do i develop trust with my real\nfriends how do i share these kinds of\nthings my concrete recommendation would\nbe that you go meta\nso this is a technique that we use in\ncoaching a lot it's also used in therapy\ni also you can use it\nin any kind of it's useful for any kind\nof conflict resolution\nso the idea of going meta is you don't\ntalk about the thing\nyou don't\naddress the thing you talk about\naddressing the thing\nso if i say for example\ni'm happy to talk about anything except\nfor money\nso instead of talking about money what\npeople can ask is is you can ask well\nhow can you help me understand what is\nit about money that makes you not want\nto talk about it\nright we're not going to talk about\nmoney but just help me understand why\nyou don't want to talk about money so\nthat i'm i can respect your boundaries\nso in the case of a friendship you know\nyou can sort of ask them like hey like\nwhat is like how do we be like not how\ndo we be friends but\nwhat's okay to talk about in this\nfriendship\nso instead of sharing this particular\nthing like oh i have these\nparticular thoughts that i'm embarrassed\nabout instead of talking and sharing\nthose thoughts you can ask your friend\nyou know is it okay for me to share\nthings with you that\nmay seem petty\nsometimes i'm about to share something\nand i want to share something but i'm\nafraid that it'll burden you or i'm\nafraid that you'll think it's petty and\ninsignificant\nwhat do you think about that so have a\nconversation about having a conversation\nthe interesting thing is that the more\nthat you go meta the more that you move\naway from the emotions\nso when you're talking about the issue\nitself\nit's highly emotionally charged\nevery time we play video games you feed\nand you throw\nright that's emotionally charged stop\nthrowing\nhey can we talk a little bit about how\nwe play video games together\nwhat's your approach to playing video\ngames what's my approach to playing\nvideo games\nand so you can even go like meta meta\nmeta meta\nso you can even say like oh you don't\nwant to talk about money like can you\nplease tell me why you don't want to\ntalk about money i don't want to talk\nabout why i don't want to talk about\nmoney\noh that's totally fine\nno problem\ncan you tell me a little bit about what\nmakes you reluctant to talk about the\nreasons that you don't want to talk\nabout money\nand each step away we get the less\nemotionally charged it is the easier it\nis to insert yourself into a healthy\nconversation\nthis is the tricky thing is that when\nthere's a\nthere's a charge an emotional subject we\nwe know we need to talk about it but no\none ever teaches us how do you like ease\ninto the topic\nright like how do you ease into this\nand so the way that you ease into it is\nthat you go meta so you go one level\nabove where things are not quite as\ncharged\nand then you can go like inception like\none layer deeper and then one layer\ndeeper and then one layer deeper until\nyou get to the core issue\nright so i'll leave y'all with one last\nexample so let's say that\ni have a conflict with my wife so we can\naddress the conflict\nor what we can do is talk about you know\nlike going to couples therapy to address\nthe conflict right so like we don't want\nto address the conflict but we can like\ndo couples therapy if we do couples\ntherapy like that's that's a separate\nconversation up here that will\neventually get to down here and then if\nmy partner doesn't want to do couples\ntherapy then what i can do is have a\nconversation with them about okay if you\ndon't want to do couples therapy like\nhelp me understand why\nhelp me understand your perspective on\ncouples therapy\nright so you can like keep going\nuntil you reach a safe territory\nbecause then you're so abstract that you\ndon't even know what you're talking\nabout anymore\nand then you kind of want to like go one\nlayer deeper one layer deeper one layer\ndeeper in terms of friendship it's like\nhey like what is it safe for me to share\nwith you about\nwhen we're friends what can i talk to\nyou about i'm afraid that you're going\nto judge me a particular way\nwhat do you think about that\nright so you can have you can talk about\nall that stuff and then ease into\nwhatever the sensitive issue is\nwe also use this technique a lot when\nwe're sort of coaching parents to work\nwith their kids\nespecially around like healthy gaming\nhabits and stuff like that right so like\nyou know\nif you don't want to talk about limiting\nyour gaming that's totally fine help me\nunderstand like\nwhat makes it hard for you to engage in\nthat conversation and then the child is\nlike well every time we talk about it\nyou punish me\nand then we're making progress right\nbecause now we're talking about okay\nlike so every time we talk about it you\nfeel like you're getting punished\nthank you for sharing that\nand now we can talk about okay how\nshould we talk about video games without\nit immediately jumping to punishment and\nonce we solve that then we can go to\nvideo games\nyou"
