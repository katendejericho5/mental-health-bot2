    "transcript": "you know people grow and change but even\nfor gifted kids it's a different kind of\nchallenge what they need to grow and\nchange is actually different because\nwhat they have to do is abandon\neverything that they've invested in\nso\nlet's talk a little bit about gifted\nkids\nso i want to start this off by\nsharing a little bit about how we\nlearned what we're going to share\nactually let me just take a step back\nlet's start over so let's talk about\ngiving kids\nso what i want to share with you all\ntoday is\nwhy especially as adults\nit's hard to get help as a gifted kid\nso the thing about gifted kids is that\nyou know we kind of grow up\nand then especially once we reach\nadulthood there's a certain stickiness\nto being gifted\nthere's a certain stickiness or inertia\nto changing right so even if i know i'm\ngifted even if i know that like i hyper\nintellectual eyes and things like that\nit's hard to actually change\nand it turns out that the reason it's\nhard to change\nthe reason a reason actually has to do\nwith sort of the gifted kid complex\nand what we tend to find is that for\nsome reason\nkids who grow up gifted really struggle\nas adults and it's my belief that the\nreason that they continue to struggle as\nadults\nis because they're actually resistant\nthere's a resistance to change\ni don't mean like internally like you\ndon't want to change i mean that\nsomething about the way that your\npsychology is formed\nmakes it hard for you to change\nand that's why they actually struggle as\nadults because we can have all kinds of\nproblems as kids but generally speaking\nas we grow into adults like a lot of\nthem get better right because we're able\nto change them we can put in effort we\ncan put in time we can put an energy and\nthey can change\nbut when it comes to being a gifted kid\neven if you put in the time the energy\nand the effort and even other people try\nto help you it seems like something\nabout that complex is resistant to\nchange\nso that's what i'd like to talk about\nthe cool thing about this is that this\nis something that we sort of discovered\nhere at hg by virtue of kind of how we\ndo things\nso we made a couple videos about gifted\nkids and so this is what's really neat\nabout the aoe healing kind of\nperspective we made a couple of videos\nabout the gifted kids we streamed about\nit so people joined our community they\nshared their problems with us\nand so what we're really noticing is as\ngroups of people share their problems\nwith us we can synthesize\nall of those disparate experiences and\ndistill them down to certain principles\nthis is basically how research is done\nright\nso like we take a bunch of different\ncases and we kind of like figure out\nokay what's the common thread the neat\nthing is that what i'm noticing is that\nmental health problems seem to be\nevolving\nrapidly so the old paradigms don't seem\nto be working and what we actually do is\nwe'll assemble data from for example all\nthe gifted kids who joined our coaching\nplatform and then we'll kind of like\ntalk to the coaches okay what worked\nwhat didn't work what seems to be the\nproblem we can kind of distill things\ndown and we can figure particular things\nout so what i'm sharing with you all\ntoday is actually is distillation of\nwhat all of the gifted kids who have\nbeen a part of not all but you know what\nthe gifted kids who participate in our\ncommunity what we've sort of learned\nfrom them and what we noticed\nis that\neven though they want to change and even\nthough they try to change and even\nthough they know they should change it's\nhard for them to change\nso we're going to share that with y'all\ntoday\nthe first thing to understand is that\nthe brain is an efficient organ\nso if you think about your dominant hand\nversus non-dominant hand\nwhich one do you use more use your\ndominant hand more right so anytime that\nyou have a task\nyou can make it easy by using your\ndominant hand or you can make it hard by\nusing your non-dominant hand\nand so over time actually what happens\nis as you lean into the things that are\neasier for you\nas you use your dominant hand your\ndominant hand actually becomes stronger\nit becomes reinforced\nand so what happens with gifted kids is\nthey've got\none\nexcellent advantage which is their iq\nso what happens is they use their iq as\na substitute for all kinds of other\nthings\nright so a simple example of this is\nlike let's talk about study habits\nso when i'm like seven and i'm gifted\nor let's say nine\nand some kids are learning how to study\nbecause they don't pick it up right away\nmy mind is like why am i gonna waste\ntime developing study habits when i can\njust understand everything with my\nintellect\nright it's kind of like the same reason\nwhy every day when you brush your teeth\nyou use your dominant hand you don't use\nyour non-dominant because your brain is\nlike why bother making doing things the\nhard way when we can do things the easy\nway\nso what happens is we lean into our\nintellect and generally speaking school\nis sort of designed for the average kid\nand we sort of like pace things you know\nand so we sort of teach we don't teach\nstudy habits to like five-year-olds we\nstart teaching them the eight-year-olds\nnine-year-olds 10 year olds 12 year olds\n14 year olds and the amount of studying\nyou need to do like ramps up over time\nso what happens with a gifted kid\nis they don't need to study at seven\nthey don't need to study at nine they\ndon't need to study at eleven they don't\nneed to study at 13. they're not going\nto learn it right because you don't need\nit\nand then 14 happens 15 happens 18\nhappens you go to college and then you\nhit a brick wall\nbecause at this point your intellect is\ninsufficient\nand you don't know how to study because\nyou never built up you know it's like\ngoing straight you know these open world\ngames where you go to a zone where\nyou're not supposed to be that's what\nit's like to be a gifted kid in college\nlike level one and you can go through\nall the stuff then you find yourself in\nthis level 100 zone and suddenly like\nyou didn't level up you didn't go the\nway you were supposed to\nand then suddenly you're like getting\none-shotted by everything\nso one of the key things here is one of\nthe the faculties that gifted kids\nalmost have\nunderdeveloped is emotions\nthe awareness of emotions\nbeing able to understand your emotions\nbeing able to operate from your emotions\nwe tend to see is that these kids are\nhyper intellectualized\nright so i use my intellect for\neverything so i know this sounds kind of\nweird but there's even a term for this\nin research which is called cognitive\nempathy versus emotional empathy\nso when we think\nabout empathy we think it's emotional\nright so like like i see someone else\ncrying and then i feel like crying\nand then once i feel like crying i know\nhow they feel and i operate from there\nbut there's a second kind of empathy\nwhich is something called cognitive\nempathy and cognitive empathy is not\nwhen you feel\nwhat they feel\nyou still know how to respond in the\nright way but that's because you\nlogic it out\nyou use reasoning to figure out okay\nwhat am i supposed to do\nin this situation\nwow that person is really crying you\ndon't feel sad but you're like okay let\nme like figure this out\nokay i should like pat them on the back\nand tell them oh my god it's so it\nsounds terrible what you've been through\nso even emotional like interpersonal\nrelationship kind of things become like\ncognitive things\nand why is that it's because your brain\nhas one thing that it's really good at\nso it uses that tool because the\nemotions are underdeveloped and the more\nthat you get by with cognitive empathy\nyou level up your cognitive empathy\nskill but then once again that's going\nto hit a wall as well when it comes to\nlike a deep relationship for example or\nmaking friends later in life\nso you've leaned so much into your\nintellect that other parts can be\nunderdeveloped\nand so the reason this this is important\nis because of issues like motivation and\nchange\nso what happens when a gifted kid tries\nto change\nwhat do they do\nright they figure out what they should\ndo\ndoes that make sense\nso let's kind of like recap a little bit\nso gifted kids\nhigh iq\nright so then they level up\nintellect\nwe become a one-trick pony\nright if you're a d and d character\nstrength is three\ndax is three\ncon is three\nint is twenty five\nwisdom's three\nchristmas three\nright yeah there is a well let's give\nyou eights\nokay\nfair enough fair enough chat\nso you level up your intellect and so\nwhat that sort of means is that even\nwhen it comes to emotions\nwe end up using cognitive empathy\nto navigate personal situations\ninterpersonal situations\nnow what happens though is that when you\ntry to change\nright so when you have particular\nbehaviors like if i'm like okay i need\nto change i need to start studying\nthe problem is that the difficulty with\nstudying\nis not intellectual\nso you can read a book\nabout how to study but it doesn't make\nyou study and this is the\ncrux of the first problem that gifted\nkids sort of struggle with\nis that no amount of logic actually\ncreates behavioral change\nand what and the reason that what really\ncreates behavioral change or the\nfastest the most potent\nchange of behavior is actually emotions\nright so if i like feel really\nembarrassed by giving you know a\npresentation\ni will do my best to never give a\npresentation again\nwhen i feel really really fantastic\nafter making a comeback in a dota game\nor league of legends game or valorem\ngame or whatever cs go\nthat emotional reinforcement makes me\nwant to play again\nso behavioral change comes from emotions\nnow there's an intellectual component as\nwell but what we tend to find is that\nthe change that requires just intellect\nis the change that gifted kids can do\nand the change that requires emotion is\nwhat they get stuck in\nthe second thing\nto consider so we're going to sort of\ntouch on the vedic model of the bind for\na moment so if we think about the three\nparts of our mind\nthere's the emotional mind\nthe ego\nand the intellect\nso intellect is like our logical\ncapability our analytical reasoning\nemotions or things like you know fear\njoy\nexcitement\nright you'll get that these are like\nfundamentally different\nso there's there can be reasons they\nthey can interact with each other\nthey're gonna be reasons that you're\njoyous but the experience of joy and the\nreason that you're joyous are two\ndifferent things\nand then what i think is actually under\nappreciated in some parts of psychology\nbut definitely appropriately appreciated\nanother is the ego is the identity so\nthe sense of self\nwho i am\nis not necessarily\nanalytical reasoning there may be\nanalytical reasoning involved and it's\nnot emotion\nit's an identity\nso what happens with the gifted kids\nidentity let's understand this like do a\nquick recap okay\nso\nwhen i'm a gifted kid i'm young and i'm\nsmart and everyone tells me i'm smart\nand so i develop an identity i'm a smart\nkid\nwhy am i smart what makes a smart kid\nthings are easy for smart kids\nwhen i don't have to study at all and i\nget an a on a test\nthat makes me smart\nand this other kid over here who has to\nstudy for six hours to get an a on a\nmath test\nthat kid is an idiot\nso a key part of being gifted\nis effortless success\nthat's what it means right oh he's so\nhe's so talented it's so easy for him\nso now we get into a big problem\nbecause then i've got choices\nas a kid oh i'm so gifted\ndo you want to do gymnastics\nyeah that sounds fun\nand when i go to gymnastics\ndo i experience effortless success\nno\nwhat does that mean about me\noh crap if my\ni probably experience failure or at best\neffortful success\nand are either of these things\ngifted\ndo gifted kids fail no they don't\ndo gifted kids work really hard no\nthey're gifted\nit's a gift there's no effort\nso we don't want that because we want to\nbe a gifted kid because everyone is so\npositive emotionally towards us for\nbeing gifted\nso what this means is that we move away\nfrom gymnastics we're not going to do\ngymnastics\nbecause if we do gymnastics then we're\nno longer gifted\nso over time\nlet's say there are five tasks that i\nfive things i could do i'm not going to\ndo this one because it's hard i'm not\ngoing to do this one i'm not going to do\nthis one i'm not going to do this one\nthis is the only thing that's left i'm\ngoing to do this one because this one i\ncan do effortlessly\nand then as life goes on our range of\nwhat we can participate in\nto maintain our identity as a gifted kid\nshrinks\nand the problem is that the less we do\nthese things\nthese don't become a part of our\nidentity so all we have left is the\ngifted kid\nso i'm not a gymnast at this point i'm\nnot a hard worker\nso the more that my experience is narrow\nand the more i avoid the more my\nidentity doubles down triples down\nquadruples down into being a gifted kid\nthis is ego\nand identity\nnow the problem the real problem with\nbeing a gifted kid what makes it hard to\nchange\nis that our intellect is super super\nstrong\nbut it is going to sound kind of weird\nour ego is actually weak or our control\nover our ego is weak our control over\nour emotions\nis weak\nso these two faculties are under\nunderdeveloped and what do i mean by\nweak\nwhat i mean is that gifted kids have not\ndone a lot of that trial and tribulation\nwork to discover who they are right\nbecause actually what happens is they\nget given a label\nand instead of actually discovering who\nthey are they're told who they are and\nthen they avoid all the experiences that\nhelp you develop a healthy identity\nso they have an unhealthy identity\nit's a oversimplification to be sure\nnow here's the real tricky thing\nthese parts of the mind\ninteract with each other\nand depending on the quote-unquote\nstrength of a particular part of mind\none will win and one will lose\nso i'll give you all a simple example so\nthis is something we understand very\nwell in psychology\nso sometimes i can intellectually have a\ngood reason to do something but\nemotionally i don't want to\nso what happens\nthere's a war between these two parts of\nmy mind\nso our amygdala which is where which is\nour fear and survival center is telling\nus don't do this thing and our frontal\nlobes are telling us but by the way we\nneed to do this thing\nand so then they fight\nand one of them comes out on top\nnow this is where gifted kids may think\noh but my intellect is so\nstrong doesn't it mean that it comes out\non top and actually the answer is kind\nof no\nthat\nthe less in touch with our emotions we\nare the less we're able to regulate\nthose so actually emotions\noutweigh the strength of the intellect\nin this kind of situation because you\ndon't you've learned even though your\nintellect is robust your analytical\ncapability is robust\nyour control over your emotions is so\natrophied\nthat you don't even realize it that\nyou're kind of feeling negative emotions\nbut you just kind of feel stuck\nthe more insidious thing and this is\nkind of what we're going to focus on is\nthe relationship between the intellect\nand the ego\nso the less in control\nof our ego we are the more it actually\nhijacks intellect\nso i'll give you all an example\nif someone says\ndr k you\ntaught something that was wrong\non\nstream and they present me with some\nevidence\nthere are two ways that i can approach\nthat\nso if my ego wins out i'm like who is\nthis random person on the internet\ntelling me that i did something wrong\ndid they train at harvard medical school\nare they medical doctors are they dr k\ndid they study in india for seven years\nthat's ego\novercoming intellect\nand even if you think about it what am i\nactually doing in that moment\ni'm providing a lot of justification\nright so my mind\nsince it's so strong says oh look hms\nmonk training dr k\nthese are all evidence\nright\nso what my ego does is it goes to my\nintellect\nand it says come up with a bunch of\nreasons\nwhy\nwe can ignore this person\nright and then the intellect is like yes\nsir\nhappy to since i'm so smart\ni'm gonna give you a thousand reasons\nand they can try to argue and convince\nyou as much as they want to\nthat you made a mistake but since we are\nso intelligent we have such a powerful\nresearch computer that we will be able\nto refute every single point that they\ncan ever come up with\nthe problem here is that this is the ego\nin control\nof the intellect\nso the problem that gifted kids face is\nthat they have a very very powerful\nintelligence\nwhich is out of their control\ngets hijacked\nby their ego and their emotions\nso it's almost like like\nyou know i'm kind of envisioning like a\nsuper powerful robot\nwith a tiny little person inside\npulling the levers\nand so the the gifted kid has an ego\nthat's like this gigantic robot which is\nso strong\ncan\nmove mountains\nwalk through the ocean smash cities\nlift thousands and thousands and\nthousands of kgs\nand inside is this tiny little ego\ncontrolling everything\nso if you think about it if my intellect\nis really really strong what does that\nmean about the strength\nof my cognitive\nbias\nsecond reason that gifted kids struggle\ntheir cognitive biases are far are much\nharder to dislodge\nit's interesting it's the case of a very\npowerful tool that you have lost control\nof\nand so when gifted kids try to get help\nthey actually\nwill shoot it down so let me tell y'all\nwhat this looks like in the mind of a\ngifted kid\nso if i read a book\nthat tells me how to\novercome your procrastination\nas i'm reading the book as a gifted kid\nwhat am i going to be doing am i going\nto be learning everything in the book\nactually no\nwhat's going to be happening is i'm\ngoing to be poking holes in it as i read\nthat won't work for me\nthis person is saying this but they\ndidn't consider this\nright\nand it's going to be critical like\nyou're not going to be shooting\neverything down\ni'm a special case beautifully said\nrebooted life\nand this isn't wrong right\nbecause how does the person start to\nbelieve that i'm a special case by the\nway which of these three parts of mind\ndo you think that this is coming from\nthis statement is coming from ego\nbut how do they become a special case\nlet's look at look at that for a second\nit's because when they were 14 and\nthey'd never learned how to study\nand they need to start studying\ntheir parents would say just study\nand if the parent says just study\nand just studying works for everyone\nelse\nand it doesn't work for you\nwhat do you logically conclude\ni'm a special case\nthis thought is not wrong\nthis is the key thing to understand none\nof the thoughts in the gifted kid's mind\nare actually wrong\nthe problem\nis the direction\nso what do all of these\nthoughts\nmove you towards in terms of behavior\nwhat is the consequence of these\nthoughts being true\nit ain't gonna work\nyou're going to shoot things down\nand you all may have have talked to\nsomeone who's also a gifted kid or maybe\npeople have talked to you\nwhere people have tried to help you\nand so now we move on to number three\ngifted kids are help seeking\nand help rejecting\nthere's this really tricky thing\nwell they'll ask for help\nand then they'll push it away\nwhat's going on here\nby the way i need help oh read this book\nright so we sort of set that up these\nare the kinds of thoughts that we have\nhow does help seeking help rejecting\nthing work\ni need help\nbut it won't work\nand this is where things get a little\nbit more insidious\nso the higher your iq is\nthe more you can read into possibilities\nin the future\nright so like if i'm like playing a\nchess game and i have a high iq and\nchess is a skill right so it's not just\nall about iq\nbut let's say i can look at move number\none move number two move number three\nand then if i have a higher iq i can go\nmove number two move number three\nmove number four\nmove number five move number six move\nnumber seven\nand so sometimes what happens with\ngifted kids is they're able to see into\nthe future and they'll they'll try the\nfirst step\nthe problem is based on the first step\nthey will actually have a deterministic\nview about where they're going to end up\nbecause the truth of the matter is that\nwe could go to a over here we could go\nto b over here we could go to c over\nhere\nand then from c we could go to delta\nyou can't actually predict the future\nso the way this looks in gifted kids is\nthat okay like people are telling me if\ni want to make friends i need to just go\nto parties\nso what'll happen is a kid will go to a\nparty and they'll be afraid that no one\nis going to talk to me and if no one is\ngoing to talk to me i'm going to be like\na loser at the end of the night i'm\ngoing to go home and i'm not going to\nhave any fun\nthey go for 15 minutes and no one talks\nto them and then their mind actually\ntells them hey by the way we've\ncalculated this out we know this is how\nwe know how this is going to end\njust go home now\nthey go to the party they spend 15\nminutes in a corner on their phone\ntheir mind is like this is gonna suck\nlet's go home\nand they know that if they stay i don't\nwanna sit at a party in a corner for\nthree hours just being on my phone\nand then they go home\nbecause they've calculated everything\nout\nand so if you try to help a gifted kid\nand sometimes gifted kids will ask\nright\nif you try to help a gifted kid this is\nwhat you'll see\nthey'll take the first step\nand then they'll reject\nand what statements do they use all\nthese ego statements i'm a special case\nit ain't going to work for me\nso it can be incredibly frustrating to\nbe a gifted kid in this situation\nbecause you're asking for help you know\nyou need help\nand when you ask people the help that\nthey give you is never going to be\nenough it's never sufficient\nbecause they didn't consider this\nand they didn't think about that\nand they didn't realize why that won't\nwork for you\nbut let's think let's understand this\nokay tunnel down\nwhat's the goal\nof\ngoing straight to seven in your mind\nwhat does your mind get\nwhen it tells you oh by the way this is\nexactly what we thought don't bother\nwith all this crap just go home\nwhat does it gain\nvery good\nmagic man\nah oh so many good answers\nright it's protecting itself\nbecause if we were to sit\nand efficiency we'll get to that in a\nsecond\nif we were to sit in a room\non our phone for three hours each hour\nthat goes by how are we gonna feel about\nourselves\nwe're going to feel\npathetic\nso this is the key thing to understand\nabout the mind\nthe purpose of the ego\nis to protect us\nwhy can't i\nerase it erase\nnope okay gg\nsee if this works there we go\nthe purpose of the ego is to protect us\nso what our mind is doing is it's\nanticipating this negative emotion\nwe already feel pretty useless anyway\nbefore we went to this party and all\nit's going to do is confirm our\nsuspicions\nand if it confirms our suspicions we're\ngoing to be more hopeless\nso best leave now\nso what it's what it's trying to do is\nit's trying to protect you\nfrom feeling pathetic so it tells you go\nhome it tells you\navoid\nbecause remember your ability to manage\nemotions\nis also\nunderdeveloped\nbecause you could get by with intellect\nfor so many different things\nso it's kind of interesting\nbecause we end up avoiding even though\nwe know we need help and we ask for help\nand so we become help seeking and help\nrejecting at the same time and that's\nwhy it's hard for us to change\nbecause when help comes down the\npipeline\nwe're afraid\nand we end up rejecting it we know we\nneed help\nbut we reject it\nnow there's another very very insidious\npart to the help rejection\nso\nsometimes the help rejection is because\ngifted kids look\nfor\nthe perfect\nformula\nthere's definitely a way to solve my\nproblem\ni'm sure it can be solved i just have to\nfind the perfect formula and so if\nsomeone says something\nwe're going to kind of\nthat doesn't account for this variable\nso if you like talk to them they'll sort\nof you know it doesn't account for x so\nthat's not enough and then we have to\naccount for y so that's not enough then\nwe have to count for z\nand we're looking for the perfect\nformula\nwhy are we looking for the perfect\nformula\nbecause we're actually terrified\nof trying and it not working\nso here's the other reason why gifted\nkids really reject\nhelp\nbecause if i try and it doesn't work\nthe possibility of help\ngoes away\nright as long as i don't try\nas long as i'm looking for more\nvariables\nthere's a chance i can figure it out and\nif i find that perfect formula it'll be\nperfectly successful\nbut if i try a half-baked thing and it\ndoesn't work\nthen like what if nothing works\nso this is something that's very\nimportant to understand is that's part\nof this avoidance is because you can\nactually preserve hope\nif you haven't figured out the perfect\nformula for formula yet and it's out\nthere\nbut what if someone says oh my god so\nthey say like look dude\nyou've asked me for help 15 times i'm\ntelling you there is no perfect formula\nyou just gotta do it that's the only\nthing that'll work you just gotta do it\nand the gifted kid is like okay fine but\nin their mind what are they terrified of\nif everyone is telling you you just\ngotta do it you just gotta do it you\njust gotta do it\nand you do it and it doesn't work what\nthen\nyou're screwed\nthen there's no hope\nso this is why\nas long as the advice they're giving you\ncan be dismantled in your mind there's\nhope for you\nbut the moment that you accept what they\nsay\nand if you actually roll the dice and it\ndoesn't work then you're screwed it's\nfinished\nso if i try something\nand it doesn't work\nhow can i preserve hope\noh i didn't i didn't find the perfect\nformula oh i didn't i didn't account for\nthis i didn't account for this i didn't\naccount for this\nbut it's very paralyzing for gifted kids\nand this is why they'll reject a lot of\nthe hope that people are help that\npeople will offer them\nthere's other things involved here as\nwell which is like if someone tells you\njust do it and then you do it and then\nit works\nwhy didn't you do it 10 years ago if\nyou're so gifted\nwhy didn't you just do it 10 years ago\nand so oddly enough the most bizarre\nthing\nis that if you put your life together\ntrick question\nwhat\ndoes\nit say\nabout\nyou\nhmm\nlet's say i screw around fail out of\ncollege and things like that i don't\nknow how to study and i'm 28.\nand then if i start college at 28 and i\ngraduate at the age of 32\nwhat does it say about you\nso now you've got a choice\ndo gifted kids\nwrite on chat\ngraduate\nfrom college\nat the age\nof 32.\nno\nthat's what stupid kids do\nso now you've got a choice\ndo you want to be a stupid kid\nwith a life\nor\na gifted kid\nwithout one\nand this is the problem so this may\nsound like if i'm laying it out like\nthis\nyou may say like well obviously i'd\nrather be a stupid kid with life because\ni want a life i want a life i want to\nlife but this is what you've got to\nunderstand that if you've grown up as a\ngifted kid this is all you've got left\nthis is all you've got left this is all\nyou are\nis a gifted kid\nand to give up the one thing that you\nhave left\nis terrifying\nbecause here's the other scary thing\nyou failed out of college one so here\ncomes the intellect again you ready for\nit here comes the intellect\nyou failed out of college once\nwhat happens if you go to college for\ntwo years and you fail out again\nbecause we did it once\nthen\nyou're gonna be\na stupid kid\nwithout a life\nand two years of debt\nso it's like uh-uh we don't want that\nno way\nbuddy\nno chance\nso it's kind of interesting\nbecause the more gifted we are\nthe more we think that things should be\neasy for us\nright that's what it means to be gifted\neffortless success\nbut what we tend to find especially as\ngifted kids grow up\nis they tend to get stuck\nthey're not able to change they're not\nable to break out of it and then that\nlike triggers this whole cycle of if i'm\nnot able to fix this\noh my god what does it say about me\nit's hard\nbecause the very thing that sort of like\nyou know people grow and change but even\nfor gifted kids it's a different kind of\nchallenge what they need to grow and\nchange is actually different because\nwhat they have to do is abandon\neverything that they've invested in\nand that's scary like think about that\nlike who would do that\nwho would do that\nif you've invested your entire life in a\nparticular direction you're 30 years old\nand someone was like abandon it buddy\nabandon it girl\ngo for it get rid of it\nand you're like that's insane\nthere's no way that people would do that\nand yet we expect gift gifted kids to do\nit\nwe expect them to give up everything\nbecause that's what they have to do to\nchange\nand it's hard\nhow does that happen\nit starts because our brain is an\nefficient organ\nit starts because once my brain knows\nhow to use my right hand since this is\nmy dominant hand it's not going to waste\ntime leveling up my left-handed skill\nand it's no different when it comes to\nintellect versus other faculties of the\nmind\nso we see in gifted kids is that\ntheir emotional awareness tends to be\nunderdeveloped\nthey can sometimes be a little bit on\nthe alexa thymic side which means\ninability to determine what your\ninternal emotional state is\nso if you talk to gifted kids about\ntheir emotions\nthey're not going to know like how to\nanswer some of those questions they'll\ngive you a lot of reasoning and logic\nand they'll tell you what's wrong\nmy problem is that i have\nmy problem is that i have lexithymia\nwhich is not actually noticing your\nemotions it's an intellectual\nconclusion\nthey'll do a bunch of research right and\nthey'll say oh i have this kind of\nayurvedic thing or i have this kind my\nfive factor personality assessment shows\nme is low conscientiousness\nand high neuroticism\nand\nhigh openness and low agreeableness and\nthis is why i'm doomed in life\nbecause my conscientiousness is low\ni've done research\nall hyperintellectualization\nnow the problem with that and that's\nit's not their fault right because like\nthe reason that they get to that point\nis because you know when you're seven\nand your brain is like okay do we want\nto use our intellect or emotions to\nnavigate the situation and your\nintellect can map it out for you so\nyou're like okay let's use the intellect\ngreat plus 10 xp\nand the more you level up your intellect\nthe more useful of a tool it becomes\nand so the more you use it the more you\nlevel up this is an interesting\nobservation that was made by malcolm\ngladwell in outliers where he's like\nlooking at\nyou know kids who were born at a\nparticular time and so\nkids who are older when they start\nsports\nright because six year old some people\nwill be like six years and 11 months and\nsome people will be six years and one\nday\nso one of those kids is basically seven\nand one of them is six\nand so what happens is the kid who's\nalmost seven gets viewed as more\ntalented\nand as they get viewed as more talented\nthe coach\nthey get picked first on the team\nand they play more and they get more\npractice and the coach spends more time\nwith them because they're more talented\nin this kid it's not worth investing in\nthis kid and so what happens over time\nis you see\na exponential effect\nof investing in an early thing\nso over time the more your intellect\ngrows the more your mind relies on it\nthe more it relies on it the more swole\nyou become\nthe more swole you become the more you\nmove into the identity of the gifted kid\nthe problem\nis that as these other parts of your\nmind like your identity as the identity\nof the gifted kid becomes stronger as\nyou become more disconnected from your\nemotions\nyou struggle because logic does not\nactually change things\nor it's not sufficient to change\neverything let's put it that way\nthe other more insidious thing this is\nwhat we sort of learned from vedic\npsychology is that sometimes your\nintellect can be hijacked by your\nemotions by your ego\nand so what we see in gifted kids is\nthey have the\ntoughest cognitive biases\nbecause those biases were built from a\nhigh intellect\nand so these cognitive biases combined\nwith these ego sort of statements result\nin all of these kinds of things like\nthis won't work for me you recognize you\nneed help you reach out for help\nyou seek help and then you reject help\nthis won't work for me\ni'm different i'm a special case\nthis solution does not consider these\nvariables\nand so they'll seek help but what\nthey'll do is shoot it down\nand that's because their cognitive bias\nis so strong that like they're looking\nfor you know the perfect answer or they\nhave a lot of good reason because\nthey've learned early on that i am\ndifferent\nso a best-selling book that works for\nnormal people won't work for me because\ni'm not normal\nso they end up rejecting help\nthis can be further reinforced\nby your ability to predict\nin situations and so what happens\nis that as\ngifted kids make predictions about\nsituations and as they get the first\nstep\ndown that road\nand that step is what they expected they\nassume that the rest of it is going to\nbe exactly the same\nso if i go to a party and no one talks\nto me in the first 15 minutes the whole\nnight is gonna be miserable so i might\nas well leave\nand that in and of itself is very\ninsidious\nbecause the only way to change your\ncognitive bias the only way to change\nyour expectation is to stay at the party\nand so the very thing that is capable of\nchanging your mind is the thing that you\nretreat from if you're a gifted kid\nbecause maybe an hour in\nwe start playing board games\nand maybe you crush it at a particular\nboard game and you feel fantastic\nand so the very thing that you need to\nchange your mind is exactly the thing\nthat you avoid\nbecause of that anticipation of pain\nand the last thing to consider\nand this is actually quite devastating\nis that if you're a gifted kid and you\nhave so much potential and you're 25 now\nand you've wasted so much of it\nif you put together your life today\nwhat does it say about you\nand so sometimes what gifted kids will\ndo is they'll find solace\nin being both blessed and cursed\ni'm brilliant\nand i was born with low\nconscientiousness\ni have the gene in my life\nin my i have the laziness gene\nthe brilliant but lazy person\nand alas it is a tragedy\nand that's comforting right because if\nyou were born with laziness gene it\nain't your fault\nyou're not stupid\nand if all you've been for 25 years is a\ngifted kid\nthen like that's all you've got left and\nyou can't risk being stupid\nand so it becomes incredibly paralyzing\nbecause the very things that you need to\ndo\nto actually get out of the situation\nare the things that almost being a\ngifted kid like prevents you from doing\nit's a very very tricky situation which\nis precisely why i think we see\nso many gifted kids who struggle as\nadults\nit's almost like\na psychological trap where the tools\nthat you're supposed to use to overcome\nthese things are being leveraged against\nyou\nright when your intellect gets hijacked\ninto a cognitive bias that only leads to\none thing\nall roads lead to one place\nand when your intellect\nthe godzilla of your intellect\nhas one goal\nthen it's tough\nso what do you do about it\neveryone asks right\nso here's what we've seen through\nworking with people and in our coaching\nprogram and stuff right\nthere's a terrifying process\nof abandoning your identity\nterrifying\nhard to do on your own\nright there's a terrifying process to\nsubstitute\nex\ntheory with experience\nbecause the whole point of a gifted kid\nis they map everything out in their head\nit won't work because of this if i say\nat the party it'll be three hours of\nmisery\nso what happens that's really tricky is\nthat\ntheory becomes a substitute for\nexperience and the less experience that\nyou have\nthe more you have to lean on theory\nright\nand so it becomes a vicious cycle\nwhere now that i have less experience\nless experience less experience the more\ntheoretical models i make and the more\nthat i'm making theoretical models that\nare advanced and\ndivorced from experience the more i\nbecome separate from reality\nand like\nthat's where the bias comes in right why\ndo we call it a cognitive bias because\nit's actually incorrect\nso what we've sort of seen when working\nwith these kids right and now we feel\npretty confident about this because\nwe've had a lot of gifted kids come\nthrough\nis that it's about first of all\nstrengthening your understanding of your\nemotions\nyou have to increase the emotional\nawareness\nso we even now have we're trying to\ndevelop or we've got i think a study\nrunning\nabout whether\neq emotional quotient or your emotional\nawareness is a mechanism for progress\nwithin coaching\nso it starts by recognizing your\nemotions and like getting in touch with\nyour emotions and recognizing when your\nemotions are controlling you instead of\nyour intellect\nbecause the issue is not the gigantic\nmonster it's the tiny little person\ninside who's controlling the monster\nso when your intellect is hijacked by\nother parts of your mind\nso the other thing that's kind of\nimportant there is that as we sort of\nunderstand your emotions we can also\nlike validate\na lot of those emotions because here's\nthe thing for a gifted kid\nlife is supposed to be easy\nso does that mean you get to say that\nyour life is hard\nno\nno no no no life is hard for the stupid\nkids\nnot for us life is easy effortless\nsuccess\nand so when gifted kids deny themselves\nthe right\nto struggle\ndevastating\nso we've got to get in touch with our\nemotions and also acknowledge validate\nthat just because you're gifted it's not\nsufficient to living an easy life\nare there advantages 100 do we want to\nbe honest about those advantages 100\nbut we also want to be honest about the\nshortcomings of those advantages\nso you gotta understand your emotions\nsecond thing\ngotta understand your ego\nwhat does that mean gotta understand\nyour ego i'll break it down for you a\nlittle bit i mean this is a complicated\nprocess that takes weeks but\nas you engage in certain behaviors or\nyou think about engaging in certain\nbehaviors it's really important to ask\nyourself one question\nwhich is if i do this thing how will i\nfeel about myself\nhow will i it change the way that i see\nmyself\nwhat will it do to my sense of identity\nwhat will other people think of me\nthat's more than one question\nright this is why it's a process you\nhave to ask all those questions and for\nany individual person\none of those questions will sink in and\nwill lead to understanding or catharsis\nor one of many others\nbut you've got to think about how will\nthis affect my identity\nand so even when you go away like you\nknow when you're thinking about going to\nthe party\nhow would i think about myself if i did\nnot have fun at the party\nand that's when you start to realize i\nwill think that i am pathetic\nbecause no one wanted to talk to me\nand that's when you have to really\nleverage your intellect in kind of the\nright way\nwhich is well like what are the\ndifferent reasons why people may not\nhave fun at parties\nthis is why it's hard to do this on your\nown because it's hard to kind of think\nup and think of these questions that's\nwhy it's useful to work with someone\nright because they're going to be able\nto see well actually like if you really\nthink about it there are a lot of\nreasons why people don't have fun at\nparties it's not because they're\npathetic\nthe problem is that your intellect is\nnot being used\nit's being used to protect you in a\nparticular way because that's the only\nway it knows how to function it's not\nbeing used to challenge you\nright and we can kind of see that\nbecause when some other people try to\nhelp you\nand now we kind of move on to the help\nseeking help rejecting part what do you\ndo about that when other people give you\na different perspective what is the\nfunction of your intellect it's to\ndismantle it\nso what you're actually doing is\ndoubling down on your particular view\nyou're not actually challenging your\nassumptions\nyou're reinforcing them\nand the more that you reinforce your own\nassumptions the more that you enter the\necho chamber of your mind the more that\nyou drink the kool-aid the more that you\nfeed yourself propaganda the more stuck\nyou're going to be\nsee there's a shout out for raph\nraph is a fantastic coach i'm glad that\npeople have been helped by wrath\nglad it's resonating\nso you've got to challenge your\nassumptions\nwhen people ask you for help notice in\nyour mind that you're shooting it down\nand you've got to step away from and\nthis is where like\nnotice that the more you shoot it down\nyour mind is going towards avoidance\navoidance avoidance avoidance\nyou have to notice what it's doing\nit's not that it's logically incorrect\nit's that it's logically selective\nand we're going to select whatever logic\nwe can to encourage you to not do it\nso don't fall into that\nand the last thing to understand\nis that as long as you're operating from\ntheory the data set that you're using is\nnot ideal\nso what you've got to do is start\ngetting experience\nin the smallest way possible you don't\nhave to go to a party or you can even go\nfor a little while right you can even go\nlike there are little ways you can do\nthis\nyou can go to a party to drop something\noff you can say hey i'm busy tonight i\njust came by\nwanted to say sorry i can't make it\ni brought some cookies\nhopefully you all can enjoy them\nand then people like oh oh like you\nshould stay\nright and then you're like okay i'll\nhang out for a little bit and then you\nhang out for a little while now you've\ngot an excuse it's ego saving let's see\nif you can have fun if you have fun for\na little while\nyou can hang out longer\nbut put your put yourself out there a\nlittle bit right try to take a chance\neven when it comes to something like\ngraduating from college at the age of 32\nif you're 28\ngraduating is four years away you can\nenroll for a semester\nacknowledge for yourself that this is\ngoing to be hard\nbut this is a step in the direction that\ni want to go let's see what happens with\none semester i'm going to give it my all\nthe problem is that they use theory as a\nsubstitute for experience\nthe more used theory is a substitute for\nexperience\nthe more\ndivorced from reality you become\nso your theoretical models become\nmore and more incorrect\nand now you're navigating life with an\nincorrect theoretical model and how's\nthat going to work for you not well\nand that's what you see with adults who\nare gifted kids\nis they're operating\nfrom a well-constructed\nbeautifully\ntheoretical model\nthat's a little bit divorced from\nreality\nand that's why it's hard for them to\nchange\nquestions\nso\nmiss\nmr coffee is an enlightening teaching i\nwish i had known this for 30 years i'm\nglad i tuned and thank you you're very\nwelcome\num\nso someone else is saying the oncoming\nis saying i was meant to graduate 21 in\ngood college but i'm going to graduate\nat 31 at best this crushed my\nexpectations of myself and my soul\nmy heart goes out to you\nit crushed your ego\nwhich can be expectations of yourself it\ndidn't crush your soul\nwhat's going to rise what you'll rebuild\nfrom the rubble\ni honestly believe this\nwhat you're gonna rebuild from the\nrubble is actually\nmuch more strong much more reliable and\nis going to help you so much more than\nthe expectation that you had\nso it's okay to crush to have your\nexpectations crush from yourself that's\nwhen you can rebuild\nbecause you can't develop a new identity\nof yourself while this gigantic identity\nthat fills the room of your mind of\nbeing gifted kid exists\nthere's no room for anything else\nit's gotta be dismantled\nthis person sounds a little bit unlucky\nin a sense kinda like me where mine was\ncrushed\na failure after failure after failure\nafter failure\nand i'm sure that\neven today there are going to be\nsetbacks in my life\ni'm sure some of them will be\ndevastating\nand that's life\nyou got to pick up what you can and you\ngot to move on\nso it's hard i\ni get it this is one of the few things\nthat i honestly can say i've had\npersonal experience with\nso it's like i know it's tough and also\nkeep going\nthat's the most important thing\nwho's this person andrew tate\nall i see is comments about andrew tate\ni'm agreeing with andrew tate\nis that\nthey make it sound like an accusation\nall right\nit clipped i don't even know why is that\nclippable\ni\nlook\nlet me explain something to y'all\nthis is a twitch stream\nin a twitch stream\nthere's communication\ni teach something and you all teach\nsomething\nso like i don't know\nthis is if it weren't for y'all i\nwouldn't know\nhalf the things that i know\nright\nlike there's something going on some\nsomewhere in on the internet\nis it on you know\nhe's a new controversial dude on twitch\nokay thanks for letting me know\nnow i won't get\ni don't know\nnow i know\nif he's controversial like that's i\ni don't i don't know what to think about\nthat\nokay i've never met the guy like i don't\ni don't know what to think about him\nyou know\nso here's like just in general like it's\nreally easy to judge people on the\ninternet right\nit's easy to judge people but i\none of the things that we really try to\ndo and i hope we've demonstrated this\nso like sometimes people will think they\nknow someone right\nand the whole point is like when we talk\nto people\non stream what we try to do is like\ntreat them with compassion\nwe don't want to come in with judgment\nlike we want to recognize that human\nbeings are human beings\nno one's perfect\nno one's a complete waste of space\nlike everyone's just on their own\njourney\nyou know\ninterview him and you'll get 100k\nviewers look\nhow can i say this\nviewership matters\nand at the same time\nchasing viewership is not\nwhat we do\nright like we're here to try to help\nthere's no shortage of people to help\nand that's what our focus is going to be\ni'm not saying no i'm not saying yes\nit's just like i\npeople ask us to interview people all\nthe time like that's not\nhow can i say this\nwe're happy to interview people who are\naligned with the mission\nof what we're trying to do here which\ndoesn't necessarily mean they need to\nagree with us\ndoes that make sense like we interview\npeople for the purpose of aoe healing\nand sometimes we'll interview people\nthat are\num\nseem on paper like they can't be a part\nof that but what i've loved about this\nexperience of streaming on twitch and\ninterviewing people\nis that\nwe get to see the humanity within\neveryone\nis there a meditation to help with being\navoided 100\nlet's do it\nokay\nso hopefully for people who've been\nspamming chat about\nthis andrew tate dude hopefully you all\nare satisfied let's move on to\nmeditation\n[Music]\num\nso let's do a meditation about\ndealing with avoidance\nso what i want you all to do is sit up\nstraight\ntake deep breath in and out\nclose your eyes\ntake a few moments to just breathe\nand now i want you to think\nabout something\nin your life\nthat you\n[Music]\nare avoiding\nnow even that can be a little bit\ndifficult\nbecause oftentimes\nwhat we avoid\nwe actually don't even realize that we\navoid it\nwe'll even avoid it in our own mind\nwe'll come up with excuses\nlike i'll get around to it\nthere are more important things to do\nit won't really matter\nso if you know you're avoiding something\nfocus on that for a\nmoment the other thing that you can do\nif nothing comes to mind\nis look for those statements\ni'll get around to it later\nthere are more important things to do\nit doesn't matter\nand so if any of those statements leads\nyou up to a particular thing\nsit with that thing\ntake a moment to breathe\njust acknowledge and set firmly in your\nmind this particular thing\nthe first thing is that as you\nconcentrate on it\nnotice what changes in your body\nthere may be a tightness in the chest\nthe beginnings of perspiration forming\nnow what i want you to do is think a\nlittle bit about\nif you were to do that thing\nwhat are your concerns\nwhat are you concerned about happening\nand notice how those outcomes would\naffect you\nthey may cause you pain in your mind\ndisharmony in a relationship\npeople shaping their opinions of you\ndifferently\nnotice that the avoidance\nis actually a attempt at protection\nprotecting you from those things\nand now breathe into\nthose\nfears\nthose consequences\nand slowly breathe out\nand now i want you to take notice\nof yourself in this moment\nfeel the stability\nof your body\neven though we're thinking about things\nthat are hurtful\nor fearful\nthat in this moment we ourselves\nare not hurt\nit may be in there\nbut it doesn't dominate us\nand now start to appreciate that\nthat who you are\nis stable\nand strong\nat its core\nand that there may be hurt\nthat just in this moment\nas you have withstood it\nso too will you withstand whatever\nhappens\nthere will be pain\nbut you are strong enough\nthis person that you are in this moment\nis strong enough\nand know that as you engage in this task\nyou are signing yourself up for hurt\nbut that's okay\nit'll be painful for a time\nbut just as you found this state\nyou can find this state again\nand appreciate for a moment\nthat all of life's pain\nis transient\nand that all of life's joy\nis transient\nwhat exists always is the person that\nyou are in this moment\ncalm\npeaceful\nthat the fluctuations of the mind\ndisturb this thing\nthat you\nare but that you can return here\nand now ask yourself\nare you ready to do this thing\ncan we resolve to do this thing\nand if the answer is yes\nsolidify that answer recognize there\nwill be pain recognize it will be\ndifficult\nbut that you can do it\nyou are strong enough and that you will\nsurvive\nand if the answer is no\nnotice that\nhave compassion towards it\nfrom this peaceful calm place notice\nthat there's a part of your mind\nthat's too terrified\nis standing\nat the edge of a diving board\nready to dive into a pool of water\nbut is afraid of the jump\nis afraid of the cold water\nand needs some time some patience\nsome encouragement\nbefore it's ready to dive in\nand have compassion for yourself\nfor not being ready yet\nand assure yourself\nthat even if we're not ready today\nthe day will come\nwhen we will be ready\nput your palms together in front of you\nin namaste position\ngive gratitude to yourself\nto existence\nfor being able to experience this for\nthe last few moments\na place of stability\nin a chaotic world\nand now bow your head to the universe\nand give gratitude\nwhen you're done\ngo ahead and come on back\nopen your eyes\nso that's pretty true is saying oh i'm\nback to me\nthat's a sad pepe right\nsad\nhere's the thing\nthat's pretty true\nwhich one is the real you\nwhat you were a few moments ago you\ncarry with you\nif you practice you'll be able to tap\ninto it\nlike that\nand as chungli is saying it's hard to\nfeel compassion for myself it's one of\nthe hardest things\nthe hardest person to be compassionate\ntowards well not the hardest\nfor some people the hardest\nsome victims\nit's easier to feel compassion for\nyourself than it is to the person who\nhurt you\nbut\nforgive yourself for being hard it being\nhard\naccept that it's okay to be it's it's\nokay for it to be hard to feel\ncompassion towards yourself\nthat too is something that you're going\nto have to develop over time be patient\nwith yourself\neven if you can't feel self-compassion\nyou"
