    "transcript": "and so oddly enough i think actually\npart of the problem right now is that\nindividuals are accepting too much\nresponsibility for societal problems so\nlet's start with why we evolved to get\ndepressed or why do we why we evolved to\nexperience sadness and depression\nso the first thing to understand is that\nto a certain degree depression is like\nwithin the normal range of human\nexperience and we're not talking about a\nclinical illness here but we're talking\nabout periods of sadness okay\nso if we kind of think about it why is\nthe human being brain capable of sadness\nlike why doesn't our human brain just\nexperience positive emotion\nin order to experi since we experience\ndepression and anxiety what that means\nis that these emotions or sadness let's\ncall it sadness and worry\nthese emotions must have positive\neffects\nlike they have to have evolutionary\nsurvival benefits and we sort of see\nthat this is the case so for example\nanxiety or worry\nallows us to predict future problems\nand once we are able to predict future\nproblems if we get anxious about them\nwe'll alter our behavior to avoid that\nproblem\nright so if i'm worried about\nrunning out of food in the winter\nthat worry is gonna drive me to look for\nmore stuff store more food you know\nprepare for a rainy day and so what we\ntend to see is that even squirrels will\nprepare for winter right by like burying\nfood so there may be some amount we\ndon't really know i mean i haven't\nlooked at research on this but i imagine\nthat the squirrel experiences some\ndegree of anxiety\nwhere it's like oh i'd better take care\nof this otherwise i'm gonna be in\ntrouble\nwell what about sadness right so why do\nwe feel sad\nso sadness is a good way to correct our\nown behavior\nright so if i do something mean to\nsomeone else\nand other people get upset with me and\nthey shame me and then i feel sad\nthat sadness is going to essentially\nbe an internally imposed punishment that\nprevents me from engaging in the\nbehavior again\nright when i get ostracized for\nsomething\nand i feel really bad about myself\nostracization if i was like completely\nnumb on the inside being ostracized like\nwouldn't really affect me very much and\nwe actually see that with people who\nhave like sociopathy or antisocial\npersonality disorder where their\ninability\nto experience things like sadness or\nguilt or stuff like that\ncauses them to oftentimes have trouble\nin terms of interacting with other\npeople which is often which is one of\nthe reasons\nwhy we see a higher amount of antisocial\npersonality disorder in jail\nso if you look at prisoners versus the\nrest of the population what you'll tend\nto find is that prisons have a higher\namount of antisocial personality\ndisorder and why is that it's because\nthey're not controlled by their negative\nemotions they're not restrained by their\nnegative emotions so they end up doing\nworse stuff and our society has decided\nhey if you're going to continue doing\nthis stuff and taking advantage of\npeople hurting people you're gonna\nactually like we're gonna put you in\njail\nso we can see that like negative\nemotions absolutely have\na positive impact\nanother good example of this is the\ngrieving process\nso when i lose a loved one\ni feel really sad\ni don't feel like doing anything\nit hurts\nyou know\nbothers me things like that\nand so what do we do when we feel sad\nand when we grieve we have something\nlike a funeral everyone gets together\nwe share our experience of sadness\nwe all miss these people because we feel\nalone when someone passes away\nand when i get together with a group of\npeople and i say to the rest of the\nworld i'm alone and then someone else is\nlike i'm alone too i miss this person\ntoo\nnot only do we vent that negative\nemotion\nbut then we actually like facilitate\nconnection now that we've lost this\nperson because oh you miss this person i\nmiss this person too let's talk about it\nand what we tend to find is that you\nknow grieving processes funeral\nprocesses\nare conserved throughout humanity\nright so this isn't culturally bound\nit's like in our brains and even i've\nseen like articles and stuff about even\nelephants will grieve right animals will\ngrieve so this is such a basic part of\nlike processing loss\nrecovering that we grieve\nand so the grieving process involves\nessentially venting some amount of\nnegative emotion and then also\nconnecting with other people who\nstruggle with the same things you do\nand it turns out that like almost on a\nbiological level right because animals\ndo it that improves our life in some way\nwe feel better about ourselves but it\nalso improves like\nobjective levels of function\nso y'all will understand this by the way\nif you kind of like if you know people\nwho haven't grieved appropriately right\npeople who get hung up\non the one that got away and can't\ngrieve a relationship and then they're\nstuck in their life\ni used to be captain of the football\nteam\n25 years ago and man i had all the glory\nand now it's like they're so resentful\nand caught up about being captain of the\nfootball team but never doing anything\nbetter that that's what all of their\nidentity and ego is based on\nthey feel stuck in life you can't move\nforward\nand so these basic principles\nof like connecting with other human\nbeings and experiencing sadness and\nventing that that emotion actually\ncauses like improvement\nby the way that's part of the reason we\nhave group coaching because we sort of\nrecognize this right that actually it's\nkind of interesting all you have to do\nis get a group of people together\nhelp them vent their emotions and\nhelp them share common experiences and\nthose experiences will actually get\nbetter\nnow you can improve that process by\nthrowing in\na coach\nwho is a trained facilitator who can\nsort of help people\novercome those things get unstuck\nyou know like not get hung up on the one\nthat got away\nright because it's interesting because\nif i talk about the one that got away\nand you talk about the one that got away\ni start to realize oh man this guy's\nreally stuck\nand then i'm like wait a second i'm\nreally stuck too holy crap i never\nrealized it anyway\nso this is a very conserved thing\nso even sadness depression grief these\nare like very conserved things we've\nevolved to have them\nand so once we start to start to\nexperience some of these things like\nlet's try to understand a little bit\nabout what is the mechanism of\ndepression so when someone gets\ndepressed or when someone gets sad\nhow does that manifest in their mind\nso the first way that we sort of kind of\ncan understand depression is through\nidentity\nand this is what's so tricky about a\ngeneration that gets depressed\nbecause what happens is even if it's a\ngenerational effect even if it's a\nsocietal effect and there are all kinds\nof things happening in society right\nit's harder to find a partner now\nbecause of online dating it's like so\ndifficult\nit was supposed to be easier because of\nonline dating\nbut it's actually gotten harder\nnow people are saying oh if you want to\nfind a partner get off of dating apps\nthen it's like what's the point of a\ndating app if the best way to find a\npartner is to get off of a dating app\nwe're dealing with\nhere's the other thing\nabout what we're dealing with\nyou know these once-in-a-lifetime kind\nof things\nwe've had like four of those in the last\ndecade\n911 was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of\nevent\na global pandemic is a once in a\nlifetime kind of event\nthe subprime mortgage crisis was a\nonce-in-a-lifetime kind of event\nthe current crypto crash is a\nonce-in-a-lifetime kind of event\nit's like how many once-in-a-lifetime\nevents do we need to get bodied by\nbefore like the world kind of chills out\nnow here's the tricky thing about\ndepression\nis that if you get depressed\nyou think it's your fault because that's\nwhat the depression does to you\nright so like if you're alone at home\nand you can't find a job you can't\nafford rent\nbecause of the\ncrazy disparity\nbetween wages and housing prices\nand how that disparity has increased\nastronomically over the last 30 years\nand then like whose fault is that\nwell if you're depressed it's your fault\nbecause a key part of depression is\nsomething called negative self-attitude\nso you feel guilty oh it's my fault\nand we'll see this a lot especially in\nthings like unhealthy relationships\nwhere someone's depressed\nand so we'll kind of see this where like\nyou'll have you know let's say you've\ngot two people who are dating or in a\nrelationship they live together and one\nperson starts to get depressed\nand then they feel responsible for all\nof the problems in the relationship\nbut the problem here is that they're\nonly responsible for half the problems\nin the relationship right your partner\nis contributing\nthe issue is that once you become\ndepressed your mind is happy to take\nresponsibility for all of it\nand now what we have is a generation of\npeople who thinks that\noh the reason i'm living at home with my\nparents and by the way 52 percent of\npeople under the age of 29 still live at\nhome\nwhen you live at home with your parents\nyou think that's pathetic\neven people will tell you that's\npathetic you'll see on online dating\nprofiles you need to have your own place\nwell that knocks out 52 percent of\npeople\nand this is the tricky thing right it's\nlike we don't acknowledge when we're\ndepressed we don't acknowledge that\nthey're actually societal factors that\nare making it this way\nbecause sure 50 years ago if you were 28\nyears old and living at home maybe that\nwas a little bit sus\nbut now it's like more than half\nso does that mean that\nit's my fault that i'm still at home\nbecause the depression will actually\nmake you think that way\nso the first thing to understand is that\ndepression is about identity\nthat's the one of the primary mechanisms\nof it we also know this scientifically\nfor example we have a part of our brain\ncalled the default mode network\nthe default mode network it gives us is\nthe capacity for self-reflection\nand what we tend to find in people who\nare depressed is that the default mode\nnetwork is hyperactive\nand we can't shut it off and what it's\nconstantly doing it produces thoughts\nlike\nthis is my fault it's always thinking\nabout you it's always thinking about me\nit's reflecting about myself so certain\namount of self-reflection is healthy\nright but if i'm in a relationship and\nwe have a fight\na healthy mind will think well what did\nthis person do\nand\nwhat did i do we'll sort of balance that\na very egotistical mind will think only\nabout the other person right so if we\nlopside it towards 100\npercent this person's fault this\nperson's fault this person's fault and\nif you look at a hyperactive default\nmode network\nthat's going to be thinking 100 about\nyou you're only going to be looking at\nwhat you did wrong and you're going to\nbe assuming all of the\nblame so that's one of the primary\nmechanisms\nthrough which\num\ndepression happens\nthe next primary like mechanism that we\nsort of see in depression is cognitive\ndistortions\nso this is where the depressed mind\nstarts to see things in a different way\nso there's no point in trying because\nthere's no way that i'm ever gonna\nget a job no point in applying\nother people may be able to do this but\ni won't be able to\nand the the funniest one\nis if you take a depressed person and\nyou ask them hey you know you have a\nfriend or let's say you talk to someone\nelse\nand they're depressed too even if you're\ndepressed you can encourage them to go\nget therapy you can be like hey you\ndeserve to feel better like i'm so sorry\nthat you're struggling this way\nright like you should go see a therapist\nit would really help\nbut if i asked the depressed person well\nwhat about you should you go see a\ntherapist nah\ni don't deserve it\na therapist\nsomeone else deserves to be helped by\nthat therapist not someone as pathetic\nas me\nthis is all my fault\ni'm wasting someone else's time i'm\ntaking someone else's slot in therapy\nright like so you'll see all these\ndifferent cognitive distortions\nyou'll start to think that you're not\ngoing to be successful\nother people can seek therapy you can't\nseek therapy so this is another big\nmechanism of depression\nthe third reason that people are\ndepressed and we sort of talked a little\nbit about this already is because it's\nactually appropriate given your\ncircumstance\nso our brain has the capacity to like\nmake predictions about our likelihood of\nsuccess\nor make predictions about the future and\nsometimes the future is objectively\nbleak\nand so it's not a malfunction of the\nbrain\nand this is where i'm sort of tossing\naround the word depressed but what i\nsort of mean here this is important i've\nseen this in my office and we talk about\nthis in terms of dr k's guide in what i\ncall congruent depression\nsome therapists will talk about\nexistential depression\nso i don't know that this is like a\nneurochemical imbalance\nbut sometimes the reason that we get\ndepressed is because our life is\ngenuinely crappy\nand it's actually an appropriate\nresponse to our circumstances\nand this is the thing so even as a\nmedical doctor who prescribes medication\nthere's a big assumption\nthat depression is caused by a\nneurochemical imbalance\nbut i don't know how to say this like we\ndon't actually know that\nright that's the prevailing theory but i\nwant you all to just think a little bit\nscientifically\nhow do we diagnose depression\nand even the treatments for depression\nwhat are we actually measuring\nwe're measuring subjective feelings\nwe're using questionnaires in scales and\nclinical assessments\nwe're not doing brain biopsies and\nmeasuring serotonin concentration\nin humans\nright we're not doing things like spinal\ntaps\nto measure serotonin concentration\nthe spine is in the spinal tap wouldn't\neven be successful you really need to do\na brain biopsy\nand look at the\nneuronal space\nthe synaptic cleft and measure serotonin\nconcentration in that we don't do that\nwe've done it some a little bit in\nanimal models the reason that we assume\nthat it's a neurochemical imbalance is\nbecause if we jack up the neurochemicals\npeople seem to get better\nright so if i if i take a medication\nthat increases the serotonin in my brain\nthat appears to help\nbut by the way just so you all are aware\nthere are some kinds of depression like\ndysthymia\nwhich is i think what i would kind of\ncall congruent depression\nwhich is like a more constant state of\ndepression\nthat is not really improved by like\nneurochemicals\nso there's this assumption that it's all\nit's all just a neurochemical imbalance\nthe truth is as scientists and medical\ndoctors we actually don't know that\nand there's also all kinds of other\nthings that are like super simple in a\nsense but it's so complicated people\ndon't even realize it is that we don't\nknow that the neurochemical imbalance\ncame first\nright so there's this interesting\ndivision of\nof medicine that i was studying briefly\nfor a little while back when i was going\nto be an internist called\npsychoneuroimmunology\nand so the interesting thing there is if\ni get a phone call\nthat a loved one of mine is in the\nhospital\nthat's a psychological impact first\nso do you think when i get the phone\ncall suddenly all my neurochemicals get\nmessed up\nno the first thing that happens is\npsychological\ni hear something it has an implication\nfor my mind\nover the course of the next three days i\nstart to feel depressed is there a\nneurochemical change at that point\nprobably\nbut which came first is the root of the\nmalfunction a neurochemical imbalance or\nis the root of the malfunction the mind\nand essentially what research in\npsychoneuroimmunology\nshows us\nis that the root of the problem isn't\nnecessarily in the brain in fact the\nbrain is the mediating step between the\noriginal psychological insult and the\nimmunologic manifestation\nso psychoneuroimmunology looks at for\nexample why stress\nmakes arthritis asthma eczema worse\nstress makes neurochem i mean autoimmune\ndiseases worse\nso even though we talk about\nneurochemical imbalances and even though\nwe treat\nquote-unquote imbalances\nwe're not actually sure that brains are\nimbalanced in terms of neurotransmitters\nall we know is that throwing more\nneurotransmitter in there helps that\nwe're sure about\nbut does that make sense like there's a\nsubtle but very important distinction\nhere\nthe other interesting statistic is that\n60 of people who have depression recover\nwithout any kind of medical intervention\nhow did that happen\nso we see this in our community people\nstart putting their lives together\nand this is the key thing about this\nthird sort of cause of depression is\nthat sometimes it's actually appropriate\nto your life\nright if i get caught cheating in school\nand i get kicked out of school and i've\ngot two and a half years of loans\nbut i'm not going to get a degree i\ndon't know if i'll be able to transfer\nit's like appropriate to be depressed\nthis is not a malfunction of the mind\nand the most shocking things i'll share\na really interesting study\nsomeone was looking at what percentage\nof people who are suicidal\nactually have a mental illness\nand there are a lot of methodological\nproblems with the study so i'm not going\nto like cite it too heavily but\nwhat the shocking thing that they\ndiscovered is that a surprising amount\nof people who were suicidal were not\nactually mentally ill\nthere's some serious methodological\nproblems with the study\nthe biggest of which was they were\nlooking at historic diagnoses which\ndoesn't account for the fact that\na lot of mental illness never gets\nformally diagnosed and people just live\nwith it\nbut sometimes i know it sounds weird as\ni say this as a psychiatrist like the\nway that i can help sometimes people who\nare suicidal is this is important to\nunderstand\nis by not assuming that oh this person\nis suicidal because their brain is\nmalfunctioning\nsometimes that's true\nsometimes someone has everything to live\nfor they're happily married they have\nkids they have a successful career they\ngo on vacations\nand their mind is so cognitively\ndistorted\nand they really do have a almost like an\norganic\nmental illness that is like distorting\ntheir thoughts that i've absolutely seen\nwhere the suicidality is inappropriate\nbut the tricky thing\nthe devastating thing is sometimes the\nsuicidality actually makes a lot of\nsense\nsometimes the people that i've worked\nwith really don't have a reason to wake\nup in the morning\nit's not like their mind can't see all\nof the good things in their life that's\nwhat we really see sometimes with a\ndepressive episode but the really scary\nthing\nis that sometimes people don't genuinely\nhave a reason to wake up in the morning\nnow those people can still be helped i\ndon't think they should kill themselves\nin fact they can be helped quite\nprofoundly\nright just the kind of help is going to\nbe different\nit's about building a life\nthat is worth living\nand how that can absolutely be a\nstruggle but it's not like a pilg is\ngoing to fix that\nand so what are we seeing in society\nwhere depression is getting worse\nwe're somewhat said we started this off\nit was great it's a beautiful question\nthe older generation sees us as weak\nwell like\nif you want to accept if you want to\nsort of attribute that to an individual\nproblem\nyou know there's two options for\ndepression one is that it's an\nindividual problem it's like a\nneurochemical imbalance in your brain\nbut if it's happening to like a whole\ngeneration if we're seeing a three times\na 300 increase if we're seeing the point\nprevalence doubling over the course of\nthree years\ni don't think that that's\non you\ni think what's actually going on is\npeople are appropriately losing hope\nright and it's manifesting in all kinds\nof weird ways\nwe see this in terms of like\nanti-natalism i once had a patient come\ninto my office this is my first exposure\nto this\nwhere they were like i don't know that i\ncan ethically bring children into this\nworld because i don't know if the world\nlike human life will be unsustainable\nover the next hundred years like i don't\nknow if climate change is gonna get so\nbad that we will like it'll actually be\nlike an apocalypse\nand i don't know if i want to bring a\nchild like into this world\nnow do you diagnose that person with an\nanxiety disorder\nright is this like their mind\nmalfunctioning\nor is this like a legitimate concern\nwe also see it in terms of anti-work\nright where we'll we'll sort of see that\npeople are getting like fed up\ni just saw that for example\num\n225 workers\nat a major publishing house or have\nauthorized a strike\nand so the thing is sometimes the future\nis like actually bleak\nand what we tend to find in our society\nis that society is actually changing to\nmake us more depressed\nnot only in terms of\nthe world is looking bleak\nbut also\neven in terms of the identity and the\ncognitive distortions\nso for example part of the reason that\nwe feel so negative about ourselves\nis because technology and the way that\nour society is evolving\nis making us feel more inadequate\nright so a big part of feeling\ninadequate when you feel depressed is\ncomparison\nand it's so easy to compare yourself to\nother people and find yourself wanting\nright our sense of identity we get to\nsee like instagram reality and all these\nother kinds of photoshopping and stuff\nlike that altered beauty standards and\nlike all this kind of stuff and it's\nlike we're also seeing by the way kind\nof interesting\nso body dysmorphic disorder and body\nimage issues are getting worse for\neveryone\nwhat's even more disturbing for that is\nthat historically body image issues have\nbeen\nwomen have been the primary sufferers of\nbody image issues historically\nso if you look at like body dysmorphia\nlike what percentage of women and what\npercentage of men it used to be\npredominantly women\nbut men are catching up\nbecause equality\nso we're seeing an uh an alarming rise\nin body image issues in men\nand\ni think that's you know i'm not saying\ni'm not trying to comment about society\nand society's good or bad or like is\ndiscriminatory against women or whatever\nlike that's not what i'm saying i'm just\nsaying that\nwhen it comes to mental illness like\neveryone's screwed\nso we're seeing all kinds of things\nright because the internet social media\nall of these things make us feel less\nabout ourselves\nand so this is like\nvery very fertile soil for depression to\ngrow in\nwe also see that in terms of cognitive\ndistortions we'll see this a lot and i\nthink our subreddit is actually one of\nthe\nhealthiest places on the internet where\npeople have these kinds of discussions\ni'm not saying it's healthy it's not\nwhere we want it to be\nbecause sometimes it can be quite\nemotionally heavy\nbut i've seen like a lot of i think\nreally productive posts that i haven't\nseen anywhere else on the internet\nso i saw a post the other day where a\nwoman was sort of saying like i have a\nlot of like\nemotional hatred towards men\nand i recognize that this is unhealthy\nbut i don't know what to do about it\nand then we'll also see like other\ngender variations right so it's not just\nwomen hating men we'll have men posting\non our subreddit where they'll sort of\nsay like i have a lot of unhealthy\nattitudes towards women\nor i have these attitudes like i think\nthey're unhealthy i just don't know how\nto change them and that's really awesome\nthat people are having that discussion\nbecause in most places on the internet\nwhat we actually have is reinforcing of\ncognitive distortions\nthe covid vaccine is going to inject 5g\nnetworks into my like what\nthat's not even physically pot like what\nso the cognitive like what the internet\ndoes is it takes a cognitive distortion\nfrom depression\nand transforms it into a delusion\nwhen we reinforce cognitive distortions\ntime and time and time again and when\nyou have a group of people\nwho all share a cognitive distortion\nit like rises to the level of like\ndelusional\ni'm not saying clinically right so i\ndon't i haven't evaluated any of these\npeople for delusional disorder but it\nbecomes this like oh a better idea than\nthat is like these sort of mass mental\nillness kind of outbreaks we've sort of\nseen that where it's almost like a mass\npsychosis there are some interesting\npapers about that the point is that our\ncurrent society takes these core aspects\nof depression like identity and\ncognitive distortion and amplifies them\nand then the last thing\nis\nthat actually like i know it's\nterrifying but part of the reason that\npeople are depressed now\ni i think you can't blame the individual\nif everyone is feeling this way\nand is everyone feeling that way no like\nhalf of us are pretty lucky and aren't\nthat depressed\nbut half of society is basically\ndepressed now\na little bit less 40\nover the course of one year\nand that's terrifying\nso what do you do about this\nso this is one of the situations where\nas much as i'm a fan of coaching\ni think the right thing to do is\nactually go see a medical professional\nso this is where we don't know right so\nif you're struggling with these kinds of\nfeelings you don't know whether this is\na neurochemical imbalance type\nor this is a congruent depression type\nwhere the world is actually going to\nhelp\nand that's why you're upset\nwe don't know\nand so the most dangerous thing that you\ncan assume is that it's one versus the\nother\nso that's why what you should really\nstart with is getting a mental health\nevaluation i'm not saying to treatment\ni'm saying just get evaluated\nhave an expert who knows how to tell the\ndifference sit down and try to help you\nbecause the good news is that about a\nthird of people who start things like\nantidepressant medication their life\ncompletely transforms\nand if you're in that that third\nand this is what's really interesting is\nwhen i talk to patients some people\nconsider that to be lucky and some\npeople consider that to be unlucky\nso if i'm medication if i'm a high\nmedication responder does that mean i'm\nlucky or unlucky they think that oh this\nmeans i'll develop a tolerance on the\nmedication i'll become dependent on it i\ndon't want to be dependent on it but on\nthe flip side it's like you can actually\ntake a pill every day for about a year\nand your life will be like so much\neasier\nand then you can get off the medication\nyou can you know there's a lot of\nevidence that shows that people have\nsingle depressive episodes that are\nmedication responsive for example and\nthen you can pull people off of\nmedication they'll actually be okay\nso you should start by getting evaluated\nsecond thing to consider and this is\nreally important\nis when it comes to your depression\nyou should only take as much\nresponsibility\nas is truly yours\nso we see this when the mind is sad\nright when the mind sort of when the\ndefault mode network is hyperactive\nwe're not talking about necessarily like\nthis is a major depressive disorder or\nbipolar disorder depressive episode\nwe're just talking about general aspects\nright more from an evolutionary\nstandpoint\nwe tend to accept responsibility for a\nlot of things that are not our fault\nand so now like not only is the economy\nin such a way where you're forced to\nlive at home remember 52 of people\nbetween the ages of 18 and 29 live at\nhome\nand each and every one of those 52\npeople out of 100 is thinking that\nthey're pathetic\nthey're thinking oh my god i'm so\npathetic\nand they beat themselves up\nand so then something tricky happens\nbecause you're starting to accept\nresponsibility for things that are out\nof your control and that is when you're\ndoomed\nbecause now you're accepting\nresponsibility for something that you\ncan't actually change\nand it feeds your depression right\ninstead of being compassionate towards\nyourself you start to beat yourself up\nso oddly enough and this is what's so\nweird is everyone is talking about\ntaking personal responsibility right\nlike it's healthy to take personal\nresponsibility even we advocate for\nliving your dharma\ntake responsibility for your life\npart of the problem in the world today\nis people are taking too much\nresponsibility\nand we're taking it away from the people\nwho are actually responsible\nmy favorite is when i see a major you\nknow oil company\ntalk about\ntweeting out about what are you gonna do\nfor the environment\nit's like my pledge is i'm not gonna\nspill five million barrels of oil into\nthe ocean that's what i'm gonna do for\nthe environment\nright it's like\nwhat's going on here\nand i'm not saying that all oil\ncompanies are evil\ni think fossil fuels are a useful\ntool for human society\nbut let's just be clear about\nwhat percentage of the problem when you\ntweet out at the general public about\nwhat they're gonna do for something what\npercentage of the problem are you\nactually responsible for\nand so oddly enough i think actually\npart of the problem right now is that\nindividuals are accepting too much\nresponsibility for societal problems\nand we see this when it comes to\ndepression and i see it a ton\ni see tons of people who are blaming\nthemselves\nfor being unable to find a partner when\nthe system is rigged\nyou spend more and more time on dating\napps dating apps i don't know that\ndating apps the primary outcome that\ndating apps are designed for is finding\na partner\ni i don't know that i'm not saying\nthey're not maybe they are and i'm just\nignorant of it right so if you're like\nthe ceo of like a dating app\nand you say oh dr k is wrong no that's\nabsolutely what we do and we do it very\nsuccessfully here's the data then i'll\nbe the first to say okay my bad i\nhaven't actually reviewed the data\nbut from my perspective what i've seen\nis that it doesn't seem to be working\nthe way it's supposed to\nso much crap in the world isn't working\nthe way it's supposed to\nand the problem is as we get depressed\nwe take responsibility for that\nwe start to think it's a personal\nshortcoming\nand the interesting thing is as you\nstart to take more responsibility\nfor something that's not yours\nwhat does it do to the person on the\nother side of the table\nwhen everything in the relationship\nbecomes my fault\nwhat does my partner start doing\nwell actually they just continue doing\nwhat they're doing they don't actually\nchange they don't contribute to it\nas i accept full responsibility for\neverything\nthe other side of the equation is just\ngoing to even that out right so another\nlike simple example is is i was looking\nat someone who's frustrated because\nso if i wake up my partner every day to\nmake sure they're on time and then one\nday i stop waking them up and they're\nlate and they get mad at me whose fault\nis that\nam i responsible for waking up my\npartner on time or is that their\nresponsibility and then this is where\neveryone's like oh it's like it's their\nresponsibility like you didn't do\nanything wrong well hold on a second\nbecause why did it happen that way it's\nbecause for a long time i did accept\nresponsibility for the last three years\ni wake them up three times before they\nactually get out of bed\nso even if it's not my responsibility\ni've definitely contributed to the\nsituation\nright this wouldn't be this way unless\nmy actions were what they were\nso the key thing that really needs to\nstart happening for this generation\nis to accept responsibility for only\nwhat you are responsible for\nin paradoxically accept less\nresponsibility don't give other people a\npass for bad behavior\nand this is what's so fascinating about\nyou know like these\ndependent narcissistic relationships\nwhere one person\nis happy to take none of the blame and\nthe other person is happy to take all\nthe blame\nso in a sense it's a match made in\nheaven\nand this is where i think there's a lot\nof practical stuff right so you may say\nlike okay but like i can't change\nsociety\nwell this is where like someone's asking\nthe question how do you know what you're\nresponsible for so you're responsible\nfor a small change in society but that's\nall you're responsible for\nright so if you exercise some amount of\npolitical power you can vote\nright you can vote for things and this\nis where you may think oh like it\ndoesn't matter if i vote like the world\nlike the world is too corrupt\nyeah the reason the world is that way is\nbecause they've tricked you into\nthinking that you don't have any power\nand the moment that you surrender your\npower because you don't think you have\nany is like the moment they've won\nno snowflake thinks it's responsible for\nthe avalanche\nbut we've seen how individual people\ntaking small actions and then other\npeople piling on can actually affect\nreal change\nso the metoo movement is a good example\nof this\nright where people were like hey by the\nway\nand prior to the me too movement\nwhat was going on well people like\ndidn't think\nthat they had any power\nthey're like if i say anything no one's\ngoing to listen\nand so what should you do for if society\nis going in the wrong direction exercise\nwhatever power you do have\nand so\nthis is\nreally important\nthat you stop accepting responsibility\nfor what you are not responsible for\nand exercise whatever power you do have\nand at the end of the day the key thing\nhere is that as you accept less\nresponsibility hopefully you blame\nyourself less you can start to be more\ncompassionate towards yourself and then\nhopefully that'll help\nso it's you know it's a good question\nabout\nis the current generation weaker\nbut my sense is that if something is\nhappening on a societal scale it's not\nthe individual's fault quote-unquote we\neach have an individual contribution\nthey're each things that we're\nindividually responsible for but at the\nend of the day it's like\nwe have to recognize that\nthe problems that we face today are not\nall going to be solved in an office with\na therapist\nnow should we start there absolutely\ni'm i'm streaming sweetie can you wash\nyour hands somewhere else\nokay you can wash your hands here\nokay\nso we didn't do our disclaimer today so\nbefore i go further i'll just sort of\nsay just a reminder that everything we\ndiscuss on stream today is intended to\nbe for educational purposes only\nnothing is intended to be taken as\nmedical advice and if you all have a\nconcern or question just like we talked\nabout one of the first things that you\nshould actually do is go see a mental\nhealth professional\nright if you're concerned about whether\nthis is depression or not depression\nthe whole point is that you're not\ntrained to know\nand that's why we highly highly\nrecommend that y'all go actually seek\nmedical care can you close the door\nsweetie what is he doing here i told you\ncan you close the door though\nchildren what you gonna do\nthere is hope in the world\nall right so questions\nso a couple of things someone's asking\ncould you lecture about dysthymia\nso we could lecture about dysthymia sort\nof\nthe thing is half of dr k's guide to\ndepression is\noverlapped significantly with\na lot of the stuff that i would talk\nabout in dysthymia\nso what i talk about there is is what i\ncall congruent depression now it's not\nclear whether that's actually that's not\nnecessarily dysthymia\nbut when i think about\npersistent depression which is what kind\nof dysthymia is that tends to be\nunresponsive to medications in my\nexperience as a clinician that's where\nlike putting your life together seems to\nbe the most effective\nquote-unquote treatment\nso\nyou know it's kind of like it's it's a\nweird there's a lot of nuance there\nbut i think that a lot of people who\nexperience\nsadness let's say or hopelessness in\nlife\nmay not be clinically depressed or even\nclinically diagnosable with dysthymia\nand that's where\na lot of like what we struggle with\nright so as we look at these\nevolutionary perspectives on depression\nlike why does the human mind get sad\nis it\nan illness which is essentially a\nmalfunction of what we're supposed to be\ndoing\nor is it actually like\nappropriate given our circumstances and\nwhat really terrified me as a\npsychiatrist is the more that i actually\ngot to like spend time with people the\nmore i discovered that i don't think\nthis is actually a malfunction\ni think this person has every reason to\nbe depressed and suicidal\nand the more that you begin to realize\nthat this person\ntheir their experience is valid right so\nwe understand this is a society even\npsychiatrist therapists are trained to\nbe validating\nbut what i sort of found is that this is\nlike way bigger than just validating\nsomeone's emotions\nthat this person really doesn't have a\nlife where like that's like there's no\nhope for them in the future\nand so does that mean they should kill\nthemselves absolutely not it just means\nthat the focus should be different\nit's sort of like\nin depression in in a clinical\ndepression\ni view the instrument that is making the\njudgments as busted\nso the measurements are fundamentally\nflawed because your instrument is not\ncalibrated\nbut sometimes what happens is your\ninstrument is perfectly calibrated\nit's just the measurements it makes are\nvery very bleak because that's actually\nwhat they are\nand that's the key thing to understand\nand the reason that people are getting\nmore depressed today\nis not i don't think that everyone's\nmeasurement instruments are\nmiscalibrated i think actually what\nwe're seeing is that people are\naccurately measuring a hopeless future\nnow that doesn't mean that it's going to\nremain hopeless it doesn't mean that we\nshould give up hope it just means that\nthe way that we need to fix that problem\nis going to be different because\ncalibrating the instrument like for\nexample starting someone on an ssri if\nthey have existential depression even\nstudies show that that's actually not\ngoing to be effective because the\ninstrument's working fine\nit's actually building a life\nit's actually paradoxically accepting\nresponsibility for only what you control\nsomeone is a cyrosite is saying this\nreally well not hopeless but bleak\nthat's a great example\na great great way to put it\nbecause the future may be bleak but i\nfor one believe that a bleak future can\nbe altered\nright like you can fix that\nit just takes effort and the problem is\nwhen we start to get depressed and we\nstart to blame ourselves for everything\nwe take that responsibility\naway from some of the people who are\nactually responsible\nand in doing so we create a standard for\nourselves that we can never fix\nbecause if i'm in an abusive\nrelationship\nand i accept responsibility for the\nother person's behavior oh it's not that\nperson's fault they just had a rough day\ntoday\nthe moment that i accept responsibility\nfor their behavior is the moment that i\nhave\nlocked in\nthat bleak future\nbecause it really needs to be fixed by\nthem\nbut not holding them accountable is\ngonna do me\nso for what it's worth schema safe as\nasking future looks bright in some\naspects i think future looks bright in\nmany aspects\ni think future\nlooks very bright\nso let me give you all just a couple of\nthings that makes me hopeful\nso even in terms of stuff like climate\nchange like oh my god are we gonna like\ndestroy the universe or the world and\nmake it uninhabitable\nso first of all we're already moving\nmore towards like renewables and stuff\nright so like electric cars are the fad\nlike solar panels like people putting\nsolar panels on things like things are\nmoving in the right direction\nthe other thing is i recently saw this\narticle where\nscientists at mit came up with some kind\nof space bubble\nthat would like cool the earth by a\ncouple of degrees like so human\ningenuity is amazing\ncan you all think like 20 years ago we\ndidn't have smartphones\nthere was no internet on your phone\ndidn't exist\nso i have a lot of faith in human\ningenuity\ni also have a lot of faith in\na lot of things like actually like\nthings like twitch and youtube\nso we have\nhow can i say this\ni feel like we're at end game content\nin the world\nso are the problems we face\nhard yes are things potentially\ncatastrophic absolutely but we also have\ntools at our disposal that are like\nwe've never had before\nso we have things like the internet\nwhere uh literally i was sitting in my\noffice\nlike four years ago when i was thinking\nabout starting healthy gamer and i was\nlike oh my god there are so many people\nout there that need help\nand if this was a hundred and forty\nyears ago that's where things would have\nended\nbut it's like now i can hop on twitch\nand i can talk to\n3195 people at the same time\nthat's wild\nlike if one person\ncan help three hundred three thousand\none hundred and ninety five let's even\nassume that half of y'all or afk and\nthis doesn't even apply to you and you\ndon't get help let's cut it in half hell\nlet's cut it by by two two-thirds\nso let's say a thousand people\ngot helped this hour let's be\nconservative right because like most of\ny'all i can't really help you because\nyeah\nbut that still means in one hour of my\nday i can help a thousand people\nand if there were 10 people helping a\nthousand people then we'd help 10 000\npeople\nso in 10 hours if you're able to help 10\n000 people that's wild\ndoes the world need a whole lot of help\nabsolutely\nand what's really cool is that we have\nthis thing called the internet\nand this is the other wild thing so it's\nlike sometimes on a youtube video we'll\nget like let's say a hundred thousand\nviews\nso we live in a world where like you\ndon't even need to be awake right now\nand you can still get helped by this\nlike that's pretty neat\nso i feel like we're sort of at end game\ncontent where the bosses are harder\nbut our gear is like pretty freaking\nsweet\nso i'm actually pretty hopeful\nyou know the sun is shining today\ni'm in the middle of work and i got to\nsee my kid for a minute like that was\npretty cool was it annoying that she\nkind of like came in here sure was it\ndisruptive\nyes\nbut it was also like nice\nright\nlike the pandemic was bad for a lot of\ndifferent reasons but there was also\nlike all kinds of silver linings that\nare coming out of it\nand one thing that i think the pandemic\ndid is it exposed the weaknesses in our\nsystem\nexposed the structural deficiencies\nit made us realize that men could here's\nthe thing i don't i don't know if you'll\nrealize this but mental health was\ngetting worse and worse and worse for\nyears before the pandemic back in like\n2010 or 2012\nmental illness surpassed cancer and\ncardiovascular disease\nin terms of mortality and morbidity\nacross\nthe us at least and i think the world\nso this has been going on for decades\nthe pandemic made everyone realize it\nthree years ago i went to the american\npsychiatric association i said hey i\nthink we need to start focusing on video\ngame and technology addiction\nand their answer at that point was\nsorry we're too busy with the opioid\nepidemic\ni was like okay cool\nthis year a couple months ago i go to\nthe national meeting of the american\npsychiatric association there are four\npresentations\nabout video game addiction\nso we may be like a little bit slow to\nthe party but like things are actually\nlooking up i'm actually very optimistic\nthe problem is that when we live in a\nworld where the most negative content\nrises to the top\nit's like there's a war in ukraine and\nwe're gonna like that's gonna be all of\nour news feed for a couple of weeks\nuntil the next thing happens and then\nthat's going to be our news feed for a\ncouple weeks and then the next thing\nhappens\nbecause the brain has a bias towards\nnegative emotion over positive emotion\nso all of these entertainment websites i\nmean not entertainment websites news\nwebsites\nwhat do people click on the stuff that\nscares them the most\nand if we click on something that scares\nme and then the news organization\nfigures that out\nthey're gonna put scary stuff after\nscary stuff after scary stuff\nand what happens is our mind gets bored\nof being afraid we build a tolerance to\nfear that's also adaptive\nright because like once i see a tiger\nfootprint and then i'm running away like\nfor the first couple hours i want to be\nscared but then i want that fear to calm\ndown\nand so then what they do is they find\nsomething else something else for our\nmind to be afraid of\nso there's like all this artificial\nor not artificial i'd call it inflated\nbleakness\nin our society and that's part of the\nreason we're all depressed\nor things bleak sure but they're not as\nbleak as we think\nright if i go to if i go to like r slash\ndating dating advice boy is it a bleak\nplace\nbecause the people in happy healthy\nrelationships aren't hanging out there\nso there's such a huge selection bias\nright\nthere's a selection bias in our news\nand what's the selection bias in our\nnews it's a competition to get the most\neyes on your things that you make\nadvertising revenue this is why we have\nclick bait and we play this game too\nwe've had people criticize us your our\nyour titles are too clickbaity\nand it's like so then we've got a\nquestion okay like thank you for sharing\nthat and we definitely do consider that\nkind of stuff right\nand i don't know if you all know have\nnoticed but we've started to be less\nclickbaity\nbut then it's like okay we've got an\noption\nwe can upload stuff on youtube and we\ncan have people watch it or not watch it\nwhich one is more important\nright so we\nwe appreciate all the feedback honestly\nlike a lot of people will give feedback\nand like it's good\nlike we'll read all of it so often times\nwhen people give feedback they don't\nunderstand all the pieces of the puzzle\nbut we appreciate it right so we're here\nto try to do a better job for you\nyou"
