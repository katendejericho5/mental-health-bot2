    "transcript": "because for seven years they haven't had\naccess to that and then they go to this\nnew place where suddenly like i can eat\nwhatever i want to like what's the catch\nlike how are you trying to trick me is\nthis a scam in some way you're just\nsaying that today but of course you're\ngonna take it away hello hello\ni'm a little bit nervous but um you can\ncall me yela yella\nyeah\nwelcome\ni'm just\nscrolling again\nthe prompt was um what do you want to\nwork on in yourself the most\nand\nmy answer was\ni want to be less dependent on others\nand lose the always present feeling that\nfriends could backstab or abandon me\ni want to figure out what matters to me\nand be content without the approval of\nmy friends\ni want to be able to help myself like i\nhelp my friends\nso okay so you want to be less dependent\non other people\nyou want to be able to help yourself\nlike you help your friends and you said\nsomething after being less dependent\nsomething about\nconstantly thinking about something\nyeah thinking about that people um could\nabandon me like\nhelp me understand that a little bit\nthat sounds like uh\nhow can i say this\nit sounds very\nstressful to have friends that your mind\nis constantly thinking that way\nyeah it is\ni think it just roots a lot in\ninsecurities and\na lot of the time i don't have many\nfriends but\n[Music]\njust if\npeople\ndon't\nuh takes me back uh\nlike\na few days or um\njust if there's a\nuh\nif\nit's not uh\nlike there isn't a balance between the\namount of communication between each\nother\ni\nsometimes just get the feeling that\ni did something wrong or\npeople don't want to\nhang out with me\na lot more and\nyeah it's just\nalways\nit stresses me out a lot that\nbecause i have so few friends that\nmaybe i\ncan lose them as well so\nokay so what i'm hearing yella is is\nthat first of all\nit sounds like you can't afford to lose\nmany friends\nright so yeah\neach one becomes more and more important\nyeah\nthe second thing that i'm noticing is\nthat\nif there's ever\na question mark\nabout a relationship like let's say you\ntext your friend and your friend doesn't\ntext you back in two or three days\nthat even though there are a lot of\nreasons why your friend may not text you\nback\nthat your mind tends to think about some\nreally scary stuff\nexactly and mostly scary stuff about\nthings that put me down\ncan you can you give me an example of\nwhat kind of thoughts your mind has\num\njust a simple example like um if i if i\nmeet with another person and i'm always\nafter i meet with another person i feel\nreally attached to them and\num\nthe next day i text a lot and if\nthey for some reason\ndon't have time on the next day and\ni\nthink that\nmaybe i said something wrong or\nthat\nit just wasn't fun when we hang out the\nday before and um\nyeah\nokay\nand\nwhat would you\nso\nwhat would you like to change if your\nlife was different if i could give you a\nmagic wand\nand you could change yourself into\nsomething else what would you change\nyourself into\nhonestly it's just\nit's just\ni think it's just my mind that makes a\nlot of these\n[Music]\nassumptions and\nthat i\nreally know\n[Music]\nthat those aren't really what's\nhappening but they're really um\num yeah taking\nup a lot of my energy and um stressing\nme out and\ni just\nwant to live without them okay\nso i i'd love to try to help you with\nthat today yela and i think i can but\ni'm gonna ask a couple other questions\nfirst is that okay\nyeah um so can you also tell me yellow\nballpark how old are you\ni'm 33. okay\nso\ndo you have a sense of\nwhere this fear that your friends are\ngoing to abandon or backstab you comes\nfrom\num i have some i'm not sure i think\none\none\nreason is that\num\nof course there were situations in the\npast\nwhere\nsomething like this happens and also\ni\nfor my part abandoned\na lot of my friends just because\nat one point i wasn't\nhappy with\num\nit was just a lot of friends going out\npartying and i\nwasn't able to control it and needed to\nreally um take a\nstep back from that\nfriend group and\nanother time when i really\n[Music]\nhad a\n[Music]\nlike a depressive episode and i\nreally couldn't\nbecame really\nalone didn't leave my house and\nthat\nthat's when i really um\nlike abandoned\nall of my friends that were left\nyeah okay\nand\nokay so it does sound like you've had a\ncouple of very real experiences where\nrelationships that were important to you\nfell apart in some way\nyeah\nand let me ask you when you let's say\nyou meet someone and as you said you\nfeel attached and then you text them a\nlot the next day or message them a lot\nthe next day\nwhat happens after that\ni don't have really\njust because\ni really just\njust now am really getting back into um\nsocializing i don't have\nthat much experiences okay\nso um\nso when you say you get attached to\nsomeone what does that mean\nlike i just want to\nhang out a lot with them\nand um yeah great thank you so let me\nask you one or two questions so what\nabout that makes you want to hang out\nwith them what how do you feel when\nyou're with them that makes you want\nmore\num just the feelings that i have when\ni'm alone that people will abandon me\nare not there because they're right in\nfront of me and uh\ni can see that they're with me they're\nhaving fun with me and\num i don't have to stress about uh\nif they really um\nwant to\nspend time with me because they're\nspending time with me i see so what i'm\nalmost hearing is is that\nthere's almost a constant\nvoice\nof doubt\nin your mind\nthat people don't want to spend time\nwith you you may not have friends they\nthey'd rather have fun with someone else\nand when you actually spend time with\npeople that voice actually quiets down\nbecause you get a lot of\nfeedback\nfrom your eyes from your ears that okay\nthis person is having a good time we are\nhaving fun\nso like that part of you the the fear of\nabandonment quiets down when you're\nactually with someone\nyeah\nsure sometimes when i'm out with\nsomething\nthere's also some small little little\nthoughts that i think are they're having\nfun right now is this really\na good time right now but\nit's not\nso severe as when i'm alone and don't\nhave\nconstant feedback\nokay\nyela anything else you want to mention\num\nyou know i i i was going to share some\nthoughts with you but i just wanted to\nmake sure that we covered what you\nwanted to share\nno okay no i'm good so\ni do think that this can be managed but\ni think it's going to be hard\nso i think the basic problem is that\nyour solution is actually creating your\nproblem\nokay so i'll explain what that means\nso you have this fear of abandonment\nand when you spend time with someone\nand they\nand that fear\nand you feel better\nwhat do you think that's actually doing\nto the fear of abandonment\ndo you the more time you spend with them\ndo you feel reassured\nyeah but also\ni i don't know how to put this but uh\num\nyou you said earlier that um\ni have the feeling that i ca i can't\nafford to lose a friend and if i spend\nmore time with somebody they get like\nmore valuable to me because what\nyep we'll get to that in a second but\nwhat i want to kind of point out so i'm\ngoing to share with you a story this is\na story if you've watched dr k's guide\nyou may have heard this before\nso when we have anxiety\nthere are certain things that we can do\nthat will decrease our anxiety over time\nor certain things that we can do that\nwill calm down our anxiety but will\nactually increase it over time\nso i'll give you an example\nso i have a family member who's very\nvery anxious\nabout\ntheir kids safety\nand so what they do is if if the kid\nisn't home at 8 pm\nthey'll start messaging their child hey\nare you okay is everything okay i'm\nworried about you you said you were\ngoing to be home at 8. it's now 803 and\nyou're not home where are you\nyou need to pick up the phone\nand until the child picks up the phone\nthe parent is very very anxious\nand when the child picks up the phone\nand the child says no no i'm fine i just\nstopped to get gas i'm five minutes away\nthe next day\nthe parent when the child is five\nminutes late again that day the child\nthe parent isn't confident their anxiety\nactually comes right back\ndoes that make sense\nno i didn't question okay\nso so this is where\nall right let me give you another\nexample\nso this is the one from dr case guide\nso i was once working with someone who\nwas afraid that their\ntheir boyfriend or fiance was cheating\non them\nso what they did is they were like okay\nlike i have no reason to believe this\nbut they had been cheated on in the past\nso they were concerned that their fiance\nwas cheating on them and so eventually\nwhat they did is they checked their\nfiance's phone without their knowledge\nthey opened up their phone checked their\ntext messages and found that nothing was\ngoing on that was like\nthere's no cheating going on no\nyou know naked pictures or anything like\nthat\nand so they felt better for a couple of\ndays but then the thoughts came back\nand then they checked the phone again\nand once again they didn't see any\nevidence of cheating\nbut the more time they went on the more\nthey found that they like started\nchecking their phone every single day\ndoes that make sense\nyeah so i\ni\nthat i get the urge to increase the\nfrequency uh when i see some other\npeople\nyep so so there's an interesting thing\nthat happens with anxiety where\nsometimes giving in to the anxiety\nactually makes it grow\nand the way that we give into it is by\nactually like\nyou know reassuring it in some way so if\nyou're terrified that people don't like\nyou\nand you spend time with them what you're\nactually doing is feeding that anxiety\nbecause you're telling the anxiety ccc\nlook all like if you're worried about it\nlet me go spend time with someone and\nthen you'll see\nbut then the anxiety never\nbecomes confident it just needs that\nconstant external reassurance\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\ni need to be able to\nreassure myself without\nseeing them\nabsolutely\nright\nand this is the tricky thing because\nwhen you go and spend time with someone\nhalf of your mind is still thinking\nabout the anxiety it's satisfied\nbut it's not spending time with the\nperson\nright you're thinking about what the\nperson thinks you're thinking about oh\nthank god i'm not abandoned\nthank god\nthat this person likes me and enjoys\nspending time with me but you're still\nthinking about the anxiety does that\nmake sense\nyeah to an extent um like i'm still\nhaving a good time most of the time yep\nyou're also having a good time but still\na part of your mind it's not like you're\nall having a good time a part of your\nmind is thinking about oh good this the\nfact that i'm having a good time means i\ndon't need to be worried\nyeah\nbut the problem is that even when you do\nthat we sort of see that pattern is that\nyou get attached to them right why do\nyou get attached to them after one day\nit's because they fulfill your need in\nterms of that anxiety\nso you're not even getting attached to a\nhuman\nyou're getting attached to a source\nof soothing for your anxiety\ndoes that make sense\nyes\nand then the next day goes around and\nwhat do you do you start messaging them\na lot because you need your fix again\nright you almost become addicted\nto that relationship and the reason you\nget addicted why do we form addictions\nbecause they make our negative feelings\ngo away\nyeah\nright does that you following me\nyes\nso there are a couple things\nany questions so far\nno okay\ngo ahead so next thing is that well\nfirst thing that i want you to do is the\nnext day\nyou need to really recognize what\nbehaviors\nare coming from your anxiety\nwhether they're good or bad or whatever\nyou need to recognize okay imagine that\nyou have this hungry beast inside you\nwhich is your fear of abandonment and\nwhen you send that first message where\nis that message coming from\nis it coming from you or is it coming\nfrom the hungry beast\nbecause chance\nor if you're sending\na bunch of messages the next day because\nyou want to hang out again i think\nthat's going to be coming from the\nhungry beast and the tricky thing is\nthat\nthat may drive people away\nyeah for sure yeah\nand then what happens once you drive\nsomeone away by texting them too much\nthe hungry beast gets even hungrier and\nnow it says oh my god another person has\nabandoned you yella\nwe can't have have that happen again and\nthe next time you go out and you meet\nsomeone new the hungry beast is saying\ndon't screw it up don't screw it up\ndon't screw it up or they won't abandon\nyou or they they'll abandon you again\nand so then you listen to that you're\nlike okay i promise i'm not gonna screw\nit up i'm gonna be nice i'm gonna be fun\nwe're gonna have a great time\nsee i'm making them laugh see they like\nme it's okay they're not gonna abandon\nme hungry beast\nand then the hungry beast is like okay\nand then the next day comes around the\nhungry beast is like message them\nif they had such a good time they'll see\nyou again i'm tired of feeling this way\nand the one thing that can make this\nfeeling go away is if when you spend\ntime with them\nso then the tricky thing happens\nwhen a relationship\nbecomes about meeting your emotional\nneeds\nthat's when the other person no longer\nexists in the relationship\nbecause now the reason that you're\ntexting them is because you're tired of\nfeeling alone\nand now you're placing the burden the\nemotional burden of your loneliness\non this person\nyeah of course\ni\nsometimes i really feel like i'm very\nselfish because\n[Music]\nwhen i tell others how i feel it's just\nlike\ni'm voicing my needs my\nthings that i need and\neven like both\nmostly\ni don't know what i was saying no no\nyeah it's a good point so so this is the\nthing so\nit is being selfish but here's the key\nthing in a good relationship you're\nallowed to be selfish\nyou're allowed to be selfish 50 of the\ntime\nthe other 50 of the time\nit's your job to be selfless\nyeah right so i don't blame you for\nwanting\nlike you have those emotional needs it's\njust you need to be a little bit careful\nabout\nletting them dictate your interactions\nwith other people\nso i know it sounds very like so some\nconcrete advice one is it's okay for you\nto hang out with someone but the next\nday you know i would not send them a\nbunch of messages\nyeah like i i i\nrecognize the next day problem already\nand\nlike\nsometimes i try to just\nnot text them but as soon as they text\nme um it's like\ni text them\nlike\nfive things at once and uh\nit's like okay now they've texted me now\ni can uh now i have a free pass to text\nthem how much i want\nexactly so that's all the stuff in your\nhead right so now the hungry beast has\nlearned if we text them first\nthey may abandon us\nbut the second they text us it's like\nokay like um\ngive it to me give it to me give it to\nme give it to me\nyeah right and so so yeah and the reason\nwe're getting this far yella by the way\nis because you like it's clear to me\nthat you've figured a lot of this stuff\nout right you even told me without me\neven asking yeah then i feel like i have\nto text them the next day and i text\nthem too much\nso now what you've got to do is like\ntake it one step further and i think the\nkey thing is that\npay attention to that need within you\nand try to figure out okay like now i\ncan text them what's telling me that i\nneed to text them even if you can that's\nfine but where is that need coming from\nit's coming from like this part of me\nthat feels incredibly alone\nand then i i love what you said is that\ni wish i could be\nfor myself what i can be for other\npeople you said something like that\nright i can i wish i could help myself\nthe way that i help other people\nyeah\nand so what would you tell a friend who\nwas in your situation\nthe first thing would be probably like\ndon't worry that much but um\nthat also\ni don't know it uh\ninvalidates my my feelings and emotions\nso i'm not sure if that's the right\nthing to say but\nyeah yeah so so\na good point so let's we can help you a\nlittle bit concretely there so this is\nwhat i'd say to you and you should say\nthis to yourself that\ni understand why you feel so afraid\nand\njust because you feel afraid doesn't\nactually make it real\nright so if i've been bitten by a dog\nand i see a dog the next day and i get\nscared\nmy fear is completely valid\neven though the dog is not dangerous\nso so this is where you don't want to\ninvalidate your perspective but you also\ndon't want to live your life wholly\nbased on that perspective\nso what i would really do is have a\nconversation with yourself and say okay\nhow are we going to navigate this\nbecause on the one hand\ni completely understand why you're\nterrified because after all you're me\non the other hand\nif we live our life\nbeing controlled by this feeling i don't\nthink we're gonna create the healthy\nrelationships that we really want\nso what can we do in terms of texting\nlike i don't think we should send them\nsix different texts\nwhat would you really want to send them\nwhat do you really feel like you want to\nlike because it sounds like maybe\ngetting together with them is really\nuseful like you really enjoyed that so\nmaybe we can send them one or two texts\none about how we had a lot of fun\nyesterday and the second one about hey\nmaybe we can get together sometime soon\nhow does that sound\nyeah\nright so it's kind of weird but like you\nalmost want to have a conversation with\nyourself\nwhere you're not stupid you're not crazy\nthe fear of abandonment is absolutely\nthere for a reason\nand also we don't want our life to be\ndictated by that fear\nbecause the problem is when the fear of\nabandonment\ncontrols our behavior we actually end up\ndriving a lot of people away\nyeah and it's just not driving people\naway\nat the moment i'm really\n[Music]\ni i have fear of uh getting to know new\npeople because\nthey would just stress me out more\nbecause it's another person that i want\nto keep\nor\nmost of them i want to keep in my life\nand\ni have to\nstruggle uh with myself\nthat\ni keep them um yeah yep and that's\nreally dangerous right because because i\nmean i think some of this is maybe a\ntranslation issue but\nyou know when you use the word keep\nit there's a certain possessiveness to\nthat\nright and what i'd love for you to be\nable to do one day yela is recognize\nthat you bring value to any relationship\nand also\nthat that that may not be the value that\nsome people are looking for which is\nactually okay\njust because someone doesn't want to\nspend time with you doesn't mean that\nyou aren't worth spending time with\nyeah that makes sense\nbut it can be hard for that to sink in\nwhen that really sinks in you'll be\ncompletely better but it'll take time to\nget there\nyeah for sure\nespecially if you have like a\nnearly to no friends you wanna\nyou're glad for everyone that spends\ntime with you and um shows interest in\nyou and um\nyeah\nyeah and that's that's where the\nattachment kind of comes in because i\nthink all this gets\nyou know\nif you're if you're thirsty and in the\ndesert\nand there's you finally find water\nyou're going to be very possessive of\nthat water\nand so i think the challenge that you\nface is that you genuinely have a need\nwhich is so severe\nthat\nyou're not going to want to let any\nopportunity for getting that need met\nyou don't want to let it go\nand that creates problems can i share a\nstory with you yela\nyeah sure so you know sometimes when i\nworked as a psychiatrist i would work\nwith kids who were in orphanages or\nfoster homes do you know what that means\nlike okay like people but no parents\nright so they lived in this home right\nwhere there's like one caretaker and\nthere's 30 kids\nand oftentimes there wasn't enough food\nso for example like the meals were like\nvery limited\nthere wasn't a whole lot in terms of\nsnacks\nyou know it's like one person kind of\ncooking and they're also trying to like\nmake money so they skimp on meals and\nthings like that\nand so one of the kids that uh was in\nthere ended up getting adopted by a\nfamily\nso they moved to their new home right\nwhere their parents are there and the\nparents\nfeed them whatever they want so like or\nnot whatever but they have meals and\nthere's a pantry and they've got snacks\nin there\nand they tell the kid you know like you\ncan come and you can get whatever food\nyou want\nand the parents kept on finding ants\nin the child's room\nand so they were confused about why\ntheir ants there and what they see is\nthat like there are portions of food\nfrom dinner and snacks and things like\nthat that have been like wrapped in\npaper towels and like captain drawers\nkept under the bed that the child was\nstoring food\nin their room half-eaten food\nso when the parents that eat dinner and\nthere'd be some bread and the child\nwould like take the bread wrap it in a\nnapkin and put it in their pocket and\nthen they'd go and they'd put that\nthat food kind of in the drawer does\nthat make sense are you following me\nyeah\nso the parents come to me and they're\nlike we think the kid has some problem\nbecause like\nhe's like hoarding like they thought he\nwas a hoarder where he's just like not\nletting stuff go it's causing problems\nand things like that\nand that's where like you know we spent\nsome time talking to the kid the kid was\nlike seven\nso you know i talked to him some\nbut we sort of realized that this this\nchild basically has an insecurity where\nthey've gone hungry for the first seven\nyears of their life\nand so when they've got hungry they've\ncreated certain kinds of\nadaptations\nto survive\nbut those adaptations aren't really\nhealthy right even though there's like a\nbunch of friends i mean sorry a bunch of\nfood\nin the pantry the child still for their\nown safety\nhas to like take the food and store it\nbecause they don't know they don't know\nhow long this magical pantry full of\nfood is gonna last because for seven\nyears they haven't had access to that\nand then they go to this new place where\nsuddenly like i can eat whatever i want\nto like what's the catch like how are\nyou trying to trick me is this a scam in\nsome way you're just saying that today\nbut of course you're gonna take it away\nand so in that same way i almost see\nan element of this in you\nthat you're so hungry for friendship\nthat you're gonna hold on to whatever\nyou get your hands on\neven though you don't realize that\nyellow there are\nhundreds thousands of people out there\nwho you can form friendships with\nyeah but\nit's not only um\nlike\ni'm afraid of that the friends will go\naway\nit's\nlike\num i worked a lot on myself uh\nlike uh personal development in the last\nyear and\num\nright now i i have to feeling like i\ncan put so much energy into\nrelationships and\ni have like feel like\nthere will be times when\nwhen i'm\nwill be\nworse\noff again and don't have that much\nenergy and\n[Music]\nlike i fear that when when\nwhen the that day comes um\nthat\num\nyeah i can't put that much energy and uh\nlike\nthen they will have better me so it\nfeels like i need to um\nyeah\nwant like extra hard uh yes of course\nyou don't know how long that pantry is\ngonna be open to you\nyou better you better get as much food\nas you can now\nyou have to bond extra hard\nright because in the future it's not\ngoing to be possible\nyeah and like uh so i know\nyeah so\ni i get you so what do you think that's\ndoing to your desperation\nthe neediness\nit becomes bigger absolutely\nas the need becomes bigger the\nattachment becomes bigger as the\nattachment becomes\nbigger\nyou're going to send six messages\nbecause the need is that much greater\ni can't afford to just send four\nit needs to be five it needs to be six\ni can't let this person slip away\nit's all the same thing\nyellow\nyeah\nand i know it's really hard that that's\nwhy like i'm not\ni can't argue with that part of you\nright if i said oh\nyeah you've got 40 years to make friends\nthat part of you is not going to listen\neven though technically it's like you've\ngot your whole life to make friends\nyeah but making friends with heartland\nyeah but like keeping friends with\nharder yeah right so so but that's your\nexperience so for me to say you've got\n40 years to make friends like that\ndoesn't matter because in your\nexperience the time is running out\nand that's where like really it's it's\nhard detachment man that's where it's\nlike okay if the time is running out\nit's going to run out and if i'm going\nto be lonely i'm going to be lonely but\nin this moment\ni have an opportunity to spend time with\none person\nand i'm going to make the most of today\nand interestingly enough when you start\nthinking that way and you start not\nworrying about whether this person will\nbe available tomorrow a week from now a\nmonth from now a year from now oh my god\nif this person if i don't act nice\nenough today this person won't be my\nfriend and then two years from now i'm\nnot going to have any energy to make\nfriends\nand then i'll be 35 and then i'll be 41\nand then i'll be 46. and if i'm 46 and i\nhave no friends then no one's gonna want\nto be my friend\nand all of these thoughts will come\nbubbling up\nbut the core thing\nis still\nwhen you sit with someone they can't fix\nall of those problems for you\nyeah\nbut to some extent i also feel like\nsometimes i feel like\nmaybe it's better for myself to be alone\nbecause it's so much harder when i\nengage with other people that\nsometimes\ni just think being alone\nwould just make things a lot easier oh\ndefinitely\nright if if only you could be content\nin being alone\nwell i think i can but\ni don't know\nyeah i\nyell my my heart goes out to you my\nfriend i think that it's\nhow can i say this\none of the most horrible adaptations\nthat a human being can have\nis to be okay without something that\nthey need\nand so\nthe humans humans are resilient\nyou'll learn how to be alone\nbut i really hope that you don't have a\nlife where you're forced\nto learn how to survive with loneliness\ni hope so too\nand i think the key thing here is just\nacknowledging every moment that those\nthoughts\nare telling you to do something and as\nbest as you can resist it a little bit\nand the one thing that i can tell you is\nthat the more you resist it\nthe easier it will be to resist\nwhere in the same way that you feed it\nevery day and it grows\nthe more that you let your anxiety go\nhungry\nyou don't give in to it by sending the\ntext message it'll actually start to\nshrink\nit'll be a painful shrinkage because any\ntime it's shrinking it's hungry and it's\nnot getting what it needs\nand it's gonna like give you hell\nbut it'll eventually shrink and shrink\nand shrink and shrink and shrink and\nthen eventually it'll disappear\nyeah\nit's hard because it's always on my mind\nto\ni want to make sure and\nin the morning i think about it and\nthroughout the day i always\nthink that\ni need the reassurance from others\nyes\ni i it certainly sounds hard it sounds\nlike it's a very dominating part of your\nmind\nyes\nand it sounds\nhonestly it also almost sounds like\ntorture to me\nat the moment it really feels like this\nand\nit really made me also dope\ndope what i what i did\nover the last year because\ni\nthis feeling is is new to me like i i\nwas\nlike like you said i was content with\nbeing alone i was miserable in other\nways but\n[Music]\nuh\nit's it's really hard right\nright now\ni hear that man i'm so sorry\ni i don't know if i've been able to help\nyou so far\nbut\nwhat do you think\nyeah a little bit\num\nhonestly um\nit feels good but i\nhaven't really um\ntaken it all into my mind um\nbut um yeah no i just i mean i\njust if i can disagree there i think you\ndid take it into your mind i think it's\njust\nit's just not\nenough right yeah\nwhat i'm really the more that i listen\nto you now i'm just noticing how big the\nmountain you have to climb really is\noh it's big\nand and i i don't know what else to say\nbesides\neven if it feels kind of hopeless to you\nit doesn't feel quite as hopeless to me\nbut at the same time i also acknowledge\nthat you know it better than i do\nright so even if you do feel hopeless i\nthink it's actually like okay to feel\nthat way because you're the one who's\nhad to struggle with this\nyeah\nand if you can i'd say\nyou know sit with that hopelessness and\ndon't necessarily give in to it\nbut it's very easy for me to say oh no\nthere's lots of opportunities to make\nfriends believe in yourself yeah\nbelieve in yourself and make friends and\neverything would be okay when like what\ni'm really noticing is that it's very\nheavy what you carry around\nyeah\nit feels like i'm\nat the moment climbing the mountain and\nlike\nat the half halfway point it's like\nit gets so much harder and i think maybe\ni should just roll down back into the\nvalley and\ngo to sleep and\ni don't think you should do that but i\nthink you've earned yourself a break\nright so you've climbed halfway up the\nmountain i'm surprised you said halfway\ni was expecting i just started climbing\nthe mountain\nbut\ni i did a lot of uh other things um\nuh besides the social uh things like i i\nlost 40 kilo i don't know what that's in\nthat's awesome\namerican units but i improved my health\nby a lot i\nlike\na year ago i wasn't able to really um\nleave my house that much and yeah\n[ __ ]\nyeah but it's hard right now i know that\ni did\na lot of stuff and uh like my mind\nalways tells me\ni know that's really awesome awesome\nwhat i did but\nthere's always these uh\nuh\nthoughts in my mind that\nuh it it only made it like worse or it\nit's way harder now and\nsometimes i have the feeling why did i\neven start because\nmaybe i was just more content playing\nvideo games all day and\njust not having a life than having an um\n[Music]\nlife of struggle\nwait yellow\nyou weren't leaving the house a year ago\nand you lost 40 kilos\nyeah\nwhat do you think about that\nit's nice it's awesome\ndo you really believe that it's awesome\nyeah\nlike\nyeah\nbut\nit's also\njust like it's\nhalfway at the mountain and really\nawesome is when i'm up on the mountain\nokay one last thing i'm going to share\nwith you because apparently you're a\ngiga chad too you just pretended to be a\nnoob this whole time\nso i i don't want to devalue your your\nfriendship struggles but there's one\nother thing that i want you to\nunderstand about the mind\nyeah\nsometimes when there's a part of\nourselves\nwho hates us\nokay\nso when we get abandoned by people what\ndo we start thinking about ourselves\n[Music]\nabsolutely\nand then if you start putting your your\nlife together\nwhat is that part of your mind gonna do\ni don't know it's gonna panic\nand it's gonna start launching nuclear\nweapons\nbecause this whole time we've built my\nlife on the idea that i'm unlovable and\ni'm a piece of crap\nand then if you start putting your life\ntogether that part of your mind will\nfight you with every weapon it's got\nbecause suddenly\nyou're about to this whole thing exists\nbecause you are worthless\nthat's its lifeblood\nit's its energy and if you start having\nconfidence against yours for yourself\nit's gonna fight you as hard as it can\ndoes that make any sense to you\na little bit so\nwhat you're saying is that uh it wants\nme to have no confidence it wants to\nstay yes\nright what it wants to do is it's trying\nto convince you roll down the mountain\nand go to sleep in the valley\nlike what the [ __ ] man\nyou're halfway up\nand it's telling you to throw away all\nof your\nwork it's telling you to go back to\nwhere you were a year ago\nyeah\nthat's really dumb i don't want to be\nthere but this is what you've got to\nunderstand is that that part of you\nwants to survive too\nso there's one thing that i'm going to\nshare with you before we kind of wrap up\nbecause we've got to get to another\ncaller\nso one thing i've noticed is when people\nput their lives together and they really\ndon't believe in themselves there's\nsomething that i call the rubber band of\nself-development\nso it's like i'm tied to a tree\nand i'm tied by a rubber band and the\nthe harder i walk away from the tree the\nrubber band snaps me back even harder so\ni'll run and i'll run and i'll run and\nthen i'll get like 10 feet away from the\ntree or three meters away from the tree\nfour meters away from the tree and as i\nget four meters away from the tree the\nrubber band's elasticity pulls me back\nand i come sliding back to where i\nstarted\nand i've seen this time and time again\nwith people who start to put their lives\ntogether\nyou get out of your depression you clean\nyour house you apply for a job you go to\nwork you stay there for the first two\nweeks you get hired two more weeks go by\nand then suddenly you're like something\npanics and then you stop showing up at\nwork\nyou stay at home you play video games\nyou eat a bunch of junk food and then\nyou go back to your misery\nyeah these things happen but\nthe band gets more\nit's easier the next time when you get\nback\nare you giving me words of hope and\nencouragement about\ncontinuing to move forward\nbecause it's going to get easier next\ntime\nyeah but sometimes you move backwards\nand so but it's okay because\nso\nit's easier the next time\nall right if you say so\ni met the experience\nyou had\nsomething like\nif a\nalcoholic\nfirst gets over he's like sober for one\nday the next time he's sober for um\nuh\nfor two weeks and then he's over for a\nlittle month like it's get it gets\nbetter every time um\nyou you can't get it all right the first\ntime and yeah\nokay do you think that applies to making\nfriends too\nyeah but\nit's hard every time it\ndoesn't work out and um\nokay so yela this is what i want you to\ndo\nyou said that you want to help yourself\nthe way that you help other people\nyeah\nall you need to do is go watch the vod\nof this conversation\nand what you just did\nover the last five minutes is you helped\nlike everyone who's listening\nokay\nso\ni think you're gonna be fine i think\nit's gonna be hard\ni think you've had a lot of suffering\npile up\nin your life\nand the weight of that\nis very heavy\nand you wouldn't be able to carry it\nunless you lost that 40 kilos\nbut without those 40 kilos you could\ncarry this crap and keep moving buddy\ni hope so yeah that's\nthat's all we can ask for\nright yeah\ngood luck to you my friend\nyeah thank you so much for having me\nyou showed up here having lost 40 kilos\nwe were like i shot in a year ago\ni'll take i mean i'll take credit for\nwhat i do but i think like honestly 95\nof it 99 of you has been you bro\nokay\nyeah\nthen thanks for giving me the\nopportunity to\npresent myself i guess thank you very\nmuch yela\nokay take care see you thanks\nwhat\ni i don't even know what the hell\nhappened there\ni i\ni mean i\nit is what it is like i i don't even\nknow what to say like\nso\nclearly yala has had a lot of stuff\nnot go their way\nright\nand also\nthey're absolutely crushing it\nand\nwho knows\ni i don't know what to say like this is\nwhy like it's hard to describe\nso in a live conversation like sometimes\nthese things happen so when i work with\npeople right we see this in coaches too\nwe like work with people like we don't\nknow exactly what we're doing we don't\nreally know how it works but like i just\ndon't know how to say it like this is\nwhy we started this program like this is\nwhy we have live interaction with other\nhuman beings\nbecause you can spend a lot and time\nwith someone\nand it just feels like nothing's working\nand then suddenly like something weird\nhappens and then you start thinking\nabout things in a different way\ni don't know how to explain\nthis\nyou just have to see it\nand like this is the cool thing is that\nthis can happen consistently\nit's all about what's up here\nthe thing is it's just weird man i'm i'm\nblown away by that guy\nuh one piece addict is saying his\nabandoned fears don't get fixed by him\nlosing weight though well said right so\nthe fear of abandonment is different\nthe thing though is that the fear of\nabandonment is rooted in self-worth\nright so like where does the fear\nabandonment come from it comes from this\nidea that i'm not worth other people\nsticking around\nputting your life together climbing\nhalfway up the mountain he's the one who\nsaid it was halfway and losing 40 kilos\nabsolutely affects self-worth\nand then even at the end when i asked\nhim well like but how do you feel about\nhe's like every time you you know you\nlose ground like it gets easier the next\ntime but i was like but what about\nfriends right i debated him i was like\nhey\npart of you that wants to be abandoned\nthis is your chance to say yeah that's\ntrue for weight but it's not true for\nfriendships\ni gave him i gave him the opportunity to\nsay yeah that's like it's completely\napples and oranges\nbut he didn't he didn't take it\nhe was like well i have some hope\nright and this is the thing like\ngood point\nbut like i i think when we get stuck in\nour own heads\nwe do not realize how awesome we are\nright i don't think and for the record i\ndon't think the mods like screened that\nright like do you all get that they send\nlike a prompt and they read it out at\nthe beginning\nit's not like the mods are screening\npeople by the way who's had a 40 kilo\nweight loss in the last year we're gonna\npick you to come on i'm pretty sure mods\nhad no clue\nthis is the thing is that each and every\none of you who thinks that your life is\nabsolute crap and each and every one of\nyou that is weighed down by all these\nfears and negative emotions and stuff\nlike that you don't realize you all get\nthat with these call-in streams we call\nin random randos from our community\nit's not like we pick the five percent\nof giga chads\nthe whole point is that we're all giga\nchats\nright and you just don't see it\neach and every one of us is absolutely\namazing i believe that i'm not and i'm\nnot saying that because i'm some\nfreaking dr k optimist like oh like dr k\nlike believe in all people no crap like\nthis happens where i'm like man this guy\nis screwed\nand then he's like by the way\ni did this this and this\nand then you work with people time and\ntime and time again\nand you expect them to be\nlike you know because they say something\nright so like oh i'm like i'm struggling\nand i'm pathetic and i'm depressed and\nyou're like oh okay so i guess that\nmeans you're struggling and pathetic and\ndepressed and then you're like wait a\nminute no hold on a second this person\nis none of those things this person is\nresilient they're strong they're\nintelligent they're capable they're\ncompassionate\nwe've even had\nsome people who have been reviled by the\ninternet\nlike so we did an interview with a trump\nsupporter and everyone is was expecting\nthis person oh because everyone like\nvilifies trump supporters right so\nclearly this person who's a die-hard\ntrump supporter\nis must be a terrible human being no\namazing human being incredibly inspiring\nand this is the thing the reason i have\nfaith in humanity is not because i'm an\noptimist it's because i've spent a lot\nof time with a lot of humanity and each\nand every person is amazing in some way\nlike that's not like me being optimistic\nthat's me just being surprised over and\nover and over again and i still get\nsurprised i got surprised today\ni don't know what\nand it's what keeps it interesting for\nme i guess but\nyou"
