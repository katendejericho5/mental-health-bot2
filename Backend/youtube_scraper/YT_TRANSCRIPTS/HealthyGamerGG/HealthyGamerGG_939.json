    "transcript": "if i can't even be the one percent in\nwhat i'm good at and what i'm passionate\nabout how on earth am i ever going to be\nthe one percent at this engineering firm\ni feel like i'm destined for mediocrity\nthis post is probably going to come off\na little bit desperate slash pathetic\nbut i needed a space to type it out and\nbe heard\nas the title says i feel like i'm\ndestined to live a mediocre life\ni'm a more creative person a creative\nmind\nperson\nand i get bored very easily doing\nmonotonous tasks that don't allow me to\nexpress myself in any way\nissue is in the real world only the best\nget to make their dreams slash passions\na lucrative reality and i've tried for\nso long to become the best but i'm\nstarting to think that my best will just\nnever be good enough everyone around me\nalways seems to think that i'm destined\nfor some great thing as if they're\nseeing something about me that i'm not\nbut they're not nearly as knowledgeable\nabout my craft as i am so they can't see\nthat i'm not cut out for it i'm better\nthan the average person but being better\nthan average doesn't mean you'll get\nnoticed or be able to make a job out of\nyour passions\ni feel like i need to learn to be\ncontent with a life of misery in the rat\nrace as many others have it feels like\nthe only option i have\nwhat do you all think i know this\nprobably didn't make much sense but any\nwords would be appreciated\nso this is\nsomething that a lot of people struggle\nwith\nand what happens is you grow up\nor you're growing up\nand you recognize that you're different\nfrom the average path of success\nso you you look around and you look at\nthe people who have like stable jobs and\nare happy and are quote unquote\nsuccessful whatever\nand what you tend to find is like these\npeople are like they're pretty like\nmonotonous right\nso it's like oh this person was\nsuccessful because like every day after\nschool they went home and they studied\nand they did their extracurriculars on\nthursday nights and on saturday mornings\nthey did volunteering\nand then they joined the\nswimming team\nand then they got into a good college\nand they studied every day after school\nand they did college swimming and then\nthey got into a good grad school or they\ngot hired as an engineer here they\npicked some like boring monotonous major\nthat has a good starting salary and job\nsecurity and then they became successful\nand so you kind of look at this and\nyou're like well like\nif i was living that person's life i\nwould go insane like i couldn't do it i\ncouldn't go into the office every single\nday and like do the same crap\nyou know\nwhatever that job is or this job or\nwhatever like i just get way too bored\nwith that\ni'm a creative person\nand then like the problem is that like\nyou look at this sort of successful path\nin life and you kind of say okay this\ndoesn't really work for me\nand then you recognize that it does work\nfor some people right so like some\npeople have like you you visited an art\ngallery\nand there's like a painting there that\nsomeone is selling for like two hundred\nthousand dollars\nand you're like wow like so apparently\nit's possible\nbut how many people make art and how\nmany people sell a painting for 200\ngrand\nhow many people have their art featured\nin a gallery\nso you kind of realize that there's like\nthere are two paths right you can be\nthe monotonous path where you can still\nget\nyou can become relatively successful\nbecause like they want to pee on or you\ncan go to the creative path where like\n99 of people are starving artists\nright and even if you think about it\nsocietally we don't talk about\nthe starving software engineer i mean\nmaybe we\nthey i'm sure they exist but the the\nidea is the starving artist\nright\nand then you recognize that even if you\nwant to you can be successful but like\nthe chances of success\nin your\ngiven your talents and strengths is\nreally low\nand so then what happens is you sort of\nend up\nkind of like resigning yourself to\na life of misery\nyou're like i guess the only way for me\nto like be content in life is to accept\nmisery\nthat's my strategy\nright because like\nyou're you're not in the top one percent\ni mean even this person is saying\ni'm better than average\nbut i ain't in the top one percent\nand so the only conclusion that you kind\nof come to is like well it seems like\ni'm destined for mediocrity so what i'm\ngoing to do is learn to be content with\na life of misery\nbe a part of the rat race and since it's\nnot my passion i'm gonna be destined for\nmediocrity because how can i ever be the\none percent if i can't even be the one\npercent in what i'm good at and what i'm\npassionate about how on earth am i ever\ngonna be the one percent at this\nengineering firm\nso how do you navigate this it's super\nhard\nso let's understand a couple of things\nfirst\nso if we look at this post\nwhat we see\nis that this person starts with ideas\nokay\nso let's just take a quick look at what\nsome of these ideas are\nokay so i get bored easily with\nmonotonous tasks in\nissue is in the real world only the best\nget to make their passion dream slash\npassions a lucrative reality\nright\nso\nthis is kind of like a key idea\nso there's like the monotonous people\nthey can be successful\ni'm not monotonous\nand only the best\nmake\npassion\na reality so we start with these ideas\nand then what happens\nis we become miserable\nright because if all these things are\ntrue\nand we believe them to be true we're not\nidiots we believe these things for a\nreason\nwe go to art galleries and we see you\nknow one out of a thousand artists\nactually selling paintings\nas we become miserable\nwe then conclude that the my only choice\ni feel like i need to i feel like i need\nto learn to be content with a life of\nmisery it feels like the only option i\nhave\nis to become\ncontent\nso where is this person's focus what are\nthey going to learn where are they going\nto invest their energy\nthey're going to invest their energy\nover here\nso they're going to learn how to\nmeditate\nthey're going to learn\nthey're going to learn how to journal\nyou know they're going to learn try to\nlearn detachment\nthey're going to do all this really\nimportant internal work to be content\nwith a life of misery\nforget the oxymoron there in a second\nbecause if you're content then you're\nnot miserable but whatever this is\ndoomed to failure\nbut this is where they focus on\nand what do you think this actually does\nto this part\nnothing\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwhen you adopt this mentality\nnot only is it true\nyou're making it true\nit becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nbecause you invest your energy here\ninstead of changing this\nbecause this person doesn't have an\noption to build a life that is less\nmiserable like literally they say the\nonly it feels like the only option i\nhave is to be content with misery\nwe'll get into why that is in a second\nbut then there are a couple of other\ninteresting things to understand so when\ni'm miserable about my life\nenter this\nthis is an interesting thing right\neveryone around me seems it seems to\nthink i'm destined for great things\nbut they're clueless\nright it's like when your mom is like oh\nbeta you are so handsome\nany any woman would be lucky to marry\nyou\nyou're so good child you're the bestest\nyou're the smartest\nyou are so handsome\noh\nand so everyone around you offers you\nreassurance\nright they say all these kinds of things\noh it's okay you're so talented you're a\ngenius oh beta you're a genius\nand how does that make us feel\nwhen you're like 25 years old and you're\nalone and you haven't been on a date in\ntwo years\nand your mom is sitting there telling\nyou that you're the most handsome most\nwonderful man in the world\nin the world\nor you're a woman and your dad is\ntelling you that or you're a woman and\nyour mom is telling you that whatever\nright\nit makes you feel worse\nit actually increases your misery\nas it increases your misery\nyou double down on this\nand so you kind of like doom yourself to\ntrying to become content with misery as\nopposed to fixing the misery\nand when you stop trying to actually\nimprove your life that's when it really\nbecomes true\nand then as you and then a year goes by\nright so a year goes by and then like\nyou're more miserable\nmisery leveled up\nand then you're like man i got to learn\nme some copium\ncoping skills\nbe content\nmeditate harder i'm not meditating good\nenough\nand the cycle\nrepeats itself\nokay\nso let's understand a couple of\ninteresting things here\nso why does this happen\nwhy do we resign ourselves to being\ncontent like it's kind of weird right\nbecause what we actually need to do is\nbe like if we want to solve this problem\nwe don't want to like resign ourselves\nto being content we actually want to\nfeel kind of bad\nand use that badness to improve our\nsituation\nin a weird way\nso here's the thing\nwhat do you all think is the primary\nemotion\nthat is controlling this person's life\npay attention to the question\nwhat do y'all think is the primary\nemotion\nso people are saying self-pity\nresentment\nfear shame\nso now i'm going to ask you all a\ndifferent question doubt shame\ndiscouragement\njealousy\nfear\nokay so i'm going to ask you two\nquestions\nwhat do you think\nis the primary motion this person is\nfeeling\nand what do you think is the primary\nemotion that is controlling their life\nand that may sound weird because aren't\nthose two\nthings the same absolutely not\nright so here's so a lot of people are\nsaying hopelessness despair things like\nthat\nso let's understand this\nwe're feeling hopelessness\nbut what's actually controlling their\nlife is fear\nthis is what i experience\nbut at the root of this is fear\nnow let's understand this very simply\nso when i'm afraid of something\nwhat\nwhich of these\nthree steps\nis an antidote to fear\nright so if i were to say ideas\nmisery\ncontentment\nright it's kind of interesting so this\nis where i want you all to understand\nthis when i'm afraid of something\nokay we're going to figure this out\nlet's say you're afraid of something\nhappening what is something that you can\ndo mentally to make yourself feel better\nabout that fear\nwhat do you tell yourself so if i'm\nafraid\nthat\nyou can avoid it right so if i'm afraid\nthat like i'm gonna i'm gonna fail this\ntest\nwhat do i tell myself\nwhen i'm sitting down to take the test\nyeah so so some people are gonna say\nlike i couldn't have done it anyways\nperfect zander on\nright oh this is already gonna fail\nthere's no way i can pass might as well\njust try because there's no way i can\npass\nso it's interesting because if you\nassume the worst case scenario and if\nyou really pay attention to your fears\nwhat you'll find is assuming the worst\ncase scenario is actually protective\nagainst the fear because the whole point\nof fear is that it's uncertain\nit could happen and it may not happen\nbut if i accept the worst case scenario\nand i learn to survive that then the\nworst of the damage is done and the\nuncertainty is actually removed from the\nequation\ndo you all get that\nso contentment\nand resignation\nis actually a coping mechanism to fear\ndo you all get that\nbecause if i resign myself to it if i\njust assume if i tell myself there's no\nway that this person will love me\nthey're definitely going to break up\nwith me\nthey're definitely going to break up\nwith me you're definitely going to agree\ni can tell\nyou want to be out of this relationship\ni can tell\nnow let's look at that well you're\nafraid that the person is going to break\nup with you and how do you does your\nmind actually adapt to that\nit moves into resignation\nit assumes it has true\nthere's no way i'm gonna get this job\nit's impossible i'm so under qualified\ni'm afraid i won't get this job\nand so what does your mind do to protect\nyou\nfrom that disappointment\nit makes you resigned\nand then the interesting thing\nis if you're afraid that someone's gonna\nbreak up with you\nand you go talk to your friends about it\nand they're like no no no you're like\nthe best person in the world like no one\nwould ever break up with you you're so\nbeautiful you're so amazing\nanyone would be lucky to be with you\nhow does that make you feel does that\nreassure you\nabsolutely not makes you more miserable\nso now we begin to see how this this\nsequence\nis actually rooted in fear\nthat the reassurance doesn't reassure\nreassurance makes you feel more\nmiserable makes you feel more resigned\nbecause the mind sort of has this thing\nwhere like\ni can protect myself against the fear by\nbeing resigned and this is not just\nhumans that do this\nright so like you'll see this like in\nanimals who give up as well\nso like giving up\nis like\na biologically conserved thing across\nspecies\nthere's no point in wasting my energy\nwhen the conclusion is fixed\nright it's not just humans like animals\nwill give up too\nso if you want to break out and i know\nit sounds kind of weird but it's like\ni feel like i'm destined for mediocrity\nwhat you've got to fix is the fear\nthe fear is at the root of all of this\nyou're afraid\nbecause here's like let me put it to you\nthis way and you all tell me if you\nthink this fits\nonly\nbest\nonly the best get to make their dreams\nor passions a lucrative reality i guess\ni have to resign myself to a life of\nmediocrity and like doing some kind of\nmonotonous task and suffer like everyone\nelse\ni'm gonna rephrase this for y'all and\nyou tell me if you think this fits\nyou're not destined for mediocrity\ni think that this person\nis afraid\nthat if they give it their all\nif they actually pursue their passions\nand if they don't take the safe route if\nthey don't take the monotonous route\nfive years of sweat and blood in tears\nand they still won't be successful\nten years and they still won't be\nsuccessful they're terrified\nof taking the road less traveled and\nending them up like in the desert where\nlike their sol\nhow does the mind protect you from that\nit says\nno no no my friend you are destined for\nmediocrity don't walk that road\nit's an unsafe road\nlearn to be content with a life of\nmisery and join the rat race where\nthings are safe\nthis is fear\nit's all fear\nso a couple of other things that we'll\nsort of end with\none is that let's talk about destiny for\na second\nso destiny implies linearity\nright the whole point is that no matter\nwhat i do i'm gonna end up here so like\nthere's like a linearity to destiny does\nthat sort of make sense there's not\nbut this isn't what life is like\nright this is really what life is like\nso i've got a choice do i want to major\nin engineering or\ndesign\nokay i chose design do i want to work at\na big firm or do i want to focus on my\nart for a year\nam i going to do an internship over here\nor a fellowship over here\nam i going to\n[Music]\nlearn how to use this am i going to\nlearn how to use photoshop or am i going\nto learn am i going to spend some time\npainting\nthis is really what life is like\nthere's no destiny in life i mean there\nsort of is but\nit's not like this\nbecause you have a lot of agency in life\nand you can still end up here from here\nand so in a sense like you can still you\nknow make a a straight chain kind of\nlike you did here the key thing is\nthough there's a lot of branches\nthere's a lot of choice there's a lot of\nagency\nand this is where like this person makes\na couple of these assumptions like\nissue is in the real world only the best\nget to make their dreams or passion to\nlucrative reality like i don't know what\nthis person is basing the statement on\ni don't know\nwhere this idea comes from\nand if you're a creative minded person\nlike just to give you all a simple\nexample i was working with someone a\ncouple years ago who was very creatively\nminded\nand they also like to travel\nand they're like i'm not really sure\nlike what job is for me like i really\nlike art like i appreciate art but\ni don't my favorite thing to do is like\ngo to different places and see like\nlocal art\nbut i don't want to like make these like\nafrican portraits and stuff from cuba\nand things like that i just really like\nlooking at it\nand i'm very creative i'm really good at\nlike decorating and things like that\nand so like how can you turn that into a\njob so they did something really\ninteresting they moved to a city in the\nunited states\nwhere\na lot of people were moving to\nfrom another part of the country and\ngenerally speaking these people are\nwealthy\nso what they sort of discovered is that\nwealthy people don't like to have\nmass-produced art in their home\nbut also like wealthy people can't\nnecessarily afford like a rembrandt\nso they started like an interior design\nservice\nwhere they like would help people\ndecorate their new homes and their big\nthing is i'm gonna source this with\nunique art from all over the world\nthat's fair trade\nso you will get a unique piece of\nartwork that no one else in the world\nhas\nand it'll come from some\nyou know every piece of artwork has a\nbackstory\nso they traveled for a while they took a\nbunch of pictures they even bought a few\npieces\nand they came back and like i kid you\nnot in the city\ni know someone else who moved to the\ncity recently\nall of the interior decorators had at\nleast a three to six month wait list to\neven get an appointment\nand this person is like\nvery happy now\nit's wild\nlike i don't know how sustainable that\nis i don't know that y'all can go and do\nthis my point is that like if you pay\nattention to the world and you bring\nreal value to it chances are you offer\nwhat you have to give there will be\npeople who will\nwant\nit right so this is where someone hybrid\narea says that can't happen for everyone\nyou are correct\nand also\nwhich part of your mind is generating\nthat thought\nso as i say that as i say hey by the way\nthis is actually a possibility\nif you say that can't happen for\neveryone i'll completely agree with you\nthat's not the solution for everyone\nbut the resign part of your mind\nis going to say things like that\nright because it's going to say don't\nbother going down this route\njust be content with misery\nand this is where i'd say it's not the\nbest\nthat make their dreams or passion\nreality it's the people who\nreally try\nand are open-minded\nand are flexible with how they make\nhow they\nactualize what they're interested in\nbecause there's a big gap between\ni'm a creative person and i need to be\nan artist\nmaybe you could be an interior decorator\nmaybe you could do graphic design\nmaybe you could\nmake nfts\non gamestop's new nft market who knows\nright\nmy point is that it's it's not about\nlike\nand when you start out like all you see\nif you want to end up over here\nyour first two choices are this\nyou may never be able to end up here but\ni don't necessarily know\nthat even if you make it over here that\nyou'll necessarily be happy with this\nbecause this we've seen in our community\na lot where people are like i did\neverything i was supposed to do and i'm\nnot happy\ni got an engineering degree and i find\nit spiritually unfulfilling\ni was good at math\nso i decided to do engineering\nthe whole point is like if you want to\nbe content in life like you got to learn\nsome amount of internal contentment sure\nbut then recognize that like destiny in\nlife is not that\nfixed\nyou have a lot of choices and recognize\nthat what life is life is like chess\nit's not like a linear game\nand so what you should do is every step\nof the way make this\nmove the piece that feels the best to\nyou at the time\nbecause what happens is everyone who\nmakes all the right moves in life\nusually ends up in the wrong place\nand so if you want to end up in the\nright place what you've really got to do\nis be very careful about\nmaking in a sense quote unquote the\nwrong moves\nright like oh i like math so i'm going\nto major in or i'm good at math so i'm\ngoing to major in something that i'm\ngood at as opposed to something that i\ncare about\nso it's challenging\nwe oftentimes feel like we're destined\nfor mediocrity\nand it's not like\nit's not like you're\nthere's a lot about that thought process\nthat feels right\nthe problem though is that even though\nthe primary emotion that we feel is\ndespair and so we try to tackle despair\nand we're going to learn how to be\ncontent with ourselves\nhow do i learn how to be content with\nmisery\nand when i start focusing on being\ncontent instead of not being miserable\nlike when i stop actually like when i\nresign myself to my circumstances that's\nwhat actually becomes a self-fulfilling\nprophecy\nso this really starts with understanding\nlike what is it that you're afraid of\nand once we let that fear\nonce we tackle that fear in some way\nprocess that fear even vocalize that\nfear i'm not saying it's going to go\naway and you'll be fear free\nbecause the antidote to that fear is\nironically resignation\nbecause if you assume the worst\nand you can manage to survive that you\ncan even tell right so i need to learn\nhow to survive the worst and then i'll\nbe okay\nso let me choose the worst thing let me\nactually move towards the worst thing\nand all i have to do is survive a worst\ncase scenario and then everything above\nthat becomes easier\nit's so challenging\nbecause the way that our mind helps us\ncope with fear is actually through\nresignation\nbut the moment that you become resigned\nthat destiny actually becomes true\nyou"
