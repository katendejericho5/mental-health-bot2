    "transcript": "you fix what you can and if you're still\nunhappy there and your workplace can't\naccommodate the rest or aren't willing\nto accommodate the rest or whatever then\nyou should consider finding a different\njob or whatever\nwelcome\nuh thanks what do you go my friend\nI go by snow snow\nyeah cool\nso what are you working on snow\nuh yeah so my prompt was I want to work\non moving on on the contemplative to\npreparation stage of change I've been\ntrying to change for many years and I\nthink I have decent awareness into\nmyself but it's still not enough to make\nme want to take action\nokay wow that was very well thought out\nthank you you sound uh so uh can you\ntell can you explain to us what\nthe contemplative versus preparation\nstages are\nalthough like full disclosure I have a\nslide up so I'm gonna like read all of\nthat\nso the contemplative stage of change is\nwhere you're aware the problem exists\nbut you don't have commitment to action\nand the preparation stage of changes\nwhen your intent on taking action to\naddress the problem\nokay very well said so you're aware that\nthere's a problem but you're not\nmotivated to take action\nyeah or there's like a strong resistance\nokay is there a strong resistance\nyeah there is a strong resistance and\nI'm even aware of\nlike the different factors of that\nresistance but even that is not enough\nto make me want to change\nokay can we go into some details now\nyeah for sure so\nI guess like I actually want to say that\nthe previous\num the previous caller\num kind of helped a bit more\nand it is kind of related to my\nsituation but just with a different\ndetails so\num yeah just to go into a little bit\nmore detail about my situation it's that\nso I'm really struggling in terms of\nchanging with my belief towards money\nand how it ties to survival\nbecause it's weird because I don't even\nI didn't I didn't grow up poor or\nanything I like grew up middle class so\nI don't it's weird because yeah I don't\nfeel like I have any strong\num negative Early Childhood stuff\nrelated to that so I don't really know\nwhere that church strong belief came\nfrom but I have this like I've been\nsaving\num since I was a little kid and so maybe\nit was like the ego syntonic stuff that\nI really built up plus later negative\nstuff happened\num but basically sorry just my belief\naround money is that\nSo currently I'm unemployed but\nI've been working\nfull-time I was working full-time for\nabout like four to five years\nand I was burnt out for my job\num and possibly the whole industry as\nwell but I'm really having trouble\nbecause like\nI've tried several times so I even like\ntried part-time options just to see if\nit will work better with the burnout and\nstuff but I found that it still didn't\nwork in terms of like pressure and stuff\nlike that\num and I'm trying to find like yeah\ntrying to career change and stuff like\nthat but there's this part of me that\nlike doesn't want to work honestly and\nthere's also\na part of me that like lacks Direction\nand that's the thing about myself it's\nlike I find it hard\nyeah I find it very hard to know\nwell it's like sorry no I do know some\nthings that I want I think the\nresistance to money\nalso spending money is one big factor\nthat um holds me back\nokay\nSo when you say you\nwhat So when you say you want to move on\nto preparation what's your goal\nso what do you want to be able to do\nthat you're not able to do right now\nsay things like probably not enough to\nlast me the rest of my life but at least\nI can go for a few years\num especially because I still live with\nmy dad right now\num so either one option is to be okay\nwith\num\nlike kind of be okay with taking it slow\nbecause I also find that I'm quite\nimpatient\noption two is like\nI guess you could say the ideal or what\nI think I should be doing which is like\nyou know to find a better job that suits\nme more\nokay\nall right so let me understand so\ncan I think for a second snow yeah thank\nyou for calling in today by the way\nno I'm so happy I got chosen somehow\nyeah I feel very grateful too yeah I\nit makes me sad that people I mean I'm\nglad people feel grateful but it makes\nme sad that we don't have enough time to\nget to you know everyone who has\nquestions but anyway that's not to\ndistract okay so the first thing that\nyeah let me just think for a second\nso the first thing that I want to point\nout is I think there are two separate\nthings here and I think part of the\nreason why it may be hard for you to\nmove on from contemplative is because\nit's almost like\neither option is good but they're in the\nopposite direction\nyeah does that make sense because I'm\nsort of noticing that okay one thing one\nway so let's take a step back and talk\nabout stages of change for a second you\nawesome PowerPoint by the way loved it\num so oftentimes when we look at some\nsomeone's motivation\nand their ability to change Behavior\nwhat we've sort of discovered\nscientifically is that there are a lot\nof cognitive stages that people go\nthrough before they can take action\nand one of the biggest problems that\npeople run into is that unless you\nunderstand where someone is in their\nstages of change\ncertain things may work and certain\nthings may not work so the simplest\nexample so the stages of change model\nreally developed with addictions\nand what we found is that people who\nwere alcoholics for example telling them\nto go to an AAA meeting and get sober\nand stuff like that which is like the\npreparation and action stage didn't work\nif they were pre-contemplative which\nmeans they didn't know that they had a\nproblem\nso giving someone Solutions like talking\nto a 15 year old kid who wants to be a\nCS GoPro\nand telling them that they can't stop\nthey have to stop failing classes and\nthey need to pass their classes isn't\ngoing to work because pre-contemplative\nthey just don't think it's a problem\nthey're like no I'm going to be a pro I\ndon't need to study\nso the first stage is pre-contemplative\nwhich is when people don't have Insight\nor awareness that a problem even exists\nthe second stage is contemplative which\nis now I'm aware that there's a problem\nbut I'm conflicted about it\nso there's a part of me that wants to\nchange but there's a part of me that\nwants to stay the same\nthen we move on to preparation which is\nwhen someone is like okay I absolutely\ndo want to change now we have to figure\nout how to change what's the best way\nmy biggest issue with what you're saying\nsnow is that I think your pre-contempt\nyou're contemplative in two different\nissues that lead you in opposite\ndirections\nso one\nis the value of money what is your\nrelationship with money\nthe second is whether you should have a\njob have a career change and burnout but\nit's almost like you're lumping those\ntwo together\ndoes that\nI think because the way I see it the\ncareer change relates to money because\nat the end of it it's about\nit's about like survival for me yeah I I\nunderstand I understand how they're\nrelated but do you see how it's kind of\nlike\nso do you want to change your\nrelationship with money or do you want\nto give in to your relationship with\nmoney and find a new career\nI think\nI think I want to does that does my I\nthink I want to change with my\nrelationship with money more a little\nbit more yeah but do you see what I mean\nlike I understand how the two are\nrelated but like\nwhat you're conflict so you have two\ngoals one is to change careers and one\nis to change your relationship with\nmoney right\nwell for like changing careers it's\nit's like a secondary or it's like again\nit's what I think I should do because\nI mean I feel like the reality is that\nyou have to earn you have to earn money\nto survive in this world unless you can\nlike literally plant you know like grow\nevery single thing you eat like you\nstill need to pay for electricity and\nstuff so\nit's like actually like to be quite\nhonest I don't want to work and I know\nthat's a common sentiment but\nI don't know I feel like the career\nchange is a little bit secondary\nwell but my relationship went with money\nis so strong\nthat it feels like it's\nit may be the thing I want to change\nmore but it feels like it's going to be\nharder and longer to change that than to\nlike you know just get a job again and\nhave some income yes so let me ask you\nsomething\nif you change your relationship with\nmoney what would happen to your job or\njob prospects or future\nwell I would be more relaxed about it\nbecause\nI'm like when I'm working to be honest I\ndon't I get money and you would think\nthat I would feel happy getting money\nbut I don't feel happy and I also don't\nfeel happy I feel very anxious when I\nspend money as well so I do think yeah\nthat kind of needs to change\nokay I understand that so what I'm sort\nof so why don't you tell us about your\nfeelings about money can you articulate\nthat a little bit\noh it's very complicated because\nI think maybe\nor maybe it comes across this way but\nlike\nI keep talking about it so obviously\nit's very like important in some way to\nme or it's like weighing heavily on my\nmind but actually I think of it as like\nhow should I say like I'm more towards\nthe anti-work side of things I don't\nreally like\num capitalism I prefer like Socialism or\nor you know the ideals of like sure\ncommunism could have been or maybe the\nideals of socialism like like I'm very\nidealist so I don't it's kind of like\nvery ego\nthis tonic\num my feeling about money okay it's like\nI care so much about it damn someone's\nbeen doing their homework I care about\nit\nI said damn someone's been doing their\nhomework\nyeah\negotistonic stages of change\nuh so so tell me how do you feel about\nmoney\nAfflicted so what's the conflict\nlike part of me\npart of me cares a lot about it anxious\npart of me I would say the fear can and\ncan you tell us what the fear and can\nyou tell us about survival and money and\nthe fear\nyeah it's like\nI guess\nespecially now because I've\nstruggle um with depression and anxiety\nand stuff so it's like\nuh\nI just lost my train of thought yeah can\nyou just tell me what you freak out\nabout when it comes to money\nyeah yeah sorry um\nyeah it's like I've I freak out about\nlike going bankrupt and like being\nhomeless and like buying in a painful\nway yeah okay okay good I mean not good\nbut but thank you for explaining that\nbecause that's what I'd assume but I\nthink we just need to make sure so now\nlet me ask you a question\nif you changed your attitudes about\nmoney\nand you are no longer worried about\nthings you've got savings saved up for a\ncouple of years you started chilling\nright you started to live this life\nwhere you're not working and like you\ndon't have to figure it out right now\nbecause you're no longer paranoid about\nbecoming bankrupt and homeless and dying\na popper you with me so far\nhow would you feel about yourself\nyeah I would feel\nI should say I do feel because like I\nhonestly I'm like going back and forth\nI'm living back and forth like between\nthese two states so I feel\nEdder I feel peaceful\nbut there is still that\nI know there's still that anxiety like\nand sometimes\nthat's the thing is like\nfor me it's like\nI feel like I've been make I do\nacknowledge that I've made some progress\num but\nmy current situation is like\nstrange and that I feel\nso like today I'm actually in a very\ngood mood or like pretty positive like\nfunctioning normally I would say so I'm\nnot in that depression where it's like\nyou know six months depression like\nstraight depression kind of thing I'm\nlike it's strange because it's not even\nit's not even hypomania\num I saw a psychiatrist and they said it\ndoesn't qualify as hypomania but it's\nlike I would say just a Level under\nwhere it's like within a month\num\nI\nI'm like feeling positive like right now\nI'm doing things like going outside\num you know like talking to my career\ncounselor trying to like\nhave informational interviews like\nworking on things then I think like just\nsome small negative things build up over\ntime and I think I have a problem I\ndon't really know how to like release it\nproperly or if I'm releasing it properly\nor maybe what's an example of something\nthat builds up\nlike a very\na small example that recently happens\nlike I just saw some spiders in my house\nand I was like\nI was I wasn't that angry but I was\nangry about it and then it's like a\ncouple of those small things where it's\nlike\nand I I don't completely berate myself\nbut I feel a little bit bad at like\nI don't know I was just angry about it\nso\nokay yeah I don't know but just those\nkinds of like small things yeah so snow\nI'm gonna\nI'm gonna go out is it okay if I kind of\ngo out on a limb and make a couple of\nassumptions and try to do something that\nI don't do often which is potentially\ngive you advice\nplease yeah\nso I'm noticing a lot of different\nthings the first is that it seems like\nthe way that you process your emotions\ncould be better especially when it comes\nto the piling up of small things\nokay so if someone has difficulty\nprocessing small emotional\ninsults let's say or attacks\nwhat does that mean for their work\nsituation\nif I have difficulty processing the\nfrustrations and challenges of work on a\nday-to-day basis what's going to happen\nto me over time\nyou'll burn out 100 percent\nokay\nso once you burn out\nthen\nworking is hard right\nyeah\nso this is where I'm going to say like\nI think it's going to be drastic for you\nto I'm not saying it's not possible\nbut it sounds like you have a certain\nvalue for money and you have a certain\nidea of what you should be doing what's\nyour ethnicity by the way if you don't\nmind me asking you don't have to answer\nif you don't feel comfortable with it\nbut I'm just curious I'm East Asian okay\nso you\nso the reason I asked I suspected that\nand the reason that I asked is because\noftentimes people from East Asian\ncultures will have a particular\nsecurity approach oriented approach to\nmoney\ndid you grow up in a household like that\nno I don't I think my grandparents yes\nbut I didn't live with them that long\nbut maybe I absorbed it like really\nabsorbed it and don't realize that yeah\nit's possible right so like this is\nwhere we have to be careful about\nethnic racial and cultural\ninfluences on an individual mind\nbecause just because you there have been\nstudies done for example on Asian\nAmericans and mental health where we can\nwe can do literal research and discover\nthat there are particular patterns that\nare like common to Asian Americans uh in\nin their mental health which are\nseparate from the average American and\nalso just because there are cultural\npatterns does not mean that those\npatterns translate a hundred percent to\nan individual does that make sense yeah\nso\nthe thing is I don't know that you're\nready to part with your security related\nto money\nwhat do you think\nyeah I think\nbecause I do feel that is quite a big\nresistance yep I know things logically\nlike\nit's it may be worth it or it's probably\nworth it to like you know pay for\ntherapy sessions again but like\nand I have I've had ex I guess the\nproblem is also I've had experiences and\nall my therapy experiences so far have\nnot really worked like with the CBT act\nmodels and even like myself\num\nthings I try to learn on my own\num I think honestly like you're the most\nhelpful so far but I'm still stuck yeah\nso that's yeah all right so I I'm sorry\nto hear that therapy has not been as\nhelpful as it could have been I'm happy\nto hear that you've been able to find\nsome help somewhere and also I think\nthat maybe the way we're thinking about\nthis is a little bit different so\nI I'm seeing a couple of different\nproblems the first is that if if you\ncan't process and it can't as a strong\nword but if emotional if you've made the\nobservation which I think is absolutely\non the right path that sometimes little\nemotional things pile up and you don't\nprocess them properly that will\nabsolutely lead to burnout in the\nworkplace\nnow the interesting thing is that if you\nwere to manage that and not feel burnt\nout at the work in the workplace\nthe interesting thing about that is I\nthink that could settle a lot of things\nfor you I'm not saying that you should\ncontinue to work for the rest of your\nlife even or that you should be a part\nof the capitalist system or whatever all\nI'm saying is that there's only one\ndumpster fire we can deal with at a time\nand right now what I'm getting the sense\nof is that in your life there's a\nConfluence of problems that are all\nhitting you at the same time\nso it's like now you're burnt out at\nwork and you don't even want to work so\nit's now a good time so like one\nsolution to being burnt out from work is\nstopping to care about money does that\nmake sense\nbecause if I stop caring about money\nthen I don't need to work and all the\npressure's off and it's like I'm fine\nbut that doesn't sound to me like it\nsounds to me like mentally checking out\na little bit and I don't think that's\nactually like a healthy way to deal with\nburnout\ndoes that make sense\nyeah at the same time I do think that\nyou've recognized that there are some\nattitudes towards money so I'm guessing\nthat because you have this survivalistic\nkind of Bend towards money when you want\nsomething and you can afford it when you\nbuy it you still feel guilty and can't\nenjoy it entirely\nyeah like if I because I bought some\nbooks and stuff and if I don't read it I\nfeel like I didn't use it so it's like\nand I I can give up so easily like I'm\nbuying things because of that yeah\nabsolutely right so so so Independence\nof the burnout and work stuff\neven if you're working hard it sounds\nlike you're not even able to enjoy the\nfruits of the capitalistic War Machine\nyeah right\nso like that's a separate issue which\nabsolutely needs to be solved you need\nto change your relationship with money\nbe a little bit more chill I think part\nof the problem though is that these two\nthings I think are absolutely connected\nbut I think they're artificially\nconnected like the solution to burnout\nis not to stop caring about money\ndoes that make sense even though they\nare connected we can see how they're\nconnected so in my mind I'm almost\nseeing two separate problems here Each\nof which needs to be solved it's just an\nissue of which one you want to tackle\nfirst\nand I wonder if part of the reason that\nit's hard for you to get out of the\ncontemplative phase\nis actually because you've got two\nseparate problems that you're linking\ntogether\nyeah like that makes sense and I do\nagree like\nI guess I have a problem with priority\nas well in terms of the two problems\nlike is it what you were referring to\nbefore in terms of like\nbasically the two paths I want to go on\nsort of right because what you're doing\nis you're you're I think both of these\ncan be solved but they can be solved\nindependently whereas what you're doing\nis linking the two and I think the\nproblem is that when you link the two\nthere's like two sets of values that you\nboth hold that conflict pretty hard with\neach other\nyes exactly yeah and so I think actually\nwhat you can do is resolve both of those\nvalues but the problem is that the way\nthat you set up the equation it's like\nthere's losses on both sides\nyeah yeah and and I think interestingly\nenough\nsometimes that's normal for\ncontemplative like if I want to give up\nalcohol\nthere are benefits to giving up alcohol\nand there are losses to giving up\nalcohol right that sort of makes sense\nbut in my mind there's like two actually\nseparate issues burnout and your\nrelationship with money I don't think\nthe reason that you got burnt out was\nyour relationship with money does that\nmake sense\nyeah I can I can agree with that so then\nthe question becomes if those if the\nreason you burnt out doesn't have to do\nwith your relationship with money why\nare you trying to solve that by changing\nyour relationship with money\nI guess so like originally I said\nthat was the\nor just to me I felt like it's more\nimportant\nto change my relationship with money but\nI don't know like from what you're\nsaying or not even what you're saying\njust like from what I feel now like\nand I think you mentioned yeah like\nmaybe if I solve the burnout and like\nget back to work but also it kind of\nchanged my mindset in some ways then it\nwill set me up a little bit better to\ndeal with the money I think so so let me\ngive you a couple of reasons for that\nthe first is like I don't know how to\nsay this but\nif I have let's say a a complicated\nrelationship with romantic partners\nsome of that stuff I have to deal with\non my own but I can't fix that problem\nby giving up romantic relationships\ndoes that make sense\nyeah like if I decide okay like I\nstruggle in romantic relationships so\nI'm gonna be celibate\nbeing celibate may protect me from some\nof the stress of a relationship but it\ndoesn't solve the relationship issues\nyeah so I don't know how to say this but\nall of your fears of survival and the\nsecurity that money brings those are\nhard enough to tackle when you've got it\nif you're not working for two years and\nyour bank account is shrinking month to\nmonth to month it's like an absolutely\ndo or die situation you're like throwing\na Hail Mary\nbecause either you figure this out or\nyou're completely wiped does that make\nsense\nyeah like\nI'm not so in Asics yeah yeah so so\ndealing with an insecurity ideally\nshould not be done by putting yourself\ncompletely\nat the mercy of the insecurity\nthe way that you develop security is by\nactually being in a secure place and\nthen tackling your insecurity it's not\nlike throwing yourself into this\ninsecurity headlong does that make sense\nyes yeah so what that means in terms of\nmoney is is that if you let's say you\ndecide not to work again and you just\nchill for a couple years you could do a\nlot of intense personal work and you\ncould come out the other side a very\ntransformed person\nit's absolutely possible\nI think it's going to be a bumpy road\nand you may not come out the other side\nin the way that you want\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nso almost what I would say here is you\nstart actually with little stuff like\nemotional processing on a day-to-day\nbasis and you really consider a career\nchange\nand then hopefully what you can find is\nsome kind of work that you find\nfulfilling and does not burn you out now\nif you need to take a break from work\nfor six months or a year or whatever\nlike I'd say go for it and the reason\nthat you save and this is where even the\nmoney part of you that's paranoid we\ntell the money part of you hey the\nreason that we've scrimped and saved\nover five years is that if we needed to\ntake a break we absolutely could\nand in order for me to find a career\nthat is fulfilling and for my long-term\nFinancial Security I need to take a\nbreak for six months to a year\nso you almost want to appease that part\na little bit\nwhat do you think about that\nso when I hear that\num\npart of me feels\ncomforted so that's kind of why I'm\ncrying but part of me the anxiety part\nof me like still kind of gives back like\nthrows back on\nI don't know like retorts yeah\ngood so you noticed that right so that's\nwhy I think it's gonna be really hard\nfor you to\novercome that while the daily pressures\nof unem being unemployed are pounding on\nyou\nyeah\nso I'm glad you feel comforted because\nthat's what we need to do right we need\nto not\nkick the part of you because the money\npart of you is actually looking out for\nyou it loves you it cares about you\nyeah yeah and also we need to tell it\nthat hey like sometimes snow needs a\nbreak\nwe've worked really hard for five years\ndoing something that we didn't really\nenjoy where we were suffering a lot on a\nday-to-day basis and we're kind of\nrunning on empty and we need a break for\na little while\nI know you're afraid\nI know that you're paranoid that will\nbecome lazy and it'll be a gap on our\nresume and all of these other scary\nthoughts that it tells you right\nyeah\nyeah and then you can say like yeah but\nwe're gonna just we need a little bit of\nspace because the old way wasn't working\nand we're going to come back we're going\nto be recharged we're going to really\nthink about what kind of career that we\nhave that is fulfilling for us\nand provides us with Financial Security\nthat's the end goal\nyeah\nhow does hearing that make you feel\nto be honest like that is kind of where\nI was at but\num\nI think what would help me in this\nsituation because like what's really\nhelped so far is you actually telling me\nlike\nthat\nlike dealing with the burnout is\nprobably easier like first of all should\nnot be\num conflated entirely with money and\nit's probably easier than actually\nfixing my relationship with money so on\nthat topic like for the emotional\nprocessing because honestly I'm still\nvery confused I've watched a lot of\nvideos and stuff but like could you give\nme some specific\nhe tells about like\nwhat methods\nI should use or like I don't know I feel\nlike I am using some methods but it's\nnot working as effectively for me yeah\nwhat methods are you using\nso\nso\nI've I Journal a lot\num\nI was like I guess my question here is\nlike\nis talking more effective like actually\nverbalizing\num\nversus even Whispering or like\njournaling or like typing what do you\nthink snow\npersonal thing but for me\nI think like talking\nmaybe I have to do some more\nintrospection\num or like analysis but\nI I feel like talking\nhelps me more but it's actually like so\nhard for me sometimes especially when\nI'm depressed like I just don't want to\ntalk at all sometimes\nokay has this been helpful today\nit has been helpful\num\nbut I'm aware or like I remember when\nlike I felt like this with some therapy\nsessions before and\nlike I kind of just fall into the same\npit again so that's why I'm trying to\nask for like specific\nsteps for emotional processing I don't\nknow because I honestly feel like I\ndon't understand\nif there is a best way or like yeah I\nshould figure out myself or like do you\ndo you think we processed some emotions\ntoday\nI feel like\nI feel like the answer should be yes\nbut I also\nmight be Alexa thymic or like just\npartially and it's hard for me to\nlike I don't know what it feels like to\nproduce your emotions yeah so let's\nunderstand what happened today okay\nso I I'm also getting maybe a little bit\nof an insight into why therapy is quote\nunquote not been very effective for you\nso I said a couple things and then you\nbroke down crying right\nyeah\nand then what happened\nwhat did you do immediately after that\napologize\nI don't remember that but maybe you did\noh I don't think you did anything wrong\nso then like we we like taught we were\ntalking about all this kind of stuff and\nthen like you're suddenly you sort of\ndid a 180 on me and you were like I do\nyou have any concrete skills for\nemotional processing and actually what\nwas helpful was when you told me to do a\nb c d like when you told me like okay I\nneed to work on emotional processing and\nburnout first\nso I think what's going on is that\nsometimes when you get close to\nemotionally processing you actually look\nfor some kind of regimen or solution to\ndo it instead of actually doing the work\ndoes that make sense\nso like right on the cusp of emotional\nprocessing\nyour logical mind actually takes over so\nyou step away from your emotional mind\nand you're like okay give me a logical\nplan to emotionally process\nand the moment that that actually\nhappens you move away from emotional\nprocessing\nyeah okay\nis that sinking in or no\nno I understand what you're saying\nbecause I definitely\nlike the word that comes to mind is\noptimization yes\nyou can't good to keep going\nbut like but then the problem is like\nhave I\nI don't know because my question is then\nlike I don't again it's like I don't\nknow what I should be feeling if I've\ntotally\nlike followed it through completely\nemotionally processed like is it the\ncathartic feeling after crying is that\nlike 100 or\nyeah so I I think I so I think if you\nget the opportunity to work with a\ntherapist I think you should and I think\nwhat you should do with that therapist\nis so this is tricky but sometimes I've\nhad patients like this some patients\nneed to be given Solutions on the\nsurface and then need the emotional\nprocessing to happen without them\nrealizing it\nso this is the kind of thing where I\nthink the the more you get closer to\nemotionally processing the more your\nmind is going to be like actually feels\nuncomfortable and then what happens when\nwe feel uncomfortable with emotions is\nour logical mind is like let's optimize\nbecause optimizing is safe territory for\nyou right you know how to optimize snow\nyou made a PowerPoint\nwhatever right so you had this\nPowerPoint ready you did your homework\nso like optimization being a good person\nin terms of doing your work and like if\nI give you an A B C D E F G and I say\nsnow do these things you will do it\nuntil you are burnt out and you can't do\nit anymore\nright but what you want\nis like pushed all the way to the back\nand then you end up burning yourself out\nbecause you're so good at pushing\nyourself what you want to the back oh I\nwant this\nI don't I want this particular shirt\nlet's say or I want this bicycle\nand then what you want in comes your\nmoney complex and your money complex is\nlike no no no snow\nwe can't afford that we need this money\nfor a rainy day so no bike for snow and\nthen here comes a rainy day where we're\nburnt out we can't work look we saved\nall this money for a rainy day and your\nmoney complex is like no no no we can't\nactually spend the money for a rainy day\non a rainy day we have to keep that in\ncase there's a rainy day\nright so it's like I yeah maybe I was\nsaving it for a rainy day but I don't\neven want to spend it yeah on the rainy\nday right exactly right so so it's like\nit's just it's weird because you've\nsaved it specifically for this purpose\nnow in terms of like what to do for you\nyou know I do think that this is where\nthere's like some concrete stuff about\nprocessing emotions so like journaling\nat the end of the day I think is useful\nthere's a particular meditation exercise\nthat we sometimes teach people which I\ncan share with you today\nwhich is before you go to bed it's kind\nof it's kind of I guess is our\nmeditation for the day\nbut basically go back so when we start\nour day usually we feel pretty fresh\nand then as the day goes on there are\nall kinds of emotions that come up that\naren't like worked through properly\nand so we get scared from the spiders\nand we have all these thoughts and then\nthen we get distracted right before we\nresolve the problem of the spiders we\nget pulled into something else\nso that leftover emotion gets kind of\nlike banked\nat the end of the day we've wound\nourselves up and sometimes people have\ndifficulty falling asleep because\nthey're worrying about all this\ndifferent stuff that's all banked up\nemotion that's been waiting to get out\nso there's a simple practice that you\ncan do which is what I call the\nmeditative rewind practice I think it's\nin Dr K's guide if you've had access to\nthat but I can teach it to you now and\nit's basically you go back you start at\nthe end of your day so if you're laying\nin bed and you go back you go backwards\nin time and go through basically each\nevent of the day\nand as you go through each event of the\nday you acknowledge especially the\nemotional impact of that\nso for example I was brushing my teeth\nbut my partner didn't put the cap on the\ntoothbrush so the first amount of uh I\nmean on the toothpaste so the first\namount of toothpaste that came out was\nall crusty and like dried out and I\ncouldn't even brush my teeth with it and\nit was really annoying because they do\nthat all the time oh my God and wow I I\nreally got frustrated with them\nsort of acknowledge the emotion\nand then\num\nkind of go to the previous thing so\nbefore that I had to do the laundry\nbefore that you know I had a a great\npiece of cake for dessert and that was\nreally enjoyable before that and you\nbasically want to go through all of your\nday and just acknowledge the emotions\nthat you felt until you end up with\nwaking up\nsometimes the practice takes five\nminutes 15 minutes 30 minutes for some\npeople it can take even a little bit\nlonger\nand that can be sort of like I it sort\nof like sort of starts you off with okay\nthe day started I was pretty fresh and\nnow I've like worked through like\nacknowledge for yourself that you've\nworked through a lot of what's happened\ntoday and now it's time to go to bed\nso\nso yeah I want to say I have heard of\nthis before\num I did watch it on the guide\num but when you say acknowledge\nlike you mean like\ndo you mean\nkind of like what you just did saying it\nsaying it in my mind\nand\nlike in a in a calm manner but not\ngetting hooked by the feelings yes\nexactly okay so so you'll feel some of\nthe feelings come up right and you want\nto just notice wow that really upset me\nokay and it was just incredibly\nfrustrating but then it is very good\nquestion so then you don't want to get\ncaught up in it\nso remember the purpose of the\nmeditative rewind practice is to be like\nsomewhat sequential so then like if for\nexample with the toothpaste example if I\nif my if I'm not careful then what my\nmind will do is be like I can't believe\nlike I've told them so many times and\nthey never listen and they do this and\nthey do this and last time during my\nbirthday they forgot this and then your\nmind is off all kinds of places and then\nit just ramps itself up\nyeah so you don't want to like engage\ntoo much but you want to kind of\nacknowledge okay wow like how did I\nreally feel\nin that moment\nokay so actually like labeling it yes\nokay yes right so one of the so some of\nthis stuff may go back to EQ emotional\nquotient and one of the key skills of\nemotional quotient is being able to\nidentify your internal emotional state\nso that's a very concrete kind of thing\nthat you can do it's a good meditation\npractice okay\nokay the other thing to just think a\nlittle bit about is you know if you want\nto take a break for a little while\nnegotiate with the money complex and see\nwhat amount of time it can actually give\nyou off if it's three months six months\nwhatever maybe it's still 20 23\nand then give yourself that time and\nthen what I would really start doing is\nis thinking about you know what kind of\nwork would you find more fulfilling\nand then hopefully also it's not just\nthe work because I think this is what a\nlot of the anti-work people kind of miss\nis that there are absolutely crappy jobs\nout there but you have an influence\nin terms of how happy you are at a job\nright this is where like like the\nbiggest problem with the anti-work\nmovement is that they assume that jobs\nare completely static\nand part of the reason for that I don't\nreally blame them for that because what\nhappens is because of the nature of\nsocial media and stuff like that\nthe most extreme scenarios rise to the\nsurface so this the what everyone is\nreading about are the places that are\nterrible to work\nthere's some places that are terrible to\nwork some places that are amazing to\nwork\nand the truth is most places are kind of\nin the middle\nwhere like most bosses actually want\ntheir employees to be like happy\nlike most bosses are not you know\ncapitalistic overlords it's been my\nexperience maybe I've been lucky\num but you know they want the job done\nbut it's like a lot of bosses like I've\nhad multiple bosses many of them care\nabout me as people as like as a person\nI'll still reach out to them I have good\nrelationships with them like those kinds\nof bosses exist\nso to think a little bit about okay what\nkind of career do you want to be in what\nwhat sort of work do you find like\nengaging\nand then also whenever you do decide to\ngo back to work or when you try to look\nfor jobs or whatever then start to\nreally consider\ndon't put up with crap just because your\nmoney complex tells you we need this job\nin order to survive\nright that's where you've got to start\nchanging the way that you behave at work\nand that's where like so for example one\nof the things we found in career\ncoaching is that what a lot of people\nbenefit from\nis\nworking out with a coach first of all\nwhat they feel at work that they're\nunhappy with and then practicing how to\ntalk to people about it\nso that when you go and talk to your\nboss you don't come across as a whiny\nentitled employee you don't like you\ndon't lead with your emotions right\nyou're not like there are there's an\neruption of frustration what it is is\nlike going to your Boston like sort of\nhaving a nice like pre-prepared thing\nthat's like hey this is something I\nfound really frustrating at work this\nperson in particular seems to like\npurposely I know it sounds kind of\nparanoid seems to be purposely like\ntrying to make my life difficult and at\nfirst I thought am I just being paranoid\nbut I've actually talked to these three\nco-workers who say that this person does\nthe same thing to them\nyeah at this point I'm just trying to do\nmy job I want to do a good job and these\nother three people are too but as long\nas this person is like sabotaging us not\nonly does it make it frustrating I spend\nbasically 60 to 90 minutes like like\ntrying to fix this person's problems\nand when you frame things to a boss like\nthat oftentimes the boss will like be on\nyour side it's just about communicating\nthings in a good way so I think there's\na lot about work that you can handle\nyourself\nand what we also know about research\nfrom burnout is that burnout is a\ncombination of individual things Plus\nwork things it's not created entirely by\nwork and it's not created entirely by an\nindividual\nso the problem is that employers think\nthat burnout is an employee problem\nemployees think that burnout is an\nemployer problem\ny'all should fix this because I'm\nburning out or mental health is your\nresponsibility as as an employee so\nhere's a subscription to a meditation\napp and hands off we're not going to\nchange anything about the way that we\nwork\nso the problem is that both sides are\ntrying to punt burn out to the other one\nwhereas in all of the interventions that\nI've done on burnout that have been\nsuccessful it involves a shared\nresponsibility\njust to give you one quick example of\nthat so one place was you know called me\nin to teach meditation\nand I was like cool I'm happy to teach\nmeditation when are we going to do it\nand they're like okay well their shift\nends at 6 PM so you can teach meditation\nfrom 6 to 6 30. and then I said uh\nif you want me to teach meditation it\nhas to be a part of their work day and\nthey need to be excused of 30 minutes of\nwork in order to learn meditation\nyou can't make Wellness\nan additional burden on your employees\num\nand then they were like okay fine\nand it worked out great surprisingly\nteaching 30 minutes of meditation did\nnot impact productivity negatively at\nall\npeople just got their work done in the\nsame amount of time they just spent less\ntime on like browsing on Reddit sitting\non the toilet not working\nright\nanyway this is kind of a tangent but\nthis just goes to back to this idea that\nburnout I think is going to be somewhat\nindividually influenced\nand if you can manage your emotions at\nwork and be super careful about\nsuppressing what you dislike at work\nbecause money and security\nokay so I think\nI I feel like I still don't understand\nthe suppression or emotional processing\npart but\nif I can\nif I can try to summarize and you can\nsee if it's correct or not then\nsure\nI don't know are you laughing because\nI'm trying to rationalize this again or\nno I'm I'm laughing I'm sorry that that\nwas I sometimes I wear my Expressions on\nmy face I was actually appreciating how\nconscientious you are about learning\nforeign\nI'm glad that you asked if it made you a\nlittle uncomfortable because I think\nit's awesome you're a fantastic student\noh God I think I lost my kind of thought\nbut it was something about rationalizing\nyou are gonna try to summarize emotional\nprocessing and suppressing emotions\nokay let me think sorry\nso yeah so I guess my takeaway is that\nI may have thought\nI was emotionally processing\nwhen\nyou know like was kind of either living\nthe emotion or even I I may have been\nable to notice it which sounds like\nthat's the right path\nto pressing it\nmay have come in when I started to\nrationalize\nto\nearly\nso I I guess like it's just like I\nunderstand the stuff about doing it at\nthe end of the day especially if I\nhaven't had time throughout the day but\nlike if I had time in the day like\nso I let myself\nbe angry about the spiders like fully\nfirst because I don't want to get too\nangry\nlike if I don't let myself get too angry\nis that suppressing it\num\nso\nuh\nokay\nso letting yourself I don't know what\nyou mean by too angry because that\nimplies it sounds like that's\nsuppressing so because you're using the\nword to which is the point is there's\nnot like an appropriate amount of\nemotion right there's just you feel what\nyou feel\nit's just what do you do with what you\nfeel\nso do you let it control your behaviors\ndo you let it control your thoughts\nor do you acknowledge it kind of notice\nit and then like the interesting thing\nabout emotion that is acknowledged and\nnoticed is that it tends to take control\nof you less\nthe problem is that when we suppress\nemotion\nit actually takes control of us more\nbecause when we suppress it we lose\nawareness of it\nand that's how you get people who are\nlike think they're super logical\nbut are actually like behaving quite\nemotionally\ndoes that make sense\nI just have one question is that\nso in the past I have\ntried to notice\nmy emotions and\nI guess the thing is because it didn't\nlike\nin the way it worked because yes like if\nI feel myself getting angry and I notice\nthat it does\ncalm it down because otherwise I'm\nfeeding into it but like you know by my\nthoughts\nbut in some ways\nit felt like when I noticed it when it\ncalmed down\num\nit felt like that was suppressing it\nbecause it was going down\nI think that's wrong right well so I\nmean so that's where I I think you\nshould\nfigure it out but it\nso in the maybe the reason it felt like\nit was suppressing it is because you are\nprobably pretty good at suppressing your\nemotions\nand so your primary coping mechanism for\nnegative emotion is suppression\nand so the end result is the same the\nemotion goes down the question is is it\ncoming back later in the case of\nsuppression it's going to come back in\nthe case of processing it shouldn't or\nit'll come back weaker\nit's so hot I guess it's really hard to\ntell though because\nyeah it's hard for me to tell yeah yeah\nso\nhopefully we'll have some kind of\nwe may do a stream or something soon\num I've been writing up a curriculum on\nemotional processing\nand originally this was slated to be for\ngroup coaching but we may stream a\nportion of it or something I don't know\nexactly what I'm doing with it but I've\nI've noticed that there's actually a\nneed in the community that no one ever\nteaches us how to process emotions\nyeah that would be super helpful to get\ninformation on yeah so I just have to\nfigure out how to break it down into\nsteps\num but I think for you snow a couple of\nlike key things to remember is first of\nall\nyou know I'd start with just being a\nlittle bit careful about trying to solve\nburnout by adjusting your relationship\nwith money I think these are both issues\nthat you're probably going to have to\ndeal with\nin terms of figuring out how to work in\na healthy fulfilling way I mean you\ndon't necessarily have to if you you\nknow if you really decide that's not for\nyou that's totally fine but I don't\nthink that burning out after four or\nfive years of working is a good reason\nto leave the workforce I I mean I think\nit's good reason to leave the workforce\nthen but I would not go completely off\nof working because I think that there's\na lot of value to doing stuff that you\nfind enriches the world\nand that's where I do believe that a lot\nof jobs out there\nlike do create value for people\nand it's about sort of figuring out how\nyou manage emotions to prevent your\nburnout and then hopefully once that\nsort of gets sorted out\nthen over time once you've got you know\nonce you're not dipping into your\nsavings then you can start to develop a\nreally healthy relationship with money\nI don't know I'm not asking for like a\nfull thing but like\nyou just have any\nlike quick\nor is it is it possible to have any\nquick tips on developing good\nrelationship with money like just a\nDirection\num I think a lot of it is uh\nis somewhat similar to stuff that we've\ncovered before in the sense that I think\nfirst of all acknowledging that that\npart of your mind is looking out for you\nit's not a bad guy that needs to be\nconquered\nso it's almost like trying to reassure\nit without giving in to it that's really\nthe goal\nright is to notice that okay like you\nreally are looking out for me but\nwe have four years of savings or two\nyears of savings I can actually afford a\nbicycle\nright like if I go from two years to\n1.98 years of savings\nyeah that's okay and like I deserve to\nbe a little bit happy and one of the\nthings that money is absolutely there\nfor security\nyeah and\nmoney is also there to like help people\nfeel happy\nand that's where I would even think a\nlittle bit about being like concrete\nwith it so like how much money would I\nhave to save in order to feel secure\nand sort of just really thinking through\nthings like that\nokay yeah because I thought\nor like it's so hard like I cannot\nput a number to it or it would be a\nreally yep like a high number\nuh maybe I it sounds like I'm doing the\nright thing in terms of like\nacknowledging that\nlike I do recognize that it's actually\ntrying to protect me so it sounds like I\nshould keep doing that\num it's not like that is the right thing\nto do\nyeah so I I also get the sense that you\nknow you've I mean you've come a long\nway from it sounds like where you were\nbecause even even today you're sort of I\nI think like you mentioned you're\ncontemplative right so you've moved out\nof pre-contemplative into contemplative\nso you acknowledge the advantages and\nthe disadvantages of your relationship\nwith money\nand that's that's actually huge so I\nthink if you just kind of keep at it for\na while and also like\nsome of that work is easier to do you\nknow you can't\nit's easier to learn Detachment from\nfood when your stomach is full it's\nharder to learn it when your stomach is\nempty yeah\nyeah exactly\ngood so it sounds like that's yeah so\ngood luck to you snow any last questions\nbefore you wrap up for the day\num\nno I guess there was that meditation\num\nI was just curious about like mantras\nlike would you recommend any for me or\njust go with like the OM chanting\nlet me think about that for a second\num\nare you uh uh do you participate in any\nkind of religious tradition snow\nnot actively by identify with Buddhism\nokay\nso I think I do have a general\nrecommendation it's just not something\nthat\nI can teach you\nso I feel like\num if you can get access to someone who\ncan teach you a Lakshmi oriented Mantra\nI do think that would help you\ncould you spell that out for me yeah\nl-a-k-a-s-h-m-i\n-k\n-s-h-m-i okay so if you're in the\nBuddhist tradition a lot of the\ntraditionally Hindu gods will have\nBuddhist counterparts\nor versions so there may be some kind of\nbodhisattva that is\nin the same\ndirection is Lakshmi the problem is that\nmost of my spiritual training is not\nfrom that tradition\nso I can't teach that to you\nbut I feel like that's probably what you\nneed\nwell\nwould it be harmful if I\nor it's I understand that you can't\nteach it to me but like\nif I found\nlike I'm trying to say would it be\nharmful if I did that specific one and\nnot like a Buddhist counterpart no no it\nwouldn't be it wouldn't be harmful it's\njust if you if you're leaning towards\nlike so for example like if you go to a\nBuddhist temple and there's a Buddhist\nmonk there you could go and ask that bud\nthis monk do you know a Lakshmi Mantra\nor know anything that's similar to a\nLakshmi mantra\nokay does that that's that's what I mean\nit will it wouldn't be harmful but I\nwould definitely recommend learning from\nan actual person who understands this\nstuff if you can like you can Google a\nLakshmi Mantra but yeah I don't I I've\nnoticed a difference between people who\nGoogle mantra's enchant them and people\nwho are taught mantras by a specific\nperson\ngot it okay cool\nthank you so much you're very welcome\ntake care of snow good luck\nbye\nall right\nso a lot of stuff to cover there I think\nit's um\nI think snow was a great example of how\na lot of stuff that's happening in the\nworld right now\ncan intersect\nright so if I if I want to develop a\nhealthy relationship with money that's\nsort of like a personal quest in here\nbut then that can you know developing a\nhealthy relationship with money can\nreally intersect\nwith work related burnout and sort of\nlike capitalistic socialistic whatever\nlike work environment kind of stuff\nand the interesting thing is that you\nknow as we go through personal conflicts\nand we have personal challenges at work\nsometimes what happens is we externalize\nthose\nto broad-scale things and I think that\nthat's\nit could be healthy up to a point like\nit's important to understand trends that\nare going on in the world\nat the same time we've got to be a\nlittle bit careful because\nwhen you sort of say I am unhappy with\nmy job and the reason that I'm unhappy\nwith my job is a capitalistic Society\nthat may be true but it leaves you with\nvery little actionable stuff\nso in medicine we've got this really\ninteresting principle which oftentimes\npatients don't understand which is don't\norder a test unless it's going to alter\nyour management so we never order tests\nor Imaging or anything like that just to\nknow\nwe only order stuff if it's actually\ngoing to change what we do so if I have\na 90 year old woman who may have uterine\ncancer but they're not going to be on\nchemotherapy and they're not going to go\nto surgery there's actually no point in\nordering the test because it's not going\nto change what we do right so that's\ncommon thinking obviously if the patient\nreally wants the test and wants to know\nfor other reasons and that's a different\nstory but generally speaking we want to\nfocus on things that are alterable\nthe tricky thing with a lot of this like\nanti-work sentiment is that there may be\nalterations like maybe you need to\nchange who you vote for and go vote and\nstuff like that that I think is all\nfantastic\nbut we also have to be careful because\nsometimes there are things that you can\ndo\nto affect how burnt out you are at work\nand we're not suggesting that and this\nis where the employers get tricky\nbecause what they'll say is that a\nhundred percent of the burden is on you\nif you're burnt out it's your fault in\nmy experience and actually the\nliterature supports this\nif you look at mozlok's original\nresearch on burnout it's sort of an\nintersectional problem right so it's\nit's the connection between a person and\na work environment that creates burnout\nso that's where there's some stuff that\nyou can alter and some stuff that you\ncan't and that's where like you fix what\nyou can and if you're still unhappy\nthere and your workplace can't\naccommodate the rest or aren't willing\nto accommodate the rest or whatever then\nyou should consider finding a different\njob or whatever\nbut I think what we've really discovered\nis that there's a lot that you can do in\nterms of how you communicate to your\nboss altering your schedule changing you\nknow setting healthy boundaries like if\nyour boss texts you at 10 pm don't\nanswer and they're like hey I texted you\nat 10 pm you didn't answer on Monday\nmorning you say yeah I'm sorry I I was\nconfused am I\nam I supposed to be working at 10 pm on\na Sunday night\nyou can ask them is that an expectation\nand that's where you know like if they\nsay yeah like obviously like you need to\nbe available on your phone 24 7. you can\nsay okay I understand that so currently\nmy contract\nhas this amount of work over this period\nof time listed so availability 24 7 how\ndoes that affect like compensation\njust ask right they're like oh like it\ndoesn't if you don't like it you can\nleave and if your boss responds to you\nin a way like that you could say okay\nthanks for clarifying I appreciate it\nand then you can start applying for\nother jobs\nand then you know you'll a week later\nyou're like by the way I'm leaving\nwhen are you leaving I'm leaving\ntomorrow\nhow can you do that to me surprise\nPikachu face oh well you said if it\ndidn't work for me I should leave so I\nit's not working for me so I'm gonna go\nsurprise Pikachu face\nright\nand then they're like no but like\nand that's where you could say look I\nI'm confused\nI you know you're not going to be angry\nyou so you're just like I'm confused we\ntalked about what my I was hired to do\none job you asked me to do something\nelse I asked about compensation you said\nit wasn't available you said that if I\ndidn't like it I should leave\nso I'm leaving\nand and that's it's not people are being\npassive it's not passive aggressive it's\njust setting a limit and sticking to it\nyou don't want to you're not punishing\nthem it's just okay these are the terms\nof work and that doesn't work for me\nso that's that happens sometimes anyway\nwe're getting off track\nbut the key thing here is that sometimes\nyou know personal stuff like my\nrelationship with money can kind of\nconnect with work related stuff and\nthat's where I do think that snow was a\nreally good example of demonstrating how\nif you do a lot of emotional suppression\nit's going to lead to burnout\nand that's where sometimes if I feel a\ncertain way it's not necessarily that\nthe job needs to change it right some of\nthat is just emotions that I need to\nprocess\nthat like you know like it's a\nfrustrating job like even if you work in\nmedicine which is a sort of a good place\nto work generally we it's bad in some\nways but good in other ways\nthere's still just a lot about the job\nthat can be incredibly frustrating and\nthat's what happens with jobs is like no\njob is perfect\nand so managing that kind of stuff and\nlike even communicating to your boss\nlike in a healthy and productive way\nabout what your needs are what your\nlimits are what you're trying you're\ntrying to understand the rules of the\ngame\nand stuff like that that's all stuff\nthat's really really important to do so\nI think sometimes when we really look at\ncareer oriented stuff we don't realize\nthat there's like a personal component\nto it\nand that's actually why we developed the\ncareer coaching program but you know is\nbecause we sort of realized okay like\nwait a minute this isn't just about\nnegotiation tactics\nbecause everyone's like okay here's a\nbook about negotiating where it's like\nhold on you need to understand how you\nfeel a little bit first\nbecause a lot of times what gets people\ninto trouble is like\nuntempered feelings at work right"
