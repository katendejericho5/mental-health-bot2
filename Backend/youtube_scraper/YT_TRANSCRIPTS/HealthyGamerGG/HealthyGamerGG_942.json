okay\num i'm from mexico um i'm an illustrator\nokay and\num and just to uh\ni don't know if that's enough\nintroduction\nwelcome karen\nthank you\num well uh now about the question sure i\nabout how i feel about my life\nwell i'm actually very happy with my\nwork life i do what i love and i'm\nfinancially stable\nthe problem is my personal life i have a\nlot to learn and improve um\ni'm currently very independent\nemotionally and seriously considering to\nask for a clinician to diagnose me\nbut i'm also very dramatic when i'm\nfeeling anxious so i don't know how much\nof it is my anxiety talking or reality\nwhich is uh which which is why i tend to\nmix up um both quite often\num\ni'm scared of being alone in the future\nbecause of this okay my friend circle is\nactually small and i worry that i might\nmight push my loved ones away if they\nget tired of me um i edited that last\npart because then i realized that it was\nalso my anxiety worrying about the\nfuture because i know uh\ni mean i\nmy first circle is is um is is form of\npeople that i trust very much\nand i know i mean they've been helping\nme a lot\nand\nthat's why i'm happy with my work life\nbecause\nmy sister and\nand my friend they they really support\nme but i feel like i just started trying\nto change and being a better person just\nbecause i depend too much on them\nand\nand i just like based my opinions on on\nwhat they say\nand it's like um\ni'm always looking for someone to depend\non\ndefend what\ni mean sorry to to depend oh okay i see\nokay so so when you say you're\nemotionally dependent can you help me\nunderstand what you mean by that\nyeah i mean\num\nfor example when i\nbuy something i'm always waiting to see\num how they react to what i buy or to\nwhat i\nwatch or\nor what i say to see if it's right i\nmean if i see that they like what i\nwhat i buy what i like\num then i think it's right\nokay\nyeah and i and i never question it\ni see and what do you think about that\nwell\ni i think that it's a problem because\ni mean they've been actually trying to\nhelp me with that\num doing things like um\njust asking me to\nto\nsay my opinion before them\nbut i see that\ni'm always like anxious\nwaiting\nlike it's a it's it's it's very it's\nvery tiring because i'm always like\ntrying to\nto guess it if i don't know what they\nthink i'm trying to guess\nyeah and i never i can never be relaxed\ni i'm always worrying about other people\nwhatever people think\nand it's very\nfrustrating i can imagine it sounds\nlike you want to be able to be\ncomfortable in your own skin and be able\nto make your own choices and be\nconfident in something because you like\nit\nyeah exactly yeah yeah that sounds very\ntiring\num i was about to ask you know what's\nthe problem with uh wanting other\npeople's approval but it sounds to i\nmean can you see other are there i'll\njust ask anyway you know what's the\nproblem with wanting other people's\napproval because you think of it as a\nproblem right it's just that it's very\ntiring and okay\nso\nlet's try to understand a couple of\nthings um\none is i think if you're if you haven't\ngotten clinically evaluated that's a\ngreat first step\nuh\nand at the same time i think that\nsometimes we think that getting a\nclinical evaluation or getting therapy\nwill fix all of our problems but what i\nreally find therapy is useful for is\nhelping us fix our own problems\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nso i think it's a good idea for you to\nget evaluated if you're concerned about\nit and this is the kind of thing where i\nthink like like you know most human\nbeings should probably at some point\njust get you know evaluated almost\nbecause we sort of do this with physical\nhealth where we'll screen people or\nwe'll have annual physicals right we\njust want to make sure that everything\nis working okay the interesting thing is\nthat\neven though mental health is up you know\npart of our health and well-being it's\nnot something that we like\nscreen for or sort of check in about on\na regular basis so i think that's a good\nidea\num\ndoes that make sense\nyeah totally i mean um\ni i think the the reason why i\nhadn't considered it before\nis that i was worried that i might like\nget um\nlike if if i get a\nbad psychologist that tries i mean i i'm\nworried i worry that i might try to\ndepend on my psychologist\num\nyeah so it's like\nyeah\nyeah so that's kind of tricky right\nbecause it's like here you are depending\non your friends\nbut if you get someone who's really\nreally good\nat emotionally supporting you it's\nalmost like\nmore addictive\nand then you're gonna depend on your\npsychologist because they're so good at\nemotionally supporting you\nyeah exactly so in a weird way seeing a\npsychologist could actually make your\nproblem worse\nyeah precisely\nyeah that you know and then then the\nquestion is and i think so i think\nthere's a lot here to talk about garan\nand i'd love to try to\nbreak down a couple of things for you is\nthat okay\nyeah okay so the first is i'm so glad\nthat you shared what your concerns are\nabout seeing a a mental health\nprofessional because that sort of makes\nsense right if my problem is emotional\ndependence and my goal is emotional\nindependence\nyou're like\nto see someone who is a professional\nat helping people who are emotionally\ndependent may make me\nprofessionally dependent\nthat's problem number one\nyeah so problem number two is so\nyou're emotionally let's say dependent\non your friends\nand then you're kind of thinking like oh\nbut if i like don't become independent\ni'm gonna burden my friends\nand then like what if they get tired of\nme and like i'm not being a good friend\nright does that make sense yeah yeah\ntotally but then the question is is that\nyour anxiety or is that legitimate\nright yeah\nit's like i don't even know like if i\nsay this is my anxiety and it's not real\nthen what i couldn't like but if i'm\nwrong i'm just gonna end up messing up\nall my relationships\nyeah\nbut\nif it is my anxiety i shouldn't give in\nto that because that's me giving in to\nmy anxiety and then like i'm looking to\nthem for reassurance\nand then that's just causing like that's\nmaking the problem worse yeah\nand so that like that's the tricky thing\nright so even if we think about like the\ntherapist there it's like what's anxiety\nand what is it\nbecause is seeing a therapist is that um\nyou know is that a legitimate worry or\nis that my anxiety\nbecause\ni can imagine that you maybe feel a\nlittle bit stuck or paralyzed\nyeah completely\nyeah that sounds tough\nokay\nso let's try to help you with this okay\nthank you so\nthe\nfirst thing to understand so we're going\nto talk about a couple of practical\nthings and then we're going to talk\nabout\nsome more like root\nsort of understanding the mind\nso\nokay this so in order for you to need\nreassurance from other people\nwell so let me ask you this\nwhy do people need reassurance from\nother people\num\nwell in my case uh thanks to to the to\nthe guide\num\nand your videos i\nand my friends of course\ni realized that i want\num\ni i need reassurance\nbecause i always doubt what i'm doing i\nnever know if what i'm doing is right or\nor wrong and i always want to be right\ni want to make sure that i don't make\nmistakes\nokay\nso there are two important things there\nthe first is where did you get the idea\nthat like where does your doubt in\nyourself come from\nwell\nso human beings usually aren't\nborn doubting right so if you think\nabout a child\na child will like do all kinds of stupid\nstuff because they don't really have the\ncapacity for doubt\ndoes that make sense\nyeah do you have a sense of when you\nstarted to like have you always been\nthis way or did you really start to\nbecome pretty anxious and doubt yourself\nat a particular time in your life\ni feel like it was when i was a a little\nchild\num\ni\nit's uh it comes from from both of my\nparents i i feel like in a way it was\nalways very confusing which was\nwhat of what i did was right or wrong\num the rules were always changing and\nwhenever i did something\nthat\nmy mother would think it was wrong she\nwould like if it was during a\nconversation for example she would like\num\ngive me like a little uh\nnot really hurtful but little kicks just\nlike to tell me under the table to tell\nme like you know you should stop\nand\nand i feel like i'm always looking for\nthat from other people like\num i i didn't even know that was\nsomething that was happening to me until\nrecently when i told my sister that i\nduring a conversation that i thought she\nwas uh trying to tell me something was\nwrong and she was like oh no i i just i\njust have a tick i wasn't trying to tell\nyou anything yeah and\nand that was when i realized that\nsomething was wrong\nand yeah i feel like\nsince then i'm always like looking for\nsomeone to kick me under the table and\ntell me to stop or do something else so\nso i think there there are a couple of\nreally important things i think that's a\nvery important story and garden i\napplaud you\nfor doing the kind of internal work to\nmake that discovery so that makes my job\nreally easy\nyou've already figured it out so let's\nunderstand a couple of other things so\nyou're trying to not make mistakes right\nso\nwhat makes something right and what\nmakes something wrong\ni mean i guess\nthere's not really something\nright or wrong\ni i know that i have a very black and\nwhite vision\nso\num i i guess it just depends on what i\nthink\nis\nright or wrong\nwell so so i think that's what's really\nconfusing is is what i'm hearing is that\nwhen you grew up\nyou were taught that there was right and\nwrong\nthe problem is that no one ever like\ntold you what the rules were ahead of\ntime\nright so imagine i have like a pet\nand i don't tell the pet\nwhere it's allowed to use the bathroom\nand then like one day it uses the\nbathroom and i yell at it\nand then so the pet feels bad and the\nnext day it uses the bathroom somewhere\nelse and like i don't yell at it and it\ncan never figure out the rules of the\ngame\nyep\nright\nand so what i'm hearing from you is that\nyou don't know ahead of time what the\nrules of the game are\nand so the only thing in the same way\nthat your mom used to give you kicks\nunder the table to tell you when you\nscrewed up you're still looking for\nexternal people to tell you what the\nrules of the game are\nbecause you don't know what they are\nlike yeah totally\nright and then when i ask you about it\nlike what are the rules of the game\nyou're like well there aren't really\nrules for the game and you're correct\nand that's why it's so damn confusing\nyeah like if you buy a shirt and you're\nlike i don't know if this is a good\nshirt or a bad shirt and you're waiting\nfor your friend to say oh that's a great\nshirt\nbecause like there's no you know is it a\ngood shirt or a bad shirt like\ni don't know you don't know like i don't\nthink you can\nlike it's a shirt\nyeah\nand so i think the reason it's so hard\nfor you is because you're playing a game\nthat can't be won\nright you're looking for an objective\nright answer in a world that doesn't\nhave objective right answers\nand why are you doing that it's it's\nactually because you were conditioned to\ndo that like you literally you tried to\nfigure things out and you're sitting\nthere and you're just talking and then\nyour mom is like kicking you under the\ntable\nand so your brain learned at some point\nthat like okay the one thing and so then\nimagine what hap what did you start\ndoing with your mom\nwhen she started kicking you under the\ntable you had no clue why what do you\nend up doing what's the one strategy\nthat you can do that won't get you\nkicked\nstop or sometimes i was just like\num i'm gonna be a rebel and do what i\nwant but i just end up doing the\nopposite\ngood but\nstill feeling bad you know yeah because\nyou want to do something right so so\nthat's really important\nso the winning strategy is to do nothing\nbecause if you don't say anything and\nyou're paralyzed and you don't act\nright which is what an anxious person\ndoes we're never going to take a chance\nbecause if you never take a chance\nyou're never in danger\nbut then\nwhat is that rebel that rebel is the\npart of you that wants something\nright there is actually a part of you\nthat knows what you like knows what you\ncare about and then\nwhat\nhappened to that part\nwell i think that part just it's like\nwhen i get tired of\njust doing what other people\nask me to do or well what i think they\nasked me to do because they really don't\nask me anything\ni just assume what they want or what\nthey think it's right\nso when i get to like a boiling point i\njust\ndo whatever\njust the opposite thing or just uh\nsomething like uh impulsive\nsometimes it's just like oh\nif in this moment i want to\num buy this super expensive thing i'm\ngonna buy it it doesn't matter what\nother people think it doesn't matter if\ni have that about buying it\nit doesn't nothing matters i'm just\ngonna do it and\nscrew everything yeah right\nyeah yeah so carl\nlet me ask you something how do you keep\nsomething from boiling over\nwell i guess i just have to um turn off\nthe heat or\njust like open the valve yeah right so\nlike if i'm if i'm cooking something\nlet's say i'm making rice and it's about\nto boil over what do i do\nwell you\num\ni don't know how to say that like you uh\njust take the lid off yeah perfect\nright so the only way that your rebel\nthe only way that your desires can break\nthrough\nis to break through\nyou don't let them out\nin a small way at all\nso the only way that you're gonna your\ndesires actually come out is when you\nget so frustrated\nwith feeling stuck and needing people's\napproval that you're like screw it\nand then all of your desires come out in\nprobably a slightly unhealthy way\nyeah\nand so i think the the thing here and i\nthink chat has sort of figured this out\nalready but\ni think this is the kind of thing where\nlike first and foremost i think you've\ngot to let your rebel out a little bit\nbecause you actually do know what you\nwant\nright so i don't really know\ni really know sometimes oh yeah you know\nyou just doubt yourself\noh well yeah yeah that's right right\nso so yeah\nyeah\nso so this is something to understand\nwhat you want your mind knows the\nquestion the doubt is separate\nokay yeah right like i want a slice of\npizza should i eat a slice of pizza\nthe desire is still clear though does\nthat make sense i want to slide a piece\na slice of pizza well let's try it yeah\nis it is it a good idea or a bad idea is\nit right or wrong to eat the slice of\npizza that's where your doubt really\ncomes in because once again you're\nlooking for an objective right or wrong\nand it's like you can cut like you know\nis it could you eat healthier things\nthan pizza sure\nbut\nyou're also like cara garland you're\ndoing pretty good you're you've got a\njob that you like you're working on\nyourself it sounds like you're working\nreally hard sounds like you're spending\na lot of time studying yourself and\nlearning about yourself and i'm kind of\nfeeling like you deserve a slice of\npizza or you deserve a nice purse from\ntime to time what do you think\ni i feel like i should say\nyes\nwhat i feel like\nwhat if i\nif i'm just doing it\num\ni think i'm starting to worry again\nabout ah good so keep going keep going\nyeah i i i was judging what i what i\nwanted if i deserved it or not\noh good so so you're on the right track\nright so here's what i want you to do\nso first of all huge props for noticing\nthat but what if\nright so can you finish the thought for\nus like what were you thinking when i\nwas younger\nyou deserve it you're a good person you\ndeserve to be happy in life and what\ndoes your mind say\nsaying you're not good enough yet to get\nthat slice of pizza\nright so let okay you're gonna get it\nwhen you when you know\nwhen you're good yeah so so and and what\ndo you have to do to be good enough\nhow do we satisfy that part of your mind\nit's never gonna be satisfied\nyou should be teaching\n[Laughter]\nit's so frustrating because because i\nfeel like\ni've been told this by my friends before\nand\nand i always let my mind away and i\nalways let the dog just get the better\nof me\nand what do you think about that\nwell\ni think that probably is because i never\npay attention to\nto what i'm doing\ni just let it win\ni don't\ni don't fight it i i would oh i think\nyou fight it a lot but\nbut i think this is the kind of thing\nwhere got on you you've gotta\nso you've got to be careful there\nbecause that thought right so i've heard\nthis a thousand times\nwhy am i so idiotic that i i never learn\nwhat are you doing there\nyou're kicking yourself under the table\nyeah that's right okay so like i think\nthis is where now the next thing that\nthat you can sprinkle in here\nis gonna be a little bit of compassion\nlike it's okay to lose to your mind a\nlot\nright like it's a journey you've come a\nlong way you have a long way to go and\nyour doubts are there for a reason\nthis is something very important to\nunderstand your doubts are actually\nthere to protect you\nright because what does the doubt say\ndoes the doubt say oh you're dumb you're\nstupid no the doubt says\nif you do this\nyou'll wind up being hurt\nyou see that if i if i'm too emotionally\ndependent on my friends i'm gonna drive\nthem away and then i'll be alone so your\ndoubt is actually trying to protect you\nit's trying to look out for you\nit's it's like\nso it's not your enemy actually\nright so this is where i want you to\nchange a little bit about the way that\nyou talk to yourself\nand sort of notice that you know it's\nlike a guard dog that's trying to\nprotect you\nand also not everyone who visits you is\nan enemy that the guard dog needs to be\nbarking about\nyou don't feel like that right\nso yeah and that's where like you know\nlike if you want to calm down a guard\ndog if you want to teach a guard dog to\ntrust you don't do it by kicking the dog\nevery time it barks\nthat's going to amp up with stress so\nyou pet the dog and you're like hey it's\nokay it's okay i'm worried about eating\na slice of pizza it's okay that like i'm\nworried that this is gonna be the\nbeginning of the end and like you know\nthere's a part of me that really wants\nthis so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna eat\na slice of pizza and i'm gonna tell the\nguard dog to watch while i eat this\nslice of pizza\nand i'm gonna ask the guard dog at the\nend was it okay that i ate the slice of\npizza\ni want you to talk to yourself in that\nway does that make sense\nyeah\nbecause it's operating on old\ninformation so what you have to do is\ngive it a new experience so get that\nslice of pizza sit down eat it the guard\ndog is gonna start barking be like hey\njust let me finish the slice of pizza\nthen you let me know if this is a\nmistake or not\nthat sounds great\nyou've really come a long way i'm i'm\nhonestly very impressed karen\nthank you i mean\ni didn't do this by myself\num thank you so much um to you and\nhealthy gamer and everyone comes on\nstream i feel like i i learn a lot from\nall of you and i'm very\nlucky to have my sister\nand my friend which always support me\nand ask me i mean such good questions um\nof course i feel like now i'm ignoring\nwhat i did\nwhat but yeah i\nthank you\nso let me ask you one last question\nkaren did you help someone else today by\ncoming on\ni i think i they i mean how does that\nfeel\nit it feels great\num i\ni hope that if anyone is listening um\nyou're not alone\nthank you so much for coming on you're\nmaking me tear up\nthank you so much for having me\ni really appreciate it take care\nseriously i appreciate you like i'm so\nglad cause like i think you did a great\njob of sharing with other people like i\nmean\ni think a lot of people have the kinds\nof thoughts and struggles you do which\nis what we're all about so thank you\nvery much for coming and good luck and\nenjoy yourself\nthank you\ntake care\nokay\nso let's just summarize real quick okay\nso anxiety is like is super tricky\nso the problem with anxiety is sometimes\nwe've got like social anxiety right\nand we're like okay if i'm emotionally\ndependent on my friends like i need my\nfriends for emotional support\nand like that's okay like that's what\nfriends are kind of there for but then\nit's like if you become too dependent on\nthem\nyou're gonna drive them away\nand then the problem is like well wait a\nsecond hold on is that my anxiety\ntelling me\nthat i'm gonna drive them away so that's\nnot like actually false and i'm not\ngonna drive them away but what if that\nis so if it's my anxiety i'm gonna\nignore it and i'm gonna continue being\nemotionally dependent\nbut that could sabotage your\nrelationship\nand so then you have to like stop for a\nsecond and try to figure out okay wait\nis that my anxiety so like should i\nbecome more emotionally independent or\nis this my anxiety or what and even in\nterms of like and so it's kind of tricky\nright because you don't know like\nis giving in to your anxiety being\nemotionally dependent\nor is giving in to your anxiety\nnot being emotionally independent it's\nlike i i don't know am i supposed to be\nlike conquer my anxiety and be a better\nfriend\nor am am i suppose\nit's just impossible to figure out\nand so that's where they're like a\ncouple things to keep in mind the first\nis\nunderstand that your doubt essentially\nrequiring reassurance from other people\ncomes from a doubt in yourself\nright so when you don't have faith in\nyour own conclusions\nyour mind naturally goes to someone else\nthat's the only way it works\nthe tricky thing is if you're plagued\nwith this cycle of doubt in yourself\nchances are that cycle of doubt was\ninstilled in you\nand what we heard today was that\nthere's essentially like a set of\nexperiences where like our brain doesn't\nknow what the rules are\nanytime a child grows up in a situation\nwhere the rules keep changing\nthey can't figure out what's right and\nwrong and if you can't figure out what's\nright and wrong you can't act with\nconfidence because are you doing the\nright thing are you doing the wrong\nthing if you know you're doing the right\nthing then you can act with confidence\nand so we sort of carry this thing with\nus and it's trying to protect us\nand what it does is it keeps us from\nacting it paralyzes us\nwhy does it paralyze us because if we do\nsomething what if it's a mistake\nbest thing to do is nothing\nbecause inaction is safety\nand then we start to feel very paralyzed\nand stuck in our life\nso if you want to get through this\ngod illustrated this beautifully\nyou know first thing is you've got to\nunderstand where did your doubt in\nyourself where was that born\nand recognize that that doubt becomes\nactually like a guard dog\nthat's trying to protect you at the same\ntime just because a dog grew up in a\nreally dangerous neighborhood and barks\nat everything that goes by\nthe dog learned the right lessons\nfor that situation but as we grow up as\nwe change neighborhoods as our life\nevolves and grows\nthe rules of the past don't necessarily\ntranslate to the present\nand so then what we've got to do is be\nvery careful on a moment-to-moment basis\nof paying attention to that dog and\nlearning how to kind of calm it down\nright it's not beating it up because\neventually what happens is sometimes we\neven cage the dog\nand we keep it far far away and then we\nsort of have this explosion and we act\nvery rashly because we're so tired we're\nso fed up of being inactive and being\nunable to move we get so frustrated with\nourselves for feeling stuck that we get\nthis burst of like uncontrolled\nmotivation and we make really rash\ndecisions that cause us problems\nand when they cause problems by the way\nwhat does the dog say the dog says i\ntold you so you shouldn't have acted at\nall i tried to keep you from making this\nmistake the solution is don't act don't\nact don't act i told you so i told you\nso i told you so and then it tells you\nagain and again and again you stay stuck\nyou stay stuck you stay stuck it builds\nup builds up builds up explosion and the\ncycle repeats itself\nso notice that doubt\nand the key thing here is that if you\nget an overflow\nof like emotion that leads to some kind\nof rash action the key thing there is\nyou've got to vent that out a little bit\nat a time\nyou've got to figure out okay like you\nactually know what you want you just\ndoubt that it's the right thing\nand so the way to move forward is to\nacknowledge that there's a doubt and to\nmove take a tiny step forward what can\nyour doubt tolerate\nwhat can the guard dog handle\nyou know it can handle a little bit it's\nlike watching very closely but we could\nstart with something simple\nlike okay i'm going to eat the slice of\npizza let's see how i feel about myself\nask the guard dog talk to yourself\nbecause it's actually looking out for\nyou it's not your enemy it's a survival\nmechanism\nand as you start to take these little\nsteps as you look at the root of where\nyou started to doubt yourself as you\nstart to look at the way that your mind\nworks hopefully you can start to take\nsteps forward\nyou can start to rehabilitate the dog\nrehabilitate that part of your mind\nthat's terrified that you're going to\nmake a mistake\nbecause at the end of the day whether\nyou have a slice of pizza today or not\nlike unless you're like lactose\nintolerant or you know gluten intolerant\nor something like that you can have a\nslice of pizza like it's not going to be\nthe end of the world\nand that's the way that you start living\nyour life\nif you're paralyzed by your doubts\nyou"
