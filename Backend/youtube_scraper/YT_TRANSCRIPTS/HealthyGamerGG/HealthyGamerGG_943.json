    "transcript": "you're basically trying to figure out\nhow to do the rest of being an adult\nyeah i know that's pretty broad no i\nmean but that's the whole thing right\nlike now that you're an adult like what\ndoes that entail it entails a lot of\nstuff\nand there ain't no school for that hi\nhello friend welcome\nthank you\nwhat do you go by\nuh my name is jackson\nhello jackson\nyeah\nthis is sort of weird i never uh really\nthought i was gonna get on the stream\nbut there you go\nhello and and so i what's the prompt for\ntoday again remind me\nyeah um\nso\nwhat i wrote was i\nfinally\nsort of am starting to feel optimistic\nabout where my life is headed um\nshocking i just graduated yeah i i just\ngraduated i got a job got my own\napartment wow oh my god crushing it yeah\nit just you know all sort of came like\nreally quick uh and i you know like with\nall that it sort of feels like the\nfoundation is finally built um\nfor you know everything else to start i\nguess you know now that i'm 22 and a\ncollege grad\num\nbut\nnow like i'm trying to figure out what\nthe best thing is to focus on next\num how to build a routine especially\nbecause i have adhd and that has sort of\nalways been an issue for me\nand\nthen sort of also how to continue\ngrowing rather than stagnating\nokay so first of all jackson huge\ncongratulations on graduating huge\ncongratulations on getting a job huge\ncongratulations on\nmoving in i guess moving into your own\nplace or you have roommates or what no\nthis is my own place oh my goodness dude\nyeah\nhow what luxury even i\nand so what i'm sort of hearing from you\nis that like you've done a lot of stuff\nright\nbut i heard one phrase that i thought\nwas actually quite\nheavy\nwhich is now i have to start working on\neverything else\nyeah\nso what i'm almost hearing from you is\nthat like someone told you what to do\nyou were like told like okay you got to\ngraduate you got to find a job you got\nto move out and so it was like pretty\nclear\nwhat you're supposed to do with your\nlife up until this point\nyeah but now you're not really sure how\nto tackle\neverything else\nbecause that sounds like a lot\nyeah\nwhat do you think includes what's in\neverything else\num\ni mean i guess\nmostly the the stuff i haven't done yet\num\nyou know that's that i feel like that's\nsort of self-explanatory but\num\nyou know i'm i'm 22 and i've never\nreally like\ndated i've never like i don't i've never\nhad a solid routine where i like\nactually sort of parent myself\num i've\nyou know\njust i i don't have like i don't\nconsistently work out even though i want\nto there's a lot of things like i want\nto do\nbut the discipline\nand\nthe\nyou know i guess knowledge of how to get\nthere\nhas always gotten in the way\nand now that i'm 22 and i have time and\nyou know i have a job so i'm\nself-sufficient i i feel like now i\nfinally\ncan\nyeah so that that's that's um\ni'm both\nexcited for you and i can see how this\nis actually like actually kind of hard\nyeah\nyou know because it's like oh like i\nhave all this time and i can do all\nthese things but like wait how do i\nactually get started how do i build a\nroutine how do i start dating\noh my goodness\num so\nlet me just can i think for a second\nyeah of course\nis there a particular\nokay so let me just try to understand so\nyou're basically trying to figure out\nhow to do the rest of being an adult\nyeah i know that's pretty broad no i\nmean but that's the whole thing right\nlike like that's that but i mean that's\nexactly the issue is that we're like now\nthat you're an adult like what does that\nentail it entails a lot of stuff\nand there ain't no school for that\nyeah i mean it actually seems like\npretty overwhelming\nso what do you\nuh let me\nlet me ask you are you\nfeeling okay about yourself in general\nlike are you feeling like you're gonna\nfigure this out over time or you kind of\nlike worried about this\num\ni i think in general i feel\npretty good about i think\nlike\ni think i'll i'll figure it out\neventually\nbut i don't know what eventually is and\ni just said i'd rather you know be\nproactive about it rather than like let\nit happen and figure it out when i\nfigure it out you know if i if there's\nanything i can do to make it happen i'd\nrather you know work towards that okay\nand when you when you talk about\ndiscipline\nhelp me understand what you mean about\nlike so it sounds like you want to\nbecome more disciplined what does that\nmean yeah\num\ni mean\ni guess\nthis was a really big issue for me\nduring college especially\nwith covid and everything um i\ngot diagnosed with adhd\nnot even a year ago was december\num\nso\nyou know i've i've\nalways struggled with\nthat discipline of\ndoing what needs to be done\neven if i didn't\nwant to do it or even if i did want to\ndo it um if i like just\nyou know doing all that\nuh was was really hard\num\nand i felt like\nactually the routine of waking up for\nyou know like in high school\nthat was really easy you know you you\nyou go up you you get up at the same\ntime every day five days a week you go\nthere for most of the day and then you\ncome back it's almost like a job and\nthen you get to college and you have so\nmuch more free time\nthat i felt like all of that\ndiscipline that i had was really just\nthe schedule\nthat was provided for me\num and\nwhen i had a class in the morning and\nthen a six six-hour break until my next\nclass that might have been at night and\nwhatever classes might be online\nyou know if i could just skip those like\nthose all of that sort of\nreally\ni feel like devolved my discipline for\nme like it really like disintegrated in\nfront of me um\nand okay\nnow that i have a nine to five it i\nthink it's a little bit easier now you\nknow because i have to be i have to show\nup at nine i have to be there until five\nso that structure is already built for\nme\nbut\nas in terms of what i do after work like\nif i'm gonna be productive like i i\nreally like there's been a lot of you\nknow it's it's been three weeks working\nat this job and\nyou know there's stuff around the\napartment i need to do that i need to\nclean i need to cook i like this you\nknow i do the dishes i need a vacuum i\nneed to uh research whatever i need to\nyou know like there's things to do\nand more often than not i don't do them\num not because i don't want to but more\njust because i don't have the discipline\nto\nmake a schedule for a day or something\nlike that you know i i've always\nyeah okay so that's that's sort of where\ni'm at\nfantastic jackson so we're gonna i mean\nnot\nno\nyeah yeah yeah okay\nso so that that's very useful\ninformation let me put it that way yeah\nso i'm gonna try to help you out and\nwhat we're going to do is first break\ndown i'm going to give you a broad plan\nof how to become an adult okay cool\nand then what we're going to do is\nactually focus on\ni'm going to kind of sketch out what the\nhouse is supposed to look like and then\ni'm gonna teach you how to put two or\nthree bricks together\nsounds good okay so the first thing is\nlike\nbroad scale speaking if you've been\nworking for three weeks i would not take\non a whole lot of other stuff quite yet\nso adapting to a new circumstance takes\nyour brain like somewhere between a\nmonth or two months\nso i'd say for the first two months your\ngoal is actually like the most important\ngoal is just that you show up at work\nevery day and you don't like screw up\ndoes that make sense\nyeah so like you know obviously you got\nto do dishes and stuff at some point but\nlike give yourself cut so recognize that\nyou don't have to become an adult within\nthree months of graduating college\nright like like by the time you're 25\nlike you're going to want to sort all\nthis stuff out so i'd give yourself\nhonestly a couple of years\nokay to learn how to like you know\nmanage an apartment like that takes time\nto learn how to like pay taxes\nlike that takes time like there's a\nbunch of stuff that's going to be on\nyour plate which your brain can only be\nlearning so many things at once\num and also kind of related to that i\nwould sort of put in order developing\nbasic discipline in a routine\nthen exercise and then tackle dating\nbecause the thing about dating is that\nfirst of all if you're not looking for\nsomething and you're just active and\nsocial there's a really good chance\nyou'll find something and also\nif all of that other stuff is sorted out\ndating can be rough\nand so you really want\nto have the rest of your life kind of\nlike\nsupport you\nin the sense that you can't deal with\nyou know things falling apart in other\ndimensions and deal with the stress of\ndating does that make sense that's sort\nof where i've been\nlike throughout college that that was\nlike i never really tried because i felt\nlike i always had something i needed to\nimprove on first\nyeah okay\nso that you've got to be careful about\nbecause that can you can do that until\nthe day you die you can exactly right\nthat's also why i'm like talking about\nthis yes i don't want to do that well so\nbut i mean i think you're well within\nthe\nyou know it's ok like i think it's\nreasonable for you to be focusing on\neducation focusing on like building your\nlife before you kind of dive into dating\num so let's talk a little bit about adhd\nfor a second okay\nsure so i'm i'm really glad that you saw\na professional it sounds like you got\ndiagnosed and you're in treatment or\nwhatever right is that okay good yeah so\ni'm gonna teach you just some general\nstuff about adhd\nso\nas you mentioned earlier you were in a\ncollege situation where you had a class\nand then you had some like self-directed\nlearning and then you've got this\nevening class\nand generally speaking the more\nunstructured\nyour life is\nthe more\ndangerous it is for your adhd does that\nmake sense\nso let's understand that for a second so\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nis essentially a disorder of attention\nso what that means is that your\nattention will have difficulty sitting\non a particular task\nso one of the biggest antidotes to adhd\nis actually like structure\nso in an unregulated environment where i\ncan do 15 different things\nsomeone who is neurotypical may be able\nto focus on the one thing that they're\nsupposed to do\nthe problem with adhd is in an\nunstructured environment it's very hard\nfor some people with adhd to focus on\nthe one thing they're supposed to\nand so that results in them like being\neasily distracted by the 14 other things\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nfrom a neuroscience perspective\nthe circuits of habit\nand the circuits of directing attention\nin transition points are completely\ndifferent\ndoes that make sense or do i need to\nexplain that more\nuh\ni can explain more\nyeah so\nanytime we're in a transition point like\nif i walk into a room\nand i sit down and i haven't started a\ntask i haven't sort of engaged in\nautopilot\nthat's a very vulnerable time for me to\nbe distracted right so if i sit down at\nmy computer like i can open up reddit i\ncan open up youtube i can open up a\nvideo game or i can open up my syllabus\ndoes that make sense\nyeah yeah once i open my syllabus i may\nstill be prone to some amount of\ndistraction but it's easier to read the\nsecond line of the syllabus than it is\nto open up the syllabus and make the\nfirst line does that make sense yes\nso the cool thing about structure for\npeople with adhd is that they remove\nstructure removes the ambiguity from\nyour situation\nyes the ambiguity in your situation is\nwhat really causes problems with adhd\nbecause you could do anything\ndoes that make sense\nyes\nso the first thing that i'm going to say\nis it's not about discipline\nokay so it's really about structure and\nyou may say to yourself are those two\nthe same thing no they're actually not\nso what you need to do is anchor\nactivities in a particular way which\ni'll go into more detail about what that\nmeans and that's how you're gonna get\nstuff done because the more unstructured\ntime you have it's like your adhd is\ngonna run buckwild all through this like\nunstructured time yeah okay so then the\nquestion is okay so then how do i\nstructure my day\nthat's where i what i would really do is\nanchor what you want to accomplish\nto things that you are already doing\nso for example if you want to exercise\nit's got to be do you commute to work\nuh a few days a week but mostly work\nfrom home okay so this is really\nimportant so when you say a few days a\nweek are we talking two days a week or\nthree days a week uh\nit's whatever i want technically so\ncurrently two but\nit's only been three weeks so i could\nokay\nso so this is the kind of thing where i\nwould really recommend like so if you're\ngoing two days a week i would like go to\nthe gym or anchor your exercise to your\ncommute\nyeah does that make sense\nso you can't\nif you can work out at any time\nyou you're gonna work out at no time\nyeah right you're gonna figure you said\nyourself that i'll figure this out\neventually but i don't know how long\nthat's gonna take\nright so we have to be careful about\nnebula stuff so what i would really do\nvery concretely is first of all focus on\nstructure\nformation and basically the stuff that\nyou are already\nlike kind of bound to do is where you\nshould add the next thing\ndoes that make sense\nyeah\nhow do you feel about implementing\nsomething like that\num\ni think\ni've sort of realized that like i know\nthe structure is what helps my brain\nlike good you know work\ni guess more like a neurotypical one\num\ni just always struggled with that first\nyou know opening of that syllabus like\nthat was\nthat was oh you know i always went to\nreddit or youtuber again you know that\nwould and then you know the next thing i\nknew it was 6 p.m and i hadn't actually\ndone anything yep um\nso\nyou know i think that i i realized that\nbut i the the hardest part for me has\nbeen like\nwhat time do i pick when it is\nunstructured when do i do it and i guess\nnow that it is sort of structured with\nwith you know the nine to five\nthat's sort of there that's the key\nthing right so so you can't so if you\ntry to create structure\nfrom nothing and you have adhd it's very\nhard\nyeah you can tell yourself i'm going to\nwake up at 8 a.m every day and i'm going\nto exercise and then i'm going to clean\nthe kitchen and then i'm going to cook\nbut without that actual like structural\nanchor right like you have to show up\nfrom nine to five\nthat's a structural anchor which your\nadhd brain\ncan't fight against does that make sense\nso the way to do it is like you're\nalmost gonna build like\nyou know like i don't know if you've\nseen these cities that have\nyou know like slums that kind of spread\nout not even slums but like suburbs that\nspread out you've got the city center\nand then we like move out a little bit\nto the east and move out a little bit to\nthe north and then move out to like\nsouth and then like we keep on creeping\noutward from this base and then\neventually we have a sprawling\nmetropolis\naround us you kind of familiar with that\ni don't know if you play like sieve or\nthings like that but all the space so\nwhat you need to do basically with your\nlife is like struck build structure the\nsame way which is that you can't just\ncreate structure out of nothing like you\ncan't just like create a palace in the\ndesert you've got to build it on if you\nhave adhd especially you've got to build\nthat onto other things so that's where\ni'd even say like if you go into the\noffice two days a week\ni don't know what your exercise\nsituation is like if you've got a home\ngym or you've got a gym at your\napartment complex or you you want to get\na gym membership or whatever\nbut what i would really try to do is\nanchor what you want to accomplish to\nexisting structure\ngotcha\ndo you think that's going to be helpful\nand if if you say no then that's fair\nthat makes a lot of sense i think\nthat\ni i never really\nquite thought of it that way but i think\nlike even just think of it now that like\nin my head that\ni i was like i am the most\nlike prone to doing like to working out\nafter i like get home from commuting\nthat i am if i just work from home\nall eight hours in the day and like just\ni get up from my desk you know that's\nyeah 100 right so so that's where if\nyou're gonna work out at home that's\nwhere i'd say like then you should go\ninto the office three days a week\nand i know it's weird because it's like\noh my god i can work from home\nbut like if if that's what you have to\ndo to start building that structure and\nthen if you do that often enough and\nyour brain makes a habit\nthat's the really interesting thing so\nwith adhd\nthe habit circuitry is completely\ndifferent so like it's not like so\njackson when you brush your teeth do you\never get distracted once you start\nbrushing your teeth or do you finish\nbrushing your teeth once you get started\ndistracted\nyou get distracted brushing your teeth\nso sometimes i guess that's that's\nfantastic but you finish brushing your\nteeth right yeah i always finish yeah\nbut like do you stop in the middle and\ndo other things\nno oh i guess i do other things while i\ndo it i don't know okay but you're still\nbrushing your teeth right yeah i guess\nyeah okay okay yes\ni don't know\nlike like so you know i know you'll be\non your phone or whatever but like\nmy point is that the teeth brush thing\nbrushing has some amount of like\nautomaticity to it right yes yeah and so\nlike once you start brushing you may get\nmentally distracted but the teeth\nbrushing behavior continues gotcha and\nthat you may find the same thing even if\nyou exercise which is like if you get\nhome at 5 00 pm if you get home at 5 30\nevery day\nand like let's say monday wednesday\nfriday you get home at 5 30 or\nmonday wednesday thursday right because\nhe wants to go into the office on friday\nyeah\nbut and so you get home at five you work\nout or you work out on the way home\nwould be even better if you can somehow\nswing that\nbut if you can't you know no sweat or\nwhat you want to do is if you have like\na workout buddy and you go to the gym so\nthat kind of structure can be really\nuseful\nand and basically you've got to create\nthat structure for yourself but you\ncan't create that structure in a vacuum\nthat's the big thing that a lot of\npeople miss is they're like i just need\nto wake up at 8 a.m every day and what i\nneed is discipline no no no you want to\ntake what you're all what is already\nstructured in your day and then tack on\nthe workout before that or after that\nokay\num\nand then i think the rest of the stuff\nwill come like once you learn that\nprinciple and you start baking in that\nprinciple then you can start adding\nadditional stuff like when are you going\nto do your dishes so like what do you\nthink would be a good plan for your\ndishes\nuh i mean currently i just sort of try\nto do it before i go to bed\nuh i feel like probably like you know\nwhatever accumulates do it after i\nfinish eating dinner would probably be\nbetter but\num\ni'm not really like even then like\nbecause i i'll do work and then i'll do\nsomething else then i'll remember i need\nto eat and then i'll make dinner and\nthen i'll you know be doing something\nelse while i eat dinner and i'll just\nget sidetracked until it's like\nalmost time to go to bed and then i\ndon't really want to do the dishes yeah\nso so your plan is probably not going to\nbe very successful because i'm not\nhearing that you're anchoring doing\ndishes to some kind of structure exactly\nso what's some kind of structure that\nyou could anchor the dishes to\num\ni suppose i mean\ni could always just do them in the\nmorning before work\nright so that's something where like do\nyou wake up with enough time to do the\ndishes before you go to work\nyeah\nokay so so i you know i think that makes\nsense so if you like clock in at 9 00\na.m\nthen what i would do is like spend like\n20 or 30 minutes before that like\nstraightening things up\ndo you think that's something you could\ndo\nyeah\nchat is suggesting that you do dishes\nwhile you brush your teeth oh yeah\nthat's a good idea\num but yeah i i know it sounds almost\nkind of like too simple jackson but it's\nweird because you really do have to\nunderstand\nhow your brain with adhd works\nand you basically have to recruit you\ncan't rely on like attentional\nfluctuation\nlike that your mind and any of these\ntransition periods will just do the\nright thing because you'll just get\ndistracted so what you've got to do is\nreally tack onto that existing structure\ncool\ncool\nam i going to learn about this in the\nadhd\npart of the the\nyou're going to learn a ton i don't know\nthat this is something that we teach\nspecifically in that which is good\nbecause you learned this from me now\nextra right so the the other stuff\nyou'll learn a lot about like\norganization hopefully you'll learn a\nlot of good stuff i mean yeah i hope so\nbut i pre-ordered it so cool well you're\ngonna get it for free now so\nyou know\nyeah\nthanks for pre-ordering anyway we really\nappreciate it\nyeah\nall right take care man anything else um\ni don't think so i think that that's the\nbiggest struggle i've had recently so i\nreally appreciate it\nall right take care\nyeah you too\nall right so just quick summary so this\nis something to understand about adhd\nif you have a neurotypical brain\nyou can sort of direct your attention\nduring transitions so if i like take a\nshower for example like when i'm done\ntaking a shower and i get dressed like i\ncan tell my mind okay it's time to start\nworking i sit down at my computer i open\nup my work\nthis happens to all of us but it's\nreally easy to get distracted on a\ncomputer right so like we can open up\nreddit or open up social media or\ntwitter or whatever like it's so easy to\nget distracted\nwe especially get distracted during\ntransition points so during transition\npoints is where there's a circuit in\nyour brain that's like okay i could\nstart working or i could get a really\nquick hit of dopamine let me just get a\nsuper quick just to taste\njust a taste of that twitter let me just\nget a taste of it and just\nright and so we kind of like\nand if you've got adhd that that\nstruggle is way harder to deal with\nso how do we tackle this kind of\nsituation if you want to build\ndiscipline in your life\nit's not so much about discipline\nespecially if you've got adhd because\nyou're not going to be able to force\nyour mind into something does that make\nsense because when we think about\ndiscipline we're talking about using\nwillpower consistently over time to\ndirect our mind in a particular way do\nwe want to eventually build that\nabsolutely the key thing about someone\nwho has adhd is that their habit\ncircuitry is still generally speaking\nrelatively intact\nso we actually want to do if you want to\ndo something new and you've got adhd we\nwant to build off of some kind of\nexisting structure\nso for example working out when we're\ndriving home because once we get home\nit's like all bets are off right i'm\ngonna randomly do this for a while i'm\ngonna randomly do this for a while i'm\ngonna randomly do this for a while and i\nwon't be able to direct my mind\nbut if i get in my car when i i'm\nleaving work and i put in my gps the\naddress to the gym\nand i go straight to the gym i have my\nbag packed i work out or even if i\nforgot my bag because i've got adhd i'm\nstill gonna work out\nright or i'm gonna keep a spare set in\nthe car\nor all kinds of other stuff i'm going to\nwork out on my way home and then what's\nmagical is if you do that long enough\nthen you'll start to entrain a habit\nokay so that's a key tip for people with\nadhd is that you don't want to sort of\nrely on forcing your mind to do the\nright thing during a transition you\nactually want to build off of existing\nstructure to accomplish what you set\nyour mind or what you want to\nyou"
