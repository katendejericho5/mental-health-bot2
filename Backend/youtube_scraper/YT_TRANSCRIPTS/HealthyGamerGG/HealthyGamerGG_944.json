    "transcript": "20 hours to read a chapter like you are\nworking so much harder than everyone\nelse who's getting an a in astronomy\nbecause they're not studying for 20\nhours on a chapter and that sucks but it\nain't your fault the world is too\ndemanding\ni genuinely do not understand\nhow humans do it all\nso much that is that is expected of me\nwhile there is not enough time\ni am currently enrolled in a summer\nclass\nwhich means four chapters of astronomy a\nweek being a slow learner it takes me\nover 20 hours a chapter leaving me with\na failing grade despite my attempted\ncommitment\ntopple that with work laundry cleaning\ncooking grocery trips socializing sleep\nexercise therapy grooming meditation etc\ni have no time to draw\nwhich is what i'm going to college for\nin the first place\nlet's not forget that all the other\ntedious tasks i've been putting on the\nback burner such as getting my screen a\nphone screen replaced hey me too i don't\nknow if y'all can see that but that's\ncracked\nor studying for the part exam i get\ncalled irresponsible constantly and\nfalls short in every regard my boss told\nme the other week\ni i did work in school for five years\nthere's no reason you can't\nbut all that did is make me feel\ninvalidated and less than how does the\naverage human being do it all\nso this is tough\nbecause\nsometimes it really feels like the world\nis too demanding\nlike we've got to be like functional\nhumans right so we've got to like\nwork so it sounds like this person has a\njob\nhave to do laundry have to do cleaning\nhave to cook because we want to like eat\nhealthy have to go to the grocery store\ngot to maintain my social\nsocial circle so i don't feel lonely and\nby the way i have to sleep somewhere in\nthere exercise somewhere in there get\ntherapy for my mental\nyou know gotta like groom myself\nmeditate do all these things for\nself-care work study this sounds brutal\nby the way taking 20 hours a chapter\nsounds\nlike\nunsustainable\nby the way that sounds terrible\nbut it does feel like the world demands\ntoo much from us\nright\nlike it feels that way so like is it\nthat way or is this just like all in my\nhead right because your boss is like\nback in my day\ni was able to work i only i worked on\npaid for my entire college\nbecause my college cost 13 cents a\nsemester and i made there was minimum\nwage back then was one dollar an hour\nand now it's like seven dollars an hour\nyou all making seven times as much money\ni had to work i didn't even have so i\ndidn't take a single dollar student loan\ndebt\nback in my day\nso it feels like the world demands too\nmuch of you but does it actually like is\nis that really what's going on or is it\nlike are we just like is it too much to\nhandle for us are we just like not able\nto handle it\nand i think actually the world demands\ntoo much\nso it's tough because the more you look\nat what the world wants you to do\nit seems to be increasing\nright so like let's let's just like look\nat this for a second i don't know if you\nguys have seen this we all seen these\nentry-level positions that require two\nyears of experience\nlike what\nentry-level position requires two years\nof experience\nwe're starting to see i don't know if\nyou guys have noticed this but if you go\nto like linkedin what you'll see is that\nthere's like an inflation of credentials\ninflation doesn't just affect money in\ncurrency it affects credentials\nso like back in the day you could get a\njob with a high school degree if you\nwanted a good job you had to get\ngo to college\nand now if you want to teach\nyou have to have a master's degree\nso like over time\nthe world is like literally demanding\nmore of us and you'll see this if you go\nto linkedin because people will have all\nkinds of letters after their name\nit's like\n20 years ago you had like a couple\nletters\nlike you had an esquire but now we see\nthis especially in medicine where like\nyou'll get all these weird kind of you\nknow aprn abpn\nfunctional 4mm\na 4fmm\nmd mph phd those are the old ones right\nand now we've got like all of these\nall of these additional letters\na couple years ago\ni was someone was inviting me to was\nwondering could i teach meditation\nand i was like sure i'll come and teach\nmeditation they're like by the way are\nyou a certified meditation teacher\nand i was like\nno\nthey're like you haven't done any\ncertifications and i was like no\ni went to india i hung out in the\nwilderness\nwith like monks\nfor a couple months or years\nbut i didn't get no certificate\nlike\nyou know this this weird dude whose name\ni don't know who's a monk who is like\nliving out in the wilderness like they\ndidn't give me a piece of paper\nthat wasn't a part of it\nright i'm a certified yoga teacher\ni got a certificate for that\nbut there wasn't like a meditation\ncertification it was like after you do\nyour your yoga certification for those\nof y'all that like were really good at\nyoga you got invited to go study with\nthe dude in the woods\nand so i went and studied with the dude\nin the woods for like three months\ni'm pretty sure i can teach this class\ni'm pretty sure that\ni will be able to teach a lot about\nmeditation but i have no certificate\nso here's what's happening in the world\nthings are getting more mass produced\neverything is becoming more\nmass right it's just growing\nso back in the day when i was like\ntrying to date i would like go on let's\nsay a dozen dates with a dozen people\nbut with the advent of online dating now\ni can look at a thousand people instead\nof just 10.\nnow job applications we get\nyou know\nlike the number of job applications that\npeople are getting astronomically rises\nthe number of jobs that you're applying\nto astronomically rises\nso everything is getting more and more\nmass\nthe world demands too much of you\nand that's because like what's happening\nis\nas i get a thousand applications\nhow am i if i'm an employer how am i\ngoing to filter them because i can't\nreally look at who you are right i don't\nreally care about you\ni care about all the boxes you're going\nto check\nbecause that's the simplest way\nand so what's happening in our society\nis we're starting to use\nmore and more proxies instead of like\nunderstanding who a person is\nis this person\na good fit for the job\nwell i have a thousand applicants and\nthe more applicants the better by the\nway right because that means we can be\nmore selective and we can find the best\nperson\nso if we have a thousand applicants well\noh a hundred of them have a master's\ndegree\n800 of them have a bachelor's degree and\n100 of them has has a high school degree\nthat's pretty easy we're just going to\nknock out the 900\nand now suddenly we have\ncredential inflation\nwhere what used to be good enough with a\nbachelor's degree now you need a\nmaster's degree just to be competitive\nand now if you think about it a hundred\nyears ago\nthere were no demands for collegiate\neducation\n30 years ago 40 years ago there was a\ndemand for a bachelor's degree now the\ndemand on you has literally increased\nwhat you used to be able to get with\nfour years of your time you now have to\nspend six years of your time sorry\nthat's seven six years of your time\ndoing\nsome master's degrees are three years so\nthere's seven\nand now as a world like right so like\nwe've got negative effects of social\nmedia\nand technology\nand now the whole world is a little bit\nmore depressed so now therapy gets\ntacked on\nand now in order to manage\nall of the stresses of life because\nremember that it's not like the job has\ngotten easier right\nso i remember there was this calvin and\nhobbes comic where calvin's dad\nis railing because a rush job used to be\nlike a two or three day turnaround\nand now a rush job is like overnight\nand now a rush job is within the hour\nlike\nso literally the pace of things is\nincreasing the amount of investment that\npeople are asking you to make is like\nobjectively increasing\nbecause now if you want to date like you\ncan't not exercise and be soldier\nright you got to have ripped abs and you\ngot to be this thin and you got to be\nthis handsome and you got to do this and\nyou got to do this and you got to do\nthis\nand by the way people are using filters\nnow\nso everyone looks better\nand so now like you're competing against\nlike a standard that is artificially\nenhanced through computers\nso the world demands too much like\nactually yeah\nyeah\ni'm gonna go and say objectively yes\ni don't think it's like weakness on your\npart\nlike like seriously like if i'm wrong\nabout this like\nlike tell me i'm wrong\ntell me that\ntell me that if i get a master's degree\nin education and i want to i'm\npassionate about being a teacher that\ni'm going to get a better starting if i\nif i in in school for six years\ntell me i'm going to make more than 40k\na year\nhis starting salary after six years of\neducation\nso everyone just wants more\nand then what happens is you try to\nfulfill all these things right so then\nwhat happens is like if you look at like\ndating profiles and stuff right you\ngotta check all these boxes you gotta be\nthis tall make this much money\nhave physical characteristics that are\nso many inches\ncan't have kids\nyou got to be okay with my kids you got\nto have your own car you got to have\nyour own apartment\nyou got to make this much money you got\nto be okay with me being unemployed\nright\nand that's sort of assuming like a male\nto female kind of thing it's no better\nfor women\nbecause men are out there being like i\nexpect you to cook i expect you to clean\ni expect you to do this i expect you to\ndo that\ni expect you to be available for me\nbut i'm not going to be available for\nyou\nright and these are the worst specimens\nof each gender for the most part most\nhuman beings\nmale non-binary\nfemale we're all like decent human\nbeings who are willing to put into a\nrelationship and are willing to like you\nknow hoping to get something out of it\nthe problem is that the world doesn't\nmake us think that way\nand the more demands that jobs\nare dating profiles or other things put\non us\nthe more we try to live up to them\nright because now i got to be this and i\ngot to be this and i got to be this and\nyou could sort of see it right here\nright you can see it\n20 hours of chat that sounds rough\nand then failing on top of that and then\nyou got to do all this stuff\nand then let's not forget like getting\nyour phone screen replaced stunning for\nthe pert exam i don't know what that is\nbut okay\nright and then your boss is like\namerican marty\nso you try to actually do all that stuff\nright you try to make your boss happy\nyou try to exercise you try to meditate\nbecause you got to be like a good human\nbeing you got to take care of yourself\ngotta accept responsibility\nand then what ends up happening is you\nlose yourself in the process\nbecause you're trying so hard to become\nthis thing\nyou're trying to take who you are and\nmold it into\nwhatever the check boxes of the job that\nyou're applying or your boss wants or\nthe person you're trying to date or\nwhatever\nbecause this is what the world is\ndemanding of us right it's demanding for\nus to be more\ni need you to be more than you are i\ndon't care about you i need you to check\nall these boxes and every year that goes\nby there's going to be one more box that\nyou got to check\nbecause of the mass nature of things\nand so you start to lose yourself\nand then you start to burn out and then\nyou don't even know who you are what you\nwant because you spent your whole life\nmolding yourself\ninto what other people want\nyou checked this box to make your boss\nhappy make check this box to make your\ndate happy you checked this box to make\nyour parents happy\nand then you're lost\nmaybe even you succeed\nbut boy was it tough boy did you have to\nspend 20 hours on each chapter of\nastronomy\neven if you succeed in the end and you\npass the class it's like oh my god was\nit even worth it\nand then we end up sometimes we end up\nin in a place where it's like in the\nworst case scenario we're like\ncompletely burnt out don't feel like\ndoing anything and even in the best case\nscenario we have a successful career\nwe're dating someone who on paper is\nlike a good fit and my parents like but\nlike the relationship feels kind of\nempty to me\nmy partner is like really really\nemphasizing like that you know it's\nreally important that i continue to grow\nand be better and whatever because they\nwill have all these financial demands on\nus and things like that\nright it's really important that i make\nmoney because they've got all these\ncrypto ideas that they need to invest in\nand like they're going to double it and\ntriple it and 10x but they're not going\nto work they need me to work so that i\ncan pay the bills and stuff while they\ndo the crypto\nand sometimes you even feel trapped in a\nlife that other people around you are\nlike oh wow you're so lucky and you're\nlike i don't feel lucky\nbut you're not allowed to say that\nbecause you're one of the lucky ones\nand your partner is so successful and so\nintelligent and you have such a good job\nyou work at google so no being depressed\nfor you\ndo you know how many people\nwould want to work at google\nand so in both of these scenarios what's\ngoing on we've lost ourself\nbit by bit\nwe've taken a piece of ourself\nwe've squashed it\ntrimmed it\nshaped it and stuck it into something\ninto a box that someone else wanted us\nto be\nwhat do we do about this\nhow do we reconnect with who we are\nhow do we become\nwhat we are supposed to be\nwhat we want to be in a world that\ndemands too much of us\nso first thing is discover actually who\nyou are\nyou may say well that's kind of weird\nlike how do i discover who i am\nit's actually pretty simple not saying\nit's easy i'm saying simple\nthey're going to be a lot of times\nthroughout your day if you're in this\nsituation they're going to be a lot of\ntimes throughout your day where you're\ngoing to want to do something there's\ngoing to be this little voice in you\nthat's like yeah i don't want to apply\nfor that promotion\nand everyone around you is gonna be\nsaying oh my god you should apply for\nthe promotion the whole world is gonna\ntell you to do something\nbut there's a voice that you've squashed\nand flattened over the course of the\nlast couple years\njust listen to that voice what's it\nsaying\nwe're not necessarily saying that you\nshould apply for the promotion or\nshouldn't apply it for the promotion you\nshould at least understand and listen to\nthat voice listen to that tiniest little\npart of you\nthat's telling you like hey i don't want\nto do this\nand talk to it\ntell me why you don't want to do this\nwhat's going on here\nhow does this feel\nlearn how to listen to yourself\nsecond thing\nis align your actions with you\nso in our life we have a lot of goals\ni need to get these letters after my\nname i need to do this i need to do this\ni need to do this i need to do this\nso for each and every one of your goals\ngrab a piece of paper write it down\nwrite down each of the goals that you\nhave and then ask yourself for each of\nthese goals\nwhere did this goal come from\nand you may say oh it came they all come\nfrom me right because all my goals come\nfrom my mind but that's where you got to\ntunnel down and be a little bit critical\nwhen did i decide that i need to have\ni need to lose 10 pounds or gain 10\npounds\nwhat was going on in my head\nis this because\ni want to stop feeling embarrassed when\ni walk outside\nmy friends are having a pool party and i\ndon't want to be ashamed of taking off\nmy shirt\nbecause that doesn't sound like it's\ncoming from you\nreally it seems like it is right because\nyou don't want to feel those things but\nwhat it's really coming from is the\njudgment of others\ni don't want my boss to think dot dot\ndot\ni don't want my friends to think dot dot\ndot\nwhat you can even do is like ask\nyourself where the goal came on column\nnumber three\nis there a part of this goal\nthat is about what other people think\nand what you'll tend to find if you\nwrite down all of your goals is some of\nthose are going to actually be coming\nfrom you\nright because even in this post we can\nkind of tell\num\ni have no time to draw which is what i'm\ngoing to\ncollege for in the first place\nso even this person can tell\nmaybe they want to do meditation maybe\nthey have to do work and cleaning and\nlaundry and stuff like that\nbut this person has sacrificed what they\nwant\nfor what the world demands of them\nnow sometimes you have to make\nsacrifices for the world don't get me\nwrong\nwe're not suggesting a life of hedonism\nhere\nso it's like\ni want to help people as a medical\ndoctor\nbut i still have to write my notes\ni got to do that you gotta you gotta\ntake an l here or there for sure\nright so if you have to study astronomy\nyou have to start the astronomy to get\nyour degree like that's okay\nwe're not saying you should just do the\nthings that are hedonistic and enjoyable\nfor yourself\nbut what i'm saying is like on the one\nhand there's hedonism and on the other\nhand there's like hopefully you don't\nfall quite this far but there's a life\nthat you've lived which is completely\nfalse and you're completely burnt out\nwhere you don't get to do anything that\nyou want to do and you're just trying to\nsatisfy other people\nand what we want you to do is move it to\nthe middle\nright where life is like you don't get\nto do what you want but you get to do\nwhat you want some of the time\ni mean come on\nthe last thing to do\nis acknowledge that it's hard\nacknowledge that the world is too\ndemanding\nacknowledge that this isn't necessarily\na personal deficiency\nacknowledge that the world is changing\nand the demands on you are very\nlegitimate and very heavy\nnow what does this do people say like oh\ndoes does that mean you're just\naccepting your fate or like like does\nthat makes me feel worse\nthis is where there's a really\ninteresting principle from buddhist\npsychology\ncalled the principle of two arrows\nis some one of the concepts that we\nshare with our coaches for example so\nthey're they're all aware of this\nso the concept of two the two arrows\nis that\nlife shoots an arrow at us\nand it hits us in the knee\nand then when life shoots an arrow at us\nwhat we oftentimes do without realizing\nit is shooting an arrow at ourselves\nfor getting hit by the first arrow\nso there's not only the initial problem\nwhich was outside of our control but\nthen there's the way that we react to it\nthere's the way that we beat ourselves\nup for the original\nthing that actually causes just as much\ndamage\nso oh my partner broke up with me\nbecause school is ending and they're\nmoving to a different country\ncan't control that\nbut\nif i'm not careful i'll start blaming\nmyself for it anyway oh if i had been a\nbetter partner or if i'd applied for a\njob in that country if i'd done this\ndifferently oh i screwed it up\nright if i was more lovable\nthere's all the things that we do to\nourselves there's all the blame\nso it's one thing to throw a game\nright i threw i misplayed\nit's something completely different to\ntilt from your original throw\nand this concept this ancient concept\nfrom buddhism\nis actually very accessible today in\nvideo games\nthere's throwing and there's tilting\nand what the buddhists realized\nis that what screws you is not the throw\nit's the tilt\nso this is one of the core concepts that\nwe teach our coaches and when they work\nwith people they sort of like\nare on the lookout for this\nso in a client what is the throw and\nwhat is the tilt\nbecause when you have a throw you don't\nyou shouldn't worry about fixing that\nright because that's where like we get\nso caught up on that\noriginal throw but that's in the past\nyou can't really control what life does\nto you\nwhat we can control is the tilt\nand oftentimes the reason that people\nget stuck is because they focus on the\nthrow\ninstead of the tilt\nand what you really need to focus on is\nthe other way because like sometimes\nyou're just going to like life is not\ngoing to be\nlucky to you\nright\nit's like sometimes like i get a lag\nspike and my ping shoots up and i feed a\nfirst blood\ni can't control that but boy can i tilt\noff of it\nright\nand interestingly enough sometimes we\ntilt the hardest out of the things that\nare out of our control\nand then like then we're really screwed\nbecause we're so hung up on stuff that's\nout of our control that we don't even\ncontrol the tilting and that's what\nreally throw like then that's what\ndestroys the game\nand so these kinds of core concepts are\ncrucial\nwhich is why we teach them to coaches so\nhow do you help a client recognize the\ndifference\nbetween a throw and tilting how do you\nhelp them not tilt because the cool\nthing is if you can help people not tilt\nthen you can move forward you can\nactually fix things\nso what is the value of acknowledging\nacknowledging prevents the second arrow\nacknowledging hey things are hard for me\nand the world is actually harsh and the\nworld my boss grew up in is not the same\none that i grew up in\nand when you say that to yourself let's\nlook at what happens\nall it did was make me feel invalidated\nin less than\nright\nso this\nthought this reaction\nthis you can't control what your boss\nsays\nbut you can adjust or over time shape\nhow you respond to it\nand so by acknowledging you know the\nworld they grew up in was different from\nthe world that i grew up in\ni'm not actually because the key thing\nis if you acknowledge that then you're\nnot less than your boss you could\nactually be more than your boss and\nstill on some level underperform your\nboss\nso you must acknowledge\nso at the end of the day sometimes the\nworld is too demanding\nfeels too demanding let's start there\nbut is it really too demanding\nor is it just feelings\nam i weak or is the world actually\nbecoming a harder place i genuinely\nthink the world is becoming a harder\nplace in a lot of dimensions some things\nare absolutely getting easier\nright so like\nonline shopping is fantastic\ni don't have to sit in traffic to get a\npair of jeans anymore that's great so\nthere's definitely upsides\nbut in a lot of ways the world is\nbecoming more demanding\nthe simplest way that the world is\nbecoming more demanding is an inflation\nof credentials\nso you used to be able to get a decent\njob with four years of school now you\nneed six or you even need eight\nright some fields like higher phds\nso things are actually getting tougher\nas mental health gets worse across the\nglobe\nour self-care needs to actually\nobjectively increase\nto balance the negative influences of\nthings like social media and technology\nso that was like self-care that we\ndidn't need to do\nlike these aboriginal societies didn't\nneed to meditate to manage their stress\nso like rush jobs and deadlines and\nthings like that are like rapidly\nincreasing\ni was talking to someone who works in\nthe film industry\nthey were saying that when they get an\noffer from like a producer\nto work on a film\nthey have to respond within 15 minutes\ntwo hours later job's gone\nthink about that within 15 minutes\nit's gone\nso things are actually like i think in a\nlot of ways objectively getting harder\nwhat do you do about it\nfirst thing is recognize\nwhat standards are you trying to live up\nfor or live up to that are actually like\nyou versus other people\nso like remember who you are because the\nworld is trying to squeeze you into\nsomething else\nwe want you to check all these boxes so\nyou can get this job\ni need you to check all these boxes to\ngo on a date with me\ni need to check all these boxes to be my\nfriend\nso the more that we start checking boxes\nfor other people the more that we lose\nsight of ourselves\nso you have to start by discovering who\nyou are\nlisten to that voicing\nthat's very very quiet it's grown quiet\nbecause you've\nlearned how to suppress it\nnext thing you need to do is start\naligning yourself with that voice\npractically what does that mean it means\nlooking through your goals and trying to\nfigure out how many of these goals are\nbased on\nwanting people to think something about\nme\nand how many of these are actually\ncoming from me\nand the last thing is to acknowledge\nthat things are hard\nbecause beating yourself up it's one\nthing to not achieve\nit's a second thing to beat yourself up\nfor not achieving\nit's fine to want achievement it's fine\nto be disappointed that you didn't\nachieve\nbut you should at least acknowledge that\nthere were genuine reasons why you\ndidn't achieve because it's not all on\nyou right\nif you didn't get a job there are other\napplicants you can't control the other\napplicants you can't control the\nadvantages that they had over you or you\ncan't control for example like this\nperson the case that we looked at today\n20 hours to read a chapter like th you\nare working so much harder than everyone\nelse who's getting an a in astronomy\nbecause they're not studying for 20\nhours on a chapter\nand that's just not fair\nand that sucks but it ain't your fault\nwhich is really important to understand\nso acknowledge\nalign with yourself\nand most importantly discover yourself\nif you can't succeed why try\ngreat question\nthe problem with that question is it's\nan unsolvable question\nif you can't succeed what is success\nif i sit down to like queue for a game\nof let's say league of legends or dota\nam i going to win that game\nmaybe maybe not\neven if you were to tell me i have a 100\nchance so let's say i've never played\nleague of legends before and i install\nit and i queue up what are my chances of\nwinning\none percent let's say\nwhat's the point in trying if i'm not\ngoing to succeed\noh that's right\ni can queue up for another game\nand then my answer\neveryone's saying 50\nprobably\ntbh\nso we think about success as binary and\ntime limited\nwhy try because you could be successful\nnext time\nwhy try because you're going to learn\nand level up from the attempt\nthere are a lot of reasons to try\nin fact i think most of the reasons to\ntry have nothing to do with succeeding\nmost of the value of action is actually\nnot in the success\ni'll give y'all just a simple example\nso if you're in medical school what's\nthe point of studying\nwhat's the point of studying if i can't\nget an a\nwhat's the point of studying if i can't\neven get a b\nwhat's the point\nthe point is because one day i may be a\ndoctor and someone's life may be in\ndanger and then like whether i am able\nto help them or not depends on whether i\nstudy\nthat's the real point\nbut the problem is that our our society\nhas made us think so much\nabout checking these boxes right\nif you don't if you can't succeed if\nyou're not going to get the promotion\nwhat's the point in applying\nlike they've like conditioned us\nto care so much\nabout these false things\nthat we convince ourselves to not even\ntry\nsuccess for whom\nthe reason you should try is because you\nwant to\nthe reason you should try is because\neven if you don't succeed now you will\nlearn something from it you will gain\nsomething from it you will prepare\nyourself next time around\nbecause at the end of the day who ends\nup succeeding\nit's the people who are okay with\nfailing\nright it's the people who don't need to\nsucceed in order to try that's the\nbiggest paradox\ngreat question\nencapsulates so many problems that we\nhave\nyou"
