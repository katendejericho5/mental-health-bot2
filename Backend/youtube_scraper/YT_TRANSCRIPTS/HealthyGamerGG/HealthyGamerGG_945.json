    "transcript": "what really impairs our function\nis not the original issue\nit's the way that we adapt to the issue\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\npanic attacks\nso\nuh if you all have seen dr k's guide to\nanxiety you know that we have a video on\npanic attacks but generally speaking we\ntalk a lot more about anxiety\nthan panic attacks so what i'd love to\ndo today is to talk to y'all a little\nbit about panic attacks and a couple of\nkey things about panic attacks okay\nso has anyone else been mostly fine\ntheir whole life then randomly got a\npanic attack as an adult and haven't\nbeen the same since\njust wondering i'm 25 and i used to be\nable to live a perfectly normal life\nthen i had what i believe was my first\npanic attack two months ago the first\nmonth was so hard i didn't want to leave\nthe house at all\ni struggled to even get out of bed\nthis month i'm getting better and slowly\ngetting back to normal my anxiety\nsymptoms persist muscle weakness heavy\narms and legs randomly and i get blood\nrushing to my head for no apparent\nreason\ni'm not even sure if it is anxiety but\nit's been two months and i'm still alive\ni'm having trouble believing my symptoms\nare just anxiety i also find it hard to\nbelieve anxiety and panic like this\ncould onset at my age\nso this is a really important post\nbecause and the reason we're talking\nabout panic attacks is because there's a\nlot of stuff that people don't\nunderstand about panic attacks\nthe first is that we assume that panic\nattacks and anxiety are related\nright so there's sort of this idea that\nlike okay if i have panic attacks i\nshould go see a psychiatrist\nit's a mental health issue if it's a\nmental health issue that must mean that\nit involves my mind\nand this is what confuses a lot of\npeople who have panic attacks because\nthey assume that the origin of the panic\nattack is mental in nature\nand then as you start the more\nperplexing thing is that sometimes\nlike you know you'll see something like\nthis where people are like i'm not even\nsure if it's anxiety because i'm not\neven anxious\nparticularly like i don't have any\nparticular fears it's like a random like\ni'm living a perfectly normal life and\nthen suddenly i had a panic attack\nand then i have all this weird crap\ngoing on with my physical body\nand like it just doesn't feel mental it\ndoesn't feel like anxiety\nand so what i'd love to do today is talk\nto y'all a little bit about how that is\nabsolutely what a panic attack and panic\ndisorder is is like\nso the first thing to understand is that\npanic attacks\nare a symptom\nthey're not a diagnosis\nso it's kind of like fever\nright so this is another example of a\nsymptom so what causes fever well covid\ncould cause fever\ncancer could cause fever\nyou know strep infection could cause\nfever pneumonia could cause fever\nstaph infection in the skin could cause\nfever all kinds of things can cause\nfever it's a symptom\nnow the most common source of panic\nattacks is a diagnosis\ncalled panic disorder\nnow a diagnosis is like an etiology so\nit's like a source of a problem so if we\ntake a diagnosis like covet infection\nthis is going to create fever it's going\nto create shortness of breath it's going\nto create maybe\nchanges on your x-ray it's going to\ncreate\nuh you know runny nose\nso it's like a constellation of symptoms\nthat all lead are caused by one thing\nnow the interesting thing is that\npneumonia\ncan also cause all of these changes\nright and you can have a covid related\npneumonia\nso that gets a little bit more\ncomplicated but do you all sort of get\nhow oh whoops\num let me move this do you all sort of\nget how there's a difference between a\nsymptom and a diagnosis\nand there are a couple of key features\nto the diagnosis of panic disorder which\na lot of people don't really realize but\nit's actually quite elucidating\nso when someone has a panic attack what\nwhat what is the primary experience of\nthe panic attack so the first thing to\nunderstand about the the primary\nexperience of the panic attack is that\nit's predominantly physiologic\nso people oftentimes have\num elevated heart rate so their heart is\nbeating super fast\nthey'll have difficulty breathing so\nthey'll get shortness of breath\nthey'll have nausea\nthey'll get sweaty\nthey'll get muscle tension or shakes\nright so it's a very physical thing it\nfeels like something is wrong with you\nphysically\nand what this actually does is this\nresults\nin a sense of impending doom\nso when people when someone has a panic\nattack\ninstead of asking them what are your\ndeep dark fears instead of approaching\nit psychologically\noftentimes what i'll ask him is like did\nit feel like you were straight up gonna\ndie\ndid absolute like did you feel like you\nwere gonna die and like the world was\nlike ending\nand then they'll often times if they\nhave a real panic attack they'll say yes\nwhereas if it's more like you know\nanxiety related oddly enough that may\nnot actually be a panic attack\nso this is the first thing to understand\nif you've got a panic attack is it's\nvery physiologic in nature okay\nso now that we know that what we're\ngoing to do is talk a little bit about\npanic disorder\nand then what we're going to do is look\nat some of the mechanisms through which\nthis happens and then we're going to\ntell you all what to do about it okay\nso\nthe interesting thing about panic\ndisorder is that in order to be\ndiagnosed with panic disorder you need\none really important feature\nand that is\nadjusting\nyour behavior\nor a persistent fear\nof future panic attacks\nso this is really important to\nunderstand\noftentimes\nwhat causes us\nproblems in life what really impairs our\nfunction\nis not the original\nissue\nit's the way that we adapt to the issue\nand what we see in panic disorder is not\njust the panic attack\nwhat really cripples people in panic\ndisorder is not actually the panic\nattack\nit's the fear of the future panic attack\nso a good example of this is something\nthat people call agoraphobia\nwhat is agoraphobia it's fear of leaving\nthe house fear of going outside this is\ntruly what's debilitating about panic\ndisorder\nit's not the panic attack itself it's\nthe fact that\nwhat will happen if i have a panic\nattack at work\nwhat will happen if i have a panic\nattack at the movies\nso what people end up doing\nis they stop going to the movies they\nstop going to work\nright you don't even have to be\nnecessarily agoraphobic like even if\nyou're okay with like going to the\ngrocery store and leaving the house and\nyou enjoy going for walks but what i\ntend to find in people a panic disorder\nis that they come up with like\ncontingency plans\nfor if they have a panic attack so it's\nlike okay i'm willing to go to a\nrestaurant but like only a restaurant\nthat has\nthree stalls in the bathroom and i'll be\nlike why do you need to go to a\nrestaurant that has three stalls in the\nbathroom they're like well\ni recognize that oftentimes one stall\nmay be occupied\nand in some cases like you know if one\nstall is occupied and someone else goes\nin the second stall will be occupied but\ni absolutely need access to a bathroom\nstall if i have a panic attack because i\nneed to hunker down for like 20 minutes\nthere so the only restaurants i'll go to\nare the ones that have three stalls or i\nneed some kind of safe escape this is\nreally common for people who have panic\ndisorder they need to know how to get\nout of a situation\nif they have a panic attack\nokay\nso the key thing here is that if we look\nat like a lot of what causes us problems\nit's not the original insult it's the\nconsequences of the insult or the\nadaptation we also see this for example\nin like the dating world right so if i\nhave a bad experience with a particular\nperson\ni can generalize things about that\nperson so i can generalize things about\ntheir gender oh this gender can't be\ntrusted this gender is cruel i can\ngeneralize things about their race or\ntheir ethnicity i'll never date this\nrace or ethnic ethnic of a person again\nor this kind of ethnicity again because\nall of the people of that race or\nethnicity are like this\nit's not just the original problem in\nthe date it's the adaptation that we\nmake\nto our negative experience which\nactually causes us problems\nso a key feature of panic disorder is\nactually adjusting your behavior or a\npersistent fear of future panic attacks\nokay\nnow what we're going to do is talk a\nlittle bit about the mechanisms\na panic disor panic attacks\nand this will also set us up for what\nyou can do about panic attacks\nso the first thing to understand is that\nwe tend to get signals\nso these are things like heart rate\nblood pressure\nsweatiness\nnausea\nshortness of breath\nthings like this we get these\nphysiologic signals\nand then our brain is trying to\ninterpret these signals because it's\nlike if i'm just like if i'm 25 years\nold and i'm healthy\nand i just every organ in my body starts\nlike getting messed up like my heart is\npounding in my chest i can't breathe i\nfeel like vomiting my i'm shaking it's\nlike what on earth is going on\nthen what happens is there's an\ninterpretation\nand then there's a conclusion i'm dying\nand then what there is is based on that\ntraumatic experience there's an\nadaptation\ndoes that make\nsense now if we look at things like\ntherapy\nlike psychotherapy\npsychotherapy really works here\nand potentially here\nbut it doesn't actually work here\noftentimes\nokay\nso let's try to understand a little bit\nabout what we know about this\nright here and what we can do about that\nso\nthere are a couple of really interesting\nthings the first is that we know that\nthere's an interesting hypothesis\nthat we have a suffocation reflex\nso when we start to suffocate so if\nsomeone's like choking me or like i'm\ndrowning or something like that\nthere's a reflex a very strong survival\nmechanism that activates and we have\nthis kind of suffocation reflex\nso the suffocation reflex is going to\nactivate\ncause all kinds of changes to our\namygdala also cause\nphysiologic changes\nlike adrenaline rush\nand then this in turn will lead to\nthings like\nheart rate increased respiratory rate\nright shortness of breath all that kind\nof stuff\nnow the interesting thing about the\namygdala so this is our fear center of\nthe brain\nis that the amygdala also has\nan apnic response\nso apnea is the cessation of breathing\nso when we're very very scared right i\ndon't know if y'all have ever seen like\nvideos of like animals on the hunt or\nwhatever\nwhen we're terrified what happens to our\nbreathing we freeze\nso what activation of the amygdala can\ndo\nis actually make like alter our\nrespiratory rate and actually make us\nstop breathing\nwhich in turn\nwill increase our co2\nand will cause a hyperventilation\nconsistent with a panic attack\nso what's going on in a panic attack\ni suspect so there's a data to support\nthis but we don't really know 100\nthat a panic attack is actually\nphysiologic in origin and what you\nactually get is an\ninappropriate activation of your\nsuffocation reflex\nso sometimes something happens\nand like\nthis reflex the survival reflex turns on\nwithout it supposed to be\nturned on\nand so then we get this adrenaline rush\nthat explains all these symptoms we also\nget activation of the amygdala which\ngives us a sense of fear\nright which then turns into these\nthoughts like i'm dying and then also\ntriggers this whole cascade which\naffects our respiratory rate which in\nturn ends up affecting this and by the\nway this all the way goes back over here\nand then we get our panic attack does\nthat make sense\nso the key thing to understand if you've\ngot panic attacks is like oftentimes\npeople think and panic attacks think i'm\ndying or some you know something's\nfundamentally wrong with me and arguably\ni mean obviously if you're having a\npanic attack there is something going on\nthat's not supposed to be going on but\ninstead of having cancer or impending\ndoom or things like that chances are\nit's actually just a misactivation of\ncertain parts of your brain that's the\ntheory that i think has the best support\nbehind it and also is consistent with\nwhat people actually experience\nokay\nso in a sense like you'll be okay but\nthere's also treatment for this okay so\nwhat should you do if you have a panic\nattack\nwhat do\nthe first thing is that if you're\nactually having a panic attack and if\nit's your first panic attack i think\nit's completely appropriate to seek\nemergency\nmedical services\nthis is completely appropriate so in the\nu.s you can actually call 9-1-1 you can\ngo to the emergency room\nthis is important to understand\nso a panic attack generally speaking is\nnot going to kill you\nbut emergency medical services are not\njust for things that are going to kill\nyou\nemergency medical services are for\nthings that we don't know if this is\ngoing to kill us or not\ndoes that make sense\nlike it's not your job\nas someone who's experiencing a panic\nattack to be able to differentiate\nbetween a cardiac arrhythmia\nwhich could absolutely be lethal and a\npanic attack so i'm not trying to you\nknow stress you all out here what i'm\nsaying is that if this is your first\npanic attack and you really don't know\nwhat's going on or if you have another\none and you've never gotten diagnosed or\nsomething like that you should\nabsolutely seek emergency medical\nservices\nbecause the important thing here\nand we'll get to this in a second and\nlet's say the panic attack has passed\nand you didn't seek emergency services\nwhat should you do the next day the next\ncouple days things like that\nyou should absolutely seek a medical\nevaluation\nand why do i say a medical evaluation\ninstead of a psychiatric evaluation\nso this is one of the things that i\nthink is unfortunate about the way that\nwe train therapists\nis you may say okay i'm having a panic\nattack i need to go see a therapist\nthe problem is that there are all kinds\nof things that can cause these symptoms\nand while a panic attack may be the most\nlikely\nthere could be things like\ncardiac arrhythmias\nso a cardiac arrhythmia is irregular\nactivity of the heart\nirregular electrical activity of the\nheart\nand these can be transient so you can\nget a heart that's like starts beating\nvery very fast when it's not supposed to\nor and when it beats or beats uh\nnot properly\nso it's kind of like you know the way\nthat our heart beats so our heart is\nkind of shaped like this\nand it's filled with blood and then what\nit starts doing is actually like it\ncontracts from the bottom\nand then it contracts higher and then it\ncontracts higher so that\nif you think about it if i if i'm\nsqueezing something from the bottom and\nthe opening is at the top what i'm\nactually going to do\nis facilitate the flow out but if i\nstart squeezing from the top\nthat's not going to help things you know\nleave blood leave the heart it's\nactually going to push it downward and\nthen i start squeezing from the bottom\nand then like the heart doesn't empty\nappropriately\nso arrhythmias can cause all kinds of\nweird things like this\nthere are also issues for example with\nthyroid\nso if you're hyperthyroid you can sort\nof get uh symptoms of a panic attack\npretty easily sometimes\nso the key thing for the key reason for\nmedical evaluation is that there may be\nmedical causes to your\nquote-unquote panic attack that's why\nyou need to go see a medical\nprofessional and unfortunately i have\nseen cases where people will go to\ntherapists\nthe therapist you know if you're like a\nlicensed clinical social worker like you\ndon't regularly order lab tests for your\npatients\nright like you don't you're not taught\nhow to\ninterpret lab tests\nso hopefully what happens is is a good\ntherapist will say by the way have you\ngotten a medical evaluation why don't\nyou talk to your primary care physician\nor gp and then like we can work on the\npanic stuff but let's just make sure\nthat it's not medical in origin so a\ngood therapist will do that\nbut you should get a medical evaluation\nbecause the key thing here is i've had\nsome patients with panic attacks\nwho will like find a medical cause and\nonce we find a medical cause they'll\nlike fix the medical cause\nso they'll start medication or maybe\neven have a procedure or something like\nthat and then their panic attacks are\nlike literally cured\nlike done\nnever a panic attack for the rest of\nyour life you're fixed\nso that's what's really important about\ngetting medical evaluations even if you\nhave something like a panic attack\nnow a couple of other things to consider\nso let's talk about psychotherapy\nso this is where i think psychotherapy\nand medication are equally effective\ngenerally speaking\nso if you look at effect sizes that\ncompare the improvement from\npsychotherapy and medication they tend\nto be about the same\nso one isn't better than the other\nbut if we look at how psychotherapy\nworks i personally find psychotherapy to\nbe very effective especially this\nadaptation step\nso it's not just the panic attack itself\nit's the way that i have to account for\nthe panic attack\nthat the way i adapt to it the way that\ni mal adapt to my panic attacks the way\nthat my panic attacks start controlling\nmy life\nbecause i'm afraid of the panic attack\nthat is where psychotherapy can really\nreally do a lot of good work because it\ncan help you reclaim your life it can\nhelp you notice what these adaptations\nare\nit can help you conquer some of those\nmaladaptations and hopefully start to\nlive a\npretty healthy life\nthe other interesting thing is that\npsychotherapy depending on what kind of\npsychotherapy you can do\nyou can stop this cognitive process of\ninterpretation\nso when i um\nyou know when i feel these signals my\nmind\ninterprets those signals\nand makes me conclude that i'm dying and\nthen this conclusion that i'm dying is\ngoing to create all kinds of other\nyou know effects\nso stopping that interpretation can be\nvery very useful\nsort of understanding and coming to\nappreciate oh this is just a panic\nattack it's my suffocation reflex\ninappropriately activating it's amygdala\nhyper reactivity i actually don't have\ntoo much to worry about and\ninterestingly enough i know it sounds\nkind of weird can you just tell yourself\nthat and that's where the therapy sort\nof helps you train skills\nto\navoid cognitive\nmistakes\nand it can help absolutely\nso there are medications for panic\ndisorder this is where um\nyou know a lot of people\nthink and hope and unfortunately still\nprescribe\nthings like benzodiazepines\nand benzodiazepines can be effective for\ntreating an individual panic attack so\nthings like\nxanax or alprazolam\nor\ncl\nklonopin\nor clonazepam\nthese are the benzodiazepine class of\nmedications they're basically work on\nthe same receptors as alcohol can be\nhighly addictive in habit forming these\nare not actually the best first line\ntreatment the best first line treatment\nis actually ssris\nor\nsnris\nthese are selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors\num\nserotonin norepinephrine reuptake\ninhibitors so these are medications that\nare also in the antidepressant class\nthey seem to be pretty effective\nnow the interesting thing is a lot of\npeople talk about breathing\nso let's talk about breathing for a\nsecond\nso i'm a big fan of breathing i teach a\nlot of brain i am i'm all into like oh\ni'm dr k and i love like my meditation\nand like oh like let's learn how to\nmeditate\nmeditation is effective at reducing\nsymptoms of panic disorder by the way\nthe problem is that if you look at\nstudies\nif you look at meta-analyses of studies\nfor breath training for panic disorder\nor panic attacks\nit turns out that the evidence\nis\naverage\nit's not up it's not down it's kind of\nin the middle\nso breathing a lot of people may think\nthat so i personally have certain\ninterpretations of the literature but if\nyou look at it on the whole breath\ntraining does not seem to be a\nconsistently effective\nintervention for panic attacks which\noftentimes is very confusing for people\nbecause when they have panic attacks\nwhich the vision that you have is\nsomeone breathing into a paper bag right\nso i personally still use uh breathing\ntechniques for people who have panic\ndisorder and panic attacks\num i personally think that the problem\nwith the research is that they'll\ncall things breathing technique or\nbreath training\nbut if you've studied things like brown\ni am or chi gong or real yogic\nmeditation uh breath techniques you'll\nrealize that\nthey're wildly different\nright so not all breath techniques are\nappropriate for panic attacks the\nproblem is that there's no uniformity in\nterms of what they call breath training\nso it's basically if you do something\nwith the breath\ndoes it help panic attacks and the\nanswer is generally speaking we can't\nconclude that the answer is yes\nso it doesn't mean no\nit just means that there's variable\nresponses and i suspect that's because\nof the way that you do breath training\nreally matters there's good breath\ntraining and there's bad breath training\nthe problem is that the people who are\ndoing the breath training aren't experts\nin like yogic science and don't\nunderstand like they're just like oh\nlike it's a meditation technique and\nlike oh like let's just use it and it\nturns out that i don't think that that's\nvery effective\nso i personally will still teach this\nstuff and i see good clinical effect\nsizes but if you look at the whole of\nthe literature\nit turns out that breath training is\nlike a plus-minus kind of intervention\nit doesn't seem to be as consistently\neffective as psychotherapy or medication\nand part of the advantages of something\nlike medication is that it's\nstandardized right like\nit's standardized\nwhereas things like breath training or\nnot\nso mindfulness or meditation does help\nso you can definitely do that\nbut this is where you know i hate to\nbreak it to you but if you're having a\ntrue panic attack\nor you have true panic disorder\nsometimes like later on we're going to\ntalk about you know things that\nwill offer answers in a different kind\nof way\nso this isn't medical advice but this is\njust to explain that based on if someone\nwere to ask me a general question\nif i have a panic attack what should i\ndo i'd say go see your doctor\nand that may be like a little bit of a\ndisappointing answer but sometimes\nthat's actually the right answer\nright like i think talking about\ncognitive patterns and talking about\nthis meditation and that meditation it\ncan help you in this way in that way and\nthat's like all good like i'm not saying\nthat there aren't additional things that\nyou can do\nbut part of the\npart of what i learned in medical school\nis that some of this like\nnew age kind of even like meditation\nstuff which i'm a huge fan of like\nsometimes it just doesn't work as\nconsistently as some of this other like\nwestern medical stuff\nand we could talk about yoga and some\nscars in the mind and focusing and all\nthis kind of good stuff but sometimes\nwhat you really need to do is like go to\nthe emergency room\nsometimes what you really need to do is\nlike go talk to a doctor and get your\nthyroid checked\nand if if you're honestly asking me like\nif i had a family member who had a panic\nattack what would i do if they were\nhaving a panic attack i would send them\nto the emergency room\nif they told me hey i had a paying\nattack yesterday what would i do i would\nsay hey you should go see a doctor and\nlike get yourself like physically\nchecked out\nand then after that you know we can\nexplore some of these things like\npsychotherapy and medication and then if\nyou want to you can try breathing\ntechniques and you can try meditation\nand mindfulness but it's really\nimportant to understand that these\nthings\nshould not be a substitute for these\nthings\nnow if you don't want to put medications\nin your body that's totally fine\nthen by all means go do psychotherapy\nquestions\nyeah so aaron robin\nis saying deep deep breathing didn't\nreally work for me it just made me more\nnauseous\ni you know it's really unfortunate but\nlike\nthat is\nsometimes people's experience\nright is it possible to frequently\nexperience signals but never had a panic\nattack very possible i mean all kinds of\nstuff is possible\nthat's where you know\nand that's where the mechanism is kind\nof important right we don't know if it's\nlike the suffocation reflex or there's\nsome amount of amygdala hyper reactivity\nso if someone is already using ssris do\nthey have a lesser chance of a panic\nattack i would guess that the answer to\nthat question is yes can a panic attack\nmake you feel like you're having a heart\nattack like big chest pain absolutely so\nisn't bellow's breath breath of fire\ncompletely shallow i've had great\nsuccess with it yeah so this is where\nthere's a lot of nuance to the technique\nthat we use so let's talk about bellows\nbreath or breath of fire so for those of\ny'all that don't know these techniques\nthey're in dr k's guide you may be able\nto find them on youtube as well because\ni think we've taught both of those on\nstream before\nso the key thing about bellows breath\nand breath of fire is that what you're\nactually doing is hyperventilating to\nbecome hypocapnic\nso when you increase your respiratory\nrate you drop your co2 level\nand when your co2 level drops really\nreally low\nwhat that forces your body to do or not\nforce but what it sends your signals to\nyour body to do is actually breathe\nslowly\nso then it's like wait a second our co2\nlevel is too low let's slow down our\nrespiratory rate\nto get our co2 level back up\nand as you have that physiologic\nsuppression of the respiratory drive\nand your rate of breathing\ngoes down you're taking like two breaths\na minute three breaths a minute that is\nincredibly relaxing\nsomeone else is asking so you're saying\nthat the literature lacks technical\nspecificity with brown i am 100 that's a\ngreat way to put it\nso we're starting to see this\nwhere now people are doing studies on\nsomething called cardiac coherence\nbreathing\ncardiac coherence breathing is naughty\ndeep bronio\nthey just call it a different thing\nright and then they say oh cardiac\ncoherence breathing is effective\nat all these kinds of things\nbut then people will continue to say oh\nbroniom is like alternative medicine\nright it's\nand so i i hope that we can sort of\ncontinue to move things in that\ndirection where we test these different\nkinds of bronium and start to see\ndifferent\ndifferentiating physiologic effects and\ntreatment benefits\num so how do you help a friend who's\nhaving a panic attack in the moment you\nget them to emergency medical services\nand make sure that it's not something\nmore serious\nwhat do i do if i'm at the point if i\nhave agoraphobia already great question\nthat's why you need to see a therapist\nright so the process of overcoming that\nagoraphobia is absolutely something that\na therapist can help you with so\nshadow7578 is asking if i feel like my\nheart is actually skipping a beat and my\nbreath gets heavy but in 15 seconds i'm\nfine is that a panic attack\nso that's the kind of thing where like\nthat you need a medical evaluation for\nthat right so here i am educating you\nall about the specifics of panic attacks\nbut this is important to understand\nif you have a particular constellation\nof stuff\ni don't know what that is because in\norder to confidently answer that i would\nactually need to do a medical evaluation\non you right i would need to ask you a\nbunch of questions like how often does\nit happen what happens what happens to\nyour heart rate\nlet's check your like in order to answer\nthat question i would check your thyroid\ni would also potentially send you for uh\nyou know\nuh general practitioner evaluation maybe\nget something like an ekg i don't think\nakg is super appropriate in that\nsituation my point is that the more\nspecific your question is hey dr k i\nhave this constellation of weird things\nwhat is it that's exactly why you should\ngo see a medical doctor\nbecause the information that you're\ngiving me may not be the relevant\ninformation and figuring out what it is\nthat's why doctors ask a bunch of\nquestions\nuh so marmalade is asking would you\nagree that expiration is what makes\nbreathing relaxing i personally only\nfeel better when i focus on breathing\nout instead of in\nso it's not\nit's partially true\nthe key thing is that the length of\nexhalation\ngenerally speaking correlates with the\ndegree of relaxation\nso it's not just exhalation chances are\nsince you're focusing on exhalation what\nyou're really doing is slowing down your\nexhalation\nbecause when you focus on your breathing\nyou tend to slow it down\nand as you slow it down chances are you\nstart to feel more relaxed\num do i have a paper on cardiac\ncoherence breathing\ni mean you can just search for it but\ncardiac coherence\nit it's not about\nso people will do studies like on\nparticular conditions right does that\nmake sense so there are i i mean there\nmay be papers on just straight cardiac\ncoherence breathing but usually what\npeople are doing is it's like cardio\ncardiac coherence breathing for\nptsd\nif that makes sense\nbut i don't have a particular\nstudy on hand is there a difference\nbetween an anxiety attack and a panic\nattack are they synonymous\nanxiety attack is not a medical term\npanic attack is a medical term\nso\ni\ni generally think of them in the common\nlike\nusage is synonymous when someone says\nand that's why like\nwhen someone says i had an anxiety\nattack that's where i will assess them\nright so i'll do a clinical assessment\ni'll ask them what did you feel when did\nit start how long did it last how do you\nfeel now has it happened before and then\ni'll determine whether something called\nan anxiety attack was a true panic\nattack or not\nokay yeah so maluka is saying\nthree years ago i had a series of panic\nattacks and i didn't know what they were\nnow i'm kind of in fear of having\nanother one i think i should see a\ntherapist for that i think you should\ntoo\nseiko five is saying i've only reached a\nno mind state once now i'm trying to\nreach it a second time it's way harder\nany tips yeah so the funny thing about\nabout meditation is the first no mind\nstate you reach is easier than the\nsecond the second is actually the\nhardest\nthe reason that the second no-mind state\nis harder than the first no-mind state\nis now you have an expectation of the\nno-mind state\nand so since you're looking for the no\nmind state\nyour mind remains active because it's\nwanting a no mind state\nright does that make sense\nit's like you stumble upon something and\nso the reason it's easy to stumble on it\nthe first time is because you have no\nexpectation of it\nnow that you have an expectation\nthat expectation exists within the mind\nand is like harder to let go\nso what you have to do is stop looking\nfor the no mind state in meditation\nand then you'll find it again\nyou"
