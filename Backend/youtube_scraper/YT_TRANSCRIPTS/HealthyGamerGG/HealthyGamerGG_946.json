    "transcript": "and if nothing happens i feel better but\nwhat happened in your situation is you\nwere taught that no matter how good\nthings look you should still be afraid\nhello\nhey\nhello dr k hello what do you go by\nfriend\num i go by honey honey\nnice to meet you honey yes ken and what\nare you working on nowadays thank you\nwell uh the reason i i grew up today is\nbecause i want to stop having the fear\nof losing everything i've gained\num just for yeah\nyeah some\nsounds terrible and\nmaybe it is\nwe'll see sounds scary um the thing is\nyeah it is um\nwell\ni've had made many improvements in my\nlife when i was a teenager i had us a\nvery um\na great problem with social anxiety i\ncouldn't even talk to people and then i\nworked hard for it uh when i made met my\nboyfriend i started to improve and then\ni saw this community and\nand well that gave me a big push too and\ni have a great job i have a great life\nand\ni have worked so hard for everything and\ni'm very very happy with my life\num i mean in a moment that i think even\nwhen i have new problems i know how to\nuh work through them and try to improve\nbut\nuh sometimes i\ni get scared i lose some things\nthis happens in different ways uh for\nexample\nthis morning i\ni woke up i was kind of half asleep\nand then i felt a bump on my arm and i\nwas like oh no maybe i have cancer and i\nwas like oh yeah it's not cancer it's\njust a mosquito bite and then my brain\ngoes like well you don't have cancer but\nwhat about your boyfriend does he has\ncancer and i'm like no brain\nno one has cancer let's\nlet's just stop this doesn't make sense\nand then i move on with my day and\nsometimes it's that easy uh\nto just move on but some other days\nespecially when i'm working uh when i'm\ndoing good at work i start to think um\nwhat if they i can complete the next\nassignment what if uh\nthe people who trust me at work uh stop\ntrusting in me and i i understand that\nsometimes these are just thoughts and\nthis is not\nreality this is not what it's really\nhappening and when i think about it uh\ni know i know where this comes from for\nhow my parents raised me\nbut still i can find a way to stop\nhaving these thoughts um they just\nhappen randomly i can go some days\nwithout it and then one day it happens\nso\ni i think i'm lost i don't know what to\ndo with it\nso here's what i'm hearing honey\ni'm hearing that\nyou struggled with social anxiety you\nput in a lot of effort a lot of energy\nand a lot of time\nand through a lot of your hard work\nyou've managed to develop um you know\nyour it sounds like you're in a healthy\nromantic relationship it sounds like you\nhave friends it sounds like you have a\njob that you're proud of it sounds that\nlike you have a lot to be grateful for\nand that you've worked really hard to\nbuild a pretty good life\nexactly i i i think and that's why what\ni'm hearing is that despite that\nso\ninstead of all of this progress\nmaking you feel more comfortable\nconfident and reassured\nwhat you're noticing is that sometimes\nyour mind still is like worried that\nit's all going to come falling apart\nyes exactly that that's uh i have great\ntriggers also with money like\noh what if you\nif there's every\num\nproblem in your country and then the\ni don't know the economy falls and then\nyou lose your money and like well i can\ncontrol that that doesn't really matter\nif if that ever happens\nbut yeah my mind is all kind of thoughts\nin\ndifferent directions like sickness money\num\nthings like that it's it's like um\nit's i think it's like you said it's\njust\ni feel like i'm going to lose\nthings and i can really enjoy what i\nhave\nokay that sounds\nterrifying right because like you said\nit's like it's one thing to work hard\nfor stuff\nbut then the whole point of working hard\nis that like then you get to enjoy it\nright\nyeah that's right and and so exactly it\nsucks\nto work hard and not be able to enjoy it\nbecause your brain is like hey by the\nway\nif you're a vacation this week what if\nlike your your house\ngets swallowed in an earthquake\n[Laughter]\nlet me ask you a couple of questions\nhoney you said you know that you know\nwhere this comes from it has something\nto do with your parents can you explain\nthat\nyes uh\nwell\nthe first thing is about death uh my\nparents usually have very\nthey they are very controlling using\ntheir own health about about it\num so for example when i was a kid my uh\ni have a sister uh\nthey told us things like we don't have\nenough time and someday we were going to\ndie see how old i'm getting\nuh it was too much that when we were 10\nyears old and my sister 11\none day they went to a party and we\nstayed at home and\nwe were catholic at that time and we\nstarted praying because we were we\nthought my parents may die in an\naccident when they came back from from\ntheir party\nand also my father used to say many\nthings like oh if i lose this job um\ni'll lose everything i owe everything i\nam to this company\nand\nlogically i know that that wasn't true\nand\nfor me i don't have exactly attachment\nto companies because\ni remember my father saying that all the\ntime and i know i knew that wasn't true\nbut it makes me feel like\nsmall things can make everything fall\napart\nokay and my father was always yeah\ntalking about um\nabout money and how\nlittle he had but he really didn't have\nuh\nthat wasn't true my father\nmade very good income we even went on\nvacation to expensive place and it was\nfine but my father refused to\nto give us money uh because he said we\ndidn't have any so that law was also\nlike this confusion of knowing that my\nfather had money but then saying he\ndoesn't and as an adult that i\nunderstand how much he made that i\nunderstand that that made no sense and\nit was just a way to to not give us any\nmoney to my sister and me\nso i think that confusion of having a\nlot of money\nin your house but in practice and wanted\nto do to do stuff and buy stuff you\ndon't have any that's i think that that\nconfusion\nmakes me think that having a lot of\nmoney\ndoesn't mean you won't be living like a\npoor person okay i think that that's\nthat's what i've seen very insightful\nhoney so let me ask you have you ever\nseen a mental health professional honey\ni\nseen one when i was a teenager because\nmy parents couldn't make me have any\nfriends and they didn't know what to do\nwith me\nbut\num\ni i think it helped me to\nto be able to do some stuff like to\nmimic um\nbeing able to\nnot have social anxiety but i didn't fix\nit i was just terrified inside and doing\nstuff on the outside\nand\nbut after that since that experience was\nlike that for me i didn't understand\nanything about myself or why i was so\nanxious all the time\ni didn't try it again okay\nso um\nis it okay if i share some thoughts with\nyou\nyeah sure\nfirst of all i just want to commend you\non how hard you've worked and also how\ninsightful you are\num because it sounds like here i i think\nyou're making it easy for me and i think\nyou've you've\nyou know done a lot of thinking about\nthis already which helps a ton\nso let's start with this so i think you\nshould definitely consider getting a\nclinical evaluation\num\nyou know because you you may have\nsomething like\nuh you know i don't\nwe don't really know but you know you so\nyou may have a real anxiety disorder and\nthat's the kind of thing where like wow\nlike that's where you know once you\nget diagnosed with it and you get\ntreated for it like in eight weeks 12\nweeks 16 weeks\nyou may feel completely differently like\nyou may feel substantially better like\nif you actually get like clinical\ntreatment for it so that's definitely\nsomething that i want you to consider uh\ni you know i don't know if you do or you\ndon't we're still going to talk about\nsort of the things that we do in the hg\nway which is we're going to sort of\nexplain how your mind works and things\nlike that but i want to make it clear\nthat\na lot of you may get a lot of benefit\nout of actually clinical evaluation and\ntreatment with me so far\nokay so just something to consider okay\nespecially when you're kind of talking\nabout it it seems like\nyou're not worried about anything it\nseems like your mind\nis almost always worried and just picks\ndifferent things to be worried about\nyes does that make sense\nso it's almost like the worry is like\nindependent of the problem\nlike today the worry is going to pick\nthis and tomorrow the worry is going to\npick this and the next day though oh\nthere's a bump on my arm i guess we're\nworrying about cancer today there's no\nbump on my arm what else can be worried\nwhat we'd be worried about oh i know we\ncan be worried about the economy\nif we're not worried about the economy\ntoday i know we can be worried about our\nboyfriend\nright yeah so let me let's start with\nwith this so you were taught to be\nafraid\nright yes\nso normally\nso let's forget about your upbringing\nfor a second\nif i'm afraid of something\nand nothing bad happens what happens to\nmy fear\nthis may be a hard question for you\nyeah it's very hard for me\nit's it's actually hard for me okay\nsometimes i would say go away but\nsometimes it just comes back later great\nso i know that's hard for you so the the\nanswer is if you're raised in a normal\nenvironment it goes away right so like\nif i'm worried about\na snake being in my toilet and pardoned\napologies to everyone out there who who\nyou know now is gonna be worried about\nthat and i walk inside and i don't see a\nsnake in my toilet that fear will go\naway right so generally speaking if we\nthink about the human brain\nif i'm afraid of something and it\nhappens that reinforces the fear does\nthat make sense\nyes it does make sense and if i'm afraid\nof something and it doesn't happen then\nthat reduces the fear the fear goes down\ni know it may not be that way for you\nbut does that make sense in general yes\nyes makes sense now it sounds like you\ngrew up in a really really tricky\nsituation\nwhere there was plenty of fear that was\ndisconnected from reality\nyes right yes so your dad is like oh my\ngod i'm going to lose my job let's go on\nvacation to a fancy place because we\nactually have plenty of money\nso what your mind actually learned so\ni've seen this a lot and there's\nactually studies that show that\nif you have a parent\nwith an anxiety disorder we have no idea\nwhether your dad actually has an anxiety\ndisorder or not we don't know whether\nyou have an anxiety disorder or not\nbut there are studies that show if you\nhave a parent who has an anxiety problem\nand you have a child who has an anxiety\nproblem\nproviding treatment to the parent\nreduces the child's anxiety\nso if you give a parent anti-anxiety\nmedication\nthe effect you see in the child is the\nsame as if you were to medicate the\nchild\nso the benefit that a child gets from\nmedication you don't have to give the\nchild the medication you just give the\nparent the medication and the child\nimproves by the same amount\nand so we know that there's there's a\nvery very strong relationship between\nparental anxiety and the child's anxiety\nand essentially i think what happened\nwith you is that\ndespite being reassured you were still\ntold to be afraid\nso what's happened is your fear even\nthough you have nothing to worry about\nyour your dad was still worrying which\nmeans that your brain learned that\nthat reassurance has no impact on the\nfear does that make sense\nso yeah so yes that makes much sense so\nnormal people\ni'm afraid\nand if nothing happens i feel better but\nwhat happened in your situation is you\nwere taught that no matter how good\nthings look you should still be afraid\neven if we have plenty of money it could\nbe gone tomorrow\nand so what's happened now is that in\nsituations where i've seen people like\nthis i mean we're not 100 sure this is\nwhat's going on with you but\nmay fit\nis that the fear has become completely\ndivorced from reality\nyes right because you're not like\nreassured because like there was nothing\nto worry about and your dad was like be\nafraid be afraid be afraid and your\nbrain is looking around and you're like\ni'm confused what am i supposed to be\nafraid of there's nothing to be afraid\nof and your dad is like no no you have\nto be afraid and then you were like wait\nbut if if i if there's reassuring stuff\nand i should still be afraid that\ndisconnects\nreality from my fear\ndoes that make sense yes yes makes so\nmuch sense and and then what happens\nwith your dad is like you someone in\nchat said this and i was gonna say the\nsame thing\nyou're waiting for the other shoe to\ndrop have you heard that phrase before\nyes and that's how it feels like right\nso what you've learned is that no matter\nhow much reassuring stuff you get in\nlife\neverything could go wrong in a moment's\nnotice\nand so that fear almost becomes\nindependent and now the confusing thing\nis the fear doesn't like it doesn't know\nwhat to stick on to because everything\nin your life seems to be going pretty\nwell you got a nice boyfriend you got a\nnice job you're doing better you're\nsocial you're doing you're living your\nlife and there's so much fun and then\nthe fear is sitting there and it's\nconfused\nand it's like wait we have to be scared\nof something because\nand even though everything around us in\nreality is good like we divorced\nourselves from that a long time ago and\ndad taught us\nthat going to a party we better pray to\ngod because they're going to die on the\nway home\nyes right\nand so now that your mind is divorced\nfrom it what it's doing is it's latching\non to whatever it can find oh there's a\nbump on your arm must be cancer whew we\nfound something to be scared of\n[Laughter]\nyes yes it's true so it's almost like it\nmakes so much sense it's like an\nautomatic pattern in your mind where\nyour fear is looking for something\nnow the tricky thing here is okay so\nwhat do we do about it so the first\nquestion that i have for you is\nhave you noticed a change in how often\nor how intense the severe is over time\nyes um since i've been with my boyfriend\nwho he well he had a very nice\nupbringing and\nhe's very secure in those things he also\num i used to get triggered when he spent\nhis money at star and\nright now that doesn't happen\nbut uh since i've been with him it's\nbeen uh so much less\nuh so much that this morning when the\nbomb thing happened i was able to detach\nfrom it uh\nquickly\nbut\nbefore uh well we've been together for\nsome years so when we started dating uh\nthat thought would have been on my mind\nall day and right now that doesn't\nhappen\nso\nit's it's seriously improving\nand it's happening less but still there\nyeah okay good so that's i'm happy to\nhear that and that's what i would expect\nbecause here's the thing to understand\nwhen your fear is separate from reality\nyou need something to feed it\nand in your case it sounds like your\nparental upbringing was like feeding\nyour fear right\nand so what we tend to see\noftentimes is that when kids grow up\nwith a particular like inherited problem\nnot genetically but like you know when\nthey grow up with something like this\nthe more they spend time in the real\nworld and away from the paranoid parents\nthe less\nserious it becomes\nso like now what's happening is you're\ngetting you're getting like reality\ntesting right so your brain is learning\noh wait a minute like we actually like\ndon't need to be worried about that\nand the more that you just sort of like\nlive separately from your parents and\ni'm happy to hear that especially your\nboyfriend it sounds like is a positive\ninfluence that's also very common\nbut as as basically as your brain has\nyour own experiences it'll naturally\nstart to forget over time\nso the one thing if it's moving in the\nright direction i'd say just be careful\nabout how much time you spend with your\nparents and like be careful about you\nknow spending time with people who are a\nlittle bit more grounded in reality and\nthe more that you sort of live your own\nlife like the better the fear will\nbecome okay\nwith me so far\nyes\nyes i think um i'm with you so far and\nalso i've been\nseparated from my parents\nbecause\nwhat you say makes so much sense uh now\ni i got to understand something i i\ncouldn't understand about myself i was\ntrying to distanciate from my parents\nfor a long time and started to get very\nanxious when i thought on talking to\nthem\nand i think this may be part of it like\nthat feeling that everything goes into\nchaos again when when i talk to them yep\nright so like\nbecause you're i mean\nyeah so i think you're going to kind of\nabsorb\ntheir anxiety\nwhich we oftentimes\nfind\nsome people are kind of like that where\nthey're like a little bit more absorbent\num so another thing when you're ready\nuh honey is the other thing that you can\ntry to do this this sometimes works\nhave a conversation with your dad about\nhis fear\nand i know this sounds kind of weird\nbecause we're trying to keep distance\nfrom them but sometimes it can actually\nbe very very\neye-opening\nto be like really objective and calm and\njust listen to your dad talk about how\nirrational his fears are\nright okay right so like like when you\nactually talk to him\nyou'll realize like wow this is\nincredibly crazy\nand as your own brain matures and you're\nable to sort of like judge that\nyou may actually be able to like get\ndistance from it in your own mind\nbecause if you as you talk to him and\nyou can sort of have like open-ended\nconversation right you're not trying to\nbe judgmental you're just going to ask\ndad so that you know when we were\ngrowing up you seemed really concerned\nabout money\ncan you help me understand that\nwhy were you always so concerned about\nmoney how long have you been concerned\nabout money\nso one thing that was kind of confusing\nfor me dad is that you were worried\nabout money but we actually like took a\nlot of really nice trips we had a nice\nupbringing like help me understand\nbecause it seemed like\nin a lot of ways we were okay but you\nalways seemed worried about it can you\nhelp me understand that\nand then the more that you kind of talk\nto him\nwhat you'll start to see is like the\nirrational fears like coming out\nright and you don't want to get sucked\ninto that yes and the interesting thing\nis that when when you talk to your dad\nif you're not careful he'll slip into\nthe same pattern of oh like you have to\nbe careful honey you have to be careful\nyou can't trust anyone everything is\ngonna so you don't\nso so if you but the interesting thing\nis if you start asking him\nabout his life and his experience and\nhis views it's going to feel very\ndifferent\ndoes that make sense it's not going to\nbe like the autopilot conversation\nyes\nyes i understand because i talk to him\nand hear his fears but it's like i'm\nrunning away from hearing it exactly so\nthis is this is the opposite and that\nthat may be very yep but the key thing\nis that you don't want to get swept up\nby his stuff right you want to try to\ncontrol the conversation and you want to\nlisten\nand as you listen to him just be careful\nwith what happens within you if you feel\nyourself getting triggered and stuff\nlike that pull yourself away from the\nconversation you may not be ready for it\nyet\nbut eventually what i'd love is if you\ncan have a conversation\nwhere you can like hear him and also\nlike be calm yourself like don't get\nsucked into it so that you can really\nkind of see like how how hard this has\nbeen for him and you can even say things\nlike oh dad it sounds like it's been\nvery hard for you worrying all of these\nyears\nand i can see that you worry about us\ntoday too\nthat sounds really really hard\nand then he may start crying or whatever\nlike you never know right and then like\nyou're gonna give him a hug and then\ny'all will like you know cry together\nand then it's gonna feel weird and\nbut like hopefully at the end of it both\ny'all will feel better\nbeing him maybe he'll start screaming at\nthe middle because he don't want to get\nmore questions that happens too yeah so\nso that's why you want to be so you then\nbe extra careful but you want to be like\nopen-ended and non-judgmental\nright so so and like give it a shot yes\ni understand but i think\nhoney just to kind of um\nyou know recap so the first thing i i'd\nseriously consider getting a clinical\nevaluation\nsecond thing to kind of understand is\nthat\nyou know essentially your mind\nnormally your mind thinks that\nfear is tied to reality and gets\nreinforced through what happens in the\nreal world\nthe interesting thing is that despite\nthe real world\ntelling you hey everything is okay\neverything is okay everything is okay it\nsounds like your parents really\ncontradicted that and they were like no\nno it's not okay you can't trust the\nworld honey you can't trust the world\nand the more that you started to do that\nthen what happens is your mind is like\nokay we can't trust the world in terms\nof like reassuring so we've got to be\nscared no matter what\nnothing the world can do will ever put\nus at ease because we can't trust the\nworld\nyes\nyes that's\nthat's very accurate how am i right well\nmy parents are yes and and so you\ncarried some of that with you but the\ngood news is as we grow into adults and\nwe form our own relationships and we\nlearn our own lessons as you keep on\ndoing that i think this problem will\nslowly get better and better and better\nand the last thing if you ever want to\nreally do this it can be a little bit\nmore intense is that you can have a\nconversation with your dad where you\nreally\nlisten\nto what he's saying and then you judge\nfor yourself like how irrational it\nsounds and sometimes doing that can help\nyou with your own irrational thoughts\nand you can even sort of say oh there's\nthe voice of my dad it's not even my\nvoice\nthis is the voice of my dad that i'm\nhearing within me that's an echo from\nall the times he's talked to me in the\npast\nand that can be quite\nhealing to do\nokay yeah that's amazing i could never\nthought of that\nit's great thank you dr k of course good\nluck honey\nthank you and um thanks for all the work\nyou've done i learned a lot from you uh\nnot just for me for myself but to\nunderstand others and\ngreat and be able to to really listen\nand\nnot try to guess what everyone's\nthinking so\nthank you smart seriously good luck to\nyou\nthank you take care\nbye bye\nall right so let's do a quick recap\nso the tricky thing is sometimes our\nmind has this part that's just always\nafraid\nis always afraid of the other shoe\ndropping and it's kind of weird right\nbecause normally\nif we're afraid of something\nand it doesn't happen we should calm\ndown\nlike when reality does not mirror our\nfears we should be reassured oh i'm\nafraid that you know some a meteor is\ngonna fall out of the sky and then a\ncouple hours go by no meteor falls out\nof the sky and then i'm like okay\ni don't need to worry\nthat's normally what should happen with\na fear right is that a fear will either\nbe reinforced by reality and then our\nbrain learns oh wait i do need to worry\nabout this\nor\nour fear will be\nreassured by reality because the thing\nthat action doesn't happen and then our\nmind is like okay we don't need to worry\nabout that\nthe tricky thing is that sometimes our\nfears seem completely divorced from\nreality\nand actually what can happen if we\ntunnel down into this sometimes what we\nfind is that early on despite the fact\nthat reality is reassuring you\nyou were taught to still be afraid often\ntimes by a parental figure\nsomeone in your life was like you can't\ntrust reality you can't trust reality\nyou can't trust reality\nand as you internalize that lesson\nthen you're kind of screwed because all\nof the fears that you have can never be\nreassured because the real world no\nlonger like counteracts your fear\nand so we carry this fear with us over\nand over and over again and the weird\nthing about the fear is that since\nthere's nothing to actually be afraid of\nit kind of like looks for whatever it\ncan find so on a particular day it'll be\nafraid of this on another day it'll be\nafraid of that oh we've got a bump on\nour arm maybe it's cancer oh no it's a\nmosquito bite so we're not worried about\nthat anymore let me worry about\nsomething else\nso it's like the fear exists as an\nemotion and is looking for a\nmanifestation\nand it finds whatever small signal it\ncan in the real world and puts all of\nthe emotional energy into that weird\nlittle signal\noh so-and-so didn't text me back maybe\nthere they had a heart attack oh my god\nright that's what the the fear does\nso what do you do about this the first\nthing to understand is that sometimes\nthis is what a clinical anxiety disorder\nmanifests as\nso sometimes if it's focused on on being\nsick and things like that we call that\nillness anxiety disorder sometimes it\ncan also be uh generalized anxiety\ndisorder where we sort of think about\npeople as worriers\nright so they worry about all kinds of\ndifferent stuff that's why we call it\ngeneralized anxiety disorder it's not\nfocal on a particular area\nso it's worth getting clinically\nevaluated if this kind of like falls\ninto your experience\nand the other thing to kind of recognize\nis that like over time you have to be\nreally careful about what influences\ntaught you that reality and fear are\nlike two completely separate things\nand ideally as you start to live life a\nlittle bit form additional relationships\nhave additional experiences your brain\ncan start to learn oh it actually turns\nout that reality and fear is connected\nand the more that you can sort of\nconnect to those the more oddly enough\nthe fear will actually go down\nso great call\nyou"
