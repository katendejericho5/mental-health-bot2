    "transcript": "and then people get really frustrated\nwith themselves because even though they\nknow logically that they should change\nthey're not really addressing their\ninternal conflict me watching healthy\ngamer gg knowing damn well i'm not doing\nanything to improve my life\nso sometimes\nthere is content on the internet\ndesigned to help you improve your life\nand do you know who makes content\ndesigned to help you improve your life\nwe do\nand you watch the content\nand you even see other people\nwho will post on things like subreddit\nwith wins and other people will say i'm\nmaking progress\nwe had a great uh you know post the\nother day where people were like does\nanyone actually like who works on\nthemselves is anyone actually found a\npartner\nand\nand people are like yes yes we have\nso there are people out there like so\nyou're watching the content that's\ndesigned to help your life\nand there are people out there that are\nactually doing stuff about it\nbut all you're doing is just watching\nand you're not doing anything about it\nand so then you're kind of like\nnow what\nhow like it's it's one thing to to start\nwatching the right content it's another\nthing to actually change your life\nso this is kind of interesting\nbecause you may think that my response\nto this is going to be okay cool awesome\ndr k is now going to teach me\nhow to not just watch things and do\nstuff instead\nright because that's what i need what i\nreally need is to learn how to do stuff\ninstead of just watching stuff\nnot going to do that\nnope nope nope\nwhat i'm going to teach you today\nis even better than that\nit's how to change your life without\ndoing anything\nwithout doing a damn thing\nhow to just watch\nand do nothing\nand still improve your life\nnow you may think to yourself this is\ninsane\nbut we're going to explain this to y'all\nand what this comes down to\nis the science of learning in the\nscience of change\nso let's take a big big step back\nokay big step back\nhow do people change if you want to\nchange let's start by understanding how\npeople change\nand does doing stuff\nis doing stuff how people change\nhold on a second let's think about that\nright\nso\ndoing stuff is not how people change\nit's what it looks like after you change\ndo you all get that\nthe doing stuff comes after the change\nnot before the change\nso this is really great because if\nyou're just a watcher you can actually\nchange and then you can start doing\nstuff but all you have to do is watch\nand so let's understand this a little\nbit okay it's cool because we actually\nhave really great science on this\nso let's first start by understanding\nwhat do we mean by the word change what\ndoes it mean to change so what i'm going\nto do is make sort of a leap which i\nthink is a fair leap to make i'm going\nto substitute the word change with the\nword learn\nso if we look at like fundamentally in\nour brain\nwhat parts of our brain govern changing\nit's the same parts of our brain that\ngovern learning right so i'll give you a\nsimple example let's say that i burn my\nhand on a hot stove\nnext time around do i burn my hand again\nno i've changed my behavior what\ncircuits in the brain govern that kind\nof change the learning circuits of the\nbrain\nright so we'll sort of like\nand we're going to take a step back also\nand look at another sort of dimension\nwhich is\nthis this concept of the stages of\nchange model which we use in addiction\ntreatment\nso what tends to happen is if someone's\nstruggling with an addiction they'll try\nto go sober right so they make an\nattempt at a change and it doesn't work\nthey relapse then they try again and it\ndoesn't work try again doesn't work and\nthen one day\nif you talk to them this is actually\nwhat they'll say i i woke up on monday\nmorning and i was like enough is enough\ni'm done with this forever\nno more\nand then\nthey get rid of all their alcohol and\nthey never have another drink again\nthere's a little bit more to it than\nthat but if you actually talk to people\nwho've become sober\nthis is the way that they will describe\ntheir sobriety\nnot everyone but it absolutely happens\nright so if you even think about your\nown life that something that you started\ndoing that you didn't used to do before\nso maybe it's like drinking water\ninstead of soda\none maybe it's like waking up on time\nmaybe it's doing yoga maybe it's like\ninstalling a meditation app\nmaybe it's like setting a boundary with\nyour friends maybe it's like\nuninstalling a particular video game\nlike\neach and every one of us has made some\nkind of change in our lives\nand if you really think about it how did\nthat happen and chances are you were\njust sort of like\none day i kind of woke up and was like\nokay i'm done with this\nand then you change\nbut what what the hell\nlike how does that work\nand so this is where it's kind of\ninteresting\nbut there's a lot of like subconscious\nprocessing that needs to go on and\nthat's essentially the process of\nlearning so you'd like you know you\nrelapse once and you don't learn your\nlesson you really relapse again you\ndon't learn your lesson you really\nrelapse the third time you don't learn\nyour lesson the fourth time around you\nrelapse and you learn your lesson and\nthen your behavior changes even in our\nvocabulary we have i didn't learn my\nlesson\nwhat does that mean that means i didn't\nchange those two statements are\nsynonymous you'll get that he never\nlearns his lesson she never learns her\nlesson they never learn their lesson\nso changing and learning are 100\nsynonymous\nokay so there are a couple things we're\ngoing to talk about changing first then\nwe're going to talk about learning\nso the stages of change\nthere\nwhat we sort of realized is that in\norder to enact behavioral change\nto actually change your behavior there\nare a set of cognitive stages that you\nhave to go through this is almost like\nthe uh kubler ross you know stages of\ngrief\nlike denial and anger and bargaining so\nlike we have a cognitive process that we\nkind of go through\nso the first stage is pre-contemplative\npre-contemplative means i'm not even\nthinking about it i'm not aware that\nthere is a problem\nokay so this is like i never realized\nthat drinking alcohol was bad or playing\nvideo games or bad or whatever\ni'm going to use addiction sort of as a\nis a backdrop for this okay context but\nstages of change applies to everything\nfrom eating healthy to exercising any\nkind of change that you want to make\nso like we don't even know it's a\nproblem so what's the solution\nhow do you work on someone who disagrees\nor is not aware that there's a problem\ndo you give them a plan do you give them\nan advice do you say here's five things\nyou can do to improve your life and then\ndo they do those things no because they\ndon't have the motivation because\nthey're not actually like they don't\neven think it's a problem\nso sort of like in denial\nor it's really lack of awareness but it\ncan sometimes be denial\nso what is the solution for someone who\nis pre-contemplative\nlike\nnot really even sure what the problem is\nit's to challenge their assumptions how\ndo you challenge their assumptions\nthrough questions and information\nso that's part of what we do\nright so we'll sort of say like even at\nthe beginning of this video we were like\noh great dr k is going to teach me how\nto change no we're not going to teach\nyou how to change\nwe're going to challenge your\nassumptions of how change happens we're\nnot going to get you to act at all we're\njust going to explain something else\nwe're going to give you information\nthe interesting thing the really cool\nthing\nis that when you take pre-contemplative\npeople and it's not just information\nit's really challenging assumptions i\ncan't like give you research benefits of\nokay here are all the reasons you can\nchange that's not that's not effective\nit's to get people to challenge and\nunderstand their own thought process to\nstart thinking in a different way\nonce you do that once you start to\nchallenge people's assumptions which you\ncan do through watching a video on the\ninternet by the way\nthen you move on to contemplative and\ncontemplative is where a lot of people\nget tripped up because now you realize\nthat there's a problem\nbut the key hallmark of the\ncontemplative phase is ambivalence or\ninternal conflict\ni recognize now that video games\ncause problems in my life\nbut\ni really love playing them\nbut i don't know what else to do with my\nlife but i'm still unemployed and i\ndon't know how to film my days but this\nand then people get really frustrated\nwith themselves because even though they\nknow logically that they should change\nthey're not really addressing their\ninternal conflict\nso that's a whole different thing\nand then once you work through that\ninternal conflict\nthen you can change then you can\nactually start to act because you know i\nknow i need to stop playing video games\nbut there's this other part of me that\ndoesn't want to so then i wake up every\nday what do i actually do\ni don't change i'm one of these people\nwho's just\nsitting here\nwatching and not actually quitting\nsomething or starting something or\nchanging\nthat's actually okay too it takes time\nto get through that\nambivalent conflict\nright you don't just like logically snap\nout of it it's like you have to work\nthrough that\nit's almost like i don't know if y'all\nhave ever like looked at a menu and it's\nlike do i want this or do i want this\nit's not like you suddenly snap to it\nright it's a very short abbreviated time\nbut 15 seconds 30 seconds 60 seconds\nwell what if i like this what if i don't\nlike this you go through this little\nmental process in about a minute or two\nor maybe five minutes where you're\nstruggling to decide what you want\nbecause there's conflict within you and\nthen you resolve that in some way and\nyou pick something\nso even in in a menu and ordering\nsomething off a menu you can understand\nambivalence a little bit\nokay\nonce you get through ambivalence then\nyou can start to act my point here\nthough is that the first two stages\nof the stages of change model are\ncompletely internal you don't have to do\na damn thing\nit's in here this is where change\nhappens so your watching is actually\nokay\nnow what we're gonna do\nis teach all a little bit about learning\nso if i'm watching a video\nat the end of the video\nthere's a cool concept got me to\nquestion my assumptions\nbut i don't actually change i haven't\nlike learned my lesson so how do you\nlearn your lesson how do you incorporate\nthe stuff from the video so i'm going to\nask y'all a question\nokay\nwhat's the most effective way to study\nright because we know this like we can\nlike we can we can look at different\noptions to understand literally how our\nbrain learns\nso let's say i've got\n10 hours that i'm gonna prepare for a\ntest\noption number one\ni read the textbook for 10 hours\noption number two i read the textbook\nfor five five hours and i do practice\nquestions for five hours\nwhich one is going to result in a better\ntest score on average\noption two hands down\nso this is really important to\nunderstand\nwe have a part of our brain called the\nhippocampus okay hippocampus is what\ntakes short-term memory\nand\ncompounds it into long-term memory once\nit's in long-term memory we can access\nit and utilize it\nso when something is in short-term\nmemory it doesn't really change our\nbehavior it really has to be like baked\ninto us and that happens in the\nhippocampus by the way also happens\nduring sleep\nokay is when we compound short-term\nmemory into long-term memory\nbut the other key thing is that learning\nsomething involves practicing recall\nnot putting it in\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain\nso if you don't want to do anything to\nchange you actually don't need to\nbut if you want to change without doing\na damn thing which is actually\nironically where most of the change\nhappens most of the change happens\nwithout action\nright because who are you fighting\nagainst you're fighting with yourself\nyou're fighting with your motivation\nyou're fighting with your lack of\nmotivation your laziness your discipline\nall the stuff is in here\nso here are three things\nreally simple if you don't want to do a\ndamn thing\nthree things you can do\ncompletely on your ass without doing\nanything the first\nis don't chain watch\ninformational content or motivational\nvideos\nso when you chain watch something\nnothing ever gets put into long-term\nmemory\nbecause you have a certain amount of ram\nand whenever you have like a certain\namount of ram\nwhat starts happening is stuff starts\ngetting overwritten\nso we'll even like i'll call this out\nexplicitly in my interviews and i also\ndo this with patients\nbut what i've learned is when i teach\nsomeone something or like in an\ninterview like why do we have interviews\nat about two hours instead of three\nhours it's because by the third hour\nmost people forget what happened in the\nfirst hour\nand we don't want people to forget what\nhappened in the first hour because it's\nnot like what happened to the third hour\nis better than what happened in the\nfirst hour\nso one of my favorite phrases from a\nspiritual guru is enough for today\nenough for today\nyou have only a certain amount of ram\nand if you really want to learn your\nlesson\nyou can't\nlike keep learning new stuff you have to\nlike give it time to sink in so don't\nchain watch informational videos or\nmotivational videos or whatever\nthe more you replace your ram the less\nyou're going to learn\nso\nit's actually watch less stuff like you\ndon't have to do anything but just\nso if you've if you watch something that\nyou really think oh wow\nthis could actually help me a lot\npause don't keep watching stuff\nokay\nso don't chain watch don't overwrite\nyour ram\nlet it go down into the hard drive\nsecond thing you've got to do is reflect\nit's not a damn thing it's not doing a\ndamn thing\nreflect\nwhat does that mean we're going to\nmirror this process of okay i can read\nthe textbook for 10 hours or i can read\nthe textbook and i can do practice\nquestions\nwhat is the equivalent of practice\nquestions\nfor changing it's actually just\nreflection so instead of chain watching\nvideos what you're going to do is watch\none video\nand you're going to go sit somewhere\nand you're not going to distract your\nmind with anything else and you're going\nto reflect on what you what what you\nwatched not gonna do anything\njust reflect\npractice recall okay what did the video\nsay\nwhat do i think about that\nwhat's right about the video what's\nwrong about the video\nplay with the information so there's the\nother thing that we sort of know is that\nmastery within the human mind comes\nthrough experimentation\nyou can follow recipes as much as you\nwant to and you'll learn how to be a\ndecent cook but to be a chef that\ncreates dishes you have to play around\nwith stuff\nso if you want to change you've got to\nplay around with it in your mind okay\nwhat about this do i accept what about\nthis do i not accept the more that you\nrecall that information out of your your\nmind the more it solidifies into\nlearning and the more that change\nhappens\nso we see this principle playing around\nwith the information is also what we do\nfor example in coaching\nor in therapy\nwe challenge people's assumptions in\ncoaching\nright so it's not about treating a\ndiagnosis or anything like that if\nsomeone says i'm stuck in this bad job\nand there's no way i can get out we want\nto challenge those assumptions and we\nget people to reflect on their life\nas people challenge their assumptions\nand reflect on their life\ni kid you not\nand if you have worked with a coach you\ncan ask your coach this question\na lot of coaches will come in and will\nsay we're like this person they're\ntalking about this thing they're talking\nabout this thing but they just don't do\nit they just don't do it i don't want to\npush them i want to push them i want to\npush them\nand what do we tell our coaches at that\ntime should you push them no\nabsolutely not\nand inevitably what happens is the coach\nfeels i'm doing a bad job bad job week\nfive they're not making progress week\nsix they're not making progress week\nseven coach shows up and they're like i\ndon't know what the hell happened they\ndid it all\nand seriously if y'all have a coach ask\nyour coach if they've experienced this\nbefore 99 chance they'll say yes\nthis is how change happens\nit's like the iceberg where most of that\nsubconscious change happens underneath\nthe interesting thing is if your coach\npushes you\nwhat happens when you get pushed\na lot of people will dig their heels in\nbut when you create that vacuum of space\nthe client will step forward and do it\nright beautiful so cat chat got it so\nit's really hard to do the reflection\nwork\nand to think about this kind of stuff\nbut that's actually all you don't have\nto do anything\nright so like this is where like when we\ndesigned our coaching program we looked\nat the science of change in the science\nof learning and now we're sharing it\nwith you right now you can do this on\nyour own\nmay not be quite as effective because\nthey won't you can't challenge your\nassumptions quite in the way that they\ncan but if you're just watching\ninformation\nthat's okay\nright just watch it\ndon't chain watch it\nreflect on it play around with it sit on\na park bunch somewhere and think about\nit why is this so hard for me\nwhat works for me what doesn't work for\nme\nand that process of reflection\nis actually going to engage the same\ncircuits as like the recall and once we\nstart recalling it we start to get\nmastery over it once we have mastery\nover it then it's in our tool belt\nthird thing\nyou've gotta do\nor not do which should be really easy\nbecause the whole point here is that\nyou're not gonna do anything\nso what do we call someone who doesn't\ndo anything\nwhat do we call someone who doesn't act\npeople are saying lazy\nlazy bum\nlazy\nincorrect\nslacker\nwe call that person\npatient\nwhat does it mean to be patient\nwhat is someone who is imp what is\nsomeone who is impatient\ndo anything\neverything what is that what does it\nmean to be impatient means that i can't\nwait i have to act\nthird thing is be patient\nand for those of you that don't want to\ndo a damn thing patience should actually\ncome easily for you\nit won't but\nright so if you want to change your life\nwithout acting\nthese are the three things\nbe patient\ndon't override your ram\nand reflect\nthat's where change really happens\nso what tends to happen when people get\nimpatient\nthey haven't done the requisite work\nunderneath\nand so they're\nlaunching an expedition that is doomed\nto failure\nbe patient with yourself don't beat\nyourself up it doesn't help\nrecognize that change happens slowly\njust as an example people are like how\nslowly\nso i failed my basically failed my first\nyear of college\nright\nhad like a 1.6 gpa or whatever\nnine years later\ni got into medical school\nlike oh my god nine years\nthat's a long time\ndoes that mean that it's gonna take me\nnine years i don't think so so the good\nnews is with help you can see change\nmuch more rapidly right we don't have\npeople come into our coaching program\nall right here's your nine-year plan we\nstart to see change within six to eight\nweeks and that really solidifies around\n12 weeks 16 weeks right so there's a\nprocess that you can speed it up also in\nterms of therapy if you look at like\nyou know standard trials for\npsychotherapy are looking at changes at\nthe eight week mark 12 week mark things\nlike that\nso with help you can do it faster but be\npatient with yourself\nrecognize that change takes time\nand if you're not ready to act because\nwhat happens when you force yourself to\nact when you act impatiently you just\ndoom yourself to failure as you doom\nyourself to failure your hope decreases\nit becomes harder to act\nright if i apply for five different jobs\nwithout\nspending the time and energy to build a\ngood resume and i can become more and\nmore impatient\nlike\nwhat's gonna happen i'm gonna lose hope\nin the job application process and i'm\ngoing to start to think okay there's no\nway i'm ever going to get a job\nso be patient with yourself\nso if you want to change your life\nwithout lifting a finger\nit's fine to watch stuff\njust don't chain watch\ngive that stuff an opportunity to sink\nin literally\nlet your short-term memory compound into\nthe hippocampus is long-term memory and\nthen what happens when something is\nlong-term memory it bubbles up\nright when i ask you what's two plus two\nthe answer bubbles up why does it bubble\nup because it's been solidified within\nyou and what do people struggle with\nthey struggle with the fact that the\nright thoughts don't bubble up\nhow do you get the right thoughts to\nbubble up you let them solidify\nso don't chain watch informational or\nmotivational videos\nnumber two reflect practice the process\nof bubbling up bubbling up is natural\nbut you can recall it so reflect after\nyou watch a video go and sit somewhere\nand do nothing\nand think about it okay what applies to\nme does this apply to me does this not\napply to me do i disagree with it do i\nnot disagree with it why does this feel\nso bad what do i notice within myself\nwow this is kind of weird like the more\ni'm reflecting the more i'm sort of\nstarting to feel guilty but what am i\neven feeling guilty about what do i have\nto feel guilty about\noh\ninteresting what i feel guilty about is\nthat i've known this all along but i\nhaven't been able to do it\nthird thing is be patient\ndon't act\ngive it time\nif you do these three things you will be\nwell along your your road to change\ncan you take notes during the reflective\nperiod absolutely\nall right dr k it's time to go apply\ngoodbye\nas much as you're meaning honestly like\nthat's probably not a bad idea\nright so like i will just think about\nthat like as you're beaming right\nso like i on twitch you're like all\nright i'm peacing out if you're on\nyoutube you're looking at the suggested\nplaylist and there's another like\nactually like\ni know it's a meme but\nthat's recall you all get that\ngigonomics\nis applying the information\nright and so this is going to be kind of\nweird where it's sort of like\ni guess if you really want to have this\ndrive home then leave\nand i want you all to just think about\nthat for a second because\neven if we go over let's say like we\ncover three or four concepts today\nat the end of it the other reason if i\ni'm trying to get you all to stay\nright is notice what happens so notice\nhow you felt over the course the last 10\nminutes\nright and then like what's going to\nhappen to that feeling or the revelation\nor what you've understood as i cover the\nnext thing and the next thing in the\nnext thing\nyou're gonna forget\nit'll fade away it won't sink in\nright\nstep one was\ndon't chain watch stuff because you're\ngoing to overwrite your ram\nah so so just a low is saying ban them\nso they apply what they learned no see\nthat's the opposite\nthey have to leave we can't ban them do\nyou understand that it's the same thing\nas a coach not pushing you\nbecause if we ban them they're like\nscrew you\nso one of\none of the most rewarding experiences i\none time had was someone who came into\nmy office general you know\nsuper generic scenario happened more\nthan once but i'm thinking about one\nperson in particular\nwho's anxious about getting fired\nand a year later after doing a lot of\ninternal work they quit\nthere's a huge difference between\nwhen life does something to you and you\nchoose to do it even if it's the same\nthing\nme choosing to break up with a partner\nis different from the partner\ndumping me\neven though the end result is like sort\nof the same\nso y'all have to act\nthe more that we try to force you to act\nthe worse it's going to go and so we're\nactually going to go all the way out\nthere's like you're going to act at all\nbecause the truth of the matter is the\nway that we learn\nthe way that we change is actually not\nthrough action\nit's up here\nyou"
