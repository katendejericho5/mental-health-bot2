    "transcript": "stop caring what other people think\nthere's the predators and the prey and\ni'm going to be a predator and you're\ngoing to be praying no like i hate to\nbreak it to you but predators and prey\nlike that happens in the serengeti\nnot in human society\ni don't see any masculinity within\nmyself i 20m have never really talked to\nwomen at all in high school so i've been\ntrying to put myself out there\nby getting on dating apps and\ntransferring schools to be around more\nwomen\ni've been looking into self-improvement\nthrough working out and reading more\nbooks like atomic habits\ni recently started reading models by\nmark manson\nand it's an interesting read but reading\nabout what women are most attracted to\nmakes me really wonder if i have any of\nthose traits i never really had a great\nfather figure growing up my dad is\nchronically depressed has no friends and\nhas been unemployed for several years\nnow he's one of the most sensitive\npeople i know in my life and is the\npolar opposite of what i see in a man\nhe would get emotional about the most\nminute criticisms and get overly anxious\nfor the smallest things like trying to\ntalk to strangers or if i accidentally\ninjure myself like getting a small cut\nor bruise\nfor the longest time he was even scared\nof me learning how to cook in fear of me\npossibly injuring myself\nmy mom always told me i have a lot of\ntraits similar to my dad when it comes\nto anxiety and sensitivity and i\nhonestly never saw that as a problem\nuntil i started getting into\nself-improvement and dating\noverall my parents really cared a lot\nabout sharing my emotions which really\nhelped me a lot with some of my\ndepressive episodes but i can't really\nsee how those traits are attractive at\nall to women\nmanson describes the ideal man as\nsomeone who is confident and doesn't\ncare about what other people think\nfor as long as i can remember i've\nalways deeply cared about what others\nthought of me and would typically get\nvery emotional if someone disagreed with\nme over the slightest topics like like\nliking a certain video game or tv show\ni've also been more prone to depression\nas i've had several episodes including\none where i had to be home schooled for\nall of sixth grade\nthat sounds rough dude\ni've never had any confidence in myself\nand i've always been more emotional than\nother guys and i have no clue how anyone\nwill find that attractive\nit doesn't help that i've been either\nskinny or fat my entire life and it's\nbeen so hard to gain muscle recently due\nto some health problems i've been having\nlately\ni've never had any athletic hobbies and\ni'm interested in a bunch of nerdy stuff\nand also studying computer engineering\neverything i see within myself is\nantithetical to what women value most in\na strong bold confident man\ni'm just an overly emotional nerd with\nlittle self-esteem to support myself and\naccording to every successful chad out\nthere\ni'm a beta virgin loser who will never\nscore with anyone\nso this is tough\nbecause sometimes\nwe grow up\nand we start\nwe have a lack of experience right\nso like we're we're like concerned we're\n20 years old this is going to be sort of\nmale focused\num\nwe're 20 years old we have no experience\nlike talking to girls or dating or\nthings like that\nwe've got no positive role models right\nbecause dad is depressed unemployed is\noverly emotionally sensitive\nwe don't like really know what to do\nwith ourselves so enter self-improvement\nso we start to read books and we find\nanswers so books written by mark manson\nright and so like you know he wrote the\nsubtle art of not giving an f\nthis guy knows what he's talking about\nhe's a new york times best-selling\nauthor and whatnot\nright and then mark manson says these\nare the answers you have to be confident\nyou have to not care what other people\nthink\nthis is what it takes to\nthis is the truth\nhe is the he's the speaker of truth this\nis what women want\nand then you don't have those things\nand so what does that mean for you\nright so like if you kind of fall into\nthis bucket like you're kind of like\nokay so like i got\ndealt a kind of crappy hand with no role\nmodels\ni missed the boat on certain like\nclinical uh critical experiences like i\ndidn't grow up learning how to talk to\nthe opposite sex\nright and then i started like reading\nstuff and the more i read stuff the more\ni realized how screwed i am\nand then what happens is we start to get\nthis like creeping fear that like we're\ndoomed to failure\nright and then sometimes you're just\nlike i'm screwed\nit's gg\nit's over\nso the more that we educate ourselves\nthe more we realize how screwed we are\nand so like what do you do about this\nlike if you're not masculine enough\nand like you don't know how to relate to\nother people like like what do you do in\nthis situation\nright and then what happens is as you\nfind the answers like as you read these\nbooks like people give you answers\nyou know i don't know if y'all caught\nour our last stream where we talked\nabout basically the model that these\npeople use is by breeding in security\nbecause the more insecure they make you\nfeel and the more that they say\nby the way i have the answer\nhere here it is\nright\nuse my course or buy the essential\nmanly chad secrets\nfor 59.99\nthree easy payments\nthat's their model\nbut as you read this stuff like mark\nmanson's like a pretty reputable dude\nright i don't know i haven't read this\nbook so i don't know\nhow well he cites what women want and\nwe'll get to that in a second but he\ntells you here are the answers\nand this is the common answer there's a\nmost common answer that we tend to see\nas someone who is confident and doesn't\ncare about what other people think\nand then here you are you've always\ncared about what other people thought\nyou cared too much about what other\npeople thought\nand that sort of makes sense right\nbecause if you're someone who's been\nsocially anxious\nand has been always concerned about what\npeople think\nand the one thing that you wish you\ncould change about your life you could\nchange one thing it's that stupid voice\nin your head that's like\noh my god what are they going to think\nwhat are they going to think what are\nthey going to think because that voice\nparalyzes you it keeps you from going to\nparties even if you go to parties you're\nnot able to enjoy yourself even if you\ngo to parties and who cares about\nenjoyment but you can't\nseem competent to other people because\nyou're so stuck in your head\nand the social anxiety gets the better\nof you and then they see the social\nanxiety and the whole thing gets worse\nand it all kind of falls apart\nand so they say oh stop caring what\nother people think\nand then you stop caring what other\npeople think and then you know what you\nbecome do you become confident\nmaybe\nchances are if you stop caring what\nother people think which you'll really\nbecome as an\nbecause that's what people become\nif they stop caring what other people\nthink\nbut that's the thing right is you want\nto get rid of that because that thing\nlike\njust\ntortures your life\nso you're screwed\nand you need to get rid of it i need to\nbecome calloused\nbecause my anxiety controls me so much\nmy emotions control me so much what's\nthe only solution\nto numb myself and become calloused\nand look mark manson said it too\nso it must be real and all these like\nalphas say like yeah like stop caring\nwhat other people think there's the\npredators and the prey and i'm going to\nbe a predator and you're going to be\npraying no like i hate to break it to\nyou but predators and prey like that\nhappens in the serengeti\nnot in human society\nright\nlike i don't think so anyway i think\nmost of like\nmost of human society is like honestly\nit's like\npve co-op\nlike most human beings try to help each\nother\nand like we kind of get along and we\nform friendships and we form connections\nright predators and prey i don't think\nso i'm not saying i'm 100\nobjectively correct in that i think that\nthere's a lot of scientific evidence\nthat shows that human society is\ncommunal and altruistic for the most\npart\nright like i think we can sort of safely\nassume that\nbut that's the tricky thing is that\nyou're controlled by all this negativity\nand so then people come along and say\nhey be confident cal become callous\nbecome numb\nstop caring what other people think and\nit seems like such a relief to you right\nbecause those are the thoughts that\ntorture you\nso what do you do if you're kind of in\nthis situation\nif you're like\ntoo emotional not manly enough\nlike don't have a good role model\nmissed out on some key experiences so\nnow you're like 20 and it's like too\nlate and then like these self-help books\nseem to be helping but they also like\nkind of make you feel a little bit i'm\nkind of screwed\nso we're going to talk i'm going to give\nyou all kind of five things to work on\nin terms of like building confidence and\ntackling this issue of self-esteem and\nlike how to get there and especially as\nit sort of relates to dating\nokay\nso this is going to be sort of a\nheteronormative masculine approach but\nwe'll touch on variations hopefully at\nthe end a little bit\nso the first thing that you all got to\ndo is be careful about generalizations\nbe very very careful about\ngeneralizations let's start with this\nidea of masculinity\nwhat does it mean to be masculine enough\nright so am i masculine enough\ni i don't know what do you what do you\nthink\nwhat makes me masculine enough is it\nfacial hair because i don't have facial\nhair or like facial hair is masculine\nso we're like i don't have facial hair\ndo people without facial hair like have\nare they masculine enough is it the\nability to change a tire\ni can change a tire i can grill do those\nthings make me masculine are there\nmasculine people who don't know how to\ngrill\nbut there are some people who are like\nnon-binary or women and they know how to\ngrill does that make them masculine\nis it\nphysical fitness that makes people\nmasculine\nis the dalai lama masculine enough like\ni don't know like can he get laid like\nwho knows\nit's like who like what this idea of\nmasculinity\ni'm not an expert in this stuff okay\nbut it's like it's an idea\nright like so who is masculine enough\nyou know who's masculine enough james\nbond\nthat's about as masculine as you you can\nget\nand news flash\njames bond is a fictional character\ndoesn't actually exist\nso our standard of masculinity is\nfictional\nso this is what i want you to do go out\nthe next time you go out in public like\ngo to the grocery store\nlook around at all of the men\nand then like as you see men you'll see\nsome of them are in relationships and\nsome of them have children and then look\nat how masculine the men who have kids\nare\nand you'll see that there's a wide\nvariety range of baldness\nand you know\ndad guts\nand like you know dad bods and and\nfacial hair and like\nsome of them are gonna like have weak\njawlines and like it's like a whole\nmishmash of stuff you can also apply\nthis if you're a woman in this sort of\nsituation you don't think you're girly\nenough or feminine enough right like\nthere's all kinds of women out there\nso like be careful about that\ngeneralization because now what you're\ndoing is you're living up to a fiction\nyou're striving for something it's like\nhow do you know if you're masculine\nenough like\nwhat what does that mean to be masculine\nenough like how do you measure it how\nare you gonna know it's a feeling\nwe'll get to where it comes from in a\nsecond\nyou all get that it's like not a real\nthing\nit's a feeling the feeling is real\nbut there's no like\nmasculometer\nright that measures your masculinity if\nit's above 7.5 it's whatever\nso it's like i'm not saying there's\nnothing to the idea of masculinity but\nwhat i'm saying is when it comes to your\npersonal and very real life\naspiring to a fictional ideal is not\nsomething that you want to do without\nthinking about it critically\nso i'm not saying that you also can't\naspire to be certain things that james\nbond is which is fine\nbut just be critical about what's the\nmeasure that you're\ngoing for like what does it mean to be\nmasculine enough\ni don't know\ndo you it's like okay so let me tell you\nif you're watching this video and this\nresonates with you chances are\nyou don't know what it means to be\nmasculine enough all you really know is\nthat you're not it\nyou'll get that that's all you know\nyou don't know what it means to reach\nthe top of the mountain all you know is\nthat there's a long way to go\nso it's a it's a feeling that's born of\nan absence\nof a lack of something\nyou'll get that\nokay if this video resonated i'm not i'm\nsaying the feeling is probably what you\nhave okay i think you're plenty\nmasculine for the record\nsecond thing this is really important\nso\nthere's a group of uh women in our\ndiscord or women and non-binary people\nwho recently\nput together a document that was in\ndraft format i don't know if i was\nsupposed to read it or not but someone\nsent it to me i read it there was a lot\nof really great stuff in there so i'm\ngoing to comment on one thing because i\nthink it's a great point to remember\nso\nthis concept\nof what women want\nokay\nreading about what women are most\nattracted to it makes me wonder if i\nhave those traits\nso here's the thing that i want you all\nto think about\nwhat women want it's not like women are\nlike\none\ngroup of people with a uniform\npreference for what they want do you all\nget that like is that clear to people\nbecause oftentimes when we talk about\nthese kinds of issues and especially\nthere's people like in the mana sphere\nsort of talk about they're like women\nwant this women want this like women are\npeople they're just people\nand\nthey want different things\njust like you want different things\nlike not all men want the same thing\nnot all women want the same thing like\nhumans want\nindividual things they have individual\npreferences some women will like guys\nwith tattoos some women will never date\na dude with a tattoo does a tattoo make\nyou masculine people will disagree on\nthat these are all generalizations and\ntrying to live your life by a\ngeneralization is generally speaking a\nbad idea\nso like people want different stuff so\nyou're not screwed because news flash\npeople want different stuff some people\nlike and so it sounds like this person\nfor example\noverall my parents really cared a lot\nabout sharing my emotions which really\nhelped me a lot with some of my\ndepressed\nepisodes but i can't really see how\nthose traits are attractive at all to\nwomen\nso\nsome of the women that i've talked to\nwhen they're talking about what's the\nmost important thing in a partner\nthey've told me i want a man who's\nemotionally available heterosexual women\nthey happen to be\nand so what does that mean\nright so this person sounds like they\nwould be emotionally available because\nwhat they did get good role modeling on\nis how to be emotionally supportive to\nsomeone who's struggling so are there a\nlot of people that i know that would\nreally value this men or women both\nnon-binary too\nwhatever this is a valuable skill\nmy point is that like\nif you're trying to figure out you know\nhow to sort out your dating stuff and\nhow to figure out confidence and all\nthis kind of crap\nstart by like\nnot generalizing\nright because it's just i don't know how\ndo you make all women happy i have\nenough trouble making a single woman\nhappy\nand i understand all of her preferences\nand like that's a challenge\none that i appreciate on a daily basis\nright but like i don't know how you're\ngonna attract women like it\nthey're not like pokemon\nright it's not like oh this this pokemon\nlikes\noran berries\nand it's like yeah any pokemon you see\nin the world you can throw an\noranbearing they'll be attracted to it\nhuman beings are not like that\nyou get that like we get that because we\ndon't think that way oftentimes like in\nthese circles and in these communities\nand when our mind gets this way we sort\nof think in generalizations so step\nnumber one is stop generalizing because\nhuman beings have individual preferences\nand that's good because it gives you\nhope right because you're not screwed\nbecause what you're\nthe idea that you're screwed is based on\nthis generalization of like i'm not\nmasculine enough and women wants this\nthis and\nthis okay\nbecause once again go to the grocery\nstore and look who's got kids\na lot of the people who have kids are\nnot going to be the mark manson ideal i\ndon't even know what the mark manson\nideal is\nright all kinds of people have kids all\nkind of people are in relationships\nokay that's number one don't generalize\nokay\npoint number two to understand if you're\nin this situation you are not doomed by\nyour parents\nso a lot of times people who really\nstruggle\nto find relationships\ngrow up in situations where they don't\nhave proper role models\nor what they view as proper role models\nright case in point so we saw that in\nthis post where the person was like\nmy dad is everything that is the\nantithesis of what i consider to be a\nman\nand it's like wow dude that's rough\nokay\nsome issues there but let's just accept\nit at face value\nand just because your dad is a certain\nway doesn't mean you're gonna be that\nway\nso this is where like this is something\ni want y'all to understand if you were\ndealt a hand in life that gives you\npoor opportunities going forward\nlike if you if you don't have you know a\nlot of inborn\ngood role modeling and stuff like that\nthat just means that you need to be\npatient with yourself\nbecause what i see from this person is\nthat they think about it critically\nthey're reaching out from help they're\nreading atomic habits they're moving\nfrom one college to another they're\ntransferring schools so that they can\npractice their social skills all of\nthese kinds of things so so basically if\nyou think about your role models that's\nwhat you that's you were born with\nthat's your karma\nyou don't get to choose that it's your\nstarting zone it's your spawn point\nso if you get a good spawn point you can\nbuild up pretty quick so maybe by the\ntime you're 20 years old if you've got\nreally good role models and stuff like\nthat you had your first girlfriend when\nyou were 15\nsecond girlfriend when you were 17 and\nby 20 you're really comfortable with\nrelationships\nif you had the right starting point\nor you had a starting point like mine\nwhich is\nno girls no talking no parties no going\nto dances\nnone of that\nyou should do studies\nright if you're from like the south\nasian diaspora and you're a first\ngeneration immigrant in the us or uk or\nparts of europe canada whatever it's\nlike no dating no dating no dating why\naren't you married yet why don't you\nhave kids what the hell is wrong with\nyou\nit's like you turn 25 or you turn 26\nit's getting close beta why aren't you\nmarried\nso you got to be patient with yourself\nbecause here's the thing even if you\ndidn't have it when you spawned you can\nabsolutely get it right so if it's like\nif you're playing civilization and you\nspawn somewhere and there's no good\nplace to start a city you got to move\nuntil you find some flood plains you\nfeel me bro\nand so like here's the thing like\nsomeone else who spawned next to the\nfloodplains gets to start their city on\nturn one epic start i have to move\naround for 12 turns and i start my city\non turn 12.\nthat feels bad man\nyou'll get that\nso be patient with yourself just because\nyou weren't\ngifted\nthese kinds of advantages by your\nparents does not mean you're screwed\nforever it just means you can't follow\nthe timeline of someone who started this\ncity on turn one\nso you can't compare yourself to someone\nwho's like had three relationships by\nthe age of 20 because like you weren't\ngiven that opportunity so you're just\nstarting late it's okay it's not over\nforever in fact catching up is actually\nway easier than you think\nit's similar to this mechanic they have\nin sieve where if you're the first sieve\nthat researchers attack right all the\nsubsequent sieves have a bonus to\nresearch that tech it's kind of how it\nworks catching up is actually takes less\ntime than being at the front of the pack\nand if you're doing this stuff like\nreading books about it and thinking\nabout it and working on it and all that\nkind of stuff\nthen you'll you'll catch up real quick\ndon't worry but be patient with yourself\nokay if you think you're doomed because\nof your spawn point your parents be\npatient with yourself point number two\npoint number three\nthis is really important\nso when we start to\nobjectify the people that we date and we\nstart to think that they have\nuniform preferences\nright so if you're a woman and you're\nheterosexual and you're attracted to\nmen and you're like all men\nwant this\nand if you're a dude and you're\nattracted to women you're heterosexual\nyou're like all women want this and if\nyou're homosexual and you think the same\nthing all men or women want this like\nthat that's not true\nso then the problem is that we got to be\ncareful because then what a lot of what\nwe try to do is impress\nthe opposite sex right oh if all women\nwant this then i have to become this if\ni ever want to be in a relationship\nso you put on your chameleon skin and\nyou change color you try to impress\nwomen you try to become that which they\nwant\nand that's like it's kind of weird\nbecause you're almost assuming that\nthere's like a\nit's like logic where it's like if i do\na b and c\nthe women will come\nand there may be a certain truth to that\nlike i don't think so for the most part\nthere may be parts of that that have\nsome amount of scientific support right\nin terms of we're going to get to that\nin a second\nbut in essence what i would say is don't\ntry to impress\nothers\ntry to impress yourself\nsome people say work on yourself like\nthis is where like i don't think you\nshould go to the gym necessarily to make\nyourself attractive to more women i\nwould say like if i look at this\nsentence here's what i see\nit doesn't help that i've been either\nskinny or fat my entire life and it's so\nhard to gain muscle so i think the\nbiggest reason that you should go to the\ngym is because you're not okay with the\nway that you look\ndo you all get that like sure women may\nfind uh\nmay find men who are in shape more\nattractive like we can sort of do that\ni'm sure if we polled a bunch of women\nthere may be research on this so there\nmay be some amount of truth to that i'm\nnot disputing that but i'm saying that\nyou shouldn't do something to in order\nto make yourself attracted to more women\nyou should do something for yourself\ndoes that make sense like this is how\nyou develop confidence\nthis is important to understand\nbecause when i do something if i go to\nthe gym to impress a girl let's say\nand then she and then i i go to the gym\nfor a year\nand i get buff and then i ask her out\nand she says no what happens to my\nconfidence\nso i put all this investment for this\none particular outcome and once she says\nno what do i stop doing i stop going to\nthe gym\nand i lose confidence like what the hell\nman\ndo things that impress you if you are\nunsatisfied with the way that you look\ndo something about it\nif you are unsatisfied with your social\nskills do something about it\nif you are unsatisfied with your\nprofessional life do something about it\nif you are unsatisfied with your\nemotional well-being and your emotional\nstate and how sensitive you are and how\nmuch your emotions control your\nbehaviors and thoughts do something\nabout it but do it for yourself\nwill that generally speaking make you\nmore attractive to the people that you\nwant to date probably\nbut don't do it for them do it for you\nbecause this is really important to\nunderstand like\nthe value here and this is where like\nwhen i sort of think about where\nsuccessful relationships come from\ni think about people who sort of like\nare the best version of themselves\nand what you do is you put that on\ndisplay you don't try to get someone to\nlike you\nright so that also has a subtle point of\nlike removing their choice from the\nequation does that make sense like that\nperson gets to decide if they want to\ndate you or not it's not like you can do\na bunch of stuff and then they'll\nmagically like you'll be able to shape\ntheir thoughts like that's it's not what\nyou should try to do anyway\nlike you should be what you are and then\nput yourself on display\noffer whatever you can\nto other people\nand polish it by all means right so like\nif i'm selling apples like i'm gonna\nmake sure that i wipe down the apples\nand make them clean and i'll set them up\nnicely and stuff like that so by all\nmeans like advertise but be what you are\nright and focus on on first of all like\nimpressing yourself\nso if there's some kind of deficiency\nthat you've got that you're not happy\nwith\nyou should work on that 100\nand that's what it means to work on\nyourself\nright and this is not where like it's\nnot like working on yourself will\nmagically like make a woman appear and\nthen it's like boom girlfriend\nright\nworking on yourself is for yourself\nand then like as you become confident\nhopefully you'll end up being more\nattractive to women or you will allow\nyourself to be put on display instead of\nso stuck in your head or whatever and\nthen other people will be attracted to\nyou\nbut it's kind of weird because it's one\nof these things where it's like the\nthe goal that you're looking for is not\nthe goal that you should work for\nyou should kind of change your goal to\nbe really focused on yourself and that's\nwhy like if you're unhappy with yourself\ndo something about it for you\nand learn self-love\nand once you like understand self-love\nand like you know how to do it you can\nshow other people how to do it too\ndoes that make sense\npeople with me\nso don't try to impress other people\nlike try to impress yourself\nbe happy with the person that you are\nand work towards being happy with the\nperson that you are\nnext thing that we got to talk about\nis confidence\nso this is important to understand\nconfidence oftentimes people think that\nconfidence comes from success\nso if all you've had is success you\ndon't wind up with confidence which you\nwind up with is either ego or\nmore commonly imposter syndrome\nso i've seen this a lot confidence\nactually comes from surviving failure\nright so just think about that for a\nsecond\nbecause confidence is actually comes\nfrom adversity not from successes\nright so like does confidence come from\nan easy life like you can you can sort\nof get false confidence from an easy\nlife but real confidence real belief in\nyourself comes from surviving failure\nnot succeeding\nand it's as simple as this i don't know\nif you all have ever seen a kid learning\nhow to walk\nbut like\nyou know when a kid is learning how to\nwalk or learning how to swim so like\ni've seen this a lot in terms of you\nknow like teaching kids how to swim\nthey're terrified of water as they\nshould be that's like a biological fear\nbecause\nwater's a dangerous place human beings\nare not born with the natural ability to\nswim like many animals like a fish\nright fish aren't afraid of water\nso confidence comes from like you know\nbeing put in the water and then the kid\nis like ah\nand then they survive and they're like\noh actually this is pretty cool let's do\nit\nso in terms of dating and stuff like\nthat confidence in dating comes from\nactually surviving rejection\nright or like facing challenges dealing\nwith challenges it's not from like\nhaving a a\nyou know a problem-free relationship\nit's all from like being able to\nrecognize that if i have a problem in a\nrelationship\nconflict resolution once i become\nconfident in conflict conflict\nresolution then i will be confident in a\nrelationship\nright so this is where like from a\ngaming analogy wise like confidence is\nnot an invasion tank it's a healer\nwhich one's more reliable like i can\ninvasion a tank yeah i've got 90 evasion\nbut it's a one-hit ko\nlike that ain't how you get confident\nconfident is a bunch of armor and a\nhealer behind you is dedicated you're\ngonna hold aggro you're gonna take\ndamage but you know that healer is there\nso this is where like a lot of people\ndon't realize that\nwhen they feel like they don't have any\nconfidence it's actually being built\nwithin you\nthis is what confidence looks like\nwhy am i confident in myself because i\nfailed\none of the biggest lessons i learned\ni failed so much and for so many years\ngot rejected from medical school 120\ntimes\nfor one acceptance\nand then when i started i was like ain't\nno one gonna take this away\ni don't care surgeons can be to\nme\nnot a problem\ni have to survive this rotation for\nthree months\ni have to deal with this\nnarcissistic ass for three months\nand then i never have to talk to this\nperson again\nmeanwhile many of my colleagues\nwho were you know\nawesome people\nthey just never done they never really\nfailed right because most kids in med\nschool have never really failed\nthey're like 4.0s\nstraight a's\nall the time top of their class and then\nsuddenly this is one of the cruelest\nthings one of my friends went to harvard\nlaw school and i asked him how are you\nenjoying your you know how's your first\nyear and he's like it's kind of rough\nand i was like oh really i'm so\nsurprised like why is that he said one\nof the cruelest things you can do to\na group of people who have been the best\ntheir entire life is to suddenly make\nthem average\ni was like damn\nbrilliant guy\nso confidence comes from surviving fear\nthe last thing that we're going to talk\nabout\nis i would ask yourself a question\nand this is gonna\nrun to the crux\nof why this is so hard for people\nso i can say be confident work on\nyourself all this advice that people\nhave heard time and time and time again\nand some of you all do it you try it\nright you're like okay i'm a work on\nmyself i'm a focus on myself i'm gonna\nbe confident and you do it and you do it\nyou do it and it doesn't work and it\ndoesn't work and it doesn't work and it\ndoesn't work\nthen you're like i don't understand i'm\ndoing everything right and it's not\nworking\nand the more resentful you become the\nmore you go to like the darker sides of\nlike the internet and perceptions around\ngender dynamics and all that kind of\nstuff is the resentment built up is the\nfrustration built up you go into the\ndark side you become a sith\nyou leave the light behind\nto avoid that you need to do one thing\nand this is the hardest thing to do\nit's the thing that i've never heard\nanyone say\nso this is important you need to ask\nyourself one question if i improve\nin this dimension will i feel proud of\nmyself\ncan i take pride in the way that i move\nforward\nso i want to give you all an example you\nguys want to understand this we're going\nto show it to you real quick\ndo you think this person is proud of\nthemselves\nthis person has never talked to women\nthey're getting on dating acts they're\ntransferring schools they're reading\natomic habits they're reading this\ndoes this person have things to be proud\nof\ndo they feel proud of themselves of\ncourse not\ndo they have things to be proud of 100\npercent\nlook at this this\nthis is fantastic\nthey're making\ngeographical changes in their life\nto correct for a lack of experience they\nhad in the first 20 years of their life\ndo you think this person feels proud of\nthemselves of course not\nturns out the person is emotionally\navailable and knows how to support\npeople who are struggling like that's\ngood\nnever had athletic hobbies\ninterested in nerdy stuff are they proud\nof this no\nstudying computer engineering maybe\nthey're good at it maybe they really\nlike it\nmaybe they're going to be making plenty\nof money a few years from now\nso if you actually improved\ncould you be proud of yourself\nand if the answer that question is no\nthat's a huge problem\nbecause that that question being no is\nthe crux\nof why you can't be confident in\nyourself do you all understand that does\nthat make sense\nbecause even the progress that you make\nthe very things that are supposed to\nmake you confident don't make you\nconfident\nthat's devastating\nso as you go trying and trying and\ntrying because everyone's like oh my god\nlike do all this stuff you'll be\nconfident you'll be confident you'll be\nconfident and it never comes\nand now you feel more resentful because\nyou've made so many sacrifices i moved i\ndid this i did this i read this book i\ndid all these things i'm working so hard\nand none of it is working\nand that's because you're looking at the\noutside you're not looking at what in\nhere\nprevents you from being proud of\nyourself\nso ask yourself this question if i went\nto the gym for a week\ncould i be proud of myself\nbecause think about this right\nif you ask yourself your that question\nof course the answer is yes like of\ncourse you should be proud of yourself\nand then people go to the gym for a week\nand how do they feel about themselves\ntired ashamed\noh my god i'm so out of shape\nand now we see the crux of the problem\nwhich is the very medicine that you take\nmakes you nauseous and vomit\nand then what are you supposed to do\nyou have to be able to take pride in\nyour actions\nregardless of the result\nyou got to be able to say to yourself\nyou know what like even though i'm out\nof shape i went three days this week\nthat's something i can be proud of\nbecause here's the thing the success the\nconfidence use whatever generally\npositive word you want\nthat comes from doing the stuff\nbut as long as your mind isn't able to\nsee it like you're going to be screwed\nbecause the very thing that you need is\nmaking you nauseous\nthe medicine is the sickness\nand when medicine starts making you sick\nyou're screwed\nthat's where you've really got to tunnel\ndown and you've got to ask yourself why\nthe hell not\nwhat is it about me\nlike why can't i take pride in this\nyou've got to get to the bottom of that\nbecause what you're going to find is\nit's a feeling\nthat keeps you from doing it\nthere's a roadblock to you building\nconfidence\neveryone will give you myself included a\nthousand techniques to build confidence\nbut no one will ever say this is what\ngets in the way right even if you do all\nthe right things it's the internal work\nthat's the most important\nso you've got to ask yourself if i do\nthis thing will i be able to take pride\nin myself\nif the answer is why the hell not that's\nwhat you got to start with\nyou"
