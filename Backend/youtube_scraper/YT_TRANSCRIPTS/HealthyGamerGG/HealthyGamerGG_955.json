    "transcript": "if you\nfeel hunger then you're gonna go eat\nsomething but if you have no appetite\nthat you know\nyour body needs the food but you're not\nyou're not driven or motivated to do it\ndo you do you guys ever go through\nperiods of just feeling nothing\ni'm not talking about seasonal\ndepression or whatever at least then\nyou're feeling down and well depressed i\ndon't feel anything period\ni don't get angry when i feel like i\nshould be angry i don't feel\naccomplished when i feel like i've\naccomplished something i don't feel\npleasure nor sadness nor hate nor\nanything\nit's all emotions\nit's like all emotions have been drained\nfrom me\ni don't enjoy learning new things and\ni'm not as curious as i once was\ni don't feel anything when i solve an\nenigmatic puzzle i used to enjoy\nwatching anime but now it's more like i\ndon't mind i don't mind watching anime\ni feel like all of those things that\ndefine me early\nused\nto i feel no more than a shell i'm 18\nnow and i don't think i'm supposed to\nfeel like a shell right\ni visited our slash anhedonia and i\nrelated to most of the posts to a scary\ndegree\ni want to say i'm scared to be living\nlike this but i'm not actually scared i\ndon't feel scared\nit's just that i realize that this is\nnot how it ought to be\ni know that i don't want to be living\nlike this i feel like this has been\ndeveloping for the past year or so and i\ndid not and i did get depressed from\ntime to time time and at some points i\nwas even suicidal but the general\ndecline towards anhedonia was always in\nprogress\nmind you this is all self-diagnosed i\nnever asked for help\nif there is any hope i'm clinging to\nit's because i occasionally feel\nsomething but it's very faint what\nshould i do should i be concerned is\nthis temporary\nso\nlet's talk about this\nsometimes\nwe feel numb\nand the tricky thing about feeling numb\nwhen we stop enjoying things we don't\neven feel fear\nit's like you look at yourself and\nyou're like man\ni'm not really enjoying life this should\nbother me more than it is\ni should be concerned about this i\nshould feel fear\nyou even acknowledge that like you\nshould be experiencing more negative\nemotion\nbut like\nyou don't\nand so it sort of bothers you but you're\nnot worried about it right or you're\nworried about it but you don't feel\nworried about it it's like there's some\npart of you that's floating above which\nis like hey this is not right this is\nnot okay but the challenge is that\nnormally\nwhen things in our life are not\nokay\nthat negative emotion can actually be\nmotivation to go and fix it\nright where it's like if you feel hunger\nthen you're gonna go eat something but\nif you have no appetite that you know\nyour body needs the food but you're not\nyou're not driven or motivated to do it\nso sometimes we feel numb\nand then we talk about anhedonia so\nanhedonia is is a term that means the\ninability to experience pleasure\nanaedonia is oftentimes associated with\nclinical depression major depressive\ndisorder or depressive episodes bipolar\ndisorder\nand so the interesting thing is that we\nlike we may think okay so like if i'm\nend hedonic what a lot of people will\njump to is that means i'm depressed\ni need clinical treatment\nbut anhedonia is just a feature of\ndepression\njust like insomnia is a feature of\ndepression\nor weight changes are a feature of\ndepression\nit doesn't mean that all people who are\nant hedonic are depressed in the same\nway that everyone who has difficulty\nsleeping is not depressed\nso anhedonia describes our experience\nbut there's actually\nstudies on people who are an hedonic\nwho are not depressed\nfor whom anhedonia is the primary\nproblem\nand i'd love to share with you all some\nof the learnings of what those studies\nshow\nand like how we can understand the\nsituation okay\nso let's take a look at some\nneuroscience\nthis is some super cool translational\nresearch by the way\nso\nthis is\ngoing to be my attempt at explaining\nif you should feel worried about your\nlife but you don't even feel worried and\nyou have difficulty feeling anything at\nall what's going on\nso the first thing we're going to talk\nabout three parts of the brain\nventromedial prefrontal cortex part of\nour frontal lobe\nnucleus accumbens which is our dopamine\nreward circuit\nand then third thing is going to be our\namygdala\nand limbic system\nokay which is over here\nso this experiences negative emotion\nthis is essentially a controller\nso what does that mean so let's talk\nabout anxiety\nso when i feel anxiety\nokay so let's use\nthe color yellow so when i feel anxiety\nthis activates this part of my brain\nwhen i get my anxiety over under control\nwhen i overcome my anxiety\nmy ventromedial prefrontal cortex\ninhibits this basically overrides my\nemotion so anytime we control get\ncontrol of our emotions it's the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex\nthat controls it\nthe other thing that happens is as i get\nanxiety\nthis is going to go over here and\ncontrol my behaviors\nso the nucleus accumbens and the\ndopamine circuitry is what essentially\ngoverns behavior it says hey go do this\nthing because it is rewarding\nokay so it's like where motivation comes\nfrom\nso if you're numb\nwe're going to start with a clinical\nobservation\nwhich is that when you numb yourself you\ncan't selectively numb yourself it's\njust not how it works\nwe can't really selectively stop feeling\nnegative emotions and just feel all the\npositive emotions\nthere are sort of ways that we do that\nusually drugs of abuse are good examples\nof this that will just increase your\nyour sense of euphoria artificially\nright but generally speaking our natural\nintrinsic brain mechanisms cannot just\nnumb all the sadness\nand\njust make us feel happy why is that it's\nbecause the reason we've evolved to feel\nsadness is because it's actually like\nfor survival benefit so anxiety like\nhelps us survive sadness helps us\nsurvive fear helps us survive and so our\nbrain actually evolved to experience\nhappiness and sadness\nso what's going on in people who are\nnumb\nwhat's going on in essentially the\npathophysiology of people who are\ncompletely numb\nso there's some really interesting\nstudies that have been done first is\nthat this part so now let's talk about\nnumbness\nokay this part is altered\nthis part is altered\ngenerally speaking what we say is that\nwhen we want and this part is altered to\ngenerally speaking we want to strengthen\nour frontal lobes\nso that we can get control of our\nanxiety\nand then we can act independent of\nanxiety when you look at studies of\npeople who are anhedonic both with\ndepression and without depression\nwhat you find is alterations in this\ncircuit\nand essentially what we tend to see is\nover activity\nof the ventromedial prefrontal cortex\nwhen we meditate we strengthen the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex\nbut in people who are ant hedonic this\nis very very strong\nso isn't that a good thing because\nthat's the goal of meditation it's the\ngoal of meditation if you're anxious\nbecause in the case of someone whose\nanxiety controls their behavior their\nventromedial prefrontal cortex is weak\nin this case\nit's weak\nbut in people who are numb it's actually\nvery strong\nnow why is that or what what does that\nmean what that means is that it's\nsuppressing our emotions very very\npowerfully\nthere's also other things going on where\nin people who are anhedonic there's a\nreally interesting study\nabout the pleasure from sucrose\nso if i take\nif i take people\nand i give them an increasing sucrose\nconcentration\nso i tell them to drink something sweet\nwhat i tend to find is that let's say\nnormal people\nlet's say this is the\npleasure threshold\nso above this point\na normal person\nexperiences pleasure\nwhen someone is anhedonic\ntheir pleasure threshold is here\nbecause they literally need\nmore of the same stimulus to start to\nexperience the same amount of pleasure\nso to get one unit of pleasure\ni need a higher level of sucrose\nso what's going on there\nthat comes to the dopamine reward\ncircuitry this\nis lower\nso what's actually happening is our\nventromedial prefrontal cortex\ndirects our attention and so it almost\ncompensates\nfrom\na reward circuitry that's stunted\nby increasing its activity\ndoes that make sense because my ability\nto feel pleasure is is weakened so what\ni need to do is actually like ramp up\nthis so that i can try to boost this\nthe interesting thing is when i ramp\nthis up it also numbs me out\nso it's kind of weird that way\nmy ability to feel pleasure is\nnegatively impacted therefore my\ncortices try to compensate\nfor the other parts of my brain that's\nwhat the controller does it's always\ntrying to compensate always trying to\ncompensate\nand so as it ramps up its activity it\nsuppresses everything else\nso if you're an hedonic let me see if i\ncan actually find this paper\nyeah\nthis is fantastic paper\nneurobiological mechanisms of anhedonia\ntranslational research there's one thing\nthat i want to show you all in specific\na neural basis of positive emotion\nneuropharmacology of endodontic major\nyes\nneural basis of trait anhedonia in\nnon-depressed sub subjects oh you guys\ncan't see that there we go\nthis is the coolest part of this whole\npaper because it looks at anhedonia and\npeople who are not depressed\nand figures out what's going on\nso\nthe ventromedial prefrontal cortex for\nthe processing of positive emotion\nis pop is positively correlated\nokay\nso we won't go into too much detail in\nthe paper but\nso if you're numb\nis it normal\nno\nshould you be worried about it sure\nare you worried about it no because\nyou're numb\nwhat's going on\nit's actually\nan interesting circuit\nof under active\nreward circuitry\na compensatory change\nin your prefrontal cortex\nand when your pre-prefrontal cortex\ncortex gets activated\nit numbs your negative emotions as well\nbasically\noversimplifying because the brain is\ncomplicated there's no way you can\nreduce it this simply\nso the question is\nwhat do we do about it\nright\nso where does the problem originate\nchat\nwhat do y'all think\nhow do we reset some of this stuff\nyou need more anxiety that's possible\nit's funny so someone's meming right so\nwhat's the what what answers are y'all\ngoing to give me number one need more\nanxiety you think you're trolling but\nyou're not wrong\nah someone's talking about dopamine\ndetox\nokay\ny'all are y'all are actually precisely\ncorrect i can't even tell if people were\nbeing serious so they're mean meaning so\nthe first thing that you've got to do is\nreset this nucleus accumbens\nokay so what is the most common cause\nof underactivity of the nucleus\naccumbens is dopaminergic\noverstimulation\nso when i've worked with people who are\nanthodonic and we sort of know this\nright like\nif i play a video game for one hour it's\nfun\nthe 10th hour i play it is the game even\nfun\nam i actually like enjoying it no\nif i spend 60 hours a week playing a\nvideo game do i have more fun or less\nfun than if i play a game for six hours\na week\nso first thing you've got to do\nreset your dopamine\nso we've done videos we've had discord\nevents about dopamine detoxes\nwe've also debunked other dopamine\ndetoxes which are largely bs\nbut you've got to reset your dopamine so\nwhat i'd say is for two weeks\nyou know drastically decrease or cut out\nyoutube\nsocial media\ntwitch\ngaming\nbecause you've got to reset your nucleus\naccumbens\nonce your nucleus accumbens resets\nhopefully your ventromedial prefrontal\ncortex will start to\ncalm down\nas it'll calm down you'll start to feel\nnegative emotions\nso y'all aren't wrong the second thing\nyou need to do is become aware\nof negative emotions\nso if we paid attention to this person's\npost they were saying like you're not\ncompletely numb right you just feel a\nlot less than when you should\nthan what you should so when you feel\nsomething negative\ntry to understand what you're feeling\nreally try to increase your emotional\nawareness\nand what you'll tend to find\nis that\nwhen you become aware of your negative\nemotion even the smallest negative\nemotion what you're going to find is\nthat there's a response\nto the negative emotion\nand when you have this response to the\nnegative emotion there's going to be a\nreflexive\naction\nso when i'm feeling sad without even\nrealizing it i'm going to start browsing\nreddit\nand guess what this reflexive action\ndoes\nmesses up your dopamine\nso ironically feeling more anxious is\nactually the right answer\nso they're going to be small moments\nthroughout the day\nwhere you experience emotions\nobserve the emotion\nand most importantly\nacknowledge what it is and then don't\nstop\nthe reflexive action\nand as you stop the reflexive action the\nemotion will increase\nit'll feel a little bit uncomfortable\nbut since your nut brain is pretty good\nat numbing you know it's going to be a\nslow process of letting it out a little\nbit by a little bit by little bit\nand as you stop the reflexive action\nyou're gonna stop\nmessing with your dopamine and so we\nsort of see\nthat it'll sort of fix the problem the\nproblem with this is that as you fix the\nproblem what are you actually going to\nexperience\nyou're going to feel\nmore\nnegative\nemotion\nso be aware of that\nand as you feel more negative emotion\nthe good news\nis that you'll feel\nmore\npositive emotion\nand then you'll recalibrate\nso it's interesting because we see this\nkind of situation a lot nowadays\nwhere people are\nnumb\nand then they think about anhedonia\nthey're like oh man it sounds like i'm\nanthony\nso one thing that we should also say is\nthat if you are an endodontic this is\nnot a good idea\nyou should probably go see a provider\nand get evaluated because if you have a\nclinical illness that is causing the\nanhedonia because remember that\nneural pharmacology of anhedonia and\nmajor depressive disorder there are two\ndifferent things that could be going on\nyou could be depressed or you could not\nbe depressed\nthe pathway for each of those things is\ndifferent\nyou could definitely do this one as well\nif you're depressed but there's a whole\nother set of stuff that's going on in\nthe case of actual depression\nright and how we assess anadonia and how\nwe treat anahedonia\nso you should get a clinical evaluation\nbut then recognize this cycle\nthat the numbness is\nis through hyperactive activity of the\nventromedial prefrontal cortex\nwhich is to compensate for a hypoactive\nnucleus accumbens\nand then once your nucleus accumulates\nby the way is hypoactive you're going to\nlike have trouble with motivation as\nwell so you don't enjoy things as much\nand then you're you try to balance that\nnegativity by activating your prefrontal\ncortex the thing is when you activate\nthat prefrontal cortex it suppresses\nyour negative emotion as well and so you\nend up being completely numb\nand you can reverse that cycle\nthrough first of all dopamine detox goes\na long way\nbut secondly awareness of the negative\nemotion and not\ndistracting yourself or suppressing that\nnegative emotion through the reflexive\naction\nthe problem is that when you stop\nsuppressing it you're gonna start\nfeeling more\nand that's gonna be like too much to\nhandle\nso you gotta learn how to swim\nin more chaotic waters\nright you gotta get out of the kiddie\npool and like get into the big pool and\nthen eventually like get into a pond get\ninto a lake get into a river and get\ninto the the ocean\nthe ocean of emotion baby\nyou"
