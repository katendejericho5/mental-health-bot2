    "transcript": "i have thought about the achievement of\ngetting to high school getting to\ncollege going to everything and every\ntime i keep thinking the next one's\ngoing to be the one but it never is\ncan you tell me what you go by please\nuh yeah aspers asper\nwelcome asper how are you feeling today\num so i'm fine i'm a bit nervous but\nyeah\nuh so i guess i say when i come here\nlike how am i feeling yeah sure if\nyou're open to it so uh\nthis is actually really good timing\nbecause just really\nrecently i got a really important like\nlife goal in my life and\ni just noticed i'm not really feeling\ntoo excited about it i just kind of\nbored them more than any other thing\nokay so\nyeah that's that's a bit the thing of\nhow i'm feeling i'm just\na bit disappointed that this would be a\nhigh in my life and it's just nothing\nchanged really i see so so\nby got a life goal you mean you achieved\na life goal\nyeah yes sir so yeah i i\njust graduated from college okay and so\nyou climb to the top of the mountain the\nview isn't what you thought it would be\nyeah it's just i i don't know i you\nalways imagine it's going to be\nso intense so great and then you can\nhear itself okay i\ni'm still just here okay\nexactly the same as i was the day before\nokay\nso um first of all congratulations at\ngraduating from college\nokay thank you um\ni think it is an achievement but what\ni'm hearing is that it's not how are you\nexpecting to feel\ni don't know because\nyou always feel like\nlike we we work by\nlike uh you have\nyou start something\nand you say okay when i finish imagine\nwhen i finish primary school okay now\nthat's my goal finish primary school and\nthen when you finish your go to high\nschool okay let's finish high school and\nthen when you finish you go to college\nand now i finish college and now it's\nlike\nso now do i retire\nyeah it's\nit's just you don't look past that you\njust just work by frames and then\nsuddenly this train was ended and i\nthought this would be a high achievement\nand it's just i don't know\nlike life's going really smoothly but\nfeels so pointless\nyeah i think um\ncan i just repeat back kind of what i\nheard asper\nsure\nso we like focus on a goal right and the\nidea is that once we get to the end of\nthe road and we achieve that goal we\nwill be happy\nbecause you work really hard and you\nsacrifice to get to this goal\nand then you finish primary school and\nthen you finish high school and then you\nfinish college but like\neverything that you've worked for\ndoesn't just it doesn't like magically\nyou just don't feel like happy and\naccomplished all of a sudden even though\nyou've done exactly what you set out to\ndo\nand so now you're kind of like\nwhere is the achievement actually like\nwhere does it feel good how does it feel\ngood\nyeah it's like\nwe're just chasing constantly something\nand\ni don't even want it i just want to\nchange face it and i don't even know why\njust start to bother like\ndid you really want to chase that\ngood\ni know it sounds kind of weird asper but\ni i think that's a fantastic way to\nthink and feel\ndoes that sound thank you does that\nsound weird\ni mean i i i agree with you it makes\nsense in my head i just\ni'm not sure if it makes sense for the\nrest of people\nso i think this is where like what\nyou're doing asper is like uh you know i\nhaven't asked you how old you are and\nstuff like that but like i think this is\nwhat really growing up is about\nso we're told our entire life to do\nparticular things and we're told if you\ndo\nthese things then you will be happy\nbut somewhere along the way we have to\nsort of discover what happiness means\nfor us\nwhether following the script and there's\nstill good reasons to you know graduate\nfrom college\nwithout it sort of\nmaking us feel happy forever\nbut i think now is a really important\nbecause like i'm glad you're learning\nthis now actually because i've worked\nwith some people who are a little bit\ni'm assuming older than you are but\nmaybe you're older who knows\nbut there are a lot of people who will\nwe sort of call it a treadmill right or\nlike stair stepper where you're you keep\non achieving stuff and then it's what\nwhat's next\nit's like okay college now you have to\nget this job\nyou start out as an analyst then you get\npromoted to an associate then you get a\npro promoted to a senior associate\nthen you get promoted to a vice\npresident then you get promoted to\nsenior vice president and people are\nlike\nwhen does this get fun\nyeah exactly that's what i was thinking\nlike when when does the fun come like\njust\nwhen is it coming\nyeah so what do you think when do you\nthink it comes\ni don't know\njust i like one year before i thought\nthe fun would come when i graduated yes\nnow now i don't know it'll it'll come\nwhen you get the the do you have a job\nare you getting a job asper no i mean i\ni graduated like last week so i haven't\nhad time to even yeah so i'm sure it'll\ncome when you find the job right\ni don't know anymore\ngood\ni'm glad you're actually one step ahead\nof the game if you're not thinking okay\nlike it'll come when i have the job\nbecause then if you get the job you know\nwhat you'll say next\nit'll come when i get promoted\noh i was going to say it will come when\ni retire oh yeah and eventually\nit'll come when you retire yeah that's a\ngreat way to that's how you know so you\nlive your whole life so that you can\nhave fun for the last you know 20 years\nand and then you retire\nit is awful\nso here's the thing\nenjoyment is not about achievement which\nis really confusing for a lot of people\nyou know people say\nit's about the journey not the\ndestination have you heard that before\nyeah i have yeah and the thing is like\nwhat do you think about that\nso experience why it makes sense but i\nit doesn't make sense to me like then\nwhy do we chase achievement so much if\nit isn't even rewarding like i have\ni have thought about the achievement of\ngetting to high school getting to\ncollege going to everything and every\ntime i keep thinking the next one is\ngoing to be the one but it never is\nso why why do we do that that's a good\nquestion what do you think\nah\ni have no idea honestly oh\nso i think there are two or three big\nreasons\nthe first\nis that we look at people who have\nachieved\nwho appear to be happy\nand we\nwe can't duplicate internal work\nbut we can duplicate external work\ndoes that make sense\nyeah so like you see someone happy to\nsay i'm gonna do the same thing exactly\nso much so we as human beings what we\nwhat we notice what what like we can't\nmeasure what goes on in someone's mind\nbut we can measure\nwhat they do\nright\ncan you repeat the last part yeah so\nlike we can see what they do we can't\nsee what happens in their mind\noh yeah definitely so then so that's a\npiece of it\nso that's where like like i don't know\nif this makes sense but\nso you know when i was studying to\nbecome a monk\num\nwhat people noticed is that like monks\ndon't eat\nlike\nvery tasty food like they don't eat like\nunhealthy like they don't eat cakes and\ncookies and things like that right\nso what people assumed is they're like\nokay if i want to be spiritual i need to\nrestrict my eating\nand if i stop eating tasty food then i\nwill become more spiritual and i will\nlearn to control my desires and all that\nkind of stuff does that make sense\nyeah the problem is they're confusing\nwhat comes first it's not restricting\nfood that allows a monk to not eat\nto become like in control it's their\nability to like take a step back from\ndesires they conquer the desire first\nand then it makes no difference what\nthey eat does that make sense\nyeah so like\nokay i i think i i get it's like\nit's not that they\neat uh they eat healthy stuff to get in\ncontrol but\nit's just a\na consequence yes so once they become in\ncontrol through their meditative\npractice then like they don't care what\nthey eat\nright because they're no longer\ncontrolled by their desires\nthe problem is that what people see is\noh look that person is in control of\ntheir desires and they never eat pizza\ntherefore if i do what they do\ni will become in control of my desires\ndoes that make sense\nyeah so like\nif if you go to like i i may have seen\npeople that graduate are graduating like\nthey're working and they're happy and so\ni thought okay so they have graduated\nand are happy and so i will be happy if\ni graduate too exactly right so we we\nsometimes get confused\nbetween you know where does the\nhappiness come from does it come from\nthe achievement because the achievement\nis what we see\nwhat we don't see for example so we've\nhad a couple people who've called in\ntoday who have got done therapy for a\nyear or two or many\nso when we see someone who's like there\nare a couple people called in today who\nhad had their life together\nand when you see someone who has their\nlife together you see them going to work\nyou see them whistling and stuff like\nthat you're like i don't know how this\nperson happened you never see the two\nyears they spent in therapy\ndoes that make sense yeah\nyeah\nso why do we like focus on achievement\nbecause it's the only thing that's\neasily measurable you can't measure the\ninternal work that people do to find\nhappiness\nthat's the first reason\nreason number two\nis that there are advantages towards\nprioritizing this kind of stuff\nand we sort of know that like you know\nif you're like homeless and you have no\nmoney and have no relationships the\nchances that you're happy are\nlower\nright so there is some correlation\nscientifically with achievement and\nhappiness like at least you're not\nbeating yourself up for dropping out of\ncollege or failing out of college does\nthat make sense\nyeah i guess\nthat's me so there is some kind of\ncorrelation there but basically it's\nlike what we can measure\num and the third thing is that when we\nare unhappy the mind does something very\nvery subtle\nit looks at what we don't have\nand assumes that getting that thing will\nmake us happy\nright\nokay so so if i'm lonely i assume that a\nrelationship will make me happy\nif i haven't graduated from college\nwhat someone will do is they'll look at\nyou they'll look at aspirin they'll be\nlike i feel so bad about myself i failed\nout of college if i had graduated i\nwould have been happy today if i was in\na relationship i would be happy today if\ni was promoted i would be happy\nso they look at their own unhappiness\nand they assume that an external thing\nwill fix their happiness which is why we\nchase achievement\nokay so i i have one question right\nso\ni i think i get what you mean\nthe the thing now is then\nhow the hell am i supposed to be happy\nfantastic question\nlike i don't know my my whole life has\nalways been like the that those frames\nand so if this is not giving me\nhappiness then what am i going what am i\nsupposed to do beautiful okay so\nhave you ever been happy\num i\ni mean i guess\nwell it's\ni have had moments of happiness\nbut in the sense like being comfortable\nlike in long term\ni don't think so because there's always\nlike no i'm not ready yet\nnot ready for what\nto be happy\noh so i'm not\nsure i understood that what do you mean\nby not ready to be happy\nit feels like\nthere's this um feels like you haven't\ncompleted the game yet to like\nif the if the bounty is happiness you\nstill have to you still have a lot of\nlike quests yes yes\nso until you get those quests you can't\nreally be happy that's\nunfortunately that's how my brain looks\nat excellent and that's why you're not\nhappy\nright\ni guess\nbecause you're assuming that you have to\ndo all these things to be happy\nso now asper you're in a beautiful place\nokay so\nyou have to now learn\nwhat is happiness and where does it come\nfrom\nso let's\nthink about this like so\nthe first is you have this assumption\nthat it comes from achievement and so\nnow you're in the phase of your life\nwhere you have to like figure out where\nhappiness comes from and the interesting\nthing is that we actually have very\nclear answers about where happiness\ncomes from so\num but we just don't teach this stuff\nokay so let's try to teach you in a\nmoment the secret to happiness in life\nso there you said there are moments of\nyour life where you've been happy\nright but yeah\nyou're not happy like globally or\npermanently\nyeah i mean i i guess it's important to\nsay like when i say\nwhat what i think about happiness like\nhappiness and asking long term i feel\nlike\nbeing comfortable with both my situation\nand myself like yeah being happy about\nit like yeah this is good okay are you\ncomfortable with yourself in your\nsituation\ni feel like there's so much work to do i\nfeel like like i'm i just got out of\ncollege so now my brain is like no\nyou're not ready until you get like\nreally achieved professionally and like\nyou are able to have your own house for\nexample i don't know okay so i think\nthose are all good goals but i think\nwhat you should do is pay attention to\nyour happiness as you move towards them\nso do you feel more so like one step is\ncollege right\nso do you feel like happier now that\nyou're\ndone with college\ni mean a big weight has been off my\nshoulders\nbut overall the reaction my\nlike my brain has had has been\npretty underwhelming okay good\nso let's understand theories of\nhappiness so number one theory of\nhappiness is that happiness is like\nbuilding a house\nwhere i can put up the frame\ni can then put on the roof i can then\nadd the windows i can put in a door i\ncan put in the kitchen i can put in the\nplumbing the bathroom and all that kind\nof stuff but\nthe house isn't complete until\neverything is done\nso it's not like i even feel 10 when 10\nof that house is completed i don't feel\nlike i have 10 of a house does that make\nsense\nit's not a home until it's like once you\nhit 100 completion rate then you have a\nhome\nso happiness could be like that where\nyou can go to college you can get a job\nyou can buy a house and once everything\nis done then you will be happy at the\nend when you're 60 years old\nright you know i think that's definitely\nhow my mind sees that's how we sort of\nthink about it is the happiness the the\ncompletionist approach to happiness\nhappiness\nbut\nlet's think about the\nso you've never felt permanently happy\nright\nuh no definitely i don't think right and\nthat's where the the completionist\ntheory is it's like we say like okay\nonce everything is done then you'll be\npermanently happy right\nyeah okay do we know that permanent\nhappiness exists\ni don't know you know you do hear\nstories of people saying that yeah they\nachieved happiness\nyeah so they got the achievement called\nhappiness yeah and what do they say\nabout it have you ever talked to them\num\nwell not from the top of my head i don't\ni don't know if i can\nthink of someone that says that and i\nhave oh talk to them okay right so like\nthis is a great place to start is like\nhave you met someone who you feel is\npermanently happy\nno probably not okay so now this is kind\nof scary asper because we're chasing\nsomething that may not exist\nright and yeah\nif if if it does exist and we meet\npeople we could just ask them hey how\ndid you become happy and we just listen\nto what they say\nright but then they will say\nlike each one has to have their own home\nyou can just copy other person's home\nand assume that will give you hold on if\nyou don't do that you're coming up with\nanswers that are not based in reality\nyeah i mean this like what the mind\nwould say yeah so that's what your mind\nsays right because you're not\npermanently happy so the whole point is\nwe're not going to trust that organ\nbecause like if we meet someone who's\nsuper happy we can ask them and see what\nthey say\nso what does what do you know about\nhappiness\noh god what what i do know how i heard\nwell now i'm not so sure no you but\nthey're good so now we're going to start\nquestioning things but what do you know\nabout times in your life where you've\nbeen happy\nlike have you ever been happy for even a\nbrief period of time\nyeah i was yeah so tell me about it\nso\nthere's maybe a bit too specific and\nsilly but the recent one was i was uh\nplaying monster hunter with a friend and\njust there's a in the final boss there's\na moment where you like activate\nsomething called the dragonater and you\nattack the final boss and then this\nreally epic music kicks in\nand that that\ni was really happy at that moment i was\nfeeling it\ni think\nthat's the reason most happy\nokay this everything was so epic okay\nand and so\nlet's unpack that a little bit what do\nyou think it was that made that moment\nhappy\nah\ni\ni don't know it's everything was like so\nepic i was like having so much fun and i\nfelt really immersed in that at the\nmoment and i was\nwith a friend and we were both like yeah\nlet's go\num\nyeah it was\na little bit of everything i guess\nokay a little bit of everything meaning\nwhat were the components\num game epic music good friends\nuh winning i guess\nand just entering kind of that flow\nstate in the game ah\ninteresting\nokay so if you were to play monster\nhunter again with a friend\nand you were to beat the game again or\nfight the final boss would you be\nequally happy\ni\nwe we did repeat the final post\nyesterday and i got close to that point\nmaybe not the first because the first\ntime you're just like\nyou don't expect\nthat uh the music and everything was\njust the first time for everything but\nit did get close\nokay\nyou know\nthe game clicked and\nwe i felt really comfortable playing and\nlike the moves were\nsnapping into place i guess okay\nso\ni think there's a there's a lot of\nanswers here so first of all\nso you did it with a friend it was a\nparticular boss it was the end of the\ngame the music is the same both times\nright\nso like why aren't if all of the\ncircumstances are the same\nwhy isn't the happiness the same what's\ndifferent between time number one and\ntime number two\nuh the expectation i guess okay so\nthat's really important right so you\ncould say it's the novelty\nso one option is that in order to be\nhappy we have to keep on doing new stuff\nand so what that means is that i can\nnever eat at the same restaurant twice\nbecause that's going to reduce my\nhappiness i can never\nbe in the same relationship for longer\nthan six months because dating more\npeople means more happiness i can't play\nthe same video game over and over and\nover and over and over again i have to\nconstantly be playing new video games\nright\ndoes that\nwhat do you think about that no no no\nthere will be a complete train ring okay\nso it's not novelty and yet there's a\ndifference between time number one and\ntime number two and you come down to\nthis phrase expectation\nso yeah have you seen morbius\ni have not\nnor i have seen most of the memes i'm\nactually quite lost i don't really know\nwhy more views is all over the place\nright\nso like morbius is a great example\nof expectation\nso some people even they re-released the\nmovie because they were like oh this is\nsuch a meme everyone's everyone's so\nit's so funny people will enjoy the\nmovie because it's so bad\nbut it's like it's a classic example of\nlike just everything with expectation\ngoing wrong\nit's a crap movie it's a meme but no no\none's gonna enjoy it even if it's a meme\nso the first thing to understand about\nhappiness is expectation\nso if i\nso like getting a gift on your birthday\nthat you really really love is fantastic\ndo you think you would enjoy that gift\nmore or less if you got it on a day that\nwas not your birthday\nyeah i think i think i i'd get it like\nif i got it just some random day and i\ndidn't expect it i it would be\nlike\nit would be more of a surprise like a\npleasant surprise right so now let me\nask you a question so let's say i get a\nmediocre gift on a random day of the\nweek\nand i get a mediocre gift on my birthday\nwhich one am i going to enjoy more\ni should definitely they're going to\nenjoy more than mediocre like in a\nrandom day right because even if i get\nthe same damn gift on my birthday and\nit's mediocre what am i going to feel\ndisappointed\nwhat the it's the same day of a gift\nbut on one day it results in\ndisappointment and on another day it's a\npleasant surprise\nyeah that\nand so i see what you did and so here we\nare like we're looking at oh like look\nat that person has a new\napple watch\nthey must be so happy\nhas nothing to do with the apple watch\nthey could be happy\nbut it's all around the circumstances of\nour mind\nso you mentioned a couple of other\nthings so the first thing that i want\nyou to think about is expectation\nbecause what's different\ni didn't expect the music to be so epic\nby the way asper thanks for ruining the\nend of monster hunter for everyone\nbecause now we know it's going to be an\nepic experience and none of us are going\nto enjoy it quite as much\noh i'm so sorry you know what i'm saying\nthough but i'm joking but i didn't say\nwhat monster yeah sure\nbut now we know that there's epic music\nright so the moment that we start to\nexpect something\nour happiness is going to decline\nyeah\nsecond thing is you said you were\nimmersed in monster hunter\nyou're feeling it right you are\ncompletely there in the present moment\nyeah\nso this is where there's a very old very\nsimple principle\nyou can't be anxious in the present and\nyou can't have regret in the present\nanxiety is in the future and regret is\nin the past\nso can you repeat that yeah so anxiety\nis in the future and regret is in the\npast\nokay so when my mind is making a mistake\ni'm totally fine\nregret happens afterward\nwhen i'm about to make a mistake and\nafter i've made a mistake my mind can be\ndisturbed but when i'm immersed in the\npresent is when i'm having a really good\ntime\ndoes that make sense\nthat's kind of mind-blowing\nit feels right yep right so now you have\nto experiment with this stuff\nso this is why people love the flow set\nbecause even if you're thinking about\nwork people say okay work isn't fun\nbut i've had times of my life like this\nis actually close to one of them where\ni'm having a blast i'm working right now\nright it's all about being present\nand free of expectation\nif you do two things you will be happy\nit's simple\ni\nthis is already helping because i\nalready catch my soul thinking like yeah\ni should be a streamer okay\nso it was like so you're happy working\nand you're a streamer i should be a\nstreamer too therefore i be happy i\ncatch myself thinking yeah got to be\nvery dangerous i'm not i don't even\nthink i i don't think this i'm just\ntalking to someone i just happen to be\nstreaming i don't think of myself as a\nstreamer i'm\nyou know but what did you mean you're\nthe best well i appreciate that but i\nyou know\nso so this is why\nthis is the other thing asper that i'll\ntell you is that\nthere's also this idea that\nthere is um\nthat happiness is like a permanent state\nthat you can achieve\nand the more that we sort of try to like\nmake a life that will automatically give\nus happiness\nis when we really shoot ourselves in the\nfoot\nyeah because the truth of the matter is\nthat happiness is about the present\nmoment and you can't be happy forever\nand it's that thought that everyone's\nlike i want to make happiness like\nguaranteed it's the guarantee of\nhappiness that prevents us from ever\nbeing happy\ndoes that make sense\nwhat once you start to realize that\nhappiness is only temporary that's the\nmost it ever gets it transforms the way\nthat you live your life\nbecause then it's more like leaving the\nmoment exactly and then you also\nappreciate because you recognize that\nthe joy that i feel in this moment there\nis no way to make it last forever\nthis is only going to last for this\nmoment in time so man i'm gonna enjoy\nevery second of it\nthe music is epic i have the dragonater\nmy friend is here this is a once in a\nlifetime opportunity that i will never\nbe able to get back and then you start\nto live your life with intensity and\npassion that is completely foreign to\neveryone who's looking for a promotion\nthe really bizarre thing\nis that when you start living your life\nthis way you start getting promoted\nbecause you're doing your work with\npassion and intensity and your boss sees\nit and you're like wow this person is\namazing and then they promote you and\neveryone sees you they're like this\nperson is promoted\nand\nthey're\nloving life therefore i should get\npromoted too and what they don't realize\nis what's on the inside\ni mean it makes a lot of sense it's just\ni i'm\nit's it makes too much sense so i'm a\nbit like stunned\nthese are stun like me dr k okay well\nthankfully there's no there's no ko\ncoming it's just the stun lock and i'm\ngoing to wait until the stun goes off\nand they were\nright oh no that that was great\nso asper i want you to start\nstudying yourself look for happiness\ntoday alone\nnow this doesn't mean that you should\nlive a life of hedonism because even if\nyou try that you'll discover that that's\nnot the case because we've already\nfigured out oh i playing monster hunter\nall day long is not going to make you\nhappy\nright you've already like you just\nthat's it there's just one chance and\nyou can go chasing games time and time\nand time it's not going to work\nwhat you'll actually discover is other\nthings will kind of make you happy what\nyou'll really discover is it's not\nhappiness is not in the object itself\nfundamentally but it's in here\nand it's in your presence in your\nexpectation\nand once you realize that happiness is\ntemporary then you'll start to really\nlike love life\ngreat\nawesome\nokay\ngood luck to you\nthanks a lot dr k you're very welcome\nthat was like i expected it to be useful\nbut not so much\nlike\ndamn okay okay well that was good we'll\nonly disappoint you next time\nwell\nmaybe\nmaybe like the second time we beat the\nmonster\nit's still it's still going to be good\nokay well i'm glad it was useful to you\nask but it was an absolute pleasure for\nme\nyeah i'm glad and hopefully\npeople can relate to this oh i think\neveryone's relating to it it's a really\ncommon problem where we're taught to\nchase happiness\nwithout even being taught what it is\nit's also like\nsometimes just uh i want to say like\nsometimes get hard like because you see\nin the community\nall of these people that have all these\nproblems and things\nand then you're always like so where's\nthe space for people who actually have\nit okay like i'm my life's going\nperfectly fine and still\nso i don't know it's\nit's kind of weird but it feels good to\nhear that\ni still have problems that can be solved\nyou know like yum this is the peak of\nlife my life is perfect no it's not ask\nfor\nyou're just getting started\nsorry yeah i i tend to do that i'm sorry\nthat's great no i love it it makes me\nhappy to hear i'm very excited for the\njourney that you're just beginning to\nwalk\nand and i i'm very i think you're quite\nblessed to discover this confusion at\nsuch an early age\nbecause what people will do is they'll\nlive their whole life assuming\nthat next year they'll be happy\nand their entire life will pass them by\nhopefully that's not me i don't think it\nis\nand and i i also wanna really appreciate\nwhat you said that sometimes you know\nthis community becomes\nthe most prominent voices are the ones\nthat are suffering and we're here to\nhelp those people too for sure\nbut i i think that like part of what\nthis community is is it's like more than\njust\nyou know those people those people\nabsolutely belong here\nbut everyone is allowed no matter\nwhether you're advanced in life or not\nadvanced in life or however you
