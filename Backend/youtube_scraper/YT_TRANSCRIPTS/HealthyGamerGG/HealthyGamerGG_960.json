    "transcript": "so\nif you're 18 and you're concerned if\nyou're 21 or you're 25\nand you're concerned that this is gonna\nhappen for the rest of your life like\nhonestly you've got no clue like i've\ngot no clue no one's no one can see the\nfuture\nwhy is it normal and expected to waste\nmost of your life away doing a crappy\njob\ni'm 18 taking a gap year\nand will go to college in the fall and\ni've been working at a store for almost\na year now and every time i'm reminded\ni'll be doing this for the majority of\nthe rest of my life i break down and\nstart crying is there any way around\nthis eternal suffering at all besides\nbeing a neat and leeching off people for\nthe rest of my life\nso this post is short\nit's not a long and drawn out\nexploration of thoughts and feelings and\nwhatever\nwhat this post is about is like if\nyou're 18 years old\nand you've got a crappy job\nthis sucks\nthat's the essence of it\nright like somewhere along the way\nlike this is what we started to expect\nfrom people\nis that you're 18\nyou're kind of bored you're taking a gap\nyear because you need some money\nand this is what you have to look\nforward to\nright and then you're sort of like\nsitting at this this dead end job where\ndue to like inflation and all kinds of\nother problems like it doesn't even make\nyou the money that you need to make\nbut you sort of need to do it right like\nbecause the alternative is being in need\nand leeching off of society you want to\ncontribute you want to do a good job\nbut this is sort of what you have to\nlook forward to\nand we see this like all over the place\nright so this is a post that's in our\nsubreddit but there's you know for a\nlittle while before this whole you know\nanti-work\nmod fiasco\nand and going on like fox news and stuff\nlike like this sentiment is growing\nlarger and larger and larger\nand what we're noticing is that there's\nthere's a\ngrowing sentiment of being young\nfeeling like you're in a dead end\nsituation potentially being in a dead\nend situation\nand\nyou've kind of got\nnowhere to go\nand there's despair and the thing is\nthis is not just unique to one person\nthis is like\neverywhere you look we're seeing stories\nlike this where young people are\nstruggling to try to figure out like\nwhat's the point of this crap\nand so this question the question is\nactually like why is it normal and\nexpected to do that so we're actually\ngoing to answer that in a minute\nbut i want to start with like what's so\nchallenging about this situation is that\nso there's this perception\nthat young people are lazy\nthe thing is\ni mean maybe we're lazy but i don't\nthink we're any lazier than any person\nthat's come before us i think most of\nhuman laziness is like baked into the\nway that we work\nthe challenge right now is that i\nmost of the people i've met and most of\nthe people that i worked with are\nactually like okay working hard\nthey just want to work hard for\nsomething\nthat's what's missing\nit's one thing to like want to work hard\nor not want to work hard it's another\nthing to work hard for no reason\nor work hard for like way too small of a\nreason\nso it's one thing to like slave away for\neight hours a day\nto support yourself and your family it's\nanother thing to slave away for eight\nhours a day and not even be able to\nsupport yourself or support family or\neven get a financially like financial\nleg up that's the crux of the problem\nso it's not actually that people are\nlazy i mean they are but not really\nhonestly i don't i don't believe that\nabout people i think what\ndisincentivizes people from working is\nthat\nwhat you put in and what you get out\ndoesn't match\nso\nthis is tricky right so like you're\nfaced with a situation you're 18 years\nold you're like trying to figure out\nokay like what should i do with my life\nwell i got to get a job because i don't\nwant to be\nyou know i don't want to be a leech\ni'm willing to work i'm willing to\nsacrifice\nbut then you find yourself in this\nsituation where\nthe sacrifice you make is not\ncommensurate with what you get in return\nand so this leads to despair and it's\nhappening like all throughout our\nsociety\nso let's try to understand like\nif you're in this situation first of all\nwhat's going on\nhow we got here because i do think\nthat's important to understand and what\nyou can do about it because the key\nthing about this is there are some\nthings about this that are actually\noutside of your control which it's\nreally important to understand what\nthose are because a lot of the\nfrustration that we get at comes from\nrailing against a system that does not\ngive a crap\nand that just\nit exhausts all of our energy leads us\nto despair\nand then like\nyou know we run out of energy and then\nwe can't even do the things that we can\ncontrol which is what's really important\nto understand is that there are some\nthings you can do about this\nthe problem is that the more that we\nsort of focus on the system there are\nmaybe even some things you can do there\nbut like we have to really be careful\nabout how we devote our energy because\nwhat i've seen and what i'm actually\npretty hopeful for is like i've wrote a\nlot of people who are doomers and stuff\nlike that but the good news is that a\nlot of them get their crap together it's\njust no one sort of teaches us how\nbecause the biggest thing that's changed\nis that the default plan like doesn't\nwork anymore right you can't just like\npeople will say this is how you become\nhappy and successful and whatever and\nlike that just doesn't work\nand we're sort of seeing that here which\nis\nworking to save up money so that you can\ngo to college like that used to work\nbecause the ratio of how much college\ncosts\nhow much living in college costs to how\nmuch money you can actually make if you\ndevote a year of your life\nto working like that worked\nthis is exactly what i'm saying is that\nlike that sacrifice sacrificing your\nyear a year of your life at a dead end\njob doesn't actually make a significant\nimpact\nin going to college or at least not the\nway that it used to\nokay\nso let's try to understand like so let's\nlook at this question actually quite\nprecisely first\nand it's why is it normal and expected\nto waste most of your life away doing a\ncrappy job\nso let's talk about that\nso\nwhen my grandmother was born so we're\ntalking like she's like in her 90s now\nso she was born around like 19\n30ish or so okay\nand when she was born the infant\nmortality rate in india was probably\naround 20\nso they had problems like drought they\nhad problems like you know medicine\nwasn't available\num i still remember visiting my\nancestral village in india\nbefore when in my lifetime it did not\nhave electricity or running water\nactually i think they had running water\nthey didn't have electricity i remember\nit was a huge deal when electricity came\nto the house and there was one dude who\ngot a television\nand what he would do every night is\ncharge entry into his living room for\npeople to watch television so he had\nthis whole like thing going where it's\nlike you know it's like one rupee to\ncome in and watch the tv and you can\nstay as long as you want to like\nin the evening people would come in like\n30 people would be in his living room\nlike watching tv\nokay so this is like this is in my\nlifetime\nokay\ni'm gonna turn 40 this year\nso\nthis is like in my lifetime\nin parts of the world\nthis is what life was like\nso where does the expectation that you\nhave to work\nand slave away stuff that you don't want\nto do come from it comes from the fact\nthat that's what was required to survive\nso for the majority of human history\nhuman beings had to work to survive\nright so we had to like originally we're\nlike hunter gatherers right so it's like\nlike you know animals for example like\nthey have to well unless they're pets\nbut generally speaking or like raised\nlivestock or whatever but like if you're\na wild animal like you got to work every\nday because if you don't work every day\nyou don't eat and human beings were\nbasically an extension of that right so\nif we've got like an early on village so\neveryone in my ancestral village were\nfarmers because that's just that was the\noption and you had to go to the fields\nevery day because you had to like make\nget food you had to grow food you had to\nsell some of that stuff so that you\ncould pay for things like clothing\nand so like they were like peanut\nfarmers and stuff like that and they'd\ngrow this crop and that crop and\nwhatever and they'd like sell it so like\nwhere does the expectation that you\ndon't get to have fun in life and you\nhave to do crap that you don't want to\ndo come from it comes from the need to\nsurvival\nfor survival\nthat's where it comes from so where did\nwe expect this because that's what\nsociety was like like even within 100\nyears\nwhere everyone sort of had to do their\npart otherwise like society kind of\ndoesn't work and of course there have\nalways been people who are like not a\nproductive member of society you've got\nhomeless people you've got alcoholics\nyou've got people who are physically ill\nmentally or whatever and like we didn't\nhave treatment for those kinds of people\nalways so there were there's always been\nunproductive members of society but for\nthe most part where does the expectation\nthat your enjoyment is not important\ncome from it comes from honestly the\nneed for survival\nand there's even some really interesting\ndata that if you look at like what\nwhat has impacted life expectancy of\nhuman beings the most in the last like\n300 years it's actually the availability\nof food\nso what is you know\n500 years ago i think the life\nexpectancy was maybe like in the 50s or\nsomething like that maybe even lower\nand so why are people living to like 60\nand 70 routinely it's because we have\nenough to eat\nso society is changing a little bit and\nthe but and what's happening though is\nthat\nthe expectations that we have are not\nmirroring the world that we live in\ntoday\nso where does the expectation that your\nenjoyment is not actually like that\nimportant it that expectation comes in\nmy opinion from survival because human\nbeings had to do crap they didn't want\nto do like you had to wake up at 4am\nevery day to go out to the fields to\nfarm because if you didn't do that like\nyou didn't have food\nso you had to do that so i don't i don't\ncare about how you feel about it it's\nlike necessary for survival\nso then what happened is for thousands\nof years we had this like structure in\nhuman society\nwhich is that you have to do work to\nsurvive because life is about surviving\nthat was the primary goal that was not\nguaranteed that was not assured that was\nnot likely necessarily\nand so where is the expectation comes\nfrom it comes from that like in a\nnutshell\nright because you had to work to survive\nso now what's happened is we don't\nreally have to work to survive like so\nsurvival is like\nnot guaranteed i mean obviously death is\nguaranteed but\nyou know it's like like a lot of our\nsurvival is sort of like secured so\ngenerally speaking you know more people\ndie of obesity than hunger\nright more people die of like heart\ndisease and diabetes and things like\nthat then they die of hunger i think\nyou know i don't actually have\nstatistics on that but i'm pretty sure\nso if you look at most of the burden of\ndisease right now so you look at things\nlike cardiovascular disease you look at\nthings like colon cancer you look at\nlike these things like\ntype 2 diabetes obesity at least in the\nus like 30 of the us is i think obese\nand all the health effects from that\nit's like we have diseases of plenty now\nas opposed to before when life\nexpectancy was lowered by like\nmalnourishment and stuff like that in\ndeveloping countries and things like\nthat the the situation is reversed i\nthink they you know there are definitely\nparts of the world where poverty and a\nlack of nourishment is a primary factor\nin terms of life expectancy but for the\ndeveloped world that's not really the\ncase\nthe problem is that the systems that we\nhave have not really kept up with that\nso there's this assumption\nthat\nworking\nfor the purpose of survival sort of\nmeans that like you don't get to\ncomplain like you just have to be a\nproductive member of society the thing\nis that's just not true anymore\nright so if we look at like what's\nhappened\neconomies of scale things like\ntechnological advancements things like\nhydroponic farming and like you know\nagriculture has changed drastically you\nused to have a bunch of people in order\nto like create a bunch of food now you\njust need like one person or even like\ndrones or machines can automate it\nyou've got a hydroponic bay i remember\nreading a couple years ago there's this\nplace in japan that\ngrew a bunch of lettuce per like square\nfoot and so they've got you know verdict\nthey're using the vertical dimension to\nfarm\nso it's not just like growing lettuce in\nthe ground it's like we've got one layer\nof lettuce here we've got one layer of\nlettuce here we've got one layer we've\ngot like eight layers of lettuce that go\n12 feet up in the air so you're\nbasically like using you're\nexponentially increasing the amount of\nfood you can grow\nand so what's a consequence of this we\nalso see this like in the entertainment\nindustry so why is the entertainment\nindustry growing so rapidly like why are\nlike think about the number of video\ngames that are around today\nthink about the number of tv shows that\nare around today and like how many tv\nshows were being made every year 40\nyears ago\nit's probably like one to ten percent of\nwhat we're seeing now\nand why is that it's because we don't\nneed humans to do the work anymore\nright so like as human beings\nlike don't need to do the work like they\nwant more entertainment\nbecause a lot of stuff is automated now\nright if we have like self-driving cars\nwe've got like alarm clocks we've got\nall kinds of like different devices we\nhave dishwashers we have laundry\nmachines these are the things that human\nbeings had to do\nbefore\nand now it's like we don't got we have\nrunning water we have electricity we can\nstay up all night like we no longer need\nto like chop down firewood for for light\nand heat right the power comes right to\nmy house like that's pretty cool\nso the labor requirements of human\nbeings have decreased and what we've\nessentially done is moved upward in\nmaslow's hierarchy of needs\nand now we're at the part where like you\nknow for most of us thankfully\nsurvival is like not that big of a deal\nmost of us aren't going hungry\nthankfully\nand so as we do this like but the\nsystems that are designed are not\ndesigned for\nhappiness they're designed under the\nassumption\nthat you have to do crappy work in order\nto like make society function\nbut we don't need to do crappy working i\nmean some of us do i suppose but\nyou know and it's really interesting\nbecause this is something that's like\nwe're sort of seeing this trend so i was\nlooking at i just want to show you all\nsomething real quick\nso deloitte did a survey\non gen z and millennials and what we\nsort of found there are a couple of\nreally interesting findings from this\nsurvey\none like i want you to look at this so\nnearly two in five 37 percent of gen\nzers and 36 of millennials say they\nrejected a job and or assignment based\non their personal ethics\noh i guess you guys can't hold on let me\nmove this up a little bit\nso y'all can see that this over here\nnearly half of gen z and millennials in\nsenior positions have rejected a job or\nassignment based on their personal\nethics\nso what i hear in this\nthis post is that this is a dead end job\ni don't enjoy it and my suffering is\neternal and it turns out that this is\nnot just this person this is this is a\ngenerational impact that we see\nand like this is crazy like the idea of\nrejecting a job based on personal ethics\nin my grandmother's day was\nabsurd\nyou can't you can't stop being a farmer\nbased on personal ethics because your\nfamily needs the food\nand so as we move upward towards\nmaslow's hierarchy of needs suddenly\nlike personal fulfillment becomes more\nimportant to us as a whole generation\nbecause the truth is that\nyou know we don't need to work as much\nas we used to as human beings like the\nhuman race does not need to work as much\nas it used to\nnow if we did work i think that's\ngenerally speaking good so we can like\nadvance the human race better the more\nof us that kind of put in the time but\nwe don't necessarily have to do it in a\ndead-end job i think this is something\nthat's really unfortunate but it's true\nthat\nsociety has not\nthe this\nand structures of society have not\nactually kept up with the evolving needs\nof society\nwe're seeing hopefully change in that\nnow\nbut the end of the day like what\nwhat does this have to do\nwith you right so if you're faced in\nthis situation\nand you're listening this i'm imagining\nyour response is well that sucks so what\ndo i do about it gg\ni guess society has to change and yeah\nit does have to change the truth of the\nmatter is that there's a lot you can do\nabout it and we're going to start by\nactually taking a closer look at the\npost\nso i want to zero in on this\nis there any way around this eternal\nsuffering at all besides being in need\nand leeching off of people off people\nthe rest of my life so what do you all\nnotice about this statement what do you\nthink is going on in this person's head\nuh someone's saying take two jobs\nso this is interesting before we go\nfurther\ni want to show you all something\num\nso\nthis is some stuff about the great\nresignation\num yeah perhaps as a way to alleviate\nfinancial occurrence many are taking on\nside jobs\n43 of gen zeros have taken on either a\npart-time or full-time paying job in\naddition to their primary job that is\nshocking\nthat's what sorry this that's what this\nsays down here right so this is already\nhappening i think that this actually\njen's ears or\ni don't know exactly what the statistics\nare for like boomers and stuff like that\nbut i'm pretty sure that like close to\n50 percent of people did not have side\njobs\nright this is a huge systemic problem\ni don't think you can blame this on the\nmillennials\nbut what i want to focus on here for a\nsecond is what do you all notice about\nthis statement\nuh yeah here's this here's a link\nposting it now\noh i can't post\nuh it it's deloitte's\n2022 gen z millennial survey\nso let's let's focus on on what we're\ngoing to do about it so what do you all\nnotice about this\ndualism perfect\nso this statement is black and white\nthinking\nokay\nso the truth of the matter is that the\nworld is not black and white the truth\nof the matter is you don't have a choice\nbetween eternal suffering\nand being in need the truth of the\nmatter is there's a lot of stuff in\nbetween there\nso as we look at this problem there is\nan external component and an internal\ncomponent the external component we've\nalready touched on right the truth of\nthe matter is that society has changed\njen's ears are getting crushed\nright so that may sound pretty bad we\ncan't really fix that we can try to fix\nit maybe there are people who are fixing\nit like whatever but at the end of the\nday there are things that you can do\nso the first thing that you've got to be\ncareful of is your information diet\nso this is where\nwhen i when something is happening to me\nand i turn to the internet and i see\nthat it's happening to everyone else\ni conclude that they're like there's\njust despair right because i have a\ncognitive impression i'm feeling a\nparticular way i go to the internet and\nwhat does the internet do the internet\namplifies feelings and what it amplifies\nthe most are negative feelings\nso let me just like we know this right\nso there's been studies starting with\nfacebook looking at social media and\ny'all you yourself think about this so\nthink about if you spend 10 hours a day\nbrowsing the internet\nwhat does that do to the quality of your\nlife do you feel invigorated passionate\nexcited hopeful about life of course not\nso let's think about why this is\nso if i make a post on the internet\nabout hey i'm so grateful i have an\nawesome job i love it so much what do\nyou think happens to that post\npeople upvote it some people like it and\nsome people dislike it\nthe more time you spend on the internet\nthe more ti more likely you are to\ndownvote that kind of post because\nyou're resentful\nright\nso what happens is we're like creating\nthis echo chamber and if i make a post\nthat people can empathize with\nif i say i'm getting crushed at work i'm\ngoing to get way more upvotes than\ndownvotes i'm going to get way more\nlikes than than\ndislikes\nthat's actually what's going to happen\nbecause the truth of the matter is the\npeople who are\nmore happy in their jobs probably spend\nless time on the internet and the reason\nthey do that is because they're like\nmore busy with their job does that make\nsense\nas toys r us kid says misery loves\ncompany absolutely and that's what the\ninternet has become so i'm not saying\nthat the internet is bad i'm saying you\nshould be aware of what impact the\ninternet has on your mind because when\nyou sort of look at this the natural\nlike what floats to the top in terms of\nthe internet it's stories of doom and\ndespair for the most part\nso i'm not saying that you should stay\ncompletely off of the internet i just\nwant you all to pay attention to how\nmuch time you read\nstories of doomed doom and despair and\nwhat does that do for you\ni'm not saying that you shouldn't be\naware i'm not saying you should cut it\nout entirely i do think that there's a\nlot to be gained from sort of like\nunderstanding how other people are\nstruggling and things like that but i\nthink that watching that stuff time and\ntime and time again is just going to\nreinforce perceptions and there's a bias\non the internet towards negativity and\nthe more that you open up yourself to\nthat bias the more\nstressed out you're gonna feel and then\nwhat we see is that stress is going to\nlead to black and white thinking we sort\nof see this right so because the truth\nof the matter is like i don't know if\nit's common sense but there's a lot\nthere are way more options than this\nis there any way around this eternal\nsuffering at all besides being in need\nand leeching off people a hundred\npercent there are a thousand different\noptions\nbut if you spend time on the internet\nit's not your fault it's not like this\nperson is stupid quite the opposite i\nthink this person is asking an\ninsightful question and trying to you\nknow understand themselves but the truth\nof the matter is there's a ton of stuff\nthat you can do but all of the nuance is\nnot represented on the internet that's\nthe big problem\nis if i go to twitter all i'm gonna see\nis like black and white thinking twitter\nis a platform that restricts\nby virtue of its nature\nrestricts nuanced thinking\nright there's a character limit you can\njust go one way or the other way\nand what's going to happen is like as\nyou go one way it's going to be a\nvisceral response people will\nemotionally connect to they'll share the\ntweet they'll like the tweet whatever\ngets floated to the top\nso this is why if you look at like\ntwitter it's so polarized there's no\nthere's no discussion you can't have a\ndiscussion\nit's just people yelling at each other\nand no one's paying attention the more\nyou participate than that the more that\nyour mind is going to see this and the\nmore that your mind is going to come to\nthis conclusion\nand further more the more that you read\nthis stuff as you get emotionally\nactivated as your amygdala gets\nhyperactive\nright when you read this stuff because\nyou're getting emotionally engaged as\nyour stress level rises as you're like\noh my god the world is ending what am i\ngoing to do your cortisol level\nincreases\nas your cortisol level increases day\nafter day after day after day and\nremember that cortisol was not designed\nto be chronically elevated\ncortisol was designed in our by\nevolution\ndesigned evolved\nthe purpose of cortisol is to keep us\nalive for the 24 hours after a period of\ndanger and then the cortisol level is\nsupposed to go down and we're supposed\nto be fine so like the way that the\ncortisol system developed was sort of\nlike to account for\nlong-term post-acute danger\nnow what happens is paying rent at the\nend of the month is a constant danger so\nyour cortisol level is elevated for 30\ndays 60 days 90 days 100 days and what\ndoes cortisol do to your brain\ndoes all kinds of crap like interferes\nwith your sleep and things like that\nlowers your mood increases inflammation\nbut also encourages black and white\nthinking\nliterally\nstress hormones encourage black and\nwhite thinking\nso as you consume a particular diet of\ninformation your cortisol level is going\nto go up as your cortisol level is going\nto go up you're going to start thinking\nin black and white\nso what can you do about this\nthree things first of all\nbe critical of the information that you\nconsume and be critical of how much you\nconsume it and when you consume it and\nhow you consume it\nsecond thing is figure out whether you\nare operating in a cognitive bias now\nthat in and of itself is tricky\nhow do you figure out if you're\noperating in a cognitive device it's\nreally simple there's one tip is your\nthinking black and white\nif your thinking is black and white\nchances are your brain is not behaving\nin a completely like calm\nobjective way\nblack and white is the consequence of\nsubjectiveness\nright you can sort of see that like you\ncan see the stress in any kind of\npolitical discussion it's black and\nwhite there's the good guys and the bad\nguys and i'm part of the good guys down\nwith the bad guys i got to fight for\nthis it's like so much energy so much\nemotion it's a fight for survival and\nthen things become black and white\nbecause that's the way that our brain\nevolved\nyou know if i'm like out fishing on my\nboat and a crocodile takes a bite out of\nthe boat\nmy mind needs to react quickly in a\nblack and white manner it's an issue of\nlife and death\nand that's what we see in all these\npolitical discussions everything seems\nlike the world is ending and there's\ndespair\nright\nthat's what we see here\ni'll be doing this for the majority of\nthe rest of my life i break down and\nstart crying\nhow do you know that you're going to be\ndoing this for the majority of the rest\nof your life\nwhere do you get that idea\ncan this person see the future\ncan you see the future can i see the\nfuture\nwe have no idea like did people 20 years\nago\ncould they have predicted\nbecause i think smartphones are less\nthan 20 years old\nright but like this kind of like we\ndon't realize this because all we see is\nthe here and now and when we suffer\ntime starts to dilate\nso when you're like nauseous like if you\nget food poisoning like time is gonna\ndilate you're gonna be like oh my god\nthis is awful it's gonna last forever\nand then what happens is this person\nit's not it's not just like\ntime dilation because of suffering\nthere's other stuff too because they\nhear this story from people who are 30.\nthey hear this story from people who are\n40.\nthey hear this story from people who are\n25\nbecause of the internet\nso what can you do about it the first\nthing is like control your information\ndiet second thing is recognize if you\nhave black and white thinking and if you\ndo just recognize that the conclusions\nthat your mind are coming to are just\nlike objectively false\nand the third thing that you can do is\nplay chess like figuratively in your\nlife so this is the other thing that you\nall got to understand so i i'm not great\nat chess i'm actually quite bad i barely\nknow how to play\nbut when you look at a chess board at\nthe very beginning because at the age of\n18 you're just starting life\nand your goal is to take the king it's\nan impossible task\nhow on earth are you going to win this\nchess game you can move a pawn you can\nmove a single pawn up one square or two\nsquares\nhow much closer does that get you to\nwinning the game it gets you just as\nclose to winning the game as it does to\nlosing the game\nright\nso when we're 18 and we have this\ndeterministic view of the future like\nthe right thing to do is to start to\nplay chess\nand that's sort of like what i did some\npeople will sort of ask how did i go\nfrom you know\na 2.5 gpa to\ntraining at harvard medical school and\nbeing faculty there like one step at a\ntime it took me years\nit took me about seven years to start to\nput my life together and then after that\nit took me like eight years to\nnot eight four more years to actually\nland at harvard\nso like i finished undergrad that took\nme five years i took some additional\nclasses to try to boost my gpa\ni applied to medical school three times\nstarted medical school at tufts\nright so each of those is like one step\nup\ni did a dual degree program there to try\nto increase my competitiveness\nmatched at mass general hospital in\nmclean hospital for psychiatry training\nthat's\nit's a harvard medical school residency\nand then four years after that i was\nfaculty at harvard medical school\nand that was\ni was 36\ntechnically i was on the faculty at 32\nbecause even as a clinical fellow you're\nfaculty but i was learning there\nright and like my journey started at the\nage of 21. it took me 15 years\nso there's no sense of time and duration\nand each one is like one step forward\nit's like playing a game of chess you're\nbehind a little bit we're going to take\none step forward you're behind a little\nbit we're going to take one step forward\nyou're behind a little bit we're going\nto take one step forward and as you move\nyour pieces you don't know what the plan\nis going to be it's not linear life is\nnot like that\nright you can just make the best move at\nevery step of the way\nand as you make the best move as you\ndevelop your pieces as you get different\nkinds of experience under your belt you\nwill reach a place\nwhere\nthis this future that you're predicting\nis just not the case anymore\nand you're going to spend less time on\nthe internet because you have a life\nthat's worth living\nit's hard to being 18 years old taking a\ngap year and like\ntrying to make some money before you go\nto college is like it's mind-numbingly\ndifficult you get so little reward for\nthe effort that you put in\nand at the same time like\njust because you don't see the reward\nthen does not mean that you're not\naccruing something\nthat certain amount of money will give\nyou a certain amount of freedom\nright it will like position you a little\nbit better in terms of college and stuff\nlike that you'll have a year of work\nexperience under your belt\nyour ability to tolerate bad situations\nis also going to be better like there's\nall kinds of stuff that you're gaining\nthat you don't even\nsee yet\nand case in point is like all of the\nstruggles that i had i never dawned on\nme when i was like 19 years old\nand playing video games until four in\nthe morning and like so i could pass out\nso i didn't have to think about how i\nwas screwing up my life it never crossed\nmy mind that suffering in this way and\nstruggling in this way would allow me to\nhelp people in the future\n15 years later\n16 17 years later\nlike you just can't you have no idea\nwhat life has in store\neveryone thought they knew what was\ngoing on and then\nuh covet hit\neveryone thought they knew what was\ngoing on when bitcoins soared right\nlet's buy luna let's buy this\ncoin let's buy dogecoin shiga coin this\ncoin stable coin terracoin\neveryone was confident and here comes\nthe next thing nfts didn't you know that\nthe video game industry understands that\nnfts are the next big thing that's what\ngamers want\nso we're gonna buy this ape yacht club\nstuff and this is how i'm gonna make my\nmoney like everyone knows the future\nright\nblockchain is what's next web 3.0\nit's a video game that you can make\nmoney playing that's what people want\neveryone's so sure\njust like you are if you're 18 and\nyou're sure that doom and gloom is ahead\nof you like everyone in the world is so\nsure\nso what can you do like take a step back\ncut back on like what you consume off of\nthe internet\nrecognize what helps you and what\ndoesn't look at yourself when you\nwhen you spend time on the internet how\ndoes it make you feel does it actually\nequip you to do better\ndoes it improve your mood because that's\nsort of like what we think right we\nthink if we're like okay if i watch\nenough youtube videos like i'll figure\nthis out and i'm not saying that they\ndon't help there's even preliminary data\nfrom our internal community that we're\nnow applying to the\nethics board to do a study on about\nwatching our content appears to improve\nwe're not really sure about this so it's\nlike we haven't done a study yet we've\njust noticed some initial things appears\nto improve some symptoms that some\nnegative symptoms of mood\nand anxiety by 11 to 20 percent\ninteresting right so people learn stuff\non the internet for sure\nso that's\nit's not even studied data it's like an\ninitial signal that now we have to like\nin a\nnon-biased way examine and see if that\neffect is real or not we don't even know\nif it's real but it's interesting\ncan watching youtube actually improve\nlike symptoms of depression by 20 that's\nthe study that we're applying for now\nso be careful about what you consume\nrecognize your black and white thinking\nand then like ultimately\njust to make one move at a time\nright so if you need to work for one\nyear it's not gonna last forever you\ndon't need to be in that job for the\nnext 50 years\neven this person said i'm taking a gap\nyear this is time limited you all see\nthat like but that's not how the mind\nso taking a gap year we'll go to college\nin the fall i'll be doing this for the\nmajority rest of my life those two\nstatements don't add up\neven internally but the whole point is\nthat once our mind starts thinking in\nthis way once our cortisol level starts\nto rise we start thinking in black and\nwhite we don't even realize this is only\na one year gig\nby definition it's a one year gig\nthere's just this presumption that after\ni get out of college is all i'm going to\nbe able to do and why are you going to\ncollege in the first place if this is a\njob that you you're stuck in for the\nrest of your life there's no point in\ncollege the whole point of going to\ncollege is that it's one step forward\nit's one chess piece you're mobilizing\nyour rook you're mobilizing your night\nand if you mobilize those hopefully\nit'll give you bigger and better\nopportunities\nand that's what i do see i mean i see\nthat as we're kind of seeing in in the\nin in the you know the deloitte survey\nright it's a privately conducted survey\nso take that for what it's worth it's\nnot peer-reviewed published research\nwhat we see is that people are actually\nturning down jobs that are not aligned\nwith what their mission and what they\nwant to accomplish in life which is also\nkind of interesting because that also\nsort of implies and we'll see if you go\nthrough the survey there's other\ninteresting stuff about how many people\nare quitting and how many people are\nmoving that there are more\nmission-driven jobs out there because i\nthink employers are starting to realize\nand not just employers but like people\nare starting to realize that people want\nto do something that matters\nwe're not content to be peons anymore\nand so i know it feels very despairing\nto be in this situation where you're\nlike 18 and you're thinking like oh my\ngod this is what i'm gonna be doing for\nthe rest of my life the rest of your\nlife is a really long time\nokay like i want y'all to just think\nabout how long a life is so i'm going to\nreference my grandmother\none more time\nso she grew up in a village without\nelectricity without running water\nlike airplanes were not invent or maybe\nthey were invented she had certainly\nnever seen one\nlike airplanes were not a thing like for\nthe generations prior to her\nso she the outside world was like i\nremember talking to her about this one\nday the outside world was\ntheoretical\nthere was not a place outside of her\nvillage\nlike people had not left her village\nlike sometimes you'd go to the village\nnext over to get married so there was\nlike some kind of like genetic\ndistribution you kind of like move\nwithin a 50 mile radius\n100 kilometers or something like that to\nlike find mate like people to get\nmarried to\nbut like the idea of another country was\nlike a story it was a myth\nno one she had ever met had ever been to\nanother country\nin\nfor the first 30 years of her life\nactually probably less than that but\nso when she was growing by the time she\nwas 18 she had never met a single person\nwho had been to a different country\nthis is how long her life is\nnow there are airplanes we're sending\npeople into space\nthere's the internet she knows how to\nuse an ipad\nright like just think about\na lack of electricity\nto where we are now\nthat is what encompasses a life and\nthat's like the scope of change\nantibiotic therapy was not commonplace\nlike surgery was i mean there was there\nwas surgery but there's just all kinds\nof stuff the idea of a ventilator or a\ntransplant like can you just think about\nthis she's still alive today\nand when she was like in the 1930s the\nidea or maybe actually transplants did\nexist then i'm not actually sure but the\nidea of like yeah we're gonna take an\norgan out of a dead person and we're\ngonna stick it in you and you're gonna\nlive for 30 more years\nlike\nthat's one lifetime\nand so the concept of attorney the thing\nis the rate of change is increasing\nthe rate of change is increasing\nastronomically so whatever prediction so\nif you were lived 500 years ago you did\na far better job of predicting what your\nlife would look like then you can do\ntoday we have no clue what the world is\ngoing to be like in 20 years in 30 years\nand 40 years who knows\nif we develop quantum computing like\nwhat is that gonna what is that gonna do\nno one has any idea\nare we gonna colonize a different planet\nlike no one has any clue\nastro borne is talking about 3d printing\nso this is the thing so right now so\nthere were like retail stores right and\nretail stores still exist but like\nso does online shopping\nand boy did that put a dent in retail\nthe concept that you don't have to leave\nyour house to get things\nfood\nlike\nladders like i could order a ladder and\nsomeone will bring it to my house\nand the concept of shopping could be\nextinct if 3d printing really catches on\nand economies of scale like happen i\ndon't need to order anything off of\namazon anymore i'm just going to make it\nif i need a screw or if i need a\nreplacement of whatever i'm just going\nto make it i already know people who\ndon't buy miniatures like when i was\ngrowing up people would buy miniatures i\njust 3d print them\ni'll make whatever i want to\nso\nif you're 18 and you're concerned if\nyou're 21 or you're 25\nand you're concerned that this is gonna\nhappen for the rest of your life like\nhonestly you've got no clue like i've\ngot no clue no one's no one can see the\nfuture\nso take whatever steps that you can\nyou"
