    "transcript": "at the end of the day it's fantastic\nthat people are learning how to\ncommunicate and the funny thing is that\nwhat we tend to be doing is it seems\nlike we're like actually pretty good at\nteaching people how to have like deep\nconnections with others the problem is\nthat having deep connections with others\nrequires a skill set that's different\nfrom having fun with others i don't know\nif you all have seen like these um you\nknow these like prank videos where\nsomeone's walking down the street and\nlike 50 people turn a corner and are\nrunning in the opposite direction and\nthe one person who has no idea what's\ngoing around going on turns around and\nlike runs in the same direction with the\npack and the rest of the pack\nwe're having so much fun look i'm doing\nall of the things of having fun aren't\nwe having fun together now everybody\nyou see how hard i'm trying to have fun\naren't we isn't it great y'all see that\nyou see like how terrifying it is to\nempathically\ntry to force people to have fun\ni don't know how to be fun to hang out\nwith\nso hi dr k i'm a 25 year old male who is\na neat for many many years\nenglish is not my first language so i'll\ndo my best to express myself awesome\nuh right now i'm in my second year of\nuniversity i'm meeting new people and\nfor the most part i'm doing just fine\ni've improved a lot through therapy and\nwith some of your videos like the one\nyou did about having conversations\nin this matter i think i'm quite a good\nlistener and some people like to talk\nabout deep stuff with me but that's not\nenough\nit might not sound it might sound weird\nbut i feel like\nthe more i improve as a person the more\ndissatisfied i am with myself\nit's not enough to have stopped being a\nneat it's not enough to make friends who\ntrust in me to talk about their problems\nno i want more i want to be funny and\nengaging but i'm the opposite\nthe other day i was at a party and\npeople there asked me many times why are\nyou so quiet don't be shy stuff like\nthat i really wanted to connect with\nthem and have a good time but my mind\nwent blank i didn't really feel socially\nanxious or anything it was just that\nnothing came to my mind this happens to\nme a lot i'm only worth for serious\nconversations for the fun stuff there\nare other people i don't want to be like\nthis i want to make people laugh and\nenjoy myself with them\nso really interesting posts right so the\nfirst thing that i want to point out is\nthat this is almost in a sense the exact\nopposite\nof\nother things that we've talked about\nwhich is that we've had a lot of uh you\nknow\npeople in our community who've said i\ndon't like small talk i have trouble\nauthentically connecting with people i i\ndon't know if you all have been here for\na while but you all have seen that like\nsometimes we'll get these questions\nwhere like all i can do is like shallow\nstuff i don't know how to form deeper\nconnections\nand so i think like th this post the\nfirst thing that i want to do is like i\nwant to acknowledge and applaud this\nperson's effort right so who was a neat\nfor many many years but was a neat right\nso this person is 25 years old and now\nthey're in their second year of\nuniversity right and and they're doing\njust fine so for those of you that are\nconcerned that like you're going to be\nlike this forever\nthe good news is that you don't have to\nbe like that right so i've improved a\nlot through therapy and with some of\nyour videos awesome that's what we're\nhere for and that's what therapy is here\nfor so i think this is like really\nfantastic that this person is like doing\nbetter\nthe other thing is this person is\nlearning\nso they've watched some of our videos\nand in some of our videos what we do is\nwe break down\nhow to converse with people right so\nlike people like who are struggling to\nform social relationships or like don't\nknow how to make friends and stuff like\nthat we have a lot of stuff where we\nlike talk through okay this is not just\nsome like intrinsic skill this is\nactually something that can be taught\njust like how to cook how to dance how\nto speak how to make music how to play\nvideo games social interactions can be\ntaught you can understand and break down\nthe formula of how to be socially adept\nand it looks like this person has done a\ngood job because they've sort of figured\nout\nsome of the stuff that we sort of teach\nin terms of like how to be a good\nlistener right\nand they're actually able to get people\nto open up to them\nand and sort of discuss deep things\nand at the same time this person doesn't\nknow how to just be fun so they've sort\nof figured out\nhow you sort of like you know have deep\nconversations but they're not quite sure\nhow to have fun\nlike how do i like just have fun\nconversations with people which is\ntotally great i'm glad you asked that\nquestion because we're gonna teach you\nokay so let's take a quick look at\nthis scenario okay so the first thing\nlet's let's sketch out\num you know the\nbackground\nof this\ncase okay\nwe have a 25 year old\nformer neat\ngood job\nokay so able to form\nable to do deep conversations\nis a good listener\nbut then they said a couple of other\nthings\none is they sort of pointed out and this\nis actually really really good\nright so\nkind of other stuff to consider is that\nthey never seem satisfied\nokay so they think i don't know if you\nall kind of caught this but they're\nasking about like how to communicate\nwith people and then there's this this\nthis\nweird paragraph kind of in the middle\nthat's like not about communication it's\nabout a lack of satisfaction within\nthemselves and we'll get to that in a\nsecond um\nso and then we're gonna kind of kind of\nget to this which is i really wanted to\nconnect with them and have a good time\nbut my mind went blank i didn't really\nfeel socially anxious or anything it was\njust that nothing came to my mind\ni'm only worth it for serious\nconversations okay\nso we'll kind of go to this\nin the sentiment of\nonly worth it\nfor serious conversations\nthis is where we're going to sort of\npoint out a couple of things if you all\nhave been like you know viewers of the\nstream and stuff like that you're going\nto sort of recognize that this over here\nis probably a some scar\nokay and what we're probably like\nlooking at here is when i'm a 25 year\nold male who's been a neat for a long\nlong time this is going to lead to\nfeelings of like\nlow self worth\nand if we look at some some of these\nkinds of dialogue right like\nthey're they believe\nthey have low self-worth right so like i\nfeel the\nmore i improve as a person the more\ndissatisfied i am with myself which is\nreally paradoxical right\nbecause we would think that the more\nthat you improve\nthe more satisfied with yourself you\nshould become\nso like that's kind of weird so there's\nlike that's the sign of a some scar it's\nnot enough it's never enough and why is\nthat it's because when you're 25 years\nold and you've been in need for a while\nyou need to make up for it right because\nwhat you've got is you've got this like\nkind of seed\nof\nnot being like a worthwhile person\nthat you've watered and watered and\nwatered and fertilized for many many\nyears and now it's grown into a big\nplant\nand that's going to be there so you can\nstart planting another seed of like\npositivity and like positive self-worth\nbut the old seed is going to be there\nand so anytime people will ask you why\nare you so quiet don't be shy it's going\ngonna like activate that part of your\nmind that makes you think i'm not good\nenough\nright for so long you have been telling\nyourself\nthat you're not good enough or you\nshould be more and so when that happens\nfor a long time like this is gonna\npersist\nokay and then you're gonna have these\nkinds of thoughts only worth\nit\nfor deep conversations\nand then if you keep going what you'll\nsort of get to is even these kinds of\nthoughts where people only talk to me\nbecause they get something out of it so\nthe only reason they're my friend is\nbecause i'm the therapist friend\nright\nand so now what we see is like the\nreason that this person is able to get\nhere is because they socially improved\nright they learned they watched some of\nour videos and stuff went to therapy and\nall that good stuff and now they like\nlearned how to be good listeners\nso they learned\nyou know things like reflective\nlistening\nthey learned open-ended questions\num i'd be curious if this person did\ngroup coaching because this is what we\ntend to see in group coaching is that\npeople get really really good at like\nhaving deep conversations and being like\ngood at listening so this is something\nthat we sort of like will try so in\norder to facilitate\nunderstanding and group coaching what we\nsort of have to do is teach people like\nhow do you listen and like how do you\nask\nquestions that sort of like dig deeper\nand how do you sort of reflect on\nyourself so these are the kinds of\nthings this is generally speaking what\nwe tend to focus on right so this i'm\ncurious if this person did group\ncoaching\nor if they just watch videos either one\nis possible\nbut now what we're going to talk about\nis how do you have fun\nand the good news is that there's\nactually a way to do this\nso let's take a step back for a second\nand just think about this for a second\nokay\nso\nhow do you have fun interactions with\npeople\nso this is where like if we really think\nabout the components of fun in an\ninteraction what does it kind of come\ndown to so the first thing that people\nmay think is like shared interests right\nif i talk about video gaming and someone\nelse talks about video gaming we both\nlike the same thing\nthat will be fun\nbut that's not necessarily the case\nright because you can talk about people\nwho you can talk with people who also\nlike the same game you you like but\nsometimes like it's actually a super\ntoxic interaction where all you all are\ndoing is arguing it's not necessarily\nfun like you can like two people you can\nhave two people who both like cake and\nin fact they can both be\npastry chefs\nand even though their their lives are\nvery similar in a lot of ways there's\nlike a lot of clashing right so first\nthing is that we assume that a lot of\nfun from an interaction\nstarts before the interaction if that\nkind of makes sense right so whether i\nhave fun with someone depends on like\nall of these things before i even meet\nthem like what do we like do we have a\nshared background do we have a shared\nupbringing do we like the same stuff do\nwe listen to the same music that's what\npeople think of it's fun\nturns out that that's not really the\ncase so what we're gonna sort of zero in\non is like some actually like scientific\nprinciples of how to have fun\ninteractions okay and what we're really\ngonna focus on\nis one major thing so the first thing is\nwe may think shared interests\nwe may think shared background\nbut it's not really how it works\nbecause there can be people who are of\nyour ethnicity of your religion who play\nthe same games you do and what you guys\ncan do is like actually just drive each\nother crazy so that's not it so what is\nthe fundamental nature of fun so this is\ngoing to be kind of tricky but we're\ngoing to have to do this oh you guys\ncan't see that whoops\nokay\nso that's what i drew real real quick\nso i'll show you all so\nyou're sitting there you're watching dr\nk right watching dr k you ready for it\ny'all ready for it so as i smile\nright what are you doing right now\nwhat are you doing right now\nare you smiling too\nare we having fun yet chat\nright we're smiling\ncringing stop it\nso this is very important to understand\nlike how did we do that what happened\nthere\nright so as soon as i stop and i go back\ninto teaching mode you start to feel\ncalmer\nright\nah body language okay so this is where\nif you want to have fun with someone the\nmost important thing that you need to\nunderstand is empathy\nso this is how human beings work\nif you human beings are empathic that's\njust how we are right so like you i\ndon't know if you all have seen like\nthese um you know these like prank\nvideos where someone's walking down the\nstreet and like 50 people turn a corner\nand are running in the opposite\ndirection and the one person who has no\nidea what's going around going on turns\naround and like runs in the same\ndirection with the pack the rest of the\npack right so as human beings we have\nlike group think\nwe have like herd behavior\nand that's because we have all these\nlike empathic circuits\nand so this is where when you go into an\ninteraction and you're like i'm gonna\ntry to have fun i gotta have fun i gotta\nhave fun what's going on up here you're\nstressed out as you stress out what are\nyou empathically projecting\nyou're empathically projecting stress\nand what people will see is like what\nthey'll sort of receive from you is\nstress and then the whole tension in the\nroom will rise so you all may know this\nbecause if you like know someone well\nyou don't even have to know someone well\nyou can go into like a random room and\nif someone comes in and they're pissed\noff you can tell and it makes you\nuncomfortable you don't have to know\nthem you don't have to know their\nmannerisms you can just tell\nthis person is like pissed off and i'm\ngonna steer clear it makes me tense\nright\nso the first thing to understand\nif you want to have fun with people you\nhave to have fun yourself\ni know that sounds kind of weird but\nlike if you're trying to enter into\ninteractions where like\nyour your goal is to like\nhave fun with them and this is where i\nwant to tunnel down into some some of\nthis language because i think this is\nimportant to recognize\nright\nfor fun stuff there are other people so\nthis is where we've got to be really\ncareful sometimes because when\nwhen we\nthe way that this person is almost\nstarting to think about interactions is\nthat it's sort of like a one-way street\nwhere\ni am going to present something\nto the other person for them to have fun\nright so like i can be a good listener\nor i can be in fun mode but i don't know\nhow else to say this but this feels very\nlike one way to me so like for fun stuff\nif somebody else wants to have fun\nthey're not going to spend time with me\nthey're going to spend time with someone\nelse if someone wants to have a deep\nconversation they're going to come to me\nand they're going to talk to me about it\nbut we're not seeing\nyou know this we're not seeing this\nperson in this interaction\nwe're not seeing like what does this\nperson get out of it right do they enjoy\nit what about their fun like i'm not\nseeing anything about that\nyou know it's not enough to make friends\nwho trust in me to talk about their\nproblems no i want to be funny engaging\nbut i'm the opposite and so that's where\ni'd say like this is where the first\nthing you should do is think about your\nown enjoyment in the conversation\nso now what we're going to talk a little\nbit about is empathy\nand this is where\nif you are having a good time\nother people will enjoy your company\nand i don't know if you guys\nif you all have seen this but like you\nknow sometimes you'll like hear someone\ntalking about something that they're\nsuper passionate about\nand you don't even have to like what\nthey're talking about but just the fact\nthat they're so passionate about it is\nlike somewhat enjoyable\nright it's like you can even like watch\nsomeone you know dancing or something\nlike that or even like eating food and\nyou can get some amount of enjoyment out\nof just watching someone else like\nreally really enjoying themselves\nand that's because of empathy it's the\nfirst thing that you should do if you\nwant to have fun with people\nis try to have a good time yourself\nand this is where you're going to say\nwell like in order for me to have a good\ntime i have to have fun\nand in order for me to have a good time\nlike i need other people to enjoy my\ncompany and like it's like kind of a\nchicken or the egg sort of thing right\nwell that's where i'd say you can\nactually steer the conversation in a\ncouple of ways right so you can actually\nsteer the conversation in things that\nyou enjoy talking about you can steer\nthe conversation or the interaction in\nways that\num you know kind of like make you\nexcited like there are things that you\ncan start talking about you can shift\nthe conversation towards things that you\nenjoy so you could just you have to be a\nlittle bit careful about this we'll get\nto like part two in a second but the\nfirst thing is because of empathic\ncircuits in the brain\nif you're having a good time they're\ngonna have a good time\nand that's where if you're thinking okay\nin order for me to have a good time i\nneed them to have a good time then think\nabout what that projects empathically i\nneed you to have a good time i'm\nstressed out about whether you're having\na good time and this is exactly the\nproblem that people fall into is they're\nlike i'm trying to have fun but i'm\ntrying so hard to have fun\nthat it ends up empathically sending\nsignals of like stress and like trying\nreally hard to like make something work\nand then people kind of feel that\ntension it's like hahaha let's have fun\nnow look we'll even try it here i'm\ngoing to show you guys and pat\nnon-empathic laughter you guys ready\n[Laughter]\nwe're having so much fun look i'm doing\nall of the things of having fun aren't\nwe having fun together now everybody ha\nha you see how hard i'm trying to have\nfun aren't we isn't it great\n[Laughter]\ny'all see that you see like how\nterrifying it is to empathically\ntry to force people to have fun\nyou all get that like do you seriously\ndo you get that so this is where what\nyou gotta do is you just gotta chill\nyou know you gotta like take a step back\nlike within yourself and be like all\nright\nwe're gonna vibe with chat today we're\ngonna talk about a couple of things\nright we're gonna like i guess be a\nlittle bit ridiculous and now think\nabout how you feel\nright even as i sort of take a step back\ni'm like that was a little bit crazy and\nnow as i'm starting to have a better\ntime like i'm returning back to like\nlecturing mode teaching modes stuff like\nthat you start to chill out so there's\nlike that empathic connection\nso that's where i'd recommend actually\nlike steer the conversation towards\nsomething that you naturally enjoy\ntalking about\nokay\nso like as you steer the conversation in\nthat way like your tone of voice will\nchange your face will light up and if\nyour face lights up a little bit like\nthen you're gonna be having a good time\nand someone else is gonna be having a\ngood time\nthat's the first thing okay\nso talk about things that you enjoy\ntalking about steer the conversation and\nstuff that you're kind of interested in\nbut there's a problem with this which is\nthat if you're not careful\nwhat's gonna happen is you're gonna like\nif you overdo it\nyou're gonna bore the other person\nokay\nand so like if i keep on talking about\nlike oh my god like i love space turtles\ndude like space turtles are so awesome\ni'm writing this awesome uh fan fiction\nabout space turtles\nand it's all about turtles from outer\nspace and they go into space and they\ncome out of space and they're turtles\nand they've got four little legs and a\ntail and we put like this little jet\npack on the back of their shell and then\nthey we've got and you just keep going\nand going and going and going and going\nso here's where the second bit of\nempathy comes in\nso this is sort of what we're talking\nabout here is going to be like\nprojective empathy\nso since human beings are empathic\ncreatures we can project something\nand what we project they're going to\nreceive\nand then i guess like the other kind of\nempathy that we're going to talking\nabout is like a reject receptive empathy\nso then what you've got to do\nis tune into the other person so talk\nabout something that you enjoy for like\n60 to 90 seconds\nright and that's not where like the more\nyou kind of time it you're like oh my\ngod like here we go like 60 1 2 3 4. if\nyou're stressed out about it\njust like share something that you're\nhappy about share something that's like\ngood in your day like man\ni had the best slice of pizza today it\nwas like amazing like man sometimes i\njust really love pizza then what you've\ngot to do\nis tune into them and like see what they\nlike how they're gauging what you're\ndoing and then kind of tune into them\nand be like okay so like\nyou know\num what kind of food do you like\nright and then like sort of like\npunt things kind of back over them and\nso pay attention to how they respond and\nwhat you're doing by sort of sharing\nthis positive empathy by sort of having\nthis projective empathy that's like kind\nof like positive and upbeat and stuff\nlike that you're kind of opening the\ndoor for them to sort of give you the\nsame right and they're like yeah dude\nlike i totally love pizza\nman like what's your favorite pizza\nplace and then they ask you that\nquestion then you all are kind of having\na good time you're just kind of like\nvibing and stuff like that you don't\nhave to ask some deep personal questions\nabout themselves you don't have to\nlisten you can just sort of like then\nyou can kind of like go back to\nprojecting you can share well i had this\nawesome slice of pizza up in chicago um\nbut you know like i argue with my friend\nall the time about whether chicago pizza\nis better or new york pizza is better\nand then you pause and you kind of check\nin with them right so you stop talking\nso you can sort of use silence\nthese are your tools so you can be quiet\nfor a second and give them a chance to\nkind of volunteer but that too you want\nto be like a little bit careful there\nbecause you don't want to just be quiet\nright so you don't want to do this\nyou guys ready for the cringe again here\nwe go\nso i really like chicago deep dish pizza\nbut my friend up in new york says that\nnew york pizza is better\nright so you want to be like you want to\ngive people an opportunity\nto jump into the conversation but you\ndon't want to like linger it too long so\nwhat i would say is like yes\nit's the stair right\nit's not just the silence it's the fact\nthat my affect you guys see what that\ndoes to you like my face is gonna make\nyou feel particular things and the cool\nthing is like that's it's not because my\nface is special this is just how our\nbrain is wired you all get that so you\ncan like start to use some of these\nprinciples of sort of like projective\nempathy and receptive empathy\nwhere you're kind of checking in with\nthem sort of like okay like is this\nperson like have i given this person a\nchance to talk yet\nyou know maybe i should toss out a\nquestion and the main thing is just like\ntry to have fun with the person yourself\ndon't worry about making them have a\ngood time because when you're so\nconcerned about them having a good time\nthen\nthey're stressed out and you're stressed\nout because like that's empathically\nwhat you're projecting\nand then you can then it feels like\nyou're trying too hard\nright so a lot of times people get\nfrustrated because there's all this kind\nof like useless advice that people don't\nknow how to manage so what what are the\npitfalls\noh you're having trouble dating you're\ntrying too hard\njust relax\nright\ntake it easy\nthis is what everyone tells you you're\nlike how do i do that\nif i could do that i would do that\nthese are the pitfalls so what do you do\nokay so the first thing is like project\npositivity empathically and this is\nwhere like you don't want to pretend to\nbe positive you don't want to be sitting\nthere and be like okay i got to be\npositive gotta be positive gotta be\npositive ready three two one smile\nit's gonna terrify people it's like okay\nso like hey i have five minutes with\nthis person this is what i want y'all to\ndo you take a step back\ni'm a chat with this person for like\nfive minutes\nhow am i gonna have fun in the next five\nminutes what do i want to talk about\nwhat's going on in my life that i could\nshare what's something that i could\nshare that would genuinely make me happy\nright and that's where you got to be\nlike a little bit careful so you don't\nwant to do what i did when i was a\nfreshman in college and i was talking to\nthis girl and i was very excited because\nwarcraft 3 was coming out and i\nproceeded to be very very excited and\nbubbly and talk to her for 14 15 minutes\nabout how warcraft 3 was coming out\nand then i told her hey by the way i\ndon't think i'm gonna be able to hang\nout much over the next couple weeks\nbecause i'm gonna be playing this game\nand i never heard from her again\nright so i like went like i was\ncompletely\nnot receptive to the empathic\nsignals she was sending which is like\nthis is kind of weird\nright would have been totally fine to be\nlike hey like i'm super excited because\nthere's a game coming out like anything\nin particular you're looking forward to\nthis semester\nhow's your semester going wow that's\nawesome\nright or like yeah that really sucks\nso then you can sort of like use but but\nthe key thing about having fun with\nsomeone is you can't like this is what i\nkind of summarize with okay\nyou can't have fun with someone or you\ncan't make someone else have fun\nthe only way to really do it or the best\nway to do it is to have fun with them\nthat's the whole point right but this is\nwhere like the more that we struggle to\ntry to have a good time\nthe more that we move out of having fun\nwith someone and trying to like create\nfun\nfor both of us\nwhich means that you just try too hard\nwhich empathically sends the wrong\nsignals they pick up on your stress and\nthen interactions seem forced\nokay\nand so this is the kind of thing where\nwhere what we've got to do is just like\ntry to have fun with someone so that\nsort of involves like how are you gonna\nhave fun with this interaction what do\nyou want to talk about that would be\ninteresting what's a topic of\nconversation that they could engage in\nthat you would find interesting\nright so that's all like you got to\nsteer the conversation and as you move\nthe conversation towards something that\nyou enjoy\nyou're going to be more relaxed over it\nyou're going to have a good time let\nyourself kind of flow into it\nand then what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to sort of like check in with them\nso we're going to have some amount of\nreceptive empathy we're going to like\nkey in so after 60 or 90 seconds we're\ngoing to pause and sort of see like okay\nthis is kind of interesting and then\neven if you feel like you've talked too\nlong you can say my bad you know i got\nsuper excited about this just because\ni've been looking forward to it\nwhat about you\nright so\nat the end of the day it's fantastic\nthat people are learning how to\ncommunicate and the funny thing is that\nwhat we tend to be doing is it seems\nlike we're like actually pretty good at\nteaching people how to have like deep\nconnections with others\nthe problem is that\ndeep connect having deep connections\nwith others requires a skill set that's\ndifferent from having fun with others\nand if we talk a little bit about okay\nlike how do you have fun with people we\nsort of assume that like people are just\nnatural at it which they may be\nbut the good news is that we actually\nknow like how human beings enjoy each\nother's company like we know what that\nsort of means there's a certain amount\nof spontaneity to it and the key thing\nthat most people sort of lose track of\nis empathy and the key thing there is\nthat the more that you try to have fun\nthe more internally stressed you are\nand the more internally stressed you are\nthe harder it's going to be for you to\nhave fun because you're going to be\nprojecting that stress\nand then sometimes what will happen is\nlike that's when people sort of feel\ndesperate\nright that's when people feel like\nthey're trying too hard and if you're\ntrying too hard it's the very opposite\nof fun which is like what's so tricky\nabout it because people are like smart\nyou all are like really good at this\nstuff you know you try to figure this\nstuff out the challenge is that the more\nyou try towards it the harder it becomes\nso the more that you understand like\nsort of how empathy works and sort of to\nproject a certain kind of empathic\nsignal\nand also the more the open-minded you\nare to receive whatever signal they're\nsending the closer you'll you'll get it\nsort of like modulating and kind of like\nmeeting kind of in the middle and the\nmore relaxed the more you're able to do\nthat the more you all are vibing right\nbecause that's what vibing means we even\nhave a term for it when i'm on a\nwavelength and someone else is on the\nsame wavelength that's what we call\nvibing\nso how do you vibe with people because\nthat's what fun is right you vibe\nthrough like sort of projective empathy\nand kind of like receptive empathy okay\nquestions uh so anit is not is someone\nwho is not in employment education or\ntraining lita li does saying stream do\nbe giving me hope to keep going today\ngood\nkeep going\nso here's the thing to remember\nif you have hope to keep going the hope\nin and of itself\nhas a\nactual effect\nright we we tend to think about hope is\nsomething that's purely internal and\ndoesn't affect outcomes but the truth of\nthe matter is that hope does affect\noutcomes\nthere are studies on this that have been\ndone that when you have people who lack\nhope they actually perform more poorly\nand essentially when you give up is like\nyou know\nwinners don't quit and quitters don't\nwin can you save a conversation if you\nfind them boring sure so that's where\nlike i'd think a little bit about\nyou know first of all why you find them\nboring\nbecause if you have that kind of\njudgment in your mind\nthen it's going to be hard so it's\nalmost like the placebo effect or the\nnocebo effect what you think about them\nis going to influence\nhow you interpret what they say\nso i'd say the biggest thing to save a\nconversation is actually to adjust your\nown judgment\nso to acknowledge that like this is a\nhuman being just think about this for a\nsecond this is a human being\nwho has had their own experiences\nand like background and knowledge that\nthey've learned challenges that they've\nfaced struggles they've had triumphs\nthey've had\nthis is someone who's\nlived a whole separate life from yours\nand so there's got to be like something\nnovel interesting or something that you\ncan learn from them\nthere's just no way like if it's a\ndifferent gender different race like\nwhat's it like to be that person right\nlike what is what lessons is this person\nwhat kind of content what dlcs does this\nperson have access to that i will never\nbe able to play\nand maybe you can like like that's\npretty cool right like thinking about\nokay like what levels what dlcs does\nthis person have access to\nlike tell me about which dlcs you have\nimagine if you're playing a game like\neldon ring but like each person you meet\nhas their own five unique dlcs\nthat you guys have a lot of shared\ncontent\nbut there's like unique content that you\nyou'll never be able to play but it'd be\nlike cool to hear about right\nso i just if you want to save a\nconversation\nyou know i'd start by like thinking a\nlittle bit about your own perspective in\nthe conversation\nand then there's also like some stuff\nthat you can sort of do like you can\nsort of\nyou know you can kind of like\nacknowledge the conversation maybe seems\nhard or whatever you can kind of go meta\nfor a second so cyber andy's asking\ncyber dandy sorry he's asking dr k why\ndo you know all this stuff do they teach\nabout fun in med school no they don't\nso i know about this stuff from a\ncombination of different places one is\nthat i've taken sort of the attitude\nthat i just explained which is that\nevery person i meet like\nit's a whole different they're like\ndlc's that they've got that i don't have\naccess to so when i tend to spend time\nwith people i try to really learn as\nmuch as i can from them and you'd be\namazed at like how much you can learn if\nyou actually like try\nlike most of the day\nsecond thing is i just read a lot\nand like i listen to a lot of stuff and\nthen the third thing third or fourth\nthing is okay so here's dr k's guide to\nlike learning a bunch of random stuff\nokay first thing\nnumber one\nunderstand that any person you meet is\ngonna have access to information or\nknowledge or experience that you will\nnever have\nand so it's possible to like learn\nsomething substantial from every single\nperson you meet\nnumber two\nlike i read\na lot\ngenerally speaking so i'll i read about\n10 to 15 scientific papers a week\nand this is where there's studies that\nshow so there's some studies on medicine\nso back when i was like trying to be a\ngood doctor\nyou know there were studies that show\nlike okay like which doctors do a good\njob and which doctors do less of a good\njob and there's sort of this idea that\nthe more experience you have the better\nyou are at something\nthis turns out to actually be one of the\nmost critical\nmisunderstandings that most people have\nso the simplest way to understand this\nis you like i don't know what games\ny'all play but chances are like\nin most moba games or fps games your\nyour rating your matchmaking rating your\nmmr what rank you're at tends to stay\nlike relatively constant after the first\nhundred games\nright so you'll have people who are like\nhard stuck in bronze for like six years\nand they ju so experience doesn't\nactually lead to improvement and people\nhave done studies on patient outcomes\nand found that this is true of doctors\nas well that you can have a doctor with\n30 years of experience or a doctor with\nfive years of experience and that one\nthe five the person with five years of\nexperience is actually going to\noutperform the person with 30 years of\nexperience and\nfurthermore you can make predictions\nat one year out two years out of which\ndoctor will have better outcomes like 10\nyears from now 20 years from now\nand essentially what it comes down to is\nhow active of a learner you are\nso some people will just mindlessly\ngrind and they won't get better and\nother people will actively continually\ntry to learn\nand the people who actively try to learn\nare the ones that end up learning more\nbig surprise so once i sort of realized\nthat i realized that like no amount of\ntraining behind me\nis enough\nright like i can go to med school i can\nstudy to become a monk i can do all\nthese different kinds of things\nbut\nthe second i stopped trying to learn is\nthe second i plateau\nso i just read a fair amount right so\ni'll read books and stuff like that i\nread a lot of scientific papers i\npersonally like to read scientific\npapers because i find that most books\nthat summarize information\nwill have a lot of like biases or\nconclusions or things like that\nessentially it's expert opinion but it's\none person's opinion as opposed to the\nactual evidence and there are all kinds\nof different things that you know once\nyou dig into the evidence you'll be able\nto like get closest to like reality\nand then you'll sort of like you can\nform your own conclusions\nthat's the second thing third thing is\nthat\num so i did study for many years to\nbecome a monk and what i really realized\nis that there is a way to analyze your\nown experience which leads to a lot of\nlike learning\nso instead of just you know taking\nthings at face value that there are all\nkinds of different things that i can\nanalyze like so this is what i sort of\ndiscovered this almost is more from the\nyogic side but what i what i really\ndiscovered from like all the you know\nthe monk training is that each aspect of\nhuman experience can be like broken down\nand understood which is sort of what\nscience says but the problem is that\nscience looks at\npiles of people instead of an individual\nright so science will look at like for\nexample\nyou know which major\ncorrelates with like\nwhat median income which is a fair thing\nto say\nbut remember that there's a lot of\nindividual variance between majors\nright so like if i decide to study\ncomputer programming\ni may make more money on average than\nsomeone who who studies creative writing\nbut the truth of the matter is that\nthere are a lot of people out there who\nstudy creative writing who make way more\nmoney than developers do\nand so you have to be careful about\nbasing your life on averages as opposed\nto your own personal experience\nand that's where you just have to sort\nof like\nlook at\nlearn from your own experience so what i\nsort of did for example for this kind of\ntalk\nis many years ago\ni decided to set out with the goal of\nlike making friends and what i'm gonna\ndo is like use my meditative training\nevery time i'm in a social interaction\ni'm gonna pay attention to what's going\non i'm gonna pay attention to myself i'm\ngonna pay attention to like how i feel\ni'm going to use my powers of\nobservation to sort of like pay\nattention to other people and then like\nthe more that i interact the more that\ni'm self-reflective even recently like i\nsaid you know i recently had a text\nexchange with a very good friend of mine\nabout like in which i sort of gained\nsome exp awareness of like how i was\nsort of mistreating them i was being\njudgmental towards them i wasn't like\nmistreating them but i recognized that\nwithin my own mind i was making\njudgments that despite my politeness\nwe're not authentic\nright so like because i was being polite\ninstead of and then what i realized is\nlike oh the judgment within me is wrong\nso you can sort of like study yourself\nand i think if you do these three things\nthen you'll like learn a ton\nis it possible to have conversations\nwhen you seem to be the only one that\ndoesn't have a lot of shared interest\ncompared to those around you 100\ni would even go as far as saying uh\nthat's when it's the easiest\nto have conversations\nso\nhere's the thing if y'all want to have\nconversations with people who\nshare interests and you don't\nreally simple way to do it in fact this\nis the easiest conversation to have\nand the reason for that is if you think\nabout it if you share an interest with\nsomeone\nthe conversation is going to be specific\nto the interest what kind of pokemon do\nyou like this is what kind of pokemon i\nlike how do you like to evolve your\npokemon where do you catch this pokemon\noh this is my favorite pokemon which was\nthe first pokemon that you which one did\nyou pick did you pick bulbasaur right\nyou can talk a lot of specifics about\nthe particular thing\nbut the cool thing is there's one script\nor one major script for all the\nconversations that you have no interest\nin\nthis script is very simple it's this\nso i'm not really like i don't have much\nexperience with pokemon can you tell me\nwhat you like about it explain it to me\nthat's it\nright so then they start talking be like\nif there's something you don't\nunderstand\nyour goal in the conversation is try to\nunderstand what they're talking about\nwhat is a pokemon you catch them like\nhow does that work\nare you all like animal control you use\na pokeball what's a pokeball\nand a very very good way to practice\nthis kind of conversation is to talk to\na kid\nbecause like the kid is going to know\nsome random crap that you've never heard\nof\nright and you just be like what is this\nchild talking about\nso you can just like like ask like try\nto understand this kind of goes back to\nthe dlc thing where like this person has\na whole set of experience right so in\none hour of talking with this person you\ncan learn so much about this topic\njust ask them questions about it be like\nthat's interesting and whatever you\ngenuinely find interesting about it is\nwhat you should ask about\nand at some point you may want to kind\nof volunteer like certain perspectives\nof your own and stuff like that to be\nlike that's oh so so like i see you're\nin pokemon like i really like i see that\nthere's also like card games and and\nvideo games like i'm a huge fan of\nyu-gi-oh have you ever played like\nyu-gi-oh you should really check it out\nhere's what i like about it blah blah\nblah blah blah blah blah does that sound\nfamiliar to you is that what pokemon is\nlike and then you can just like have a\nconversation about it\nyou don't need to share interest this is\nthe biggest misnomer that people have in\nfact i find it actually easier to have\nstimulating conversations with people\nwho i don't share interests with\nand then you just learn about\nyou"
