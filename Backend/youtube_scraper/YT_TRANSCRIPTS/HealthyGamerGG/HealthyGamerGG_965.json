    "transcript": "what's the ratio of energy investment in\nputting yourself out there and\nstruggling through anxiety like how many\ndays do i need to be anxious before i\nmake a friend\ni feel unlovable and it sucks\njust venting a little since right now\ni'm completely lonely with zero friends\nas i have been for years and my only\nfriend right now doesn't talk to me for\na while i feel unlovable\ni'm tired of always texting people\nmaking sure they haven't forgotten about\nme because i'm anxious that they're\nlosing interest\nslash are going to leave\ni'm tired of working on myself and my\nanxiety\nand getting zero friends out of it\ni'm tired of being so motivated and\nworking so damn hard on myself and\ngetting nothing out of it\nin general yes i feel unlovable and it's\nabsolutely no surprise i'm not confident\nin myself considering what i've been\nthrough it's no surprise to me that it's\nhard for me to make friends that i\nalways feel like nobody likes me or\ncares about me\nand even years pass and even though from\na young age i was determined to change\nmy situation\nit feels like i've been stuck for so\nlong despite my self-awareness and\ndespite seeking help in therapy and it\njust sucks so much\ni don't know i never felt like i\ni don't know i never felt like i was\nlike other people or like me\nmy personality and ideas\nbelonged in this world i felt so\ndifferent i still do\ni feel like i'm suppressing parts of\nmyself because they don't help me make\nfriends\nbeing honest and communicating about my\nfeelings doesn't help me being open\ndoesn't help me loosening up doesn't\nhelp me\neven talking to people and being\nfriendly doesn't do anything it only\nit's only making everything worse\nif even being friendly doesn't help me\nmake friends then what does\ni can be smiling and have fun with\npeople in certain moments and they still\nwould prefer someone else over me\ni don't know what helps anymore i'm\nstill friendless i'm trying to work on\nmy anxiety right now and my social\nskills hoping it'll make a difference in\nmy life someday\ni'm still hopeful and determined as i've\nalways been but i just needed to get\nthis off my chest it's interesting 100\nupvote rate\nso this is tough\nlet's be honest\nso sometimes\nwe're lonely\nwe don't have any friends\nand we do what we're supposed to\nwe're good little boys and girls\nwe're told to work on your social skills\nbe friendly give it a chance put\nyourself out there\nand we do those things\nbut it doesn't work\nthen you start to feel tired\nand then you start to feel a little bit\nresentful because like you're doing\neverything you're supposed to right\nyou're working on yourself you're going\nto therapy everyone's like go see a\ntherapist like okay cool i'll do that\nit's like put yourself out there and you\ndo that\nyou text people back\ni mean you don't text people back you\ntext people hoping they'll text back\nyou remind them that you exist hey by\nthe way remember me we hung out those\nthree times and it seemed like we had a\nreally good time but you're like\ni haven't heard from you\nand you kind of text them and they don't\nthey don't really text you\nor they text you back but they don't\ntext you first\nand so you start to become like margin\nlike they're like out living their lives\nand you're trying to form some kind of\nconnection and they're just they don't\nseem to care\nand so what are you supposed to do\nyou're supposed to be friendly right\nlike oh like relation like relationships\nare two-way street like let me text them\nand you work on yourself because that's\nwhat everyone says right you can't\ncontrol other people you can control\nyourself so work on yourself so like\nokay i'm doing that\nand then as this goes on for a while it\ngets really tough because like you don't\nhave an infinite energy\nyou do what's supposed you're supposed\nto do\nand if you still don't have friends like\nwhat do you do after that\nwell you dig deeper\nright you're like okay like that's not\nworking like\nlet me try again\nright effort and hard work lead to\nsuccess let me try again let me text\nthis person for the seventh time\nlet me put myself out there for the\neighth time let me struggle with anxiety\nand sort of like try to be friendly with\npeople but they still don't text me back\nfor the ninth time tenth time\nand then you start to get really\nexhausted\nand then what are you supposed to do\nbecause everything to fix this problem\ndoesn't seem to be working and takes\nenergy\nit takes so much energy\nand so you're exhausted\nand then like do you dig deeper and try\nagain like like do you give up like how\ndo you know\nwhen you're supposed to give up\nand when you're supposed to keep trying\nand like keep getting more exhausted\nlike how are you supposed to know\nlike when is this going to work like how\nlong do you have to do this does anyone\never tell you like yeah you just need to\nwork on your social skills for like 6.5\nmonths it's not like a video game where\nyou can see like each little\npip\nof progress oh yeah you got a star five\nstars makes\na\na diamond\nfive diamonds increases your rank up\neach rank up moves you towards your\nsecond class\nif you move up three classes you get a\nmedal\nlike we know how to measure progress in\nvideo games we don't have to measure\nprogress with this crap\nlike how do you even know if this is\njust like you should be doing it more\nor you're doing it wrong like are you\neven investing your energy in the right\nway\nso what you end up feeling is\ntired\nfirst of all\nuncertain second of all because if\nsomeone told you if someone told you\nthey're like yeah just do this for three\nmore months and you'll be fine you'll\nhave a friend what's the ratio of energy\ninvestment in putting yourself out there\nand struggling through anxiety like how\nmany like\nhow many days do i need to be anxious\nbefore i make a friend\nthere's no like\ncertain there's not like you you don't\neven know what to expect\nso what do you do about this like what\nyou know if you're someone who tries\nreally hard to make friends\ndoes what people tell you to do\nand it's not working\nand then you feel frustrated so it's\nokay to vent right\nbut then like venting only gets you so\nfar\nlike it doesn't actually fix the problem\nright\nso what do you do about it\nso\ni'm going to close off today with sort\nof a different perspective\nso we could talk about for example how a\nlack of confidence\nyou know\nimpacts your social relationships\nwe could talk about you know how for\nexample if you feel\nlike a relationship isn't\nif you are contributing\nmore than your fair share to a\nrelationship and you're kind of like\nkeeping it\non life support essentially like how\nthose perceptions actually can\nnegatively impact the relationship we\ncan talk about all that stuff we even\nlooked at research earlier today about\nhow the thing that correlates with the\nmost relationship satisfaction is your\npersonal view of the relationship\nand so if you feel like your\nrelationship your friendship is on life\nsupport that's going to negatively\nimpact the relationship so we could talk\nabout all that scientific stuff\nbut what i'd like to do is actually\nshare with y'all how to rip it out root\nin stem\nif you want to just like completely rip\nthis problem out by root in stem\nlike just\nsolvent not saying it's easy but this is\nhonestly how it works\nso it comes down to like what the hell\nis happening in your mind\nlike\nthis is it's such a\nsimple concept and revolutionary concept\nbut is so hard to grasp because like it\nis not how our society functions\nso the first thing to understand is\nfriendless\nis a state almost of reality right like\nit's like it's like you don't have\npeople in your life\nunlovable\nis not reality\nunlovable is created by the mind\nso what happens\nis we look at the world which is a\nparticular way and we make certain\ninferences with our mind\nbut all of the thoughts that you have\nthe feeling of being tired\nanxiety feeling unlovable\nyour frustration\nthese things are not real\nare they justified sure but they're not\nreal things\nthey're just fluctuations of the mind\nso patanjali who's sort of like the\nseminal teacher of yoga\nsays that yoga is the cessation of the\nfluctuations of mind\nthe mind has fluctuations feeling\nunlovable is not a thing\nit's not a reality it's a feeling\nright so it may feel real to you but and\nthat's the really tricky thing is that\nwe assume that reality\nis what our mind perceives it to be but\nalmost by definition what our mind\nperceives is not reality that's just a\nperception\nlike if i think that i have two million\ndollars does it mean that i have two\nmillion dollars obviously not\nso the funny thing is that our sense\nwe use our mind\nto make interpretations about reality\nand the reason we do that is like it's\nit's evolutionary\nbecause we need some instrument to make\nsense of and direct us in the outside\nworld\nthe problem is at some point we forget\nthat it's just in our mind\nlike we start to believe that reality is\nwhat we think it is\nright so like if for example\ni feel stood up\nby someone who was gonna be on a date so\nlike i go to the restaurant today's\nfriday i show up at seven o'clock and\nthey don't show up and i get pissed off\nbecause i feel stood up i'm stood up\nthis person stood me up\nright so i get angry with them i'm like\nman everyone's mean crap like that but\nlike what i didn't realize is that i got\nthe date wrong\nmaybe it was supposed to be next friday\nright but like\ni don't\nthat's not something that i acknowledge\nand if someone points it out to me maybe\ni'll even argue against it\nbecause that happens\nthe point is that like my perception of\nthings and what my mind produces is\nsomething that we accept\n100\nso the cessation of fluctuations of the\nmind is what leads to peace of the mind\nwhat is a fluctuation it means it means\nfeeling unlovable all emotions are\nfluctuations of the mind\neven thoughts are fluctuations of the\nmind\nbecause you have a thought one moment\nyou don't have a thought the next moment\nso if you want to be free from all of\nthis stuff even the tiredness it's not\nlike a physical thing it feels physical\nyou're spiritually exhausted\nin looking for friends\nyou try so hard and it doesn't work so\nyou're like ex you're tired of trying\nbut every day when you wake up you have\nenergy right so you're like your your\nglycogen stores are full\nyour oxygen saturation is 99\nyour heart rate is like 78 beats per\nminute\nthe physical capability of your body is\nroughly the same sure there are some\nhormonal influences there's some psycho\nimmunology access and stuff like that so\nare some fluctuations maybe there's a\nlittle bit of vitamin d deficiency and\nlike whatnot there's some like you know\nphysiologic caveats to this sort of\nthing we're not saying it's all in your\nhead\nbut generally speaking from day to day\nwhat your body is capable of and the\namount of energy you can produce is like\npretty similar unless you've got a\nthyroid deficiency or whatever\nbut that's not the way that we see it\nand this is something that someone\nactually linked i think alan uh someone\nlinked post made a post on\nour subreddit that was linking to an\nalan watts video which i think he does a\nvery good job of sort of describing this\nso we'll sort of share that at the end\nabout how\nreality in our mind are like two\nfundamentally different things and such\na big source of our suffering\nis because we conflate these two things\nso what is this person's problem they\nfeel unloved\nwhy do they feel unloved because of the\nway that people treat them\nmakes sense right you're treated in a\nway that feels like it's disrespectful\nso you result in feeling unloved\nbut the thing is that's just your\ninterpretation of it\nright like\nthat's just your interpretation it's a\nfeeling it's not actually a reality\nso if you think about what is real\nwhat is real is the now the mind by\ndefinition is not real imagination is\nnot real mind is what does imagination\nmind thinks through hypotheticals mind\nlooks into the future\nif you think about anxiety oh i'm i'm\ntexting this person i'm anxious about\nwhat they're gonna say that by nature\nyou can't be anxious about something\nthat happened you can only be anxious\nabout things that haven't happened\nit's the nature of anxiety\nanxiety is like by definition that which\nis not real\nand we get so caught up in it that we're\nlike we stop living in reality and we\nstart living in our own heads\nanother good example of this is like\ncovent injections or how bill gates is\ngoing to inject 5g it's going to turn me\ninto a 5g provider\nlike what on earth\nwhere are people getting this\nright like you people can believe all\nkinds of things\nbut it's just a belief the nature of a\nbelief is that it isn't true\nthe mind produces beliefs not\ntruths now micro jmac is saying nothing\nis actually real disagree there is\nabsolutely something that is real my\npoint is that the mind is not real\nif i think i can fly does that mean i\ncan fly no\nof course not\nif i think i am unlovable does it mean i\nam unlovable\nhold on a second because\nactually the answer is no of course not\nbut we operate as if it is\nso if you want to rip this problem out\nroot and stem you want to get rid of\nyour anxiety you want to get rid of your\nfeeling of being unloved you want to get\nrid of all this stuff\nyou have to divorce yourself from your\nmind you have to recognize that there is\na gap between reality and your mind and\nhow do you do that with experience\ni don't mean like experiences and you\nhave to practice i mean you do have to\npractice but what i mean is what is real\nis experience\nright so i can actually fly if i get on\nan airplane i can be flying\nif i get on a hang glide or whatever i\ncan fly i can be in the ocean i can be\nsitting here i can breathe i can eat\nsomething i can sit with another human\nbeing\ni can notice my pulse\nwhat exists is what i experience\nnot what i think\nand this is the other really confusing\nthing is we have started to use thought\nas a substitute for experience we think\nthat these two things are the same thing\nbut no they're not they're like they\ncouldn't be further from the truth\nexperience is that which is\nthinking is like just thinking\nit's not what is that's why it's a\nthought because it's not a reality\nright does that like make sense on a\nvery fundamental level like these things\ncould not be further from the truth\nor further from each other\nso this core concept is what patanjali\nand alan watts these people have been\nsaying this for like thousands of years\nis that we get our mind confused with\nreality\noh i think my partner is cheating on me\ndoes it mean that they're cheating on me\nno\nwe even have in psychiatry delusional\ndisorders\ni once had a patient who believed that\nandre the giant was stalking them\ndude has been dead for a while\nyour thought can your mind can produce\nall kinds of things doesn't mean it's\ntrue\nso how do we ground ourselves\nin reality how do we understand what is\nactually true\nhow do we be free of being unlovable\nor feeling unlovable as\nsubtle because you're not\nit's not being unlovable it's feeling\nunlovable\nand if you think about the nature of\nemotions they fluctuate right i've said\nthis a couple times recently i'll say it\nagain\neveryone wants the perfect wedding\nhow long does the happiness from the\nperfect wedding last\ndoes it last for the rest of your life\nno in fact quite the opposite\nwhat i tend to see\nis that people who are more bent like\nhell-bent on creating the perfect\nwedding are the ones who are the least\nhappy in their marriage\nbut we tie so much importance to it i\nneed my perfect day this is gonna be the\none perfect day for the rest of my life\nand it needs to be perfect perfect\nperfect perfect perfect\nand in chasing after the perfect wedding\nwhat you actually do is damage your\nrelationships you actually set yourself\nup for\neverything from divorce\nto like no longer being friends with\npeople disinviting people\nall kinds of crap comes from that\nand it's all produced here what is a\nperfect wedding what does that even mean\nperfect is a conception of the mind\nand you're chasing over something that\nis not achievable it is not reality\nand no wonder\nit leads to problems\nwhen our mind\nchases after things that are not\ngrounded in reality suffering is the\nresult\nthis is why patanjali said yoga chitta\nruth\nstop the fluctuations of mind and you\nwill be at peace\nso how do you stop the fluctuations of\nmind you ground yourself in experience\nso this is going to be our meditation\nfor today\nthis is a meditation for if you feel\nunlovable how to rip this out root in\nstem\nso sit up straight\nyou can close your eyes i'm going to\nkeep mine open\nthe next time you feel unlovable\nclose your eyes and\nnotice the thoughts\nand the feelings\nand all of the\nfruits and flowers and leaves of being\nunlovable\nyou'll have this thought you'll have\nthat thought no one likes me this person\ndidn't text me back you can have all\nthis crap floating around\nand then what i want you to do is see\nwhich of that is real what is the actual\nexperience\nof feeling unlovable\nis it being unlovable and look within\nyourself\nso the first thing is that if it's a\nthought it's not a real thing we've\nalready established that\nit doesn't mean that thoughts don't have\nimportance or don't have impact\nor don't have value there's a reason we\nhave thoughts but they aren't real\nright the letter a is not a real thing\nit's a symbol that has heuristic value\nthere's no reason that we drive on the\nright side of the road as opposed to the\nleft side of the road or vice versa\ndepending on what country you're in\nthere's value to conventions because\nhuman beings can interact with each\nother\nso something that doesn't have to be\ngrounded in reality necessarily to be\nuseful there's nothing special about the\nright side of the road\nit's just the only reason that helps is\nif everyone does it\nright because then people going in\nopposite directions don't bump into each\nother\nso if it's a thought it's not reality so\nfind out what look within yourself close\nyour eyes and tunnel down as deep as you\ncan into what is this feeling of\nunlovability there may be thoughts\nthey're just thoughts they can come and\ngo\ni can think about pink unicorns i can\nthink about\nharry potter book number nine if i want\nto i can imagine all kinds of stuff\nit's not real\nchances are it'll be a feeling like a\nphysical sensation so even then what is\na feeling is it an emotion what is an\nemotion\nit's going to be something there's going\nto be some kind of physical correlate\nchances are you'll feel the tightness in\nyour throat you'll feel a tightness in\nyour chest you'll feel maybe a\nqueasiness in your stomach\nis that being unlovable\nof course not\njust notice that\nall that is actually real\nis i have a tightness in my throat\nthat's all that's real i'm sitting here\ni'm breathing\ni'm in this room\nthere's a slight sound outside\nthis is what's real this is what is you\ncan touch it you can feel it it is real\nit's not an imagination this is what is\nwhat is is i have a tightness in my\nthroat\nis a tightness in my throat unlovability\nof course not\nand if you do this practice if you go to\nthe source of your unlovability\nwhat you'll find is it's a mirage\nit's just like an oasis in the desert\nthe closer that you get to it the closer\nthat you get to it the more that it\ndisappears the more that disappears the\nmore that it disappears it's fruits and\nflowers and leaves\nthat barely have a trunk and have no\nroots\nit's like the value of cryptocurrency\nlooks amazing\nnothing there under the surface\ntriggered\nyeah so\nwhat sumi is saying or any currency\nreally exactly well said so it's like\nfiat currency there's no value\nwhat is the value in a dollar\nit's because we all think it has value\nright it's kind of like what tyrion\nlannister says\nabout power\nthe king only has power because everyone\nthinks he's got power\nright\nand so so many of our societal\nconstructions are based off of things\nthat are not real\nthey're\nconstructions and as you sit and you\nnotice and this is where like if you're\nfeeling unlovable i encourage you to sit\nand find the origin of it and then what\ni'd say is go out and touch grass\nsomeone's\nmowing lawn right now it's perfect\ngo out and smell grass\nthis is what's real this is what is\nthe other thing that i'll give you all\nis as you start to notice what is\nyou'll start to realize that the feeling\nof a tightness in your throat or your\nthought this is in your body and this is\nin your mind\nbut what is the thing\nthat sees both of those things\nso as you notice the tightness in your\nthroat\nthere will be a separation\nthe tightness of the throat becomes the\nobject\nof observation\nand you are observing it\nwhen i get caught up in my own thoughts\ni don't realize that they're just\nthoughts they feel like reality as i\nseparate from them and as i observe my\nthoughts\nwhat is the thing doing the observing\nthis is the thing that some people call\nthe observing self\nthis is what some people call the soul\nand then ask yourself this question does\nthe part of me that notices the pain\ndoes the part of me that notices the\npain feel the pain\nis it aware that there is pain within me\nor does it itself hurt\nthis is something you have to practice\nday after day after day after day\nevery time you feel unlovable start with\nthe first part of this and go as far as\nyou can\nand if you're lucky\nyou will discover what patanjali\ndiscovered you will discover what alan\nwatts discovered you will discover what\neven i discovered\nand you will even discover what people\nin this community discovered you will\ndiscover what all the people who were\nreligious meditators\ndiscovered which is holy crap none of\nit's real\nwhy on earth am i freaking out about\nthis stuff\nand once you do that you'll be able to\nbro nod\nright so like even now every time i bro\nnod i feel a little bit weird but it's\nlike lol so what\ni can even take that feel of the anxiety\nand i can just like appreciate it's like\nthere it is again\nand it's it's kind of weird but it's\neven like things in life that you used\nto not enjoy you can even start to enjoy\nyou can even appreciate wow i'm like so\nnervous i've been nervous in a long time\nhello my old friend\ni hope i'm able to handle it\notherwise i'll start to stutter and if\nit's a wreck like if i if i screw up the\nspeech well gg\nget wrecked noob\nthat can even be funny\nit's bizarre\nand so this is what patanjali discovered\nthis is what alan watts discovered this\nis what i discovered at some point what\nsome of you all discovered and even\nevery single one of you who who's\nenjoyed watching a sad movie or\nlistening to a sad song or reading a sad\nbook\nis that even the negative emotions that\nwe try to retreat from so much in life\ncan be enjoyable\nyou"
