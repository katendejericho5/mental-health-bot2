    "transcript": "just get rid of it right just have a\npositive mind and it doesn't work for\nyou then you despair even further so\nwhat on earth is going on and like how\ndo we get out of this so i don't have a\nlife\nwarning this text probably this text\nprobably the most pathetic thing you've\never read i'm a 24 year old woman i'm a\nhigh school dropout i don't have a job i\ndon't have any friends i've i never had\na relationship and all that loneliness\nis indescribable i've always felt out of\nplace and i've always been a weird kid\ni wasn't the brightest in the school i\nused to skip school for months i just\nwanted waited until my parents went to\nwork and then came back home and spent\ntime in my room\ni basically wasted all my life being\nisolated stuck inside my room due to my\ndepression and severe social anxiety and\ni was just indifferent about my future\nalthough i did have some plans or\nwhatever but that was stupid\ni don't have good memories i have never\nhad some\namazing adventures with my friends i\nwasn't happy and i'm unhappy now all i\ndo every day is just scroll the internet\nor watch dumb videos\nnothing happens in my life i tried to\nfind a job but i usually just just\nchicken out and go back to my room\ntrying to escape sheer anxiety my family\nis so upset with me\ni don't even want to start with this one\ni don't see a future my for myself i did\ngo to a therapist she gave me\nantidepressants and told me to find a\njob but i'm still rotting in my room\ni don't know what's wrong with me it's\nnot a life i feel so hopeless and\ndefeated i don't think i'll ever catch\nup on life and the most painful thing is\nthat i'm actually a fun person and there\nare things i'd love to do\ni want to see places i want to travel i\nwant to have a healthy social life i\nwant to have a life but i simply can't\ncan't do even a small step\nso sometimes we find ourselves in a\nsituation where we're\nin our twenties\nand we've got nothing\ngoing for us\nhigh school dropout didn't even finish\nschool don't have a job don't have\nfriends never had a relationship so\nromance isn't working well\nprofessions isn't going well academics\naren't going well\nand furthermore our health isn't good\nright because there's like crippling\ndepression and anxiety like really bad\nanxiety\nand so we find ourselves in this\nsituation where like\nnothing's going our way\nthere's like literally not a single\npoint\nof light in our life\nand we're 24 we realize this and like we\ndon't even know like where to start like\nwhere do you even start in this kind of\nsituation\nand this is what's like especially\ncrippling about this is that\nif we look at this what's the tone\nright like who does who do you think\nthis person blames\nwho is to blame here\ni simply can't do one step\nwe feel defeated\nand the challenge here is that\nsometimes\nwhen we're in this situation like we\nhave depression anxiety the internet or\npeople will tell us like myself included\ngo get therapy right so we'll say like\noh like this is a problem like what's\nthe diagnosis here you're depressed\noh right so you're like you do\ndepression anxiety okay great go go to\ntherapy\nand then we do that and you get\nantidepressants and you're told to find\na job and then you're still rotting in\nyour room\nso like the challenge here is that when\nyou're faced with the situation like\nthere are some things that are supposed\nto be the right answer\nand what on earth do you do if you do\nthe right answer\nand it still doesn't work\nlike then what then the real\nhopelessness sets in right then it's\nlike then i want you all to think about\nwhat effect this has on the mind\nif someone tells you oh look this is the\nright answer like you need to get go see\na therapist and find medication you go\ngo to a therapist you find medication\nyou do the right thing and it still\ndoesn't work\nwho's to blame\neven even more you\nright because this works for so many\npeople therapy and antidepressants help\npeople who are depressed but they don't\nhelp me\nso now you're like sol\nright\nlike now it's like now you're busted on\nsuch a fundamental level that even like\nmedical professionals aren't able to\nhelp you\nand so when you're faced in this\nsituation you're kind of screwed like\nyou don't even like you don't know where\nto start you don't know how to make\nfriends you don't have social skills you\ndon't know how to like put together a\nresume like you haven't even finished\nschool and like and then what's really\npainful about this is that despite the\nfact that you're struggling with all\nthis stuff you still want what life has\nto offer\nright like you recognize that life is\nsupposed to be more than this\nyou want to have a healthy social life\nyou want to have a relationship you want\nto travel you want to do fun things you\nwant to do more than just spend all day\non the internet\nbut where on earth do you even start\nand it can feel so overwhelming\nlike it's a problem it's a really\nchallenging problem to solve but if\nyou're going to therapy and you're\ngetting antidepressants anyway and\nyou're still stuck then it really feels\nbad\nso this is where like if we really want\nto understand this\nwe've got to kind of start by kind of\nstart at the top\nso the first thing we're going to share\na little bit of research okay\nfirst thing to understand is that\nif you are defeated in your mind\nthe chances of success are going to be\nvery low\nright so like basically like it's been\nmy experience that\nyou fail when you give up\nthat's the most important\nvariable in terms of whether you succeed\nor you fail now what does success mean\nwhat does failure mean like that's a\nwhole separate philosophical question\nbut in essence if you give up then it's\nvery hard to win\nnow the challenge is that\ntelling you that doesn't actually fix\nanything right\nactually if you pay attention what\nhappens is you blame yourself even more\nbecause oh all i have to do is hope\nand if i could hope then i would be\nsuccessful but busted me i can't even\nhope\nmy despair is so bad like i can't even\nhope i can't be motivated i can't stay\npositive like because my i'm so busted i\ncan't even do that right so like do you\nsee how like no matter what we say like\nyou're always gonna be the problem\nlike it's always gonna be a deficiency\nin you that's what your mind is gonna\ntell you that's what we have to get rid\nof now if i tell you have to get rid of\nit\nthen you can't get rid of just get rid\nof it right just have a positive mindset\nand it doesn't work for you then you\ndespair even further so what on earth is\ngoing on and like how do we get out of\nthis you'll see this it's like a really\ntricky thing that the mind does\nso let's understand a couple of things\nso i'm going to ask you all a question\nwho what\nwhat has to happen for a child to drop\nout of high school\nright\nlike think look at this i just waited\nuntil my parents i used to skip school\nfor months\nwhat has to be possible for a child to\nskip\nskip school\nno bullying bullying doesn't work\nbullying is not what allows a child to\ndrop out\nlack of support\nright so like i don't know i mean like i\nwas i don't know if this applies to\ny'all i don't know it depends on your\nupbringing but this should tell you the\ndifference there's no way that i would\nhave been able to drop out there's no\nfreaking way that my parents would have\nallowed me to drop out of school\nso the first thing to understand is that\nif you're going nowhere in life\nyou've got to start by distributing the\nresponsibility and really attributing\nstuff to where it belongs so i'm going\nto give you guys just a simple example\nof this if i accept all of the blame for\neverything in my life on me\nlet's acknowledge for a moment that like\nthere's got to be some stuff that i\ncan't control right\nbut when i accept responsibility for\nthat i'm accepting responsibility for\nsomething that i have no control over\ntherefore i'm doomed to failure\nlike\nyou know if i if i accept responsibility\nfor the fact that\nthere's only one moon in the sky\ni'm setting myself up for despair and\nfailure because i'm fundamentally the\nthings in your life that you can control\nand things in your life that you can't\ncontrol and the first thing to\nunderstand if you are in a despairing\nmindset is actually like\ncorrectly attributing\nwhere the blame goes\nbecause then what happens instead of\nblaming yourself for everything you can\nonly you're only going to blame yourself\nfor what you're truly responsible for\nso this is a kind of situation where if\nyou're abusive to yourself you have to\nlearn like self-love\nand what's the first step of learning\nself-love the first step of learning\nself-love is like acknowledging that\nother people may have had a hand in this\ntoo because if you're beating yourself\nif you're snatching away\nall of the mistakes of other people and\ntaking them no no it's all me it's all\nme it's all me it's all me\nmy parents aren't responsible at all\nif you're snatching away all of that\nresponsibility it's gonna take your it's\ngonna like elevate your despair right\nbecause then you've screwed up your life\nin so many different dimensions\nso the first thing to recognize is that\nyou know if you skipped school for\nmonths like\nhow did your parents let you do that\nif you dropped out of high school like\nyou can't drop out of high school\nwithout your parents being okay with it\nin some way\nand that's just the start of it\nsecond thing to consider is like how\nmany friends did you have growing up\nwhat did your parents teach you about\nmeeting new people and making new\nfriends\ndid they teach you\nhow to make friends\ndid they demonstrate how to make friends\ndid you all go and socialize as a family\nwith other people and meet new families\ndid you meet new kids\nright so you look at the rest of the\nworld and you look at all the people who\nare the haves and you're a have not and\ni think what we don't realize we we\nattribute these things to like\nmotivation\nbut the truth of the matter is like how\ndoes a human being learn anything\nit's through like observation even the\nlanguage that i'm using how did you\nlearn to speak english\nlike you didn't try like people around\nyou just started speaking english well\nmaybe english is your second language\nbecause we have a large international\naudience but take your language of\nchoice right spanish\ndutch whatever\nand so like we just learned this kind of\nstuff and this is the thing that we\ndon't that a lot of people don't realize\nis like social skills\neven things like discipline\nwaking up on time showering every day\nand things like that we're like\nwe're taught\nright this kind of behavior is modeled\nfor us it's part of the reason why\nreligion is so like inherited right so\nlike if you grow up in a particular\nregion religion\nif you have you know if you're of your\nentire social circle or southern\nbaptists and you grow up in that\nhousehold you don't have a random chance\nto end up as any religion\nit's not like the all random mode in a\nvideo game like you're going to grow up\nsouthern baptists a decent chance\nright you're not going to grow up baha'i\nso this is where the first thing that\nyou've got to realize is that a lot of\nthe things that you struggle with are\nthings that people are explicitly\ntaught or modeled one of one of those\ntwo things so were you\nwas there good modeling about forming\nnew relationships\ndid your parents expose you\nto new social situations and new people\ndid you go to parties with people that\nyou didn't know did you go to barbecues\ndid you go to picnics did you go to\nchurch events did you go to these things\nwhere you met new kinds of people\ndid they show you did your dad or mom\nyou know meet\npeople and then like because i remember\nlike this happened for me right so we\nused to travel a lot growing up and i\nsaw my dad make small talk with people\nhe would make small talk with randos\nright and i would feel super awkward and\nhe'd be like this is my son\ni'd say hi i'd feel super awkward but i\nsaw him do it over and over and over\nagain and then sometimes the parent the\nperson that they would i would talk to\nyou would interact with me\nso there's all kinds of stuff that\nwe're supposed to be taught like how do\nyou put together a resume how do you\napply for a job like you know even think\nabout your own parents and did your\nparents were they sort of professionally\nmotivated\ndid they like go through a series of\nnegotiations when they got a job offer\nhow many jobs did they consider how\noften did they move jobs\nwhat were you taught was it intrinsic in\nyour household that if a job is not good\nyou should go search for something\nbetter\nthere are all kinds of things that we\nare instilled with\nand this is why you get sort of like you\nknow i went to medical school i want to\nsay 20 or higher 30 40\nof my class in medical school had at\nleast one parent who was a doctor\ndo you think we're genetically better at\nmedicine of course not\nthere's no such thing\nit's all upbringing\nso the first thing that you've got to do\nis acknowledge that all this isn't your\nfault\nnot all of it like are you responsible\nfor some of it sure\nbut especially like if you're if you\nwere six years old and you didn't have\nany friends that has nothing to do with\nyou that has everything to do with your\ncircumstances\nevery year that goes by you take a\nlittle bit more responsibility and a\nlittle bit more responsibility but even\nthen the people who have a vivid social\nlife at the age of 24 were the ones who\nwere taught how to socialize and modeled\nsocialization\nright so if you weren't taught those\nthings it's like you're blaming yourself\nfor not speaking english and you grew up\nin like\nyou know india where\nthere's sri lanka where there's like no\none speaking english and then you're\nbeating yourself up for not speaking\nenglish\nthe problem is that we don't really like\nthink about this right so especially\nwhen depression starts to kick in it it\ninflates\nself-blame\nso like what does this do so the first\nthing is that if you can actually go\nthrough this and acknowledge this for\nyourself\nit's gonna change the way that you talk\nto yourself\nand this is where there's like one or\ntwo like things that i kind of want to\npoint out to y'all but\nmy family is so upset with me\nso i don't even want to start with this\none\nso this is the kind of thing where\nsometimes we have to be super careful\nbecause our family will teach us\nour self-talk\nwhere do we get our self-talk we get it\nfrom the way that we're talked to\nso if your family blames you for this\nsituation if your family is like you\nneed it just fix it just fix it just fix\nit just fix it without how can we help\nyou know that's very very dangerous\nso what you've got to essentially do is\nstart by acknowledging that all of this\nisn't your fault\nis some of it your fault absolutely\nbut if you weren't taught how to make\nfriends if you were allowed to drop out\nof high school\nthat in turn like going to high school\nis where you start to self-regulate in\nterms of sleep going to sleep on time\nmaking your assignments get done by a\nparticular time you know like it's where\nyou learn how to be an efficient\nprocrastinator you learn all these\nthings you're forced to learn these\nthings through high school and if you\ndon't have that opportunity like your\nyour brain just isn't put\nthrough that exercise regimen and you're\nnot going to learn some of these\nfundamental skills\nbecause like the whole point of high\nschool is they force you to do it\nbook reports aren't optional you got it\nthe book report is due on friday you got\nto do it you start on thursday at 2 pm\nsure you read through the book you get\nthe cliff notes and then you start\nwriting it at 10 pm and then you finish\nat 2 a.m and you turn it in the next day\nthat's how you learn how to do like the\nyou know a decent minimal kind of job\nthat's a very important skill at life\nright is being able to do good enough\nand if you are deprived of these\nopportunities\nif there wasn't enough parental\nstructure and support for you to go to\nschool then like\nyou know you're not going to learn this\nstuff\nit's not like we're you know if you\nthink about human beings like human\nbeings aren't born with the instinct of\nproductivity\nlike animals are born with the ability\nto like instinctually swim and run and\nstuff like that like you know you\ngive birth to an impala on the serengeti\nand then paula knows how to run it's\nlike out of the womb for 30 seconds and\nit's running\nhuman beings we're not taught like we\nhave to be taught this stuff like\na six month old isn't capable of\nanything it can't put together a\nschedule it doesn't know how to go to\nwork on time it doesn't know like how to\nset healthy technology like think about\nit it's completely it can't even feed\nitself\nand so the whole point is that all this\ncrap that we assume is intrinsic about\nhuman beings is not actually intrinsic\nit's taught\nonce you realize that\nyou don't deserve quite as much blame as\nyou give yourself\nthat's a really important piece\nand once you realize that\nthat sure some of this is my fault but a\nlot of it isn't\nthen your self-talk can change\nright did i do a bad job yes\nbut let's be honest i kind of did okay\nbut i was dealt a crappy hand of cards\nin life\nonce you're able to say that to yourself\nthat's where\nforgiveness comes in\nthe ability to forgive yourself\nand once you start to forgive yourself\nonce you start to cut yourself some\nslack\nand once you start to put less pressure\non yourself then a lot of things can\nchange\nand this is where i want to just show\nyou all kind of flash to another post\nreal quick\ndr k what exactly\nexactly what actions do i take to change\nmy life\nand this is where\nwe get caught up in the actions\nright i would like to change the\nfollowing not having friends not being\nindependent staying shy not having\nfreedom being in the house etc etc\nnot having much power oh my parents\nbeing controlling\nwhat exactly what actions do i take to\nchange these most people would say just\nget a hobby or go out but what if i'm\nterrified of it\nthis is the key thing\nlogically i know it won't be that\nterrifying but i just can't do it\nthe problem here is not what actions you\ntake the problem here is the mind that\ntakes the actions\nso when you look at your life and\nnothing is going well\nyou don't have friends you don't have a\njob you just dropped out of high school\nyou've never been in a relationship\nfixing each and every one of these\nproblems is absolutely overwhelming you\nget into like how are you supposed to\ncatch up\ncan't\nso what do you actually do about it what\nyou've got to do is change your mind\nchange your thinking\nhow do you change your thinking that's\nwhat we just walked through\nso oddly enough the first step\nis blame\nso\ndepression is anger turned against the\nself\nthat's a very old i think freudian\nconception of depression\nall of your anger is directed\nyou pull it away from your parents and\nyou will all point it in here\nso now\nwhat you first thing that you've got to\ndo is like\naccountability needs to be like more\nevenly spread\nbecause you're not responsible for\neverything like it's crazy like you\ncan't be responsible for everything in\nyour life dropping out of high school\nonly happens with parental support\nthey have to allow it\nbeing able to skip school for months\nlike what there was never a parent\nteacher conference they didn't see your\ngrades they didn't like realize they\nnever asked you how's your homework\ngoing\nyou know their parents have to be and\nthat too may not necessarily have been\ntheir fault\nin the sense that if they had to work or\nhad other kinds of problems or had\nhealth issues or whatever like we're not\nnecessarily blaming them for them we're\nnot blaming in terms of like ah you did\nthis to me so we're not sort of saying\nyou need to be resentful and angry and\nstuff like that we just need to\nacknowledge that sometimes like crap\nhappens in life and that's because\nthere's a confluence events where\nsomething kind of slips through the\ncracks\nand if your parents were too busy to do\nthis stuff or if they were never taught\nhow to do this stuff and they had to\nkind of model through and struggle and\nstuff like that that's actually all okay\ntoo but it ain't your fault\nso the first thing isn't is a\ndistribution of responsibility\nacknowledging that not everything in\nyour life is actually your fault\nand once you start to do that you can\nstart to change a little bit of your\ndespair you can change the way that you\nthink you can change the way that you\ntalk to yourself and about yourself\nbecause then if you were never taught\nsocial skills suddenly if you go out and\nyou try to socialize and you literally\ndon't know what to say\nit's not because you're stupid it's\nbecause like hey oh you don't know how\nto play the game of socialization\nmaybe that's because you never had the\ntutorial\nit's like like some of us are playing\nlife as if we're playing the elden ring\nenemy randomizer and we've never played\na video game in our life like no there's\nno tutorial\nwe're just dropped in\nbecause remember that life is more like\nthe enemy randomizer like it's not\ncrafted for us to do level one and then\nlevel two and level three love it's not\ncrafted for us to succeed like a video\ngame it's just rng\nand sometimes like the first person that\nyou date is a level 100 narcissist it's\nnot like life gives you the level one\nnarcissist first so that you learn how\nto deal with them and then level two and\nthen the level three and then the level\nfour and the level five and then\neventually you can deal with the level\n100 narcissists that's not how it works\nit's like rng\nso you've got to like cut yourself some\nslack\nacknowledge that if you struggle is\nthere more you can do a hundred percent\nbut were you taught how to socialize\nas you had social difficulties\nor when you dropped out of high school\ndid your parents ever come and talk to\nyou about it and be like hey now that\nyou've dropped out of high school we\nshould probably do something to make\nsure you get your social activity\nand you can continue to make friends\nright so i see this with parents who\nhomeschool\nwhere they'll like\nintentionally and actively\nenroll their kids in extracurricular\nactivities because they acknowledge if\nthey homeschool they're not going to get\nany social development\nso we've got to make sure we do that\nas you start to change the way that you\nthink about yourself in the way that you\ntalk to yourself mistakes will be less\ndevastating and the future will be more\nbright you'll be able to do more things\nthe last thing is that i do think that\ntherapy and medication can have a good\nrole here that's where we also don't\nknow how long this person is on\nmedication but just a reminder\na couple things about medication the\nfirst is that antidepressants tend to\ntake about eight weeks to become\neffective\nso if you started the medication a week\nago it's not going to do anything yet\nthat's the amount of time that it takes\nto become effective eight weeks\nso for two months not going to see a\nwhole lot potentially some people it\nhappens earlier some people you'll get\nbenefits within two weeks or one month\nbut give it at least eight weeks\nsecond thing to consider is that if you\nare in a depressive episode if you\nactually have a clinical diagnosis of\nmajor depressive disorder bipolar\ndisorder some kind of other mood\ndisorder that these things are generally\nspeaking temporary\nso we know that depressive episodes\ngenerally speaking last from anywhere\nfrom a few weeks to a month\nto about one year\nand so as long as you stay on medication\nhopefully it'll reduce the frequency and\nseverity of those episodes\nnext thing is if your therapist says\nhere's a medication go find a job gg go\nand they're not supporting you in that\nprocess you should probably find a\ndifferent therapist and that's where\nmost therapists don't prescribe\nmedication so i don't know exactly what\nyou mean by therapists\nso that's where like give yourself a\nlittle bit of slack give yourself time\nfor the medication to work by the way\nall this stuff is in dr k's guide to\ndepression where we explain some of\nthese core concepts and how\npsychotherapy works and how medication\nworks and some of these things like that\nso the other thing you should absolutely\ndo is educate yourself\nbut at the end of the day\nif every dimension of your life seems to\nbe falling apart\nthe most important thing is not to fix\nthis thing over here this thing over\nhere this thing over here and this thing\nover here it's actually to fix the\ncommon element which is here\nit's to fix the tool with which you play\nthe game of life\nand fixing the tool starts with a very\nvery subtle thing\nof distributing responsibility\nbecause chances are if you're going\nnowhere in life at the age of 24\nyou weren't taught how to go somewhere\nand this kind of cognitive reframing and\nthis is also why we started career\ncoaching by the way because we realize\nthat there's all kinds of skills\nthere's a connection\nbetween emotions\nbehavior\nself-understanding and self-judgment\nand even like a certain how-to\nso if you look at our coaching program\nour coaching program is actually\ndesigned to address these kinds of\nissues so even in career coaching it's\nlike how do you put together a resume\nhow do you talk to your boss in general\ncoaching it's going to be like more\nabout okay let's understand the thought\npatterns of your mind let's understand\nhow the thought patterns of your mind\nwhere they come from and how they\ninterfere with what you do\nlet's also give you a space where if you\nneed to vent off negative emotional\nenergy you can do it in a healthy manner\nin a coaching\nsort of environment so that when you go\nfor your job interview like you're not\ncarrying those negative emotions around\nright so you could definitely do that in\ntherapy as well but therapy is going to\nbe more clinically focused and generally\nspeaking your therapist will say things\nlike it's important for you to find a\njob whereas they're not\nmost of us are not formally trained in\nlike helping people find jobs we're\nformally trained in diagnosis and\ntreatment\nright so that's why we have a career\ncoaching program because we hear this\nkind of crap entirely too much\ni went to therapy\nthey told me to find a job\nbut they didn't tell me how\nso that's where like at the end of the\nday you've got to challenge\nyour mindset you have to shape your\nmindset because that's the instrument\nthat you use for everything\nyour mind is going to be the thing that\ndetermines your social interactions\nwhether you apply for a job whether you\nget a ged all of that requires your mind\nso the mind is the first thing to fix\nquestions\nso pixi kate is saying so many\ntherapists are not qualified i swear\ni'd like to be a little bit more\noptimistic than that i think a lot of\ntherapists are operating in a system\nthat does not allow them to succeed\ni think a lot\na lot of the way that therapy is\ndelivered is i think not the fault of\nthe therapist we have a medical system\nthat overemphasizes particular problems\nwhich is entirely why coaching has\ncropped up\nwhy did the therapists were great at\nthis stuff there would there would have\nbeen no market for this bluntly\nbut over time what's happening is\ntherapy is becoming more protocolized\nit's becoming more generic and it's\nbecoming more medical legal\nyou have 45 minute appointments sorry i\nhave to see like six numbers six people\nto like\nmake my rvus and meet my productivity\nquota so i don't have\nan extra half hour for you i'm sorry\nthat the the insurance provider does not\npay\nfor a 75-minute appointment the most\nthey'll pay for is a 50-minute\nappointment and that's because there are\nall these studies that show that 50\nminute appointments are\neffective medical treatments for\ndepression so\nthat's not additional time i can give\nyou there's a lot of how therapists also\nthough some of them will assess for\nsuicidality on every visit with every\npatient\nright so i i'd like to\ncut my colleagues a little bit more\nslack and and sort of like i acknowledge\nthat\nyou know if they operate a particular\nway is it that they're under qualified\nor undertrained i don't think so i think\nthey're squeezed\njust like everyone else's\nyou"
