    "transcript": "the successful strategy is about\nfiguring out how can we capture those\nmoments of productivity and that's where\nsetting expectations is very very\nimportant\nso adhd slash second time being kicked\nout by partners to find motivation\nam i a magnet to these situations what\ncan i do\nmy ex kicked me out three separate times\nsaying i need to find my independence\nand often joked that i was mooching\nthere was quite an age gap i was 17 and\nthey were 25 but i was working full-time\nand contributing to the house and\ncleaning regularly he also mentioned he\nfelt he wasn't good enough for me he\nwould say he would also say to me if you\ndon't have anything good to say you\nshouldn't say it at all\nand maybe that had something to do with\nhow adhd gets me overwhelmed easily and\ncontributes to my depression\ni had a lot of difficulty putting my\nthoughts into words but with him it was\neasy because he would basically read my\nmind i liked how he truly understood the\ngreat ideas my adhd brain had\nhowever he kicked me out but still\nwanted to stay in a relationship with\nhim but i couldn't handle the back and\nforth of moving in and out with him so i\nset boundaries and eventually broke it\noff good for you\ni currently have a partner who i believe\nis more grounded and compassionate\nhowever they also want me to move out\nand stay in a relationship with them\nbecause they feel like it's it's what's\nbest for both of us\nthis time around i've practiced\nself-awareness and setting boundaries i\ndidn't have a job because we were going\nto renovate a house after moving\ntogether across the country he says that\nin eight months i haven't done enough\nrenovating or cleaning the house has\nvery little storage and i've been very\noverwhelmed adhd and too much of a\nperfectionist ocd\ni did not come up with the proper plan\nor get enough done\nhe's seen me renovate in the past to see\nme do great work he says he doesn't feel\nlike i'm the same person he also\nmentioned he doesn't like my tone when i\nask him simple questions and\nthinks i'm frustrated and passive\naggressive which i'm not but i still\nwant to try to use a better tone of\nvoice\nhe also told me if you don't have\nanything nice to say then don't say it\nat all\ni don't quite understand how this line\nhaunts me because i rarely speak without\nthinking anymore but at times i have\ndifficulty putting thoughts into words\nfor him and sometimes it comes out wrong\nbut that's another story i don't know if\nit's another story right that may be\nrelated\neven though i feel healthier with this\npartner i often feel like my great ideas\naren't well understood but but it's\nsomething i can live with\nthe trauma from being kicked out in my\nfirst relationship really stresses me\nnow i found a job already but i still\nneed to find a place to live out here\nalone with no family or support system\nin hopes that it'll help me and my\ncurrent partner the situation has\ntriggered my depression i can totally\nunderstand that right like\nmove to a new place\nliving on your own\nkind of move to this place presumably to\nbe with this person we will get couples\ncounseling and my hopes are that he will\nunderstand me better by the end of it i\nneed him to understand what he needs\nfrom me is causing me suffering and i\ndon't feel that adding on rent to my\nbills will help us but i do believe that\ncommunicating therapy and coming up with\na good plan to continue working on the\nhouse will help us both\nbut he disagrees and says it's too late\nfor me to keep working on the house and\nno matter what i do i definitely still\nneed to find a place to live for six\nmonths to one year or so i just can't\nhelp but wonder if i'm the magnet for\nthis kind of situation\ni don't understand how this is happening\nto me for the second time i feel like\ni've lost my trust in him as i can't\ncount on him anymore i'm already broke\nfrom having him drag me across the\ncountry and spending all my savings due\nto my poor trip planning is he right to\nkick me out does anyone know what i can\ndo to save this relationship\nso this is like super challenging okay\nlet's like try to understand what's\ngoing on here\nso the first thing\nis that adhd has an intersectional\nrelationship\nwith relationships\nso this is where we've got to take a\nstep back and really understand like\nwhat's going on here so like we think\nabout\nusing the medical model right we sort of\nthink about a disease as an isolated\nthing and that disease causes particular\nproblems and we sort of think about\ntreating that disease in isolation like\nif i'm adhd and i get on adhd treatment\nit's sort of fixed and i'm set\nthe problem with adhd is that it's very\nvery intersectional and dominating in\nterms of shaping our life\nso it's not just that this person has\nfor example\na difficulty with getting overwhelmed\neasily or maybe it's not easily maybe\nthey you know maybe they don't get\noverwhelmed easily it's like right\nrenovating a house is like not a small\nproject right\nthis person has moved across the country\nthey're like responsible for renovating\na house which is very very challenging\nin and of itself like even if if you\ndon't have adhd that's like a lot of\nwork\nand then as we're sort of working\nthrough this stuff like you've spent\neight months and and he feels like you\nhaven't done enough and so like is that\nthe adhd well then that intersects with\nthe relationship so what we tend to see\nwith a lot of people is that not only do\npeople with adhd sometimes struggle with\nprioritization and organization\nbut those struggles\nintersect with the relationship\nand so because like our partners have\nparticular expectations on us they may\nnot really be understanding what we\nstruggle with or may not kind of give us\nallowances for it then we run into\nrelationship problems and then what\nhappens is we have like communication\ndifficulties which is a big part of adhd\nas well\nso a lot of if you kind of think about\nit if you zone out in conversations for\nexample if you have difficulty like\nformulating your thoughts in a coherent\nway because they're all over the place\nthat then negatively impacts the\nrelationship so now what we've got is a\nsituation where there's a problem that\nneeds to be fixed\nin a relationship right maybe you're not\nrenovating as much as you have or you\nneed to or your partner wants to but\nthen generally speaking like what's our\nantidote to that that problem the\nproblem like it's one thing for adhd to\nkind of\nmake it difficult for us\nin terms of organizing our life\nprioritizing our life but then like on\ntop of that when that doesn't work out\nwe rely on things like communication to\nfix things right okay let's get on the\nsame page let's figure this out let's\nwork through it but if your\ncommunication is hampered and we sort of\nsee evidence of that right so people are\nmult multiple times they're complaining\nof like you know\ntone and stuff like that so we've had a\ncouple of partners who do that\nwe are also seeing that this person sort\nof struggles to get thoughts out of\ntheir head sometimes which is very\ncommon and so that negatively impacts\nthe relationship and then suddenly\nthe thing that was supposed to be an\nantidote our backup plan our safety net\nour parachute stops working not only\ndoes it stop working it adds additional\nweight and additional stress\nand then as we get into negative\nsituations right you kind of get then\nyou get kicked out you come back you get\nkicked out you come back you get kicked\nout you're like enough is enough then\nyou get traumatized by it so on top of\neverything that that's happened and we\nsort of understand this we'll go into\nmore detail\nthen you sort of like lose trust\nlike you know like like then it's the\ncycle starts repeating itself and you\nfeel like you're you're you know you're\na puppet whose strings are being pulled\nand then what you have to do is like\ndeal with sort of the the triggering and\ntrauma from all of the above so what\nhappens in adhd is that we get this like\nweird stacking effect\nright it's it's the first thing is that\nmy brain doesn't really like\norganize very easily or sometimes i bite\noff more than i can chew and this is the\nother thing about adhd is that there\nthere are times where you know you're\ncapable and we sort of see this in this\ncase as well\nwhere there are bursts of like\ncreativity and productivity that are\namazing\nwhy did you sign up to renovate the\nhouse why was your partner okay with you\nrenovating the house because they've\nseen what you're capable of\nand with the previous partner they were\nable to see the brilliance of what your\nbrain can put together\nso this is the challenge is that it's\nlike it's not all bad right they're like\nthese moments of brilliance moments of\nproductivity\nand then what we do is we start to build\na life expecting those kinds of moments\nand things don't really work out well\nbecause we don't really know how to\nfoster and create those moments\nand then the communication falls apart\nand then like\nlike you start to get traumatized a\nlittle bit because this has happened\nbefore we've been here before now what\ndo we do about it and so everything kind\nof stacks on top of you and you feel\nincredibly overwhelmed and then it's\nlike well okay which of these do i fix\nfirst do i figure out how to renovate\nthe house do i work on my communication\ndo i try to foster bursts of\nproductivity do i focus on like my ocd\nand perfectionism and remember that\npeople with adhd struggle with\nprioritization\nand so like then what happens is each of\nthese problems stacks up you get\noverwhelmed by the five different\nproblems that you have to solve\nand then like you don't know what to do\nand you kind of get paralyzed\nright you kind of like\npull into your shell and put your head\nyou know\nput your hood on you know we're gonna\nlike and then we're gonna like\ntry to just chill for a little bit\nright\nso\nwhat's going on here is is why does this\nkeep happening to this person\nand what can you do about it can you\nsave the relationship so this is where\nthe good news i know this sounds kind of\nweird but if you look at like these\nproblems we can look at this and we can\nsee five problems we can say okay\nthere's problems with organization\nproblems with prioritization problems\nwith communication\nproblems with like stuff kind of getting\ntriggered and being traumatized and like\nthe stress of all that sort of stuff and\nlike the problem of like okay which of\nthese problems do we tackle first\nso you can look at these things and you\ncan think that these are five\nindependent problems and if they're five\nindependent problems they have five\nindependent solutions and like you can\nkind of like work through them\nbut the good news and this is sort of\nwhat we understand from medicine is if\ni've got like a headache a stomach ache\nand a rash\nwhat's more likely that i've got one\nthing that's causing all three of these\nor i've got three separate illnesses\ni've got like migraines i've got crohn's\ndisease and i've got like eczema\nlike it's possible that it's all three\nbut it's much more likely that there's\nlike one problem and this is actually\nwhat we see in adhd and this is why\nthere's actually like a lot of hope here\nso the good news is that there's a\nfundamental problem which is creating\neach of these symptoms\nand how do we understand that\nokay so let's kind of go through that a\nlittle bit\nso\nthe biggest thing that i would say in a\nsituation like this and just as a caveat\neach of these has things that you can\nabsolutely do in adhd but i'd say the\nbiggest problem with all of these things\nis setting expectations\nit's like setting expectations is the\nbiggest thing setting expectations for\nyourself\nsetting expectations for your partner\nsort of like really understanding what\nthe deliverable is\nso i'll give you all an example so\nyou know when you say okay like all and\nthis is the thing is this is a skill\nthat you can learn so when you like move\nin with a partner what are the\nexpectations okay are you going to\ncontribute to rent\nare are you going to\nclean how often are you going to clean\nwhat are you going to clean when you\nmove across the country to be with\nsomeone what's the expectation is the\nexpectation financial support for this\namount of time this amount of time\nif you're renovating the house at what\npoint does like the house need to be\ndone\nwhat kind of progress are we talking\nabout in terms of communication like how\nare we communicating when are we\ncommunicating you know how do you have\nconversations with people\nand so the biggest thing that i tend to\nfind with people who have adhd is that\nthey don't set good expectations\nand this is kind of weird but like this\nis what happens right so if we think\nabout the mind of someone who has adhd\nwe've got like 10 different things that\nwe've got going on\nand i'll try to illustrate this because\ni think this is the best way to\nkind of do this so let's understand this\nokay because i think there's one thing\nthat you can do here that'll hopefully\nhelp a fair amount okay let me just\nokay\nall right so let's take a look at this\nso\nwhat we've got here is an issue of\nexpectation setting okay so let's\nunderstand so we've got problems with\nprioritization\nproblems with organization\nproblems with communication\nproblems with being triggered\nand then the problem of fixing\nthe above\nfour right we've actually like this like\nproblem number five like how do we deal\nwith this this this this and this that's\nanother problem\nso let's try to understand\nhow adhd works\nand sort of like why this is difficult\nand what we can do about it\nand then we'll start start to see okay\nlike if you find yourself falling into\nthis core problem of okay i have adhd\nand it negatively impacts my\nrelationships i find myself in the same\nsituation over and over and over again i\ndon't know what to do about it what can\ni do about it let's understand this okay\nso the first thing is that when you've\ngot adhd\nyou've got\na bunch of different thoughts\nokay\nand then what your brain does\nis a lot of effort\nyou're like okay like this is all the\ncrap i have to deal with let me organize\nthis\nso you move one over here\nyou move two over here your mind kind of\ndoes this okay first i gotta do this and\nthe next is five\nwhere are three and four who the hell\nknows\nthen we've got six\nthen we've got seven\nso this is what your mind does right so\nit's like okay i gotta renovate a house\nlet me do all this stuff\nand then what happens so you you\norganize your thoughts you organize your\nmind\ngood job\nand then your attention wanders\nso you've spent time organizing let's\nsay you spend one hour of your life\norganizing this and then your attention\nwanders\nand then you get distracted for three\nhours\nand when you come back to the task we're\nback to the jumble\nright\nnow we've added four\nso and this is something that you don't\nhave to have adhd to understand like i\ndon't know if any all have done\nsomething like start a job application\nor like start to fill out an application\nfor let's say college\nand then if time passes between like\nwhen you organize things in your head\nand like let's say like i start filling\nout an application and then i come back\na month later\ncan i pick up where i left off\nabsolutely not\nand that's why we leave tasks undone\nbecause we have to re-do the work you\nall get that like if i if i\nprocrastinate for two weeks and i can't\npick up where i left off i have to redo\nthe work and so now it's like i have to\nspend one hour again but\nbut now it's like\ni have to spend more time just to get\nback to where i was so it's an\nincredibly inefficient way\nand this is what happens in people with\nadhd is that when you've got a lot of\nstuff in your head you try to organize\nit you try to prioritize it and then as\nyou get distracted because remember that\npeople with adhd get distracted easily\nright\nthings get jumbled again and then what\nhappens is you spend a lot of time\nreorganizing it into one two five seven\neight nine and we forgot about four and\nwe forgot about ten she spent two hours\ndoing this and then it gets disorganized\nagain we kind of come back to here and\nthen you go through this process and\nthen nine months go by\nand you haven't renovated enough\nand your partner complains\nyou'll see this\nso what do you do about this\nso what are like the problems here so\nlike\nthere's one thing that you can do i mean\nthere's a lot of stuff you can do we'll\nkind of talk about each of these things\nbut\nthe main thing that you've got to learn\nhow to do if you're struggling with\nrelationships in adhd is set\nexpectations\nso your partner has to know going in\nwhat to expect\nbecause the other thing is that like the\nstress\nfrom this\nand the stress from this\nmakes this process way worse\nit actually makes it more easy for you\nto get disorganized\nright because like now here you are\ntrying to organize what you need to do\nto renovate the house and what is your\nbrain doing your brain is like oh my god\ni've lost my trust even if i spend three\nweeks renovating the house and doing\nperfectly can i count on this person\nanymore\nright you all see that like\nyou don't really know what you can do\nlike you don't know who you can count on\nyou don't know what does this mean for\nme does this mean i have to like find\nnow i have to find a job and move out\nand find a place and like well now we\nhave to go to therapy so like let's add\nthat back on there\nright so now it's like there's even more\nstuff now as we go up here there's like\nokay now i have to find therapy now i\nhave to find a place to live\nnow i'm stressed about money because i\nspent all my money moving across\nthe country to be with this person so\nnow you've added more things right so\nhere's number one here's number two\nhere's number three here's number four\nhere's number five here's number six\nhere's number seven\nhere's number eight\nand so we get overwhelmed\nand so what happens is like task upon\ntask upon task we get over like the more\ntasks there are the more we're\noverwhelmed the more we're overwhelmed\nthe more we start to do work we start to\norganize it and the more we end up\ndisorganizing ourselves because there's\na lot of stuff to do then we've got even\nmore numbers to sort out so now it takes\nlonger to sort them out now we're adding\n11 12 21 28 right so okay now we have to\ndo this and this and this\nand then this\nand then like now it's even more to hold\nin our heads\nand so it becomes this vicious cycle it\nbecomes like a self-fulfilling prophecy\nthis relationship could fall apart you\ngo into the next relationship now you\nhave the burden of this happening twice\nand so what do you do about this\ngotta learn to set expectations\ngotta learn to organize\nokay\nso this is where especially when it\ncomes to relationships i think it starts\nwith\nunderstanding what you're capable of\nand understanding what kind of support\nyou need\nit also involves like very clear\nexpectations around things like\ncommunication\nright so i'll give you guys like sort of\nan example so this is the this is what i\nwould advise someone who's sort of in\nthis situation if you're moving across\nthe country\nwith someone\nit's like thinking through some of these\nthings okay so like okay here's my\nsavings\nyou want to move across the country and\nrenovate a house i'm artistic i'm\ncreative that's fantastic\nwhat is our timeline\nwhat is our budget\nhow are we going to pay expenses\nright this is what i'm putting in i'm\ngoing to spend my savings to move across\nthe country to be with you and so like\nwhat's what's the expectation here like\nyou know how long do you think this is\ngoing to take how much progress do you\nwant to make like you know what's your\nunderstanding like these are all the\nkinds of things that need to be kind of\nlaid out and this is what's actually\nhard for people with adhd is they they\ndon't think about this stuff sort of\nahead of time right because and this is\nthe really interesting thing is that\nif you've got adhd you're so good\nat this kind of crap that you don't like\nyou've adapted to to be able to juggle a\nbunch of things at the same time\nsince you're sort of like in a state of\nlast-minute panic and things are on fire\nyou've actually managed to figure out\nlike how to manage how to deal with\nfires pretty well\nand so interestingly enough instead of\nsitting down and organizing things from\nthe get-go and setting expectations what\npeople with adhd learn how to do is\nbasically pull a rabbit out of a hat dig\nsuper deep go the extra mile and like\npatch things up in a crisis situation\npeople with adhd are so good at dealing\nwith crises because they're in them all\nthe time so you level up your crisis\nmanagement skill but the problem is that\nlike even if you're really good at\ncrisis management it's a stressful way\nto live\nright it's like and it's really\ndifficult for partners because if your\npartner recognizes that your strength is\nin crisis management and you can let\nthings fall apart for a long time and\nthen like patch them back up like that's\nsuper stressful for them\nand then we see these kinds of patterns\nwhere people are kind of you know\nthey're they're like getting\nyou know like look at this this is\ninsane\nkicked me out three separate times\nbecause i need to find independence\nright so what's going on here like how\ndo you manage this kind of stuff\nso set expectations\nright so like what does that mean set\nexpectations that means\nwho\nwhat\nwhen\nwhere\nhow\nstart defining all these things so that\nboth of y'all can get on the same page\nthe cool thing is as you start defining\nthese different things for yourself okay\nlike what does this relationship look\nlike in terms of financial stuff in\nterms of budgeting in terms of like okay\nwhere are we going to be a year from now\nwhat it does is it it externalizes\nthings right so it's almost like you're\nsort of building a priority list you're\norganizing your life a little bit that\nway if you sort of like you know whether\nyou're on track or not on track because\nthe other thing that's really confusing\nis that if you've been with this person\nfor nine months and they pop it on you\nafter nine months they're like hey you\nhaven't done enough it's like okay well\nlike what about\nyou know like why are you springing this\non me now like how did you feel about it\nsix months ago how did you feel about\nthree months ago because this is what\nworks with people with adhds you have to\nsee what's coming\nso if you see what's coming\nright and you're over here\nyou sort of like it'll keep you i don't\nknow how to say this but it'll like kind\nof keep you in track so there's a\ntechnique that works for example with\nkids with adhd\nis you have to like tell them ahead of\ntime what's coming\nso if a kid is playing with their legos\nyou can't say oh hey like by the way\nit's time to go to school put away your\nlegos\nand then like they're absorbed in the\nlegos and then what happens\nyou like say hey it's time for school\nit's time for school and then you start\nyelling because you get frustrated\nbecause they're not paying attention and\nthen they get upset because they're like\nthey were completely absorbed in the\nlegos\nso there's actually i don't know if you\nall remember this but we did a lecture\nabout parenting styles in adhd where\nadhd\nactually increases\ntoxic authoritarian and\nempathic\nparenting\nit's\nuh\nthat's like literally it does that so it\nshifts the way that people parent\nadhd also increases stress and\nworsens depression in the parents\nso it can be very very stressful\nfor people to be in relationships with\npeople with adhd now does that mean\nyou're screwed no\nthere's a lot you can do about it and\nthat's where like setting expectations\nis the first thing\nso you've got to like map stuff out for\nyourself and the good thing is once you\nput it on paper if you lose it all in\nyour head\nthen you've got the paper right so like\nthis is the thing about adhd is you've\ngot bursts of creativity where you can\nget a lot of renovation done so if you\nknow where you're supposed to be one\nmonth where you're supposed to be two\nmonths i wouldn't sort of like focus too\nmuch about you know where you want to be\nsix months from now i'd really sort of\nlike think a little bit about what's the\nfirst thing that you've got to do and\nreally focus on that\nand then recognize that it's going to be\nbumpy right you're going to have weeks\nof time where you don't get any work\ndone the problem is that without this\nexternal structure\nthat's based on mutual expectations\nwhen you lose track there's nothing\nanchoring you to come back when you when\nyou could be productive\nso let's say like you know you screw up\nfor a week or like you're not able to\nfocus for a week but then week two comes\naround and unless you've got something\nanchoring you pulling you back\nyou're gonna spend time like doing\nsomething else so you're you're losing\nthese windows of productivity\nand you can still do it because people\nwith adhd can be so they're sort of this\nidea of hyper focus right where there's\nlike ext\nabsurd amounts of productivity for some\npeople\nand so that's the kind of thing where\nit's like the successful strategy is\nabout figuring out how can we capture\nthose moments of productivity and that's\nwhere setting expectations is very very\nimportant\nso this is where like let's start with\nthe relationship right so like this is\nanother kind of thing which it's kind of\ninteresting but\nso like what is the what are the\nexpectations in the relationship who's\ngoing to contribute what and like what\nyou know what's the standard here\nso like who's going to contribute\nfinancially who's going to take care of\ncleaning even in terms of cleaning like\nwhat does that mean you can't use a\nvague term you have to define it what\ndoes cleaning mean i'm supposed to keep\nthe place clean\nwell let's think about that does that\nmean like sweeping every day does that\nmean mopping every day does that mean\ncleaning the toilets every day like what\nis like the clean like let's organize it\nwho what when where how\nwhat are the expectations financially\nlike okay like how long are we going to\ntry this renovation stuff what kind of\nprogress do we want to make like what\nare the steps of renovation like let's\nset expectations\nbecause what happens in relationships is\nwhen you don't set expectations\nespecially if you're with someone who's\nneurotypical they may not need to set\nout these explicit expectations because\nthey can hold stuff in their head better\ndoes that make sense so the key thing\nhere is that like you've got to put it\non a piece of paper or you have to put\nit out in some kind of external\nstructure because if you lose track of\nit in your mind which happens very\nquickly you've got to start over from\nscratch and you'll make no progress in\nnine months\nso the expectation setting is very very\nimportant it's also very very important\nfrom a relationship standpoint right so\nnow your partner knows\nthat you may struggle hey by the way\nso i'm very confident that i can\nrenovate this house but there are going\nto be periods of time where it's very\nvery overwhelming in periods of time\nwhere i'm going to be really really\nproductive\nhere's what i'd like to get done in the\nfirst month here's what i like to get\ndone in the second month the third month\nthe fourth month the fifth month the\nsixth month\ni'm not saying that i can necessarily\nstick to this but this is where you know\nlike generally speaking it takes me one\nand a half times longer than what i set\nout to do\nso this this is a six month plan that\nmay take nine months\nand let's check in regularly\nright so then there's also an\nexpectation around communication\nthis is really important if you've got\nadhd or you're dating someone with adhd\nyou must set a schedule of communication\nyou can't just talk about things when\nthey're a problem which is usually how\nrelationships work\nright we don't talk about stuff unless\nit's a problem that absolutely needs to\nchange you need to be so much more\nproactive\nso hey can we check in once a month and\nsee like how things are going\nso here's why we moved across the\ncountry how do you think that's going\nhere's where we are with renovation\nhere's where we are with our\nrelationship here's where we are with\nlike communication you mentioned you\nknow that you don't like my tone\nsometimes\nyou know like so so this is where\nexpectations become very very important\nand so if we kind of go back to\nthis for a moment\nyou know i would sort of say like okay\nwhat are the expectations around\norganization\nwhat are the expectations around\ncommunication what are the expectations\naround therapy\nso if things aren't working out in six\nmonths like what do you think about\nstarting to see a therapist\nwhat are the expectations around money\nso if i'm moving across the country i\ndon't have a job and i'm focused on\nrenovating\nare you comfortable financially\nsupporting me\nfor what period of time are you\ncomfortable financially supporting me\nyou should know this right\nso i think what's happening in in a lot\nof this this situation is i do think\nthere are some things that you should\nreally be careful about so this happens\na lot with people who have adhd\nwhich is that they need help\nsometimes and people want to help them\nespecially if you're in a relationship\nso getting kicked out three separate\ntimes saying i need to find my\nindependence so sometimes you'll find\nthis is much somewhat of an age gap here\ntoo there's probably also a maturity gap\nso what's the expectation there\nright if i'm a 25 year old and i'm\ndating a 17 year old\nand they're moving in with me\nwhat how are they going to find their\nindependence\nlike what's your plan for finding your\nindependence and why do you keep moving\nin\nif the goal is to be independent like\nwhy is\nwhy are we moving in with people very\nquickly over and over and over again\ngetting kicked out is\nunfortunate for sure but i think the\nother mistake in terms of how am i a\nmagnet for these situations why are you\nmoving in in the first place\nthat's the thing that you need to figure\nout\nare you magnet for these situations 100\nright and that's where we've got to be\nkind of careful here because we're not\nsort of saying it's your fault but you\ndo have a hand in it so you're it looks\nlike you're in a relationship with who's\nsomeone who's grouded and compassionate\nthat's awesome\num you're also growing right so this is\nsomething else that we see is like this\nperson is learning and getting better at\nit practicing self-awareness setting\nboundaries better\nbut there's also like how are we how are\nwe so quickly moving in\nwith people and this is the other thing\nthat we tend to see with adhd is that a\nlot of times people do need support\nright so you you may have difficulty\nkeeping a job you may\nneed to quote unquote mooch\nwhere that's where like i don't really\nview it as mooching as long as everyone\nis on the same page about what each\npartner is bringing to the relationship\nand that's where expectation setting\nbecomes really really important\nso in terms of how to avoid this\nsituation i would be really really\ncareful\nso what we tend to look at is how the\nsituation so this is like the other kind\nof key tip when we're trying to figure\nout\nyou know how do i keep on finding myself\nin this situation\nwe look at the situation when it starts\nfalling apart\nhow do i stop getting kicked out that's\nthe problem\nright\nthat's not the problem if you want to\nfix the situation how the hell do you\nkeep on moving in\nso like we've seen this in other places\ntoo like let's think about the friend\nzone\nhow do i keep on getting front like you\nknow like i i i\nexpress my feelings for this person i\nconfess my love\nhow do i like how do i stay out of the\nfriend zone\nand that's sort of where it's like it's\nnot expressing your feelings that's the\nproblem it's what is the formation of\nthis relationship looking like\nright like how do you start to form\nthese relationships do you start these\nrelationships in a platonic way do you\nstart these relationships in a\nprofessional way\nor do you start these relationships in a\nromantic way\nand for a lot of people who get\nfriend-zoned\nthey usually don't start them off\nromantically right they usually start\nthem off platonically and so you're\nsetting an expectation\nso the key thing about all these\ndifferent things if there's one thing to\ntake away if you're struggling with adhd\nand you're having problems in terms of\norganizing prioritizing you know like if\nyou're struggling to like communicate\nwith your partner it comes down to\nreally sitting down and setting good\nexpectations\nit's like thinking through stuff ahead\nof time and trying to externalize as\nmuch of it as you can because if you try\nto hold it in your head that may work\nfor neurotypical people\nthey may be able to hold a lot of crap\nin their head\nbut like\nthe second you get distracted it all\ngets disorganized then you have to start\nover from square one\nand then over time stuff piles up the\nmore stuff piles up the more overwhelm\nyou get now you have to even hold more\nstuff in your head so whereas it used to\ntake you one hour to organize your mind\nnow it's going to take you an hour and a\nhalf now it's going to take you two\nhours and now you've actually spent four\nhours working on this thing and getting\nnothing done today\nand then it tacks on one more task for\nyou tomorrow because you didn't get\nanything done today\nso then you go into the next day and now\nyou have five hours worth of work to do\nand so like it becomes this vicious\ncycle\nso the first thing that you've gotta\ngotta gotta gotta do is set expectations\nfor yourself externalize those\nexpectations write them down who's gonna\ncontribute what what are you expecting\nfrom me\nhow are we measuring progress in our\nrelationship how are we measuring\nprogress in renovation because if you\nreally think about it people with adhd\nstruggle but when they have some kind of\nexternalizing organizing force or\nstructure\nit helps them operate way better\nright so that's what you've got to make\nfor yourself\nso this is the kind of thing where if\nyou're in 80 if you've got adhd you've\ngot to be super careful because there's\nall the problems that you kind of\nstruggle with from sort of a\nneurodiverse perspective right you may\nhave difficulty organizing prioritizing\nbut then there's the impact of that kind\nof stuff on your relationship\nand then that which should be your\nsafety net now becomes an additional\nsource of stress\nand the more that happens the more you\nget traumatized the more you get\noverwhelmed the more it becomes a\nvicious cycle over and over and over\nagain\nand so you've got to start by like\nsetting expectations with your partner\nwith yourself about what you're capable\nof what amount of allowance you have\nwhat progress looks like and the more\nthat you're able to set that external\nstructure as soon as you sort of snap\nback into it and you're able to be\nproductive if the task is laid out for\nyou you can actually make progress on it\nyou"
