    "transcript": "for those of you that don't know there\nwas a landmark supreme court case in the\nunited states so this is going to be\nbasically u.s focus for our\ninternational audience and\num you know thankfully doesn't really\napply to you hopefully it doesn't apply\nto you but\nuh where\nthe supreme court of the united states\nbasically upheld um the right to get an\nabortion and so based on this case it\nwas like basically a federally protected\nability to get an abortion\nso today the u.s supreme court in a 6-3\ndecision overturned that case and\nbasically said the states get to decide\nso there's not a federal protection\nagainst abortion it's a state-specific\nissue where states get to decide whether\nyou can have an abortion or not\nas a consequence of this there are many\nstates that based on their political\nleanings will basically outlaw abortion\nso\ni'm not a political expert by any means\ni don't\ni have some political opinions but it's\nnot like my political opinions are more\nvalid or\nthan anyone else's\nbut i just want to share with you all\nlike a couple of stories and what i\nunderstand about abortion as a medical\nuh provider\nso when i was on my obstetrics and\ngynecology rotation in medical school\ni had a patient who\nhad a fetus\nthat had something called anencephaly\nso anencephaly is an exceedingly rare\ncondition it happens to about one to\nthree\npregnancies out of about ten thousand\nright so we're talking like you know\nsomewhere around\none out of ten thousand two out of ten\nthousand one out of three thousand\ndepends a little bit on ethnicity and\nthere are other kinds of different\nvariables\nbut anencephaly is a fetus that does not\nhave basically a brain\nso it's possible in the development of a\nfetus for you something goes wrong and\nthey're born without the cranium\nor not born they're developing without a\ncranium and without a brain\nso naturally what happened in this case\nis that generally speaking it's a\nreasonable thing for\nsomeone to have\nan abortion and terminate the pregnancy\nwhen you have a fetus that is completely\nunviable so fetus has a heartbeat\nit just has no brain and its capacity to\nlive is like\nbasically non-existent\nso a lot of times these um\nyou know the fetuses can\nbe alive at the time of birth but many\ntimes they're not and then they all\ninevitably\ni can't think of i've never heard maybe\nthere is a single i can't think of a\nsingle case well this will turn into a\nviable human being\nso the first thing that i want to say is\nas a medical doctor like there are\nabsolutely reasons to get abortions from\nmedical reasons it's like the there's no\nway like despite the fact that it has a\nheartbeat there's no way that this will\never be like a human being\nit just it's missing a brain\nright so like you can have and\nessentially what happens is\nthey go into cardiac arrest because the\npart of your brain that governs your\nheartbeat there's a part of your brain\nthat governs and keeps you breathing\nand governs your heartbeat which is\nnon-functional because it's missing or\nit's like severely underdeveloped in\npeople with encephaly\nand so like in my mind there's no doubt\nthat abortions are\nmedically necessary at some points okay\nthat's the first thing\nthe second thing is that generally\nspeaking there's also a lot of public\nhealth and epidemiologic data\nthat restricting access to abortion does\nnot it may reduce abortions to some\namount but what it really does is\nreduces access to safe abortions\nand that women who aren't able to care\nfor a child or aren't able to stay\npregnant will seek abortions in other\nways\nso there are all kinds of kind of like\nhomebrew kind of abortion techniques and\nthings like that you know people use the\nphrase coat hanger\nbut there's good evidence that shows\nthat when you restrict access to safe\nabortions what happens is people are\ngonna like\nget abortions in unsafe ways\nthere's also all kinds of evidence that\nshows that restrictions on safe\nabortions\ndisproportionately affect poor people\nso what this means is that if you're\nrich and you live in a place where\nabortions aren't\nlegal\nwhat you'll probably do is just fly to a\nplace where they are illegal get a\nprocedure in secret and fly\nback what happens though is if you're if\nyou lack means\nlike this is this is a law that\ndisproportionately affects poor people\nwho don't have the means to handle the\nabortion\nand there's a lot of evidence not i mean\nthat's an overstatement i've heard\nstories about you know cases of this\nwhere people who are very\nanti-abortion who have gotten abortions\nthemselves and in their case it was okay\nright but like all the other abortions\nall the abortions except for mine are\nmorally reprehensible\ni think we just sort of know and there's\nall kinds of other negative impacts like\nso we see negative economic impacts we\nsee crime rates increase\nabout a decade or 15 after 15 years\nafter abortion\nbecomes unavailable\nso we'll also see similarly crime rates\ndecrease 15 years after you make\nabortion sort of accessible\nso i i think from a medical standpoint\nyou know there are tons of reasons like\nectopic pregnancies and stuff like that\nwhere abortions are like medically\ni wouldn't quite say\nnecessary but medically\num i mean there are cases where they're\nmedically necessary but i'm not an\nobstetrician\nthey're definitely medically like\nreasonable cases for abortion and so i\nthink these kinds of blanket protections\nare important to preserve those kinds of\nthings because i don't\ni don't know that lawmaker so first of\nall like a lot of the people who are\npassing laws don't really consider\nmedical evidence when they pass laws\nright so they'll sort of say like viable\nheartbeat for example is something that\ni hear a lot\nis sort of a dividing line but like what\nabout the case of anencephaly\nand so this is the kind of thing where\nlike i think it's a real unfortunate\nthing that the supreme court has done i\nthink it's like going to\ndisproportionately affect people who are\npoor\ni think it's not going to be good for\nour society i think it's not going to be\ngood for\npotentially fetuses or\nuh prospective mothers\nand and it's really unfortunate like i\ni mean if y'all want to talk more about\nit i suppose we can but i i don't really\nhave much more to i mean in a sense i\nhave a lot to say but in a sense like\nit's pretty open and shut at least in\nthe medical community about\nthe the importance of abortions like i\ndon't think that there's a whole lot of\ndebate amongst actual doctors\nabout the importance of this\num\nso like\nyou know but like doctors are not\nnecessarily lawmakers and like that's i\nthink okay in a sense\ni just wish that lawmakers would really\nconsider medical science a little bit\nmore when they instituted policies like\nthis so here's like basically what i\nkind of think about it it's like okay if\nyou wanna\noutlaw abortion\nat the minute like\nthis is my basic problem in terms of\nlike policy is that people don't\nplay the tape through to the end\nso it's like\nwhat happens to that child when it's\nborn so if you've got like a 16 year old\nwho's like has a kid like what happens\nto the child what happens to the mother\nlike do you have maternity leave do you\nhave\nchild care services like what what\nhappens\nand i think we sort of learned this in\nmedicine\nwhere\nso we decided at some point as medical\ndoctors which is a good decision that\nwe're not going to let someone die so\nwhen you come into the emergency room\nwith a heart attack or whatever we don't\ncare what you did prior to coming into\nour doors we're gonna do our best to\nsave your life\nso this is like really important it\nbecame also pretty important during\ncovid when when people\nyou know were like anti-vaccine didn't\nget vaccinated and like as a doctor like\ndo you let that person die because it's\ntheir decision no you don't so we have\nwe have a simple rule in medicine which\nis that we're going to try to help\npeople no matter what i think it's a\ngreat rule\nthe problem is that rule creates some\ninteresting issues so the first is that\nif we're going to provide emergency\nservices and when someone comes in we\ndon't ask you like can you afford\nyou know\ncardiac icu time we're going to save\nwe're going to save the person's life\nthe problem is that when we do that it's\nvery expensive\nso as it's very expensive like someone\nhas to eat that cost it's generally\nspeaking eaten by the taxpayer this is\nalso something that people in the u.s\ndon't really understand\nis that without socialized medicine we\nhave socialized medicine already\nthe difference is we just have a very\nvery very expensive form of it so let me\nwalk y'all through like what happens and\ni guess this is a tangent that we're\ngoing on\nso if a homeless person comes in with\nsevere heart disease and a heart attack\nwe put that person in the cardiac icu we\nprovide care for them right because\nwe're not going to let people die that's\nnot that's the line that we've drawn in\nthe sand we're going to provide people\nwith care\nthen let's say that the icu costs a\nhundred thousand dollars in terms of the\nstay so the patient can't pay because\nthey're homeless and they have no money\nso then who eats the cost the hospital\neats the cost\nif the hospital keeps on eating costs if\nthey keep on providing a hundred\nthousand dollars worth of care and never\nget reimbursed in it what happens the\nhospital goes under\nright because you can't keep on giving\nfree\ncare without getting like paying you\nknow for your ventilators and nurses and\ndoctors and all cleaning people and all\nthis kind of stuff\nso then what the hospital does is goes\nto the government and says hey by the\nway we're gonna go out of business\nbecause there's a bunch of uninsured\npeople that are getting life-saving\nmedical care the government says okay\nwhat do you need from us to not go out\nof business because we as the government\nneed you to exist right because\notherwise our populists can't get\nmedical care and the hospital says we\nneed this amount of money to stay afloat\nbecause of the\ncare we're providing the energy and the\ngovernment says okay fine and then they\npay that money and where does that money\ncome from it comes from taxpayers right\nthat's where the government gets its\nmoney\nso we're already subsidizing this care\nnow the problem the real problem\nis that if we had started that person on\nmedication for forty dollars a month\nlike if we had started this person on a\nstatin we'd started them on our blood\npressure medication\nif we had provided this person with a\nthousand dollars of medical care\nover the last five years it would have\nsaved us 99 000 in icu care\nbut we don't pay for that because this\nperson can't afford it so this is one of\nthe reasons why the united states has\none of the best health care systems in\nthe in the world\nin terms of like the quality of\nparticular procedures and outcomes that\nwe can deliver\nand it is so bloated and expensive\nso the value of the united states\nhealthcare system is low\nlike so that what you get for what you\nspend is actually inefficient\nbut what you get is excellent\nin terms of like the quality of care\nthat we provide if that makes sense\nand so this is my basic issue with a lot\nof like uh healthcare policy\nis that i think you you've got to like\nif you're thinking about you know\nsocialized healthcare and stuff it's not\nabout like we're already doing it we\njust people i don't the people don't\nseem to understand this\nlike people don't get it that\nit would just be cheaper\nto like in astronomically cheaper to\nprovide this person with medical care\nlongitudinally for free like we would\nsave money\nwe would save like 99 grand\nin this scenario\nright and so it's like it's just such an\ninefficient system and so this is the\nthing about medical policy is that like\ni think you got to play the tape through\nto the end\nso like even if you want to make an\nargument for being pro-life and like not\nletting people get abortions like what\nhappens next\nright that's what i that's what i think\nis really unfortunate about like all\nthese policies like\nyou know\nyou got to play the tape through to the\nend and account for all of the\nconsequences for your law\nand that doesn't happen\nand so then what we sort of end up with\nis situations that are just like\nobjectively worse like we could do\nobjectively better we could save a life\nprovide a greater quality of life\nreduce morbidity and reduce mortality\nand save money doing it uh so wonder\nchimp is asking the preventive care\nprice isn't wrong but don't hospitals\nonly recruit seventy percent of the cost\nof a medicare medicaid stay the rest is\ncovered by inflating costs to private\ninsurance yeah\nin essence yes\nso a lot of times hospitals will lose\nmoney\non certain\npayers and make money on other pairs but\nthere are other advantages of medicare\nand medicaid so for example like\nmedicare will pay they'll pay on time\nprivate insurance will like fight you\nfor like three or six months and then\nthey'll pay you more so there's there's\nall kinds of i mean it gets super\ncomplicated which is part of the reason\nthe health care system is so messed up\nbasic problem with the healthcare system\nin the united states in my opinion is\nthat\nthe person who spends the dollar has no\nrecourse if their dollar is misspent\nright so like when i purchase a candy\nbar if i don't like the candy bar\ni have the option to not purchase it\nagain so what this does is guarantees\nsome amount of feedback between me and\nthe candy bar producer or if they make\ntheir candy bar too small or they make\nit taste too crappy i'm gonna stop\nbuying it basic issue is that that this\nfeedback mechanism is not in place\nright so when i have employer-based\nhealth insurance\nlike\nif i'm unhappy with my health insurance\ni can't\nquit\nright like i can't do that\nso when you when you have a fundamental\nlike when there's a when i pay a dollar\nto you and you pay a dollar to someone\nelse\nand that person provides me with health\ncare\nthat triangle sort of situation is like\nnot\nconducive to because they're altered\nincentives\nso it's that's a basic issue\nyou"
