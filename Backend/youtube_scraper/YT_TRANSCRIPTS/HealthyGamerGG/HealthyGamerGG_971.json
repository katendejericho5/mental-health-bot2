    "transcript": "dating apps have this assumption\nthat the crap that you put into your\nprofile has some impact on whether you\nwind up in a relationship or not\nadvice discussion after dr k's talk on\ndating apps\nso hey community i22m i'm a longtime\nlurker of this community after hearing\ndr k hey thank you for coming out of the\nlurking and posting and contributing we\nappreciate it after hearing dr k's talk\non dating apps i wanted to talk\nabout some nuances that i felt he didn't\ntouch on first of all i agree that\ncommunication skill and dating just in\nevery part of life is one of the most\nimportant skills to work on and that is\nnot looked at enough my main gripe is\nthat online dating for i feel like a lot\nof men doesn't even get to the\ncommunication part\ni average one to three local non-bot or\nnon-instagram snapchat only fans farming\nmatches in the first month after\ncreating a profile after these few weeks\ni average zero matches and have to\ncreate a new profile to dr k these apps\nhave a big problem with men to women\nratio and how the algorithm takes\nvisibility of your profile\nbecause of this women can cherry pick\nprofiles and don't participate much in\nchatting and planning casual meetups or\ndates women using their profiles to\nboost their other online social media\nfollowers or only fan subscriptions is\nalso a huge but different problem of\ncourse i know not all women do this i\njust want to point out my experience on\nthese apps for years also you can put\nfilters on distance to other profiles i\ndidn't understand why dr k talked about\nthis being a huge issue specifically for\nonline dating\nso drake shows research that the way we\nfill in a profile does not matter\nwithin my many years on the dating apps\ni agree i get the same amount of matches\nwith different types of profiles no\nslash funny earnest bios bios mentioning\nhobbies bios mentioning physical\nattributes few lots of pictures goofy\nselfie group pictures i've tried\ndifferent types of swiping methods\nliking all profiles only liking\nprofiles with bios with pictures with\npeople that i find attractive again no\nchange in the amount of matches\nnow when i succeed to go on a date which\nhappens about once or twice a year\npre-covered i find mostly find it a fun\ntime i could describe myself as an\nintrovert who likes to socialize with\nevery date so far the other person\nalways kindly declines a second date i\nthen asked on different occasions what\nthey thought of me to get a better\nunderstanding why they responded i was\nkind and respectful that i was fun to\nhave a chat with but they weren't\ninterested to go further and that they\nsay they weren't ready yet to genuinely\ndate someone i very much respect that i\nwouldn't want them to feel forced to go\non more dates if they don't want to now\nto get back on the topic i also hear i'm\nfun kind respectful calm communicator so\ndo i just need to go on more dates to\neventually find someone who does not\nwant to date me more than once but with\nthe pace i have matches and eventually\ndates it can take years i'm really\na loss\nokay\nso we're gonna they offer more context\nbut we're gonna kind of pause here for a\nsecond\nso here's the central point\nthat i was trying to make\nactually let's start with this let's\nstart with a couple of observations\nthe first is what is the outcome\nthat the dating profiles are the dating\napps are looking for\nyou can even hear it right in this\nperson's thing\nwhat is the outcome that they're\nmeasuring\nwhat's the outcome that they're trying\nto to detect\nthey're detecting the outcome that\nthey're looking at is matches\nright everything about this is nope\npeople are saying\ndates engagement nope incorrect it's\nmatches\nit doesn't my profile doesn't affect\nmatches these are the matches that i get\nmatches matches matches matches matches\nso the first thing that's happened is\ndating profiles have shifted the target\non us without us even realizing it it\nhappened so quickly and so rapidly that\nwe completely lost track of it and now\neveryone's looking at matches\nwhat was the original goal of a dating\npro\napp\nwhat was the goal of a dating app\nthe premise of the original dating apps\nand the premise of dating apps still\nis this\nthere are million people out there\none of them or some of them are right\nfor you\nby using all of these filters ahead of\ntime we can find the right person for\nyou\ntheir general argument was that if you\ngo and date for 10 years you may never\nfind the right person\nbecause you're going to waste all this\ntime\ngoing through people who are incorrect\nonly to find the one who's correct\nand so by measuring all these things by\nbuilding a profile and by matching you\nwe can accelerate that process you will\nfind a relationship or love faster than\nyou would in the real world\ndue to our matching algorithms you will\nneed to go through\nfewer people to find the right one do\nyou all get this this is the general\npremise\nwhat has actually happened in dating\napps the exact opposite how many people\ndo you go through now to find the right\none\nit's escalated enormously\nyou know people would date what 10\npeople 20 people 30 people\nbefore getting married like who knows\nwhat the average is this well like we\nhave to do a ton of research on this\nokay\nhow many people do you go through now\nway more\nso the fundamental premise of the dating\napp is actually like inverse\nthe promise that they give you and what\nthey deliver is like the exact opposite\nit's like getting a job where every hour\nthat you work you pay them money\ninstead of you getting money they're\nlike hey our system will make it easier\nfor you you will have to go through\nfewer people because we're gonna\npre-select we're gonna look at like like\nyour religion and we're gonna look at\nyour race and we're gonna look at your\ngoals whether you have kids or not as we\ncheck all these boxes you will have to\ngo through fewer people the alternative\nis you have to go and meet other people\nand you have to like talk to them and\nyou have to go on four dates to figure\nout if they have kids we're going to\nsimplify that process by doing it from\nthe get-go\nand the result that they create is not\nthat you have to go through fewer people\nyou have to go through more way more\nastronomically more\nso here's the first thing to understand\nthis is what i was trying to say\ndating apps have this assumption\nthat the crap that you put into your\nprofile has some impact on whether you\nwind up in a relationship or not\nand where does that assumption come from\nit's because you can only put particular\ncrap into the dating profile\nright there's like i don't know how to\nsay this but you can put your race you\ncan put your ethnicity you can put\nwhatever like you put pictures\nand we assume that those things\ncorrelate with finding a successful\nrelationship\nit turns out that those are not the\nthings that correlate with a successful\nrelationship let's look at some science\nthe measurement of perceived\nrelationship quality components a\nconfirmatory factor analytic approach\nthis is what correlates with success in\na relationship\nthis is the kind of crap satisfaction\ncommitment intimacy trust passion love\nthis is factor analysis there's a lot of\nscience behind this crap\nthis does not this chart\nmodel one single factor model two six\nuncorrelated factors this chart does not\ngo into your dating profile if you want\nto understand how to make predictions\nabout matching with someone properly in\nterms of forming a relationship this is\nthe level that you have to operate at\nright\nthis is not the actual information that\nit takes\npredictors of romantic relationship\nformation attachment style prior\nrelationships and dating goals\nso now we're getting a little bit\ncloser\nright maybe dating goals like does the\ntransition from not dating to casual\ndating or committed dating was mainly\npredicted by prior dating success with\nsome support for a potential role for\nthe additional role of the desire to\nform a committed relationship\nso\nthe transition from not dating to casual\ncommitted dating was mainly predicted by\nprior dating success let me ask you a\nquestion\nwhen you fill out an app\nwhen you make a profile in an app does\nit ask you how successful you are in\ndating does it show other app\nis part of someone else's profile does\nit show you how successful they are at\ndating\nbecause that's what's actually like\nscientifically correlated\nwith it\nright there's also things like\nattachment style does it show you what\nthe attachment style is\nbecause it turns out that attachment\navoidance but not anxiety was predictive\nof not entering into a committed\nrelationship even with rival predictors\nincluded so if you're looking for a\nrelationship\ndo you get to see whether the other\nperson has anxious avoid an attachment\nan anxious attachment or avoid an\nattachment\nbecause this is actually what predicts\nrelationships no what they show you is\nwhat they can collect\nand somewhere along the way\nbased on what they can collect\nis what we start it's sort of like\nwe can't measure what's in your bank\naccount but we can measure\nthe size of the wheels on your car\nso in order to determine whether you are\na good candidate for a loan we're gonna\nmeasure the size of the wheels on your\ncar because we don't know how much money\nis in your bank account\nit's idiotic\nwe are starting to form\npredictions on relationships with what\nwe can measure even though what we can\nmeasure or what we can display doesn't\nactually correlate with what succeeds in\na relationship\nand so let me ask you something if you\ndesign a system\nin which what you measure and what you\ndisplay has no correlation in\nrelationship what impact do you think it\nwould have on people's success at\nfinding relationships\nyou would assume\nthat it has no impact\nand what was the original premise of\ndating apps\nit was hey if you filter all this crap\nahead of time we'll make it easier on\nyou you don't have to date 20 or 30\npeople you don't have to talk to 20 or\n30 people we'll help you get there\nfaster and instead what we see is the\nopposite effect now you have to talk to\n300 people 400 people 500 people a\nthousand people 1500 people it's almost\nas if their system is worse than like\nthe baseline\nand we wonder why is dating so hard now\nit's because the system is actually\ndesigned to produce a completely\ndifferent result\ndo like\ni don't know what to say like the system\nsucks\nand we have data to support that the\nsystem sucks\nthe promise that that these the\nfoundation that these apps were built on\nis creating the opposite effect\nif we pre-filter if you tell us whether\nyou want to have kids whether you like\nhiking or not and how you spend your\ntime\npeople will be able to see that and the\npeople who are interested in that kind\nof thing will be able to select you ergo\nyou will have fewer rejections\nright we're going to only find the\npeople who like the stuff that you do\nand we're going to match you together\nbut now you get more rejections\nand this doesn't even start to include\nlike the crap from the bots and the only\nfans and social media kind of crap\nright i don't need to touch that\nso dating apps\nand this is where they like\nthey tricked us\nbecause then what they did is they\nstopped looking at relationships what\nthey looked at was matches\nand even if you go back to that post you\ncan rewind and like find it again\nmatches matches matches matches matches\nthey changed the instrument of\nmeasurement\nto something that when we signed up for\nthe dating app we weren't trying to\nmaximize our matches we were trying to\nmaximize our relationships\nand they like switched what they measure\non us\nit's like oh no we don't care about the\nmoney in your bank account we're going\nto measure tire tire size tire size is\nwhat we're going on now and then\neveryone started doing it because that's\nwhat they can control that's what they\ncan influence that's what their\nmeasurements can allow us to do is match\nbut that's not the same thing as a\nrelationship somewhere along the way\nwe sort of assumed that more matches\nleads to more better relationships\nyou all get that\nso this is the fundamental problem with\ndating apps\nis that the reason that we use them and\nthe promise that we're sort of given on\na fundamental level does not actually\nthey don't do\nwhat we use them to do\nbecause they can't do that\nand so like this has happened so quickly\nand so rapidly that like we've been all\ntaken by surprise\ndoes that make sense\nwe're actually like it's harder to date\nwe get rejected by more people\nwe actually have to look through more\npeople\nand so then\none of the interesting questions and\nthen why the hell does anyone use it\nthis is really fascinating\nso\ni'm going to give you all kind of the\nreason we use it is because it's simple\nthe cost of using an app for one minute\nand the availability of using an app for\none minute is incredibly low\nthe cost of using an app over the course\nof one year or two years is way higher\nand so the the apps are\nwhat they do is like if you think about\nhow to meet someone like if you want to\nfind someone there's a very high up\nfront upfront cost investment for a\nparticular day\ni got a shower i gotta shave i gotta\nmake social plans i gotta go to this\nparty i'm gonna meet some people there\nso it's like four to five hours of prep\nfor like one opportunity of a\nquestionable result\nwhereas like i can be taking a dump this\nmorning and be swiping on tinder and for\nfive minutes i can swipe and look\nthrough profiles\nso they make the accessibility\nof pro like the illusion of progress so\nthe illusion of progress is so\naccessible\nthat like we just do it very easily\nit's sort of like\nyou know if you look at a slot machine\nlike slot machines have terrible odds\nwhy the hell do people play slot\nmachines\nbecause all it takes to play a slot\nmachine is to pull a lever\nthe upfront cost is so low to engage in\nthis low probability of success behavior\nthat people keep doing it\nand then the other thing that slot\nmachines figured out is we can add\nit's not like a slot machine has an rng\nrandom number generate boom lose boom\nlose boom lose boom lose and what did\nthe dating apps do\noh\nyou got a notification\nyou got a match it's pulsing\nit's just designed just like a slot\nmachine\n[Music]\nright so that's why we use them because\nthe dating app came along and say hey if\nyou want to like try to go meet someone\nwho the hell knows whether you will or\nnot you're gonna have to shower you're\ngonna have to shave you're gonna have to\nshave your legs you have to get a new\ndress you have to put on makeup and then\nlike you may meet someone who's a\ncomplete idiot could be a complete waste\nof your time\nbut\nwhile you're in your slippies\nand you haven't shaved or washed any\npart of your body in 72 hours\nwe can help you get one step closer\nand that's it in a nutshell what's the\ndeal with dating apps that's it\nquestions\nyeah spinster4444 is saying not even a\nlever just press a button 100.\nso\nxxrox7 is asking how do we test for\ncompatibility\nthis\nthis is how you test for compatibility\nlook at it\nthis is what you got to do\nthis paper i'm sort of misrepresenting\nin some ways but i picked it\npurposefully because of its complexity\nbut this is how you this is how you test\nfor it\nso there may be matching out there\nthe problem is that like the matching\nthis is the other like big thing that\npeople don't realize\nis that there's an assumption in dating\napps that your subjective impression\nis going to correlate with some amount\nof success\nyou all get that like they assume that\nyou know what you want or you know\nthat your preferences will actually like\nyour subjective preferences will\nactually be what you're looking for\nright so like just to give you all an\nexample\nyou know there's this kind of common\nperception that men will date women like\ntheir moms and women will date men like\ntheir dads\nso like even if we assume that's true\nfor a moment does this when you're\nfilling out a dating profile that's what\nyour actual preference is let's just\nassume that's true for a moment we're\nnot saying it is\ndoes the dating profile let you select\nfor that in any way in your mind of\ncourse not\nright so there's all kinds of stuff that\nwe may be able to like actually select\nthings for which is cool\nbut like\nthere's an assumption that we know what\nthose are subjectively whereas if you\nlook at things like attachment so if we\nknow that for example attachment style\ncorrelates with like dating\ncompatibility there's an assumption that\na human being knows what their\nattachment style is which is chances are\nwe don't\nso the other problem with a lot of this\nresearch is when we look at what\ncorrelates with success in dating\nthis is stuff that people usually don't\nknow about themselves so the fact that\ni'm the one that's creating it as\nopposed to a psychologist who's doing a\npersonality analysis and doing some kind\nof like matching system there which if\nyou all remember we looked at that\nmanagement paper about like red flags\nand interviews\nthat's where it becomes kind of\ninteresting like that's what the\nresolution of data you may need and\nthere's also an assumption that you\nsubjectively know what you're looking\nfor\nso it's interesting because if you look\nat other matchmaking services\nhistorically\nyou'd have a matchmaker right and you\nkind of tell them what they want what\nyou want\nbut a matchmaker\nwill like look at you and recognize\nparticular things about your personality\nand recognize what kind of thing will\nactually be compatible for you\nand so that's the presumption of a\nmatchmaker the matchmaker used to also\nalso makes a claim of a value add that\nif you actually literally pay me money i\nwill help you find a good relationship\nindian matchmaking on netflix is\nexcellent by the way love it\nif you guys are interested in that it's\ncool\num\nquestions\nindian\nmatchmaking do you think dating apps\nhave any positives hundred percent\nso the key thing to remember about\ndating apps is what they actually offer\nand what they deliver\nand if you want to engage in that\nthey're great\nso for example\nthey're a great way to recruit for\nsocial media\nget cash from people or get\nsubscriptions on only fans they're\nfantastic for that\nright that's why i think that so many\npeople do that kind of crap\nthey're great for bots that are looking\nto connect with people and maybe\nphishing scams\nright they're good for that too\nthey may be great for things like um you\nknow you just have to remember what\nthey're good for\nwhich is like they may be great for\npotentially hookups or things like that\nthey're great for like starting\nconversations and connecting you with\npeople that you would otherwise never\nmeet\nright so like that's actually really\ncool about dating apps is like they they\nwill connect potential people that in\nthe normal course of their social\ninteractions would never encounter each\nother\nand those people could be very\ncompatible it's just like\nyou know if i go to church all the time\nand like i would never get the chance to\nmeet someone who like goes to mosque all\nthe time\nright like i may just never run across\nthem so i think there's a lot of good\nstuff that they're for\ni think the challenge is that\nthey claim to be good at\nwe use them looking for a particular\nthing\nand it doesn't give us that thing\nand then we get really frustrated by it\nbecause we had this assumption that they\nwere good for that particular thing\nso it's not that they're bad it's just\nwhat do they offer what do they promise\nand what do they deliver\nand when you use it what are you looking\nfor\nright so like they're also good for\nother things which is that i can start\nto do some kind of\nrelationship building in my jammies not\nhaving showered in two days they're\nfantastic for that\ngreat\nlove\nrecklessly saying the people i've dated\nfrom dating apps who i already knew from\nmy past but we never considered dating\nthat's actually a very co not very\ncommon but that's something that i hear\nis actually really good where people\nwill like connect many years later and\nthey'll like\nthey'll actually end up having a healthy\nrelationship and they're like hey did i\nlike i had a crush on you in the seventh\ngrade and it was like 10 years later the\nother was like oh like\ni had a crush on you too and then you're\nlike lol\nwant to get together\nwant to screw\ndtf and they're like yeah\nright\nthey're also good because they allow\nlike a lot of people who do have things\nlike social anxiety\num to start to form relationships so\nsometimes it's a lot more comfortable\nfor people like\nyou know so there's a lot of a lot of\ngood stuff there\nso dallas jsc is saying my family states\nthey want me to be with a girl who is a\n10 out of 10 on the scale of attraction\nand my last two exes apparently didn't\nreach that bar how to avoid how do i\navoid their influence on my\nrelationships you can't avoid their\ninfluence on your relationships you have\nto acknowledge it and counter it\nright so this is where like a lot of\npeople are looking for a solution of\navoidance how do i avoid\nthinking particular thoughts like your\nfamily's influence is going to be there\nright so what you've got to do is like\ncounter it\nyou know very practically you can sort\nof ask them\nwhy does\nlike what is the foundation of like a\nhealthy relationship in your mind\nwhat is what are the advantages of a 10\n10 10 out of 10 like what's the priority\nlist who determines 10 out of 10. you\ncan talk to him about all that stuff\nand you can also ask your family like if\ni'm happy with someone who's like a\nseven out of ten like what would you all\nthink about that how would what's wrong\nwith that\nand that's where they'll probably say\nthings like well it reflects poorly on\nus\ni see\nso the goal of my relationship is how it\naffects you that's your priority in\nterms of who i date which is how it\nmakes you look\nthanks for sharing that now i understand\nwhat's important to you\nwould you be surprised if my primary\ngoal in a relationship is not how it\nreflects on you socially\nwhat do you think about that\nand that's where they're going to get\nreal squirrely and they're not going to\nwant to say those things\nand the way that you talk to them is\ngoing to be open-ended questions and\nnon-judgmentalness and that's when\nyou'll sort of get all these weird\nimpressions\ninkbringer's asking my friend's\nboyfriend is hated by her family for\nsupposedly not being good enough for her\nand it's super toxic\nwhy can't family mind their business\nthey are minding their business\ntheir family is their business\nright think about it for a second\nmore practically you can set limits with\nthem\nand the other really crazy thing here\nis like\ni know it's shocking\nsometimes i'm not saying the sarcastic\nguy honestly sometimes\nyou when your family is concerned about\nthe person that you're dating like they\nmay know better than you do\nright sometimes they may know better\nwe just don't consider that possibility\nat all it's inconceivable that the\nperson that i have chosen to date\ni could be making some kind of mistake\nit's inconceivable that my family knows\nme better than i do it's inconceivable\nthat my parents who've watched me grow\nunderstand what my weaknesses are\nit's inconceivable that my parents who\nhave more experience at marriage than i\ndo\nunderstand what it takes to form a\nsuccessful healthy long-term\nrelationship more than i do and they're\nmaking a calculated guess and the\nconclusion that they come to is\ndifferent from my own\nthere's just this assumption that your\nfamily is wrong in that situation\nwhereas if we really think about it\nright now it's kind of weird we really\nthink about it like\nthey may actually know better than we do\nnow that has to be balanced a little bit\nbecause sometimes there's the\npresumption that since they have more\nexperience they know more than we do and\nthey do know better going back to the\nother person who's like you need a 10\nout of 10.\nso there's like some balance there where\nit's like they may know some things that\nwe don't they may be aware of some of\nour weaknesses and also they may have a\nset of priorities that we actually don't\ncare about\nso that's where like it's not like one\nis right or the other is right it's just\nwe have to be really self-reflective and\nhopefully communicate with them about\nwhat their concerns are and try to like\nlearn from their mistakes so that we\ndon't have to make them\nand at the same time like establish our\nown priorities from a calm centered\nplace where we can sort of like set\nlimits with our family it's tricky\nbut there's kind of this assumption that\ni know\nwhat i need for a successful\nrelationship whereas if you like really\nlook at it like that that's not an\nassumption that we necessarily know is\ntrue\ny'all get that\nlike sometimes like we're really bad at\npicking romantic partners\nthat's quite that's why the divorce like\nif we were so good at picking romantic\npartners i don't know that the divorce\nrate would be like 40 to 50 percent\nyeah rag az is asking signs a\nrelationship is beyond repair\none very simple sign\nthat your relationship is unsalvageable\nand is beyond repair\nand that's you're the only one who's\ntrying to repair it\nmost fundamental thing that is required\nfor relationships to be repaired is the\neffort of both of the people involved or\nmore if you're in an open relationship\nthat's the most consistent thing that i\nwould say\na relationship cannot be salvaged by one\nperson\nso\nramin rv is asking how about when your\nparents want you to marry with your\nculture within your culture religion\nwill disown you if you don't\nthat's where you have to decide what's\nmore important to you\nyour family disowning you\nor\nlike adhering to them and and not being\ndisowned like what's higher in the\npriority list for you disowning by your\nfamily or\nbeing with the person that you're with\nthe other thing\nso a lot of people who are faced with\nthis scenario have a very short sense of\ntime\npeople think disowning is forever\nwhereas i've seen this a lot where like\nif you're 24 disowning feels like a long\ntime your parents are like we're gonna\ndisown you\nand then like if you do it five years\nlater like you may be surprised at how\nmuch people are willing to come to the\ntable\nlike when you have grandkids\nand they're like\nyou know sometimes people will like mend\nthose fences\nsometimes the threat of disowning is\nlike you know stuff doesn't last forever\nand sometimes it does i'm not saying\nit's always going to be like that\nsometimes they just own units like screw\nthem and sometimes you don't want to\nrepair things but there's this\npresumption that if you disown someone\nyou disown them forever\nwhereas like honestly in my experience\nespecially when we've got these like\ncultural like these strong cultural\nvalues right families important families\nimportant family of support you marry\nsomeone and you're like all right you\ncan disown me\nand then like y'all may come to a new\ndynamic equilibrium where you've like\nset a particular boundary and they like\ncall your bluff and you call their bluff\nand then a few years later you're like\nwell we kind of miss each other and we\nkind of love each other and like you've\ngot a grandchild now and like do you\never want to meet them\ndoes that make sense\nyeah so drop stuff and then when they\nwant to reconnect you say no sure so you\ncan say no if you want to or you can say\nyes or you can say i'm not ready yet\nforever is a very very long time and\nhuman beings tend to change their mind\nso like don't worry about in a sense\ndon't worry about being disowned i'm not\nsaying that it's not gonna happen or\nthat they'll ever come back or that\nyou'll want them back but like\noftentimes especially when it comes to\nfamily i'm sure you all know this\nfamily members will make vows to each\nother\nwhich they\nrescind\nover time right never again\nif you ever do that again i'm done with\nyou forever\nand then like we're like eh\ni said forever but i didn't mean forever\nright like let's be honest like that's\npretty common\nright so your family disowns you oh yeah\nlike here's you have a grandson now\nhe's five years old and he's at the top\nof his class\nhe's he's in he's in math class with the\nseventh grader i mean with the\nseven-year-olds can you believe that do\nyou ever want to meet him he's such a\nsmart boy and he's so good at math\nhe's good at math like you are\nright\ngenes have a strong pull\nthe the the ties of family is what keeps\nyou bound but sometimes we as especially\nif we're the kid we don't realize\nthat it binds our parents all the same\npeople are saying manipulation yeah like\nthat's look\nif someone else shows up to the\nbattlefield with a sword like you've got\nto show up with a sword too right\nno i mean you guys call this evil i\ndon't think it's evil it's just if you\nguys have grown up i mean so this is my\nexperience as like an asian\nlike this is this it's not evil it's\nlike standard practice for asians\nemotional manipulation\nface saving moves you call it\nmanipulative because it's face saving\nright like you're giving you got to give\nyour parents like an out\nwhich is like oh like look at how like\ni'm giving you the opportunity to be\nproud you hate me because i married the\nwrong person but like you want to be\nproud of your kid who's good at math\nlet's set those two things side by side\nand let them war inside you\nright and then you come to the\nconclusion\nyeah so\nit's me again five is saying as an asian\nthis is survival i completely agree\nif you guys really want to get\nemotionally manipulated they say he's so\ntalented at math but i don't have the\ntime to teach him\nit would be really nice if you could\nteach him some math because i know\nyou're really good at it and he's so\ngifted\nthe nuclear bomb of manipulative\nrelationships that's it\nwhen people are saying oh like you're\nlike they're like oh find him a tutor oh\nyeah we have found him a tutor but just\nnone of them\nyou know he's just so smart he really\nneeds someone who's like exceptionally\ngood at this stuff to teach him\nright so like now suddenly it's like\nit's not because this is what happens\nlike you cut me off screw you\ni'm never going to talk to you again\ninstead no i need your help\npapa\ni need your help your grands child is so\nbright he needs you\nhere you'll get it like\nyeah like\nyou all can call it playing to the\nfamily ego\nright we can also call it face saving\nand even sun tzu talks about this\nsun tzu says always give your opponent\nan opportunity to escape\nalways give him an out\nsmart dude sun tzu\nall\nright okay\nlet's talk\nokay it's almost time you all want to\nmeditate for a little bit what are we\ndoing\nburp\ngrim thor third she's asking is alexa\ntime to be a concern in relationships\nabsolutely\nalexa thyme is a concern for you\nand if it's a concern for you it's a\nconcern in the relationship so lexitimi\nis the inability to understand your\ninternal emotional state you're\nessentially colorblind to your own\nemotions\nand it causes problems in relationships\nbecause you don't realize that your\nemotions are like influencing your\nbehavior\nand you can't vocalize them you can't\ntalk about them you can't process them\nand so like they like\nthey're almost like pulling strings from\nthe shadows and we never see the puppet\nmaster and it's very infuriating for\nboth you and your partner so it's a huge\nproblem in relationships\nyou"
