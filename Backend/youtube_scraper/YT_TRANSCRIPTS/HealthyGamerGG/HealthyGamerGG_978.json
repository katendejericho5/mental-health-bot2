    "transcript": "some data that shows that generally\nspeaking depression is more common in\nnorth america and europe\nbut there's there are caveats to that\nwhich is that the\ninterpretation of mental illness seems\nto be different in different cultures\nanalysis of the difference in mental\nhealth levels between western and more\ntraditional cultures\nrole of religions slash the lack of\ngreater life purpose it's a great\nquestion\nso\nwhat's the relationship between mental\nhealth problems in the west and in more\ni don't know what traditional culture\nmeans but let's assume\neast\num and what is the influence of religion\nand the lack of like\nwhat's the role of religion in this\nstuff so this is a really interesting\nquestion\nwhat's the relationship between mental\nhealth and culture and mental health and\nreligion\nso\nthere's a lot of evidence that shows\nthat\nexporting western culture\nleads to an increase in body dysmorphic\ndisorder in cultures that receive\nexported western culture\nso it looks like eating disorders\nespecially\nseem to flow with\nlike the exportation of western culture\nand at this point eating disorders may\nhave taken root in other places like\njapan or south korea or places like that\nso then they've started to like\npropagate as well on their own there\nthere's some data of that okay\nthere's also\nsome data that shows that generally\nspeaking depression is more common in\nnorth america and europe\nbut there's there are caveats to that\nwhich is that the\ninterpretation of mental illness seems\nto be different in different cultures\nso\nif you go if you take a standardized\ninstrument for depression like let's say\nthe back depression inventory or the\nphq-9 and i travel to like sudan\nwhat i may discover is that the rate of\ndepression in sudan is far lower than\nthe rate in the united states but that's\nbecause the instrument that we use to\ndetect depression\nwas developed in a particular cultural\ncontext and doesn't really capture\num\nsort of the cultural\nlike manifestation\nof depression in different cultures\nso the phenotype of depression what\ndepression looks like\nwill be different depending on what\nculture you're in so for example like in\nindian culture\nfeelings of depression are generally\nspeaking like will manifest is like odd\nphysical complaints\nso people will complain about upset\nstomach they'll complain about cognitive\nfogginess because the in the east the\nthe sort of the concept of a mental\nillness doesn't exist\nin the same way that it does in in\nwestern\nconception so conceptions of psychology\nare different\num so there does seem to be a cultural\nsort of like specificity there\nbut this is where if you do more\nadvanced research what you tend to find\nis that if we sort of say that\ndepression looks different\nin different cultures\nbut then if you tunnel down further okay\nif it looks this way over here and it\nlooks this way over here is the\npercentage of people who suffer from\nthese two things basically basically\ncomparable and the answer is like\ngenerally speaking yes\nso it looks like in the most nuanced and\nadvanced research on things like mental\nillness that they tend to be pretty\nconsistent worldwide\nnow that's got a bunch of caveats that\nwe've already gone over like so one is\nfor example the exportation of culture\nand the correlation with mental illness\nso that could be a factor there\num that also begs the question if if i\nhave vague physical symptoms\nversus mental symptoms and we're saying\nthat both of those are about let's say\n10 of the population\nare those different illnesses or are\nthey the same illness is that depression\nmanifesting this way in culture\nmanifesting physically in one culture\nand manifesting mentally in another\nculture or is it like two different\nillnesses it's a good question we have\nno blood test or no genetic test or no\nfinal test for depression so we don't\nreally know\nwe also know that for example the\ninstruments are culturally sensitive so\nif you move it to a different culture if\ni take the back depression inventory and\nthen i go administer it to people in in\nlike russia who knows how well it'll\ntranslate their experience of depression\nmay be different\nso the short answer is we're not really\nsure but chances are my sort of\nconclusion which is highly\ndisputable by the way is that generally\nspeaking if we look at the neurochemical\nprocesses that lead to mental illness\nthey tend to be pretty conserved across\nhumanity\nso we know that schizophrenia exists\neverywhere um but there's also other\nkinds of very interesting data like the\nthe likelihood of developing\nschizophrenia is greater if you're an\nimmigrant so schizophrenia is greater in\nimmigrant populations than it is in in\nlocal native populations which is just\nweird findings there's a lot of like\nstuff that we don't quite understand but\ngenerally speaking my take is that\nmental illness is pretty common\nthroughout all the whole world it just\nlooks differently in other places but it\nhas a root core problem i mean the core\nproblem is the same but it manifests in\ndifferent ways\nso next thing is what about religion\nso this is where i think for a long time\nreligion was used to address\nmental health right so i'm not\nnecessarily talking about mental illness\nbut if we look at the ways in which\npeople made sense of the world so if you\nlook at research on psychotherapy for\nexample\nthere are different types of\npsychotherapy but what we've discovered\nis that\npsychotherapy type a may not be better\nthan psychotherapy type b or c\nwhat leads to good treatment outcomes is\nnot which kind of psychotherapy that you\ndo\nbut the adaptness of your therapist in a\nparticular type of psychotherapy so if\ntherapist\none\nunderstands this kind of psychotherapy\nreally really well and therapist 2\nunderstands this kind of psychotherapy\nreally really well and therapist 3\nunderstands this kind of psychotherapy\njust a little bit a and b will be about\nequal and will outperform c\nso it's comfort within a particular\nsystem that seems to correlate to the\nbest treatment response and i think we\nsort of see that in religion as well so\nbefore we had psychotherapy\nreligion sort of handled this kind of\nstuff right so if you lost a loved one\nwho consoled you who helped you get past\nit who helped you with mourning it was\noftentimes a religious figure so there\nisn't a therapist so you don't go to a\ntherapist you'll go talk to a priest or\nsomeone who will help you make sense of\nthings just like we talked about earlier\nwill help you like integrate and\nunderstand the loss we'll help you cope\noh they're in heaven or they're they'll\nbe reborn or whatever you know whatever\nkinds of soothing things they'll say and\nas long as there's an internally\nconsistent system that that the person\nwho's consoling you is confident in\nand competent in that leads to positive\noutcomes\nnow the other thing is that religion was\nalso of a very good\num\nby good i mean like it was comprehensive\nand seemed to meet people's needs in\nterms of finding purposes and direction\nso religion would tell people what to\nbelieve and tell people generally\nspeaking what to do actually i don't\neven know if i agree with that that's\nmore judo judeo-christian religions that\ntend to be more commanding in nature\nright so they'll say like here's the ten\ncommandments do these things and don't\ndo these things whereas the karmic\nreligions are even different in that way\nthe karmic religions say there's karma\nyou can do whatever you want to but\nthere's cause and effect so your causes\nwill have particular effects and the\nvalue judgment actually comes from us it\ndoesn't come from the religion which is\nsort of a foreign concept\nbut there isn't like an intrinsic\nmorality\num\nwhich is also debatable\nso there's a lot of nuance and caveats\nhere so i do think that what's happened\nis that\nas we've seen the decline of religion\nwe've had to grapple with these\nquestions more\nnow that doesn't necessarily mean that\nrel the decline of religion is bad for\nhumanity it just means that\nif we're not trusting religion to give\nus the answers we've got to figure that\nstuff out on our own but the jury is\nstill out whether listening to religion\nor figuring it out on our own is better\nover time\nright so religion i think made things\nsimpler for for us and sort of simply\ndealt with things like mental health and\nmental illness\num but as we've like learned about\npsychotherapy and stuff it seems like we\ncan sort of target particular problems\nand develop interventions more\nspecifically for them as opposed to\nreligion which is like an amalgamation\nof all kinds of stuff right there's\nmorality baked in there's some amount of\nlike psychotherapeutic kind of\ninteractions kind of baked in going to\nchurch\nchurches have like support groups and\nsocial capital and like talking to the\npriest and like you know developing\nacceptance so for example we know that\nthat just developing acceptance is uh\nis good for your mental health like it\nleads to less suffering over time right\nthat's that's what acceptance and\ncommitment therapy is based on and\nreligion offers easy avenues to accept\nand surrender to god and things like\nthat\nbut it turns out that if you look at the\nscience it's not it's not the god\nthat seems to be important it's the fact\nthat you accept a god or surrender to a\ngod that leads to the therapeutic value\nnow people who are very religious will\ndispute that and they will say no no\nsurrounding tour a false god is bad for\nyou the god that you should surrender to\nis my god because my god is the real god\nso that's i'm not going to comment on\nthat if you believe that that's totally\nfine what i'm talking about is science\nso we know that the concept of\nacceptance which is something that\nreligion is taught acceptance and\nsurrender and stuff like that it's the\nwill of god right that's sort of where\nacceptance kind of comes in we can take\nthat concept we can remove it from\nreligion and we can apply it and it\nseems to have therapeutic benefit\nthe last thing that i'll sort of say is\nthat there are some religions um that\nreally do\nconsider mental health and mental\nillness\nvery very centrally so this is where my\npersonal bias may come in but i think if\nyou look at the karmic religions\nthere'll be this is where i think\nreligion really isn't even the right\nterm but it's sort of like a western\nconstruct but if you look at things like\npatanjali's yoga sutras\nit's\ntalks about how the mind works right so\nlike i'll give you guys an example so\nlet's grab\njust the top book on my shelf so this is\nthe geranda samita\nokay so this is commentary on the yoga\nteachings of maharishi maharishi geranda\nso this is like\nthis is presumably a religious leader\nright but if you look at like what he\nactually says\ni'm just going to like flip it open to a\nrandom\npage\nso let's go to page 371\nokay um the process of controlling the\nmind through the medium of the senses is\ncalled pratyahara\nin this chapter the knowledge of\npratyahara is imparted in brief by sage\ngaranda to his disciple king chanda\nkapali he begins with the description of\npatience\nby combining it with the senses his\nanalysis is based on the understanding\nthat patience is impeded by negative or\npositive feelings\nin the mind which arise due to the\nvarious experiences of the senses\nin his opinion if the mind is separated\nfrom those sensory feelings and\nexperiences their effects will\nautomatically stop\nin this way an internalized state of\nmind will be achieved\nso that doesn't sound like a religious\ntext\nright but if you look at a\na western conception\nthis person would be viewed as a\nreligious figure in the east\nbut i think that the the yogic\nperspective\nand like this karmic tradition is like\nvery very into\nhow the mind actually works the nature\nof suffering the nature of happiness the\nnature of thoughts and where they come\nfrom and so religio religion sort of\ntaught that right it was sort of viewed\nin the province of religion but even if\nyou look at like sort of the\nevidence-based effects of mindfulness\nthat is a religious practice quote\nunquote right it's not really a\nreligious practice because anyone can do\nit has nothing to do with belief but if\nyou look at like the origins of\nmeditation\nthey were in in the west what we would\ncategorize as a part of a religious\ntradition so buddhism is like we\nclassified as a religion and buddha was\nteaching people how to meditate and how\nto understand their minds so i do think\nthat this is what we're also seeing is\nthat as as we're\nunderstanding\nkind of like the value of some of these\nquote-unquote religious traditions we're\nremoving the religious peace from them\nand we're teaching them separately\nthere's a certain loss there because i\nthink that when we do that we tend to\ndiscard anything that we don't like as\nopposed to\nyeah so like we'll discard things for\nlike based on our own biases and\npolitical beliefs\nwhereas i think we're losing a lot of\ntherapeutic value there because we're\nlike yeah that sounds kind of shady\nright so we'll believe sentences\nsix seven eight nine and ten but we'll\njust sort of say like okay eleven is\nridiculous so we're not gonna do that\nand then what's happening over time is\nthe science on meditation is advancing\nright so remember like 50 years ago if\nyou said that meditation could be used\nas a treatment for mental illness people\nwould have called you a religious quack\nright they're like oh this guy's like\nhe's like a religious nut that's crazy\nthere's no way that meditation can help\nwith mental illness\nright so that's what people used to say\nand now we'll say certain things about\nmeditation like yeah i can help with\nmental illness but there will be other\nthings that will say oh that's\nabsolutely ridiculous\nso we've just moved the line and we're\nmoving it slowly as we sort of\nscientifically test things and stuff\nlike that so i do think that religion\nhas traditionally had a role in mental\nhealth and make having people make sense\nof the world although a lot of people\nwill connect the dots and will jump to\nthus it is a tragedy that people are\nmore agnostic or more atheistic today i\nwouldn't quite jump there like\nit's had a role and now arch our\nyou know as a religion sort of declines\nor people generally speaking become less\nreligious i don't think that's\nnecessarily a loss\nit just means that we have to figure out\nthe answers for ourselves\nyou"
