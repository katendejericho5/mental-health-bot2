    "transcript": "so that you can play this stupid game\nhour after hour after hour after hour\nand you never get bored\nand here's the thing that here's where\nthe colored helmet comes in\nbecause what are the game developers\nworried about\nonce you're in the game loop they've got\nyou\nonce you queue up for a game of dota\nyou're stuck in a game of dota if you\ndisconnect you're going to get reported\nright\nso they've got you in the game loop so\nwhen or when do the developers lose you\nbetween game loops so here's the crux of\nit\ni often spend hours grinding away at a\ngame for little to no reward but the\nminute i have to do actual work\neverything starts to suck\nso working for 30 minutes feels bad man\nand grinding in a game for eight hours\nfor slightly cooler helmets\nso how on earth does this work\nright why is it that like\nso we recognize\nthat when we\nwe recognize that\nwhen we grind for something in the in in\na game\nit doesn't actually have like real value\nright like we know that\nit's like hey this this helmet is\ndifferent or i get this kind of trophy\nand this helmet is a virtual item in a\nvirtual world and let's assume for a\nmoment we're not even getting bogged\ndown in like real world economies and\nauctioning it off for real money or any\nof that stuff let's just assume that\nthat's not even a part of\nand yet like when i grind for 30 minutes\nin real life that actually has a real\nbenefit\nand so you would think\nthat\nobviously since one thing means more\nlike in the real world since one thing\nhas real benefit and something has no\nbenefit\nwhy is it that\nlike\nwe why is it that i can game for eight\nhours but i\ncan't grind for 30 minutes in real life\nso a couple of different things to\nunderstand here okay\nthe first\nis going to be like something about game\ndevelopment so we're going to actually\ntalk about video games for a second and\nlike how they're developed and what\ndevelopers do\nsecond thing we're going to talk about\nis a little bit about like neuroscience\nand how that kind of works\nand then hopefully we'll come to some\nkind of conclusion about what to do\nabout this\nso i went to the game developers\nconference in san francisco a few months\nago it was a fantastic conference i\nreally enjoyed being there i talked to a\nbunch of game developers offered my own\nthoughts about sort of i was invited to\nspeak about creating positivity and\nstuff\nbut i sort of figured out like a couple\nof things that i had never really\nunderstood before\nso i got one interesting question so\nsomeone asked me\nhow do we so that just to give you all\nsome context so i was i was there\nspeaking about the psychology of\npositive gaming so how can you create a\ncommunity that's like positive\nin some way\nand so someone asked me a question\num\nactually let me give you all more\ncontext sorry so\nmy general answer was that most of the\nattempts to create positivity within\ngaming\nseem to be tacked on\nokay and so what do i mean by that that\nmeans that if you look at the way that a\ngame is designed\nthey design the game right so they like\nmake the game and they're like by the\nway we need a positive community\nso let's like implement some features so\nthey add like a reporting system or they\nadd like a cheering system or they add\nthey like add some system on at the end\nbecause someone\nup there with an mba is like hey\neveryone's into positivity and gaming\nright now like developers\nmake some positivity feature like let's\nmake the game positive\nand that that's when like you as a\ndeveloper you go to the the\nperson like you know you go to the\nperson who's telling you to build this\nfeature and you're kind of like well\nlike we can build something but the\ntruth is you know we probably need to\nthink about this bigger and like we may\nneed to rewrite some code they're like\nno no no no no no no rewriting code\nthat's too expensive forget about doing\nthis from the ground up this is the\nsixth iteration of the game that we're\nmaking all the code is already built\njust tack something on\njust hack it on we gotta implement some\npositivity let's do it\nand so\nthe positivity in the game is like not a\ncore feature of the game right it's like\nsomething that gets tacked on so like i\nthink actually dota does a good job of\nthis but let's just use dota as an\nexample so you like play the game of\ndota and then afterward you can commend\nsomeone or report someone\nbut it's not part of what they call the\ngame loop\nokay and this is really important to\nunderstand\nso someone asked me the question when i\nwas at the conference\nhow do we incorporate positivity into\nour core game loop\nand then there i am asking i was like\nokay that's interesting i have no idea\nwhat words you just used can you explain\nto me what the core game loop is\nand so this is where like this is the\ncrux of like video game development so\nespecially if you guys look at mobile\ngames you'll understand this very well\nwhat is the basic activity that you do\nfrom minute to minute or like for a set\nof minutes within a particular game\nthat's the core game loop\nand what's essentially done is like that\nprocess is optimized\nokay they optimize that process so that\nyou have the most engagement and you\nwill continue to engage in that loop\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain\nhere's the key thing the reward in the\nvideo game is not part of the core game\nloop do you all get that\nthis is what's so damn confusing because\nyou're like i don't understand why i'm\nplaying for eight hours for this colored\nhelmet you're not playing for eight\nhours for the colored helmet\nthe colored helmet is not actually part\nof the game\nit just happens at the end\nthe reason for the colored helmet is to\nget you to cue up into the core game\nloop again\nso all all really the helmet does is it\ncauses you to like enter the path\nand most of your time is spent in the\npath so this is the way to kind of think\nabout it\nhow much time do you spend queuing up\nversus playing the game and when you're\nactually playing the game you're not\nthinking about the helmet when do you\nactually think about the helmet you\nthink about the helmet when you finish a\ngame and the game shows you your\nprogress bar you have two out of five\nstars and once you get all five stars\nonce you get five wins for the day you\nget the color helmet\nwe have two stars so when does the the\nwhen does the\nhelmet enter your psychology it enters\nwhen you click play\nbut you're not playing for eight hours\nfor the helmet the only time you're\nplaying for the helmet is when you click\nthe play button and then you enter the\ncore game loop and you lose an hour\nbecause that core game loop is designed\nwith so much sophistication that you're\ngoing to lose a whole hour\nhands down\nright there's going to be the like\nwhatever it is and you'll see this a lot\nin mobile games where like if you think\nabout the level design for all these\nlike you know different games where you\nbust stuff\nright like you're like\npopping things and\npopping i don't even know what to call\nlike all these games where you like\nslide your finger across stuff and you\nlike break crap\nyeah like fruit ninja or whatever right\nlike whatever like if you think about\nthat like what's the core game loop\nthere like once you enter\nit's kind of like you board a train and\nthe only time to disembark is it like at\nthe station you're stuck you can you\ndon't stop in the middle\nand these core game loops are designed\nwith a lot of sophistication so people\nfigure out like what's the right amount\nof squishiness\nto add what's the right amount of color\nwhat's the right amount of like feedback\nright when you act within the game\nyou'll see a burst of color you'll hear\na satisfying sound you'll even have\nvibration which i personally find hella\nannoying in controllers\nyou'll get all this feedback that keeps\nyou ensconced within this game loop\nand so the reason that you spend eight\nhours is not for the colored helmet it's\nbecause of the sophistication of the\ngame loop and what do i mean by\nsophisticated\nover the last 30 years\ndevelopers have figured out which game\nloop keeps you the most engaged they\nfigured out what level of color\nsaturation do you need how much sound\nhow much music what kind of music do you\nneed how often do we need to update the\nterrain so your brain does not get bored\nof the seeing the same old thing over\nand over and over again\nhow often do we need to release patches\nso that people get interested in the\ngame and they'll engage in the core game\nloop again\nright so even things like balance\npatches people want to mix it up right\nwhy do they want to mix it up they want\nto mix it up so that it stays fresh and\nif it stays fresh you're going to enter\nthe game loop over and over and over\nagain\nso even if you look at these like you\nknow these mobile games where you're\nkind of like doing you know one level\nand then the next level and the next\nlevel and the next level they're like\n600 levels\nbut every 42 levels there's a new\nmechanic\nright there's like something else you\nhave to pop it twice you have to slash\nit twice it explodes and then they give\nyou different like bomb things that you\ncan pop and this thing that you can pop\nthey make like modifications\nmodifications modifications so that you\ncan play this stupid game\nhour after hour after hour after hour\nand you never get bored\nand here's the thing that here's where\nthe colored helmet comes in\nbecause what are the game developers\nworried about\nonce you're in the game loop they've got\nyou\nonce you queue up for a game of dota\nyou're stuck in a game of dota if you\ndisconnect you're going to get reported\nright\nso they've got you in the game loop so\nwhen or when do the developers lose you\nbetween game loops\nright so when when i am done with this\nround and i'm bored of playing the game\nwhat i'm gonna do is switch to another\ngame\nand then someone realized oh my god\npeople will play two rounds of our game\nand they'll get really really frustrated\nwith it\nbut\nif we make them play five games and we\ngive them a colored helmet they won't\nswitch between game loops\nthat's where the colored helmet comes in\nokay\nnow the next thing to think about is\nlike this question remember if we go\nback to the original question does that\nmake sense people\nso\nworking for 30 minutes\nnow here's the problem so what i want\nyou all to think about\nis what is the equivalent of the core\ngame loop for this\nso if i sit down to study for my algebra\ntest\nor my pre-calculus test\nwhat is a five-minute experience of that\nlike\ntorture\npure torture in fact it is the very\nopposite of the game loop because the\nsecond i start studying all i want to do\nis enter the core game loop that is\ngoing to be like makes me lose an hour\nyou all get that so that it's it's sort\nof like it's not a false equivalency but\nthe fo the focus of what keeps the\ndifference between these experiences\nsorry i gotta find my words\nthe difference between these experiences\nhas nothing to do with the reward at the\nend\nbecause we've already established that\nthe reward at the end should lead to the\nopposite behavior i should be studying a\nlot more and playing a lot less because\nthe helmet doesn't matter whereas in a\nactually matters\nso what explains the behavior it's not\nthe reward\nit's actually the core experience of the\nactivity\nso studying calculus for five minutes is\nfriggin boring\nand even though an a is worth more to me\non a test\nthen\nyou know some colored helmet in a game\nthat i'm not even gonna play for six\nmonths from now\nlike\ni can't grind in real life and that's\nbecause the activity the actual activity\nthe actual\ngameplay of real life is not rewarding\nat all\nthere's no squishiness\nthere's no sounds like whenever you get\nan algebra problem right whenever you\nsolve a calculus problem right there's\nno there's no reward\nthere's not like a like a you know a\nflop\nand a star there's nothing nothing on\nthe dude this my text textbook doesn't\neven change color\nlike what the hell the page doesn't even\nturn itself\nright like\ni don't even get any stars when i get an\nalgebra problem right\nlike what is this boomer stuff i gotta\nturn the page myself\ni have to pick which problem you go to\nyour you go to the back where you've got\nyour like you know 16 problems there's\nlike 16 it's like a pile of random\nproblems\nthat's not how it works in a game in a\ngame they give you one and it's flicking\nbing bing\nclick it let's go next level\nand then you see\nclick it and what i'm just supposed to\nlike look at this algebra textbook and\njust do one freaking boring problem\nafter another boring problem and the\nsecond i get it right whether i get it\nright or i get it wrong there's no\ndifferential and reward\ni don't even know if i got it right or\nwrong like why am i even doing this\nfreaking algebra problem like i don't\neven know if it's right or wrong\nwhat are you telling me you're telling\nme that i have to flip to the back of\nthe book and look up the answer and what\nthe hell is this crap only half only the\nodd number\nquestions have answers half the answers\nare even missing where's the dlc where\ndo i pay the extra money for that\ny'all get this\nso the grind in real life is not\noptimized to be fun\nnow here's where the here's where the\nneuroscience comes in and it's short\ni mean it's complicated we could talk\nfor years about it if you wanted to but\nhere's the thing\nthere are parts of your brain that can't\ntell the difference\nokay so we have like the cortical\ncenters of our brain our cerebral cortex\nis what makes us human\nit gives us you know the sense of\nidentity and it gives us actually even\npartially even that not it doesn't even\ngive us that that's\npart of our primitive brain it gives us\nhigh order thinking and higher order\nfunctions and all this kind of stuff\nand then we've got our primitive parts\nof the brain that are like ooh shiny\nooh color\nlike you know that when like you know\nwhen you like\nif you see a piece of jewelry\nand it looks\nlike vivid and colorful you're like wow\nlike we as human beings universally\nrevere certain kinds of objects like\nstuff that's shiny we're like friggin\nmagpies\nso if you have a sparkly something like\nyour eyes are gonna look at it\nright this is like primitive crap\nwe like particular things we like things\nthat are colorful and a little bit\nsquishy\nright so if you play games like you know\nall this like chibi stuff and jelly\nsplash and like there's like a certain\nyou know\nthat we just like\nright like we think babies are cuddly we\nthink like babies from all species of\nanimals like cute baby deer cute baby\nkitty cute baby puppy\nwe're attract like it's like a primitive\nthing\nand now what the video game does is like\nit\nactivates all that crap it takes\nadvantage of all that that crap\nif you look at the font in your algebra\ntextbook it's not like a chibi font\nit's like\nyou know times new roman\nwhich is like\nwe're not into that\nand so the tricky thing is that you know\nthe higher order functions of our brain\nthat tell us oh yeah an a is worth more\nto you than a colored helmet that's true\nbut on the deeper order functions of the\nbrain like the stuff that regulates like\nhunger and thirst and like that kind of\nstuff\nlike a basic sense of like enjoyment and\nattraction to color and like\nyou know the parts of our brain that's\nmore like a bot\nthose things can't tell the difference\nbetween the two\nso the higher order value that we apply\nthe abstract value that we applied to a\ngrade\nversus a colored helmet that may be able\nto tell the difference but the deeper\nparts of our brain can't tell the\ndifference\nso success in a video game activates\nthis is not a real circuit it's just\nsomething it's like an emergent\nphenomenon so you know many years ago i\ngave this lecture on this thing called\nthe triumph circuit which goes to\nthere's science there but it's basically\nthis idea that we have this human uh you\nknow some psychologists came up with\nthis concept called intent to mastery\nand what they were looking at they made\na really interesting observation which\nis that\nkids drop things all the time but they\nnever get fed up of dropping things\nso if you take a six-month-old that like\nliterally cannot hold stuff\nright\nthey'll like try to pick it up and they\njust keep dropping it and an adult\nwill get frustrated after trying\nsomething over and over and over again\nand like not\nsucceeding will give up but kids who\ncan't do stuff like walk like a kid\ncan't walk but they keep trying keep\ntrying they'll fall 50 times 60 times\nand mind you they're falling\na hundred times and they'll keep trying\nuntil they get it right what on earth is\ngoing on\nand what they discovered is this is part\nof our brain or psychology that they\ncall intent to mastery that all human\nbeings have an intrinsic drive to master\nsomething that's difficult\nnow what happens\nthis is why kids learn how to walk\nokay in short\nwhat happens with video games is they\ntap into this primal sense of intent to\nmastery more so than the abstract goals\nthat we have in real life\nso our algebra textbook does not tap\ninto intent to mastery\nthe way that\nvideo games do\nand this is what i kind of call the\ntriumph circuit we basically got this\nthis part of our brain\nthat values triumph\nso what we value in human society is\nadversity followed by victory\nthe person that we celebrate the most is\nthe one who struggled and then was\nsuccessful not the person who was handed\neverything on a silver platter and then\nthey like you know\ni'm a billionaire today and my path to\nsuccess was i started a business i\ninherited two billion dollars from my\nparents and i started a business and\ntoday i'm worth one billion dollars go\nme\nthat's not what we celebrate\nright\nwhat we celebrate is the person who\nrises through adversity\nand so then we look at even games like\nfrom software i think is the best\nexample of this\nor cuphead or whatever\nand the games that we enjoy playing\nare the ones that are challenging this\nis why video game developers have\nfigured this out\nthat like why do we even have\nmatchmaking\nlike why do we pair people up it's\nbecause challenge followed by triumph is\nwhat we enjoy the most\nbut where's the challenge in triumph in\nour my algebra textbook compared to\nsomething like playing a game of dota\nso this is what happens this is why like\nthis you know\nwhy is this so accurate\nbecause game developers have figured out\ni don't even know that they did research\nbut i think this happens organically it\nhappens like kind of like evolution\nwhere someone creates a game and then\nthey add a feature and then that game\ngets really really big\nand then a bunch of games\nadd that feature because they're like oh\npeople like this feature\nso a good example of this is also like\nif you look at you know games are souls\nlike now right what does that mean that\nmeans that when you die you drop your xp\nthere\nwhich is a terrible feature\ni don't know if you guys\nremember but i remember when i first\nstarted playing dark souls i was so\ninfuriated by this feature what do you\nmean i lose my xp this is bs f this and\nnow half the games you make do it this\nis what happens they figure out\nthat xp feels so much more to you in\nyour primitive frigging brain\nthat which we can lose and we don't take\nfor granted means more to us\nand that's like a feature of like human\npsychology\nright we value that which we can lose\nand miyazaki figured that out and now\nyou see a bunch of people doing the same\ndamn thing\ndo you all get that\nso why does it feel so real because it\nis\nbecause games have game developers are\nfiguring out i don't think this is\nnefarious i don't think it's necessarily\nmalicious there are people out there who\nare malicious but i think this is just\nsomeone like you know i don't think\nmiyazaki's out there trying to take\nadvantage of our neuropsychology i think\nhe's out there trying to create a truly\nlike intensive and triumphant gaming\nexperience which i think he does\nthat's what they're going by right so\nmost game developers what they at least\nthe ones i've worked with\nwill will try to make the game that they\nthemselves wanted to play\nthey're like i would love to play a game\nthat dot dot dot\nbut if you even think about it where\ndoes that love for a video game come\nfrom it comes from i've played this game\nthat scratches these five\nneuroscientific itches but is missing\nthis itch in this itch\nso i'm gonna make a game that includes\nthese five things and tax on this\nand tax on a community element and tech\ntax on some kind of progression\nand tax on this\nand so over time this is what's\nhappening games are getting more and\nmore engaging\nthree years ago\njust to summarize\nthree years ago\ni went to the american psychiatric\nassociation i said hey i think video\ngame addiction is a huge problem\ni think we should take this stuff more\nseriously\nthe response that i got was nice they\nsaid\nit sounds like you're really on to\nsomething but we don't have the\nbandwidth because we have an\nopiate crisis here in this country and\nthat's where all of our energy is\nthat year i submitted an abstract\nto present at the national conference\nand the abstract was declined\nbecause they had more important things\nto worry about\nso this year we presented something at\nthe apa conference but more interesting\nthere were four sessions that i could\nsee that were related to video game\naddiction this year\nso this problem is getting\nworse about 10 or 12 years ago\nabout six percent of people were\nworldwide were addicted to video games\nsix percent of people 10 years ago\nnow the number is closer to 11 percent\nso this is getting worse\nand like that's because the games are\ngetting better\nright and the better the games get\nthe more true this becomes\nso be careful\nso coffin rock 15 is saying bs games are\ncrap now\nyes they are you are correct\nso this funny thing is that i actually\nagree with that\nand more people are playing them and why\nis that why are games getting worse and\nmore people playing them total amount of\ntime played is increasing\nwhy is that\nit's because people are figuring out how\nto scratch your itch your\nneuroscientific itch and it's not about\ncreating\na brilliant game anymore it's not about\ncreating a game that is\nbased on making it as fun as possible\nit's about creating games that are\ngeared towards engagement\ntowards play time\nright\nso you're right that games are in some\nways getting worse and they're getting\nmore addictive\nand half bunny's saying it's exhausting\nyou're damn right but boy do you gotta\nkeep playing\nsleeping with this 108 is saying seven\nthousand hours of dota still need more\nyep\nfrustrating but rewarding\njust like life is supposed to be\n789\nfrustrating but rewarding\nright because that's what our brain\nloves\nyou"
