    "transcript": "the problem is that when we're operating\nfrom ego and when we're driven by ego\nthe ego controls the emotion and the\nlogic so we end up doing things that are\nnot good for us so we had a great\ninterview a couple maybe about a year\nand a half ago with someone who was like\ndealing with a lot of burnout and this\nprogrammer was very successful so they\ngo home on Friday they would work on the\nproblem all weekend long there's a team\nof developers and then they come in on\nMonday morning with the solution so\ninstead of getting a weekend they do the\nwhole team's work over the course of the\nweekend and then they come in burnt out\non the weekend but man everyone is like\nholy crap this is great thank you for\nsolving this problem and they feel so\ngood from that positive enforcement it\nfeels good to be the hero but the hero\nis an aspect of my ego so what happens\nwhen I operate from ego I want to be\nsomething is it causes us to make\ngenerally speaking unhealthy trades I\ndon't want to disappoint my boss I want\nmy boss to love me I want my boss to\nrespect me so I'm never going to say set\na boundary with them yeah that makes\nsense"
