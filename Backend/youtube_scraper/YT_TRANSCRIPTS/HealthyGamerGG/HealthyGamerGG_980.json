    "transcript": "you're like okay where do when do i\nstart seeing human beings is\nfundamentally compassionate when do i\nstart to love myself sure i have like\nreduced my symptoms of depression i've\nreduced my symptoms of anxiety but i\nstill don't have this like\nself-worth that like these meditators\nseem to have\nwhen do i get that\nall right this is kind of like\ni personally wanted to talk about this\nhopefully it'll be helpful it'll be kind\nof interesting\nso let's take a quick look at\nunderstanding what meditation actually\nis and how it works\nso i've been meditating only for several\nweeks but i see temporary results every\ntime i meditate is this placebo effect\nmy laziness is gone i feel more myself i\nbecome more sensitive to sounds i feel\nmore independent so to speak this lasts\nfor probably an hour am i the only one\nfeeling this is this a placebo effect\nin related i meditated one hour per day\nfor 365 days and here's why i stopped\nafter a year\ni was thinking about improving my how to\nimprove my character in general\num\ni had nothing in mind that i wanted to\nchange about myself i knew basically\nnothing about meditation and reckon it\nwas something some sort of superpower of\nthe mind\nso rather spontaneously i committed to\nmeditate one hour a day for a year the\nremarkable effects on my life meditation\nsessions began to be enjoyable beautiful\nparts of my day the peace of mind and\nclarity i experienced were priceless\nin social interactions i felt much\ncalmer all of a sudden i was recognizing\nconsciously so many social cues that\ngive that people give all the time\ni surely reacted to those cues before i\nhaving started meditation but now it\nbecame conscious the reason i stopped\nin some sense my initial motivation of\nlearning meditation as a superpower of\nthe mind was satisfied\ni got to see how my perception and scope\nof consciousness expanded however\nmeditation alone will not make you a\ngood person it's not a one time one\none type fits all solution\nand for me personally it felt like i\nshould focus on other things\nvery glad i did this deep dive because\nnow i know the power of this tool and\nwhenever i should need it in my life i\ncan return to daily practice\nso\nthat's kind of weird\nright so like how does this work because\nhere's this person who's sort of saying\nmy laziness is gone i feel more like\nmyself this person is saying okay my\nsocial interactions are better\nit's sort of a superpower of the mind so\nwhat does meditation do\nand how does it work\nbecause a lot of times the challenge is\nthat you'll read posts like this right\nyou'll see like oh wow like this person\nwas more like calm in social\ninteractions this person like their\nlaziness is gone like that's awesome oh\nmy god\nyou'll also hear people say like oh like\ni transform like i'm a completely\ndifferent person after i started\nmeditating\nmeditation has changed my life has\nrevolutionized who i am as a person\ni gain so much perspective\nother people will talk about oh\nmeditation like helped me overcome my\nanxiety so if you're there's kind of\nscratching your head and you're like\nhow does this meditation stuff work what\ndoes this mean like we don't talk about\nenlightenment right it's like what is it\nwhat does that even we stop talking\nabout it like people just stop talking\nabout it at some point but that's like\nsort of like in the background like i've\nheard of this thing\ni know that's sort of what buddha was\nabout but like everyone's like yeah i'm\nkind of like i'm spiritually buddhist\noh like do you know what enlightenment\nno\nmindfulness\nwell like\nno one knows like what the hell is the\ndeal with meditation is it is it a\ntreatment for anxiety is it some way to\ntransform your personality is it a way\nto get lit rid of laziness for an hour\nlike what what happens\nlike what's the deal here\nokay so let's try to understand this\nso\nthe way that i'd explain this is\nmeditation works on three different\nlevels\nit works on the eight-minute level\nthe eight-week level\nand the eight-month level\nand then arguably eight years if you\nwant to go that far\nokay\nso the first thing that we know that\nmeditation does is on the eight-minute\nlevel so people will say when i meditate\ni feel good for the duration of the\nmeditation or soon afterward\nso what effects in the physiology and in\nneuroscience\nfunction on the level of eight minutes\nso this is where we sort of get\nautonomic\nnervous system\nso meditation will do things like\nadjust our respiratory rate\ngenerally speaking we'll lower our pulse\nwe'll lower our blood pressure generally\nspeaking we'll reduce cortisol\nand adrenaline\nand activate\nthe parasympathetic nervous system which\nis usually what it does for people\nbut it can also activate the sympathetic\nnervous system\nwhich in turn will lead to\nthings like\nreduced laziness\nmore motivation\nand this in turn will\ndo things like decrease anxiety\ndecrease insomnia\nright it'll help us sleep it'll help us\nchill out so this is physiologic in\nnature\nso we know that when we meditate on the\norder of minutes\nyour physiology will change\nthings like hormone hormone balances\nwill change your sympathetic nervous\nsystem parasympathetic nervous system\nwill switch there's also what's\nconfusing for some people some people\nsay it improves my anxiety some people\nsay it improves my laziness how can it\ndo both it kind of wakes me up it kind\nof calms me down that's the cool thing\nabout meditation it tends to balance\nyour sympathetic and your\nparasympathetic nervous system\nnow\nover the course of eight weeks what\nstarts to happen we start to see\nclinical benefits\nso what's going on here\nso eight weeks is where we also start to\nsee neuroscience changes\nso for example when we reduce our\ncortisol\ncortisol is a stress hormone\nis a stress hormone that acts for about\nfour to 24 hours\nand it's kind of like a steroidal\nhormone\nwhich means that it alters\nit travels into our cells and alters\ngene transcription\nso it like builds cellular machinery\nso what that sort of does is it like i\ndon't know how to say this it's not just\na temporary effect\nit constructs the machinery that our\ncells will use over the next day two\ndays three days so when we meditate on a\nconsistent basis\nour cells literally start to function in\nlike a different way\nand as they start to function in a\ndifferent way we'll start to see\nneuroplastic changes so over the course\nof eight weeks we'll see strengthening\nof the frontal lobes\nokay so what does this mean our frontal\nlobes are the breaks of the brain\nso what they do is they'll like calm\ndown our emotions\nuh inhibition\nso they they allow us to like behave\nless reactively you know when we sort of\nsay like take a step back\nlike i got caught up in this and i\nwasn't able to take a step back or i was\nable to take a step back or the frontal\nlobes also do things like reduce\nimpulsivity\nand people with adhd we sort of know\nthat people with adhd have poor\nfrontal lobe control on other parts of\ntheir brain\nso people with adhd for example get more\nemotionally dysregulated more easily\nand they're unable to control their\nimpulses\nso we start to see is these\nthat essentially we start becoming let's\nsay like let's just use the example of\nemotional reactivity\nso we know that in eight weeks of\nmeditation we can see clinical benefits\nin anxiety\nand what does that mean\nso generally speaking we'll look at like\nfor example gad generalized anxiety\ndisorder so that means that human beings\nare less impacted by their anxiety so if\ni have a clinical anxiety disorder my\nanxiety keeps me from doing things like\ngoing to a party or when i go to a party\nthe anxiety becomes so strong that it\ntakes control of me and then i react to\nthe emotion either i rush out the door\nor i don't go in the first place or i\nfeel overwhelmed or whatever\nso our emotional reactivity\nis high in the case of a generalized\nanxiety disorder and when we meditate\nthis decreases\nand how does that decrease it's because\nour frontal lobes are getting stronger\ninhibiting our emotions\nokay so what does this mean this means\nthat i can go to parties\nif i'm less emotionally reactive it also\nadjusts social things now this is this\nis the piece where things i think people\nsort of lose sight of how does\nmeditation transform your life over the\ncourse of eight months or eight years\nhow does it cause you to be a different\nperson this stuff we understand really\nwell scientifically\nnow if you behave less emotionally\nreactively imagine what that does for\nlet's say a romantic relationship\nso let's say your partner doesn't text\nyou or doesn't respond to your text\nin 24 hours\nand you really need their help\nif you behave if you give in and you\nhave a high amount of emotional\nreactivity\nyou feel really upset\nyou yell at your partner you're like i\ncan't believe like you were i'm always\nthere for you i always respond to your\ntexts you don't respond to my texts you\ndon't care right so as you as you\nincrease your emotional reactivity\nit negatively impacts the relationship\nand then what happens is eventually if\nthe let's assume that the emotional\nreactivity is so bad you attack them for\nnot responding to you say you don't care\nabout me i'm always there for you you're\nnever there for me this leads to a\nbreakup\nthree months later you're dating someone\nelse\nromance\nnumber two\nyou still have this emotional reactivity\nthey don't respond to your texts within\n24 hours\nyou say the same thing\ni'm there i always answer my texts you\nknow anytime you you need me i'm there\nfor you but when i need you you're not\nthere for me\nnegatively impacts the relationship\nbecause you start attacking them because\nit's not it's not just necessarily your\nfault right so even if they did they\nforgot to pick you up at the airport\nlet's say let's say they actually made a\nmistake that we can all agree on\nbut then what happens is like you react\nto them so emotionally like what happens\nwhen other people attack you\nyou get defensive you attack back you\nhit back\nright so emotional reactivity is like\nnot healthy generally speaking in\nrelationships\nand so as this happens a third time\nin a fourth time\nyou start all these get put together\nand then you start to form beliefs\nso this is where in cbt we talk about\ncore beliefs\nor schemas\nright and generally speaking like human\nbeings will have repeated experiences\nand as we form as we have repeated\nexperiences we start to formulate\nconclusions about the world\nand so what this person will conclude is\ni'm there\nfor people\nbut\nthey\nare never\nthere\nfor me\nthey'll conclude things like people are\nuntrustworthy\nthey'll conclude these kinds of things\nthen they'll go living their life over\nthe next one year\ntwo years\nthree years\nwith this belief\nas they live with this belief plus the\nemotional reactivity\nromantic relationship number five six\nand seven are screwed\nbecause now you're going into the\nrelationship fundamentally believing\nthat people are untrustworthy plus the\nemotional reactivity oh there it is\nagain i knew it\ni knew it it almost becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy\nand this is what happens in people's\nlife\nright we tend to make the same mistakes\nover and over again we feel trapped by\nour circumstances\nso a good example of this is like\ni believe that my partner is cheating on\nme\nand then i ask them hey are you cheating\non me no i check their phone because i\ndon't believe them\nbecause people are cheaters\nas i check their phone\ni get away with the first time don't get\naway with it get away with the second\ntime third time fourth time then they\nfind out that i'm snooping damage is the\ntrust\nand then like eventually like i\nemotionally drive them away they start\nconnecting to someone else on an\nemotional level i knew it\nthey're having an emotional affair\nwe break up\nthree months later they're dating that\ndamn i knew that i knew it was true all\nalong\nbecomes a self-fulfilling prophecy\nand this is what happens in our life\nright so like people don't make new\nmistakes every single day\nwe tend to make the same mistakes over\nand over and over again\nthese are mistakes around self-worth\nlike i'm you know i don't care about\nmyself i don't know how to love myself i\nhave difficulty overcoming my anxiety i\nprocrastinate we tend to make the same\nmistakes over and over and over again\nso this shapes our life\nright on the order of magnitude if we're\ntalking talking about the time this is\neight months or even eight years\nand if you look at people who are like\nnarcissistic for example like this is a\nclassic example\nof they emotionally react to things\nas people get upset with them for their\nemotional reactions what they'll start\nto do is like\nform narcissistic belief structures\ntheir narcissistic belief structures\ndrive people away\nand then they form these conclusions\nlike no i can't no one in the in the\nworld loves me like i'm always the\nvictim no one cares about me as a person\ny'all get that\nso\nwhat does meditation have to do with\nthis\nlet's go back to eight weeks\nso if i reduce\nemotional\nreactivity\nif i strengthen my frontal lobes\nright because that's how long it takes\nto make these kind of neuroscientific\nchanges and specifically we're talking\nabout is the frontal lobe being able to\ninhibit the amygdala\nso this is not like a personality change\nthis is literally like being able to\ntake a step back from your emotions and\nnot letting them control you in the\nmatter of minutes\nso for a five minute time span when your\nemotions would have taken control you\nprevent them from taking control and you\nremain calm and collected\nwhat impact does that have on your\nrelationships\nwhat impact does that have if you don't\nlash out hate and you can communicate\nwith people more calmly for relationship\nnumber one they didn't answer your text\nhey by the way i texted you a day ago\nand like you know i texted you a couple\nother times and you didn't get back to\nme like what's going on\nis everything okay\ninstead of immediately jumping to some\nkind of emotional hurt which is like\nthis person doesn't care about me what's\ngoing on\nis something going on by the way\ni know it's kind of like an like a\nlittle frustrating thing that i'm\nworking on but i'm like really sensitive\nto when people don't get back to me on\ntext\nso like i don't know if you've noticed\nbut i always make it a point to try to\nrespond to your text if you ask me\nanything and i'm like particularly\nsensitive to this\ni'm gonna do my best working on it\nand thank you for letting me know that\nyou were actually completely stressed\nout and that like this other crap was\ngoing on in your life i had no idea\nand i understand now why you didn't text\nme\nbecause you approach the conversation\ncalmly\nyou don't react\nemotionally\nyou foster communication\nright and so if you do all these things\nand you listen to them\nand you like are open-minded they're\ngoing to be open minded as well so\ninstead of going on the attack and them\nsort of becoming defensive you're kind\nof like looking at things more calmly\nright you're coming across as more\nreasonable you guys problem solve\ntogether\nand then what does that change so how\ndoes that alter the course of your\nrelationship\nright\nso then suddenly\nno breakup\ni'm oversimplifying here for a minute\nbut it's like oh wow like people\nactually like acknowledge that i have\nneeds and stuff like that and they're\nable to like try to accommodate those\nand so over time let's say that\neventually you do break up\nand then you enter relationship two and\nthe same thing happens\nthere's conflict\nyou reduce your emotions\nor your emotional reactivity it's not\njust\nreducing the experience of emotions\nyou're not numbing them you're not\nreacting to them so you're still feeling\nthem you're acknowledging them you're\nnoticing them and you're keeping them in\ncontrol\nand then what happens is you communicate\nbut then somewhere along the way if we\nlook at this like\nyou know the beliefs that people are\nforming uh that you're forming over here\nas relationship two happens as\nrelationship three happens as\nrelationship four happens the beliefs\nthat you're forming based on these\ninteractions are actually different\nbecause as you have these calm\ninteractions with people you can start\nto like\nassign different reasons it's not that\npeople are untrustworthy it's that\nsometimes\npeople\nwant\ndifferent\nthings\nright and break up two happens\nand break up three happens and then you\nconclude people change\nso the kinds of beliefs\nthat you start to form\nonce you stop reacting to people\nemotionally change\nright so the way that you communicate\nwith this person you don't like stick\nthem in a corner and i don't know if you\nguys like have friends who will\nput you in a corner through their\nbehavior\nlike i i don't know if that sort of\nmakes sense but i'm kind of envisioning\nlike there's some people for example in\nrelationship dynamics that will like\nlove to bear their cross\nand they'll always play the victim\nand like if you're always like if you\nhave someone in your life who's always\nplaying the victim they kind of force\nyou into being the bad guy\nand the more that they force you into\nbeing the bad guy they keep you in the\nrelationship through guilt but they\ndon't actually build a healthy\nrelationship\nand then eventually you pull away\nbecause you can't deal with that crap\nanymore and then that person gets their\nbeliefs reinforced oh people like people\nabandon me\nand then they drive the next person\ncrazy until they abandon them and they\ndrive the next person crazy until they\nabandon them\nand then they like end up with this core\nbelief that like people are always gonna\nabandon me\nwhat they don't realize is that they\nhave a hand in it\nwhat they don't realize is that they\nhave control over it and so when you end\nup with this conclusion that the world\nis an unwinnable place i'm playing an\nunwinnable game\nthat's devastating and leads to\nhopelessness and you lose perspective on\nlife and life sucks\nand then when you do something as simple\nas meditate\nat the eight week mark you can control\nyour emotional reactivity a little bit\nbetter as you control your emotional\nreactivity as you become aware of your\ninternal emotional state and you\nvocalize that in a way that's calm and\nnot emotionally reactive it alters the\ndynamic of your relationships as it\nalters the dynamic of relationships the\nlessons that you learn from those\nrelationships start to be different\nthis in turn\nalters\nyour\nworld view\nalters your core beliefs\ni am a good person i am lovable if\nsomeone leaves me\nit's not because i'm fundamentally\nbroken\npeople can have all kinds of reasons to\nleave a relationship with me\nyou all get that and so now we get to\nthe eight-month mark\nso this too is a neuroscience change\nbecause we know that core beliefs and\nschemas are represented in the brain\nsomewhere\nright it's not doesn't map onto a\nperfect circuit but like\nsomewhere in our association courtesies\nyou know like we know that personality\nis ensconced in the brain and that core\nbeliefs are ensconced in the brain\nsomewhere and so we start to see these\nkinds of things and then if you do this\nfor eight years\nthen suddenly like you see the world\ndifferently like you have hope\nright because people don't fundamentally\nabandon you because you're a bad person\nyou don't believe that\nand so then what it does is alters your\noutlook\non life\nso then you're not a doomer\nanymore you're someone who has hope\nyou're someone who's like compassionate\nand why are you compassionate\nbecause you have empathy\nwhy do you have empathy because over\n10 relationships\nyou've learned how to not be emotionally\nreactive communicate with the other\nperson in a healthy way and have been\nable to see like the positive humanity\nin them\nright\nand then you become like a different\nhuman being\nbecause you just see the world in a\ncompletely different way and this is\nwhat's so confusing because when people\ntalk about stuff like this like i can\nsay meditation transformed my life\ni can say that a big part of dr k was\nborn after seven years of meditating and\nlike studying in different oceans in\nindia\nand then you're kind of sitting there\nscratching your head because when you\nmeditate for eight minutes\nand you're seeing this change you're\nlike where the hell is the personality\nchange like\nand then you do it for a month\nbut you haven't hit the eight week mark\nand so then you know you haven't seen a\nclinical benefit like i'm doing this for\nthe sake of anxiety and my anxiety is\ngood for like the 15 minutes that i\nmeditate but after one month i'm not\nseeing the neuroplasticity that we need\nfor a clinical benefit well yeah that's\nbecause that that takes a little bit\nmore time and even if you see the\nclinical change in your anxiety you'll\nkind of see this as well we even saw\nthis in this post\nwhere this person is kind of like okay i\nunderstand the superpower of the mind\nthat was satisfied\nbut this person hasn't made the\npersonality changes yet right\nlike they've seen like the eight month\nchanges but they haven't seen like the\nlifelong changes\nbecause they're not even looking for\nthose they're working on\nself-development through other ways\nbelieve me this person will come back to\nmeditation almost guaranteed\nand so this is how meditation works\nand this is what's so confusing for\npeople is because we don't\npeople hear about meditation they hear\nabout these benefits but no one sort of\nlike\nexplains like how the medi benefits of\nmeditation happen in what order they\nhappen\nand essentially what meditation does is\nworks on\nthree to four different levels\nthe first it works on a physiologic\nlevel and calms you down only while\nyou're meditating\nand so this is why we can say okay take\ndeep breaths if you're panicking like\ntake three deep breaths it works for all\nhuman beings because it's physiologic\nit's like literally the way that our\nbody is built\nand then people will get that benefit\nbut they're like where's the where's the\nreduction in anxiety where's the\nreduction in depression that takes eight\nweeks\nand then if you meditate for eight weeks\nand you start to see those clinical\nbenefits like you're like okay where do\nwhen do i start seeing human beings is\nfundamentally compassionate when do i\nstart to love myself sure i have like\nreduced my symptoms of depression i've\nreduced my symptoms of anxiety but i\nstill don't have this like\nself-worth that like these meditators\nseem to have\nwhen do i get that and then we see\nsomething really really important i\nthink this is what's really missed is\nthat when we reduce our emotional\nreactivity and we start to see clinical\nbenefits that alters our individual\ninteractions with the rest of the world\nwhen i get dumped instead of getting\nresentful i meditate a little bit i calm\ndown a little bit i'm still bummed out\nbut i can acknowledge the sadness\nwithout giving into it\nright so i cultivate that observing self\nwhich is able to notice the sadness and\nstill grieve\nand then still sort of like sit with it\nand everyone's like how do i sit with it\nand as you learn how to sit with with\nsadness it doesn't eat you away from the\ninside and then like once you do that\ntime and time and time again over the\ncourse of eight months a year two years\nthree years and you start to alter the\nway that you perceive the world it\nshapes your interactions as it shapes\nyour interactions because you're not\nemotionally reactive and you're not\nattacking people all the time\nthen what that does is like\nshapes your belief in humanity and as\nyour belief in humanity improves your\nhope improves because now like we don't\nhave to give up on humanity like most\nhuman beings are decent people that are\nstruggling\nand sometimes make mistakes\nimagine if you believe that in your core\nof being as opposed to\nmost human beings fundamentally can't be\ntrusted and will abandon me at some\npoint\nhow will that transform your day-to-day\ninteractions the way that you wake up in\nthe morning and what you think about\nevery time you meet a new person is it\noh crap not this again or is it wow like\nlook at this person this person is\npretty cool\nand then as you start to live your life\nwith those core beliefs fundamentally\nchanged like then the world sort of gets\nalmost like a positive bias where you\nacknowledge that some people still\nstruggle and but oh like that that's not\nit's not personal it's just this person\nmust be having a hard day\nand then it starts to shape your life in\na different direction and as you shape\nyour life in a different direction it\nactually helps you do things like set\nboundaries\nhave compassion for your parents\nwho are like\nbigoted and don't want to accept you and\nas you start to acknowledge okay wow\nlike this is like you know they're never\ngoing to accept me for who i am and\nthat's sad and i can mourn that but i\ndon't have to hate them they're a\nproduct of their environment\nand even though they're a product of\ntheir environment like i don't have to\nlet them into my life if they're not\nwilling to give me like what i need\nthis is what i need from that and so you\ncan set about you get a spine\nright you set boundaries with people and\nyou're able to tolerate their negativity\ninstead of giving in to their negativity\nand appeasing them\nand as you do that you start to build\nhealthier relationships and you cut out\nthe negative people in your life because\nyou don't need that crap and you you\nfeel some amount of guilt you\nacknowledge the guilt so be it\nadios\nright and then like your life is\ndifferent because now you have a\ndifferent set of peers\nyou have a different relationship\nyour view of a human being is\nfundamentally different and as you start\nto act in accordance with that you\nbecome one step closer to buddha\nas you become one step closer to buddha\nlike people respond to you differently\nyou start to attract like different\nkinds of people\nright people start treating you with\nrespect\nand that's pretty cool\nand so then like that's what happens at\nthe eight year mark\nit's like your life is completely\ndifferent\nand it gets tracked all the way back to\nyour physiology\nand so that's what confuses people is\nlike you know they look at some people\nare meditating they're like yeah\nmeditation is obey my life would be\ncompletely different and they're like i\ndon't get it because i've been doing\nthis for a month and\ni can barely get my mind to sit still\nand it's like that's completely normal\ndon't worry about it this is how\nmeditation changes you this is how it\nalters your life fundamentally"
