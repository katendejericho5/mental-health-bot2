    "transcript": "so this is where like\nyou know this is what technology kind of\ndoes\nis that\nthe sensory overload\nkind of like\nshort-circuits us and so we're sort of\nthere's like all these kind of um\ntechnology like conflictingly does\nthings to our brain so it stimulates\nsome parts of our brain it exhausts\nother parts of our brain\ni'm just going to check tic-toc for five\nminutes before bed right i am just going\nto check tick-tock for five minutes\nbefore going to bed and the irony here\nis that this is a tick tock about\nchecking tick tocks for five minutes\nabout that\ni am just going to check tick-tock\nlet's keep going\nwhat you know about rolling down in the\ndeep end\ni have\ni have depression but you\nyeah right so it's kind of wild because\nlike i know it sounds sort of weird but\nwe've got a phone here that's designed\nto help you\nlimit your phone usage\nand we've got tick tocks on tick tock\nwith\nyou know a ton of likes\nthat are designed to raise awareness\nabout how you can get sucked into tick\ntock\nand i know it's kind of weird because\nlike it's almost like\nyou know the\nthe internet is becoming self-aware in\nterms of these things like we're\nstarting to recognize that\nwe can actually use the platforms for\ngood instead of evil\nthat phones can actually be designed\nto help you limit your technology usage\nthat tick-tock can be a platform\nthat can actually be used to raise\nawareness about how addictive addictive\ntick-tock can be\nand so i know it's kind of bizarre right\neven like when we talk about what we do\nhere it's like we can use a twitch\nstream\nto help people who are depressed because\nthey watch way too much twitch\nright we can make a youtube video about\nspending less of your time watching\nyoutube videos about motivation and\nactually doing\nstuff so i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut it's my firm belief that if we're\ngoing to tackle these problems we\nactually need to use these tools at our\ndisposal that to a certain degree you\nhave to fight fire with fire that\nabstinence only is not really going to\nbe an effective strategy when it comes\nto technology because you can't not have\na phone right you can't stay off the\ninternet i mean maybe you can i don't\nknow maybe you can pull it off but\nfor me it's hard anyway and i think for\nmost people it's hard so what we're\ngonna have to do as individuals is we're\ngonna have to figure out okay how are we\ngonna like actually do this right how\ncan we develop limits around the\ntechnology that we use how can we\nuse technology how can we use some of\nthese things to raise awareness about\nthe problems that they themselves are\ncreating\nand because that's the only way that\nit's going to work right and i think\ngenerally speaking if you look at\nhistorical like wars and stuff like that\nif there's a if there's a there's a tech\nimbalance\nyou're probably going to lose and what\nyou really need to do is use that tech\nfor your favor\ngot to fight fire with fire\num so i thought that those were kind of\ninteresting because it's sort of like\nself-referential and aware feels kind of\nmc-usher-ish to\nme anyway let's take a look at some more\nso this one i think is really cool so i\nthink this is from a psychologist\nso we'll watch that one more time\nso this is actually really important to\nunderstand\npart of the reason that\nit's hard to get off of these content\nplatforms\nis actually because there isn't a\nconsistency\nof what you get\nright so like\nevery time so you know my poison of\nchoice is reddit\nand every time i click on a reddit post\ni don't really know what i'm going to\nget\nright is this going to be a reddit post\nthat i'm glad i clicked on\nor is it going to be a reddit post\nthat's a little bit of a waste of time\nand so this is a psychologist that's\ntalking about partial reinforcement or\nrandom reinforcement which is also a big\npart of why gambling happens\nso there are lots of studies that\nbasically show that if you can predict a\nreward and there's a consistency that\ngets you to a particular word you're\nless likely to engage in the behavior\nso for example like if i'm playing an\nmmo\nand i am looking for a piece of loot\nif there's an rng component it's more\ni'm more likely to engage in the\nbehavior and this is the big thing with\nloot boxes so if you like look at what\ncompanies do right so they'll institute\nloot boxes instead of just letting you\npay for like a cosmetic item\nso instead of just paying 50 bucks for a\nparticular cosmetic\nwhat i have to do with what they sort of\ndiscovered is that if i spend 50 on\naverage and i'll get the cosmetic\nthey can actually engage my behavior\nmore\nif it's on average and some people get\nthe cosmetic at 20 bucks and some people\nget the cosmetic at 70 bucks\nso most people get it around 50 and what\nthey sort of figured out is that\nif we make it a random reinforcement\nschedule it's more likely to engage in\nthe behavior and we've seen this with\nrats as well so a lot of studies on rats\nthat basically like every four presses\nof a lever you get like a little hit of\ncocaine so they'll actually use cocaine\nwhen they do rat studies\nbut if there's a 25 chance of success\nyou're more likely to press the lever if\nyou're a rat because what happens is\nsometimes you hit you hit the lever and\nyou get you get the cocaine you hit it\nagain you get the cocaine you hit it\nagain you get a cocaine it's like 100\nsuccess rate three times in a row and\nthat experience\nlodges in your brain and reinforces the\nbehavior\nso this is also something that i think\nwe're sort of seeing in content alg\naggregation platforms is that\ninterestingly enough\nyou're not guaranteed to enjoy what you\nwatch\nand it's that kind of lack of guarantee\nwhich sometimes\nmakes it really really really\npositive and that you really love and\nsometimes it makes it really really\nnegative so you're you're you're you\nknow trying seven times eight times nine\ntimes no reward and you get frustrated\nto the point that you may think about\nstopping\nbut if the reward schedule is too low\nthen you will stop but this is just a\ndry spell if you keep going you're gonna\nyou're gonna get get what you're looking\nfor so it's really interesting how this\nworks\nthere's one other thing that i want to\nbring up with y'all which is that we\nalso see this actually as a reason why\nabusive relationships persist\nso a lot of times people are super\nconfused about\ni don't understand like why this person\ndoesn't leave an abusive relationship\nright because like this person mistreats\nyou like i don't understand why you're\nin that relationship and if you talk to\nthe abused partner in a relationship\nwhat do they say\noh but you don't know the real person\nthey're just like that sometimes\nsometimes they can be so sweet they\ndon't really mean to\nright so people don't usually stay in\nabusive relationships that are\nconsistently abusive what they stay in\nare in relationships with dr jekyll and\nmr hyde where depending on the day you\ncan get the person who you fell in love\nwith or someone who's incredibly toxic\nso we can even see this partial\nreinforcement and if you yourself have\nbeen stuck in an abusive relationship or\nif you stayed in an abusive relationship\nfor a long time\nask yourself why did you stay it's\nprobably because the person that you\nwere with wasn't like that all the time\nright sometimes they were sweet\nsometimes they were caring sometimes\nthey were compassionate and supportive\nand so what you're doing is you're\nhoping that over time\nthey'll grow more into that person\nright you're hoping that like they'll be\nless toxic over time and like more\nawesome over time\nwhereas the truth is that unfortunately\nin abusive relationships what we tend to\nsee is the opposite\nthat as people recognize that i'm not\ngoing to be punished for my mad bad\nbehavior the bad behavior comes out more\nand more and more because early on and\nthis is sort of from the perspective and\nabu of an abuser which may be in our\naudience as well you may have noticed\nthis even if you don't think of yourself\nas an abuser that\nas you sort of let your temper out as\nyou kind of like let go a little bit and\nbecome a little bit toxic if your\npartner doesn't set limits on that what\nyou may find yourself doing is giving\ninto that more\nright you give into it more you give\ninto it more and then you find yourself\nturning into a person that you don't\neven want to be\nso it's interesting because this random\nreinforcement schedule\nis something that's like a fundamental\npart of how our brain reinforces\nbehavior\nso it's the kind of thing where like\nyou know it's just the way we're wired\nso we'll see things like gambling\nexplicitly take advantage of this\ni think these content aggregation\nplatforms or social media things like\nthat i don't know that they're quite as\npredatory as gambling is\nbut it definitely sort of is a factor\nthere we even see it in video games so\nthere's an interesting study that was\ndone many many years ago\nwhich sort of discovered that the reason\nthat video games are addictive is not\nbecause of the reward\nit's because of the denial of the reward\nso why are from software games so damn\nsatisfying to play\nbecause they're so freaking hard\nso when you finally beat melania blade\nof mikala why does it feel so good it's\nbecause it was so hard and if you think\nabout it\nfighting against that boss is a random\nreinforcement schedule because you know\nsometimes you do pretty well\nsometimes waterfall\nwaterfowl dance doesn't come out very\noften or sometimes because of the rng\nyou manage to like you know roll out of\nthe way and you kind of like handle it\nokay and you're kind of fishing for that\nrng that confluence of events\nwhere they don't use the moves that you\ndon't really know how to dodge\nand as long as you can get them to use\nthe moves that you do know how to dodge\neventually you'll win\nso we see it in relationships we see it\nin abusive relationships we see it in\nvideo games we see it on social media so\nbe aware of this principle\nbe aware that it's part of the way that\nyour brain works and the more awareness\nyou have\nover it the better control you'll have\nof it\nand for those of you who haven't played\nelden ring apologies for the the deep\ndeep reference\nsomeone saying so dark souls fans are\nabuse victims\nsort of\nbut i think it's interesting because i\nthink even i remember\num seeing something about miyazaki's\ndesign philosophy\nand a part of i think how they make the\ngame is they actually were he was\ntalking about like\nhe has to channel his hatred or\nsomething like that i i'm misquoting\nthis\nbut he channels like a dislike for the\nend user he tries to punish you but i\nthink what makes it so cool like that's\nwhat makes it so triumphant right is\nthat like at the end of the day like the\ngame is designed to be hard and like\npunishingly hard\nand at the same time the game has a lot\nof like it's such a beautiful game\ndesign because\nyou can play it whatever way you want to\nyou can run around naked with a short\nsword and you can still beat the game\nso he it's beautiful because he equips\nyou with so many things to overcome\nthe sadistic stuff that he\nlike\nasks you to beat\ndoes that make sense right because i i\ndon't think like it gives you so many\ntools\nlike mimik tier\nright so if he really wanted to\nyou know be abusive they just wouldn't\nhave put mimic here into the game\nbut they did\nand that's great\nokay let's keep going\n[Music]\nso\nthere's a lot about this that i think is\nlike really significant\none is\ni like this tick tock because of the\ndiscrepancy between the facial\nexpression and the lighting oh whoops\nsorry\nso this is where like\nyou know this is what technology kind of\ndoes\nis that\nthe sensory overload kind of like\nshort-circuits us and so we're sort of\nthere's like all these kind of um\ntechnology like conflictingly does\nthings to our brain so it stimulates\nsome parts of our brain it exhausts\nother parts of our brain\nand i i saw a really interesting post\nrecently where people were asking\nwhy is exercise healthier than like\nstimulating the heart through caffeine\nright because like when you exercise\nyour heart rate increases and that kind\nof heart rate is healthy for you\nand when you drink caffeine your heart\nrate increases as well but why do we\nthink about heart rate increasing from\ncaffeine as being different\nor not as healthy as heart rate through\nexercise\nand the reason for that is because our\nbody is like a whole organism right\nthere's a whole concert of different\nthings and exercise does a lot more than\njust stimulate your heart it also\nincreases your respiratory rate it\nalters your co2 levels it alters your o2\nlevels\nit it does all kinds of other things it\naffects blood pressure you see muscular\ncontraction and the cool thing about\nmuscular contraction is that the veins\nin your legs\nmove that blood back to your heart\nthrough the movement of your muscles so\nthis is why walking is really healthy\nfor you because if you kind of think\nabout it how do we get how do we\ntransport the blood from our calves back\nto our heart we have to push it against\ngravity and the more that we move our\nlegs the more that we contract our calf\nmuscles the more we push that blood back\nso you sort of get like a bunch of stuff\nwhen you exercise happening all over\nyour body which all is very healthy\nbecause that's the way the body was\ndesigned\nenter caffeine and it's sort of this\nisolated effect doesn't do anything to\nyour respiratory rate doesn't do\nanything to your muscular contraction in\nyour calves doesn't do anything to your\nvenous return doesn't do any of that\nstuff it just\ntargets one part of the heart\nand what we're seeing with technology is\nsort of the same thing where if we look\nat being stimulated in sort of a healthy\nway let's say we go to a party even\nright when we go to a party and there's\nmusic there and we're having a good time\nwe get all kinds of influences on our\nbrain we get social exposure right\nthere's the empathic nature of even when\nwe were talking to charlie earlier today\nif i change my facial expression\nversus if i do this right facial\nexpressions will create like notice what\nyou're doing right now chances are\nyou're smiling like when i started\nsmiling like you started smiling\nand so when we go to a place like a\nparty there's all kinds of stuff that's\ngoing on for our brain we're engaging\nwith people we're talking to people\nwe're like having good conversations\nwe're maybe feeling a little bit anxious\nwe're overcoming that anxiety and\nfalling into a conversation\nright so there's all kinds of different\nstuff that happens in a natural setting\nwhen we use something like tick-tock\nespecially depending on what kind of you\nknow tic tocs you look at\nwe're going to get more of like a\ncaffeine-like effect we're going to get\nsort of this isolated effect which is\nnot nearly as healthy\nso you'll get bombarded with all this\nlike high stimulus like you know sound\nand light and like all these different\nsongs and entertainment and all that\nkind of stuff but what it's going to\nkind of do is like veg you out it's\ngoing to fatigue your mind it's going to\nfatigue your eyes\nyou'll get sort of some amount of\nemotional suppression so we sort of know\nthis as well that like\ndifferent kinds of social media and\nvideo games and technology are going to\nhave sort of paradoxical effects on your\nbrain\nso on the one hand they kind of numb out\nnegative emotions and over time it\nappears that prolonged use even though\nin the short term if i watch a funny\ntick tock it's going to numb out my\nnegative emotion but when i spend hours\nand hours and hours\non some kind of content platform even\nthough each individual video\nseems to be numbing me out a little bit\nover time my mental health will globally\nkind of get worse\nso we kind of see is it's almost like\noverwhelming and stimulating kind of at\nthe same time and paradoxically so be\nsuper careful about that\num so i see that someone's\nlegume bra is asking so would reading be\nsimilar to the use of watching something\nor playing it\nuh so i think reading is a good example\nof something that's a little bit more\nglobally effective it's like globally\nharmonious in the way that it kind of\ncalms you down you can still read an\nexciting book that's going to keep your\nattention\nbut the way that the book\naffects you physiologically is going to\nbe like somewhat different so your eye\nstrain is going to be different\neven the amount of kind of like uv the\nwavelength of uv light that a book is\ngoing to be giving you is going to be\ndifferent from a screen so there are all\nkinds of other things that that are\ninvolved with books as opposed to\nscreens that are going to sort of affect\nyour brain in different ways\nyeah books are op\nso twitch too right so this is where\nlike it's it's not i mean hopefully this\nisn't turning into bashing tick tock\nwhich once again remember that all this\nstuff is coming from tiktok so that's\nlike pretty cool right\nso twitch is something like each of\nthese content platforms is going to have\ntheir own\nbalance of pluses and minuses\nso what i love about twitch as a\nplatform\nis that it allows you to form\nconnections with other human beings\nit is a platform that involves\nengagement right we are not responding\nto the people who are making tick tocks\nwhat i'm doing is i'm talking to chat\nwhich is fantastic that's why personally\ni love twitch as a platform because\ni like to engage with people so one\nthing that i really hated about the\npandemic is all of my teaching became\nvirtual i love teaching a group of like\nactual people like it's so much fun\nand so what's awesome about twitch is\nthat we can like develop some amount of\nrelationships\nit turns out\nthat the poison is actually the same\nthing the downside of twitch is that we\ncan develop relationships right because\nsometimes those relationships get out of\ncontrol\nthese parasocial relationships become\nkind of bizarre\nwe start to really like\nconnect with this person on the internet\nand that relationship will never be\nreciprocal it's not capable of being\nreciprocal it's not how the platform is\ndesigned so we feel close to people we\nfeel connected to people we can\ngenuinely be inspired by people which is\nall fantastic and at the same same time\nthere's like there's a there's a lack of\nreciprocity\nwhich is sort of how\nwe just can't fix that problem right\nit's just the way that twitch is built\nand i don't think that it was built that\nin a way to um\ntry to create that in a malicious way\nit's just you know someone came along\nand realized like how awesome would the\ninternet be if content creators could\ndirectly interact with people with their\naudience\nand the truth is it's awesome like i\nlove it like even this question that i'm\nanswering\nthis twitch allows for this kind of\nconnection it allows for this kind of\ninteraction and if we're not careful\nthat parasocial relationship can\nactually impact your real-life\nrelationships\nyou can start to feel more connected to\nstreamers on the internet you can start\nto like you know\nneglect your real-life relationships\nbecause you're spending time too much\ntime watching streams\nright that it's kind of bizarre but i\nthink that like\nwhat the internet is and what all these\ncontent platforms are is their fire\nand fire can be used in all kinds of\namazing ways and it's incredibly\ndangerous\nso we need to just be super careful\nabout all of these different different\ninfluences on our mind\nquestions\nisn't that the same with a live audience\nsort of so here's the big difference\nso when you're with a live audience you\ncan interact with them right\nthere's some amount of connection\nthere's definitely interaction\nbut here's the difference\nwhen you are\nwhen you're part of a large audience\nokay great fantastic question when\nyou're part of a large audience\nwhat is the\nduration of your relationship\nwhat is the duration of your\nrelationship with someone on twitch\nright think about that how are those\nthings different so i gave a talk\nyesterday really loved the talk it's one\nof the best\nexperiences for me is someone who who\ngoes and gives talks i really loved who\ni loved the questions i loved\ninteracting with people all that kind of\nstuff\ni also personally liked getting in and\nreceiving hugs i mean giving and\nreceiving hugs so that was nice to be\nable to do\nbut the challenge with in-person live\naudience interactions is that they tend\nthe duration is short\nlike it's limited right you don't i mean\nmaybe you'll have something like a\nprofessor who you can build a\nrelationship with over the course of\nseveral lectures but if you go and like\ngive a talk like let's say you go to a\nyou know a university because there's a\nthere's a talk being given by someone\nthere's like 300 people there and so you\ncan do some back and forth but then it\nends\nwhat's different what's both good and\nbad\nthis is why we're playing with fire here\non twitch is that you can always come\nback and the streamer's always going to\nbe there right not always but they're\ngoing to stream every day three days we\nstream three days a week a lot of people\nstream five days a week people stream\nfor a long time so the time span that\nyou have to develop that parasocial\nrelationship is way longer and then it\ncan start to feel\nmore connected\nright and and so it's different\nit's different and then what we sort of\nsee is that when you have a\nquote-unquote live audience that's\npersistent over time that's when you\nform real relationships so you may have\ngotten you know there may have been a\nprofessor you really enjoyed one class\nyou went took a second class you got to\nknow them somewhat they start to become\na mentor of yours you all form some kind\nof like lasting relationship that's\nhealthy and wonderful and all that good\nstuff\nhopefully no abuses of the power dynamic\nthere\nbut that's the big difference\nis that the twitch relationship is a lot\neasier to maintain\nwe didn't evolve an intrinsic\nunderstanding of the bizarre disconnect\nbetween real life and internet life says\nflatbug completely agree\nso here's it goes even one step further\nwe didn't evolve to understand the\ndistinction it goes one step further\nthan that\nthe internet\nhas evolved\nto take advantage of and activate the\ncircuitries that are active in real life\nright like that's actually how it\nevolves so this is something i want all\ny'all to understand\nthe internet is undergoing a rapid rate\nof evolution\nand we're not evolving to it it is\nevolving to us\nso if you want to understand this all\nyou need to do is look at content\nplatforms\nand look at the evolution of social\nmedia\nwe used to have myspace\nand then facebook came along and\nfacebook allowed for more connection\nmore interaction\nmore of a network\nright because that's what people wanted\nlike facebook was more connected than my\nmyspace is more connected\nand then social media evolve evolved\neven further\nso text messages turned into snapchat\nright and then like we sort of developed\nwhatsapp groups because the internet\nsort of figured out is people made a\nthousand different applications\nin a thousand different startups the\nones that were the most\naligned with our current neuro circuitry\nin psychology were the ones that blew up\nwe also see this in terms of content\nso there used to be blogs\nright there are still\nblogs people would like sit down and\nthey'd like write stuff out right and it\nwould be like well thought out and then\nyou'd publish a blog post\nand over time what does that become\npeople sort of realized oh it's more\nemotionally engaging if i make a vlog\ninstead of a blog because there's facial\nexpression there's color there's light\nthere's sound there's so many things\nthat are much more engaging than reading\nstuff so along came the video content\nand even the written content so what we\nrealize is oh written content is boring\nit doesn't hold the attention as well\nso what happened to the written content\non the internet what is the most popular\nreadable\napp\nor internet service\nright\nit's twitter i think\nand what's different about twitter\ntwitter blew up because\nit was restricted and how short it can\nbe\nand so what twitter sort of figured out\nis that\nthe way to get people to engage\nconsistently the best engagement with\nwritten content is going to be\nif we keep it short\nreddit i think is another good example\nright\nand so are we seeing that similar thing\nhappen with video content\nso people used to make vlogs and video\nessays and they still do\nbut what are the most popular channels\non youtube\nright\nand\nwhat tick tock figured out is oh it\nseems like the most popular channels on\nyoutube\ntend to be shorter in nature and people\nreally like short content\nso let's make\na platform that's all about\nsocially engaging\nshort segmented emotionally engaging\ncontent and thus tick tock was born and\nthat's what all the kids are using\nnowadays\nso i don't think things are going to get\nmuch shorter than that by the way\nbecause i think we're sort of\ndiscovering where the sweet spot is and\nthat's what's sort of happening so\ntechnology is evolving to adapt to our\nbrain and people are making all kinds of\ndifferent stuff and you even see this in\nterms of video game development right oh\nyeah someone was mentioning vines right\nso vines is a good example of that\npeople started making vines and then it\nbecame tick-tock\nso even if we were talking about from\nsoftware and and miyazaki and and stuff\nright so what's cool is like why is\nalden ring\nso much more noob friendly\nit's because there are all these\nbuilt-in\ndifficulty modifications that aren't\ndone in settings like if i'm losing\nagainst a boss i can just go explore\nanother place upgrade my weapon two more\ntimes and go back and fight the boss and\nsuddenly i've modulated the difficulty\ni can choose to use summons or not use\nsummons\nso what we sort of discovered is that\nlike\nthe more that we adapt to what people\nwant these are the these are the\ntechnologies that are successful\nand i think so far\num\nyou know i think this has been done\nhonestly in a pretty\nunsophisticated way\nso we know that for example game\ndevelopers will employ things like\nbehavioral\neconomists well to a certain degree\nemploy\npsychologists but i think that like\nyou know\ni think that there's a lot that they\nhaven't even touched and so crypto is\nactually a good example of this where\nlike\nyou know i've i've sort of looked at\ncrypto for a while and like analyzed the\npsychology of it and there there are uh\n12 or 13 discrete like psychological\nprinciples that are at play in crypto we\nmade a video about a couple of those but\nthere's like a lot more there and i'm\nsure that what's going to happen over\ntime is like people will make\ncryptocurrencies that\num\nactivate these different things or sort\nof take advantage of them and then like\nthose cryptocurrencies will be more\nsuccessful\nand so we're just getting started\nso be careful and also you can sort of\nsee like the evolution\nso it's not that we didn't evolve to\ntell the difference it's that\nthe technology that's being developed is\nbeing developed\nto shrink that difference\nright those are the things that are the\nmost successful\nwhy is twitch so successful as a\nplatform it because it's because it adds\nthe element of interaction\nto the internet\nwhy is discord so successful because it\nallows for interaction it allows for\ncommunity building it allows for all\nthis kind of stuff\ngreat question\nyeah healthy coin\ni mean this is going to be an\nexaggeration but like once a week we\nsomeone reaches out to us asking us\nabout hey do you want to start\nhealthy gamer coin\nor nfts or something like that\nit's not literally once a week\nbut it happens a lot\num\nuh\nokay should we keep going\num\nanyone else gets so overwhelmed by\nsomething that they go on\nfor a break but then non-stop scrolling\njust makes them even more overstimulated\n100\nright\nand this is this is the challenge is\nthat like\nso\nlet's understand the neuroscience of\nthis for a second\nwhy do we take a break\non\nsome of these platforms when we feel\nexhausted\nand how do we feel more tired afterward\nit's interesting right so this kind of\ncomes back to what i was saying earlier\nabout understanding the amygdala and the\nhippocampus oh sorry a limbic system\nso the limbic system and the amygdala\nare emotional circuits of the brain\nespecially the amygdala's responsible\nfor fear and anxiety and our survival\nemotions\nand so what happens is we've discovered\nhow to self-soothe\nso\nhuman beings are really good at sort of\nfiguring out what calms down their\nemotions so this is where sometimes if\nwe sort of discover i don't know if you\nall have like a friend who every time\nthey're stressed out they give you a\ncall\nand they like talk to you and you're\nlike you're like the good you're like\nthe therapist friend so you kind of like\ntalk them down a little bit and they\ncalm down and they feel better afterward\nand then what happens the next time\nthey're upset\nthey call you\nand then over time you fall into the\nrole of the therapist friend\nand so they start to use you as a way of\nemotional decompression maybe you're\nguilty of this and you use other people\nfor emotional decompression\nand so when that happens like human\nbeings will figure out what works for\nthem\nand so this is also what happens with\nsubstances\nright so if you're like 13\nand you're\nyou know struggling because you like\nsomeone at school and you tried asking\nthem out\nand they laughed in your face and\neveryone else around you laughed because\nyou had the audacity to ask them out was\nreally they just you made them come\nuncomfortable and they didn't know what\nelse to do but laugh i don't know that\nthey're actually that malicious but it\nhurts a lot\nand then you're hanging out with your\nolder sibling who's getting high with\nhis friends\nand then you get high too and what\nhappens all that crap goes away\nyou feel so much better\nand so what happens the next time you\nfeel upset\nyou've got a solution that's going to\ntake it away\nso that's what happens right so we've\nsort of discovered that if i laugh at\nmemes for a little while\nthen i'll feel emotionally better\nnow the challenge that we run into\nis that even if i laugh at memes for a\nwhile there's another long-term more\nglobal effect\non our brain that these different kinds\nof applications are causing\nstimulation riling us up\nright because what gets propagated it's\nthe emotionally activating content\nso you may see stuff you may see some\nlike you know parents like crying about\nlosing their children and stuff like\nthat you're going to see like other\nkinds of new stuff about the the russia\nukraine war you're going to see stop\nstuff about you know\nthis cat that lost a leg that is now\nable to walk on one foot or you can see\nall kinds of like random like\nemotionally charged content and it's\ngoing to be all over the place too so on\nthe one hand you're kind of numbing\nyourself up and on the other hand you're\nkind of like activating yourself and\nlike emotionally engaging yourself and\nso what you're left with\nis kind of this like a very unnatural\nemotional activation and an unnatural\nemotional suppression\nso it's sort of like doing uppers and\ndowners at the same time\nright so there's there's something that\nback when i was doing a lot more\naddiction psychiatry sometimes people\nwould use something called a speed ball\nwhich is they'd inject heroin and\ncocaine at the same time do not do that\ndo not use drugs kids seriously\nand so that's what we're doing\ntechnology has now become somewhat of a\nspeed ball\nso like when i sit down and i play\na video game\nthat both calms me down and pisses me\noff\ndo you all get that\nlike think about it like i'm gonna play\na game to have fun and relax\nand after three hours it's gonna be like\nuh\ni don't understand i'm gonna i don't\nunderstand why i play this game\nright\nit's kind of it's kind of weird but\nthat's what it does that's literally\nwhat does because it activates some\ncircuits of our brain\ndoesn't it suppresses other circuits of\nour brain\nand almost and why isn't that healthy\nlike so all those circuits getting\nactivated is actually healthy\nlike but you have to activate them in a\nnatural way\nbecause then they all get activated\ntogether and that's okay and if you look\nat sort of the way that emotions you\nknow\nrise and fall in a healthy situation\nlet's say that\nyou know your friend gets dumped\nand then you all get together\nyou'll have a good cry they tell you\nwhat happens you have a good cry\nyou're feeling all that negative emotion\nyou hug each other\nyou know you say some inspiring words\ni'm so sorry you're going through this\nall this kind of stuff and at the end of\nit like both of you feel tired but you\nfeel good about it you feel light\nyou feel like you've let something off\nof your chest so it's not suppression\nit's like processing so when our brain\nhandles emotions in a more natural way\nlike there's more processing involved\nand when we handle emotions through\ntechnology all we do is suppress it\nand as we suppress it what happens it\ncomes back roaring again and again\nso when i'm afraid that i'm not going\nanywhere in life\nand i manage that fear\nthrough video games\nwhat happens when i stop playing the\ngame\nfear just comes roaring back\nor\nyou know this is a lot of people in our\ncommunity are going somewhere are\nactually very successful\nso if you're at your job and you think\nyou're afraid you're gonna get fired\nbecause you made a mistake on an\nimportant project\nsame damn thing\nload up a video game forget about the\nproblem for a little while because it's\nso terrifying that your career could\ncome to an end\nyou're an engineer at one of these\nhighly coveted positions you're making a\nbunch of money\nand like what if i get fired then you go\nlog on to the video game and you forget\nyour worries for a little while\nand then you wake up the next day and\nyou've got to go to work and you're\nterrified of what your boss is going to\nsay\nyou get a message on slack hey can you\nswing by my office when you have a\nsecond you're terrified\ncan you come by in the afternoon you go\non your lunch break what do you do on\nyour lunch break you grab your food\nyou grab your phone\nand you veg out for a little bit\nright so it's it's not it you don't have\nto be successful or unsuccessful\nthat's not the important thing the\nimportant thing is what's happening in\nyour mind\nand how do you respond to it\nand what role does technology play\nwhat role do these platforms like twitch\nand stuff play\nall right\nokay\num\nso we're gonna maybe take a look at one\nmore okay\n[Music]\nhey\n[Music]\nso you've got a lot of potential\nyou know what you need to do\nand that's the problem\nis there's a lot of stuff that you got\nto do right\nbut why is it so easy to engage in the\ntechnology\nwhy is it so easy so this is important\nto understand\nif we look at why fundamentally\ntechnology is addictive\na big reason that it's addictive is\nbecause it offers you\nthe same rewards\nthat you would get from real life\nbut at a cheaper cost\nsame reward\nbut easier\nso if you log on to twitch\nyou connect with a streamer they laugh\nyou laugh\ndr k makes a facial expression you make\na facial expression\nyou get that empathic connection\nbut it's easier to do because\nyou don't have to leave the house\nyou don't have to shower\nyou don't have to do laundry\nright you don't have to sit in traffic\nyou don't have to worry about like\nwhether that one person that you don't\nlike is gonna show up or not\nand if this is horrible but we've been\nhearing about this more and more\nrecently\nin your friend group\nyour ex\nisn't gonna be like you're you know if\nyou have a friend group and you now were\ndating someone from your friend group\nand now they're your ex every time you\ngo hang out with the friend group the x\nis there\nso you don't have to deal with that if\nyou form an empathic connection with\nsomeone on the internet\nif you have a friend on discord it's so\neasy because if you screw up you can\njust block them you can ignore them you\nnever have to do any kind of damage\ncontrol in a relationship\nit's just easy to find someone else to\nconnect to\nso the challenge with technology is that\nit\ngives you the rewards\nlike\nin your brain it gives you the rewards\nwithout\ngoing through all the effort\nand we see this in video games as well\nright so like we'll see this a lot where\npeople will say\ni don't understand why i can grind on a\nvideo game and like\nreally try to be like one of the best\nyou know top 200 players in the world\nbut i can't bring myself to study for\nschool\nlike both of them are a grind\nbut i can do one very easily i can like\ni can grind on like this video game for\n12 hours a day\nand try to be the best at something\nbut i can't do that when it comes to\nlike being the best at\nyou know writing haikus\nand like studying english literature\ni don't understand\nbecause being the best is important to\nme i get a lot of value out of it\nand that's where like yeah that's why\nthe games are successful because they\ngive you that reward of achievement\nright is one of our oldest videos back\nwhen\ndr k was a small childer\nwho first showed up on the internet\nwe posted a video like one of our oldest\nvideos on our youtube channel about the\ntriumph circuit\nand the whole reason that games are\naddictive is because they give you that\nsense of triumph they give you that\ndifficulty with the reward at the end\nand what our brain has learned to value\nis not easy things\nbut hard things that we can win at\nthat's the sweet spot if it's too easy\nit becomes boring if it's too hard it\nbecomes overwhelming both of those\nlead to a lack of motivation both of\nthem take your motivation\nwhy are you motivated towards video\ngames and not motivated towards the\nother parts of life\nit's because the the rest of life is\neither overwhelming or boring\ncompared to video games\nand this is the key thing to understand\nis that now your brain has option c\nit's not which one do i want to do do i\nwant to be boring or do i want to be\noverwhelmed because if it's irl like\nthose are your two options\nright either i go to the party and i\nfeel socially anxious for an hour before\ni kind of get into it and have a good\ntime or i stay home i have no social\nexposure no social anxiety but then i'm\ngonna feel bored and lonely those are\nthe options\nirl\nand then technology gives us option c ah\nthere's twitch there's discord\nyou get all the conversation\nwith none of the social anxiety and then\nyour brain is like\nyes\ni'll take that one\nso you can study hard\nand it's going to be boring and you'll\nget an a at the end\nwhich by the way you're going to get the\na at the end of the semester so there's\ngoing to be a huge delayed gratification\nand by the way when you get an a in a\nclass\nhow long do you feel\ngood\nhow long does the happiness from getting\nan a in class last\ncompared to\n60 minute game of dota\nenemy has mega creeps you're about to\nlose you wipe them in a heroic\ndefense of your base\nrun it down mid and win the game\nthere's no way getting an a in a class\nis going to reach anywhere near that\nlevel of thrill\nanywhere near that level of triumph\nand how hard you have to work to get\nthat you just have to sign up for a dota\ngame\nyou don't have to go to a whole semester\nhours and hours and hours at the library\nbefore your award\nright\nyou don't have to do that\nso the reward happens so much easier\nthe other interesting thing\nis what if you're running it down mid\nafter wiping them in your base and\nthey've got mega creeps\ntheir throne is at half health\nand then their creeps are in your base\nand you lose the game\nyou don't even win at the end\nit's a base race and you lose\nwhat does that do to your motivation\ndo you say screw this game i'm never\ngonna win play it again\nno you queue right back\nup right go next next i was so close i\ncould taste the victory let me do it\nagain\ni could taste it it was so close now\ncompare that to real life\nwhat happens if you get an 89 in a class\ngot a b\nare you like great awesome next time i'm\ngonna get an a\ncue up go next let's let's jump i want\nto skip the summer break i want to go\nright into the next semester and i'm\ngoing to crush it i'm going to get an a\nwhy did i study so hard for an 89\ni could have spent half the time at the\nlibrary playing twice as many video\ngames and i could have gotten 80 would\nhave been the same damn grade\nwaste of my time\ntanks your motivation\nso you all want to understand like why\nis it different\nwhy can i do this\nin a game and why can't i do it in real\nlife there it is\nbecause here's what's happening people\nare figuring out right game developers\nare figuring out i don't think it's\nmalicious i don't think it's predatory i\nmean maybe some of them are\nbut i think they're just figuring out\nwhat makes cause if you're like a game\ndesigner right like think about this for\na second what do you want to do you want\nto make a fun game what makes fun games\nthese razor thin moments\nepic\nsaves\nepic wins\nyou know rubber band mechanics\nbecause you're trying to make a fun game\nyou're trying to make a game that people\nenjoy\nso i don't blame them for it so what\nshould we do\nright\nat the end of the day like what's our\nresponsibility\ni think our responsibility like so you\ncan blame everyone if you want to\nokay\nreally you can you can say like oh and\nwe hear this a lot from parents\nespecially\nwhy doesn't someone do something about\nit\nwhy didn't someone ban the video games\nburn all the video games stop them take\nthe video their developers to jail\nthey're addicting my kid\ni don't know that you can alter the\nworld to make your life easy i don't\nknow if you can do that\nbut what you can do is like be aware\nright you can do things to set yourself\nup for success you can do things to help\nyourself set healthy boundaries and i'm\nnot kidding like part of the reason i'm\nserious like the reason that we took\nthis sponsorship with oneplus is because\nthey actually have a device that like\nhelps you set limits on your device\nright so there's like tools out there\nyou can do things to set healthy\nboundaries you can uninstall stuff from\nyour pc if you need to\nyou can also like be more aware of like\nwhat the game does to you you can limit\nthe amount that you play and you may say\nlike limiting oh it's so hard but like\nthink about this for a second\nif i'm going to play 10 hours of video\ngames is the amount of fun the same\nduring all 10 hours\nno\nthe first couple hours are fun the last\ncouple hours suck you don't even know\nwhy you're playing\nso just be aware of this stuff and the\nmore that you become aware of it\nthe easier it'll be to set boundaries\nlike literally grab a piece of paper\nand if you're if you play video games\nfor 10 hours a day\nwrite down one one through ten for each\nhour that you play and next to each\nnumber\njust look\nlike rate each one so how much fun did i\nhave over the last hour\non a scale of one to ten ten being the\nmost fun i've ever had in my life\none being absolutely awful\nand just do that for a week and look at\nthe numbers\nand then ask yourself like why am i\ndoing this\nlike what's going on here be aware of\nwhat what's going on\nwhen you ask yourself why i'm doing this\nthe answer isn't there's no reason to do\nthis no there's a good reason to do it\nthat's why you're doing it\nand raise that awareness of yourself\nand as you become aware of it you'll\ngain power over it so here's the last\nthing i'll leave you with\nawareness precedes control everyone is\ntrying to think about how to control\nthings how do i change my behavior how\ndo i control my motivation how do i do\nthis how do i everyone's focusing on the\naction or the behavior how do i\ntransform my life\nawareness precedes control if you want\nto understand this very very well\nhopefully you all have had or i don't\nknow about hopefully but if you've ever\nhad a situation where you've like\nhad a part of your body that's been numb\nso often times for like dental work\nright they'll numb some part of your\nbody\nand then what happens when you numb it\nyou can't use it properly your control\nover it disappears\nsince then you like talk all funny\nright and they tell you not to eat\nbecause you're gonna bite your lip\nand you'll bite your tongue or whatever\nand so before you're aware of something\nyou can't do anything about it so\nawareness precedes control in medicine\nthis is also good diagnosis proceeds\ngood treatment sort of similar\nso be aware of what you're doing and\nthen do the best that you can to set up\nsituations\nwhere you can sort of like move in a\ndirection to like account for these\nthings\nand that's where i think ultimately a\nhealthy relationship with technology\ncomes from because this stuff is here\nand it sounds like it's here to stay\nand at the same time like we don't have\nto despair because it's here it can be a\ntool for good it can be a source of\nenjoyment it can be a source of social\nconnection\neven during the pandemic i was really\nsurprised to discover that a lot of\ntimes like the gamers were the ones who\nwere doing the best because we were the\nones who had relationships that were\nvirtual that sustained us for years\nso i know that was definitely the case\nwith me whereas like we had a game night\nlike easy fantastic we've been doing\nthis for years\nright so we we we're able to keep some\nof those connections so don't be afraid\nof technology it's not evil\nbut respect it understand that it is\nplaying with fire\nand you can accomplish a lot with it but\nif you're not careful you're gonna get\nburned\nokay\nso just uh a reminder that this is a\nsegment of a sponsored stream we're\ngoing to actually wrap up so we're being\nsponsored by oneplus which is a phone\ncompany\nand part of the reason that we're we\ntook this sponsorship is because the\noneplus phone actually has features\nthat are designed to limit your use\nso they've got zen mode they've got work\nlife mode they've got these different\nthings that you can do that will sort of\ndisable notifications or allow some\nnotifications in and out so that if you\nare in work mode like\nyou know you'll get some things that are\nwork related but you won't get things\nthat'll distract you from work this is\nexactly i think what phones need to be\ndoing or what tools we need to develop\nand so that's kind of why we took it the\nother cool thing is that oneplus has\nbeen kind enough to sponsor coaching for\ny'all\nso that's another thing that we tend to\nlook for from our sponsors is we want\npeople who are actually willing to like\nhelp our community as opposed to just\nhelp us\nand so we're grateful to them so you can\nuse the the command exclamation point\ngiveaway if you're someone who's looking\nfor coaching whether it's career\ncoaching or group coaching where you\nwant to like practice social skills and\nand things like that or you're like\nlooking to get life purpose understand\nyourself better like try to figure out\nwhy you're you're struggling with\nmotivation all those kinds of things are\nwhat we sort of\ndo with coaching\nand if that's something that you're\ninterested in you know use the\nexclamation point giveaway command um\nand the last thing is what we're\ngrateful for is we also recognize that\nthere are a lot of people in our\ncommunity who may not be able to afford\nour coaching services\npart of what we really do believe in\nthough is that our coaches are not\nvolunteers that you know they get\ncompensated for the work that they do\nand so thankfully oneplus is is offered\nto sponsor some of those coaching\npackages so\nthat's why we're doing this\nyou"
