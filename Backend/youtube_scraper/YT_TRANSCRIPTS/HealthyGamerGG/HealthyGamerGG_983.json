    "transcript": "so sometimes when we date people we\nstart dating someone who's a little bit\nbroken and a little bit busted and so\nyou're gonna like you feel so good about\nyourself right because this person is\ndepressed they're busted in some way and\nthere you are they were in a car\naccident they can't walk anymore you're\ntaking care of them you're feeding them\nyou're cleaning for them you're doing\neverything for them and then they start\nto walk and you're like yeah like i've\ndone so i'm like such a good human being\nlook at me and so it's kind of weird but\none of the biggest problems that people\nhave in relationships is they try to\nhold on to an old relationship because\nthis is what the relation the\nrelationship was great it was so awesome\nbefore things changed and so this is a\npoint where if your girlfriend is not\nclingy anymore you may start to feel\nterrified you may start to feel like she\ndoesn't need you anymore and sometimes\nshe may not need you and if the\nfoundation of your relationship\nwas her needs\nand that foundation gets wiped away then\nthe relationship won't survive\n[Music]\ngirlfriend not clingy anymore hard to\nprocess what do\nthat's such a such a great question dude\nseriously let's talk about this so\nsometimes when we date people\nwe start dating someone who's a little\nbit broken and a little bit busted and\nsometimes they're a little bit clingy\nand the neat thing about dating someone\nwho's clingy is it's kind of like a very\ngood\ncompliment to our own insecurities\nright so if i don't believe that i am\nworth dating but i end up dating someone\nwho's very very clingy their clinginess\ndemonstrates to me how vital and\nimportant of a person i am right\nso like y'all get that it's it's kind of\nlike we'll see this a lot where people\nwho are\ninsecure at their core about their worth\nwill actually date people who are very\nvery clingy\nand so a relationship will start\nand people are like not perfect when\nthey start a relationship right each of\nus has things that we're working on and\nstuff like that\nand the relationship will develop\nparticular dynamics\nlike for example this person is clingy\ni'm the support\nand they need the support and it's kind\nof like a one-way relationship it gives\nme a sense of value it also gives me a\nsense of security\nbecause as long as this person needs me\nthen i don't have to worry about them\nleaving right as long as i can dem\nprovide value and i can do something for\nthem\nright so this goes back to the what have\nyou done for me lately as long as a\nperson is is clingy they can't leave and\ni can continue being a good partner\nright\nso that's kind of interesting because\nthat's that's what happens and\ninterestingly enough we'll like find\npeople who are clingy and like you may\nwonder like why on earth are you dating\nsomeone who's so clingy they're so\nclingy all the time doesn't that annoy\nyou and you're like yeah it annoys me\nbut you know subconsciously i really\nreally enjoy it because i don't have to\nworry about them leaving because they're\nincapable of functioning on their own so\ni'm guaranteed a relationship and i\ndon't have to worry about being alone\nyeah\nthat happens\nso then\nsomething often happens that is very\nvery terrifying so sometimes we enter\nrelationships\nand a big part of that relationship is\nus wanting to help the other person\nbecause this person is broken\nand like i want to help them i love them\ni want them to be independent i want to\nhelp them get healthy i want to help\nthem become whole i love them so much\nand so you're going to like you feel so\ngood about yourself right because this\nperson is depressed they're busted in\nsome way and there you are they were in\na car accident they can't walk anymore\nyou're taking care of them you're\nfeeding them you're cleaning for them\nyou're doing everything for them and\nthen they start to walk and you're like\nyeah like i've done so i'm like such a\ngood human being look at me\nand then they start getting better\nand then they don't need you anymore\nand then you kind of don't know what to\ndo with that\nbecause i used to provide value for this\nperson right and so if i'm insecure\nabout myself\nas long as i can continue providing\nvalue for them they're going to stay in\nthe relationship but if i stop providing\nvalue then why would they be in the\nrelationship\nthey don't need to be here anymore\nthey've grown past me\nand so it can be very very hard as as\nyou support your partner and your\npartner has the chance to stand on their\nown two feet and they no longer need\nyour help it can be a blow to you it can\nbe very difficult for you\nwhat are you supposed to do now how are\nyou supposed to function how are you\nsupposed to handle it\nright so it can be really hard but\nhere's the thing to understand about\nrelationships\nif you want to stay in a successful\nrelationship you have to understand that\nthe relationship changes over time\nso let's say i start dating someone and\nwe're both 18 years old and we're about\nto go to college well let's say we\nstarted dating in high school\nso we've been dating for three years 15\nto 18.\nand that relationship works in that way\nbecause we're 15 16 17 18. and then when\nwe go to college that's different right\nwe're going to grow as people we're\ngoing to change as people\nthe interests that we have are going to\nchange our work ethic may change some of\nus may get serious some of us may get\nmore serious in terms of work ethic some\nof us may start partying way too much\nso we'll change as human beings because\nhuman beings aren't static\nand so it's kind of weird but one of the\nbiggest problems that people have in\nrelationships is they try to hold on to\nan old relationship because this is what\nthe relation the relationship was great\nit was so awesome five years ago before\nthings changed and i want to go back to\nthat thing\nbut here's the thing to understand that\nhuman beings change over time it's a\nfact\nand so if human beings change\nrelationships must change with them\nand so this is a point where if your\ngirlfriend is not clingy anymore you may\nstart to feel terrified you may start to\nfeel like she doesn't need you anymore\nand sometimes she may not need you and\nif the foundation of your relationship\nwas her needs\nand that foundation gets wiped away then\nthe relationship won't survive\ndoes that mean that she used you and\nyou're resentful and all that kind of\nstuff i'm not sure about any of that\ncrap because you offered right\nso this is the other problem that we get\ninto with relationships is when i become\nmy partner's therapist\ni have a dual relationship\nso do they owe me romance if i am giving\nthem therapy\nand this is something that people do all\nthe time without realizing it they feel\nresentful because i'm giving you this\nand you're supposed to give me this in\nin return but it's not an even trade i\ndon't know that i in fact i do know\nthat romance is not an appropriate\nway to repay someone for therapy\nlike that's not that's actually\ninappropriate\nso it can be very confusing as your\npartner no longer gets clingy but this\nis where like this is where like the\nrelationship needs to adapt it needs to\nchange\nright just like a seed becomes a\nshoot\nand then a plant and then a tree\nand then\nhas flowers and then bears fruit and\nthose fruit have seeds of their own\nthe the process of a relationship\nchanges in metamorphosis over time\nand if you want a relationship to work\nyou have to let it change\nyou can't let it be what it was so now\nthere are certain things about your\npartner that you really liked because or\nthat you liked in spite of the\nclinginess right so the clinginess\npresumably is a bad thing maybe it's a\ngood thing whatever but there have to be\nother things to your relationship\nbesides the clinginess\nso hopefully those things are still\nthere and now without the clinginess in\nthe way\nwhat can your relationship turn into\nnow that your partner is independent can\nthey start supporting you more\nright can the support start to be 50 50\nbecause ideally that's what it'll turn\ninto and that's what hopefully happens\nin these kind of successful\nrelationships where you help your\npartner get back on their feet\nand then hopefully the foundation of the\nrelationship was not the dependence\nbecause if the foundation of the\nrelationship was dependent it doesn't\nmean the relationship is going to end it\njust means you need a new foundation and\nanytime you switch foundations there's a\nchance that the relationship ends\nso it can be a lot to process for sure\nit can be very challenging but i would\nstart by first of all all understanding\nwhat is confusing about it for you\nunderstand what your own feelings are\nunderstand what you want from the\nrelationship understand how you feel\nthreatened\nif you do by her lack of clinginess\nand then have a conversation about it\nright\ntalk to your partner hey i've noticed\nthat when we first started dating you\nwere like i would have described you as\nclingy\nwould you say that's fair\nand then\nyou know because you don't want to label\nsomething if if she doesn't agree with\nit and then say like i've really noticed\nthat you've grown a lot in that way\nrecently and that you've become a lot\nmore independent\nand hopefully you can be proud of that\nso then you can authentically say like\ni'm really proud of you for like you've\nchanged a lot like you become an adult\nyou've grown in so so many amazing ways\nis it okay and so you talk about that\nand say well that doesn't have to be the\nsame conversation then you can even\nshare that it's weird but i find myself\nbeing more insecure the more independent\nyou become\nbecause there's a part of me that\nthought\nthat has always wondered like\npart of the reason you're with me is\nbecause i do like support you and now if\nyou don't need my support anymore\ni've started to feel kind of confused\nabout\nwhat's going to happen to our\nrelationship\nand i would just say that and see what\nyour partner has to say\nbecause the whole point about a\nrelationship is like you can try to\nnavigate stuff up here and this is a\nmistake that a lot of people make they\ntry to fix the relationship all\ninternally for try to figure everything\nout there's a whole other person\ninvolved there's a whole another mind\nthere's a whole other set of feelings\nand like enroll them in the process\nthat's the only way that the\nrelationship is going to work\nit can be scary when your partner is no\nlonger clingy it's one of the most\nattractive things for some people to\nhave a clingy partner because then i\ndon't have to worry about them leaving\nright it can allay my own insecurities\nand the cool thing about\ndoing this and having that conversation\nis that you give your partner the\nopportunity to share with you\nwhy you are worth being in a\nrelationship with\nright they can say oh like now that i'm\nindependent like yeah i did need you\nbefore but i actually like love it that\ni don't need you anymore and i can i can\nenjoy your company without it being a\nneed without it being like transactional\nlike now i can appreciate you for who\nyou are\nand you're amazing and like we have so\nmuch like and now i can start supporting\nyou because you deserve support too\nand i'd love to support you in the way\nthat you supported me\nand if if that's what they say to you\nlike that's going to feel amazing right\nthat's when you learn that outside of\nwhat you provide for another person you\nhave value that they care about it'll\nstrengthen your relationship\nnow the tricky thing\nis that if you don't do this\nand you start being kind of manipulative\nand like you start like engendering some\namount of clinginess on their part or\nyou start like pulling away in some\nweird way like if you never give them\nthe opportunity\nto let them appreciate you\nthen you're never gonna fix that\ninsecurity to begin with\nbecause how does that insecurity get\nfixed it gets fixed by them\ndemonstrating their value\nright demonstrating sorry them\ndemonstrating your value to them they\ncan say i think you have intrinsic value\nas a human being even though i don't\nneed you anymore i want to stay\nand i'm staying in this relationship\nbecause i want to not because i need to\nand when your partner can say that to\nyou that's what's going to make you feel\nsecure because they're here because they\nwant to be not because they need to be\nbecause you're always wondering are they\nhere because they want to be or because\nthey're because they need to be\nif they were healthy would they leave me\nbehind so that is that insecurity\nand so sometimes what happens is we give\nin to that so much without even\nrealizing that we engender dependence on\nthe part of our partner\nbecause we never want we never want to\nbe tested we never want to give them the\nopportunity to leave because they could\nleave\nwhat if she says yeah actually the\nreason that i've been less clingy and\nmore independent is because i'm no\nlonger interested in this relationship\nand i've been recognizing that\nas part of like being able to leave that\nthis relationship in a healthy way i\nneed to be more independent\nthat could be what they could say too\nbut here's the thing if that's what\nthey're saying like being a manipulative\nprick is not going to change that\nyou may be able to get them to stay for\na little while but if they're not\ninvested in the relationship\nyou know you can try to manipulate them\ninto staying and you may even succeed\nbut i don't think that's a relationship\nin which either of you will be happy you\nmay feel secure\nyou may feel some length of some amount\nor some lack of loneliness but you'll\nalso feel resentment you'll also feel\nstressed\nit's not going to be a healthy\nrelationship can unconditional love be\nunhealthy i think unconditional\nunconditional love is not the problem\nthe problem is that\npeople associate unconditional love with\nall kinds of unconditional other things\nright so what some people will do is\nthey'll say they'll think that\nunconditional love means unconditional\nfinances\nmeans unconditional boundaries\nmeans a complete absence of boundaries\nmeans unconditional forgiveness\nmeans unconditional second chances\nthe problem with unconditional love\nunconditional love i think is generally\nspeaking a good thing\nto i don't think you should stop loving\nsomeone\nbut the problem is that\nwe squeeze in a lot of stuff to\nunconditional love\nlike financial support\nand complete tolerance\nand no lack of boundaries\nand i think that's what's unhealthy\nand so this is where it's it's confusing\nfor a lot of people but you know when if\nyou ever hear the phrase\nif you loved me you would dot dot dot\nthat phrase is a friggin trap\nif you loved me if you really loved me\nyou would do this for me one of the most\nmanipulative phrases ever\nlove in whatever that other thing is the\nreason that you're not using the same\ndamn word for both those things because\nthose things are different\nright if you loved me unconditionally\nyou would love me unconditionally yes\nyou are correct that is correct if you\nloved me unconditionally you would\npay for whatever i wanted disagree\nit's the tying of the two things\nright and that's where unconditional\nlove gets into trouble\nbecause we tend to once it gets\nunhealthy about it i don't think is the\nlove it's the other stuff\nand so if you find yourself\nmaking those kinds of statements or\nthinking those kinds of thoughts i\nencourage you to think a little bit\nabout why you tie those two things\ntogether\nbecause last time i checked love and\nmoney are two very different things\nlove and forgiveness are also two very\ndifferent things\nright if someone does something bad to\nme i can forgive them without loving\nthem like clearly\nit's possible\nand so\nlove without forgiveness is also\npossible as well\nand so be super careful about what you\ninterpret as love or where what love\nmeans to you and this is where this kind\nof introspection can help people a lot\nbecause oftentimes what you'll discover\nis that in your upbringing people have a\nparticular love language what was the\ndemonstration of love what does love\nmean to you oh like my parents would get\neach other very very expensive gifts for\ntheir birthdays and their anniversary\nand there was a large material\ncomponent to love that i saw in my\nhousehold therefore\nwhen\ni get really really upset and i think\nthat my partner doesn't love me because\nthey didn't get spend 10 grand on my\nbirthday i feel unloved like\nlook into that\nright introspect understand where that\ncomes from\nbut generally speaking i don't think\nthat unconditional love is that\nunhealthy but it can sort of become\nunhealthy if you start attaching other\nthings to the love\nyou"
