    "transcript": "if you're using your own money to gamble\nbecause you're a gambling addict that's\none thing like it's not great it's\npretty bad\nbut you're an adult making your own\ndecision decisions with your own money\nit gets muddy when you are being paid to\npromote that casino and the kids that\nare watching have the ability to sign up\nthey don't have verification to put\nmoney in but they do have verification\nto take money out so if they find out\nyou're under 21 you won't get your money\nor you're under whatever gambling wow\nyou won't get your money they know what\nthey're doing there are a lot of like\npeople who could be budding\ninto school shooters\nright so the kid who is 18 got there\nsomehow whether it's mental illness\nwhether it's indoctrination whether it's\nlike being a part of an echo chamber is\nprobably a combination of all of the\nabove most of the time it's like good\nhumans\ni work with a couple people who are\nactually bad humans they'll say like how\ndo i be less of a bad human like i want\nto be a better human i would like to\nunderstand how they started to believe\nthe things that they believe you know\nwhat were they trying to accomplish like\nlike i'd like to understand not just the\nfruit that comes off of the tree\nbut where did the leaves come from how\ndid the tree grow what was the sapling\nand what was the seed\none two three four\nfive six seven eight\n9 10.\nokay\nyeah i'm sorry what did you say i was\njust saying it's it's been\na tragedy\nbut\nno i was just agreeing yeah it's it's\nunfortunate times\nyeah i mean what do you why do you think\nthis is happening like more and more and\nmore\noh i have no idea i couldn't even\npretend to come up with a valid reason\num hold on a second charlie sorry i'm\nmy headphones seem to be crapping out on\nme\nuh no worries\nyeah so you were saying you you couldn't\neven begin to provide a reason\nnah i have no idea i think\nmore and more people retreat into their\nown\n[ __ ] up landscapes mainly just\nuh i think from online being terminally\nonline\nand they just retreat into themselves\nand come up with some terrible terrible\nideas\num how do you think that happens when\nyou say like retreat into their online\nspaces\ni think they just feel so alone and\nthey'll read a bunch of [ __ ] and maybe a\ncouple like-minded unfortunate souls and\nthey\nstart to provide a negative feedback\nloop and then they just\nkeep\nstaying in there and they just become\nvery\nunpleasant\nany idea what\nso you know\nhere at hg we try to help the internet\nwith their mental health\neducating people\nhopefully guiding people sometimes\noffering things like coaching services\num what what is there anything you think\nwe can do\nlike not not just us but also like\nstreamers\nthe internet\ngamers\ni\nhave no idea uh i really couldn't tell\nyou i\ncan't pretend to understand the mindset\nof a lot of\nthese [ __ ] up people\ni don't know what makes them do the [ __ ]\nthey do or feel the way they feel\ni just think that there's a huge element\nat play where\nthey see people\nthat may or may not be in\njust an awful spot like they are and\nthen they start giving each other\nterrible terrible ideas and\npoisoning each other and then it's kind\nof like a situation where because they\nhave so much access to so many people\nall the time\nthey just become diseased from it what\ndo you mean by that so much access to so\nmany people all the time\nyou can always find someone who believes\nin whatever garbage you believe in\nthere's always going to be groups for it\nso you can always find an echo chamber\nto associate yourself with and that just\nreinforces it\nand how do you know\nso when you're saying you can always\nfind someone to believe in the garbage\nyou believe in\nhow do you know\nwhat's garbage and what isn't\ni guess you'd never really do it unless\nyou know you're out from the outside\nperspective so something like the\njfk being revived and cruising through\ndallas to announce his presidency to\nsomeone of i would say\nordinary body and mind that sounds\nridiculous\nbut then you have so many people that\nbelieve it and have been camping outside\nof dallas that that road that he was\nclaiming to be that 4chan claimed he'd\nbe driving down for months\noh they're still there i thought that\nthey sort of figured out that he wasn't\nshowing up\nnope there's still a couple people that\nshow up every now and then but they no\nlonger do the big ceremonies what\nceremonies were they doing\nthey used to do candlelight vigils and\nwait for jfk to ride through\nfascinating do you know much about that\nyeah it started as a 4chan joke to q\nanon they made a post as queue\nsaying that they had evidence to support\nthat jfk junior had been revived and\nthen they gave a date i don't remember\nthe date\nit was i think it was like november of\n2021 or something that he he and donald\ntrump would be cruising through some\nstreet in dallas to announce their 2024\npresidential run\nand they sat out there and waited that\nentire day it didn't happen they came\nback the next day still didn't happen\nand continued that for about a month or\nso they they said he had been revived\nlike he was literally brought back from\nthe dead\nyep uh initially they said that he was\nrevived but i think they tried to change\nit to be more believable so they said\nthat he never actually died and had just\nbeen in hiding so they started using\npictures of people's hands to prove that\nthey were jfk junior's hands\nwhat\nused pictures of people's hands to prove\nthat they were jfk's hands yeah there's\na here\nhere i'll send you the picture that they\nused for evidence\nit was\nwhere is it i think it was a pres a\npresidential photo of trump when he was\nsigning something there was some guy in\nthe background who had hands that they\nsaid were jfk junior's hands and they\nused that as evidence to support their\nclaim that jfk jr is still alive\nlet's see if i can find that photo\ninsane dude\nit's it's wild what do you think is\ngoing on and do you prefer like moist or\ncritical or charlie or\nyou can just call me charlie so charlie\nlike\nlike what's go like why are all these\necho chambers forming on the internet\nlike what do you think is going on man\naccess you can like i said you can\nalways find anyone who believes anything\nso then once you find that group you\njust keep to yourselves in your own\nlittle bubble\nand you just feed off each other's\nparanoia\nhmm\nyeah it's kind of it's kind of\ninteresting i i wonder about some of\nthese things so when we've done some\nsome we've been\ni guess in a sense like\nsupporting budding in cells in this\ncommunity for a while like in terms of\nyou know helping them hopefully get out\nof their echo chambers so we've\ninterviewed several incels on stream\num\nsort of challenged some of their beliefs\nand ideas it's really interesting i saw\na recent study where uh someone actually\nlooked at\ncharacteristics that\nsome that lead to attractiveness\nand it turns out that like\njawline or sorry not attractiveness but\nmale characteristics that correlate with\nsexual activity and maybe even having\nkids\nand facial structures actually like\ndoesn't correlate at all\nso some of these beliefs right that like\na jawline or the chad jar or whatever is\nlike\nimportant in terms of being able to mate\nand some of these other\nsort of pseudo-scientific beliefs but\nreally the only thing that seemed to\nstrongly correlate was muscularity which\nis something that's controllable but\nyeah you all that's i think that's like\na positive thing to hear because you\nhave control over your muscularity yep\nyou just need to commit to it something\nthat you can never change though is\nheight and that's a tough one yeah so i\nthink height may have been a small\ncorrelation but wasn't very big uh so a\nlot of people\nyou know do think that height is a\nis basically a nail in the coffin if\nyou're below a certain height that\nyou know you're not going to be able to\nhave a successful romantic relationship\nbut it doesn't seem like the research\nreally supports that conclusion\nno but that's always going to be like\ntheir smoking gun a lot i know a lot of\nthe insults because we used to do that\non the podcast sometimes one of our\nco-hosts would talk to them directly\nthey usually always bring up height so\nit seems like a lot of the insults are\non the shorter side of things\ncan you tell me what you mean by that\nit's something we talked about a lot on\nthe podcast\nyeah so i have a podcast with four\nbuddies of mine and one of them's like a\nan in-cell epidemiologist he's been on\nthe forefront of plotting the incel\ncourse since about 2016. interesting\nover the course yeah over the course of\nthe years he's like talked to them\ninterviewed them and everything so i've\nlearned a lot about them from that guy\nhis name's kaya\nand what does he what has he\nconcluded\nthat a lot of them are just too far gone\nuh\nno matter what he's said or what\nhe's tried to say\nthey are always somehow coming up with\nexcuses for why it's beyond salvation\nand that they're just gonna be\nforever alone loser loners and they will\nalways hate women\nat least some of them but to be fair\nkaya's only talked to like the most\nextreme of themselves\nyeah i was gonna say i that hasn't\nreally been my experience in terms of\nthe insults we've worked at i think a\nlot of them are very decent good human\nbeings\nand also seem to be more attractive than\nthey give themselves credit for but\num\nyeah i mean what do\nanything in particular you want to talk\nabout today\nno i'm good for whatever you want man\ni'm an open book ready to discuss\nwhatever and i can't find this picture\nof the hands anymore because you crack\ndown on conspiracies so hard\nuh\nyeah so charlie i one of the things that\ni really like respect about you is i\njust\nlike to hear you talk about stuff\nlike i think my favorite i don't know if\nthis is stuff that you stream at some\npoint but i i'll watch your youtube\nchannel from time to time and sometimes\nyou'll just like talk about stuff like i\nstill remember when you were talking\nabout um\nthere was one video that you made\ntalking about how gender reveal parties\nwere stupid and that this is going to\nend badly and then like a week or two\nlater like someone started a wildfire\nthrough a gender reveal of fireworks\nand so there are a couple of things that\nyou've just you know you've opined on\nand so i was just really hoping to\nkind of hear\nanything that's been bouncing around in\nyour head if you've come to any\nconclusions recently what you've kind of\nbeen keeping up with i think there's a\nlot of you know there's a lot of talk\nabout\nuh the johnny depp amber heard trial\nthere's a lot of you know talk about\nmass shootings like those are kind of\nthe two things that were just top of\nmind for me today\nbut\ni also see that you still have a a quite\nmagnificent pokemon collection\nyeah\nso it seems like that was not a\ntemporary thing the last time we talked\nno i actually finished the collection\nfor yu-gi-oh mainly pokemon i i i\nfinished mainly what i wanted there but\nyugioh was the big one for me which i\nfinished the collection what finish the\ncollection means that you you have all\nof the cards now what is what exactly\nthe ones that i wanted yeah all the\ncards i was going for\nyeah\nso i no longer have to do that any of\nthose um\nany any of those topics seem appealing\nto you\nyeah whichever ones you want to talk\nabout i myself haven't been diving too\ndeep into anything super serious the\nmain thing i've been like i guess\nresearching is morbius so\nvery\nit's a superhero movie that\nmeme culture had almost propelled it to\nbeing profitable despite it being an\nabsolutely dog [ __ ] movie it's just i\nfind it really fascinating what do you\nthink\ncan you yeah tell me about it\nit's so morbius is the latest marvel\nstinker it was\ncame out in april 1st i think\nand no one saw it because no one cared\nabout it it was kind of just a dead-on\narrival movie stars jared leto who most\npeople don't like anyway\nand it gained notoriety online because\nit was a superhero big budget production\nthat nobody was watching so people\nstarted memeing about it like morbius is\nthe highest grossing film of all time it\nhas a two thousand percent on rotten\ntomatoes it's morbid time time to get\nmore morb sweet morb summer and from all\nof these memes people actually went to\nsee the film just to be in on the joke\nand it's made 150 million which is more\nthan it's spent on production probably\nnot marketing but that's a movie that\ninstantly flopped but then got a second\nwin because of memes it's like one of\nthose b-rated uh\nyou know b-list films that people will\nwatch because it's so bad\nyep yeah the movie itself is boring bad\nit's not like a entertainingly bad movie\nbut the memes around it are what's\nentertaining so people see it to be in\non the memes interesting\nso have you seen it\nyeah i saw it opening day it was a\npretty much empty theater it's bad it's\na very bad movie wait so opening day was\nempty theater so yeah how did people\nknow that it was bad on opening day\nso they did like pre-release screenings\nand almost everyone even like the most\nchilly of studios or uh sites were\nsaying it's bad like it's not a good\nmovie so people's expectations were\nsuper low and then opening day the few\nthat saw it started making fun of it\nimmediately and then the memes started\nto snowball\nhow do you think movies like that get\nmade\nuh so it's it's marvel but it was\nproduced by sony and sony has a history\nof just making\nthrowaway garbage for the sake of\nkeeping their rights so like the most\nrecent fantastic four movie this just\nstrikes me as a movie that was just made\nbecause it needed to be and there was\nreally nothing else put into it\nwhat what do you mean by that it's a\nmovie that was made just to keep their\nrights how does that do you know how\nthat works\nfrom what i recall sony has a deal with\nmarvel where they get the rights to\nspider-man fantastic four and i guess\nmorbius by extension but only as long as\nthey actively use the ip\nso every few year well for fantastic\nfour i think it was 10 years i think\nit's every 10 years or whatever they\nhave to make a movie or it might be\nconfusing with fox i think it's fox that\nmight have done fantastic four but it\nshould be the same deal that to keep the\nrights they have to actively engage with\nthe ip\ngot it so they have to at least produce\nsomething\nyeah and i think it's it might have been\nfox for fantastic four\nand so it seems like this morbius movie\nis sort of like uh it almost reminds me\nof like a little bit of gamestop where\nyou know it it's uh\ni mean i as i understand with gamestop\nit was actually like undervalued right\nso that's there was that one guy on\nreddit\num who was like doing an analysis and\nwas saying like even though\nbrick and mortar game stores may be\non the sharp sharp decline because of\nonline sales\neven then gamestop is like\nundervalued and then i think somehow he\nalso found out that\neveryone was like short selling it\nthey were short selling more shares than\nexisted\nwhich i i still don't understand exactly\nhow that's possible but\ni don't know yeah i don't i don't get\nthat either and for morbius though no\none's making money they're just making\nmemories with memes\n[Laughter]\nyeah so gamestop i also heard is is\nmaking some kind of nft thing\nyeah they're transitioning to nfts from\nwhat i read i didn't get to go too deep\ninto it but it seems like the logical\nprogression for gamestop\nwhat do you think about nfts\ni'm not a fan i think they're all a scam\nwhat how do you arrive at that\nconclusion\nuh\nso the big thing with nfts is the the\ncrypto bros will usually buy their own\nnfts for a huge price just to promote it\non twitter like i'm a struggling art\nstudent i made this nft and it just sold\nfor 20 grand on openc\nand then they resell it for like 18 or\nsomething hoping that a legitimate sale\ncomes in so they make money but it's\nbeen proven multiple times that they are\nliterally buying their own nfts just for\na high price to mark it up and i also\nthink all the board apes and all the\nboard ape clones are just really lazy\ncash grabs\ncan you tell me i mean i've heard a\nlittle bit about this stuff but i'm not\ntoo familiar with it what's up with the\nboard ape and board ape clones\nit's\neveryone\nbelieves they're gonna make money off it\nbut no one wants to be the last person\nholding a board ape so they buy into the\nhype they get aboard ape for an\nastronomical price like 500 grand or\nsomething they squat on it for a little\nwhile let the hype continue to fester\nand then eventually hope to turn it\naround for more money than they paid for\nno one actually wants the board apes\nit's just they want to hold it long\nenough just long enough to get a sucker\nto pay more for it\nso it's just something that has\nabsolutely no\nuse or value other than making money off\nhype so d do you what do you think about\ncrypto do you think how much of this\ncorrelates with crypto and how much of\nnfts are you think like quite different\nfrom crypto because a lot of because you\nrefer to the crypto bros right\nyeah i actually i don't i think crypto's\nfine like the main coins and everything\ni got into crypto in 2016\nand while there's a lot of like really\nshady ones and a lot of dog [ __ ] i think\nthere is a future for it but that future\ni don't think involves nfts even in the\nslightest at all it's just that idea of\nhaving that crypto blockchain ledger i\nthink could have practical use down the\nline but i also just don't really like\nthe crypto broke community either so i\ndon't care if it hits zero even though i\nhave crypto of my own\nwhat do you think is the value in crypto\nso like being able to have that ledger\nwhich has proven to be great for\nexposing scammers and [ __ ] i think is\nvaluable for like a business if you need\nto keep track of things and since it's\nso quick and updated so like\ninstantaneously i think it just makes it\nfor like a good customer service\nexperience for a business or at least it\ncould\nwhat do you mean by that\nso like if\num so for example if you're buying\nsomething and you want to know the\nhistory of the item you can immediately\njust look up everything and every owner\nevery price and everything like that so\nyou can instantly know if what you're\ndealing with is legitimate or escape i\nsee okay so the decentralized\ninformation that's available\nlets you track things yeah but i also\ndon't know if it'll ever get to that\npoint outside of scams i just think\nthere is a possibility where crypto is a\nlegitimate thing right now i don't think\nit is so if it hits zero before then i\nthink it's probably deserved too\nwhat what what do you think needs to\nhappen for it to reach that point\ni i bro i don't know\nthey they need to shut off everyone with\na board a picture on twitter it's\nkilling it's killing all of it it's so\nbad it's it's so bad\nyeah i was i was reading a little bit\nabout um\nbitcoin and so i guess elon musk bought\na bunch of bitcoin\nand then a few days or a few weeks maybe\ni think it was days he announced that\ntesla would be taking bitcoin\nas payment\nyeah and then bitcoin prices shot up\nand then they said they won't take it\nanymore yeah and then so it's unclear\nwhether he sold it or what he did with\nall of his bitcoin and then like a week\nlater he was like yeah we decided not to\ntake it and then bitcoin prices dropped\ni know it's crazy\nthat's but that's like the whole nature\nof crypto that's why it's so hard to be\nlike enthusiastic about it because it's\n[ __ ] like that pretty much everyone in\ncrypto is the most annoying person that\nyou can listen to\nso it has such a negative reputation\nso why do you think people get into\ncrypto\nto make money i think the only reason\npeople are in crypto is fomo and trying\nto make some quick cash off of it\nbecause they've seen a lot of other\npeople make money off it so to them it's\njust like early enough where they're\nconvinced they can still make a big\npayday out of it\ni i i think we have i remember talking\nto um\ni'm blanking on the name now but uh\ni think anthony milinakis\nyeah he was an early crypto yeah or like\nsuper early like we're talking like\nearly 2000s like\nyou know so he he made a ton of money on\nbitcoin but\num yeah it's interesting man i i don't\nknow like\ni'm i'm not really too much into crypto\nbut\neven i've been sort of i work with a lot\nof people in finance and\nit seems like\nespecially some of the stuff with like\ntether and things like that are like\nvery very shady\noh yeah luna is the big one right now\nluna used to be the fourth most traded\ncrypto and in seven days it went to one\nfiftieth of a penny it crashed from a\nhundred dollars a token to a one\nfiftieth of a penny in seven days i\nhaven't been following what's going on\nwith luna can you fill me in\nso i don't really fully understand it\nbut their\ntheir head guy dokwan was actually on\nbow ties his live stream like the day\nbefore it started crashing talking about\nlike how it's entertaining to watch [ __ ]\ncrash and it was ironic because the next\nday his [ __ ] just completely exploded\nbut from the videos i watched trying to\nbreak down the situation it seems like\nfrom the get-go it was built like a\nponzi scheme and it finally crumbled\nafter dokuan made so many enemies that\nactively wanted it to fail so there are\npeople betting like 20 million dollars\nagainst luna uh and like actively coming\nup and presenting how you can exploit\nluna and how it could theoretically fall\ninstantly into a death spiral and i\nthink with all of this compounding on\ntop of each other all at the same time\nit just started to collapse because it\nbecame very clear to a lot of people\nit's pretty shady but how can you how\ndoes 20 million dollars cause how can\nyou bet because i think you can't like\nshort a cryptocurrency right like you\ncan't you kind of can from what i\nunderstand the so the bet i'm talking\nabout is there's a big guy on crypto who\nis publicly making fun of dokwan and\nthen said i'm betting you 10 million\ndollars this [ __ ] will be you know lower\nthan it is right now in a year\nand then doklan's like all right bet\nhe's like you know i changed my mind i'm\nupping it to 20 and dokwan stayed silent\non that but they did bet 10 million into\na public account uh betting against luna\nand then other people started betting\nagainst it as well and it became common\nknowledge that if you had enough money\nthere was a way where you could\ninstantly keep spitting out 50 million\ndollars from luna and driving the price\ndown and down down until it death\nspirals and depends how does that what\ndo you mean\nbut\nwho's taking the other side so i\nunderstand if this guy dokuan is\ntaking the other side of the 10 million\ndollar bet but how can other people bet\nagainst luna so they had something\ncalled a stable coin an algorithmically\nstable stable coin which historically\nalways fails and if they could de-peg\nthat stable coin the whole thing\ncollapses and that's what they were\nproving i think again i don't fully\nunderstand it this is i'm just trying my\nbest to regurgitate the videos i watched\nso the idea was if you had enough money\nwhich luna was generating billions there\nwere some huge whales in there that did\nhave enough money if you had enough\nmoney you could bet against luna and\nde-peg that stable coin by doing\nsomething and i don't remember what yeah\nso i'm that sort of makes sense because\ni saw that you know there was tether was\nsupposed to trade at\none the whole point is that it's\nsupposed to be pegged to the dollar\nright yep and and i saw that tether at\nsome point was trading for like 99 cents\nor somehow the peg got removed but\nit you know it's crypto is something\nthat it sounds like both of us are sort\nof peripherally aware of but not really\nlike experts in and the funny thing\nabout that is i'm not sure that\nthe people who are experts in crypto are\nactually experts in crypto\nno one is really an expert in crypto\nit's such a wild wasteland uh good news\nthough to all the lunatics out there\nthat's what they call themselves dokwan\nhas announced luna 2.0 baby tara luna is\nback and better than ever and people are\nalready buying it it's the most pathetic\nthing i've seen on twitter in a minute\nwhat what is what does that mean what is\nluna 2.0 he's just starting he just\nhe relaunched it and people are buying\nit what how does that work how do you\nhe just relaunched it he just literally\nsaid all right luna's dead here's 2.0\ndoes that mean he lost the bat\nyup so he lost the bet i don't think\nhe's ever going to pay up but yeah he\nlost the bet i thought you said they\nthey put money into a public account\nthey did but he still has to like\nconfirm the transaction last i saw oh\nwow interesting\nand and yeah so\ncharlie any idea where these people come\nfrom like these people who are making\nthe\nthe coins\ni couldn't tell you man so dokwan he's\nan actual billionaire because of his\n[ __ ] coin and i've never heard of him\nbefore this i actually well that's not\ntrue i looked him up a little bit\napparently he tried one unsuccessful\n[ __ ] coin in 2020 that didn't work\nso i'm guessing he just started taking\nprotocols like contracts from other\ncryptos and then eventually got lucky\nwith luna i don't know i really don't\nknow\ninteresting\nthe world is changing man i know it's\nwild it's absolutely wild\num anything in particular you think is\nlike\nextra crazy\num\ni guess\nstaying in the same ballpark just the\ndelusion from people that are buying\nluna 2.0 right now it makes me sad like\nit's i don't know reading their comments\nbecause when it crashed people lost\neverything because they believed so\nheavily in crypto so there were posts\nabout like how much they've lost as well\nas how much that money meant to them and\nthen people legitimately talking about\nhow they're now suicidal and need like\nprofessional assistance it was sad and\nthen those same people are buying into\nluna 2.0\nit's i don't know it's just sad to see\nyeah i mean i think so i mean so we i\nwas\nwe had i forget why but some something\ncame up and i just shared some thoughts\nabout crypto on on stream a couple weeks\nago and just why i think crypto is like\nfundamentally like different\nin some of the psychology there's\nactually like a lot of different um\ni sort of sketched out maybe even like a\nlecture series about like the psychology\nof like cryptocurrency\nbut a lot of it is like\nnot quite so what some people may think\nis that there's some cost fallacy here\nwhich is like okay like i've already\nlost all my money you know so if you if\ni go to a casino and i lose a hundred\ndollars the only way i think i can get\nit back\nis by gambling again right like if i i\nwas up a hundred bucks at one point now\ni'm down 100 bucks the only way to make\nmyself whole which is a strong bias that\nhumans have is to keep gambling\nthe interesting thing about crypto is i\nthink there's more to it than that\nit's not just the sunk costs fallacy\nit's the idea that\nevery time i do this\ni understand the game a little bit\nbetter and it's my ignorance last time\nthat like because you know luna was you\nwere saying trading at 100 right and so\nthis time like i know when is the right\ntime to get out so it's kind of like\nsome cost fallacy but i think every you\nknow i'm not surprised that people are\nsort of like well\nwhat happened with luna i'm sure if i\ntalk to people what they'll say is yeah\nwhat happened with luna was that\na group of people just basically tanked\nthe coin but if that had not happened\nif this rare event where dokuan took the\nbet had not happened then i would be\nrich\nand there's actually this this other\nkind of it's interesting because there's\nactually a lot of neuroscience and\npsychology into this there's this part\nof your brain that engages in something\ncalled counter factual thinking\nwhich is when you go back into the past\nand you\nkind of like rewrite history if i had\ndone this\ndot dot dot then things would be\ndifferent today\nwhich is like it's an adaptive sort of\nlike part of the mind it's like you know\nif i screw something up how do i learn\nhow to do it properly i go back in time\nand i think to myself oh i shouldn't\nhave said that or i shouldn't have done\nthat or whatever and then you like learn\nhow to behave in the future\nand so i think we're seeing this kind of\nthing in crypto where everyone like\npeople screw up and they're like oh now\ni know\nhow to do it right and so this time\nit'll work because i've learned my\nlesson\nyeah that's a really good point it's\nkind of the same mentality when it comes\nto gambling like if i had just got out\nthree hands ago when i was up i would\nhave won this money now i know for next\ntime but then you still never get out at\nthe right time or anything like that\nit's the same with crypto yeah well\nit's so it seems right so i think that\nthat's definitely the case but um\nyeah i mean do you what do you think\nabout i i know that there's been a lot\nof of streamers who've gotten flack\nrecently for um you know gambling\nstreams and\ni know crypto sponsors a lot of\nstreamers and stuff like that what do\nyou think about that stuff\ni\nfor crypto sponsors like coinbase or\nlike binance or something i don't have\nlike a problem with it because it is\njust crypto exchanges as far as i know\nthey they don't do anything besides just\nsell the coins\nbut when it comes to stake which is the\nbig one i think that's always in a\nreally sketchy area because you're\ngetting paid in their money to promote\nit if you're using your own money\nbecause you're a gambling addict it's\none thing it's you know it's still not\ngood but if you're using a company's\nmoney to get people to sign up to it\nespecially when you can sign up under\nage with no problem at all because stake\njust allows you to sign up as long as\nyou have a pulse there's no verification\nthen it's a completely different issue i\nthink\nso but so steak is not an exchange it's\na it's a gambling website or something\nyeah it's you know it's an online crypto\ncasino online crypto casino what does\nthat mean\nuh you play the slots you play roulette\nyou play\nall the the classic games but with\ncrypto on their casino oh interesting so\nwhat crypto do you play with\nwhatever crypto you put in so you can\nsign up at any age there's no\nverification interesting\nyeah if if you're eight years old and\nyou accidentally got a hold of your\nparents coinbase account you can send\nsome bitcoin to a stake account you just\nmade and just start gambling there's no\nverification\nwow i think that's a big problem that's\nactually part of the i know this may\nsound kind of weird but i wonder if like\nthat because that's part of the in a\nsense the advantage of crypto right like\nso\na big part of and and maybe this is a\ncontroversial statement but i thought\nthe whole point or a big part of crypto\nis that it is\nto a certain degree like\nunrestricted\nright so it's like all on the blockchain\nso there isn't any particular government\nwho can track your moves block your\nmoves things like that that it's the the\nwhole point of crypto is that it's like\nit's a free currency that can be\nused however you kind of want to as long\nas someone else is willing to take it\nyeah pretty much but i that doesn't\napply when it comes to gambling since\nit's so heavily regulated in the states\nyou're not even allowed to be on the\nsame carpet as slot machines in a real\ncasino but crypto skirts that by being\nan online one and since they don't\nverify age to play anyone can sign up\nwhich is the big problem\num\nwhat do you say what do you mean when\nyou say you're not allowed to be on the\nsame carpet as slot machines what does\nthat mean if you're under 21 and you go\nto like a hard rock there's carpets that\nthe slot machines are on and if you are\nunder 21 you're not allowed to be on\nthat carpet at all on that floor no id\nyou if if you're under 21 they kick you\nout on the spot\ninteresting\nso it seems like there's there's a lack\nof regulation for these online and is\nthe lack of regulation because it's\nonline or because it's crypto\ni think just because it's crypto i i\nthink the big thing is since it's a\ncrypto casino and no one has really you\nknow\ncome up with any solutions to the the\nissue of kids being able to sign up that\nthey just don't bother they're they're\njust not aware of it\nso like\nlike i said if you're using your own\nmoney to gamble because you're a\ngambling addict that's one thing like\nit's not great it's pretty bad\nbut you're an adult making your own\ndecision decisions with your own money\nit gets muddy when you are being paid to\npromote that casino and the kids that\nare watching have the ability to sign up\nwith no problems at all that's a huge\nlike problem that's an actual like crime\nin the real world but since it's online\nand it's a crypto casino there's nothing\nto stop it from happening if everyone\nthat was watching like a sponsored steak\nstream was of the proper gambling age\nand they make that decision to go gamble\nafter watching their favorite streamer\ndo it i still don't think it's a great\nthing because they're going to lose a\nlot of money and that money they lose\ndirectly profits to streamers not\namazing but they're adults making that\ndecision kids don't know any better and\nthey can freely sign up to these casinos\nno problem and i think that's a big\nissue so what i'm kind of hearing is\nactually that the the biggest problem is\nsort of the sign up process or the lack\ni think i think the biggest problem is\nthe actual casino which is steak\ninteresting\nyeah i'm not really sure you know so i\nkeep up with some of this stuff but like\nquite peripherally and i and\nyou know i know that\ni saw a clip from mischief where i think\nhe was\nbeing quite honest and and i really\nappreciated what he said and he was like\nyou know everyone has their price and\nit's like\nit's hard when someone comes to you and\noffers you it just occurred to me i\ndon't know if you have any you know\ngambling sponsors or stuff but\nno\ni may have been studying i i wasn't\nparticularly trying to attack anyone but\ni think it's just you know it's\nsomething that's there's a lot that's\nchanging in the world and i just like\nhearing your thoughts about that kind of\nstuff\nyeah no it's too it's it's a completely\ndifferent landscape it's all\nvery different now things have become a\nlot shadier if you ask me uh there's a\nlot of under the table kind of [ __ ]\ngoing on like drake was doing a steak\nsponsored stream last night and there\nwasn't even like a hashtag ad in the\ntitle or anything so i don't know it's\njust uh it's it's a little wacky a\nlittle weird out there why do you think\nthings are getting shadier how's that\nbecause you they're finding ways to go\naround like the the\nnorm so it's really lucrative to be a\nmoral it seems people beg to be scammed\nyou can see it in crypto for example\npeople just keep falling for luna 2.0 so\nif you take advantage of these people\nthat are really gullible and everyone\nwants to make a quick buck you can make\nso much money off of it it's just super\neasy and it's hard to resist that\ntemptation for a lot of these companies\ni guess\nyeah so you know charlie one thing i'd\npush back on a little bit you know\nhaving worked with people who i think\nwould be called immoral is that i think\noftentimes these you know people don't\nthink that they're being immoral\nwell i'm not talking about individuals\ni'm talking about the companies i'm\ntalking about companies taking advantage\nof it\nsteak has put so much money into getting\neverything on twitch a stake sponsored\nslot machine stream\npretty much all of the people gambling\nright now are gambling on stake and\nthey've done a lot of money to ensure\nthat's the case\ni'm talking about the company\nspecifically i think a lot of people\nmaybe don't do it with like the worst\nintentions ever\nor anything like that but the companies\nthemselves absolutely know what they're\ndoing\nyeah that's that's interesting\nyeah i i don't know\ni'm just kind of like thinking through\nthat for a second because i\ni think oftentimes i\ni'm not disagreeing with you but i just\ndon't really know and one of the things\nthat i try to do is like reserve\njudgment on\nsomeone's intentions until i've actually\ntalked to them\nyou know and at the same time i think\nthat it's not an\nunreasonable claim to make that stake\nknows what they're doing or that they're\ntrying to be purposefully predatory one\nthing that i can attest to is that i\nknow that a lot of people will accuse\npublic people or companies of being\npurposefully predatory and i i\npersonally don't see it that way if i've\nhad some kind of relationship with them\nand have sort of really heard their\ntheir perspective\nyeah absolutely so i make the claim\nabout steak because they very well aware\nof what they're doing they're an\noffshore casino\nthere i don't remember where they're\nstationed but it's in like a really lax\ngambling\narea where they're able to do a lot of\nshady [ __ ] they don't have verification\nto put money in but they do have\nverification to take money out so if\nthey find out you're under 21 you won't\nget your money or you're under whatever\ngambling wow\nyou won't get your money they know what\nthey're doing yeah that\nthat kind of stuff i think really wow\nyou can\nyou need verification to get your money\nout but not to put money in that's\nreally interesting\nthat's wow i think that one's one of the\ncompanies you can say with a high level\nof confidence they're not ignorant they\nknow exactly what they're doing\ninteresting yeah that changes things a\nlot i mean because i like i said i try\nto reserve judgment but\nyou know that sort of\nsounds kind of shady\nyeah it absolutely is and i don't think\nevery company is as bad as steak or as\negregious as steak when it comes to\nthings like that so i do definitely\nunderstand your perspective there but\nfor steak in particular the one that i\nwas talking about i absolutely think you\ncan make the claim that they're very\nwell aware and very predatory\nwhat do you think is so so you mentioned\num that things seem to be getting\nshadier right like\nand people are sort of learning to skirt\nthe rules i'm also sort of noticing that\nmaybe the rules can't keep up\nlike\nsome sometimes so i was kind of thinking\na little bit about all the school\nshootings and stuff and everyone's\ntalking about gun control which i think\nis definitely a piece of the the puzzle\nand there's good data that shows that\npeople have done comparative studies\nbetween like the us the uk and australia\nthat basically show that\nculturally like in terms of values and\npreferences and stuff like that\nthese three nations tend to be like\npretty similar they also have similar\nsomewhat similar demographics somewhat\nsimilar socioeconomic status\nthings like that like the economies and\nforms of government are like relatively\nsimilar\nand that um you know the uk and\naustralia have far fewer shootings\nbecause\nthey seem to have gun control laws and\nthere also appears to be a causal\nrelationship there where\ni think australia maybe 20 or 30 years\nago like instituted stronger gun control\nand\nprior to those laws passing they were\nsimilar in terms of the us like per\ncapita number of deaths and things like\nthat\nbut i i think that\nwhen we're sort of looking at this stuff\nlike it's more than that so one of the\nthings that i've been wondering a lot\nabout is that to my knowledge\ngun control hasn't gotten that much\nworse in the us like i don't know if\nyou're\nyou keep up with this stuff or not but\nlike you know i think like guns were\npretty available a lot of people had a\nlot of guns like 20 or 30 years ago in\nthe united states\nbut what has changed is is the internet\nand and like mental health and some of\nthese other factors\num any thoughts about any of that\nyeah so what you just said is something\ni thought about a little bit uh it's not\nsomething i think about too often\nbecause i just i find it to be a really\ndepressing topic that i don't have an\nanswer for\nbut i do remember growing up i had a lot\nmore access to like being around guns in\npublic i remember there was like\nconvenience stores that would have guns\nfor sale\nthat's not really the case anymore uh\nnow it seems like there's it's a little\nbit more difficult to like find them in\nthe wild but it seems the process is\nstill pretty easy i think there is merit\nthat\nto the claim that maybe they should at\nleast increase the age or something\nbecause 18 is probably a little young\nespecially considering it seems to work\nto some level pretty much every mass\nshooter is 18\nthey literally get the gun when they're\n18 and then commit the crime so they\ndidn't do it when they were 17 they're\nnot getting it illegally at 17 years old\nmaybe just wait a little bit longer\nmaybe make the age a little bit later\nmight help i don't really know but i\ndon't think gun control has gotten super\nrelaxed i actually think it's a little\nharder to find guns now than when i was\ngrowing up\ni grew up in florida so maybe i was just\naround like all the really like wild\ngun-toting areas but\nnow i don't have guns for sale at\nconvenience stores around me when i'm\nout in public it's just one of those\nthings where i think people have been\nchanging probably because of them\nfeeling so\nlike isolated or like locked in these\nreally unhealthy echo chambers online i\nreally think that is a big contributing\nfactor yeah i do too and i think that's\nwhere part of what i think is\nchallenging about this discussion is\nthat\num you know so i think there's good kind\nof scientific evidence that\nstronger gun control laws will make a\nsignificant impact on the problem\nand at the same time just like you\ni've actually found that gun i don't\nthink the availability of guns and\nover the course of my life is like\ndrastically increased i i mean i know\nthat there's a lot of\nyou know changes that have happened with\nlike semi-automatic or like i think the\nthe guy at uh you know from the school\nshooting last week was or sorry a couple\ndays ago wow it's already been\nfelt like a long time ago but that's\nprobably we're just getting numb to it\nbut he had like i think two ar-15s\nand i was also reading about how like\npeople actually fired shots at him\nbefore he even went into the school like\nhe crashed his car into a ditch\nand people tried to stop him and they\nlike opened fire on him and they just\nlet him go in\nyeah right that was pretty upsetting\nyeah it's wild um\nany sense about what we can do about\necho chambers\ni don't think there's anything you can\ndo about echo chambers that's the nature\nof the internet you will always find\nthese like [ __ ] poisonous pockets of\npeople that you'll just fall into and\nnever leave and to you it's normal but\nto everyone on the outside it's\ndangerous you know i have no doubt like\ni saw those text messages from the\nshooter i mean he's speaking like\nsomeone you would see in like a really\ndegenerate twitter group right like it's\njust these people that fall into these\nextreme groups and never leave and just\nnever get that like reality of wow this\nis bad\nyeah i think it's interesting so we\nwe've been doing\nsome research and supporting a couple of\norganizations who want to better\nunderstand some of these like internet\nbased phenomenon\nand one of the things one of the key\nthings that i think is happening that we\ndon't really appreciate is\nso when you\nwatch a youtube video\nyoutube\nwill recommend content right yeah and so\nwhat tends to get populated so i think\nthere are a couple of features on the\ninternet the first is that the most\nemotionally engaging content is what\nrises to the top\nso what we're sort of seeing is like the\nmore polarizing the content is the more\nlikely it is to be successful\nand so\nyou know click bait is an example of\nthat i think like one manifestation of\nthat core principle is clickbait so like\nthe more that you can emotionally engage\nsomeone through a thumbnail or a title\nand this is something that even people\nin our community have criticized us for\num and so it's something that we're kind\nof going back to the drawing board and\nkind of considering because i think\ntheir points are good\num\nbut so what what tends to happen is is\npeople like over time on the internet\nthere's this phenomenon called online\ndrift\nwhere what happens is you watch like one\nyoutube video and then youtube figures\nout\nthat in order to keep you engaged we're\ngoing to show you more of the same stuff\nand over time it'll like slowly\nradicalize you\nand so so it's really interesting and i\ndon't think it's like necessarily\nyoutube's fault because youtube's job\nfor example\nis just to give people the content that\nthey want to right there's like billions\nof youtube videos so it's it's in you\ni don't think it's like nefarious that\nthey're trying to help you sift through\nall of the content on youtube so that\nyou can have like a good experience\nthere like i know mine for example i\nrecently i have a bunch of elden ring\npvp videos popping up right and not like\ni'm glad like i that's what i'm\ninterested in\nbut the interesting thing is that if you\nlook at sort of how these echo chambers\nform it seems like a lot of this content\naggregation and like\ncontent like kind of pushing you in a\nparticular direction and what you'll\neven do is there's there have been\nstudies of online behavior and mass\nshooters and things like that\nwhat they discover is that there is this\nlike drift where you start out on\ntwitter\nand then you wind up on reddit and then\nyou wind up on subreddits\nand then like particular subreddits and\nlike more radical subreddits and then\nyou wind up on discord servers then you\nwind up on more radical discord servers\nand like over time you like\ndrift\nfrom\na general exposure to\nlike things that are radicalizing\nyeah that makes sense i haven't heard\nthat term before but that's definitely\nsomething that\nsounds like it's happening yeah i mean\nit's it's wild like just what\nas we look at what's happening on the\ninternet like sort of what we're doing\nto ourselves\nin terms of you know steering clear of\nof\njust gravitating towards content because\nthat's what we do and then as we\ngravitate towards content so i've been\nstruggling a lot to try to figure out\nlike what to do about this\nbut um\ni'm not quite sure because i think it's\nsort of like almost a\nmanifestation of like the laws of how\ninternet content\ndissemination works\nyeah i don't know if there is anything\nyou can do about it to be fair like even\nas the platforms i really don't know how\nmuch there is that you can control it\nseems like it's more of an individual\nthing where you're just constantly\nhungry for more and more content so you\nkeep drifting further and further down\nthe rabbit hole until you end up\nsomewhere weird\nyeah any weird rabbit holes that you've\nstumbled upon\ni don't know if i've stumbled on into\nany weird ones recently nothing too\ncrazy and nothing too new\nat least not that i can think of off the\ntop of my head mainly just like the luna\nstuff which isn't really a rabbit hole\nthat one's just\nlike a pit of misery\ni don't think there's anything\nanything weird did you hear about this\nlike\nmisinformation\num\ndivision or something that that the us\ngovernment recently started\ndid you know\nso so they i think they like tried to\nstart some kind of like\ndivision of like misinformation handling\nright because like there's a lot of like\nmisinformation around kovit and stuff\nlike that and i think it kind of got\ntorpedoed because it sounded very\ndraconian\nright so like\nmisinformation you know the control of\ninformation sounds quite sort of fascist\nor i don't know if fascist or\nauthoritarian is the right term but\nbut anyway it was just something that\ncrossed my mind because i i think they\ntried to sort of do something about it\nbut it seems like really really hard\nlike how do you know which information\nis correct\nyeah i don't know that's a that's a\npretty slippery slope and it's\ndefinitely not a cool sounding name yeah\nit just sounds evil\nright\nand people like chat are joking about\nministry of truth and things like that\nbut it's it's interesting because like\nthere is you know you could you as you\nwere saying earlier like you've got\nthese like people on 4chan\nthat are like\nuh jfk is still alive\ni know well it's that so 4chan\nthemselves doesn't believe it they just\ndo it because it [ __ ] with q anon and\nthey're just kind of like 4chan's lol\ncow because pretty much anything 4chan\ntells them people in that group believe\nwholeheartedly so they just make fun of\nthem through like these really goofy\nconspiracy ideas\nyeah what do you know about q anon\ni\ni don't really get it uh\ni just can't believe it's real\nso to me they're just kind of clowns\nthat do goofy [ __ ] but apparently\nthere's a lot of really like dangerous\nones too the only ones i ever see are\nthe ones waiting at that dallas street\nfor jfk junior's revival and stuff like\nthat and the ones that go around with\nsigns saying\nuh i don't know\nzack snyder's eating hollywood babies\nthese vampires in hollywood are real and\nstuff\nit just seems like it's a group of\npeople that believe any and all fanfic\nconspiracies hmm interesting yeah it's\nit's there's also been some recent\nstudies about\npsychology of like\nwhat people believe\nlike\nyou know what\nconspiracy theory kind of like\npersonality traits and things like that\nso i think it's people are trying to\ninvestigate like how it is that people\ncan believe this stuff\nbut yeah i just don't get it i don't\nknow how you get to that point where you\nactually believe in reality with your\nwhole heart that a man has been revived\nlike actually come back from the dead to\nrun for presidency it's just i don't\nknow i just blows my mind because these\naren't like\nmentally deranged people like they hold\na job they exist in society like they\ndon't stand out as\nyou know some kind of raving lunatic and\nyet somehow they still believe these\nthings and wait with candles outside of\nthat road waiting for jfk junior\nyeah so it's interesting because you use\nthe phrase mentally deranged or they're\nnot mentally deranged right yeah exactly\nlike they're just\naverage joes the god fearing american\nguys that for some reason believe this\nweird [ __ ] yeah i don't know so i think\nlike part of the the other thing that\ni've been sort of struggling with is\nwhere mental health or mental illness\nfits into this stuff\nright so like people who are investing\nin crypto like a lot of times what will\nhappen is\nyou'll get people who will kind of label\nthings\nas mental health or mental illness which\ni think has a fair\ni mean there's a certain truth to that\nand you know the top of the list is\ni think there's other oftentimes\nnot\nor\nblack-and-white discussions not nuanced\ndiscussions about whether school\nshooters are mentally ill\ndo you have any thoughts about that by\nthe way\ni think they absolutely are i would\ndefinitely be on the side that says\nanyone that\nlike actually commits a crime like that\nis mentally unwell i think i can say\nthat with a high level of confidence\nthat i would view them as a mentally\nunwell person\nso mentally unwell meaning what\ni would say i would go as far as to call\nthem like apps like actually like\nderanged there's something that went\nwrong in their brains that broke down a\nbarrier\nthat told them that this is something\nthat they can and should do\nso i would absolutely put them in like a\nlegitimate like arkham asylum for the\ncriminally insane\nlike i don't view them as having like\nmental\nawareness anymore like they've\ndeteriorated to a point that's almost\nlike sub-human to commit something like\nthat\nyeah so i know this is going to sound\nkind of weird but i'm not so sure\nand and that's where sometimes i think\nthat like\nwhen people do things that are\nunbelievable\noftentimes people will jump to the\nconclusion that their mind is not\nfunctioning properly\nright so like\nand this is where like if you look at\nthings like suicide bombers for example\nlike are suicide bombers do you think\nsuicide bombers are mentally ill\ni would say so you have to take your own\nlife like that for\nwhatever reason i would absolutely say\nthat\nyeah so i think that's where sometimes\nwhat i'm i'm almost hearing you say is\nthat if if a human being behaves in a\nmanner that is so contrary to what we\nconsider normal you would consider that\na mental illness\ni\ni guess a better way of illustrating the\npoint and this is this is going to uh\nsomething that i learned about a while\nago there was a guy in canada completely\nnormal guy from everything i read and\none day on a bus he snapped just stabbed\nthe completely random woman and then ate\nher eyeballs\noh did the stream just crash uh\nmy stream\nsomething happened with my\num\nsomething happened with my uh\nvideo card i think but it seems to have\nsorted itself out hold on\nyou can still hear me right yeah i can\nstill hear you okay\nall right you were saying sorry\nso there's this\nindividual in canada one day on a bus he\nsnapped he stabbed and beheaded a woman\nand ate her eyeballs on the bus in front\nof everyone with her decapitated head he\nwould scare people with it as they got\noff the bus and locked him in\nabsolute breakdown of mental sanity\nengaged in cannibalism\nabsolutely horrible stuff\nthat guy went to jail for i think eight\nyears and was let back into the general\nsociety they deemed it just like a brief\nepisode of psychosis or something like\nthat and i just disagree i think when\nsomeone crosses a line like that i don't\nview it as something that can you can\never come back from\nthat's someone that i don't think should\nhave ever been let back into society\neven if it was like a acute\nepisode of psychosis i just don't see\nhow someone who has something like that\nisn't in a place of mental\ninstability and danger to the people\naround them\nwell so let me\nuh\nso let me ask a couple questions so i\ni'm\ni'm not saying that mass shooters are\nnot mentally ill so i think that there's\na decent chance that many of them are\nbut i think that there's like more\nnuance to it so let me ask you this if\nwe're saying that that person is\nmentally ill right mental illness can be\ntreated right\nso if that person is treated\ndo you think that they can be\nlet back into society\nhow can you ever know if they're fully\ncured though\nthere'd be no way of ever knowing for\nsure if they actually like\nbecause this was a break with no history\nyou're 100 correct that you can't\npredict the future if you're a mental\nhealth professional\nyou can never know\nbut we do have standards of treatment\nright so we can sort of say that this\nthing is in remission it's in sustained\nremission for five years\nwe can't no we can't see the future we\ncan't ever know what's going to happen\nbut we have a lot of confidence that\npeople who are stable for this period of\ntime i have no idea about this\nparticular case and it just sounds\nreally bizarre i've worked with people\nwho are acutely psychotic and i've never\nheard of any anything like this ever\nhappening\nbut\num\nyou know i think if we're sort of saying\nthat people are ill then then it sort of\nstands generally speaking we believe\nthat people who are ill can be\ntreated and in sustained remission\nespecially if it's an acute psychotic i\nwould sort of think about something like\nsubstance use in a situation like that\nbecause usually substances when you see\njust really like normal people don't\njust\nstart murdering people because of an\nacute psycho i've like literally never\nheard of that the only\nsituations that i've heard of where that\nkind of behavior happens usually\ninvolves substances of abuse because\nthat's what precipitates\nsuch a\nbizarre\naggressive\npsychotic experience most people who\nhave acute psychotic experiences are\nthey're not dangerous like this is a\nvery common misconception that people\nwho are psychotic and people who have\nschizophrenia are like dangerous like\nmost of them are not like they don't\nschizophrenia when you really have it it\nhas\nit comes with so much disorganization so\npeople will say like oh you know like\nthese school shooters and stuff like\nmaybe they're schizophrenic i don't know\ni've never evaluated them but i've\nworked with a ton of people with\nschizophrenia and most of them even when\nthey're like acutely psychotic or not\nlike dangerous\nit's actually and part of what what\nbothers me about sort of\nassuming that this is mental illness is\nthat\ni think it really misrepresents mental\nillness\ni want to make it clear i'm not saying\nit's all mental illness i think the\nquestion was do you think they suffered\nfrom mental illness and my answer was\nyes i absolutely think there was a level\nto that yeah yeah i i didn't think that\nyou were blaming mental illness for that\nbut i appreciate your clarification\num\nbut it you know i think that it sort of\nstands to reason right that like\nsomething about the way that this person\nis\nviewing the world is like so divorced\nfrom what we would consider healthy\nbut that's where i i sort of the reason\ni brought up a suicide bomber is because\ni i think i've also observed\nthat there is a certain amount of\nindoctrination or conditioning\nthat\ni don't know would be like\na neurotransmitter\nmalfunction right so if we think about\nthings like\ndepression or major depressive disorder\nwe sort of know that there's like a\nbiological basis for it\nwhereas i don't know that the people who\nbecome suicide bombers have like a\nbiological basis for what happens to\nthem some of that appears to be actually\nlike more nurture than nature\nin terms of they're taught\nand begin to believe particular things\nthey're they're parts of echo chambers\nand they start to like you know behave\nparticular ways they have different sets\nof values\nany thoughts about that\nno i mean i think that makes sense i\njust think when it ultimately comes down\nto it the decision\nfor in the example of a suicide bomber\nto actually give your own life to\nsomething i think there has to be\nsome level of like\ni guess mental conditioning or\nsomething mentally that's gone wrong\nthat allows you to make that decision at\nthe very end because most people have\nsome level of self preservation sure i\nthink it's like a very normal thing and\nwhen that's not there you have to wonder\nwell why and how\nyeah i mean i think that's where so i\nthink if we're\ni would toss in conditioning into that\nthat's why i kind of think because i\ni've been struggling with this stuff a\nlot because\num\ni'm trying to understand like\nwhat we can do to alter the course so\nlike here here's the thing that i\nsometimes think about is that there are\na lot of like people who could be\nbudding\ninto school shooters\nright so the kid who is 18 got there\nsomehow\nwhether it's mental illness\nwhether it's indoctrination whether it's\nlike being a part of an echo chamber\nit's probably a combination of all of\nthe above\ni was also seeing recently that the\namerican psychological association\nrecommends a mental like a therapist to\nstudent ratio of about 500 students to\none therapist\nand the number is closer to i think the\nnumber right now is one thou i mean uh\ncloser to three thousand to one\nso we have a severe deficiency of mental\nhealth treatment and like i just wonder\nabout you know three years ago is there\nsomething that we could have done if\nsociety was different if our\ninterventions were different if our\nresources were different\nis there what could we have done to\nprevent this from happening so gun\ncontrol is a piece of it but like\nif we're sort of assuming that mental\nillness is a component\nhow do we fix that and that's something\ni've been thinking a lot about\nbut yeah i don't know what the answer to\nthat would be either but i had a\nquestion for you because i'm kind of\ncurious your perspective you mention\nindoctrination for things like this and\ni think that makes sense when it comes\nto like suicide bombing or like killing\nfor like a military cause or something\nbecause you can convince people that\nthey're doing it for a good cause how do\nyou indoctrinate someone to be like a\nmass shooter like a school shooter where\ndoes that indoctrination come from you\nthink oh i think it comes from the echo\nchamber i agree with you completely okay\nso so i think and you can even look at\nlike manifestos right where people think\nthat\nthey don't they think they're striking a\nblow for like goodness and justice\nthey even will cite other school\nshooters as like heroes\nthey're like you know this this world\nlike is uh so i personally think that it\nhas a lot to do with like resentment and\nhurt\nthat people are\nsort of driven to the fringes of society\nand they see no\nhope\nof any kind of like recovery or any kind\nof like reconciliation with the world\nand so they've lost at life already\nand some people who lose at life will\nsort of go down the route of suicide\nother people who have lost at life are\nlike i'm gonna burn it down with me\num\nyou know sometimes i think even in the\nmost deranged kind of thinking like\npeople think that they're doing someone\na favor\nbut i think that a lot of this stuff\nif you look at like where a lot of like\nhatred comes from i think hatred\nmost commonly stems from one of two\nplaces it either stems from conditioning\nwhere you're taught from a young age to\nhate someone else so if you look at like\nyou know anti-religious sentiment or\nlike racial sentiment or things like\nthat a lot of that is like culturally or\nnot it's conditioned so if you grow up\nin a household where people are are\nentire particularly religion or\nanti-particular race those are going to\nbe the values that you internalize\nthe second place is that oftentimes\nhatred comes from hurt i think that's\nlike\nin my opinion the number one case like\nwe we learn to hate\nthat which hurts us which is sort of\nwhat we're biologically designed to do\nand what really terrifies me about this\nstuff is when i think about mental\nillness so when i think about\nillness\nthe whole idea is it's like not the way\nthe body is supposed to function\nright so if we think about a heart\nattack like a heart attack is is is a\nmalfunction of the heart\nwhat actually terrifies me some about\nsome of this like emerging\ni think deranged behavior is maybe a\nbetter way to put it is that i'm not so\nsure that\nthis is a malfunction of the mind or the\nbrain\ni don't like i'm not sure you know i\nhaven't worked with these people\nextensively i've never talked to a\nschool shooter so i don't really know\ni'm sure that you could diagnose them\nwith something and i think that\ntreatment would in my mind would\nundoubtedly help them\nand at the same time i'm not so sure\nthat like\nbecause i don't know that indoctrination\nis the same as illness\ni think both will lead to deranged\nbehavior\num\nbut it you know it's something that like\ni think our our conceptions of mental\nillness\nare\nmaybe not sufficient or our conceptions\nof like behavior need to be more nuanced\nthan just mental illness\nokay i think all of that makes a lot of\nsense\nyeah i would be curious though if you\ndid have a conversation with one of the\nschool shooters what do you think you\nwould like\nlearn from them what like what would be\nlike the main things you'd want to learn\nfrom them like where would you steer\nthat kind of conversation oh as a\nprofessional what would i learn from\nthem what would you want to like to try\nand get out of them yeah so i might i'll\nstart first with a quantitative answer\ni'm sure the i would imagine the answer\nwould be a ton\nand and that's where like\nyou know i mean i would have the\nconversation in a way that i have it\nwith anyone else\nwhich is so we had a we had a interview\nseveral months ago with someone\nwho had a lot of labels that i think\nwere negative in nature so the person\nwas racist homophobic\nanti-semitic\nand and was sort of like you know\nlabeled as a is a trump supporter\nand some people were kind of upset\nbecause they were like you're giving\ntrump supporters a bad name but what i\nactually discovered by talking to the\nperson is that like there's a human\nbeing behind all of those labels who's\nlike actually an amazing person\nand and it was so interesting how we\njudge people based on those labels and\nlike one of the things that we try to do\nhere on stream is like really this has\nbeen my experience is that i've worked\nwith a lot of people you know i've\nworked in jails i've worked with\nhomeless populations things like that\nand there's like\nmost of the time it's like good humans\ni've worked with a couple people who are\nactually bad humans and even then\nsometimes some of them will say like\nwhen i work with with real sociopaths\nthey'll say like how do i be less of a\nbad human like i want to be a better\nhuman even though\nthere's a fundamental piece of me that's\nlike sociopathic\nbut in terms of kind of answering your\nquestion you know i would like to\nunderstand what motivates them\ni would like to understand\nhow they started to believe the things\nthat they believe\nyou know what were they trying to\naccomplish like\nlike i'd like to understand\nnot just\nthe fruit that\ncomes off of the tree\nbut\nwhere did that where did the leaves come\nfrom how did the tree grow what was the\nsapling and what was the seed\nbecause i think we until we understand\nthat like there's this concept in\nmedicine called primary prevention\nsecondary prevention and tertiary\nprevention\nso even when you're preventing a problem\nyou can prevent a problem from happening\na second time\nyou can prevent\nrisk factors\ndeveloping into a problem\nor you can prevent the risk factors\nhappening in the first place\nif that kind of makes sense\nso there are actually several layers of\nprevention and i think when it comes to\nschool shootings like we need to apply\nall three of those\nso is this and i think like some of the\nstuff could be super simple charlie like\nit could be as simple as like\ni don't know that these people are\ntaught how to communicate\nyou know like i think if someone sat sat\nthem down and like even just\nhelped them understand like this is how\nyou form healthy relationships because a\nlot of times like what we see and i sort\nof see this a lot with with some of the\ninsults and other people that we work\nwith\num\nbut\na lot of them\njust their whole conception of the world\nnever gets questioned and it's not that\nyou have to convince them otherwise it's\njust you need to ask them questions\nand the more that you ask them questions\nthe more\nlike you're not trying to trick them or\nanything like that like\nthe more you ask someone okay like help\nme understand why you believe what you\nbelieve\nlike the more that they have to build up\ntheir belief system from the ground up\nthe more it kind of falls apart if it's\nnot like based in reality does that make\nsense\nyeah i think i\nunderstand but i mean i i would love to\nunderstand you know what was your\nchildhood like like like this the\nresentment that bore this fruit today\nwhere was that resentment born\nand like what how did you nurture it how\ndid it grow like\nwhat was the fertilizer what was the\nwater\nyou know because i think that this is\nwhere i've talked to a lot of people who\nhave done\nbad things and\neven kids right so you'll get like kids\nwho like go to juvie and stuff right\nand the the challenge is that a lot of\ntimes people are looking to punish the\nkid\nbut very it's very hard to ask the\nquestion like if a kid is like smearing\npoop all over the walls and like you\nknow like assaulting other kids and\nthings like that like\nvery few people ask the question\nwhy is this kid doing this in the first\nplace\nlike what's going on with this kid\ndo you think if you had access to let's\nsay every\nkid in the world\nevery or every kid in the country and\nyou talk to each and every one of them\ndo you think you would be able to\nidentify like\nsomeone who is genuinely at risk to\nbecome the next school shooter like is\nthere certain things you would look for\nthat would like trigger alarms in your\nhead that's like wow this kid might\nactually be a threat okay what would\nthose factors look like well so a part\nof psychiatric training involves\nassessing so we all talk about like\nassessing for suicide right so like\npeople if you go see a therapist do\npeople will say like you know are you\nsuicidal and we're taught how to do\nformal risk assessments\nso a formal risk assessment is when you\nask a lot of questions about like you\nknow\nwhat's the like so how do we tell if\nsomeone's really suicidal if i post\nsomething on 4chan and i say i'mma kill\nmyself is that person actually suicidal\nyou know or or like you know you'll have\npeople who will sometimes use suicidal\nlanguage as expressions of frustration\nso you'll have people who say things\nlike\noh my god like this freaking if this\ntoilet gets clogged one more time i'm\ngonna blow my brains out so people will\nsay things like that right is that\nperson actually suicidal or are they\njust expressing frustration using like\ncolloquial language\nso we're taught ways that\num\nto assess whether suicidality is like\nhow significant it is now once again i\nmean these these assessments are not\ni mean they're far from perfect they're\nactually good studies that show that\neven trained mental health professionals\nare very bad at predicting suicide like\nwe just don't know because the short\nanswer is that you can ask as many\nquestions as you want to but no mental\nhealth trader can see the future\nright that being said there's something\nthat there's a part of our training\nwhich\num\nis less\npopular\nbut we're also trained to assess for\nhomicidal ideation\nso we're we're trained to assess whether\npeople are at risk to other people\nand that too when i say 100\nif i remember your question correctly\ncould i predict it 100 of the time no\nbut are there things that i could hear\nin those interviews that would make me\nconcerned that this person could be\nbecome a school shooter 100 yes\nyeah well there's there was never any\nchance of like being a hundred percent\non anything i was just wondering if they\nwere absolutely they're absolutely\nbecause that's it's as part of what we\ndo right so like and this is the kind of\nthing where it's sort of like\nyou know i would just ask simple\nquestions like\nyou know do you and it's not just about\nfantasies i i mean that's not really\nwhere i would go it's it's more like you\nknow like tell me about\nhow unjust the world is\nright and then let's like you know tell\nme about like you know why is the world\nlike so unjust like how does it\nwho who are the winners and who are the\nlosers\nwho like how is it determined like which\ncamp is and like who falls into which\ncamp and there are all kinds of features\nbecause i\nyou know we've worked with a lot of\nyou know people who i think could have\nended up in very bad places and i'm\nreally grateful for\neven the people in our community\nwho\nwill share some of these thoughts like\neven on our subreddit like there was\nactually just a post today which was\nexcellent about i have like in-cell-like\nthoughts can we like talk about it\nand it was a great post\nsomeone was like this is what i believe\nlike i'm trying to understand like\nis this real is this not real and like\nit's awesome that people are sort of\nlike talking about it's not an echo\nchamber right and the people's responses\nare not yeah what you believe is 100\ncorrect people are like well and it's\nreally great i mean even community\nmembers are like well how did you learn\nto believe this stuff like you know\nthat's not the way that i see it so it's\nthe opposite of an echo chamber\nbut i i would start with questions like\nyou know are there winners and losers\nhow is it determined whether winners are\nlosers and what kind of recourse would\nyou have if you were in the loser\nbracket\nor bucket\nlike you know what are your options\nand and that's where i think there are a\nlot of features which personally like\nwe've done a lot of research on this and\nas i mentioned earlier we advise some\ninstitutions about like how to make\nthese assessments or what to look out\nfor but\num you know there are certain things\nlike\nsort of like a deterministic\nmindset\nso the idea that and this is what i\nthink a big part of it is like once a\nhuman being believes that there is\nnothing they can do to alter their\nfuture\nthat's when i think\nextreme behavior happens\nwould that be like one of the main\nthings you'd look for is someone that's\ncompletely lost hope in their future 100\nokay right so like\nit's it's 100 that's what i would look\nfor\nand so then the question becomes you\nknow you talk to them about it and then\nyou're like okay so\nwhat are your options if you have no\nhope in the future\nand this is where a lot of people will\nturn towards suicide right because they\ndon't believe that things can ever get\nbetter\nand some people once they enter these\nkinds of echo chambers we'll sort of\nthink about like striking a blow for my\nbeleaguered group so other things that i\nwould assess for would be\na sense of like common identity that\num\noutweighs\nindividual identity\nso they're they're i think a lot of the\nworst human behavior\nhappens because people\nstop being individuals and they be part\nof a group so if you look at like nazis\nright it's like nazis were doing stuff\nfor the sake of the nazis and for some\nhigher order goal\nand i think actually most of the worst\nbehavior in human history is not due to\nnegative emotions it's actually due to\npositive emotions\nlike they think they're doing something\ngood for whatever they're aligned with\nyeah because if you think about it like\nlike the\nthe natural human tendency\nto commit\na harmful act like we're not harmful\ncreatures by nature at least i don't\nbelieve so you can argue against that\nbut i think if you just look at the\nmajority of humans like most humans are\nnot violent most humans don't kill\nanyone in their in their life most\nhumans don't assault anyone in their\nlife most most humans just aren't like\nthat\nwe tend to be and even in the animal\nkingdom which is brutal and violent most\nconflict is not lethal in in the animal\nkingdom between\nyou know like\nanimals of the same species so obviously\nif you're like a lion who's hunting a\ngazelle like that's gonna end in\nlethality but if you look at two males\nthat that fight the mortality rate from\nlike\nyou know alpha conflicts is not very\nhigh i think i don't really know\nstatistics but generally speaking people\nwill like joust right but like one of\nthem doesn't die\nand and so human beings are not\nintrinsically we're all capable of\nviolence sure\nbut most people are not out there being\nviolent so then the question becomes\nwhat does it take to overcome a human\nbeing's natural reluctance to be violent\nand that's where i think like\nthe greater good is is\na very strong motivator\nbecause i'm not doing this you know i\nhave to do this lesser evil for the sake\nof the greater good\nand i think that's where things like\nsuicide bombing comes from right it's\nit's for this like greater purpose it's\nlike this noble thing it's something\nthat we have to do\nwe have to we have to protect people\nlike the you know there's there's a lot\nof in school shooters there's a lot of\nlike an\nanarchist sort of thinking around it\nright like the everything needs to be\ntorn down\nfor the incels that were mass shooters\nwhich i understand now that mass shooter\nmanifestos are changing a little bit\nthey're like a little bit more\npolitically oriented\nwhereas 10 years ago they were very like\nkind of incel oriented\nwhere people felt like you know society\nwas unjust and and things like that\nhave you seen so have you read like most\nof them like manifestos like elliot\nroger the most recent shooter as well\nhave you read those manifestos not in\ntheir entirety\ni mean some of them are like curious\nlike 60 pages long right\noh yeah i think the buffalo one was 180\nor something crazy yeah like they're\nvery long i've i've i'm pretty sure i've\nread every scientific paper that\nanalyzes the manifestos and i read parts\nof the manifestos myself\nokay yeah that makes sense then okay and\ni mean there aren't that many\ni mean there are many but they're not\nthat many scientific papers analyzing\ntheir language\nhow do you think that is why do you\nthink there isn't a ton of stuff\nanalyzing the language i remember with\nelliot rogers manifest though it almost\nbecame like a joke with a lot of the\n[ __ ] that was in it because of the way\nhe talked\nand i feel like a lot of people don't\nknow about the manifestos they know they\nexist but they never actually read them\nis it just because of the length and\nit's a big barrier to entry or\nthat's probably a part of it i think\nthat um there are a couple of other\nissues the first is that\ni don't know\nthis i'm saying i don't know\nisn't this not my area of expertise\num\ni don't know how much can be gained out\nof a written thing as opposed to a\nconversation\nso if you look at the way that\npsychologists are trained\nwe're not trained based on evaluating\nwritten material\nright like we're not\nanalysts of written material we're\nanalysts of like\nmental function and like generally\nspeaking we use conversation\nas our best instrument to understand the\ninner workings of the mind\nso when someone writes something\nlike people can do thematic analyses and\nsymbolism and all this kind of crap\nright like you can do that sort of stuff\nbut i just don't know how\nwhat the correlation is between an\nanalysis\nand something clinical\nbecause what we assess for so for\nexample like when when we assess for\nschizophrenia\nit's not the con you can talk about the\ncontent of delusions but if you actually\nlike look at the criteria\nfor the diagnosis of something like\nschizophrenia\nthe fact that they have delusions is\npart of the criteria but not\nthe content of the delusions it's a\nbunch of other stuff so people who have\npsychotic disorders will have\ndisorganized thinking and disorganized\nspeech\nso they'll be like disheveled\nthey'll also we look at all these other\nkinds of things like even if you kind of\nwalk down the street you know we have\nthis instinctive way of sometimes we'll\nsee homeless people and we'll be like\nthat homeless person like i'm gonna like\nstay away from them you'll have this\ninstinctive\nkind of revulsion towards particular\npeople\nand that's because your your brain is\nactually like looking at a lot of stuff\nlike facial expressions eye contact\nso even if i like look at your eyes you\nhave a fluctuating like your eyes move\naround right\nand and my eyes move around and i have\nfluctuations in my facial expression\nthere are all these kinds of things that\nwe look at which if we stop doing those\nthings if i start talking to you like\nthis and i adopt a monotone and i don't\nchange where i'm looking\nright and what hap like what are you\nfeeling right now\nuncomfortable exactly like that right\nand you even know i'm i'm faking it you\nknow i'm faking it it's just it's just\nan uncomfortable thing yeah right so\nthese are the kinds of things that we're\nactually trained towards and and that's\nwhere like\nyou can't get that from a manifesto yeah\nyeah i think that's a really good answer\nto it then do you think there's any\nvalue at all in reading through the the\nmanifestos because i remember with the\nuni bomber a lot of people read his\nmanifesto in fact i think his manifesto\nhas like its own wikipedia page at this\npoint it was like a pretty well studied\nthing but not anymore now they don't\nlook at these kind of people's\nmanifestos uh\ndo i think there's any value yes but i\ndon't think that\nso here's the thing i think what causes\nthe behavior is the process of\nradicalization\nit's not the radical beliefs that you\nhold\nso\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i think that makes sense so i mean\nlike this is where like you can have\nyou know so if like one person writes a\nmanifesto about being a school shooter\nif one person writes a manifesto where\nthey're they're gonna you know\n9 11 and like\nyou know if when osama bin laden made\nhis like statements about why he did\nwhat he did you can analyze all of those\nthings\nbut i think that what you're going to\nsee is that the the content of the\ni'm just going to call it delusional i\ncan't make that clinical assessment i'm\nsort of using it colloquially but\nthe content of what they believed\nis not\nwhat i don't know how to say like you\ncan like even if the what they believed\nis wrong you can try arguing with them\nor giving them evidence they're not\ngoing to listen to you\ndoes that make sense yeah once they\nbelieve it like you know the q and on\npeople you can tell them hey by the way\nwe can't revive people from the dead\ni don't know if you knew that\nand the q anon people are like they're\nnot going to care about that right\ntrue well i mean you never know with\nnecromancy i mean anything is possible\ni mean well necromancy is\nyeah you know i don't know if that's a\nreal thing but you know\nthere's an entire community of\nnecromancers that might disagree with\nyou\nmy point exactly so so like you know\nyou're gonna i don't know that that\nreally countering their belief system is\nactually an effective\nway of communication this is actually\nwhat really pisses me off about\npolitical discussion\nis that like i was watching this clip of\na reporter asking a particular\npolitician about\nyou know why this keeps happening and\nlike the questions were an attack\nand you know there was there was no\nthere was no actual like\nquestions have stopped being\nso normally like when i think of a\nquestion it's weird because i actually\nhave to formally teach this\nso i'll even like teach people like\nwhat's the purpose of a question like\ncharlie what's the purpose of a question\nget an answer\nuh so i would disagree\ni would say i think that you are correct\nunfortunately you are correct\nso so that that's where i think that's\nwhy most people ask questions to get an\nanswer\nand in particular oftentimes they're\nlooking for a particular answer right\nor they're setting up the question in a\nway that the answer like it's like a\nloaded question you know\nyeah i mean that's kind of the nature of\nuh debates now i think debates are\nentirely pointless online uh you're\nnever going to change anyone's belief i\ncompletely agree so that's why like when\ni so this is why what i have to teach\npeople and i have to like recalibrate\nand i'm like the re the reason you ask a\nquestion is to learn\nlike a question like if i know the\nanswer\nwhy am i asking a question\nif you have an opinion just state the\nopinion don't\npretend it's a question\nand if you have if you actually want to\nlearn something ask a question\nand you'll be like amazed at how much\nthis helps like interpersonal\nrelationships so i had to learn this in\nterms of my own marriage\nbut also in terms of couples counseling\nand even like in esports teams so you'll\nhave people who are like socratic\nteachers in esports teams and i try to\nknock this behavior out of people where\nit's like i'm gonna ask you questions to\nconvince you of my point\nand that's where like even even debates\ni agree with you are useless because\nthe presumption is that like one party\nis right and one party is wrong\nwhereas like i think what we need to\nhave instead of debates is like how\nabout we actually have a conversation\nbetween two people who disagree and we\ntry to come to some kind of accord\nit's not about convincing the other\nperson that you're right and they're\nwrong it's about like\nyou believe this you're not a dumbass i\nbelieve this i'm not a dumbass how about\nwe like get together and try to figure\nout okay like\nhow can we like have these different\nsets of beliefs and instead of assuming\nthat the other person is an idiot\nand convincing them that they're an\nidiot how about we like get together and\ntry to figure out like how we can both\nwork together or how we can reconcile\nthese views\nyeah i think that sounds pretty ideal i\nthink one thing that really contributes\nand inhibits the ability to like have a\nconversation is that people have this\ndesperate need to surround themselves\nwith people that believe everything they\ndo so if there's a disagreement it's\nlike a personal thing that someone\nbelieves something that they don't\ni think that's why a lot of these\nconversations are steered towards me\ntrying to get like a gotcha moment to\ntry and convince you that i'm right and\nyou're wrong because it's part of like\nmy team\nyeah so so and and that's where um give\nme just one second charlie\nsorry about that\noh good um\nso this i i completely agree with you\nbecause i think what's happened it's\nlike it's become ego\nright it's like i i can't afford to be\nwrong\nand this is where i think that like\nhonestly i i don't like i mean i'm gonna\nget political for a second but\nwhen i look at these like political\ninteractions around gun control\nthe way that these questions are being\nasked about gun control is like\nyou will never get a conservative to\nadmit that gun control is a problem now\nbecause if you get them if you force\nthem to say that\nthat means that they're gonna be\nresponsible for what happened like kids\ndying\nyou're not you have to give them an out\ndoes that make sense\nyeah i see what you said you can't say\nlike they're the way that these\nquestions are being asked you're forcing\nthem to double down on on their\nbeliefs\nthere's no like and this is why like i\nsee this all the time in terms of you\nknow like couples counseling with\naddictions\nwhere when someone screws up telling\nthem i told you so and forcing them to\nsay\ni you know\nyeah i really screwed up on such a\ncatastrophic level and we've been\nscrewing up on a catastrophic level for\nyears and years and years and years and\nyears\nlike it's gonna get the opposite result\nyou're not no one's ever gonna budge\nbecause the only like if you if you try\nto trap them in a corner by saying that\nlike\nthat that comes with accepting\nresponsibility for what happened i don't\nknow if people are willing to do that\nfrom an ego standpoint\nand i do think that they're also\nand i do think it's not a black and\nwhite issue i mean i'm in favor of gun\ncontrol but like this is the kind of\nthing where there's like more to it than\nthat right there are mental health\nissues\nthere are all kinds of other like\nradicalization issues like it's not you\nknow there's a lot going on here\nbut the fact that everything gets so\ndamn polarized is like the only way like\nit becomes a contest and the problem\nwith the contest is that there's a\nwinner and there's a loser\nand there's no like cooperation like\nthere's no collaboration there's no like\nthere's just accusation after accusation\nand it's in a sense like i understand it\nbecause i think that those accusations\nare warranted\nin a lot of cases\nbut i don't think it's an effective way\nlike it certainly doesn't work in\ncouples counseling\nwhen people [ __ ] up like\nyou know\ncalling them out on it over and over and\nover and over and over again is not how\nyou patch things up\ni think that makes sense i mean\ni\nso i've always said arguing on twitter\nor youtube comments is the biggest waste\nof time in the world and i think it just\nties into the point of no one's ever\nactually going to budge on a belief i\nthink we're at a point where no one ever\nwants to say like i was wrong about\nsomething or\nno matter what you challenge them on or\nwhat you present it's just falling on\ndeaf ears even if it's like an\nobjectively wrong stance it's something\nthey choose to believe in and will\ndisregard everything else like flat\nearth\nit's just when you're arguing i just\nfind you to be wasting everyone's time\nespecially your own if you're trying to\nhave a conversation i think there's\nmerit to that like if you're just\nactively talking to a flat earther and\njust listening to them and maybe asking\nquestions i think you can maybe gain\nsomething from that whether it's\nproductive or not that's up for argument\nbut at the very least it's better than\ntrying to have a legitimate argument\nwith someone because no one ever is\ngoing to budge on something they've\nchosen to believe in even if it's wrong\nyeah i mean i completely agree i don't\nknow where\nso the i think com for me it comes down\nto learning right so like it's not about\nwho's right and who's wrong it's about\nlearning\nand anytime you engage in an argument\nthe mind is not\nin a frame it's not primed to learn it's\nprimed to convince and then you have two\npeople who are trying to convince each\nother\nand like sometimes people do learn from\narguments i i don't think that you can't\nlearn anything but generally speaking\nit's almost like when we work with like\nparents and kids who are addicted to\nvideo games\nit becomes like a pissing contest where\nthe parent is trying to get the kid to\nunderstand and the kid is trying to get\nthe parent to understand\nand when you're trying to get someone to\nunderstand like it's not going to work\nwell\ninstead what you should really do is try\nto understand their perspective\nlike when when we try to understand the\nperson who disagrees with us instead of\ntrying to convince the person who\ndisagrees with us because if someone\ndisagrees with us like they've got to\nhave a reason for believing it right\nbecause there's something out there\nlike in and this is where the other\nthing that happens is we tend to just\ninsult the intelligence of people who\ndisagree with us\nand no nowhere is that easier than with\nflat earthers we're like how could\nsomeone be so stupid\nwhereas i don't believe that\nif you test a hundred flat earthers\ntheir iq is going to be lower than\naverage i really don't believe that i\ndon't think it's about intelligence\nbut we assume what we tend to do is we\nmake like personal attacks or we insult\nsomeone's intelligence we call them you\nknow subhuman or stupid or idiots or\nlike how could someone be so stupid and\nwe also elevate our own iq right like\ni'm i have an iq of 160\nas tested by this internet iq test\nand like once that no one's trying to\nit's just not going to get you anywhere\nit's just waste of everyone's time\ni think what really what politicians\nneed to do is try to understand like\nwhy they believe what they believe\ni think that just goes for everyone i\nthink just instead of trying to keep\ndunking just having a conversation is\nmore beneficial and you waste less time\ni mean i think so that's why we we do\nwhat we do you know we will take\nit\nsome of my favorite streams have been\nwith people who are like\nevil\nbut it turns out that they're not evil\nlike we've had people on stream who like\nthe internet doesn't like\nbut i think it's just you know there's\nit's so easy to judge especially on\ntwitter like all twitter is capable of\nis judgment and that's the really\ndevastating thing is if you look at\nengagement online\nthe more righteous fury the more\npitchforks you can get out the more\nviews you're gonna get\nwho would you say is your most\ncontroversial guest you've had on here\num so\ni am not sure\ni'm comfortable answering that question\noh because i i see sorry i don't know\nthat that's sorry i'm totally i was just\nthinking through it for a second i i\nmean i think that i don't know that\npeople would have a problem if i answer\nthat question but a rule of thumb that i\ntry to follow is that i don't talk about\nabout someone even if they've been on\nstream\ni break that rule so for example i've\ntalked about how much i appreciate your\nopinion on particular things and if\nthere's something going on you know\nsometimes i'll mention like\ngeneral stuff but generally speaking i\ntry my best not to\nreflect on conversations or at least\nname people i'm sure some people can put\nthings together but it's just a\nyou know okay yeah no that makes sense\nnow yeah sorry no it's fine i i i don't\ni'm i don't mind that you asked the\nquestion i was just thinking a little\nbit about how i felt about answering\nthat\nso no worries\nand actually you know i don't even know\nthe other thing i'd sort of say is who's\nthe most controversial guest i think\nyou'd probably have to ask\nbecause i actually don't know about a\nlot of what goes on\nyou know i i'm not really familiar with\nsome of the twitch drama and things like\nthat\nbut\ni i think the other thing that that i'm\nkind of concerned about just in relation\nto that if i can just kind of\ngo on a quick tangent\nso one of the things that i really\nstruggle with maybe you can help me with\nthis\nis\nexploring issues with people like trying\nto have these open conversations and at\nthe same time\nnot platforming someone who has\nviews that upset a lot of people\noh i see yeah that's a tough balancing\nact i i think no matter what you do when\nyou talk to someone who has views that\nare\nuh\nwe'll say spicy\nthere's always going to be people that\nthink that you are doing more harm than\ngood by giving them a voice in front of\npeople i don't really think there's any\nway of convincing everyone that what\nyou're doing is to try and understand or\ntry and like talk about or challenge\nthese things you're always going to be\nviewed by at least some people as\nplatforming and thus giving a voice to\nsomeone that could potentially convince\nsomeone else of bad stuff there's really\nnot much you can do there at least maybe\nthere is and i've just never seen it yet\nbut\nfrom the nature of everything i've seen\nonline people are always just going to\nhave that belief\nso charlie i\nyou know i'd appreciate it if you ever\nfigure that out let me know because\ni would like to talk to people who\nso we we like to talk to people who just\nhave like different perspectives on\nthings and and i i think especially with\nsome of these like you know labels that\nwe sort of really dislike i'm not saying\nthat those to be homophobic is good or\nanything like that but i i think that\nwhat what i really try to do is just\nhelp people or what i believe i guess is\nthat like there's like good humans at\nthe bottom of everyone for the most part\neven the people who have antisocial\npersonality disorder like and are\nsociopaths like i've worked with a lot\nof them and they're like good in a weird\nway good people like they don't have\nthat internal moral compass\nbut almost as a result like the morality\nthe the code that they choose to live\ntheir life by is like\ndeveloped\nthrough more effort\nwhereas it's like kind of like\ninstinctive for us\num but i mean i think there's a lot of\nstuff out there that i i don't know how\nwe're going to solve some of these\nproblems unless we like really try to\nunderstand what some of these people\nbelieve\nyeah i think that makes sense i do have\na quick question kind of on the back of\nthat\nand you mentioned this earlier you have\ntalked to people that are labeled as\nracist or homophobic or something like\nthat but you said like you know at the\nbottom of it there's a good person there\nis that like in spite of being\nholding racist and homophobic beliefs\nthey can still be a good person or\ni'm just trying to like understand\nexactly yeah so let's uh and i'm gonna\nhave to get going in about 10 minutes if\nthat's cool with you\ntotally fine yeah um so\nwhat is a belief\nuh i guess it would be a set of values\nthat someone\nuh lives their life by something that\nthey will always\nuh hold in their heart that's what i\nwould consider a belief okay i will\nalways believe\nsanta claus is real until proven\notherwise i don't think it's a strong\nbelief but even still it's something\nthat i think a person will always or a\nperson guides their life by yeah so i i\nthink i would i would i'm\nreally happy with your answer and i\nthink i would dispute parts of it\nbecause i think it touches on a lot of\nnuance the first is always\nso i don't think by nature of the\ndefinition a belief is not always\nright so like i can believe that my keys\nare in my pocket\nor i can believe in god\nand if i am a die-hard religious person\nthat belief may not persist for the rest\nof my life now we oftentimes think that\nway right because that's how it is for\nmost people so i think your answer is\nlike a good one but if you really tunnel\ndown into it it's possible for people to\nfind god\nif they were born an atheist and it's\npossible for them to become an atheist\nif they were born religious so the\nnature first thing to understand is the\nnature of beliefs is that they're\nactually changeable that's what makes\nthem beliefs\nwhat isn't a belief is knowledge\nso a belief is something that actually\nwe don't know that's how i'd sort of\ndefine a belief\nor a different perspective but i think\nthe the definition you offered i think\nis a much more practical one\nbut then so i think just beliefs are\njust like constructions in the mind and\nthey're actually a little bit divorced\nfrom reality by their nature because\nthat's the difference between belief and\nknowledge so\nknowledge is something that i can be\nsecure in a belief is something that i'm\nactually don't know\nright so people will ask do you believe\nin the afterlife\nno one's saying\ni'm sure that an afterlife exists the\nbest you can get is belief that's\nbecause we have no data from the\nafterlife that also is a little bit\ndisputable but anyway\num conversation for a different day\nthere's one psychiatrist out of\nuniversity of virginia who actually does\nuh has done a lot of interesting\nresearch on reincarnation and past lives\nand stuff like that's really fascinating\nso he's published a lot of like\nscientific papers about it\num so\nand that's where so i think what i've\nsort of learned is that a lot of times\nbelieves so what i think makes a good\nperson is their actions\nand i think what makes a lot of our\nbeliefs is our\nsensory exposures\nso if i grow up in a homophobic\nhousehold i'm gonna be homophobic\nif i grow up in a particular political\noriented household i'm probably gonna\nlike follow those political beliefs\nso that's where i think we hold people\nlike\naccountable or even blame them for their\nbeliefs but if someone is sort of like\nyou know homophobic i oftentimes find\nthat that's a problem of ignorance as\nopposed to anything else\nand i think there's a there's a guy i\nforget his name he he gave a really good\nted talk he's like a black dude who\nspent some time like with white\nsupremacists or kkk members\nand just like got to know them\nand even when i sort of deal with like a\nlot of racism i think a lot of racism\nfor example is born of ignorance like a\nlot of like homophobia is like born of\nignorance it's just you've never spent\ntime like you know if you hang out with\npeople who are of a different race and\nyou have particular beliefs over time\nyou'll just naturally discover that\nthese people are like normal\nor that gay people are normal\nlesbians like most people are just\nhumans and it's sort of like an\nignorance of that basic humanity that i\nthink results in a lot of that stuff\nand so in my experience people who hold\nbad beliefs\nsometimes they're sort of chosen or\npeople kind of give in to them but i i'd\nlike to say that you know upwards of 50\nof them it's like really due to\nignorance\nthen in those people uh\nif it was due to ignorance do you like\nuh try and steer them towards maybe\nchanging those beliefs or do you still\nconsider them good people even with\nthose beliefs if they continue them or\nwhere does what does that look like i\nusually try not to steer people\nso that's because you know how do i know\nthat i'm not the ignorant one\nright\nmaybe maybe all the homophobes are right\nmaybe one race is worse than like who\nknows like you know i don't believe that\ni'm pretty confident in that by the way\nbut generally speaking my experience has\nbeen that you don't need to steer people\nif they have incorrect\nbeliefs all you have to do is ask them\nto explain\nright so and that's where like so you\nknow\nyou know so i was talking to someone a\ncouple months ago about\ncovid and they're like yeah the reason i\ndidn't get covet is because i have a\nstrong mind and the reason that people\nare dying of covid is because they have\nweak minds\nyou know and and that's where it's like\ni don't really believe that at all\nbut so then i ask him to explain it\nbecause who knows\nand then what i tend to find is that if\nyou ask um\nif you ask\nyou know like a flat earther to explain\nthings and like really explain them what\nyou'll find is that they're like\nexplanations are like inconsistent\nthey're internally inconsistent\nand that if someone you know really has\na very solid like understanding of\nthings the they should be able to\nexplain it well\nand that oftentimes the more that you\nask questions and seek to learn like if\npeople have incorrect beliefs so this is\nwhat we do sort of in\nthere's a technique called motivational\ninterviewing that we do in addiction\npsychiatry where oftentimes people are\nin denial that the substance is a\nproblem right oh it's not like it's not\nthe alcohol that's a problem\nit's that cops are racist and every time\ni drive while a drunk and i get a dui\nit's like a consequence of racism\nyou know like they'll cite all kinds of\ndifferent things\nand so you just ask them questions and\nthe more that someone is in denial like\nthe right move is asking open-ended\nquestions and what we've learned from\nnumerous scientific studies on denial\naround alcoholism is just asking people\nopen-ended non-judgmental questions\nactually gets them to like recognize\nthat they have a problem it's kind of\nbizarre\nright oh yeah so i see what you're\nsaying so alcohol is like not the\nproblem at all like there are bigger\nproblems in your life so it must be you\nknow alcohol doesn't cause any problems\nwhatsoever\nthen well like sometimes i'm hungover\nbut yeah but what's the problem with\nbeing hungover like what's the big deal\nwith that you know\nlike who cares about being a hungover\nit's like it's not alcohol that's called\ncausing the hangover\nand the person is like wait no no\nalcohol is causing the hangover yeah but\nyou like hangovers\nno i mean who the hell likes a hangover\nwait i'm confused you said that alcohol\ndoesn't cause any problems and you don't\nlike hangovers does that mean that you\ndon't like being hungover no i don't\nlike being hungover\noh so like\nwhat can you do about that well i could\ndrink a little bit less dumb ass oh i\nsee so maybe you should drink a little\nbit less yeah\nand then you kind of like\nuno reverse them into recognizing that\nthey have a problem a little inception\nplay it's it's called motivational\ninterviewing so and that's where this\nit's just asking people you know\nquestions\ni don't know if that makes sense but\nyeah so i i try not to steer them\nusually\nbut\nyou let them arrive at their own\nconclusions because that's i think how\npeople are going to change right it's\nthe very opposite of a debate it's not\nmy place to convince you\nbut like i'm happy to learn about your\nbeliefs and usually what tends to happen\nis when you create that kind of\natmosphere where someone doesn't have to\ndefend against your attacks\nthen\nlike they're gonna be more open-minded\nand then if i have an opinion i'll share\nit with them\nat some point i'll say\nhey like i really think you should\nconsider cutting back on the alcohol or\neven maybe taking a break from it here\nare the reasons why\nnumber one you won't be hungover anymore\nnumber two it sounds like if you get one\nmore dui you're gonna lose your license\nand it sounds like you've got an awesome\ncareer but you need to be able to drive\nand number three is it sounds like two\npeople have now broken up with you\nbecause of your drinking\nand they may not have i'm not saying\nthey're the right people for you i'm not\nsaying that like you know you're never\ngoing to be happy in a relationship\nunless you stop drinking but here are\nthe three things that i've heard from\nyou\nwhat do you think about that\nand then it just lets them go to the a\nbetter conclusion yeah or just gets it's\nnot really even about the conclusion\ncharlie it's about getting them to\nquestion right so i'm genuinely asking\nwhat do you think about that like i've\nstayed in my beliefs at that point\nand i'm like this is what i think man\nlike you tell me like what do you think\nand they're like well like you know i\nthink there's a part of it that's fair\nand a part of it that isn't\nand it's like okay cool like what's fair\nabout it and what is it\nand so you kind of just\nkeep talking to them and conversation\nthen i think most humans will come to\nthe quote unquote right conclusions\nyeah that's interesting i've never heard\nof that before yeah\ncool man\nawesome um i've got to actually do we\nactually have a sponsored stream and and\nthere's uh a company that's been kind\nenough to offer coaching to our\ncommunity so i got to bounce over to\nthat\nbut i just wanted to thank you for\ncoming on today yeah no thank you for\nhaving me on man\num i i really appreciated the\nconversation i like talking to you a lot\nso\noh likewise i always appreciate it\num yes people are wondering if it's if\nit's steak yeah we have a we have no\nit's not steak\nyeah that would be such a big power play\nif it was though we spent the whole\nfirst minute just talking about steak\nand kind of [ __ ]\nno yeah um but any kind of closing\nthoughts from your end before we wrap up\num not really talking about like uh some\nreally depressing stuff is usually not\nsomething i do but talking to a\nprofessional like you about it's always\nkind of interesting and eye-opening so i\njust always appreciate the conversation\nlikewise and and um as a professional i\ni think that you know we learn a lot and\nwe do have a lot of expertise but\ni'm convinced that\nyou know like\nthat\nthe best answers or a lot of the the\nsolutions to this problem are not\nnecessarily going to come from\nprofessionals\nso even if you look at things like\nalcoholics anonymous which has helped\nyou know way more people become sober i\nthink than therapists have\nby statistically so i think that part of\nwhat i really appreciate is just you\nknow if you have ideas or other people\nin the community have ideas that people\nare listening and have ideas like\nthat could help\num yeah so appreciate it man\nthank you\nadios\nhey bye everyone\nyou"
