    "transcript": "so if i'm hearing your situation\ncorrectly you're\na very good friend to have you're very\nemotionally supportive you're kind of\nlike the therapist's friend\nand in the past you've had trouble\nsetting limits on that so i asked you do\nyou want to support people and you were\nlike yes absolutely and so oddly enough\ni wonder if the problem is that like\nyou're not actually able to do something\nthat you find\nfulfilling which is like supporting your\nfriends\nif the primary source of your emotional\ndrain is being a therapist for your\nfriends if you stop being a therapist\nfor your friends it should follow that\nyou no longer feel drained but you've\nstopped being a therapist for your\nfriends for about six months right and\nyou still feel emotionally drained that\ndoesn't make sense to me i feel like\nthere's something here that's missing\nhello\nwelcome\nhi nice to meet you nice to meet you too\ni'm sedona\nnice to meet you sedona what what's your\nsituation how can we help\nawesome so\ni my question was about how to rebuild\nand gain like emotional mana again after\nlosing it\nso like i'm like a pretty empathetic\nperson and i've been like the therapist\nfriend for like a lot of my relations\ngrowing up and\nespecially online and uh\ni had like past boundary issues well not\nknowing how to say no and being burnt\nout because of school and toxic\nsituations whatever and so\ni found recently\ni\nhaven't had that emotional manner to\nhave like deep conversations or be there\nto support others and\neven having the energy to like watch\nyour videos and whatnot has been\ndifficult\nso i was wondering if you had any advice\non like how to\ngain\nthat back again\nyeah so i heard you say something about\nboundary issues can you help me\nunderstand that a little bit\nyeah so i\nhad trouble like separating\nmyself from the other person like i\nwould always like put them ahead of\nmyself\nand\ni\nwouldn't know how to stay known and how\nthat separation between like their\ninterests and my interests and\num\nyeah maintaining my own in the\nrelationship\nso so you you can't just adapt to what\nthey wanted and so you use the past\ntense\nso is that not an issue now like have\nyou learned how to set boundaries around\nthat\nso it's like a work in progress but i\nfeel like i've made a lot of progress if\nthat makes sense yeah absolutely so and\nyou still feel kind of emotionally\ndrained\nyes and how long have you been\nemotionally drained\num probably like\nmonths\nlike probably since like january or\nfebruary to be honest and and how long\nhave you\nput limits on the amount of emotional\nsupport that you put on other people i\nmean that you give to other people\num\nsince last\nnovember\ni think\nso let me just get this timeline\nstraight so you're\njust also give a summary for groothie\nand if i missed something please let me\nknow sedona so if i'm hearing your\nsituation correctly you're\na very good friend to have you're very\nemotionally supportive you're kind of\nlike the therapist friend\nand in the past you've had trouble\nsetting limits on that and found that\nkind of work\nat work friendship\nvery emotionally draining\nand so it's a work in progress you're\nlearning how to better set limits with\npeople in terms of your own bandwidth\nand kind of putting them ahead of you\nbut what i'm sort of hearing is that\nit's been about six months since you've\nstopped being\nkind of like a battery for other people\nand charging people at your own expense\num but you're still feeling emotionally\ndrained\nso yeah i i could also be like i'm also\nin i just finished my school i have like\n14 classes a week so i was probably very\nburnt out from that as well\nbut\nit's uh\nyeah i am feeling emotionally drained i\nwas feeling better for a while but then\nuh\ni don't know i haven't had the mana\ni have a question do you normally um\ngive more than you receive in\nrelationships\nyeah\nwell like\nbefore yes\nnow i feel like i've been doing a bit\nmore receiving\nuh\nwhich is nice\nbut\noverall course of life yes yes okay so\nrecently\nso it's not just that you're giving less\nit's that you're receiving more\nyeah\nrecently yes\nand how is that helping\num i feel bad\nto be honest\ni feel like i'm not pulling my weight\nyeah\ni i can i didn't mean to lie because\nlike i can see how\nif when you receive emotional support\nif that makes you feel guilty for not\npulling your weight\ni can see how that's not really gonna\ncharge your battery\nno\nright does that make sense\nyeah\nare you an extrovert\nyes yeah i am\nyou have thoughts\nwell i have kind of more questions like\nwhen you\nhang out with your friends like do you\nall have fun or is it more like\ntalking and dinner like sorry\nnot that talking and dinner isn't fun\nbut like do you guys go out and do stuff\nor do you guys kind of\nmore talk and process and stuff\num with my online relationships it used\nto be a lot more talking processing but\nlike\nas of recently and i've cut out some not\ngreat people it's been more like doing\nthings and having fun and and whatnot\nwhich has been awesome and in person as\nwell\nto answer the question\nand how does that\ndoes that help you kind of recharge or\nare you still emotionally exhausted like\nafter that kind of stuff i feel like i\nam like recharged but i still feel\nemotionally exhausted for like the\ndeeper conversations\noh yeah i i don't yeah\nyou feel uh\nfrom the deeper from the deeper\nconversations\nto have the deeper conversations like i\ni feel like distracted in them i feel\nlike i'm not there a hundred percent\ndo you want to have deeper conversations\nyeah i love like being there for other\npeople like it brings me so much joy\num and i want to have that again\nbut it just feels like tiring and\nlike i am unable to be present\nwhat do you think\ni think she's tired i think you're tired\nbut i don't think it's like it sounds\nlike your social life is going in a\nfairly\ngood like it's going in the direction\nthat you choose and it sounds like if\nyou\nwant your friendships to be um going out\nyou can have that if you want to have\nthe deeper conversations you can have\nthat\nif you want to give more you can if you\nwant to give less you can't so it sounds\nlike you're kind of\nit sounds\nit sounds like something else is\nhappening that this isn't about your\nfriendships it sounds like you're just\nkind of\ntired\nyeah so\ni would sort of echo that because\nhere's here's how i'm thinking about it\nsedona and you let me know if this kind\nof fits or not so like\nif the primary source of your emotional\ndrain is being a therapist for your\nfriends\nif you stop being a therapist for your\nfriends it should follow that you no\nlonger feel drained\nright\nyeah\nbut you've stopped being a therapist for\nyour friends for about six months right\nand you still feel emotionally drained\nyeah so\nthat doesn't make sense to me\ni feel like there's something here\nthat's missing\nand it could just be more time like\nmaybe you need another six months\num\nbut generally speaking i'd like you know\ni think that six months after a draining\ninfluence is gone you should be like\nkind of on the road to recovery there\nso a couple of other possibilities could\nbe that there's like other weird stuff\ngoing on like you you're carrying around\nthis guilt\nother stuff could be like do you feel\nresentful towards your friends and\nyou're sort of carrying that around\nno\nokay\nthe other thing that could be kind of\nbizarre is that\nso people who are\nemotionally supportive to others\nthat can actually be like so so i asked\nyou do you want to support people and\nyou were like yes absolutely\ni love it so much\nand so oddly enough i wonder if the\nproblem is that like you're not actually\nable to do something that you find\nfulfilling which is like supporting your\nfriends\nand this is where like if you think\nabout sort of the life of a therapist\nyou know we find our work invigorating\nbecause we find it genuinely rewarding\nand we also find it draining\nso in a weird way what could be going on\nis that that the way that you recharge\nit is also by like helping people\nyeah\nwhich is which is bizarre\nbut that's another possibility there's\njust something about this the scenario\nthat you're describing where i feel like\nthere's a blind spot somewhere\nokay\nalso sometimes one person takes all of\nour like\nlike 90 of our energy is from like one\nor two people\ndo you have like\nenergy vampires in your life\ni would say so yes well i i had even\nworse ones but i got rid of them uh\nwhich sounds bad to say but\ni did\nand\ni do have some in my family as well um\nyeah yeah so so i think that's where so\ni know it's gonna sound kind of weird\nbut what i would say is\neven if you're not fully there\ntry helping one person one time\nand see what happens to your battery\nlike what you need i think is more\ninformation\nbecause something about this is\nand then the other thing is is i mean if\nyou've got energy vampires in your\nfamily that you can't escape from that's\nwhy your battery's drained\nyeah\nyeah so\ni'm hearing that you're moving in the\nright direction but that you may still\nhave a way to go\ni think that's an accurate description\nyes\nin which case i'd say just keep on\nmoving in my condolences that you have\nyou know you've had to walk so far so\nalready\nif you enjoy um\nmaybe one kind of no strings attached\nway of like being able to have those\nconversations and\nnot have any additional baggage would be\nto like volunteer or like\nconsider coaching or something like that\nwhere\nmaybe you can help other people engage\nin those conversations but not have\nan added burden and then your\ngeneral relationships can\nbe more reciprocal\nright\nyou don't get into like those kind of\nbad patterns of like giving more\nreceiving more\nokay here i'm writing it down one second\nso i don't forget\nthe last thing that i would mention is\nthat if this persists for a few more\nmonths\nand gets worse and you find that\nyour battery being drained and you being\nout of mana\nis\nlike really starting to cause problems\nin your life i'd highly recommend that\nyou get like a medical evaluation or\nlike an evaluation by a psychologist too\nso sometimes\none of the key hallmarks of something\nlike major depressive disorder is that\nit's triggered by\na particular circumstance\nbut\nyeah persists\nindependent of the circumstance being\nresolved\nright so that's just where if you're\nreally seeing like an impairment and\nfunction like you know like ruthie's\nsort of saying like you may want to\nlook at some kind of outside support and\ni wouldn't rule out some kind of medical\nevaluation as well i don't i don't think\nshe needs outside support i think she\nshould\nshe should be a coach or like be a\ncrisis text line volunteer or like\nlike if if she wants a way to give and\nknow that she's giving but doesn't have\nlike the added baggage of like feeling\nguilty for not having done more or\nlike that kind of stuff i think\nthat could be a good outlet for you\nokay sorry if that was unclear\nthank you yeah\nwhat are you thinking sedona\num i\n[Music]\ni am volunteering at the moment but i do\nthink that\ntrying to help someone again\num and like just just do it for once and\nnot have that\nthat like strings attachment\nmay give me more information\num\nand i would like to try\nagain\num\nyeah\ni think that's good and also i was\ninterested in what you had to say basis\non like one singular moment could cause\nthat master depressive disorder because\ni was\ninterested in that\nif you wouldn't mind uh clarifying more\nwhat you meant by that\ni'm sorry can i clear oh yeah so so if\nyou just\nyou know just general education about\nthings like major depressive disorder\nso\nthe way that we differentiate between\nlet's say like stress in your life like\nhow do we know if str\nif you're struggling and that's result\nto a stress in your life or is due to\nsomething like major depressive disorder\nso a key aspect is that if something is\ndue to stress in your life if the stress\ngets better your mental health should\nget better with it right does that kind\nof logically follow exactly so one of\nthe key things\nthat we sort of think about in the field\nof mental health is that if\nsymptoms persist\nwhen the stress has\nresolved that can be an independent kind\nof major depressive disorder or\nsomething like that\nso what i was sort of suggesting to you\nis that you know this may be the kind of\nsituation we have no idea like\nyou know what you're actually\nexperiencing on a day-to-day basis and\nthat's sort of like on purpose because\nit's not our job to evaluate you for\nmeasuring depressive disorder but if\nyou're having\nyou know if you're kind of feeling like\nyou're really struggling in some ways\nand that you're maybe kind of\nunderplaying what you're sharing with us\nor it persists for a very long time and\nyour battery should be getting charged\nand it isn't being isn't uh getting\ncharged then i would talk to a doctor\nabout that because that could be all\nkinds of stuff it's not even necessarily\ndepression like you could have a\nhormonal imbalance\nthere could be something like sleep\napnea or anemia or like all kinds of\nstuff that can happen to people so what\ni'm saying is that oftentimes\npeople will think they'll think like oh\nif i'm struggling in some way like i\nshould change something about my\ninteractions it's something that i'm\ndoing it's something that i'm eating\nwhereas like sometimes it's just medical\nand you just need to get some expert\nadvice\nand\nsupport there\nokay\ndoes that offer enough context\nyes that makes sense thank you\ngood luck\nthank you i appreciate your time i feel\nlike we weren't able to give you as\nsatisfactory as an answer\nyeah i think there's a lot of specifics\nunder there that we would really have to\nget into\ni think so too\nit's a pretty general question for like\nyeah probably you'd need more context\nwhich would take\nlonger than just this time but i do\nappreciate your insight so far yeah so i\ni think try helping out someone see what\nthat does and you know if you've got\nenergy vampires in your family that can\nbe rough yeah\ntrue\nthat can explain a lot of it so\ngood luck okay\nhave a good rest of your streaming day\nbye thank you\nyou"
