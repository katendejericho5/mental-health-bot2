    "transcript": "at what point if you're making good\nmusic\noften\nare people not going to want to tune in\nthat's just like a recipe for success\nit's like same with like clothing you\nmake good music or good clothing often\nwhy wouldn't people want to buy it you\nmake good food\nall the time new recipes why wouldn't\npeople want to come to the restaurant\nthere's just so much music and like if\nyou don't\ncompete with the output of music there's\n46 000 songs on spotify every single day\ni do a lot of meditation and i i i\npractice mindfulness because\nmy brain will explode i am just a human\nand there's too much\ndata and information being passed into\nmy brain that's one of the the probably\nthe best things that i've been able to\nteach myself is like actually forcibly\ntaking a step back when things are\ngetting too hot\num\nhow do you know when things are getting\ntoo hot\noh i can feel it you know it's like your\nnervous system is just firing\nso welcome\nthanks man thanks for having me on\nthanks for uh\ncoming on we really appreciate it oh\nabsolutely um so let's just start with\nthis what what would you like to go by\ntoday how would you like me to refer to\nyou you can call me alex a lot of people\ncall me baby and like i like that too\ndon't get me wrong but um you know\ni'll take what i can get i think alex\nworks do you hear feedback coming from\nmy headphones or no not at all yeah okay\nperfect it's great um\nhave you got the water i got the tea\nit is nice yeah no sometimes people\nmistake this for water it's actually\nbought no i'm getting it's it's water\num\nyeah so alex help me understand a little\ni mean is there anything in particular\nthat you want to talk about today or\nanything that um you\nmaybe i can help you with\ni mean like just being a musician is a\nlot\nyeah at least all of my like musical\nfriends that i\nwork with and talk to\nall kind of go through\nsome of the\nthe same things oh\ni feel like\nuh there's like a lot of like\nself-deprecation and self-doubt that you\nknow\ni think this also probably\nlike encompasses just like the\nparameters of being a content creator\nbecause like you\nassess your self-worth and validation\nlike almost exclusively off like\nanalytics and statistics\num\nunfortunately i haven't figured it out\nyet so but i you know i think over the\npast like two years with cove and\neverything i definitely have\ngotten\nyou know\nokay with it uh with\nfor instance i i had a song la la la\ni don't know if you've heard it\nand it just kind of went\nusually my songs would go like this\nbut this song just went like straight\nparabolic um\nand i was like oh man like this is it\nthis is the start of my career like this\nis like i'm gonna be huge i'm huge but\nin in actuality you know things\neverything comes in waves and\nyou know it ended up going down and\nthere was a massive\npsychological issue within myself\nbecause i was like damn\nyou know how am i supposed to deal with\nnot everything hitting the hitting as\nwell as the other songs and and what\nlike that so it's okay no one really\nprepared me for that god bless that like\nyou know i went to university and i'm\nrelatively like\na spiritual individual that like\nyou know i was educated enough to like\nbe like seek seek seek help and and\num i was like just\nhappy that i was a you know i had a good\nuh good upbringing and everything\nbecause i was like i don't know if i\nwould have been able to deal with this\nand uh\nyou know as\nit's it's weird because it's like it's\nall so positive\nand yet there's so many negatives with\nit you know right um i i know yeah no\none explained that [ __ ] to me and it's\nlike damn you know like what the hell\nbut it and it's also kind of like i'm\nsure like twitch streamers feel the\nexact same way like i've done a fair\namount of twitch streaming and it's like\nif you don't keep up\nlike things go down if you don't keep up\nand it's like\nit's petrifying you know it's like thing\nthis is like my livelihood like i need\nit to work um\nso\nthat in itself is just kind of\nworrisome um\nbut\nyeah i mean that's just like one of a\nbajillion things that i like course that\ncourse through my brain probably daily\num wow wow yeah yeah so yeah so\num\ni i guess\nthank you so much for sharing all that\nalex i think there's just so much there\ncan i kind of just\nreflect back kind of what i heard\nyeah easy easy um\nso\nit sounds like you\ngrew up with uh you know some amount of\nadvantages like it sounds like you know\nyou had maybe support a family you sort\nof have a spiritual outlook on things\nyou've uh done some college gone through\ncollege\nand and that you have a lot to sort of\nbe grateful for right so like you had\nyou had particular\nsongs and stuff that were hits and and\nthere was a lot of growth\nbut it's kind of confusing because no\none really prepares you for the roller\ncoaster\nexactly and what what you would think is\nthat like on balance if you take all of\nthe gains and all of the losses you are\nso far ahead\nbut\nthat's not sometimes how it feels that's\nnot how your mind actually looks at it\nright because your mind is so damn\nrelative and and what it always does is\ncompare to what you've done recently as\nopposed to looking at like the summation\nof what you have to be grateful for and\nthen that's kind of confusing because\nthere's a part of you that's sort of\nlike\nwell i shouldn't you know i should\nfeel hype about this and there are parts\nof you that feel hype about this but\nalso like sometimes it's kind of weird\nbecause like your mental is sort of like\nnot doing what you would expect it to do\nand then it's kind of confusing even\nfurther because then it's sort of like\nwell like\neven when i look at things on balance if\neverything is\nin the end a net positive like and\nthat's not enough to raise my mood or\nwhatever then how do i navigate this\nright\nyeah exactly and i i've definitely felt\nlike there are\nso many situations where well my manager\nknows it for firsthand that i i said to\nhim yesterday i was like look man\nthings aren't moving as well as they\nshould be like we gotta go harder and\nit's like yeah you know\ni was looking out i was having a cup of\nginger tea\nand i was looking i drink ginger tea\nevery day because it's\ni will die without it um\ni was looking outside the window and i\nwas like dude what the [ __ ] like what am\ni doing you know\ni like i'm i'm really happy i'm so\nfortunate but i remember when i bought\nmy apartment my mom was like congrats\nlike you really have done this like you\nyou you know\nand i just died like i didn't even like\ni bought my [ __ ] apartment i didn't i\ndidn't think about it you know i was so\ndistraught i've been so distracted and\nso incredibly like\num\nuh just caught up in my own [ __ ] that\nlike\ni haven't noticed and i haven't taken\nsteps back ever and i i'm like i'm now i\nknow that i need to relax sometimes but\nunfortunately i'm kind of worried about\nthis year i have like a hundred extra\nshows until the end of the year sure so\nit's gonna be very it's gonna be very\nbusy um\nbut like\nyeah i'm i'm figuring out met you know\nlike the methods and and like practices\non how to like self-reflect a lot more\nthan i used to which is good and a very\ni think a relatively healthy practice\num\nyeah it also sounds tough because i'm\nsort of hearing you say like if things\ndon't go well right\nyou gotta go harder\nit sucks you gotta go hard\nbut if things are going well you can't\nslow down\nexactly so you've got two options right\nyou gotta go harder and you can never\nslow down so there's just there's just\none\nyou know\nand so how do you take a step back it\nsounds like you have developed some\ndegree of like keeping yourself sane\nthrough certain methods and practices\nand and stuff like that but yeah yeah\nman it's tough i i'd love to talk about\nthis if you're you know if that's i'm\nthat's why i'm here baby that's why i'm\nhere so talk to me alex about being a\nmusician\ntell me about that\nit's really like a beautiful thing you\nknow i started making music because i\ni was with a bunch of my friends we were\nsmoking a bunch of wheat and we laughed\nover beats and\nimmediately at that moment\ni was like this is really fun you know\nlike this shouldn't have been as fun\nlike the creative process of just like\nmaking something and like making\nwhich i wouldn't call art back then but\nsure it's called art um\nwhy wouldn't you call it\nwell the first song was not art\nthat was the\nthat was some crazy yeah um but now you\nknow now i call it sure it's art um\nuh you know i don't think i make like\nkendrick lamar level music but the goal\nis to obviously get to that point where\nit's my music is so undeniably like good\nthat people just\nwill allow me to be baby no money and\nforever um\nand uh\nyeah being a musician it's it's it's\nvery interesting and\ni i wasn't that musical when i was\ngrowing up my mom forced me to play\npiano but i couldn't read\num\n[Music]\nso i just kind of like you could found\npiano or like yeah\ni can read each other\ni can read piano uh or like notes and\nand i still actually struggle with like\nkeys\nbut\ni think i have a real relatively good\nlike understanding of what sounds good\nand what doesn't um and i think that's\nmore important in itself than actually\nhaving like the technicalities of making\nmusic it's just like being creative and\nthen just like being okay with whatever\nyou're making\num\nsorry i just yeah everything you say i\nhave so many questions but just keep\ngoing and i'll i'll talk about um\ni guess being a musician is great doing\nshows you know it's kind of interesting\nbecause from an outsider's perspective\nyou would assume that i've been making\nmoney from shows but it is very\ndifficult to make money doing shows and\nyou know that's not obviously end i'll\nbe all but like i remember when i would\ngo watch people at like 500 capacity\nshows i'd be like dude you must be\nmaking so much money like he's so cool\nlike but in actuality you're just like\nlosing money because you're like paying\nfor production you're making this show\nlike you're paying people and it's like\nyou're a business that is\nyou know allotting other businesses to\nflourish essentially like and it's great\ni you know my my videographer who's\none of my best friends now uh no well he\ncalls himself\nthe director now\num he has a kid and he's bought a house\nand i i genuinely feel like i provided\nhim a lot of money and he bought a house\nand he's happy and it's like\nyou know it's just like he like fired a\nbunch of other people we're not fired\nbut like stop working on other projects\nand like just kind of works on mine and\nit's beautiful and like i have offered\nthe ability to do that for him and and\nand we both like always reflect and\nwe're like dude like every time i go\nover to make a music video it's more\nlike it's like a retreat because we just\ntalk about everything we talk about\nhealth and and like wellness and\neverything and uh\nyeah i don't really know what else to\nsay other than that but if you have some\nquestions we can riff on those yeah\nabsolutely so i'm just sort of\nyou're talking about doing a bunch of\nshows and how maybe you don't make as\nmuch money as you think so maybe baby no\nmoney for real you know\num you know\nit's it's weird because my dad my dad's\nran\nlike a house first business for\nlike 40 years with his with his father\nand he was like if you spend more than\nseven percent on advertising\nyou're losing\nand i'm like\nseven percent i've spent i'm spending\nlike 75\nof my gross income and it's like\noh but i have a weird relationship with\nmoney we can talk about later too but uh\num but yeah ask me some stuff yeah so so\ntell me you say that you have a feeling\nof what sounds good help me understand\nwhere does that come from\nwell when you make music that is just\nlike object objectively dog [ __ ] for\nfour years and then you end up making\nmusic that is just objectively decent\nyou kind of just know what's happening\nlike i've made like 700 songs probably\nand\nyou know i don't make music as much as i\nused to anymore yeah it's a lot and like\nonly 100 have seen light of day because\nyou make a bunch of garbage um\nyou just like kind of figure it out you\nknow i don't really know how to explain\nit\nyou you you know when you know you made\na good song like you know you made a\ngood song and you usually make it really\nfast\nwhen you make it really fast you're like\noh wow like this one's going to connect\ni know it's going to connect and you\nhave this weird like deep profound\nfeeling\nthat\nit'll work everything everything\neverything with that song will work and\njust like\nthings kind of magically just put\nthemselves into place where it's like it\nseems like it's luck but it's not\nand uh\nyeah that i guess that's the best like\ndescriptor of\nhow to know what sounds right or how to\nknow what sounds good you also need to\nbe like pretty tapped in with\nwith what\npopular music is the sound of popular\nmusic at the current state because like\nfor instance look at drake\nlike his next song you know like there's\ngoing to be a new genre that's popping\nbecause of tick tock and then like\nlittle do you know drake's gonna make\nlike the exact same song that's like the\nbiggest song in the world\nand then his relevancy is still at key\nso\nthat's just that's just how you do it i\ndon't know if he's necessarily doing it\nhimself i can't really see him being on\ntik tok 24 7 but if he is then god bless\ndrake\nyeah so that that's so interesting\nbecause what i'm hearing from you alex\nis like this\nalmost like duality between on the one\nhand keeping up with trends on the one\nhand grinding on the one hand\nthis sort of very like external process\nof making music\nand on the flip side also like almost a\nspiritual process which has nothing to\ndo with that which is less the sort of\nlike deep profound feeling that you have\nwhere you like you kind of know that\nyou're like giving birth to something\nright and it's not calculated it's not\nbased on trends and you kind of just\nfeel it and it starts coming out really\nfast and you just feel really good about\nit\nno 100\ni think uh\nit's interesting i've done i've done my\nfair share of like dabbling with the you\nknow medicinal or non-medicinal drugs\nand uh\nwhen you're making a hit song there's\nnothing better like i you know it's like\neuphoria i i can't explain it like you\nyou just like you're sitting there and\neverything's just flowing out of you and\nit's like you know i'm not the best\nfreestyler i'm not the most i wouldn't\nsay i'm like the most creative\nindividual if i was\nyou know my career would probably be\nbigger but\nyou just feel it and it's like it's like\nuh\nit's like you know when you like crush\non a girl\nyou know uh\nand you like love them for like the the\nfirst infatuation period it's kind of\nlike that\nwhen you're making a song you're like\ndamn dude you know you start yourself\nyou maybe take your [ __ ] off in the\nstudio and like you start sweating with\nthe boys and\nand\nyeah it's like a really really good time\nand i you know i make fun i make music\nwith my friends because i'm so much more\ncomfortable with them and like\nit's just like making music with your\nfriends there's nothing better and you\nknow creating and\nthat's the beauty of being an artist is\nlike the creative perspective like you\nknow\nhaving to be creative and you know you\nyou get accoladed because you're\ncreative and and like you know when you\nsee that it's it's kind of like the same\nconcept of being like a stand-up\ncomedian i feel like a little bit less\nhectic because the standard comedians\nare like exclusively like\nthey require a laugh whereas like you\nknow we have more emotions that we can\nlike go with um\num\nbut\ndude yeah life's good\ni mean\nso help me understand what do you think\nit is that allows you to\nget to that state of connection what are\nthe things that sort of\nallow you to create your best music what\ngoes into that\ni mean coffee for sure\num\ni mean if if if you're living in 2022's\nyou know\nand you're not a coffee addict then\nyou're not doing it right in my opinion\ni have like so many gut issues that like\ndrinking coffee is like a double-edged\nsword for me\nso\ni still do it because i'm addicted and\nyou know when i tour i don't so when i\nwhen i have a coffee it's like wow it's\nfabulous it sounds like\nit's so it's like the one thing in life\nthat is always gonna be there and it's\nalways gonna be good you know i don't\nknow if you drink coffee like that but\ni [ __ ] love coffee um\nbut as far as like\nmentally where my head's at when i'm in\nthat like in the zone\ni have no idea because if i\nif i knew i would you know regurgitate\nthe knowledge of like me\npinpointing but\nso\nmaybe we can talkers i have some ideas\nabout that i've worked with a lot of\ndifferent creators musicians um also\nlike people like athletes and\neven when i've worked with people like\ntraders or professional poker players\nlike we'll talk a lot about\nyou know kind of getting into that zone\nand and i'm especially thinking about\npeople in finance where they sort of\nlike or poker\nwhere they\num\nthey can almost like predict the future\nlike in an eerie kind of way right where\nit it almost sounds similar to me of\nyour process where you're taking in a\nlot of information\nbut\nthe process of putting that information\ntogether\nis not really conscious\nand then like it almost becomes like you\nyou have to read what's going on in\nfinance and trends and and you know\nwhat's happening with bond prices and\ncryptocurrency and all that kind of\nstuff but then like it kind of goes deep\ninside you in some way and then it like\nyou know\nstews for a while and then something\ncomes out of it\nyeah i mean i've definitely because\nliving in vancouver british columbia\num there's usually no sun so\nsads are a super real thing here and\nevery time like there's a period of\nwhere i'm staying\nuh\nin like the off season i would say um\nand then i go to la and there's sun i'm\njust like so happy\neverything's bottled up like the\nemotions are bottled up and i just\nusually do like\nuh like a sporadic spree of\nof writing music and i usually write\nlike an album in a month and i just like\nbang it all out\nand uh\nmaybe that's it i\nokay\ni have no idea it's very profound yeah\nit's it's super profound uh you know i\nnever expected to be a musician so i'm\nglad that i've been able to experience\nthese emotions and like\nand like do what i want to do every day\nlike you know people always ask me like\nyeah like what's what's it like and i'm\nlike\nwhat it is is the best way to describe\nis you get up in the morning and you get\nup you don't lie in bed\ni don't i don't remember a lot i mean\nthe last time i laid in bed was i was\nincredibly hungover but you know like\nthat's the only time i would like lie in\nbed because i'm like okay my body like\ngenuinely needs it\nrather than like me just waking up on a\nnormal day and be like oh i just want to\nget to work i like i just want to like\nwork on this because\neverything i put into it is like\ndirectly correlated with like\nan increase or or or more success and\nit's so\nrefreshing and uh rewarding to be able\nto like have my own hand in things you\nknow\ni have a friend that works at a\nfacebook\nand he was just like he's just like\nfurious he's like dude like i'm way too\ncreative for this like i'm doing xyz\nevery day and that's all i get to do\nand then i'm like but that's kind of\nnice like you know you're doing xyz\nyou're getting you're getting paid for\nit you have a great great life now and\nyou don't have to be creative you don't\nhave to expend those like those stores\nright\nso\ni've always just been like damn if i\ncould work a nine to five that would\nlike progress my career to the point\nwhere it's like\nprogressing and like actually genuinely\nprogressing it i'd be stoked but it's\nit's just too difficult like you know\nyou know when you have all these social\nmedias and all these like all this data\nin your front of in front of your eyes\nall you want to do is just keep feeding\nthe data machine yeah\nit is it is\nyou know the tricky thing about feeding\nthe data machine especially when it\ncomes to our mind is\nthe more we feed it the more it grows\nand the hungrier it gets\nit's nuts in it it's crazy\num\ni wish there were no social media but\nthen i would not be a musician yeah i\nwish there wasn't so can you help me\nunderstand something alex you mentioned\nthat you're you'll be in vancouver\nbritish columbia for a while and then\nwhen you go down to l.a you mentioned\nyou use the phrase bottled up emotions\nso i was a little bit confused does that\nmean when you get down to la you start\nbottling them or when you get down to la\nyou uncap them\ni just i cannot\ndeal with not having sun in vancouver it\nrains like 75 of the days of a year and\nit's piss\nand uh you know\nit's sunny in vancouver now and it's\ninteresting my mom calls me every single\ntime it's sunny\nif that makes sense so\nshe's so happy she's like oh i want to\ntalk about the day i want to do this and\ndo that\nwhereas like\nwhen you go down to l.a it's just sunny\nevery day and people people like people\nare so spoiled down there it's not man\nthey are\noil\nand uh\nyeah it's just bottled up i'm just like\nready to write usually\nand then you know it's like an\nexpungement of\nsunlight and vitamin d when you walk\ndown there you know i like always my\nmanager always sees me just like lying\noutside on the pavement just soaking up\nthe rays like shirtless in his\nneighborhood so\nyeah so it sounds like the emotions come\nout\noh yeah okay for sure and then when\nyou're in vancouver they're usually\npositive because i'm in a\nbetter mood to be down there so it's not\nlike it's not like i'm you know\nexpelling the negative\nwell perhaps i am but\nit definitely feels more positive\nand so tell me a little bit alex about\nhow you manage so you mentioned that you\ndevelop certain methods methods or\npractices that sort of help you keep you\nsane\nand and maybe like you stay grounded\nwith can you tell us a little bit about\nthat\nso i do a lot of meditation um and i i i\npractice mindfulness because\nmy brain will explode i'm just a human\nand there's too much\ndata and information being passed into\nmy brain\num you know i studied kinesiology at\nuniversity and i know the benefits of\nexercise\nso i will\nsometimes slap myself in the face and be\nlike i need to go to the gym because i'm\nbeing anxious for literally nothing\nand\nyou know i'm having some crazy intrusive\nthoughts that i just know\nwill be gone if i go for a 10-minute jog\num\nand you know i can't really stress the\nbenefit of\nphysical activity\nyou know i used to be an athlete\num it helps you sleep it helps you eat\nhelps\nyou digest it helps you\nbe more of a man be more of a woman\nit helps you literally i\nit's the best thing you could probably\ndo for yourself um so i know that\ndeep down that whenever i you know i\ntalk to some fans that are like no i'm\nlike anxious i'm depressed like what am\ni supposed to do and i'm just like i\nalways i'm like i guarantee you you will\nfeel better if you do like\n30 minutes of cardio every single day\nfor like a month just give it a shot\nand like they always come back to like\ndamn how did you know i was like bro\nit's like it's not\nthe information is out there um but\nuh it feels good that i can like\nactually provide some like relatively\ndecent information because of my degree\neven though i don't use my degree and\nit's completely waste of my money but\nit was it was\ni got educated it's good and i learned\nhow to\nuh copy from text and not get caught so\nwould you look at that um\n[Music]\nuh\ndoes that kind of answer the question\nyeah so you so you mentioned you\nmeditate um you mentioned that exercise\nis really important especially for\nmanaging some of your your thoughts and\nstuff\num\nwhen you say meditate can you help me\nunderstand what you mean\nwell i uh i just do like guided\nmeditation um you know it's\nit's it's impressive that like a 10\nminute to 20 minute of just like\nbreathing like proper breathing and like\nlike forcing yourself to relax and\nforcing your like train of thought to be\nsomewhere else is like dude it's it's\nnuts how much it helps sometimes like\nif i'm overwhelmed i like i have to take\na step back\nand uh because it's just like what's the\npoint of being overwhelmed like i\nalready have gray hair i don't need any\nmore and\ni think that's one of the the\nprobably the best things that i've been\nable to\nteach myself is like actually forcibly\ntaking a step back when things are\ngetting too hot\num\nhow do you know when things are getting\ntoo hot\noh i can feel it you know it's like your\nnervous system is just firing\nlike um i was talking to my my therapist\na couple days ago and she was a\nshe was saying like yeah when you're in\na room with someone that is is feeling\nhot\nlike you can feel it and like\nsubconsciously feel it because like\nnervous systems can like kind of like\ncommunicate with each other so\num\ni find that really interesting because\nlike i've been in\nseveral situations where people are like\nyou know hypothetically mad at me\nhypothetically sad with me and\nhypothetically frustrated with me and\nyou could feel it so like\nwithout like them you know addressing\ntheir issue where where it's like if if\nyou're in a room and someone wants to\nsay something to you but doesn't know\nhow to communicate with you you can feel\nthe angst\nand uh\nsometimes when when\nyou know what whether or not you can\nfeel the angst or like you have that\nangst it's just like dude like take a\nstep back nothing matters\nyou know\nand\nback to like the first point that we\ndiscussed is like\nin the end of the day\nnothing [ __ ] matters\nunless it's family help me understand\nthat\ndude it's like family friends people you\nlove and\nthat's it like dude nothing matters like\nthat's it that's the only [ __ ] that\nmatters obviously food because food is\noh\ni love food um every type of food man oh\nthere's being able to tour and eat food\nis the is the real actual blessing of\nbeing an artist but\ni have a gut issue so i don't get to eat\ntoo too much food but\nuh typically like asian and\nlike asian cuisine it's like my favorite\nbut\nyeah nothing matters\nit's weird my videographer and i we do a\nfair share of uh\nhallucinogens and like healthy obviously\nand um\nit's great to be able to ground yourself\nwith those uh\nuh medicinally and we've we have had so\nmany conversations where it's like dude\nlike nothing matters and i'm like\nyou know you are right in the end the\nday it's like having him in my life\nmatters more than the business that we\ndo together and the money that we might\nmake 100 percent and like\nwhat other what other things in life are\nare like work enjoyment\nand that that's it so it's like\nit is so you know can you help me\nunderstand a little bit about what role\nhallucinogens play in your\nwhat what do you get out of using them\nlike what do they do for you creatively\nor\ni don't really make too many things\ncreatively on them but\nwhen i do a lot of work sometimes i'm\nlike yo sure as i'm coming over\nand\nit's kind of just like a reset you know\nit's like an emotional reset where\nfor that period you you don't have to\ndeal with anything that you've dealt\nbefore or and you can just live in that\nexact moment for instance like lsd is\nit's great it's like an intertwined\nexperience that that\nit's like\nmaybe the perfect definition of yolo you\nknow like carpe diem live in the moment\nand you just live in that exact\nencapsulated\num high for instance and everything is\nsuper super intertwined and every single\npoint and every single memory is\nin my opinion is stored as one\nand\nyou know i don't do it that often but\nwhen i need it i'm like damn i really\nneed to like\nlike think about things and and\ncan you help me understand\nwhat is your sense of when you need it\nlike what do you detect within yourself\nthat sort of tells you like signals to\nyou hey it's like it's time for this\nit's when you're ready i don't know okay\nlike you just know it's just like a\ni don't know that's a good question\nactually i uh because i definitely will\nnever do\ndrugs when i'm not in a healthy place\nthat's just like stupid so perhaps\nbecause it will drive you down and i've\nbeen i've done i've done mushrooms when\ni wasn't in a good place and\nyou know i i think it was a expelling i\ndid a ton of expelling but it wasn't a\npositive experience\num\nand i believe that life should almost\nexclusively be positive and\nyou know\nsurround yourself with like my team is\namazing i you know i was at the junos\nand\neveryone on my team is so positive and\nso charismatic and loving and\nyou know you don't find that that often\nin the music biz and usually it's more\nlike just business is business\nbut\ni like the wholesomeness is what i kind\nof strive for with people that i work\nwith\nand people that like genuinely care\nabout everyone else's well-being and\nit's really nice and\nuh you know like having like i read this\nbook called the nonviolent communication\ni can't remember that marshall something\ni don't know you probably read it great\n[ __ ] book for for business for\nrelationships for this for that for\nfamily and it just like\nhas offered me the ability to like\nreally grow and\nand and figure out\nthe most effective ways to communicate\nand to have a safe workplace and like an\nemotionally safe workplace and whatnot\num\ni don't know where i was really going\nwith this point but when i know i need\nto do them it's just like\ni just wake up one day and i'm like [ __ ]\nit let's go have some fun okay and uh\nyou know i i don't do it i don't do it\nbecause i need something i think i do it\nbecause it's like oh i like\nwhy not just have a little reset you\nknow like a lot of press\nyou know it's like uh that that button\nit's like\num\ndone or it's done i don't know home\ndepot button home\ni don't [ __ ] know whatever reason\nthat sounds good so so maybe what it uh\nyeah i've got let me can i think for a\nsecond\nalex\nthink all the way i'm gonna get some\nwater for my teeth\nthe thoughts are browsing\nam i well lit up enough i think i am\nyeah the only thing is sometimes when\nyou move you move out of focus but\nthat's not when you like lean back in\nyour chair that's really the only thing\nbut otherwise it's fine\num so\nso\nalex i'm gonna\nkind of push you a little bit so when\nyou say nothing matters\nso there's this kind of idea like when\nwhen i see a successful creator or when\ni imagine other people see a successful\ncreator um\nthe way that you live your life\ndoesn't seem on the surface to\nthe way you live your life doesn't seem\nlike it's a guy who doesn't think\nanything matters\nright you're kind of talking about doing\nmore shows you're talking about grinding\nyou're talking about kind of hustling\nyou're talking about\nyou know\nwaking up you've made 700 songs a\nhundred of which the you know that does\nnot sound like someone who\nfor whom nothing matters and i\nit gives me life\nit doesn't\nokay it's hard because i'm figuring out\nhow to\nuh perpetuate the\nnothing matters\num\ni think\nthat truthfully\ni know deep down that like me\nmaking a new song\nit's it's enough nothing matters it\ndoesn't matter it doesn't you know\nit just doesn't it like it i do it for\nmyself absolutely but\nlike i'm just a speck on earth you know\nlike we're all just specs on earth and\nuh\nyou know i think the only thing that\nmatters is like\npersonal\ngrowth\nand uh you know\nmy goal for this year is to become like\nobviously it's probably a little bit of\na\na difficult ask but like become like the\nbest person i've ever been in my 26\nyears of life and like\nwhether that's like\njust having better relationships and and\nlike owning up the things that i've done\nand and like really just coming full\nslate clean and like that's what matters\nyou know that's what matters it's rather\nthan like you know making money like i i\nlove making money my dad grew me up you\nknow\nit's a capitalistic society and we gotta\nplay the games sometimes and uh\nuh and i'm very fortunate to have made a\nlot of money and i'm you know i'm safe\nand and it's amazing it's actually like\nit's beautiful um and i thank every\nsingle one of my fans um\nbut it's like\nnothing matters i i don't know how to\nexplain it so so i i maybe maybe we can\nclarify because i i don't i don't think\nwhat i'm sort of hearing you maybe say\nis that the stuff that people\ntraditionally think matters like money\nand fame and success\nthat the more you've come to\nunderstand yourself in this world those\naren't the things that matter\nand and sort of like if you make a 10\nsongs and none of them see the light of\nday like that actually doesn't matter is\nthat fair to say is that what you kind\nof mean by that yeah 100 like like\nyesterday i was like\ni don't know how much long\nlonger i'll do music you know it is\npretty grueling sometimes with touring\nand whatnot but i mean i could just like\ndrop music and not tour\nbut\ni was thinking i was like damn like\nyou know once i'm done like i'm gonna do\nsomething that actually matters like you\nknow start a\nand there's non-profit\nreally really bad like\ndrug problem downtown eastside and it's\nlike you know it's the warmest place in\ncanada so\nmost homelessness\nor homeless people come and they they\nget like train tickets to come to to\nvancouver\num\nand it's bad\nand i've lived here my whole life and i\ndonate a lot of money to the women's\ncenter um and i like 90 of all the free\nclothing i ever get i just give it down\ni just i'm like i'm not gonna wear this\n[ __ ] like you know so i just give it to\npeople who need it um\nand\ni've always really really always wanted\nto\nuh\ndo something\npositive like very positive like i\nwanted to be a doctor and i wanted to\nhelp people\nand when i broke my back i figured out\nhow to be empathetic and because i you\nknow i actually went through an\nexperience that was really traumatizing\nand i was like how can i like how how\nbest can i help and give back and i was\nlike well i could just give back from\nbeing like an athlete and understanding\nthat people go to physiotherapy but\nnever actually [ __ ] do their\nexercises you know it's like so i i knew\nthat and i like from first experience\nand i was like okay well that's what i'm\ngonna do and then i feel like i've\nhelped a ton of people with my music and\nit's it's you know it's an honor and i i\nfeel blessed\nto have the ability to\njust make [ __ ] in my bedroom and like\nmake people happy you know it's great\nbut\ni feel like i want i it's very hard to\nmaterialize sometimes through through\nthe internet and you know i'm sure like\nwhat do you mean by that materialized\nwell unless i'm doing shows like i don't\nsee my fans you know like i don't like\nevery time i do a show even though even\nif it's sold out i'm like\nis anyone here you know like just like\nit's it's like kind of like that surreal\nfeeling where it's like\nwhat the [ __ ] like what is going on this\nmakes no sense i shouldn't be doing this\nbut i am\nand\nall of my friends are like alex like if\nthe show is sold out people will be here\nrelax\nand i like i just have this weird\naura around me that's like you know uh\nwhether or not it's like a perfectionist\nperspective i don't know um\nbut\nwhat is that aura around you what is it\nhow does it affect you what does it\ncreate in your mind\nwell\nyou know growing up\ni uh\nmy dad and my mom are pretty traditional\nand like they were like welcome to a\npulp type thing i started working at my\ndad's uh business like when i was like\neight nine\num\nyou know pay down to the table let's go\nget a little money and uh it was great\nit was super positive um\nbut\nyou know i'm a workaholic and it's like\ni just want my things i want things that\ni work on to do well and\num\n[Music]\ni'm i'm\nyou know there's two sides of me because\nit's like i don't care i really don't i\ndon't want to care but then i do because\nit's like you know i'm putting my\npersonality i'm putting my emotions in\nmy music whether or not they're like\nridiculous emotions sure but um you know\ni put i put a lot of time and energy\ninto my music that i want things you\nknow\nas anyone would right\nit's like you want you write a paper\nthat's 70 pages ideally you pass\num\nso\nit's uh when i was growing up you know i\nwas the youngest of the family and i\nkind of had it a little bit easy\nuh in comparison to my brother and\nsister and i feel like\nthere's always just been like a weird\nlittle sense of like you'll work harder\nwork harder work harder work harder um\nlike not necessarily like you're not\nenough but like\nit's just like that workaholic has been\ndistilled in my in my soul my dad was\nworking like 82 hour weeks before covet\nhit\nyou know\nmy sister's doing her phd in psychology\num\nand my my brothers works his ass off\nbeing a photographer and my mom's swiss\ndanish so me showing up late\nnever a thing um\nso\nthat that's kind of like where\ni grew up and like that was like\nthe the vibe in the house uh so\nand you know i'm fortunate to say that\nthis is the first time my grandparents\naren't doing too too well unfortunately\num and this is the first time i've ever\nfelt family distress and it is such a\n[ __ ] blessing\nand i'm so thankful that\ni grew up in like a house that was very\nsupportive and very strong and very\nhealthy\ndude i can't even\nwhen i have kids i got to do exactly\nwhat my parents did and\ni just like i\ncan't thank them anymore soon as soon as\nthey're ready for me to buy them a house\nand buy them whatever they want like\nthat's\nlike i'm all there like anything they\nwant i just like can't repay them\nanymore it's [ __ ] amazing so alex i'm\nnoticing that there's a lot of um\ntwo sides to the coins when when i hear\nyou speak so like you know kind of on\nthe one hand you're sort of saying\nyou know there's this workaholic\ntendency\nand then on the other hand like nothing\nmatters and like what's important is\nimportant you know on the one hand\nyou're\nvery calculatingly because that's what\nyou got to do in the business right like\nto stay up with trends\nyou know work on your socials like you\nknow cultivate that kind of thing and on\nthe other hand like none of that stuff\nreally matters\nyou know\nyou could you could focus on making\nmusic or you could do shows\num that you feel really grateful for the\nopportunity to like help people and\nsupport people and inspire people and\nmake good music and at the same time you\nkind of feel like really disconnected\nfrom them\neven when it comes to things like health\nlike you're you're someone who really\nprioritizes your health and at the same\ntime sometimes you're hungover from time\nto time and things like that you know\nyou kind of go too hard maybe eat a\nlittle bit too much\nyou know\nand even when it comes to things like\nthe positivity it's like so so when i\nwhen i sit with you i i get the sense of\nsomeone who's very optimistic someone\nwho's very hopeful\nbut but we sort of see or i'm sort of\nhearing\nlike you'll use words like grueling\nright like\nlike what you're what you're setting\nyourself up for\nis gonna have dark moments\nand what i'm kind of curious about is\nlike\nso i almost see you as like just all of\nthese\ni i think on the surface people may\nthink they're conflicting i don't\nnecessarily think they're conflicting i\nthink it may be like\nintegrating opposites\nas opposed to conflicting\nbut i'm kind of curious like you know\ncan you tell us a little bit about like\nthe grueling part and like the hard part\nand like because most of the artists\ni've worked with\ni mean i think it's the [ __ ] that makes\ntheir\nmusic\nand art\nso profound\nit's not the highs\noh\nyou know\nit's the dawn after the dark night\nand and what i'm getting from you more\ntoday is the dawn\nand maybe we're just catching you on a\ngood day but i'm super curious about\nsort of your creative process and and\nwhat you've been through that's hard or\nor you know like\ncan you share a little bit more about\nthat\nyeah so i guess there's like two sides\nof the business right it's like the\nmusic the music itself and then like\ntouring itself\nand uh\nmusic is chill totally fine just make it\nput it out hope it blows up fingers\ncrossed do a lot of marketing make a\nbunch of tick tocks make funny twitter\nposts and have fun with it\nand uh\nbut touring sometimes\nit's tough um\nyou know\ni have been dealing with like\nchronic sleep issues for like\nfour\nseven years\nso i'm sleep deprived like almost 24 7\nand i'm probably burnt out for the past\ntwo years um\n[Music]\nand when you're touring especially if\nyou're flying\nit's\nit's like\nyou go to bed at maybe one you wake up\nat four\nyou go to the plane you rinse and repeat\nfor months\nand uh\nyou know it's amazing like i like i love\nit being on stage is what makes it a\nbeautiful\num\nbut it's just like it's exhausting\nand it's\nyou know i've said i said i said this\n[ __ ] out myself so it's obviously my\nfault but so i can't i can't really be\nlike the one to be like\ni don't want to do it but uh\nbut i do i really do i like genuinely do\nbut sometimes like for instance i have\nvocal fry right now and i've drank like\n35 liters of water in the past two days\nthree days like i've probably pissed out\nall my electrolytes uh\nand\ni get i get scared because i'm like oh\n[ __ ] like if i blow my voice right now\nlike the next month is gone\nand and like\nthat's the stressful thing i used to be\ntotally fine with doing shows but i\nended up blowing my voice in australia\none one time\nand then it just like has never really\ngotten better\nand then i developed this like thing\ncalled sibo which is like small\nintestine bacteria overgrowth\nand i can't eat dairy i can't eat sugar\nkenny gluten\nso\nthe touring i'm eating is not ideal as\nit used to be because i used to eat the\ngood good all the time um but you know i\ngo for vietnamese food and that's like\nthe one thing i love the most\nuh but\nyeah it's just difficult like it's\ni didn't expect it to be as tiring um\nbut it's all worth it because you know\nyou you\nyou get to see the people that make your\nlife your life it's\nit's like\ni do it i do for myself i made my music\nbecause it's an outlet and i i'm so\nblessed to be able to do what i do but\ni do it for my fans because\ndude it's like you gotta you gotta repay\nthem somehow and like the easiest way\nand the best way to do it is like you\nthrow down a good show and like you take\npride in your show and you show them\nthat like\nthis is a reason why i list listen to\nthis guy you know this is a reason why i\ni list i like [ __ ] with his music and it\nit's sick he's great he's a nice person\nand like i've always felt that trying to\nbe\ngive every single person as much time as\nhumanly possible is is like the best way\nto do it because\nthey've given me they've given me time\ntime is money and you know i i can buy\ntime when i get alex if it's you say\nit's all worth it\nif it wasn't worth it would you be able\nwould you know would you notice would\nyou let yourself say so yeah 100\n100\ni'm\npretty aware with when things aren't\nworth it um i don't know what else i\nwould be doing regardless i do want to\ngo back to school when i get older um i\nwant to get like a\na degree in nutrition and work for like\na\nlike a rugby team\num\nbut i don't know\ni i uh i\ni i really think it is i really think my\nlife is amazing and i'm so happy to do\nwhat i do what do you do with the parts\nof yourself that doesn't feel like it's\namazing\nthose those parts that i mean so because\nthis is sort of what i'm getting from\nyou is like i i i understand that i see\nthat you're resilient\ni think the challenge is that\ni think there's so many artists who\ndon't\nwho can't do what you've done\nright they're the ones that wake up at\nwhat you know you go to bed at one in\nthe morning\nand then you wake up three hours later\nto catch a flight and in the grand\nscheme of things i think you've\ndeveloped a healthy amount of detachment\nis what i would call it when you sort of\ntalk about nothing matters and we can\ntalk about spirituality and stuff in a\nsecond but like\nbro like\nthat sounds rough man\nright yeah\nyou know\nsleeping on flights oh i just wish i\nwish first class wasn't so stupidly\nexpensive and sleeping on flights was\nlike applicable for me i saw i put like\ni put my mask on i put ear plugs in and\nthen i you know like the neck pillows i\nwear it like this\nso it's like a little like teletubby and\ni like put my head on the side yeah and\nuh\ndude yeah i just wish i i\ni mean [ __ ] playing dude i hate planes i\nknow i mean i like alex there's a part\nof me that's a little bit worried that\nyou're kind of like\nyou're eating up your life energy for\nthe sake of what you do like you know\nyour your guts kind of going out like\nyou're having trouble sleeping like i'm\nnot trying to make a mountain out of a\nmolehill here but i'm\nyeah\nyou know it's\nthere's a part of me that's like\nconcerned about the price that you're\nputting\nyourself through\nuh\ni don't really know what to say to that\ni mean my dad i was hanging out with my\ndad yesterday and i fell asleep in the\nin the living room he's like\nbro it's 4pm i'm like yeah but i'm tired\num\nand he's like\nhe's like you know you're burning it\nyou're burning it too hard this life you\nlead is too hectic and\nit is\nbut it's fun\nit's it's you know i love it i\nam an\ni'm i love it i uh\nhow much of it is is that you love it\nand how much of it is that you can't\nafford to do it any other way\nright because i'm sort of hearing\nbecause i i i think i'm hearing both\nyou know i hear a lot of genuineness and\nif my questions are offensive please let\nme know but i'm also like wondering\nbecause i think part of the challenge is\nthat when you love it\nit's so much easier\nto sacrifice yourself for it you know\noh 100 percent there's no right no and\nthen like the hustle rolls in and then\nthe social media and you're doing so\nmany shows and it sounds like you're not\nmaking a whole lot of money and then\nlike you know like here you are like\nwholesome like\ndoing it for the art and like this is\nthe music industry man like someone's\nmaking money it just may not be you know\nwhat i'm saying\nno no it is pretty cutthroat this\nbusiness um\ni don't know i i really i\nyou know that's probably something that\ni should like\nwell that's something i know that i\nshould think about more often um\nyou know i i had this manager antonio\nand\nwe ended up splitting because it was\njust covered and no one was happy with\nanyone and no one was doing well no one\nwas happy\nand uh i remember we got on a call and\nwe had like a debriefing like four\nmonths later type thing was like a\nfull-blown breakup type thing it was\npretty funny and uh now we're friends\nnow and we work together again and it's\ngreat um\nbut we were like dude\nwe were killing ourselves\nlike just\nstraight up like\nruining our our lives\nand\nyou know we had a long conversation\nabout it because\nwe were you know like we were spending\nlike 18 hours a day just like trying to\nmarket my music and trying to push my\nmusic out and like\nyou know it was like\nstatistically doing infinitely better\nthan my music now and like\nbut it's like at what point at what cost\num\ni do i do definitely there's no question\nin my mind struggle with\nwork-life balance um\nand i know i have that problem but it\nalso comes from people who aren't as\npassionate\nuh and i i just lost you there what do\nyou mean does it comes from people who\naren't as passionate comes from people\nwho aren't as passionate about\nnot necessarily what i do but about\nthings\ni i\nwhen i focus fire on things i focus\nreally hard\num and i i you know i love i love things\nand i when i when i love it's like it's\na it's\ni love\num\nso\ni uh\ni've been trying to work on the\nwork-life balance within myself type\nthing it's like rather than just like\ngoing to do things i've i've been trying\nto figure out specifically like what i\nneed\nfrom both\num\n[Music]\nbut it's it's difficult you know that's\nthe that's one of the most difficult\nthings i've ever had to do in my entire\nlife because i just\ni love doing what i do you know and uh i\nfeel like a lot of people don't have\nthat ability to say that they do\nand it's like it's a goddamn blessing\nfor me\nyou know i wonder if that blessing comes\nwith an obligation\nobligation in what sense like you know\nsince you love what you do does that\nmean that\nyou can't take a day off you know since\nyou are so lucky if that comes with sort\nof like\na certain amount like you know\non the one hand\nyou wake up every day and you're ready\nto get out of bed which is awesome like\nyou have a lot to be grateful for and\nalso it's like\nif you didn't feel like getting out of\nbed would that be okay\nyeah i hear exactly where you come from\num a good example was my friend young\ngravy blew up and i was still university\nhe was still at university too\nand i uh\ni just remember being like\ni need to take this up a notch\ni'm i am obliged because\ni have to do this\nno one else is granted the opportunity\nto have a frequent collaborator like the\nmost frequent collaborators of both of\nour bs\nblow up and then i'm just like dude like\nwe have an ep together like this is this\nis go time like so i stopped like\npartying and i started drinking coffee\nat three in the morning\nand like sleeping less and just like\nworking my ass off because i was like i\nhave to do this because i look down in\nthe future\ni'm gonna shoot my feet you know like\ni'm like why didn't i try like why like\nwhy didn't i take this opportunity of a\nlifetime\nand\n[Music]\nmaybe that's kind of where it came from\nyou know like\nalex\nlike yeah i don't know what does it take\nto succeed in this business\num\na lot of it is luck a lot of it is\nfacade\na lot of it is uh\nwhat was that facial expression i asked\nyou what does it take to succeed and\nit's interesting because you're so\npositive\nand i was expecting a positive answer it\ntakes it takes passion it takes love but\nyou're like oh [ __ ] me\n[Laughter]\nit's\ni don't know i\ni mean one the biggest thing\nthe biggest thing is just\ngood music if you can make it\nand two is a lot of it\nbecause at\nat what point if you're making good\nmusic\noften\nare people not gonna want to tune in you\nknow that's just like that's just like a\nrecipe for success you get it's like\nsame with like clothing you make good\nmusic or good clothing often why\nwouldn't people want to buy it you make\ngood food\nall the time new recipes why wouldn't\npeople come to the restaurant you know i\nmean it's like you just have to be\ninnovative you have to be creative you\nhave to be always on your toes\num\ni'm hearing what it makes us all the\ntime\nthat's all the time 100 percent the if\nif like i i did my first 10 000 hours\nbefore\ni blew up\nso\nyou know\nif that if that's a consolation of how\nmuch work this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes\ntell me about tell me about the luck in\nthe facade\nwell you you got to be interesting i\nmean i am very fortunate to have\npresented my branding online as me\nand i don't have to do anything else i\ndon't have to be anyone else and it's\ngreat and i don't have like imposter\nsyndrome and i you know i'm i'm very\nhappy that i've done that and i just get\nto literally be myself on a constant\nbasis um and i think that's also like a\nselling point with my brand is a lot of\npeople\nlike me i'm just a nerd you know i'm\njust like a gamer kid like i'm wearing a\ndiablo 3 t-shirt you know like\nand i feel like people can relate to\nthat and i'm glad that i have been able\nto offer people a ton of\ntime like a safe place to relate to\num whether or not like my music is pg\nbut i mean [ __ ] it who cares um\ni'm not hearing much of a facade i'm\nkind of confused because what i'm\nhearing is that this is actually like\nauthentically who you are so what do you\nmean well no no that's for me that's\nwhat i'm saying i i just like dude\ni met so many musicians and they're not\nat all like what they perceive\nthemselves to be online and it's like\nyeah you can fall into the world where\nyou become that person that you've\ncreated\nbut\nyou need people to live vicariously\nthrough you so you need to be cool you\nneed to be\ninteresting enough intricate whereas\nlike it's so it's so interesting because\ni take twitch as an example and and\nstreaming\nis\neveryone's\nreal\non it there there's just like no point\nof not being like um you know unless\nyou're doctor disrespect i'm like legend\nyou know like perhaps he is a little\ndust or disrespect inside but like\nthere's no way he's like every day walks\ndown with coffee and he's just like\nwearing sunglasses and there's a green\nscreen in the back you know it's like\nhe's obviously like there's some of him\nthere but\nit it's way more difficult because you\ngot to be on fire for like seven hours\nright\nand and that's just that's just not for\nme like i did twitch streaming for a\nwhile and there'd be days where i'd be\nlike slam a coffee and go crazy and then\nmy voice would be hurting afterwards and\ni'd be like dude i gotta just not do\nthat i'm just gonna watch master chef\nand just follow the beta or the yeah\nlike the the master meda um\nif that kind of answers the question\nyeah i\nyou know it's interesting because\nthis may sound kind of weird\nalex but\nyou're you're just really different from\nmost of the people that i've worked with\nlike\nso i'm all for gratitude i'm all for\nappreciating things but like you know\ni i don't\ni\nhow can i say this\nso\nit's not it's not a bad thing it's it's\num so\ni was hoping that when we had this\ninterview there are creators out there\nbudding musicians\nwho could watch this\nand learn something from it and could\ncould really take away something about\nwhat's made you successful and apply it\nto their own lives but what i'm really\nhearing is that there's just so much\nabout\nyou know what you have that\ni think it's hard for people to\ntake that away right like i think it's\njust so hard for people to take away and\nthat's why i'm so curious about where\nwhere you're\nunderstanding where your gratitude like\nwhere does this come from like i can't\ntell if you're\ni i can't tell\nthe gratitude comes from all of my\nfriends being like alex wake the [ __ ] up\nwhat does that mean take your day off\ntake a day off enjoy your life go\noutside\ntouch some grass you know like\nbut that's where that's where that comes\nfrom that's where like my\nmy support group and my friend group was\nunbelievable um and i couldn't have\nasked for a better friend group and\nyou know couldn't ask for a better group\nof real people that don't yes man me\nand\ni send them a song and they hate it they\nwill say this is trash alex\n[ __ ]\ngo eat an egg you know what i mean like\nso that that's where that comes from is\nlike i'm i'm\ni'm blessed to be around great people um\nbut i mean when it comes to\nlike the the\nto provide uh\ninformation of like how things have been\ndone in my business is like\ni don't know how else to put it other\nthan like just drop music\nall the time\nand\ndo\na ring of the social media don't don't\ndiscredit a social media because you\nmight blow up on social media first and\nlike just\nupdate it every day if you want update\nit once a week\nsure\nthat's all you gotta do that's like\nand you just gotta make good music you\njust you just gotta make good music so\nhowever long it's gonna take you to make\ngood music should be the moment when you\nrealize\nor the moment\nthat you're like all right now\nthings might work rather than rather\nthan from the get you know like i know\nso many musicians in vancouver that like\ni've been working on an album for four\nyears and it's like why haven't you put\nmore music out because like no one's\ngonna care about the album\nand it's like you need a fan base to\nyou need to utilize your fan base and\nlike that fan base needs to help you\num and if they believe in you they will\nthey will share it they will come to the\nshows they will post the shows they will\num\nthey're your team in the end of the day\nand it's like it's great\ni don't know\nis that yeah yeah so let me see if i i i\nthink maybe\ni had a bias in and of myself and that i\nwanted a romantic answer\nyou know i wanted like no romantic\nthere's no romance here no i mean and i\ni think that that may be that may be the\nmessage like so what i'm hearing is like\nyou know here's here's your formula for\nsuccess the first is\nmake a [ __ ] ton of music\nyeah most of it's gonna suck\nand and\nthat's just\nthat's how it is right like it it's like\na numbers game and the more you make\nthe greater the chance is like to cat\nlike it's almost like you're trying to\nbottle lightning like you gotta catch\nthose sparks\nreally that is that is it like unless\nunless you're the type of guy that's\nlike just like a genius like a genius\nlike songwriter like but\nthere's\n10 a generation\nso that's just not the case um\nand like nowadays\nthere's just so much music and like if\nyou don't\ncompete with the output of music there's\n46 000 songs on spotify every single day\nnew songs\nnew songs every single [ __ ] day\nand it's like\npoint zero zero zero one percent of\nthose get above like two for 2 000\nstreams\nisn't that crazy like absolutely\nmind-blowing\nand it's like\nhow do you beat be through the like\nwhack the weeds you know like how do you\nget through the weeds\nand it's like you just need to reach out\nto people you need to collaborate you\nneed to that's the one thing i've\nactually noticed with\nwith content creators i guess that's\nlike the best terminology to say like uh\nyoutubers and twitch streamers is they\nare very open to collaborate\nvery very open and it's you know whether\nor not it's like a little bias\nperspective because i am baby no money\nlike i have a brand and it's like\ncompletely separate from the world sure\nbut\nthey're very nice people the music biz\nnot so much um\nand it's way more cliquey it's way more\num\n[Music]\njust like\nkind of\ni hate to say this word cloud-based\nand it's like if you don't have your\n[ __ ] up if this shit's not going no one\ncares and it's like no one will care\nand it's like\nit's difficult you know i i feel like\nwhereas like\nthe gaming world dude it's so nice\neveryone's sick and i love playing video\ngames with people and it's like\neveryone's just funny you know it's like\nthat's it no one is like no one's making\nsad music because they're set or like\nsad gaming because they're sad\neveryone's just happy upbeat like\nobviously people have their own [ __ ]\nthey're dealing with for the most part\nbut like\nyou know what i mean it's like it's a\ncompletely different like tone\nyeah i mean i i\nthere's just so much i'm sort of\nstarting to put together so one is like\nyou know it's\nthis sort of tension between\nso what i'm really noticing about your\nlife alex is that you're like you're\nwalking a tightrope in so many different\nways\nso there's like\nyou got to hold on to nothing nothing\nmatters because\nif you let things start to get to you in\nthis world of social media and stuff\nlike that like it's gonna tear you apart\nright you can't let that aura of\nnegativity start to take control and\nbalancing that is that you in the music\nindustry it is about clout it is about\nwho's popping off it is about\nyou know\nbecause there are 46 000 songs a day and\nand\nin a sense like in the industry\neverything matters\nyeah\nand like what i'm hearing about kind of\nyour kind of\nthe way that you've made it is first of\nall it's just make a [ __ ] ton of music\nbecause some of it's gonna be bad most\nof it's gonna be bad but also that\nyou've gotta you've gotta grind like on\nall the the other channels too like it's\nlike you know you gotta keep up with\nsocials\nyou gotta you gotta do shows\nyou know you gotta you gotta spend\neverything you've got you've gotta be\nable to take criticism and then also\nlike in order for you to succeed just\ngiven how much that squeezes out of you\nright like it squeezes so much out of\nyou because you gotta like you gotta be\ngetting on airplanes you gotta post on\ntwitter and you gotta be making music\nsomewhere in there\nright and so then how do you survive\nthat like you gotta have solid friends\nyou gotta have people to keep you in\ncheck you gotta have people to help you\nunplug\nyou gotta i found the the\nyou know the first couple tours were\nlike okay like i'm gonna party you know\nwhat i mean like\nwhy not like this might not last\nended up lasting god bless um\nand\ndude first tour was a\n[ __ ] show just don't\nlike i i don't party much the last time\ni party was at the junos and i like\nreally partied because so the junos is\nthe grammys of uh canada pretty much\nand i got to perform and i said on live\ntelevision that i was no longer a virgin\nand it was just\nthen i dapped up the health minister of\ncanada afterwards and shawn mendes and\nit was just like the funniest [ __ ] i've\never done in my life and like it was so\ninvigorating because it was on live\ntelevision in canada and you know i i\nthink i i think i tapped\nthe bell for canadian culture at one\ntime and uh\ni was like okay i got a party i just\nlike i need to rage and i don't party\nanymore because my gut issue and holy\n[ __ ] that set me back if if i was\nlegitimately on tour i would have had to\ncancel shows like i was unable to speak\nfor the past three days and i haven't\nspoken this is pretty much the first\ntime i've had a conversation and i'm\nglad because i'm using the\nthe muscle again and i gotta go tomorrow\nbut\njust don't just treat yourself with\nrespect yeah when you're touring that's\nthe only way you're gonna make it like\nyou you unless you're just like motley\ncrue which is\nhectic but i don't know if it's it's\njust not healthy to do that and you you\nwon't last like you just you will burn\nout so fast yeah\nyeah i'm hearing to keep up the pace\nyou've really gotta you know everything\nfrom ginger tea to exercise to\ntrying to sleep right because like i\nmean it's gonna take every ounce you've\ngot and it's gonna take a little bit\nmore and so you've gotta figure out\nhow to stay on top of things as best as\nyou can\n100 and and i think what's what's sort\nof sad about that answer is it's not\nthis sort of like deep creative struggle\nright it's like it's waking up on time\nit's like\nstaying\nfree of gluten and dairy\nand and making it making 100 songs that\nwill never seat the light a day or 600\nsongs in your case\nit is the struggle man it's the struggle\nnot being able to eat pizza is a [ __ ]\nstruggle\noh my goodness gracious dude bread is so\nsimple the simplest carb ever and you\ncan just like and it just fuels you past\nthe so so simple but\nnothing it is what it is though\ncool\nyeah\nany questions for me so far alex\nanything that you're kind of curious\nabout or anything that i've mentioned\nthat you want to talk about\nnah man i uh\nunless you unless you have like a\nuh if anything's like sparked a trend\nthought process in your head where it's\nlike\nthere are these weird\nyou know it's like every single\nconversation\nalways falls at one point and it's like\nevery single thing that i state is like\nis like there's a note where it's like\noh that can probably be reiterated\nbecause of this\ni would love to hear that yeah so yeah\nso i've got a couple of thoughts one is\nthat i i think um\nso i think you're pretty self-aware\nand so you remember i was asking you\nlike how do you know when\nit's time to take a day off\nyeah and and i think what's going on is\nthat\nyou can almost think about it like\nhunger or thirst\nwhere now i'm i'm starting to see a\nlittle bit better that like you know\ngiven your work ethic and and given your\nschedule and stuff like that that like\nthere's almost this like hunger meter\nor like i need a [ __ ] break meter\nthat is kind of like in the back of your\nmind like how do you know when it's time\nto eat you just some part of your body\nyour mind just kind of tells you right\nyeah that's how you know and so i think\nthat's\ni think they're just you are pretty\nself-aware and so i think that you've\ngot certain dials that are kind of\nyou know\ntuning up a little bit and then you kind\nof really need to take a break because\nit does sound like you kind of ride\nyourself pretty hard\num\ni think another thing that i think we\ncould talk a little bit about or i could\nshare because i know also you know\nyou've got vocal fry and stuff and and\nmaybe i can i can do most of the talking\nfor the next 10 or 15 minutes but we\ncould talk a little bit about\nspirituality meditation and the creative\nprocess\nso you know i think a certain amount of\nit is definitely grind but\nas you were saying earlier like i would\nalmost describe or based on the work\nthat i've done with people that\nyou know it's a state of consciousness\nwhere you're like it's almost like the\nflow state if you've heard that term\num but where where kind of ego is out of\nthe picture metrics are out of the\npicture\nlike\neven you are kind of out of the picture\nand what you really are is like a\nconduit for music\nand then everything is kind of flowing\nand you kind of said that it happens\nrapidly right it's not like this\nanalytical editing towards perfection\nkind of process it's like it's very\nspontaneous\nyeah\num i'm not surprised to hear that\nso the the thing that i've always\nstruggled with in terms of helping\npeople get to that state is i've noticed\nthat some people\ni do think\nnot necessarily\nin the moment but that substance use\nmaybe a week before helps you get there\nin a weird way\ni i do think that using substances gives\npeople the impression\nthat they can be in that state but\noftentimes they're not quite as\nproductive\nless true musicians and artists that\ni've worked with um\nyou know and some people will use hard\ndrugs and just be like super creative i\nthink they just pay the price over time\nand it's not really sustainable\nbut definitely\nbut but i i think that there's\nyou know and and and i would also kind\nof uh\necho for you as well that\nall of the intellectual stuff is\nimportant following tick-tock trends and\nstuff like that but then like i do think\nthat there's this process where you pull\nall that stuff in you know you're paying\nattention you're really working with\nyour mind but then the creation of music\nis when you transcend that process you\nkind of like bring it all in\nand then you stick it in a pot and you\nlet it ferment and then what comes out\nis different from what went in\nyeah you know it's almost like brewing\nbeer where it's like we're gonna put in\nhops and we're gonna put in this source\nof sugar and we're gonna put in this and\nwe're gonna put a little bit of this\nmaking wine and we're like we're gonna\nput in these different kinds of and then\nlike what you get out of it is something\nthat is\nits own thing\nand you may not even be able to detect\nthe components\num\nbut i think that flow state is actually\nreally really important\nand cultivating and i think that's where\ni'm i'm not surprised or i'm happy to\nhear that you know you do exercise you\nyou do take care about your diet and\nthings like that because i think all\nthat stuff has to be there in order for\nyou to\nreally channel that state of\nconsciousness because the thing is you\ncan't call it up it's not a skill\neven with all of your experience you'll\nenter into it\nand you'll be kind of like\nyou know it'll be coming out of you and\nthen you'll lose it\nand those 600 songs that never see the\nlight of day or when you're trying to\ncreate you don't access it\num\nand so that was just one thing that i\nyou know i just\nthought was kind of interesting because\nto hear you really talk about that kind\nof deeply profound sort of state that\nyou get in where it's like you\nyou know\nlike it it's almost it feels\ntranscendent to me\nyeah\nno i mean it is\nit's honestly just a regurgitation uh\ninspiration is kind of like a\nregurgitation of what you've\ntaken in for the past xyz so\nyour point is very accurate um\nand you know sometimes they even even\nlyrically sometimes i will take\ninspiration\nuh from something that is relevant or\nsomething that is like newly relevant uh\nor unfortunately sometimes i just think\ndon't update my music afterwards i write\nit and then sometimes there's just like\ni remember there was one song i put out\nin like 2019 it was like 2017 what up\nand then\nand then uh you know it's just like\nbut whatever it doesn't matter um\nthe other questions\nthe other question that i had for you is\ncan you tell me about kendrick lamar\nhe's a goat\nlike his last album this song uh we cry\ntogether\ni don't know if you i don't know if you\nlisten to kendra\num not much\nbut his last song or his last album is\ngreat and there's a song called we cry\ntogether and it's\nit's a five-minute song with uh i think\nsome actor a voice actor or an actor but\nit was him arguing with his signature\nsignificant other\nand\nit's just genius\nlike i don't know you gotta go listen to\nit they're just arguing it's it's pretty\nmuch like the heated amount of an\nargument from\ntypical relationship [ __ ] into them\ngoing to have sex and it's just yelling\nswearing the whole way through\nand\nit's just their back and forth and\nthat's like\nhow is this a song\nand you know it is a song it's just\ngenius and it's like\nyou don't you\nwe're living through a time where he's\nlike going to be like\na legend like a like\nundeniable legend to the point where\npeople 100 years from now may listen to\nkendrick lamar um\nand\nthat's a blessing what is it what is it\nthat makes him\nso good\num what do you respect about his work\nit's very contextualized\nwhich a lot of music nowadays has no\nrelevancy towards other songs for\ninstance my music um\nand he\nyou know in a day and age of singles and\njust\none type song drops\nhe still\ndrops albums that\nare albums\nand you know a lot of other musicians do\nit but he does it just better than most\num\nthat's pretty much it can you it's just\nadmirable can you help me understand\nwhat do you mean by contextualized\nlike everything sounds like it fits\nlike as an album\nthat's an album yeah like you listen to\nlike pink floyd you know back in the day\nit's like when you run it run an album\nyou run the album you like have to\nlisten to it in full because it just\nmakes so much sense they were the first\npeople that were doing like beginning\nand end of songs that were running into\nthe to the older songs when they like it\nwould keep\non the vinyl go through right so\nand they were the first people to do\nthat and like\nlook at them legends\nyou know\num\nlike i i recently just listened to a\nbunch of pink void again i was like\nholy sh\nthey made some hits\nlike\nreally good songs and\nyou know\nthey went down in in history for sure\nthey're that they're still you know\nthey're still history that like it\nhistory in the making is right now with\nkenneth lamar and like some of these\nother greats\nand\nhe just he just embodies like\nan album really well um\nand it it it's almost like he's painting\na picture his his songwriting abilities\nis fabulous um and it's very vivid\nalmost like good man city is probably\none of my favorite albums ever and\nthere's like a\nthere's a scene where he's talking about\nlike how his uh his friend is shot and\nwhat's it called and\nthere's so many sound effects and\nthere's so much like\nuh imagery just distill when you're\nlistening to the song and it's like holy\n[ __ ] like i can see this photo you can\nsee it happening\nand not many musicians have that ability\nyou know i mean like like i can say like\npee pee poopoo and stuff like that and\nfun stuff but like\nmy next next next album\ni'm really going to spend\ni'm gonna dial it in and i wanna i want\nit to be the best work of art that i've\never made\nunquestionably to the point where it's\nlike\nyou know it's one of those things you're\nnodding your head you're like alright\nlike he did his thing here and then at\nthat point i don't know what i want to\ndo with music afterwards but that'll\nprobably come out next year um and i'm\nexcited to like go to an island and get\na studio and stay at this island for two\nmonths and turn my phone off and just\nlet it let it all out\nso\num\nwell that's why i like kendrick kendrick\nis really great at painting a picture\nthat yeah not many music can i'm so just\nto\nsee if i kind of understand what you're\nsaying so like the first thing is that\nin this world of\ncontent creation\nright which is such a it's such a\nsoulless\nkind of\nlike\nalgorithmic\nyou know like we're moving from blogs to\nvlogs to video essays to\ntick tocks to\nyou know\na world from blogs to twitter right 160\ncharacters\neveryone's making\nstandalone songs\nand and kendrick is making an album\nhe's he's elevating it it's like back in\nthe day like i mean i don't even know if\nyou're you're gonna remember this or if\nyou were when i was growing up like you\nknow episodes for cartoons that i used\nto watch were not narrative there were\nlike one episode and it has no\nconnection to any of the other episodes\nand nowadays what we have is we'll have\nlike tv shows that are like\nnarrative right they tell like one story\nover the course of a season or multiple\nseasons or things like that and i'm\nalmost hearing you kind of say that that\nwhat kendrick lamar does is his whole\nalbum is like as you mentioned\ncontextualized so it all fits together\nso everyone else is making like\nyou know one-liners and he's just\nbuilding something that's larger which\nis so much harder to do\ni mean he genuinely also has the ability\nto do that because like musicians\nnowadays like\nif you just you gotta drop singles until\nlike you get a fan base and like he's\none of the biggest in the world\nso\nif i was at his level\nand i didn't drop like a\nan album that was like all front to back\ntype thing then i'd be doing my a\nginormous disservice to myself sure\nbecause like that's what i want that's\nwhat every musician wants they want to\nbe able to dial it in and write exactly\nlike\nlike a perfect album you know they want\nyou know obviously his music is\nincredibly subjective but they want to\nbe able to write a front to back type\nthing where\nif you have that big of a fan base like\nyou can afford to do that you can afford\nto do that yeah absolutely whereas like\nme like singles naturally just do infin\ninfinitely better than album songs like\nif you go into any one of my albums\nlike my album tracks like on a good day\nthey'll be doing like six seven million\nin half a year whereas like a single\nprobably will be sitting at minimum 15\n20 and\nyou know it's just like\narguably like it's a night and day type\nof effect sure\nso\nyeah kendrick's kendrick's gate great as\nhell he's the best\nand it also sounds like he's able to\nuse music to paint a picture\nwhich is oh oh well you know which is\nwhich is so interesting just from a\nneurological perspective like i'm so\ncurious what's happening in the brain\nin terms of how that how that happens\num\nyou'd be surprised i it's funny because\nwe know absolutely jack [ __ ] about the\nbrain right so\nmaybe in the future we'll know but uh\nbut i actually like i want you to go\nlisten to we cry together after this\nsure and i will like just experience it\nbecause it's\nit's not something you turn on at the\nparty it's barely something that you\nturn on with the boys it's barely\nsomething you turn in the car it's like\nyou listen to it\nand you're just like wow like\nthis is like a work of art this is like\nliterally art so\nit's it's great and and alex what i'm\nalso hearing from you is that\nyou know\nthis is gonna be your year to really\nmake the best music you've ever made\ni mean\nknock on wood\num but yeah january february i've\nalready told all my producer friends and\nall my friends i was like\ndude we get i was like we gotta dial it\nin i like exercise\nbeachfront\nyou know like\neating whatever island i'm gonna be on\neating local food every day fish you\nknow like\nliving the life of\nof of a successful musician\nbut\nmore importantly making\nwhat i really really really have been\ndying to do and like like actually\ndial it in you know and like yeah\nhowever long it takes yeah i i think\nit's it's gonna\nit's interesting because you talk about\nsort of living it up but what i'm sort\nof hearing is that\nyou're going to need every percent that\nyou can get you're going to need every\ndrop that you can get to really create\nwhat you need to create at the level\nthat you're talking about when dialing\nit in it's like you're going to need\nthat atmosphere you're going to need the\nsun you're going to need the fish you're\ngoing to need the waves you're going to\nneed it all right because it's going to\ntake everything you've got and it's\ngoing to take more so you better set\nyourself up for success\ni'm i'm i actually like haven't been\nexcited for something in a while and\nlike i'm really excited\nbecause like i finish all my shows in\ndecember 18th\nand then i'm gonna probably do christmas\nwith my family and then and then i'll\nleave but yeah it's gonna be sick i'm\ngonna have so much inspiration because\nit's so difficult to write music on tour\nbecause voice and this and that yeah so\nit's gonna be great i uh i'm excited for\nthe future cool\nyeah yeah i mean i feel like we're at a\ngood point to stop what do you think\ni'm all for it man i i really appreciate\nyou jumping on and uh allowing me to\nvent and and\nyou know i like i like hearing things\nback to me so\nyeah no i i was gonna say i really\nappreciate you coming on and explaining\nkendrick lamar to me and and a lot of\nother stuff\num but i\ni i really just love to hear about your\ncreative process and\nsort of like you know what it takes and\nwhat you've been through and how you\nmanage it\nand just\nin terms of the the picture you painted\nin my mind of of what january or\nfebruary is gonna look like all i can\nsay is like i wish you the best of luck\nand i think this is what you've been put\non this earth to do man\nso you gotta you gotta tell me my friend\nmy friend's mom talked to a medium and i\nwas like she was like can i mention your\nvoice and our or your name and i was\nlike\nsure like whatever like i love the mom\nand uh she was like\nthe medium said you're put on this\nplanet to make music\nso\nmaybe maybe she was just regulating what\nyou were going to say and uh\nyeah i i think i am i uh\nyou know it's not the best but it will\nbe so that's the goal right words to\nlive by\nyeah\nthank you very much man\noh man thank you i\nas many i ate like six halls during this\nand drank like four cups of tea so\nwe're hydrated and now i'm going to go\nget some food so thanks every time\nsounds like a plan thanks so much for\ncoming on\nbest of luck to you man\ntake care\nhave a good one\nyou"
