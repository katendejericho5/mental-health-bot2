    "transcript": "so you're here and just like you have\nmatter and energy that cannot be\ndestroyed you also have karmas that\ncannot be destroyed and that every\naction you take has consequences into\nthe future so i almost think about a\nhuman life is a thousand different karma\nkarmas spreading out into the world and\naffecting people right left center all\nover the place for a year 10 years 50\nyears it's almost like what we think of\nas the butterfly effect\nright so every time you act\nyou are\ncreating a cause that is an effect in\nsomeone else's life how do you balance\nthe learn to let go and then never let\ngo slash keep the person in your\nmemories during grief this is a great\nquestion\nso when we talk about grief\nwe tell people to learn to let go\nbut we also like say\nyou should keep the person with you\nright\nso it's kind of confusing because we\ndon't really explain this stuff\nwe just have like okay learn to let go\nbut like keep the person\ndo i keep the person in my memories do i\nkeep thinking about them or do i let\nthem go like does letting them go mean\nthat i don't think about them anymore\nlike how does this work\ni think one of the most under taught\nthings in our society is how to grieve\nmy god if we just taught everyone how to\ngrieve the world would be such a better\nplace\nso let's understand this and like we're\ngoing to dig into a little bit of\nscience here okay off the cuff\nso if you look at trauma\nthere's really interesting research on\ntrauma and one of the key discoveries\nabout trauma is that when you have a\nnegat when the human mind experiences a\nnegative event\nit tends to ruminate on that event so we\ntend to think about it so our my mind\ngoes to the past and i think about it\nover and over and over again\nthen what happens is we enter a fork in\nthe road\nand the mind will either do one of two\nthings so for the mind that heals after\nthe trauma it'll do one thing the mind\nthat fails to heal from the trauma will\ndo something else\nso the mind that fails to heal from\ntrauma will continue to ruminate in the\npast all it'll do is like think about\nthat thing in the past\nthe mind that heals\ntakes something from that and integrates\nit into the self\nso like what we see from for for trauma\nsurvivors\nis that survivors who take that negative\nthing and then like\nuse that information\nto shape themselves in the world view\ngoing forward are the ones who do well\nokay so like a really good example of\nthis is if you look at like cancer\nsurvivors\nright we even have a term for cancer\nsurvivor we don't have like you know\nthis term for like rheumatoid arthritis\nsurvivors\nor\num you know like e coli\nsurvivors or cholera survivors or things\nlike that we don't have like an\nethoscene identity around all kinds of\ndiseases\nright i'm a car accident survivor i'm an\nalcohol use survivor like\nwe don't say things like that right\nso if you look at something like trauma\nsurvivor or cancer survivor what does\nthat mean that means that these this is\nsomething that people have done for so\nlong that it's kind of become like a\nthing that people do\nwhere they take a particular negative\nexperience\nand they incorporate it into themselves\nlike looking forward into the future\nand when you do this successfully this\nis what allows you to grieve healthily\nright\nso i lost my dad many years ago\nbut there are parts of him and parts of\nhis wisdom and stuff like that that i've\ninternalized and i've taken with me and\nlike i still think about him from time\nto time\nbut a lot of that grief process goes\ninto my wiring and as it goes into my\nwiring and informs my future actions\ni've like processed that grief and like\nhe's like i take him with me right so i\nhaven't let him go completely but i\ndon't actively think about him all the\ntime\nso we know this from trauma that\nessentially when you take an experience\nand you let it sort of like become a\npart of you\nand you you you change your sort of\ninternal like view of yourself and your\nview of the world and a good example of\nthis is a cancer survivor because that\nbecomes a part of my identity right i'm\na cancer survivor now i survive cancer i\ncan manage this\nright i've lived through cancer like i\ncan handle this so if you think about\nthat sense of resilience that you get it\ncomes from taking that negative event\nand incorporating it into yourself\nand then when you look to the future it\nsort of stays with you\nwhereas people so when we talk about\nlike you know keeping a part of them\nwith us that's literally what we mean\nwhat we mean is to take their those\nmemories and experiences and\nand like you know time with that person\nand let it shape who we are now so that\nwe can move forward in the future\nnow when people get stuck in grief is\nthey're not doing any internal work here\nthey're just thinking about the person\nin the past\nright you just think about the person\nover and over and over again you're\nruminating in the past it's not\naffecting you at all\nyou're not changing who you are as a\nperson it's not informing the way that\nyou look to the future it's not giving\nyou any sort of sense of like how you\ncan live in the future\nall all you're doing is your mind is\nstuck in that rumination in the past\nso it's not a balance between forgetting\nthem and keeping them in mind it's\nactually an integration\nof those experiences into who you are\nand then you carry it with you that's\nwhat people mean like this person lives\non within us\nright like that's kind of a weird thing\nto say but like what does that actually\nmean there's actually science on this\npeople have done studies and what you\nthey've realized is when you have\nruminative thoughts and you direct them\ntowards identity formation and identity\nchange within the self that's what\nhappens that's how someone lives on\nwithin you\nthose are the steps and when people get\nstuck thinking about the person\ninstead of about themselves and how that\nperson affected them\nthat's when they get stuck in grief and\ndon't move on right i can't move on i\nhad a i fell in love once at the age of\n19 and she was perfect and it was\namazing and now 28 years later all i can\nthink about is that person that's me\nbeing stuck in the past i'm just\nruminating on that person has nothing to\ndo with me\nso what we know from trauma survivors is\nthat people who healthily incorporate\ntrauma into their life\nare the ones that do better and in terms\nof grief it's the same thing it's\nincorporating that person into your life\nand there's another interesting\nperspective on this i shouldn't say\nanother i'd say it's corollary but from\na completely different tradition\nso if you look at buddhism so buddhism\nand the buddhist belief of karma is a\nlittle bit different from the hindu\nbelief of karma\nso the hindu belief of karma is that\ni've got a soul\nand i rack up all these karmic debts and\ni people owe me karmic debts and my soul\nmoves from one body to the next\nand i carry all my debts with me right\nso when a lot of people say oh like you\ncan't carry it into the next life the\nhindus kind of disagree okay there are\ndifferent perspectives i'm kind of\nsimplifying so caveat there the buddhist\nperspective on karma is slightly\ndifferent so they do believe that things\nfrom the past from past lives will\naffect you there are things from the\npast that will affect you but you don't\ncarry your soul forward that you don't\ncarry your debts so the way that would\nthis kind of think about it is that you\nexist in this world\nand this once again is a simplification\ni'm sure that the scholars out there may\ndisagree with this\nso you're here and just like you have\nmatter and energy that cannot be\ndestroyed you also have karmas that\ncannot be destroyed and that every\naction you take has consequences into\nthe future so i almost think about a\nhuman life is a thousand different karma\nkarmas spreading out into the world and\naffecting people right left center all\nover the place\nfor a year 10 years 50 years it's almost\nlike what we think of as the butterfly\neffect\nright so every time you act\nyou are\ncreating a cause that is an effect in\nsomeone else's life and that sort of\nmakes sense like if someone's you know\nsitting down and they they trip and they\nfall and they drop all their groceries\nand you stop for a second and you help\nthem put their stuff together you've\ncreated like an impact in their life\nthere's a cause and there's an effect\nyou've like soda karmic seed which has\nsome kind of effect\nversus if i feel bad about myself i make\na smurf account and i poop on noobs all\nday in my game of choice i'm also\ncreating a karma right i'm affecting the\nlives of other people\nand so one way to think about grief\nis that that person is gone\nthat person will never be there ever\nagain\nbut it's actually kind of like\nscientifically very\neasy to say that their effects linger on\ntheir matter still exists their energy\nstill exists and even their actions like\nliterally exist right if someone leaves\nyou brief it's kind of acknowledging\nthat that person is gone but all these\nthousand actions that they've taken\nstill live within me like their impact\nstill will live within me the good and\nthe bad\nand so then the process of grieving is\nintegrating that once again it's\nacknowledging okay this person is gone\nbut they sowed all these karmic seeds\nwhich still bear fruit\nand kind of acknowledging that and that\nlike these are karmas that are left\nmaybe they left me money maybe they\ndidn't leave me money and that leaves me\nresentful\nthey said certain things to inspire me\nthey said certain things to hurt my\nfeelings they said certain things to\nemotionally scar me\nright they were not a very good parent\nand they struggled with addictions\nthemselves\nand so i'm gonna have to like let go\nthat there's ever gonna be like a parent\nin my life who was like\nyou know perfect and universally\nsupportive or even decent\nand as you work through that as you sort\nof recognize that they're gone but their\nkarmic seeds remain in this world you\ncan sort of work through that integrate\nwhatever you want to heal whatever you\nwant to and kind of like move forward\nbut that's also consistent with this\nsort of idea that integration of trauma\nand morning into the self is how people\nheal and we sort of have science behind\nthat does that make sense\nso in short\nso in short\nyou know how do you balance forgetting\nand never letting or letting go and\nnever forgetting someone by integrating\nthem into yourselves and when your mind\nis stuck and ruminating in the past\nthat's when you\nwhen you're stuck in grief\nwhen you take what that person did in\ntheir life and make it a part of you and\nchange you because of them then you\nintegrate it into yourself and then you\ncan move forward and then you've like\ngrieved in a healthy way\nzx ping\nzp ping thank you so much for this\nyou're very welcome\na lot of first time chatters today\nso krusty os asking so dr k why would\nyou want to create karmas\nthat's a great question so\nthe answer is you don't\nso this also is a little bit more from\nthe hindu tradition or leans more\ntowards the hindu tradition but the\nbuddhist may also agree it's you know\nand the traditions are not monolithic\nright so hinduism just like christianity\nand buddhism just like christianity or\nislam has like all these different sects\nwith like slightly different beliefs\nokay so i'm oversimplifying here\nbut the short answer is that the whole\npoint\nof meditation\nand this is by the way is like not\nreally disputed okay this is just\nforgotten\nbut everyone who's talking about\nmindfulness and the benefits of\nmeditation for anxiety of which we're\npart of it right because it does help\nwith anxiety but my meditation\nwas never designed to help mindfulness\nthat's not why people did it that's not\nwhy buddha taught it so anyone who's\nlike oh yeah you know like i like\nbuddhism and stuff don't ever forget\nthat the reason for meditation is\nenlightenment and what enlightenment is\nmoksha or liberation is the freedom from\nthe cycle of karma\nso the goal of all that stuff is to no\nlonger create karmas because the problem\nis that any time you create a proton you\ncreate you know anytime you have a\nneutron and you split it into a proton\nyou have to create an electron there's\nlike no way around it so the problem\nwith karma is that it's a cycle which\npeople get stuck in and everything that\nthey do to where they try to like fix\nsomething they like create an additional\nkarma\nso there's even a story about buddha who\nknows if it's true or not\nwhere after he became enlightened\nsome guy came and he's like hey i heard\nyou're enlightened and with this like\nwhatevs it's the guy's like i'd love to\nlearn from you and buddha's like okay\nsure\nso it teaches this guy for a long time\nfor years and years\nafter many years\nthe guy's still not enlightened and he\ngoes to put then he's like i've been\nstudying with you for five years and i'm\nstill not enlightened\nthen he spits in with his face\nhe's like scam artist\nand then of course like all of buddha's\ndisciples get enraged and they're like\nhow dare you to the master how dare you\nand so they're like\nyou know they're about to you know\nbeat his ass i suppose and then buddha\nrestrains him and he's like relax chill\nthe guy's like\ni'm done with you and buddha's like all\nright adios and then the\ndisciples are like why why did you let\nthat dude disrespect you bro\nwhy you gotta let him disrespect you\nlike that\nand buddha was like that's a karma that\nhe owed me\nand so\nnow like the reason i'm on this earth is\nlike i've got a bunch of accounts to\nclose out and like that one was just\nclosed out so we're kind of done with\nthat\nis that something that he owed me\nwhatever so let him let him complete\nthat guarmo we're not going to react to\nit we're just going to let him go on his\nway and i'm done i'm cleaning closing up\nshop right closing all my accounts one\nby one\nso you actually don't want to create new\nkarmas and theoretically in in the\npursuit of moocs now personally i don't\nbelieve\nthat for\nmyself and most humans\ni think when you all get to that point\nyou can sort of you know close out your\naccounts but generally speaking i think\nthat what we should do is create karmas\nwe should create positive karmas that's\nlike something that we should all work\nvery hard to do so whether that's\nplanting a tree whether that's helping\nout a friend whether that's helping\nsomeone pick up groceries that have\nfallen on the floor whether that's\nnot smurfing and playing in the bracket\nthat you deserve to play in\nright you you do what you can in this\nworld because you're only going to be\nhere for a limited amount of time so\nlike what is the state of the world when\nyou leave it so my matter will remain my\nenergy will remain and my karmas will\nremain so what kind of karmas do i want\nto give to the world like i have if i'm\njust annihilated\neven after this life and there's no\nsegment of all oak or dr k that that\nexists after this then how do i want to\nspend this life i want to try to create\nas much positivity as i can\nright i can create negativity but that's\nnot what i want to do\nso\neven\nmany many years ago i had the choice to\nbasically become a monk or not and i\nchose to live in the world and i chose\nokay like we're going to dive into this\ncycle of garmad that's a choice that i\nmake\nand so either we're going to go the\nnon-karmic route or we're going to go\nthe karmic route and i decided to go the\nkarmic route i think that's a good\nchoice to make\nbut generally speaking it's not really\nthe end game\nyou can think about karma as like side\nquests\nright it's like you can get caught up in\nside quests until the end of time\nand this is thankfully the world is a\nplace that continually generates new\nside quests and at some point we get\nkind of tired of doing side quests and\nthen you do the main quest and the game\nis over then you become you attain\nmoksha you attain liberation and you're\nkind of done\ndoes that make sense\nso some people are saying\nis this all in dr k's guide not really\num so dr k's guide has a lot of\nfoundational stuff\nso the thing about dr k's guide is that\nit's like comprehensive\nso the problem with doing this kind of\nstuff on stream is that people may have\na thousand questions which\nwe can't necessarily go into because\nwe've got other things so the\ninformation is kind of scattered all\nover the place whereas dr k's guide is\nlike much more comprehensive so if you\nlisten to this for example and you're\nlike oh that's really cool i want to\nunderstand karma better and i also want\nto understand like what's the\nrelationship between meditation and\nkarma how do i integrate those two\nthings though that kind of\ncomprehensiveness you'll find in dr k's\nguide\nright so we'll teach about karma and\nwe'll teach about meditation and we'll\nteach about developing a practice so\nit's like it's more complete and it's\nlike more linear it's not just dr k\nrandomly thinking about stuff\nfirst time chatters junior fujiwara is\nsaying dr k should i have pizza for\nlunch this is really important for me\npsychologically and spiritually i'd say\nit depends\nbut generally speaking\nunless you are absolutely going to enjoy\nit and have no regrets\nthen i would say you should not have\npizza for lunch\nso if you are having pizza to enjoy\neverything that life has to offer then\nhave the pizza\nbut\nif you are someone who regrets\nparticular choices that you make in life\nthen don't have the pizza\nbecause if you don't have the pizza\nyou'll take the first step towards\nhaving you you'll build up the ability\nto choose things that you don't want\nand the ability to choose and embrace\nthings that you don't want is the most\nimportant step to become successful\nis mastery of the self\nyou"
