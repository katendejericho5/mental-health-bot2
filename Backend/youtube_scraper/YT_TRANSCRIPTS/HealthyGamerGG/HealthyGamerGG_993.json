the person who\nfeels like they're inadequate so i see\nthis a lot when i work with medical\nstudents\nwhere no amount of work that they do is\nenough we also see this a lot in content\ncreators so if you all have watched a\nlot of our interviews and stuff with\ncontent creators you'll see that a lot\nof content creators never feel satisfied\nand so if you have like self-loathing is\nyour fuel it's like a dirty fuel right\nit's not like this green clean energy\nit's like some you know scuffed like\ncoal like dirty pollution\ngenerating but oh man it's like so sweet\nand so easy and it keeps you going right\n[Music]\nwhy is it that i always feel like i'm\nnot doing enough and i'm not getting\nenough like no matter what or how much i\nhave i don't feel satisfied and i want\nmore to the point i start hating myself\nfor not trying harder or doing more\nthis is tricky\nso sometimes we feel like we're not\ndoing enough\nand we're not getting enough\nand so we don't feel satisfied and we\nwant more right this is a really common\nexperience\nso\nwhy does this happen\nand what are the consequences of it okay\nso we're gonna get to like where this\ncomes from in a second but let's start\nby understanding that\nthis\ncognitive strategy\nleads to good material outcomes at the\ncost of suffering\nso this is a min max strategy\nto improve your outward life at the cost\nof your inner life\nright like you all see that so it's the\nperson who feels like they're inadequate\nso i see this a lot when i work with\nmedical students\nwhere no amount of work that they do is\nenough\nand so they have to like grind and do\nmore they just never feel satisfied in\nthemselves there's always someone who's\nsmarter there's always someone who's\nstudying more there's always someone\nwho's getting better grades and there's\nalways someone out there who's doing\nmore we also see this a lot in content\ncreators so if you all have watched a\nlot of our interviews and stuff with\ncontent creators you'll see that a lot\nof content creators never feel satisfied\nand so often times these are very\nsuccessful content creators and so if\nyou look at this mindset\nright which is almost like the high\nconscientiousness\nhigh neuroticism from a five factor\nmodel which is which by the way is the\ntemperament of people who are in medical\nstudents\nwhat you sort of find is that like\nit's successful right so why does this\nhappen from an evolutionary standpoint\nthe reason it happens is because it's\nsuccessful\nwe actually select for success through\nthis kind of stuff\nbecause if you're never satisfied it's\ngoing to cause you to work harder and\nlike to the point i start hating myself\nfor not trying harder or doing more\nand so if you have like self-loathing is\nyour fuel it's like a dirty fuel right\nit's not like this green clean energy\nit's like some you know scuffed like\ncoal like dirty pollution\ngenerating but oh man it's like so sweet\nand it's so easy and it keeps you going\nright\nlike you can burn down entire forests\nbut like you can just destroy all that\nnature but boy it keeps you going\nso it's like this dirty fuel that's\neasily accessible and the cool thing is\nif you kind of like think about it for a\nsecond this is a never-ending source of\nfuel\nbecause if you're never satisfied with\nyour work no matter how much you work\nyou're never going to be satisfied so\nyou're always going to work harder\nand so it's like it's like this\nnever-ending source of like toxic fuel\nthe problem is when you burn it it like\npollutes the hell out of your life in\nyour mind\nbut you're going to be successful\nright\nyou're going to be successful\nand for a lot of people that's what we\ncare about that's what we're conditioned\nto care about that's all we want is to\nbe successful\nbecause then we'll have the respect and\nwe'll have money and we'll have comfort\nwe'll have all these kinds of things so\nthe first thing to understand is that\nthis mindset is not a problem it's a\nsolution\nit's a certain way of fueling your\nproductivity and ideally like\nresults in success\nnow the problem with this is that in my\nexperience this does not actually lead\nto the best outcomes this leads to good\noutcomes but if you want to go from like\n75 productivity to like 100 productivity\nyou can't have this attitude so this\nattitude is contrary to the flow state\nyou can't attain the flow state if\nyou're beating yourself up because the\nflow state is one where you're like kind\nof peaceful and like focused on your\ntask and you're doing it for you know\nit's just a different state of\nconsciousness which if you're beating\nyourself up you're never gonna attain so\nthe next question is okay where does\nthis come from so first let's understand\nthat this is adaptive\nsecond thing is that oftentimes this too\nhas some kind of psychological root\nso when did you start feeling like you\nwere not good enough\nright so that's like really really\nimportant like when did this start where\nis the origin of this\nfeeling that i'm not good enough\nand and sometimes like you know i don't\nknow if what the ethnicity of this\nperson is or you know anything like that\nbut like we see this a lot not just i\nmean i'm gonna use a particular diaspora\nbecause that's common in the u.s but you\nknow people from all over the world\nexperience this where like you'll have a\nset of parents who are not really happy\nwith what you do\nthey'll they'll not really be happy in\nyour accomplishments\nall they really care about is\nthat you outperform everyone else so\nunless you're number one in the class\nlike that's not really that important\nlike i why can't you be like so-and-so's\nkid who plays the violin and has an a in\nmath\nand so you'll have parents who are very\nunsatisfied with you the other really\ndamaging thing about this which i think\nis even more insidious which i don't\nhear a lot of people talk about is when\nyou do achieve\nwhat do you get from your parents\nwhat you get is externally facing pride\nand what do i mean by that when you get\nan a plus and you're at the first chair\nin violin or whatever\nright and you're like president of the\nmath club\nwhat does your parent do do they say\ngood job i'm so proud of you you did so\ngood this weekend we can do whatever you\nwant to you're such a hard-working kid\nyou make me so proud no that's not what\nthey do what they do is they talk to\ntheir social circle about that right\nthey don't even like reward you it's\njust like now i have bragging rights\nso when they go and they meet their\nfriends at whatever\nlike at some party right now it's like\nnow you're the easiest kid to brag about\nand so even the reinforcement that you\nget even when you accomplish things\nlike you don't get satisfied you you get\nthat like you don't\nlike your parents aren't like good job\ni'm so proud of you\nright\nit's like the the the positive you're\nworking so hard for this\npositivity and you don't even get it\nfrom them you get like a little bit\nand instead what they do is they turn\ntheir pride to the external world and\nthey post about it and they tell their\ntheir sister who they've always had a\ncompetitive relationship with\nmy boy soon number 999\nis a plus in math club president\nviolin\nthing\nright that's where they actually put all\ntheir pride they don't put it back into\nyou and so then you're left feeling\nunsatisfied\nand then like this is like a core sort\nof thing where like\nyou're conditioned\nto think that the way to be satisfied is\nto be number one but even when you\nbecome number one or as you get close to\nnumber one or chances are you're not\nnumber one because it's really hard to\nbe number one all the time\nyou sort of feel emotionally like\nunsatisfied and then you carry that\nemotional dissatisfaction with you\nand that emotional dissatisfaction with\nwhich you carry with you because it's a\nwound from a prior like emotional\nexperience you can try to go fix it in\nthe world today but it's never going to\nget fixed because it's not the wound is\nfrom before right the hunger is from\nbefore\nand i don't know how to say this but\nlike to be blunt\nhalf the problems that we get into is\nbecause we're trying to fix things from\nour past in our present\nlike we see this all the time in in\nterms of relationships where it's like\nyou know we'll say so and so has daddy\nissues and mommy issues like we even\nunderstand that like colloquially like\nwe get this and what does that even mean\nit means that my relationship with my\nparents my dad or my mom is somehow\nsomething i'm trying to fix in this\nrelationship and then it sabotages this\nrelationship because this relationship\nhas its own problems has nothing to do\nwith mom and dad\nand then why do we call it daddy issues\nor mommy issues we don't say daddy\nissues or mommy issues in successful\nrelationships we see them in\nunsuccessful relationships why didn't\nthe relationship work out oh he had\ndaddy issues\nor he had mommy issues or she had daddy\nissues that's why the relationship\ndidn't work out and why didn't it work\nout it's because they're trying to\nthey're carrying stuff from the past\nwhich they project onto their current\nrelationship\nand so as long as you're trying to fix\nthe past in the present it ain't gonna\nwork\nand what you'll end up is like this\nwhich is not feeling satisfied and\nalways wanting more\nthere's going to be a fundamental sense\nof dissatisfaction\nbecause you can't fix the past in the\npresent just not possible\ndue to physics\ndoes that make sense\nso understand where your dissatisfaction\ncomes from the dissatisfaction clearly\ndoes not correlate with your actual\nperformance does that make sense because\nif if dissatisfaction correlated with\nyour performance if your performance\nincreased then your dissatisfaction\nshould decrease the two are completely\nindependent variables so then the\nquestion is what the hell does this\ndissatisfaction correlate with\nthe dissatisfaction correlates with a\nsense of a lack of self-worth\na lack of forgiveness\na lack of like accepting yourself for\nwhere you\nare right it comes from striving being\nconditioned to strive and always wanting\nto do better\nso it's challenging\nbut very common and very adaptive right\neven if you think about if you're like\nan immigrant like i am\nor like come from an immigrant family\nthis is the attitude that we grew up\nwith and why did we grow up with this\nattitude there's a selection bias so\neven if you look at evolution there's\nsomething called the founder effect\nwhich explains\na lack of genetic diversity so when you\nhave a group of people that when you\nhave a thousand people and a hundred of\nthem go to an island\nand they hang out there\nand they you know populate and then when\nthat population goes to a thousand what\nyou'll see is like\nan uneven amount of particular genetic\nalleles\nand why is that it's because you're kind\nof populating this with a certain set of\ntraits\nand so if you're you're in it come from\nan immigrant family why is this common\nin immigrants it's because the\nimmigrants who were dissatisfied with\ntheir situation and be beaten\nbeated\nand beat themselves up were the ones who\nsuccessfully left the country\nthey're the ones who became doctors and\nengineers and software developers and\nbusiness people and things like that\nright and then they successfully moved\nand then we see it and now we have a\nwhole culture that's like this\nbecause you have 10 successful people\nwho are dissatisfied with themselves\nmoving and then since they're\ndissatisfied they're always competing\neach other and they all have kids and\nthen they pass that competition onto you\nand then we end up like this\nyou"
