    "transcript": "inflation has gotten worse homes have\ngotten more expensive education has\ngotten more expensive and people have\nstarted to get paid relatively less\nwe're seeing higher rates of diagnosis\nof adhd of autism spectrum disorder\nmore people are dying of\nopioid overdoses than they ever have in\nthe history of the world and so the\nformula for success has changed\nin fact there is no formula for success\nand that's the hard lesson that we've\nhad to learn it's the generation of hard\nwork and family values and all these\nother things that they claim\nof good stewardship that has created the\nworld that we're born into\nand now we've grown up in this world and\nwe're graduating today so now it's our\nresponsibility and i say thank god for\nthat because if there's one generation\nwho can fix this problem it's actually\ny'all\n[Music]\nso welcome everyone\nand thank you for inviting me to be your\ncommencement speaker\nfor the graduation of the class of 2022.\nnow this may seem a little bit strange\nbecause maybe you're listening to this\ncommencement speech and you're not\nactually graduating but that's okay and\nmaybe this is a little bit strange\nbecause you are graduating but you\nalready had a different commencement\nspeaker and that's okay too\nbecause if you're a part of the class of\n2022 it's time to recognize that it's\ntime to start doing things our way\nbecause the old ways haven't really\nworked for us because let's be honest\nthe world is kind of going to right\nif we look around what we see are all\nkinds of problems\nso it can start with even the most basic\nthings like the environment we have\nglobal warming we have trawling going on\nin our oceans\nyou know the wealth inequality is\nincreasing the rich get richer and the\npoor get poorer\neven things like the information age\nwhich we'd sort of ushered in this like\ninformation age which the advent of\ntechnology\nis now becoming the misinformation age\nso so many things that we've relied on\nhave started to kind of go to hell right\nso much of what we've relied on is like\nnot really working for us anymore so\ndespite advances in healthcare we've had\na global pandemic over the last two\nyears that has\ncrippled\ntaken people's lives crippled our\neconomies\nreally questioned the way that we do\nthings and has left our mental health in\nshambles as well\nand so like stuff just isn't working\nanymore right like\nthe economy is broke the climate is\nbroke\nbroke\neven politics are getting worse and\nworse\nso like we're seeing an increased amount\nof polarization where politicians are\nlike not even representing the interests\nof the people anymore\nand so like everything seems to kind of\nbe going to hell\nand so this is where\nnormally what we used to do is we used\nto rely on institutions right so if we\nlook at something like the environment\nwho was responsible for that it's like\nsome institution was responsible for\nthat maybe a government or you know here\nin the united states we have the\nenvironmental protection agency\nright they were kind of responsible for\nthat\nand in terms of like how to manage this\nkind of stuff we used to trust\ninstitutions like schools\nright because schools were supposed to\nteach us\nhow to do things that's what we go to\nschool for\nbut schools are no longer a place of\nlearning they've become assembly lines\nat best or at worst butcher shops right\nwhere people go in\nthey and they go in bright-eyed and\nbushy-tailed and you have administrators\nand legal fees and all these kinds of\nlike educational tuition fees and stuff\nlike that where you graduate four years\nlater with a piece of paper and saddled\nwith hundreds of thousands of dollars of\ndebt\nand so our institutions aren't really\nworking for us the way that they used to\nyou know we we there used to be a\nformula for life that we could kind of\nlike follow and this is sort of what the\ngeneration before us had the generation\nbefore us\nyou know who spoke a lot about hard work\nand you know\na respect for each other and sort of\nlike putting in your dues\ni think took for granted how much they\nhad given to them when they inherited\nthe world the climate was great when\nthey inherited a world it was like an\nage of prosperity when they inherited\nthe world it was sort of like things\nwere easy you could just get a job after\ngoing to college and then you could\nsupport an entire family on a single\nincome\nbut what's happened since that is that\ninflation has gotten worse homes have\ngotten more expensive education has\ngotten more expensive and people have\nstarted to get paid relatively less\nand so it's like very easy for the\ngeneration above us to kind of say like\nyou know this is what you should do to\nsucceed and they laid out all these\nformulas for us and those formulas were\nsuccessful in their day\nbut what we've seen time and time again\nis the formulas of the past don't really\nwork for the present\nand this is the challenge that the class\nof 2022 faces which is what are you all\nsupposed to do\nright like what are we supposed to do\nnow because the formulas of the past\ndon't really work\nin in a world where you know it with the\nbirth of democracy we had this idea that\npeople could sort of cast their vote and\nhave a voice in what happens in their\nlife\nbut as we've seen all over the world\ndespite the fact that we have democratic\nnations all over the place\nthe opinions and the voice of the\nindividual person has started to matter\nless and less and less\nand so we're seeing a failure of our\ninstitutions we're seeing a failure of\nschools to educate\na failure of government to represent the\ninterests of the people we're even\nseeing a failure in the realms of of\nscientific advancement so now what used\nto happen is that schools and colleges\nand academic institutions used to be the\nbirthplace of innovation that's where\nmost of the research was done and where\nlike you know people made discoveries\nbut now what we're seeing is that\ninnovation is in the hands of business\nso we're seeing an explosion of\ntechnology in social media and academia\nis actually kind of slow to keep up\nright\nand so what we're starting to see is\nthat we've we've the the formula that\nwe've been taught\nis based on\na set of assumptions that the generation\nabove us had the generation above us had\nthis assumption that if you go to\ncollege and you get a job and you save\ndiligently\nand you invest in the stock market\nthat you'll be okay in life right they\ngave us the formula to be okay the\nproblem is that that formula relies on\ncertain assumptions which no longer\ncompute\nthis is no longer the day that you can\njust get us like a you know get a\ncollege degree and i know this sounds\nkind of despairing because some of y'all\nare graduating from college some of you\nall are about to go to college\nand so like why are we talking about\nthis because i think it's important to\nunderstand that the world that you're\nwalking into is the class of 2022 is a\nlittle bit different\nfrom\nthe world of the past\nand so the formula for success has\nchanged\nin fact there is no formula for success\nand that's the hard lesson that we've\nhad to learn which is that if you assume\nthat if i do a b and c\ni will end up okay right in a world of\nonline dating there used to sort of say\nlike okay like take care of yourself\nprioritize yourself groom yourself get\ninto shape a little bit learn how to\ncook if you do all of these things and\nyou're a decent human being you'll be\nokay\nbut that's not what the world gets us\nright because when you match with\nsomeone on an online dating app\nhalf of the times it's a bot and the\nother half of times it's someone\ndirecting you to a different website\nwhere you can pay for certain kinds of\ncontent\nand that's what's happened the rules of\nthe game have changed\nand so how do you manage this\nif you're part of the graduating class\nof 2022 right\nlike here's dr k like talking to you\nabout cynicism and despair\nand like what do we do about this right\nbecause the the formulas of the past no\nlonger seem to work\nand so it's no surprise that mental\nhealth is at an all-time low\nbecause it is so we sort of know this\nthat\nduring the pandemic depression and\nanxiety got 300 percent worse like\nliterally 300 percent worse\nwe're seeing higher rates of diagnosis\nof adhd of autism spectrum disorder\nmore people are dying of\nopioid overdoses than they ever have in\nthe history of the world\nmore people are incarcerated for\nmarijuana than they have been in the\npast\nright so so many things are are working\nagainst us like we're inheriting a world\nthat's fundamentally broken and so\nwhat's the natural\nidea here\nyou know like\nwhat do we do wha how do we how do we\nkind of deal with this because like this\nis this is what we're getting right so\nthe class of 2022 what's the world that\nyou're stepping into you're now an adult\nand you're stepping into a world where\nthe climate is going to hell the economy\nis busted\nyou may be on the brink of financial\nruin maybe you're sad maybe you're\ndespairing\nseems like absolute crap right\nwell here's the good news class of 2022\nif there is a generation that is\nequipped to deal with this\nit's actually y'all\nbecause y'all are the generation of\nmisfits y'all are the generation of meme\nlords y'all are the generation that\nadopted your diamond hands held on the\ngme and now melvin capital is going out\nof business\ny'all are the generation that has\nactually said a great big fu to the\nworld y'all are the only generation that\ncan actually fix these problems because\nthe generation of the past that grew up\nwhen the world was young and there were\nplenty of natural resources to go around\nand the world was not quite as crowded\nas it was now where you could kind of\nlike\nslide through things and kind of be okay\nthat generation couldn't do it in fact\nit's because of their\nthe way that they've shepherded the\nworld that we inherit this thing that\nthey've given us right\nit's it's the generation of hard work\nand family values and all these other\nthings that they claim\nof good stewardship\nthat has created the world that we're\nborn into\nand now we've grown up in this world and\nwe're graduating today so now it's our\nresponsibility and i say thank god for\nthat because if there's one generation\nwho can fix this problem it's actually\ny'all because y'all are the generation\nof misfits and meme lords and when it\ncomes to combating despair\nthe meme lords are the ones who will\nlead us to victory\nso this is where\nyou know i know it sounds kind of weird\nbut i think we can actually do this\nbecause things are actually a little bit\ndifferent from what we expected\nwe're the generation for whom we were\ngiven a formula that doesn't work and\nthat's actually totally fine because in\norder to fix this world it's not going\nto be following a formula it's going to\nbe\ninnovation it's going to be creativity\nand we're the generation that has the\nhighest number of entrepreneurs the most\ncontent creators you can be an artist\nand get your music on soundcloud you can\nbe an author and you can get published\non amazon\nyou can be a solo developer and get a\ngame published on steam so this is the\nthe one time in the world where the\nbarriers that have restrained our\nindividual abilities and creativity are\nactually at an all-time low we are\nliterally no longer restrained by\ngeography we're the first generation of\npeople who is literally not restrained\nby the concept of space\nyou can now make a friend across the\nglobe you can now work in a completely\ndifferent state or country for that\nmatter\nwe're not restrained our options for\ncommunication are unparalleled\nour options for connection are\nunparalleled even the resources that we\nhave at our fingertips are now like\ncompletely mind-boggling so you can pay\nfor a phd education or you can watch\nsome phd mathematician from india's\nyoutube channel and get the same damn\nthing there is a phd education at your\nfingertips you can learn how to code you\ncan learn how to cook you can even learn\nhow to build like brick houses\nand all of this information is at your\nfingertips we have resources like khan\nacademy which will outperform\nany teacher that you actually have who's\nburnt out and ground to dust in a system\nthat does not allow them to be educators\nright so the world is kind of going to\nhell\nbut\nbut\nwe have a an unprecedented amount of\npower and information at our fingertips\nthe challenge is that in the past we've\nalways been told that the road to\nsuccess is to do a b c and d right\nthe the the the formula we were given is\nessentially quest markers for life\nand if you played video games nowaday\nyou know that there's like they they\nhold your hand right they lead you okay\nhere's the first exclamation point go\nthere then go there then go there then\ngo there and then the quest is finished\nand you get your award\nthat's what the generation above us had\nwe don't have that anymore we're now\nplaying in an open world sandbox game\nwhere you can go wherever you want to\nand you can do whatever you want to you\ncan learn quantum mechanics online or\nyou can sit there and write erotic\ndinosaur space fan fiction if you care\nto\nyou can do anything that you want to in\nthis world in a way that human beings\nhave never been able to do\nand that's kind of mind-boggling and\nit's actually like\ndevastating because how do we manage\nthis right\nbecause in the past this is the subtle\nthing that we need to understand if\nyou're part of the class of 2022\nwhich is that we've grown up with the\nassumption that a formula works\nbut if you really want to take advantage\nof the world that we live in if you\nreally want to succeed in the world that\nwe live in\nthen you can't\nfollow a formula you have to find your\nown way in life\nand the good news is that you have so\nmany resources at your disposal that you\nmay actually be able to solve the\nworld's problems\nin in my own small way it was probably\ninsignificant in the grand scheme of\nthings\ni showed up on twitch and i was like you\nknow what maybe i can help some people\nwith their mental health\nand this was something that even now\nmost of my colleagues don't really\nunderstand what i'm doing\nright people will even criticize it\nwe'll see with was dr k doing something\ngood or is dr k doing something bad\nthe point is i've been able to do it now\nin a way that has not been possible and\nso if i can have such a small impact on\nmental health imagine what you're\ncapable of\nright because you could create\nthe book that inspires people to fix the\nenvironment\nyou could make the game that keeps\nsomeone from committing suicide you\ncould develop the api that\nfosters connection and allows people to\nno longer feel\nlonely and alone\nin a day and age where we we're\nstruggling with diseases of\ndisconnection\nright so you could create the sa the\nsong that inspires someone else\nto go and do something amazing\nyou can do actually all of these things\nbut it's really easy to fall into\ndespair right it's really easy to look\ninto the future and say like we don't\nknow what's going to happen it's really\neasy to look into the future and\nactually say that the sand and the\nhourglass is running out like literally\nour planet could very well be dying it\nmay not be able to sustain life anymore\nin 50 years 100 years 200 years this is\na fear\nthe sand and the hourglass is running\nout\nand so that should drive us into panic\nand it generally does\nbut this is where once again if i have\nfaith in a single generation to fix this\nproblem it's y'all because even though\nthe sand and the hourglass is running\nout we're a generation of serial\nprocrastinators and we work our best\nwhen\nyou know the deadline is tomorrow\nand so this is the problem is that like\nif the sand in the hourglass is running\nout like we're the ones that i want to\nbe in the helm because if someone can do\nit it's this state of last-minute panic\nwhich y'all thrive in which is actually\ngoing to be what saves this place\nand this is a generation that\ndoesn't want to play by the rules which\nis actually fantastic because the game\nis rigged\nright so we are actually what the world\nneeds\nwe're exactly what the world needs but\nit's hard to not give into despair\nso i'd love to share with you all a\ncouple of very practical tips\nabout how to move forward\nthe first is\ntake care of yourself\nbecause the world has shown us that\nthey're not going to take care of you\nand it's really sad and we can kind of\ntalk and we can go\noh it's so sad\nbut the truth is you've got to take care\nof yourself because it's unclear that\nanyone else actually will\nand it's a devastating responsibility\nand it's heartbreaking but it's the\nabsolute truth\nso take care of yourselves whether that\nmeans seeking mental health support\nwhether that means looking out for your\nown financial future whether that means\nsetting limits on a boss or a family\nmember\nwhatever boundaries you need to draw to\ntake care of yourself is something that\nyou should absolutely do\nthe second thing that you need to be\ncareful about or the second piece of\nadvice that i'd give you is don't give\nin to despair and don't give in to\ncynicism\nwe live in a world now where technology\nactually propagates\nthe most emotionally despairing content\nthe most devastating stuff in the world\nis what gets filtered to the top of our\nnews feed\nright either that or memes\nand so be super careful about what kind\nof personal environmentalism you\npractice\nwhere is your despair coming from what\ndo you actually consume on a daily basis\nwe've known for a long time about the\nbenefits of like a healthy diet but what\nabout a healthy mental diet\nso be very careful about what you\nconsume on a day-to-day basis it can be\nvery very tempting to\ngo down the rabbit hole of an echo\nchamber it can be very very tempting to\ngo to the radical portions the dark\nportions of the internet where everyone\nagrees with what you agree with\nbut the good news is that this\ngeneration is the most skeptical right\nwe have no respect for the generation\nabove us\nmay have worked for you okay boomer so\ntrust in that piece of yourself\nand don't\nlet yourself be a victim to all of the\ninfluences of social media so be very\nvery careful about what you consume on a\ndaily basis because if you aren't the\nroad to despair is something that you're\ngoing to have you know a one-way ticket\ndown so be very careful about how you\nspend your time who you spend your time\nwith and what kind of media you consume\nthe third thing to think a little bit\nabout\nis\nthat if you believe in something in this\nworld\nrun with it\nso this is where\nthis is the generation that i've seen\nthat it's actually dreamed the biggest\nbecause we've seen that success is\nactually possible\nright there are kids that you know grew\nup watching video games and have said\nthat i want to play this video game as a\ncareer and that's actually possible\nwe have people who have wanted to write\nbooks and have sat down and actually\nwritten books and published them and\nbecome best-selling author\nwe even have you know different kinds of\nmusical artists that stream on twitch\nthat started small and blew up\nso dream big class of 2022 because this\nis the one chance that you're gonna have\nthis is the one generation that is going\nto have the most the best actual options\nof letting your dream come true\nand this is something that's very easy\nto not realize\nwhen we look to things like social media\nand stuff like that and we'd see like\nsigns of despair and ruin everywhere\nthe problem is that the successes rarely\nrise to the top\nbut it's my firm belief that you should\nfirst and foremost dream big\nbecause things that you'll be capable of\nin this world like you have no idea we\nhave single people who have made video\ngames right like from start to finish\nthe graphics the music the level design\neverything has been made by a single\nperson\nyou now have tools at your fingertips to\ndrag and drop rpgs right there's rpg\nmaker and you can just like literally\nmake an rpg\nthere's so much stuff at your disposal\nthat if you're not careful\nabout what influences you have on your\nmind will lead you to despair\nbut this is the most creative generation\never\nthis is the generation that actually has\nthe option for a creative outlet to\naffect the rest of the world\nand the last thing that i'd say\nis don't give up your personal\nresponsibility\nso this is where if we listen to the\nvoice of despair what it manifests in a\ncouple of different ways it puts on a\nfew different masks\nso the voice of despair will say things\nlike it's not enough\nor it'll say things like\nit won't matter\nor it'll say things like don't bother\nbut be very careful about that voice of\ndespair\nbecause if you give in to that voice\nit'll become a self-fulfilling prophecy\nand the world has become the way that it\nhas because people have given up on\nstewardship\nright they've said someone else is going\nto fix it oh it doesn't matter\nsomeone else will fix it we'll figure\nsomething out we'll develop some new\ntechnology to fight climate change\nyou know other people oh the government\nwill take care of them if we sort of\nlike gamble their pension money away\nit's a lack of stewardship that has got\nus into this problem and this is when\nwhen the human mind sees a problem of\ncatastrophic size\nit automatically says don't bother or it\nwon't be enough\nbut this is the truth of the matter\nis that no snowflake believes it's\nresponsible for the avalanche\nright it's a handful of posts on wall\nstreet bets\nin which someone said\nsomeone is short selling gamestop\nand i'm gonna buy it and i think i\nshould hold it and then other people\njoin in and they buy and they hold\nand suddenly like this is a thing\nsomeone showed up one day and it's like\ni'm gonna stream a video game and then\nsomeone else started doing it and then\nsomeone else started doing it and now\nand then twitch was born\nand someone was like i really like\nplaying video games i'm gonna compete\ni'm gonna be the best gamer in this\nsport in the world and then someone else\nsaid the same thing and a third person\nsaid it and a fourth person said it and\nthus was esports born\nso don't underestimate what you're\nactually capable of don't underestimate\nwhat the power of personal stewardship\ncan accomplish\nso you can look at a problem like\nclimate change and you can say i can't\nfix that it's that kind of attitude that\nhas gotten into this place and\ngotten us into this mess in the first\nplace\nyou may not be able to fix climate\nchange but you know what you can\nabsolutely do is plant a tree you know\nwhat you can absolutely do is post that\non social media\nplant a tree\nright you may look to the world and you\nsay oh my god mental health is at an\nall-time low\nsuicidality suicidal thinking is at an\nall-time high depression has gotten\nworse anxiety has gotten worse oh my god\neverything is so full of despair\nand\nyou can actually support\nsomeone around you\nyou can have a conversation on discord\nyou can talk to a friend\nyou can support someone\nright you can respond to someone's cry\nfor help\nin this empty empty barren wasteland\nnose known as the internet and you'd be\namazed at what you're capable of\nso part of the problem is that we're all\nconfused by this bias\nof big problems with big solutions\nbecause what do we see what gets what's\nfloats to the top of our news feeds and\nour social media feeds this person has\nbeen planting trees for 28 years and has\nplanted 10 000 trees and you look at\nthat and you say i can't do that i'm\nlazy i can't play plant 10 000 trees so\ndon't even bother planting a single one\nso don't underestimate what you're\ncapable of because at the end of the day\nin this world there's only one thing\nthat you can control\nthere's only one thing that you are\nultimately responsible for and that's\nyourself\nand it's because we we're a generation\nwho has been led to believe\nthat we are insignificant\nwe've been led to believe that our voice\ndoesn't matter we've been led to believe\nthat the deck has stacked against us\nand the moment that we accept that the\nmoment that we believe\nthat the deck is stacked against us and\nthere's no point in trying\nthat's the moment at which we lose the\nbattle\nthat's the moment\nthat we lose the war\nso don't give up despite all the\nnegative stuff because this is seriously\nlike this is an unprecedented time in\nhumanity where geography is no longer a\nthing not a big deal\nright you can move to a different part\nof the country\nfind a small place to live\nand work remotely like that's pretty\ncool\nyou can write books you can create music\nyou can do all kinds of things you can\nlearn how to code on the internet you\ncan learn how to cook on the internet\nyou can learn how to do so many things\nso many people learn to play instruments\nand learn to break\nbake bread during the pandemic\nso don't give up on yourself\nbecause ultimately that's going to be\nwhat results\nin the world going to hell\nso at the end of the day\nthere's a lot wrong with the world right\nthe economy is a mess we're seeing\nunprecedented levels of inflation you've\ngot some guy in a tux talking to you\nin 2022 giving you a commencement speech\neven though you may have never invited\nhim to do that\nthe world is a weird place\nright health care is all screwed up\nwe're seeing wealth inequality we're\nseeing polarization of like political\nviews no one actually like cares to talk\nabout politics anymore it's just\nslamming each other on twitter time and\ntime and time again\nthe climate is going to hell the economy\nis going to hell politics is going to\nhell even gaming is going to hell have\nyou all seen micro transactions my\ngoodness\nwho's going to fix this stuff\nthe answer is you\nyou're the only one who can't\nand like why do i believe that you\nalready the mental health is so bad oh\nkids don't want to work nowadays you're\ndamn right it's because kids don't want\nto work that they'll find the most\nefficient solutions\nlaziest generation yeah that's that's\nwho i'm going to put my money on because\nif this is the laziest generation the\nhardest working generation is the one\nthat got us here\nso laziness is going to be our way\nforward\nyou don't want to work 40 hours a week\nfantastic figure out how to fix the\nworld in 20.\nso you're the generation that's gonna do\nit you're the generation that's the most\nskeptical you don't accept things that\nare told to you you don't accept the\nformula we've even sort of\nyou know stepped away from religion\nwhich terrifies a lot of people\nbecause we've learned how to think for\nourselves\nso that's good because like them\nthinking for us is not working\nright\nwe're a generation that is so sad\nand thank god we have memes\nbecause memes are going to be the only\nthing that we can use to fight cynicism\nand despair\nwe have ways of communication and the\nlast and\ncertainly not least\nis time is running out\nbut we are at our best when we\nprocrastinate\nso the world is going in the wrong\ndirection\nand who can turn it around\nyou all can class of 2022.\nso congratulations\nand now it's time to get to work\nthank you very much"
