    "transcript": "the problem with obsessive thoughts is\nthat we get caught up in them right we\nstart to think that our mind is correct\nwe start to think that our thoughts are\nfacts and so oftentimes what i do when\ni'm working with people who have\nobsessive thoughts is that they can sort\nof with detachment learn to accept that\ntheir mind produces obsessive thoughts\nand so the solution there is to detach\nfrom our mind and just acknowledge that\nlike there's a difference between i want\na hamburger\nand my body wants a hamburger or my mind\nwants a hamburger it's fine for your\nmind to produce these thoughts the\nquestion is do you want to act in\naccordance with the thoughts that your\nmind produces yes or no and that applies\nfor delusions it applies for anxiety it\napplies for insecurity\nthat your actions and how you behave\ndoes not have to be in accordance with\nthose thoughts\n[Music]\nacceptance versus learned helplessness\nhow can one distinguish between the two\nyeah so this is a it's a good question\nso a lot of people will wonder a little\nbit about okay what's the difference\nbetween acceptance and learned\nhelplessness\nso let's kind of talk about this for a\nminute uh some time ago some\npsychologists\nreally coined a very interesting concept\nwhich is learned helplessness\nand learn helplessness is this idea that\nover time you learn to be helpless\nso generally speaking when we face\nchallenges it is the natural human\nresponse to try to overcome that\nchallenge and like succeed in some way\nso in the face of adversity we're going\nto rise up to the challenge and we're\ngoing to learn how to beat it\nwhat's happened though is that some\npeople learn over time that like there's\nno way to win so we'll see this in cases\nof like complex ptsd\nor cptsd we'll see this in a lot of\nother cases of abuse or trauma or things\nlike that where you kind of learn that\nresistance is futile right\nand so often times you'll see this in\ncases of like you know domineering\nparents or things like that where like\nyou're you sort of get divested of your\nown power and your own agency and so\nthen when you get faced with a challenge\nwhat happens is instead of trying to\nrise above the challenge and address the\nchallenge and things like that\nwhat you end up doing is\num\njust\ngiving up\nright and so what what happens with\npeople with learned helplessness is that\nthey learn to give up very very easily\nand so if something doesn't work right\naway you just kind of like you sort of\ngive up\nand now recently what's sort of happened\nis there's been a big push for something\ncalled acceptance so even in um you know\nin in like psychotherapy for example\nthere's a kind of therapy called\nacceptance and commitment therapy or act\nwhich is sort of rooted originally in\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nand then what they sprinkle in is this\neastern concept of acceptance which is\nthat you have to like accept what's\nhappened in life\nas opposed to focus on changing it\nand and it's kind of interesting right\nso like\nthe the weird thing there is that if we\nsort of accept\nwhat happens in life instead of trying\nto change it\nthen don't we sort of end up in the same\nplace as learned helplessness which is\nlike we're just gonna let it kind of\nhappen\nand so this is a really common question\nand can be quite confusing right so if i\naccept something\nhow does that help isn't that the same\nas not doing anything about it\nand it's a good question but in my\nexperience actually quite the opposite\nso the first is that we can look at\nstudies on things like acceptance and\ncommitment therapy or act\nand what we find is that those studies\nare very very\npotent at revealing that sort of this\nacceptance philosophy can lead to good\nclinical outcomes\nso act is oftentimes used in addiction\nkind of scenarios and we sort of see\nthis historically as well so if you look\nat alcoholics anonymous which is a you\nknow historically effective\norganization and helping people overcome\naddiction\nkind of the first rule of of alcoholics\nanonymous is you know you go up and you\nsay hi my name is all look i'm an\nalcoholic\nand so it's kind of weird because if\nyou're sort of like admitting defeat\nthere right if you're saying i'm an\nalcoholic period\nthen doesn't that mean that you're gonna\ndrink and paradoxically the answer is no\nparadoxically what happens when you\naccept is it actually allows you to gain\ncontrol over the behavior so let's kind\nof go into this for a second so\noftentimes what happens in in addiction\nand this is what sort of act posits\nis that it's our ability to like it's\nit's our attempts to resist\nthe addiction\nthat actually\ncause us the most problems\nand so by accepting the fact that we're\naddicted\nonce you sort of\naccept that foundation then suddenly you\ncan actually like gain power over it\nwhich i know sounds really paradoxical\nbecause if you accept that you're\npowerless in the face of alcohol which\nis what aa espouses then how on earth do\nyou get control over it and that's kind\nof weird but that's sort of how it works\nwe just sort of know that from a data\nperspective and i'll try to explain a\nlittle bit of my understanding of how\nthat works\nso as long as\ni can win against alcohol the addict's\nbrain is gonna like have a field day\nwith that and if you look at people who\nstruggle with addictions\noftentimes what you find is this sense\nthat i can win right i can manage it i\ncan fix it i can reduce it i can control\nit\nbut the problem is that all of those\nthoughts of like okay i can manage it as\nlong as i don't get a dui\ndrinking is fine as long as i don't\ndrive drunk\ndrinking is fine as long as dot dot dot\nplaying games is fine as long as long as\ndot dot dot\nyou know\ni can get high as long as dot dot dot\nright\nthat stuff doesn't apply to me like i am\nin control\nthe problem is that when you have that\nthought in your head that i am in\ncontrol or i can gain control\noftentimes that is the thought that your\naddiction\nthrives on\nthat's what it uses because it tells you\nbecause it knows that it's actually in\ncontrol the only way that the addiction\ncan guarantee success is if it can\nconvince you that you are in control and\nso this kind of goes to almost like this\nsaying that you know the greatest trick\nthe devil ever pulled was convincing the\nworld he didn't exist\nright so as long as your addiction\ncan convince you that you're in control\nand that you can handle it you're going\nto keep using\nand we sort of see that right we see\nthat people who insist on getting in\ncontrol like\nyou know like they're the ones who end\nup in the biggest problems and so what\nalcoholics anonymous sort of realized\nlike what the original person the guy\nwho wrote the big book i forget his name\nwhat he kind of realized is like the\nfirst step is admitting that you're\ngonna lose\nand interestingly enough by admitting\nthat you're going to lose\nall of the tactics that your addiction\nuses the trump card that your addiction\nactually plays\nit's like secret weapon that you you\ndon't even know that it's using it right\nlike it's actually you think you're\nusing it but it's using you it's\ncontrolling you\nso what you're actually doing is taking\naway the trump card by sort of saying hi\nmy name is olok i'm an alcoholic and i'm\npowerless in the face of alcohol because\nif you're powerless in the face of\nalcohol like going to the barbecue\nyou're not going to be able to resist so\ndon't go to the barbecue if you're\npowerless in the face of alcohol it\ndoesn't matter whether you can control\nit or not control it i got to go to the\nmeeting every single day\nthat's what it takes\nhave any shot of any kind of success\nand and failure is kind of around the\ncorner\nand so this is sort of what what a ace\nkind of discovered with with\nacceptance\naaa has some problems with it i think\ngenerally speaking\nand so you know there are certain\nadaptations which there's certain things\nabout aaa that don't fit with people\nwhich i think makes a lot of sense\nso i personally think that aaa is a\nlittle bit too disempowering\nlike i think it's better to understand\nthe trick that your mind does then\nassume that you're actually powerless\nbecause i think you are powerful you are\nin control as long as your mind\nisn't tricking you\nand so that's the attitude that i take\nso i think there are a lot of issues\nwith aaa\nand also it doesn't work for everyone\nright\nso then\nthis even it so what then what happened\nis people took this\na kind of uh\nability of acceptance and then they\napplied it to acceptance and commitment\ntherapy and they removed a lot of the\nbad stuff from aa and they kind of\napplied it to act act as an\nevidence-based treatment for addiction\nso that works really well so then the\nquestion kind of becomes okay like let's\ntalk about you for a moment and\nacceptance versus learned helplessness\nand what's the difference\nso learned helplessness is about the\nfuture\nright so if we think about it very\nsimply\nin learned helplessness i am here now\nand there is no point in trying because\nof something in the future\ni realize that that looks weird\nin the wrong direction it's like you\nknow we're looking into the future and\nthere's no point in trying because it's\nnot going to work\nso learn helplessness is\nforward thinking in its nature it's like\nlooking into the future and saying\nthere's no point in trying now\nthe interesting thing about acceptance\nis acceptance brings you to the present\nso acceptance is how you get out of the\nfuture and especially out of the past so\na lot of times what will happen\nis you know until you accept what has\nhappened to you you're kind of stuck in\nthe past you're like\nengaged in contrafactual thinking which\ni don't know if you all remember we\ntalked about but our mind has this\nability to go back into the past\nand hypothesize a different set of\noutcomes if only i had dot dot dot\nso when you're struggling in the present\nsometimes what the mind does it goes\ninto the past and starts thinking if\nonly i had dot dot dot if only i'd\nstudied harder if i only i had taken\nclasses seriously if only i hadn't dated\nthis person if only i hadn't done this\nthis this then i wouldn't be in this\nscenario right now\nand so what your mind actually spends\nits time doing is instead of focusing on\nthe present focusing on\nwhat you can do to get out of this\nall it thinks about is what you should\nhave done differently to avoid the\nsituation which if you think about it as\ncognitive energy that will never help\nyou because you can't actually go back\ninto time\nit's like all of your problem solving\nenergy\nis going to rewrite the past which is\nphysically impossible instead of trying\nto figure out what to do in the present\nso this is where acceptance comes in so\nacceptance sort of takes all that crap\nfrom the past\nand then sort of sorry this way\ntakes all that crap from the past\nand then kind of like lets it all go and\nthen you kind of accept where you are\nnow right so if i accept i'll say but i\ni did i didn't take it seriously right\ni did end up dating that person or in\nthe case of something like grief like\nthat person did pass away right i did\nlose a loved one and that i have to\naccept that because until you accept\nthat you're kind of stuck in that past\nif only i'd done this if only i'd done\nthis if only i'd done this and that's\npart of the grieving process so we also\nknow that the grieving process involves\nacceptance and that's generally speaking\nis a healthy thing to go through so when\nyou actually accept what it helps you do\nis sit in the present\nand then actually look forward to the\nfuture in a positive way whereas learned\nhelplessness is all about making an\nassumption about the future that makes\nyou\nnot act today\nand this is what's really confusing\nabout acceptance is a lot of people\nthink okay if i accept that i failed out\nof college\ndoes that doesn't that mean that i don't\ndo anything no actually the opposite so\nwhen you accept that you failed college\nokay here i am now i failed out of\ncollege what am i going to do about it\nwhere do i go from here and generally\nspeaking when you lean into acceptance\nand you learn how to accept you accept\nyour present circumstances and then\nthere's a natural tendency to start like\nlooking to the future in sort of a\npositive way but even looking at the\nfuture is not about looking out here\nit's about okay what can i do now what's\nthe first step that i can take that'll\nhelp me like put my life together and\nthat's what acceptance entails\nso acceptance just helps us move to the\npresent\nhelps us get out of the past because as\nlong as we're stuck in the past it's\ngoing to be really hard to act\nand the problem with learned\nhelplessness is that's when we're stuck\nin the future and we assume that any\naction that we take is not going to be\nsuccessful\nbut just because i accept\nthat\nin the past i have failed does not mean\nthat i'm going to continue to fail\nright and this is what what confuses a\nlot of people is they assume that okay\nif you accept that you are a failure no\nthat's not what you accept\nright i am a failure is actually learned\nhelplessness\nwhat you accept is that you have failed\nperiod\nand that if you had done things\ndifferently sure you could have changed\nstuff\nbut you can still do things differently\nnow right you still have a choice now\nand how you choose to live the next day\nof your life the next hour of your life\nthe next month of your life is still up\nto you and under your control and that\ncomes through acceptance\nso a lot of this stuff is like all about\ndeveloping a present focus and this is\nwhat yoga essentially discovered all\nthis stuff is rooted in yoga all this\nmindfulness stuff dbt act it's all\nrooted in yoga\nand i'm pretty sure that's a\nhistorically accurate statement\nyou know\num\ni\ni imagine i'm biased there but also it\nseems like it's pretty historically\naccurate\nso if you kind of look at that like this\npresent focused stuff\nis what's really really powerful in\nterms of putting your life together and\ngenerally speaking when people accept\nit helps them put their life together\nwhereas learned helplessness is kind of\nlike a strategy to avoid pain\nthrough avoiding effort\nso\nsince i'm gonna fail i might as well not\ntry and then like at least i won't i'll\nprotect myself from the disappointment\nof hope\nbecause\nthat's what really happens in learned\nhelplessness is that you learn over time\nthat hoping and failing is painful so\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to\nlike shoot for like neutral and we're\ngoing to shoot for numbness\nand by shooting for numbness and not\ntrying to achieve anything like we\nprotect ourselves from disappointment\nand the feeling of failure can\nacceptance be used with obsessive\nthoughts how do i use it great question\nthat's why i love yoga\nso what yoga would say is accept that\nyou have obsessive thoughts right it\ndoesn't mean that you have to\nagree with the thoughts\nbut you can accept that your mind is\nobsessed with something\nyou could say this is just the way that\nmy mind is right so like\nsometimes if you've got an old war\ninjury\nand when the weather gets cold your war\ninjury aches\nthat's just what it's going to do when\nthe weather gets cold when it gets damp\nmy bones ache\nand is that unfortunate sure does it\ncause you some degree of pain absolutely\ndoes it suck for you yes and you can\njust kind of accept it\nand so often times what i do when i'm\nworking with people who have obsessive\nthoughts is that they can sort of with\ndetachment learn to accept that their\nmind produces obsessive thoughts and by\ndoing that what you actually do the\nproblem with obsessive thoughts is that\nwe get caught up in them right we start\nto think that our mind is correct we\nstart to think that our thoughts are\nfacts\nthis is in cognitive behavioral therapy\nwhat's called thought fusion\nin yoga it's called attachment\nand so the the solution there is to\ndetach from our mind and just\nacknowledge that like there's a\ndifference between i want a hamburger\nand my body wants a hamburger or my mind\nwants a hamburger\nright there's some distance that you can\ngain from\nand especially when i work with people\nwho are psychotic that works very well\ndelusional and it's like i'm i have no\nidea whether you're correct or incorrect\nwith your delusions it's not my place to\nsay i'm not the arbiter of truth\nit's fine for your mind to produce these\nthoughts the question is do you want to\nact in accordance with the thoughts that\nyour mind produces yes or no and that\napplies for delusions it applies for\nanxiety it applies for insecurity that\nyour actions and how you behave does not\nhave to be in accordance with those\nthoughts\nyou know when i work with people who are\ndelusional\nwhat they tend to discover is like that\nworks really well\nif they practice it and they give it a\nshot\nand they may sometimes feel terrified if\nthey think the fbi is watching them it's\nlike you can't convince them by nature\nof their illness that their fbi fbi\nisn't watching them i can't give them\nproof and who knows like maybe the fbi\nis watching them\ni actually had one case of someone that\nwas actually\nbeing followed by the fbi as it turns\nout\nso you have no idea\num what's going on\nit's it's bizarre i know\nso but but the point is like like the\nquestion at least you know when i'm\nworking with a patient like that is like\ndo you want to keep the fbi watching you\nfrom leaving your house it's like if you\nleave the hou like forget about whether\nthe fbi is watching you or not do you\nwant to leave the house or not well i\nhate being at home\nwell like do they watch you at home\nthey're like yeah right so then go out\nanyway like if they're watching you\nmight as well go to a park and hang out\nand have a good time and then eventually\nsomeone's like oh okay i'll try that and\ni'll be like how'd that go going to the\npark and they're like well yeah you're\nright the fbi followed me that's like\ni'm not sure i ever said that\nbut you know at least i had a good time\ni was like cool\nso you can do it again this week they're\nlike yeah i'm thinking about going out\nagain this week that's great\nright so you can detach from your\nthoughts\nand that's very possible\nit's it's hard don't get me wrong it's\nnot easy it takes effort and this is\nwhere things like practices like\nmeditation even doing things like\npsychotherapy can be very helpful\num\nbut you can absolutely detach from them\nhow do you avoid falling from detachment\ninto apathy the two are completely\ndifferent\nokay\nso this is the big problem that people\nhave with acceptance they think that\nacceptance means apathy apathy is\nactually in the learned helplessness\nright so if we think about apathy i\ndon't care there's no point in trying\nthat's apathy\ndetachment is not not caring\nit's acknowledging you can still want\nthings and be detached\nthe the difference is acknowledging that\nthings are kind of like out of your\ncontrol\nso i can want\nto go on a date with someone\nbut i also don't have to be attached to\nit it's like yeah it'd be great if this\nhappened\ni'd really enjoy it i'm really looking\nforward to it and at the end of the day\nthere are a thousand reasons why why it\nmay not happen and if one of those\nthings comes to pass so be it right like\nlife is the kind of situation where you\ndon't get everything that you want\nand then if you go in to learn\nhelplessness or apathy so then why\nbother trying no no that's where you\ncross the line\nright so this person\ndidn't want to go on a date with me\nwhich is okay am i disappointed sure\nit would have been awesome if they were\nwilling to give me a shot\nand there are other fish in the sea\nright so i don't have to let it get me\ndown\ni can try again\nlots of different options out there i\ncan also have a fruitful weekend if this\nperson if i'm not gonna go on a date\nwith this weekend i can go hang out with\nmy friends i can play some dnd\nyou know i can do all kinds of stuff so\nthat's where detachment comes in\ndetachment isn't about not enjoying life\nor being numb it's about letting go of\nthe outcomes of your actions and\nactually fully devoting yourself to the\naction itself\nand this is where like even when i work\nwith medical students a lot of medical\nstudents are very interested in getting\na's because that's what they've been\nconditioned to do their entire life\nmiddle school a's high school a's\ncollege a's applying to med school i've\ngot a 3.98 gpa an and\nare they so resentful it's not a 4.0\nand then they wind up in med school\nand eventually i have to like have a\nconversation with them about your grades\ndon't matter i don't think you get it\na few years from now like you're gonna\nbe in an elevator and someone's gonna\nhave a heart attack are you gonna be\nable to save that person's life or not\nwho the hell cares whether you get an a\nor not i don't think you understand\nyou're here to learn medicine so learn\nmedicine and forget about the grade\nrecognize that what we're teaching you\nwill either save lives or\nyou won't learn it well enough and you\nmay not be able to save that life\nthat's what you should focus on\nso focus on the learning not the outcome\nand the med students who get that do\nreally well\nparadoxically once again\nright because then they focus on\nlearning the material which tends to\ntranslate into doing well on the tests\nbut they're learning the material for\nthe sake of learning the material\nand so it's that same kind of thing it's\nreally tricky it's subtle but detachment\nand apathy are\nthe opposite\napathy is not caring in the sense of\nlike\nnumbing yourself whereas detachment is\nabout acknowledging that there's only so\nmuch that you can do and then actually\ngiving it your all because usually\npeople who are detached can\ngive it their all\nbecause once you free yourself from all\nthe shame and all the other crap then\nyou can just focus on the thing\nright i can ask this person out and it's\nbecause i'm looking for a relationship\nand like i'm going to give everything\nthat i can to this relationship and if\nit didn't work out it didn't work out so\nbe it\ni can't control another person's\nbehavior\ni can't control the circumstances of\ntheir life but i gave it everything i\ncould and the next time around i'm gonna\ndo the same damn thing\nso detachment paradoxically allows you\nto live life with the opposite of apathy\nand it sort of protects you against a\nlot of the suffering how do you know if\nyou are avoiding the emotion by being in\nthe present like rationalizing\nso\nthat's a great question\nuh rationalizing is not being in the\npresent first of all so rationalizing is\navoiding the emotion so what's happening\nin rationalizing is the emotion is\nfueling a rationalization that allows\nyou to discount the emotion\nbeing in the present is usually sitting\nwith the emotion\nso it's not being in the present and\navoiding emotion are not\nthose are mutually exclusive\nthe whole point of being in the present\nis you're there with whatever's there\navoidance of emotion is about moving\naway from the present right like does\nthat make sense\nbecause i'm feeling sad right now and i\nwant to avoid that emotion i'm not being\nin the present the whole point is\navoidance like this is what it is and\ni'm like moving away from that that's\nwhere rationalizing comes in and you\ncan't avoid the present\nin fact\nmoving into the future and moving into\nthe past are the ways that you avoid the\npresent like\ndoes that make sense it's like so simple\nbut like you can't be in the present and\nthe future at the same time that's what\nyour mind does\nthat's why we engage in contrafactual\nthinking which is going back in time and\nrewriting history\nbecause we're avoiding the present\nthat's why we think about the future\nthat's why we\nyou know have daydreams like maladaptive\ndaydreaming that's also why we are\nhopeless about the future\nbecause the interesting thing is if i'm\nhopeless about the future\nit gives me a free pass in the present i\ndon't have to do anything right now\nyou ever think about that\nright it's kind of weird\nbut you have a pass for doing nothing in\nthe present\nright so if i'm\ndoomed to be alone forever because the\nopposite sex or whatever sex i'm\nattracted to\nis all shallow and and useless and all\nthey care about are things that i don't\nhave\nthen\nif it's futile then i don't have to do\nanything\nright all i get to do is [ __ ] at people\non twitter all day long about how unfair\nthe world is instead of actually doing\nanything to fix my life\nand i can blame the world\nand then i don't have to do then my body\ndoesn't have to get up out of the chair\nand start exercising and clean my house\nand all this other crap that my body\ndoesn't want to do\ni don't have to clean out my fridge and\ngo buy groceries and cook every day and\nwake up at 6 a.m like think about how\nmuch your body and mind hate doing that\ncrap\nand when you give up on the future when\nthings are helpless when you're when you\nhave learned helplessness you have a\npass for all that stuff you don't have\nto do any of that little crap\nwhy bother\nright so really what your mind is\ngetting out of that is the ability to be\nlike completely chill in the present\nuh the absolution of all\nresponsibilities from today\nthat's what learned helplessness buys\nyou and just think that's why it's so\nhard to kick\nbecause if you can do something about it\nthen it maybe is your fault\nand if you can do something about it\nmaybe you do need to work your ass off\nbut the thing is\ni don't want to work my ass off\nand i don't want it to be my fault so\nwhat i'm going to end up doing is\nleaning into helplessness\nbecause that's how my addictive mind can\njust play video games all day\neasy\nyou all get that it's tricky\nyeah as is fern de luna saying take back\nyour agency 100\nyou don't even have to i mean take back\nis a good sense i'd say pick it up\nbecause it's not like you gave it away\nyou just set it down\nright but how you start with the\nsmallest thing that you can do today\nyou live in the present\nright so when people say the smallest\nthing why do we use the word small\nit's because if we think about something\nbig what does your mind do it sneaks in\noh my god that's too hard oh my god it's\nnot gonna work oh my god i can't i can't\nafford to mess it up\nso the second you you start adding\nbecause if something is big then the\ndimension of time enters\nright\ni can't you can eat healthy today you\ncan 100 eat healthy today but you can't\ndiet for 10 weeks like that's hard and\nso your mind is like oh it's hard to\ndiet for 10 weeks so why bother eating\nhealthy today if i can't do it for the\nfull 10 weeks\nif i need my beach bod\nin 10 weeks time that's going to be hard\nso don't bother\nthe second the dimension of time enters\nyou're screwed\nand when what happens your mind is\ntricky it's sneaky right because what it\nlooks at is looks like oh my god like\nimagine how many years it's going to\ntake to put your life together and it\nmay not even work\nand the mind is like eh\ndon't bother\nit's not worth it\nright so the second time enters\nhelplessness enters with it\nbecause then your mind says it's futile\nwhat's the point of eating healthy for\none day\nand this is where detachment comes in\nbecause it doesn't matter because we're\nnot worried about the outcome who cares\nabout the outcome whether it succeeds or\nwhether it fails i'm gonna eat healthy\ntoday\nit's the one thing i'm gonna do\nand your mind is like no no but don't do\nthat\nwhat do you mean\nwe care about the future\nno no no no\nyou got to think about the future\nit's not going to be enough\nwhat do you mean we're like you're not\ngoing to give me a cheeseburger what the\n[ __ ] bro\ncome on\nright\nkoji korum is saying what's the point of\nsmoking of not smoking a blunt exactly\nlike why bother just smoke the blunt\nbecause what your mind wants is the\nblunt\nwants the cheeseburger wants the video\ngames it wants that dopamine\nwants to relax wants to be numb\nwants those cannabinoids like whatever\nwhatever you want\nit doesn't want to deal with those\nemotions that you've been bottling up\nand bearing inside you for a long time\nright because if you start to eat\nhealthy today like the feelings of\ninadequacy come up the feelings of oh\nwhat do you think you're doing you think\nyou're going to lose weight\nyou ugly sucker\nright you look at yourself in the mirror\nand all the self-loathing comes up you\nhave to deal with all that crap and it's\nlike no we're gonna set all that crap\naside i'm just gonna eat healthy today\nacid demon says that sort of hit home i\nhad a guy tell me today that we weren't\nfit for for the long term after i told\nhim i had anxiety and it was sort of\ngetting to me but a lot of my anxiety\ncomes from what i've dealt with yeah 100\nso i think the other thing that you've\ngot to be super careful about\nis assuming that his statement of we\nweren't fit for the long term\nis a response to i have anxiety\nbecause if you're not careful you're\ngoing to learn a bad lesson from that\nwhich will protect you because then if\nyou don't tell people that you have\nanxiety maybe they won't say that which\nis the lesson that your mind will learn\nbut then what's going to start happening\nis you're going to start not living\nauthentically\nwhich is going to cause more problems\ndown the right line so the hardest thing\nfor someone with anxiety is giving\nsomeone the opportunity to reject them\nwhich you should absolutely be doing\nbecause once you give someone the\nopportunity to reject you you also give\nsomeone the opportunity to accept you\nand once you show people how busted you\nare and they stay anyway\nthat's how you get fixed right that's\nwhen someone sends you that really\nimportant signal which is you matter and\ni don't care that you have anxiety you\nhave intrinsic worth as a human being\nthat your anxiety does not wipe away\nand the problem is that that's the\nmessage that like you really need to\nheal\nthe other big challenge is that\nsometimes that message is most easily\ndelivered from another person\nright which is what i'm saying is like\nwe have a responsibility to each other\nto like try to support each other\nthrough this stuff because it's not like\nlife is not a solo player game\nit's just not\nyou"
