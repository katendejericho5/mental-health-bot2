    "transcript": "even like psychoanalysts 100 years ago\nwere talking about that and there was a\nguy named otto rank who basically\nposited that the first major traumatic\nexperience that all human beings go\nthrough is birth and so if we think\nabout what anxiety is anxiety is like\nworry about the future right what if\nthings don't work out kids will be\nexquisitely sensitive to the moods of\ntheir parents\nand for those of you that sort of grew\nup in households where unfortunately you\nexperience some amount of abuse or maybe\nlike drinking in the house you'll you'll\nremember that you were exquisitely\nsensitive to your parents moods\n[Music]\ni was once happy content sloshing around\nat my own private primordial pool then\none day for reasons beyond my control i\nwas repeatedly crushed\nover and over by the cruel cervix of my\nmother leslie so the show actually\nstarts off with\nthis image\nand it starts off with like\nthis fetus presumably rue who's kind of\nthe protagonist\nbeing in the womb right and what happens\nwhen we're in the womb is\nwe're content so if we think a little\nbit about like the womb right so the\nwomb is like a place where\nwe have an umbilical cord that's\nconnected to our parent our parent our\nmother usually\nand that umbilical cord kind of supplies\nus with everything that we need so all\nof our waste products like all of our\nthe results of cellular metabolism are\nsent out through the umbilical cord all\nof our glucose our fats are\nour everything that we need even\nhormones and things like that are sort\nof transmitted through the umbilical\ncord\nwhere we're very protected in this\nenvironment so we're filled the the\nuterus is filled with something called\namniotic fluid and the amniotic fluid\nlike protects us from things like bumps\nright so if if i'm if my mother is\nwalking down the street and and the\npavement is kind of rocky the amniotic\nfluid is going to protect me against\nvibration it's going to protect me\nagainst sound it's going to protect me\nagainst everything\nand so what sort of people realize is\nthat like the womb is sort of the\nperfect environment right it's dark it's\njust kind of filled with relative\ncontentment\nand the interesting thing is that\neven like psychoanalysts a hundred years\nago were talking about that and there\nwas a guy named otto rank who basically\nposited that the first major traumatic\nexperience that all human beings go\nthrough is birth\nso prior to birth we're perfectly\ncontent\nright and like we don't have any needs\nthere's nothing wrong in the world\nbecause we're not even aware of what we\nare but all of our needs are getting met\nand the second that we were born\nsuddenly like something drastic changes\nright so we're not\nthis is where things kind of like\nevolve\ninto discomfort so all of our needs are\nmet and then when we're born suddenly\nlike we're capable of feeling cold we're\ncapable of feeling hungry we're capable\nof feeling\nalone we're capable of feeling\nfrightened\nsuddenly like all of these things change\nlike we're not perfectly protected in a\ntemperature stable environment sites can\nbe scary lights can be bright sounds can\ndisturb our rest whereas in the womb\nnone of these things happen\nso otto rank sort of showed up and he\nkind of hypothesized that the most basic\ntrauma that human beings experience\nis the process of being born and there's\nsome interesting physiologic kind of\nconnotations to this so for example\nwhen children are born they have spikes\nof cortisol so cortisol is a stress\nhormone and literally that cortisol\nhelps with things like lung maturity so\neven the process of being born the\nstressful experience and all the crying\nthat you\nexperience has a physiologic effect of\nboosting your cortisol level and that\nboosting of your cortisol level actually\nhelps our lungs understand hey we need\nto start breathing and prepare some\nprepares our lungs for breathing which\nis why if we have premature babies\nsometimes what we'll do is we'll have to\nuse cortisol injections to prepare them\nfor birth and like being able to\noptimize optimally survive in the\nexternal world\nso there was a there are a lot of other\ninteresting psycho analytic theories\nabout birth trauma so people sort of\nposited that\nthe most basic\nform of anxiety or discomfort happens\nduring birth trauma so there was another\nanalyst named beyond\nbayern i'm not quite sure how to\npronounce it bion\nwho basically talked about how the basic\nimprint of anxiety and trauma is like\nthrough birth trauma so what he sort of\nnoted was that as we look at\nas we're born if you think about the the\nthe infant brain within hours of birth\nor even days or weeks of birth we don't\nreally like have the capacity to\nunderstand what's going on we don't even\nunderstand like what emotions are all we\nhave are these raw unfiltered\nexperiences\nso in this infant brain like you just\nyou just feel hungry right and you don't\neven know what hungry is\nall you know is that there are all these\nsignals\nthat are working their way through your\nbody that make you feel discontent and\nyou have no control like you can't\nyou don't understand what's going on you\nfeel bad you don't even know in what way\nthings are bad and you're completely at\nthe mercy of the world right do you get\nfed or do you not get fed you get cold\ndo you get changed do you get warmed up\ndo you get do they put a beanie on your\nhead do they not put a beanie on your\nhead so it's kind of this unfiltered\nroller coaster of negative experience\nfollowed by contentment hopefully in\nwhich you kind of like get milk drunk\nand you pass out and then you wake up\nagain and you're hungry and then you're\nback to this like unfiltered state of\ndiscomfort\nand so this was very very fundamentally\nanalysts sort of believe that this is\nincredibly traumatic and lays the\nfoundation on a very core level of\nanxiety\nand so if we think about what anxiety is\nanxiety is like worry about the future\nright what if things don't work out what\nif and if we think a little bit about\nhow does the human brain learn to fear\nthe future how does it learn to be\nanxious it's through this birthing\nprocess or at least that's the theory\nthat these people would posit right that\nsuddenly now you're in this world where\nlike you don't know how long the\ncontentment is gonna last and you're\njust getting bodied by all of these\nweird sensations you know frustration\nbeing hungry needing to get changed\nfeeling uncomfortable feeling afraid but\nyou don't even know what those are so\nthose experiences when sort of put into\nthe fetal mind or the infant mind are\njust so incredibly traumatic because\nthere's no way to process them\nthere are also like you know\ncriticisms or other perspectives on this\nbut i think it's really interesting that\nthe show\nessentially talks about this contentment\nas the beginning of things\nnow the interesting thing is that if you\nlook at a lot of this traumatic birth\nkind of stuff\nwhat they sort of talk a little bit\nabout is\nthe way that children learn to navigate\nthis in a healthy way or unhealthy way\nthe way that we learn that anxiety is to\nbe feared above all else or the way that\nour anxiety gets reassured is actually\nthrough our original like maternal\nparent or paternal bonding so when\nchildren are born they bond\nand this show also is kind of really\ninteresting because they talk a little\nbit about\num\nthis the state into which the main\ncharacter was born\ni was born three days after 9\n11. can hear you the rest of the world\nhears you and the people who knock these\nbuildings down we'll hear all of them\nmy mother and father spent two days in\nthe hospital holding me under the soft\nglow of the television so the main\ncharacter i think was born right around\n9 11. and so they talk a little bit\nabout how their parents for the first 48\nhours of their life were just watching\nstuff related to the twin towers and the\nterrorist attacks\nand this kind of makes me wonder because\nlike you know this sort of\nbonding that happens between children\nand parents is so important and so what\nhappens to a child who is bonding with a\nmother or father\nwho\nare like concerned about 9 11 right so\nthe world was shocked people are\ngrieving people are like worried there's\na lot of uncertainty in the world people\nlike sort of think the world is going to\nend you know it's very very shocking and\nif the parents are sort of for 48 hours\nsitting in a hospital room where they're\nobsessing over 9 11 what impact does\nthat have on maternal\nchild bonding right because the\ninteresting thing to remember is that\nchildren when we're born we don't really\nhave logic we don't have really\nemotional awareness we have no way of\ncommunicating\nor understanding other people all\nchildren have is empathy right so like\nthe most important circuit the most\nimportant way to communicate and\ninteract with a child is empathy so\nparents sort of develop a feeling for\nokay is this kid doing okay is it that's\nnot doing okay and similarly kids will\nbe exquisitely sensitive to the moods of\ntheir parents\nand for those of you that sort of grew\nup in households where unfortunately you\nexperience some amount of abuse or maybe\nlike drinking in the house\nyou'll you'll remember that you were\nexquisitely sensitive to your parents\nmoods\nso we've had people that we've\ninterviewed and you know this is not\njust people we've interviewed here but\nthis is my experience as a clinician\nyou know if you talk to kids who grew up\nin abusive households they know within\nseconds of\nseeing the parent\nwhether they're in trouble that day or\nnot they they're exquisitely sensitive\nto the mood of others and so it starts\nto beg the question like if we grow up\nin a particular situation where our\nparents are grieving our parents are\nparanoid our parents are concerned what\ndoes that do to the anxiety that was\nlaid down by our birth trauma\nand this is where it's kind of\ninteresting because from the get-go\nwe can explore things like attachment\ntheory so attachment theory is this idea\nthat\nhow we relate to other human beings\ndepends on something called attachment\nand so whether we have secure attachment\nor anxious attachment or avoidant\nattachment or fearful attachment the way\nthat we fundamentally relate to other\nhuman beings gets kind of determined\nvery early on so let's explain this a\nlittle bit\nbecause this is important for for drug\naddiction as well\nso when i'm a kid\ni don't really understand the world\nright like the world sort of doesn't\nmake sense to me so the most important\nthing that reassures me the way i\nfundamentally get my internal anxiety\nabout the world re being reassured or\nnot is the consistency of the world\naround me\nso for example if you think about a\nchild who becomes confident with gravity\nright so like if i have a three-year-old\na three-year-old is like happy to jump\noff of sofas you know jump onto things\nroll around jump around jump on a\ntrampoline they're happy to throw balls\npick up balls\neven one-year-olds will like pick up\nfood and like drop it on the ground\nright so like\nkids are confident when it comes to\ngravity and why are kids so damn\nconfident when it comes to gravity even\nto the point where parents are like you\nknow have to you have to really watch\nyour kid because they'll do things that\nare unsafe when it comes to gravity\nthey'll jump off of things they'll jump\ninto things like you have to be really\ncareful about kids right where does that\nconfidence with gravity come come from\nit comes from consistency so the cool\nthing about gravity is gravity doesn't\nhave moods\nright like gravity isn't happy one\nmoment in pissed one moment\ngravity isn't sober one moment and like\ndrunk the next moment\nso consistency of parenting is what\nleads to confidence in the child\nthe second aspect of attachment theory\nthat's really really important is\nemotional mirroring which is related to\nthat consistency so the other thing to\nremember is that a one-year-old doesn't\nknow what they're feeling so how does a\none-year-old understand what they're\nfeeling what they actually do is look at\nthe facial expressions of the people\naround them so when a one-year-old gets\nhurt\nwhat do other adults do they pick up the\nchild and they're like oh a poor baby\nwith a baby is with the baby okay are\nyou all right with the baby\nright so as we do that kind of thing\nwe sort of like we show the child what\nthey should be feeling\nand so they understand what anger is\nbecause if they're upset you know maybe\nwe're gonna have to discipline them if\nthey're acting out and angry a child may\nhave to be disciplinary if the child is\nhurt and falls down a parent will like\npick them up and cuddle them and be like\noh it's okay baby it's okay\nand then the other thing that happens is\npositive reinforcement is also\nemotionally mirrored in like a greater\nway so let's think a little bit about\nyou know when the kid\ndraws something that is illegible and\nthey bring it to you with pride they're\nlike look daddy like look at this weird\nthing that i drew\nand as you show the weird thing that you\ndrew the parents are like oh my god\nthat's amazing look at that what is that\nby the way i can't really tell\nso what we tend to see with kids and\nearly on is that if parents respond to\nthem consistently in an emotionally\nmirroring and supportive way\nthose children become\nsecurely attached they become\nconfident about the world and the reason\nthey're confident about the world is\nbecause the world makes sense right and\nyou compare that to\num you know children who grow up with\ninconsistent caregiving so this is like\na good example of we'll kind of talk\nabout a couple of these examples\nso what we tend to find is that you know\npeople who are\nsecure have\nlow avoidance and low anxiety right so\nthey're like willing to engage they're\nwilling to try new things\nthey're not like they have confidence in\nthemselves and then we also have like an\nanxious attachment which is like when\npeople are are very very high anxiety\num but they're also they may be willing\nto engage with other people so this\ncomes from sort of inconsistent\nparenting\nand then you'll also have like avoid an\nattachment so i think avoiding\nattachments\nare very very classically common in\nterms of men who have difficulty forming\nstrong emotional bonds\nso in avoidant attachments what\nsometimes will happen is you'll have a\nchild that shares their emotional needs\nwhich are not met by the parent\nand so then what happens is the the\nchild starts to resent the parent for\nnot meeting our emotional needs and then\nthey avoid the parent all together so\nthis is the kind of thing where if like\nif i share emotional vulnerability and\nyou don't meet me where i'm at then i'm\ngonna start resenting you and then what\ni'm gonna learn is to be fiercely\nindependent\nright because like the lesson that i\nlearn is if i share my emotional needs\nwith people\nand they don't they don't meet them then\nlike i can't rely on people so it\ndoesn't necessarily make me anxious\nbut it keeps me like separated from\nother people so these are people who\nhave struggled to form connections and\nif we kind of think about it it's almost\nlike a protective model\nwhere people with avoidant attachment\nstyles will be like very very careful\nabout you know what kind of\nrelationships they form because they're\nafraid that like if i am vulnerable with\nyou like what's gonna happen i don't\nknow so the best thing to do is not be\nemotionally vulnerable to begin with\nso there are some interesting\nexperiments that kind of go into this\nmy point here is that generally speaking\nyou know this is protective\nagainst drugs\nand these three are not protective\nagainst drugs and the cool thing about\nthe show is that the show has different\nattachment styles that you'll see with\ndifferent characters that all relate to\nsubstance use in some different way okay\nbut the key thing here is that if we're\ntalking about the show like i don't know\nwhat impact you know growing up with 911\nhas on attachment now this doesn't you\nalso have to be careful i'm kind of over\ngeneralizing here because you know there\nare all kinds of kids that grew up after\n9 11 that have good and secure\nattachment who are alive today so you\ncan't really draw that one-to-one\ncorrelation but it just sort of makes me\nwonder a little bit because if we kind\nof look at the show the show really\nemphasizes some of these concepts right\nand like even in this is the first two\nminutes of the show or 160 seconds 90\nseconds of the show where they kind of\ntalk about the hand that rue was dealt\nwhen rue came into the world and that's\nsomething that i think is really really\nimportant to think about in terms of\naddictions so we tend to think about\naddictions as diagnoses right and we\ntalk about brain stuff and\nneurotransmitters and genetic\nvulnerabilities but the truth is there's\na lot of really core stuff involving\naddictions that i think the show really\nsets up very well\nnext up\nnow this is fantastic\nso\nthis is actually before we kind of get\nto this i want to talk about one other\nthing\nso the other challenge right now that we\ntend to see i think with substance use\nis that\nif you really look at it objectively\nthis is this show sort of shows okay 9\n11 happened roo grew up in this kind of\nsituation it she grew up sort of in a\nworld of fear right so in the first 10\nyears of her life\nfor those of you in the u.s like you\nremember what the not post 911 world was\nright was like right so we went to war\nas the united states there was an\nemphasis on terror the department of\nhomeland security was created there was\na lot of like racism\nthere was a lot of discrimination that\nhappened and so like we kind of grew up\nwith this like once in a lifetime event\ni think if you look at substance use\nright so we're seeing that substance use\nis generally speaking getting worse or\nnot just substance use let's just talk\nabout addiction as a whole so it's not\njust like chemical addictions which are\ngetting worse for all kinds of reasons\nso some of the reasons that\nchemical addictions are getting worse\nsubstances are getting worse it's all\nkind of fascinating stuff so the first\nis that we've been breeding stuff to be\nmore\naddictive so if you look at the potency\nof marijuana the potency of marijuana\nhas increased drastically over the last\nlike 40 years right so people have been\nlike\nbreeding stronger and stronger strains\nand that doesn't even include the\nsynthetics so the other thing that we\nstarted doing is getting very very\ncreative with what kind of synthetic\nsubstances we'll make so there's like\nnative american you know spirits journey\njourneys that involve ayahuasca\nand now we've isolated dmt and people\nwill take dmt and they'll take different\nmetabol i mean different kind of\nchemical modifications of dmt and so\nwhat we're seeing\nfrom addictions is that like\ndrugs are getting stronger they're\ngetting more potent they're also\nbecoming more nuanced so this is where\nwe'll get get into this in a little bit\nbut when you get into addiction you know\npeople have a drug of choice\nright so some people will really get\naddicted to one substance over a\ndifferent substance and why is that it's\nbecause their neurochemistry the way\ntheir brain is wired is just a little\nbit different there's studies that show\nthat you know the\ndopaminergic or reward response that a\nparticular addict gets from alcohol will\nbe different from what they get from\nmarijuana whereas another person may get\na huge response from marijuana and very\nlittle from alcohol\nnow what you do is you take a world\nwhere we have all these different kinds\nof drugs right so it's not just one type\nof drug it's not just marijuana now you\nhave sativa blends and you have indica\nblends you have cbd heavy stuff and you\nhave thc heavy stuff not to mention all\nof the different kinds of synthetic\nmarijuanas like k2 for example which is\nhighly psychotic and like doesn't really\ncalm people down it's like the opposite\nof cbd\nwhere people it gives people very very\npowerful experiences but also makes them\nlike kind of crazy\nwhen i was in residency so a huge\ndisclaimer by the way like don't do\ndrugs kids and this is a really really\ngood example of this so when i was in\nresidency in massachusetts\nyou know people would use k2 and like\nthey would get really really messed up\nlike mess themselves up permanently and\nit just messes you up so bad and what\nwe're seeing right now in substance use\nis that as we make five or ten different\nvariants of drugs what we're essentially\ndoing\nis selecting for all of the different\nvariants right so if you start using\ndrugs and you try out five different\nvariants of marijuana you may be able to\nfind the perfect marijuana blend for you\nwhich we'll get to in a second in terms\nof why people use it but then what that\nactually does is opens you up to more\naddictive potential and more\npossibility to like really screw up your\nlife so you got to be careful about that\nstuff\nbut the other thing that the show kind\nof highlights if we kind of think about\nit\nis some of this stuff about you know\ntragedy in the world so if we think a\nlittle bit about what environment rue\ngrew up in she grew up in the post 9 11\ndru\npost 9 11 world\nand this is the interesting thing about\ngrowing up in this generation not uh\ntalking about gen z so mostly all who\nare listening to this\nis that we've had like\nfour once in a lifetime crises within 20\nyears\nright it's kind of wild like if you\nthink\nabout you know\nwhat we what this generation has had to\ndeal with\nit's been like thing after thing after\nthing after thing\nand if we talk we'll get into this a\nlittle bit more but if we talk a little\nbit about what predisposes us to drug\nuse okay\nwhat we're gonna find is that like you\nknow this is the happy and content world\nand then you get born into a world but\nwhat kind of world do you get born into\ndo you get born into a world that's like\npost 911 and then like you know after 9\n11\nwe had the\n2007-2008 you know economic crash at\nleast in the united states and so that\nwas like a once-in-a-lifetime black swan\nunpredictable economic crisis\nand then we've got like climate change\nright so the world is like it's a little\nbit unclear whether the world will just\nstraight up end at some point right\nwhether there's some kind of\ncatastrophic collapse to our ocean\nsystem\nif there's a catastrophic collapse to\nour ocean system and like all the algae\ndies that's what actually produces like\ntraps the most greenhouse gases right\nalgae like or carbon fixers so they take\nco2 out of the environment they produce\noxygen and then like if they die like\nyou know the fish die and all that kind\nof stuff we could see a catastrophic\ncollapse\nto the world like we could be like\nliterally like apocalyptic kind of times\nright and no one really knows whether\nthis is gonna happen or not happen some\npeople think we're overblowing the risks\nother people think that this is we're\ndefinitely on the path to destroy\nourselves within 100 years i don't\nreally know i've looked at a lot of\nscience it concerns me but it's not my\narea of expertise the point here what we\nare focused on is not whether the world\nis going to end or not but growing up in\na society where there's like a lot of\nvery strong scientific evidence that\nwe're on the path to screwing ourselves\nright there's economic crises\nthere's climate change there's stuff\nlike 911 and by the way there's also\nthis global pandemic which basically\nshut down the world for two years\nright\nand like\nthe human rights related stuff that's\nhappening with covet as well like\nthere's all kinds of stuff going on\nand this is the the problem is that\nlike\nwhat is that doing to our psychology\nwhat is it like to be a 20 year old kid\nexisting in the world today\nand there's a counter argument here as\nwell where you can say that well like\nhumanity on the whole has gotten a lot\nbetter and like there's definitely an\nargument for that right so if you look\nat medical advancement like it's pretty\ncool that you know we've basically\neliminated polio through vaccines we've\nbasically we can catch we've essentially\neliminated cervical cancer or reduced\ncervical cancer drastically through the\nhpv vaccine so that's huge right people\naren't dying of cervical cancer like\ni remember in culturally and like\nreligiously kind of the same thing\nyou don't name a kid until they're like\n30 days old in several cultures right\nwhy is that like why don't we why don't\neven we even give kids names it's\nbecause infant mortality used to be\nthrough the roof now people think about\ntheir kids names before even they're\npregnant like we take it for granted\nthat our children will survive right\nwhich is that is an assumption that\nhuman beings didn't have a hundred years\nago so there's absolutely been progress\nlike there's no question about that\nright so we've got like solar panels\nlike that's pretty cool we've got\nelectric cars like that's pretty cool\nwe've got technology in video games and\nvirtual reality and medicine is\nimproving that's pretty cool we're in\nthe days of like uber and uber eats and\nwe we have so much cultural exchange\nlike i can watch a korean soap opera if\ni want to like that's pretty cool\nso life has definitely gotten better by\na lot of objective measures as well\nbut when we think about the psychology\nof what it's like to grow up in the\nworld today we get bombarded by like\nsome really really scary stuff\nand what do we do about that right what\ndo we how do we manage that like it's\nlike okay so you're telling me i have to\ngo to college right and the reason i\nneed to go to college is so that i can\nget a good job the reason i can get a\ngood job is so that i can be financially\nindependent and then presumably get\nmarried and have kids and all this kind\nof stuff but like what if the world ends\nin 20 years\ni've had several patients\ntalk to me about they're afraid to have\nchildren and it's like why is that well\nit's like i don't want to bring a child\ninto a world that's like apocalyptic\nbecause the\nthe climate is collapsing and then like\nhuman beings die like that's terrible\nlike i don't want to do that\ni've had patients who talk about\nthe anxiety and concern about bringing\nchildren into this world which i'm sure\nto some degree has always been there\nright so every generation is concerned\nabout the world ending\nlike\nin the next hundred years i'm sure that\nthere are people who sort of do that but\nare concerned about that but i really\nthink that\nour exposure to this kind of information\nthe volume at which we get it because\nit's always one disaster after another\nright we just has something to do with\nthe internet in the way that we consume\ninformation the way that information\nfloats to the top so what information\nfloats to the top the information that\nis emotionally charged\nthat's what we react to\nand so what ends up happening is we see\nthe most emotionally charged stuff\nfrom all over the world day after day\nafter day after day\nand what impact does that have on our\npsychology well it's like\nokay i've got a choice between this\nor this and this is what i want\nright i want to go back to the womb\nwhere like\nthere was no sense of you know things\nare going to hell in the womb in fact\neverything was perfectly content\n13\n14\n15\n16. what are you looking at room 17.\nlook at me\none\ntwo\nthree what are you doing\n[Music]\nnow you get kids\nwho are growing up with some amount of\nexistential dread\nand this is where things are gonna get a\nlittle bit tricky\nso then what happens is like you'll get\nsome kids right and here's the thing\nkids are unique not all kids are the\nsame i don't know if you guys can kind\nof see this one but she's just she's\ncounting up here so she's just like\ncounting things\non the ceiling\nand then the parents like look at the\nkid and they're like wait a minute i\ndon't understand what my kid is doing\nso i want you to think a little bit\nabout you know if roo was born 200 years\nago and she was counting\nobjects right maybe a little bit of like\nobsessive compulsive tendencies\nwhat would a parent do a parent would be\nlike i don't really know what's up right\nwe didn't have answers for everything\nback then but now living in the\ninformation age it's very subtle\nbut we look at something and we see a\nkid and we don't understand what they're\ndoing they're maybe a little bit unique\nit's a little bit of a strange behavior\nand then like the parent is like okay\nwhat is going on because there's sort of\nthis assumption that there is an answer\nout there and i don't know if that makes\nsense to y'all but like a hundred years\nago\nyou know there wasn't wikipedia like we\ndidn't have answers at our fingertips in\nfact like most human beings like didn't\nreally have answers to stuff which is\nwhy religion used to be so big so\nreligion would give us some vague sense\noh this is just like god makes each and\nevery one of us and in a particular\nunique way okay period right is rue\nreally doing anything that's problematic\nin this scene like no she's just like\ncounting stuff maybe a little bit\ndistracted from her dinner like maybe\nthat's you know\nthere's just something like a little bit\nweird like our kid is doing something\nthat's a little bit sus completely\nnormal\nbut\nnowadays we need answers for everything\nright because we've grown up with the\nassumption that there are answers for\neverything there's a reason i'm doing\nthis there's a reason my kid is that way\nand what's even more terrifying is if\nyou're a parent\nwhat if you're like\nmessing up right so you want to be a\ngood parent and your kid is doing\nsomething that you don't understand so\nwhat do you do if your kid starts doing\nthings that you don't understand you\ncan't let uncertainty be a part of it\nbecause what if you screw up what if\nyou're missing something what if\nsomething is going on because everyone's\ntalking about mental illness what do we\ndo\nwe take him to see a psychiatrist\nyou"
