    "transcript": "but this is the kind of thing where like\nif you all are having trouble so this is\njust general advice right so people are\nlike sort of doing this weird like\nno one's really saying it but you kind\nof get disinvited and people are awkward\nand stuff like that i think it's\nimportant to have a conversation with\npeople and say you know these\nfriendships are really important to me i\nwant to understand\nwhat to expect i understand that i\nscrewed up i understand that i was\nmanipulated and if if you all sort of\nfeel like because of that\nyou know\nthere is like i'm always going to be\nkind of a second class citizen in this\nfriend group like\nthat's fine i just want to know is that\nwhat i should expect\nhello hello\nthank you so much for having me uh my\nname is dylan\nhi dylan\nuh let me just scroll up quickly to find\nmy question again um\nyeah so my question\nuh last year i had a huge falling out\nwith a friend of mine and she tried\ncontacting me and i didn't answer back\nthen and recently i felt ready to send\nher a message myself so i did and she\nhasn't opened it yet and it will\nprobably stay that way\nand this has made me feel like i lost a\nhuge part like a huge friend in my life\nso\nhow should i go about this loss and how\ncan i prevent such things\nuh from happening in the future\ni'm sorry that happened um\ndo you want to go first you go\nokay\num\nyeah i'm i'm really sorry that happened\ni i think\ni think this is one of those like even\nthe best case scenario is\nnot like\nyou will have that friendship back at\n100\nso\nit's kind of like once these friendships\nfall apart like there is no 100 anymore\nso\n[Music]\ni\ni think like kind of mourning that\nrelationship is appropriate where like\nthis person isn't going to be in your\nlife in the same way anymore but if it's\nmore of a question of like how to\navoid this in the future\ni think that's really about the dynamic\nof how it happened in the first place\nso i would want to ask you more\nquestions about\nkind of what happened\nto be able to give you better advice\nabout how to avoid it\nwhat uh sure so you want me to give more\ncontext about it\nmore context to like know what to say\nbut do you have any initial thoughts\nbefore he gives context\num\nyeah so i i didn't mean to laugh i\nrealized i could have come across as\ncallous because like i just hear this\nstory so damn much\nand and i do i do think there's actually\nlike a super simple answer to it\nand but if we want to go into the\ncontext\nlike so we can sort of answer the\nquestion given everything that you've\nasked which is going to give you a\ngeneral answer\nabout how to behave\nuh which\ni i think is pretty straightforward but\nif we want to kind of dive into it or\nmaybe i can say my piece and then i can\nget more content you can give the\ngeneral advice\nso\nfirst thing to understand so like let's\nlet's understand timeline so how what\nwas the\ndistance what was the time frame between\nthe falling out you had and when your\nfriend sent you a former friend sent you\na message\nlike\nbasically instantly\nokay\nand what was the time frame between you\nnot responding to that message and you\nsending them a message\na year\nokay\nand how long have you waited for a\nresponse\num\nabout\ntwo to three weeks okay so let's just\nunderstand the situation\nyour response time to your friend is how\nlong\nuh a year\nokay so like\nand you're expecting a response in how\nlong\nuh i'm like not even really expecting a\nresponse i like realized that like she\ncould be doing the\nexact same\nlike thing to me 100 right so so and i\ndon't think that's out of malice i don't\nthink she's like\nscrew you\nyou're messaging me after a year i mean\nthere may be some kind of resentment but\nlet's just acknowledge for a moment that\nit takes time for human beings to\nprocess feelings\nand in your case it took you a year\nwhich is like totally fine\nand so give your friend\nsome leeway and don't give up on the\nrelationship yet because i think\nyou know it may be salvageable\nso i just give your friend like it's\nbeen two weeks and it took you a year so\nlike cut your friend some slack and be a\nlittle bit patient the other general\nadvice\nsorry\nuh you you can be compassionate the\nother general advice is is that when\nsomeone sends you a message it's\nsomething that everyone needs to\nunderstand when someone sends you a\nmessage you should at least respond\nin some way that is like\nrespectful and lets them know you're\nconsidering it this whole like leaving\nthing leaving things on red is just so\npainful for people\nso if your question was how do i prevent\nthis from happening again\nwhat i would strongly strongly recommend\nis that if they send you a message right\naway\nyou at least respond to them and you say\nhey like the falling out that we went\nthrough has been really hard on me like\ni'm gonna need some time to process\nleast let them know that you you know\nbecause like imagine what that\nexperience is like for your friend where\ny'all are close friends you have a\nfalling out they sort of extend some\nkind of hand and i'm not saying you have\nto patch things up i'm not saying that\nyou have to like\nyou know\nhave a deep conversation with them but\nat least some kind of receipt of\nacknowledgement and letting them know\nthat you need some space\nto process\ni think would really if you're trying to\nfigure out how do i prevent this from\nhappening again\nthat one message i think could impact a\nlot\nwhat do you think about that yeah\nyeah uh so to give a bit more context\nyou said that you like heard the story a\nlot before so you're probably like can\nlike already guess that i like\nkinda had a crush on this girl\num so\nuh that also like\nmade me um like\na lot like clingy and jealous and like\nvery controlling over her\nwhich he also didn't like which was like\none of the major points of the reason of\nuh\nthat that like\nthe falling out and um\nyeah so basically like i\nwanted to respond when she sent a\nmessage\nand i'm like gonna do like a confession\nhere for like 4k people\nbut like i kind of did that in a\nmanipulative way\nlike i wanted her to worry about me i\nguess\nwell not i guess i know\nmuted\nso i was just saying i i think grooty\ngo\nsaying we were commending your\nself-awareness\nyeah and i was saying like that you know\ni think it's a really big step you've\ntaken and if you want to prevent these\nkinds of things happening again\nyou know as we say good diagnosis\nprecedes good treatment even though\nnothing here is medical treatment i\nthink it's a good\nyou know general thing that you have to\nunderstand a problem before you can fix\nit\nand you're being able to admit some of\nyour feelings and your awareness of how\nyou are feeling i think will\nis the first step is the antidote to\nlike those kinds of manipulative\nbehaviors because once you acknowledge\nthe way that you feel they lose their\nability to control you as powerfully\nall right\nare you still crushing on her\nuh no i've moved on from that\nsag\nsorry all fell apart\nbut yeah that that's\nit seems like you know kind of what\nhappened and so you would be able to not\ndo that again\nand for what it's worth i wouldn't give\nup on the relationship quite yet\nand i would even say you know given a a\nlittle bit of space\ni don't think it's\ni don't think it's a huge problem to\neven send another message like one more\nmessage maybe in a couple of months if\nyou really feel like you need to for the\nsake of your closure\nand then\nlet it go\nyeah it's it's also\na bit difficult because we share a\nfriend group and like with the remainder\nof those friends i i still\nlike i'm still on good terms with um\nbut like oftentimes when\nwe're hanging out\nand\nshe wants to join i like have to go away\num why wait do your friends know what\nhappened between the two of you\nthey do okay\nuh well yeah i\nand and to answer the question of why um\nwait go ahead\ni'm trying to toggle the mutes and stuff\ntoo\num\nso you're trying to figure out a way to\nboth be in the same place together\nwell yeah because like i\nbasically i wanna\nlike hang out with my friends and it's\nit's kind of hard then to uh\nto do that when i get a well sent away\noften like i understand why i get sent\naway it's it's because like it gets\nawkward and she doesn't want to be in\nthe same room as me and i've been kind\nof like\nyou know like a a villain or like a\nnegative person towards her so\nwell i mean\num it's basically like the majority\nlike vote like they're basically like\nyeah i don't i don't really want him\nhere and the other person says uh\nwell yeah i also think it's gonna get\nawkward i i believe that you should like\ngo away\nbasically\ngot it yeah so that's where i mean\nsomething about what you're saying\nreally pisses me off yeah\num so we don't know the details of how\nmuch of a manipulative person you were\nso maybe that's\nbut a year is a long time yeah i mean i\ni would jail sentence i feel like your\ntime is served so here here's where\nhere's where like so we we have\npotentially a failing in this community\nwhich is that we tend to accept people\nand root for them no matter how bad\nthey've screwed up\nright\nso so that's where like i think it's\nimportant for you to take responsibility\nfor your behavior\nand i think it's important for you to\nhave\na conversation with your friend group\nabout\nwhat it sounds to me like unfair\ntreatment so like you know you can say\ni would ask your friends like what does\nthis mean for us going forward does this\nmean that y'all are gonna essentially\nlike send me away\nanytime she wants to hang out for with\nwith you\ndoes this mean that like essentially\ncould i interrupt yeah because i i feel\nlike i haven't given like quite a\nneutral stance because\nto give like more nuance to be like more\nspecific\num\nit was like four\nso our friend could consist of four\npeople including me so still four people\nso um\nit was for a party um that\nshe and one other person hosted and the\nother person like invited me to that\nparty i was welcomed there\nand\num\nbut then like the the other day uh\nshe said\nlike the the girl that i fell out with\num said that i don't really really want\nhim\nthere at our party so it's like a 50 50\npercent like leadership\nyeah um\nabout that party yeah so\nand and then like basically like i\nalready had that 50 that didn't want me\nthere and then the other friend that i\nwas on good terms with said that yeah i\nkind of like understand her\nand like she didn't say that she was\npicking sides but it definitely felt\nthat way that she was like\nbasically picking sides and i mean i\nunderstand like\nlike it's like a girl's big girl side\nthing and also like i've been like the\nbad person in that story\num so i i understand why i got sent away\nfrom there but\nlike the other friend that i didn't talk\nabout in that story like he was like\npretty neutral about it like he he\ndefinitely\nfelt bad about uh so i mean i think\nthose details are important\nbut also the broader issue still stands\nthat i think a lot of times in friend\ngroups\ncrappy behavior gets propagated because\nit isn't explicitly named\nright behavior we're talking about my\nbehavior we're talking about your\nfriend's behavior now so so i i think\nthat if you've screwed up\nand\nyou were an ass like so this is where i\nthink that you should have a\nconversation with your friends\nabout your behavior how you were out of\nline how you were you've apologized and\nthen essentially ask your friends to lay\nout what you should expect so i think a\nvery very very good\nway to\nnavigate relationships is to ask people\nwhat your expectations should be about\ntheir behavior\nbecause when you do this\ni know this could torpedo your friend\ngroup\nbut just let's just talk through it okay\nso this is why i sort of mentioned that\ni kind of feel pissed off because i feel\nlike kind of combative i feel like\nyou know so maybe don't listen to me\nthanks for that facial expression it\nreally helps keep me in check\nbut this is the kind of thing where like\nif you all are having trouble so this is\njust general advice right so people are\nlike sort of doing this weird like\nno one's really saying it but you kind\nof get disinvited and people are awkward\nand stuff like that i think it's\nimportant to have a conversation with\npeople and say you know these\nfriendships are really important to me\ni want to understand\nwhat to expect i understand that i\nscrewed up i understand that i was\nmanipulated and if y'all sort of feel\nlike because of that\nyou know\nthere is like i'm always going to be\nkind of a second-class citizen in this\nfriend group like\nthat's fine i just want to know is that\nwhat i should expect\nor is this the kind of thing where\nmy ability to spend time with y'all\nalways depends on the comfort of a third\nperson\nwho\ni kind of like already got to expect\nthat this situation only happened one\ntime and i don't know if it's by pure\ncoincidence or by i don't know like\nuh chatting and meeting up behind my\nback that like i never\num\nlike\nbesides that situation from the party i\nnever got into another situation where\nwe would we both me and the girl who\nwould have um\nyeah so that doesn't that doesn't sound\nnearly as bad to me because i think it's\na whole different story when someone is\na host and doesn't want you invited\nright so like if i'm a host\ni get to choose who i invite i have\nquestions yeah how old are you\n20 years old 20. okay so this was you've\nalready done like a year of penance with\nthis friend group right\nuh\npenance as in sorry i'm not a native\nenglish speaker oh sorry so like you've\nalready kind of\npaid the price you've been punished for\na year\nuh\nwell yeah by punishing that means like\nnot really getting the chance to hang\nout with the friend group as much and\nlike also not having the chance to hang\nout with that specific friend as much\nokay and so you're 20 are you at\nuniversity\nyeah\nokay um\nand also like this this was my like only\nreal friend group at university yeah so\nit sounds like to me you're trying to\nlike hold on to these people because\nthese are your only friends so far right\nor only like good friends so far\num\nokay so\ni think\ni think 20 is a good age to kind of go\nthrough this\num\ni think\ndon't\nyou're in this situation because you\nwere manipulative and jealous right so i\nfeel like if you follow what olo is\nsaying it's just going to play into a\nreputation of being manipulative\nso i would not recommend that\nokay she's probably right here yeah\nbecause like when you have those\nconversations you have to deliver it\nlike you have to say the lines the way\nall oak says them if you say those lines\nin a way that a normal person says the\nlines like hey i just want to know what\nto expect from this friend group like\nit's not gonna land in the same way\num so i would not recommend that um\nthe\nthe thing is\nyou made these friends probably you're\nhalfway through university\nyeah about that okay so\ni think now is the right time to start\nbranching out\nand trying to keep the relationships you\nhave here one-on-one friendships in a\nway that lets you hold on to the people\nthat you want to hold on to\nlets the people that\nneed some distance and like frankly\naren't mature enough to navigate\nlike the complexities of having to like\npick a side\nand i think now is the time to kind of\nspread your wings\num\ni know that's so much easier said than\ndone\nbut\nto me these are like\nlearning moments really like what have\nwe learned\num yeah absolutely so what you're saying\nis find new friends or am i\nunderstanding it wrong\ni i'm saying two things i made an and\nsign because i feel like when alec and i\ntalk things get confusing i'm saying two\nthings um i'm saying one make new\nfriends and i'm saying to\nkeep out of these four keep the friends\nthat are important to you in a\none-on-one setting because i don't think\nit's too hard to\nhave built these relationships and just\nflush them down toilet\nso i don't think you should do that i\nthink you should hold on to those\nfriends and also find new friends\nyeah\ni feel like it's it's been a bit like\ni'm doing the latter thing that you said\nabout like the keeping the one-on-one\nfriendships i'm doing that but the first\nthing like\nmaking new friends i feel i felt that\nlike since the falling out i haven't\nreally been able to\nget as deep of a friendship or like get\nas close to people as\ni've been like really i've met new\npeople but i\nlike\nit's very superficial\nsorry all oak is controlling the mutes\nand it's very difficult um my question\nwas\nif um\nthese people that you're seeing that are\nsuperficial friendships are\nlike people you're just seeing in\npassing at the university or if you're\nlike socializing with them outside of\nthat\nyeah the the people that i've been\nseeing are at the university and it's\nbasically just like it's to have friends\nbasically it's just so i'm not like\nhanging around alone because like the\nfirst uh semester of this year i was\nbasically hanging around all alone\nbecause i\ndidn't have a friend group and then in\nthe second semester i like\nkind of like got my drift like uh like\ni i got back on track um\nso and and i met like some new people\njust at university but\nit's just yeah as i said to just have\nfriends basically\nit's not really like oh i really want a\ndeep connection it's just so i have so\ni'm not alone\n100 understand i think loneliness and\nisolation is\none of like\nif it's not\nthe number one it's in the top three\nthings that college students struggle\nwith i think it's loneliness and nice\nloneliness and isolation is i think\nnumber one number two is like a fear of\njudgment\num and i think the third is like stress\nmanagement so the first thing i want you\nto know is like\nyou're not alone a lot of people feel\nthis way and a lot of people are also\ntrying to make meaningful friendships\nin the same situation\num i think that\nthe\nhow did you make these friends in the\nfirst place\num well\nfirst of all it's just the university\nside that's that's a bit of a problem i\ndo have friends like outside of\nuniversity i still have friends from\nfrom middle school in high school so\nit's not necessarily that i'm that i\nreally feel alone\nit's it's just at university the union\nuniversity side is a bit but the the way\nthat i made these friends is like my\npure coincidence really\nso um like i i joined some um\nlike\nactivities that's for like the first\nyears\num like we get to know each other and\nall that\num\nand i met like one guy through that and\nthen that guy knew someone else um and\nthat was basically the friend group\nso i i think just for the record dylan i\nthink grooty's advice is way better than\nmine\nfor this one so i would definitely\nlisten to her because i think if you do\nwhat i said you're gonna drive your\nfriends away because they're not gonna\nbe able to tolerate it\nand\ni think that\nat some point\nyou've got a\nyou know you've got a\nsometimes there are situations you're 20\nso maybe not yet there are situations in\nwhich you've got to channel your inner\nchad thunder [ __ ]\nright\nyou\nthey're they're talking about here huh\nuh what are we uh i'm i'm not entirely\nsure what are we talking about here so\nso here's here's what i'd say if you\nwant if you want a softer way to talk to\nyour friends what you can sort of share\nwith them is say hey\nyou know i really miss being able to\nhang out together\nit's been really awesome that we've been\nable to maintain one-on-one\nrelationships\num i really value your friendship and i\nhope that we'll all be able to hang out\ntogether again\nyou can say something like that that's a\nlot more manageable and\ni would also say that at some point if\nyour friends are treating you like a\nsecond class citizen that you shouldn't\nput up with that\nlike there's a certain amount of like\nyou screwed up so\nyou know\nlike you should pay for that punishment\nbut at some point like if you're always\nif you're invested in this friend group\nand you care about these people\nand they're\nsure you're the guilty party\nthat that's where like understanding a\nlittle bit about like what can you\nexpect from this relationship like 10\nyears from now is one of them gonna get\nmarried because you all have been\nfriends for 10 years and you're not\ngoing to get invited to the wedding\nbecause this person is invited to the\nwedding\nright so there's a part of me that still\nis pissed off about the situation that\nyou're in and i feel like you're being\ntreated unfairly\nup to a point and i'm not saying that\nyou should lean into that now because at\n20 years old no one knows how to handle\nauthentic like\nconflict in relationships so don't do\nwhat i said and at the same time like\nover time you don't want to you don't\nwant to hang out with people who are\ngoing to perpetually\nwho for whom\nforgiveness and a repair of a\nrelationship is like not in the cards\nright you want to form friendships with\npeople who despite your mistakes\nwill be able to patch things up and if\nthe friend group that you have\nif you screw up once if you're in the\ndoghouse for the rest of your life or if\nyou get punished for the rest of your\nlife if you get treated like a\nsecond-class citizen for the rest of\nyour life that's not a friend group that\ni would want for you\ni agree the the only um\nlast thing that i want to kind of say to\nyou is about awkwardness\nand awkwardness is something you can\npush through\nlike it's gonna be awkward\nfor\none two three four parties after that\nit's just the way it is so\ni do think standing up for yourself in\nthis situation is the right thing to do\nbecause i think that if these people are\nnot going to be your friends anymore\nthis is kind of like the way you're\ngoing to know whether or not it's worth\nsalvaging those one-on-one relationships\nor the group relationship\nif if you do say like hey look i screwed\nup\ni really would like for us all to be\nfriends\nif we can do that that would make me\nreally happy and if we can't do that\nthen like i just kind of need to know so\ni can move on if i need to move on\nand i think that is\na fine\nthing to do\nwhat you need to know is that if that is\nthe approach that you take\nthere's a possibility that people will\nsay yes it's time to move on so if you\nwant to force that conversation\nyou have to know that like you can kind\nof go one of two ways\nso that's why i'm kind of\nthat's kind of like up to you on whether\nlike how strongly this is kind of\nbothering you\nbut i think um\ni think force like i wouldn't let the\nawkwardness win\nher\nher\ni would listen to her for sure\nyeah i've like sorta\nlike already sort of like had this\nconversation i mean it's not really hard\nto have this like conversation with them\nbecause there's only like\ntwo people there so they basically like\nknow everything that that happened\nbut i'm mostly worried about\nlike\nwhat because like now i'm having all\nthese like superficial friendships and\nnot real different ships i'm i'm mostly\nworried about that\nyeah so that's part of the reason that i\nwas sort of\nsaying like have an earnest conversation\nso i think one thing that it's kind of\nhard to do as human beings is like\nif we're holding space\nin our heart for lack of a better term\nfor a certain group of people sometimes\nthere is not space for other people\nand so we normally think about this in a\nromantic term in a romantic sense right\nso if i'm like still in love with my ex\nfrom 10 years ago and i never really got\nover her\nit's going to be hard for me to\nparticipate in a healthy relationship\nthe thing is i think we see that for\nwe see that for all kinds of other\nrelationships\nso we we see that for friendships we see\nthat for\nmarriages and like step children\nright if there's no space in my heart\nfor my step kids like that's not going\nto be a healthy relationship\nand so if you're sort of emotionally\ninvested in these friends it may\nactually make it a little bit harder for\nyou to make space for other people\nbut i do think one of the things that\nyou say about friendship that i i\nstrongly believe in is like a routine so\nlike if a couple of you always go for\ncoffee after this class or\nyou um\nhave like tuesday evenings you play\ntennis with this person or like some\nsort of regularity that's where i think\nyou get the most opportunity to\ndevelop\na deeper relationship when you have\nregular interactions outside of your\nkind of day-to-day\nactivities\nyeah so i would try to organize\nsomething like that\nyeah that's been kind of like happening\nwith like the one remaining event that i\nstill have from that friend group\nbut like\ni'm i'm pretty much hearing that if i\nlike want to make deeper connections\nagain it's like a situation of\njust move on\ncan i hear that correctly no it's take\nwhat's good\nabout this friend group keep that close\nto you\nand also don't be limited to just these\nfour people because also it's just for\npeople\nyeah yeah i mean yeah that's true like\nwhen\ni've been talking about this right now i\nfeel like i mean it's just for people\nlike\nthat it sounds kind of like harsh but\nthere's always like\nnew\npeople not really replacements but like\nstill there's new people\nyeah\ncool good luck to you bro\nall right yeah thanks so much for the\nadvice guys\ngoodbye\nyou"
