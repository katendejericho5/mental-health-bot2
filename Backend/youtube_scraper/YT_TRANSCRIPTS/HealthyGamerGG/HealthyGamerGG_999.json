    "transcript": "as we grow up\nwe form particular relationships\nwith things outside of us\nand what are those relationships how do\nthey form how do we change them some of\nthese baby elephant syndromes are\nvery very helpful like he's talking\nabout it like it's a bad thing that\nholds us back and the interesting thing\nis if we look at these things we may\nthink that some are better than others\nright so like neuroticism is bad the\ntendency to worry is bad so people with\nhigh neuroticism for example may be more\nprone to having anxiety disorder\nconscientiousness is good people who\nhave high conscientiousness that can put\ntheir mind to a task and do a good job\nat it like focus on it and have follow\nthrough it's kind of like follow through\nthose are better than people who have\nlow conscientiousness so we make all\nthese kinds of value judgments but the\nreally interesting thing\nis that data supports that it's not\nreally like that\n[Music]\nso here's a question do you have baby\nelephant syndrome so baby elephant\nsyndrome comes from an old story about\nsomebody who came to a circus and\nrealized that you know there's a big\npowerful elephant who was chained to\nthis tiny little rope connection there's\na little pull and he asked that you know\nthe circus ring master and says hey why\nis there you know why is the elephant\njust tied to that does an elephant know\nthat he can just like very easily break\nfree and just run away and the ring\nmaster says well as a matter of fact\nthis is how we do it you know when we\nbring in a small baby elephant we chain\nthem up to a much thicker rope to a much\nthicker pole and you know they'll pull\nand they'll try to get away and as a\nresult you know when they can't break\naway they come to realize oh i can't\nbreak away so as they grow up they stop\npulling they stop trying because they\nlearned that okay this rope is\nunbreakable so even as they grow up and\nthey change that rope to a thinner rope\nor sometimes maybe not even a rope at\nall the elephant doesn't keep trying and\nwhen we experience baby elephant\nsyndrome it's often times that you know\nwhen we were growing up our parents or\nour environment our teachers our friends\nmay have told us something about\nourselves that we took deep to heart\nyou're not good enough you're not smart\nenough you know you're ugly you're sure\nyou're whatever it is that we take on\nthese beliefs i know we never come to\nchallenge those stories in fact we just\nkind of accept it as we go on when we go\nthrough the rest of our lives thinking\nthat's who we are but we never come to\ntake a look at that we never challenge\nand reflect and say is this true and as\na matter of fact sometimes the most\npowerful smartest most incredible people\ni've met in those specific fields are\nthe people who believe they're the worst\nbecause they're the ones who've worked\nmost at it you know some of the best\nwriters i've met believe that they are\ngenuinely terrible writers because at\nsome point they met a terrible teacher\nwho said you're a bad writer you're\nnever going to be a good enough writer\nand they kept practicing and practicing\ncrappy thing anyway and those are the\nlucky ones because the unlucky ones they\nstop trying and they bury their talents\nthey bury their creativity they bury\ntheir wisdom and they never come back\nand take a look at it so challenge your\nown beliefs because otherwise you're\nnothing but a baby elephant stuck in the\nbody of a grown adult so this is really\ninteresting right because so let's talk\nabout this so there's some things i\nreally love about this and some things\nthat i think kind of concern me about\nthe self-help tick-tock generation\nso\ni'd like to kind of just share some\nthoughts about this so the first is that\nthis is a story that doesn't start with\ncircus elephants that actually starts\nin meditative traditions okay so these\nthis is a story that's been told like by\nyou know monks in india and china and\nstuff for probably india because that's\nwhere elephants were for thousands of\nyears and it illustrates the point that\nthis person is saying\nwhich is that often times when we're\ngrowing up\nwe\nform a particular belief\nand then as we grow older we don't\nchallenge that belief and it starts to\nrestrict us\nand so the general sentiment i i think\nthe story is you know largely shares the\npoint that's correct\nand the sentiment is to like challenge\nyour conceptions okay so both those\nthings i think are fantastic\nthere are a couple of things that i sort\nof have issue with\nthe first is calling this a syndrome\nso i know this sounds kind of weird but\nlike when we\nwhat a syndrome is and we'll talk a\nlittle bit about whether using language\nprecisely is good or bad\nso syndrome is a constellation of\nsymptoms\nthat\npeople share like people\nthat people share right so it's like a\ngroup of things that we group together\nand then the cool thing about the\nsyndrome is that once we recognize what\na syndrome is so major depressive\ndisorder is a syndrome adhd is a\nsyndrome\nit's a constellation of things that go\ntogether\nand when we call something a syndrome\nthe reason that's useful is if we can\nlump these things together and it's a\npattern that lots of different people\ncan relate to\nthen we can study this group of people\nbecause we're putting these people\ntogether because they share a\nconstellation of symptoms\nand then we can understand how can we\nhelp this group of people\nokay so in the case of like adhd what\nwe'll see is that there's impulsivity\nthere's a lack of attention there is\ndifficulty like adhering to stimuli or\nchanging your attention there is\nperseveration so hyper focus on a\nparticular thing or the inability to\nfocus\nand so as we start to look at all of\nthese features the more features we add\nthe more specific we can get the more we\ncan group these people together and if\nwe group these people together and we\nstudy them together we can figure out\nwhat works for these kinds of people\nand so when you call this a syndrome i'm\ncurious what are the features of the\nsyndrome\nhow do you know if you have the syndrome\nright so like this is my problem with\ncalling it a syndrome is like\nhow do you know\nwhich beliefs you should challenge which\nbeliefs make it\nbaby elephant syndrome\nright is it\na lack of con like what what are the\nbeliefs of baby elephant syndrome like\non a piece of paper like how do you know\nif you have baby elephants and trump so\nthere's something a lot of a lot of\nvalue here but this is why i think\nprecision of language is important\nbecause like how how do you know if you\nhave this so a lot of people will watch\nstuff like this and i think this is what\nhappens is that we'll put labels on\nthings that sound really good but are\nrelatively imprecise\nand when someone watches something like\nthis they'll resonate with it in some\nway right and they'll say oh i have baby\nelephant syndrome but what are the\nfeatures of baby elephant syndrome\nwhat's the challenge your beliefs like\nwhich are the beliefs that you should\nchallenge because the whole point\nis that in baby elephant syndrome the\nbeliefs are so deep rooted that they're\nnot beliefs they're facts\nright i can't escape from the pain this\nis a feature of life\nand the whole problem with baby elephant\nsyndrome is that we are inherently\nblinded to our conceptions\nso like what are which are the beliefs\nlike\nyou know how how do you diagnose someone\nwith baby elephant syndrome\nso what maybe the way that i understand\nthe way it's taught in in the east is\nthat this is not a syndrome it's not a\ncollection of\nsymptoms it's a feature of the mind so\nthe best analogy that i can kind of\nthink of is like in\nmathematics we have formulas right so we\nhave y equals mx plus b and then we have\ncore concepts like arithmetic or\naddition\nand a syndrome is like a formula it's\nlike y equals mx plus b it's a specific\nrepresentation of reality\nand then you have the core features of\nmathematics like arithmetic equals\ndivision parentheses\nyou know like\nexponentials\nand so this is a core feature of the\nmind it's like the plus sign it's not\nactually the equation and this is like\nmaybe i'm just being like academic and\nbeing kind of judgmental here but in my\nopinion it's very under it's very\nimportant to draw the distinction\nbetween what is a formula like adhd\nequals impulsivity plus this plus this\nplus this versus how does our mind\nfundamentally work and this was a\ndiscovery from sort of like the yogic\ntradition because they were looking at\nthe features of the mind so what the\nmain discovery is is it's not a syndrome\nit's not like a particular thing it's\njust how our mind works and the basic\nidea is that we internalize particular\nbeliefs and we operate as if these are\ntrue so in cognitive behavioral therapy\nthis is what we call schemas\nokay so these are things like an object\nrelations theory so there's a whole\nbranch of psychoanalysis called called\nobject relations theory which sort of is\nessentially an exploration of the baby\nelephant principle\nwhich is how do we as we grow up\nwe form particular relationships with\nthings outside of us\nand what are those relationships how do\nthey form how do we change them it's not\nyou know so there's like a lot of\nspecificity here that becomes really\nimportant because i think the real\nchallenge with something like this is\nlike\nwhat is your peg\nright what is the thing that you're\nactually shackled to and i don't get any\nsense that it's clear\nright from this like i don't know how to\ngroup people into baby elephant syndrome\nbecause it's a principle of every single\nmind\nthere are a couple of other important\nthings that we have to be careful about\nso this person said that oftentimes the\nmost successful people that they've met\nhave issues like this like low\nself-esteem\nand this is where what we've got to\nunderstand is that\nsome of these baby elephant syndromes\nare\nvery very helpful like he's talking\nabout it like it's a bad thing that\nholds us back\nbut if you look at studies of five\nfactor personality analysis of doctors\nokay\nso remember the five factor personality\nanalysis or a system is like probably\nthe best scientifically validated system\nof personality okay so it's based on a\nlot of research as opposed to like\ntheory or ideas\nand what they sort of found is that\nthere are five factors there's\nconscientiousness neuroticism openness\nagreeableness and extroversion so these\nare kind of the five dimensions so\nconscientiousness is your ability to\nlike sit down and focus on a task\nneuroticism is your tendency to worry\num agreeableness is your tendency to get\nalong or not get along with other people\nlike how willing are you to adapt your\nbeliefs to what other people want\nopenness is your openness or close\nclose-mindedness to new ideas and\nconcepts\nand uh extroversion is like how you\nrelate to other people whether you're\nkind of a loner or you're like you enjoy\nspending time with others\nand the interesting thing is if we look\nat these things we may think that some\nare better than others right so like\nneuroticism is bad the tendency to worry\nis bad so people with high neuroticism\nfor example may be more prone to have an\nanxiety disorder conscientiousness is\ngood people have high conscientiousness\ncan put their mind to a task and do a\ngood job at it like focus on it and have\nfollow-through it's kind of like\nfollow-through those are better than\npeople who have low conscientiousness\nso we make all these kinds of value\njudgments but the really interesting\nthing\nis that data supports that it's not\nreally like that okay\nso for example if you look at medical\nstudents\nwhat you find is that medical students\nand doctors have high conscientiousness\nand high neuroticism\nthat high neuroticism and the tendency\nto worry actually correlates with higher\nperformance\nso i was i was listening to a really\ninteresting story the other day of\nsomeone who was working in amazon\nand they were giving a presentation\nand\none of their superiors who's a very\nprominent person in amazon was there and\nthe presentation did not go well\nand so\nthey were really concerned about it and\nit kind of looked bad\nand so the\ntheir\nboss's boss was basically saying he was\nlike i'm not worried about this\nand the reason why is because i can\nclearly see that you are worried about\nit\nand so\nbeing worried about something like they\nbasically knew it was going to get taken\ncare of because\nsomeone is clearly worried about it\nso worrying about things and thinking\nthat you're insufficient and lacking\nconfidence in yourself can actually\ncorrelate with\nexternal success\nso this is the weird thing about baby\nelephant syndrome is we may think\nthat we should get rid of it but let's\nunderstand that it's responsible for\nsomeone being a best-selling author\nit's responsible for someone being an\nexcellent artist\nright it's the sense of inadequacy is\nwhat drives us forward\nthe reason that the medical student ends\nup as a medical student is because when\nthey were in college and everyone else\nis out partying on friday night at 8 pm\nthey were worried about not getting an a\non the test so their asses were in the\nlibrary and they were studying\nand so what does that mean for us\nright so if you're someone who's got low\nself-esteem if you're someone who uses\nthe relentless whip\nof not being good enough to excel and if\nyou all have seen our our interviews\nwith like people like you know streamers\nand stuff who are very successful i'm\nthinking of like amaranth for example\namaranth is like one of the hardest\nworkers that i've ever met and it's\nbecause on some level she felt at some\npoint it was years ago that she needed\nto do better right and it drives us\nforward relentlessly\nand it drives us to succeed\nso the challenge is that when we talk\nabout something like this like baby\nelephant syndrome there's sort of this\nidea\nthat getting rid of it is good which\ngenerally speaking i agree with\nbut there's a huge huge problem with\nthis which oftentimes causes people to\nstumble as they'll see something like\nthis and they'll think like oh my god\nlike i should be more confident in\nmyself like i should like stop pushing\nmyself so hard because i am okay and my\nparents taught me that i'm not okay\nand then what happens when you try to\nget that person to accept themselves do\ny'all know\nwhat happens\nwhen you try to help them attain\nself-acceptance\nthey resist it\nthey fight it at every single step\nright they may say they'll watch a tick\ntock and they'll say like oh this is me\nbut deep down\nthey're against it 100\nand why is that\nit's because it's what's responsible for\ntheir success\nright\nlike what you're telling me because\nhere's the thing if you relentlessly\ndrive yourself forward towards success\nand you start accepting yourself\nwhat does that mean about your ambitions\nwhat does that mean about your\nprofessional success\nyou're emptying your gas tank poking a\nhole in it\nit's what drives you forward\nright so baby elephant syndrome is a\nlittle bit more complicated the first\nthing is that i don't know which\ninternal beliefs what's the stake what's\nthe rope i don't know\nright so the general principle is 100\ncorrect that our brain internalizes\nbeliefs and we continue to operate based\non them like gravity is a good example\nof this\nwhen we're two our brain internalizes a\nconcept of gravity and then concludes\nthat we can't fly\nright\nand so there are all kinds of things\nlike value like what's important what\nfamily means there are all kinds of\nother things that will internalize too\nlike what is the relationship between a\nhusband and a wife\ndoes a marriage compose of a husband and\na wife\nand a lot of the times the way that we\nbehave in relationships are internalized\nbased on what we saw our parents do\nso who did the dishes\nwho cooked\nso these are all things that we\ninternalize\nso which ones should you challenge which\nones are you holding holding you back i\ndon't know\nbecause it's not a real syndrome right a\nsyndrome is a constellation of things\nthis is a principle of the mind which\nyou should absolutely understand but i\ndon't think that it's a bad thing right\nit's just how we work should you\nchallenge some of those beliefs\nabsolutely but how do you figure out\nwhich challenge which ones to challenge\nthe ones that you figure out which ones\nare the challenge are the ones that\nthe situations\nthat bring you unhappiness\nso here's what i'd say about how to\napproach baby elephant syndrome\nthe first is if you're unhappy with\nsomething\nif there's something about your life\nthat you wish were different\nconsider this principle consider how\nmuch of my current situation\nis because of a belief that i hold which\ni take for granted and even then it's\ngoing to be really hard to see this is\nwhy most of these revelations happen\nwith someone else\nso like we see this a lot in coaching or\nin therapy or things like that where it\ntakes an external person to point out to\nyou\nhey wait a minute\nyou're having trouble with your\nrelationships because you're giving\npeople a cold shoulder after a\nperception that someone doesn't text you\nback right away\nmaybe that's the problem\nright like it requires some degree of\nsophistication to see what the actual\nproblem is\nthe second thing to remember is that the\nstake in the rope serves an important\npurpose\nyour brain wouldn't have picked it up\nunless it did something for you\nand if you really want to overcome it\nyou really have to acknowledge that it's\nnot just\na stake in a rope it's also an anchor\nright\nit's like a home base it's a nest\nit's all of those things it does\nsomething for you it's comfortable it's\nfamiliar it feels safe\nand if you try to uproot it\nyou may be surprised because you uproot\nit and then you don't even walk anywhere\nright because like this is what you've\ndone to survive\nso i'll ask people like you know\nare you willing to accept yourself and\nthe vast majority of the people are like\nhell no\nthey come and they say i want to learn\nhow to accept myself better as we start\ntalking through what are the\nconsequences of you accepting yourself\nand people think oh like i'm going to\nlose my ambition\nand they're like\ni don't want to i work too much i have\nno work-life balance\nthere's another really common one i have\nno work-life balance i need work-life\nbalance\nokay if you have more work-life balance\nyou know what that means right you're\ngoing to work less yeah i need to work\nless\nokay\nso like your chances of promotion are\ngoing to be lower your bonus may be\nsmaller\nwhat\ni can't handle that you're crazy\ndon't want to work less i need those\nthings\nbecause they make choices for a reason\nthere's consequences to work-life\nbalance you know the consequence to\nbuilding work-life balances\nyou have to sacrifice your work and\npeople like oh i love sacrificing work\nbut when it comes down to it like do you\nwhat actually motivates you\nright like why do you think your\nwork-life balance got out of whack in\nthe first place\nand this is where like sometimes it gets\nweird and psychological\nit's like yeah my parents are nobel\nprize winning scientists\nand i decided to become an artist\nand so work-life balance for me is like\ni can't give it up because i have to\nprove to them that art is a real career\nbecause they didn't tell they said that\nlike i should go into a stem field\nbecause there's no way like\neffort like there's no way i'm going to\nbe a disappointment to them i'm going to\nshow them and work-life balance means\ngiving that up\nproving your parents that you made the\nright decision like people aren't\nwilling to do that\nso when we're held back by something\nunderstand first of all that it's not\njust a chain\nit's also security it's also fuel\nand you have to explore that to really\ngive it up\nbecause just recognizing oh this is\nwhat's been holding me back sometimes\nthat can help right it can help a lot so\ni'm not saying it doesn't what i'm my\npoint here is that baby elephant\nsyndrome makes it sound like it's a\nconstellation of things for there's a\none-size-fits-all answer and my whole\npoint is that there's a lack of\ngranularity with that concept\nand that the general principle is\ncorrect but why did the brain form that\nassociation in the first place what does\nthat association do for you what are the\nadvantages that you have to give up\nby getting rid of the baby elephant\nsyndrome\nthose are the things that you really\nhave to think about\nand so if you want to change challenge\none of these beliefs you know it's hard\nto sort of figure it out because you're\nblind to it that's kind of the nature of\nthe the problem right\nbut even if you find one it's not going\nto be so easy to give up because there\nare all kinds of associations with it\nthere are all kinds of things that this\nthing gives you it gives you security it\nlets you be promoted it gives you a\nsense of satisfaction when you're the\none who gets into medical school and\nyou're one of the 15 percent of\napplicants who actually gets in\nthere's no way you're going to be in\nthat 85 are you kidding me\nself acceptance\nand be one of these noobs that didn't\nget in f that\nright\nso if it is causing you problems what do\nyou do the good news\nis that often times and generally\nspeaking i've noticed this especially\nfor ambition\nthere are alternatives\nthat if you let go of your ambition it\ndoesn't mean that your work ethic has to\ngo away\noftentimes the other interesting thing\nis that they assume that ambition equals\nwork ethic but if you've been trained\nsome amount of work ethic through\nambition and you let go of your ambition\nthe work ethic isn't going to just\ndisappear with it\nright that's a habit that you've borne\nin so oftentimes here's what i found\nwith these people\nthe first is that they overvalue the\ncontribution of ambition\nto their performance\nand that oftentimes their performance is\nthere's a certain independence to it\nthat's free of your ambition the second\nthing is you can still care about stuff\nwithout personal ambition so this is\nwhere you can\nreally i think the best performance\ncomes from not ambition but actually\ncomes from like the flow state and a\nsense of service and so why is a sense\nof service correlated with the flow\nstate is because the flow state is free\nof the ego\nambition is tied to the ego i want to\naccomplish this\nand the best work actually happens when\nyou're free of ego\nwhen you remove yourself with from the\nequation you become one with the thing\nthat you are doing\nyou are no longer the writer\nlike the thing like the book is coming\nout of you\nyou're like channeling this this book\nlike\nthere's a story within you that needs to\nbe told you are a conduit for this like\nmusic that is coming from some weird\ndimension\nand this is what my experience has been\nwith people who are\nathletes esports athletes and creative\npeople\nright that when you enter the flow state\neven coders\nwhen you enter that flow state you\ndisappear your ambition disappears and\nyou're just like it you see it and the\ncode fits together and you know how to\nmake it happen\nand all of the accolades all of the\npride all of the good job bro like all\nthat leaves your mind and then you\nactually reach the heights of\nperformance\nso here's the bitter pill\nabout ambition and some of this\nself-flagellation and and elephant\nsyndrome\nis that elephant syndrome will get you\nfrom zero to ninety percent\nbut if you wanna go from 90 to 100 you\nhave to let it go\nwhich is the most terrifying thing\nbecause it's gotten you to 90 right\nand so recognize that it's terrifying\nbut if you really want to go that extra\nlevel this is where i agree with this\nguy too because he's sort of saying you\nneed to move past this right and i think\nhe's right\nhe knows what he's talking about\nsome of that is i think the consequence\nof tick-tock which is like you just\ncan't go into this nuance\nbut if you want to go that next step you\nwant to go that next level you have to\nbecome one with the object\nthis is also what is called dian\nin sanskrit\nso this is why i think terminology is\nimportant because the more precise your\nterminology the more you can understand\nand differentiate between things\nso beyond is when one becomes absorbed\nwith the object of meditation\nwhen you become one with the thing\nand that is the first step that is\nactually the meditative state when\npeople say i had a good i had an awesome\nmeditation yesterday what the hell are\nthey talking about they're talking about\na state of absorption of their mind with\nthe object of meditation where they\ndisappear\nand if you practice being in that state\nyou can go one step further into samadhi\nwhich is temporary enlightenment\nso someone's saying i hit deon running\nall the time completely agree\nso marathon runners are the people the\npeople who have been the easiest to\nteach meditation to because they're\nalready familiar with it\nokay but if future orientation\ncorrelated with ambition is bad then why\ndoes it work so well for a lot of people\ni never said it was bad\nremember quite the opposite\nambition is what gets you from zero to\nninety percent that's why it's so\npopular because it works\nit's the easiest way to become\nsuccessful\nbut it comes at a cost\ni do think there are better ways to do\nit they're just harder and it caps out\nsomewhere\nright because the problem with ambition\nis the price you pay for success is your\nhappiness when you're ambitious\nyou may say what does that mean the\nprice you prefe pay for success is\nhappiness like what that's ridiculous\nyou talk to people who are ambitious\nwhen they achieve are they content no\nare they happy no\ni made a hundred thousand dollars this\nyear\nnext year it's going to be 200.\ni got promoted am i content no\ni'm going to celebrate a little bit it's\nback to the grind back to the hustle\nthere's always more there's always more\nthat's the problem with ambition\nso contentment and ambition\nare opposites right like we think of\nthem as like if i'm content that means\ni'm not ambitious that's the mistake\nthat they make\nso you can still be content and work\nhard that's the thing that people don't\nunderstand is there are alternatives to\nambition i think service is the number\none thing to think of\nright you can work really hard not for\nyourself for other people\nlike and that's incredibly fulfilling\nmakes you happy and causes your work\nethic to be awesome\nyou"
