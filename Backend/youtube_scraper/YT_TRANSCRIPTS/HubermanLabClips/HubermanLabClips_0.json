    "transcript": "one of the mysteries about\ndepression is that uh it's not that\ntractable to pharmacological therapy so\nif you look at people who suffer with\ndepression about a third of people see\nsignificant benefit from Modern\nSSRI and related anti-depressant drugs\nuh about a third see see very tiny\nbenefit and about a third SE no\nbenefit at all and part of the reason is\nbecause maybe our term depression is too\nbig a bucket depression is actually many\ndifferent biological disorders and only\na subset of those are are helped by\nssris and we'll need different therapies\nfor the other ones that's certainly part\nof it um but part of it might actually\nhave to do with inflammation so if you\nthink that inflammation is a a risk\nfactor in depression well you could do\nsomething very simple right you could\nyou could gobble an ibuprofen right\nthere's a whole bunch of\nanti-inflammatory drugs that are very\nwell understood and so well what if you\njust say all right you know uh let's\nhave a study where we have a bunch of\ndepressed people and we have them all\neat anti-inflammatory drugs for a few\nweeks and we see if this relieved their\ndepression and the answer seems to be\nno it doesn't well and that's\nthat's a little bit hard to understand\nbecause there are definitely\nlinks between inflammation and\ndepression so for example one of the\nearly treatments for uh for Hepatitis C\nthat's since been superseded by more\nmodern drugs was a pro-inflammatory cyto\nkind molecule and when you gave it to\npeople to treat their hepatitis C almost\neveryone became depressed on this drug\nso oh well this really seems like like\nlike a link likewise there are certain\nuh neurological diseases like multiple\nsclerosis it turns out the incidence of\ndepression as a comorbidity in multiple\nsclerosis is enormous and you might\nthink well there's a trivial reason for\nthat if you're paralyzed from Ms you're\nbummed out about life and that's the\nreason but if you look at people who\nhave spinal cord injuries from accidents\nthey actually have major depression at a\nat a at a rate from people who are\nuninjured so that doesn't seem to be it\nit's not just that you're bummed out\nfrom being paralyzed although of course\nit's reasonable to be bummed out about\nbeing paralyzed but that's not it so\nwhat happens in Ms well there's a bunch\nof cyto kindes including one called\ninterlan 6 I 6 that's elevated massively\nif you if you take a spinal tap and you\nlook at cereal spinal fluid and so that\ncould be causitive for depression so all\nthese real re reasons to think that\ninflammation is involved but yet the\nidea is still a bit messy so now what if\ninstead of looking at the general\npopulation of depress people you look at\nthe subset of people that don't respond\nto SSRI anti-depressants are they helped\nby anti-inflammatories and there there's\na bit of a hint that maybe they are it's\nnot definitive yet there are a couple of\nstudies it's it's it's right on the edge\nbut I think this is a really good\nexample of how we are going to see\nprogress very soon in the body body to\nmind part of Mind Body medicine that is\ngoing to be of\nenormous uh benefit to people so\ninteresting could I get your thoughts on\none candidate hypothesis that I've been\nthinking about I've covered depression\non a few episodes and um I've had Robin\ncardart Harris um from UCSF and Dr\nMatthew Johnson from your very own John\nHopkins University both of whom work run\nLaboratory studying psychedelics for the\ntreatment of depression M um the\nclinical trials on Sil cybin um and to\nbe clear cybin still illegal it's been\ndecriminalized a few places but we're\nnot talking about recreational use we're\ntalking about several therapy sessions\nand then two without psilocybin then two\num 2.5 gram approximately dosages of\npsilocybin given separately again with\ntherapist present and then follow-up\ntherapy sessions seem to lead to relief\nof depression in approximately somewhere\nbetween 65 and 80% of people um in some\ncases total remission and some cases um\nsome relief without remission okay so we\ncan kind of set that result on the Shelf\nit's been repeated a number of different\ntimes compare that to the results of\nssris which seem to help a third of\npeople a third minimally and a third not\nat all and of course there's the side\neffect profiles of the ssris and\nAssociated drugs not just the ssris but\nBryon and the other anti-depressants uh\nthat are taken in prescription drug form\nand then there's this uh inflammation\npiece so could we hypothesize that\nrelief from depression has something to\ndo with neuroplasticity rewiring of\nneural circuits and that psilocybin we\nknow can encourage\nneuroplasticity and that perhaps ssris\ncan encourage neuroplasticity in some\npeople not all and that inflammation is\na barrier to neuroplasticity\num to me this is the only thing that can\nreconcile the the current status of the\nof the results and then there's ketamine\nbased therapies and so we have to also\nkind of set that on the Shelf but let's\nset that aside on the shelf for now to\nkeep it simple um it seems to me that\nbased on the time course over which\nssris work the fact that they increase\nserotonin uh very quickly but the relief\nfrom depression comes much later the\nfact that neuromodulators like serotonin\nare intimately involved in\nneuroplasticity they can in some cases\ngate neuroplasticity that it all centers\nback to changing neural circuits and so\nwhat we're really trying to do whether\nor not it's transrenal magnetic\nstimulation or now we can throw ketamine\nin there or psilocybin or ssris we're\nthat treating depression is about\nrewiring the brain it's not about\nchemical A or B per se although\nserotonin seems\ninvolved to me what I'd love to see is\nare more studies about the interaction\nbetween neuroplasticity and inflammation\nand are we seeing that kind of work out\nthere and um because these results sort\nof sit as disperate somewhat conflicting\nbut it seems like inflammation is is\nanti- neuroplasticity and broadly\nspeaking here I realize there are many\ninter lucans there are many you know\nsome of which are inflammatory some of\nwhich are anti-inflammatory but is that\nis that a meaningful hypothesis and um\ncan do you think there's any hope\nwhatsoever to actually cure depression\nif we if we sort of start to uh uh unify\nthe the results in these different camps\nyeah I think it's a completely\nreasonable hypothesis and I would be\nbroader and I would say honestly the\nrelief of any Neuropsychiatric condition\nultimately is from neuroplasticity in\nsome form or another and I think it's\nworthwhile to step back a bit and talk\nabout what neuroplasticity means uh to\ndate there has\nbeen a focus on synapses on the contacts\nbetween neurons as the site of\nneuroplasticity and that\nwarranted synapses are plastic they\nchange as a result of experience as a\nresult of hormone changes as a result of\nexercise as a result of lots of things\nbut synapses are not the Beall and end\nall of neural function so for example\nneurons work by sending electrical\nsignals uh uh along their lengths and\nand between neurons and interconverting\nthose with chemical signals and the\nprocesses of of generating those\nelectrical signals the ion channels that\nare involved that are embedded in\nmembranes that are involved in that are\nalso plastic they can also change as a\nresult of experience that's what we call\nintrinsic plasticity as opposed to\nsynaptic plasticity in addition there\nare literal morphological changes so\nwhen we talk about the wiring of the\nbrain sometimes we're talking about\nliteral wiring like cell a wasn't\nconnected to cell b and now it is and\nthat changes and then sometimes well\nactually cell a was connected to cell b\nbut cell b wasn't responsive enough and\nnow there's a change in cell b so now\ncell a can fire cell b and that could\nhave been a result of a change in its\nsynapse making it more receptive to a\ntransmitter released from cell a or it\ncould be something intrinsic in cell a\nthat makes it fire its electrical signal\nits Spike more easily I think that one\nof the key cell types that's going to be\nimportant for your\nhypothesis um linking inflammation to\nsynaptic plasticity is going to be a\ncell called a micral cell and micral\ncells are non neuronal cells in the\nbrain they're motile they can crawl\naround they have long processes and they\ncan gobble things up they can literally\nsort of chew away and Digest bits of the\nextracellular scaffolding that surrounds\nneurons and synapses and thereby renders\nthem plastic they can uh destroy\nsynapses and there is a lot of\nindication that certain disease States\nmay involve over exuberant microa\npruning synapses to a degree that they\nshouldn't and we know that microa are\nchock full of cyto receptors and so are\nresponsive to inflammatory signals when\nwe're talking about inflammation and\nwe're talking about drugs it's\nworthwhile to mention that there are a\nlot of Behavioral things that also can\ninfluence the signaling so we know and I\nknow you've discussed on your program\nthe incredibly salubrious effects of\nphysical exercise on mental function so\nexercise is about as good an\nanti-depressant as SS RIS are and the\nside effects are only good side effects\nas opposed to the bad side effects of\nssris and again this isn't working\nthrough some Ayer realm the reason that\nExercise Works to relieve depression and\nthe reason that Exercise Works to\nmaintain your cognitive function as you\nage is because of biological Pathways\nthat we are now uncovering some of which\nwill involve micro Gil cells and neurons\nand other types of cells in the brains\nsome of which will involve not the\nneurons in the brain at all but the\nbrain's vasculature so we know that\nexercise is very salubrious for keeping\nblood flowing to the brain and when\nyou're young you have a super abundance\nof blood flowing to your brain so it\ndoesn't matter if it's reduced\ntransiently you're fine but as you get\nolder uh your blood vessels become more\nuded and less elastic and you're closer\nto the to the to the trouble spot uh and\nif you exercise regularly you can dilate\nand make your blood vessels including\nthose in your brain more elastic and\nthat is almost certainly protective\nagainst both depression and cognitive\ndecline uh as we\nage"
