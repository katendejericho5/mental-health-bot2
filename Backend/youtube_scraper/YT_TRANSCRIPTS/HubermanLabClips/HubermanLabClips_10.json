    "transcript": "Let's talk about working memory.\nSome years back, but still now,\nyou use working memory\ntasks and experiments\nin your laboratory.\nIf you would be so kind as to explain\nwhat working memory is,\nand then I'd love to talk about\nsome of the work you've done\nexploring the role of\ndopamine in working memory,\nbecause this is so\ncritical to everyday life.\nAnd I know dopamine's a bit\nof a buzzword these days,\nbut the listeners of this podcast anyway\nare pretty sophisticated\nin terms of knowing that dopamine\nis not just about reward;\nit's about motivation and\ngoal-directed behavior.\nAnd I think dopamine\nintrigues for a good reason,\nthat it does govern a lot of\nour, you know, quality of life.\nSo what's working memory?\nYeah, I mean, working\nmemory, it's interesting,\nI started studying it about 30 years ago\nand I don't think I realized\nhow important it was when I started.\nBut what we mean by working memory\nis this ability to hold\ninformation in mind\nwhen it's no longer accessible to us.\nSo if you tell me your telephone number\nand I have to put it into my phone,\nyou know, it's no longer\nthere, you just told me,\nbut I'll hold it in my working memory\nuntil I can punch it into my phone.\nIt doesn't have to be something\nthat comes from the outside world.\nI could hold up a, you\nknow, I can pull up my own,\nif I'm filling out a form\nand I want to pull up my\nsocial security number,\nI can hold that in mind\ntoo until I put it down.\nSo when you think about it,\nit's a very important, you\nknow, ability that we have\nthat we do very flawlessly.\nAnd what I've learned\nmore about working memory\nis the working part of it.\nIt's not just this passive\nholding information in mind,\nbut it's being able to do\nthings with the information.\nIt's being able to, you know,\nwhen we do a math problem,\nwhich we don't do that much\nnow that we have calculators,\nbut if you do that in your head,\nyou're able to sort of\nmanipulate the information\nand do the different parts of the problem.\nOr even if, you know, you're trying\nto find someone in a crowd\nand you're holding onto some face,\nyou're able to hold that face in mind\nand crosscheck it and search.\nAnd so there's operations\nto working memory.\nIt's not just,\nyou know, it's not just\nthis passive maintenance.\nSo when we started to\nthink about working memory\nin that way,\nwe started to realize\nhow important it is for,\nyou know, I think of it as\nthe foundation for cognition.\nJust think about reading comprehension.\nYou can't understand this conversation\nif you can't hold in mind what's going on,\nyou know, earlier in the conversation,\nor when you're reading a book,\nyou know, remembering\nthe sentence before it.\nSo it just predicts all these abilities\nthat allows us to read,\nto plan, to organize,\nand all the sort of executive functions\nthat we're doing, right?\nWe have to hold in mind rules,\nwe have to hold in mind goals,\nwe have to hold in mind\nall of these things\nin order to just carry out behavior.\nYou know, so it's really come a long way\nin terms of how people\nare thinking about it.\nI know that Matt Walker said\nthat, like, you know,\nsleep is our superpower,\nbut I guess one way to\nsort of use his term,\nwhile we're awake, working\nmemory is really our superpower\nbecause it allows us to\ntranslate, as we said,\nsort of our knowledge into action\nby holding this information in mind\nas we're thinking about\nwhat we want to do.\nIf we're going to think about dopamine\nin the context of working memory,\nis dopamine an accelerator\non working memory?\nIs it a facilitator?\nI mean, what is dopamine\ndoing for working memory?\nAnd maybe we could talk a\nlittle bit about the circuitry.\nI've talked about dopamine\nbefore on this podcast,\nbut there's a good chance\nthat some of the people listening to this\nhaven't heard those episodes.\nSo maybe we could just quickly review\nthe three major circuits for dopamine\nand the one that's relevant\nfor working memory.\nYeah, let me start with\nthe working memory,\nthe circuitry for working memory,\nbecause one of the important\nthings about working memory\nis the other type of\nmemory is long-term memory.\nWorking memory's short lived.\nIt's only as long as\nyou're able to rehearse it\nand then it disappears.\nWhereas what we call long-term memory,\nremembering what you had for\nbreakfast or your vacation,\nthis is information that gets consolidated\nand gets put into a more durable form\nthat we call long-term memory.\nAnd the interesting thing about memory\nis that these are separate systems.\nEverything from working memory\njust doesn't pass into long-term memory.\nThey're two completely different systems\nand two completely\ndifferent parts of the brain\nthat seem to control it.\nSo working memory, the\nfrontal cortex seems\nto be very important for working memory.\nWhen we are holding information in line,\nthe neurons, the brain cells\nin the frontal lobes are active\nand they stay kind of active\nas long as we're holding\nonto that information.\nAnd they're more active when\nthe information is relevant.\nAnd if we get distracted,\nthey'll get less active.\nSo it kind of, the frontal\nlobes kind of track your,\nyou know, track the memory\nthat you're holding in mind.\nAnother important thing\nabout the circuitry\nis that if we're holding\nin mind, say, digits,\nyou know, the phone number,\nwell, that information's\nin your back of the brain.\nAnd so the frontal lobes is\nsort of keeping information\nin the back of the brain active\nbecause it's connected\nto the visual areas.\nIt's able to sort of keep\nthat information active.\nAnd so what we've learned\nis that there's not these\nbuffers in the brain\nwhere, you know, if you're\nholding verbal information,\nit's in this little buffer,\nand if you're holding visual information,\nit's in another buffer.\nThe whole brain acts as a buffer.\nAnd the frontal lobe can\ncall up any part of the brain\nand keep that part of the brain active,\nyou know, as it's trying to\nhold this information in line.\nSo the mechanism for working memory\nis just this persistent neural activity\nwithin the frontal lobes.\nAnd so then the question\nis, what does dopamine do?\nWell, dopamine is one\nof the neuromodulators\nthat are made in the brainstem\nand it projects up to\ndifferent parts of the brain.\nThere's a system that goes up\ninto what we call the basal ganglia,\nwhich is important for motor function.\nAnd there's another dopaminergic system\nthat goes up to the frontal lobes.\nAnd what was discovered was\nthat if you deplete dopamine,\nworking memory drops.\nYou get a significant\nimpairment in working memory\nif you deplete dopamine,\nand if you replace it,\nthen your working memory will be improved.\nAnd so dopamine seems to be a modulator\nto help this persistent\nactivity stay persistent,\nyou know, during the time\nthat you need to keep\nthis information in mind.\nAm I reaching too far to draw an analogy\nbetween dopamine's role in working memory,\nthat is, to keep information online,\nand the other established\nrole of dopamine,\nwhich is for movement,\nfor the generation of smooth movement,\nas evidenced by conditions\nlike Parkinson's\nwhere people lack dopaminergic neurons\nor have damage to dopaminergic neurons\nand have, you know, challenges\nin generating smooth movement?\nWhat I'm essentially asking is,\ncan we think of dopamine as\nfacilitating physical movement\nthrough one circuit,\nbut also kind of mental movement,\nthought movement kind of,\nI'm thinking about,\nfor those just listening and not watching,\nI'm kind of rubbing my\nindex and middle finger\nagainst my thumb,\njust keeping something online.\nIt's sort of a movement\nof thought or information\nand then you kind of chuck it away\nand bring out the next information.\nIs that-\nYeah, I think that's a good\nway of thinking about it.\nAnd one might wonder,\n\"Well, how can dopamine\nbe important for memory\nbut also be important for movement?\"\nAnd it's really simple.\nIt's just that it's acting\non different circuits.\nThe neurons that go to the motor areas\nthat carry dopamine will,\nwhen dopamine is expressed\nthere and boosted there,\nthen it will be involved in movement.\nAnd lack of dopamine in the basal ganglia\nwill lead to neurological\ndisorders like Parkinson's disease\nthat has severe movement difficulty.\nBut when it's acting in the frontal cortex\nand expressed in the frontal cortex,\nthen it's going to improve working memory.\nSo it's just the nature\nof where the circuits are,\nwhere the dopamine is,\nthat's allowing it to have\ndifferent kinds of actions.\nAnd that's for all transmitters.\nThe reason why acetylcholine\nseems to be more important\nfor long-term memory\nis because it's projecting\nto the hippocampus,\nwhich, as we know, is another area\nthat's important for memory,\nand that's why acetylcholine\ndoesn't boost your working memory,\nbut dopamine does, and vice versa.\nSo drilling a little bit more deeply\ninto the role of dopamine\nin working memory,\nyou did some really lovely experiments\nshowing that if people who\nhave low levels of dopamine\nincrease their dopamine pharmacologically,\nI think the drug that was\nused was bromocriptine,\nthat working memory improves.\nConversely, if one depletes\ndopamine pharmacologically,\nworking memory gets worse.\nBut as I recall, there\nwas an important baseline\nthat is important\nbecause it really mattered\nin terms of the outcome.\nMeaning if somebody already\nhad relatively high levels\nof dopamine in this circuit,\nincreasing dopamine\nfurther with bromocriptine\ndidn't impart a benefit\nand might have even made\ntheir work in memory worse.\nSo there's a kind of inverted\nU-shape function to this.\nHow does one know whether or\nnot their baseline dopamine\nis low, medium, or high?\nErgo, how do they know whether or not\nthey would want to explore\ngoing about increasing dopamine\nthrough any number of\ndifferent approaches?\nRight.\nWell, most people probably\nhave optimal dopamine,\nbut there's a significant percentage\nthat probably have too\nlittle or maybe too much.\nUnfortunately, we can't\nmeasure it in the blood.\nThere isn't a blood test that I'm aware of\nthat can measure dopamine\nbecause it's stuck in the brain.\nPeripheral dopamine in the\nblood is not a good readout.\nIt's not a good readout, yeah.\nAnd especially when you're\ntalking about dopamine\nin areas like prefrontal cortex.\nAnd so we don't have a good readout there.\nThere's invasive procedures\nlike positron emission tomography\nwhere we can inject a\nradioisotope that tags dopamine\nand then we can measure how much,\nwe can do a scan that actually\nshows us how much dopamine.\nThis scan was originally developed\nto show Parkinson's disease.\nYou can diagnose Parkinson's disease\nby showing that there's less dopamine\nin patients that have Parkinson's\nby looking at this scan.\nObviously it's invasive.\nYou're injecting a radioisotope.\nIt's expensive and it's not\nsomething we could all do.\nBut we had used it to show that\nit correlates very strongly\nwith your working memory capacity.\nSo how much information\nyou can hold online,\nif you can hold four\nor five or six letters\nwhen I do a span task\ncorrelated with how\nmuch dopamine we can see\nin the PET scan.\nSo that would be a way\nthat we could do it.\nSo if you were to read out\na string of a few numbers or letters\nand I can remember all of\nthose a few moments later,\nperhaps, perhaps, my baseline\ndopamine levels are moderate,\nin the normal range,\nwhereas if I couldn't keep that online,\nthat might be reflective of\nlower baseline dopamine levels.\nIs that right?\nYeah, it's a very strong\nproxy for dopamine.\nSo if your working memory capacity\nis seven letters or numbers,\nwhen I say four, three,\nseven, one, five, zero, six,\nif you get the-\nFour, three, seven, five, zero, six.\nGet them all back very quickly,\nyou probably have more baseline dopamine\nthan someone who has five.\nSo it's a proxy for\nmeasuring someone's dopamine.\nSo that's one way of doing it.\nAnd that's actually how we did\nit in our original studies.\nWe actually grouped individuals\nbased on whether their capacity,\nbased on this behavioral measure,\nwas high or low.\nAnd like you said,\nthose that could only\nhold five or six letters,\nif we gave them bromocriptine,\nwhich was the dopaminergic agonist,\nwe improved their working memory.\nWe got them into sort of an optimal level.\nBut those who were already\nhigh, we actually made them,\nwe got them worse.\nAnd the moral of that story\nwas that more is just not better.\nWe're trying to get people optimal.\nAnd so the real question\nis, you know, if we want\nto get people optimal,\nlike you were inferring,\nyou have to know what their dopamine is.\nWhere are you on this inverted U-curve?\nAnother way of doing it is\nthrough genetic studies.\nDopamine, all neurotransmitters\nhave to be broken down\nand re-uptaked into the brain cell\nin order to be used again\nand there's different ways of doing it.\nIn some cells, it gets transported\nback into the brain cell.\nIn other places, there's an\nenzyme that breaks it down.\nWell, there's an enzyme called COMT\nthat breaks down dopamine\nin the prefrontal cortex specifically.\nIn a large percentage of individuals,\nthat enzyme is either\noveractive or underactive.\nProbably about 25% of\nindividuals, it's overactive,\nand another 25%, it's underactive.\nSo probably half the population.\nNow, this is going to vary,\ndepend on where you live and\nwhere you come from and things,\nbut maybe half the population\neither has an underactive\nenzyme or overactive enzyme.\nIf you have an underactive enzyme,\nthen actually more dopamine sits around\nand you actually have\nmore dopamine than others,\nand if you have an overactive\nenzyme, it's the opposite.\nSo we've actually shown\nthat if you would now\ngo and genotype people\nwith a simple saliva test\nand figure out\ndo they have this genetic\nwhat we call polymorphism\nwhere just one amino acid gets changed\nand the enzyme becomes\neither active or underactive,\nwe can do the same thing as\ngrouping them by their capacity.\nThose that have the low dopamine,\nwe will make them better\nand those who have sort\nof baseline high dopamine,\nwe'll make them worse.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
