    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I\nthink it can be useful\nfor people to understand is that\nmany things will spike cortisol\nthroughout the day,\ncold water, exercise.\nBut the idea is\nthat it comes down\nto baseline or near\nbaseline rather quickly.\nOne of the worst situations\nas you pointed out\nis when the highest\nlevel of cortisol\nis consistently shifted\nto the afternoon period.\nIn fact, that's a pretty\nreliable signature\nof certain forms of depression.\nThis is work by my\ncolleague David Spiegel\nat Stanford psychiatry and\nthe great Bob Sapolsky,\nRobert Sapolsky of Why Zebras\nDon't Get Ulcers, behave,\net cetera, and Fame lots and\nlots of popular books there.\nI think that if\npeople are trying\nto regulate their\ncortisol, and they just\nunderstand that basic contour,\nthat the baseline should\nbe rise pretty quickly after\none rises in the morning.\nSo it's easy to\nremember, rise, rise.\nRise out of bed and rise\ncortisol with light,\nbright, light, with exercise,\nwith caffeine these things\nwill all increase cortisol.\nAnd then across the day, it's\nnormal for cortisol to spike.\nBut then to use some of\nthe down regulation methods\nthat you described in\nparticular the breathing methods\nand exercise itself\nas the case may be.\nBut then to really pay\nattention to how much\npsychological and\nphysical stress is\noccurring in the six hours or so\nor eight hours prior to sleep.\nDoes that seem like\na good broad contour\nof how to have a healthy\npattern of cortisol release?\nBecause you actually want\nthe cortisol to reduce\ninflammation and\ninitiate or participate\nin the recovery process.\nANDY GALPIN: You will\nnot see any progress\nfrom exercise training without\na large spike in cortisol.\nIt is critically important\nwhen we think of phrases\nlike cortisol, inflammation,\nstress this is not bad.\nPhysiology is not personified.\nThings don't like\nhate you in the body.\nIt is not good and bad.\nThey just are.\nThe more you try to\nsuppress cortisol,\nthe more you\nsuppress adaptation.\nWhat you want is exactly\nwhat you mentioned,\nlarge spikes met with\nlarge, quick recovery.\nAnd you want to do\nthat throughout the day\nand get that hormonal stressor.\nSo going back to your\nashwagandha and rhodiola issue,\nI think would be\nvery short sighted\nfor people that do that\nas this is a prophylactic.\nBecause if you blunt\ncortisol, you're\ngoing to cause\nimmunosuppressant.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Especially\nearly in the day.\nTaking ashwagandha before going\nto train is counterproductive.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, this\nis not a baseline part\nof our foundational package.\nIf you go look at the athlete\nfoundations or the athlete\nresilience protocols\nthat put together,\nyou're not going to see\nthese things in there\nfor that specific reason.\nAny form of cortisol regulation\nneeds to be done strategically.\nIf you are excessively\nhigh and we're bringing you\nback down to normative values,\nat the right time, then great.\nIf you're normal though, then\ntaking you down lower than that\nis actually problematic.\nThe same thing is\nactually true since we're\nhere for oxidative stress, for\nan inflammation, antioxidant\nuse.\nWe mentioned I think\nearlier about taking\nvitamin C and vitamin\nE post exercise\nwill actually blunt\nadaptations, or at least has\nthe potential to do so.\nSame thing.\nIf you're modulating this\nresponse just because\nand you have not done so because\nof actually biological testing\nthat indicated you\nneed to do such,\nthen you actually may\nbe making things worse.\nAnd so we see this\nconstantly with people\nwho take a number of supplements\nand substances for sleep.\nAnd then they wake up\nthe next morning groggy.\nAnd your cortisol suppressed.\nOK great.\nSo then they take\nsomething for stimulation.\nAnd then the rest of the day,\nthey're trying to reduce.\nAnd then this nasty cycle\ninstead of just getting out\nof the way and letting cortisol\ndo what it's supposed to do.\nAnd then making sure,\nagain, you're teaching it.\nSo this is actually\na coachable response.\nYou can coach your\nown body to go down\nin the later part\nof the day and go up\nin the earlier part of the day.\nYou want to make\nsure that you are\ndriving that train with intent.\nAnd so again, to\nreiterate, if you don't\nneed that you shouldn't do it.\nIf you don't need\nto lower cortisol,\nyou shouldn't walk\naround doing it.\nYou're just going to\nsuppress the state even far\nand this is needed\nfor anabolic response.\nSo you're not going\nto grow a muscle\nif cortisol is not spiked.\nIt's going to\ncompromise it rather.\nSo you want to be intentional\nwith these practices,\nespecially in the form\nof supplementation.\nBe very, very intentional.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI've heard it said\nthat carbohydrates,\nin particular, starchy\ncarbohydrates can\ninhibit cortisol.\nAnd this could be through the\ntryptophan amino acid related\npathway that ratchets\nup to serotonin release,\nprobably some other things to.\nI mean, the idea that\ncarbohydrates just\nstimulate serotonin is a\nlittle bit overly simplistic.\nANDY GALPIN: No, there's\ncellular mechanisms.\nAMPK going up and immediately\nturning it on there, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRight, so, I think\nwe've all experienced this.\nWe're stressed.\nWe're stressed.\nDoesn't necessarily even have\nto be highly processed fatty\ncarbohydrates like potato\nchips and potato chips and dip\nor these kinds of things.\nIt can also be a bowl of\nrice, a bowl of oatmeal,\na bowl of pasta, which\nhere I'm not trying\nto demonize carbohydrates.\nI do ingest carbohydrates,\nminimally or non-processed\ncarbohydrates most of the\ntime, but not all the time.\nAnd they have a\nfairly potent effect\non lowering stress and perceived\nstress and even quality\nof sleep, which is not to say\nthat somebody has to load up\non them like crazy unless their\nglycogen is really depleted.\nTalked a lot about this\nin the endurance episode.\nI know we'll touch on\nmore in the Nutrition\nand Supplementation episode.\nBut in thinking about\nthe relationship\nbetween carbohydrates\nand cortisol\nand what we've just been talking\nabout in terms of cortisol\nas being vitally important\nfor the adaptation trigger\nor triggering\nadaptation, it's probably\na better way to put it.\nBut that it can blunt cortisol,\ntaken post training or maybe\nin the evening before sleep.\nWhat are some of the\nbasic ways that one\ncan think about and\nmaybe use carbohydrates\nin specific ways\nin order to, let's\nsay control cortisol\nrather than quash cortisol?\nANDY GALPIN: You actually\nhave alluded to it\na number of times already.\nSo we oftentimes\nwill give people\na lot of carbohydrates at night.\nFor some of these reasons\nyou're going to feel fantastic.\nA lot of people that\nhelps you sleep.\nBoth get to sleep\nand stay asleep.\nSleep quality.\nYou talked about specifically\nremember, think about it\nthis way, cortisol\nat its core is\nan energy signaling molecule.\nIt says we are in\nthe need for energy.\nGreat.\nEpinephrine is the same way.\nYou'll start\nseeing, for example,\ncortisol will liberate\nfree fatty acids,\nput them in the bloodstream, get\nyou prepared to do something.\nThe problem is if\nit's continually\nelevated throughout the day\nwith no down regulation,\nwe start running into issues.\nAnd so again, this is the\ndifferentiation between oh,\nmy cortisol is slightly\nelevated all day versus I\nhad a really big\nspike after training,\nI had a really big spike after\na breath protocol, et cetera,\nand then it went back down.\nSo that being said, if you\nthen ingest carbohydrates,\nit is quick to see the\nsignal oh, we have nutrients,\nwe have energy against\nspecifically carbohydrates\ntherefore cortisol\ncan go back down.\nWe don't need to be\nliberating free fatty acids\nand preparing the need for fuel.\nSo you can help yourself\ngo to sleep for many--\nas you pointed out,\nmany mechanisms actually\nof why carbohydrates will\nhelp you sleep at night.\nFor some.\nNot all people, but some.\nThat would be one of\nthe relationships that\nhas with cortisol.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
