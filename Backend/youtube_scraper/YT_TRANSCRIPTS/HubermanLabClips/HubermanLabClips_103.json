    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\ncurious as to what happens\nor what one should do if their\nHRV is reduced for maybe three\nor four or more days in a row?\nANDY GALPIN: Absolutely.\nThe next question then I'm\ngoing to ask is, again,\nam I in that adaptation phase?\nIf so I'm going\nto still ignore it\njust like I did if it\nwas a single bad day,\nbut I'm going to start\nwatching it very carefully.\nI may actually now\nintroduce some other tests.\nSo I may use a performance test.\nWe may look at something else\nmaybe ask questions, maybe\nhave some communication either\nwith myself or somebody else.\nSo I'm going to start\npaying more attention\nbut I'm still really not going\nto take much action until that\ncrosses more than seven\ndays of consistent problems.\nIf it does do that or we're\nin a peaking phase, then\nI'm going to go to another set\nof solutions that are truly\ngoing to pull me out of the\nhole rather than just be\nthose acute stage shifters.\nThese are more what I call\nchronic stage shifters.\nNow, some of these are actually\nvery similar to the ones\nwe've used before.\nFor example, thermal stress.\nSo I can promise you if your\nrecovery score is in the tanks,\nand you walk outside and you\njump in your 35 degree water,\nand you get back out.\nWhat's going to happen is\nyour HRV score immediately\nafterwards, I'm\ntalking within seconds,\nis going to be\nsignificantly compromised.\nIn other words,\nthink about that.\nRemember, a low HRV\nmeans a high sympathetic.\nI promise you cold\nwater will puts you\nin a high sympathetic drive.\nHowever, and we've tested\nthis pretty extensively\nlooking at HRV 0,\n15, 30, 60, 90,\nall the way up to\n180 minutes post.\nAnd on average, you\nwill see your HRV score\ncontinue to rise after that.\nAnd so while you have this\nimmediate sympathetic response,\nyou will immediately then\nrespond about 30 minutes\non most people.\nDepends on the person though.\nAnd that score will be improved\nfor several hours afterwards.\nSo heat can have\na similar effect.\nThat actually, again,\nit's sort of an acute fix.\nBut over time as we've\ndescribed earlier,\nthat can also have a little\nbit of a chronic effect.\nWe can also then get\ninto areas, like sleep.\nAnd so now we're going to\nstart playing and exploring\nwhy are you sleeping\npoor as well,\nor was your sleep score\nfine, but your HRV was low?\nThat's a little bit\nof a different answer.\nIf your sleep is\ngetting compromised,\nthen we're going to start\ngoing into and making sure\nwe're improving our sleep.\nIn terms of brain stuff,\ninstead of maybe playing a game\nor having music or some\nof those other tricks.\nThose aren't going to really\nhave a chronic effect.\nBut you can do things like\nwork on social connection.\nThat's actually been shown to\nimprove recovery over time.\nYou can do things like\njournaling or meditation.\nAnd those have an acute effect\nas well as a chronic effect.\nSo again, if you go\njournal right now\nyou probably feel better.\nBut also we know\nthat over time that\nwill gradually improve things.\nSo adaptogens and\nthings like that also\ncan have a chronic effect.\nSo can things like electrolytes\nor food or hydration\nif those things were off.\nSo we're going to go to\na whole number of areas,\nbut those are the primary ones.\nOutstanding of all\nthat of course,\nit may be simply a time to go\nback and reassess our training\nprogram, if that's\ntruly the case.\nSo that's where we're at.\nIf so we're probably going\nto either completely remove\ntraining or drop it to like\n50% or so until we start\nrebounding back to baseline.\nAnd that's generally\nthe numbers we use.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: For\nmany people who are not\ntraining for a\ncompetitive sport,\nand maybe aren't pushing\nthemselves really hard,\nmaybe they consider themselves\nsomebody who exercises in order\nto maintain health and\naesthetics and longevity,\net cetera.\nAnd they never really finish any\nworkout completely exhausted.\nThey're sleeping OK.\nTheir appetite's OK.\nCan we assume that they\nare recovering well\nor maybe they're not creating\nenough of a adaptation\nresponse.\nThere's no progressive\noverreaching,\nand so there's really no\nstimulus for recovery.\nWhat I'm saying here\nis on the face of it,\nI think is obvious, if you\ndon't train hard there's\nnothing to recover from.\nWhat I'm really saying\nis, is the ability\nto recover itself something\nthat we need to train?\nIn other words, can we\nget better at recovering.\nAnd the analogy here would\nbe something like focus.\nIn order to perform\nwork of any kind,\nbut certainly mental\nwork and physical work\nwe need to be able to focus.\nThe ability to focus\nis the reflection\nof a bunch of neural circuits\nand chemicals and hormones, et\ncetera, but we know\nroughly what those are,\nand we know that if you\nare poor at focusing,\nfor every small bit of\ntime that you can focus\na little bit longer, even\nif it's a matter of seconds,\nthose circuits themselves\nget better at focusing\nand so on and so forth.\nSo in other words, is the\nrecovery system however\nbroad, neurotransmitters,\nhormones, neuromuscular,\nimmune-based, et cetera.\nCan that system or set\nof systems become better?\nCan we get better at recovering?\nMeaning can it become\nfaster and more effective?\nCan we think of\nthe recovery system\nas kind of a blade that gets\nsharper by engaging recovery?\nBecause if so, then\nthere's strong reason\nfor people who are\nnot pushing really\nhard to push at least\na little bit harder\nthan is comfortable for\nthem every once in a while\nto make sure that system\ndoesn't start to slide back.\nANDY GALPIN:\nRemember, physiology\nis listening to\neverything you do.\nAnd it is always responding.\nSo the analogy that I will\nmeet your analogy with that I\nuse here is the bowling alley.\nSo you've probably\nbeen bowling before\nand you've used the\nbumper lanes, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe bumper lanes.\nI've gone bowling before and\nI've spent time in the gutter,\nand I've spent time on the pins.\nIt's been a while.\nWe used to have a bowling alley\nin the town where I went to.\nAnd it was fun.\nWe used to slide\naround on our shoes\nand all the kids\nwould hang out there.\nAnd I feel like--\nDo they still have\nbowling alleys?\nANDY GALPIN: I don't even know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nfeels like something\nthat may have gone the\nway of the mid-2000.\nANDY GALPIN: I don't care\nif no one bowls anymore.\nYou're not going to\nruin my good analogy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOK, well, my intent\nwasn't to ruin your analogy.\nOK tell us about bowling.\nAll the bowlers are going to\ncome after me with bowling\nballs or something.\nANDY GALPIN: You're going to\nget blasted with all the stats\nelevations and--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Don't hurt me.\nSorry.\nANDY GALPIN: Right.\nCool, so if one\nwere to go bowling\nand they didn't want to put\ntheir ball in the gutter,\nyou could put these little\nbumpers in those lanes.\nAnd these little foam\npads that go in the gutter\nthat if your bowl is\ngoing towards the gutter.\nIt hits those and bounces off\nand goes back in the lane.\nOK so in this entire\nconversation, and this\nis actually true of a lot\nof the way people approach\ntheir fitness and health, people\nare very concerned, oftentimes\nwith optimizing,\nmeaning I want to make\nsure I don't go in the gutter.\nI don't want to hit the\nwalls, so therefore, I'm\ngoing to try to improve\nthe accuracy in which I\nthrow the ball.\nSo I want to make sure\nthat I'm throwing it\ndown the center of\nthe lane more often.\nAnd I want to get my standard\ndeviation tighter and tighter\nso that I don't get anywhere\nclose to hitting the wall.\nHowever, what\nthey're not realizing\nis if you do that,\nthe body will start\nshrinking the size of the lane\nbecause what it basically says\nis we haven't had a\nball touch us in years.\nWe don't need to be this wide.\nLet's get smaller and\nsmaller and smaller.\nSo it's not that you actually\nare having a reduced ability\nto recover but you start\nbecoming incredibly\nsensitive to that.\nSo your two strategies\nfor enhancing recovery\nare to practice getting\ncloser of throwing\nthat ball down the middle\nlane or to widen the alley.\nAnd that's exactly what\nyou're referring to.\nAnd you absolutely\nshould do that.\nAnd so what happens\nis you don't have\nto be so precise\nwith what you're\ndoing because your\nability to handle\nso many things is widened.\nSo if you're off now by\n4.5 inches to the right,\nno problem because you've just\ntripled the size of your alley.\nThat's exactly what\nyou want to do.\nSo paying attention\nto two things.\nNumber one, is getting\nbetter at accuracy.\nMaybe staying really tight\nwith your progressions,\nusing nutrition and sleep\nto optimize your recovery,\nand push your resilience\nis what we call this.\nIn fact, there's\nactually a biological way\nto measure resilience.\nWe do that in all of our folks.\nThis is scientifically\nvalidated stuff.\nI didn't just make it\nup, you can actually\nmeasure resilience.\nAnd there's more and\nmore coming out on this.\nBut that's exactly\nwhat that term means.\nSo how well can you\nhandle and bang things\noff the stress level?\nSo when you see a reduction\nin say 10% of your HRV today,\nfor you that might\nmake you feel terrible.\nFor me I might not feel\nanything because I'm well\nadapted to large fluctuations\nand therefore, I'm OK.\nThe less and less you do that,\nthe more and more responsive\nyou will be to those\nslight deviations.\nSo that is exactly the target.\nAnd that's kind of\nwhat I allude to when\nI say you got to understand\nwhat are we optimizing for.\nAre we optimizing\nfor making sure I\ndon't feel any different today?\nAre we optimizing\nto make sure when\nI do feel different I\nstill am able to perform.\nSo this is why you want to\ndo things like maybe use\nsome caffeine today\nand feel great.\nBut if I have to use it\nevery day, all I'm doing\nis shrinking my\nsensitivity there.\nSo now if I have to\ngo a day without it,\nI can't train at all.\nCaffeine is the easy example\nbecause people understand\nhow that whole system works.\nBut this is really true\nof everything else.\nSo yeah, you need\nto practice this.\nAnd the way to do that is\nto give yourself more stress\nto continue to\nbring in the stress\nfrom nutrition, from\ntraining, from breathwork.\nYou mentioned\nearlier about focus.\nThe exact same thing.\nIt's not just about\ngetting better right now.\nIt's about training a system.\nAnd you can clearly train that.\nWe will often say\nbreathwork is a practice.\nThat's exactly what\nwe're talking about.\nSo you're practicing getting\nbetter at these things,\nyou're practicing\nreturning your focus,\nyou're practicing recovering.\nAnd quite literally\nphysiologically you\ncan upregulate whether we're\ntalking enzymes, whether we're\ntalking about regulators.\nThese will be\nupregulated so then\nthat the next time that insult\ncomes in, it's not as damaging.\nSo yeah, absolutely, you can\nand you should strive for that.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
