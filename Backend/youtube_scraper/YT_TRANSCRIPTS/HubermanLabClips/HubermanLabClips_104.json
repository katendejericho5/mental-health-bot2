    "transcript": "I don't want to say it's a mistake.\nI think perhaps somewhat\noversimplification\nof how people conceptualize\ndopamine's role in the brain is,\neven though it's a major important role,\nis for it to be active\nand released during highly\nreinforcing experiences,\nlike sex, like really good\nfood, like drugs of abuse.\nIt also can get activated subdivisions\nof this system during painful stimuli\nand during aversive stimuli, which again,\nare really important for\nyou to be aware of, to say,\noh my God, that's really bad for me.\nAnd so the dopamine system,\nthis reward circuitry and its\nsub-components that maybe,\nperhaps, signal more salience\nor aversion in the\nenvironment, are closely tied\nto arousal systems and memory systems."
