    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhat about cancer?\nAgain, nobody wants cancer.\nWe've all known people\nwho've died of cancer\nor have had cancer.\nWhat can be done to reduce\none's risk of cancer?\nPETER ATTIA: Well, you asked\nearlier about the numbers.\nSo let's throw some\nnumbers out there.\nSo globally, we're talking about\n11, 12 million deaths per year,\nabout half the number of ASCVD,\nstill a staggering number.\nAt the individual level, put it\nthis way, somewhere between 1\nand 3 and 1 in 4 chance\nanyone listening to this\nor watching this is going to\nget cancer in their lifetime.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nwhat's the probability\nthey will die from that cancer?\nPETER ATTIA: A half of that,\nabout a 1 in 6 chance of dying.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So is\nit true that every male\ngets prostate cancer?\nIn other words, from\ntheir deathbed--\nPETER ATTIA: Every man will\ndie with prostate cancer.\nYou and I have prostate\ncancer right now.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank\nyou for informing.\nPETER ATTIA: Yes.\nHopefully, we will\nnot die of it.\nWe should not die of it.\nProstate cancer,\ncolon cancer are\ncancers that no one should\never die from because they\nare so easy to screen for.\nThey are so easy to treat when\nthey are in their infancy,\nthat it's totally\nunacceptable that people\nare dying from this.\nThere are other cancers for\nwhich I can't really say that.\nBreast cancer, much\nmore complicated.\nPancreatic cancer,\nmuch more complicated.\nGlioblastoma multiforme,\nmuch more complicated.\nSo as you said a second ago,\ncancer is not a disease.\nIt is a category of diseases.\nIt's not just that\neach organ is different\nand breast differs\nfrom pancreatic,\nit's that within breast cancer,\nER, PR-positive, HER2, neu\npositive is a totally\ndifferent disease\nfrom the triple\nnegative breast cancers.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Those with BRCA\nmutations or nonBRCA mutations.\nPETER ATTIA: Well, even\nputting that aside, just\nlooking at the hormone profile\nof the individual breast\ncancers, they're totally\ndifferent diseases.\nSo it's not just\nthat breast cancer is\ndifferent from prostate cancer.\nIt's that all breast\ncancers are quite different.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe I\nshould frame the question\na little differently\nthan-- given\nthe vast number of\ndifferent types of cancers\nand categories.\nPETER ATTIA: Well, no, no.\nYour question is\nstill a fair one.\nI just wanted to throw\nthat caveat out there.\nSo now to your question.\nSo what do we know?\nIt turns out that we\ncan very comfortably\nspeak to several things.\nOne is the role that genes play.\nSo maybe I'll just\nspend one second\non gene 101 thing\nfor the viewer.\nWe want to differentiate\nbetween what\nare called germline mutations\nand somatic mutations.\nSo your germline and\nmy germline are set.\nWhen we were born, our germline\nmutations-- any mutations\nwe have in germline genes are\ninherited from our parents.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They\nare non-negotiable.\nPETER ATTIA: They're\nnon-negotiable.\nYou got those things.\nSo question one is,\nhow much of cancer\nresults from those types\nof genetic mutations?\nAnd the answer is very\nlittle, less than 5%.\nSo a very-- you mentioned\none a moment ago, BRCA.\nSo mutations in BRCA\nare germline mutations.\nA woman will get a BRCA mutation\nfrom one of her parents.\nAnd we will often\nhave a sense of that\njust from the family history.\nWhen mom, and sister,\nand aunt, and grandmother\nhad breast cancer, you've\ngot a breast cancer gene.\nNow, it might be BRCA.\nIt might be another\ngene that's not BRCA,\nbut there's no ambiguity.\nAnd we test for these genes\nmostly just for insurance\npurposes, frankly, but\nthere's no ambiguity\nthat was a germline\ntransmission of a gene that\nis driving cancer.\nBut 95% plus of\ncancers are not arising\nfrom germline mutations.\nThey are arising from\nsomatic mutations or acquired\nmutations.\nSo the question\nthen becomes, what\nis driving somatic mutation?\nAnd the two clearest indications\nof drivers of somatic mutation\nare smoking and obesity.\nSmoking, we've talked about.\nLet's put that\naside for a moment.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm so\nsurprised about obesity.\nI don't know why I'm surprised,\nbut I've never heard this.\nI'm probably just naive\nto the literature.\nPETER ATTIA: Yeah, so obesity\nis now the second most prevalent\nenvironmental driver of cancer.\nNow, I will argue--\nand I think I\nargue this in the book\nhopefully pretty convincingly.\nI don't think it's\nobesity per se.\nI think obesity is just\na masquerading proxy.\nWhat is obesity?\nObesity simply is defined\nby body mass index.\nWell, first of all, I\ndon't think I'm obese,\nbut I'm way overweight on BMI.\nYou probably are too.\nSo let's just acknowledge--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm clinically\ndiagnosable as obese.\nPETER ATTIA: Are you?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no.\nWell, clinically\nmaybe-- PETER ATTIA:\nThat would be BMI over 30.\nI don't think you're\nprobably there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but if I\nmeasure my weight by height--\nPETER ATTIA: My BMI\nis probably 27 or 28.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK,\nit's been a little while\nsince I've checked.\nI only know body fat percentages\nand things like that.\nPETER ATTIA: So basically, BMI\nis a far from perfect proxy.\nBut at the population\nlevel, it's what we use.\nI wish we would get\noff it by the way.\nI think it's really crap.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because it\ndoesn't take into account\nlean versus nonlean tissue.\nPETER ATTIA: I\nthink we could get--\nI think we could get\nbetter data if we looked\nat waist to height ratio.\nThat's a way better metric.\nSo this is just a quick\ntest for everybody.\nI'm going to argue,\nyour BMI is less\nrelevant to me than\nyour eye color.\nBut if your waist\ncircumference is more than 50%\nof your height, you\nshould be concerned.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK,\nwell, then I'm OK.\nPETER ATTIA: Yeah, you're\nfine by that metric.\nNow, that's important.\nSo if you're 6 feet\ntall, your waist\nbetter be under 36 inches.\nAnd if it's over, I would\nargue that's the definition\nof obesity, not your\nBMI being over 30.\nSo back to this issue.\nBecause we're using such\na crude measurement,\nit basically is catching\na whole bunch of stuff,\nbut the question is,\nwhat's driving it?\nAnd I think if you really look\nat the physiology of cancer,\nI don't think it's obesity.\nI think it's two things that\ncome with obesity-- insulin\nresistance, which is\ntwo thirds to three\nquarters of obese\nindividuals are\ninsulin resistant\nand inflammation.\nAnd I think those two\nthings, with the inflammation\nand the immune dysfunction,\nwith the insulin resistance\nand hyper-basically-tonic\ngrowth stimulus that's coming,\nthat's what's driving cancer.\nSo again, is it\nbecause a person is\nstoring extra fat in their\nlove handles that that's\ndriving their risk of cancer?\nNo, those are just\ntwo things that\nare coming along for the ride.\nSo beyond those two things--\nand along with certain--\nthere are also certain\nenvironmental toxins.\nWe absolutely know\nare doing this.\nSo we understand that people\nwho have exposure to asbestos\nhave a much higher risk of\ncertain types of lung cancers\nand things like that.\nBut for the most part,\nthose are our big risks.\nBeyond that, we talk about\nalcohol in certain cases,\nabsolutely.\nAlcohol is a carcinogen.\nIt's the dose part still\nisn't clear to me.\nI don't know-- is\none drink a day\nmoving the needle, much\non cancer risk per se?\nIt's not clear.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd it might depend\non those genetic\npredispositions.\nPETER ATTIA: Yes.\nSo yeah, if step one\nis don't get cancer,\nyou have no control\nover your genes.\nYou have control over smoking.\nYou have control over\ninsulin sensitivity.\nI wish I could sit\nhere and tell you\nthat there is a proven\nanti-cancer diet\nor that if you do X amount\nof exercise per week,\nyou're going to not get cancer.\nWe just don't have a fraction\nof the control over cancer\nthat we have with\ncardiovascular disease.\nWe don't understand the\ndisease well enough.\nSo we don't understand\nthe initiation process\nand the propagation process.\nAnd we have to rely\nmuch more on screening.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Are there good,\nwhole body screens for cancer?\nIn other words, can I walk\ninto a tube and/or a cylinder,\nrather, and get screened for\nthe presence of tumors, any\nand everywhere in the\nbody, outside the brain,\nbecause the brain is a\nlittle harder to get to.\nPETER ATTIA: Believe it or\nnot, the brain is actually\npretty easy to screen for--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because it's\nso fatty and floating in water.\nPETER ATTIA: Well,\nand also the head--\nwhen you put the head\ninto an MRI scanner,\nthere's no movement.\nThe least motion\nartifact is in the brain.\nSo when you use something called\ndiffusion weighted imaging\nwith background\nsubtraction in an MRI,\na technology that was\nactually pioneered\nin the brain for\nstroke identification\nit's also really good at\nlooking for tumors as well.\nSo let me make the argument\nfor why screening matters,\nbecause this is,\nagain, an area where\nI go far down a\nrabbit hole in a way\nthat I think traditional\nmedicine would argue against.\nSo my argument for\nscreening is an argument\nat the individual level.\nAnd it goes as follows.\nTo my knowledge, there\nis not a single example\nof a cancer that is\nmore effectively treated\nwhen the burden of\ncancer cells in the body\nis higher than when it is lower.\n| The two examples I think\nI talk about in the book\nare colon cancer\nand breast cancer.\nSo when you take an individual\nwith stage four colon cancer,\nthat means that the\ncancer has left the colon\nand is now outside of the colon.\nSo it's usually in the\nliver, at a minimum,\npotentially in the\nlungs or in the brain.\nThat person's five year\nsurvival is very low.\nWe will treat them with\na very aggressive regimen\nof multiple drugs.\nAnd again, you'll get\na five-year survival\nof maybe 10% to 20%.\nAnd by 10 years, If you take a\nperson with stage three colon\ncancer, so the\ncolon cancer is big.\nAnd it's even in the lymph\nnodes around the colon.\nBut at least grossly,\nyou can't see\ncolon cancer cell-- you can't\nsee those cells in the liver.\nMicroscopically,\nof course, we know\nthey're there because if you\ndon't treat those patients,\nthey still die of colon\ncancer, but you whack them\nwith the same chemo\nregimen that you\nwere going to give the\nmetastatic patients,\n80% of those people are\nalive in five years.\nSo night and day\ndifference in survival.\nWhat's the difference?\nIn the person with\nmetastatic cancer,\nyou're treating a person with\nhundreds of billions of cells.\nIn the adjuvant setting,\nwhich is what we call--\nwe call it adjuvant when\nyou treat people who\nhave only microscopic disease.\nYou're treating\nbillions of cells.\nThe same is true\nwith breast cancer.\nSo we have the clinical trial\ndata to put them side by side.\nSo rule number one\nis don't get cancer.\nRule number two is catch\ncancer as early as possible\nif you're going to get it, which\nbrings us to your question of,\nhow do you screen for it?\nWe basically screen-- the first\nline of screening is imaging,\nis a visualization.\nSo you have cancers that\noccur outside the body\nthat you can look at directly.\nSo skin cancer, you can\nlook directly at the skin.\nEsophageal, gastric,\ncolon cancer, those\nare outside the body.\nMouth to anus, embryologically,\nis outside the body.\nSo you can put a scope in\nand you can look directly\nat the cancer.\nBut for all other cancers that\nare inside the body, yeah,\nyou have to rely on some\nsort of imaging modality.\nAlthough now, we're starting\nto look at these things called\nliquid biopsies.\nSo blood tests that are\nlooking for cell free DNA.\nAnd the cell free DNA\nGives, us a sense of, based\non the epigenetic signature of\nwhat you're looking at, hey,\nis there a cancer in the body/\nAnd if so, what tissue is it\npotentially coming from based\non these epigenetic signatures?\nSo the problem with\nrelying on any one modality\nis a problem of sensitivity\nand specificity optimization.\nNow with MRI scanners, which\nare in some ways the best way\nto do this because they\ndon't have radiation.\nSo you don't want to\nbe incurring damage\nas you do this.\nThe irony of doing a whole body\nCT scan to screen for cancer\nis your whole body\nCT scan would be\nclose to 30 to 50\nmillisieverts of radiation.\nIt's a staggering\nsum of radiation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Does that\nmean that people should--\nsorry to pull you off this, but\nI was going to ask about this\nanyway, avoiding going\nthrough the whole body scanner\nat the airport/ PETER ATTIA:\nNo, it's so low, so low.\nYeah, going through a whole\nbody scanner at the airport\nor even getting a\nDEXA scan, I mean,\nthese are trivial\namounts of radiation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhat about flying?\nYou hear that pilots\nget more cancers.\nPETER ATTIA: If you're a pilot\nwho's flying over the North\nPole, back and forth\nand back and forth,\nyou're probably getting 5\nto 10 millisieverts a year.\nThe NRC suggests that nobody\nshould get more than 50\nmillisieverts a year.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So you and\nI both travel a fair amount.\nBut typical travel\nfor the busy person,\nlet's say, two round roundtrip\nflights of more than two hours\nper month and an international\ntrip every three months.\nPETER ATTIA: Probably still\nless than a millisievert a year.\nYeah, living at sea level,\n1 millisieverts a year.\nLiving at a mile elevation,\nif you lived in Denver,\nyou're at 2\nmillisieverts a year.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nhave to ask, standing\nin front of the microwave.\nWe've got friends, they ask.\nPETER ATTIA: With or without\ntestes on the counter.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's an inside joke\nthat unfortunately and\nfortunately deserves\nno description.\nAnd Peter's not referring to me.\nBut people worry about\nother sources of radiation,\nso it doesn't sound like\nthe microwave is a concern.\nWhat are the other major\nsources of radiation?\nPETER ATTIA: I mean, outside of\nnuclear stuff where things go--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, if\nyou've lived near a plant\nor there's been an event.\nPETER ATTIA: It's mostly at the\nhands of medical professionals.\nIt's the CT scanner\nand the PET scanner\nare hands down the biggest\nsource of radiation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What about\nthe X-rays at the dentist when\nthey--\nPETER ATTIA: They are very low.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: -- when\nthey scurry behind the wall,\nput me under the red blanket.\nPETER ATTIA: They're very\nlow, relatively speaking.\nFluoroscopy is very high.\nThey tend to try to\ncover up all of you\nthat-- so for example, if they\nwere doing a fluoroscopy study\nof your kidney because\nyou had a stone\nor if you were getting an\ninjection into-- if they were\ndoing a fluoroscopic-guided\ninjection of one of your disks\nin your neck, that would be\na locally pretty high dose.\nBut they're going to cover\nthe hell out of you elsewhere.\nAnd again, if you get\none of these things,\nit's not the end of the world.\nBut boy, I wouldn't want\nto be getting one a month.\nAnd back to the point\nabout screening,\na chest, abdomen, pelvis\nCT scan is probably--\nI mean, look.\nThere's probably a\nscanner out there now\nthat's moving fast enough\nthat it's much lower.\nBut I'll give you an example.\nRemember how I\ntalked about we do\nCT angiograms on all of our\npatients for coronary artery\ndisease?\nAn off-the-shelf\nscanner for this\nis 20 millisieverts\nof radiation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK so\ncalibrate me because--\nPETER ATTIA: That's 40%\nof your annual allotment.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, wow, so\nthe medical practitioners really\nare the major culprits here.\nPETER ATTIA: That's right.\nSo what we say is-- and I\nthink most doctors are now\nrealizing this is-- no, no.\nIt behooves you to\npay a little bit more\nto go to a really\ngood place that\ncan do that scan\nfor 2 millisieverts,\nmeaning they have a\nmuch faster CT scanner,\nmuch better software, and\nthey're better engineers.\nSo they have better engineering\nthat they can do on the scanner\nto get that done.\nSomeone listening to\nthis, here's my take.\nDo not get a CT scan\nor any imaging study\nwithout asking how much\nradiation am I seeing.\nAnd if a person can't tell\nyou how many millisieverts\nof radiation you're\nbeing exposed to,\nthen just say I'm going to\nwait a minute until somebody\ncan tell me that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I realize--\nPETER ATTIA: And\nkeep in mind, if 50\nis the most you should ever\nbe exposed to in a year,\nthere better be a\ndamn good reason why\nI'm going to get 25 in a day.\nNow, there are some people\nwho have to do this.\nIf you're a cancer patient\nand they're scanning you\nas a part of your\ntreatment, I mean,\nyou have to pick and\nchoose between those two\nopportunities.\nSo I don't want to--\nI also don't want to\ncreate some fear mongering,\nwhere, oh, my god.\nIf you hit 50 in a\nyear, you're hos.\nNo, I wouldn't want\nto hit 50 a year,\nevery year for my whole life.\nAnd I certainly wouldn't\nwant to be hitting hundreds\na year for any period of time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nthink you were just\ntrying to raise awareness\nand also calibrate people\nto what the sources are and so\nthey can make good choices not\nto place them into a\nchronic state of fear.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
