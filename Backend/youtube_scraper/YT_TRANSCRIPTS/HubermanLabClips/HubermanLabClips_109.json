    "transcript": "PETER ATTIA: Would you agree\nthat smoking is causally\nrelated to lung cancer?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes.\nPETER ATTIA: So\njust to be clear,\nAndrew, you do not think\nthat it's just an association\nthat smokers get\nmore lung cancer?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No, I do not.\nPETER ATTIA: In other words,\nyou believe that smoking\ncauses lung cancer then?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes.\nI mean, there are a number of\nmechanistic steps in between.\nI mean, if somebody want to\nget to drill into the logic,\nthey could say, OK, it's\nnot actually the smoking.\nIt's some disruption of the\nendothelial cell lining that--\nPETER ATTIA: But\nsmoking triggers that.\nIt triggers that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I assume so.\nPETER ATTIA: And I agree\nwith you, by the way.\nI think the data are very clear.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm very\nrelieved to hear that.\nPETER ATTIA: But I'm going\nsomeplace very important here.\nBecause if there's\none topic that\ndoesn't get enough attention\nin medicine, it's causality.\nAnd causality is an\nobsession of mine.\nMost of the day,\non some level, I\nsit around thinking\nabout causality.\nAnd I think the hardest\npart about studying medicine\nwith respect to human\nbeings is how difficult it\nis to infer causality for\nmost things that we do.\nSo if you believe that\nsmoking is causally related\nto lung cancer, then\nsmoking cessation\nreduces the probability\nof lung cancer.\nThat is a logical equivalency.\nThere can be no\ndebate about that.\nWhat if I said to\nyou, Andrew, this\nis going to be our new\nphilosophy around smoking\ncessation.\nI'm going to anoint you the\nczar of smoking cessation.\nSo if people pick up\nsmoking, no problem.\nWe're going to let them smoke.\nBut we're going to assess their\nrisk for lung cancer using\na model that predicts when their\n10-year risk of lung cancer\ngets above a certain level,\nwe're going to recommend\nthat they stop smoking.\nSo we're going to look at their\nage, their sex, their family\nhistory, some biomarkers\nthat might help us.\nWe're going to even do\nscans of their lungs.\nAnd once we think they cross\na threshold where their risk\nof lung cancer is high enough--\nlet's just say it's 25%-- boom.\nYou make them stop.\nYou tell them it's time to stop.\nIs that a logical approach\nto treating smoking and lung\ncancer?\nOr would it be\nbetter to say, given\nthat we know cigarettes are\ncausally related to this, how\nabout you never start smoking?\nAnd the minute you do, we pull\nthe cigarette out of your mouth\nand explain to you that\nyou're doing something\nthat is causally related.\nOf course, it would be the\nlatter, not the former.\nIt would be idiotic\nto suggest that we\nendorse smoking until you\ncross a certain threshold.\nWell, this now becomes\nthe germane question.\nThere is no ambiguity that\nApoB is causally related\nto atherosclerosis.\nHow can I tell you that?\nI can tell you that looking\nat all of the clinical trial\nliterature, all of the\nepidemiologic literature\nand, perhaps, even most\nimportantly, the Mendelian\nrandomizations.\nAll of these things tell\nus, because by the way--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMendelian randomizations\nmeaning genetic mutants,\nhumans out there\nthat make very little\nApoB or excessive ApoB.\nPETER ATTIA: And very much.\nExactly.\nSo we have a whole grade.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So you can\nsay if you make very little,\nyou aren't going to die\nas quickly in your life\nas if you make too much.\nPETER ATTIA: That's right.\nSo Mendelian randomization\nis such an elegant tool\nwhere you basically let\ngenes do the randomization.\nAnd as you said,\nthere is a gradation\nof LDL concentration\nor ApoB concentration\nthat occurs from insanely\nlow to insanely high.\nAnd this is a wildly polygenic,\npolymorphic set of conditions.\nAnd we can look at the\noutcomes of those people\nbased on the random\nsorting of those genes.\nAnd there's no ambiguity.\nLDL is causally related--\nLDL cholesterol\nor ApoB, causally\nrelated to atherosclerosis.\nWell, if that's\ntrue, and I haven't\nseen a credible\nargument that it's not--\nthere are people who argue\nthat it's not, by the way,\nbut they just don't\nhave credibility\nin their arguments--\nthen you have\nto say that what we're\ndoing in medicine today\nis very backwards.\nBecause what we're doing\nin medicine today is\nthe following-- we're saying--\nI'm coming at this\nin a long way,\nbut your question\nis so important\nthat I want to\nanswer it this way.\nWe're answering\nyour question today\nas follows-- we're\nsaying, Andrew,\nlet's do a 10-year\nrisk calculation\nof your risk of MACE.\nMACE stands for major\nadverse cardiac event.\nIt is the metric\nwe use in medicine.\nSo a major adverse cardiac\nevent is a heart attack, stroke\nor death basically\nresulting from these things.\nAnd we have calculators that\nare pretty good at predicting\nyour 10-year event risk.\nThey'll look at your cholesterol\nlevels, your blood pressure.\nThey'll ask if you smoke.\nThey'll ask some family\nhistory questions,\nand they'll spit out a number.\nNow, we should do\nyours after the fact.\nAnd I don't know.\nIf we did it for a person\nwho's-- you're in your mid-40s,\nit would probably spit out\nless than 5% risk for a major\nadverse cardiac event\nin the next 10 years.\nIn fact, the models don't\neven work if age is below 40.\nSo the first time I went\nto do one of these tests\nwhen I was in my mid-30s,\nI couldn't do it.\nThe algorithm breaks.\nIt just doesn't work.\nSo the implication there is if\nyour MACE risk is less than 5%,\nthe thinking is you do not\nneed to treat LDL or ApoB.\nI argue that makes\nabsolutely no sense.\nIt's just as idiotic as the\nanalogy I used around smoking.\nIf a risk is causal\nand it is modifiable,\nit should be modified regardless\nof the risk tail in duration.\nSo then, the question\nbecomes to what level?\nAnd again, the earlier you\nstart, the less aggressive\nyou need to be, the less\ndamage that's there already.\nSo for example, we do CT\nangiograms on our patients.\nIf the CT angiogram shows no\nevidence of calcification,\nno evidence of soft\nplaque, that means grossly,\nthe coronary arteries\nare still normal.\nHistologically,\nthey're probably not,\nbecause nobody probably makes it\nto our age with histologically\nperfect coronary arteries.\nWe might be satisfied\nwith a person's ApoB\nbeing at the 5th percentile\nof the population, which\nwould be about 60\nmilligrams per deciliter.\nBut if we have\nany other factors,\nmeaning we're\nstarting later in life\nor a person already has\ngross evidence of disease--\ncalcification, soft plaque--\nfamily history is significant,\nany other risk factors\nare present, I mean,\nwe'll treat ApoB to 30 to 40\nmilligrams per deciliter, which\nis probably the 1st percentile.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And if\nsomebody's sitting up\nin the, say, low 130s,\nwhat kind of flag\ndoes that raise for you?\nAnd I realize it's highly\ncontextual-- age, et cetera.\nPETER ATTIA: No, no,\nit's a huge red flag.\nAgain, just because\nsomething is causal\ndoesn't mean you're\nguaranteed to get it.\nThere are smokers who\ndon't get lung cancer.\nSo there's going to be somebody\nlistening to this who says,\nmy grandmother is 95 years old.\nHer cholesterol is sky high,\nand she's alive and well.\nAnd I will say, absolutely.\nThere are a lot of people\nwalking around that way.\nJust as there are a lot of\nsmokers walking around who\ndon't get lung cancer.\nYou can't impute these things\non an individual basis.\nYou basically have\nto ask the question,\nhow do I make the best\njudgment about an individual\nfrom heterogeneous\npopulation data\nand based on what are causal\nand non-causal inferences \naround risk.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
