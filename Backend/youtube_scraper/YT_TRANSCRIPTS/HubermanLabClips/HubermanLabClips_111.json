    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: What are your\nthoughts on pure estrogen birth\ncontrol?\nThis is what I learned\nwhen I was in college\nis that birth control is\nbasically tonic estrogen,\nso constantly taking\nestrogen, estrogen. Women\nare taking estrogen so that\nthey don't get the estrogen\npriming of progesterone.\nYou're not getting\nany ovulation.\nAnd I've known women\nthat have been taking\nor that took oral\ncontraception-- it's\nlike estrogen pills,\nbasically, for 5, 10, 15 years.\nAre there long-term\nconsequences of this as it\nrelates to pregnancy,\nPCOS, menopause?\nIf so, what are some\nof those consequences?\nWhat are your concerns?\nWhat do you like about\noral contraceptives?\nWhat do you dislike about them?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: I like how\nbalanced you ask that question.\nSo women who take\noral contraceptives\nas long as you're describing,\nlike 10 years or longer,\nwe call those Olympic\noral contraceptive users.\nIn terms of benefit, I think\nthat, especially when they\nfirst came out and even\nnow, it gives women\nreproductive choice,\nand that's essential.\nAs you may know, our\nreproductive choice\nhas been declining recently.\nSo I'm a big fan in that regard,\nand we've got a lot of data\nto show both the risks and\nalso the benefits of it.\nSo I'll speak first\ninto the benefits\nbecause I'm going to get\non a soapbox a little bit\nabout the risks.\nSo we know that it reduces\nthe risk of ovarian cancer.\nSo there's something about this\nidea of incessant ovulation.\nThat is not good\nfor the female body.\nSo if you look at,\nfor instance, women\nwho are nuns, who don't\ntake oral contraceptives,\nand they have a period\nevery single month\nof their reproductive\nlives, they\nhave a greater risk\nof ovarian cancer.\nSo if you look, then, at\nwomen who have several babies,\nand they've got a period\nof time when they're\npregnant that they're\nnot ovulating,\nand then they breastfeed\nfor some period of time,\nthey have a lower risk\nof ovarian cancer.\nSo oral contraceptives help with\nreducing ovulation and reducing\nrisk.\nWe know that if you take the\noral contraceptive for about\nfive years, it reduces your\nrisk of ovarian cancer by 50%.\nAnd that's significant\nbecause we're\nso poor at diagnosing\novarian cancer early.\nThere's really no method\nthat's really effective.\nWe use CA 125 and\nultrasound screening,\nespecially in women who are\nat greater genetic risk.\nBut even that, often, we\ndiagnose it in a later stage.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe\njust because that statement\nis going to highlight\nfor a number of people\nthe question of, what are\nsome of the earliest symptoms\nthat people can recognize\nwithout a blood test?\nSo is ovarian cancer--\nis it going to be pain?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: So the problem\nis the symptoms are so vague,\nand they're so nonspecific.\nOne of the most common\nsymptoms is bloating.\nAnd we've already talked\nabout constipation.\nWe've talked about how women\nhave this longer tract, GI\ntract, and so bloating is\na really common experience\nfor most women.\nYou can have bulk symptoms,\nfeeling like your lower belly\nis kind of pressed out.\nSo the way that we inform women\nin terms of watching for this\nis to get regular\ngynecologic exams.\nFor women who are\nat high risk, where\nthey have, for instance, an\nultrasound for some reason,\nand it shows a mass that\nwe're concerned about,\nthere's a way to\ntriage that in terms\nof what kind of\nevaluation that they need.\nAnd that's a situation where you\nmight get a blood test called\nthe CA 129--\nCA 125.\nYeah, the problem is the\nsymptoms are so vague.\nIt depends on how big the tumor\nis, how much bulk you have,\nwhat it's pressing on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nif taking estrogen\nand thereby reducing the\nfrequency of ovulation\nlowers the risk\nof ovarian cancer,\nshould women that are-- even\nwomen who are not sexually\nactive, so they're not actively\ntrying to get pregnant or avoid\ngetting pregnant.\nBut if they're not\nsexually active,\nthen the probability\nof conceiving\nunless they go through some\nIUI or some other route\nis very low, as far as I know.\nThat's what I was taught\nin high school, anyway.\nWould they be wise\nto suppress ovulation\nfor periodically using\nhormone-based contraception\njust so that they can offset\nthe risk of ovarian cancer?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: That's a\nvery rational question,\nand I would say that's what\nmainstream medicine has\nhad at its back to recommend\noral contraceptives, not just\nfor women who are seeking\ncontraception, but for acne,\nfor painful periods,\nfor really kind\nof the drop of a hat\nthey're prescribing\noral contraceptives.\nThat's what I was taught to do.\nBut there are so\nmany consequences,\nand I think the issue\nhere is more about consent\nbecause an OB-GYN--\nand I started out\nas a board-certified OB-GYN,\nand I now mostly see men,\nbut I was taught as an OB-GYN\nto convince women to go\non the oral contraceptive.\nAnd I think a lot of that\nis pharmaceutical influence.\nSo maybe we could\ntalk about the risks\nand why the answer is\nno to your question.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: As we do\nthat, could I just ask,\nis the so-called ring, the-- it\nused to be called the NuvaRing.\nMaybe that's a brand name.\nBut when I was in college,\nthere was all this discussion\nabout the ring by both men\nand women for reasons that\ndon't belong on the podcast.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: [LAUGHS]\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nUse your imagination, folks.\nSo is the ring-- obviously, it's\nnot oral hormone contraception,\nbut it's hormone based, right?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: It is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The ring is\nreleasing estrogen locally as\nopposed to taking it orally.\nBut you would you\nslot it under what\nyou're about to tell us\nin terms of the concerns?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: So we have\nless data about the ring.\nSo the oral contraceptive\nis two hormones.\nIt's ethinylestradiol,\nand it's a progestin.\nSo it's not the\nnormal progesterone\nthat your body makes, that your\novaries make, and your adrenals\nmake.\nIt is a synthetic\nform of progesterone.\nAnd it is the same progestin--\nsimilar, same class\nthat was shown to be dangerous\nand provocative in the Women's\nHealth Initiative.\nSo I'm not a fan of progestins.\nI do not recommend\nthem for any woman\nunless the consequence\nof not taking them\nis surgery or some other--\nunless it gives them\nsome freedom in some way.\nSo I don't like progestins.\nThe NuvaRing is\nestrogen plus progestin,\nbut it's released transdermally\nthrough the vagina.\nSo given the way that it's\ndelivered to the vagina,\nthe doses are lower than\nwhat's taken orally.\nBut in terms of some\nof the risks that I'm\nabout to talk about, we don't\nknow about much of the data.\nWe think that it's similar.\nThere's probably a\nspectrum of risk,\nand the NuvaRing is a little\nmore towards the middle\nthan what I'm talking about\nwith oral contraceptives.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Are\nyou ready for that?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nI'm ready for the risks.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: OK.\nSo like with almost\nany pharmaceutical,\nthe oral contraceptive depletes\ncertain micronutrients,\nso magnesium.\nThere are certain vitamin\nBs that are depleted.\nIt also affects the microbiome.\nThat data is not as strong, but\nthere seems to be some effect.\nAnd there's also\nan increased risk\nof inflammatory bowel disease\nand autoimmune condition.\nIt increases inflammatory tone.\nSo the studies that\nI've seen increase\none of the markers\nof inflammatory tone,\nhigh-sensitivity CRP,\nby about 2 to 3x.\nIt seems to make the\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\naxis more rigid so that\nyou can't kind of roll\nwith the punches\nand wax and wane\nin terms of cortisol\nproduction the way\nthat you can off the\nbirth control pill.\nIt can affect thyroid function.\nI'm thinking of the slide\nthat I have that has,\nlike, 10 problems associated\nwith the oral contraceptive,\nbut that's what I can\nremember right now.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's very helpful,\nand it makes me wonder whether\nor not if, on the one hand,\noral contraceptives\nare protective\nin women against\novarian cancer, but then\nthey have these other issues.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Yeah, there's\none other I want to mention.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Please.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Any time\nyou take oral estrogen,\nit raises sex hormone\nbinding globulin,\nand you've talked to other\npodcast guests about this--\nKyle, I think.\nSex hormone binding\nglobulin, I think\nof as a sponge that\nsoaks up free estrogen\nand free testosterone.\nSo when you go on the\nbirth control pill,\nyou raise your sex\nhormone binding globulin.\nIt soaks up especially\nfree testosterone.\nAnd for some women,\nit's not a big deal.\nThey don't notice\nmuch of a difference.\nBut then there's a phenotype,\nmaybe related to CAG repeats\non the androgen\nreceptor, who are\nexquisitely sensitive to that\ndecline in free testosterone.\nSo this then opens the portal\nof talking a little bit\nabout testosterone in women.\nSo we've mentioned\nalready that it's\nthe most abundant, biologically\nthe most abundant hormone\nin the female system.\nEven though men make\nalmost 10 times as much\nor even more than 10 times,\nit is so important for women.\nIt is essential to so many\nthings, not just sex drive\nand muscle mass and\nseeing a response\nto resistance training, but\nalso confidence and agency.\nAnd so those women who are so\nsensitive to their testosterone\nlevel-- they've got this high\nsex hormone binding globulin.\nTheir testosterone declines.\nWhat they describe is\nvaginal dryness, maybe\na decline in sex drive.\nBut there's also\nthis bigger issue\nrelated to confidence\nand agency,\neven risk-taking from\nstudies that we've\ndone with MBA students, that\nI think is a serious problem.\nMaybe the most important\nout of all of these things\nis that it can shrink the\nclitoris by up to 20%.\n20%.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd that includes\nthe regression of the nerves\nthat innervate the clitoris?\nIs that-- I mean, it--\nSARA GOTTFRIED: That's\na very good question\nas a neuroscientist.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, I would think--\nI used to teach the neural\nside of reproductive health.\nWe need to do a series\non sexual health.\nMaybe you would\nco-host that with me--\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --because\nwe could certainly\nuse your expertise.\nI think, yeah,\nthat's a dramatic--\nSARA GOTTFRIED: It's dramatic.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --number.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Yeah,\nbut then let's go back\nto the sacred marketing.\nIf I've got a woman that I\nthink should not be on the birth\ncontrol pill-- maybe\nshe's taking it for acne,\nor she's taking it because her\nperiods were a little painful.\nWhat I'm going to do\nis say, let's leverage\nthese other ways of making\nyour period less painful.\nLet's take the message\nof your painful periods\nand figure out, OK, is it\nyour inflammatory tone?\nAnd we give you some\nfish oil and SPMs,\nmaybe a little aspirin when\nyou've got your period.\nLike, let's find some\nother ways to deal with it,\nthan to take the oral\ncontraceptive, which\nyou have not received informed\nconsent about, because it can\nshrink your clit by up to 20%.\nNow, that usually convinces\nmost people to come off of it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIs that reversible?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: The elevation\nin sex hormone binding globulin\ndoes not seem to go away when\nyou come off the birth control\npill.\nTo me, that is the\nbiggest problem\nwith prescribing\noral contraceptives.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
