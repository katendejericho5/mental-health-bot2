    "transcript": "SARA GOTTFRIED: I recently\ngave a lecture on breast\ncancer risk reduction.\nAnd I was sad to find\nthat intake of vegetables,\npolyphenols, is such\nan important predictor\nof future risk of breast\ncancer when you're 50, 60-plus.\nAnd the most important time\nis when you're a teenager.\nNow, I have one daughter\nthat eats vegetables.\nShe loves them.\nAnd I have another daughter\nwho eats food that's beige.\nAnd it's very hard\nto get her to eat\nthe volume of vegetables,\nfive colors a day,\nwhich is what I do.\nAnd if you have evidence that\nyou could show a 17-year-old\nthat they've got\nmicronutrient gaps,\nI think that would\nbe a motivator\nfor them to eat differently at\na time when it's so critical,\neven though it's 25\nyears in the future\nthat it's going to potentially\nchange this arc that they're\non.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What do\nyou do for a young woman who\ndoesn't like\nvegetables or is not\nsomehow able or willing\nto get those five\ncolors a day of vegetable to\nhelp support the microbiome?\nAre supplements a useful\ntool in that case?\nWhat other sorts of tools,\nbehavioral or otherwise,\nare useful?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Such\na good question.\nSo here, I'm going to\ninvoke Rob Knight at UCSD.\nSo I think his gut\nproject has really\nbeen helpful in terms of\nunderstanding what kind\nof modulators are\ngoing to be important.\nSo what I try to get\nthat person to do--\nand I don't see\nmany teens anymore,\nother than NBA players.\nWhat I try to get them to\ndo is to have a smoothie.\nVery hard to get them to\nhave a smoothie every day.\nBut if I could get them to have\na smoothie three times a week\nand to throw some of\nthese vegetables in,\nthat makes a huge difference.\nI mean, we know that\nmakes a difference\nin terms of microbiome change.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Should it be\na blending up broccoli or kale?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Cauliflower,\nso cauliflower is great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Bell peppers,\neven they're putting things\ninto the smoothie.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: Yeah, I don't\nknow if you can get a teenager\nto do that, but they\noften will use--\nlike, I have them do steamed\nbroccoli that's in the freezer\nbecause it's got\nvery little taste.\nSo that, they could do that\nin a chocolate smoothie.\nThey could add some greens.\nI like greens.\nPowders are super convenient.\nSo that with a taste\nthat they like,\nwhether that's chocolate, which\nis what most of my clients\nwant, or vanilla with berries\nand that sort of thing.\nSo that can go a long way if\nyou don't like vegetables.\nAnd short of that, I would\nsay some supplements,\nbut I would say that's a distant\nsecond to making a smoothie.\nI've got one patient that I have\nto mention because he took this\nto the extreme.\nSo he is a retired\nphysicist professor at UCSD.\nHe found out that his microbiome\nwas a hot mess and developed\nautoimmune disease.\nAnd so he became hell bent\nlike only a physicist could\non changing his microbiome.\nAnd he dramatically shifted it\nby having a smoothie every day\nwith 57 vegetables\nand fruits in it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: 57 independent?\nSARA GOTTFRIED: 57 independent.\nSo, I mean, this just warms my\nheart the way that he did this.\nBut he would go to\nthe farmer's market.\nHe would just get a bunch\nof this, a bunch of that.\nAnd he would go home,\nmake the smoothie,\nand then stick it\nin the freezer.\nSo he'd have a\nserving every day.\nAnd he became a completely\ndifferent person\nbased on this microbiome change.\nHis autoimmune disease\nis in remission.\nHe dropped a huge\namount of weight.\nHe went from being\nkind of this phenotype\nthat I know you know well of\na professor, high-performing\nand traveling around the\nworld, on so many boards,\nso much innovation, so many\ngreat ideas, super computer\nguy, to being someone who\ngets up in the morning,\ngets in his hot tub, exercises\nfor one to two hours a day,\nand then does a little work.\nLike, he completely shifted\nthe way that he lives.\nAnd his microbiome shift--\nwho knows what's the chicken\nand what's the egg there.\nBut he had a huge change\nin his physiology.\nGlucose went from\nbeing quite high.\nAnd he tracks all\nof this, of course.\nIt's like-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nScientist, after all.\nSARA GOTTFRIED: --[INAUDIBLE].\nRight.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nretired, I suppose\nmight have had [INAUDIBLE].\nSARA GOTTFRIED:\nAnd he's retired,\nbut he's got the longest\ntime series of anyone I know.\nAnd he's tracked his glucose\nand insulin going back 20 years.\nSo he can show you,\nOK, here's where\nI started having my\nsmoothie, and here's\nhow my glucose and insulin\nchanged as a result of that.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
