    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: We know\nthat one of the things that\ncan trigger the\nonset of puberty--\nin particular in females--\nis that when enough body\nfat accumulates, that body\nfat releases a hormone called\nleptin, and that\nhormone leptin travels\nin the bloodstream, across\nthe blood-brain barrier,\nand goes to the\nhypothalamus and can\ntrigger the onset of\npuberty by activating\nthe neurons that release\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone.\nSo many people believe that\none of the reasons that puberty\nis happening earlier\nand earlier in females\nis because of the accumulation\nof more body fat at younger\nages than was observed 30 or\n40 and certainly 100 years ago.\nNow, I can already imagine a\nnumber of people are thinking,\noh, this must relate\nto the obesity crisis.\nAnd indeed, there is\na crisis of obesity.\nObesity is something that is\ncausing all sorts of problems\nwith people's health at\nvarious levels, brain and body,\nand that is far\nmore frequent today\nthan it was even 20 years ago.\nSo it is indeed a\ncrisis because it\nhas enormous detrimental\neffects for so many aspects\nof brain and body\nhealth and longevity.\nBut this whole process of\nthinking about body fat\nsignaling leptin to the\nhypothalamus and the onset\nof puberty doesn't\nnecessarily have\nto do with the obesity crisis.\nIt might relate, but it could\nalso relate to, for instance,\nimproved nutrition,\nwhich is allowing body\nfat stores to accumulate maybe\nnot to the level of obesity\nbut to accumulate earlier\nand at younger ages\nin females, which\nis then causing\nearlier puberty in females.\nTo just highlight how\nthat might be possible,\nI want to review some data that\ntalk about the onset of menses,\nmenstruation-- that is,\npuberty-- in females\naccording to country\nand according\nto age over the last\n100 or more years.\nSo what are the\ngeneral trends in terms\nof the onset of\npuberty in females?\nWell, that's an\neasy one to answer.\nOver the last 100 years or\nso, the onset of puberty\nhas been occurring much earlier\nwith each passing decade.\nIt's really an incredible\nset of statistics.\nI will provide a\nlink to these data\nsince I know a number of\nyou are listening and not\njust watching on YouTube.\nThis is from a study in\nwhich the onset of puberty\nhas been analyzed from\nas early as the 1850s--\nin certain countries, there are\ndata on that-- out to the 1970s\nand in other countries\nstarting at about 1900,\nextending out to about 1990.\nThese are ongoing\ncollections of data.\nBut just to give you a sense\nof how the data are falling out\nin a couple of\ndifferent countries,\njust to give you a flavor--\nbut for those of you listening\nand for those of you\nwatching, the essence\nof all of these\nfindings is that puberty\nis happening much, much earlier\nwith each passing decade.\nSo for instance, in the United\nStates, around 1900 or 1903,\nthe average age of menarche,\nthe onset of puberty, in females\nwas about 14 years old, whereas\nin 1990, the average age is 11.\nSo that's a pretty\nsignificant, we can say,\nacceleration of the\nonset of puberty.\nNow, of course,\nthese are averages.\nSo there will be exceptions.\nThere's a distribution of data.\nToday, still, there will\nbe young females who\nwill undergo puberty at age\n11 or 10 or maybe even 9\nand others who will undergo\npuberty at age 13, 14, maybe\neven 16 or 17.\nHowever, if we look\nat, for instance,\nthe data from Norway, which\ndates back quite far-- they\nhave excellent record-keeping--\nto 1850, what we see\nis that the average age of the\nonset of female puberty in 1850\nin Norway was 17 years\nold, whereas in 1970, it's\n13 years old.\nSo this is a\ndramatic acceleration\nof the onset of puberty.\nAnd you see a similar trend\nin other countries, as well.\nSo if we were to look,\nfor instance, in the UK,\nthey have a smaller data\nset, meaning it only\nextends back to about 1940.\nBut the average age of the onset\nof puberty in the UK in 1940\nwas 13 and 1/2 years old.\nAgain, this is just for females.\nAnd in 1970, it\nwas closer to 13,\nwith a trend towards\ndeclining even further.\nUnfortunately, they\ndidn't continue\nto collect data out to 2022.\nAnd as a final point, if we\nwere to look at, for instance,\nin Germany and Finland,\nthe average onset\nof puberty in 1870 was\n16 and 1/2 years old.\nBy 1940, it was down to\n13 and 1/2 years old.\nSo all of these data have\nborne out over and over again,\nregardless of location in the\nworld, which is important,\nbecause when you start to\nthink about the obesity crisis,\nyou can say, well, that's\nmainly in developed countries,\nbelieve it or not-- or\nperhaps not surprisingly.\nAnd maybe it has to do\nwith the obesity crisis.\nAnd yet I don't think we\ncan conclude that at all.\nSomething is happening, however.\nIt could be increased\nbody fat stores\ndue to overeating and obesity.\nHowever, it could also\nbe-- unrelated to obesity,\nit could be, for\ninstance, improved\nnutrition and the availability\nof quality nutrition, which\ncan signal the\nmaturation of the brain\nand body mechanisms that\ntrigger the onset of puberty,\novulatory cycle,\nand menstruation.\nSo we want to be very careful\nabout leaping to conclusions\nabout what these trends mean,\nbut the trends themselves\nare very, very apparent.\nAnd as a final\npoint, I should also\nmention that there are a\nnumber of different behavioral\nand psychosocial, as they're\ncalled, interactions that\ncan influence puberty as well.\nThis has been most strikingly\nobserved in animals.\nAnd so I don't want\nanyone to be alarmed\nor to leap to any great\nconclusions about the onset\nof timing of puberty\nin humans, but I'd\nbe remiss if I didn't tell you\nabout a certain result which\nshows that if a young female\nis exposed to the odor-- not\nnecessarily the pheromones.\nThere's a distinction between\nodors that we perceive\nand pheromones, which\nare subconscious.\nWe don't actively perceive, but\nthat can impact our biology,\nand pheromones effects in\nhumans are very controversial.\nBut we know, for instance, that\nif you take a female animal--\nand there's some\nevidence from humans\nthat if you take a\nyoung prepubertal female\nand you expose her to the scent\nof a reproductively-competent\nmale for a series of days,\nbut maybe even as short\nas a few hours,\nand she is also not\nregularly being exposed to\nthe scent of her father,\nthat she can undergo\npuberty earlier.\nThat's right.\nThere is something\nabout the odor\nand/or pheromones, or\nperhaps something else, that\noccurs when a young prepubertal\nfemale has a father that she's\nin regular contact with.\nHe wouldn't necessarily have\nto live at home but that\nis around a lot that\nhis smell is registered\nby her biological systems.\nThat-- I don't want\nto say protects\nbecause it kind of skews the\nvalence of the conversation,\nbut that offsets or buffers\nthe otherwise observed effect,\nwhich is that the scent of a\nreproductively-competent male,\nif it's present often enough\nor perhaps intensely enough,\nthat it can trigger the onset\nof puberty in that female.\nIn other words, the scent of\na male that is not the father\nand we think also that is not\nbiologically related to her\ncan trigger earlier\nonset of puberty.\nAnd that effect can at\nleast be partially buffered\nby her being in the\npresence of the scent\nfrom her biological father.\nNow, some of you are\nprobably already leaping\nto conclusions about\nwhat this means.\nShould you not\nallow your daughter\nto be exposed to\nany males who are\nof reproductive age, et cetera?\nThat's certainly\nnot what I'm saying.\nThere's a huge number\nof considerations\nthat go into that\ncalculation for everybody\nand circumstances, et cetera.\nBut the point is that\nthe odors of individuals,\nboth related-- in\nparticular, closely related--\nand non-related individuals,\ncan shape the neural systems\nand the hormone systems that\ncan trigger the onset of puberty\nor suppress the\nonset of puberty.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
