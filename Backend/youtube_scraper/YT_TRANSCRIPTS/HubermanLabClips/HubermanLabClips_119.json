    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, I've always\nnoticed that there\nare certain muscle\ngroups that are very easy\nto isolate when under load.\nAnd those are almost always\nthe same muscle groups\nthat are easy to contract\nvery hard without any load\nwhatsoever.\nANDY GALPIN: Bingo.\nThat's actually\nreally insightful.\nSo you can use this\nheuristic of like,\nif you can contract\nyour lats just\nstanding here, you're probably\ngoing to contract them\nvery well when you lift.\nIf you can't, you can probably\nassume about the same thing's\ngoing to happen.\nSo yeah, you'll know.\nThis actually-- the\nlats are actually\nreally interesting\nbecause they tend\nto be one of the more\ndifficult muscle groups\nto learn how to activate.\nSo if you're in your journey\nand you're just like,\nI have no idea.\nAnd you can look\nup like a lat pose.\nSo how do you-- how do\nyou puff your lats out,\nhow do you show it?\nAnd if you do that\nand you're like, wow,\nthere's no movement\nhere, just recognize\nthat's extremely common.\nAnd it's probably\ngoing to take you many,\nmany, many months\nof trying before you\nstart to see some movements.\nAnd probably even a few\nyears before you really\nstart to see activation.\nSo you're not some sort of\nspecific, special genetic\nanomaly.\nIt's very, very common.\nIt's uncommon to not be able\nto activate your biceps, right?\nThat everyone can do that.\nBut if you're just like,\nman, I can't get this here.\nI'm just going to stop doing it.\nDo not do that.\nJust keep at it.\nAnd just keep\nconcentrating and thinking\nabout that muscle group.\nIt will take some time.\nIt's very common to have\nchallenges activating lats.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, I've noticed\nthat many of the\nmuscle groups that\nwere responsible for a\nlarge fraction of the work\nin the various sports that\nI played as a young child\nare muscles that are very\neasy for me to selectively\nisolate and induce hypertrophy.\nI suppose I'm one of those\nmutants where my lats happen\nto be one such of\nthose muscle groups,\nbut I think that's because I\nswam a lot when I was a kid.\nANDY GALPIN: I was literally\ngoing to ask, were you\na swimmer.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nANDY GALPIN: That's\na telltale sign.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, everyone\nevery kid in my town swam\nand played soccer.\nANDY GALPIN: There you go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And then later\nI skateboarded and did some--\nANDY GALPIN: You\ngenerally hear that answer\nis you either were a swimmer\nor you were a wrestler.\nSo it's like that pulling\nand pull towards you\nis-- thousands of repetitions\nallowed you to get\nvery good at contracting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut because I also\nplayed soccer and skateboarding,\nbut I didn't do any baseball,\nbasketball or football,\nmuscle groups like deltoids\nare very challenging to\nactivate and isolate.\nSo I do think that early\ndevelopment is superimposed\non a genetic template that\nsort of predicts which\nmuscle groups are going\nto be easier or harder\nto isolate and train.\nANDY GALPIN: It's\nalso a very good case\nfor why it's important to do\nas many different athletic\nactivities as you\ncan in your youth.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nAnd if you do\nskateboard, definitely\nlearn to ride switch.\nBecause every\nskateboarder I know\nhas one leg that's\nlarger than the other.\nAnd one calf that's\nlarger than the other.\nAnd actually, for\nthat matter, people\nthat do martial arts that\ndon't learn to-- if they're not\nsouthpaw, if they don't learn\nto switch up and do their work\nsouthpaw, you see\nthe same thing.\nI mean, you're building an\nasymmetry into the system.\nAnd it's not just\nmuscular, it's neural.\nANDY GALPIN: Oh, for sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's strongly neural.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nyeah, kids-- parents,\nget your kids doing a\nbunch of different things.\nI suppose gymnastics\nwould probably\nbe the best sport all\naround, in terms of movement\nin multiple planes\nand activating all\nthe different muscle groups.\nANDY GALPIN: Yes and no.\nThere's a lot of benefit,\nno question about it.\nThere's a lot of other\nthings, though, that\nhas limited ability.\nSo almost everything\nin-- gymnastics\ngreat, but almost everything\nin that is pre-planned.\nWhich is a major\ndownfall, right?\nSo the joy of skating is there's\nso much proprioceptive input,\nthat you have to make decisions\nvery quickly in small windows.\nNow you have a\nlittle bit of that\nwhen you're flipping in the\nair and you have to land\nbut you-- gymnasts tend to\nhave a very specific routine\nthat they're working on.\nAnd they work on that\nroutine for years.\nAnyway, so-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSkateboarding, for me,\nwas transportation.\nIt was freedom.\nAnd it didn't require any\ncoaches or parental oversight.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah.\nBall sports have the beauty of\nreaction and things like that.\nSo all of them are wonderful.\nYeah.\nGood to do a lot of them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou've established\nthat 10-- really,\nto 20 sets per week\nis the kind of bounds for\nmaintaining and initiating\nhypertrophy.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, if I\nwere to flag one of them,\nI would say 15 to 20\nis the sets that you\nwant to get working now.\nIt gets complicated\nwhen you ask, well,\nhow many reps per set\ndo I have to get to?\nOK, well, we also\ncan complicate that\nby repetition type and tempo.\nJust sort of let all that\ngo for now and just think,\nif you're getting close to\nthat range, you're in the spot.\nAnd all you have to do\nnow is balance two things.\nRecovery and continued training.\nSo if you're somewhere in this\n10 to 20 working set's range\nand you're in a position\nwhere you can continue\nto do that, you're not\nso sore and so damaged\nand beat up that you can't\nmaintain that volume for eight\nweeks at a time, or at\nleast six weeks at a time,\nthen I'd probably say either\nthe style of repetitions,\nthe amount of repetitions per\nset you're doing are too much.\nThe volume is getting to you.\nHowever, if you're not seeing\nadaptations, then I'd say maybe\nthe repetitions aren't enough.\nAnd so that's like-- that's the\nkind of game you're running.\nNow, there could be\nplenty of other factors.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Intensity.\nANDY GALPIN: Of course.\nYeah, intensity, intent.\nAnd then of course,\nthe other things.\nSleep, nutrition, et cetera,\nall these other things\nthat go into our visible\nstressor category\nthat we always analyze.\nThis sort of brings up this\nidea of responders and non\nresponders.\nSo we get this one a ton.\nSo why is it some people,\nmy gym buddy, my roommate,\nwe go to sleep at\nthe same time, we're\non the same nutrition\nplan, we work out together.\nShe triples in muscle size and\nI don't have no gain whatsoever.\nWell, there's a lot\nof work that we're\ntrying to do to identify\nthe molecular mechanisms\nbehind responders\nand non-responders,\nbecause they clearly exist.\nIn fact, this is one\nof the reasons why\nevery paper I basically will\never publish again, if I do,\nalways reports\nindividual person data.\nSo rather than\ngroup averages, you\nget to see if there's\n10 subjects in it,\nyou get to see how each\nof the 10 responded.\nBecause the group average\ncan get confusing.\nWhat you really want to see\nis how many, actually, people\ngot better, how many got\nworse, how many maybe change.\nAnd if so-- so we'll always\nreport those individual data\nbecause when you go\nto train, you're you.\nYou're not the group average.\nThat's very important to know.\nSo if you do that, you\ncan see a beautiful line\nof these hyper\nresponders, the bell\ncurve in the middle, the normal\nresponders, and those folks\nwho, like through\nany training study,\njust won't get any better.\nIf you can tease out\nwhat you can't, but let's\nsay in science you\ncould tease out\nall the extra factors, total\nstress, load hydration, sleep,\net cetera, what you\noften see is non\nresponders, a lot\nof the time, it's\nnot that they have a\nphysiological inability,\nit's just that they need\na different protocol.\nAnd a lot of times it's\nthey just need more volume.\nSo if they can handle that and\nthey're not excessively beat\nup, just give them more\nvolume and they tend\nto see a lot of breakthroughs.\nYou see the same\nthing with plateaus.\nSo typically, it's sort of just\nlike, the routine you're on,\nyou've been on it for too long.\nWe need to either\ngo to the other end\nof the hypertrophy spectrum for\nintensity, which means like,\nif you've been in the 60% to 70%\nyour one repetition max range,\nmaybe we actually\nneed to go heavier.\nTake our repetitions down,\nmaybe even our total volume down\nand go heavier.\nTry that.\nA great way to break\nthrough plateaus of gran--\nif all the other\nboxes are checked.\nThe other one is\ndo the opposite,\nwhich is like OK, we're\ngoing to go higher.\nWe're going to go sets\nof 20, sets of 25.\nVery high repetition range\nand really get after it.\nNot undo as much\ndamage because you\ndon't tend to get as sore from\nthose really high repetition\nranges.\nYou'll get more sore from\nthe lower repetition,\nhigher intensity range\nthan you will, typically,\nthe other ones.\nAnd see if we can bust\nthrough some plateaus there.\nSo it just generally\nmeans you need\nto do something a little bit\ndifferent than your training\npartner.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
