    "transcript": "how should people think about systemic\ndamage and Recovery because obviously\nthe nervous system and the way it\ninteracts with the neuromuscular system\nis the site of all the action here or at\nleast a lot of the action\nand the nervous system can in fact\nbecome fatigued yeah it's you know that\nhas a great capacity but the whole\nsystem that we're talking about can be\nworked to the extent that even if a\nmuscle group like the biceps or the back\nis being allowed to rest while you're\ntraining legs and other muscle groups\nthat your whole neuromuscular system\nneeds rest how does one determine\nwhether or not your entire body needs\ncomplete rest or or low level active\nrest or exercise of a different kind\nyeah yeah sure so I want to actually\ntackle this because we're on the topic\nof hypertrophy I'm assuming that that's\nthe goal in mind here yes here I'm\nasking specifically within the context\nof hypertrophy I realized that for other\ntraining goals the answer this question\ncould be quite different yeah okay so we\nactually do this in a couple of\ndifferent ways let's start local and\nwork back to systemic right because you\num number one what you're really\nconcerned about is at the local muscle\nlevel is am I going to create excessive\ndamage\nand I don't necessarily mean muscle\ndamage here I mean injury right so um\nthe kind of rule of thumb we use is like\nthree out of ten in terms of soreness if\nyou're more than three out of ten in\nterms of soreness\num we're gonna start asking questions if\nyou're higher than six out of ten we're\nprobably not training this is subjective\ntotal subjective measure right and\nyou'll you'll know very quickly right I\nfeel like if you can barely graze your\nPEC with your fingertip and then you're\nlike ah I don't care what you score that\nwe're not training there's just no\ndamage if you're three out of ten if\nyou're just like oh I'm kind of like a\nlittle bit stiff here but once you get\nwarmed up you start feeling okay you're\nprobably okay to proceed there so that\nis is\na very easy way to just think about\nsoreness you're going to be a little bit\ntight depending on your training\nfrequency\nnow zooming out to systemic we use a\nwhole host of things so we actually have\na a whole host of biomarkers we use you\ncan get a lot of these from blood so you\ncan look at things like creatine kinase\nthat's the very common one marker of\nmuscle damage we'll actually look at LDH\nwe'll look at myoglobulin that's just\nlike if you think about hemoglobin is\nthe\num is the molecule that carries oxygen\nthroughout your blood the myoglobin is\nthe the part of that that's actually in\nmuscle so when muscle gets broken down\nthat gets leaked out and put in your\nblood that's one of the markers actually\nthat's going to be associated with\nthings like rhabdo which is a like\nyou're going to see your urine is purple\nand it's extremely dark because you've\ngot so much muscle breakdown that that\nhappens and kidneys can have a problem\nand you put a bunch of stuff in there so\nwe use those biomarkers we'll actually\nalso look at probably a couple things\nyou're familiar with alt and ASD these\nare excellent biomarkers of muscle\nbreakdown so if we are actually\nsuspecting that this is a chronic\nproblem we're going to actually go and\nthem in pull some blood if it's just\nlike I'm super sore today we're going to\nuse that subjective marker but if we're\nseeing this as constant like man are we\nreally push pushing you way too much is\nthere some sort of systemic problem\nwe're going to blood and we're going to\nlook at all those different things now\nAST to alt is is really specific and I\ndon't want to take us too far off track\nhere but the ratio to those things is\nactually very important as well so if\nyou look at the AST to alt ratio\ntypically the number we'll look at is\nlike 1.67 as that ratio is like higher\nthan that you have a pretty high risk of\nmuscle damage but really\nbetween you know me and you and a few of\nthese listeners anytime we start seeing\nAST out kick alt we're immediately\nthinking as in the ratio being higher\nthan one we're immediately thinking like\nthere's something happening muscle\ndamage wise so um that's actually a\nsneaky good indicator of just total\nmuscle mass because the vast majority of\nthat's going to be in muscle so those\nare actually some markers that we like a\nlot if muscle damage is the thing we're\nconcerned with if we are more concerned\nwith things like total training volume\nsystemic overload then we may turn to\nsomething more like sleep there's a lot\nof information we can actually get gland\nfrom changes in sleep behavior and\nfunction you could also look at things\nlike HRV heart rate variability which is\na very classic marker and much more\nsensitive to changes with training than\nsomething like a resting heart rate\nwhich is which is one thing you can\nactually do that's totally cost free\njust look at your changes and any\nelevation resting heart rate over time\nespecially more than three to five\nconsecutive days it is an indicator but\nHIV is much more sensitive to things\nlike training induced overload so that's\na quick version of stuff that we're\ngoing to pay attention to the last one I\nwould add there is simply motivation\nso if you're really training hard and\nyou like training hard and you just like\ncannot force yourself to go anymore that\nin of itself can be a good indication of\nit's maybe not the day maybe not the\nweek with all of these things you want\nto be careful about overreacting to a\nsingle day measure again we look we need\nto look at at least a trend of more than\nthree days honestly I'm looking at more\nthan five days I'm gonna pull back from\nthat and think about what phase of\ntraining we're in what part of the Year\nwe're in typically with our athletes\nwe're in season preseason post-season\noff season Etc to make our decisions\nabout what we're going to do about it\nare we canning the entire workout are we\ndoing a modified lower version lower\nintensity my default generally if\nhypertrophy is the goal remember\nvolume is the driver there so if I can\nlike can we get in can we go real light\nlet's go to 6 out of 10 rpe so relative\nperceived exertion maybe we'll reduce\nthe range of motion maybe we'll make it\na little bit easier maybe go to machines\nor instead of going a squat we'll just\ndo you know uh leg extension something\nlike that but I want to still get enough\nvolume in there that will keep you on\ntarget any again even going at 50 not\nnot to high repetition you know 50 for a\nset of ten three sets just get a nice\nblood flow in there get it in get it out\naid in recovery and then move on and\ncome back the next day that's probably\nwhat I would do rather than canning the\nentire session\nforeign\n[Music]"
