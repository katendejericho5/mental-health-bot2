    "transcript": "can we just get a brief recap of the\ngeneral parameters for an excellent\npower and strength training program okay\nlet me hit you with these rapid fire and\nthen you can maybe come and ask\nquestions along that remember those\nmodifiable variables okay so let's go\nthrough them in order and then what they\nmean specifically for power versus\nstrength so modifiable variable number\none is called choice so which exercises\ndo I select for strength in general for\npower or speed or strength we want to\nselect compound movements you don't\noften see people doing maximum strength\nwork for like a tricep Kickback right\nit's typically multiple joint movements\nand typically complex\num movements\nin selecting these compound movements we\ngenerally want to actually think about\nexercise selection of movements rather\nthan muscle groups so this is an\nimportant distinction because we'll see\nthis is a different answer when we get\nto hypertrophy what I mean by that is\nwhen we think about again strength\ntraining we tend to think about\nbodybuilding Concepts we go to the gym\nand we do things like I got to make sure\nI get my chest today and I got to make\nsure I get my hamstrings and now you're\nselecting exercises based on a muscle\nyou want to work for strength\ndevelopment and power we want to think\nabout movements rather than individual\nmuscle groups so there should be like\nthings like I need to train explosive\nhip extension which is like a a vertical\njump or something like that I I want to\ntrain pushing or pulling movements or I\nwant to attain road trip I want to train\nrotation which is a whole area we\nhaven't gotten into which is very\nimportant for overall health and\nwellness and Longevity so we want to\nselect big movements by the muscle the\nmovement patterns that we want to\nintroduce and we just want to select a\nreasonable balance between these I don't\ncare what the exact ratio is you just\ndon't want to go an entire six months\nwithout doing anything in this\nrotational area or an entire you know\neight to ten weeks without doing\nsomething\nthat's a lower body hinge right so any\nnumber of examples there so just think\nabout the rough movement patterns upper\nand lower push and pull and then some\nsort of rotation that puts you in a\npretty good spot if you're using three\nby five method and you're going to pick\nas little as three exercises just pick\none from each one of those groups pick a\nrotation\npick a push and pick a pull\nI can easily think of a pushing a pull\num so for example bench press or\nshoulder press sure row or chin for pull\nand then squat or deadlift for hinge yep\nwhat would be a good example of a\nquality rotational movement yep so\nanytime\num you can use a cable machine like at\nthe gym and you can do it's kind of hard\nto describe this exercise but basically\nyou're going to stand facing the cable\nand you're going to pull it towards\nyourself and then rotate like you're\npivoting like your either swing angle\ngolf club or hitting a baseball bat so\nyou're facing One Direction I'm facing\nyou right now I'm pulling the cable\ntowards myself and then I'm going to\nspin do a 180 degree pivot and face\nexactly away from you when I finish and\nthen return it back to that same spot so\nthat's a rotation great we will provide\na link to an example of that that you\nconsider a quality example a medicine\nball throw any number of things like\nthis are a great rotational exercise all\nright so we select our exercises based\non that we generally then okay because\nthat that is the case we don't worry\nabout things like eccentric versus\nconcentric because you're deadly doing a\nwhole body athletic movement right which\nThe Eccentric concentric portion is\ngoing to be folded into that you really\ncan't separate them out all right so\nthat's exercise Choice our first\nvariable the next one is exercise order\nso because that everything driving power\nand strength is quality based you want\nto do these at the beginning of your\nworkout you would not want to do\nanything fatiguing before this so no\ncardiovascular training no other\nrepetition to failure stuff if you do\nthose before and now you're slower all\nyou've done is practice getting slower\nand and so these need to be done when\nyou're fresh you also need to do them\nwhen you're very fresh because they're\nthe most neurologically demanding\nthey're complicated they tend to have\nmultiple steps and they're often in\nmultiple planes and coordination is a\ndifficult thing and if you're trying to\ndo all that at maximum speed your\nnervous system needs to be tremendously\nfresh and so any amount of fatigue here\nis only going to compromise the results\num to kind of recap that one of the\nmajor mistakes when training for\nstrength and especially power is people\nworry way too much about fatigue those\nthings should not be part of the\nequation in fact if they are that's a\nvery good sign you're not doing this\ncorrectly right these are non-fatiguing\nmovements especially speed and Power\nso Choice order is next\num the next one after that is volume and\nwe sort of hit volume and intensity\nwhich is the other one we talked about\nthat the volume is basically identical\nbetween power and strength the the\ngeneral number we're going to look at\nhere is something like 3 to 20 sets\ntotal per workout per workout\num but that would be like 20 would be\na little bit of a special case now three\nto five is what I told you earlier right\nI'm just saying like sometimes you can\nactually go quite higher in this cases\nbut that's the general range and once\nsomebody finishes the three by five\nworkout for power or strength if they\ndecide they want to throw in some calf\nraises and curls and totally a forearm\nwork or a little bit of jogging on the\ntreadmill or something that's okay\nabsolutely there is you have very little\nrisk of interference\nfor things like speed and Power\nstrength you have a little bit of a risk\nonly because now you're introducing\nfatigue which if you're really pushing\nstrength that might compromise your\nrecovery uh I could imagine doing the\nthree to five routine for strength or\nfor power and then somebody finishing up\nwith\num 10 or 15 minutes of hypertrophy arm\nwork and then being very seriously\ncompromised if they try and come in the\nnext day or even the next day correct\nand do those big compound movements for\nSpeed and power that's right not just\nbecause they're sore but the muscles may\nactually still be damaged and I know\nlater we're going to talk about the\num somewhat tenuous relationship between\nsoreness and Recovery yeah yep so that\nthat's a that's a really nice uh\nheuristic to pay attention to is you can\nbut just be careful\nEnergy starts to matter at that point if\nyou're really truly trying to maximize\nstrength\nyou would do nothing at all outside of\nthat training if you're just like I kind\nof want to get stronger and some other\nthings and you're willing to lose\nstrength you know five percent of your\nstrength gains then you're totally fine\num the same can be said by the way for\nsupersetting so supersetting is an idea\nthat says like wait a minute you're\ntelling me dude I gotta take five\nminutes in between each set well that's\nnot so much a problem nowadays with\nphone with um smartphones because people\nare filling their intercept intervals\nwith social media and texting correct\nyou don't really have to go that long in\nfact there was actually a study that\ncame out in the last month that showed\nyou know like really two minutes is\nprobably sufficient for most people\nhaving said that if you really are\ntrying to push maximum strength\nadaptations like three to five is very\nvery reasonable\num your those training sessions are long\ncause you have to take you're spending\nmore time not doing anything\nthen you are doing something but you're\ntrying to maximize quality so that's\njust sort of like part and parcel if\nyou're not super worried about it you\ncan actually do super setting which is\nlet's imagine again you're going to do\nsome some lunges and while your legs are\nresting doing their three to five\nminutes you can go over and do an upper\nbody row or pull\nand when your upper body is resting\nyou're going back to legs so that really\nCuts your time in half is it ideal no we\nactually ran a study uh maybe 10 years\nago in our lab and we looked at that\nspecifically and we did see a reduction\nin strength performance in the\nsupersetting group relative to the group\nwho did not superset\nthe question then it becomes like is it\nenough for you to care so if you were to\nif I were to say hey I can cut an hour\noff of your workout time but you will\nlose five percent of your strength gain\nalmost everyone would take that exchange\nwith the exception of people who are\ngetting close to competition or really\ntrying to set a new lifetime PR or\nsomething then you might say no I don't\nwant any interference there that last\nlittle margin is what I care about gave\nme the extra rest great so it's not a\ndoes it work does it not work it's\nalways a what are you willing to give up\nuh versus get the practicalities of\nsupersetting are staggering push-pull\npush-pull uh in my mind are real because\nyou have to take over large segments of\nthe gym which oftentimes leads to a\nsituation where your rest times are too\nlong or highly variable because people\nare working in or you can't finish your\nset because now someone jumped into the\nmachine right it totally screws right\nyou lose three to five of your friends\nbecause it's obnoxious when you're\ntaking over all the equipment but in all\nseriousness I think\num it's wonderful if you have the space\nand the format to do it but at least in\nmy experience end observation these\npeople know who they are it's not\npractical to do on a regular basis if\nyou train in an open commercial gym yeah\ntough to pull up so\num\nwe've covered toys\norder volume and intensity to a\nsufficient level the last one is\nfrequency and we've already sort of\nindirectly talked about that where\nfrequency can be as high as you'd like\nin this area it really depends on your\nrecovery if you're really truly pushing\nmaximum strength you probably do need a\nfew days to recover although that's\ndependent upon you but speed and power\ncan be done multiple times a day almost\nevery day basically the one exception\nwould be maximum sprinting speed you\nneed to be careful there for things like\nhamstring and injury especially if\nyou're pretty fast so you want to be a\nlittle bit cautious of that but if\nyou're doing easier movements like\nmedicine ball throws or kettlebell\nswings or something you could do those\nquite often as long as the volume is is\nstaying pretty low\nlast little piece here is progression\nhow do I progress over time\nso I mentioned this earlier but just\nwant to fill this Gap right back in\nbefore we head over to hypertree which\nis three to five percent increase per\nweek of intensity in general and you can\ndo upwards of about five percent\nincrease in volume per week over time\nand I generally recommend running that\nfor at longest eight weeks\nbut probably most realistically you want\nto go about five weeks or so and then\nhave some sort of a deload or back off\nweek if you do that you're you're\ngenerally going to be a pretty good spot\nforeign\n[Music]"
