    "transcript": "is there a general rule of thumb for how\nto breathe during repetitions during\nwork yep for strength maybe even\nstrength versus hypertrophy in in a way\nthat maximizes oxygen input to the\nsystem you know keeps you uh alert and\nconscious\nbut that also protects the body by\ncreating some rigidity in the system\nright because certainly being def with\nall your exhale the body is a very\ndifferent beast in terms of stability\nthan with the body full of air versus\nyou know breathing during the repetition\nmovement there's a maneuver that is long\nbeen uh labeled the valsalva techniques\nso what that really means is you're\ntrying to use air to create\nintra-abdominal pressure and what you're\nreally trying to do is create a cylinder\naround your spine the real issue you\nhave to play here is regulation of blood\npressure and spinal stability now you\nshould be able to breathe in brace what\nI mean by that is you should be able to\ncreate total intra-abdominal pressure\nregulate spine control while breathing\nit's just very hard for a lot of people\nto do it's a skill you should absolutely\nwork on you can actually you can do this\nand you can go around like I do this\ntrick in class and students can come and\nthey can push any part of my entire\nabdomen is super tight and I can talk\nnow it's going to be a little bit labor\nyou can hear a little bit of a\ndifference but you should be able to do\nthat if you have to like hunch down and\nyou can't even muster a breath and it\ntakes that to create pressure you're not\nactually you don't really understand the\nabdominal control necessary to create\nthat stability so step number one is\nthat's the goal now with the blood\npressure thing we have to be careful\nbecause a standard blood pressure\nideally if we sat around right now\nit was probably something like 120 over\n80. systolic versus diastolic that's a\nnormal number right high blood pressure\nis something over that well\nwith an acute bout of exercise you can\nsee that number reach as high as like\n450 over 350. which effectively means\nyou have total blood occlusion right\nyour blood pressure is so high blood is\nnot moving anywhere and it's in the\nmiddle of a very heavy set especially\ncomplex movements especially when\nthey're loaded on your body this could\nbe an overhead press or squat variations\nanything like that blood pressure is\ngoing to be a problem and the reason why\nthat matters is that's what's going to\nmake you pass out it's not the fact that\nyou ran out of oxygen in three seconds\nit's the fact that blood pressure got so\nhigh you blacked out and so we want to\nhave we're gonna have to play this game\nof releasing a little bit of the\npressure so we can actually get blood to\nmove a little bit making sure that\nwe don't lose spinal stability so we can\nfinish our workout that's really the\nquestion you asked right how do I play\nthis game of oh I have several hundred\npounds on my back or my chest and I\ndon't want to Exhale\nright so I don't lose spinal stability\nbut at the same time I don't want to\npass out right which is which is a\nproblem so a kind of a couple of rules\nof thumb if you're going to be doing\nsomething in which you can complete the\nentire exercise without a breath\nand it is of a maximal or close to load\nthat's probably your best strategy so in\nthat particular case you'll see a lot of\nbreathing techniques where you're going\nto take a very large inhale\nideally this is done through the abdomen\nnot the shoulders so we shouldn't seeing\nclavicles Rising during this thing\nyou'll see a common mistake of of the\nbars on their back and you see people do\nthis like big inhale thing and all they\ndo is Elevate their collabos that's not\nnecessarily going to increase pressure\nthrough the abdomens which is what\nyou're looking for so you want to be\nthinking about belly moving out in all\nfour areas in front of you to your left\nand right and to your back that's that\nquadrant sort of idea of stabilizing\nyour spine you can do that independent\nof your clavicle is moving like your\nshoulders don't need to rise for that\nyou don't really need the oxygen for\nmetabolic purposes you're just using the\nair for a brace that's really all you're\nafter so you're trying to visualize your\ntorso as more or less a cylinder yep and\nyou're trying to fill it with air\nthe logic being that if I were to push\ndown onto a say a full unopened can of\nsoda yep water\nfor all you sugar phobes out there soda\nwater\nuh\nand then\npush as hard as I could it's going to be\nhard for me to crush that can but if the\ncan were empty or if it were a little\nbit kinked in the middle correct then I\ncould likely Crush that can yeah what\nyou're really doing is you have your\nspinal rectors in the back right and\nthen a whole series of abdominal\nexercises and you actually have some\nneural control systematic control of\nContracting those but you don't have\nmuscles on the inside\nthat you can do so you're basically\nbringing in air and saying I'll use air\nto push from the inside out and I'll use\nmuscles to push from the outside in to\ncreate this brace and I don't want over\ncompression with the muscles this is a\nlike if you if you see people that have\njust enormous spinal rectors\nsometimes that's an indicator of\nactually a poor breathing or bracing\nstrategy because they're using spinal\nrectors to create all their compression\nand not actually using the inside enough\nthat's not always the case but sort of\nlike a thing to think about so over\ncompression through the spinal rectus is\nnot necessarily ideal if you wanted the\nbest scenario is a little bit of a brace\nof both so we use some air to push this\nside we use some musculature to press\nthat way and then that that spine is\njust nicely held in position again not\nin a position where I've locked down my\ndiaphragm and I can't get any air out I\nshould be able to get that brace pattern\num and then be able to speak in fact\nlike I'm doing it right now and you'll\nsee like a little bit of if you're\nreally paying attention to my voice you\ncan hear a little bit of a subtle\ndifference but I should be able to do\nthis for quite a long time\nright like I I could take a maximum rep\nright here in this position whether I'm\noverhead pressing doing some sort of row\nlike anything and feel very braced in in\nthe entire quadrant\nthis is very helpful I I'm going to work\non it but can we say that a an effective\nway to start off in terms of breathing\nduring repetitions would be to take a\ngulp of air during the lowering phase\nThe Eccentric phase and then to Exhale\nduring the yeah concentric exertion\nphase I asked that because that's what\nI've been doing for a while and it makes\nme feel safe I don't know if I am and it\nallows me to Exhale as I exert the the\nhardest portion of the exercise\nand perhaps I also borrowed that from\nmartial arts where one tense most often\nis trained to Exhale on the on the\nstrike yep if you're going to be doing\nagain the number of repetitions can be\ncompleted without a breath\na lot of times you're better off saving\nthat exhalation until you complete\nwow but you don't have to but for a\nreasonably heavy set of hack squats or\neven leg extensions and given that I\nalready can't leg extension my body\nweight maybe it's established oh maybe\nthis is why\num the idea of holding my breath for an\nentire compound set so again I'm going\nto mine\num you know like where is my insurance\ncard who's going to drive me to the\nhospital this kind of thing\num in all seriousness what if I want to\nbreathe during the set yeah so\nI I'll clarify I'm generally meaning if\nyou're doing like a one rep max\nor something like that okay well they\ncertainly could hold my breath for a one\nrepetition maximum that you know maybe\nlike a double or something like that\ndepending on what you're doing like\nmaybe a triple a bench press you can\nprobably do three\nand get away with it a squat it gets\nharder deadlift so it kind of depends on\nthe exercise\num you want to take that breath though\nprior to The Eccentric portion\nnot during so lower breathe in lock or\nset and now start our movement pattern\nwherever it's going to be exhaling on\nthe concentric portion during it is fine\nit is no problem\num especially if you're not extremely\nheavy and what's your what are your\nthoughts on grunting and screaming yeah\nfine I don't care I don't tend to do\nthat I'm occasionally known to squeal or\nwhimper\nI think of you and I think squeal\nwhimper absolutely thanks\num if you're going to be doing multiple\nrepetitions\nuh what we actually do for the NFL\ncombine\nis we teach them a very specific Excel\nstrategy so there's one test that they\ndo uh which is they bench press 225\npounds for as many reps as possible a\nlot of these people will get 25 to 40\nrepetitions so we have a very specific\nbreathing pattern it would be something\nlike if we think that they're going to\ndo around 25 reps say that's like our\ngoal we might say okay do the first 10\nwithout a breath and then exhale reset\nand then do five breath and then you\nmight do five breath three breath two\nbreath and then one breath per rep until\nwe can't get any more um so we'll have\nvery specific strategies for them\num so what I would say is think about\nhow many you're going to complete and\nand then breathe according to that and\nit tends to increase in frequency as the\nnumber gets closer to failure because\nyou're going to want that that error a\nlittle bit but you just want to make\nsure that\nwhen you re when you're breathing back\nin you're in a safe spot so you don't\nwant to be catching that like re-breath\nwhen the weight's on you you want to be\nin a locked out position or away from\nyou when you're standing so it tends to\nbe like at the end of the exercise not\nin the middle of it which is is going to\nbe a recipe for problems if you take\nyour breath then\nforeign\n[Music]"
