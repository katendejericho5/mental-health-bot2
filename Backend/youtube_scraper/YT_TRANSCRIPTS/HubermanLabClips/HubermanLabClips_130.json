    "transcript": "Everybody experiences\nhiccups from time to time.\nI think most people would agree\nthat one hiccup is sort of funny,\ntwo hiccups in a row is really funny\nand three hiccups in a row\nis where it starts to be concerning,\nin part because hiccups\ncan be kind of painful.\nThere is a technique that can\nreliably eliminate hiccups\nand it's a technique that takes advantage\nof hypercontracting the phrenic nerve\nover a short period of time\nso that it then subsequently relaxes\nor alleviates the spasming\nof the phrenic nerve.\nAnd that simple method is to\ninhale three times in a row.\nThis is a very unusual\npattern of breathing\nbut what it involves is\ntaking a big deep inhale\nthrough your nose,\nthen before you exhale any air,\ntake a second inhale through the nose,\nhowever brief that inhale might be,\nand then a third even\nmicro or millisecond long\ninhale through your nose\nto get that third inhale\nand then hold your breath\nfor about 15 to 20 seconds\nand then slowly exhale."
