    "transcript": "when we win we feel like we can keep\ngoing right you look at the team that\nwins and it's like they'll play another\ngame the Super Bowl winners or you\nimagine they're jumping up and down and\nthey could probably play another Super\nBowl\nlosing we know can sure can drop things\nlike testosterone and dopamine for some\nperiod of time but when you were in the\nteams\nwhat was your observation about how\nwinning and losing would impact people\nin the short and long term in other\nwords Would You observe people that had\na quick reset button and could you say\nthat was terrible\nand then transmute I guess I'm getting\ninto kind of the the Eastern language\nnow convert that into\nenergy to go do better the next time\nwhereas we also see people military and\nin the civilian world that a loss in\nparticular severe losses basically set\nthem down the path of like less energy\nit certainly isn't less calories in fact\nmost of the time it's the other way they\nstart consuming more calories and that\ndoesn't get them going so again this\nnotion of energy and now I'm asking wins\nversus losses what did You observe and\nfrom the perspective of leadership and\nmaybe more importantly from the\nperspective of yourself\nhow do you work with that how do you\ncalibrate wins and losses how do you\ntransmute losses into energy because\nwinds we know convert to energy but\nlosses oftentimes can sap our energy way\nway down\nI think\nto start with I think that the selection\nprocess to get into the SEAL Teams\nis going to weed out a bunch of people\nthat can't recover very quickly from\nsomething bad so you probably heard\nthese type of stories before the kid\nthat was the star of the football team\nthe star of the basketball team the\ncaptain of this the captain of that he's\nbeen winning his whole life he goes to\nBuds and he quits\nbecause in buds you're you're you're not\ngonna win you're certainly not going to\nwin everything they're going to find\nwhat you're not good at and they're\ngonna exploit that and you're gonna lose\nthis what happens so a lot of guys that\nmay lose and it disrupts their their\nmotivation\nthey're probably just gonna quit\nand so that's why you get this massive\nattrition rate with guys that are stunts\nI mean we're talking\nuh division one athletes division one\nathlete division one wrestlers division\none football players division one\nRunners and swimmers they all come to\nbuds they all quit not all of them quit\nbut there's plenty of examples of the\nhighest level of Collegiate athlete in\nsports that translate very well to what\nyou're doing in in basic SEAL training\nand they quit and sometimes it's because\nthey don't know how to lose they don't\nknow how to recover from a loss and\nthey're they're just so so I think\nalready and once you get to a Seal Team\nyou've got people that are generally\nspeaking going to be pretty resilient\nwhen it comes to\ndealing with a loss not only that I mean\nyou just get used you talk about losing\npeople you're friends with this guy you\nmeet this guy in Seal training hey this\nguy seems like a stud oh he's just gonna\nquit and and you're gonna lose five six\nseven people eight people people quit so\nfast you don't even keep track of them\nso you're just gonna lose you're just\ngonna get used to it\nso there's that now once you're in the\nteams\nand what you're talking about is now you\nstart taking much more significant loss\nyou're not losing a race you're losing\none of your friends and this is what\nfrom a leadership perspective you have\nto you have to pay attention to so when\nyou're a leader in any organization\nyou're basically in charge of a mob when\nit comes to what their morale is they're\nthey're a mob and they feed off of each\nother just like a mob riding in the\nstreets going oh we can break this\nwindow let's break all the windows and\nthey they move this mob mentality and\nthat happens with morale inside of a\nteam\nand you as a leader can't get caught up\nwith the mob you can't let that happen\nyou have to detach yourself from the mob\nmentally so that you don't get caught up\nin their emotions and their morale\nbecause if you get caught up in their\nemotions and you get caught up in their\nmorale you can't correct it so we go out\non a mission the mission goes great we\nget into a gun flight kill a couple bad\nguys everyone's okay high fives\neveryone's feeling great you come back\nto base hey we don't need to debrief\nthat was perfect hey we don't need to\nget our gear you know uh maintained we\ncan just go to bed we we're awesome\nthat's when the leader has to say oh\nwe've got the mob and the mob is\nbecoming slightly arrogant hey guys real\nquick that was a good op but there's\nsome things we could improve on you got\nto bring that mob back and bring them\nback to Centerline same thing in the\nother direction you go out on operation\nit doesn't go well you go out in\noperation you take casualties now you\ncome back to base you see guys moping\naround you see the the spirit starting\nto break and same thing if you if you're\npart of that mob\nyou'll be you'll be with them your\nmorale will be breaking your spirit will\nbe breaking you gotta look and say oh I\nsee what's happening hey guys listen up\nthat was tough didn't go the way we\nwanted it to go we need to learn some\nlessons here's some things I can do\nbetter what can we do better to make\nsure that that never happens again\nwhat can we do to make sure we have the\nopportunity to go out and avenge our\nbrother on the battlefield what can we\ndo to move this thing forward so as a\nleader when it comes to winning and\nlosing you're generally going to be the\nperson countering what the mob mentality\nis because when the mob starts winning\nthey want to keep winning and they might\nget arrogant when the mob is losing\nthey might start to lose more because\ntheir attitude goes down the drain so\nthat's what you have to pay attention to\nfrom a leadership perspective four\nfor me personally\nI think\noh I know what I did when when I lost\nguys\nwas focused on all right\nwe need to we need to\ncelebrate the life we need to move the\nlaw mourn the loss\nand then we need to go to work we need\nto get our gear back on we need to Lock\nand Load our weapons we need to get back\nout there\nI know that that's what we need to do\nyou know so often\nthe best way to contend with with\nproblems with issues with adversity\nis action is by taking action\nthe more you sit and the more you wait\nand the more time you spend with that\nadversity with the upper hand inside\nyour head\nthe worse it's going to get\nso for me always taking action making\nsomething happen it doesn't have to be\nhuge it doesn't have to be some Mammoth\nyou know um\nTriumph that you're going to go and go\nand pursue but if you say Hey listen\nthis what happened didn't go the way we\nwanted it to we're gonna get our gear\nback on we're gonna go back out we're\ngonna we're gonna do this other mission\nand that's that's what I think I think\ntaking action and it's in your personal\nlife too you know something doesn't go\nthe way you wanted it to go you didn't\nget the job you wanted you didn't get\nthe higher you didn't get the promotion\nyou can go home and sit there and and\nand dwell on it that's not getting you\nany progress or you say okay you know\nwhat let me do a quick analysis why\ndidn't I get that promotion oh it's\nbecause I didn't get this qualification\nor I hadn't jumped through this gate\nokay cool what do I need let me look\ninto how do I get to jump through that\ngate so next time I will get the\npromotion you start taking action so\naction for me is a cure for a lot of\nproblems that we have in life\nforeign\n[Music]"
