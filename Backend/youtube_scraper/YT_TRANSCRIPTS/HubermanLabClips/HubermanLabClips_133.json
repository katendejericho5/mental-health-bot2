    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm almost\nhesitant to ask this question,\nbut I'm going to do it anyway.\nMany times online, you\nare asked whether or not\nyou will run for office?\nAnd I want to say that I\nthink it's a true compliment.\nI don't think people are asking\njust to entertain themselves.\nI think that this\ncountry certainly\nand a lot of the world is\ndesperate for certain kinds\nof leaders and people\nthat have experience\nin high risk, high consequence,\nchaotic situations,\nand have shown prowess at\nleadership in multiple domains.\nAnd you are certainly\none of those individuals.\nAnd so they ask for that\nreason among others.\nAnd I've heard you\ngive your answer,\nand you can repeat\nit again here.\nBut as a more broad theme that I\nthink people are interested in,\ndo you think it's an\nimportant criteria\nor it would be\ngreat to see people\nin positions of leadership\nwho've had wartime experience?\nAnd do you think that some\nof the shifts that we've\nseen in terms of\npatterns of leadership\nover the last-- let's\njust make it real broad\nso that this isn't related\nto any particular person\nor stretch of history--\nbut over the last,\nlet's just say 25\nyears, reflect the fact\nthat we haven't\nseen a lot of that,\nat least at the top\ntiers of leadership?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I think\nit'd be excellent if people--\nif the president had\nmilitary experience for sure.\nI think that then they\nunderstand the way\nthe military works better.\nThey understand that each--\nthe civilians that control\nthe military.\nBecause a lot of times\npeople that are civilians\ndon't understand that the\ncivilians control the military.\nAnd I think that you do get to\nappreciate what war actually is\nand what the costs are.\nI think that I've seen in\nthe same vein of people\nasking me to run for\npolitical office,\nI've heard, seen\ncomments saying,\noh, that's what we need, another\nwar-- a warmonger in office.\nAnd I've responded\na few of those.\nI think if there's any group\nof people that don't want war,\nit's people that have seen it.\nPeople that understand\nwhat the sacrifices are.\nAnd I think that\nbeing in the military,\npeople understand that better.\nSo yeah, I think it'd be\na great qualification.\nI don't think it's mandatory.\nI mean, clearly it's not.\nWe've had a bunch of\npresidents that haven't ever\nserved anything.\nReally, we've had a bunch of\npresidents that haven't ever\nserved anything but themselves.\nSo yeah, hopefully, we'll\nget some more people that\nhave some experience\nin the military,\nsome combat experience\nwould be especially nice.\nAnd that would be\ngood in my opinion.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well\nI'm certainly not one\nto tell people what to do,\nand I'm certainly not going\nto tell you what to do.\nBut should you\never choose to run,\nI would certainly be very\nenthusiastic about that.\nAnd I will just say\nthat with that stated,\nI hope people do hear\nwhat you just said.\nI share that sentiment.\nPeople who have led others\nbesides themselves, I think\nis the key statement there.\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.\nAnd look, I just--\nI have friends that\nare politicians,\nand I really appreciate\nwhat they're doing.\nAnd it looks miserable to me.\nI don't like what--\ngood for them.\nI'm happy that they're in there\ntrying to make a difference.\nAnd I guess, this is me being\nselfish of me saying, look,\nI don't think I\ncould stomach that.\nAnd I also think that right\nnow, I'm trying to help out.\nFor instance, we have\nobviously got the leadership\nconsulting in\nEchelon Front, we're\ntrying to help businesses grow.\nI've got Origin\nUSA, we're bringing\nmanufacturing back to America.\nWe've got 100, 400,\n450 employees right\nnow that are here in\nAmerica working and growing\nthat business.\nObviously, that\nsupplements-- so everything\nthat I'm doing here right\nnow is to try and move\nthe needle with America.\nBringing manufacturing back,\nhelping the economy as much\nas I can right now.\nSo that's what I'm\ndoing right now.\nAnd my standard answer,\nwhich you alluded to,\nis if things got\nbad enough, then\nI would do what I had to do.\nBut I don't think people\nappreciate my level of bad.\nI'm talking real bad.\nSo it's not there yet.\nAnd hopefully, it\nnever will get there.\nI'd rather surf and\nhang out with my friends\nand hang out with my\nfamily than do that.\nAnd hopefully, America can\nfind some level of balance.\nI think that's the problem\nthat we're having right now.\nAnd a lot of these things\nthat you talked about,\nspecifically the thing\nyou talked about,\nsocial media is not very\ngood for political balance.\nIt's actually horrible\nfor political balance,\nand a lot of it has to\ndo with just the way\nthat those\nconversations are had.\nA lot of it has to do with ego\nas well because I don't ever\nwant to admit that I'm\nwrong about anything.\nAnd if I can find\nsomething that I\nthink you might be\nwrong about, it's\nso satisfying to my ego to\njust call you out on that thing\nand attack you.\nAnd I think that's what a lot\nof people are doing right now.\nNow, that being said, I also\nusually say this as well.\nI travel around the\ncountry all the time.\nI work with companies\nof all sizes, work\nwith people in every\ndifferent industry.\nAnd they're not sitting\naround arguing with each other\nabout the political scenery.\nThey're talking about, hey,\nhow can we grow our business?\nHow can we take\ncare of our workers?\nHow can we take\ncare of our clients?\nHow can we take care\nof our customer?\nThat's what people\nare focused on.\nAnd when you jump\non social media,\nyou can get sucked into the\npolitical scene very easily.\nAnd that being said,\nalso we do have\nto pay attention\nbecause we as citizens\nhave to make sure\nthat America stays\non the correct path within\nthe guardrails of what\nthis country is based on.\nSo we do have to pay attention.\nBut I will be doing\nmy part as a civilian\nuntil there's total mayhem\nand chaos in the streets.\nThen I'll probably just\nbe a benevolent dictator\nthat takes over.\n[LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nShould be an interesting one,\nbut, hey, you would be the man\nto lead under any conditions.\nBut thank you for\nstating your threshold.\nCertainly, you've\nearned the right\nto make whatever decision is\nthat you feel is right for you.\nAnd I want to say that I agree.\nI feel like we are a\ncountry that still includes\na ton of generators\nand a ton of projectors\nthat are interested\nin projecting the good\nand growing the good.\nI do believe both those\nphenotypes are important.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
