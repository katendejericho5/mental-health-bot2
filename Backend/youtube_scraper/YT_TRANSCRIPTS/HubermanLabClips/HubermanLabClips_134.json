    "transcript": "in yourself and in your observation of\npeople that you've worked with\ndid you ever sense that just being hard\ndriving was kind of\nit was great but it was limiting like\ndid you ever sense that like by liking\nthe people you work with you could\nperform much better\num even if they perhaps were not as hard\nto kind of borrow the the common\nparlance around this they weren't as\nhard as everybody else that because you\nlike each other so so much that you can\nkind of do anything well if you have a\nteam of\n10 people and you all have a great\nrelationship and you get along well and\nyou're going against my team and we all\nhate each other and we're who's going to\nwin the team that loves each other is\ngoing to win I would hope it's not even\nclose it's not a matter of fact if you\nwork for me and you don't like me what\nkind of performance are you going to\ngive me it's going to be tough what if\nyou love me and I've looked out for you\nand I've done everything for you and\nI've taken care of you what kind of\nperformance are you going to give me\nyeah everything oh I Gotta Die for you\nso yeah and you know earlier you you\nasked about\num the human animal and human nature and\nthis is part of leadership I got asked\nthis question the other day by uh I was\nworking with a company and the guy says\nyou know how do I identify what are the\ncharacteristics of someone that can\nexecute and how do I identify those\ncharacteristics in a person\nso that I can get those people\nand I said well\nfirst of all\nthe characteristics are the\ncharacteristics that everybody's you\nknow obviously someone that's driven\nsomeone that communicate well someone\nthat's going to make things happen those\nare pretty simple to I to know we know\nwhat they are how do you identify them\nit's pretty simple as well\nI give you a task I give Andrew a task\nit's a pretty simple task if you get it\ndone cool give you a little bit more\ncomplex task\ndo you get it done yes I give give the\nsame task to Fred he doesn't get it done\nhe comes back with a bunch of questions\nhe slow rolls he's got all kinds of\nexcuses and problems I give you an even\nmore complex task you come back you get\nit done\nand then I'm gonna realize okay Andrew's\nthe guy that makes things happen he's a\nguy that can actually execute\nany a little bit what you said I mean\nthere's certain breeds of dogs but even\nthat is it they're not as as as\ndifferent as\nhuman beings are right like there and\nthere are some so so now there are some\nguys I've got Andrew who will make\nthings happen\nhere's the problem with Andrew when I\nsay hey Andrew\nhere's this nebulous idea that I have\ncan you turn this into a reality and\nyou're like where do I start I'm not\nsure where you want me to go meanwhile I\ngave it to the guy that didn't make\nanything happen with specific tasks that\nI can says you know I say hey I got this\nnebulous idea can you see what you he\ngoes oh yeah and all of a sudden he\ntakes it and he says Hey figure out a\nway to make this happen so you might\nhave someone that's very good at\nexecuting but they're not very creative\nI might have somebody that's very\ncreative but they're not very good at\nexecuting so what do I do I build a team\nwhere I've got Andrew and Fred and they\nwork together and Fred comes up with\ngood ideas and we bring them to Andrew\nand Andrew goes and executes them so\nthat's what we're doing from a\nleadership perspective is we're letting\npeople's nature\nexecute and we're putting people into\nroles where their nature is beneficial\nI'm not going to take someone that's shy\nand introverted and put him out in the\nlead sales role I'm not going to take\nsomebody that's boisterous and\nextroverted and put them into a cubicle\nwhere they're going to be looking at\nspreadsheets all day clearly I'm not\ngoing to do that so what we have to do\nas Leaders is we have to find the right\npeople for the right role and we place\nthem into those roles now does it mean\nthat I abandon all hope that the guy\nthat's an introvert will ever develop\nmore communication skills no I'm still\ngoing to work with them and over time\nwe'll get him a little bit moving in the\nright direction but I'm not going to\ntake somebody that's a a a a a a total\nintrovert and turn them into a lead\nsales guy that's not going to happen any\nmore than I'm going to change the tiger\nstripes so that's what we have to do is\nwe have to\nhelp people as Leaders we have to help\npeople find the role and find the thing\nthat they're good at now\ndoes that mean if I have someone that\nloves their job they're going to do\nbetter at it absolutely does it mean\nthat if I have somebody that's driven\njust by achievement that they're going\nto be good at their job no in fact well\nthey can be there's going to be certain\nroles I can put them in right if I've\ngot a sales number I need to hit and and\nAndrew's super into achievement he wants\nto be the golden child who wants to have\nhis picture on the on the you know\nmagazine that we put out about our\nindustry cool I can throw this task at\nyou and you're gonna go and get it the\nproblem is\nif there's something that's going to\ntake more perseverance\nand the reward isn't that high or it's a\nlong-term goal you're probably not the\nright guy for the job\nso\nliking your job is absolutely critical\nand if you love your job you're going to\nbe able to you're going to be able to\nmost likely excel at it now you could be\nan unfortunate person that loves your\njob and is not good at it that happens\noccasionally right yeah it seems to be\npretty rare it reminds me of your\nskateboarding career yeah I love\nskateboarding but you just weren't that\ngood at it you know what I loved more\nthan skateboarding I love the community\nI love the community I was in and I Pro\nand you know I probably would have gone\nto the industry side or worked on a\ncompany side and not been in this actual\nskateboard side or just skateboard for\nfun so there's a guy in the skateboard\nCommunity his name is Jim thibo and he's\nkind of the uh not so hidden secret in\nthat Community he's an amazing guy and\nhe's sort of uh early on left\nprofessional skateboarding to run a\ncompany real Deluxe a bunch of other\ncompanies he's an amazing guy and he\ntold me the we become friends recently\nand he said he realized he wasn't going\nto be one of the big guys but he knew he\nwanted to be in this community so he\nfound his place and I think everyone in\nskateboarding looks to Jim as like the\nguy who care he's you know he cares\nabout he truly cares about the sport and\nabout the people and so he learned to\nkind of just wrap his arms and his heart\naround the whole thing and it just works\nand so I do think\num everyone has a certain place uh in a\ncommunity or in a team I think that as\nyou're describing this I have to imagine\nthat people are listening and thinking\nlike wow this team thing is awesome like\nit's just amazing I wish I had that\nright I'm fortunate to have that in my\npodcast I've had that in my lab\ncertainly in the my podcast team I would\nI I always say these guys go I go\nlike like it's not just it's the people\nthat press buttons and run equipment\ntake photos like they go I go like they\ngo it's over and I'm fine with that I\nactually love that because it's it's yes\nit's about the podcast but and about the\ninformation and getting it out there but\nit's as much about the team and working\ntogether just like it was with\nskateboarding\n[Music]"
