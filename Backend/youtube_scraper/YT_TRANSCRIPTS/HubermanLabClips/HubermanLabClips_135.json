    "transcript": "If you can contract a muscle very hard\nto the point where it almost\nfeels like it's cramping\nif you can do that, even\nwhen there's no weight\nin your hand or there's\nno resistance against it\nso you're just using your mind\nmuscle connection to contract\nthat muscle hard and isolate it,\nchances are you'll be able\nto generate hypertrophy\nand strength gains pretty\neasily in that muscle compared\nto muscles that you have\na harder time activating."
