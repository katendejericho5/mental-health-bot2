    "transcript": "As much as I love mainstream medicine,\nand I trained in it,\nand I'm so grateful for my education,\nI still think it is a silo-based\nway of taking care of patients.\nSo even if there's an understanding\nof the network effect\nmore at the science level,\nor as you described in neuroscience,\nthere's still, you know,\nif you are a woman who\nhas constipation, fatigue,\nmaybe an autoimmune condition,\nfeel stressed out all the time,\nfeel like your hormones are out of whack,\nyou get sent to the gastroenterologist\nfor the constipation.\nYou get sent to the rheumatologist\nfor your autoimmune issues.\nYou maybe get sent to an endocrinologist\nif you've got thyroid problems.\nAnd there's very little\ncollaboration between these groups.\nSo even though there's an understanding\nof the network effect, in\nreal life, it's not happening."
