    "transcript": "do you have a process for you know\nremoving\nthe functions of the day and what you\nwere doing last week and what's going on\nand um in order to get more access to\nthe this um I'm going to think of it now\nmore as as a receiver inside of you\nright almost like tuning a radio\nand then it comes in like the beginning\nof like a Strummer Clash right you love\nthe radio Joe love the radio right and\nthen it comes in clear and there it is\nhow do you clear the static\nwhat what are some of the operational\nsteps that you think might be more\num generalizable to regardless of where\nsome somebody in you know\num Africa is listening I would say when\nI'm when I engage in a particular\nproject whatever it is I I dedicate\nall of myself\nfor that period of time whatever it is\nwhether it be\n20 minutes or whether it be five hours\nwhatever it is\num\nTotal Focus\nand no\num outside distraction whatsoever\nand when I leave that process I do my\nbest not to think about it when I'm away\nfrom it I don't bring any materials with\nme I don't leave the studio with Works\nin progress and spend time listening to\nthem during the day or looking for ideas\nI I stay as far away from it when I'm\nnot directly engaging in it as possible\nand in the best of situations I have\nsomething else to totally engage myself\nin in between so instead of working on\nProject a for five hours and then\nleaving and doing nothing\nI'm hoping to engage in a project b or b\nc and d with all of myself before going\nback to project a again which might be\nthe next day let's say this um relates\nto an amazing uh chapter and series of\nwritings of your book that I'm not going\nto describe because I want people to\nfind it for themselves about disengaging\nabout disengaging from the process one\nquestion I had as I read that chapter\nand as you're saying this now is\neven though you're disengaged do you\nbelieve that your subconscious is\nworking it through that I believe so I\nbelieve so and I think in general\nto Stew over problem is not the way to\nsolve a problem\nthink to hold\nthe problems lightly and and if and when\nI say a problem you know and where when\nwe're starting a project there's usually\nthis feeling of um\nthere's a question mark at the beginning\nof every project I I I'm always anxious\nwhen I start a new project\nbecause I have no idea what's going to\nhappen I never know I never I never I\nmay have in some cases\npotential backup plan if you know if\nnothing works\nbut I really try not even have that it's\nI prefer not to have that I prefer to go\nin maybe to calm myself down enough to\nbe able to show up there'll be an idea\nof like nothing works\nmaybe we could try something like this\nbut that would only be for my own\nanxiety that would it wouldn't be for\nactual practical use\num but there's always a sense of anxiety\nbecause I know\nwhatever's going to happen is completely\nout of my control\nSomething's Gonna something either\ninteresting or not will appear\nand then we're going to follow that\nwherever it goes\nand\nuntil\nsomething appears for us to follow\nI have a lot of anxiety\neven though I know even though it has\nnever not come you know it has come\nevery time but there's something about\nit because I also feel like there might\nbe expectation on me that I'm going to\nmake it happen and I know that's not\nhappening that's not how it works it's\nit's\num\nI show up ready for it to happen\nand\nam open to whatever we have to do to\nfind that first thread\nand once we find the thread then it's\nlike okay we have a and that thread may\nlead us to anything you know could lead\nus to in a million different directions\nbut something about having that glimmer\nthat it's not a black we're not looking\nat a blank page you know we're looking\nat okay we have a\nwe have uh the beginnings of\num I would say a map but it's a map that\nwe don't know where it takes us and it's\njust the beginning it's just like it's\njust a start you know\nyou are here\nif you have a map and it says you are\nhere even if you can't see the\ndirections\nknowing where we are feels okay\num\nand once we get and usually again\nusually in the first day first couple of\ndays it happens\num\nbut up until then it's it's really an\nanxiety producing\nuh situation\n[Music]"
