    "transcript": "I mean there's some fundamental there's\nthere's some false assumptions about\nthe underlying logic of this process\nwhich I think it's worth addressing and\nthere's actually there's a kind of found\nobject in the news that I I talk about\nat one point I forget where it is in in\nthe waking up app but there's a story\nthat I stumbled on on the internet\num I think it's about 12 or 13 years old\nof a um a tourist bus in I think was\nNorway it was somewhere in\nnorthern Europe\nand I had about 30 people on it and one\nperson was it was described as an Asian\nwoman uh and they all they went to a\nrest stop and everyone got off the bus\nuh and they you know shopped and had\nlunch and and this Asian woman changed\nher clothing uh for whatever reason and\nthey all got back on the bus\num I think the relevance of it being an\nAsian woman is you know there were\nlanguage barriers that that explained\nwhat later happened\num so everyone gets back on the bus the\nAsian woman has changed her her clothing\nand the bus is about to leave but then\nsomeone notices hey there's a there was\nan Asian woman who got off the bus who\nisn't it hasn't come back yet and they\ntell the driver this\num and this poses a problem so now\neveryone's waiting for this person to\nreturn but in fact everyone was on the\nbus that this woman had just changed her\nclothing and was not recognized by her\nfellow Travelers\nso everyone gets concerned as this\ntourist doesn't you know show up and\nthey start looking for her right and\nthey can't find her and so a search\nparty is formed and the Asian woman\nbecause of the whatever language barrier\num\nthought heard that there was a missing\ntourist so she joins the search party\nwhich in fact is looking for her right\nand this goes on into the night and\nthey're ready in helicopters that you\nknow for a dawn patrol to find the\nmissing tourist\num now at some point along the way I\nthink it was at like three in the\nmorning\nthis tourist realizes that she is the\nobject of this search right and\nobviously the whole thing unravels she\nyou know she confesses that she changed\nher clothes and you know that the\nproblem is solved but the problem is not\nsolved by the the logic that the Seeker\nis expected right so it's like it's not\ntrue to say that the missing tourist was\nfound in in the way that was expected\nright because the missing tourist was\nnever lost the missing tourist was part\nof the search party right and so when\nyou think about it from her point of\nview like what happened she's part of\nthe search party she's looking for the\nmissing tourist not knowing that she in\nfact is the missing tourist so what\nhappens at the moment she realizes\nthat everyone's looking for her right\nlike what what is it the the search\nisn't consummated\nin the way that is implied by the logic\nof everyone's use of attention\num and yet the problem evaporates and\nthere's something deeply analogous about\nthe structure of that\nand the the meditative journey in in\nprecisely in again not talking about all\nthe changes in the possible changes in\nthe contents of Consciousness that could\nbe good which again cut they come along\nfor the ride anyway when you when you\ndo the thing I'm talking about\nit's not on this point of looking for\nthe self and not finding it and\nthere is this sense that okay the self\nis here and it's a problem it is the the\nstring upon which all of my conscious\nStates mostly unhappy ones are strong\nright it's the thing that is at the\ncenter of my anxiety it's the it's it's\nthe it's the thing that I don't feel\ngood about it's a thing that one\ncriticized I sort of let implode\num it's the center of my problem and now\nI'm trying to feel better and meditation\nhas been handed to me as a as a possible\nyou know remedy for my situation and it\nand it's billed as a remedy in fact it's\nit's it's I'm hearing from this guy that\nthis is the thing that is going to cause\nme to realize that myself isn't where\nyou know or as I thought it was\num so now I'm going to look right and so\nagain you're you're the sense is I start\nout far away from the goal here I start\nout with a problem I'm now meditating on\nthe evidence of my unenlightenment right\nI can feel my problem I feel that I'm\ndistracted and distractible and I feel\nas this sort of cramp at the center of\nmy life it's me and I'm not as happy as\nI want to be I'm not as confident as I\nwant to be I'm I'm more distractible\nthan I want to be and now I'm paying\nattention to the breath right\num\nthis is what the search party feels like\nthis is what the the confused tourist\nfeels like in her own search party and\nshe's she's looking she's looking for\nthe missing person and so the the so the\nthe angle of of you know the inclination\nof all of this\nis and the logic of it is all wrong you\nknow understandably so uh given how we\nwe all get into this situation\nbut\nyou know it's useful to continually try\nto under undercut it and\num\nrecognize that the thing that's being\nlooked for\nis is actually right on the surface\nwhich is you know the there is no one\nlooking there is no place from which you\nare paying if you're paying attention to\nthe breath or to sounds or noticing the\nnext thought arise\nthis sense that you are over here doing\nthat thing\nis actually what it's like to be\nthinking and not knowing that you're\nthinking you're not there's a there's a\nthought there's an undercurrent of\nthought that's going uninspected in that\nmoment and\num so there is just a there's a\ncontinually looking for the mind looking\nfor the center of experience looking for\nthe one who is looking which again which\nis the kind of the the orienting\npractice here and there's a lot more I\nsay about this obviously\num over waking up but um\nit's it's the experiment you have to\nperform in order to get ready to\nrecognize that this whole the search\nparty you know was formed in in error\nessentially and the the problem that\nyou're trying to to solve with this\npractice does evaporate in in a similar\nway which is like\nyou don't actually get there\nin the way that you're hoping for right\nit's like like you drop out the bottom\nof this thing in an unexpected way it's\nnot um there's actually another uh kind\nof a similar um\nParable or or anecdote that I don't\nremember if it's Zen or Sufi or I'm sure\nit's been reappropriated in many\ndifferent ways but or by many different\ntraditions\nbut there's a there's you know the the\ncase of somebody who's lost in a town\nand they're asking for directions you\nknow you could put put this in in in\nManhattan you could let's say you're\nwandering Manhattan and you're you're a\ntourist you don't know where anything is\nand you stop and ask someone you know\nwhere is Central Park\nand the person thinks for a second and\nsays oh yeah unfortunately you can't get\nto Central Park from here\nright now that is a very strange I mean\nwe you think about that for a second you\nrealize okay that's a\nthat's an absurd claim there is no place\nthat you can't get to from the place\nyou're starting you know on Earth right\nthat's a failure to describe the\nphysical uh relationships between\nanything in the world yeah that's just\nnot the world we live in right so but\nit's a funny thing but on some level\nthat is true\nof meditation it's like you can't get\nthere from here like but the sense of\nyou the sense of you as subject\nisn't brought along to this thing you're\nlooking for right like you're like\nyou're\nyou know it's almost like\nit's almost like you're you're making a\nfist and you're trying to get to an open\nhand\nthe fist doesn't get to take that\nJourney as a fist right like you don't\nthe fist doesn't go along for the ride\nthe fist\ncomes apart right and and on some level\nour subjectivity is a kind of an an\nintentional fist you know it it is a\ncontraction of energy again it's it's so\nmuch bound up in thought for for\nuh most of us most of the time that is\nand again when when properly inspected\nthere's just this you know evaporation\nof the starting point but there's not\nthis there's not this fulfillment of I'm\ngoing to get this fist is going to just\ngonna if I you know\nif life gets good enough if I get\nconcentrated enough focused enough you\nknow if I austere enough if I renounce\nenough if I desire less if I you know\nyou know enough with enough good and\nintentions this fist is going to move\ninto some sort of sublime condition\nright that's not\nthe logic of the the process\n[Music]"
