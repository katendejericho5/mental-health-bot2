    "transcript": "so the illusoriness of the self doesn't\ncut against any of those obvious facts\nso the the the the sense of self that is\nillusory\num and again we might want to talk about\nself in other modes because there's\nthere's just a lot of interest there\npsychologically and you know ultimately\nscientifically\num\nthe thing that doesn't exist uh\ncertainly doesn't exist as it seems and\nI would I would want to argue that it\nactually is just a proper illusion uh\nis this the sense that there is a\nsubject interior to experience in\naddition to experience and most people\nfeel like they're having an experience\nof the world and they're having their an\nexperience of their bodies in the world\nand in addition to that they feel that\nthey are a subject internal to the body\nyou know very likely in the head most\npeople feel like they're behind their\nface as a kind of locus of awareness and\nthought and intention and and that every\nit's almost like they're you're a\npassenger inside your body you don't\nmost people don't feel identical to\ntheir bodies and they can imagine this\nthis is\nso the origin the psychological origin\nand you know the folk psychological\norigin of a sense of that there's there\nmight be a soul that could survive the\ndeath of the body I mean most people are\nare what my friend Paul Bloom calls\ncommon sense dualists right you you\nyou're used to the default\nexpectation seems to be that whatever\nthe relationship between the mind and\nthe body\nthere is this there's some promise of\nseparability there right that the and\nwhenever you you really push hard on the\nscience side and say well no the mind is\nreally just what the brain is doing that\nbegins to feel more and more\ncounterintuitive to people and there\nstill seems some some residual mystery\nthat you know at death maybe something\nis going to lift off the brain and go\nelsewhere right so there's a sense of\ndualism uh that many people have and\nobviously that that's supported by Many\nreligious beliefs\num\nbut this feeling it's a very peculiar\nstarting point the the people feel that\nin it you know they don't feel identical\nto their experience right it's a matter\nof experience they feel like they're on\nthe edge of experience\nuh somehow appropriating it from the\nside you're kind of on the edge of the\nworld and the world is out there your\nbody is is in some sense an object in\nthe world uh which you you know you it's\ndifferent from the world you know the\nthe boundary of your skin is still\nmeaningful you can sort of loosely\ncontrol your body I mean you can't\ncontrol you can control your growth you\nknow and and subtle you know voluntary\nmotor movements but uh you can't you're\nnot controlling everything your body is\ndoing you're not controlling your\nheartbeat and your you know your\num hormonal secretions and all of that\nand so there's a lot that's going on\nthat is in the dark for you\nand\nthen you you give someone an instruction\nto meditate say and you say okay let's\nexamine all of this from the first\nperson side let's look for this thing\nyou're calling I\nand again I is not identical to the body\npeople feel like their hands are out\nthere and they're good when if they're\ngoing to meditate they're going to close\ntheir eyes very likely and now they're\ngoing to pay attention to something\nthey're going to pay attention to the\nbreath or the sounds and it's from the\npoint of view of being a locus of\nattention that is now aiming attention\nstrategically at an object like the\nbreath\num that there's this dualism that is set\nup and\nultimately the ultimate promise of\nmeditation I mean they're really two\nlevels at which you could be interested\nin in meditation\num one is you know very straightforward\nand remedial and non-paradoxical and\nvery well subscribed and it's it's the\nusual set of claims about all the\nbenefits you're going to get from\nmeditation right so you're going to\nlower your stress and you're going to\nincrease your focus and you're gonna you\nknow Stave off cortical thinning and\nthere's all kinds of good things that\nscience is saying meditation will will\ngive you\num\nand none of that entails really drilling\ndown on this paradoxical claim that the\nself is an illusion or anything else of\nthat sort\nbut from my point of view\nthe real purpose of meditation and its\nreal promise is not in this long list of\nof benefits and uh you know I'm not\ndiscounting any of those though you know\nthe science for many of them is quite\nprovisional\num it's in this deeper claim that if you\nlook for this thing you're calling I if\nyou look for the sense that there's a\nthinker in addition to the the the\nmirror rising of the next thought say\nyou won't find that thing and and you\ncan what's more you cannot find it in a\nway that's conclusive uh and that\nmatters right and and it has a there's a\nhost of benefits that follow from that\nDiscovery\num which are\nuh\nquite a bit deeper and more interesting\nthan engaging meditation on the side of\nits benefits you know de-stressing\nincreasing focus and all the rest\nthank you"
