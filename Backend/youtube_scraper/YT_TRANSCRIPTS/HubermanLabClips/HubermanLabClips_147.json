    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, let's take\na step back into the real world\nand evaluate or think about what\nhappens when somebody smokes\ncannabis or ingest\ncannabis by way of edible,\nor a tincture, or\nsomething of that sort.\nCannabis is very fast to\nenter the bloodstream.\nIn fact, within 30 seconds,\nit's going to enter the brain\nand permeate throughout\nthe brain and body.\nThat's very, very fast.\nI mean if you contrast that with\nsomething like alcohol or even\nnicotine, depending on how\nthe nicotine is delivered,\nthat is a very fast\ndelivery of the psychoactive\nand biologically active\ncompound, which, in this case,\nis THC, and CBD, and probably\nsome other things as well.\nSo within 30 seconds, it reaches\nthe brain and bodily tissues.\nAnd within 30 to\n60 minutes, it's\ngoing to reach its\npeak concentrations\nand have its peak\nbiological effects.\nThose aren't always\nthe same thing,\nbut in the case of cannabis--\nand again here,\nI'm using cannabis\nas a kind of umbrella\nterm for THC and CBD--\nthe effects are going to peak\nat about 30 to 60 minutes\nafter bringing those\ncompounds into the body\nin some way or another.\nAnd the effects tend to\nlast anywhere from three\nto four hours, although\nthere's some variation on that\ndepending on\nindividual metabolism,\nwhether or not\nsomebody is familiar\nwith the compound,\nbelieve it or not,\npsychologically familiar, but\nalso biologically familiar,\nor whether or not the first\ntime use or occasional use,\nand so on.\nTHC, and CBD, and other\ncomponents of cannabis\nare highly of what\nwe call lipophilic.\nThat is they have\nan affinity toward\nand they can actually pass\nthrough fatty tissues.\nNow every cell in your body,\nbut especially neurons,\nhave a double layer of\nfat on their outside.\nAnd of course, when\npeople hear fat,\nthey always think, oh,\nfat's bad, fats whatever.\nMost of the world seems to\nwant to lose fat or bodily fat.\nHere, we're talking about the\nfatty membrane the barrier\naround each tissue.\nIn this case, we're talking\nparticularly about neurons.\nAnd THC, and CBD, and the\nother components of cannabis\nare highly lipophilic,\nso they can\nget into essentially\nall cells just simply\nby flowing into them.\nThey also remain in those\ncells for a long time.\nSo I know that a\nnumber of people,\ndepending on whether\nor not they get tested\nfor work, or for sport, or\notherwise for cannabis, or CBD\nand THC, don't take\nthis as a strict number,\nbut typically, if one\ningests CBD or THC,\nsmokes cannabis,\ningest by orally,\net cetera-- it\ndoesn't matter-- it's\ngoing to stay in\nthat fatty tissue\nand can be detected for at\nleast as long as 80 days\nafter ingestion.\nAnd there's a whole\nindustry as how\nto accelerate the clearance.\nAnd it should just tell you\nthat just losing bodily fat\nisn't going to eliminate\nit from your system,\nmaybe partially in\nthose fat cells,\nbut certainly, in visceral fat\nand other fatty tissue that's\nin and around the\nbrain and body,\nit's going to harbor that THC\nmolecule and the CBD molecule\nfor quite a long while,\nat least 80 days.\nSo if someone smokes cannabis\nor they ingest cannabis,\nvery rapidly gets\ninto the bloodstream.\nAnd the components that\nare psychoactive get\ninto the bloodstream\nare immediately\nable to access neurons\nand other cells\nand start having these\neffects of parking\nat those endogenous\ncannabinoid receptors\nand impacting the signaling\nbetween neurons, which\nleads to the subjective\neffects of cannabis, including\nTHC and CBD.\nSo let's talk about what those\ndifferent subjective effects\nare.\nAgain, this is going to vary\ndepending on whether or not\npeople are digesting sativa\nvarieties of cannabis.\nJust to remind you, those tend\nto be elevated mood, alertness,\ntalkativeness.\nPeople who take\nsativa varieties tend\nto talk a lot more than\nthey would otherwise.\nAgain, there are\nexceptions to this.\nOf course, there are exceptions.\nI'm sure there are people\nout there shouting,\nalthough, I guess, if\nyou're the quiet people who\ndon't talk too much, you're\nprobably not shouting.\nOr if you're not, you're\nnot doing it on sativa.\nJoke intended.\nBut in any event,\nthere are exceptions,\nbut there are also\ngeneral rules.\nAnd the sativas tend to\nmeet people mood elevated,\nenergetic, again, the head high.\nAnd indica varieties tend\nto do the opposite, more\nof a sedative,\nrelaxant, et cetera.\nWhy in hell would they do that?\nOK, well, without going\ninto an extensive deep dive\ninto the different\nneurotransmitter\nsystems of the\nbrain and body, what\nwe know for sure is\nthat CB1 receptors are\npresent on an enormous number\nof different neurons in brain\nstructures and neural\ncircuits so that the sativa\nvarieties that act as a\nstimulant making people feel\nhappy because in general\nthey do tend to elevate mood,\nat least at certain dosages,\ntalkative, tend to make people\nfeel like they have ideas that\nare interesting that they might\nwant to share, tend to\nnarrow their context\nso it tends to increase focus.\nThis is something that's not\noften discussed about cannabis,\nbut it can-- especially\nthe sativa varieties\ncan increase people's level\nof focus to particular things.\nSomething they're watching,\nor something they're doing,\nor music, it allows them to\nnarrow their sense of focus.\nThat's going to occur by\nactivation of CB1 receptors\nin the so-called\nprefrontal cortex, which\nis just behind the forehead.\nAnd the prefrontal cortex\nacts as a strong modulator\nof so-called limbic\ncircuitry and other circuitry\nthat is more stress oriented.\nThe way to think about the\nstress in limbic circuitry\nsuch as the amygdala, which\nmany people have heard about,\nis that they aren't really\ncircuits for fear and stress.\nThere are circuits\nthat are constantly\nevaluating one's\nown internal state,\nheart rate, et cetera, and\nwhat's happening externally.\nAnd sorry to say but the\ndefault of those systems\nis to detect danger, the\nthreat detection systems.\nAnd then the prefrontal\ncortex largely acts as a brake\non those systems like\nthe reins pulling back\non a steed of horses that\nwould otherwise just take off.\nAnd so the sativa varieties\ntend to increase CB1 activation\nin the prefrontal cortex\nand in other circuitry.\nThat then leads to\noverall reduction\nin stress because of the way\nthat prefrontal circuitry\ncan reduce activation\nof the amygdala.\nNow that, of course, does not\nexplain why some people become\nvery stressed and\nvery paranoid when\nthey smoke sativa varieties or\nother varieties of cannabis,\nor ingest other\nvarieties of cannabis.\nWe will talk about the paranoid\neffect and why that occurs\nand who might predict that would\noccur to them in a little bit.\nBut I just want to give you a\nsense of how this is working\nbecause as I mentioned before,\nTHC and/or CBD are going\nto bind that CB1 receptor.\nLet's say in prefrontal\ncortex, the neurons\nin prefrontal cortex\nis going to bind there\nand then there will be a\nretrograde signaling back\nto the presynaptic neuron.\nAnd in the case of prefrontal\ncortex, what's happening is\nit's increasing\ntransmission, increasing\nthe release of neurotransmitter\nin prefrontal cortex.\nHowever, at the same time,\nthe very same THC and CBD\nthat was brought\ninto the system is\nbinding the very same\ntype of receptors,\nCB1 receptors, in\nother brain structures,\nsuch as the amygdala.\nAnd causing retrograde\nsignaling back\nto the presynaptic\nneurons in the amygdala,\nbut it's quieting the\nactivation of those neurons.\nSo this is interesting.\nWe have the same\ncompounds, THC and/or CBD,\nbrought into the body and brain,\nbinding the same receptors,\nin this case, the CB1\nreceptors, but depending\non where those\nreceptors are located\nand which brain areas\nwe're referring to,\nthey are either causing\nheightened levels of alertness\nand activation of\nsystems that are designed\nto make you talkative, and\nalertness, and mood, et cetera,\nfocus, or they are causing\nsuppression of those circuitry.\nSo we have a seesaw effect\nhere where the same compound is\nincreasing mood, and\nalertness, and focus,\nin the prefrontal cortex, and\nis decreasing stress and threat\ndetection in the amygdala.\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nwhy especially the sativa\nvarieties of\ncannabis allow people\nto enter these states of focus,\nsome might even say flow.\nAlthough, I don't\nwant to go into what\nflow states really are.\nThat's for a\ndifferent discussion,\nand it's very poorly\ndefined as it is.\nAnd I certainly don't want\nto give people the impression\nthat cannabis increases flow\nstates, because that's not\nalways the case.\nAnd certainly, most often,\nis not going to be the case.\nBut the idea here is that this\nmolecule comes into our brain\nand is shifting everything\ntowards a state of focus,\nelevated mood, of heightened\nsense of importance\nabout whatever it is that\nwe happen to be doing.\nAnd now, of course, whatever\nwe could happen to be doing\ncould be writing a\nsong, writing poetry,\ncommunicating with somebody.\nBut it could also\nbe something as\ntrivial as watching cartoons, or\nwatching a movie, which is not\ntrivial in its own\nright but in terms\nof thinking about\nthe creative aspects\nor the creative activity\nstimulating aspects\nof cannabis, not\nproductivity oriented.\nSo narrowed focus, elevated\nmood, more relaxed,\nand yet energetic.\nThat's the major effects of\nthe sativa varieties except--\nand this is a really\nbig boldface, triple\nunderline except--\nexcept in some individuals,\ndepending on dosage\nbut also depending on\npreexisting neural circuitry\nand propensity for\nanxiety, some people\ningest or smoke\nsativa varieties,\nand regardless of whether or not\nit's a type I, type II, or type\nIII variety.\nOK, regardless of the\nratio between THC and CBD,\npeople will experience\nintense anxiety and paranoia.\nNow, how do you predict who\nwill experience intense anxiety\nand paranoia and who\nwill experience intense\nrelaxation, focus, and\nsense of creativity\nfrom ingesting or smoking a type\nI, type II, or type III sativa?\nWell, there is no\nway to predict that.\nAnd there's a lot of what I\nwould call street lore, or dorm\nroom lore, or peer--\nnot peer reviewed\nbut peer discussed,\nI mean, among friends, and\npeople, and acquaintances lore\nout there that what\none needs to do\nis simply smoke more\nor just ingest more.\nYou hear that, oh, well, listen\nif it makes you paranoid,\nyou simply need to use more.\nThat is absolutely\ncategorically false.\nEverything we know about the\nway that THC and CBD work\nis that they tend\nto potentiate, that\nis increase the effects\nof these different systems\nat given synapses and in\ndifferent areas of the brain\nand body.\nThat is if someone experiences\nparanoia or anxiety\nfrom a given strain of\nthe marijuana plant,\nor from ingesting an\nedible in a particular way,\nor a particular kind of edible,\nthat person is very likely\nto experience the same\neffect every time they\ningest that strain or variety.\nThis is part of what's led\nto this enormous industry.\nI mean, there are a number\nof different reasons,\nbut this is part of what's\nled to this enormous industry\nof highly-customized\ncannabis, where\npeople will spend some\ntime really seeking out\nthe different strains\nof cannabis and hybrids\nof cannabis that work best for\nthem and work best for them\nin particular contexts.\nI wish I could tell you\nthat if you are a person who\nis between 5 foot\n7 and 6 feet tall,\nand you have blue\neyes, or brown eyes,\nthat the sativa varieties are\ngoing to be right for you,\nor that the sativa varieties\nare going to give you\npanic attacks, I can't do that.\nThe only way to\ndetermine it would\nbe to actually experience\ningesting those or smoking\nthose, which is certainly\nalso not what I'm suggesting.\nThat's up to you.\nI'm not telling you what\nto do or what not to do,\nbut there are no\ngood predictors.\nIn fact, if you look\nin the literature,\nit is not at all\nclear that people\nwho have a heightened\nlevel of anxiety\nwhen they do not smoke cannabis\nwill experience cannabis\nas less paranoia inducing\nor more relaxing.\nThat's simply not the case.\nNow, what we can say for sure\nis that general categories\nof effects, such as increased\nfocus and reduced anxiety\nare largely due to\nactivation of areas\nlike the prefrontal cortex.\nNow, unlike other compounds\nlike nicotine, or alcohol,\nor neurotransmitter\nsystems like dopamine,\nwhen we talk about the\ncannabinoid system,\nand I say, effects, biological\neffects, psychoactive effects,\nI want you to keep in mind\nalways, please, please, please,\nkeep in mind that those\neffects can be varied and often\nopposite in direction.\nSo let's just give\nan example of that.\nI just mentioned that when\npeople smoke or eat sativa,\nthat it tends to lead\nto one specific set of--\nor generally leads\nto one specific set\nof effects, heightened\nfocus, mood, et cetera.\nWhereas when they\ningest or smoke\nindica and its\ncomponents, all right,\nagain, we're still talking about\nTHC and CBD in varying ratios.\nBut now indica\ncannabis and say, well,\nwhy would it improve the\ntransition time to sleep?\nOr at least give\npeople the impression\nthat it improved the\ntransition time to sleep?\nWe'll talk about\nwhat indica actually\ndoes for sleep in a little bit.\nBut indica also\ntends to suppress\nactivation of the amygdala\nand threat detection centers\nin the brain.\nAgain, binding the same CB1\nreceptors and those retrograde\nsignaling mechanisms that\nwe talked about before,\nbut it also tends to shut\ndown the hippocampus,\nan area of the brain\nassociated with memory,\nwhich is why indica varieties\nlead to pronounced--\nor I should say profound\ndefects in short-term memory\nand sometimes in\nlong-term memory\nas well if it's consumed\nover long periods of time.\nWe'll talk about short, medium,\nand long-term consumption,\noccasional consumption\ngoing forward.\nSo what I'd like\nyou to take away\nfrom this component\nof the discussion\nis first of all, the mechanism\nof action by which cannabis\nimpacts the brain and body,\nbut in particular the brain\nis going to be\nthrough CB1 receptors.\nAnd those CB1 receptors can\nlead to either an acceleration\nor a brake on particular\nbiological mechanisms.\nAnd there are going\nto be a constellation\nof different\naccelerations and braking\nof different neural systems in\nthe brain and body depending on\nwhether or not people\ningest sativa or indica\nor some hybrid strain.\nAnd perhaps most\nimportantly, even\nif you didn't\nunderstand anything\nthat I've said about the biology\nof these different strains\nand the receptors,\nplease do understand\nthat there is no\nway to predict what\nthe effect of a given strain\nwill be on an individual.\nThere has been\nextensive exploration\nas to whether or not people who\nare so-called mellower, or more\nanxious, or any number\nof different personality\ndimensions will respond\nin one way or the other.\nBut in fact, there\nis no way to tell.\nLayer on top of that the\nfact that dosing THC and CBD\ncan be fairly straightforward\nin the form of edibles\nbecause there can be, at least\nif it's a controlled source,\na defined number of milligrams\nof THC, a defined number\nof milligrams of CBD.\nThat's true for ingestibles.\nIt's much harder to gauge\nthat from the smokable forms\nof cannabis, especially if\nthose smokable forms of cannabis\nare obtained through\nsources where there isn't\na lot of clear information\nabout the total amount of THC\nin that product.\nNow, this is all\nchanging quite a lot\nnowadays because of the\ncommercialization of THC\nand CBD products and cannabis\nin a number of different areas,\nincluding in the United States.\nBut still many people are\ningesting cannabis, THC, CBD\nthrough sources where they don't\nreally know how much they're\nbringing into their system.\nAnd so whether or not someone\ngets incredible anxiety relief,\nenhanced sense of mood and focus\nand wellbeing, pain relief,\net cetera, or whether\nor not they have full\nblown panic attacks,\net cetera, is very hard\nto predict based on\ndosage information alone.\nNow, of course, we can\ncreate broad categories,\nand we are going to\ntalk about studies\nthat create broad categories\nof low dose, moderate dose,\nand high dose, frequent\nuse, and infrequent use.\nBut unlike alcohol,\nunlike nicotine,\nwe can't really\npoint to specificity\nof X amount of grams\nof alcohol per week,\nwhich is say, for X amount of\nalcohol, which is not safe.\nAnd so I know a lot of people\nout there are wondering,\nhow often can they\nsmoke cannabis,\nor how often can they eat\ncannabis, or THC, or CBD,\nin any number of its different\nforms and products safely?\nWell, we have to really\ndefine what safely means,\nand we have to\nreally acknowledge\nthat there's a pretty loose\nset of controls over what one\nis bringing into\ntheir brain and body\nas they ingest THC and CBD.\nBut even under conditions in\nwhich it's very controlled,\nit's very hard to predict\nwhat those effects will be.\nSo before moving into\nspecifics of taking cannabis,\nor not taking\ncannabis, who should,\nwho shouldn't, what the\nmedicinal purposes are,\nand what some of the newer\nexciting data point to,\nI just briefly want\nto make a list.\nAnd I promise very briefly.\nI know I'm not often\nconcise, but I do try\nto be thorough for your sake.\nI want to make a very brief\nlist of the different brain\nareas that are impacted\nby THC and CBD,\nand why THC and CBD have\nthe various effects they do.\nWhen somebody smokes\nor ingests cannabis,\ndoesn't matter what the\nTHC or CBD ratio is,\nif they experience\ndeficits in memory,\nand that's almost\nalways present,\nthat's going to be\nbecause of reductions\nin electrical activity\nwithin this brain region\nwe call the hippocampus.\nHippocampus means seahorse.\nIt's shaped like a seahorse.\nAnatomists like to name things\nafter what things look like.\nBut hippocampus,\nmemory is reduced,\nin particular short-term memory.\nThat's true regardless\nof whether or not\none is using sativa,\nindica, or some hybrid.\nIn general the\nprefrontal cortex is\ngoing to be activated by\nthe sativa varieties, which\nis going to increase thinking\nand narrowly constrain focus\nto some activity.\nAnd that's more\ncommonly associated\nwith the sativa varieties.\nThe indica varieties\nas I mentioned\nbefore tend to lead to a\nsuppression of activity\nin prefrontal cortex,\nbelieve it or not.\nAnd turn off thinking\nand planning.\nThis is why indica\nvarieties are often\nused for relaxation and\nfor promoting sleep.\nRegardless of whether or not\nsativa or indica variety,\nand again, regardless of\nthe ratio of THC to CBD,\nthere is a general\nsuppression of neural circuits\nwithin the so-called basal\nganglia and cerebellum.\nBasal ganglia and\ncerebellum are areas\nof the brain that are\ninvolved in action\nplanning and withholding\naction so that\nwould be the basal ganglia\nso-called go-no-go circuitry.\nAnd the cerebellum\nwhich is involved\nin balance but also motor\nplanning and motor sequencing.\nThis is why people\nwho smoke marijuana\nregardless of the\nstrain will tend\nto be less physically mobile.\nOther common effects are\nreddening of the eyes, dryness\nof the mouth.\nThat's actually caused by the\nsame general mechanism, which\nis a reduction in the\nsecretion of saliva\nand of tears and\nlubrication of the eyes\nfrom the lacrimal glands\nof the eyes because\nof the presence of\nlargely CB2 but also CB1\nreceptors in the\nmouth and on the eyes.\nAnd there tends\nto be, especially\nwith certain\nstrains of cannabis,\nincrease in appetite,\nthe so-called munchies.\nAnd that has everything to do\nwith very, very high density\nof CB1 receptors in\nthe hypothalamus,\nand in particular, areas\nof the hypothalamus\nlike the arcuate nucleus\nof the hypothalamus,\nother areas as well,\nof course, that\nhave tons of CB1\nreceptors bind THC and CBD\nand activate the neurons that\nstrongly stimulate appetite\nthrough two mechanisms.\nOne is a cognitive mechanism\nof creating a preoccupation\nwith food and\nanticipation of taste,\nas well as the\nexperience of taste.\nSo the narrowing of focus\nto what you want to go eat.\nYou really crave pizza.\nIt seems to be high fat,\nhigh carbohydrate foods.\nBut really crave\npizza, and narrowing of\nfocus so that you're not\nthinking about anything else.\nBut also signaling from\nthe hypothalamus to the gut\nto neurons within\nthe stomach itself\nthat regulate blood sugar.\nSo there are strong effects\non blood sugar of THC and CBD\nthat generally lead to\nincreases in appetite.\nSo two parallel mechanisms.\nOne within the brain, one within\nthe body increasing appetite.\nAnd so there's an array\nof different effects.\nAnd as I mentioned\nbefore, CB1 receptors\nare present all over\nthe nervous system\nin the brain, the spinal cord.\nIn fact, the presence of CB1\nreceptors in the spinal cord\nlargely explains the fact that\nTHC and CBD to some extent,\nalthough it's not\nvery well studied,\ncan provide some pain relief.\nI should say some because\na lot of people perceive\nor believe that they experience\nmore pain relief from cannabis\nthan they actually do.\nIt actually has a lot to do with\na perceptual shift to basically\nfocusing on other things.\nBut there does seem to be\nsome antinociceptive meaning\nantipain effects of\ncannabis THC, in particular.\nAnd that is exerted\nlargely through effects\non CB1 receptors in\nneurons of the spinal cord.\nSo a broad array of\neffects are taking\nplace regardless of what strain\nyou take, and whether or not\nyou eat the cannabis, or\nyou smoke the cannabis.\nAnd the broad array of effects\ncan be explained by the fact\nthat retrograde\nsignaling can lead\nto activation or suppression\nof activity in various neurons.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
