    "transcript": "JOCKO WILLINK: The\nsolution to your problem\nis not going to be\nfound in the problem.\nIt's not going to\nbe found in there.\nYou have to get\nout of the problem\nso that you can look at\nit, make an assessment.\nAnd you can assess how\nto solve the problem\nor whether you need to\nsolve the problem or not.\nI mean, there's a lot\nof things in my life\nright now where I shrug\nmy shoulders and go, OK.\nBut-- It's OK.\nOh, someone's saying this, OK.\nRoger that.\nCarry on.\nNo factor.\nMove on.\nAnd then occasionally,\nyou go, OK, this\nis something I need\nto contend with.\nThis is something I\nneed to deal with this.\nThis is something I need\nto shape or adjust or move\nor solve, to use your word.\nThe reason I laugh when I\nsay that is because problems\nyou have to get in there.\nBut if you take a step\nback, you can usually\nsay, oh, a little\nadjustment here,\na little adjustment\nthere, and that thing\nis going to sort itself out.\nSo detachment is a superpower.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Certainly\nis and it certainly one\nthat I need to focus on more.\nI'm grateful for you\nbringing that up.\nThis is the biologist\nin me, but what\nis your process for engaging\ndetachment or for disengaging?\nIs it an active\nprocess, where you go,\nI'm going to detach from this.\nI'm going to put myself\nin a situation that\nis pulling on me.\nThere's this\ngravitational force,\nand I'm going to create some\nimagery in my mind of walking\naway from it.\nDo I physically\nwalk away from it?\nDo I outsource it\nto somebody else?\nWhat are some tools\nfor detachment?\nJOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, this is\none of those situations where\nyou and I had a discussion\nabout the science\nand the practical\napplication aligned.\nSo my original experience\nwith detachment\nwas-- and this is one\nof those moments where\nI said a lot of times things are\njust small moments over time,\nand you make a\nlittle adjustment.\nThis is one of those\nmoments in my life.\nAnd I wrote about in\nLeadership Strategy and Tactics\nwhere I recognized like in\na moment what detachment was\nand how helpful it was.\nI'm on an oil rig doing\na training mission.\nMy whole platoon is\nin a skirmish line\nlooking at a large\narea of the oil rig\nthat we're supposed\nto be clearing.\nAgain, this is not combat.\nThis is in the 90s.\nThere's nothing going on.\nWe're just doing training.\nAnd I'm standing in\nthe skirmish line.\nAnd by the way, I'm the\nyoungest and most junior guy\nin my platoon.\nAnd I'm standing there looking\ndown the sight of my weapon,\nand I'm waiting for\nsomeone to make a call\nand tell us what to do.\nAnd I wait for 5 seconds,\nand I wait for 10 seconds,\nand I wait for 20 seconds,\nand no one's saying anything.\nAnd we're waiting for\na leader in my platoon\nto make a call to tell us what\nto do, to tell me what to do.\nAnd finally after 30 seconds\nwhich seems like an eternity,\nI can't take it anymore.\nAnd so I take a step like a\nfoot, a 1-foot step, 12 inches.\nI take a step off\nthe skirmish line.\nI look to my left.\nI look to my right.\nAnd what I see is every\nother guy in my platoon\nis staring down their\nweapon, staring down\nthe sight of the weapon, which\nmeans their field of view\nis tiny.\nIt's like a 20-degree\nfield of view.\nYou're looking down the\nscope of your weapon,\nor the sight of your\nweapon, and that's\nhow big their field of view is.\nAnd I'm looking,\nand I'm thinking,\noh, there's my\nplatoon commander.\nHe's looking down the scope--\nthe sight of his weapon.\nThere's my platoon\nchief, he's looking down\nthe sight of his weapon.\nThere's my leading\npetty officer,\nhe's looking down the\nsight of his weapon.\nThere's my assistant\nplatoon commander,\nhe's looking down-- so\neveryone in the platoon\nis looking down sight side\nof their weapon, which\nmeans they all have a very\nnarrow field of vision.\nWell, when I take a step\nback and look to my left\nand look to my right, guess what\nkind of field of vision I got?\nI got a massive one.\nI can see the whole scene,\nand I can see exactly what\nit is we need to do.\nAnd at that moment--\nlook, as a new guy,\nyou need to keep\nyour mouth shut.\nYou don't say anything.\nAnd I'm thinking, well, but no\none else is saying anything.\nSo I muster up all the courage\nI can, and I open my mouth\nand I say, hold left,\nclear right, which\nis a basic tactical call.\nNo, this is not a\npatent-level genius maneuver.\nIt's just a normal call to make\nin a situation that we were in.\nI say, hold left, clear right.\nAnd I'm expecting\nto get slapped,\ntold, shut up, new guy.\nBut instead,\neveryone just repeats\nthe call, hold left, clear\nright, hold left, clear right.\nAnd we execute the\nmaneuver, and we finish\nthe clearance of this oil rig.\nAnd we get done,\nwe get to the top\nof the oil rig, which means\nwe cleared the whole thing.\nWe're on the helo deck at the\ntop, and we go into a debrief.\nAnd now I'm expecting,\nOK, now, I'm\ngoing to get told, hey,\nwhat were you doing?\nYou need to keep\nyour mouth shut.\nAnd instead, the\nplatoon chief goes,\nhey, Jocko, good call on\nthe cellar deck down there.\nAnd I was like,\nyeah, that's right.\nBut then I thought to\nmyself, hold on a second.\nWhy if I'm the youngest most\njunior guy in this platoon,\nwhy was I able to\nsee what we needed\nto do and make that call?\nWhy did that just happen?\nAnd then I realized it was\nbecause I took a step back.\nTo use your term, I\nbroadened my field\nof view, which\nallowed me to think\nmore clearly because instead of\nbeing hyperfocused and narrowly\nfocused, I broadened\nmy range of vision.\nI took a breath\nbefore I made my call.\nI had take a nice\nbreath to speak clearly.\nAnd I realized that taking\na step back and detaching,\nI got to see infinitely\nmore than even the most\nexperienced guys in my platoon.\nAnd I started doing\nit all the time.\nAnd I started doing\nit in land warfare.\nI started doing it\nin urban combat.\nI started doing it in all these\ntactical training scenarios.\nThese are just training.\nThis is the '90s.\nI started doing these\ntraining scenarios,\nand it always allowed me to\nsee what we needed to do.\nAnd then I started doing it\nwhen I was having conversations\nwith people.\nAnd having a conversation\nwith my platoon chief,\nand I can see that\nhe's starting to turn\na little red in the face.\nAnd we're about to\nargue about something.\nI said, oh, wait a second.\nI'm taking a step back look and\ngo, he's getting mad right now,\nand he's the platoon chief.\nYou better just de-escalate\nthis thing real quick.\nAnd I'd say, hey, you know\nwhat, chief, that sounds good.\nLet me go relook at\nthe plan or whatever.\nAnd so I started to do\nthis with my normal life.\nIt was to not get wrapped\nup in my own emotions.\nNot get wrapped up in the gun\nfight that was happening right\nin front of my face.\nNot to get wrapped up in the\ndetails of what was going on,\nbut instead, take a step\nback, detach, look around\nand then you can make a\nmuch, much better decision.\nAnd it's not-- it's exponential.\nIf you're looking down\nthe sights of your weapon,\nand you take a step back,\nand you look around,\nit's exponential how\nmuch more you can see.\nNow, listen, if you are the\nonly person in a gunfight,\nit's going to be harder for\nyou to do that because you've\ngot to be focused on\nwhatever you're shooting at.\nBut when you have 16 guys\nor 20 guys they're all\nlooking in the same\ndirection, it's very easy\nto be the guy that goes,\nI'm going take a step back,\nlook around, make a call.\nSo when you talk\nabout the mechanics--\nwhen I teach this to people\nnow-- the mechanics of it,\ntake a step back literally.\nYou and I are at\na meeting, there's\na bunch of people this starts\nto get heated argument,\nI will literally push my chair\nback away from the table.\nChange my perspective.\nWiden my field of view.\nThe other thing in the SEAL\nTeams you don't want to sound\npanicked on the radio\nfor a couple of reasons.\nNumber one, because when\nyou panic on the radio,\nit's going to cause\nother people to panic.\nNumber two, if you panic\non the radio, and you sound\npanicked, everyone's\ngoing to make fun of you.\nSo when you get back\nfrom the mission\neveryone is going to go--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Double whammy.\nJOCKO WILLINK: --yeah.\nYou sounded like\na baby out there.\nSo what would I do before\nI would key up my radio,\ntake a breath.\nAnd so here I'm manually\nslowing down my breath.\nI'm broadening my field of view.\nSo if you're in a meeting,\nor you're in a-- you're\nat the supermarket\nparking lot, and someone\nstarts to yell at you, take\na step back, take a breath,\nbroaden your field of view.\nDetach from those\nemotions that you're\nhaving and make some space.\nAnd that's how I go through\nthe mechanics of detachment.\nNow, I can tell you\nright now I mean,\nwhen you do this all the time,\nwhich I do this all the time.\nYeah, I don't really\nhave to step back.\nBut when you're starting to\nbe able to try and do this,\nabsolutely.\nMake-- And I'll tell\nyou here's another\nlike weird little nuance\nthing, lift your chin up,\nand put your hands down.\nNow, this is not in a combat\nsituation, not in a fight.\nBut here's the thing,\nwhen I get defensive\nwhat am I going to do?\nI'll raise my hands up\nand put my chin down.\nThat's like a fighting mode.\nSo if you and I are\nhaving a discussion,\nand I'm starting to get heated,\nand I'm starting to like,\noh, he's not listening to me.\nInstead of me putting my chin\ndown and put my hands like\nup to where I can put them\nin your face a little bit,\nno, I'm actually going\nto take a step back\nand say, put my chin up.\nIt changes my perspective\na little bit more,\nchanges my visual\nperspective just by changing\nthe angle of my head.\nTake a step back,\nput my hands down.\nI'm not being in a defensible--\nI actually want to hear\nwhat you have to say.\nAnd if I start listening\nto what you have to say\nand not talking--\nit's very hard to be\ndetached when you're talking.\nIt's another key component.\nYou want to detach,\nshut your mouth.\nSo I'm in meetings in a\nbunch of different companies.\nI'm running-- I\nhave a bunch of--\nI own a bunch of\ndifferent companies.\nI'm in a meeting\nin my companies,\nI'm not the one that's\ndoing all the talking.\nIn fact, I'm doing\nmostly listening.\nWhen I'm in Task Unit\nBruiser, my task unit,\nI'm not sitting there\ngiving the entire brief.\nNo, I'm letting\nthe platoon chief\nand the platoon commanders\ngive those briefs.\nAnd that way, I'm detached.\nI'm listening to what\nthey have to say.\nI'm more capable of seeing what\nholes there are in their plans\nby not moving my mouth,\nnot talking, I'm listening.\nSo those are some of the\nmethodologies that I use\nand that I advise people to use\nin order to effectively start\ndown the pathway of being able\nto detach in various scenarios."
