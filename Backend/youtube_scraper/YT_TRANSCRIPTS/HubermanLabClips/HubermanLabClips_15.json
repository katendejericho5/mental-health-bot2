    "transcript": "One subject that we haven't talked about\non this podcast previously\nbut is of tremendous interest to people\nis traumatic brain injury\nor concussion, even mild concussion.\nAnd before we were recording today,\nwe were talking about football.\nBut just want to remind\npeople that football\nis just one instance of an opportunity\nto get a concussion or\ntraumatic brain injury.\nMost traumatic brain injury\nand concussion is not due to football.\nIt just gets a lot of the attention.\nBut you've got bicycle accidents,\ncar accidents, playground accidents.\nMaybe you could list off a few more,\nbut how common is TBI and concussion?\nAnd maybe you could just perhaps list out\nsome of the other situations\nwhere you see a lot of this,\nthat it's a bit more cryptic,\nthat people wouldn't\nnecessarily think that sport\nor that that population\ngets TBI, but they do.\nYeah, I think concussion\nis much more prevalent than we realize\nand the numbers have gone up and up\nnot because it's becoming more common,\njust it's becoming more recognized.\nAnd I think we underestimated\nand trivialize sort of\nwhat a concussion is.\nThat it's just something that is just,\nyou're going to recover from it.\nI mean, still the old school thinking\nby a lot of neurologists\nis that everyone gets better\nwithin a couple of months.\nJust wait it out and you'll get better.\nThat's just the normal\ntime course of concussion.\nBut as we've studied it more,\nwe've realized that there's\nactually quite a large percentage\nof people who a year out,\nthey're still suffering problems.\nThey still feel like\nthey're not mentally clear,\nand they still are sensitive to light,\nand they still feel a little dizzy,\nand just there's a host of symptoms\nthat just one year\nlater after a concussion\nwhere they didn't even lose consciousness,\nthat something that they\nmay not have even talked\nto their doctor about is lingering.\nAnd so it's a real,\nwe call this persistent\npost-concussion syndrome\nand that's the most worrisome to me\nbecause it is true that most\nconcussions will recover.\nLuckily the brain is incredibly resilient,\nincredibly plastic, and\nit will heal itself.\nBut there are a lot of\npatients where it just persists\nand those are the most worrisome to me\nbecause we don't have\nvery good interventions\nto try and help that\nand I don't think we take these patients\nvery seriously when they're complaining\nof something that seems very vague\nand not very specific to most doctors.\nWhat do you tell a patient who comes in\nand has clearly had a concussion,\nmild or severe concussion?\nMaybe a car accident,\nmaybe a sports injury.\nMaybe they were knocked\nout cold, maybe not,\nbut they're having some\nheadaches, some photophobia,\nsensitivity to light,\njust feeling not right.\nI've had a couple of these unfortunately\nand you just feel off.\nYou don't feel quite right,\nand some of that\nmanifests as focus issues.\nThis was some years ago.\nI like to think I'm through it.\nI've had scans and I'm\ngood, so thank goodness,\nbut what do you tell them\nbesides don't get another one?\nYeah, well, first of all,\nI explain what a concussion is.\nWhat I've found in neurology,\na lot of what patients want to know\nis they just want to\nunderstand their problem.\nNot walking in expecting a cure.\nJust understanding what it is,\nhaving someone understand\nwhat happened to them\nis very helpful and comforting.\nSo what we mean by concussion\nand in the clinical world,\nwe use mild traumatic brain injury\nkind of synonymously with concussion,\nit basically is a tearing of axons.\nIt's the brain cells\nhave these long fibers\nthat communicate with each other\nand they're called axons.\nAnd when the brain violently\nmoves forward and backwards,\nif you're in a car accident\nand you have your seatbelt on,\nand suddenly you go from 50 to zero,\nyour head violently goes forward\nand violently goes backwards\nand that angular force actually tears\nand stretches axons in the brain.\nSo if you've had a concussion,\nyou have torn some axons.\nI mean, luckily we have billions of them\nand so if you tear a couple\na thousand, you will recover.\nBut you have torn axon.\nIt's a real neurological,\nit's a real brain injury\neven if you haven't lost consciousness\nand you've only had symptoms\nfor a couple of days.\nAnd there's a correlation.\nThe longer you've lost consciousness\nand the longer your symptoms last,\nthe more axons you've torn,\nthis kind of a direct\nrelationship between the two.\nSo the mechanism is these torn axons,\nso now neuron cells don't\ncommunicate with each other\nand the different brain ranges\nare not communicating with each other.\nSo, and it turns out the most common place\nfor axon of tear is in the frontal lobes\nand so now we talked\nabout all these things\nthat the frontal lobes do\nto orchestrate the rest of the brain\nwhile it has some injured pathways.\nAnd that's why a lot of the\nsymptoms that patients have\nare these kind of mild executive symptoms,\nthis mental fogginess\nthat they're describing\nis just this inability to get things done.\nThey don't lose knowledge of who they,\nthey don't forget their name,\nor forget where they live,\nor lose memories from the past\nor anything like that,\nbut they don't officially get things done\nas well as they used to.\nIt only takes a little\nbit of a drop, right?\nPeople think you have to have a big drop\nin performance to have a real life impact.\nJust a 1% drop\nand you're having a hard\ntime doing your podcast\nor teaching a lecture\nor whatever you might do.\nA 1% drop sounds like a\nfrighteningly small change\nrequired to negatively impact life,\nso how about a poor night's sleep?\nI mean, what kind of drop in\nprefrontal cortical function\nare we looking at from a,\nlet's say I normally\nget seven or eight hours\nor six to eight hours\nand I suddenly only get three or four.\nAre we talking a significant detriment?\nI do think so.\nI do think that yeah,\nthat it is significant,\na poor night's sleep,\nand we all notice that.\nI mean, it's very obvious.\nI mean, and it's hard to sort of quantify.\nI'm a baseball fan,\nso I can quantify it like\nif you think about a pitcher\nand how fast they throw.\nA small drop for them,\nsomeone who's throwing 100 miles an hour,\njust a small drop turns them\nfrom really elite to someone mediocre.\nMaybe it's more of a 10% drop,\nbut still a relatively small\ndrop can have a huge impact.\nI think people think\nthat just because you're a little bit off,\nthat's not a big deal.\nYou kind of work through it\nand that's what most doctors say.\nJust plow through it.\nJust work your way through it.\nYou're going to get better\nas opposed to saying,\n\"Yeah, you really had a brain injury.\nThis is what happened.\nWe need to rehabilitate\nyou just like we do\nif you tore your anterior\ncruciate ligament.\nI don't know why tearing\nyour cruciate ligament\nor your achilles tendon gets more interest\nthan tearing axons in your brain.\nIt's amazing to me that\nthere's more emphasis\non orthopedic injuries\nthan brain injuries.\nYeah, I don't know why that\nis either. I think the brain\nis mysterious enough that most people\nand many clinicians just kind of back away\nwith hands raised.\nBut if you are in the field\nof neurology or psychiatry,\nI suppose then one has\nofficially signed on to try\nand resolve these matters, right?\nSo for somebody that has\na traumatic brain injury\nor low level concussion, excuse me,\nwould part of the primary advice be to try\nand get one's sleep as good as possible?\nGiven that sleep deprivation can compound\ntraumatic brain injury-induce\ndeficits in working memory?\nAnd who knows, maybe a good portion\nof the deficits in working memory\ndue to traumatic brain\ninjury and concussion\nis because of the sleep\ndeprivation that it can cause,\nso it can get circular, yeah.\nNot only that, but one of\nthe most common symptoms\nthat my patients with concussion have\nis their sleep is disruptive,\nand that's true in neurology.\nIt's fascinating, almost\nevery neurological disorder,\nmy patients complain of their sleep.\nAnd I started asking,\nnot a lot of neurologists\nask you how you sleep.\nBut I remember back from my residency,\none of the first things\nmy attending would do\nwhen we got to the ward is say,\n\"How'd you sleep last night?\"\nAnd just across the board,\npatients are not falling asleep,\nthey're not staying asleep,\nand we still don't understand\nwhy just brain injury does that.\nSo almost every concussion patient says,\n\"I'm not sleeping well,\"\nwhich then compounds the problem.\nSo optimizing sleep obviously,\noptimizing nutrition.\nThere's a question about activity.\nIt used to be that we used to recommend\nyou had a concussion,\ndon't go to work.\nJust take it easy for a\nwhile, don't exercise.\nKeep the blinds drawn.\nBut now the idea is that\nyou should really get up\nand moving is best.\nYou got tO do what you can tolerate.\nYou don't want to give yourself a,\nyou don't want to give\nyourself more of a headache\nor more light sensitivity,\nbut as much as you can tolerate\nis the thought these days about\nsort of promoting recovery\nand then really getting\nyour brain back working.\nI think a lot of my patients,\nthey're off from work for a couple weeks,\nand they feel fine\nand they think they're pretty much normal,\nand then the first day of\nwork is a complete disaster\nbecause until you actually\ntest it in real life,\nyou don't know what kind\nof troubles you have.\nSo I don't recommend\ngoing back full steam,\nbut I do recommend going back,\ntrying to build up these skills again.\nAnd then I think we need\nto develop therapies\nthat people will use.\nThings like goal management training\nwhich involves a therapist\nand health insurance doesn't pay for this.\nSo 99% of my patients don't get any help\nby any kind of intervention unfortunately.\nBut now we talked about\ntechnology, things like BrainHQ.\nDo you know about BrainHQ?\nNo.\nSo Mike Merzenich, which I know you've\ntalked about with Eddie,\ndeveloped a company called Posit Science\nwhere developed these brain training games\nthat can help and prove\nspecific cognitive functions\nand they're very easy to\ndo because they're online,\nand there's science behind them,\nand you can do them.\nSo in that way, you don't\nhave a therapist in your room,\nbut you can online sort\nof do these sort of things\nthat are targeting specific mechanisms\nto try and improve the kind of things\nthat we think are impaired by concussion,\nand I'd like to see more patients\nget started on some of those things.\nUnfortunately if you go on the web\nand just say do brain training,\nyou'll be overwhelmed with things\nand you don't know what\nworks and what doesn't work.\nYeah, I think the work that Merzenich\nand colleagues have done,\nand we'll provide a link to that.\nI don't have any financial\nstake in his work\nor products, trainings, that is.\nBut I will say I think Mike's\nwork has been tremendous.\nI mean, he is so far ahead of the curve.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
