    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Cannabis\nis a unique instance\nin which nowadays\nwe are hearing,\nyes, it's becoming legal\nin a number of areas,\nand we talked earlier\nabout why that's probably\na good thing in\nmost circumstances,\nbut that we aren't just\nhearing that cannabis is safe\nor it's not just being implied\nthat cannabis is safer,\nbut many more people are talking\nabout the positive effects\nof cannabis without\na lot of discussion\nabout the negative\neffects of cannabis.\nAnd I realize that\nsaying this is\ngoing to upset some\npeople out there\nbecause I know that there are\na number of people who fought\nvery hard for the\nlegalization process,\nand I want to acknowledge that.\nI also want to acknowledge the\nmany known positive effects\nof cannabis in adults\nwith very occasional use,\nprovided it is delivered\nsafely and in the safe context\nand setting and with legality.\nThat is entirely distinct\nfrom the issue of\nwhether or not cannabis\nis safe for the developing\nbrain and body.\nAgain, I'm not demonizing\nanybody for using cannabis,\nbut I want to make the point\nvery simply and very directly.\nIt is far and away a\ndifferent circumstance\nfor the brain for\nan individual to be\n25 years or older and using\ncannabis, in whatever form,\noccasionally or maybe\neven frequently,\nthan it is for a young\nperson aged 14 to 25\nto be using cannabis,\neither by smoking or vaping\nor by edible or any other\nform, on the brain and body.\nIt's absolutely clear that\nthe brain continues to develop\nat least until age 25 and that\na huge number of systems related\nto mood regulation, so-called\nthe executive function,\nthe ability to organize\none's thoughts, plan,\nand execute plans, essentially\nto become a functional human\nbeing--\nthat's one portion of becoming\na functional human being,\nbut certainly an essential one--\nall of that relies\non the fine-tuning\nof this neural circuitry\nthat we've been\ntalking about up until now.\nAnd it's abundantly\nclear that cannabis,\nand THC in particular,\ndramatically\ndisrupt those processes.\nSo if this isn't clear enough\njust from my statements,\nI'd like to point to\na particular paper.\nThis is one of the\nmore impactful papers\nin this area in recent years.\nThis is a paper published in\nLancet Psychiatry in 2022.\nThe title is \"Association\nof cannabis potency\nwith mental ill\nhealth and addiction:\na systematic review.\"\nThere are a number of\nvery important points\nin this very fine paper.\nLancet Psychiatry is one of\nthe Premier medical journals\nout there, and they evaluated\na huge number of studies.\nThey actually looked at\nmore than 4,000 studies.\nThey selected the\nones that were only\nthe most rigorous in terms\nof study design and analysis\nand rigor of\nconclusions, and they\nlooked at how early\nuse of cannabis\nimpacted later\nprobability of development\nof psychosis and other\npsychiatric conditions.\nAnd the takeaways from\nthis study are very clear.\nFirst of all, chronic\ncannabis use--\nso more than twice per week--\nhas consistently been associated\nwith mental health disorders.\nI'm pulling some phrases\ndirectly from the paper.\nHeavy cannabis use,\nmeaning cannabis use\nmore frequent than\ntwice per week,\nhas been associated with four\ntimes the risk of psychosis\nlater in life.\nIn particular, schizophrenia\nand bipolar-like episodes.\nNow, we've done an episode\non bipolar disorder,\nso-called bipolar depression.\nWe have not yet done\none on schizophrenia.\nBut both bipolar disorder\nand schizophrenia\nhave a very, very strong\ngenetic component.\nThere's a 30-- three zero--\ntimes greater\nlikelihood that you\nhave bipolar disorder if you\nhave a first relative who\nhas bipolar disorder.\nAnd then it's also\nthe case that using\ncannabis, especially during\nadolescence and the teen years\nand up until age 25, create\na four times greater risk\nof psychosis for those that\nhave a predisposition to bipolar\ndisorder and/or schizophrenia.\nNow, I don't hear very much\nabout this in the media.\nThis paper got some\nattention, and then\nit sort of got swept away.\nI don't think that was an\nintentional sweeping way.\nThere's just a lot of events\nin the world, as you well know.\nBut I think it's a particularly\nimportant set of findings,\nbecause, obviously, in\nlooking at so many studies,\nit distills out the strongest\nfindings that are out there\nand really pulls the\nconsistent messages that\nare arriving from all\nthese different studies.\nAnd, as they point out-- and,\nagain, I'm paraphrasing here--\nthis is the first\nsystematic review\nof the association of cannabis\npotency, and all of the data\npoint to a very clear\nconclusion, which\nis the more potent\nthe THC concentration,\nthe higher probability\nof developing psychosis\nor a major depressive episode\nor a major anxiety disorder\nlater in life.\nThat should be of\nparticular concern\nbecause we know, we\nare absolutely clear,\nabout the fact that with the\nadvent of all these new strains\nof cannabis and with the\nengineering and availability\nof cannabis at much higher\npotency, meaning THC potency,\nthe risk of psychosis\nis going up and up\nand is likely to continue going\nup unless something is done\nto reduce the frequency\nof cannabis use\nto zero, ideally, or to\nvery low frequency, very\nlow potency, in\nadolescents and teens\nand people age 25 or younger.\nI know a lot of\npeople don't want\nto hear this message because,\nfirst of all, it's alarming,\nand, second of all, as\nI mentioned earlier,\nthe statistics tell us that\nthe greatest number of people\nthat are starting\nto use cannabis\nare in the age\nbracket of 16 to 24.\nMany of them are functional\nin other areas of life.\nThey are students.\nThey are employed, et cetera.\nBut when you couple\nthat with the fact\nthat the most frequent\nadopters of cannabis use\nare in this age\nbracket of 16 to 24--\nthey're twice as likely to\nuse as other individuals\nor to start using cannabis\nas are other individuals--\nplus the general perception\nout there because of the way\nthat cannabis is discussed in\nthe media and by sports figures\nand by celebrities\nand by politicians,\net cetera, that it's not as\nbad as alcohol and maybe not\nthat bad and maybe even\nhas health benefits,\nthen you're\nessentially setting up\na system where young\npeople are far more\nlikely to adopt and continue\ncannabis use without realizing\nthese serious health\nconsequences that await them\nlater.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
