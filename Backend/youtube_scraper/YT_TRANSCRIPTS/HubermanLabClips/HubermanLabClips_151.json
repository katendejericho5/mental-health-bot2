    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: So let's\nnow return to the question\nof whether or not cannabis\nand its different components\nincrease creativity.\nAnd when you look at\nthe literature on this,\nyou find studies that very\nclearly point to a yes.\nIt increases creativity.\nAnd it's not\nsurprising, therefore,\nthat cannabis can increase\ndopamine transmission, that\nis dopamine levels, in\ncertain brain areas,\nin particular brain\nareas involved\nin thinking and planning.\nSo cannabis increases\ndopamine in these areas.\nElevated dopamine increases\ndivergent thinking.\nAnd divergent thinking is\nassociated with creativity,\nand there are studies that\nsupport the idea that cannabis\ncan increase creativity.\nHowever, there are at\nleast as many studies\nthat say that cannabis does\nnot increase creativity,\nthat cannabis increases\nconsideration of multiple ideas\nperhaps through elevation of\ndopamine and related systems,\nbut that ultimately the\nideas that converge from that\nare not truly creative ideas.\nAt least they don't\nmeet the criteria\nfor creative brainstorming\nand extraction\nof ideas that are truly novel.\nSo it doesn't\nincrease creativity.\nSo which one is it?\nWell, fortunately, there's\nan entirely distinct set\nof literature that has taken\nall the other literature\ninto consideration, and\nhere's where we arrive.\nSo there's a really nice\nstudy that explored creativity\nin cannabis users, and we will\nprovide a link to the study.\nFirst author is Emily LaFrance,\nand the title of the paper\nis somewhat amusing in\nits own right, which\nis it starts with a question.\nInspired by Mary\nJane-- of course,\nMary Jane being one of the\nold school versions of or ways\nof talking about\ncannabis or marijuana.\nNowadays people refer\nto it mainly as pot\nas other names, too, of course.\nAnd the title of the paper\nis \"Inspired by Mary Jane?\nMechanisms underlying enhanced\ncreativity in cannabis users.\"\nAnd I really like this study\nfor a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, they looked at\npeople who did not use cannabis\nas well as people\nwho use cannabis.\nSo they had two\ndifferent groups,\nbut they did not evaluate\ncreativity of the cannabis\nusers while they were under\nthe influence of cannabis.\nThey looked at the level of\ncreativity in these cannabis\nusers when they were not under\nthe influence of cannabis\nand asked whether or not\ntheir ability to be creative\nwas enhanced by cannabis.\nNow we're going to compare this\nto studies in which people come\ninto the laboratory and\nactually use cannabis\nand then they evaluate\ncreativity under that context,\nbut this study has some\nunique takeaways that I\nthink are really interesting.\nFirst of all, they\ndid, yes, see evidence\nfor enhanced creativity.\nAnd when I say\nenhanced creativity,\nI mean within the context of\nthis divergent thinking thing\nthat I talked\nabout a moment ago.\nAnd when I say enhanced, I\nmean significantly greater\nthan in non-users so people\nthat don't use cannabis.\nSo right now I can imagine\nthat all the cannabis users are\ncheering, yes, cannabis\nincreases creativity,\nmakes people more creative\nthan they would be otherwise.\nWell, this is interesting.\nWe have to ask ourselves\nhow that was accomplished.\nAnd it turns out that one of\nthe major ways in which it\nwas accomplished is that\ncannabis users, even if they\nare not under the\ninfluence of cannabis,\nare far more open to\nnovel ideas and they\nhave a more explorative\nand reduced anxiety\nor I should say\nlower anxiety mode\nof thinking when they\nexplore novel ideas, which\nis essential for\ndivergent thinking.\nSo they observed both enhanced\ndivergent and convergent\ncreative type thinking\nin cannabis users.\nAnd the source of that,\nthey conclude, is--\nand here I'll just quote--\ncannabis users' higher levels\nof openness to experience\nare responsible for their\nenhanced self-reported\ncreativity and convergent\nthinking test performance.\"\nSo it's not necessarily\nthat cannabis\nis increasing the capacity\nof the brain areas\nthat are associated\nwith creativity,\nbut rather cannabis appears\nto be increasing an openness\nand probably doing that in\npart through lowering anxiety\nin particular people.\nAnd that openness is leading\nto inclusion of more ideas\nduring the divergent\nthinking process.\nThey're willing to\nconsider throwing up\nmore things on the wall to\nsee if they stick so to speak.\nSo in their conclusions, they\nhave a really nice statement.\nAgain, I'll just\nread from the paper\nbecause they said it\nbetter than I ever could.\nQuote, while mainstream\nmedia has propagated the idea\nthat cannabis expands the\nmind and enhances creativity,\nour results show the link\nbetween cannabis and creativity\nis largely a\nspurious correlation,\nmeaning that it's not the\ncase that cannabis increases\ncreativity--\nbut and I inserted the\nbut in this quote--\nbut driven by differences\nin personality\nthat are related to\ncannabis use, for example,\nopenness to experience that\nare related to both cannabis\nuse and augmented creativity.\nThis is a real\nchicken egg argument.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWhat I mean is this\npaper finds that people\nwho are more open to experience\nare more likely to use cannabis\nand people who use\ncannabis are going to be\nmore open to new experiences.\nAnd that combination\nof features, openness\nto experience and what that\nopenness to new experiences\nbrings, enhances the convergent\nand divergent thinking\nthat is characteristic\nof the creative process.\nSo in short cannabis increases\ncreativity but through changes\nin personality that tap\ninto the creative process\nrather than directly impacting\nthe neural circuits that,\nfor instance, turn\non creativity.\nAnd I have to say this study\nis really important because\nby exploring cannabis users\nnot while under the influence\nof cannabis, they\nwere able to tap\ninto this very important\nwhat I believe to be fact.\nBecause if you think about a\nstudy in which you would have\none group using cannabis\nand another group not using\ncannabis and then you\ngive them some task that\ntaps into creativity, you will\nsee effects, and very likely\nyou'll see effects where\ncannabis might even\nincrease divergent convergent\nthinking and creativity.\nThose results have actually been\npublished many times before.\nBut given the varied effects of\ncannabis and THC that we talked\nabout earlier through all\nthat complex signaling stuff,\nyou can imagine that there\nwill also be other studies--\nand, in fact, there are--\nwhere divergent and convergent\nthinking and creativity\nis not assisted by\ncannabis and might even be\nreduced by ingesting cannabis.\nHowever, if one considers\nthat divergent thinking is\nabsolutely crucial\nto the creativity\nprocess and the range of\nthings that one will bar\nwill be enhanced by openness and\nby reduced levels of anxiety,\nso a willingness to explore\ndifferent options, some\nof which might seem\ncompletely crazy,\nand cannabis increases\nthe personality types\nand reduces the anxiety that\ncreate that sense of openness,\nwell then it makes\nperfect sense why cannabis\nwould increase creativity\nin certain individuals\nbut not directly.\nAnd this study, the one I just\nreferred to which I should say\nwas published in the Journal of\nConsciousness and Cognition--\nand, again, we'll\nprovide a link to it--\ndid a wonderful job of teasing\nout this impact of cannabis\non personality, which\nthen impacts creativity.\nSo if somebody asks you\nor if you're wondering\nor if you feel like cannabis\nincreases creativity,\nin some sense,\nthe answer is yes,\nbut the answer is yes\nbecause of the ways\nthat it shapes openness\nto new ideas and can--\nI should say can because\nnot in everybody--\nbut can in some\nindividuals reduce anxiety.\nWhat this means is that if you\nare somebody who experiences\nanxiety or increased levels\nof focus from cannabis,\nregardless of the strain--\nyou have to imagine people are\nexploring different strains\nif they're exploring\nthem at all,\nexploring different modes\nof delivery, smoking\nor ingestible, et cetera--\nif you're somebody who\nexperiences anxiety,\nit's very likely that you won't\nhave the increased openness\nto experience and\ndivergent ideas\nthat will facilitate creativity.\nHowever, if you are somebody\nwho achieves heightened\nlevels of relaxation and reduced\nlevels of anxiety from cannabis\nregardless of which strain we\nhappen to be talking about,\nwell then, yes, it\nwill position you\nto be in a heightened\nstate of creativity,\nat least as defined by\nconvergent and divergent\nthinking.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
