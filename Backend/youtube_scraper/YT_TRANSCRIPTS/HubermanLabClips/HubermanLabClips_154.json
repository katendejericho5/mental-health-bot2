    "transcript": "- The solution to your problem\nis not going to be found in the problem,\nit's not going to be found in there.\nYou have to get out of the problem\nso that you can look at\nit, make an assessment,\nand you can assess how\nto solve the problem\nor whether you need to\nsolve the problem or not.\nI mean, there's a lot of\nthings in my life right now\nwhere I shrug my shoulders and go,\n\"Okay, oh, someone's saying this.\n\"Okay, roger that.\n\"Like, carry on, no factor, move on.\"\nAnd then occasionally you go,\n\"Okay, this is something\nI need to contend with,\n\"this is something I need to deal with,\n\"this is something I\nneed to shape, or adjust,\n\"or move, or solve\" to use your word.\nThe reason I laugh when I say that\nis because problems, you\nhave to get in there,\nbut if you take a step\nback, you can usually say,\n\"Oh, little adjustment here,\na little adjustment there,\n\"and that thing's going\nto sort itself out.\""
