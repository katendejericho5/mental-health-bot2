    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: What is the elationship between fasting\nand growth hormone release?\nI find this really interesting.\nKYLE GILLETT: Fasting\ncertainly potently increases\ngrowth hormone release.\nHowever, the end binding to\nthe receptor is less sensitive.\nSo although fasting does\nincrease growth hormone,\nthe genes that are\ndownstream to it--\nboth the growth\nhormone genes and IGF-1\nrelated gene transcription\nactivity-- will not\nbe significantly higher.\nHowever, if you are optimizing\nthe growth hormone that\nis released as a\npulsatile secretion,\nit is helpful to avoid\neating for two hours.\nSo the general rule of thumb\nis avoid eating about two hours\nbefore bed.\nI think that's clinically\nsignificant and helpful.\nBut fasting otherwise\nspecifically for growth hormone\noptimization in\nsomeone who already\nhas normal growth hormone\nsignaling is not helpful."
