    "video_title": "Is Some Alcohol OK During Pregnancy? | Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "- There's an additional category\nthat I want to highlight,\nof course, and this is\nvitally important to state,\neven though it's obvious,\nwhich is that people who are pregnant\nshould absolutely not consume alcohol.\nFetal alcohol syndrome is\nwell-known and established,\nit's terrible.\nFetuses experience\ndiminished brain development\nthat's often permanent,\ndiminished limb development,\ndiminished organ development\nin the periphery,\nmeaning, you know, the heart,\nthe lungs, the liver, et cetera.\nIngesting alcohol while\npregnant is simply a bad idea.\nAnd the reason I say this at all is,\nfirst of all, it's important to include\nin an episode like this,\nbut also because we\ncan look at two things.\nFirst of all, we can look at mechanism,\nand then we can also\nlook at some of the lore\nthat still sadly exists out there.\nLet's take care of the lore\nthat sadly exists first.\nIf you look online,\nyou will sometimes be able to find, sadly,\nthat some people believe\nthat certain kinds of alcohol\nare not detrimental to fetuses.\nThey'll say, \"Well, champagne is safe\nfor a pregnant mother to\ndrink, but beer is not.\"\nThat is absolutely categorically false.\nAlcohol is alcohol.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever\nthat consuming certain types of alcohol\nis safer for fetuses than others.\nAlcohol is a toxin,\nand the reason fetal\nalcohol syndrome exists\nis because the ability of that toxin\nto disrupt cellular processes.\nRemember tumor growth\nand the way that alcohol\ncan accelerate tumor growth\nby proliferation of\ncells, the wrong cells,\nthe ones you don't want to proliferate?\nWell, all of embryonic development,\nall of fetal development, it's\nnot the growth of a tumor,\nit's obviously the growth of an embryo,\nand it's done in a very orchestrated way.\nI started off studying brain development,\nthat's where I got my\nbeginnings in neurobiology,\nand I still teach embryology\nto medical students and graduate students.\nThe set of coordinated processes\nthat has to take place\nfrom conception to birth\nin order to give rise to a healthy embryo\nis so, so dynamically controlled\nand so exquisitely precise\nwith checkpoints, and recovery mechanisms,\nand redundancy in the\ngenes that are expressed\nto make sure that if anything goes wrong,\nit's repaired, et cetera.\nAlcohol as a mutagen, I\nhaven't used that word yet,\nbut a substance that can\nmutate DNA through alterations\nin DNA methylation and these\ncheckpoints in the cell cycle.\nAlcohol as a mutagen is\none of the worst things\nthat a developing embryo\ncan be exposed to.\nAnd again, because it's water\nsoluble and fat soluble,\ningestion of alcohol\nwhen people are pregnant\npasses right to the fetus.\nNow, I realize that a\nnumber of people out there\nmight be thinking, \"Oh, goodness,\nI didn't realize I was pregnant\nuntil a certain stage of pregnancy,\nand before I realized, I\nwas ingesting alcohol.\"\nObviously, one can't\nundo what's been done,\nbut I want to also emphasize\nthat fetal alcohol syndrome,\nwhile, yes, there's a full blown syndrome\nthat manifests as changes in\nthe cranial facial development\nthat are very obvious.\nAnd you can look these up,\nyou've probably seen these before,\nthe pictures before, rather.\nHas to do with eye spacing, forehead size,\na number of other features of\nthe craniofacial development,\nand of course, stuff's\ngoing on in the brain, too.\nIt's along a continuum,\nso it is possible that some of the changes\nthat occur are more minor,\nand thankfully, the young brain,\nin particular, the early postnatal brain\nis incredibly plastic.\nThere are things that can be done\nin order to help recover neural circuits\nthat didn't develop well, et cetera.\nBut even though it's somewhat\nobvious or should be obvious,\nI really want to make clear\nthat there's zero evidence whatsoever\nthat certain forms of alcohol are safer\nfor pregnant women to ingest than others.\nAbsolutely wrong.\nNo one who's pregnant\nshould be ingesting alcohol whatsoever.\nAnd certainly, if people feel like\nthey can't avoid alcohol while pregnant,\nthey really need to work with somebody\nto make sure that it just\nabsolutely doesn't happen,\nbecause it is so detrimental\nto the developing fetus.\n[upbeat music]"
