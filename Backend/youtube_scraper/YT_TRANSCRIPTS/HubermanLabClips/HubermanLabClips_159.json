    "video_title": "How Does Alcohol Increase the Risk of Cancer? | Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "- One of the really\nbad effects of alcohol,\nbut that's extremely well documented,\nis the fact that alcohol,\nbecause of this toxicity of acetaldehyde\nand related pathways,\ncan alter DNA methylation,\nit can alter gene expression.\nThat can be many things\nin different tissues,\nbut it is associated with\na significant increase in cancer risk,\nin particular breast cancer,\nand in particular, because\nbreast tissue is present\nin both males and females,\nbut in women, it's especially vulnerable\nto some of the DNA methylation changes.\nWell, breast cancer in women\nhas a relationship to alcohol intake.\nAnd alcohol intake has a relationship\nto breast cancer in women.\nIn fact, there has been proposed to be a,\nanywhere from four to 13%\nincrease in risk of breast cancer\nfor every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.\nHow much is 10 grams?\nWell, there we need to\nthink a little bit about\nthe variation in the amount\nof alcohol in different drinks\nacross the world.\nDifferent countries serve\ndifferent size drinks\nand have different\nconcentrations of alcohol\nin those drinks.\nSo without going down\ntoo much of a rabbit hole\nand just giving you some good\nrules of thumb to work with,\nthere have been studies of\nthe percentage of alcohol\nincluded in different drinks\nand the sizes of different drinks\nthat are served in different countries.\nAnd here's a kind of a\npatchwork of those findings.\nIn Japan, one beer, one glass of wine,\nor one shot of liquor as it's served there\ntends to include anywhere\nfrom seven to eight grams\nof alcohol.\nIn the U.S., one beer, which\ngenerally is 12 ounces,\nif it's in a bottle, one glass of wine,\nor shot of liquor tends to include\nabout 10 to 12 grams of alcohol.\nAnd in Russia, one drink\nof the various sorts\nthat I just described,\ntypically will have as\nmuch as 24 grams of alcohol\nbecause of the differences in\nthe concentration of alcohols\nand the sizes of drinks that are poured\nin these different countries, okay?\nOf course there are other\ncountries in the world.\nThose countries are\nalso vitally important.\nBut those are the ones that\nextracted from the studies\nthat I could find.\nWhat does this mean?\nWell, what we're talking about\nis that for every 10\ngrams of alcohol consumed,\nso that's one beer in the U.S.,\nmaybe a little bit more\nthan one beer in Japan,\nor basically a third of a drink in Russia,\nthere's a four to 13%\nincrease in risk of cancer.\nThat's pretty outrageous, right?\nAnd you might think, \"Wait,\nhow could it be that,\nyou know, this stuff is even legal?\"\nWell, look, it's, as I\ndescribed before, it's a toxin.\nIt's also a toxin that\npeople enjoy the effects of.\nI mean, in the U.S. at least,\nthey tried prohibition.\nIt certainly did lead, yes,\ndid lead to a reduction in\nalcohol induced health disorders,\nin particular cirrhosis of the liver.\nIt also led to a lot of crime\nbecause it became a substance\nthat a lot of people still wanted\nand that people were\nwilling to break the law\nin order to provide, or I\nshould say, to sell and provide.\nBut the point is that the\nmore alcohol people drink,\nthe greater their increase of cancer,\nin particular breast cancer.\nAnd that's because of\nthe fact that alcohol\nhas these effects on cells\nthat include changes in gene expression.\nAnd cancer, that is the growth of tumors,\nis a dysregulation in cell cycles, right?\nA tumor is a aggregation,\nor the proliferation,\naggregation is stuff sticking\ntogether, by the way.\nProliferation is stuff duplicating.\nProliferation, aggregation of cells,\nthat could be a gliomas, glial cells,\nglioma, brain tumor, right?\nIt could be lymphoma, so within\nthe lymph tissue, et cetera.\nThe mutations that alcohol\ninduces to cause this\nare wide ranging.\nSome of those are\nstarting to be understood.\nFor those of you that are\ninterested in cell biology,\nI'll just mention that the PD1 pathway,\nagain, this is is super specialized\nand for the aficionados only.\nYou don't need to know this.\nThe PD1 pathway seems to be up regulated.\nAnd we knew this from\nthe discussion earlier,\nthere's a down regulation\nin some of the anti-inflammatory molecules\nthat help suppress this\nproliferation of cancers.\nNowadays, there's a lot\nof interest in the fact\nthat the immune system is\nconstantly combating cancers\nthat exist in us all the time.\nYou know, little, little\ntumors start growing\nand our immune system\ngoes and gobbles them up.\nLittle tumors start growing,\nthe immune system senses inflammation,\nsends out these incredible cells,\nthese killers B cells and\nT cells, and beats them up.\nCancers proliferate and take hold\nand cause serious problems\nwhen the proliferation of cells\nexceeds the immune system's\nability to gobble up\nand remove those cells.\nThere are other mechanisms\nof regulating cancers\nbut that's one of the primary one.\nAnd alcohol hits it, again,\nit's a two-hit model.\nIt increases tumor growth\nand it decreases the sorts of molecules\nthat suppress and combat tumor growth.\nSo again, even low to\nmoderate amounts of alcohol\ncan be problematic for sake of cancers,\nin particular breast cancers.\nEpidemiologists and health specialists\nlove to try and compare\ndifferent substances\nin terms of how bad they are.\nRarely do they compare substances\nin terms of how good they\nare, but sometimes they do.\nAnd what they'll sometimes tell you\nand what you can find in the literature\nis that ingesting 10 to\n15 grams of alcohol a day,\nso that would be, like,\none beer in the U.S.,\none glass of wine\nis the same as smoking\n10 cigarettes a day.\nFrankly, it's hard to make\nthat direct relationship\nreally stick because you\nknow, it's a question of,\nyou know, how long people inhale.\nDo they have a predisposition\nto a lung cancer, et cetera.\nBut even if that number is off\nby plus or minus two cigarettes,\nor even if that number\nwould the equivalent\nof one glass of wine equals\none cigarette per day,\nI think there's general consensus now\nthat nicotine consumed by\nvaping or by cigarette,\nit's bad for us in terms of lung cancer\nand other forms of cancer.\nAnd for some reason, I don't know why,\nbecause this knowledge\nabout alcohol and cancer,\nand these established relationships\nhave been known since the late 1980s.\nThe first, you know, kind\nof landmark paper on this\nwas published in 1987.\nI can provide a link to that paper.\nIt's actually quite interesting to read.\nWell, the relationship is there,\nand yet, we don't often\nhear about it, right?\nIn fact, before researching this episode,\nI'd heard before that alcohol\ncan increase cancer risk.\nBut I wasn't aware of just how\nstrong that relationship is.\nBecause of the serious nature\nof what we're talking about\nand because I would hate to be confusing\nor misleading to anybody,\nI wanted to just emphasize\nthat this statistic\nthat there is a four to 13%,\ndepending on which study you look at,\na four to 13% increase\nin the risk of cancer,\nin particular breast cancer,\nfor every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,\nthat's 10 grams per day, so\nthat's one drink per day.\nBut I do want to emphasize that\nif that equates to seven drinks per week\nand all those seven\ndrinks are being consumed\non Friday and Saturday,\nit still averages to 10 grams per day.\nAnd I also want to emphasize\nthat there are things that people can do\nto at least partially offset\nsome of the negative effects of alcohol\nas it relates to predisposition\nto the formation of certain\nkinds of tumors and cancers.\nI also want to be clear before I say it\nthat doing the things\nI'm about to tell you\nis not a guarantee that you're\nnot going to get cancer.\nNor is it a guarantee that alcohol\nis not going to lead to an\nincreased predisposition\nfor certain kinds of cancers.\nAnd the two things are\nconsumption of folate\nand other B vitamins, especially B-12.\nYou know, the consumption\nof folate and B-12\nhas been shown to decrease cancer risk\nin people that ingest alcohol,\nbut not completely offset it.\nWhy that is isn't exactly clear.\nIt probably has something\nto do with the relationship\nbetween folate and B-12\nand other B vitamins\nin gene regulation pathways\nthat can lead to tumor growth.\nAt some point soon, we will get\nan expert in cancer biology,\nand in particular in breast\ncancer biology, on the program.\nAnd we can ask them about this.\nBut I realize this is going\nto raise a number of questions\nand maybe even cause some\nof you to go out there\nand start taking folate and\nother B vitamins and B-12.\nNot incidentally, a lot of the\nreported hangover supplements\nand treatments include folate and B-12.\nI don't know if they had the\ncancer literature in mind\nwhen they created those\nsupplements and products.\nI doubt they did.\nAlcohol really does\ndisrupt B vitamin pathways,\nboth synthesis pathways\nand utilization pathways.\nSo sometimes you'll hear, \"Oh, you know,\nif you get your B vitamins\nit helps you recover\nfrom hangover more quickly.\"\nAgain, the literature\ndoesn't support that.\nBut also, again, there\naren't a lot of studies.\nBut more to the point\nas it relates to alcohol\nand the formation of tumors and cancers,\nit does appear that decreased\nfolate and other B vitamins,\nlike B-12, are partially responsible\nfor the effect of alcohol\nand increasing cancer risk.\nAnd it does appear that\nconsuming adequate amounts\nof folate and B-12 might\nagain, might partially,\nI really want to bold face, and underline,\nand highlight partially offset\nsome of that increased risk.\n[upbeat music]"
