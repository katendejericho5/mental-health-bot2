    "transcript": "- Today it's really simple.\nNicotine only binds to the\nnicotinic acetylcholine receptors\nand there are a bunch of different ones\non a bunch of different tissues.\nAnd the differences in those receptors\ndictate what sorts of effects\nthe nicotine will have on those tissues.\nSo let's talk about\nwhat those effects are,\nand let's do that by dividing\nthe effects of nicotine\ninto effects on the brain.\nSo everything from the neck up.\nAnd on the body.\nThe so-called central nervous\nsystem and the periphery.\nAlthough I want to point\nout that your spinal cord\nis part of the central nervous system.\nSo in fairness to the reality,\nyour brain and spinal cord are\nall central nervous system,\neverything else is\nconsidered the periphery.\nNow, there are a lot of different\nnicotinic acetylcholine receptors,\nbut for those of you that\nwant to know, you aficionados,\nor if you're ultra curious about this,\nthe main effects of nicotine in the brain\nare mediated by nicotine binding to the\nso-called alpha4beta2 receptor.\nAlpha4beta2 receptor.\nEven if you don't care\nabout receptor subtypes,\nthat's going to come up\nlater when we discuss\nwhy nicotine suppresses appetite.\nIn fact, one of the major reasons\nwhy people don't want to quit smoking,\nor they quit smoking or another\nform of ingesting nicotine\nand then they relapse,\nthey go back to smoking\nor ingesting nicotine\nin some other way is because, indeed,\nnicotine will increase\nmetabolism and reduce hunger\nin large part by binding to\nthis alpha4beta2 receptor\nin a particular area of the brain.\nWe're going to return\nto that in a little bit.\nBut if you've ever heard\nthat nicotine kills the\nappetite, indeed it does.\nIt's not the behavior of smoking itself,\nit's not 'cause you always\nhave a cigarette in your mouth\nthat you're not eating more food,\nalthough I suppose that\nmight be a minor effect,\nthere are direct effects of\nnicotine on both appetite.\nThat is, it reduces appetite.\nAnd direct effects on metabolism.\nThat is, it increases metabolism\nthrough its effects on some other areas\nof the brain and body we'll\ntalk about in a moment.\nNow, within the brain,\nnicotine binds to this\nalpha4beta2 receptor,\nin various locations in the brain.\nAnd there are three and maybe a fourth\nthat we'll talk about\nneurochemical effects\nof nicotine after you ingest it.\nFirst things first, when you\ningest nicotine by smoking,\nnicotine containing tobacco,\nor if you place tobacco in contact\nwith the mucosal lining of the\nnasal passages or the mouth,\ntakes about 2 to 15 minutes\nfor that nicotine to\nenter the bloodstream.\nSmoking hits the bloodstream faster,\nvaping even faster I should mention,\nfor a variety of reasons.\nAnd placing tobacco directly in contact\nwith the mucosal lining is\ngoing to be the slowest.\nNow, as I mentioned before,\nnicotine gets into the\nbloodstream and then,\nbecause nicotine can pass through\nthe so-called blood\nbrain barrier, the BBB,\nwhich is basically a\nfence around the brain.\nBecause it can pass through\nthe blood brain barrier,\nit's going to have very\nrapid effects on the brain\nin these four major categories\nof neurochemicals and neural circuits.\nThe first of those categories,\nthis is a very important one.\nThis is one that was\nbrought up in the episode\non dopamine, motivation and drive.\nAnd I think, not just all scientists,\nbut all human beings should know\nthat within their brain\nthey have what is called\nthe mesolimbic reward pathway.\nThe mesolimbic reward pathway,\nif you just want to call it\nthe dopamine reward pathway,\nis as the name suggests\na set of connections\nbetween a brain area called\nthe ventral tegmental area.\nYou don't have to remember\nthe names of these things,\nof course, but if you\nwant to, that's fine too.\nThe ventral tegmental area, or VTA,\nconnects to another area\ncalled the nucleus acccumbens.\nNow, here's what's very important.\nNicotine triggers the release of dopamine\nfrom the nucleus accumbens.\nThis is what gives nicotine\nits rewarding properties.\nIt increases motivation,\nit tends to give a not so subtle\nbut very transient increase\nin feelings of wellbeing,\nand alertness and motivation.\nAnd that's because of\nthe increase in dopamine\ncaused by nicotine directly\nwithin the nucleus accumbens.\nNicotine also triggers the\nrelease of certain neurochemicals\nfrom the ventral tegmental area itself,\nand those impinge on nucleus accumbens\nand increase dopamine levels further.\nThis is what makes the\nrewarding properties,\nor sometimes referred to as\nthe reinforcing properties,\nof nicotine so powerful.\nThis is why so many billions of people\ningest nicotine in one form or another.\nIt's also why nicotine is so hard to quit,\nbecause there's a potent\nincrease in dopamine\nfrom multiple neural circuit pathways\nwithin this mesolimbic reward circuitry.\nNow, within the mesolimbic\nreward circuitry\nthere's an interesting feature.\nThere are accelerators that essentially\npush out more dopamine,\nget more dopamine released,\nand there are brakes of the\nso-called GABAergic variety.\nGABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter,\nyou don't need to know too much about\nto just understand that\nnicotine both increases dopamine\nbut also decreases the activity of GABA.\nAnd so this is like\npushing on the accelerator\nfor dopamine but also removing the brake.\nSo there's a two-pronged\neffect of nicotine\non reinforcement reward\ndopamine related pathways,\nthe feel good motivation pathways.\nAnd that is an increase in\ndopamine and a decrease in GABA.\nAnd again, that's all mediated through\nthis mesolimbic reward pathway involving\nthe ventral tegmental area\nand the nucleus accumbens.\nSo if you can conceptualize even just 5%\nof what I just told you,\nor even if you can just remember\nnicotine increases dopamine\nand that's why it feels so good,\nit makes you want more of it,\nyou will have everything\nyou need to know in mind\nin order to understand\nboth the why nicotine\nis so highly used and indeed abused,\nwhy it's so hard to quit.\nAnd that will point to avenues\nas to how to quit or reduce intake.\nAnd it also points to how nicotine\ncan actually be used in\nan antidepressant way\nshould you choose.\nAnd we will talk about what\nthe various criteria are\nfor choosing that.\nBut just understand nicotine\nincreases motivation,\nit decreases negative feelings of mood,\nit increases positive feelings\nof mood and motivation.\n[upbeat guitar strumming]"
