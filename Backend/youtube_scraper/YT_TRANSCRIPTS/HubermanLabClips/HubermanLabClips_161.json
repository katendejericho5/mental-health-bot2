    "transcript": "- Vaping is actually harder to quit\nthan cigarette smoking for most people.\nDoes that mean that cigarette smoking\nis fairly easy to quit for most people?\nNo, 70% of people who smoke cigarettes\nreport that they would like to quit\nif they thought they could.\nThe success rate of quitting smoking\nwhen people try to go just cold turkey,\njust quit with no assistance whatsoever,\nthey might tell their family and friends,\n\"Hey, I'm quitting, that's\nit,\" is exceedingly low.\nIt's 5%.\nSo 5% of the people that say,\n\"That's it, I'm not smoking\nagain despite cancer diagnosis.\nI'm not smoking again despite the fear\nof the negative health effects.\nI'm not going to ever smoke again\ndespite the financial\ncost, the health cost.\"\nI mean, I could list off\na huge number of things\nthat it does that are negative,\nbut you already know these\nor you've heard them.\nYou know, makes your skin worse.\nIt, as I mentioned, it lowers\nlibido. It disrupts hormones.\nIt disrupts vascular\nfunction, brain function.\nIt does all these terrible things\nand yet most people who\ntry and quit simply can't.\nAnd of the 5% that succeed in quitting,\na full 65% of them relapse within a year.\nSo that's a very depressing picture.\nBut it's not to say\nthat people cannot quit\nand in fact they can.\nThere are a couple of methods\nthat have been shown to help people quit.\nSome are behavioral and\nsome are pharmacologic.\nI just want to touch on\nthe behavioral ones first\nbecause it turns out that\nthere's a quite powerful method\nfor quitting nicotine ingestion\nby way of cigarette smoking\nwhich also carries over to vaping.\nThis is beautiful work that's\nbeen done by my colleague,\nin fact, close collaborator,\nalthough I was not\ninvolved in the research\nthat I'm about to describe, at Stanford,\nand his name is Dr. David Spiegel.\nHe is our associate chair of psychiatry.\nHe's been a guest on the\nHuberman Lab podcast.\nAnd he is a world expert,\nif not the world expert,\nin the clinical applications of hypnosis.\nNow, when I say hypnosis,\na lot of people think stage hypnosis,\nwhich is the hypnotist\ntrying to get people\nto do certain things\nand say certain things,\nnot necessarily against their will\nbecause they actually have to agree,\nbut the hypnotist is dictating\nwhat the person thinks, says, and does.\nClinical hypnosis is\nvastly different from that.\nClinical hypnosis is where\nthe person, the patient,\nactually directs their own brain changes\ntoward a specific emotional\nor behavioral goal.\nWork from Dr. David Spiegel's\nlaboratory done in 1993,\nbut that now has been\nrepeated many, many times,\nhas carried over into\nsome more modern studies\nand I will provide links to those studies\nin the show note caption so\nthat you can access them.\nThose studies have shown\nthat using a specific form of hypnosis,\npeople can achieve complete\nand total cessation\nof cigarette smoking,\nand there's no reason to believe\nthis doesn't also carry over to vaping,\nthrough one single hypnosis session.\nAnd the success rates are incredibly high\nwhen one considers that normally\nit would be only a 5% success rate.\nThe success rate with\nthis particular hypnosis\ndeveloped at Stanford School of Medicine\nby Dr. David Spiegel is 23%\nof people who do this hypnosis\none time succeed in quitting smoking.\nNow, in the old days, which\nactually wasn't that long ago,\nbefore the advent of smartphones\nand before the internet\ntook off to the extent that it has now,\nthis was done by having\nsomeone come into the clinic\nand Dr. Spiegel himself\nor one of his colleagues\nwould take somebody through the hypnosis.\nNowadays, you can access this hypnosis.\nThere's a wonderful app\nthat was developed by Dr.\nDavid Spiegel and others.\nIt's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.\nI've talked about this app a\nfew times on the podcast before\nbecause there are hypnosis\nscripts within the app\nfor enhancing sleep, for\nimproving ability to fall asleep\nif you wake up in the middle\nof the night, for focus,\nand a number of other behavioral\nand emotional changes.\nThere's also a function in the Reveri app\nfor smoking cessation,\nwhich exactly parallels\nthe sort of in laboratory\nand in clinic approaches\nthat Dr. Spiegel would use\nwere you to show up at his\nclinic or in his laboratory.\nAnd since that's not possible\nfor the large number of people out there,\nif you or somebody else\nis trying to quit smoking,\nor vaping, or dipping, or\nsnuffing for that matter,\nI strongly encourage you to\ncheck out the Reveri app.\nYou can find it easily\nby going to reveri.com.\nIt's available in various formats.\nSome of it is available free,\nsome of it is behind a paywall.\nBut given the tremendously\nnegative impact of smoking,\nvaping, dipping, and snuffing,\nthe hypnosis for smoking\ncessation that Reveri has seems,\nat least to me, as a very\npowerful and worthwhile resource.\nSo please check that\nout if you're somebody\nwho's trying to quit ingesting nicotine\nby any of the four methods\nthat I just described.\nNow, of course, there are other methods\nthat people have used to\nsuccessfully quit smoking,\nor vaping, or other forms\nof nicotine delivery.\nAnd there's actually an\nexcellent review on this topic.\nSo before diving into\na few of the specifics\nabout some of the pharmacology\nof using nicotine itself\nto quit smoking, or nicotine\nitself to quit vaping,\nor the use of various things,\neven SSRIs, antidepressants,\nto quit smoking or vaping,\nI just want to point\nyou to a review article\nthat if you'd like to\nget a complete survey\nof all the options that are available,\nthere's an excellent review on this.\nIt was published just a\ncouple of years ago in 2020.\nThe title of the article\nis \"Pharmacologic Approach\nto Smoking Cessation:\nAn Updated Review for\nDaily Clinical Practice.\"\nAnd even though this is mainly\nfocused on smoking cessation,\nit carries over quite nicely to vaping.\nAnd it details a number of statistics.\nYou know, the fact that every year\n700,000 or more people die\nbecause of smoking related diseases,\nso there again, you have\nthe negative health effects,\nthat younger people are smoking,\nthat women are smoking more nowadays,\nand that even though you see less smoking\ntypically in the US and Canada\nand even in Northern Europe,\nsome places there's still\nmany, many people are smoking\nwho would like to quit.\nBut that 75% of people, at\nleast according to this review,\nearlier I said 70%,\nbut estimates are as high as 75% of people\nwho try to quit smoking\nrelapse within the first week.\nThe first week. They\njust go right back to it.\nThat's how powerfully\nreinforcing the nicotine is.\nRemember, it's the\nnicotine in the cigarette\nthat's powerfully reinforcing,\nbut it's also the oral\nhabit, the motor habit.\nYou know, there is this thing\nabout density of sensory\nreceptors in the lips.\nPeople like bringing things to their lips.\nFood, cigarettes, other lips\nin some cases, et cetera.\nThere is a reinforcement\npathway related to that\nfor sort of obvious adaptive reasons.\nAnd as a consequence,\nthere is a reinforcement\nboth from the behavior\nand from the dopamine\nreleased from the nicotine itself.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nfrom the positive reinforcement\nthat comes from increased focus.\nSo the money that you make through work,\nor your attentional ability,\nor the fact that you're alert\nand people feel you present,\nall of that funnels back\ninto positive reinforcement,\nbehavioral reinforcement,\nand then what we would call addiction.\nSo this review covers all of\nthat and then steps beautifully\nthrough nicotine replacement\ntherapy and various compounds,\nseveral of which I'm\ngoing to talk about now,\nwhich have been shown\nto increase that number\nthat we talked about earlier\nof only 5% of people who try\nto quit with no other support,\npharmacologic, or hypnosis,\nor otherwise just say,\n\"That's it. I'm not going to smoke again,\"\nor, \"I'm not going to vape again.\"\nOnly 5% of people succeed in doing that.\nAnd even among those, many\nend up relapsing later,\nthere are a couple\npharmacologic approaches.\nOne of the main ones that's\nreceived a lot of attention\nin recent years is bupropion,\nsometimes referred to by its\ncommercial name Wellbutrin.\nNow, bupropion is a compound\nthat increases the release of dopamine,\nand to a lesser extent epinephrine\nand some other neurochemicals as well.\nIt's used for the treatment of depression\nand for smoking cessation.\nNow, I want to point out,\nagain, I'm not a psychiatrist,\nso I'm not telling you to take\nbupropion, AKA Wellbutrin,\nbut I'm going to give you a little bit\nof the contour of what's typically done\nin terms of bupropion administration\nto help people get relief\nfrom some of the withdrawal symptoms\nof trying to quit smoking, or vaping,\nor other forms of nicotine ingestion.\nTypically, bupropion is taken\nin 300 milligram per day doses\ndivided into two dosages\nof 150 milligrams each\nor sometimes there's a\nslow release formula.\nThe dosages will vary\nfrom person to person.\nWant to really emphasize\nthat there is an increased\nseizure risk with bupropion.\nIt only occurs in a small\nfraction of the population,\nbut nonetheless is a real concern\nfor those members of the population.\nSo for those of you with seizure risk,\nwhether you know it or not,\nthat's going to be a valid concern\nin terms of potential side effects.\nThe other thing about bupropion\nis that it has to be used with caution\nin patients that have liver\ndisease or renal disease.\nThat can impact the amount\nthat anyone can take.\nMeaning sometimes people have\nto take a much lower dose\nif they have renal\ndisease or liver disease,\nand sometimes they can't take it at all.\nSometimes if people are\ntaking benzodiazepines\nfor whatever reason or other sedatives,\nthere are contraindications there.\nSo bupropion isn't a, you\nknow, kind of one size fits all\nor magic bullet for quitting smoking.\nNonetheless, for people\nthat can take it safely,\nand again this is a prescription drug,\na board certified psychiatrist\nor other physician\nis going to have to prescribe it for you\nif it's appropriate for you,\nand it moves that number\nof 5% success rate\nto about what one sees\nwith the clinical hypnosis\nto about 20% of people\nwill successfully overcome their nicotine,\nor I should say, their\nsmoking or vaping addiction.\nNow, it's important to ask\nwhy this would work, right?\nI mean, it's not as if bupropion\nis increasing nicotine per se.\nWhat it's doing is it's tapping\non that mesolimbic reward\npathway increasing dopamine\nor at least allowing dopamine levels\nto stay substantially elevated enough\nthat people don't experience\nsome of the drop in dopamine\nthat leads to the withdrawal symptoms,\nthe lessening of mood, et cetera.\nAnd it's no coincidence that bupropion\nis also an antidepressant.\nIt's a common antidepressant for people\nthat experience negative side effects\nwith the so-called SSRIs,\nthe selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors,\nthat prevent them from\ntaking those things,\nlike lessen libido, or appetite,\nor in some cases increased appetite,\nor any number of other side\neffects that some people,\nnot all, but some people\nexperience with SSRIs,\nthey'll be prescribed Wellbutrin,\nbupropion is the generic name.\nSo Wellbutrin being the\ncommercial name, again,\nbupropion is what they'll\nbe prescribed instead\nwith the caveats of seizure\nrisk, renal disease,\nliver disease, et cetera.\nThe outcomes with Wellbutrin\nfor smoking cessation\nare pretty good.\nI mean, if you think about\nan increase from 5% to 20%,\nthat's pretty dramatic.\nAnd yet I also want to refer back\nto the incredible success of\nthe clinical hypnosis approach.\nAgain, you can find that at reveri.com.\nThe clinical hypnosis approach\nhas a success rate of 23%,\nso it's very closely aligned\nwith, if not exceeding,\nthe success rate with bupropion.\nOf course, there are other\npharmacologic approaches\nto quitting smoking or vaping.\nAll of them generally circle back\nto increasing dopamine\nand/or norepinephrine\nin order to offset some\nof the withdrawal symptoms\nof smoking cessation or vaping cessation.\nA very common approach for people\nto try and quit smoking or\nvaping is to use nicotine itself\nto try and prevent people\nfrom seeking nicotine\nthrough a cigarette or a vape pen.\nWhat I mean by that is people\nusing a nicotine patch,\nor nicotine gum, or other\nnicotine delivery device\nthat is not cigarettes and not\nvaping in order to maintain\nlevels of nicotine in their bloodstream,\nwhich of course means\nmaintain levels of nicotine\nin their brain and body,\nto the same extent that they would\nif they were smoking or vaping.\nMaybe even gradually taking down\nthe total amount of nicotine\nin their brain and body\nby reducing the number or\nsize of nicotine gum pieces\nthat they ingest each day,\nor keeping the patch on for\na shorter amount of time,\nor getting a lower dose patch\nthat releases less nicotine\ntotal or over time.\nAll of those approaches have been shown\nto be reasonably successful,\nget to the numbers in a few minutes,\nbut reasonably successful\nin allowing people\nto quit smoking or vaping.\nAgain, most of the data\nis on cigarette smoking\nbecause vaping is a\nrelatively new phenomenon,\nalthough quite troublingly\nit's a very rapidly increasing behavior,\nespecially in the young population.\nSo that's why I'm kind of\nlumping these two things together\nbecause I think very\nsoon we are going to need\nan all out campaign for how\nto counter vaping addiction.\nSo what do we know about smoking cessation\nusing nicotine itself?\nIs the patch best? Is nicotine gum best?\nTurns out that a combination\nof approaches is best.\nSo somewhat surprising,\nbut it is very clear from the literature\nthat I was able to find,\nthat using nicotine patches\nfor some period of time\nand then switching to a gum\nand then perhaps switching\nto a nasal spray,\nthat's going to be the most effective.\nThen the question is how long\nto continue each of those\nand whether or not to overlap them.\nIt seems as if doing one for about a week,\nand then switching to\nanother for about a week,\nand then switching to another\nis one rationable and reasonable approach\nthat many people have used successfully.\nWhy would that be?\nWell, it all has to do\nwith the different rates\nof absorption of nicotine\ninto the bloodstream\nand then the downstream\nconsequences of that\non the dopamine,\nacetylcholine, epinephrine,\nand other systems of the brain and body.\nAnd while there hasn't been\nan extremely detailed study\nof the exact kinetics of, you\nknow, how the nasal sprays,\nversus the transdermal\npatches, versus the gums,\net cetera, work, there's\na logical structure to it\nthat will immediately make sense to you.\nFirst of all, the transdermal patches\nprovide a fairly steady\nstate dopamine release\nacross the day and oftentimes\npeople are wearing them at night as well.\nThis is relevant because if\npeople are ingesting nicotine\nby way of smoking and vaping, you know,\nhopefully they're not waking\nup in the middle of the night\njust to smoke or vape,\nor believe it or not, some people do that,\nbut of course, while people are asleep\nthey are not smoking or vaping.\nThey always tell you don't fall asleep\nwith a cigarette in your mouth.\nYou'd burn the whole house down.\nBut exceedingly rare to have people\nwho are smoking in their sleep.\nSo people wake up in the morning\nand because the half-life of nicotine\nfrom smoking or vaping is very short,\nanywhere from one to two hours,\nthey're essentially in\na state of withdrawal\nat the point where they\nwake up in the morning.\nHow can I say that?\nWell, remember, withdrawal\nsets in about four hours\nafter the last ingestion\nof nicotine by cigarette\nor by inhalation from a vape pen.\nSo people are waking up\nin nicotine withdrawal\nand then immediately\ngoing into the behavior\nof ingesting nicotine\nor very soon after waking for most people.\nSo nicotine patch is\ngoing to be very effective\nfor a week or so.\nAgain, talk to your physician\nabout the best approach for this.\nBut then switching to a nasal spray\nor switching to nicotine\ngum for about a week,\nwhich is going to change the kinetics\nof that nicotine absorption\ninto the bloodstream\nand change the release of dopamine\nand other neurochemicals within the brain.\nThat's going to keep the system\nintentionally off balance\nso that it never comes to\nexpect one single pattern\nor amplitude of dopamine release.\nAnd that is a very powerful way for a,\nlet's just call it a\nquitting method, to work\nbecause as I've always said,\nthe most powerful schedule of dopamine\nis going to be this random\nintermittent reward.\nThis is what's used in the casinos\nin order to take your money,\nand generally they do.\nOn average, they take your\nmoney more than you take theirs,\nand they take more of\nit, not just more often,\nbecause they use this random\nintermittent schedule.\nThe random intermittent schedule\nis one in which you don't really know\nwhen the peaks in dopamine\nare going to arrive\nand so there isn't this\nexpectation in craving,\nand then all of a sudden\nwhen dopamine is released\nit's extremely high.\nThat's how they get\nyou to continue playing\neven though basically you're losing money\nand your dopamine is dropping.\nThey elevate it every once in a while.\nNicotine replacement can\nbe used in a similar way,\nbut in a benevolent way\nin order to help you\nget over smoking or vaping\nby keeping the total\namounts of dopamine variable\naround the clock.\nAnd by changing the amount\nof dopamine that's released,\nit seems to help people\nbehaviorally and psychologically\nbecause they don't come to expect\nhaving a particular amount of dopamine\nin their brain and\nblood at any given time.\n[upbeat music]"
