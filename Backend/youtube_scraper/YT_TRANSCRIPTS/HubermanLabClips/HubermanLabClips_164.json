    "transcript": "- Your ability to focus, and in fact,\nyour ability of neurons to\nencode specific information\nin your environment, that is,\nto represent what's\nout there in the world,\nis actually related to\nyour blood glucose level.\nNow, here, I'm setting aside\nthe discussion of ketosis\nand and ketogenic diets for the moment.\nBut there's a beautiful\nstudy that was published\nin Neuron not long ago that\nshowed that the tuning,\nthat is, the precision with\nwhich neurons in the brain\nwill represent things in our environment\nis actually much greater when there is\nsufficient glucose in the brain.\nTranslated into English, this\nmeans that when we are fasted\nor when our blood glucose\nis very low, we aren't able\nto perceive and think\nabout things as clearly.\nNow, there's a twist to this, however.\nMany people who practice\nintermittent fasting,\nand I should say, I practice a sort of\npseudo-intermittent fasting,\nI generally eat my meals\nbetween the hours of 11:00 AM and 8:00 PM,\nalthough sometimes there's\nsome wiggle around that,\noccasionally have an early breakfast,\nI'm not super rigid about it,\nbut I know there are a number\nof people who are doing longer fasts,\nso they're eating in a six hour window.\nWe did an entire episode about fasting.\nYou can, again, find\nthat at hubermanlab.com,\nwe'll likely have Satchin Panda,\nwho's an expert in intermittent\nfasting, on the podcast.\nIntermittent fasting\nhas a lot of different\npotential benefits.\nFor some people, it's a convenient way\nto restrict their\ncalories, for other people,\nit's a convenient way to\navoid eating, that is,\nit's easier to not eat than\nto eat a small portion,\nso they opt for intermittent\nfasting and so on and so forth.\nBut one of the things\nthat you hear very often\nis that some people like being fasted\nbecause they like the clarity\nof mind that it provides.\nHere's the situation.\nNeurons, unless you're\nin a ketogenic diet,\nreally thrive on glucose.\nThey love glucose.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nyour ability to think\nand perceive things is actually enhanced\nby having sufficient\nglucose in your bloodstream.\nSo why would it be that\nsome people experience\na heightened state of mental\nclarity when they are fasted?\nI've certainly experienced that before.\nWell, I should say that, provided you're\nwell hydrated enough and\nyou have enough electrolytes\nin your system, what tends\nto happen is that when you\ningest food, there's a\nshift in your nervous system\ntowards so-called parasympathetic mode.\nThat is, the more relaxed,\nyou probably heard it\nas rest and digest, although\nit does other things,\na more relaxed mode that can\nindeed make us very sleepy.\nIf we have too many carbohydrates,\nthat actually can make us quite sleepy.\nHowever, if we have any food,\nif we have enough of it,\nthat is, if our gut is full,\nit diverts blood to our gut\nand we become sleepy and\nwe can't focus as well.\nSo a lot of people really\nlike fasting and the state\nof being fasted for\nfocus and concentration,\nbecause they don't have as\nmuch of that parasympathetic\nactivation, they're just not as sleepy.\nAnd in fact, under those conditions,\nhalf as much caffeine will\ngive you just as much lift\nas twice as much caffeine will give you\non a full belly of pasta,\nand that's just the way\nthat caffeine interacts\nwith blood glucose.\nSo what I'd like you to\nimagine is if you had a measure\nof focus from zero to 10,\nthese are arbitrary units,\n10 being maximally focused\nand zero being not focused at all,\nimagine a U shaped function, right?\nWhere if you're very\nfasted, you're going to have\na high degree of focus and concentration,\nbut then if you ingest some\nfood and your belly is full,\nyour focus and concentration is reduced.\nBut having enough blood\nglucose and maybe even\nelevated blood glucose will\nincrease cognitive function.\nSo there are two ends of the spectrum.\nOn one end of the spectrum,\nblood glucose is relatively\nlow and you're fasted\nand you can think and behave\nin a very concentrated way.\nAnd on the other end of the\nspectrum, you have a lot\nof blood glucose, or I should\nsay, sufficient blood glucose.\nYou never want your blood\nglucose to be too high.\nAnd that allows your neurons\nto encode and perceive\nand basically allow you\nto think really clearly.\nSo you sort of have to\npick your condition.\nWhat do you want for your bouts\nof focus in concentration?\nI actually do both.\nSo what I do is, as I mentioned before,\nI eat my meals some time\naround 11:00 AM, my first meal,\ntypically, unless I'm very\nhungry when I wake up.\nAnd so I will do my workout\nand one about of focused work.\nI always think of this as my\nhard work early in the day,\nand I do that fasted.\nI'll be consuming water with\nelectrolytes, maybe LMNT\nor other electrolytes,\nmaybe some caffeine as well,\nin the form of yerba mate or coffee.\nThat's my first focus about\nof 90 minutes or less.\nThat is essentially done fasted.\nAnd then I'll eat, and then\nI do notice after I eat,\nI actually have a diminished\ncapacity to focus.\nBut then again in the afternoon,\nI will do another 90\nminute about of focus,\nand I'll talk about some of\nthe tools I use to make sure\nthat that about of focus is optimal\nfor getting the most amount\nof focused work done,\nwhether or not it's mental\nwork or physical work,\nalthough I tend to do my\nphysical work early in the day\nand my mental work both\nearly and late in the day.\nSo to make this very simple,\nor as simple as I can for\nyou, being fasted is great\nfor focus and concentration,\nprovided you're not thinking\nabout food the entire time,\nand being fed is terrific\nfor focus and concentration,\nactually can improve neuronal function,\nprovided that you didn't\neat too much food.\nSo one way to manage this\nis, if you're going to\nhave a lunch, to make sure\nthat you don't stuff yourself\nat lunch, that you're not\novereating and to not get quite\nso full that you push your\nnervous system into this\nparasympathetic mode and\nmake it hard to focus\nin the afternoon.\nI know a lot of people experience a dip\nor even a crash in energy in the afternoon\nthat make it really hard to focus.\nFor that reason, I'll just\nremind people of a tool\nI've talked about many\ntimes before, which is based\non the biology of adenosine\nand caffeine, et cetera,\nwhich is to delay your\nfirst caffeine intake\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.\nI know that can be painful\nfor certain people.\nI violate that rule when\nI'm working out very early\nin the morning, I'll drink my\ncaffeine before my workout,\nwhich often occurs within, you know,\n30 to 60 minutes of waking.\nBut in general, unless I'm\nworking out very early,\nI will ingest my caffeine 90\nto 120 minutes after I wake up.\nSo again, I want to emphasize\nthat if you hear somebody\nout there say being fasted\nis optimal for focus\nand concentration, well,\nthat is true in one context,\nand perhaps ideal for a\ncertain part of the day,\nand other people will say, no, you know,\nneurons run on glucose, you\nneed glucose in your bloodstream\nin order to get get those\nneurons to be tuned.\nThat is, to respond\nwith electrical activity\nin the optimal way when\nyou're reading something,\nor when you're trying to perform exercise.\nWell, that's also true.\nAnd of course, you can incorporate both.\nI, in fact, as I just\ndescribed, incorporate both\nfasted states and fed\nstates in order to optimize\nmy concentration and focus.\n[upbeat music]"
