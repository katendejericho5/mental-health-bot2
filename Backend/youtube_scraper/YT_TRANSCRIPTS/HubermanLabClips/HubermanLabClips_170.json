    "transcript": "- There are actually people\nwho have so little alcohol dehydrogenase\nthat when they ingest alcohol,\nthey get very red and they just feel sick.\nSo if you're somebody\nthat has a sip of alcohol\nand you just feel horrible,\nit makes you feel nauseous,\nchances are you have gene\nvariants that create a situation\nwhere you're not making very\nmuch alcohol dehydrogenase,\nyou just simply can't metabolize alcohol,\nso you just get a rapid buildup\nof the toxic effects of\nalcohol, the acetaldehyde,\nyou're not converting it\ninto those empty calories.\nIn cultures where you have\na lot of genetic variance\nand genes expressed in people,\nwhere they have a lot of\nalcohol dehydrogenase,\nsure, they can drink more\nand they're converting\nmore of that alcohol\nfrom its toxic form to a non-toxic form,\nand yes, of course, you\nwill observe more alcoholism\nin those communities, because\nthey're drinking more,\nbut I do want to emphasize\nthat the environmental factors\nare playing a strong role there too,\nbecause if you can drink more,\nyou're likely to drink more,\nif you're somebody that\nfeels sick immediately\nfrom drinking, it's likely\nthat you're not going to engage\nin alcohol consumption,\nespecially if these things\nare genetically related,\nand of course, genes\nand culture and location\nand the world tend to run together."
