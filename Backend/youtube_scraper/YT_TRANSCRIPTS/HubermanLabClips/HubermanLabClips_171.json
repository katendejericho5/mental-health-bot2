    "transcript": "- Because of the structure of alcohol,\nit is what's called both\nwater-soluble and fat-soluble.\nTranslated into what's meaningful for you,\nwhat that means is when you drink alcohol,\nit can pass into all the cells\nand tissues of your body.\nIt has no trouble just passing\nright into those cells.\nSo unlike a lot of substances and drugs\nthat actually attach to\nthe surface of cells,\nto receptors, as they're\ncalled, little parking spots,\nand then trigger a bunch of downstreams,\nlike domino cascades of effects,\nalcohol actually has its\nown direct effects on cells\nbecause it can really just\npass into those cells.\nSo it's water- and fat-soluble,\nand the fact that it can pass\ninto so many organs and cells so easily\nis really what explains\nits damaging effects.\nI should mention that there are\nthree main types of alcohol.\nThere's isopropyl,\nmethyl, and ethyl alcohol,\nand only the last one,\nethyl alcohol or ethanol,\nis fit for human consumption.\nHowever, it is still toxic, okay?\nIt produces substantial\nstress and damage to cells.\nI'd love to be able to tell you otherwise,\nbut that's just a fact.\nEthanol produces\nsubstantial damage to cells.\nAnd it does that because\nwhen you ingest ethanol,\nit has to be converted into something else\nbecause it is toxic to the body.\nAnd there's a molecule inside\nof all of us called NAD.\nAnd you may have heard of NAD\nbecause it's quite popular,\nthere's a lot of discussion about NAD\nin the longevity literature right now.\nNAD is present in all our\ncells from birth until death.\nThe levels of NAD tend to\ngo down across the lifespan.\nThere are ideas that\nincreasing levels of NAD\nmay extend lifespan.\nA lot of that is still controversial,\nor at least we should say is ongoing,\nin terms of the research.\nBut nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol,\nNAD and related biochemical pathways\nare involved in converting that ethanol\ninto something called acetaldehyde.\nIt's broken down into acetaldehyde.\nAnd if you thought ethanol was bad,\nacetaldehyde is particularly bad.\nAcetaldehyde is poison.\nIt will kill cells.\nIt damages and kill cells,\nand it is indiscriminate\nas to which cells it damages and kills.\nNow, that's a problem, obviously,\nand the body deals with that problem\nby using another component of\nthe NAD biochemical pathway\nto convert acetaldehyde into\nsomething called acetate.\nAcetate is actually something\nthat your body can use as fuel.\nAnd that process of going from ethanol\nto acetaldehyde to acetate\ndoes involve the production of\na toxic molecule, all right?\nAgain, acetaldehyde is really toxic.\nAnd NAD, and if we want to get technical,\nit's the NAD-to-NADH ratio,\nand that chemical step\nis the rate-limiting step\nto ethanol's metabolism.\nWhat does that mean for you?\nWhat that means is that if your body\ncan't do this conversion of ethanol\nto acetaldehyde to acetate fast enough,\nwell, acetaldehyde will\nbuild up in your body\nand cause more damage.\nSo it's important that your body\nbe able to do this\nconversion very quickly,\nand the place where it does\nthat is within the liver.\nAnd cells within the liver are very good\nat this conversion process,\nbut they are cells,\nand they are exposed to the acetaldehyde\nin the conversion process,\nand so cells within the\nliver really take a beating\nin the alcohol metabolism events.\nSo the key thing to understand here\nis that when you ingest alcohol,\nyou are, yes, ingesting a poison,\nand that poison is converted\ninto an even worse poison in your body,\nand some percentage of that worse poison\nis converted into a form of calories\nthat you can use to generate\nenergy, generate ATP.\nAnd the reason why alcohol\nis considered empty calories\nis because that entire process\nis very metabolically costly,\nbut there's no real nutritive value\nof the calories that it creates.\nYou can use it for immediate energy,\nbut it can't be stored\nin any kind of meaningful\nor beneficial way.\nIt doesn't provide any vitamins,\nit doesn't provide any amino acids,\nit doesn't provide any fatty acids,\nit's truly empty calories.\nI know some people talk about\nsugar is empty calories,\nbut sugar actually is a\nfar better fuel source\nthan alcohol or acetate.\nBut nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol,\nsome percentage is being\nshuttled into a worse poison\nand some is being shuttled\ninto a fuel source.\nNow, the important thing to understand\nis that it is the poison,\nthe acetaldehyde itself,\nthat leads to the effect of\nbeing inebriated or drunk.\nI think most people don't realize that,\nthat being drunk is actually\na poison-induced disruption\nin the way that your neural circuits work.\nAnd so we should ask ourselves,\nlike, which neural circuits,\nwhat brain areas, what\nbody areas are involved\nin feeling drunk or inebriated?\nIn thinking about the\nbiochemical effects of alcohol\nand what it's doing to the body,\nwhat it's doing in all cases\nis it's consumed into the gut, right?\nGoes into the stomach,\nthe liver immediately\nstarts this conversion\nthat we talked about before\nof ethanol to acetaldehyde to acetate,\nand some amount of\nacetaldehyde and acetate\nare making it into the brain.\nIt crosses the blood-brain barrier.\nAgain, the brain has this fence around it\nthat we call the blood-brain\nbarrier or the BBB.\nMany things, most things, thankfully,\ncan't pass across the blood-brain barrier,\nbut alcohol, because it's\nwater- and fat-soluble,\njust cruises right across this fence\nand into the milieu, the\nenvironment of the brain,\nwhich is made up of a couple\ndifferent major cell types,\nneurons, nerve cells, and\nso-called glial cells,\nwhich are in between the nerve cells.\nAnd we'll talk about the\neffects on each of those soon.\nSo what happens when\nalcohol gets into the brain\nthat makes us feel tipsy or\ndrunk, and, in some people,\nmakes people feel really\nespecially energized and happy?\nWell, alcohol is indiscriminate\nin terms of which brain areas it goes to.\nAgain, it doesn't bind\nto particular receptors,\nbut it does seem to have a\npropensity or an affinity\nfor particular brain areas\nthat are involved in certain\nkinds of thinking and behavior.\nSo one of the first things that happens\nis that there's a slight,\nat least after the first\ndrink or second drink,\nthere's a slight suppression\nin the activity of neurons\nin the prefrontal cortex.\nThis is an area of your neocortex\nthat's involved in thinking and planning\nand, perhaps above all,\nin suppression of impulsive behavior.\nSo if you go to a party\nand they're serving alcohol\nand people are consuming drinks,\nwhat you'll notice is that a\nfew minutes into that party,\nthe volume of people's\nvoices will increase.\nAnd that's because people are\nsimply not paying attention\nto their voice modulation,\nand as other people start\nspeaking more loudly,\nother people are speaking more loudly.\nWe've all had this experience, right,\nof going to a party and then\nyou step outside for a moment,\nand you go, \"Oh, my\ngoodness. I was shouting.\"\nYou come home the next day,\nyou've got a sore throat.\nIt might be that you\npicked up some sort of bug,\nsome virus or something,\nbut oftentimes it's just the fact\nthat you've been shouting\nall night just to be heard\nbecause as the prefrontal\ncortex shuts down,\npeople stop modulating their\nlevel of speech quite as much.\nYou also notice that people\nstart gesticulating more,\npeople will start standing\nup and sitting down more,\nthey'll start walking around more.\nIf there's music on,\npeople might spontaneously start dancing.\nAll of this is because these\nareas of the prefrontal cortex\nnormally are providing what's\ncalled top-down inhibition.\nThey are releasing a\nneurotransmitter called GABA\nonto various parts of the\nbrain that are involved\nin impulsive motor behavior\nand thought patterns,\nand as you shut down\nthe prefrontal cortex,\nthat GABAergic suppression of impulses\nstarts to be released.\nSo people will say things\nthat they want to say\nwithout so much forethought\nabout what they're saying,\nor they might do things\nthat they want to do\nwithout really thinking\nit through quite as much,\nor they might not even remember\nthinking it through it all,\nor experience, I should say,\nthinking it through it all.\nWe haven't talked about blacking out yet\nand the effects of alcohol on memory.\nBut as long as we're there,\nI'll just tell you that alcohol\nhas a very strong effect\nin suppressing the neural networks\nthat are involved in memory\nformation and storage.\nThis is why oftentimes we\nforget the events of a night out\nif we've been drinking.\nOne of the more important things to know\nabout the effects of alcohol on the brain\nis this disruption in top-down inhibition,\nbut, also, that areas of the brain\nthat are involved in flexible behavior,\nsort of considering different options,\nlike I could do A or I could do B,\nI could say this to them\nor I could say that,\nI could say it in that way or\nI could say it in this way,\nthis might be a little more tactful.\nThose brain areas basically\nshut down entirely,\nand people just tend to\nsay what they want to say.\nSo the key thing to understand\nis that when people drink,\nthe prefrontal cortex and\ntop-down inhibition is diminished.\nThat is, habitual behavior\nand impulsive behavior starts to increase.\nNow, what's interesting is\nthis is true in the short term,\nso after people have one or\ntwo, maybe three or four drinks,\nbut it's also true that the\nmore often that people drink,\nthere are changes in the very circuits\nthat underlie habitual\nand impulsive behavior.\n[upbeat music]"
