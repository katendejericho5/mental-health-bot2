    "transcript": "- Would love to talk a little bit\nabout hormone replacement therapy in men.\nWhen one looks on social\nmedia and the internet,\nthere seems to be a\nyounger and younger cohort\nof guys or people in\ntheir teens and twenties\nshowing up to the table\nthinking that injecting\ntestosterone cypionate\nor taking Anavar, or whatever it is,\nis going to be the right idea.\nThey mainly seem to be\nfocused on cosmetic effects.\nI'm not a physician,\nso I can't say whether or not\nthey were actually hypogonadal, et cetera.\nBut it seems to me, and\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\nbut it seems to me\nthat similar to the Attia's\nRule as it relates to longevity,\nthat we could come up\nwith a broad contour rule\nin which if a male of any age\nis not trying to get decent\nsleep, exercise appropriately,\nappropriate nutrition, minding\ntheir social connections,\net cetera, et cetera,\nthe idea of going straight to testosterone\nseems like a bad idea.\nThat said, just like with\ndepression and antidepressants,\nthere is a kind of a cliff after which\nlow enough testosterone\nor low enough serotonin\nprevents people from sleeping,\nexercise, social connection, et cetera.\nSo I do want to acknowledge that.\nBut with that in mind,\nhow do you think about,\nand perhaps occasionally\nprescribe and direct your patients\nin terms of hormone\nreplacement therapy in men,\nperson in their 30s, person in their 40s,\nwho's doing almost all the\nother things correctly?\nWhat sorts of levels do\nyou think are meaningful?\nBecause the range is tremendous\nin terms of blood tests.\n300 nanograms per deciliter,\nI think on the low end now in the U.S.,\nall the way up to 900 to 1,200.\nThat's an enormous range.\nWhat are some of the other\nhormones you like to look at?\nEstrogen, DHT, and so on?\n- So, a lot to unpack there.\nSo, let's start with the ranges, right?\nSo, the ranges you gave\nare for total testosterone, of course.\nAnd we don't spend a lot of time\nlooking at that the way we...\nI used to spend more time\nlooking at total and free\nwhen I used more tricks to modulate it.\nSo I'm actually far more simple\nin my manipulation of testosterone today\nthan I was six or seven years ago.\nSix or seven years ago,\nI mean, we would use a microdose\nof Anavar to lower SHBG\nin a person who had normal testosterone\nbut low free testosterone.\n- What was a lose dose of\nAnavar in that context?\n- 10 milligrams subling\ntwo to three times a week.\n- Anavar basically being DHT?\nOxandrolone-\n- Oxandrolone, yeah, exactly.\n- And again, we're not recommending this.\nThis, actually, if you're\nplaying a competitive sport\ncan get you banned from that sport.\n- No, no, yeah, yeah.\n- It can also get you\nbanned from having children\nif you do it incorrectly.\n- Yeah.\nSo a microdose of this\nhas to be small enough\nthat it doesn't impair your body's ability\nto make testosterone,\nbut Anavar has such a\nhigh affinity for SHBG\nthat it basically distract your SHBG\nfrom binding your testosterone.\n- Freeing up testosterone.\n- That's exactly right.\nSo the goal was,\nhow do I just give you\nmore free testosterone?\nSo if a patient shows up\nand they've got a total testosterone\nof 900 nanograms per deciliter,\nwhich would place them at,\ndepending on the scale you look at...\nThe scale we look at,\nthat would place you at\nabout the 70th percentile.\nBut your free testosterone is\neight nanograms per deciliter.\nSo that's pretty bad.\nThat means you're less\nthan one percent free.\nA guy should be about 2% free T.\nSo that dude should be closer\nto 16 to 18 nanograms per deciliter.\nSo in that situation that I just gave you,\nhis SHBG is really high.\nHis SHBG is probably\nin the 80 to 90 range.\n- That's very high.\n- Yeah.\n- 'Cause I think the upper range\nis somewhere around 55, 56.\n- Exactly.\n- Yeah.\n- So, we would first backstall\nfor what's driving his SHBG.\nSo there's basically three hormones.\nSo, genetics plays a huge role in this.\nThere's no question that\njust out of the box,\npeople have a different\nset point for SHBG.\nMine is incredibly low.\nMy SHBG is kind of in 30s, 20s to 30s.\nBut from a hormone perspective,\nthere's basically three\nhormones that run it.\nSo estradiol being probably\nthe most important,\ninsulin, and thyroxine.\nSo we're going to look at all of those\nand decide if any of\nthose are playing a role.\nSo insulin suppresses it.\nSo this is actually the great irony\nof helping a person get\nmetabolically healthy,\nis in the short run you can actually lower\ntheir free testosterone all things equal,\nbecause as insulin comes\ndown, SHBG goes up,\nand if testosterone\nhasn't gone up with it,\nyou're lowering free testosterone.\n- So somebody who goes on a\nvery low carbohydrate diet\nin attempt to drop some\nwater and drop some weight\nis going to increase their SHBG-\n- [Peter] Yeah, if their\ninsulin goes down enough-\n- Bind up testosterone,\nless free testosterone.\nI can tell the carnivore diet people\nare going to be coming after me\nwith bone marrow in hand.\nBut then again,\nafter this discussion\nextends a little further,\nI'm sure the vegans\nwill be coming after me\nwith celery stalks, so it's-\n- So then the same as with estradiol,\nexcept in the opposite direction.\nSo higher estradiol is higher SHBG.\nSo again, occasionally you'll see a guy\nwith a normal testosterone\nbut he's a very high\naromatase activity person.\nSo he has a lot of the enzyme\nthat converts testosterone into estradiol.\nYou could lower estradiol a bit\nwith an aromatase inhibitor,\nand that can bring down SHBG.\nNow again, these things individually\nare rarely enough to move the needle.\nThe last is thyroxine.\nSo if you have a person whose\nthyroid is out of whack,\nyou have to fix that before you...\nIf their T4 is out of whack,\nyou're going to interfere with SHBG.\nThere are also some supplements,\nwhich I think you've probably\ntalked about these on the podcast.\nI feel like I've heard you talk\nabout these on the podcast.\n- Yeah, there are a few that will adjust.\nYou know, there's this idea...\nNow there's a much better\nreview that just came out.\nI'll send it to you.\nI'd love your thoughts on it.\nAnd I've been perusing it line by line,\nbut I'd love input from experts like you,\non the use of tongkat\nali for reducing SHBG.\nIn my experience, it does\nfree up some testosterone.\nBy which mechanism, it\nisn't exactly clear.\nAnd the effects aren't\nthat dramatic, right?\nThere're probably multiple effects.\nFor all we know, it increases libido,\nand it does generally,\nby way of increasing estrogen slightly,\nwhich can also increase\nlibido in some individuals.\nSo we don't know the exact mode of action.\nSo we've talked about a few.\nThe one that a few years back\npeople were claiming could reduce SHBG\nwas stinging nettle.\n- Stinging nettle, yeah.\n- Stinging nettle, well, I'll just...\nUrinating seems to be coming up\nmultiple times on this\npodcast for whatever reason.\nStinging nettle extract, I took.\nThe most pronounced effect of that\nwas you could basically urinate\nover a car when taking SHBG.\nWhat the underlying mechanism\nof that was, I do not know.\nI took it for a short while.\nIt didn't drop my SHBG very much.\nBut it did drop my DHT sufficiently\nso that I stopped taking it.\n- You felt that, yeah.\n- I do not like anything that impedes DHT.\nI don't care if my hairline retreats,\nI don't care about any of that.\nDHT, to me, is something to be coveted\nand held onto because\nyou feel so much better\nwhen your DHT is in the appropriate range.\nAnd I'd love your thoughts\non that at some point, too.\n- Yeah, again, it really\ndepends on the guy.\nAnd it depends on what risk\nyou're trying to manage, right?\nSo prostate size starts to become\none of the issues with DHT.\n- Luckily, the prostate\nspecific antigen is low.\nAnd DHT, the things that\nI know can reduce it\nare things like finasteride,\nPropecia, things like-\n- Dutasteride.\n- Right.\nThings that people take\nto try and avoid hair loss\ncan dramatically reduce DHT\nand lead to all sorts of\nterrible sexual side effects,\nmood-based side effects, et cetera.\nBut yeah, so I'm not aware of anything\nthat can be taken in supplement form\nthat can really profoundly drop SHBG.\n- Yeah, we don't spend much\nattention on it anymore.\nBasically, I used to have\na much more complicated\ndifferential diagnosis eight years ago.\nI mean, I would drive patients nuts\nwith the whiteboard diagrams\nI would draw for them,\nwhen in the end I think\nthey were just like,\n\"Dude, just what do I need to take?\"\nToday we take a much more simple approach.\nSo the first question is,\nshould you or should you have\nyour free testosterone being higher?\nThat's the metric I care about,\nis free testosterone is\nthe first most important,\nthe second most important is estradiol.\n- And sorry to interrupt, but you said,\n\"If you look at your total testosterone,\nyou want the free T to be\nabout 2% of your total-\"\n- Well, it should be, right?\n- And somewhere-\n- I might not change that anymore.\nSo in other words, if a guy's at 1%,\nthen I know I have to really\nboost his total testosterone.\nIf he's only going to get 1 to\n1 1/2% of it converted to free,\nI need to boost him.\nAnd that's why I don't care\nif he's outside the range.\nI'll have a guy whose free T...\nI might have to get a\nguy's total T up to 1,500\nto get his free T to 18.\n- I see.\nSo free T is the target.\n- Free T is what we treat.\n- I like this approach.\nAnd do you still use Anavar-\n- I don't use Anavar.\n- Oxandrolone, sorry,\nto try and lower SHBG?\n- I don't, no.\n- Because it's too potent?\n- No, because it's just too\ncomplicated for patients.\nYou know, it's a drug that\ncan't be taken orally,\nso you have to take it under the tongue-\n- Like a troche or something?\n- Right.\nBut then I had one patient once who,\neven though we told him\nabout 87 times that,\nhe was swallowing the Anavars\nand his liver function...\nAnd we're talking 10\nmilligrams three times a week\nis a tiny dose,\nand three months of him, or whatever,\ntwo months of him\nswallowing that every time\ntripled his liver function test.\nSo it's like...\nI was like, you know what?\nIt's just not worth the hassle\nof doing this for perfection.\nIn reality, we can fix this another way.\nSo the first order question is,\ndo we believe clinically you will benefit\nfrom normalizing your free testosterone,\nor taking it to a level,\nlet's call it 80th to 90th percentile?\nSo upper normal limit\nof physiologic ranges.\nThat's the first order question.\nAnd that's going to come down to symptoms,\nand that's going to come\ndown to some biomarkers.\nI think there's, two years ago...\nWas it two years ago, or maybe a year ago,\nvery good study came out that\nlooked at pre-diabetic men,\nyou've probably talked about this study,\nand looking at insulin\nresistance and glucose disposal\nwith and without testosterone.\nAnd the evidence was overwhelmingly clear.\nTestosterone improves glycemic control.\nTestosterone improves insulin signaling.\nThis shouldn't be surprising, by the way,\ngiven the role muscles\nplay as a glucose reservoir\nand a glucose sink.\nSo now I include that as one of the things\nthat we will consider as a\nfactor for using testosterone.\nNow again, it's not the only one.\nSo you can accomplish that with exercise,\nyou can accomplish that\nwith these other things,\nbut then you get into a little\nbit of the vicious cycle\nof will having a normalized testosterone\nfacilitate you doing those things better?\nSo let's just assume\nwe come to the decision\nthat this person is a good candidate\nfor testosterone replacement therapy.\nThe next question is,\nwhat's the method we're going to do it?\nAre we going to do it\nindirectly or directly?\nNow, we used to use a lot\nof Clomid in our practice.\nHave you talked about\nClomid on the podcast?\n- Haven't talked too much about it.\nNo, we talked a little bit about the fact\nthat some people taking\nthings like anastrozole\nto reduce aromatase activity\ncan potentially run into trouble\nbecause they think,\noh, well more testosterone\ngood, lower estrogen bad,\nand then they end up with\nissues like joint pain,\nmemory issues, and severe drops in libido.\nAnd I think a lot of the reason why-\n- And even fat accumulation.\nSo if estrogen is too low,\nyou can develop adiposity\nin a way that you wouldn't otherwise.\nThere's a great New England Journal paper,\nit's probably 10 years\nold now, that looked at,\nI believe it was five different doses\nof testosterone cypionate.\nSo these men were chemically castrated\nand divided into 10 groups.\nIt's pretty remarkable-\n- [Andrew] Somebody\nsigned up for this study.\n- Yeah.\nSo you were with and without anastrozole,\nand five doses of testosterone.\nSo now you basically had\nfive testosterone levels\nplus or minus high or low estradiol.\nAnd the results were really clear,\nthat the higher your testosterone\nand the more your estradiol\nwas in kind of that 30 to 50\nrange, the better you were.\nSo if estrogen was too low,\neven in the presence of high testosterone,\nthe outcomes were less significant.\n- And this is 30 to 50\nnanograms per deciliter,\nnot 30 to 50% of one's testosterone.\nOkay, great.\n- Okay, so-\n- But no, we haven't talked...\nBut Clomid, we have not\ntalked a lot about Clomid.\nI'd love to get your thoughts on Clomid.\n- So clomiphene is a fertility drug.\nIt's a synthetic hormone.\nIt's actually two drugs, M clomiphene,\nand I forget the other one.\nAnd it tells the pituitary\nto secrete FSH and LH.\nAnd the advantage of Clomid is it's oral,\nand it's meant to be taken orally.\nSo a typical starting dose would be like,\n50 milligrams three times a week.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll notice, in most men,\nespecially young men, FSH and LH goes up.\nIn any man, the FSH and LH go up,\nbut if a man still has testicular reserve,\nhe'll make lots of testosterone\nin response to that.\n'Cause that's the first order question\nwe're trying to answer, is do you...\nIs your failure to make\ntestosterone central or peripheral?\n- Yeah, and I think...\nJust want to point out, again,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\nbut my understanding is\nthat a lot of the drugs\nthat we're talking about,\nthe synthetic compounds,\ntestosterone, estrogen,\nthings related to growth\nhormone, et cetera,\nwere discovered and designed\nin order to treat, excuse me,\nin order to isolate and treat\nexactly these kinds of syndromes.\nWhether or not it was the hypothalamus,\nthe pituitary, or the target tissue,\nthe ovaries or the testes, correct?\n- Correct, yeah.\nI mean, I think the easiest\nway to go about doing this\nis just give the hormone that's missing\nwithout attention to\nwhere the deficiency is.\nWhy this becomes relevant is,\nif you have a 35-year-old guy\nwhose testosterone is low,\nbut you can demonstrate that it's low\nbecause he's not getting\nenough of a signal from the pituitary,\nwhy would you bother giving\nhim more testosterone\nwhen he was the...\nHe has the Leydig cells\nand the Sertoli cells\nto make testosterone,\nhe just needs the signal.\nSometimes, though not always,\njust a course of Clomid can wake him up,\nand he's back to making\nnormal testosterone.\n- So he'll do this three times a week,\n50 milligrams three times a week\nfor a short course, and then-\n- Yeah, we would do that\nfor eight to 12 weeks\nand then we reevaluate.\n- And estrogen and testosterone\nwill increase in parallel?\n- Yes.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- And again, it depends.\nAromatase activity is dependent\non how much body fat\nyou have and genetics.\nAnd if estradiol gets too high,\nwe think if it gets over about 55, 60,\nwe will give microdoses of anastrozole.\nBut it has to be real microdoses.\nI mean, you cannot pound\npeople with anastrozole.\nTo give you perspective,\nthe sort of on-label use,\nlike if you just go to a\npharmacy and order anastrozole,\nyou're going to be one milligram tablets.\nWe can't give anybody a milligram.\n- [Andrew] They'll feel like garbage.\n- We have to have it\ncompounded at .1 milligrams,\nand we might give a patient\n.1 two to three times a week.\nThat would be a big dose of anastrozole.\n- Yeah, I think that the\ntypical TRT clinic out there\nis giving 200 milligrams per mil, one mil,\n200 milligrams of testosterone\nonce every two weeks\nand then hitting people\nwith multiple milligrams of anastrozole\nand they're all over the place.\n- I've never really understood.\nI mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised,\nbut it kind of blows my\nmind that these TRT clinics\nare up all over the place given how bad...\nI mean, I see the results\n'cause I have patients\nthat come from them,\nand I don't understand why\nthey're so incompetent.\n- I actually think it's worse than that.\nI think that they simply don't\nunderstand and don't care,\nbecause it's a pill mill\nand it's a money mill.\nI think that nowadays it\nseems like almost everybody\nwho's doing TRT is taking\nlower doses more frequently,\nevery other day or twice\na week, dividing the dose,\nand being very, very\ncareful with these estrogen\nor aromatase blockers.\n- Most of our patients do not\ntake aromatase inhibitors.\nIt's not needed.\nIt's really only the high\naromatizers that need it.\nSo yeah, when we'll\ntalk about testosterone,\nwe'll talk about dosing\nthere 'cause I agree,\nthe more frequently you\ncan take it, the better.\nAnd frankly, you don't\nneed to go more frequently\nthan twice a week.\n- Because it's so slow-acting.\n- Yeah, the half life of the drug is,\nI think it's about 3 1/2\ndays is the plasma half life,\nor something like that.\nI could be off a little bit.\nBut twice-week dosing is really nice.\nSo if you go to a testosterone clinic\nthat's giving you 200 every two weeks,\n50 twice a week is the same total dose,\nwhich by the way, is a physiologic dose.\nThat's not going to give somebody\nany of the side effects you would see.\nYou're not going to get acne with that,\nyou're not going to get gynecomastia,\nyou're not going to any of these things.\nThe only real side\neffect you get from that\nis you will get testicular atrophy.\n[upbeat rock music]"
