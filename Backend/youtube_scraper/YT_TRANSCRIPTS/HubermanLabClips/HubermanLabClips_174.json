    "transcript": "- Most people are operating\nunder the assumption\nthat eating saturated fat is bad,\nand you only do it insofar\nas you want to taste it.\nAnd then of course there's\na small group of people\nthat love to eat organs and meats\nand really pack cholesterol\nand would argue that it doesn't matter\nif your LDL is 870,\nit's not going to impact your health.\nWhat's the reality around LDL,\nHDL, dietary cholesterol,\nsaturated fat, at least in your view?\n- So first, let's differentiate\nbetween cholesterol and fat\njust for the listener, 'cause we use them\nso I do want to make\nsure people understand,\nso cholesterol is a really\ncomplicated molecule.\nSo it's a ringed molecule.\nGod, I used to know exactly\nwhat its structure was,\nbut like it could have 36\ncarbons, for all I remember.\nIt is a lipid, so it is\na hydrophobic molecule\nthat is synthesized by every\ncell in the human body.\nIt is so important that without it,\nif you look at sort of genetic conditions\nthat impair cholesterol synthesis,\ndepending on their severity,\nthey can be fatal in utero.\nSo in other words, anything\nthat really interferes\nwith our ability to produce cholesterol\nis a threat to us as a species.\nAnd the reason for that is cholesterol\nmakes up the cell membrane\nof every cell in our body.\nSo as you know, but maybe\nthe listeners don't,\neven though a cell is a spherical thing,\nit has to be fluid, right?\nIt's not just a rigid like sphere,\nlike a blow up ball, right?\nIt's got to be able to kind of move\nin this way, to mesh with other cells.\nIt also has to accommodate\nhaving porous structures\nthat traverse its membrane\nto allow ions and things\nlike that to go across.\nAnd it's cholesterol that gives\nthe fluidity to that membrane.\nIt's also, as you're alluding to,\nthe backbone of some of the most important\nhormones in our body.\nEstrogen, progesterone, testosterone,\ncortisol, so we have this\nthing, super important.\nOkay, then let's talk about\ncan you get cholesterol in your diet?\nYes, you can eat foods that\nare rich in cholesterol.\nWhat was known in 1960,\nbut somehow escaped\neverybody's imagination,\nuntil finally the\nAmerican Heart Association\nacknowledged this a few years ago,\nis that the cholesterol you eat\ndoes not really make it into your body.\nAnd the reason for that\nis it's esterified.\nSo we have, and not to get too nerdy,\nbut I think people, I think if...\nI really think it's\nimportant people understand\nhow this thing works, so\nwe have cells in our gut,\nenterocytes, they're the\nendothelial cells of our gut.\nEach one of them has basically\ntwo transporters on them.\nSo the first is called\nthe Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter.\nThe second is called the\nATP binding cassette G5/G8.\nOkay, the Niemann-pick\nC1-like 1 transporter\nwill bring in any sterol, cholesterol,\nzoosterol, phytosterol, any sterol\nthat fits through the door will come in.\nVirtually all of that is\nthe cholesterol we produce\nthat gets taken back to the liver\nthat the liver packages\nin bile and secretes.\nSo that's what aids in our digestion,\nwhich is another thing I\nshould have mentioned earlier.\nIn addition to using cholesterol\nfor cell membranes and hormones,\nwe wouldn't be able to digest our food\nwithout cholesterol,\nbecause it's what makes\nup the bile salts.\nSo our own cholesterol\nis basically recirculated\nin a pool throughout our body,\nand this is the way it\ngets back into the body.\nIt's through this Niemann-pick\nC1-like 1 transporter.\nWhen it gets in there, the body,\nthis is the checkpoint of regulation.\nThis is where the body says do you have\nenough cholesterol in the body, yes or no?\nIf yes, I will let that\ncholesterol make its way\ninto the circulation, so it'll go\noff the basal lateral side of the cell,\nnot the luminal side into the body.\nAlternatively the body says you know what,\nwe have enough cholesterol.\nI'm going to let you poop this out,\nand now the ATP binding cassette\nwill shoot it out, it'll go\nback into the luminal side\nand away it goes.\nSo all of the cholesterol in\nour body is not esterified.\nAnd it doesn't have that\nbig bulky side chain\nattached to it.\nThe cholesterol you eat is esterified.\nAnd an esterified cholesterol molecule\nsimply can't physically pass\nthrough that Niemann-pick\nC1-like 1 transporter.\nNow we probably manage\nto de-esterify 10% to 15%\nof our dietary cholesterol.\nSo in other words, there are small amounts\nof dietary cholesterol\nthat do make their way\ninto our circulation, but it represents\na small fraction of our total body's\npool of cholesterol.\nAgain, this was known even by Ancel Keys,\nthe guy who turned fat\ninto the biggest boogeyman of all time.\nAncel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s.\nDietary cholesterol plays no\nrole in serum cholesterol.\nAgain, it took the\nAmerican Heart Association\nanother 60 years to figure that out,\nbut even now they acknowledge that.\nDietary cholesterol has no bearing.\n- So why is it that\nit's pretty easy to find\nstudies, or at least people\nwho are highly credentialed\nfrom good institutions\nclaiming that eating\nsaturated fat, cheese and-\n- [Peter] That's different.\n- Saturated fat, red\nmeat, things that are rich\nin cholesterol, to be more specific,\nis bad for us in terms\nof our eventual LDL.\n- So this is two different things.\nSo saturated fat consumption\nin many people will raise LDL cholesterol.\nSo it's important to\ndifferentiate between the...\nWhat is saturated fat?\nSaturated fat, of course, is a fatty acid,\njust so people understand.\nTotally different\nmolecule from cholesterol.\nCholesterol is this very\ncomplicated ring structure,\nmultiple rings stuck together.\nSFA, saturated fat is just\na long chain fatty acid\nthat is fully saturated,\nmeaning it has no double bonds\nand it can exist in isolation,\nit can exist in a\ntriglyceride, triacylglyceride,\nor phospholipid, or all\nsorts of things like that.\nSo when we eat foods that contain fat,\nbasically there are three\ndistinctions for that fat.\nIs it saturated, is it monounsaturated,\none double bond, or is it polyunsaturated,\ntwo or more double bonds?\nThe observation that eating saturated fat\nraises cholesterol, is generally correct.\n[rock music]"
