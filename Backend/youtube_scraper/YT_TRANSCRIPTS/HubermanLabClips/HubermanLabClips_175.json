    "transcript": "- I've heard you talk before\nabout some of the prime movers\nfor longevity and all risk mortality.\nAnd I'd love for you to review\na little bit of that for us.\nI think we all know\nthat we shouldn't smoke\nbecause it's very likely\nthat we'll die earlier,\nif we smoke nicotine.\nI'm neither a marijuana\nnor a nicotine smoker,\nSo I feel on stable ground there.\nBut anytime we say smoking nowadays,\npeople really want to distinguish between\ncannabis and nicotine.\nSo I am curious about\nany differences there,\nin terms of impact on longevity.\nBut in that context,\nwhat are the things\nthat anyone and everyone\ncan do, should do, to\nlive longer, basically?\n- How long you got?\n- Well, you tell me,\n[people laughing]\nyou tell me, I'd like to live to be,\nI'd like my final decade\nto be between 90 and a 100.\n- Oh no, I meant how\nlong do you, yeah, yeah.\n- I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.\n- And will we spend\nfrom now until you're 90\ntalking about this?\n- Well there's a risk of that.\n- So, let's start with\na couple of the things\nthat you've already highlighted.\nSo smoking, how much does\nsmoking increase your risk\nof all-cause mortality?\nAnd the reason we like to\ntalk about what's called ACM,\nor all-cause mortality,\nis it's really agnostic\nto how you die.\nAnd that doesn't always make sense,\nI mean, if you're talking about,\na very specific intervention\nlike a anti-cancer therapeutic\nyou really care about\ncancer-specific mortality,\nor heart-specific mortality.\nBut when we talk about these broad things\nwe like to talk about ACM.\nSo, using smoking.\nSmoking is approximately a 40%\nincrease in the risk of ACM.\n- What does that translate to in,\nthat means I'm shortening my life by 40%?\n- No, it means at any point in time,\nthere's a 40% greater risk\nthat you're going to die\nrelative to a non-smoker\n- Got it.\n- and a never-smoker.\nYeah, yeah, so it's\nimportant to distinguish.\nIt doesn't mean your lifespan\nis going to be 40% less,\nit means at any point\nin time, standing there,\nyour risk of death is 40% higher.\nAnd by the way, that'll\ncatch up with you, right?\nAt some point that that catches up.\nHigh blood pressure, it's\nabout a 20 to 25% increase\nin all-cause mortality.\nYou take something really extreme\nlike endstage kidney disease,\nso these are patients\nthat are on dialysis,\nwaiting for an organ.\nAnd again, there's a confounder there\nbecause what's the underlying condition\nthat leads you to that?\nIt's profound hypertension,\nsignificant type 2 diabetes\nthat's been uncontrolled.\nThat's enormous, that's\nabout 175% increase in ACM.\nSo the hazard ratio is 2.75.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Type two diabetes is\nprobably about a 1.25 as well,\nso 25% increase.\nSo now the question is\nlike, how do you improve?\nSo what are the things that improve those?\nSo now here we do this by\ncomparing low to high achievers\nand other metrics.\nSo if you look at low muscle\nmass versus high muscle mass,\nwhat is the improvement?\nAnd it's pretty\nsignificant, it's about 3x.\nSo if you compare low muscle mass people\nto high muscle mass people, as they age,\nthe low muscle mass people\nhave about a 3x hazard ratio\nor 200% increase in all-cause mortality.\nNow, if you look at the\ndata more carefully,\nyou realize that it's probably\nless the muscle mass fully\ndoing that, and it's\nmore the high association\nwith strength.\nAnd when you start to tease out strength\nyou can realize that strength could be\nprobably 3.5x as a hazard ratio,\nmeaning about 250% greater risk\nif you have low strength to high strength.\n- And high strength is\nthe ability to move loads\nat 80 to 90-\n- So it's all defined\nby given studies.\nSo the most common things that are used\nare actually, they're used for\nthe purposes of experiments\nthat make it easy to do.\nAnd I don't even think\nthey're the best metrics.\nSo they're usually using grip\nstrength, leg extensions,\nand wall sits, squats, things like that.\n- Okay.\n- So how long can you sit\nin a squatted position at\n90 degrees without support,\nwould be a great demonstration\nof quad strength,\na leg extension, how\nmuch weight can you hold,\nfor how long, relative to body weight?\nThings like that.\nWe have a whole strength program\nthat we do with our patients,\nwe have something called the SMA.\nSo it's the Strength Metrics Assessment,\nand we put them through 11\ntests that are really difficult,\nlike a dead hang is one of them,\nhow long can you dead\nhang your body weight,\nstuff like that.\nSo, we're trying to be more\ngranular in that insight\nbut tie it back to these principles.\nIf you look at cardiorespiratory fitness,\nit's even more profound.\nSo, if you look at people\nwho are in the bottom 25%\nfor their age and sex,\nin terms of VO2 max, and you compare them\nto the people that are just at\nthe 50th to 75th percentile,\nyou're talking about a\n2x difference, roughly,\nin the risk of ACM.\nIf you compare the bottom\n25% to the top 2.5%,\nso you're talking about,\nbottom quarter to the elite\nfor a given age, you're talking about 5x.\n- Wow, yeah.\n- 400% difference\nin all-cause mortality.\nThat's probably the single\nstrongest association I've seen\nfor any modifiable behavior.\n- Incredible, so when you\nsay elite these are people\nthat are running marathons\nat a pretty rapid clip.\n- Not necessarily, it's just\nwhat the Vo2 max is for that,\nmy Vo2 max would be in the\nelite for my age group.\nMy Vo2 max, but then again,\nI'm training very deliberately\nto make sure that it's in that.\nSo, I wouldn't consider myself\nelite at anything anymore,\nbut I still maintain a Vo2\nmax that is elite for my age.\n- I'd consider you an elite\nphysician and podcaster\n[Peter laughing]\nand guy, all around,\nbut, true.\nBut in terms of, okay so for-\n- But the point is\nyou don't have to be a world class athlete\nto be elite here, yeah.\n- Got it.\n- Yeah,\n- Got it.\nSo maybe we could talk a little bit about\nthe specifics around the training\nto get into the top two tiers there,\nbecause it seems that those\nare enormous positive effects\nof cardiovascular exercise,\nfar greater than the sorts\nof numbers that I see around,\nlet's just say, supplement\nA, or supplement B.\n- Well, and that's, you know\nthis is my whole pet peeve in life, right?\nIt's like, I just can't get enough\nof the machinating and arguing\nabout this supplement\nversus that supplement.\nAnd I feel like you shouldn't\nbe having those arguments\nuntil you have your\nexercise house in order.\nYou shouldn't be arguing about your,\nthis nuance of your carnivore diet,\nversus this nuance of your paleo diet,\nversus this nuance of your vegan diet,\nuntil you can deadlift your\nbody weight for 10 reps,\nthen you can come and\ntalk about those things\n- let's just come up with some\n- You're right.\nmetrics,\n- Yeah.\n- until your Vo2 max is at\nleast to the 75th percentile,\nand you're able to dead\nhang for at least a minute,\nand you're able to wall\nsit for at least two,\nwe could rattle off a bunch of\nrelatively low hanging fruit,\nI wish there was a rule that said\nyou couldn't talk about\nanything else, health related.\n- We can make that rule.\n- [laughs] No one will listen to it.\n- Well, I don't know about that,\nwe can make whatever rules we want.\nWe can call it Attia's rule.\nOne thing I've done before on this podcast\nand on social media is just borrowing\nfrom the tradition in science, which is,\nit's inappropriate to name\nsomething after yourself,\nunless you were a scientist before 1950.\nBut it's totally\nappropriate to name things\nafter other people, so I'm\ngoing to call it Attia's rule,\nuntil you can do the following things,\ndon't talk about supplements.\n- Please refrain\nfrom talking about\nsupplements and nutrition.\n- There it is, hereafter,\nthought of, referred to, and referenced\nas Attia's rule.\nI coined the phrase, not him,\nso there's no ego involved,\nbut it is now Attia's rule.\nWatch out! #attia'srule.\n- Oh God.\n- Wikipedia entry, Attia's rule.\nIn all seriousness, and\nI am serious about that.\nDead hang for about a minute,\nseems like a really good\ngoal for a lot of people.\nAt least-\n- That's our goal,\nI think we have a minute\nand a half is the goal\nfor a 40 year old woman,\ntwo minutes is the goal\nfor 40 year old man.\nSo we adjust them up and\ndown based on age and gender.\n- Great, and then the wall sit?\nWhat are some numbers?\n- We don't use the wall sit.\nWe do just a straight squat,\nair squat, at 90 degrees,\nand I believe two minutes is the standard\nfor both men and women at 40.\n- Great, and then,\nbecause for some people\nthinking in terms of VO2 max\nis a little more complicated,\nthey might not have\naccess to the equipment\nor to measure it, et cetera.\nWhat can we talk about, think about\nin terms of cardiovascular?\nSo run a mile at seven minutes or less,\neight minutes or less?\n- That's a good question.\nSo there are Vo2, there\nare really good Vo2 max\nestimators online, and you can\nplug in your activity d'Azur,\nso, be it a bike, run, or rowing machine,\nand it can give you a sense of that.\nAnd I don't, I used to know all of those,\n- Oh, that's okay.\n- But now that I just\nactually do the testing,\nI don't recall them.\nBut it's exactly that line of thinking,\ncan you run a mile in this time?\nIf you can, your Vo2 max\nis approximately this.\n- Great.\n- And I think\nsomewhere in my podcast realm\nI've got all those charts posted of like,\nthis is by age, by sex,\nthis is what the Vo2 max is\nin each of those buckets.\n- Terrific, we'll provide links to those,\nwe'll have our people find those links.\nAnd then you mentioned dead\nlifting body weight 10 times.\n- I just made that one up.\nWe don't, that's not one\nthat we include, but-\n- [Andrew] Something like that?\n- We we use farmer carries,\nso we'll say for a male you\nshould be able to farmer carry\nyour body weight for, I\nthink we have two minutes.\nSo that's half your body\nweight in each hand,\nyou should be able to walk\nwith that for for two minutes.\nFor women, I think we're\ndoing 75% of body weight,\nor something like that, yeah.\n- Great, I love it.\nAs indirect measures of how healthy and,\n- Yeah, huge.\n- we are, and how long\nwe're going to live.\n- Yeah, it's basically\ngrip strength, it's mobility,\nI mean, again, walking\nwith that much weight\nfor some people initially is really hard.\nWe use different things\nlike vertical jump,\nground contact time if\nyou're jumping off a box,\nthings like that, so it's\nreally trying to capture,\nand it's it's an evolution, right?\nI think the test is going to get\nonly more and more\ninvolved as we get evolved,\n'cause it took us about a year,\nBeth Lewis did the majority\nof the work to develop this.\nBeth runs our strength\nand stability program\nin the practice.\nAnd basically I just tasked her with like,\n\"Hey go out to the\nliterature and come up with\nall of the best movements\nthat we think are proxies\nfor what you need to be the most kick-ass,\nwhat we call Centenary decathlete.\"\nWhich is the person living\nin their marginal decade,\nat the best.\n[upbeat music]"
