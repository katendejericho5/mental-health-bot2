    "transcript": "- So in all of the\nstudies that we have done\nlooking at that connection\nbetween this narrowed focus of attention\nand improvements in exercise,\nwe do not find that it only works\nfor the people who are in shape,\nor that it backfires for\npeople who are out of shape.\nIt works for everybody.\nThis is a strategy that\neverybody can adopt,\nbecause it's just simply about,\nwhat do you allocate\nattentional resources to?\nWhat do you ignore and\nwhat do you focus on?\nAnd that visually induces the same kind\nof illusion for everybody,\nregardless of whether you're overweight,\nor you're at your target weight,\nor if you're struggling to get there,\nor you've already accomplished\nwhere you want to be.\nThat visual illusion can\nbe induced for everybody,\nand it has the same kinds of consequences."
