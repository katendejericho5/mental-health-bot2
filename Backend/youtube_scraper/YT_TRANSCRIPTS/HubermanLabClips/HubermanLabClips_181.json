    "transcript": "- The simple question is,\ncan I use this finish line strategy\nto make the start line a goal\nand get my system more\nengaged or motivated?\nAnd is there any physiology,\nor physiological changes I\nshould say, to reflect the idea\nthat maybe just visually\nfocusing on the start line\nwould actually get me more excited\nas opposed to make me less\nexcited to engage in effort.\n- Mm-hmm.\nThere's certainly vision\nscience that's tied up\nin that very first stage of goal setting,\nlike, identifying what that\ngoal is in the first place\nand taking those first steps.\nA lot of people's go-to\nstrategies that involve vision\nare our vision boards, or dream boards,\nor, you know, Post-it notes, right?\nThey're creating some sort\nof visual representation\nof what it is that they\nwant to accomplish.\nWhere is it that I want to be\nin five years, 10 days, 10 years?\nWhatever that timeline is\nthat they're working under.\nThe idea of vision\nboards, or dream boards,\nis that you like, you know,\nalmost like a scrapbook\ncollect visual icons\nthat reflect where you want\nto be to motivate yourself.\nIt's a really common\ntactic that people use\nand it's not bad to do that, right?\nFor some people, just even\nknowing what they want in life\nis a major accomplishment.\nDefining the goal can be\nreally challenging for people.\nAnd that's a strategy that works\nand involves our visual experience, right?\nIt's not just people aren't saying like,\nwhy don't you just sit around and imagine\nwhat you want your life\nto be like in 10 years?\nThe strategy that people\nare suggesting is like,\nno, cut out the pictures,\nput it on a board\nand stick it by your bathroom mirror\nso you see it every day, right?\n- Or make a list.\n- [Emily Balcetis] Or make a list, yeah.\n- People are big on these lists.\nI have a lot of friends are\nlike, have you made your list?\n- [Emily Balcetis] Yeah.\n- Right?\nThe list of things that you\ninsist on having in the context\nof fitness, relationship,\njob, et cetera, et cetera,\nthis seems more and more common now.\n- Yeah, totally.\nAnd the idea like, write it down, right?\nThey're telling you, write it down, like,\nor create a visual manifestation of it.\nAnd so, yeah, that's effective\nfor identifying what you want,\nbut it may not actually be effective\nfor helping you to meet the\ngoal, to get the job done.\nSo colleagues of mine at New\nYork University have probed,\nwell, why?\nWhy is that?\nWhy is just, you know,\nthinking about what you want in your life\nand sort of putting yourself\nvicariously into those shoes\nimagining what my life will be like\nif I can accomplish\neverything on this list,\nwhy doesn't that work?\nWell, first of all, does\nit work? The answer is, no.\nAnd why does it not work?\nBecause what happens,\nthese colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen\nand her research team have\nfound, is that, you know,\ngoing through and dreaming about,\nor visualizing how great my life will be\nwhen I get X, Y and Z done,\nthat is like a goal satisfied.\nI have identified what it is that I want.\nI have experienced it, even\nif just in an imaginary way.\nI've had that positive experience\nof thinking about\nhow great my life is going to\nbe when I get this thing done.\nAnd they start to sort\nof rest on their laurels.\nShe's actually measured\nsystolic blood pressure and heart rate.\nAnd they found that people who do that,\nwho go through that\nexperience of visualizing\nhow great my life will be\nwhen I get X, Y and Z done,\ntheir systolic blood pressure,\nthe bottom number on your blood\npressure reading, decreases.\nOkay, now I'm all about\nfinding ways to relax,\nespecially in New York, right?\nYou're constantly living at\na high level of stimulation.\nAnd so like, cool, great.\nSo maybe I should just like, think about\nhow awesome my life will be\nwhen I get my bucket list done.\nBut motivation scientists know\nthat systolic blood pressure\nis actually an indicator\nof our body's readiness\nto get up and act, to do something.\nNow, that can be the going out for a walk,\ngoing out for a run, hitting the gym.\nIt can also be things like\ndoing math problems, right?\nEven if it's something that's just mental,\nsystolic blood pressure actually goes up\nin anticipation of your body or your mind\nneeding to do something, taking\nthe first steps on a goal.\nSo then it helps us to understand of like,\nokay, if I've just created\nthis dream board, this vision board,\nand put myself\npsychologically in that space\nof a goal satisfied,\nwhy is it bad that blood\npressure goes down?\nBecause it means your\nbody is chilling out.\nIt's like, all right, cool.\nI just accomplished something\npretty major, right?\nI'd actually now don't have\nthe physiological resources\nat the ready to take\nthe first step right now\nto do something about that.\nSo that was a pretty monumental finding\nfor motivation scientists to understand\nthat, like, creating these dream boards,\nthese vision boards, or to-do\nlist might actually backfire,\nbecause in and of itself\nis the creation of a goal and\nthe satisfaction of the goal.\nAnd then people understandably\ngive themselves some time\nto just enjoy that positive experience.\n- So much for the secret.\n- [Emily Balcetis] Yeah, exactly. Exactly.\n- I guess now the secret folks\nwill come after me with pitch forks, but.\n- I try to never say the name, right?\n- Oh, well, I'm not\nafraid to say the name.\nI mean, I imagine\nthat certain strategies\nmight work for other people,\nbut everything you're saying again\nis consistent with what we know about\nthe physiology of dopamine\ncircuits for motivation.\nI have a good friend who,\nperhaps in incidentally, perhaps not,\nis a cardiologist at a major university,\nsaid that one of the major\nerrors that people make\nwith book writing and completion\nis they will tell people\nthey're going to write a book,\nand people will say, oh, you\ndefinitely should write a book,\neveryone's going to love your book.\nAnd they never end up writing it.\nAnd his theory is that they\nget so much dopamine reward\nfrom that immediate feedback,\nwith all the protection of never\nhaving the book criticized,\n- [Emily Balcetis] Yeah.\n- that they never write the book.\nI'm sure there are exceptions to this.\nBut I guess it raises the question,\nwhat's the better strategy?\n- Yeah, so I'm not saying\nthat people who enjoy\na dream board creation\nshould stop what they're doing.\nThat's not the take home message here.\n- Nightmare board?\n[Emily laughs]\n- [Emily Balcetis] Oh,\ndefinitely not that, no.\nThere's enough anxiety\nand fear in the world,\nwe don't need to encourage more of it.\nBut the process of goal setting\nshouldn't stop with\narticulating what the goal is.\nSo at that same point that\nwe're trying to figure out,\nwhat do we want to do?\nWhat is my vision for the future?\nIn those planning sessions,\nwe need to simultaneously think\nabout a couple other things.\nOne is, how are we going to get there?\nSo take it out of the abstract,\ntake it out of this\nidyllic visual iconography,\nand start thinking about\nthe practical day-to-day.\nWe need to break it down\ninto more manageable goals,\nnot just my ten year plan for\nmyself, but my two week plan.\nWhat can I accomplish\nin the next two weeks\nand the two weeks after\nthat's going to set me\non the right trajectory?\nThat's probably not surprising\nto anybody who's been thinking about,\nhow do I set goals better?\nYou know, plan big picture,\nthink big picture abstractly,\nbut then also break it\ndown more concretely.\nThat's probably not surprising,\nbut it's an important aspect\nof the goal setting process.\nThen, again, Gabriele\nOettingen in my department\nhas identified a third, often overlooked,\nor underappreciated\nstage, that has to happen\nat that goal, in the goal setting process.\nAnd that's thinking about\nthe obstacles that stand\nin your way of success\nand that it will actually help improve\nmotivation in the long-run.\nAnd sometimes people think\nthat that like, is counterintuitive.\nYou're saying like, if I want\nto increase my motivation,\nhave more motivation than\nI need to think about\nhow hard it's going to\nbe, all the ways that\nI'm going to fail,\nhow is that going to like, jazz me up?\nHow is that going to help me get through\nwhen I actually, you know,\nwhen things get hard?\nBut it does, because it's like coming up\nwith a plan B, a plan C, plan D\nin advance of actually experiencing that.\nIf you were on a boat and\nthe boat started to sink,\nthat's not the time\nyou want to start\nlooking for life jackets.\nYou already want to know where one is\nso you can go to it right away.\nAnd it's the same thing with goal setting,\nis that you want to know,\nwhat am I working towards?\nHow I'm going to get there?\nAnd if I experience this obstacle,\nhere's what I'm going to do about it.\nYou may never experience\nthat obstacle, but if you do,\nyou're probably going to be\nshy on time, thin on resources,\nmaybe experiencing an anxiety\nthat hijacks your brain\nso you're not functioning\nat that optimal level of\njudgment and decision making.\nYou want to already have like,\nthe snap next step in place\nso you can just hop to it, right?\nWe are not going to do our best thinking\nwhen we're in crisis mode.\nBut we don't have to if we have used,\nif we have already used\nour resources in advance\nto come up with that\nplan B or that plan C."
