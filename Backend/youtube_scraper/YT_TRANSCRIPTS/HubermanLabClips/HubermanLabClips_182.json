    "transcript": "- Certain individuals\nof certain occupations\ntend to be more creative\nand that creativity is associated with,\nagain associated, this isn't\ncausal, it's associated\nor correlated with higher levels\nor incidence of bipolar depression\nand maybe even other forms of depression.\nThese are people that are\nnot just good at what they do\nbut are exceptional at what they do.\nAmong the professions they\nlooked at in this study\n'cause they didn't look\nat all professions,\nthose in the military\nand those who are professional athletes\nor had jobs in the social\nor natural sciences\nthere was a lower percentage of those\nthat had depression or mania.\nIn some cases, like those who\nare professional athletes,\nthere was no incidence of mania.\nIt is really striking to see\nhow the creative occupations,\npoetry, fiction, art, non-fiction writing,\nmusic composition, theater,\nmuch higher incidence.\nWe'd be wrong to say that certain aspects\nof manic episodes don't lend\nthemselves well to creativity.\nIn no way, shape or form do I believe\nthat being depressed is a good thing\nor that being manic is a good thing."
