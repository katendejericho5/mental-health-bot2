    "transcript": "- How should people\nthink about what to eat?\n- So yeah, I have what\na call a plate method\nand it's just simple\n'cause it works for me.\nAnd again, if you're struggling\nwith real eating issues,\nthese mechanisms become\nadmittedly less effective\nbecause you're having,\nmaybe you have emotionally\ntriggered eating\nand you can't stop at one plate,\nI mean that, you could\nget the plate right,\nbut if the portions are out control.\n- If the plate,\nplate has a dimensionality of height.\n- Or multiple plates,\nlike second and third\nand fourth.\n- Or plate.\n- Or plate, right?\nLike all these things\ncould be a challenge,\nbut what I say is when\nyou have your plate,\nthen you just simply look at\nit as like a clock, right?\nAnd if you just make a 9:20 on the clock,\nso one arm goes over to the nine\nand one of the arms goes over to 20,\nwell then you're basically,\nyou're going to take the\nsecond largest portion of that,\n'cause you think you're\ngoing to make a line\ntowards 12 o'clock too\nand the largest portion is going to be\nyour fibrous carbohydrates,\nso that's the green vegetables, all right,\nso whether it be broccoli or\nbrussel sprouts or asparagus,\npick your favorites.\nThose are the ones\nthat give us a lot of the\nmicronutrients we need,\nthey're the ones that are generally\naccepted as more healthy\nand they're also going\nto provide the fiber\nthat's going to be both beneficial\nin terms of its impact on insulin\nand also just through filling you up.\nAnd then I take the next\nlargest portion of that\nand I devote that towards protein.\nAnd I think it's really important,\nespecially for anybody active,\nthe more active you are,\nthe more you embark on\ntrying to build muscle,\nyou're going to need to\nhave protein in every meal\nso I have that.\nAnd again, we're talking\ncleaner sources of protein,\nbut like I am,\nyou'll never find like\nboiled chicken on my plate,\nlike I ditched those days\nwhen I was 16 or 15 or 16,\nlike I realized after reading\nthose bodybuilding magazines\nthat maybe the low fat\nthing stuck for too long,\nor the no fat thing stuck for too long,\nbut the boiled chicken and\nsteamed broccoli thing,\nthat ended quickly for me\n'cause I really, I'm not\ngoing to eat this forever.\nSo I'll have some sort of fish or chicken,\nbut it will be cooked\nin a way that's like,\nit's got maybe some sauce\non it or it's got some,\nmaybe it's tomato sauce, anything\nto just make it a little bit\nmore palatable and interesting\nwithout blowing the value of the meal.\nAnd then that last portion\nis where I put my starchy carbohydrates.\nAnd again, that's the part\nthat some people will say\nexclude them entirely\n'cause they're not healthy\nor they don't work for you\nor they're not beneficial long term.\nFor me, it's been a godsend.\nAnd I do think I'm like most people,\nmy body craves those carbohydrates.\nI choose things like sweet\npotatoes, which is my favorite,\nor I'll have rice or I'll have pasta,\nI'm Italian so I like pasta,\nI will have those things,\nI'm not excluding them,\nbut I don't put them\nin the portions that you\nwould generally find.\nMy wife and I will go out and\nwe'll go to the restaurant\nsometimes because we travel quite a bit,\nor used to at least with baseball too.\nThere's a Cheesecake\nFactory everywhere you went\nand I love Cheesecake Factory,\nbut the way they structure meals is\nit's all rice on the bottom\nand a little bit of chicken on top,\nand I mean it's a plateful of rice.\nYou wouldn't find me\nmake a plate that way.\nI'm going to just devote\nthat portion of the plate\nto the starchy carbohydrate.\nAnd so it gives me a little\nbit more responsibility\nin terms of portion control\n'cause those are the foods,\nagain probably dopamine driven\nthat are most easily overeaten.\nI always ask the question,\nwhen's the last time you ate\n10 chicken breasts at a meal?\nLike you're getting sick of\nit after maybe two or three,\nbut you could eat a whole hell\nof a lot of carbohydrates,\nstarchy carbohydrates\nbecause the they're just so satisfying.\nAnd I think those triggers,\nas you said, that want more,\nlike that's what happens, right,\nyou just keep eating.\nEven when you're feeling\nfull, you want more.\nAnd that's the biggest\ndanger to carbohydrates.\nSo if you can develop some\nsort of discipline around them,\nthen you can still enjoy them.\nIf you can't develop that\ndiscipline for whatever reason,\nthen maybe they do become something\nthat you have to work yourself around\nor adopt a different eating style.\nAnd as I said, I'm never to the point\nwhere I'm not trying to be\ndogmatic in my approach,\nI'm always trying to\nsay, this is how I do it\nand I'm a believer in it,\njust like everyone else is\na believer in their method,\nbut I'm open to the idea that\nsomething that works for you\nand gets you to a healthier\nweight and a sustainability,\nlike that is good, that's good for me\nprovided doesn't introduce\nother other issues, you know?\n- Yeah, something one can do consistently,\nthat's something I picked\nup from you over the years,\nwhat can you do consistently?\nAnd for me, that also meant\nwhen and how can I eat,\nwhat can I eat consistently,\nthat will also allow me\nto be alert after lunch\nso I can actually get some work done?\nOr eat, I like to train\nfasted in the morning,\nbut I don't do any long-term fasting,\nit just so happens that I'm fine\ndoing water and caffeine in the morning\nand training in the morning\nand then I eat my first meal afterwards,\nbut I get carbohydrates at night\nso my glycogen is restored.\nI think carbohydrates are wonderful,\nI just don't eat them in excess.\nSo to me it's,\nI feel like what you describe\nis as a very rational,\nliterally balanced approach,\nand obviously there will be variations\nfor people who are dealing\nwith obesity or diabetes.\nI've got friends that are\non the pure carnivore thing,\nI have friends that are vegan\nand it's always impressive to me\nwhen somebody can stick\nto anything consistently,\nexcept when they're sticking\nto just poor behavior,\nthere's nothing impressive about that.\nWell, I think that that's very helpful\nbecause I think there's a,\nfor the typical listener of this podcast,\nthe online content that people see,\nthe battles are very confusing,\nthey're distracting\nbecause people really think,\noh, there's a right way and a wrong way.\nAnd it sounds like the way\nthat one can eat consistently\nover time that's healthy,\ncertainly fewer processed\nand sugary foods,\nI think almost everybody agrees there.\n- Yeah, almost everyone\nagrees on that, right?\nSo I think it's calorie manipulation\nthrough some other method.\nSo even intermittent fasting,\nlike you said, like that could be,\nit's for people that are grazers.\nLike if you are a grazer\nand your real problem\nis portion control over\nthe course of the day,\nbut you can respond to\na rule that says, no,\nyou're eating between here and here,\nyou can obey that rule,\nwell, you're not going to be able to graze\nduring the times that you might\nbe doing additional damage.\nSo sure, there's other hormonal benefits\nthat people will talk\nabout from that approach,\nbut from a longevity standpoint\nand habit forming standpoint,\nif it's fixing the habit\nthat you're breaking too often\nby eating throughout\nwhenever you feel like you walk by food,\nit's good and it works.\nAnd again, people will tell you\nyou can probably eat\nwhatever you want to eat\nas long as you're eating\nwithin those that window,\nbut I think the more responsible people\nwho are practitioners of that will say,\nno, you still ant to avoid processed sugar\nand things like that,\nand that's just a mechanism of eating,\nnot really a diet, right?\nBut I think that people,\nI hate to be as like as\nbasic as it sounds with that,\nbut it's for the exact reason\nthat if it it's that\n23 hour day phenomenon\nthat it's like, you said you're impressed,\nit is impressive.\nIt's so hard to control\nall of our behaviors,\nand food being one of the hardest,\none of the biggest temptations for people,\nyou got to learn how to\ncontrol that for so long\nand then do it day after day after day,\nwhatever that mechanism is that\nworks for you is impressive.\nAnd I'm a believer in it.\nI think that's how I feel,\nI just feel like people need\nto be able to be given some reigns\nto be able to find what works for them.\n- Well, I love to eat\nand one of the beauties of weight training\nis I feel like I can\neat plenty for my age,\nand I'm not as lean as you are\nbut I'm happy with where I'm at.\nI could always do better.\nWith each year, actually,\nI'm getting better,\nprobably because I'm eating cleaner,\nprobably 'cause I also have\nsomeone to cook for me now\nand we like healthy food\nand so I'm very fortunate.\nI don't think we have any\npackaged food in our home.\nWe even started making sauerkraut at home,\nwell I don't make it, she makes it.\n- My wife actually,\nshe turned me on to a tip\nthat I actually shared\nwith with the whole\nchannel, which was like,\nyou can go to, we have\na Stew Leonard's around,\na big grocery store chain around us,\nand they have a catering department.\nAnd they're often used\nfor catering big parties\nand big tubs of grilled chicken,\nbut like really good grilled chicken,\nagain, not the boiled chicken,\nand big tubs of sweet potatoes.\nAnd we'll get a bunch of those\nand she'll go over and she'll get 'em\nand she'll sort of arrange them on plates\nand put the plates in.\nI'm okay with repetitive eating.\nI think more people are probably\nokay with repetitive eating\nthan they think.\nI think that when you actually break down\nhow many different breakfast\nvariations do you have?\nThree, two?\n- Two or three maximum, right?\n- And so I think when people do,\nthere's more variety for dinner probably,\nbut like even there\nyou probably eat five\ndifferent types of dinners\nover the course of a week or a month.\nIf you have that ability\nto identify the things that you like,\nand again, no plan is going to work\nif you're eating stuff you don't like,\nit's not going to work\nforever, nothing will,\nyou have to really enjoy\nwhat you're eating.\nAs long as these variations of this meal\nare something that you really enjoy\nand there are limited versions of them,\nthe reproducibility of that is simple.\nIt will take some time,\nbut if you're fortunate enough,\nin our case, to have somebody\nwho can prepare it for you,\nnow that's even part out\nof the equation, you know?\nAnd it's like it just\nmakes it very simple.\nBut I do think when you\ntally up all the costs\nof medical care that are\nspiked by having poor nutrition\nand you then offset that\nby what it might cost you\nto invest in a faster strategy,\nlike this catering trick\nor whatever it might be,\nyou'd be best off figuring out a way\nto maybe reallocate some of\nyour money to preparing this\nbecause you know how important it is\nto your long term health and longevity.\nIf you can figure out\nyour nutrition issues,\nif everyone listening to this podcast\ncan figure out their nutrition issues,\nthis whole world would be different.\nThat is like one of the\nlargest sources of disease\nand pain and discomfort\nbecause people really\nstruggle with nutrition.\n[upbeat music]"
