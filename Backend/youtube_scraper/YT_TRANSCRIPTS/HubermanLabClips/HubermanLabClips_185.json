    "transcript": "- One of your mantras\nis if you want to look like an\nathlete, train like an athlete,\nand I think that's\nsomething really special\nthat sets aside what you do\nfrom what a lot of other very\nwell qualified people do.\nAnd in terms of the use\nof weights and resistance,\nwhether or not it's body weight\nor weights in the gym or\npulleys versus cardio,\nin terms of overall health,\naesthetics, and athleticism,\nis there a way that you\ncould point to the idea\nthat maybe people should be\ndoing 50% resistance training\nand 50% cardio, maybe it's 70/30,\nmaybe it's 30/70,\nand here I'm talking\nabout the typical person\nwho would like to maintain\nor maybe even add some muscle mass,\nprobably in particular\nareas for most people,\nas opposed to just overall mass,\nalthough we'll talk about\nthat later, and people\nwho want to maintain a relatively\nlow body fat percentage\nand be in good cardiovascular health.\nWhat's the sort of\ncontour of a basic program\nthat anybody could think\nabout as a starting place?\n- I think it's like a 60/40 split,\nwhich would be leaning\ntowards weight training,\nstrength, and then the conditioning aspect\nbe about 40%.\nSo if you look at it over a\ncourse of a training week,\nI mean, five days in a\ngym would be a great task.\nAnd obviously not in the gym,\nit could be done at home.\nBut three days strength training,\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday,\nconditioning, Tuesday, Thursday, two days.\nIt's a pretty easy roundabout\nway to split that up,\nof course, depending upon training goals.\nAnd as you said, the\naesthetic goals like that\nwill shift dramatically.\nBut if you want to see\nthe benefits of both,\nthat's probably the effective\ndose for strength training\nand the effective dose for conditioning\nat the bare minimum level.\nAgain, being a much better\nperformer conditioning wise,\nyou're going to want to do more than that.\n- And in terms of the\nduration of those workouts,\nwhat's your suggestion?\nI've been weight training\nfor about 30 years,\nrunning for about 30 years,\nand mainly for health,\nand have found that if\nI work hard in the gym\nor at resistance training for\nmore than 60 minutes or so,\nit's very hard for me to recover.\nI start getting colds,\nI start getting weaker\nfrom workout to workout.\nBut amazingly, at least to me,\nif I keep those workouts to\nabout 10 minutes of warmup\nand 50, five zero minutes\nor so of really hard work\nfor resistance training,\nand I keep the cardiovascular work\nto about 30 to 45 minutes, I feel great.\nAnd I seem to make some progress,\nat least some place in the\nworkout from workout to workout.\n- Yeah, I mean, those are good numbers,\n'cause those are kind of\nnumbers that we usually preach.\nWe try to keep our workouts to\nan hour or less, if possible.\nNow, depending upon the\nsplit that you're following,\nif you're on a total body split,\nthere's just going to be\nmore that has to be done\nin a given amount of time.\nAnd again, if you're training\nprimarily for strength,\nthat could prolong the workout,\n'cause the longer rest\ntime is in between sets.\nBut in general, when you're\nnot focused on that one aspect\nbut the overall health picture,\nthen you can get the job\ndone in under an hour.\nAnd again, I always say,\non top of if if you want\nto look like an athlete,\ntrain like an athlete,\nis you can either train\nlong or you can train hard,\nbut you can't do both.\nAnd I really believe\nthat the focus for me,\nI have a busy life, I have a\nlot of other things that I do,\nbelieve it or not, and it's like,\nI want to go hard and I want to get out.\nAnd I find that my body\nalso responds to that,\nand I think a lot of guys'\nbodies respond to that.\nAnd particularly, as\nyou start to get older,\nI think it's the length of the workout\nthat actually causes more problems\nthan the intensity of what you're doing.\nParticularly, if you're warmed\nup properly, like you said,\nI've found personally that my warmup\nhas had to become more of an\nintegral part of my workout\nthan it ever has before.\nI could get in the gym when I was 20,\nand I'm going right over,\nI'm doing the one set, two\nsets, and I'm ready to go.\nAnd I never do another workout warmup set\nfor any of the other exercise\nI do the rest of the day.\nThat's not true anymore.\nAnd I found that as long as I'm willing\nto sort of give myself a\nlittle bit of a warm up,\nthe intensity is not what bothers me.\nI'm very much in control\nof the weights that I use,\nand it doesn't bother me.\nBut if I start to go pretty long,\nI start to feel achy, or\nI start to have problems.\nSo again, depending upon age,\nthat also plays a factor in the length.\nBut again, I think everybody can achieve\non a standard program,\ncan achieve the results that\nthey want within an hour.\n[upbeat music]"
