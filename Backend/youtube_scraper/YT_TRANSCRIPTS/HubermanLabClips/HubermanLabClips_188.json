    "transcript": "- I want to highlight some recent findings\nin an area totally\nseparate from mental health\nthat I think are really important\nfor everyone to know about.\nThis is a paper published\nin the journal, \"Cell,\"\nwhich is a Cell Press\njournal, an excellent journal,\nin fact, one of the three apex journals.\nSo for those of you that are curious,\npapers published in the journal, \"Nature,\"\n\"Science,\" and \"Cell\" are considered\nthe sort of Super Bowl, Stanley Cup,\nand NBA championships of publishing.\nAnd this paper entitled\n\"An inter-organ neural circuit\nfor appetite suppression\"\nillustrates a very important principle\nthat I think everyone should know about.\nAnd that's the principle of\nso-called parallel pathways.\nParallel pathways, as the name suggests,\nare pathways that could be neural pathways\nor hormonal pathways or otherwise\nthat operate independently of one another\nto accomplish a common goal.\nAnd what this paper really shows\nis that there's a set\nof peptides in the body,\nand the peptide that\nI'm referring to today\nis called GLP-1,\nglucagon-like peptide one,\nand some related peptides.\nI've talked about these\non the podcast before\nfor two reasons.\nFirst of all,\nI'm a big proponent and\nconsumer of yerba mate.\nYerba mate is a tea that\ncan promote the release\nof glucagon-like peptide one,\nand there are also new prescription drugs\nthat are now hitting the market\nand for which there are really\nimpressive clinical trials\nfor diabetes and obesity\nthat are essentially\nglucagon-like peptide one stimulators,\nso they stimulate the release\nof that, or they are in fact\na synthetic version of\nglucagon-like peptide one.\nWhat is glucagon-like peptide one?\nIt is a peptide, which is\na small little protein,\nthat can dramatically suppress appetite.\nSo that's why these\ndrugs are being explored\nand are showing quite impressive results\nfor things like treatment\nof type two diabetes\nand other forms of diabetes,\nas well as obesity.\nSo they lead to weight loss.\nNow in terms of the yerba mate stimulation\nof glucagon-like peptide one,\nthat's going to be a much lower amount\nof glucagon-like peptide\none that's released\nfrom drinking yerba\nmate as opposed to, say,\ntaking a drug that stimulates GLP-1\nor taking a drug that is GLP-1.\nNonetheless, should also point out\nthat yerba mate comes in a\nbunch of different forms.\nThere is some concern about\ncertain smokey flavored forms\nof yerba mate being carcinogenic,\nso that's why I avoid those\nforms of yerba mate, but for me,\nyerba mate is one of the preferred sources\nof caffeine for me, I\nlike the way it tastes.\nIt does provide the sort of caffeine kick\nthat I like to have early in the day\nfor focus and for work and for exercise,\nand yet I actively avoid the\nsmoked varieties of yerba mate\nbecause of the potential\ncarcinogenic effects\nof the smoked varieties.\nGlucagon-like peptide one,\nas I mentioned earlier,\ncan suppress appetite,\nbut what this paper shows\nis it does that by at least two mechanisms\nthrough parallel pathways.\nWhat this paper shows is that\nglucagon-like peptide one\nacts on receptors in the body\nin a portion of the nervous system\ncalled the enteric nervous system,\ne-n-t-e-r-i-c, enteric nervous system.\nThis is a component of your nervous system\nthat you don't really have control over.\nIt's autonomic or automatic.\nGLP-1 binds to what are called\nintestinofugal enteric neurons.\nYou don't need to know the name,\nbut those neurons do two things.\nFirst of all, they cause\nsome gut distension.\nSo they actually make you feel full.\nThis is incredible, right?\nA peptide, not actual physical food,\nbut a peptide that stimulates\nneurons that cause changes\nin the so-called\nmechanoreceptors of the gut,\nof the enteric nervous system,\nand make people feel full.\nSo it can lead to actually mild,\nor I suppose if levels\nof GLP-1 are very high,\nto major gut distension.\nOkay, I think that the levels of GLP-1\nthat would come from drinking yerba mate\nand hopefully from appropriate dosaging\nof the synthetic forms of GLP-1\nor drugs that stimulate GLP-1\nwould cause mild, not\nmajor gut distension,\n'cause major gut distension\nwould be uncomfortable.\nSo GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut\nto increase gut distension\nand by way of a pathway\nthat goes from the gut\nup to the hypothalamus,\nthis little cluster of neurons\nabout the size of a marble\nthat sits above the roof of your mouth\nis also suppressing appetite\nthrough brain mechanisms.\nSo this is really beautiful, right?\nYou have a peptide, a\nsmall little protein,\nthat's released in the gut\nand that release within the\ngut causes gut distension\nwhich makes you feel full,\nand by way of neural\nstimulation of the hypothalamus\nalso activates neural\npathways within the brain\nthat trigger satiety,\nthe feeling of having had enough food.\nSo to me, GLP-1 is both\nimpressive and important.\nWhy?\nBecause this recent category of drugs\nthat's now hitting the market\nseems to adjust obesity or can\nhelp people with weight loss\nin order to help their health,\nand it's doing so by at\nleast two mechanisms.\nOne is within the brain and\nthe other is within the gut\nand communication through the\nso-called gut brain access.\nBecause again, these enteric neurons\nare communicating to the\nbrain, the hypothalamus,\nby way of this what's called the\nsympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic\npathway.\nYou absolutely do not\nneed to know all of that.\nThat's a mouthful,\nthat's enough to make\nyour mouth feel distended.\nBut at the same time,\nthings like yerba mate\nand I'm sure there are other\ncompounds out there as well,\nbut certainly yerba mate can\nstimulate the release of GLP-1,\nso for those of you that are looking\nfor some mild appetite suppression\nand want to accomplish that\nwhile also ingesting caffeine,\nyerba mate might be a\ngood option for that,\nand just know that it's operating\nthrough two mechanisms on the body\nthrough mild gut distension\nto make you feel full\nand on the brain to increase satiety\nor make you feel less hungry.\nAnd then for everybody,\nnot just those that are interested\nin appetite suppression,\nI think it's important to understand\nthat these parallel\npathways are fundamental\nto how we are organized.\nAnother good example of this\nwould be when we are excited\nby something positive or negative,\nso it could be stressful or\nwe're positively aroused,\nthere is a parallel activation\nof epinephrine, adrenaline,\nboth from your adrenals\nand from an area in the brain\ncalled the locus coeruleus.\nSo again and again,\nwe see this in biology and in neuroscience\nthat your brain and your\nbody are acting in concert.\nThey're acting together through mechanisms\nthat either are independent,\nso separately in the brain\nand separately in the body\nbut directed towards a common goal,\nor through communication\nbetween brain and body,\nand almost always that communication\nis going to be bidirectional.\nBody to brain and brain to body.\nSo I think these results\nare really interesting\nand really important\nfor sake of weight loss,\nfor sake of appetite suppression,\nand just generally for the\nway that they illustrate\nthis very important theme of the way\nthat we are constructed\nat a biologic level,\nwhich is parallel pathways.\n[upbeat music]"
