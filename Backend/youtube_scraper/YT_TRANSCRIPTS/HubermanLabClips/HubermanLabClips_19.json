    "transcript": "Are you a list maker?\nLike do you wake up in\nthe morning and make lists\nand cross things off\nand then decide what are\nthe key items on that list?\nNo, I'm a time blocker.\nTime blocker, okay.\nYeah.\nYeah, so I'm not a big\nbeliever in to-do list,\nI like to grapple with\nthe actual available time.\nLike, okay, I have a meeting here,\nI have to like pick my\nkids up from school here.\nHere's the actual hours\nof the day that are free\nand where they fall.\nAll right, what do I want\nto do with that time?\nWell, okay, now that I see\nthat there's a lot of gaps\nin the middle of the\nday here, they're short,\nmaybe there I'm going to do a lot of small\nnon-cognitively demanding thing.\nOh, this first 90 minutes in the morning\nis like the main time\nI have uninterrupted.\nOkay, so this, I'm going\nto work on writing.\nSo I've been a big believer of this\nsince I was an undergrad.\nLike you give your time a job\nas opposed to having a list,\nwhich is somewhat orthogonal\nto what's actually happening in your day.\nAnd then just as you go\nthrough your day saying,\n\"What do I want to try to do next?\"\nWhich I think is a lot less efficient.\nI'm going to try your method.\nI try and structure my\ndays as much as I can\nbut it just never quite works.\nDo you work late into\nthe night or you, no?\nNo, I'm a 5:30 man.\nOkay.\nYeah.\nSo 5:30 p.m., that's it?\nYeah, more or less, that's my cutoff.\nNow one exception is if\nI'm writing on deadline,\nI'll sometimes, like if I\nneed to get more writing done,\nI can do an evening writing session\nwhich I got used to\nthrough long experience of,\nI used to write my blog post at night\nafter like my kids went to bed.\nNow they're older and they\ndon't go to bed as early.\nSo it's like the one thing I have left\nthat I'll do after 5:30 is\nlike every once in a while\nI'll do like a 90-minute\nevening writing block.\nBut I call this, by the\nway, this whole philosophy,\nI call fixed schedule productivity.\nAnd I've been doing it\nsince I was a grad student,\nfix the work hour schedule,\nthat's my commitment.\nI work in these hours\nand then work downstream from\nthat for everything else.\nSo like this controls\nlike even what you decide\nto bring into your life 'cause you know\nI can't go past the schedule\nand it drives you to be more innovative\nin how you deal with\nyour time and schedule.\nYou have to be efficient\nbecause you only have these hours here.\nThat's been a signal for my life\nsince I was in my early 20s.\nFix the schedule and don't\nwork outside of that schedule.\nNow it's your move to figure\nout, anything you want to do,\nyou have to make that work.\nYou want to become a professor,\nfigure out how to make that work.\nYou want to write books while\nyou're being a professor,\nfigure out how to make that work.\nYou don't have the option of\njust throwing hours at it.\nAnd you innovate a lot\nI think when you have the constraints.\nWhere do sleep and exercise\nfit into your schedule?\nWhat's your typical to\nbedtime, wake up time,\nwhat's your typical exercise routine?\nAnd the reason I ask about this\nis because I think nowadays\nwe hopefully people\nunderstand that exercise\nand cognitive function\nare inextricably linked.\nYeah.\nAnd we're all going to live longer lives\nand be sharper mentally by doing exercise.\nYeah, so, I mean,\nmy main like actual working with weights,\nI do this pre-dinner, right.\nAnd this was an innovation\nof the last couple of years,\nit's a fantastic psychologically for me.\nThis is a transition from work\nto like family time after work.\nSo I'll do like 45, 50 minutes garage gym\nthat we built during COVID\nafter I'm done working before dinner.\nAnd once you get used to that\nlike it also forces you like,\nI got to finish work\n'cause I got to get this in before dinner.\nBut then I'll do also\nquite a bit of walking\nif it's not a teaching\nday so I'm not on campus.\nI do a lot of thinking on foot,\nwalking my kids to the bus stop\nwhich isn't particularly close and back.\nSo I'll do a lot of walking.\nBut my serious exercise\nnow is always pre-dinner.\nThen I want to be up in our room by 10.\nAnd then at that point I don't track,\nso I have insomnia issues,\nwhich actually has been like key driver\nof a lot of the things I think about,\nespecially with slow\nproductivity, is I'm very wary\nbecause I can without\nany control on my own,\njust find myself unable\nto sleep sometimes.\nFall asleep or stay asleep?\nFall asleep, yeah.\nI mean, I used to get it really bad.\nNot so bad now but you\nknow, it comes and goes.\nThat really affected the way\nI thought about productivity\nbecause it seemed like\nto me the definition\nof just I get after it\nwith a bunch of stuff\nwasn't really on the table\nbecause if my notion of\nproductivity depended on me\nlike every day being\nable to just like hammer\non a bunch of stuff.\nI'm very busy, I have lots of commitments.\nWhat would happen if I couldn't sleep?\nI wouldn't be able to do\nthat so I drifted naturally\ntowards a definition of\nproductivity which was,\nit doesn't really matter\nif you work tomorrow\nbut it is important that\nlike this month you work\nlike writing a book.\nIt doesn't matter if you work\non your book chapter\ntomorrow in particular,\nbut like this month\nyou have to spend a lot\nof time working on it.\nSo it was like an\ninsomnia-compatible definition\nof productivity was sort\nof morphed into this idea\nof slow productivity,\ntaking your time with it.\nSo it's interesting.\nSo like sleep issues\nreally shaped the way I thought about work\nand put me on these much longer\ntimescales of productivity.\nTry not to be dependent\non any particular day\nbeing critical to what you do.\nI don't want the high stress situation.\nI don't want the like I'm just going to,\n10 hours a day for the next 10 days,\nwe're going to make this deal happen.\nLike I can't operate in that\nspace 'cause I worry about it,\nanytime my brain could betray me\nand I could like lose\nsleep for a couple days.\nI think it's really important\nthat you're sharing this\nbecause while people's challenges differ,\nI think oftentimes people\nhear the content of my podcast\nor other podcasts and think,\n\"Oh, gosh, I have to have\neverything dialed in just right.\"\nWhen in fact, most all of\nthe tools and protocols\nthat have been discussed\non the Huberman Lab podcast\nare in response to a particular\nchallenge that I've had\nor that others close to me have had.\nAnd I love this.\nWell, I'm sorry that you\nsuffer from insomnia,\nwe have a series on sleep with Matt Walker\nin which he lays out some great tools\nthat we haven't yet\ndiscussed on the podcast.\nI'll just send you, I'll\ntext you, I'll call you\nwith a short list of those\nand hopefully they'll help\nas we do cover insomnia in some depth.\nBut I think it's important\nthat people realize\nthat they can be very productive\nwith the hours that they\nhave and the moments\nor hours of high focus\nclarity that they have\neven if they're not sleeping great,\neven if they're raising small children\nbecause that's the real world\nand certainly that's the\nreal world of deadlines\nand academia but family and\ncolds and flus and travel\nand jet lag and arguments\nand all the happy stuff too.\nVacations, so sounds like\nyou're very good at adapting\nyour day to what's going on around it\nbut that you have certain\nsort of committed time.\nAm I correct in assuming that\nyou have at least one period\nof say, 60 to 90 minutes of real,\nwhat you would call deep work,\nlet's say at least five days a week?\nI know that might be an underestimate\nbut it seems like that's what-\nThat the goal.\nThat's what I'm extracting from this.\nThat's the goal, right?\nSo to me, depending on the season,\nis how extreme that can get.\nSo the busiest season\nwould be like a teaching semester, right?\nBut even then I'm going to make sure\nthat five days a week I'm\nstarting with deep work\nand the non-teaching days are\nmore than the teaching days.\nCompare that to the summer,\nfor example, where like,\nall I do for the most part is deep work.\nNo meetings on Mondays and Fridays,\nall admin stuff is midday\nto early afternoon,\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\nEverything else is deep work, you know?\nJust locked in, hours at a time.\nBut I want, if I'm not getting five days,\nfive days of starting\nthe day with deep work,\nI'm unhappy, right?\nBecause I mean, I keep\ncoming back to this is okay\nbecause I'm not going to be able to,\nI mean, fortunately, the insomnia\nhasn't bothered me in\nyears but the threat of it\nlike completely shaped the\nway I think about things\nand because I know I'm never going to be,\nhave a sort of like an Elon\nMusk style energy of like,\nI can just take on seven companies\nand make it happen, right?\nI just don't have that ability.\nI've always focused on the long game\nand to me the long game plays out\nwith get your deep work time in, you know?\nJust keep working on the stuff you do best\nand get better at it, you know?\nTomorrow doesn't matter.\nBut if you're doing this most\ndays for the next four months,\nlike that's going to matter, you know?\nAnd so I often think about\nproductivity in my own life\nat the scale of decades.\nLike what do I want to\ndo in my 20s, you know?\nOkay, what do I want to do in my 30s?\nYou know, what do I want to do in my 40s?\nAnd that helps.\nLike in my 30s, I had a lot\nof young kids like it's,\nyeah, I mean, the amount of\ntime I could spend total working\nis like much less, right?\nBut I could still think about\nwhat do I want to do in my 30s?\nHow do I make that happen?\nLet me make sure I'm pushing\nlike on those things.\nThen everything else I can adapt to,\nI can give here and there, you know?\nIt allows you to be very adaptable\nwhen you're thinking\nabout what do I want to do\nfor the next 10 years.\nIt also means you're\nnot on a random Tuesday\nchiding yourself because like,\nwhy didn't I get three\nmore hours of work in?\nAnd that becomes sort of\na nonsensical question.\nAnd what you care about\nis like what happens\nin the next decade, which\nis, that's the long game.\nIt's not about hustling today.\nIt's about, I came back to deep\nwork day after day after day\nwhen other people got\ndistracted by TikTok.\nLike I got to, yeah, whatever,\nit's that coming back to\nwhat matters again and again.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full\nlength episode by clicking here."
