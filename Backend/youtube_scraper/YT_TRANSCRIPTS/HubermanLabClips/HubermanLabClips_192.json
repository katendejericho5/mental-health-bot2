    "transcript": "- Kids don't seem to\nlike certain vegetables,\nbut they all are hardwired\nto like sweet taste.\nAnd yet you could also imagine\nthat one of the reasons why\nthey may eventually grow\nto incorporate vegetables\nis because of some knowledge\nthat vegetables might be\n- Good for you.\n- better for them.\nSo is there a change in the receptors,\nthe distribution, the number,\nthe sensitivity, et cetera,\nthat can explain the transition\nfrom wanting to avoid vegetables\nto being willing to eat vegetables\nsimply in childhood\n- Yes.\n- to early development.\n- So I want to take the\nquestion slightly differently,\nbut I think it will illustrate the point.\nAnd I want to just use\nthe difference between\nthe olfactory system and the\ntaste system to make the point.\nTaste system, five basic palates:\nsweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.\nEach of them has a predetermined identity.\nWe know exactly what...\nAnd valance, these are attractive,\nthese are aversive.\nIn the olfactory system,\nit's claimed that we can smell\nmillions of different odors,\nyet, for the most part,\nnone of them have an innate\npredetermined meaning.\nIn the olfactory system,\nmeaning is imposed by\nlearning and experience.\n- Even the smell of smoke?\n- So I'm going to make it differently.\nThere are a handful of\nthe millions of odors\nthat were claimed that you\ncould immediately tell me.\nThese are aversive and\nthese are attractive.\n- Vomit.\n- So vomit, it's not correct\nbecause I can assure you\nthat there are cultures and societies\nwhere things which are far\nless appealing than vomit\ndo not evoke an aversive reaction.\n- Really?\n- Really.\nSulfur would be maybe a universal.\nI'm not talking pheromones,\nokay?\n- Sure.\n- Pheromones are in a different category\nthat trigger innate responses,\nbut nearly every odor\nis afforded meaning by\nlearning and experience.\nAnd that's why you like broccoli\nand I despise broccoli\nbecause I remember my mother\nforcing me to eat broccoli.\n- I'm so sorry.\n- Same sensory experience.\nYeah, all right.\nThis accommodates two important things.\nYeah, in the case of taste,\nyou have neurons at every station\nthat are for sweet, for sour,\nfor bitter, for salty, and umami.\nIt's only five classes,\nso it's not going to\ntake a lot of your brain.\nIf we can in fact smell a million odors\nand everyone of those odors\nhad to have predetermined meaning,\nthere's not going to be enough brain\njust to accommodate that one sense.\nAnd so evolution in its\ninfinite wisdom, [chuckles]\nevolve a system where you\nput together a pathway\nand a cortex, olfactory cortex,\nwhere you have the capacity\nto associate every odor\nin a specific context that\nnow gives it the meaning.\nNow,\nlet's go back to the\noriginal question then.\nSo odor then clearly\nplastic, mega plastic,\nbecause it's fundamental\nbasis and neural organization,\nbut taste, we just told you,\nthat's predetermined, hardwire.\nBut predetermined,\nhardwire, it doesn't mean\nthat it's not modulated\nby learning or experience.\nIt only means that you're born\nliking sweet and disliking bitter.\nAnd we have many examples of plasticity,\nbeer being one example.\nSo why do we learn to love beer is in...\nCoffee.\nIt's because it has an\nassociated gain to the system.\nAnd that gain to the system,\nthat positive valance that emerges\nout of that negative signal is sufficient\nto create that positive association.\nAnd in the case of beer,\nof course, is alcohol.\nThe feeling good that we get after\nis more than sufficient to say,\n\"I want to have more of this.\"\nAnd in the case of coffee, of course,\nis caffeine, activating a whole group\nof neurotransmitter systems\nthat give you that high\nassociated with coffee.\nSo yes, this taste system is changeable,\nit's malleable, and is subjected\nto learning and experience.\nBut unlike the olfactory system,\nit's restricted, yeah, in\nwhat you could do with it\nbecause it's goal\nis to allow you to get\nnutrients and survive.\nThe goal of the olfactory\nsystem is very different.\nIt's being used, not in our case\nbut in every animal species,\nto identify friend versus foe,\nto identify mate,\nto identify ecological\nniches they want to be in.\nSo it plays a very broad role\nthat then requires that\nit be set up, organized,\nand function in a very\ndifferent type of context.\nTaste is about, can we get the\nnutrients we need to survive?\nAnd can we ensure that we are\nattracted to the ones we need?\nAnd we averse to the ones\nthat are going to kill us.\n[gentle music]"
