    "transcript": "- What we'll do first is do the\nhypnotic conduction profile,\na formal test of how hypnotizable you are,\nand we'll take it from there, okay?\n- Okay.\n- Any questions before we go ahead?\n- No.\n- Okay.\nSo get as comfortable as you can,\nlook straight ahead.\nNow look up to the top of your head\nall the way up high as you can,\nkeep your chin down, that's it,\nlook up past your eyebrow all the way up,\nand as you keep looking up\nslowly close your eyes.\nGood, take a deep breath.\nHold ready,\nexhale, let the breath out,\nlet your eyes relax but keep them closed\nand let your body float.\nImagine you're floating\nsomewhere safe and comfortable\nlike a bath, a lake, a hot tub,\nyou're just floating in space.\nAnd while you concentrate on your body\nfloating into the chair,\nI'm going to concentrate\non your left hand and arm.\nIn a moment I'm going to\nstroke the middle finger\nof your left hand,\nwhen I do you develop a sense of tingling,\nand numbness, and lightness,\nand you'll let it float upwards, ready?\nThat's good.\nFirst, you may notice some\nrestless movement sensations\nin your fingers which will\nspread to your hand and arm,\nand you may get the\nsense of a magnetic pull\nas your elbow bends\nand your forearm floats\ninto an upright position.\nAll the way up higher and higher\nas the rest of your body\nfeels heavy and relaxed.\nEach breath deeper and easier,\nbreath in and then slowly exhale.\nHigher and higher.\nAlready exhale, that's good.\nThe higher it goes,\nthe lighter it'll feel.\nEach breath deeper and easier.\nNow I'm going to position your arm like so\nand give you this instruction.\nYour hand will remain light\nand in this upright position\neven after I give you the\nsignal for your eyes to open.\nIf I pull your hand\nback down to the table,\nit will float right back\nup to the upright position.\nYou'll find something pleasant and amusing\nabout this sensation.\nLater, when I touch your left elbow\nyour usual sensation\nand control will return.\nEach time you go into the\nstate of concentration\nyou'll find it easier and easier to use\nand you can use it to help you concentrate\non what's important to you.\nRight now,\nwe'll come out of the state\nof concentration together\nby counting backwards from three to one.\nOn three you'll get ready,\non two with your eyelids closed,\nroll up your eyes and\none, let your eyes open.\nReady?\nThree, two, one.\nGood.\nNow stay in this position please\nand describe what physical\nsensations you're aware of now\nin your left hand and arm.\n- Well, I'm feeling some\ntingling in my left hand.\n- Tingling.\n- Gentle tingling.\n- Is it comfortable?\n- Yes, very.\nMy body feels very, very relaxed.\n- Good.\n- And I feel like my\nshoulders are straight across\nfor the first time.\n- Great.\nDoes your left hand feel as if\nit's not as much a part of\nyour body as your right hand?\n- Yes, I only remembered\nI had my left hand\nwhen you asked that question.\n- Okay good.\nNow please note this.\n- Yeah, I don't know how to\ndescribe what just happened.\nI feel like I've got a hinge in my elbow\n- A hinge, all right.\nWell, look at your left hand and\nwatch what's going to happen.\n- Oh.\nThat's the reason.\nYeah, my hand doesn't really\nlook like it belongs to me.\n- Really?\n- I mean it does, but I don't know.\nI don't know why I can do this.\n- Can you describe what it\nfeels like as it's going up?\n- Yeah, it feels very relaxed,\nlike, I think it would be\nhard to hold it like this,\nbut it feels easy to hold it like this.\n- Good.\n- And I can still feel the middle finger\nmore than the others,\nI don't know why.\nYeah.\n- What?\nIs it surprising at all?\n- Yeah it's very unusual.\nYes, I know it's wild,\nbut I'm surprised by my own hand\nwhich that's not happened before.\n- All right, good.\nNow, by way of comparison,\nplease raise your right hand.\nPut your right arm down.\nAre you aware of a relative\ndifference in sensation\nin your left tan going\nup compared to right?\n- Yeah, the right hand feels more puppet,\nthis one's more a part of this part of me.\nYeah, it's like, I feel like\nI got my elbow everything,\nand my left elbow, everything changes.\n- Is one arm lighter or\nheavier than the other?\n- This my right is definitely heavier.\n- Are you were aware of\na relative difference\nin your sense of control\nover one hand going up\ncompared to the other?\n- Yeah, the left hand is,\nyeah, that's going to take some work\nto work with the left hand.\n- All right, so more control on the right?\n- Yes.\n- All right, now make\na fist with this hand,\ntight fist.\n- Okay.\n- Ready, open.\n- Open it?\n- Yeah, open it.\n- Okay.\n- Are you aware of a difference\nin sensation and control\nnow in your left hand and arm\ncompared to a moment before?\n- Yeah, but it still\nfeels kind of, not of me.\n- Not of you.\n- Yeah, a little bit.\nIt's coming back.\nWell, I don't ever think I've\never paid that much attention\nin my-\n- Left hand before.\n- Yeah.\n- Is the control equal\nnow in the two hands\nor you still feel?\n- Yeah, it's about,\nyou know, maybe 10% less over here.\n- Okay.\nSo before you had less control in the left\nnow it's getting to the same again.\nDid I do or say anything\nthat would indicate there'd\nbe a change in sensation\nof control in your left hand and arm?\n- Only the fist?\n- No I don't, making a fist.\n- Yeah.\n- Did I say anything\nto you about your elbow\nor touching your elbow?\n- Oh yeah, that when you touch my elbow,\nthat it would return control.\n- And did I-\n- But I don't remember it,\nI remember but I don't remember,\nbut only now that you told me.\nBut clearly something about\nmy perception of time is off,\n'cause I feel like that\nwas a long time ago.\n- A long time ago.\n- Yeah.\n- How long?\n- Oh goodness, I don't know\nbut it feels really\ngood to squeeze my fist.\n- It does, huh?\n- It feels amazing, yeah.\n- Did you have a sense of\nfloating lightness or buoyancy\nin your left hand and arm during the test?\n- Yes.\nAlmost like there was\na tether or something.\n- Tether pulling.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- Did you have that sense in\nany other part of your body,\nhead, neck, thigh,\nabdomen, chest all over,\nor just your left hand and arm?\n- Just my left hand and arm,\nbut the rest of my body is really relaxed-\n- Relaxed.\n- I always have a little\nbit of right side pain,\nlower back pain, always,\nand that feels good now.\n- It does.\n- Yeah, it does.\nAnd I can feel my feet too.\n- So are you feeling any pain in your-\n- No, no, no pain.\n- Good, good.\nOkay, so the hand is okay now?\n- Yeah, it's about 98%.\n- Okay, it's coming back.\nAll right, well that's the end of the test\nand your score is 9.5 out of 10\nso you are very hypnotizable.\n- Okay.\n- Yeah.\n- As gauged by,\nam I out of hypnosis yet?\n- I hope so,\nyes you are.\n- I don't know.\n- Well the eye roll that we did initially,\nyou had the up gaze as\nyou kept your eye up\nwas two out of four,\nbut you were converging your eyes\nand you can't keep looking up\nand squint at the same time.\nSo your eye roll score was a four.\n- Which is the maximum\n- That's the maximum.\n- Yeah, which is consistent\nwith the last time\nwe did hypnosis.\n- That's right.\n- I think it was about three years ago.\n- Yeah, was it that long ago?\n- Yeah.\n- I guess so, wow.\n- But then I hear your\nvoice in the Reveri app\n- Yeah.\n- And actually when we sat\ndown to do the interview today,\nwhen you start talking\nand even in our lab\nmeetings, occasionally,\nI have to remember that\nI'm not going to go under\nand our colleague, Dr.[indistinct]\nsays the same thing.\n- Really?\n- She's done a lot of hypnosis, yeah.\n- Oh really?\n- I don't think she'd mind me saying that.\nYeah. and that the voice\nis a strong trigger, so.\n- Interesting, I didn't know that\n- I think my hand's back.\n- You think it's back now?\nGood, well we want you\nto leave the room with it\nso that's good.\n- What happened there?\nI mean, what was that about?\n- Well, you're affiliating\nwith a metaphor,\nwith an image that it will\nfeel light and buoyant\nand you're dissociating it\nso I think it's in part that\nDLPFC inverse connectivity\nwith the PCC that you're sort\nof interoception of your arm\nis sort of separated from the task,\nthe hypnotic task of\nmaking this feel different.\nAnd so the implication is\nsort of that it's not you in a sense,\nthat the hand is sort of\ndoing what it wants to do\nis kind of what it feels like.\nAnd so you're complying\nwith the instruction,\nbut also showing that you can really\nreorganize your interoception\nof your left hand and arm,\nand also what it does physically so\n- I felt like from here forward\nwas a completely different experience.\n- Interesting, yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- Well, I think it is that sort of,\nit's the connection to the insular\nand the disconnection from the PCC\nthat I think is doing it, yeah.\nIs there anything that I\nshould pay attention for today?\nNo?\n- No, I don't think so,\nunless does it still\nfeel strange or is it?\n- I feel cohesive.\n- Oh good.\nSo you can turn it on,\nyou can turn it off,\nand that's the messages you-\n- And that's internal, right?\n- Yeah, that's internal, you can do it.\nAnd the fact that your\nback feels better now\nis a side effect that's good.\n- Yeah, there's something.\nYeah I remember saying\nsomething about my shoulders,\nbut the-\n- You said your shoulders\nfor the first time felt level.\n- Yeah I always got a little\nbit of a tilt this way\nand like yeah, it felt level.\n- Good, good.\n- Thank you.\n- You're welcome.\n[upbeat music]"
