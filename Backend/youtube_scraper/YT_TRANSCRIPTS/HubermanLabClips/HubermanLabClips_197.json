    "transcript": "- Assuming that most people\nwake up in the morning,\nas opposed to night\nshift workers, et cetera,\nwe could talk about later,\nbut they wake up in the morning,\nso let's divide the day into quarters.\nWhat is the proper way\nto interact with light\nin the first part of the day?\n- So I honestly think the\neasiest thing is waking up,\nget as much light as you can.\n- Into your eyes?\n- Yeah, it's really nice.\nYour system is primed.\nIf you're entrained it's\nprimed to get light,\nthe sun should be out.\nMost animals in the wild,\nthey actually seem to track the sun.\nThe sun has a huge\ninfluence on life on earth.\nIt's actually life on\nearth is because of sun.\nSo, that's easy.\nIn the morning, when you\nwake up, you need light.\n- Okay, so what is the behavioral practice\nthat you recommend?\nLet's say somebody is in a condition\nwhere there's a lot of cloud cover.\nIs it important to get outside?\n- So I have to tell you, the cloudiest day\nis going to be much more\nbrighter than your room.\nYou could ask any photographer.\nA cloudy day, unless it's\nreally dark, dark clouds,\nusually cloudy days\nhave much more bright outside\nthan inside your room,\neven when you have good\nlighting inside the room.\nSo I think in the outside is\nusually, even when it's cloudy,\nyou're going to get to enough intensity\nto help you adjust your\ncycle to the day/night cycle.\n- So how long do you,\nthese are general rules of thumb,\nbut how long do you\nrecommend people go outside?\n- If you do it daily,\nyou possibly need very\n[indistinct] if you do it daily,\nbecause, remember this thing\nis going to happen on a daily matter.\n- So the clock is tracking\nit on a regular basis?\n- Absolutely, it's photon\ncounting, it's tracking.\nI would say 15 minutes.\nIf you don't do it daily,\nyou may want to increase it.\nAnd we'll talk about when\nyou travel what you can do.\nBut, yeah, 15 minutes should be fine.\nYou do it more, it doesn't hurt.\n- And through a window,\nmy understanding is that through a window,\nit dramatically decreases\nthe amount of light energy.\n- It depends on how, you know,\nhow thick the windows are\nand how dark they are.\nSo it's, but it's also nice to go outside\nand to feel the seasons.\n- Sunglasses off?\n- I don't use sunglasses.\n- Yeah, but you have your\nJordanian photo pigment, you know,\nso, yeah, whereas my eyes\nare very sensitive, right?\n- But I personally, you\nknow, if I'm in the shade,\nor if it's not incredibly bright,\nI try to, especially in the morning,\nbut I'm also an early person,\nso we have to differentiate\nbetween early and...\n- What time do you wake up?\n- I wake up at 4:30 in the morning.\n- But the sun isn't...\n- It's not out yet.\n- So what do you do, you\nturn on artificial lights?\n- I usually don't turn on artificial light\nbecause I know the sun is\ngoing to come up eventually,\nbut that's why I don't like\nthe change in the timing that they do.\n- Wait, but what do you do\nbetween 4:30 AM and 7:00 AM?\n- I mean, I just look at\nmy computer and my phone.\n- Oh, I see.\n- So possibly I get enough light,\nbut in reality, I mean,\nas long as you let your body\nget the morning sunlight,\nwhich I think is really, to me,\nand I, there is no evidence\nfor this, but to me,\nthis is, if you look\nat all animals, plants,\nthis morning sunlight\nseems to be very important.\nAnd I, you know, we don't\nhave experiments to show it,\nbut I have a gut feeling\nthat it has a huge impact on humans.\n- Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab\nat the Stanford sleep lab\nhas shown that these early\nmorning light flashes\ncan adjust the total amount\nof sleep that one will get.\nIt makes it easier to get into sleep.\n- Absolutely, absolutely.\n- Okay, So...\n- And Ken Wright\nalso did these beautiful camping\nexperiments that showed...\n- Right, maybe she could describe those,\nbecause those are beautiful experiments.\n- They are beautiful experiments.\nHe took these, you know, college students\nthat had a late onset of\nsleep and late waking time.\nAnd then he said, let's go camping\nand just don't use any artificial light.\nAnd you could go to sleep as\nlate or as early as you want,\nand wake up as late, as early.\nAnd he found a huge shift\nin their sleep pattern\njust by exposing them\nto the light/dark cycle.\nI mean, so...\n- And it lasted.\n- And it lasted.\n- Even after they came back.\nI think it was two days of camping\nreset the circadian clock.\n- Seven days, but it lasted, yeah.\nIt's pretty amazing, yeah,\nit's really incredible.\n- Okay, so get bright light\nof some sort early in the day,\nideally sunlight, even on a cloudy day\nit's going to be brighter\nthan indoor light.\nSo that's easy, okay, so then?\n- And the other thing\nthat I would like to mention to people,\nif you think it's very dim outside,\nlet's say it's very cloudy, stay longer.\nSo remember, intensity\nis only one component.\nDuration is also important\nbecause, remember,\nthe circadian system is\nnot like the image system.\nIn the image system, you\nhave to change every second\nbecause you're looking\nat different objects,\nyou have to change your perception.\nBut for the circadian system,\nit's trying to figure out\nwhere am I in the day/night cycle.\nSo the more you give them the information,\nthe better you are.\nSo if it's very bright,\nyou don't need a lot,\nbecause it's clearly going\nto make you fire like crazy.\nBut if it's not bright, stay longer,\nstay for one hour, you know,\nhave your coffee outside,\nor something like that.\nIt's just going to help.\n- I think you said something\nextremely important,\nwhich is that the circadian system\nis trying to figure out\nwhen you are in time.\n- Exactly.\n- Not where you are in space.\n- Sorry, I said where you are\nin time, I meant when you are.\n- Oh no, no, I wasn't correcting you.\nI just meant that it,\nI think fundamentally\nthat's the incredible thing\nabout the system, that\nyou have this clock,\nthis 24-hour clock in your brain,\nbut it needs to be\nsynchronized to the outside.\nSo, could we go a little deeper\ninto this circadian setting behavior\nand come up with some\ngeneral rules of thumb?\nSo let's say it's a very\nbright day, extremely bright,\nyou know, no clouds, sun's out.\nYou said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.\n- I'll tell you, if you're sensitive,\nyou don't even have to go in the sun.\nYou could be in the shade.\nThere's going to be so many\nphotons out there in the shade.\nIt's going to be perfect.\nYou don't even have to see the sun.\nYou don't have to have the sun.\nYou know, it's great for vitamin D.\nThat's a different story.\nYou could do this for your skin and,\nand, you know, protect your skin.\nThat's not my area of expertise.\nBut for, for that effect\non the circadian system,\nas long as you're outside in\nthe shade and it's a sunny day,\n10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.\n- Okay, and then let's, let's\nsay it's kind of overcast.\nYou know, it's not particularly bright,\nor there's, you know, solid cloud cover,\nbut you know, obviously the sun is out,\nbut it's not as bright.\nHow long do you think it\nwould take to set the clock?\n- 10 to 15 should be sufficient.\nStay for half an hour, stay for 45 minutes\nif it's very dark cloud,\nyeah, stay for longer.\n[upbeat music]"
