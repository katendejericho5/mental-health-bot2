    "video_title": "Do We Have Free Will? | Robert Sapolsky & Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "- Along the lines of choice,\nI'd like to shift gears slightly\nand talk about free will,\nabout our ability to make choices at all.\n- Well, my personal way out in left field\ninflammatory stance is\nI don't think we have\na shred of free will.\nDespite, you know, 95% of philosophers,\nand I think probably the majority\nof neuroscientists saying\nthat we have free will in\nat least some circumstances,\nI don't think there's any at all.\nAnd the reason for this\nis you do something,\nyou behave, you make a choice, whatever.\nAnd to understand why you did that\nand where did that intention come from,\npart of it was due to\nthe sensory environment\nyou were in in the previous minute.\nSome of it is from the hormone levels\nin your bloodstream that morning.\nSome of it is from whether\nyou had a wonderful\nor stressful last three months\nand what sort of neuroplasticity happened.\nPart of it is what hormone levels\nyou were exposed to as a fetus.\nPart of it is what culture\nyour ancestors came up with\nand thus how you were\nparented when you were a kid.\nAll of those are in there,\nand you can't understand\nwhere is coming from\nwithout incorporating all of those.\nAnd at that point,\nnot only are there all of\nthese relevant factors,\nbut they're ultimately all one factor.\nIf you're talking about\nwhat evolution has to\ndo with your behavior,\nby definition you're also\ntalking about genetics.\nIf you're talking about\nwhat your genes have to do with behavior,\nby definition you're talking about\nhow your brain was constructed\nor what proteins are coded for.\nIf you're talking about\nlike your mood disorder now,\nyou're talking about the sense of efficacy\nyou were getting as a five-year-old.\nThey're all intertwined.\nAnd when you look at all those influences,\nbasically the challenge is,\nshow me a neuron that\njust caused that behavior,\nor show me a network of neurons\nthat just caused that behavior,\nand show me that nothing about\nwhat they just did was influenced\nby anything from the sensory\nenvironment one second ago\nto the evolution of your species.\nAnd there's no space in there\nto fit in a freewill concept\nthat winds up being, you know,\nin your brain, but not of your brain.\nThere's simply no wiggle\nroom for it there.\n- So I can appreciate that our behaviors\nand our choices are the consequences\nof a long line of dominoes that\nfell prior to that behavior.\nBut, is it possible that I can intervene\nin the domino effect so to speak?\nIn other words, can my recognition\nof the fact that genes have heritability,\nthere's an epigenome, that\nthere's a hormonal context,\nthere's a historical context,\ncan the knowledge of that give me\nsome small, small shard of free will?\nMeaning, does it allow\nme to say, ah, okay,\nI accept that my choices\nare somewhat predetermined,\nand yet knowing that gives me\nsome additional layer of control.\nIs there any philosophical\nor biological universe\nin which that works?\n- Nah.\nAll of that can produce the\nwonderfully positive belief\nthat change can happen.\nEven traumatic change, you know,\nthe worst of circumstances,\nmost unlikely people\nand change can happen.\nThings can change.\nDon't be fatalistic.\nDon't decide because we're\nmechanistic biological machines\nthat nothing can ever, change can happen,\nbut where people go off\nthe rails is translating\nthat into we can change ourselves.\nWe don't, we can't because\nthere's no free will.\nHowever we can be changed by circumstance.\nAnd the point of it is,\nyou look at an Aplysia, a sea slug,\nthat has learned to retract its gil\nin response to a shock on its tail.\nYou can do like conditioning,\nPavlovian conditioning on it,\nand it is learned,\nits behavior has been\nchanged by its environment.\nAnd you hear news about something\nlike horrifically depressing going on\nand refugees in wherever,\nand as a result, you feel\na little bit more helpless\nand a less of a sense of\nefficacy in the world,\nand both of your behaviors\nhave been changed.\nOkay, okay, yeah, I guess,\nbut the remarkable thing is\nit's the exact same neurobiology.\nThe signal transduction\npathways that were happening\nin that sea snail incorporate\nthe exact same kinases, and\nproteases, and phosphatases\nthat we do when you're having\nmammalian fear conditioning.\nor when you're alert, it's conserved.\nIt's the exact same thing\nit's simply playing out\nin obviously a much, much fancier domain.\nAnd because you have learned\nthat change is possible\ndespite understanding mechanistically\nthat we can't change\nourselves volitionally,\nbut because you understand\nchange is possible,\nyou have just changed\nthe ability of your brain\nto respond to optimistic stimuli,\nand you have changed the\nability of your brain\nto now send you in the\ndirection of being exposed\nto more information\nthat will seem cheerful\nrather than depressing.\nOh my God, that's amazing\nwhat Nelson Mandela\nand Martin Luther King\nand all these folks did.\nWow, under the most\nadverse of circumstances\nthey were able to do, maybe I can also.\nMaybe I can go read more\nabout people like them\nto get even more data points\nof changed neurochemistry\nso that your responses are different now.\nAnd you know you're\ntilted a little bit more\nin that direction of feeling\nlike you can make a difference\ninstead of it's all damn hopeless.\nSo enormous change can happen,\nbut the last thing that could come out\nof a view of we are nothing more or less\nthan the sum of our biology\nand its interaction with environment\nis to throw up your hands and say,\nand thus it's no use\ntrying to change anything.\n- So we can acknowledge\nthat change is extremely\nhard to impossible,\nthat circumstances can change,\nand yet that striving to\nbe better human beings\nis still a worthwhile endeavor.\n- Do I have that correct?\n- Absolutely, because simply the knowledge\neither from experience\nor making it to the end of\nthe right neurobiology class\nhas taught you that change can happen\nwithin a framework of a\nmechanistic neurobiology.\nYou are now more open\nto being made optimistic\nby the good news in the world around you.\nYou are more likely to be\ninspired by this or that.\nYou are more resistant to\ngetting discouraged by bad news,\nsimply because you now\nunderstand it's possible.\n[light rock music]"
