    "transcript": "I'm interested in this concept of burnout.\nYeah.\nWe hear about burnout.\nWe associate with too much\nadrenaline, lack of sleep,\ntired and wired, feeling disengaged.\nThe poet, David White,\nhas a beautiful poem,\nI forget the title about\nburnout where he says that,\nI think the cure to burnout\nis wholeheartedness.\nAnd I always like that\nit's a bit more abstract\nthan the kinds of things\nwe're talking about today.\nBut I like that\nbecause there's something\nabout wholeheartedness,\nreally leaning into something\nwith the true desire to be\nthere and to explore it,\nno matter how hard,\nthat is the opposite extreme of burnout.\nYeah. Well, I mean, I think burnout in,\nif we're thinking knowledge work,\nlike people with office\njobs, my diagnosis there,\nit's not exactly quantity of\nwork, that does play a role.\nIt's the kind of work, because\nI think what's happening,\nwhat's been deranging actually\nfor people in these jobs\nis workloads are getting larger,\nin part because communication\nis low friction,\nand we always want to be\ndemonstrating activity\nbecause of pseudo productivity,\nand people are always\nasking us to do things\nand we say yes.\nEverything we say yes to\nbrings with it administrative\noverhead, right?\nWhich is talking about the\nthing, but not actually doing it.\nSo it's like emails about the commitment,\nit's meetings about the commitment,\nbecause our workloads are larger,\nwhat happens then is\nmore and more of our time\nhas to service this\nadministrative overhead\nbecause everything we say yes to\nbrings with it its own overhead,\nit adds up, it aggregates, right?\nSo now more and more of our\nday is spent talking about work\nand not actually doing the work,\nand then make it even worse,\nit's not like this overhead\nis all batched together,\nit's sort of spread out\nthroughout your day.\nSo it's also putting you in that state\nof constant distraction, which\nmakes it hard to do work.\nWhat I think is burning people out\nis they're now in this\nstate where they're saying,\nI'm spending most of my\nday talking about work,\nsending emails, attending meetings.\nVery little time is left to actually\nmake progress on the work,\nand then the workload\ngets larger and larger.\nThis by itself is deranging, right?\nIt feels like you're in some\nsort of nihilistic experiment.\nLike, what is this?\nWhy do I have six hours of meetings?\nI'm not actually, this can't\nbe the right way to work\nand then what happens of course\nis you have to recover\ntime in the morning,\nin the afternoon, maybe\nafter kids go to bed\nto try to actually make progress.\nSo now you also have just a\nstraight work quantity issue.\nSo you're working more hours,\nthere's an energy drain.\nBut I think that psychological piece\nof this can't possibly make sense.\nThat like, I am checking\nemail once every two minutes\nand spent six hours in Zoom,\nlike doing very little\nactual high value work.\nLike this can't be the right way to work.\nThat's what I think the\nburnout epidemic right now\nis coming from is that\npsychological component\nof, we all know this is stupid,\nbut no one is saying the\nemperor has no clothes on.\nWe all know that the amount of\nemail and meetings I'm doing\nis such a waste of my salary.\nLike this is a highly trained brain,\nlike I could be writing\nthese reports or this code\nor creating these business strategies,\nbut we're all just accepting this.\nI think the absurdity\nof the current situation\nis creating as much of the burnout\nas it is just, we also have\nto add these extra hours.\nThere's just like a straight\naggregation of work quantity.\nIt's almost analogous to\ntaking professional athletes\nor would be professional athletes\nand having them do a bunch\nof other physical labor\nso that they're showing\nup not fresh for the game\nand little micro injuries\nand distracted and-\nAnd no one's admitting that\nthis doesn't make sense\nand everyone's just getting injured\nand no one's talking about it.\nSo it's the absurdity of it\nwould drive people crazy,\nand it is driving people crazy.\nIt's so difficult though\nbecause certain things\nlike smartphones are very\nuseful on the hospital ward.\nI mean, doctors can communicate,\nnurses communicate so much faster now,\nparents and kids can communicate,\nWho's going to pick up the kids?\nNope, got stuck in\ntraffic. You go this way.\nAlternate route on Google\nmaps and, and on and on.\nSo it's all woven in with stuff\nthat's also highly adaptive.\nIt makes it tough.\nYeah.\nYou know, it's almost like the work\nof being a selective filter-\nYeah.\nis half the work of trying to\ndeload the cognitive systems\nthat would allow you to do deep work.\nYeah, well and the workplace\nis even harder than that\nbecause part of the\nissue is email and Slack,\nlet's just say digital communication.\nI spent a lot of time\nstudying that closely, right?\nFrom like a techno critic standpoint,\nthe introduction\nof digital communication to the workplace\nand the problem there is the reason why\nwe're checking this all the time,\nit's not some like individual\nhabit de optimization.\nIt's not, oh, I should\njust check this less often.\nWhat happened is when we introduced\nlow friction digital\ncommunication to the office,\nthis emerging consensus came about\nthat said, great, let's\njust use ad hoc messaging\nas our major way of collaborating.\nLike we can just figure\nthings out on the fly.\nI can just be like,\nAndrew, what's going on with the whatever?\nAnd you can answer me\nand I can send it back.\nThis was very convenient,\nthe activation cost was low\nand so this is how we began\nactually collaborating on work.\nNow what happens is as\nworkloads get higher,\nwe now have many things at the same time,\nthey're all generating these asynchronous\nback and forth conversations.\nMost of these have some sort\nof time sensitivity, right?\nSo if I email you and say like,\nwhat's going on with like the\nguests coming later today?\nwe have to kind of resolve\nthis before later today\nso now, it's not just that these messages\nare going back and forth with\nall these different threads,\nbut I have to keep checking my inbox\nto make sure the gap's not too big.\nThis is not a failure of habits,\nit's not a moral failure,\nit's necessitated by the fact\nthat all these back\nand forth conversations\nhave to keep moving forward.\nSo it is difficult then\nif you're in this system\nto step out by yourself\nbecause this is the\nway we're collaborating\nis these asynchronous\nback and forth messages\nand I can't disengage myself from that\nwithout slowing things down.\nLike from a mathematical\ngame theory point of view,\nit's a suboptimal nash equilibrium.\nIt's not the right place, not\nthe right way to run this,\nthe utility value of this\nconfiguration is low,\nbut no one individual can\ndeploy a different strategy\nthat's going to be higher value.\nWe're stuck in it, right?\nAnd so now it becomes really\nhard for an individual\njust to say, I want to\ncheck my email less often.\nIt's built in systemically\ninto this hyperactive hive mind workflow\nand the only way to break free\nfrom the suboptimal configuration\nis to basically have\nthe organization itself\ndo like a really high cost\nchange to the rules of the game.\nThese are how we're collaborating now.\nWe're not using email freely anymore.\nWe're going to use this system instead.\nHere, it it's a very\nexpensive top down procedure\nto free ourselves from the suboptimality.\nIt's like in the world of work,\nthat's partially why this is\nsuch an intractable problem\nand I tried to write a\nbook about this recently\nand it was really hard to gain traction\nbecause it's not easy to solve this.\nLike no individual can move out of this,\nand you have to put in a lot\nof energy as an organization\nto try to change this.\nSo, in some sense, email\nis a more insidious problem\nthan social media on the phone,\nbecause at least over here,\nthis is my engagement with this\nand I might have these\nmoderate behavioral addictions,\nbut I could make differences here.\nIn my company, oh, this is much worse.\nThis is like a systemic problem.\nIt's an emergent deterministic work impact\non a economic, social, cultural system\nthat was completely dynamical\nand went in a way we didn't really expect.\nSo it's a really tough\nsituation sometimes,\nespecially in the world of work.\nHow do we get out of this\nconstant distraction?\nIt's why, you know, I wrote \"Deep Work\"\nand I was like, well, why\ndon't people just do this?\nThat's why they don't just do this\nbecause it's not so easy\nto reclaim this time.\nWell, it's like when I was a\ngraduate student in postdoc,\nI was focused on eating pretty well,\nmeaning just cleanish food\nand people talked less\nabout that at that time.\nYeah.\nI was also really committed\nto exercise since I was 16,\npeople were less committed to that\nin the academic sector at that time.\nNow I think it's commonplace for people.\nLike, I'm going to my yoga class,\nI'm doing my zone two\ncardio, I go to the gym,\nyou know, men and women do this.\nYeah.\nI remember having like this\nlike sneak off to the gym\nlike yeah, yeah and you know,\nyou felt like a bit of an odd ball\nif you were the one bringing your lunch\nto the, you know, the pizza luncheon.\nYeah.\nNot that there's anything\nwrong with pizza, love pizza\nbut I was trying to eat well.\nI have for a long time.\nI feel better when I do and\nI'm grateful that I did.\nBut you get some weird looks like,\n\"Oh, do you have an eating\ndisorder or something like that?\"\nThat's what people would say then.\nYep.\nNow people would probably look, you know,\nthat looks better than the pizza\npeople start to understand.\nSo I think there needs\nto be a cultural shift.\nYep.\nAnd I think there has\nbeen a cultural shift\naround food and exercise.\nCertainly food, meditation, sleep.\nYep.\nI think people are far more accepting\nand actually encouraging of their workers\nand coworkers taking really good care\nin order to function better for longer.\nYeah. I think it's going\nto be the next revolution\nand it's going to be a revolution\nthat's going to unlock,\nwe're talking on the scale of\nlike a trillion dollar GBP.\nWhen we go through knowledge\nwork and have this revolution,\nI call it like the cognitive revolution.\nLet's take really seriously how\nthe brains our workers work.\nLike these are our number one assets.\nLike, not to be too mechanistic about it,\nbut what is our main capital asset\nif we're a knowledge work organization?\nWe have some buildings, but\nit's really these brains\nthat we have like\nemployment contracts with.\nThese brains create value.\nLet's take seriously how\nthe brains actually operate\nand as soon as we do,\nwe'll say, \"Oh my god,\nthese brains are checking\nemail once every two minutes.\nWhat a disaster.\"\nIt's like if we had a car\nfactory and we spent $20 million\non one of these German\nrobots that can, you know,\nput cars on the doors or whatever\nand we just weren't taking care of it\nand it was like rusty and\nit was dropping the doors\nand the production\npipeline was going down.\nIt's like, this is crazy,\nwe got to take care of\nthis equipment, right?\nWhen we have the cognitive revolution,\nthe sort of cognitive capital\nrevolution and knowledge work,\nI think it's going to unlock\na trillion dollar GDP.\nI think that's how\nunproductive we've been.\nIf we just think in the pure raw terms\nof brains producing\nstuff that's worth money.\nLike if we're just like\nsuper deterministic\nand kind of inhumane about\nit, so much is being lost\nbecause we're in these\nsuboptimal nash equilibriums,\neveryone just email everyone all the time,\neveryone's just on Slack all the time,\nthat when we finally have the\nrevolution to get over that,\nit's going to be a massive economic hit.\nAnd you know, AI might\nplay a role in this, right?\nBecause maybe AI, once it\ngets planning capabilities,\nis going to be able to take the burden\nof some of the back and forth planning,\nI think it's easier to get\nthere with cultural shifts,\nI don't think we have to wait to build\nan email capable Chat GPT to do this,\nlike you could solve this tomorrow,\nThis is cultural as\nmuch as it's tool based.\nBut I think it's going\nto be a huge revolution\nwhen we get there.\nAkin to like the assembly\nline in manufacturing,\nwhich was like a 10x improvement\nin productivity metrics,\nwhen we figured out the\ncontinuous motion assembly line\nwith interchangeable parts was a massive,\nit created this productivity engine,\nI'm using the economic\nsense of productivity now,\nyou know, dollars per\nworker, the economic miracle\nthat came from this process-based\nindustrial innovations\nin the late 19th, early 20th century\nthat the money generated by that,\nthe wealth generated by that\nwas the foundation of the modern west.\nLike the whole world as\nwe know it was built.\nSo there's these huge latent potentials,\nand right now I don't think\nwe're there with the brain\nand I think it's going\nto be a huge revolution.\nIt's just difficult, right?\nIt's not an easy revolution to start,\nbut I think it's going to\nchange whole industries\nin ways that we're not, it's\ngoing to be hard to even imagine.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full\nlength episode by clicking here."
