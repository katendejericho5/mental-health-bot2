    "transcript": "- What happens when somebody has a glass,\nwe always hear a glass or\ntwo of wine in the evening,\nor a cocktail after\ndinner or before dinner,\nhow does that impact their sleep?\nAnd then we will be sure to circle back\nin terms of what is\nreasonable ranges of behavior\nwhen it comes to avoiding alcohol,\nor if it's age appropriate, et cetera,\nenjoying alcohol.\n- Yeah.\nSo alcohol, if we're thinking\nabout classes of drugs,\nthey're in a class of drugs\nthat we call the sedatives.\nAnd I think one of the first problems that\npeople often mistake alcohol is often used\nas a sleep aid for people who\nare struggling with sleep,\nwhen things like over the\ncounter remedies, et cetera,\nor herbal remedies, have\njust not worked out for them.\nAnd alcohol, unfortunately,\nis anything but a sleep aid.\nThe first reason that most people use it\nis to try and help them fall asleep.\n- And this process of, this event\nthat we call falling asleep I\nhave to imagine is a process.\n- It is a process.\n- Like everything in biology.\nAnd that that process\ninvolves in some way,\nas we talked about push-pull before,\nturning off thinking, planning, et cetera,\nand turning on some sort\nof relaxation mechanism.\nI have to imagine that these two things\nare knobs turning in opposite\ndirections that gives us this\noutcome we call falling asleep.\nAlcohol it seems is\nhelpful for some people\nto turn off their thoughts\nor their planning.\nIs that right?\n- Right, yeah.\nYes, it is, and so I think\nif we look at the pattern\nof brain activity,\nif I were to place you\ninside an MRI scanner,\nwhere we're looking at\nthe activity of your brain\nand watch you drifting off,\nsome parts of your brain\nwill become less active.\nOther parts will become more active.\nAnd this is the push-pull model,\nit's inhibition, excitation.\nBut alcohol is quite\ndifferent in that regard.\nAlcohol is, because it's a sedative,\nwhat it's really doing is trying to\nessentially knock out your cortex.\nIt's sedating your cortex.\nAnd sedation is not sleep.\nBut when we have a couple\nof drinks in the evening,\nwhen we have a couple of nightcaps,\nwe mistake sedation for sleep, saying,\nwell, I always, when I\nhave a couple of whiskeys\nor a couple of cocktails,\nit always helps me fall asleep faster.\nIn truth what's happening is that\nyou're losing consciousness quicker,\nbut you're not necessarily falling\nnaturalistically asleep any quicker.\nSo that's one of the first\nsort of things just to keep in mind.\nThe second thing with alcohol\nis that it fragments your sleep.\nAnd we spoke about the\nquality of your sleep\nbeing just as important as the quantity.\nAnd alcohol, through a\nvariety of mechanisms,\nsome of which are activation\nof that autonomic nervous system,\nthat fight or flight branch\nof the nervous system,\nalcohol will actually have you waking up\nmany more times throughout the night,\nso your sleep is far less continuous.\nNow, some of those awakenings will be of\nconscious recollection the next day.\nYou'll just remember waking up.\nMany of them won't be.\nBut yet your sleep will\nbe littered with these\nsort of punctured awakenings\nthroughout the night.\nAnd again, when you wake\nup the next morning,\nyou don't feel restored by your sleep.\nFragmented sleep or non-continuous sleep\nin this alcohol-induced way is usually not\ngood quality sleep that you\nfeel great on the next day.\nThe third part of alcohol\nin terms of an equation\nis that it's quite potent\nat blocking your REM sleep,\nyour rapid eye movement sleep.\nAnd REM sleep is critical for\na variety of cognitive functions,\nsome aspects of learning and memory.\nIt seems to be critical for aspects of\nemotional and mental health.\n- You've described it before as a sort of\nself-generated therapy\nthat occurs while we sleep.\n- Yeah, it's overnight therapy.\nIt's emotional first aid.\n- Well, certainly people\nthat don't get enough sleep\nare very easy to derail emotionally.\nNot that one would want\nto do that to people,\nbut we all sort of fall apart emotionally.\nI always think of it as almost\nlike our skin sensitivity\ncan be heightened when\nwe are sleep deprived.\nOur emotional sensitivity is such that\nwhen we're sleep deprived such that\nit takes a much finer grain of sandpaper\nto create that kind of friction.\nThings bother us.\n- Threshold to trigger.\n- Even online comments\nbother us when we're sleep deprived.\nAnd never when we're rested.\n- I would love to say\nthat I never look at them,\nexcept I look at...\nMaybe every one of them-\n- Here I will editorialize,\nbecause the notion of\nnot looking at comments\nis unreasonable to ask of any academic.\nBecause academics, we are all trained\nto look at our teaching evaluations.\nAnd just like with online\ncomments, to ignore 20% of them.\nNo, I'm kidding. We look at them all.\nIn any event, so in terms of\ntranslating this to behavior,\nI don't particularly enjoy alcohol.\nI guess I might be\nfortunate in that sense.\nBut I also have never really experienced\nthe pleasure of drinking alcohol.\nI sometimes like the taste of a drink,\nbut I never like the sensation,\nso I don't have a lot of\nfamiliarity with this.\nBut many people do, and I understand that.\nSo let's say somebody\nenjoys a glass of wine\nor two with dinner and\nthey eat dinner at 7:00 PM.\nIs that likely to disrupt\ntheir sleep at all?\nLet's make this a series of gradations.\n- Yeah, and the answer is yes.\nI think one study just looked\nat a single glass of wine\nin the evening with dinner,\nand I would be untruthful if I didn't just\nsimply say it has an effect,\nand we can measure that in terms of-\n- Less REM sleep.\n- Less REM sleep.\nAnd one of the fascinating studies,\nI can't remember what dose.\nI think they got them close to\na standard illegal blood alcohol level.\nSo maybe they were a little bit tipsy.\nAnd yes, you see all of the\nchanges that we just described.\nThey sort of lose\nconsciousness more quickly,\nthey have fragmented sleep,\nand they have a significant\nreduction in REM sleep.\nBut what was also interesting,\nbecause REM sleep, as\nwe spoke about before,\nis a time when some hormonal systems\nare essentially recharged and refreshed.\nGrowth hormone being one of them.\nThere was well over a 50%, five zero,\ndrop in their growth hormone release\nduring alcohol-laced sleep at night,\n[upbeat music]"
