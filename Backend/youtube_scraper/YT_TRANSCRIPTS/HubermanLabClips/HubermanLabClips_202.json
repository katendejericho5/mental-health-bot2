    "transcript": "- What is sleep?\n- Sleep is probably the\nsingle most effective thing\nyou can do to reset your\nbrain and body health.\nSo that's a functional answer in terms of,\nwhat is sleep in terms of its benefits?\nSleep as a process though\nis an incredibly complex\nphysiological ballet.\nAnd if you were to recognize\nor see what happens\nto your brain and your\nbody at night during sleep,\nyou would be blown away.\nAnd the paradox is that most of us,\nand I would think this too if\nI wasn't a sleep scientist,\nwe go to bed, we lose consciousness\nfor seven to nine hours,\nand then we sort of wake up in the morning\nand we generally feel better.\nAnd in some ways that\ndenies the physiological\nand biological beauty of sleep.\nSo upstairs in your brain,\nwhen you're going through\nthese different stages of sleep,\nthe changes in brainwave\nactivity are far more dramatic\nthan those that we see when we're awake.\nAnd we can speak about deep\nsleep and what happens there.\nREM sleep is a fascinating time,\nwhich is another stage of\nsleep often called dream sleep,\nwhich is rapid eye movement sleep.\nThat stage of sleep,\nsome parts of your brain\nare up to 30% more active\nthan when you're awake.\nSo again, it's kind of violating this idea\nthat our mind is dormant\nand our body is just simply\nquiescent and resting.\nSo I would happy to sort of double click\non either one of those\nand also what changes in the body as well.\nBut it is an intense\nevolutionary adaptive benefit\nand system, that said, though,\nI would almost push back\nagainst an evolved system\nwhen we think about the question\nof sleep and what sleep is.\nOur assumption has always\nbeen that we evolved to sleep\nand I've actually questioned that.\nAnd I have no way to get in a time capsule\nand go back and prove this.\nBut what if we started off sleeping\nand it was from sleep\nthat wakefulness emerged?\nWhy do we assume that\nit's the other way around?\nAnd I think there's probably\nsome really good evidence\nthat sleep may have been the proto-state,\nthat it was the basic\nfundamental living state.\nAnd when we became awake, as it were,\nwe always had to return to sleep.\nIn some ways at that point,\nsleep was the price that\nwe paid for wakefulness.\nAnd that's another way of\ndescribing what sleep is.\nBut again, I think it sort of\ndenies that the active state\nof sleep, it's not a passive\nstate of sleep either.\nAnd then finally you\ncan say, what is sleep\nacross different species\nand in us human beings\nand in all mammalian species\nand avian species as well,\nsleep is broadly separated\ninto these two main types.\nAnd we've got non-rapid eye\nmovement sleep on the one hand,\nand then we've got rapid eye\nmovement sleep on the other,\nand we can speak about how\nthey unfold across the night\nand their architecture because\nit's not just intellectually\ninteresting from the\nperspective of what sleep is.\nIt's also practically\nimpactful for our daily lives.\nAnd I'd love to sort of\ngo down that route, too,\nbut you navigate you, you tell me, I can-\n- No, no, let's definitely\ngo down that route.\nSo you mentioned how active the brain is\nduring certain phases of sleep.\nWhen I was coming up\nin science, REM sleep,\nrapid eye movement sleep was referred to\nas paradoxical sleep.\n- Yeah.\n- Is that still a good\nway to think about it?\nParadoxical because the brain is so active\nand yet we are essentially\nparalyzed, correct?\n- Yeah, it really is a paradox.\nAnd where that came from was\nsimply the brainwave recordings\nthat if all I'm measuring about you\nis your brainwave activity,\nit's very difficult for me\nsitting outside of the sleep\nlaboratory room to figure out,\nare you awake or are you in REM sleep?\nBecause those two\npatterns of brain activity\nare so close to one another,\nyou can't discriminate between them.\nYet the paradox is that\nwhen you are awake,\nI go in there and you're\nsort of sitting up,\nyou're clearly conscious and awake,\nbut yet when you go into REM sleep,\nyou are completely paralyzed.\nAnd I think that's part of the paradox,\nbut the paradox really just comes down\nto two dramatically\ndifferent conscious states.\nYet brain activity is dramatically\nmore similar than different.\nAnd the way I can figure out\nwhich of the two you are in\nis by measuring two other signals,\nthe activity from your eyes\nand the activity from your muscles.\nSo when we're awake, we will\noccasionally have these blinks\nand we'll have sort of saccades,\nBut during REM sleep, you\nhave these really bizarre,\nhorizontal shuttling eye\nmovements that occur.\nAnd that's where the name comes\nfrom, rapid eye movements.\n- Are they always horizontal?\n- Mostly they are horizontal.\n- That's interesting.\n- And that's one of the ways\nthat we can differentiate them\nfrom other waking eye movement activity,\n'cause it's not always like,\nit can be sometimes horizontal,\nbut can it also have diagonal\nand also vertical in that plane.\nBut then the muscle activity\nis the real dead giveaway.\nJust before you enter REM\nsleep, your brain stem,\nwhich is where the\ndynamics of non-REM and REM\nare essentially played out\nand then expressed upstairs\nin the cortex and downstairs in the body,\nwhen we go into REM sleep\nand just a few seconds\nbefore that happens, the\nbrainstem sends a signal\nall the way down the spinal\ncord, and it communicates\nwith what are called\nthe alpha motor neurons\nin the spinal cord which control\nthe voluntary skeletal muscles.\nAnd it's a signal of paralysis.\nAnd when you go into dream\nsleep, you are locked\ninto a physical incarceration\nof your own body.\n- Amazing.\n- You know, why,\nwhy would mother nature do such a thing?\nAnd it's in some ways, very simple.\nThe brain paralyzes the body\nso that the mind can dream safely\nbecause think about how\nquickly we would have all\nbeen popped out of the gene pool.\nYou know, if I think I'm\none of the best skydivers\nwho can just simply fly,\nand I've had sometimes\nthose dreams too, you know,\nand I get up on my apartment\nwindow and I leap out.\n- Mm-hmm, you're done.\n- You're done, you know?\n- Yep, yep.\n- So that's part of the\nparadox of REM sleep,\nboth its brain activity similarity,\ndespite the behavioral\nstate being so different\nand this bizarre lockdown of\nthe brain of the body itself.\nNow, of course the involuntary muscles,\nthankfully, aren't paralyzed.\nSo you keep breathing,\nyour heart keeps beating.\n- Is this why men have\nerections during REM sleep\nand women have vaginal\nlubrication during sleep?\n- That's one of the reasons.\nPart of the other reason, though there\nis because of the autonomic activity.\nSo there is a part of our nervous system\ncalled the autonomic nervous system,\nand it controls many of\nthe automatic behaviors.\nAnd some of those are aspects\nof our reproductive facilities.\nDuring REM sleep what we later discovered\nis that you go through these bizarre,\nwhat we call autonomic\nstorms, which sounds dramatic,\nbut it actually is when you measure them\nthat you'll go through\nperiods where your heart rate\ndecelerates and drops and\nyour blood pressure goes down\nand then utterly randomly your heart rate\naccelerates dramatically,\nand what we call the fight\nor flight branch of the\nautonomic nervous system\nor the sympathetic nervous system,\nbadly named 'cause it's\nanything but sympathetic.\nIt's very aggravating.\nThat all of a sudden fires up\nand then it shuts down again.\nAnd it's not in any regular way.\nAnd it's when you get\nthose autonomic storms,\nyou get very activated from\na physiological perspective\nthat you can have these erections\nand you have vaginal discharge, et cetera.\n- But you're totally paralyzed.\n- But you are still paralyzed.\nThere are only two voluntary\nmuscle groups that are spared\nfrom the paralysis, bizarre.\nOne, your extraocular muscles\nbecause if they were paralyzed,\nyou wouldn't be able to\nhave rapid eye movements.\nAnd the other that we later discovered\nwas the inner ear muscle.\nAnd we've got no good understanding\nas to why those two muscles groups\nare spared from the paralysis.\nIt may have something to\ndo with cranial nerve,\nbut I don't think it's that.\nI think it's perhaps something\nmore sensory related.\nSome people have argued\nthat the reason the eyeballs\nare spared from the paralysis\nis because if your eyeballs\nare left for long\nperiods of time inactive,\nyou may get things such\nas oxygen sort of issues\nin the aqueous or vitreous humor.\nAnd so the eyeballs have\nto keep moving in some way.\n- Yeah, the drainage\nsystems of the anterior eye\nare made to require movement.\n- Exactly.\n- People with glaucoma\nhave deficits in drainage\nthrough the anterior chamber,\nbut there I'm speculating.\nI'm also speculating when I ask this.\nI would imagine that\nthere are states in waking\nthat also resemble Slow-wave sleep,\nor rather that there are\nstates that Slow-wave sleep\nalso resembles waking states.\nYou've beautifully illustrated\nhow REM sleep can mimic some\nof the more active brain states\nthat we achieve in waking.\nWhat sort of waking state\nthat I might've experienced\nor experience on a daily\nbasis might look similar\nto slow-wave sleep, non-REM sleep, if any?\n- That's a genius way\nof thinking about it,\nturns the tables, I love it.\nWe almost never see anything\nlike the true ultra slow-waves\nof deep non-REM sleep.\nSo we spoke about these two\nstages, non-REM and REM.\nNon-REM is further subdivided\ninto four separate stages,\nstages one through four increasing\nin their depth of sleep.\nSo stages three and four,\nthat's what we typically\ncall deep non-REM sleep.\nStages one and two, light non-REM.\n- So maybe take me through the\narc of a night, just so that-\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- So I put my head down.\nWell, for you, what time do\nyou normally go to sleep?\n- So I'm usually sort of\naround about a 10:30 PM guy.\nAnd usually I'll naturally\nwake up sort of a little bit\nbefore 7:00 sometimes before 6:45 or 7:00.\nI have an alarm set for 7:04.\nAnd 7:04 just because, you\nknow, why not be idiosyncratic?\n- I love it.\n- I don't know why we always set things\non these hard numbers,\nso, yep, so when you-\n- So you would go to sleep around 10:30.\n- Yep.\n- So using you as an example,\nbecause I imagine a number\nof people go to sleep\nat different times with 10:30\nis about when I go to sleep,\n11:00 is for me, but you\ngo to sleep at 10:30.\nSo for that first, let's\nsay, three hours of sleep,\nwhat does the architecture\nof that sleep look like\nas compared to the last three hours\nof your sleep before morning?\n- Yeah, so I should note\nthat that sort of, you know,\n10:30 to 7:00, that's just based\non my chronotype and my preferential.\nIt's different for different people.\nI'm not suggesting that\nthat's the perfect sweet spot\nfor humanity's sleep, it's\njust my natural sweet spot.\n- But I imagine most\npeople probably go to sleep\nsomewhere between 10:00 PM and midnight.\n- It's somewhere between\nlike 9:00 and midnight.\n- And most wake up between\n5:00 AM and 7:00 AM\nor 5:30 and 7:30.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nAt least in, if you look at\nsort of first world nations,\nthat's a typical sleep profile.\nSo when I first fall asleep,\nI'll go into the light\nstages of non-REM sleep,\nstages one and two of non-REM.\nAnd then I'll start to descend down\ninto the deepest stages of non-REM sleep.\nSo after about maybe 20 minutes,\nI'm starting to head down\ninto stage three non-REM\nand then into stage four non-REM sleep.\nAnd as I'm starting to fall\nasleep, as I've cast off\nfrom the, usually with me,\nmurky waters of wakefulness,\nand I'm in the shallows of\nsleep stages one and two,\nmy heart rate starts to drop a little bit.\nAnd then my brainwave pattern\nactivity starts to slow down.\nNormally when I'm awake,\nit's going up and down\nmaybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times a second.\nAs I'm going into light non-REM sleep,\nit will slow down to maybe 15, 20,\nand then really starts to slow down,\ndown to about sort of 10\nor eight cycles per second,\neight cycle waves per second.\nThen as I'm starting to\nmove into stages three\nand four non-REM sleep, several\nremarkable things happen.\nAll of a sudden my heart rate\nreally does start to drop.\nOh, and I'll come back to temperature.\nI'm going to write temperature down\n'cause I always forget these things.\nNow I'm solidly in the\nfoothills of middle-age.\nSo as I'm starting to go\ninto those deeper stages\nof non-REM sleep, all of a\nsudden hundreds of thousands\nof cells in my cortex all\ndecide to fire together\nand then they all go silent together.\nAnd it's this remarkable\nphysiological coordination\nof the likes that we just don't see\nduring any other brain state.\n- That's really interesting.\nHaving recorded from the brains of animals\nand a little bit from humans,\nI don't think I've ever\nseen the entire cortex\nor even entire regions of\ncortex light up like that.\n- Yeah, it's stunning.\n- [Andrew] Yeah, amazing.\n- It's almost like this\nbeautiful sort of mantra chant\nor this sort of, you\nknow, it's a slow inhale\nand then a meditative\nexhale, inhale exhale.\nAnd these waves are just\nenormous in their size.\n- And the body is capable\nof movement at this time.\nThere is no paralysis.\n- There is no paralysis,\nbut for the most part,\nmuscle tone has also dropped significantly\nat that point.\n- Interesting.\n- And then you will, or\nI will then stay there\nfor about another 20 or 30 minutes.\nSo now I'm maybe 60 or 70 minutes\ninto my first sleep cycle.\nAnd then I'll start to rise back up,\nback up into stage two non-REM sleep.\nAnd then after about 80 or so minutes,\nI'll pop up and I'll have\na short REM sleep period.\nAnd then back down I go again\ndown into non-REM up into REM.\nAnd you do that reliably repeatedly,\nand I will be doing that.\nAnd I do do that every 90 minutes.\nAt least that's the\naverage for most adults.\nIt's different in different species.\nWhat changes, to your question,\nis the ratio of non-REM\nto REM within that 90-minute cycle\nas you move across the night.\nAnd what I mean by this is, in\nthe first half of the night,\nthe majority of those 90-minute cycles\nare comprised of lots\nof deep non-REM sleep.\nThat's when I get my stage three\nand four of deep non-REM sleep.\nOnce I push through to the\nsecond half of the night,\nnow that see-saw balance changes.\nAnd instead the majority\nof those 90-minute cycles\nare comprised either of this\nlighter form of non-REM sleep,\nstage two non-REM sleep and much more\nand increasingly more\nrapid eye movement sleep.\n[upbeat rock music]"
