    "transcript": "Most people have probably heard\nthe hypothetical question,\nlike, what would you do\nif you knew you couldn't fail, right?\nOr what would you do if you couldn't fail?\nAnd Seth turns that around, I\nthink that's a good question.\nBut he turns around and\nhe said, what would you do\nif you knew you were going to\nfail in terms of identifying\nwhat you would do for the process, right?\nWhat would you do if you\nknew it was going to fail?\nOkay, you're considering\nthese five different projects,\nlet's say they're all going to fail,\nbut you still have to\nchoose one of the five.\nWhich would you choose?\nYeah, that's a great question.\nYeah.\nMuch harder to answer.\nYeah.\nAnd you know, at the same time,\nI'm called back to when\nI was a graduate student\nand still now with the podcast\nI have this litmus test,\nwhich is, you know, is the\nexperiment that I'm working on\nthe one that I want to be\nworking on most, is the podcast\nthat I'm working on\nthe one that I want to be working on most?\nI mean, there's truly no other podcast\nI'd rather be having today\nthan this one, right?\nAnd the moment I'm starting to\nthink, oh, I wish I was doing\nthat thing over there, I\nrealize I'm off target.\nI'm off target.\nAnd I think that asking\nreally good questions\nis something clearly\nthat you're very good at.\nAnd getting a little bit deeper\ninto your process around that,\ndo you write those things down?\nLike, is there a notebook\nsomeplace in the kingdom\nof Tim Ferriss in Austin\nor elsewhere that says, you know,\nthat those questions that\nessentially those questions\nare written, are they?\nYeah, I collect, I\nliterally have a document\nwith questions that I've\ngathered from Seth printed out\nand at the Airbnb where\nI'm staying here so I'm.\nYou brought it with you.\nI printed it out here.\nGreat.\nAnd then I went through\nand I read it last night\nand I was highlighting\nquestions from past interviews\nI've had with him on my podcast\nto revisit his questions.\nSo I was literally doing\nthat last night over dinner.\nAnd I collect questions,\nI collect questions\nif I am reading a magazine\nand I come across a good\nquestion, I take a photo\nor I capture it somehow\nin notes or in Evernote,\nwhich I know is kind of\nold fashioned these days,\nbut I've used it for everything.\nSo the critical mass is beyond enormous.\nAnd I do collect and revisit these things.\nI capture them in journals as well.\nBut I absolutely capture good\nquestions when I find them.\nQuestions are so powerful for the brain.\nI don't want to go into\nthis in too much detail\n'cause I have a lot\nmore questions for you,\nbut we just wrapped a\nseries on mental health\nthat will come out later\nthis year with Paul Conte.\nAnd he is brilliant, as we both know\nand does truly important work.\nAnd he pointed to the value\nof asking really good questions\nabout oneself and the,\nbecause of the way that questions\nthat are really directed at self-inquiry\nqueue up the subconscious.\nSo you ask the question,\nand unlike a statement\nor a meme, the brain works with that\nin the days and hours after\nasking the question in ways\nthat simple declarative statements\nprobably don't ping the\nsystem the same way,\nwhich is probably why we can\nsee so many points of wisdom\nand truth everywhere,\nand it doesn't necessarily transform us.\nBut asking really good\nquestions really does seem\nto transform us.\nYeah, there's,\nI think judging people by their\nquestions is also a shortcut\nto assessing and learning a\nlot about how someone functions\nand what makes them tick.\nI think it was Voltaire who\nsaid, you know, \"judge a man\nby his questions, not by his answers.\"\nSomething along those lines.\nBut when in doubt attribute\nto Voltaire, it sounds good.\nIt does sound good.\nAnd I think about this a lot.\nI do think about the questions\nand I refine the questions\nthat I ask myself,\nespecially while journaling,\nbecause it's easier to cross examine\nand stress test your own certainty\nand beliefs when they're captured on paper\nor digitally on a laptop, for instance.\nSo I do routinely\nrevisit certain questions\nthat I've found helpful over time.\nI mean, one that people can play with is\nwith whatever is really\ncausing you consternation\nor stress at the moment.\nSome kind of decision or\nrelationship, business,\ncould be anything.\nJust what might this look\nlike if it were easy, right?\nWhat might this look like?\nIf it were easy, if it had to be easy,\nif that were possible,\nwhat might it look like?\nAnd that could apply to anything.\nIt could apply to anything, you know,\ncould apply to, could apply to fitness.\nIt's like, look, if you do\nreally intense kettlebell swings\ntwice a week with proper weight and load\nand time under tension,\nand you do pushups a few times a week\nand handle a couple of other elements,\nyou can get in pretty good shape.\nIt's so simple but hits a lot.\nI mean, it hits your\nentire posterior chain.\nOkay, fine, do some\npushups and some core work.\nBut if you are not exercising at all,\nbecause you've made the\nassumption that it's four hours,\nfive hours a week, rather\nthan completely remove\nthat objective\nand call it just impractical,\ncan you ratchet down the scale?\nHow far can you ratchet down the scale\nuntil you have no excuses, right?\nThat would just be one example.\nLanguage learning, tech investing,\nit applies to everything.\nMaking life easier\nis something that definitely gets my vote.\nYeah, making it easier and\nmaking it more elegant, right?\nThe more pieces in your life\nyou have floating around,\nthe more contacts, the more\nextraneous loose connections,\nthe harder your life is going to be.\nThe cognitive overload or\noverhead is really high.\nSo I'm always looking for\nmaybe like Japanese flower arranger.\nIt's like, okay, how\nmany pieces can I remove\nwhile still like maintaining the essence\nof what I'm trying to achieve?\nYou and Rick Rubin, man, [laughs]\nI'm telling you, you know,\ntwo people I am fortunate\nenough to know personally\nand that I have tremendous respect for,\nand you know, the work\nand is self-evident.\nYou know, it's really remarkable.\nSo rewind that\nand listen to that segment\nright there, folks.\nI'm telling you I've\nworked hard to apply it\nbecause it's not my default.\nAnd boy does it make a\nsignificant improvement\nto simplify, simplify, simplify.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
