    "transcript": "I have a chapter in my new book called\n\"Awakened to the\nStrangeness of Being Alive.\"\nAnd it's about the fact that\nif you think about it\nand how unlikely it is that\nwe humans evolved at all,\neven that we even exist,\nall the bottlenecks in evolution\nthat we had to pass through,\nincluding the disappearance\nof the dinosaurs\nand the emergence of mammals.\nBut there are 20 other huge bottlenecks\nthroughout the history of evolution.\nWe had to pass through all of those.\nWe nearly went extinct 80,000 years ago\nfrom some virus that infect.\nThere were only 8,000\npeople, humans on the planet.\nAll these different things.\nAnd here we are with Zoom\nmeetings, et cetera, et cetera.\nIt's like the strangest\nstory you can ever...\nIt's beyond science fiction,\nbut nobody thinks about it.\nNobody sits down and\ngoes, \"God, I'm alive.\"\nIf you went back to the chain of people\nthat had to connect and have children\nleading up to your parents,\nthe unlikeness of you ever\nbeing born is astronomical.\nI mean, unless my science\nis all wrong, you know.\n70,000 generations of people\nmeeting, et cetera, et cetera,\nfinally ending at your DNA.\nI mean, unless I'm missing\nsomething, it's pretty unlikely.\nBut nobody thinks about it.\nWell, I certainly think about it now\nbecause I almost died, I had\nnothing else to think about.\nI have to entertain my brain\nthe way Milton Erickson\nhad to entertain himself\nby observing people.\nSo it's taken a lot away\nfrom me. I can't swim.\nI'm riding my recumbent\nbike, which I love.\nAnd 80-year-old grandmothers\nare zipping by me,\nand I'm like, \"God dammit.\"\nHow awful. I'm so envious.\nMy insecurities all well up.\nBut then I realize, \"Hey, I'm\nlike on a boat. I'm sailing.\nIt's wonderful. I'm outside.\"\nYou know, I have to go\nthrough these processes,\nbut I think it's developed me in some way\nthat's in the end, very positive.\nIt sounds like you've had to\nadjust to a new frame rate on life.\nLike the old movie had\na certain frame rate,\nthis movie has a certain frame rate,\nbut that within that frame rate,\nthere are gifts to be had\nthat you certainly missed\nin your prior version of self.\nIs that about, right?\nYeah, but also, like, I tell people this,\nI totally took my life for granted.\nI was swimming, all this\ntime I was fantastic.\nI was bicycling, I was traveling,\nbut I never sat back and thought,\n\"Wow, this is wonderful.\nHow grateful it's could\nbe taken away from me.\"\nI tell people, \"Don't\ndo that to yourself.\"\nI try and teach them, \"It can\nbe taken away from tomorrow.\nWhen you're out walking\nthe dog, think of me,\nthink of me that can't walk a dog\nand appreciate those things,\nwhich I didn't appreciate.\"\nSo I try and help people in\nthat way when I can, you know.\nI think critical message is also\nto inspire a sense of urgency in people.\nYou know, I think people\nhear a sense of urgency\nand they go, \"Oh, God, I'm\nalready under so much pressure.\nLife's so hard.\"\nBut we're not talking\nabout a sense of urgency\nto take on more of what life has to offer.\nI think we're talking\nabout a sense of urgency\nto find one's purpose, which takes work,\nand is an ongoing process,\nbut to really get out of\nmodes of apathy, laziness,\nlanguishing,\nand to start, as you've described it,\npaying deeper attention.\nI mean, this is a concept that\nwas super important for me\nto hear about and I\nlearned about it from you,\nwas how do you get yourself out of a rut?\nYou start paying deeper attention\nto the things around you and inside you.\nAnd perhaps not coincidentally,\nyou referred to that as\nquote \"Death ground.\"\nYeah.\nSo it's a strategy from my book.\nI wrote a book on Strategy, my\nversion of \"The Art of War.\"\nIt's called \"33 Strategies of War,\"\nbut it's really about strategy,\nthe strategic thinking.\nIt's inspired from Sun Tzu,\nthe great Chinese strategist.\nBut it has vast\nphilosophical implications.\nThe idea is,\nyou can almost think of it\nlike barometric pressure.\nWhen necessity is pressing in on you,\nlike your back is against the wall,\nlike you have to get something done\nand there's like this pressure around you,\nyou find energy in there that\nyou never believed before.\nWilliam James talks about this,\nand when he talks about\ngetting a second wind,\nhe explains it very eloquently.\nWhen you feel like your life's in danger,\nsuddenly you can leap over things\nthat you never could leap over before.\nSo Sun Tzu says,\n\"Put an army on death ground,\nand it will fight until it wins.\"\nMeaning put an army with\nits back to the ocean\nor a back to the mountain,\nand it's either win or die.\nThey're going to fight 10 times harder.\nYou're going to find the energy\nin you that you normally lack\nwhen death is facing you in the face,\nor urgency, or deadlines,\nor people pressing in on you.\nWhen that barometric pressure loosens up\nand there's none of it,\nyou think you have all\nthe time in the world,\nyou get nothing done.\n\"Wow, man, I'm 23, I've got\nall these years ahead of me.\nI'm going to figure it out, right?\nI'm not going to die.\nI got 50, 70, 80 years ahead of me.\"\nNo, you don't.\nThat pressure now is gone\nand you're wasting time.\nYou're doing all sorts of things\nthat aren't leading to any kind of skill.\nYou're not learning or anything.\nYou need to put yourself on death ground.\nYou need to feel that barometric pressure,\nwhich is the actual reality.\nThe actual reality is\nyou could die tomorrow.\nYou could have a stroke tomorrow.\nYou could be fired tomorrow.\nEverything could fall apart.\nYou need to have that sense of urgency now\nbecause that's the reality.\nYou're fooling yourself\nby thinking you have all of this time.\nAnd so when you feel that pressure,\nsuddenly you can move mountains.\nYou have energy, your life, you know,\nyou just have focus, et cetera.\nNeurologically, everything\nclicks in, you know.\nAnd people who've had that experience\nwhere they've felt like\nthe ship was going under\nand they better get their\nact together and survive,\nthey talk about all\nthese physical processes.\nI have a story in my new book,\nI hope I'm not boring you with all this.\nNo, please. Quite the opposite.\nAbout a mountain climber,\nhe was climbing this mountain by himself,\nand he was having a great time,\nbut there was a storm coming\nand he had to get down,\nand he suddenly fell\nand he cut his leg open massively,\nand there was like a\nbranch sticking in it.\nAnd he broke all these bones,\nand he was going to die.\nHe was on a ledge.\nHe could see that it was getting dark\nand storm clouds were massing.\nThis was in the Rocky Mountains.\nHe was alone.\nAnd suddenly he managed\nto get up on his two feet,\nand he can't explain how,\nbut all of this energy,\nall of this adrenaline\nstarted flowing in him.\nAnd he said he was like a mountain goat.\nHe was like going down the ledge.\nHe jumped, he was able to kind\nof get down to another ledge.\nHe got out of it.\nAnd for the next 20 years,\nhe was haunted by \"How did that happen?\nI want that feeling again.\nBecause it was actually\nthe most ecstatic feeling.\nI had energy that I never\nsuspected in myself.\"\nAnd so he tries everything\nto get that feeling back.\nHe tries climbing other mountains.\nHe tries going to Mount Everest.\nHe tries, and it doesn't come back.\nAnd finally, he kind of\nfigures out the formula for it\nand why it happened.\nHe studies a lot of neuroscience.\nIt's a great book. I'm\nusing it in my new book.\nIt's called \"Bone Games.\"\nIt's very interesting book.\nA lot of science in it.\nAnd he got the feeling back\nin a smaller sense,\nbut it was the feeling of\nyour life is in danger.\nI better get my act\ntogether or it's the end.\nAnd suddenly, adrenaline,\ndopamine, all the other\nthings were occurring in him.\nAnd he got it, and he found that energy.\nSo that's the ultimate kind\nof death ground right there.\nThe human will to live\nis truly incredible.\nAnd so I have to say,\nas I said before, I'm so grateful\nthat your stroke didn't take you out.\n[Robert laughs]\nBecause clearly there's\nstill so much in there\nand you're continuing to share\nwhat is really exquisitely\nuseful knowledge.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
