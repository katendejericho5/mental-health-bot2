    "transcript": "Lately, you say,\n\"Hey, we're going over so-and-so's house,\"\nand they say, you know,\n\"I don't like their kids.\"\nYou go, \"Well, listen,\n\"you got to learn to\nplay with other kids.\"\nAnd they go, \"No, I\ndon't like their kids.\"\nAnd you say, \"Did something happen?\"\nAnd so we're not talking\nabout a dangerous situation.\nYeah.\nAnd they're like.\n\"No, I don't like them.\nI just really want to just stay home.\"\nYeah, this is a great-\nYeah.\nSo are we going to\nimpinge on their, I mean,\nbecause we're teaching them,\neither way we're teaching them something.\nYep.\nYou got to do stuff you don't want to do,\neven if you don't like it.\nYep.\nAnd here again, we're\nruling out the possibility\nthat there's something-\nOf course.\nUnsafe about the environment.\nYep.\nPsychologically.\nOr physically unsafe [inhales].\nBut at the same time we're teaching them,\n\"Hey, I see you, I hear you.\n\"But, you know, your\ndesires might not be right.\"\nThere's actually a kind\nof like a tacit message\nof the way you feel might\nnot be the best gauge\nof what's best for you,\nwhich sends a complicated\nmessage to a kid.\nTotally.\nSo this is again, where\nI think a good inside,\nlike, family jobs are so useful.\nFamily jobs, to me, when I\nused to meet with parents,\nand like they describe a situation,\nI feel like 90% of the time,\nthat's where I'd start.\nBecause then that flows from there.\nIt's like a framework.\nSo, wait, what is my job?\nI'm the one who sets boundaries.\nLike, I am the one who\nmakes key family decisions.\nObviously, as our kids get older,\nthey should be making some decisions too.\nNo one likes to feel controlled,\nbut key decisions.\nAnd my job is to validate\nmy kids' experience.\nThis is actually complicated because,\nagain, over and over we think\nthat validating my kids' experience\nmeans they're going to dictate a decision.\nMy boundaries don't\ndictate my kids' feelings.\nAnd my kids' feelings should\nnot dictate my boundaries.\nThey're just two equal things.\nSo, this is a great example.\nMy kids are like,\n\"You know, I don't like\nplaying with those kids\n\"and can I just stay home with,\"\nlet's just say grandma was home.\n\"Can I just stay home?\"\nAnd I'm like, I just think it's important\nto go as a family,\nbut my kid doesn't want to go.\nThere's nothing dangerous.\nOkay, to me, this is that exact way\nof putting family jobs into action.\n\"Sweetie.\"\nLike, and to me, this phrase,\nI wish every parent could\nsay this to their kid,\n\"I believe you.\"\nIf you want to make a kid feel real\nand confident for life,\nconfidence comes from the experience\nof being believed.\n'Cause that's how you,\nfor me, confidence is self-trust.\nIt's not feeling good about yourself.\nIt's self-trust.\nI really do know the way I feel.\nSo let's say I say to my\nson in that situation,\nit's, \"I believe you.\"\nI'd start that way.\n\"I believe you.\n\"Look, I know you want\n\"to play football all day\n\"and the kid around\nyour age hates football.\n\"Like, that would probably be lowest\n\"on your list of types of kids\n\"you'd want to hang out\nwith for the afternoon.\n\"I totally believe you.\"\n\"And in this family,\n\"we know that sometimes we have\n\"to do things we don't love to do.\n\"We do that for a family experience.\"\nI say this to my kid all the time,\n\"You know, also just to\nend up being a good adult,\n\"you just have to end\nup practicing as a kid,\n\"doing things you don't want to do.\n\"Things that are boring,\n\"things that aren't your preference.\n\"So, you know, you notch\nin your belt for that.\n\"So, you don't have to thank me.\n\"And, also I know you have it in you\n\"to do your best to be polite and engaged.\n\"Like I just, I know you're a good kid\n\"and this isn't what you want.\n\"And I know we're going\nto get through it.\"\nNow if it's really hard, maybe I'm,\n\"Hey, let's create a sign.\n\"Like, can you look at\nme and go make that,\n\"when you feel like you're kind of at this\n\"and then me and you we're\ngoing to go to the bathroom.\n\"I'm going to give you a hug.\"\nAnd, I'm going to say, \"I\nknow this isn't what you want.\n\"And when we get home,\n\"we could watch that football game,\"\nwhatever it was, right?\nBecause what we often\ndo is we leave ourselves\nwith two choices with kids.\nWe either say, \"Fine, stay home.\"\nTheir feelings actually\njust dictated the decision.\nThat's not helpful for them.\nI don't want my kid to learn\nin life when I don't want\nto do something people twist\nand turn to make that thing not happen.\nLike that's disturbing for\nadulthood expectations.\nBut then we do the other thing,\nwhich is like, \"You are so selfish.\n\"Just because you don't\nhave a friend your age\n\"doesn't mean that you\ncan't come with us.\"\nSo, we either let their feelings dictate,\nor we think our boundaries\nkind of give us the right\nto be mad at our kid, right?\nLike to do both is so important.\nAnd so that's where I think to me,\nwhen I hear impingement,\nlike I actually think\nthat is the exact space\nwhere you have the most bang\nfor your buck as a parent.\nLike, it's not enjoyable.\nAnd again, if I have my\nbeautiful intervention\nwith my son, do not think my kid will look\nat me and say, \"I love\nhow you explain that.\n\"That was so beautiful.\"\nNo, he's going to roll his eyes.\nMy job is not to take the\nbait 'cause I'm an adult.\nAnd to also hold hope.\nI think that's really important,\nthis concept of I'm\nvalidating my kids' feelings\nwhere they are today,\nbut I need to be the one to hold hope\nthat they can cope with it.\nIf I can't name to my kid,\n\"I know you're going to get through it.\"\nThey're not going to be able to see\nthat kind of next more\nmature version of themselves.\nAnd I actually think it's\nthe same as your best boss.\nYou know, it was like,\n\"I know you don't want\nto go on this trip.\"\nI don't, whatever it is,\n\"I know this presentation\ntopic isn't the one\n\"you would've chosen.\n\"And there were 10 things\n\"and this was literally number 10.\n\"I totally get that.\n\"And it stinks.\n\"And I'm not taking\nanything away from that.\n\"And this is the thing I need you to do.\n\"And I know something about you.\n\"Like when you put your mind to something,\n\"you always do a great job.\n\"And, like, it's probably\nnot going to be enjoyable,\n\"but I do know you're going\nto do a great job on this.\"\nLike, [inhales] that's\nlike the boss you want!\nAmazing.\nRight.\nAre you adopting children by the way?\nI-\nBecause I actually.\nI finished college.\n[Becky laughs]\nI actually-\nYou, I'd consider Andrew.\nOkay.\nAdult children.\n[Andrew laughs]\nWhat I'm hearing is don't\ndictate their behavior\nand I'm going to\nunderline in bold dictate,\ndon't dictate their behavior.\n\"You're going to do\nthis because I said so.\"\nYes.\nThat's dictatorship.\nBut at the same time,\ndon't quash the emotion\nbehind the resistance,\ncan acknowledge it, make them feel real.\n\"I believe you.\"\nYes.\nI love this phrase.\nAmazing, and I love your\ndefinition of confidence.\nIf people didn't hear that,\nwe're definitely going to repeat it again.\nAnd we're going to etch it\ninto your neural circuitry.\n'Cause I love that.\nIt's a self-trust.\nYes.\nAnd this notion of giving hope,\nyou're giving them an incentive\nthat's based on a reward\nthat's actually good for them,\nthat they can translate to\nother situations as well.\nWow!\nSo much there.\nCan I double-click\nOn reward.\nPlease.\nBecause you know what made me think?\nI didn't think until you said that.\nLike, I think in a situation,\nwe'd would you be tempted to say like,\n\"And if you go and you're polite,\n\"I'll give you 20 extra\nminutes of Roblox.\"\nRight, that's like [inhales]\nand first of all,\nlet me just say something like,\nwhatever I say to you, like for listeners,\nlike, it's not like I do this stuff\nall the time [laughs] with my actual kids.\nI'm the first one sometimes to be like,\n\"Here's your thing, I have to dangle.\"\nWe'll provide a little section\nin the comment section\non YouTube where your kids can...\nNo, I'm just kidding.\nYeah, exactly.\nYour kids are forbidden.\nNo, oh wait, that's,\nwait, that's dictating.\n[Becky laughs]\nWe understand why you,\nI believe that you would want to comment,\n[Becky laughs]\nbut we're going to trust,\nwe're going to let you know why it's good\nfor you if you don't-\nanyway.\nExactly.\nI'll practice this on someone else's kid.\nBut the reward, like the [sighs],\nwhen your kid ends up\nseeing themself capable\nof doing something\nthey didn't previously\nthink they could do,\nthat, you know better than me,\nlike, I feel like that is\nlike one of the best rewards.\nEven if it's getting\nthrough a social situation\nor I think about this a lot with,\nyou know, my little kid is I don't know,\nlike struggling with\na puzzle or something.\nAnd I could just do it for them.\nOr if help them kind of regulate,\n\"Oh, this is a hard puzzle.\n\"And you can take a break.\n\"I just know you're going\nto figure it out today.\n\"I just know it.\"\nAnd then because of that, they get there.\nThat feels in your body,\nlike that is the best kind of reward\nand it's the type of reward\nthat works for kids in a adulthood.\nWhen they're in a job,\nwe want them to be motivated\nby the feeling they're\ngoing to have of pride,\nnot be saying, \"Hey, I\nfinished by thing early.\n\"Do I get a bonus,\" to they're boss.\nLike that's not going to play out as well.\nI love it.\nI'm just pausing and shaking my head,\nonly 'cause I love it so much.\nAnd I just want to make sure\nthat i don't quickly move\nto the next question, without\ndrilling down even deeper-\ninto some of these concepts.\nYeah.\nI believe you as the feedback,\na response that can instill\nreal confidence over time.\nNot to get too nuanced here,\nbut how is different,\nbecause I sense it is\ndifferent than, \"I hear you.\"\nI hear you, but-\n[laughs] you're going to.\nYes.\nDo this anyway [laughs].\nYes.\nOr, I hear you.\nBut listen in this family, dah, dah, dah.\nYeah.\nI believe you, the word,\nbelieve, is powerful.\nAnd I believe there's real\npower in specific words,\nas is, for instance, sturdiness.\nAgain, that's such a\npowerful and underused word.\nI believe you.\nYou're a psychologist,\nwhat do you think we're\nhearing when somebody says,\n\"I believe you,\" that's\ndifferent than, \"I hear you.\"\nI haven't listed these out,\nbut I think we all have\nthese core needs as humans.\nAnd I think being believed is one of them,\nbecause it's one of them,\nit's someone else else kind of saying,\n[sighs] like, \"You're real.\"\nThat's what, I might not\nfeel what you're feeling,\nbut that thing that feels strong to you,\nthat nobody can see or measure, is real.\nAnd when I think about\nthe most confident people,\nI think about this girl\nwho I went to Duke with,\nand she was just brilliant, like so smart.\nWe were in this seminar.\nIt was one of these small classes\nwhere this professor\nwas talking about stuff\nand like for one felt like,\nI have no idea what this\nperson's talking about.\nBut, I was like no one else is stopping,\nand this girl raised\nher hand and she says,\n\"I'm sorry is everyone else is annoyed.\n\"I have no idea what you're talking about,\n\"because I usually do.\n\"Is there anyway you could\nsay that in a different way.\"\nThat is like to me, the\nutmost version of confidence.\nThat she believed her own\nexperience of confusion,\nwas real confusion.\nShe didn't think it was\na sign she was stupid.\nShe believed it.\nShe believed herself.\nThat is so confident.\nAnd, I think when someone says,\n\"I hear you,\" it's like\na version of listening.\nThere's many worse phrases.\nNo damage is done.\nWhen we follow anything with but, but,\nwe tend to invalidate.\nThat's not good anyway.\n\"I believe you but,\"\nis also not going to...\nBut there's a million\nexamples of this to me\nthat build confidence.\nAnd I actually think\nthere's so many situations\nwith kids where they say situations,\nand we rate, \"Oh, they\nhave low confidence,\"\nand then we intervene to\nquote, make them feel better,\nwhich actually is the thing\nthat lowers their confidence,\n'cause it's like we say to them,\n\"I don't believe you.\n\"You're not really feeling\n[laughs] the way you feel.\"\nWhere \"I believe you,\"\nis the exact opposite.\nSo like, I like to give examples,\nbecause it makes it concrete.\nLike my kid will come home\nand say, I don't know,\nah, \"I was picked last\nfor dodgeball today.\n\"I was picked last in something.\"\nAnd they're clearly,\nvery, very sad, right.\nAnd we want to say to\nthem, \"It's no big deal.\n\"Everyone's picked last sometimes.\n\"Remember yesterday you told me,\n\"you we're picked first for basketball\"\nAnd we think, I need to\nbuild up my kid's confidence.\nThose are confidence, I\ndon't want to say destroying,\nreducing interventions.\n'Cause a kid is kind\nof coming to a parent,\nbasically saying, \"I'm very, very upset,\n\"that I was picked last.\"\nAnd we're saying to a kid, no you weren't.\nAnd they're like, \"But I am.\"\nAnd what they learn, this\nis really terrifying to me,\nis that other people are better feelers\nof my feelings than I am.\nAnd that has like a million\nreally scary interpersonal,\nI think, relationship\n[laughs], kind of consequences\nlater down in life.\nBut, when a kid says, \"I was picked last,\n\"and nobody even wants me,\n\"and they all think\nI'm the worst athlete,\"\nwhatever kids say,\njust sit and say some version of like,\n\"I'm so glad we're talking about this,\n\"and I can tell that was\na really hard gym class\n\"and sweetie, like, I believe you.\"\nYou will watch your kid,\nit is crazy to me what\nparents tell me happen,\nwhen they say those words to their kids.\nThey're like, it also,\njust like literally, diffused everything,\nand they were like ready to move on,\nliKe they are just trying\nto tell you probably,\nlike I was feeling something,\nit was a lot, it was confusing,\nor feelings are always hardest\nwhen we're alone in them.\nSo, I was alone in it and\nI'm bringing it to you.\nWhen someone says, \"I believe you,\"\nnot only are they giving\nyou that core need,\nthey're also just like,\nthey're like sitting down with you in it.\nAnd that makes everything better,\nand then meanwhile,\nwhat I kid feels like when\nwe say, \"I believe you,\"\nto a hard experience or a hard feeling is\n\"The feelings that overwhelm me,\n\"don't overwhelm my parents.\n\"They can tolerate it.\n\"They're not scare of me kind\n\"of being a loser in gym class one day.\n\"And if my parent likes me\n\"when I have that feeling,\n\"like I can start to like myself\n\"when I have that feeling.\"\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just
