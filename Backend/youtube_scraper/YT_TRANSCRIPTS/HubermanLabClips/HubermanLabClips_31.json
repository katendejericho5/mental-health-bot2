    "transcript": "Being a human being is not\neasy as opposed to an animal\nbecause we're born and nobody\ngives us like a direction.\nOur parents might be a little bit,\nour college teachers, et cetera, mentors,\nbut generally we're on our own.\nAnd it's a very, very difficult process.\nYou wake up in the morning\nand you don't really know what you can do.\nYou could choose 12 different paths.\nIt can be very confusing\nand very overwhelming.\nWhen you find that sense of purpose,\nwhen you find what I\ncall your life's task,\neverything has a direction.\nEverything has a purpose.\nYour energy is concentrated.\nIt's not like you're just going down\na single narrow pathway.\nIt's not like life becomes boring\nand it's just about discipline\nand solving problems.\nIt's actually the most exciting thing\nthat can ever happen to you\nbecause you never have that lost feeling.\nYou wake up in the morning and you go,\n\"Yeah, this is what I need to accomplish.\"\nPeople come at you with\nall kinds of distractions\nand boring and irritating things.\nYou're able to cut it out.\nIt's just the most marvelous\npiece of internal radar\nthat you can have.\nSo I genuinely wish\nthat everybody can find\nthat kind of internal radar.\nAnd so it's not easy\nand I understand that.\nThere's no instant formula\nbecause we're all about instant formulas.\nIt's difficult and I want you to know that\nso it's not like Robert\ncan give me the answer\nin three minutes.\nNo, I can't.\nBut there's a process involved.\nIt's not a mystery.\nYou can follow a very singular process.\nAnd the idea is you're\ntalking about childhood.\nThe way I like to frame\nit is when you were born,\nyou are a phenomenon.\nYou are unique.\nYour DNA has never occurred in\nthe history of the universe.\nGoing back billions of years,\nit will never occur in the future.\nYour life experience with your parents\nand everything that you experienced\nin your early years going on up is unique.\nIt's yours.\nYou're one of a kind, right?\nSo that is your source of power.\nTo waste that is just the worst thing\nyou can do in your life.\nAnd what the power is is\nfinding that uniqueness.\nWhat makes you you and\nhow you can mine that\nand how you can go deep into it\nand use that to create\na career path, right?\nAnd so I tell people when you're a child,\nwhen you're four or five or even younger,\nyou have what the great\npsychologist Maslow\ncalled impulse voices.\nThey're little voices\nin your head that say,\nI love this, I hate that.\nI like this food.\nI don't like when mommy moves this way.\nI like when daddy comes from here.\nYou're very cued into who you are\nand what you like and what you don't like.\nAnd these voices kind of direct\nyou in certain ways, right?\nAnd when you're very young,\nthey direct you towards\nintellectual mental pursuits\nas well.\nAnd there's a book I\nrecommend for everybody.\nIt's Howard Gardner's\n\"Five Frames of Mind.\"\nIt's helped me immensely.\nThe idea is he talks about\nfive forms of intelligence.\nOur problem is we think of intelligence\nas mostly intellectual,\nbut there are many forms of intelligence.\nThere's the intelligence\nthat has to do with words.\nThere's abstract intelligence\nthat has to do with\npatterns and mathematics.\nThere's kinetic intelligence\nthat has to do with the body.\nThere's social intelligence.\nHe has five of them.\nAnd the idea is your brain naturally veers\ntowards one of them.\nIt can veer towards two\nof them, that happens.\nBut generally one of them\nkind of dominates, right?\nAnd it's like a grain in your brain\nthat's going in a certain direction.\nYou want to go with that grain\n'cause that's where your power will lie.\nSo when you're young,\nif you go back and think about\nwhen you were four or five,\nyou can maybe get a picture\nof some kind of direction\nor voice inside of you that\nwas impelling you towards this.\nI know for me, it was words.\nI can remember when I was six years old,\nI was just obsessed with words,\njust the letters in words,\nalmost like in this almost\nslightly schizophrenic way.\nI would spell words backwards.\nI would take them apart.\nI would do anagrams.\nI love palindromes, right?\nSo I had a thing about words and language.\nIt's very primal.\nSome people, you know, Albert Einstein,\nwhen he was four years old,\nhis father gave him a\nbirthday gift of a compass.\nAnd he was just mesmerized\nby this compass.\nThe idea that there are\ninvisible forces out there\nin the cosmos moving this needle.\nAnd he's obsessed with the\nidea of invisible forces.\nSteve Jobs, when he\nwas like seven or eight\nor maybe younger in\nBurlingame, California,\nhis father, they passed by a store\nwith technological devices in the window.\nAnd he was just hypnotized by\nthe design of those devices\nand the glass tubes and everything.\nSo he wanted to go in that direction.\nYou know, Tiger Woods saw\nhis father hitting golf balls\nin the garage and he was\njust like screaming with joy.\nHe had to do that, right?\nYou know, I could give you a million\ndifferent examples of this.\nOf course, these are people\nwho are famous, obviously.\nWe can go back and find that.\nIt's easier.\nBut what happens to you,\nand please cut me off if\nI'm going on too long.\nNo, please continue, please.\nWhat happens to you is you're seven.\nNow you're getting older\nand you're starting to not\nhear that voice anymore.\nYou're hearing the voice of\nyour teachers telling you,\nyou're not good at this field.\nYou need to get better at math.\nYou know, you shouldn't be\ninterested in these sports\nor anything.\nYou should be going this way.\nYour parents are starting to tell you\nthis is the career they want for you\nor the direction they\nwant you to go in, right?\nYou start hearing that\nmore than your own voice.\nAnd as you get older, it gets\nworse and worse and worse.\nThen when you're a teenager,\nit's all about what\nother people are doing,\nyour peers, what's cool,\nwhat's not cool, you know?\nAnd that kind of is more,\nso all of these noise enters your brain\nand you can't hear that anymore.\nYou don't know who you are.\nAnd so you go to college,\nyou kind of maybe choose a major\nthat seems practical that your\nparents want you to go into.\nMaybe you kind of wander\naround, you're not sure.\nAnd then you enter the work world\nwithout that inner radar\nthat I'm talking about.\nAnd brother, you're lost, right?\nWhere should I go?\nWell, I need to make money, right?\nAnd so you make a choice\nbased on the need to make a lot of money.\nNot everyone, but some people do that.\nAnd I understand that need.\nWe all need to make a living,\nbut that can set you\noff in a very bad path\nbecause you're not connected emotionally.\nThe thing is when you figure\nout that primal inclination,\nthat grain that's inside of you,\nthen you have the energy\nto be disciplined,\nto go through boring tasks, to learn.\nYou learn at a faster rate\n'cause you're emotionally engaged.\nWhen you're emotionally\nengaged in a subject,\nthe brain learns twice, three\ntimes, four times as fast\nas when you're not.\nI always give the example.\nIn college, I studied foreign languages,\nwhich was kind of a passion of mine.\nFor three or four years, I studied French.\nAnd then I went to Paris\nand I couldn't speak a word.\nIt was useless 'cause it didn't teach me\nanything practical, right?\nI was totally confused.\nAnd then, but I was in\nParis and I loved it\nand I wanted to live there, right?\nAnd I had a girlfriend and I\nneeded to speak French to her.\nAnd I can tell you in one month,\nI learned more than those\nfour years of university\nbecause I wanted to,\nbecause I was engaged.\nMy emotions were there.\nIt was like I had to\nsurvive to learn French.\nWhereas, so most of us, we\ndon't have a need really\nto learn this subject.\nWe're half, we're paying half attention.\nBut when you find that thing\nthat really connects to you,\nyou're paying deep attention.\nYour emotions are engaged.\nYou're learning at a\nmuch faster rate, okay?\nAnd so the thing is, how do you\nfind that when you're older?\nWhen you're 21, I give\npeople a lot of help\nand it's usually not so difficult.\nWe can go through that process.\nIt gets harder when you're 30\nand you've been wandering\naround, but it's not impossible.\nI didn't really start, find my exact path\nuntil I was 38, 39, to be honest.\nSo there's hope.\nWhen you get 40 and you get 50,\nit gets more and more difficult, right?\nAnd it's very sad if you\nwasted that seed of uniqueness\nthat I'm talking about.\nAnd I tell people there\nare ways of going back\nand we go through a\nprocess like archeology.\nWe have to dig and dig and dig\nand find those bones from your childhood\nthat indicated what you were meant to do.\nBut when you find your life's\ntask, everything opens up.\nIt doesn't mean you figured out,\nokay, I've got to aim for this\nparticular job when I'm 28.\nThat's not how it works.\nIt gives you a sense of direction.\nYou can try different things.\nYou can experiment.\nYou can have fun when you're in your 20s.\nYou're going to learn.\nYou're going to learn skills,\nbut it gives you an overall framework\ninstead of, whoa, all of this confusion,\nthis chaos, social media, the internet.\nI could go here, here, here.\nYou're lost at sea.\nIt gives you a very important\nsense of direction, a compass.\nAs you describe this,\nI have this image of,\nyou mentioned animals that presumably\ndon't have a lot of flexibility\nin terms of the niches they can exist in,\nbut the way I imagine this process is\nthat as a human, we're\nplopped into a environment,\nand here I'm using an analogy where\nwe don't really know if\nwe are an aquatic animal,\na terrestrial animal, or an avian, right?\nOr an amphibian.\nOr an amphibian,\nfor that matter, and to\nmake the wrong choice,\nto be an amphibian who's trying to fly,\nalthough I'm sure they're out\nthere in the animal kingdom,\nit's not just a waste of\ntime, it's probably deadly,\nand not to over-dramatize the failure\nof finding one's purpose,\nbut I see it that way,\nwhereas perhaps we could just say\nthat the process of finding one's purpose\nis to realize like, ah, I'm an amphibian,\nI can go in and out of water,\nwhereas a bunch of other\ncreatures around me\nstop at the water's edge, right?\nAnd this is really cool, and\na bunch of these other things,\nlike these flying things,\nthat they can't actually\neven go in the water.\nSome of them might be on\nthe surface or dive into it,\nbut they can't do what I can do,\nso the process of self-discovery,\nit sounds like it's about\nrestricting one's choices\nto a sort of wedge within the\nfull landscape of options,\nand for me, I can certainly\nrecall, after reading \"Mastery,\"\nit helped me recall\nsome early seed emotions\nthat I experienced as a very\ndistinct sensation in my body.\nCan you describe that?\nYeah, well, without making it too specific\nto my unique tastes, as a\nkid, I loved flora and fauna.\nI loved learning about biology.\nSure.\nYeah, no surprise there,\nbut animals and how\nthey move in particular,\nand fish and going to\na proper aquarium store\nfor the first time for me,\nand going snorkeling for the\nfirst time was like, wow,\nand even as I describe it, it's\nalmost like my body floats.\nI feel it in my left arm of all things,\nand it feels like there's\nsomething to do about it.\nIt's not just that I'm in observation\nof things that delight me.\nIt's like there's an activation\nstate created within me,\nlike I got to do something with this,\nand typically, it's\ntell everybody about it\nuntil they won't listen anymore,\nbut oftentimes, it's to\nalso draw those things\nto think about them, and\nI just delight in them.\nIt's a constant source of delight,\nand so seeds such as those,\nand there are a few other\nthings in that landscape\nof flora and fauna, and learning\nabout animals and biology,\nincluding the human animal,\nand then organizing information\nfeels so satisfying to me.\nIt's like a drug that,\nand so it just feels like\nthis eternal spring of life, right?\nAnd so for me, that's what it was,\nand in 2015, when I was\nteaching that course,\nthe course I loved, but I was\nfeeling a little bit astray\nin my scientific career,\nand then I read \"Mastery,\"\nand I realized, yes, I\nlove running a laboratory.\nI love teaching, but there's\nsomething else for me,\nand it has to do not with a podcast.\nI didn't even know what a podcast,\nI probably, I knew what a podcast was.\nI was listening to podcasts at that time,\nbut I wasn't on social media.\nI had no thoughts of having a podcast,\nbut what I wanted was that feeling\nin its total number of forms.\nThat's the goal, get that feeling\nin as many forms as possible.\nIs that about-\nThat's absolutely perfect,\nbecause the connection to\nwhat I'm talking about,\nit's not an intellectual\nthing, it's visceral,\nit's emotional, it's physical, right?\nAnd you feel it in your body,\nand when you're doing it,\nit's like it's at your level.\nIt's like you're swimming\nwith the current.\nYou feel that things are easy,\neverything clicks together,\nthere's a delight.\nNot everything is going to be delightful,\nthere's going to be tedium involved,\nthere's going to be moments of boredom,\nbut you're able to withstand\nthe moments of boredom\nbecause you feel that\ndeep overall connection.\nSo yes, that's precisely\nwhat I'm talking about.\nI mean, for me, it's a\nlittle bit similar thing\nis I said about words, but the other thing\nthat I was obsessed with when I was a kid\nwas early human ancestors.\nDon't ask me why, I just was so obsessed\nwith our ancestors millions of years ago,\nand how it's possible to be living here\nin the '60s or '70s with\ncars and everything,\nbut to come to where we are now.\nAnd I wrote a short story\nwhen I was eight years old\nabout a vulture, it was\nwritten from the point of view\nof a vulture watching the first humans\nkind of emerge on the planet.\nI'm sure it was absolutely\nawful, dreadful,\nbut the weird thing is\nI'm writing a new book\nand all I'm doing in that book\nis going into early humans.\nAnd I feel like a kid again,\nI'm so excited, I'm so happy.\nSo I can very much relate to your story.\nYou mentioned these five\ndifferent forms of intelligence\nor frames of mind, as\nyou referred to them.\nAnd I'm certainly aware\nthat I lean towards\na more intellectual interests,\nalthough, as you pointed\nout, the excitement,\nthe delight is visceral.\nAnd the actions are actions,\nthey're of the body ultimately.\nOne has to draw, speak,\nwrite books, et cetera,\nto transmute that excitement\ninto something real.\nFor people that are not\nas intellectually tuned,\nbut maybe are kinesthetically\ntuned, for instance,\nI can only wonder what that's like.\nI'm not completely uncoordinated,\nbut I don't think I have\na kinesthetic attunement\nor frame of mind.\nBut I, for instance, had\na podcast listener mention\nthat they think in feels,\nthat they literally experience thought\nas sort of a patchwork\nof bodily sensations.\nAnd that thought for\nthem is not of the stuff\nfrom the neck up, but\nonly from the neck down,\nwhich to me was really intriguing.\nAnd so I only raise this\nbecause there have to\nbe, as you point out,\nthere's an infinite number of\ndifferent sort of orientations\nbased on our unique DNA and experience.\nBut what do you think explains\nwhy these particular seeds\nor as you point out,\nlike the direction that the\ngrain runs in the brain?\nI mean, it's partially going to be nature,\nit's going to be DNA.\nFor sure.\nBut we're talking about this\nas if there's some exciting\nor awe-inspiring or delightful\nthing that captures us.\nCan it be the other way too?\nCan it be, you know, one has\na bad experience as a child\nin an intellectual\nenvironment and then decides,\nyou know, I'm going in the,\nthings of the body feel good.\nThings of the mind, of\nintellect feels bad.\nAnd does it matter whether\nor not we are drawn\nto our purpose by recognizing\nwhat we love or what we hate\nor are both useful?\nOh, they're both very, very useful.\nYou know, a lot of\nintelligence is non-verbal.\nWe think in terms of images,\nwe're very much infected by\nthe emotions of other people.\nSo I know for instance,\nmy mother is very, very\ninterested in history.\nShe's obsessed with history.\nAnd I probably absorbed\nher interest in history.\nI don't think there's a genetic,\na gene for that interest, you know?\nSo you're going to absorb things\nfrom your parents as well.\nSo it's not all just genetic.\nBut yeah, what you hate\nwill have a big thing.\nBut the problem with doing that is\nif you go into a direction\nand you're in elementary\nschool, et cetera,\nand they force you to\nlearn math and you hate it,\nwhat it tends to do is it turns you off\nfrom learning in general.\nYou think, I don't want to be disciplined.\nI don't want to go through anything\nbecause it's painful.\nIt doesn't lead anywhere.\nIt's not immediate frustration.\nIt turns you off from learning in general.\nSo it's really, really\nimportant for a child\nto have the love experience\nas early as possible\nso that they can know what they hate\nand why they hate it, right?\nAnd then they can rebel and\nthey can go into that field\nas opposed to, I hate learning.\nI hate discipline.\nI hate studying.\nI hate trying things over and over again.\nIf you're kinesthetically oriented,\nand you know, a part of me,\nI understand that because I love sports,\nis you have to practice.\nIt's going to take a lot of,\nyou're not going to instantly\nbe good at something, right?\nAnd that's going to require\na love of it, right?\nBut if your math experience,\n'cause I hate learning shit,\nyou're not, it's going\nto transfer to sports.\nYou're going to hate\ndiscipline in general.\nSo it's very important for parents\nto let that child have at least glimmers\nof that love moment.\nI know for me,\nwhen I finished college and\nI entered the work world,\nI had to get a job.\nI got worked in journalism.\nI hated it.\nI hated working for other people.\nI hated office politics.\nI hated all the egos.\nI hated the smarminess.\nI hated the lack of quality.\nIt was all just about, you know,\nmaking money and getting things out there.\nAnd then I worked in Hollywood.\nI hated Hollywood.\nI hated working in Hollywood.\nThat formed me very much,\nmade me go in the\ndirection that I went in,\nbut only from the basis of,\nI knew that I wanted to be a writer.\nSo, you know, that's very important\nthat it's not just hate.\nIt can form you,\nbut there also has to be that positive,\ndeep emotional love of something\nthat also is grounded in you in some way.\nWhat you just said really\nhighlights the fact\nthat energy and motivation\ncan come from either pressure,\nyou know, desire for something\nor desire to get away from something.\nAnd earlier when you were talking about\nhow we are so much more engaged\nand driven towards things\nthat stir us emotionally,\nand actually we know\nbased on the neuroscience,\nas you know too, I'm sure,\nthat only by the release\nof certain neurochemicals\nin the brain and body\nwould our brain have any\nreason to change, right?\nIf you don't feel agitation\nand you can do everything\nthat you're trying to do,\nof course your brain wouldn't change.\nLike, why would it, right?\nThat agitation is a signature\nof the neurochemicals\nthat are saying, \"Hey,\nsomething's different now.\"\nRight, right, right.\nYou might need to do something different,\nincluding rewire yourself, right?\nAnd that can come from positive\nor negative experiences.\nOf course.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
