    "transcript": "So how should we filter\npositive versus negative feedback?\nWell, there's a meta-analysis here.\nThis is Kluger and DeNisi\nlooking at 100 years of feedback research.\nAnd they found that what\ndrives the utility of feedback\nis not whether it's positive or negative,\nit's whether it focuses on the task\nor on the self.\nSo, if I tell you that\nyour work is terrible,\nyou're going to get defensive.\nIf I tell you that your work is great,\nyou're going to get complacent.\nIf I tell you, here's the specific thing\nthat I liked about your work,\nyou're going to try to\nlearn to repeat that.\nAnd if I tell you, here's\nthe thing I didn't like,\nyou're going to try to\nsee if you can fix it.\nSo I actually think we\nshould worry less about\nwhether the feedback is\nencouraging or discouraging,\nand more about how do I\nmake sure that I get input\nthat's going to allow me\nto learn from my strengths\nand also overcome my weaknesses.\nAnd actually, one of the things\nI've learned recently is there's some,\nI would say a growing body\nof evidence at this point,\nthat asking for feedback\nis not the best way\nto get people to help you.\nBecause when you ask for feedback,\nyou end up getting two groups of people.\nYou get cheerleaders and you get critics.\nAnd cheerleaders are basically\napplauding your best self.\nCritics are attacking your worst self.\nWhat you want is a coach,\nwhich is somebody who helps you\nbecome a better version of yourself.\nAnd the way you get people to coach you\nis not to say gimme feedback,\nbecause they will then look at the past\nand tell you what you screwed\nup or what you did right.\nWhat you want is to say,\n\"Can you give me advice for next time?\"\nAnd then they look at the future\nand they'll give you either\na note on something to repeat\nor something to correct.\nAnd this is such a subtle shift\nthat it can make a big difference.\nAndrew, one of the things\nI guess I found myself\napplying this to a lot is,\nafter giving speeches.\nI used to get off stage\nand say, \"I would love some feedback.\"\nAnd you get back a bunch of,\n\"Oh, you know, I really enjoyed that.\"\nThanks, what do I do\nwith that information?\nI'm trying to learn how to get better.\nAnd when I shift the question to say,\n\"What's the one thing I\ncould do better next time?\"\nIt's like, \"Oh, don't open with a joke.\"\nThe audience couldn't\ntell you were joking.\nFrequently,\nit's give me a little bit\nmore of a through line.\nYou focused a lot on, a\nbunch of interesting points,\nbut I lost the connective tissue.\nAnd those actionable suggestions\nare much more likely to come\nwhen you just ask for a tip\nas opposed to an evaluation.\nOh, that's so good.\nI think, I'm going to\njust pause for a second.\nI've never taken a pause on...\nI've taken an occasional\npause, to be honest,\nbut they're very rare\nas the audience knows.\nOh, that's just gazillion dollar advice,\nbecause I think that everyone has an ego.\nWe all want to perform well.\nWe'd like to perform better over time,\nand negative feedback hurts,\nand it can hurt a little\nor a lot depending on\nhow defensive we are.\nBut a tool like you just described,\nto remove some of that\ndefensive armor that we all have\nand actually let the information in\nin a way that's constructive\nis really great.\nWhat you described,\nI think is a way to create\nconstructive criticism,\nbut the constructive part is\nreally coming from within.\nYeah.\nAs opposed to saying,\nI'd like some constructive criticism,\nand then hoping that the criticism\nis actually constructive.\nSo you're taking control over the process\nin a healthy way, in a benevolent way.\nThat's the goal.\nAnd I think the big question\nthat comes up for a lot of\npeople at this point is,\nokay, so I get somebody to give me advice,\nbut it might still stink.\nHow do I get better at\ntaking it constructively?\nAnd I think probably my\nfavorite technique on this,\nI learned from Sheila Heen,\nshe calls it the second score.\nAnd the idea is that\nwhen somebody gives you\na piece of criticism,\nthat's your first score.\nSo let's say, like, in my world,\nthey gave me a three and a half,\nand I want to know how I\ncan do better next time.\nHow do I get myself to focus on that?\nWhat I do is say, \"I want to get a 10\nfor how well I took the three and a half.\"\nAnd that's the second score.\nI want to evaluate myself on\nhow well I took the first score.\nI think about this almost every day.\nActually, can I tell you a quick story?\nANDREW: Please.\nSo, when I was right out of my doctorate,\nI got asked to teach a motivation class\nfor Air Force generals and colonels.\nI was 25, I think, 25, 26.\nThey're all twice my age,\nthey've got thousands of flying hours,\nthey've got billion dollar budgets.\nThey've got, well, this community well,\ntheir nicknames are Stryker and Sand Dune,\nand I was extremely intimidated.\nSo I walked in there and I\nthought I had to impress them.\nAnd I started talking\nabout my credentials,\nand all my research experience.\nAnd the feedback at the end\nof the four hour session was brutal.\nI remember reading the feedback forms\nand one person had written,\n\"More knowledge in the\naudience than on the podium.\"\nI was like, \"True, I\ncan't argue with that.\"\nAnd then another wrote, \"I\ngained nothing from this session,\nbut I trust the instructor\ngained useful insight.\"\nAnd that was devastating.\nI was like, \" I would really like\nto transform into an actual bear\nand hibernate for the next four months,\nand then maybe I'll come out\nof a hole ready to hear this.\"\nI didn't have that option.\nI had committed to teach a\nsecond session a week later.\nSo all I could do was figure out\nhow am I going to hear this feedback\nand really take it seriously?\nAnd I guess I applied a\nversion of the second score,\nand I said, \"All right,\nthere's some generals\nthat are going to come\nback and see me again,\nand I've got to prove to them\nthat I was open to feedback.\"\nAnd one of the things\nI heard loud and clear\nwas that they valued humility,\nand I had led with too much confidence,\nwhich was just an insecurity mast.\nAnd so I thought, \"Okay, how\ndo I change the equation?\"\nAnd walked in, looked at the room,\nand I said, \"I know what\nyou're all thinking right now.\"\nWhat could I possibly learn\nfrom a professor who's 12 years old.\nDead silence.\nI'm like, \"Oh no, this is\ngoing to go horribly wrong.\"\nAnd then one of the guys\nin the audience jumps in,\nand he's like, \"Oh, that's ridiculous,\nyou got to be at least 13.\"\nEverybody started\nlaughing, it broke the ice.\nAnd I think what I was trying to do\nwas to take myself off the pedestal,\nand say, \"Look, I heard your feedback.\nYou told me that you didn't think\nI had anything to teach you,\nand I've got to acknowledge\nthat right up front\nand be open to the fact that that's true.\nAnd so I want to come in\nhere and learn from you,\nand I want to see if I\ncan curate a conversation\nwhere we all end up learning.\"\nAnd the feedback was night\nand day different afterward.\nOne person wrote, \"Although\njunior and inexperienced,\nthe professor dealt with the evidence\nin an interesting way.\"\nI was like, \"All right, I'll take it.\"\nAnd there was something\nreally powerful about saying,\n\"Look, I can't change the fact\nthat they hated my session.\nWhat I can do is convince them\nthat I was motivated to\nlearn from their criticism.\"\nI love this concept of the second score,\nand thank you for sharing that story.\nI think, very often we hear\nabout people like you who,\nif people didn't catch the math in there,\nyou were a PhD by age 25,\nand as far as I know,\nthe youngest tenured\nprofessor at Penn at 28.\nSo these are outrageously impressive\nmetrics of accomplishment.\nBut for you to share a story about,\nless than optimal performance\nand how you adjusted to it,\nand the incorporation of this second score\nthat you're referring to, I\nthink is really appreciated.\nBecause I think that as much as we hear,\n\"Oh, Jordan, took many more free throws\nand everyone just thinks\nabout all the ones he made.\"\nPeople think about all the ones he made.\nThat's the way the game works,\nthat's the way the mind\nworks, I should say.\nSo, I appreciate that\nyou've flushed it out\nwith a personal example.\nI too would want to turn\ninto a bear and disappear,\nbut I think that it's really\nimpressive what you did,\nand it makes me think\nthat the second score\nof getting a 10 at bringing\nthe three and a half up, right?\nAs it were, is really\nabout turning a score\ninto a verb process.\nOver and over again, as I do this podcast,\nand as I've taught in the classroom,\nwhat I keep coming back to is this idea\nthat we should be focusing more\non verbs and less on nouns.\nAnd we love to name things\nand categorize them,\nbut when we start living life\nthrough a lot of verb processes,\nso instead of being fit,\nand we think about or running as a thing,\nwe really think about\nlike just running, right?\nIt becomes less daunting\nand we accomplish far more.\nBut the idea that and this has this,\nthere are mathematical\nmodels of this I'm sure,\nbut where you're basically talking about,\nlike an integral right,\nas opposed to just some value, right?\nYou're talking about\nthe slope of the line.\nYeah.\nRight, so you're a three and a half,\nhow are you going to get to a\n10? Gosh, that's a huge gap.\nAnd you're dealing with\nbeing back on your heel psychologically\nfrom getting all this battering feedback\nfrom these highly\naccomplished individuals,\nall these Germans\nand literally wearing them\npresumably on their body.\nSo you, for you to see.\nAnd it's really about creating,\nit's about taking control\nof the slope of that line\nfrom the three onward.\nAnd it's really a forward\nlooking perspective.\nSo I don't think we're being\nan unduly psychological here analytic.\nI mean, I think it's really\nabout taking a moment state\nand a noun and turning it into a verb.\nYeah, I think that's right.\nI'm reminded the great\nphilosopher Homer Simpson,\nwho said that verbing weirds language,\nso it's harder to talk\nabout this stuff in verbs.\nI swear I didn't steal\nit from the Simpsons,\nbut if it came from Homer Simpson,\nlike I am all for it.\nYou have to, I mean, that's incredible.\nSmall brain, but given\nthe size of his brain\nand people have seen the\nimage, fairly robust knowledge.\nNo, I think you're onto something.\nI think verbs are active\nand we're drawn to them, I think, yeah,\na lot of times people\nreview their past work\nand they just, like, they end\nup shaming an earlier version\nof themselves and they,\nthey wallow in rumination.\nAnd what we want to try\nto do in that situation,\nwhich is easier said than done, is to say,\n\"All right, like, the\npurpose of getting feedback\nor advice is not to shame my past self\nis to educate my future self.\"\nWhich I think is very connected\nto a lot of the work on growth mindset\nthat you've been talking about.\nAnd there's been a\nfirestorm of controversy\naround can we teach growth\nmindset in schools lately?\nAnd I think what, what that\nis underscored for me is,\nlook, you can't expect someone to listen\nto one podcast episode or\ngo through one workshop\nand magically believe that they're capable\nof learning anything at any moment.\nThis is something we have to actively work\non on a daily basis.\nAnd part of doing that\nexactly as you've said,\nis thinking about this loop\nand saying, \"All right,\nthe person that I'm competing\nwith is my past self\nand I want to get a\nlittle bit better today\nthan I was yesterday.\"\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
