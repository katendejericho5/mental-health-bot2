    "transcript": "so this\nis something I designed kind of like you\nknow collaboration to show you\nspecifically you okay because uh so in\nother words this is an experiment it\ncould fail okay like any good experiment\nexactly all different yes you want to\nmix them sure shuffle them as much as\nyou want this is just one way to do it\nI'm not good at shuffling whatever you\nwant I'll just do this sort of like a\nyes kindergarten Shuffle there's\nprobably a kindergartener out there that\ncan really Shuffle card now as you're\ndoing this I want you to think of a card\nuh please but don't say it just think of\nit okay so right now as you're doing\nthis the location where that card is\nchanges because every time you cut\ncomplete Shuffle it's in a different\nlocation we don't know where it is let's\ndo\nthis even if I know exactly where it is\nyou don't know where it is correct name\nthe card Jack of Hearts you don't again\nyou don't know where it is I'll do it\nsuper slow and you say the word stop\nwhenever it feels right to you does not\nmatter to me when\nin stop okay I was about to to move more\nshould I stop no you can move it the one\ncard one one last move that's good yep\nlet me ask you a question do you want\nthe card to be first or second one or\ntwo your choice um second in the stack\nso not the first second correct and the\nthe card was Jack of Hearts so not the\nfirst second correct let's\nsee oh that's the\nfirst eight of diamonds and you want\nsecond yeah to be the Jack of Hearts\nthat would be\namazing I'm shocked I'm shocked too I'm\nshocked too um because I shuffled in air\nquotes the day you did Shuffle yeah you\ndid yeah with no intention whatsoever so\nwhen you think of a car let's give a mix\nwhen you think of a card okay don't say\nit say the word stop anytime you want\nthis one or this one or this one or this\none or this one whichever you\nwant this one even though you stopped on\nthis\nsure place your finger right on top\ntight tight okay let me ask you a\nquestion how crazy would it be if this\nis the card you're thinking of merely\nthinking of what's the card you're\nthinking of ace of diamonds it's a\ncommon card if you want you can change\nit to a different card or stick to this\none\nAce of Diamonds Ace of\nDiamonds it's crazy and and it could be\nany and and you also you had the card\nthe whole time right here with your\nfinger on top of it the whole time\nright what it's not the ace of diamonds\nit's not\nno oh goodness my friend it's still not\nso here's something I didn't teach I\ndidn't tell you this um the Queen of\nHearts she's considered a psychic card\nshe knew you're going to say the ace of\ndiamonds so in her pocket she took it\nout and she's she's holding\nit take a\nlook she's holding the ace of\ndiamonds M can I expect is this true of\nany other card yes this is a lot of\npeople don't know this but most um most\nQueens they they hold flowers let me\nshow you here\nflowers\nflowers and\nflowers this is sort of but not quite\nyeah\nwild you know open your let's do\nsomething with your phone open your\nphone open your phone let's do something\nwith your\nphone open to your\ncalculator okay and I don't want yeah\nzero out I don't want to see what you\ntype I'm going to turn around punch in\nfour digits but make it random don't\noverthink it four\ndigits do\nplus and now I want you to put a\nfour-digit number that's meaningful to\nyou it could be a code it could be an\naddress could be anything a date a year\nanything you like and then equal okay so\nright now it's a combination of a number\nthat's meaningful with a number that\nmeans absolutely nothing correct can we\nsay it uh do the equal sign you did at\nthe end right okay that's the\ncombination of both yeah perfect can I\nsee y so that's that number means\nnothing to you it's 12 915 I don't know\nif it's meaningful a meaningful number\nplus a you know and you did zero that\nbetween okay take these give them a bit\nof a mix as much as you want okay people\ncan make fun of my shuffling again I\nwant you to think why the number is\nimportant but don't say it why that\nparticular number is important\nokay\nyep it's not a code right it's not quite\na code is it it is a code it is a code\nbut it also means like a date or\nsomething like that um part of it no\nreally yeah is it's a it's an important\ncode it's an important code it's an\nimportant code H so let's do this um as\nI go through these okay I want you\nto pull one or two or three or four\ncards in one group one group goad as a\ngroup yeah one four I mean there we go\nthat's four right take four yeah sure\nokay put put them F and these are the\nthe the the it's four or five how many\nlet's see should be four yeah four\nperfect and you plucked them from\nsomewhere in here yeah could have been\nanywhere from here right uh the number\nthat's important to you what's the first\ndigit\nseven and then\nsix\nseven no way there's only one person on\nthis planet that knows this number no\neverybody does\nunfortunately nine goodness\ngracious that\nmakes no sense I mean it makes sense\nthat you would get it right because\nyou're you that's amazing this\ncombination hearkens back to something\nthat I learned when I was like 6 years\nold and was passed me by somebody that\nwould never ever re reveal that yeah\namazing wow that's crazy that's\ncrazy open your um open your camera okay\ntook a very bizarre photo okay if you\ndon't mind yeah of you just holding my\nwallet so usually I have my ID for this\nshow I took everything out sure uh so\nit's a nice walk right there and right\nthere nothing there right take a look\nnope okay nothing good for you yeah okay\nlet's do this um just look at me there's\na bit of\na we got it okay I took one photo can\nyou please close that first lock it in\nand then close it again let me ask you a\nquestion you know the we already spoke\nabout it uh the idea that I can make you\nchoose certain things or act according\nto what I want you to do right so if I\nask you to name any playing card\nseriously any playing card what would\nyou\nname doesn't matter which one uh three\nof diamonds you sure you'll do want to\nchange um three of diamonds okay so it\ncould be really any one of these I'm\ntelling you invin is going to I'm going\nto try to kind of force you uh don't let\nme so you know what's happening so just\ntake anyone you like anyone that you\nlike but halfway out halfway out okay\nhalfway out okay if you think if you\nthink I made you take that push you take\na different one I I don't don't but for\nsake of uh okay f i I like that I like\nthat sure sure take a different one then\num it's okay to move that yeah yeah yeah\num let's go with this one this so if is\nit three of diamonds correct if that's\nthe three of diamonds would that be\nimpressive it would just be wild can I\nask you an honest question yeah how\nimpressive would it be considering\nyou've seen me do stuff before be honest\nbetween 1 and 10 it would be a seven\nbecause I want to leave room for now I'm\ngoing for much much better if I what\nwhat if I do this and the three of\ndiamonds shoots out and LS right here\nthat would be wild that's a 10 no what\nwhat if what if it lends under my wallet\nthat would be spectacular what about\ninside the wallet that would be um\nwhat's the technical turn effing\nspectacular this this has been here the\nwhole can you open it yourself can you\nundo this no no right right\nthere okay open no no way what\nthe\ngoodness gracious let's do this again\ncan you can you close it again just lock\nit all all the way in lock it in and put\nthis in your pocket or far from anywhere\nyeah yeah we'll do this again okay um\nthe only criteria is that you do choose\na different card okay okay yeah I'll\njust do this and you said the word stop\nwhenever it feels right stop take the\ncard and just whichever doesn't not the\nthree of diamonds I hope no okay push it\nanywhere in the\nmiddle the wallet is there the wallet is\nhere name the card three of\nhearts in the\nwallet no no not not this\nwallet the\num remember we took a photo of you\nholding the wallet at the beginning\nempty it traveled to the wallet in the\nphoto three of Hearts is\nsaid take a look at the last\nphoto oh zoom on it it's the three of\nHearts\nwow goodness\ngracious wow wow wow this makes wait and\nif I go to the photo right before it\nit's actually a video of Cal Newport a\nprevious guest so just to prove that\nit's not like a multiple photos not that\nthat would explain anything and then um\nour cameraman Martin got a cameo there\ntoo\num mind blown oh my goodness what\nthe I don't know\nsorry it was great to see for once I'm\nspeechless good amazing\namazing that's amazing thank you thank\nyou very much thanks for I don't really\nknow what to say there's a neural\ncircuit\ngoing and there's another Circle neural\ncircuit excuse me that's involved in awe\nwhich is just\ngoing\ngood and you don't want to know how\nright you know in this case I I not only\ndo I not want to know how um it places\nthe brain into to a place of um there's\nno way how but it just happened it's a\ngood place to be yeah it is a good place\nto be"
