    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to this\n10 minute non-sleep deep rest\nprotocol.\nNon-sleep deep rest\nis a powerful tool\nthat can allow you to\ncontrol the relaxation\nstate of your nervous system\nand your overall state of mind.\nIt can restore mental\nand physical vigor.\nAnd it can be done any\ntime of day or night.\nIt's very simple to do.\nYou'll want to do this\nprotocol seated or lying down.\nSo if you're not already\nseated or lying down,\nplease do so now.\nYou'll also want\nto close your eyes.\nSo if your eyes aren't already\nclosed, please close them now.\nThroughout this\nprotocol, you'll want\nto breathe normally, unless\ninstructed to do otherwise.\nOne pattern of breathing\nyou'll be asked to do\nis to inhale deeply,\nideally through your nose.\nBut if you can't do\nit through your nose,\ninhale through your mouth.\nTry that now.\nInhale deeply through your nose.\nAnd then exhale all of your\nair through your mouth.\nLet's do that again.\nInhale deeply through your nose.\nAnd then exhale completely\nthrough your mouth.\nAnd as you exhale, exhale\nthrough thinly pursed lips,\nas if through a small straw.\nLet's repeat that\ntwo more times.\nInhale deeply through your nose.\nAnd then exhale completely\nthrough thinly pursed lips.\nOne more time.\nInhale deeply through your nose.\nAnd then exhale completely\nthrough your mouth\nthrough thinly pursed lips.\nBreathing in that way--\nthat is, inhaling\ndeeply through your nose\nand then exhaling\ncompletely through the mouth\nthrough thinly\npursed lips is known\nto slow your heart rate down\nand relax your nervous system.\nFeel free now to simply\nbreathe normally.\nNow, in your mind's\neye, imagine yourself\nstanding over yourself looking\nat your body, which is seated\nor lying down, and\nimagine holding\na flashlight or a spotlight\nand directing it at your feet.\nFocus your attention on whatever\nit is that your feet happen\nto be in contact with.\nIt could be socks, sandals,\nshoes, or merely the air.\nIt doesn't matter.\nFocus your attention\nspecifically\non the bottoms of your feet.\nAnd try to perceive whatever\nit is they are sensing.\nThey could be tingling.\nThey could even be numb.\nIt doesn't matter.\nNow imagine expanding\nthat spotlight\nto include the\ntops of your feet,\nyour shins, your calves,\nexpanding that spotlight\nfurther to include your\nthighs, your hamstrings, and up\nto your waist.\nNow with your entire\nlower body illuminated\ninside the beam of light\nfrom that spotlight,\ninhale deeply through your\nnose or through your mouth.\nAnd then exhale completely\nthrough thinly pursed lips\nuntil your lungs are empty.\nRepeat that twice more.\nAnd each time as\nyou exhale, imagine\nyour lower body sinking\ndown about a centimeter\ninto whatever surface you happen\nto be in contact with now.\nNow move the spotlight\nto your abdomen.\nAnd focus your attention on\nwhatever it is your abdomen\nis sensing.\nAs you Inhale your stomach\nshould move out slightly.\nAnd as you exhale,\nit should sink down.\nExpand the spotlight to\ninclude your upper abdomen,\nyour chest, your neck.\nAnd now in your\nmind's eye, imagine\nthat spotlight is expanding\nto include your arms as well.\nContinue to breathe normally.\nNow focus your\nperception on whatever\nsurface your back happens\nto be in contact with--\na shirt, a chair, a sofa--\nwhatever surface it\nhappens to be contacting,\nfocus on that contact now.\nSimply bring your attention\nand your perception\nto those points of contact.\nAnd as you do so, inhale\ndeeply again through your nose\nor through your mouth.\nAnd then as you exhale, imagine\nyour back and your upper body\nsinking about a centimeter\ninto whatever surface\nthey happen to be\nin contact with.\nNow move the spotlight\nto include your face,\nthe top of your head, and\nthe back of your head.\nAnd as you continue\nto breathe normally,\nfocus your perception\non relaxing\nthe muscles of your face.\nAnd as you continue\nto breathe normally,\nsee if you can extend the\nduration of your exhales\never so slightly.\nAnd now in your mind's eye,\nexpand the spotlight downward\nto include your neck, your\nchest, your arms, your abdomen,\nyour waist, your legs,\nand down to your feet.\nImagine yourself looking down\nat your own body illuminated\ninside of the spotlight.\nAnd in your mind's\neye, deliberately dim\nthat spotlight.\nMake the illumination\nless intense.\nInhale deeply again through\nyour nose or through your mouth.\nAnd then exhale completely\nthrough thinly pursed lips.\nAnd as you do so,\nimagine your entire body\nsinking into the surface\nit's in contact with.\nNow while continuing\nto breathe normally,\nmove your toes ever so slightly.\nIn doing so, you'll\nnotice that you\nare in control of\nyour nervous system,\nmeaning you direct your\nperceptions and your actions.\nMove your ankles and bend your\nknees just the slightest bit.\nYou can move your upper\nbody from side to side,\nyour head from side to side,\nor even nod just slightly.\nNow move your hands.\nLift your arms just a tiny bit.\nThen set them down again.\nAnd now, whenever you are\nready, slowly open your eyes.\nAnd as you do so, you'll\nnotice that normally,\nyour nervous system is bombarded\nwith sensory information,\nmostly visual\ninformation, which you\nhave eliminated during this\nnon-sleep deep rest protocol.\nAs you have now\nexperienced, you are\nin control of your perceptions.\nControlling your perceptions is\nsimply directing your attention\nto specific sensations.\nAnd you control which\nsensations you perceive\nby directing your attentional\nspotlight to whatever part\nor parts of your\nbody that you choose.\nNon-sleep deep rest\nprotocols, such as this one,\ncan help you restore your sense\nof mental and physical vigor,\ncan partially offset the effects\nof not getting enough sleep,\nand can also help you get better\nat falling and staying asleep.\nIt can be done any\ntime of day or night\nwhen you feel you need a\nmental and/or physical reset.\nThank you for joining me\nfor this non-sleep deep rest\nprotocol brought to you\nby Huberman Lab and AG1."
