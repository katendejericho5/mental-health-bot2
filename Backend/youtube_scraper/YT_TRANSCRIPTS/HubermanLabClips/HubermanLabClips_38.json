    "transcript": "The research paper I'd\nlike to discuss briefly\nthat beautifully embodies the runway\nthat led to the discovery\nof growth mindset\nis a paper from Dr. Carol Dweck,\nas well as her colleague, Claudia Mueller.\nAnd the title of the paper\nessentially says it all.\nThe title is Praise for intelligence\ncan undermine children's\nmotivation and performance,\nright?\nThat should be surprising\nthat praise for intelligence\ncan undermine motivation and performance.\nI would've thought, and I think\nmany people probably believe\nthat if you tell a child or an adult\nthat they're really good at something\nand you're genuine about that feedback,\nmeaning they're performing well,\nand you say, great,\nyou're doing really well,\nyou're so smart, you're so talented,\nthat their performance\nwould continue to improve,\nthat it would bolster their motivation\nto engage in that activity,\nwhich hopefully they enjoy.\nBut regardless, provided\nthat it's a safe activity,\nit's educational, what have you,\nthat it would serve to\nencourage them, right?\nThe kid thinks not only am\nI engaging in this activity,\nbut I'm getting positive feedback,\npresumably from people that I care about\nor whose opinion I care about,\nwouldn't that serve to\nelevate performance?\nIt does not.\nIn fact, the exact opposite happens.\nSo I'll just give you a\nfew of the key takeaways\nfrom this study.\nThe way it was done is very interesting.\nThey essentially gave\nfeedback about performance\nthat was linked up with\na child's intelligence,\ntelling kid they're\nsmart, they're talented,\nthat they can learn things really easily\nor that they're very good at\nlearning this sort of thing,\nand they called that\nintelligence feedback.\nOr they gave them what was\ncalled effort feedback.\nThe simple way to think\nabout effort feedback\nis that it's more attached to\nverbs as opposed to labels.\nSo effort, feedback\nconsists of things like\nyou tried really hard on that problem,\nit was great the way\nthat you applied effort,\nit was great the way that you persisted,\nit was great the way\nthat even when you got the wrong answer,\nyou spent 10 minutes thinking about it\nand then you tried again and again,\nor in some cases,\neven if they didn't get the\nright answer telling them,\nwell, even though you\ndidn't get the right answer,\nit's really terrific that\nyou continue to try, okay?\nSo intelligence feedback\nwas the sort of feedback\nthat was tied to labels of identity,\nthings like smart, talented, et cetera.\nWhereas effort feedback\nwas tied to verbs, choices,\nbehavioral and cognitive\nchoices that children made\nin an effort to learn or\nget better at something.\nSo in this study, which included\nover a hundred children,\nthey either got the\nintelligence type feedback\nor the effort type feedback,\nor there was a control group\nthat didn't get either the intelligence\nor the effort type feedback,\nand then they looked at a\nnumber of different outcomes.\nSo I'll just highlight a few\nexamples of what they found.\nFirst of all,\nthe kids that got the\nintelligence based feedback\nwhen they were then later\noffered problem sets\nthat were either challenging\nor were of the sort\nthat they knew they could perform well on,\nthey tended to select problems\nthat they knew they could perform well on.\nThese were what were referred\nto as performance goals.\nIn other words, they picked problems\nthat allowed them to\ncontinue to get the praise\nthat they had received previously\nabout being smart or talented.\nWhereas the kids that got\nfeedback about their strong effort\nwhen later presented with problems\nthat were either easy or\nhard, more often than not,\nthey picked the harder problems\nthat stood to teach them more.\nSo that's striking.\nIt says that if you tell a kid\nthat they're smart or talented\nand that's the reason\nwhy they perform well,\nwhen they encounter challenges,\nthey are likely to go with\nthe least amount of challenge\nso that they can continue\nto receive that praise or feedback.\nWhereas if you receive praise and feedback\nfor your strong effort,\nthen later you tend to pick\nenvironments, problem sets, et cetera,\nthat allow you to exert the very effort\nthat got you the praise\nin the first place.\nSo in both cases,\nthese children are essentially\nattached to the praise,\nright?\nIn some sense.\nI mean, we like to think that\nthey enjoy these activities\nand they're benefiting from them as well.\nBut in both cases, the\npraise really serves\nto reinforce a certain\npattern of behavior.\nBut in the case of giving\nintelligence feedback,\nthe kids are really just\ntrying to reinforce being told\nthat they're smart or talented,\nas opposed to reinforcing the\nengagement in the activity\nthat got them the praise\nin the first place.\nAnd the converse is also\ntrue when kids are told,\nhey, you really tried\nhard and that's great,\nor, I like how you persistent,\nor you're so persistent,\nI can really see how persistent you are\nin trying to get the right answer,\neven if you don't get the right answer.\nWell, then when you present those kids\nwith additional challenges,\nthey work very hard to stay in challenge.\nAnd guess what? No surprise.\nThe kids that are rewarded for effort\nand that continue to pick harder problems\noutperform the kids\nthat are given the intelligence\npraise and feedback\nby a large margin.\nSo what does this tell us?\nThis tells us that the narratives\nthat we hear from others,\nof course, reinforce certain\npatterns of behavior.\nWhat else does this tell us?\nThis tells us that if\nyou're a parent or teacher,\nyou have to be very careful\nabout giving feedback to a child\nthat is attached to their\nidentity around an endeavor,\nespecially if they're performing\nwell at that endeavor,\nright?\nNow, of course,\nif a child is not performing\nwell at something,\nyou also don't want to tell\nthem that they're stupid, right?\nYou don't want to tell them\nthat they're deficient, right?\nBut, that's a rare\noccurrence in the classroom\none would hope,\nthat's a rare occurrence on\nthe field, one would hope.\nBut what's very common, very, very common\nis that when we see children\nor adults performing well,\nwe tend to give them\nidentity labels as a way\nto try and reinforce whatever behavior\nwe observe and we like.\nNow the other thing they\nlooked at in this study,\nbesides whether or not\nthese kids would pick\nhard or easier challenges down the line\nwere the actual raw performance\non cognitive problems.\nAnd these data, I must say,\nare just so interesting.\nThey took the kids\nand they gave them all\nthe same problem sets,\nand all the kids across the board,\nwhether or not they were getting\nintelligence praise or effort praise,\nor they were in the control group\nwere performing more or less the same way.\nThey were getting some\nof these questions right,\nsome of these questions wrong.\nThen they gave them praise\nafter they completed those problems.\nThey either got intelligence praise,\nyou're so smart, you're so talented\nor they got effort praise,\nyou tried so hard, you really\npersisted, that's fantastic.\nThen later they gave them\nanother set of problems\nand they looked at performance.\nNow remember, the first time around\nall the kids got some\nof the questions right\nand some of the questions wrong,\nso there's room for\nimprovement for everybody.\nWhat they found was absolutely striking.\nThe kids that were in the control group,\nso they didn't get any\nspecific form of praise,\nthey performed more or less the\nsame way as they did before.\nSo if they were getting\n75% of the answers right the first time,\nthey got 75% of the answers\nright the second time.\n25% wrong in both cases.\nThe kids that were in the\nintelligence praise group\nthe you are so smart, you're\nso talented, praise group,\ntheir performance went down significantly.\nWhereas the kids that were\nin the effort praise group,\ntheir performance increased\nsignificantly, okay?\nSo this is a bi-directional effect\nwhere giving intelligence\npraise reduces performance,\nand giving effort praise\nimproves performance,\nwhich is absolutely striking\nand tells you everything you need to know,\nwhich is if you're a\nparent, you're a teacher,\nand, of course, as we all\ngive ourselves feedback,\nrewarding yourself for effort\nis the best way to improve performance.\nRewarding yourself based\non identity labels,\nso smart, so talented, you're\na great athlete, et cetera,\nall that stare in the mirror\nand do self affirmation stuff\ncan actually undermine performance,\nand in fact, it does\nundermine performance.\nIt may not do it right away,\nbut eventually it does.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
