    "transcript": "How you think about stress,\nimpacts the stress response\nin profound ways.\nSo this paper, rethinking\nstress, the role of mindsets\nand determining stress, did a very simple\nset of manipulations.\nThey had people in one\ngroup listen to a lecture\nthat effectively was titled, quote,\nthe effects of stress are\nnegative and should be avoided.\nAnd that lecture included\ninformation about how stress\ndiminishes performance and\nhow it can diminish health\nand vitality learning and\nperformance, productivity.\nIt increases uncertainty, et cetera.\nAnd all of that information is true.\nA separate group listened\nto a lecture entitled:\nExperiencing Stress Improves\nHealth and Vitality.\nAnd again, that information is true.\nNow I realize that some of\nyou are probably still asking\nhow can it be that stress\ndiminishes health and performance\nand stress also enhances\nhealth and performance?\nAnd the answer lies in two things.\nOne, the level of stress and\ntherefore the level of hormones\nthat are released in\nresponse to that stress,\nthe duration over which\nthe stress response occurs.\nBut the key variable here\nis that our cognitive\nunderstanding about\nwhat stress does impacts\nwhether or not our physiology\ngoes down the direction\nof debilitating or\nenhancing effects of stress.\nSo we've got a condition here where people\nare being informed very\ndifferently about what stress does.\nIn one case, it's the\nstress is bad message.\nIn the other case, it's\nthe stress is good message.\nAnd there are many different\nexperiments within this paper,\nbut one of the more\ninteresting ones, I believe,\nis where they looked at work performance,\nboth in terms of performance\nof what they call soft tasks.\nSo these are somewhat easier\ntasks as well as hard tasks.\nAnd when you look at the group\nthat was given information\nabout how stress diminishes\nperformance in the soft tasks.\nSo the somewhat easy tasks,\nyou don't see much change\nin their performance as you\ncompare before the learning\nabout stress is diminishing\nto after the learning,\nwhereas the people who learn\nthat stress is enhancing\nactually experience some\nimprovement in work performance,\neven though the challenge\nthat they're facing\nisn't that great.\nSo again, what this means\nis that learning that stress\ncan enhance performance by\nproviding people true information\nabout how stress can enhance performance,\ncan increase performance\neven in the context of stuff\nthat's not that hard, not that stressful.\nEven more interesting is that\nwhen you look at performance\non tasks that are considered hard,\nand you compare the\nstresses diminishing group,\nmeaning the group that was taught\nthat stress is diminishing,\nand compare that to the\nstresses enhancing group,\nyou see a really divergent response.\nThe people that learn that\nstress diminishes performance\ndid not improve at all.\nWhereas the people that learn\nthat stress can enhance performance,\nenhance their performance significantly.\nNow, keep in mind all\nthey are doing is learning\nthat stress can enhance their performance\nand then they're given the task\nand they're performing better.\nSo that's pretty spectacular, right?\nThere's no training session\nthat they went and did,\nthey didn't practice these items\nthat they were being tested on in between.\nThey weren't given a bunch of drills to do\nand they didn't take a\nlot of time to do it.\nThey just heard a tutorial about\nhow stress can enhance performance.\nAnd that, I believe is\nremarkable because what it says\nis that our cognitive\nappraisal about stress,\nwhich we all are going\nto experience in life.\nElevated heart rate\nnarrowing, a visual focus,\nshifting of blood away from the periphery.\nAll of these things are\ncharacteristic features\nof the stress response that we learn,\nespecially in this day and age.\n'Cause it's talked about a\nlot in popular culture that,\noh, you know, all of these mechanisms\nwere put into us in\norder for us to get away\nfrom the saber tooth tiger or the lion\nthat's trying to eat us.\nLet's be fair, the stress response\nis there for a lot of reasons,\nnot just because of saber\ntooth, tigers and lions.\nI mean, that's kind of\na story that we make up.\nThe stress response is\ninherent not just to us,\nbut to other species\nas a way to mobilize us\neither away from things or toward things.\nWe need to have somewhat of\na stress response in order\nto engage in adaptive challenge.\nYes, it's true that hundreds\nand thousands of years ago,\nthose adaptive challenges\nprobably involved hunting,\nbut they probably involved\nsocial challenges as well.\nDo you think it was easy\nfor cavemen and women\nto engage socially and kind\nof settle out their romantic\ninteractions, et cetera?\nDo you think it was easy\nfor them to raise children?\nNo, of course not.\nThe stress response is there\nfor a variety of reasons,\nnot just to get away from predators.\nThe really exciting thing\nthat's been discovered\nin the course of Ali\ncrumb's work and other work\nin the last couple of decades\nis that the stress response\nis neither good nor bad.\nThe stress response depends\non whether or not you believe\nthe sensations that you're experiencing.\nElevated heart rate narrowing,\na visual focus, et cetera,\nare serving to enhance your performance\nor diminish your performance.\nAnd this study really points\nto the fact that just learning\nthat it can enhance performance,\ncan enhance performance.\nNow, I know a number of\nyou are probably saying,\nwait, but stress doesn't feel good, right?\nAnd oftentimes we experience\nstress under conditions\nwhere we're trying to learn\nor get good at something\nor listen better or do something,\nand it actually is\ndiminishing performance.\nAnd I think it's important\nto acknowledge that,\nthis study and studies like\nit are not saying that stress\nbecomes pleasant as a\nsensation in the body,\nnor is it saying that it always leads\nto improved performance.\nI don't want you to think\nthat's the take home message.\nSometimes it does, it can,\nas was demonstrated in\nthis research paper.\nBut oftentimes, as we know,\nstress diminishes our performance.\nIt takes us away from the\nlandmarks we want to hit.\nIt takes us away from the\ngrades we want to get.\nIt takes us away from\nquote unquote showing up\nhow we want to, right?\nNo one wants to have the\nblotchy skin and the sweating\nand the quaking of voice\nwhen we're trying to do\npublic speaking and things of that sort.\nNo one wants any of that.\nWhat's important to\nunderstand is that learning\nthat stress is a way\nof mobilizing resources\nin the body does two things.\nFirst of all, it allows us to\ndampen or adjust the stress\nresponse in real time.\nAnd it allows us to understand\nthat that stress response\nheightens our level of focus\nin a way that allows us\nto pay attention to the\nthings that are going wrong\nin a way that allows us to make correction\nto those errors in the future.\nSo if you think back to that study,\nthat ERP study where they\nmeasured brain activity\nand they looked at people\nwho had a fixed mindset\nversus people who had a growth mindset,\nand the people who had a\ngrowth mindset were paying\nmore cognitive attention\nto what was happening\nduring errors and after errors.\nWell, this stress is enhancing\nmindset is very powerful\nbecause what it does is\nit shifts one's attention\naway from the kind of somatic\nexperience of, oh my goodness,\nmy heart rate is elevated,\nI'm sweating, I'm quaking,\nI sound terrible, I feel\nterrible, I look terrible,\net cetera, to a mode of\nallocating more of our thinking,\ntoward analyzing why\nthings might be going wrong\nand something else powerful\nhappens when we embrace\na stresses enhancing mindset as well.\nWhen we embrace a stress\nenhancing mindset,\nit turns out that some of the\nvery physiological processes\nthat we call quote unquote\nstress shift in important ways,\nsome of those include the\nduration over which the stress\nhormone cortisol is released.\nAnd in fact, I don't even\nreally want to call it\na stress hormone because cortisol\ndoes so many other things as well.\nAnd it's not bad.\nYou need cortisol, believe me,\nyou want cortisol especially\nreleased early in the day\nand in response to acute stressors.\nWhat you don't want is for\ncortisol to stay elevated\nfor long, long periods of time,\nand you especially don't want it\nto interfere with your sleep.\nSo much so that I think at times I wonder\nwhether or not our philosophy on stress\nshould be that stress is fantastic for us,\nexcept when it interferes with our sleep.\nAnd when stress becomes terrible for us\nis when it starts to\nbe chronically elevated\nand especially when it\nstarts to inhibit our ability\nto sleep well enough and long enough.\nSo the point here is that when we embrace\na stresses enhancing mindset,\nwe are able to have shorter\nduration release of cortisol.\nWe are also able to engage what's called\nincreased stroke volume\nunder conditions of stress.\nThis gets a little bit technical,\nbut the amount of blood\nthat your heart can pump\nwith each beat turns out\nto be a key metric of stress.\nWhen we are very stressed,\neven though we need to mobilize\na lot of resources,\nsomewhat paradoxically,\nour total stroke volume\ncan actually be reduced.\nAnd we tend to shuttle\nblood in other resources\ntowards the core of our\nbody and towards major limbs\nand away from things like\nour brain and our periphery.\nSo one of the key measures\nof how a stress response\nquote unquote is going\nis how much peripheral\nblood flow there is.\nAnd when we are more relaxed\nunder conditions of stress,\nthere tends to be more\nperipheral blood flow.\nWhen we are more anxious, more panicked,\nunder conditions of stress,\nperipheral blood flow is lower.\nAnd in a remarkable set of\nexperiments ROM and colleagues\nhave shown that when we\nare just taught that stress\ncan be enhancing and then we are placed\ninto a stressful environment,\neither because we are imagining stress\nor we are experiencing real stress,\nand then our physiology is measured.\nWhat is observed is that\nthe total amount of blood\nthat the heart can pump with\neach beat is actually increased\nperipheral blood flow increases.\nAnd our ability to maintain\ncognition to think clearly\nunder conditions of stress increases.\nAnd again, the only\nmanipulation here is a tutorial\nabout how stress can be enhancing,\nwhich is essentially what\nI'm telling you right now.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
