    "transcript": "I'm not teaching good side of life.\nSo I had to figure out a\nway when I came on in 2016\nof teaching you what life really is\nfor the majority of us is hell.\nAnd so, while people love to\nshow you the cars and the house\nand the vacations and shit,\nall that's good, all that's happy.\nI'm going to show you the side\nthat I know most you're going through.\nAnd people hide very well.\nI don't want to hide anymore.\nI hid it for 24 fucking years.\nSo that's why now I told\nyou we can talk about\nwhatever you want,\nbecause as human beings, the\nfirst thing we have to learn,\nI also stuttered real bad growing up.\nSo if you hear me stutter\nevery now and then,\nit's because that was\npart of my life also.\nSo it's funny, human beings\nwant to show you the best side\nand they want to hide the worst side.\nFor me, I'm going to teach\nyou how to be vulnerable,\nbecause that's the only\nway you fix yourself.\nYou don't fix yourself by coming out here\nand me selling you some fucking books.\nThat's why I don't have 'em, I forgot 'em.\nI'm glad people got\nsomething from the book.\nI want you to learn that\nthe only way you grow\nis how to look at yourself\nand say, \"Okay,\" like I\ndid, table longer than this\nand what the fuck I have\nto do to get somewhere?\nThere was nothing good on there, nothing.\nYeah, I love playing\nbasketball, I left that out.\nThat's something I love to do.\nI don't care about that.\nThat didn't make the fucking list,\n'cause the list that I had to live by\nwas the very list that was to\nget me at this table with you,\nto talk to you, to the\nnormal human beings was\nI once was about how you can get somewhere\nand how it looks, looks very ugly.\nThere's no fucking passion,\nthere's no fucking motivation.\nThere's no, \"Oh my God, man, I fucking...\"\nNo, every day of your life just doing.\nNo passion, no discipline, no motivation.\nAll these words, I hate people, I hate...\nThat's so many people\nfucking use these words now,\n'cause it's watered.\nIt's someone's sitting\nin a room by themselves\nand they figure themselves out\nand say, \"God, this is\ngoing to fucking suck.\"\nWhere's passion when you're 300 pounds?\nWhere's the motivation when\nyou can't read and write?\nWhere is it?\nSo how did this happen?\nI just fucking did, I just did.\nI said maybe at the end of this journey,\nthere'll be something there for me.\nIf not, I can read.\nIf not, I'm 185 fucking pounds.\nThere's no magic potion.\nThere's no, oh, let me wake\nup and look at some shit.\nNo, all those words are overused.\nThey're bullshit.\nIt's bullshit.\nJust do, you're living,\nhow do you want to live?\nHow do you want to die?\nHow do you want to fucking be remembered?\nThat's it, that's it, period.\nThe word haunted is ringing in my head.\nI think it's such a powerful word,\nbecause I was about to say,\nit seems like a huge part of your process,\nmaybe the entire process is\nit's all stick, no carrot.\nYou talk about the carrot,\nthe positive thing,\nand then there's the stick,\nthe thing you're trying to avoid.\nI feel like it's, the way\nit's landing for me is\nit's all stick and gas pedal.\nThat's it.\nThere's no carrot.\nYou're not imagining,\n\"Oh, when I'm a paramedic,\nwhen the book is published,\"\nand obviously you set those goals\nand you make those targets.\nBut it's all stick.\nAll stick.\nNo carrot.\nThink about that.\nI'm waking up right now\nstudying, I have a test tomorrow.\nI already passed the fucking test.\nThink about that.\nEvery day in my life,\nthat's what I must do\njust to retain what I learned.\nFour hours plus a day, I\ngo through and do that.\nThere's no stick or there's only a stick.\nThere's never been a carrot.\nWhich is why when I speak to people,\nI have to figure out a\nway to resonate with them,\n'cause all I want to say to them is,\nlet me teach you the real\nlife, how it really is,\nthe reason why you're a loser\nand the reason why you're\nnot fucking making it\nand the reason why you're trying\nto go through all these...\nI go to all these fucking conventions,\nspeak all the fucking time.\nI look in the fucking audience\nand these people sign up, sign up, sign up\nfucking every year to go to convention,\nthinking they're going to learn\nsomething fucking different.\nNo, you're lazy, you\nknow exactly what to do,\nexactly what to do,\n'cause even me in my state\nof, I can't read and write,\nI knew exactly what to do.\nIt just sucks doing it, it sucks to do it.\nIt sucks to wake up every\nmorning of your life\nand say, \"God, man, I'm not smart.\"\nSo guess what I got to do?\nI got to study the same shit\nthat I got one of the highest\nscores in the nation on\nand do it again, do it again, do it again.\nIt's not just there, it's not\njust there permanently for me.\nSo yeah, it's all stick, it's all stick.\nThe only carrot you have is maybe, maybe,\n'cause whenever I take these\ntests that are real hard\nin the back of my brain,\nit's like, \"A good chance you're\nnot going to make it Goggins.\nThis ain't you, bro, this ain't you.\nYou weren't born like\nthis, this ain't you.\nThe real you bro, study all you want to,\nbut the second that\nfucking computer comes on\nwith 150 questions, this ain't you, man.\"\nAnd somehow it comes back, I passed.\nI passed again, passed again.\nBut that ruled me back here every time.\nIt's saying, \"That ain't\nyou bro, that ain't you.\"\nAnd I have to outwork that voice.\nWhen I'm taking that test\nand I get to a question, I\ndon't know the fucking answer.\nI'm like, \"Fuck man.\"\nAnd then say, \"I told you man,\nthat ain't you, you 300 pounds, man.\nYou sit at home, and you\nfigure out how to do your hair,\nthat's what you do,\nhow to come to school\nwith the reverse baldness\nwhen you're 16, that's you.\"\nSo there is no get out of jail free card.\nThis is why I say stay hard,\nbecause when you weren't given the gifts,\nthe only thing you can\ndo in life is stay hard.\nAnd I know people cannot stand me.\nThey can't stand this talk.\nThis is all you can do.\nThere's no magic pill or a magic potion.\nAll you can do is outwork\nthe man that God created\nor woman in you.\nAnd what that looks like is unfun.\nThat's why I said do not\ndo a documentary on me,\nbecause people will not see the truth.\nThey will see what they want to see\nis I don't want to live like that.\nGood, good.\nAnd you will live exactly\nthe way you live now,\nquestioning who you are,\nwondering what is possible,\nwondering what you are capable of doing.\nThat's how that looks.\nOr you can be me, which am I happy?\nI don't know.\nNever thought about it.\nDon't really care about it,\n'cause all I really cared about\nwas when I looked in that fucking mirror,\nI saw a piece of shit.\nHappiness wasn't on the mirror\nat 16, around 300 pounds.\nIt wasn't like, \"Oh my,\nI'm looking for happiness.\"\nNo, I'm looking at myself in the mirror\nand say, \"All right motherfucker,\nyou did again today.\nYou're a bad boy, 'cause that sucks.\"\nI have about a couple minutes\nof that, I got the carrot.\nSecond, lay down and go\nto bed, the carrot's gone,\nbecause I'm waking up\nall through the night\nto check the work I did that day.\nDid I get this drug right?\nDid I get this right?\nDid I get that right?\nWhat did I do?\nOh my God, fuck, I'm really losing it.\nStick.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
