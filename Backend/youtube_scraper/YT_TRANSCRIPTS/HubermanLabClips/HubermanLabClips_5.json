    "transcript": "You mentioned that boundaries\nare something that we do\nand requires that the other do nothing.\nYes.\nCan we go a little bit further into that\nbecause it's a beautiful concept,\nthis notion of boundaries,\nbut like gaslighting, narcissism\nand all the other things\nthat we hear about nowadays,\nI think are often badly misunderstood.\nSo tell us more about boundaries\nand how that looks in\nthe action sense of it.\nAnd this is all so connected\nto what you're saying,\nthe other relationship,\nI'm a person, you're a person,\nand so many times that's\nactually is what gets merged.\nAnd so my kid gets upset\nthat I say they can't watch another show.\nAnd a parent really in that moment,\nit's like whose feelings are whose?\nLike they were upset, was I upset?\nA second ago, I thought\nI should set the boundary\nand now all of a sudden\nI'm changing my mind.\nThere is this complete role\nkind of confusion and merger,\nwhich is one of the main reasons\nthat kids get actually really scared\nand escalate their behavior\n'cause they don't have a sturdy leader\nwhen they really need one, right?\nSo boundaries are what we\ntell someone we will do\nand they require the other\nperson to do nothing.\nI like this definition\nfor a lot of reasons,\nI'm just very practical.\nSo it allows me, after I set a boundary,\nto like assess was that\na boundary or not, right?\nBecause let's take the TV example.\nIt's whatever time at night,\nmy kid has just watched a show\nand they know they're\nsupposed to watch one show\nand then turn off the TV.\nI hear from parents a lot,\n\"My kid doesn't listen\"\nor \"My kid doesn't respect my boundaries.\"\nAnd I'll say, \"Okay, that sounds\nhard, let's get into that.\"\nSo then they'll say, \"So I\ntold my kid to shut off the TV\n\"and they just kept watching.\n\"They just kept on.\"\n\"I told my kid to stop\njumping on the couch\n\"and they kept jumping.\n\"They don't respect my\nboundaries, they don't listen.\"\nTo me, this is like a\nbeautiful example of like,\nthis is a problem, I agree,\nbut this is not a boundary problem.\nYou made a request of your child.\nAnd frankly, if you have\nyour, I'm making this up,\nseven year old watching TV,\nI'm not so good at putting away\nTV and a phone at night like\nit's just hard for me to do.\nSo your seven year old\nprobably is just addicted\nto what's ever happening.\nAnd we're kind of asking\nour kid to do our job for us\nbecause we don't want\nour kid to be mad at us\nor whatever it is.\nA boundary in that\nsituation would be saying,\n\"Ooh, you didn't put off the TV.\n\"Look, by the time I get over there,\n\"if you haven't turned off the TV\n\"and I don't want to do this but I will,\n\"I will take the remote out\nof your hand and shut it off.\"\nA boundary is saying,\nooh, after my request doesn't work,\ncan you get off the couch,\nyou can jump on the floor.\nLook, if by the time I get over there\nyou haven't gotten off the\ncouch, I will pick you up.\nThat is like, I would say,\nI'm not going to put the\nsuccess of my intervention\nin my like seven year old's hand.\nI care too much about my own needs\nand my own role as a leader\nin my home to do that, right?\nSame thing with let's say in-laws.\n\"Oh my mother-in-law\ndoesn't respect my boundary,\n\"she always shows up without calling.\"\nNow I don't want to get to this point\nand there's a lot of things\nin a relationship we can do\nbefore we get to this point but\nif that's really a boundary,\nand I have a very kind of\nintrusive mother-in-law,\na boundary would be saying,\n\"Look, this is going to be\nawkward and I know you mean well\n\"but the next time you come unannounced,\n\"I will come to your car and say,\n\"'Oh, this time doesn't work for us.\n\"'You cannot come in,'\n\"and I will go back into my\nhouse and close the door.\"\nNow there's going to be\nlots of feelings around that\nbut you are now setting a true boundary.\nAnd when we say our kids don't listen,\nthose are often situations,\nnot all of them,\nbut there's a big percentage\nwhere I'm actually not setting\na boundary early enough\nand in a sturdy enough way\nwhich is what my kid needs\nbecause at that point,\nthey simply don't have the\nskills to inhibit an urge\nand they need me to be\nthe boundary for them.\nWe hear sometimes that\nkids are craving rules.\nThey're craving boundaries.\nI don't know, I was kind of a\nwild adolescent and teenager,\nmaybe a little more than wild.\nI don't recall ever craving rules\nbut I do recall paying attention\nto their lack of presence.\nSo what of that,\nyou know, is this notion\nthat kids really want\nand crave rules and boundaries,\nis that sort of a, I don't know,\nprojection that we put onto them?\nAnd I'm not exploring this just for fun,\nI'm exploring it because I think that\none thing that's very helpful\nin setting boundaries,\nespecially with kids,\nis the idea that, gosh,\neven if it's a bit painful\nto see them in discomfort,\nthere's that empathy piece\nthat you talked about before.\nThat empathic attunement\ncan get in the way of boundaries, right?\nAnd they're not mutually exclusive\nbut these are somewhat\ncompeting forces at times.\nSo if we know or if we can acknowledge\nor at least explore this idea\nthat rules are deep down\nwhat they really want,\nnot just what they need-\nYes.\nMaybe it would help.\nYes, and I think by the way,\nin my taking the remote away\nor taking my kid off the\ncouch, just to be clear,\nif I do that to my kid,\nlike they're not going to say,\n\"Oh mom, you are the best\nmom in the world, thank you.\"\nThey're going to cry and scream.\nAnd that's where boundaries and empathy,\nthose two parts of our job\nactually do always go together.\nI think they're actually partners,\nthey're not actually at odds\nbecause as soon as my kid is\nupset, what I would say to them\nis, \"Oh, you wanted to jump on the couch?\n\"It's not as much fun on the floor?\n\"Oh, you really wanted\nto watch another show,\n\"you didn't even want it this big,\n\"you wanted to watch it this big.\"\nIt sounds crazy 'cause you're like,\n\"Wait, why am I empathizing\nwith that feeling?\n\"They just kind of disobeyed.\"\nNo, they're two different things,\nI'm doing my job in setting a boundary.\nThey're actually doing their\njob and feeling their feelings.\nThat's actually their job.\nThe only way you can ever\nlearn to regulate a feeling\nis through feeling the feeling.\nSo they're doing their job,\nnow I'm going to validate,\nand this is how kids\nlearn emotion regulation;\nboundaries, they feel, I\nvalidate, I hold the boundary,\nover and over and over.\nSo do kids crave rules?\nAnd I think one of the issues\nis that most parenting\napproaches have one or the other\nand I think they're both\nvery incomplete strategies.\nIf you just lead with rules, right?\nI don't know who said\nit, definitely wasn't me,\nlike what is it?\nRules without relationship\nlead to rebellion.\nYeah, that's what happens, right?\nSo that's not good,\nbut I see this day and age\nwe've swung the other direction.\nIt is also not a complete\nparenting strategy\nwhen your kid is jumping\non the couch to do nothing\nif you think that's dangerous and to say,\n\"Oh, you really want to jump, jump, jump\n\"and such big feelings.\"\nLike that's not what kids need.\nI think kids crave boundaries\nand they crave feeling\nseen and understood.\nBecause as kids are growing up,\nlike I think the questions\nthey're always asking parents,\neven though of course,\nthey never say this,\nit's just, \"Am I real and am I safe?\"\nEvery interaction that's\nwhat they're asking us.\nThe reason we have to\nvalidate their feelings\nwhen they're upset, even\nthough they're so upset\nthat their string cheese\nbroke, whatever it is,\nis feelings don't have markers like blood\nor like they don't know.\nAnd so when we say,\n\"Oh, you wanted your string\ncheese to be together.\"\nWhat we're really saying\nis the things you experience\ninside of you are real.\nBut kids are also desperate to know like\nhow far do things go?\nNo one likes to feel\nboundaryless as a kid,\nthat's terrifying, right?\nAnd so when we set a boundary,\nwe actually say to a kid,\nlike I will always protect you.\nLike I won't let things\nget so far out of control.\nSo I do think, I don't think if it's rules\nbut kids crave connection\nand I think boundaries and\nkind of validation and empathy,\nthey are the two forms of connection\nthat kids, yeah, are really desperate for.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full\nlength
