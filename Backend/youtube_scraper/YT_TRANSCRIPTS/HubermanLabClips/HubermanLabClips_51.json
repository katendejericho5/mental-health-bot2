    "transcript": "It sounds like friction\nis something you're very familiar with.\nIt's a word, just I feel is like-\nYes.\nCast above us right now\nin bold face highlighted,\nunderlined letters.\nFriction is growth, yes.\nFriction, like you're up in the morning,\nand I imagine David Goggin's\ngoing to the coffee maker,\nstretching out, good morning sunshine,\nand you're telling me from\neyelids open, there's friction.\nYes, and that is the thing that people,\nthey don't fucking get, the\nbiggest misunderstanding\nabout David Goggins of all time.\nWhether you believe in God or not, I do,\nhe put this lab rat, which\nis me, on this planet,\nand said, \"Let me fuckin'\nsee what a beat up,\n\"abused kid, who can\nbarely learn, barely learn,\n\"who has a twisted body,\nmessed up genetics,\n\"sickle cell, this and that,\nlet me give him everything\n\"that pretty much disqualifies\nyou from the military.\"\nBut back then, it wasn't [indistinct].\n\"And let's put 'em in this\nand see what comes out of it.\"\nSo to do that, friction,\nyou don't wake up in the morning time\nand go to the coffee maker.\nMatter of fact, sometimes\nyou don't even sleep.\nWhat it requires is when\nit's 2:00 in the morning,\nand my brain is thinking\nabout a fuckin' drug,\nand I got to get up and look in my book\nto see if that drug is how I remember it,\nand this is every day of my fuckin' life.\nThat's why when I train a\nfighter or I train someone,\nI'm like, \"You have no fuckin'\nidea how great you really are\n\"because you are using such minimal,\n\"minimal of what you have.\"\nAnd if people can learn to\nfocus, this is what's possible.\nWhile it may not be pretty...\nLike people who want to\ndo a documentary on me,\nI go, \"No, I don't want you\nto do a documentary on me,\"\nbecause I will have normal\neveryday people picking me apart.\n\"Oh, his life as miserable.\nWho wants to live like that?\n\"It's crazy how he, it's\nalmost like he's sick.\n\"He's psychotic.\"\nThe most frustrating\nthing in the world for me\nis when normal people\njudge a man like myself\non what it really takes to\nextract greatness from nothing.\nIt takes every bit of who you\nare if you choose that route.\nIf you don't, merry Christmas,\ndo what you got to do.\nBut yeah, all these things\nfor me, like I told you,\nand I'm going to keep it real.\nI'm not coming here to talk\nabout perform without purpose.\n'Cause I go through,\nwhen I write these books,\nI go through, I try to\ndumb down David Goggins.\nHow can I give normal\npeople, and I'm normal,\nbut I found something that\nmost don't want to find.\nHow can I speak to people\nand give them something\nfrom this crazy psychotic\nbrain that I've developed,\nhow can I give them that?\nSo I sit down with Jennifer for years\nand write down, \"Perform without purpose.\n\"Callous your mind, armor your mind,\n\"the cookie jar, the\naccountability mirror,\"\nshit that people can\nfuckin' use in their lives.\nNo, no, I'm glad it helps you,\nbut the barbaric life that I\nlive, that you have to live,\nthe almost obsession that\nyou must have to be great,\nyou can't put that shit\nin a fuckin' book, bro.\nYou can't put in a book, you can't.\nYou can't write about it.\nIt has to be experienced.\nIt has to be experienced.\nAnd you can't even,\nafter you experience it\nto write it in a book,\nit would seem like he\nneeds to be locked up.\nToo gory.\nIt's too gory.\nIt doesn't make sense for a guy\nthat every second of the day,\nhe is trying to extract\nmore from something.\nHe's constantly thinking.\nHe's constantly disciplined,\nnever going off the path.\nWhatever is injured on\nhim, he figures a way.\nIt's a conqueror's mindset,\nand very few people, if any,\ncan really understand what that is.\nI'm almost 50, and I've been\nthis way for almost 30 years.\nWhat do you do for fun?\nThese questions, I don't get 'em,\nI don't understand 'em, so yeah.\nI get asked that sometimes,\nwhat you for fun?\nI start listing off all this stuff,\nlike podcasting, reading,\nworking out. [laughs]\nBut, so some of that resonates,\nbut I think what's so truly unusual\nabout what you're\ndescribing, your process,\nis that from go, it's hard.\nAnd I have to ask, was being 300 pounds,\nI'm using the words you've described-\nNo, do it.\nYou've said it before.\nYou had a tendency at\none point in your life,\nearly on, tell lies, try\nand get people's approval.\nLied my ass off.\nCrazy haircuts,\nattention seeking and yet, all\nof that triggered something\nthat now is extraordinary.\nDo you think those\nhardships were necessary\nto flip the switch?\nI don't know if they were necessary,\nbut it was something that made me feel,\nI didn't feel good, it was easy.\nThe brain that I was given as a child,\nit was easy to go home and think about\nhow do I want to be a freak today?\nHow do I want to show up to\nschool today and be a freak?\nIt didn't require me going\nhome and opening a book up\nand saying it's going to take me all year\nto learn this fuckin' page.\nSo instead of learning that page,\nI learned how to become a character,\nand maybe that character that I created,\nthat 300 pound, insecure guy\nthat used to\nfake-it-till-I-make-it type of guy,\nlet me become your friend,\nlet me lie to you until\nyou like me type of guy.\nWhen you have any kind of,\nany manhood, womanhood,\na human being, a soul, a\nspirit, any, I had no...\nI must have had just this much pride,\n'cause that's exactly what\nopened the door for me.\n'Cause every day you were a character,\nevery day you were a clown,\nevery day you opened that Spanish book\nor that science book or English book,\nand you looked at it, it\nlooked like a foreign language.\nAnd you're saying, \"Where do\nI start? Where do I start?\"\nAnd obviously, it was necessary,\nthe more I talk about\nit, it was necessary.\n'Cause what happened is I became haunted\nby the mere fact that\nthis is my existence,\nand you got to live with that,\nand I lived with it for a lot of years,\nuntil I sat back and\nsaid, \"Okay, all right.\n\"I know what this takes,\"\nand when you sit back\nas fucked up as I was,\nand I had a laundry list,\na table like this of what I have to do\nto become just a human being\nthat can make ends meet,\nthat can make a thousand dollars\na month just to get there\nwas like, oh my God, dude.\nI'm 16, 17, I can't read, I can't write.\nAnd oh my God, I'm so\nbehind the power curve,\nand my brain is about being\ndepressed and my dad beat,\nmy mom's not home and kids are\ncalling me nigger at school,\nand I'm like, \"Oh my God,\nman, what the fuck do I do?\"\nAnd it wasn't like someone\ncame around and said,\n\"Hey man, you can do\nthis.\" This is all me.\nSome people want to know\nwhere's this cold man come from?\nI'm not trying to be cold.\nIt's the reality of my life.\nIt's the reality of a\nlot of people's lives.\nAnd so, yeah, that had to\nhappen for me to be haunted,\nto be haunted, to pull out,\nto extract the guy that I am today.\nThat haunting is something\nthat's still there today,\nbecause no matter how much you improve,\nno matter how much you change who you are,\nit's not permanent.\nYou'll just wake up and say,\n\"Oh my God, man, you're David Goggins.\n\"You break records, you\ndo this, you do that.\"\nPeople want to know how are\nyou able to just be so hard?\nBecause I never turn\nthe fuckin' thing off,\nbecause once it turns off,\nI go right back to the\nDavid Goggins that is,\nand that's the guy that I'm\nconstantly fighting every day,\nand it's a choice.\nAnd that choice makes you\nmisunderstood, it makes you crazy.\nThat's why I hate fuckin' social media.\nIn 2013, people wanted\nme to write my book.\nI did it in 2018, took five years.\nAnd the reason why I didn't do it,\nI sat at a table and Jennifer was there.\nThis is before she started working for me,\nI started dating her, whatever,\nand all these people were\nthere and they're like,\n\"Man, you got to go on social media.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Fuck you, man.\"\nIt's poison, it's poison,\nbecause I knew what I\ndid to get where I am,\nand I'm going to have these people,\nthese normal everyday people, fat, lazy,\nexactly who I was, judging me,\n'cause I know it, 'cause I was once them.\nAll my hard work, all my dedication,\nI'm going to have some normal\ndude get his little brownies,\nlittle Ding Dong, Ho Ho, Twinky,\nsit there with this coffee\npicking me apart, \"Oh,\nhe must be unhappy.\"\nDo you know how hard it is\nto put these shoes on every damn morning\nand I'm going to have you pick me apart?\nSo yeah, there's so\nmuch that goes into this\nthat I was like, fuck this,\nI never wanted anything to do with it.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
