    "transcript": "There's a question I've been wanting\nto ask you since we started,\nand I thought about coming in here,\nand I've been thinking about\nin the weeks ahead of this,\nand I'm going to just come clean\nand say I don't exactly know\nhow to ask the question.\nJust ask it.\nSo,\nit's about relationships.\nOh, do it, man.\nSo I know in myself\nthat my discipline is much\nhigher when it's just me,\nbut that's because I had\ncertain things early on.\nBut then I was a terrible student,\nbarely finished high school.\nBut then when I got\nserious, I got serious,\nbut I did that by staying\naway from everybody.\nAnd anyone who's ever had\na relationship of any kind,\nbut in particular romantic\nrelationships, knows\nthat, yes, you can derive\ntremendous support from those.\nLike, \"You got this, baby. You can go.\"\nAnd you're like, \"Yeah, I got this.\nShe said I got this,\" you know?\nRight, right.\nFeels great to finish something\nand share with someone,\nshare a meal, you know, get the hug.\nBut there's another side to all of that-\nRight.\nThat I'd like to learn\nmore about from you,\nwhich is there's a warm body next to you\nin bed in the morning.\nYou don't want to get up.\nThey also have needs.\nYou've got your mission\nthat people sometimes need things from us,\nbut also oftentimes the\npeople that love us most,\nthat truly love us and\nthat want to support us,\ndon't understand this thing.\nAnd they're the first\npeople to tell us like,\n\"Listen, take a day off.\"\nAnd then this whole cycle,\nat least in my head, goes off like,\nyou just want a vacation,\nand then it's almost like a paranoia.\nI'm not saying anything\nnice about myself right now.\nRight, all good, man.\nFormer girlfriends are\ngoing to be like, \"Yeah,\"\nlike, you know, they remember.\nAnd so support of people\nclose to you is critical.\nThis could be friends, could\nbe romantic partners, whatever.\nBut they're also, the\nknife cuts both ways.\nYep.\nIt can be the thing\nthat can really undermine this thing\nthat you're talking about\nbecause the people that care about us\nalso want to see us comfortable.\nRight.\nThey want to see us happy.\nThey want to see us peaceful.\nThey want to see us wake up\nfrom a great night's sleep,\nand they want things too.\nRight.\nSo how do you untangle that whole bit?\nWell, it's funny, man, I'm unbalanced,\nbut I'm mostly unbalanced\ntowards the family side.\nPeople don't get about me.\nI start being unbalanced.\nI get all my stuff in.\nBut what I do is I make sure\nthat my family has everything they need,\neverything they need,\nthose who want to be part of my family.\nSome don't.\nSome family members don't want\nto be part of David Goggins.\nI get it, I got it.\nThat's life.\nThose who are part of my family,\nI give them everything they need\nso they can leave me the fuck alone.\nI make sure you're happy as\nfuck 'cause I got to go to work,\nand I don't mean smoke jumping.\nI don't mean running.\nI mean all of it.\nIt takes every...\nI can't have you in my\nfucking shit, can't.\nSo I know for me to have a family,\nI got to make sure\nthat you realize I'm going to\ngive you everything you need\nso when you start bitching at me,\nI'm going to say, \"Look, hang on.\nI dedicated my life to give\nyou everything you need.\nI need this time right here\nfor me to be the best I can be\nbecause this journey\nstarted without anybody.\"\nAnd I make sure everybody knows\nthat who comes in my life.\nI've been left...\nThink about it.\nI was left alone at a young\nage to figure this shit out.\nI figured it out for myself\nand have been very successful for myself.\nNo one's going to come in\nhere and fuck with my shit.\nThat's why I make sure I will take care\nof whatever you need.\nWhatever you need from me, you got it,\nmoney, house, my love, my support.\nI'm going to give you everything you need.\nThat said, I do it the\nhighest level possible,\nand I'm saying it with\nJennifer in the next room.\nSo please come here\nand say something if it's wrong, Jennifer.\nI don't give a fuck.\nSay what you got to say.\nSo then when it's time\nfor me to go to work,\nI expect you to do the same for me\n'cause it takes every bit of\nme to do what I have to do.\nSo I make sure that I'm very\nunbalanced for my family\nso I can be exactly that\nunbalanced for myself.\nAnd that's how I do it.\nI let people know right up front\nI'm not what you want in a man.\nI guarantee that.\nThere's going to be a lot of late nights,\na lot of early mornings, a\nlot of times where I got to be\nby myself thinking about the process\nthat is next in my mind.\nI can't have aggravation.\nI can have this, can't have that.\nThere's a lot of things,\nbut I let 'em know upfront.\nI'm very vocal about that.\nSometimes relationships work for me.\nSometimes they didn't.\nBut that's who I am.\nOne thing I did wrong\nin my life was I tried\nfor so many years to please people,\nand I did it at the expense of myself.\nI was leaving a lot in the tank.\nAnd when you do that, you stop living.\nBut the person in your\nlife is happy as fuck\n'cause you're giving 'em\neverything they want.\nTheir life is full, but you feel empty,\nand that's not a relationship to me.\nSo for me, it's important\nthat you know exactly who I am\nbecause this is what life made.\nAnd I'm not trying to change it\nbecause I just figured it out.\nSo I'm not trying to\ncompromise David Goggins.\nI will never, ever\ncompromise David Goggins.\nThat doesn't mean I won't\ngive you what you need\nand what you want and what you desire.\nBut I don't need money.\nI don't need fame.\nI don't need shit.\nSo I give it all away.\nWhat I do need is to make sure\nthat that willpower is\nworked on every fucking day\nand every night for the rest of my life\n'cause that's the one thing\nthat's going to keep me feeding you,\nkeeping you where you need to be\n'cause once that willpower's\ngone, 300-pound David Goggins,\nhe may not look like it, but\nI will walk around with it.\nSo the things that are\nimportant to you in life,\nyou must do always, or you're nobody.\nAnd that's how I handle relationships.\nAmen to that.\nSomething I could personally work on\nis that upfront, clear communication\n'cause it resonates, that feeling\nof like there's something inside\nthat's not getting worked out\nthat when I'm on my\nown, it's a lot easier.\nBut then of course wanting\nrelationships and family,\nI think that's a healthy part\nof being human too.\nVery.\nAnd obviously you've worked it out.\nSo I appreciate you sharing that.\nI don't think I've ever heard you talk\nabout it that way before.\nPeople are scared of that conversation\nwith their wife, husband,\ngirlfriend, boyfriend.\nBut why are you scared of it?\nWhy are you scared to tell a motherfucker,\nyour wife, your husband, who you are,\nwho you are, exactly who you are?\nAnd that was a problem I had.\nThat's a problem that a\nlot of us have in life.\nNo one knows who you really are.\nNo one knew who I really was.\nI went to a school where there\nwere a lot of Black kids.\nA lot of Black kids didn't\nwant to be in special ops.\nI never talked about\nspecial ops to Black kids.\nWhy?\nI was wondering what...\nYou know, I'm not going to fit in\nbecause that's not what they do.\nA lot of Black kids don't\ndo that kind of shit.\nSo whatever I wanted to do,\nno one really knew the real me growing up\nbecause I never wanted\nanybody to know the real me.\nI was always afraid of what you might say\nor how you're going to feel or whatever.\nYou got feelings.\nYou have a life that you have to live.\nSo it's important that\nwhatever's on your mind,\nyou let that person know.\nTherefore you're giving them the option\nto be with you or not.\nThis is who I am.\nIf you don't like it, that's good, man.\nI got it.\nBut this is David Goggins.\nSo that honest conversation\nis very important, man,\nso everybody knows where they stand.\nThat person may not be for\nyou, and that's all good.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
