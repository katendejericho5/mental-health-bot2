    "transcript": "I'm going to share a\nlittle neuroscience tidbit.\nLove it.\nBut I think it's one\nthat you'll appreciate.\nMost people don't know this,\nbut there's a brain structure\ncalled the anterior midcingulate cortex,\nas we pointed out before,\nthat's a noun, it's a name,\nit doesn't mean anything.\nRight.\nWe could call it\nthe cookie monster.\nRight.\nBut what's interesting\nabout this brain area\nis there's now a lot of data,\nin humans, not some mouse study,\nshowing that when people do\nsomething they don't want to do,\nlike add three hours of\nexercise per day or per week,\nor when people who are trying\nto diet and lose weight\nresist eating something.\nRight.\nWhen people do anything that they,\nand this is the important part,\nthat they don't want to do,\nit's not about adding more work,\nit's about adding more work\nthat you don't want to do.\nYes.\nThis brain area gets bigger.\nYep.\nNow here's what's especially interesting\nabout this brain area\nto me, and by the way,\nI'm only learning this recently\nbecause it's new data,\nbut there's a lot of it.\nThe anterior midcingulate cortex\nis smaller in obese people,\nit gets bigger when they diet.\nIt's larger in athletes,\nit's especially large or grows larger\nin people that see themselves\nas challenged and overcome some challenge.\nRight.\nAnd in people that live a very long time,\nthis area keeps its size.\nIn many ways, scientists\nare starting to think\nof the anterior midcingulate cortex\nnot just as one of the seats of willpower.\nRight.\nBut perhaps actually the\nseat of the will to live.\nSee, now we're talking.\nAnd when I learned about the\nanterior midcingulate cortex,\nI was like almost out of my seat.\nAnd I've been in the\nneuroscience game since I was 20.\nNow we're talking.\nAnd we're the same age.\nAnd I was so pumped\n'cause I've heard of the\namygdala fear, prefrontal cortex,\nit's planning and action.\nI could tell you every\nbrain area and every,\nI teach neuroanatomy to medical students.\nBut when I started seeing the data\non the anterior midcingulate cortex,\nI was like, whoa, this is interesting.\nYep.\nAnd all the data points to the fact\nthat we can build this area up.\nYep.\nBut that, as quickly as we build it up,\nif we don't continue to invest in things\nthat are hard for us\nthat we don't want to do,\nthat's the part that\nfeels so Goggin-esque.\nYes, sir.\nTo me,\nthat we don't want to do,\nlike if you love the ice bath,\n\"Yeah, I love the ice bath,\"\nand you go from one minute\nto 10 minutes, guess what?\nYour anterior midcingulate\ncortex did not grow.\nNone.\nBut if you hate the cold water,\nif you're afraid of drowning\nand you get into water\nand put your head under.\nYep.\nThen your anterior mid, and survive,\nthen the anterior midcingulate\ncortex gets bigger.\nBut if you don't do it the next day,\nor if you do it the next\nday and you enjoy it\nbecause, hey, hey, I did it yesterday,\nwoo-hoo, happy me, Merry Christmas,\nas you would say.\nThat's right,\nMerry Christmas.\nGuess what?\nThe anterior midcingulate\ncortex shrinks again.\nDAVID: Yep.\nTo me, this is one of the\nmost important discoveries\nthat neuroscience has ever made\nbecause it's that I don't\nwant to do something\nbut do it anyway.\nThat's right.\nThat grows this area,\nand it's almost like I have a friend,\nhe's been sober 30 years from alcohol,\nand he always says, you know,\nthe amazing thing about\naddiction is there's a cure,\nthe problem is it only\nworks one day at a time.\nYep.\nAnd so, you have to renew it every day.\nThat's right.\nSo the anterior midcingulate cortex to me,\nwhen I learned about it, two\nthings went off in my head,\nwhoa, this is super interesting,\nand two, I got to tell\nDavid Goggins about this.\nAnd I waited until now.\nI'm glad.\nTo tell you\nbecause I felt like,\nwell, for obvious reasons,\nI wanted to tell you and\nI wanted to tell you here.\nWell, I love that\nbecause that's how I've\nlived my entire life,\nI didn't know anything about that.\nBut people go, \"Man, you\nhave such a strong will.\"\nIt's something that you\nbuild, like I never forgot,\nI was on a podcast one\ntime, and this dude goes,\n\"You were blessed with a strong mind.\"\nLike, the hell you talking about\nI was blessed with a strong mind?\nThat's something that you have to develop.\nYou develop that over\nyears, decades of suffering\nand going back into the suffer.\nThat's why a lot of people who\ngraduate Navy SEAL training,\nI talk about very openly all the time,\na lot of guys don't want\nto go back into that water,\ndon't want to go back into the hard stuff.\nAnything hard, anything hard in life,\nonce you get through it,\nit's like you become a POW.\nLike, how many POWs you know\nwant to go back to POW camp?\nNone.\nWhen something sucks so bad\nin life, this is on this,\nthat we're talking about now,\nvery few people want to go back.\nThey're happy they graduated.\nI realized I'm the same way,\nI don't want to go back.\nI have to go back, I must go back.\nBecause that is exactly where\nall the knowledge of my\nlife exists was back there\nand what exactly what\nyou're talking about.\nWell, I didn't know anything about this,\nbut how I grew a will was\nconstantly doing these things,\nso now, it's just life.\nI wake up, while it still\nsucks, it's just life.\nYou don't sit back and like, oh my God,\nlike I have days I don't want to do it,\nbut I know I'm going to do it.\nI know from years of just\ndoing it, so that's beautiful.\nAnd this is why I came\non here with you today,\nand I'm glad that you're\ntalking about this\nbecause human beings need to hear this,\nthey need to stop hearing\nthese hacks on this and that,\nthere's no fucking hack, bro,\nthere's no fucking hack,\nyeah, you may this and\nthat and saunas and this,\nall this shit that they, yeah, it's great.\nThere is no fucking life hack.\nTo grow that thing, how do you grow it?\nDo it, and do it, and do it and do it.\nThat's the hack, the hack\nis going to fucking suck.\nAnd that's when I realized,\nthat's when I realized.\nThat's why I wanted to come on here today,\nI didn't want to come on here\nand talk about no fucking\npassion and purpose\nand how to get the fuck out of bed\nand how to hit a fucking alarm clock\nand all this catchphrase bullshit,\n'cause that wasn't how I\nlived, it wasn't how I lived.\nI lived, I woke up like\nevery human being does\nand goes, \"Fuck, man, I'm a\nfucking piece of shit today.\nHow the hell is this\ngoing to work out for me?\"\nAnd you fight that and you fight that,\nyou don't override it,\nthere's no override button.\nIt's the conversation in your head.\nSo how do you do that?\nWe don't have enough\nof these conversations\nabout the real conversation\nthat every human being is having\nand they have no idea how to\nget out of it, but they do.\nIt's that shit right there,\nman, you got to build your will.\nHow do you build your will?\nExactly what you said, man.\nExactly what you said.\nWell, I feel like knowing\nthe name of something,\nanterior midcingulate cortex\ndoesn't fundamentally change us.\nBut one thing I like about\nbiology is that, willpower,\nif somebody feels they don't have it,\nfeels like this thing\nthat other people have.\nBut everybody, unless\nthey're brain damaged,\nlike a hole through their head\nhas two anterior midcingulate cortex,\none on each side of their brain.\nEveryone has one, they have two.\nSo I feel like it's just a\nquestion of opening the portal,\nand the portal, again, I'm\ngoing to say it 10 times\nand forgive me, is I think people go,\n\"Oh, I do hard things,\nI do sets to failure,\nand then I do forced reps.\"\nI love training with weights,\nI love doing sets to failure,\nI even like forced reps, but guess what?\nI like forced reps, so I'll tell you,\nthey don't build my anterior\nmidcingulate cortex.\nRight.\nBecause I like to do it.\nThat's right.\nAnything you like to do\nis not going to enhance\nthis aspect of willpower.\nAnd it seems so obvious once you hear it,\nyou kind of go, \"Oh yeah, of course.\"\nBut I think you really\nclose that loop for people\nwhen you share what you're sharing today\nand what you've shared\nelsewhere before as well,\nwhen you're trying to explain\nthe friction is the critical ingredient.\nRight.\nAnd I think people think,\noh, if it's effort, well,\nthen, I'm getting better,\nthat's part of it, necessary,\nbut not sufficient,\nas we say in science.\nBut the suck part, the\nbeing haunted, the stick,\nthey're really unpleasant terms.\nVery.\nThese are probably the\nmost unpleasant terms\nwe've ever used on this podcast.\nVery.\nThose are the levers, those are the gears.\nAnd without those, this thing\nthat you're talking about,\nDavid Goggins as a verb.\nRight.\nYou know, I sometimes make\nthe joke, but it's not a joke.\nDAVID: Right.\nGoggins is a name and it's a verb.\nPeople go, \"I'm going to Goggins that.\"\nRight.\nRight?\nBut that's, I think, again,\nI'm not a psychologist,\nbut I think that's what\nyou're talking about.\nThe stick, the friction, being haunted,\nit's the suck part that grows\nthis anterior midcingulate cortex.\nSo now you know why there's so many people\nthat fail in this world to\nfigure out their purpose,\ntheir purpose in life, where do I go?\nBecause to grow that,\nwhile you may not look like\nme, how my daily life looks.\nIt don't look fun,\nit don't look fun.\nSo it's a choice that\npeople have to make in life.\nBut what's so funny about it\nis even the richest of rich,\nwho have everything, they\nalways ask me this question,\n\"I feel like I'm missing something.\"\nI don't feel like I'm missing shit.\nI don't have what you all have,\nbut you'll never in my life\nhear me tell you I'm missing something.\nAnd everybody is, they're\nmissing this feeling.\nI found it, a long time ago,\nand I found it right there\nin that willpower thing.\nWhen you're nothing, nothing,\nand change yourself\ninto something like me,\nyou call it happiness, peace,\nwhatever the fuck you want to call it,\npeople are missing exactly what\nwent on with David Goggins.\n\"Why don't you smile?\"\nI do, I do.\nBut I figured something out,\nthat's why you'll never hear me say,\n\"I'm missing something.\"\nI found it years ago.\nYou find it in the suck,\nyou find it in the suck,\nand you find it repeatedly in the suck,\nto the point where you\nknow exactly who you are.\nMost people are missing something\nbecause they don't know who they are,\nthey never examine themselves,\nthey've never done this\nexperiment on themselves.\nThe lab rat, we're all lab rats.\nBut you are also the scientist.\nYou create your own self.\nMost people are missing something\n'cause there's so much trapped in there.\nI don't even want to say potential,\nI think that word's used out too much too.\nThere's so much in you that God\nor whoever the hell you believe\nin, or if you're a atheist,\nin you, that you have not unlocked,\nthat you walk around\nwith this gorgeous wife\nor great husband and all\nthis money, you're like,\n\"God, I feel like I'm missing something.\"\nYeah, because it's about 75% of you\nis still fucking in\nthere, still chained up,\nbecause you just didn't\nwant to find your willpower,\ndidn't want to find your\nsoul, your will, your heart,\nyour determination,\nyour guts, your courage,\nand what that looks like, it looks scary,\nlike your little scary\nlab I went in, scary.\nTo wake up every day and say,\n\"I'm stupid, but I want to\nfigure out a way to be smarter,\"\nversus saying, \"Man,\nI just can't do that.\"\nSo you limit this box,\nso your box becomes so\nsmall of things you can do.\nMy box wasn't even a box,\nit was a fucking little\nlike little pinhole.\nAnd then, through examining myself,\ngetting some willpower, some courage,\nit became bigger than this table.\nBut that's what we all do,\nthat's why I wanted to come here today\nand talk to you about real shit.\nNot no fucking like hacks,\nthere's no hacks, bro.\nIt's you against you, you against you.\nAnd if you misunderstand that,\nyou have a real problem, real problem.\nI can understand you misunderstand me\nrunning down the street, shirt off,\n\"Fuck this, yeah, yeah,\"\nI can get it, I get it.\nIf you misunderstand\nwhat I'm saying right now\ntoday, the problem is you,\nand you don't want to fix it.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
