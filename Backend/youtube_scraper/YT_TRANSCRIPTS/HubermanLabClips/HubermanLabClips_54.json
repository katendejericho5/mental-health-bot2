    "transcript": "What can we say about the\nenvironmental conditions\nin which kids are seeing\nfrom the time they're born\nthrough let's say adolescents\nin their teen years\nin terms of how their\nvisual system wires up,\nand are there any recommendations\nthat are coming from the\nscientific literature,\nclinical studies,\nclinical trials, excuse me, or otherwise\nthat indicate what a healthy\nvisual environment consists of?\nYeah, yeah.\nThat's a great question and actually,\nit's really relevant these days,\nbecause, you know, myopia is so common.\nIt's more common\nin Asian populations.\nYou know, it's called\nan epidemic in China.\nIn California, we have\na lot of Asian heritage\nor Asian Americans,\nand so we see a lot.\nLike, at Stanford, we see a lot of,\nyou know, myopia in kids and adults,\nand really starting to get thoughtful\non the science of myopia control.\nHow do we provide the right environments?\nNow what's interesting\nis that for decades,\nthe assumption, some of the data\nreally led us to the\npath of thinking like,\n\"Gosh, the more you spend\nat near activities,\"\nand these are mouse model\nexperiments like you described,\nbut also well-designed\nhuman cohort studies,\nyou know, figuring out,\nlike, asking, you know, kids and families,\nlike, \"How long is your kid reading\nor in front of the computer?\nHow myopic are they? How\nnearsighted are they?\"\nVersus, \"How much time is your\nkid in front of the computer\ndoing near work?\nHow myopic or nearsighted are they?\"\nAnd these well-designed cohort studies\ndid point towards this concept\nthat if you do too much near work as a kid\nthat you're more likely\nto develop nearsightedness\nas you get through\nthose sort of, you know,\npreteen and even into the teen years,\nwhich is when most of\nthat myopia progression\nor eyeball elongation\nis actually happening\nto cause nearsightedness.\nIt's only been in the last few years\nthat some really exciting studies\nhave actually pointed in a\nslightly different direction,\nand that's that maybe it's not all,\nnot to say it's not about near activity,\nbut maybe it's not all\nabout near activity.\nMaybe it's actually a little more\nabout the kind of light\nwe're getting into our eyes,\nand I think you've\ntalked about this before,\nand it's really important.\nWhen they've now studied\nand asked the kids\ninstead of just how much near\nand how much far are you doing,\nhow much time are you spending\nindoors in indoor lighting,\nwhich doesn't have full-spectrum light\nin a typical indoor environment,\nversus how much time are\nyou spending outdoors\nplaying in the yard?\nYou could be reading outside,\nbut what kind of time\nare you spending outside?\nAnd of course, when\nyou're outside in sunlight\neven it's in direct sunlight,\nyou're getting a different spectrum\nof kind of full-spectrum\nlighting from the sun,\nand it looks like it's\npretty clear now actually\nthat it has maybe more to do\nwith outdoor lighting time\nthan just near work,\nand so I think that, you know,\nwe've actually already seen\nthe first couple randomized\ncontrolled trials\nwhere they're having kids\nintentionally spending time outdoors\nversus sort of standard life,\nwhich, you know, is going to\nbe often much more indoor time,\nand seeing some effects.\nYou follow those kids\nover a couple of years\nand the kids who spend time outdoors\nare progressing in their\nnearsightedness less.\nLike, their nearsighted prescription\nis not getting as strong\nas the kids who are\nspending more time indoors.\nAnd there's some pretty good biology\nthat's getting worked out,\ngoing back to animal models more\nabout how that might be working\nin the retina inside the eye.\nBut it's pretty compelling concept,\nand so, you know, as a parent,\nyou may want to be telling your kid like,\n\"Okay, yeah, I want\nyou to read that book,\"\nor, you know, if your\nkid's playing on the phone\nor something like that,\nor the iPad or something like that,\nthey're allowed that time.\n\"Okay, you can have that time,\nbut I want you to spend some of the time\nthat you're doing that outdoors.\"\nAre there any thresholds\nfor the amount of time\nthat one would suggest\ntheir child be outdoors\nto get that full-spectrum light?\nIt's a great question.\nYou know, we talk about cohort studies\nwhere we just ask people\nwhat are they doing,\nand there seems to be, you know,\na little bit of what we would call\na dose-dependent response.\nMaybe the more time\noutdoors might be better.\nWe don't know if there's an upper limit.\nLike, gosh, if you go\nover two or three hours,\nthere's no additional benefit.\nTalk about that in cohort studies.\nThe real gold standard\nfor answering these kinds of questions\nare randomized controlled trials,\nand specifically placebo controlled,\nor a control group that's\nnot getting the intervention.\nThat's our highest level of\nevidence for clinical evidence,\nfor any of this kind of science,\nwhen we're talking about humans\nor preclinical models in the laboratory.\nAnd the study that hasn't been done yet\nto really answer that\nquestion is to randomize kids,\nto telling this group of kids,\n\"You just do your normal life,\"\ntell this group of kids, \"We\nwant you outside an hour,\"\nthis group of kids, \"We want\nyou outside two hours a day,\"\nthis group of kids, \"Three hours a day,\"\nand see between the groups\nis there a big difference?\nLike, we have pretty good evidence now\nfrom the studies that have been done\nthat the difference between\nzero and one or two hours\nis clearly there.\nIs five minutes enough?\nis five hours better?\nI don't think we know the\nanswers to those questions yet,\nlike, what's the right dose,\nbut there's probably at least\nsome dose dependence to that.\nAnd I can imagine it's a little bit hard\nto tease apart the near-far\nviewing from the indoor-outdoor,\nbecause yes,\nof course a child could be\noutside on an iPad up close,\nbut it's hard to imagine\nthat at some point\nthey aren't seeing off into the distance,\nfar viewing as it's called,\nand the reverse is also true.\nIf you're indoors,\nunless you live in a very, very large home\nor you're staring off a balcony,\nfar viewing is much harder to achieve.\nYeah, yeah.\nSo, it's,\nand perhaps it isn't important\nto isolate these variables,\nalthough I can see the challenge\nin developing a really\ngood clinical trial,\nrandomized clinical trial for this.\nMeanwhile, you know, I'm,\nI'll go into the grave shouting, you know,\nor saying rather and suggesting\nthat people get some morning\nsunlight in their eyes\nto set their circadian rhythm,\nbut far viewing at least a few minutes\nand ideally hours per day,\nor a mixture of near and far\nviewing by being outdoors\njust seems like a good thing\nto do regardless of age.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
