    "transcript": "What are the major forms\nof vision loss in childhood\nand in adulthood,\nand what can each and all of us do\nin order to find out if we\nhave one of these conditions\nand therefore treat it effectively?\nYeah, that's great.\nYou know, let's start by\njust reminding ourselves\nwhat are the major causes of vision loss?\nAnd these are going to differ\nwhere you are in the world,\nbut the number one cause of low vision\nis actually refractive error.\nPeople who need glasses,\nand especially in other\ncountries, affordability, access,\ncan't even get glasses, okay?\nSo that's just refractive error,\nbut that's fundamentally correctable.\nThe next most common cause\nof vision loss is cataract.\nCataract is the blurring,\nthe aging of the lens inside\nthe eye, behind the cornea.\nWe talked about how that is responsible\nfor focusing light on the back of the eye.\nIt also has to be clear enough\nthat the light gets through the lens.\nAnd a cataract is a normal aging process.\nYou know, as I said, if\nwe all live to a hundred\nor 110 years old, we'll all get cataracts.\nWe'll all need cataract surgery.\nWe actually, in the eye clinic,\nwe see cataracts years or even decades\nbefore they're affecting your\nvision in a meaningful way.\nSo the cataracts are\nforming and that's okay,\nbut at some point they get bad enough\nthat it's time to take them out.\nWe've actually solved\nfor cataract surgery pretty efficiently.\nWe can do a four to eight minute surgery,\nmaybe if we're taking our time,\nit's 10 or 12 minutes of surgical time.\nTake out a cataract,\nit works beautifully 99 point\nsomething percent of the time.\nWe put a plastic,\na clear plastic lens inside the eye,\nexactly where your lens used to be.\nAnd there's even lenses that can flex\nor focus light from far and near.\nSo cataract is fundamentally a,\nthere's still room for improvement,\nbut it's fundamentally a solved problem.\nThe problem is that worldwide,\nthere aren't enough cataract surgeons,\nthere's not access to care,\nthe machinery or the lenses\ncosts too much money\nin developing countries\nto get out to the number of\npeople who would need them.\nSo it's actually just,\nagain, an access to care.\nCataract is a reversible, treatable,\neasily treatable problem,\nbut it's number two on the list of causes\nof vision loss in the world\nbecause we don't have\nenough access to care,\nwe need a lot more sort of programming\naround global ophthalmology,\nglobal eye care to solve for cataract,\njust to bring that solution\nto countries around the world.\nThen after that, you start\nhitting the eye diseases\nthat lead to what are\ncurrently irreversible,\nnon-reversible causes of vision loss.\nThe number one cause of\nirreversible vision loss\nin the world is glaucoma.\nSo what is glaucoma?\nGlaucoma's actually\nprobably a little cluster\nor constellation of diseases\nthat we lump together.\nIt's a degenerative disease\nlike a neurodegeneration.\nWe talk about\nneurodegenerations in the brain\nlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\nGlaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease.\nInstead of affecting one or\ndifferent area in your brain,\nit happens to affect the optic nerve\nthat connects the eye to the brain.\nAnd we need our optic nerves\nto carry all the visual information\nfrom the eye to the brain.\nAnd so if your optic nerve\nis degenerating in glaucoma,\nand I should add, there are\nother optic neuropathies,\nso-called diseases of\noptic nerve degeneration.\nFor example, you can get a\nstroke of the optic nerve.\nYou can have an inflammatory disease\nlike multiple sclerosis,\ncalled optic neuritis that\naffects the optic nerve.\nSo you can get other optic nerve diseases.\nBut glaucoma is by far the\nmost common optic neuropathy.\nAnd the problem is, just\nlike spinal cord injury,\nwhich is also part of the\ncentral nervous system, right?\nThe brain, the spinal cord,\nthe retina, the optic nerve,\nthat's the central nervous system,\nand there's no regeneration.\nAnd that's why spinal cord injury leads\nto permanent paralysis.\nWell, optic nerve injury\nor optic nerve degeneration\nunfortunately leads\nto permanent vision loss.\nSo in the case of glaucoma,\nhow do we get ahead of that?\nGlaucoma has two major risk factors.\nOne is increasing age.\nThere are actually infantile\nand pediatric glaucomas unfortunately,\nand those can be much more aggressive,\nmuch more damaging when they\npresent so early in kids,\nin babies, and in children.\nMost of the kind of run of the\nmill glaucoma usually presents\nin adulthood and even in the aging adults.\nSo much more common after 50 or 60\nor 70 years old, increasing.\nThe other main risk factor for glaucoma\nis increasing eye pressure.\nThe eye actually, you\nknow, it stays inflated.\nIt's a balloon. It has to stay inflated.\nWe need some amount of eye\npressure to keep our eye\nas an inflated balloon.\nBut if the eye pressure goes too high,\nand we talked about this before,\nyou won't even feel it if\nit slowly gets too high.\nIf the eye pressure goes too\nhigh, that causes glaucoma.\nAnd that's one of the\nthings that we talked about,\nyou really include in a\ncomprehensive eye exam.\nWhen you're just getting\na screening checkup\nat your eye care provider,\nat your optometrist or\nophthalmologist office,\nthey're going to check your pressure,\nand just as a screening tool,\ncheck to make sure it's not too high.\nWe can treat glaucoma today\nby trying to reduce the\nimpact of that high pressure\nby lowering the eye pressure.\nSo we have treatments for glaucoma\nthat target the eye pressure.\nWe have medications like eye drops,\nwe have lasers that can\nbe used inside the eye\nthat can also lower the eye pressure.\nAnd ultimately, if we need them,\nwe also have surgeries that\ncan also provide an outflow\nthat lets the fluid out of\nthe eye in a controlled way\nso that the eye pressure\ncan be brought back down\ninto normal ranges.\nAgain, the reason that\nglaucoma ends up being\nthe number one cause of\nirreversible blindness in the world\nis number one,\nwe can't get those therapies\neverywhere in the world,\nthe affordability of eyedrops,\nthe access to lasers,\nor surgical procedures\naround the world isn't equal\nto what it is here.\nAnd even within our country,\npeople may not be accessing\nhealthcare effectively\nto get screened for glaucoma\nor to get treated for glaucoma.\nThe other big problem with glaucoma\nis that it affects our\nperipheral vision first,\nand only very late in the\ndisease does it pinch in\nand finally pinch off\nthe center of our vision\nin typical glaucomas.\nAnd that's a real problem\nbecause we don't notice\nif our peripheral vision is down.\nYou know, our peripheral\nvision isn't that good\nto begin with.\nAnd if you're driving and you\ncan see a pedestrian step off\nthe sidewalk, you think your\nperipheral vision is fine,\nbut actually your peripheral vision\ncould already start\nbeing damaged by glaucoma\nand you won't notice it\nin regular daily life.\nAnd that's where the\nimportance of screening\nand early detection really\ncomes in for glaucoma.\nWhat we don't have for glaucoma,\nwe can come back to like kind\nof what's the cutting edge\nof the future in these eye diseases?\nWhat we don't have are\ntreatments that really target\nthe optic nerve degenerative process\nand we can come back and talk about that.\nSo that's glaucoma and optic neuropathies.\nThen the next two major causes\nof currently largely\nirreversible vision loss\nare age-related macular degeneration\nand diabetic retinopathy.\nNow age-related macular\ndegeneration is just like it sounds,\nmajor risk factor is\nage, it's very common.\nAnd actually, in the\ndeveloped world, you know,\ncountries that are more developed,\nalso countries that\nhave a larger Caucasian,\nWhite population,\nit's more common in certain\npopulations than in others.\nIt actually is definitely a\nleading cause of vision loss\nin the elderly population, for example,\nin the United States.\nAnd there's two forms\nof macular degeneration,\nbut they both end up targeting\nthe same part of the retina.\nAnd that part of the retina\nis really like the rods\nand the cones that we talked about before.\nThe rods do your low\nlight vision at nighttime.\nPrimarily, your cones do\ncolor vision and bright light,\nyou know, sort of normal\nlighting that we experience\nthrough most of our awake day.\nAnd in that back of the retina,\nyou can have what's called\ndry macular degeneration,\nwhich is a slow, thankfully slow,\nbut slow insidious disease\nthat causes the degeneration\nof the rods and cones\nand also the support cells that\nhelp feed the rods and cones\nand take care of the rods and cones.\nThey're called RPE cells,\nretinal pigment epithelium.\nIt's not really critical, of course,\nthe names of every different cell type,\nbut these are like the\nlight collecting cells\nin our eyes and the retina\nand they degenerate in\nmacular degeneration.\nAnd in the dry form, there's\nthis slow degeneration,\nbut some percent of\npeople with the dry form\nof macular degeneration\nwill actually convert\nto what's called the wet form.\nIt's called wet because new blood vessels\nactually grow inappropriately\nunder and even into the retina\nand new blood vessels, unlike\nour mature blood vessels,\ntend to be leaky.\nAnd so the fluid leaks out\nof those blood vessels,\ngets into the retina,\ninterferes with vision,\nand that can lead to a much\nmore acute loss of vision.\nNow, we have some treatments\nfor wet macular degeneration.\nWe have injections that\ncan go into the eye\nthat actually fight against the molecules\nthat are causing those\nnew blood vessels to grow.\nAnd these are antibodies that\ncan be injected into the eye\nand they can be very effective\ncontrolling patients'\nwet macular degeneration.\nIt's been a much bigger uphill battle,\neven over the last decade\nas advances are being made,\nto really try to knock back\nor slow down even the dry\nform of macular degeneration.\nThere was just some\nexciting news even just\nin the last few months.\nThe first successful trials of a treatment\nfor the dry form have just shown success\nin properly randomized\ncontrolled human clinical trials,\nphase three clinical trials.\nSo it's an exciting time.\nThose new treatments are\nnot going to be a panacea.\nThey slow the progression,\nlike the anatomic progression\nof the disease maybe by 20 or 25%.\nSo patients are still\ngoing to get worse even\nwith those treatments.\nSo there's still a lot more to be done\nto really knock back macular degeneration.\nI want to mention, you\nmentioned retinitis pigmentosa.\nThat's like an inherited form\nof a type of macular degeneration.\nIt's also affecting the rods and cones\nand also the support cells,\nthe RPE cells in the back of the eye.\nretinitis pigmentosa is an inherited form.\nThere are actually many\ndifferent genes you could have\nthat could leave to retinitis pigmentosa.\nIn aggregate, if you add up all the people\nwith all those different genes,\nand it can be very devastating\n'cause it can really affect the vision,\nknock out your vision very early in life,\nincluding in children and even\nversions of that in babies.\nBut you add that all up,\nit's still much less common in aggregate\nthan macular degeneration.\nBut in a way, it's quite a bit more severe\nbecause it does affect\npeople much earlier in life.\nSo I sort of clump those to together,\nmacular degeneration,\nretinitis pigmentosa,\ndegeneration of the rods and cones\nand the support cells,\nthe RPE support cells.\nAnd then you can't have\nthis part of the discussion\nabout what are the\ndevastating eye diseases\nwithout bringing up diabetic retinopathy,\nespecially because diabetes\nunfortunately really continues\nto grow in, especially let's\nsay in the United States,\ncertainly in the developed\nworld, you know, as we,\nespecially Type 2 diabetes\nwith eating habits,\nexercise habits contributing\nto a proliferation of some\nof the risk factors for Type 2 diabetes,\nmetabolic syndrome, obesity.\nWe're unfortunately\nseeing a proliferation,\na growth in the number\nof people with diabetes.\nAnd with the growth in diabetes\nunfortunately comes a growth\nof the complications of diabetes.\nAnd one of the major\ncomplications of diabetes\nis damage to the retina inside the eye,\nand we call that diabetic retinopathy.\nAnd there, again, some of\nthe same damage that occurs,\nespecially when in diabetes, again,\nsome new blood vessels are growing\nor blood vessels are leaky.\nSome of that can be treated with,\nit used to be lasers\nand now more commonly\nis often being treated\nwith some of the same injectable drugs\nthat are treating macular degeneration.\nBut there's still a lot of\nvision loss with diabetes\nand diabetic retinopathy.\nI think that's an area where,\nagain, early screening,\nmaking sure if you have diabetes,\nthat's an indication\nwhere you definitely have to be going in\nand getting your at least annual exam\nwith an eye care provider\nor having someone take a photograph\nof the inside of your eye\nand rate that photograph\nto say if you have any\ndiabetic retinopathy or not.\n[MUSIC
