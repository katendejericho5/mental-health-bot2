    "transcript": "When we were out in the lobby\nyou mentioned that you\nhave a breathing exercise,\na coherence breathing exercise,\nthat you thought might be\nuseful for us to do now\nand perhaps for some of\nthe listeners to join in.\nYeah, let's do it.\nAnd then if you want to\ntalk about it after, we can.\nSounds good.\nThe reason I started doing this\nis I have relatively low\nheart rate variability\nand you want to have a higher one.\nSo I looked at all the things\nthat can raise your\nheart rate variability,\nand I started doing\nthis breathing technique\nspecifically for heart rate\nvariability, and it went up.\nAwesome.\nSo it's...\nGreat.\ntested.\nGreat.\nLet's do it together.\nHere, I'll play it.\nIt'll say, \"Take a deep breath,\"\nand then you'll hear the sound of a,\nif you follow me for the\nfirst inhale and exhale,\nyou'll know what sound means what.\nAnd you do this eyes closed, typically?\nI do it eyes closed.\nOkay, we'll close our eyes.\n[chime rings]\n[guide inhales]\n[Rick inhales]\n[guide exhales]\n[men exhale]\n[slow breathing]\n[chimes ring]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\n[slow breathing continues]\n[chimes ringing continues]\nThat was five minutes.\nI like that.\nFeels nice, doesn't it?\nYeah.\nI noticed I don't spontaneously\nbreathe at that cadence.\nI breathe quite a bit faster.\nMhm.\nSo especially on the exhale.\nMhm.\nSo once I got into a rhythm of it,\nyeah, the mind just goes\npseudo random for me.\nWhat about for you?\nDoes your mind tend to go one place?\nI do, now I count.\nSo the reason I knew it was five minutes\nis because it's six breaths per minute,\nand I counted 5, 1, 1, 1, 2,\n1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6, 2, 1.\nSo I was occupied with a task.\nHow often do you do that?\nAt least once and sometimes twice a day.\nI aim for 10 minutes a day,\nbut if I get to 20 minutes a day,\nit's noticeable in my heart\nrate variability results.\nDo you do the coherence breathing\nat a particular times of day,\nor just whenever it occurs to you?\nI think it depends on where I am\nand what else is going on in my life.\nSo it, there was, I had a window\nof a very specific thing that I was doing.\nI would do coherent breathing\nand I would do squats, just air squats.\nAnd in one location where I\ndidn't have any other equipment.\nAnd then I found a way, like,\nwhere I was doing treading water,\nwhich you got to experience with me.\nI would tread water,\nand then after treading water\nI would get out of the pool,\nsit in the sun and do\nthe coherent breathing.\n[Music Playing]"
