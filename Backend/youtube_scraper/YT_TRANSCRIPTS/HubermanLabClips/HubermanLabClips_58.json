    "transcript": "I'm wondering if you'd be willing to share\nwith us a little bit about\nyour mindset,\nmaybe even your motivation,\nbut certainly your mindset around sharing\nsome of the hard,\npersonal tribulations that you've shared.\nIn preparation for this discussion today,\nI went back to some of\nthose posts that you did\nand the podcasts that you did around this.\nAnd I'd listened to them at the time,\nand, you know, they deal with\nquite serious violations\nof childhood and of self.\nAnd they're hard.\nI mean, they're hard to listen to\nand I can only imagine they must be\neven far, far harder to experience.\nAnd I was curious, what led to\nyour willingness to do that?\nAnd\nyeah, I mean, I have my own ideas\nabout what might've motivated it,\nbut I'd like to hear it from you.\nSure.\nHappy to talk about it.\nAnd I think there are\ntwo particular examples\nthat come to mind.\nSo one is my\nnear suicide in college,\nand\nif people search \"Some\nPractical Thoughts on Suicide\"\nand my name, it'll pop right up.\nI mean, if you just search\nmy name and suicide, it'll\nprobably pop right up.\nPretty well indexed at this point,\nwhich is very deliberate.\nPeople can look at the URL structure\nfor a little wink and a hat tip.\n[Tim Ferriss laughs]\nIt'll tell you something\nabout optimizing for Google.\nIf you look at it,\nI'll just tell you,\nthe URL, it spells out\n\"how to commit suicide\".\nBut clearly I'm not teaching\npeople how to commit suicide,\nbut I wanted that to be a\nhoneypot for some of that traffic\nbecause it's a lot easier now to find\nthat type of practical\nimplementation advice.\nAnd it's a bit harder to find, I think,\ncompelling intervention.\nSo first of all, if\nyou're feeling suicidal,\nobviously call a suicide\nhotline, please, right?\nThat's sometimes the last\nthing that people want to hear\nwhen they are in a place\nof suicidal ideation.\nAnd the reason I ended up\nwriting a long post about this,\nwhich was terrifying to write\nbecause I had never\ntold my parents,\nI had never told my closest friends.\nThis was a secret.\nThis was a dark, dark secret.\nAnd\nI wrote about it because\nI went to an event in San Francisco.\nI was interviewed on\nstage by Jason Calacanis\nwho's a friend\nand a very good interviewer\nat an event.\nAnd after I got off stage,\na bunch of people approached\nme and I was saying hi\nand taking photos and\nsigning things and so on,\nand there was one young man\nthere, very well dressed,\nwhich isn't really relevant.\nI just, it was striking\n'cause in San Francisco sometimes people\nare very underdressed.\nAnd he was, he had dressed up for it,\nlike he'd taken it seriously.\nAnd he was in a suit and tie\nand he asked me if I could\nsign a book for his brother.\nAnd\nI said, \"Sure, no problem.\"\nAnd I asked him,\n\"What would you like me\nto write to your brother?\"\nAnd he kind of blanked.\nHe didn't kind of blank,\nhe totally blanked,\nbut the look behind his eyes was unusual.\nIt wasn't just, I don't\nknow what to say, blank.\nThere was something else behind it.\nAnd I could tell that\nhe felt under pressure.\nAnd I said, \"No problem, take your time.\nI'll tell you what, I'll just chat\nwith a couple of other people and I'm,\nI'll sign the book.\nNo problem, I'm not going anywhere.\"\nAnd chatted with the other folks\nand then he asked if he could\njust walk me to the elevator\nand then I could sign the book.\nI was like, \"Sure.\"\nAnd he explained to me as\nI walked to the elevator\nhow his brother had\nbeen a huge fan of mine\nand that\nI'd really kept his brother\nafloat for a long time.\nAnd eventually, his brother killed himself\nand that they'd kept his\nroom exactly how it was.\nAnd he wanted me to sign the book\nso that he could put the\nbook in his brother's room.\nAnd\nhe asked me if I'd ever considered\ntalking about mental health\nand mental health challenges publicly,\nbecause he thought it would\nreally help a lot of people.\nAnd that just, I mean,\nI'm like feeling myself tear up right now.\nI mean, it's, it was so\ncrushing to hear this story.\nAnd totally unbeknownst to him,\nI had a lot of history\nwith depressive episodes.\nAnd when I say near suicide,\nI had it on the calendar.\nI had a plan.\nI was going to kill myself.\nI knew exactly how I was going to do it.\nI knew where I was going to do it.\nI knew all of the variables\nthat I needed to account\nfor to get it done.\nAnd\nthe only reason that didn't happen,\nfor people that don't have the context,\nwhich most people won't, is\nI had tried to reserve a\nbook at Firestone Library,\nthis is at Princeton,\nwhich had something to do with suicide.\nIt was like assisted suicide,\nlike \"The Clinician's\nGuide to Euthanasia\",\nsomething like that.\nAnd it wasn't in,\nand I had forgotten to change my address\nat the registrar's office.\nI was taking a year away from school.\nAnd that was to focus\non finishing my thesis.\nIt was to try a few jobs,\nbut I'd ended up in a very bad place\nand was feeling very isolated.\nAnd my friends were\ngraduating a year ahead of me\nand I was stuck on this thesis.\nAnd there's a lot of backstory\nthat I won't bore people with,\nbut it got to the point where I decided\nnot that objectively my life is bad.\nI think this is where people\nwho haven't experienced\ndepression get a little confused,\nor it's hard for them to identify\nwhen they give advice\nto a depressed person,\nbecause you might say to\na depressed person, like,\n\"But look, your life is so great.\nLike there's this, there's\nthat, there's this.\"\nAnd for a lot of depressed people to say,\n\"Yeah, I know.\nI look at that and I can't fix my state\nbecause I am broken.\nAnd if this is how I'm going\nto have to live forever\nwith being this broken and dysfunctional,\nand to have this internal\nhell that I live day by day,\nI just want to escape.\"\nIt's like someone jumping\nout of a burning building.\nIt's like they don't\nwant to kill themselves,\nbut they're jumping out\nof a burning building.\nAnd\nso I had it on the calendar,\nand thank God this was back\nwhen they would still send you\na physical reminder in the mail,\na little postcard that\nsays, \"Your book is in.\"\nAnd that card went to my parents' house\nand my mom saw it\nand panicked and called me.\nAnd I lied.\nI said it was for a\nfriend who went to Rutgers\nwho was doing a project on A, B, and C,\nbut it's, it was just enough\nto kind of snap me out of the trance\nand realize that\nkilling yourself is like\nputting on a suicide vest\nwith explosives and walking into a room\nof all the people you care the most about\nand blowing yourself up.\nSo that snapped me out of it\nbut no one knew this.\nThis guy certainly didn't know that.\nAnd that is when I went home\nand thought about it and just decided\nokay,\nthere's a chance if I write this,\nit's not certain,\nbut there's a chance that\nthis might help someone.\nIt might prevent someone\nfrom doing what I was almost about to do.\nAnd so I spent months\ngetting this post written\nand put it out\nand I know for a fact it has\nsaved minimum dozens of lives.\nAnd there are other things\nincluding a very\nextensive list of resources.\nAnd so that\ngave me\nI suppose not a toe in the water,\nbut sort of jumping\nfeet-first into the deep end,\nan experience of being that vulnerable.\nAnd this was a long time ago.\nI mean, this is, I want to say\nat least eight to 10 years\nago when I put that post out.\nAnd\nthen\nI want to say it was just\nbefore COVID lockdown,\nI was in Costa Rica visiting a friend.\nI was with my girlfriend at the time,\nand she knew a secret of mine.\nAnd she was one of maybe\ntwo or three people who knew\nthat I'd been sexually\nabused when I was a kid\nby a babysitter's son\nfrom two to four, roughly,\nand\nroutinely,\nall the time kind of thing.\nAnd\nyeah, like what you're envisioning\nis what happened,\nso it was not good.\nAnd that had been compartmentalized\nand locked away for my whole life.\nI was like, that's in the past,\nwe're focused on moving forward\nand nothing to be fixed, nothing to fix.\nAnd that was my perspective on things.\nIt turned out\nwasn't quite that simple, right?\nAnd so I had done a lot of work,\na lot of therapy,\nused psychedelic as therapies as well,\nwhich, once again, are\nnot all upside potential.\nThere are some significant risks.\nBut I had come a long way\nand my plan had always been to\nwait until my parents passed\nbecause I didn't want them\nto blame themselves for this,\nand then to write a book.\nAnd there was something though at the time\nwhen I was having dinner\nwith my girlfriend\nthat was dissatisfying about that plan.\nIt, there was something\nabout it that bothered me\nand I couldn't quite put a finger on it.\nAnd I was talking to her\nabout it, and she said,\n\"That's going to take a long time.\"\nShe was like, \"Have you ever\nthought about how many people\nare going to pass away\nor die\nor suffer between now and\nwhen you publish that book?\"\nAnd\nI thought about it,\nand it was at that dinner that I decided\nto at least record a podcast\ncovering this terrain.\nI was not at all convinced\nthat I wanted to publish it.\nI was terrified of publishing it,\nalso because it meant opening myself up\nto a lot of conversations\nor maybe just\nhurtful commentary online, who knows?\nLike people are,\nthere are a lot of idiots out there\nand a lot of otherwise fine people\nwho are idiots on the internet.\nSo I was very hesitant,\nultimately decided I didn't\nwant to do it as a one-man show.\nI didn't want to make it a monologue.\nSo I asked my friend, Debbie Millman,\nwho had been on my podcast,\nshe's an amazing graphic\ndesigner and teacher,\nbut she had unexpectedly on my podcast\nbased on some of my questions\nfor the first time publicly told her story\nabout being sexually abused,\nand so I had leaned on her in\nyears after that in private.\nAnd I asked her if\nshe'd be willing to have\na conversation with me about\nour respective journeys\nand what it felt like,\nwhat it looked like,\nwhat helped, what didn't help,\nwhat worked, what didn't\nto provide at the very least\na glimmer of hope for people\nwho\nwere keeping some of these dark secrets\nor contending with them,\nnot knowing what to do with them.\nAnd we had that conversation\nand I sat on it.\nI sat on it, I sat on it,\nand then I put it out\nand\ndecided in advance that I would\nnot look at any social media\nfor at least several weeks afterwards.\nIf my team saw anything on\nsocial media or got emails,\nI didn't want to see anything\nother than positive feedback,\nwhich is not my de facto.\nI am usually\neager to solicit constructive feedback,\nbut in this case,\nI knew that my own position\nwas too vulnerable.\nI didn't want to\nopen up the possibility\nof destabilizing myself.\nAnd I put it out and\nI think it's the most important\npodcast I've ever put out,\nso I kind of felt like my job was done\nfrom a podcasting perspective after that.\nAnd\nit's been incredibly gratifying.\nI think it has certainly\nhelped a fair number of people.\nAnd it was also really hard\nbecause what I didn't anticipate was\nI would say of my\nreally super high-performing,\nclose male friends,\nmaybe half\nreached out to me to tell\nsomeone for the first time\nabout their extremely awful, graphic,\nfirsthand experience of\nbeing sexually abused.\nThe percentages were mind blowing,\nlike the actual percentages\nwere super, super, super high.\nWhich is part of the\nreason I mentioned earlier,\nI think it's good to\nspend a little bit of time\nin those empty spaces to see, you know,\nam I\nin a positive energetic sense\npursuing something good,\nor am I running away from\ndemons whipping my back?\nAnd\nfor a lot of those guys,\nI'm sure it's true for a lot of women too,\nlike\nthey find medication\nthrough intense focus and achievement,\nwhich is super adaptive in a lot of ways,\nbut it doesn't always have\nlifetime reliability.\nAnd\nthat's the story.\nIt's impossible to hear those stories,\nyour story without feeling\nsome substantial emotion.\nI'm not trying to intellectualize, it's,\nboth of those aspects of\nyour history that you shared\nare huge, right?\nThey really are.\nThey're obviously huge for you\nand they're huge in terms\nof the positive impact\nin the world.\nI know this because I have\nread the comments, right?\nAnd I, and I've talked to people who have\nlistened to those podcasts\nand read those blogs\nand have similar or maybe\ndifferent stories of trauma.\nBut I think as with your work\nin the psychedelic space,\nas with your work in\nthe physical augmentation space,\nwhatever you want to call it,\nit's apparent that you're willing to be\nfirst man in on a lot of things\nand really make,\nyou're sitting alone\nthere in those moments.\nAnd these categories of\nrevealing trauma are,\nin my mind anyway,\nso much more substantial\nin terms of their impact,\npositive impact and the\nother aspects for our body\nand psychedelic work, et cetera,\nis also tremendously impactful.\nSo that's saying a lot.\nSo just want to say thank you\nfor your bravery and.\nThanks, Andrew.\nYeah,\nit's crazy\n'cause I think that a lot of people\ncan imagine telling a story\nor to a close friend or something,\nbut you know, to put\nit out into the world,\nyou know, it's like, it's huge.\nLike, you don't know how\nthat's going to ripple.\nAnd you've been a real pioneer\nand example for me,\nfor Lex, for other people\nin revealing things not\nlike that, but different.\nTIM FERRISS: Yeah.\nPeter Attia has recently\nbeen opening up about some\nserious challenges that he's had\nin his book.\nHe does that on podcasts.\nHe's been doing it so, you\nknow, yet another category,\narguably the most important category\nfor exploration and sharing and, you know,\nthoughtful bravery, right?\nBecause he didn't just put\nit out there in any form.\nSo\none thing I do know by experience is\nthere's nothing weirder\nthan being told thank you\nfor the painful thing that you did,\nso I don't want to push that too far\nbut I'd be remiss if I didn't.\nTIM FERRISS: Yeah, yeah.\nBecause it really has its impact,\nand for doing it again here today,\nbecause.\nTIM FERRISS: Yeah.\nSo yeah, that, huge thanks for doing that.\nYeah, my pleasure.\nAnd I'll also say, you know,\nI got advice from a\nvery, very experienced psychedelic\nfacilitator at one point\nwho said, \"Take the pain and\nmake it part of your medicine.\"\nAnd the way I think that applies here\nis\nwe all experience pain,\nwe all experience suffering.\nMany of us have experienced\ntrauma of one type or another.\nAnd\nthat can consume you.\nI mean, it can consume you,\nbut it's like fire, right?\nIt can consume you but\nyou can also harness it\nand use it for different things.\nAnd\nI know for,\nI think it's, I'm not going to hedge,\nI'll say I know for a fact\nthat there are people I've\nspoken to who are suicidal.\nAnd by the way, I'm not inviting\neveryone who's listening\nif you are suicidal\nto reach out to me,\n'cause it won't work.\nI've had to disengage from that\nbecause it gets too heavy, right?\nJust to engage one-on-one\nwith people who are suicidal,\nbut there are resources\nin that post I mentioned,\nthe \"Practical Thoughts on Suicide\",\nbut let's just talk about closer friends,\npeople you would never\nsuspect in a million years\nwho are this close to\nblowing their brains out.\nPeople folks would\nrecognize in some cases.\nThe fact that I was also there once is\nwhy they listen to me,\nbecause I have, unfortunately,\nI'm a subject matter expert,\nman, I have credibility.\nAnd that actually is very redeeming.\nIt provides some meaning to the suffering\nthat I experienced.\nIt's like, okay, here I am\nfor whatever host of reasons\nI am put in this place in time\nwith this person,\nand they don't trust the input\nof these other people they're talking to\nbecause those people\ndon't know what it's like.\nBut I can look at this person in the eye\nand be like, \"Oh, I know.\"\nAnd that's just a different thing.\nSo you can\nfind a way to transmute that pain\ninto something meaningful,\ninto a gift,\nthat hopefully you can share in some way.\nNot necessarily with the whole wide world,\njust one person.\nThat's a big deal.\nOne person's a big deal.\nThere's a lot out there that is\nintended for mass consumption\nthat gets in front of millions of people,\ndoesn't really impact a\nsingle person very much.\nSo even if you don't have\npodcasts, you don't have books,\nif you have the ability to\nsit down with one person\nand really make an impact,\nthat's actually more meaningful\nthan most of the crap\nthat gets put out there.\nSo, take heart.\n[Music Playing]"
